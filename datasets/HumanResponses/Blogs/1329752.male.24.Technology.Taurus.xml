      fear conquered me. that is one of the many reasons why i choose to closed the door that has been always opened for you to enter. i admit. having you is more than just my vivid thoughts. never did i wanted to say goodbye to the feelings i always wanted to stay forever but i have to accept the fact of the matter that the more i try to conceal this feeling, the more pain it will bring.   now i fully understand the theory behind my science, and now i know that it will never ever reach a single possibility.  heaven would never meet the earth halfway to wrap her clouds to it's mountain.  you tried to be oblivious that you never cared about my world and how affected it is. you pushed me away, hurted me by words, closed your trust and ignored me for no reason... but you never really protected yourself by doing it. you have just prisoned youself with fear and guilt itself.   i won't blame you for it. no i won't... never will i ask you to hold my hand and try to make you believe in everything i'll say. how i wish i could talk with you everyday, everyminute... just like those people who are close to you... just like before. well i think this is destiny's way of stabilizing my innermost feelings under the most deepest pressure i have ever felt for a person.  i learned so many things from all the pains you brought inside my heart. before we're being bounded by fear itself... now, we're being driven away by too many reasons that have been such a coldplay between us. it hurts me, but i'd rather let my feelings go than having it grown cold inside.  you're old enough to know what is right and what is wrong. and i do hope that as of now that you're not getting any younger, you'll be able to realize that your age should be accompanied by  "maturity"  and not just by the biological reaction of getting taller. i know that experience is one good way of practical learning, but if that would only inflict you clear and present danger then i'd rather choose to die than getting hurt of seeing one of the most important person in my life suffer.        i will always be here for you... to talk to, to listen, to cheer you up, to share your problems. no matter how far our distance may go... no matter how hard it is. no matter what the consequences are... i don't need you. i need your trust... for having one's trust is much harder than having the person itself... i'll let go and say goodbye to my feelings... but i will never let go of you along the way.  perhaps, all good things are molded by time...

      it was fun there at work. everybody seems to be friendly so medyo ginaganahan ako magtrabaho. pati boss ko ok eh. may pagka pranka. i do enjoy the harmony working there without you being pressured. ok kase yung samahan nila... wala yung bossy bossy effect.   after work dumiretso ko ako sa p.g. (syempre yung MRT saka LRT lumiko. kase kung dumiretso yun, babangga and mamamatay kami... =)) i mean pumunta ako sa pedro gil. i burned copies of some old files and stuffs that i do need the following day. revoj told me punta daw kami sa wow philippines, mas maganda daw sa kesa roxas blvd. so punta kami afterwards pagkakain namin ng kikiam (nakakita naba kayo ng kikiam?) diretso kami sa wow and just like baregreenson said, maganda nga talaga. umm'.. ok naman. we drank few smb in cans and taho (yeah taho and smb) tapos revoj started to contemplate about her girls. hehe. well the usual thing, 2 timing and all that usual shit finding out na he's more likely "inlab" with the latter one rather than the original and syempre he needs to dump one in which he also doesn't want to feel the guilt na he'll be dumping the original because he's inlab with the latter... sabi niya: "pare siya talaga yung gusto ko, sya gusto ko mapangasawa". sabi ko: "tangna naman maliit kapa sinasabi mo nayan eh. besides, pag kayong dalawa na and may na meet ka na namang ibang girl and naging close kayo, sigurado kabang hindi mo na sasabihin ulit yan?" well i made him think about that. yun kase hirap minsan eh. di marunong makuntento, alam mong matutukso ka sa iba, bat kapa didiskarte. "in the game of seduction there is only one rule, never fall inlove." yan ang sabi sa cruel intentions, and it's true. meron pang isa. "we don't fall in love, we choose to be with it." ( sino ba nagsabi sakin non? umm... =) ) that's one good line. and it's also true... ( how i wish she also chooses to be with me. ;) )  nakaupo kami dun sa silya na kamukha nung inuupunan ni forest gump. bigla umambon, then umulan. syempre takbo kami. umm.. since it's almost 12 MN narin, we decided to go home. punta kami ng parking and found out. flat tire. so we waited for mins, umm'.. i think almost 30 mins. tapos tumila ng konti and i'm feeling tipsy narin because of 4 smb's tapos labas kami naka hubad, mga katabi namin sasakyan naka alis na lahat while we're there changing tire. freak.   few more minutes and we're ok. i arrived home 1 something. texted someone and fall asleep...    -fin-

       [ i hate: sick minds... ]   there's one characteristic i don't like about some women. sometimes they tend to be assuming... i know this doesn't apply to all but most of them are. pagka nakipag kaibigan ka, akala nila crush mo siya... kapag   tinext mo ng sweet  , akala niya may gusto ka sa kanya... kapag humingi ng favor and   tinulungan mo  , akala niya patay na patay ka sa kanya... kapag nagparamdam ka na   you do care about her  , akala nila gusto mo dumiskarte. and sometimes it ends up worst pa. it's either she grabs the opportunity of that friendship or she  ignores you for no reason . akala lang nila lahat yun eh. well nde naman lahat ng lalake sa mundo na tumutulong, sweet and caring sa isang girl eh may gusto na agad although it shows na 90 out of 100 guys do use it as a part of their strategies. (plan a plan b plan c) well some guys are just fucking friendly and thats it. that's the reason bakit ganon. maybe some of you are thinking why am i saying this, well it's because ganun ako and i don't like being misinterpreted. hindi porket "sabay nako sayo" "puntahan kita minsan" "ako bahala dyan" "nag lunch kna?" "tulog kna" "musta klase?" eh ibig sabihin crush na kita, mahal na kita, gusto ko kunin fone number mo?, etc. blah blah blah... well not to be bias ganon din sa part ng girl kung minsan, some guys do really have a sick mind din. ganun din sa lalake, just like what i always says, people are people. (naalala ko tuloy yung gusto kong damit. hehe.) as long as nde nakakasama at nakaka apekto sa ibang tao, i don't care. ituloy niyo. ok lang yun... =)  isa lang mahal ko eh and kahit medyo mahirap, ok lang. =)  -fin-

      in times of trouble i want to fall down, all those things i have to give. but sure i won't and i'll rediscover, that for you i will believe.  the will of the wind blew very fast, and there are times i get afraid. of losing you it conquers me, but still i'm trying to be brave.  we started out as acquaintance, that day can you remember? when i asked for your name i never thought, that will i also surrender.  surrendered myself, my heart, my mind, to you i cared to you i cry. you've been a part of me since time are us, and i'm willing to prove it until i die.  do you like me? do you care for me? did u let your heart fall away? by my heart that's touching you, have you thought that my love would stay?  nothing can stop me, nor this feeling i have for you. just hang on and hold my hand, everything will be fine...  everything that we'll do.  i never assumed anything, cause i know that would be wrong. it will always be your eyes, the window of truth that makes me strong.  how i wish i was the man on your lyrics, how i wish i was the one behind your writings. if you say yes regarding my wishful thinking, i'll wait for your poem that will serve as a new beggining.  answer my questions please...  will you? set my mind free and at ease... with my heart for you...  my feelings will never die, just like what true love means. someday when time has come, i know you'll believe me  and then you'll be convince.   so for now i need your trust, don't let yourself fall along the way. i know that God is good and almighty, so i asked him to protect you each loving day.  no matter how the distance is, i will always be a soul to protect you. just always pray and in time we'll see, that 9 + 12 do you have a clue?

      [ the reason why some pictures here aren't loading... ]  gate.polarhome.com is down. Main HDD in gate.polarhome.com died. It contined the whole www.polarhome.com plus five months backup from all member server. Server will be recovered, but there are some damages that can not be repared.  Please note, that 12 member servers as redhat, debian, AIX, VAX etc, are not affected with this crash. They will continue to operate as usual, but some services will not be available imediately.  Q: How can such things happen to polarhome.com A: First: polarhome can not appreciate a real backup system that could satisfy polarhome current needs (about 60G compressed) therefore one HDD had been used for such purpose. Second: polarhome operates on home equipment that can not survive more than 4 years in such work environment. First died Ultrix box, then RedHat's HDD, then FreeBSD's, now gate's... which one is next? It is running out of control. There are too many users and to high expectations towards polarhome. But it will not change the reality. polarhome.com is not a professional system and everybody have to be aware of it... and on non professional eqipment shit happens more often. :(

      mood: inlove with one person...  i really got nothing to say. i should be sleeping by now since i must wake up by 5 am. it's 2 am and still i can't sleep. the thoughts of you reflects a smile in a mirror beside my bed. well i guess i'm just pretty thankful that everything seems to be fine right now. thank God. i know this wouldn't be forever but if ever forever will not meant to be, time will show how important you are to me...  perhaps, every good thing takes time... always take care people.   "What can I do? To make you feel secure. Remove all your doubts, so that you'll know for sure that you're the apple of my eye girl... fulfillment of my dreams. Time, will show the value of just what you mean to me. More precious than silver, more precious than diamond rings or anything that I can give you. It wouldn't mean a thing, if you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through. Well it is good to know you do... I know just how you feel, but this time love's for real. In time it will reveal that special love that's deep inside of us... will all reveal in time..."    (B. DeBarge/El DeBarge) - Time Will Reveal

      my mood: evil when provoked ...  last week i read an article sa inq7.net about this dumaguete scandal thing, well i really don't care about that issue pero there's something inside me saying i should write something about it. well to give you an idea, this is about a sex video of some teens from dumaguete that has been taped from a hidden camera and are now being sold to the public. faces of the women have clearly appeared on the taped p0rn. well yun ang masakit, from all angles kahit saan mo tingnan it's clear. the women have been exploited. almost the whole province pati na dito sa manila the video is being sold sa black market. well almost all of the town folks including their families have watched the taped p0rn... and yun ang masakit. yung iba iniwan ng mapapangasawa, yung isa naman nag attempt nagpakamatay and yung iba nagtatago because of too much shame... i know men has their ways of satisfaction regarding sex pero i think this isn't a pretty way to healthy satisfaction. well i'm a guy. hindi ako santo, hindi ako magpapakaplastic sa inyo. i can be naughty at times, i also do know how most men think... pero in that particular part wherein taping p0rn and publishing it into copies, dyan ako against. on the first place those women na gumanap sa video are not really p0rnographers, well they do sex pero they've done it just because they feel like doing it. i don't really care about them. it's a bitch thing. pero it doesn't mean na if you're a bitch, people has the right to exploit you... well this particular issue doesn't apply whether they're bitches or not. the thing is this can also happen to anybody... including your girl, including your sister or  any special women in your life ...  sex is a very private issue with a very minimal relationship with the word love . kaya naman kapag sex ang pinaguusapan, lumalabas yung word na morality... actually sex isn't really immoral. i grew up in a catholic school and once i can still remember sabi ng teacher ko sa values ed.  "sex is a gift from God. sex is beautiful if only will be use in a nice way."  well in my opinion, tao lang ako, sex can be sometimes a part of a lustful thread... pero using sex as tripping to destroy once integrity, honor and morale.. never it will stand a chance in my mind. ano kaya naiisip nitong mga  tanginang tao  natoh? they can hire a bitch naman for them to taped their p0rn, well if they don't find it exciting and they do taped p0rn, sana lang di na nila pinublicize and di na nila pinagkakitaan... i think the justice system should streghten its law regarding violation against privacy and morality. the people should also do their part... madaling hanapin ang sex. totoo yan. pero we also shouldn't forget na we could be a victim not only by this issue, but by sex itself...

[1.]  im missing someone  - but because i don't want to show concern and affection anymore nagprepretend nalang ako na i don't. some people don't like it being so concern and so caring to them. i understand.  and even if you don't care, still i'll always will .  [2].  i need to pay the phonebill  - it's already 12k. i know some of you have already experience this and in some cases maybe much worst.   well that's for now. need to sip the coffee and start working.  take care   whoever   you are.

      last week umm.. it was a sunday, i woke up late na eh. i woke up by the disturbing noise of the band here in our place a hundred meters away from the gate. sabi ko kay ate "bat may banda dyan?" sabi niya "yung binata dyan sa dulo, yung laging dumadaan dyan naka black na car baka kilala mo yun, nagpakamatay." umm.. the young boy shot his head and syempre died in an instant. it was really sad. though nde ko naman kilala yung tao, i wish somebody had cut his intentions that moment when he was about to attempt killing himself. the sad thing was, he succeeded.    "the real suicidal people don't seem it. The people who attempt suicide just want attention. If they really wanted to die, they would have done it right."    this message came from the same site where i got my welcome note. i found it true. since the person who owns the page is now gone, taking also her life away.   some questions behind a self inflicting death: what is suicide? why does mostly young adults tends to attempt suicide? what are the danger signs?  - suicide is defined as the act of deliberately taking one's own life. statistic shows that for every two homicides in the U.S. there are three suicides. every hour and forty-five minutes another young person commits suicide. suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among college students and the third-leading cause of death among youth overall (ages 15-24).   - pain is the main reason why many people mostly young adults think that killing oneself is the best soulution in ending lifes problems. people tends to turn into suicide because they are seeking relief from pain they are encountering. this could be both physical and emotional pero sometimes the latter one is usually the main crop. nde naman lahat ng nagpapakamatay eh desperado. merong iba trip lang nila and yung iba pressured lang, yung iba nagpapakabayani, pero mas malaki talaga ang sakop ng emotional pain. some emotional causes of suicide are: failure to achieve a great dream, family problems, relationship problems like break up etc, denial of public acceptance etc. etc. coping with pain alone is one of the major factors why most suicidal attempts succeeds.   - these are some danger signs of suicides, credits to  urlLink teenage-suicide.com :   previous suicide attempts.  the verbalizing of suicide threats.  the giving away of prized personal possessions, the collection and discussion of information on suicide methods.  the expression of hopelessness, helplessness, and anger at oneself or the world, themes of death or depression evident in conversation. written expressions, reading selections, or artwork, statements or suggestions that the speaker would not be missed if he or she were gone. the scratching or marking of the body, or other self-destructive acts. recent loss of a friend or a family member (or even a pet) through death or suicide; other losses (for example, loss of a parent resulting from divorce).  acute personality changes. unusual withdrawal, aggressiveness, or moodiness, or new involvement in high-risk activities. sudden dramatic decline or improvement in academic performance, chronic truancy or tardiness. physical symptoms such as eating disturbances, sleeplessness or excessive sleeping, chronic headaches or stomachaches, menstrual irregularities, apathetic appearance.  Use or increased use of substances.   - suicide isn't my recommended solution for a problem. besides, it'll gonna make the problem worst. when things go wrong and you think there's no hope, then think again... it's either it'll be too late or too early for you.

       "when I'm feeling blue, all I have to do. is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue. when you're close to me, I can feel your heart beat, I can hear you breathing near my ear. wouldn't you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love."   umm'.. i pressume some of you have already heard this song. it was a 1980's ba? am i right? or a 1970's song by phil collins. well ala lang... kase yesterday when i was inside the train the song suddenly played in my mind. well nde naman ako nagpapaka senti kahapon dahil ang aga aga eh mag cocontemplate ako.   meron pang isa eh yung ...   "sugar, ah honey honey, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you. honey, ah sugar sugar, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you."    urlLink  sugar honey - archies   umm... hehe. it's a 1950's song by the archies. my colleague asked me bakit daw puro oldies laman ng fone ko. dati daw rock and lite alternative and now 1950's to 80's oldies. umm.. well it's much better than listening to boy band musics. (no offense sa mga BB fanatic ha...)  isa lang na appreciate ko sa boy band, it's 98 degrees.   "baby I, really know by now. since we met that day, you show me the way. I felt the day you gave me love I can't describe, how much I feel for you. I said baby I, should have known by now. should have been right there whenever you gave me love.  and if only you were here , i'll tell you, yes I'll tell you..." =)   does the highlighted part makes some sense?... i guess.   work muna me. take care people. onga pala muntik nako mapaaway dito sa magallanes kahapon. umm.. di ko alam kung masama ba ko makatingin or talagang trip ako nung gago. yung kundoktor the jeep nang aano eh... umm...  siguro kung nde ako naka polo and nde ako late umm... lagot.  work muna me.   -fin-

      it was 8 pm  nang lumabas ako kagabi. umm.. medyo pagod. di nako sumabay kina sir umuwi ng 7.  mga 8 kase ako nalang tao mag isa ang medyo madilim na dito sa taas kaya umuwi nako. badtwip akalimutan ko pa bumili ng stored value ticket. pila pa tuloy ako. hehe.. i was inside the train eh medyo wala ako sa sarili. i had these wishful thinking na tumatakbo daw kami sa park and i was holding her hand tapos napagod daw siya tapos umupo kami dalawa and after that she looked at me in the eye tapos nun sumandal siya chest ko. awwsss... lol. =) taena lumalabas na naman kakornihan ko.  hehehe... sometimes i used to imagine how tall she is.. lolz. ang masama pa non muntik nako lumagpas ng isang train station.   "nasira na yata ang ulo ko, kaiisip ko sa 'yo. kahit saan tumingin ay mukha mo ang nakikita ko! pero bakit para kang naiilang, ako ay iyong iniiwasan? ako'y nahihirapan, wala namang ganyanan! pakiramdam ko ngayon ako ay nagmumukhang gago! ngayon ako'y nagsisisi kung bakit ako nag "i love you"!!! kasi di na tayo tulad ng dati ngayon sa akin ay diring- dire!"   naalala  ko yung song natoh nung umiihi ako kahapon sa c.r eh...   wow parokya ni edgar. hehehe... well it's one of my favorite local bands. dati kse i used to like boy bands when i was still a  good and peaceful loving person. in short nung goodboy pako. pero sa showbiz pala este sa tunay na buhay di pala pwedeng lagi ka nalang goodboy.  umm.. and there was light.   hanggang kelan kaya toh? umm... ewan ko.  tangna nababaliw nako.   i'm planning to buy a toy car. umm.. para di nako mag commute. yung mura lang (di ko naman kaya bumili ng mahal eh) kia ok na. hehe. basta good running condition. umm'... bahala na. sana bago mag next year. =)   well that's all for now. i need to work. take care... peeps.

      i've been hibernating inside my room for the whole day. walang magawa. 4 pm nako nagising. natulog ako may coup d'etat daw. pagising ko meron nga. nasakop na pala nila ang glorietta. well i think the military rebels do have their pogi points. i don't have a grudge in our present government pero siguro kung nde naman gumawa ng move itong mga military rebels nde rin nman magigising itong bulok na sistema sa gobyerno. umm... it's a painful truth though. imajin last week or last last week, nakatakas itong si fucking alghozi. (remember the rizal day bombings of year 2001? yung 5 bombang pinasabog sa ibat ibang part ng manila) well he's the guy responsible for those bombings. para bang ang buhay ng tao eh bahagi na lamang ng statistics... ganito ang namatay, ganito ang nasugatan, all in all etc. etc. blah blah blah ... well lagi naman ganyan dito sa pilipinas diba? umm.. that isn't the first case na nangyari yun... yung tipong ihaharap sa media and then meeting meeting etc. kung ano anong publicity issues na ganito ganyan etc. tapos nakakulong sa loob ng kampo sabay few days later makakatakas... lol. hehehe.  putanginang  mga tao naman nagbabantay dyan =) plus those higher authorities inside the chain of command... so syempre people would think na pinatakas nga. dalawa lang naman pagpipilian ng AFP, pinatakas nila or stupido sila diba? ohh please don't tell us those craps na nakatakas or anything bullshit. it ain't workin' anymore =) so syempre humahaba yung spaghetti pababa este yung topic.. hehe. for me, court marshal by the judge advocate group (jag is a branch inside the armed forces, sila ang humahawak ng kaso ng mga sundalo, just like pag nasa gobyerno ka, ang humahawak ng kaso is ombudsman) doesn't make real sense to those guys in uniform behind that incident. dapat dyan reclusion perpetua (life inprisonment, wow lumalabas na yung pagiging frustrated law student ko. lol) so syempre dyan na papasok yung human rights issue... binababy kase eh kaya lagi nalang nauulit... this isn't the 1st time, daming beses na nangyari yan nakaktakas kung sino sino. kung hindi drug lord, abu sayaff ngayon naman terorista nakatakas... tsk tsk. nothing new to the philippine government bureaucracy. meron pang mas nakakatawa dyan eh.. umm.. yung pagawaan ng methamphetamine hydrochloride sa loob ng bilibid prison. wow imajin sa loob ng kulungan may factory ng shabu. lol. well siguro those jail guards thought it wasn't shabu at first... maybe they thought it's only hydrogen peroxide (yung agua oxenada para sa sugat) kaya nde nila pinapansin. hehehe. =) well it's another page of the book since ang characters are jailguards pero wala ding pinagkaiba since they have been trained from either AFP or PNP.  i used to admire the philippine armed forces when i was a kid. until those days na nag tyatyaga ako sa cadet corps just to reach my dream. but now, wala na sila pinagkaiba sa pulitika ng gobyerno.  the masses should also do their own part. yung iba dyan puro rally wala naman talaga natutulong na maganda. hirap kse sa iba sakay ng sakay sa issue di naman nila alam kung para saan amp.  baka na realized lang nung mga nag rebelde na mukha na pala silang tanga sa loob ng armed forces. so nakaisip sila ng mas magandang gimmick. well kayo ba naman na mga sundalo eh takasan ng drug lords saka ng terorista eh syempre mag mumukha ka ngang tanga. well i think tama sila sa ginawa nila... aside from being loud and mean they have also created another page for elementary history books. that's quite good. ang ayoko lang eh di manlang nagka barilan. di man lang nagkagulo amp. sumuko pa sila agad... sana kahit konting action pack may nang yari para may thrill.

      i'm not feeling well. i have this slight depression since yesterday.  i can't even think right at this moment. me and one of my friends will be conducting a seminar this coming saturday and i haven't refresh my mind about the topics yet. neither i have created the slides.  sometimes i used to think na i do have a chronic psychological disorder. it's more than just my paranoia and inferiority complex.  i have this difficulty in concentrating.. at work, in anything i do.  i want to be alone. i might kill or get killed if right now someone irritating would dare to start a fight with me.   got this from kengkeng's blog: find it half true.   North Japan around the year 1275. Your profession was that of a jeweler or watch-maker.Your brief psychological profile in your past life. Such people are always involved with all new. You have always loved changes, especially in art, music, cooking.The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation. Your lesson is to learn discretion and moderation and then to teach others to do the same. Your life will be happier if you help those who lack reasoning.   ... die eri* die ...

      ngayon ko lang na realize na corny ko na naman. tangina di ako nakapasok kanina sa work. bwisit talaga bumabalik na naman sakit ko. tsk. di ko alam what can change me. am i really this lazy or what? if there is something that should motivate me it would be myself. tangina badtrip.   lahat ata ng mga taong maliliit ang katawan dati pag nakita ko ang lalaki na. langya ako nalang ata naiwanan ah.. di ako tumataba malakas naman ako kumain. i don't think kapag malakas kang kumain tataba ka. well almost all of them undergone work outs kaya ganon. mga dating classmates sa highschool, mga classmates sa corps, mga colleagues. ako maliit parin. well di naman ako maliit. proportion naman eh. para tuloy ako na iinganyo mag work out. tagal na kse nila ko sinasama ako lang tong may ayaw. now there's a need for me to think about my health naman. sitting here infront of my good old bestfriend plus an hours or radiation, tangina baka mapadali buhay ko nito.   gusto ko pa magka anak. gusto ko pa makita yung babaing mahal ko. and dami ko pa gusto gawin...   well kuntento naman ako sa buhay ko ngayon. di ako mayaman. di din ako mahirap. ok lang. masaya naman kami ng family ko. sakin basta masaya kami and di nag aaway sila mama at papa masaya naman ako eh. umm... di nga lang masaya as in masaya na husto. not until i had the chance to say my feelings to that someone personally, dun lang ako magiging masaya ng husto. cloud 9 as in...  sarap pala mag suicide sabay nde ka mamamatay. well that's one of my accomplishments. i guess God doesn't want me to die yet since dami ko pa daw dapat pagbayaran na kasalanan. well i'm thanking him na nde ko siya na convince. 2 days din ako bago nagising. last 1998 din yun eh. pinasok ako dun sa malaking tube... well parang na blog ko na toh before. umm.. what do you call that tube, umm.. CT scan (C means cerebro right? yung T di ko alam) kinuhanan din ako ng CFC sa likod. cerebro spinal fluid.   thank you talaga Lord nagising ako after 2 days. =)  i risks a lot. tahimik lang ako minsan. siguro ganon ako tlaga. sabi ng mga grade school teachers ko dati sa mama ko. "yang anak niyo ho nasa loob ang kulo". tangina what does that mean? ewan ko sa kanila. basta masaya ko nag bloblog ngayon...  sa lahat ng di ko binalak gawin eh ang mag drugs. sa mundong kinalakihan ko, ang drug trade ginagawa mismo sa kalsada. parang nag papalitan lang ng candy. pero di ako natuto, kahit mga kapatid ko. wala samin ang natutong mag bisyo. ewan ko kung bakit. siguro i just don't want to fail mg parents. i think that is one of their greatest failures about me kapag nag drugs ako. di lang talaga ko tumataba and lagi ako puyat pero di ako nag drudugs.   ang kaliwete daw magaling mag drawing. sabi ko sa kanila ewan ko. kaliwete ako and i was in grade school nung na realize ko na medyo totoo ang sabi nila. napansin ko lang nung kapag gumagawa ako ng drawings ng kung ano ano. (kadalasan anime) lagi nila hinihingi. nung high school ako ninakaw pa yung drawing ko ng taguro brothers sa notebook ko. i'm good in using the combination of pentel pen and colored pencil.  marijuana lang ang drugs na natikman ko. it was this umm.. february i think nung natikman ko yun. when i say natikman it means natikman talaga. bakit ko nasabi? kase di ko siya hinitit. pinalaman ko siya sa chocolate and kinain ko... wala naman ako naramdaman kakaiba just like what they say na ma hahigh ka or what. isang beses ko lang ginawa yun. never na ulit nasundan. wala akong balak sundan.  di siguro talaga ko lapitin ng disgrasya. ewan ko. ummm.. pero i'm thanking God at wala pa naman nangyari saking masama. di pako na holdap, di pako na snatch, di pako napaaway sa gimmick, di pa ko napag tripan kahit ummuwi ako ng madaling araw galing marikina. yung tipong bagyo, baha at lahat ng tao nasa bahay na ako naman nagbibiyahe naglalakad pauwi.  pinaka malayo ko nahatid siguro si lady. yung ex ko taga batangas. lol. bayani daw ako eh pag nag mahal. taenang yan... kahit wala nang biyahe papuntang maynila hinatid ko. syempre pababayaan mo ba naman yung taong mahal mo? =)  my most pathetic one liner na nasabi ko sa isang girl: "ok lang kahit dalawa kami. kahit di mo nako pansinin. basta wag mo lang ako iwan..." wahihihihihihihihi. daig ko pa naka drugs nung sinabi ko yan. =)  never ako nagloko sa relationship. that's one of my good achievements i guess. kung mag loloko man, loko lang talaga and hindi yung tipong papatulan ko ng pang matagalan para maging no. 2. never ako nang two time. di naman ako gwapo para mag two time.  one thing na hinahanap ko sa isang girl, yung pagiging faithful. ok lang kahit ano basta importante faithful sa relationship. dyan naman lagi nag uugat ang magandang relasyon eh.  isa pa sa pinaniniwalaan ko: never play with fire so you won't find yourself burned in the end. mahirap magtiwala sa iang relationship na nagsimula sa lokohan. no matter what you say, lokohan parin yun.  isa sa kinaiinisan ko: kapag nakakakita ako ng mga teenagers na nag haharutan at nag lalandian sa simbahan. i guess nde lang ako sanay or nde ko lang naranasan yon... ewan ko pero sana nde nalang sila nag simba. nakaka storbo sila sa mga gustong magdasal at gustong makinig sa misa. oo, hindi lahat ng nagsisimba eh naiintindihan ang misa. pero kahit konting pag galang nalang. mas bilib ako sa mga taong nde nag sisimba pero nag darasal. ang katwiran nila: "mas masama naman kung mag sisimba ka pero di ka naman nakikinig at napilitan kalang dahil obligasyon mo ito."  one topic na i don't argue with is about religion. as long as you believe in God wether it is: Jesus, Jehovah, or Allah. pare pareho lang silang Diyos. magkakaiba lang tayo ng paraan kung pano sila sambahin kaya minsan, di maiiwasan ang pagtatalo. pero wala naman talaga dapat pagtalunan diba? ayoko about belief is kulto. yung mga kung ano anong kulto na naglalabasan kung saan saang probinsiya. i think wala sila pinagkaiba sa satanista. the devil always have their own way of deception.  last week i learned na faith healing is healing by means of your own faith. its a fake healing rather. di nako naniniwala sa umiiyak na sto. niño, sinasapiaan ni mama mary or the like. if they wan't to make business, sana wag na nila gamitin ang pangalan ng Diyos.  i'm not a saint. i'm not a fake. di ako banal. di ako nag babanal banalan. i know some of you might have this kind of judgement towards me. ok lang yun... it's for me to know and for you to think about. (that's one of my favorite one liners...) i also do masturbate, i've experienced sex, i am once a former altar boy. not all altar boys are sacred. not all priests are sacred. i am with a bunch of acolytes when i had my first watched of p0rn movie.  i was 18 years old when i got my first sex experience. medyo masama. after the entrance of colors at ushering sa st. scho dumiretso kami ng 2nd class officers ko and some classmates sa cubao to get a paid sex. bibinyagan daw kami sabi ng mga upperclass. sabi sakin nung girl na napili ko: she was once from a good family. pero dahil sa family problems umalis siya sa kanila. wala siya mapuntahan, she was abuse from then and there hanggang she found herself getting paid for sex para mabuhay. (grabe ang epekto ng family problem sa isang taong mahina ang loob).  the issue about virginity isn't that important to me kapag mahal ko ang babae. kapag sinabi sakin na di na siya virgin well thats ok. kapag alam kong virgin ang mahal ko syempre iingatan ko. ayokong maranasan ng babaeng mahal ko kung pano magkamali. pagkakamaling di na pwedeng ibalik. di naman masamang mag paalala eh. ang masama pinabayaan mo siya.    ayoko ng sobrang bait na parang santa. too boring. ayoko ng sobrang gago. naranasan ko nang gaguhin eh. gusto ko tama lang. importante faithful.   gusto ko maranasan manligaw ng girl. di ko pa naranasan manligaw muna bago mag i lab u. lagi nalang nauuna M.U sabay i lab u sabay kami na.   i hate numbers. it makes me sick. i do believe na hindi lahat ng magaling sa math eh magaling sa logic and vice versa. hindi lahat ng magaling sa logic eh magaling sa math. dami ko kakilala na mahusay naman sa logic pero di ganon ka husay sa math. logic isn't math and math isn't logic although they always go together. i can argue with you a thousand words but i won't argue with you with a thousand numbers.   i don't like public attention. i always wanted to keep low. low profiled.  i don't read newspapers. i read it kapag may gusto lang akong issue.  faith, trust and respect is very important to me. perhaps, these are the best traits i learned at home and from past experiences.  simple lang ako pumorma. not unless i really need to.   kapag pupurihin moko and pag talikod ko iba ang sasabihin mo, thanks nalang.  the most ridiculous thing i've done, umihi ako sa gilid ng ATM machine.  i don't feel like using someone to get attention or to make news.  i can be rough sometimes. i'm frank kapag close ko yung tao. madali din akong sukatin.   sa discussion tahimik ako. taurus are more to be of a listener than a speaker and thats true.   i hate ball games. i love war games pero i hate counter strike.  yeah gago ako pero it's nice na di ko pa naranasan magalit ng sobra, siguro kapag sinaktan ang family ko or ang babaeng mahal ko or malapit kong kaibigan. dun lalabas pagka gago ko.  i don't give a damn about those people who like april boys, i don't even care about those people who like rock alternatives. hindi mo sarili ang mundo. kung hindi ka apektado then wag ka mag react. if i like red hot chilli peppers music it doesn't mean na i'm anti-Christ, it just means na i like their music. kung poporma ako ng april boy. well it means na gusto ko pumorma ng april boy, it's none of your business. unless apektado ka or nasaktan ka or ibang tao wag ka makialam. baduy daw ang april boy music, baduy daw ang meteor garden, pangit daw si andrew e pati music niya. kung magsalita ang iba akala mo kung sino. =)    things i want to change sa sarili ko. i'm always late, i'm lazy, i care too much, i give to much. i don't speak much that's why i blogged much. madali din ako ma disturb. kapag disturbed ako di ko na tatapos isang bagay na dapat kong tapusin. and thats bad for me.  pinaka tanga kong ginawa. inamin ko sa girl na mahal ko siya kahit wala sa oras. napa oo tuloy sabay binawi na di pala ako mahal. (pero alam ko mahal din ako non.)  my greatest failure as of this life. nde ako naging sundalo. di ako nakapag pma. di ako naging black belter. di ako marunong mag bike.   when i say i'll wait... i'll wait. just don't let me wait for nothing.  when i tells you take care. it means take care, you're important to me and that's it. when i tells u tke cre, it means i'm thinking of you, you're important to me, i'll do anything for you, you're the one who can makes me cry (so pls don't make me cry every month), you've been a part of my life and i just can't admit how important you are, i miss you, i want to care for you, i .... ... wala lang. and that's it. =)   i'm planning to buy my own car by next year. i'm getting sick of the morning office rush.  i have these dream up to now. i'd like to be successful in my career. marry the lady that i love. have children. basta yung isa sundalo, yung isa pari. =) tapos gusto ko magtayo ng school para sa mahihirap. later ko na na realized yon.   di ako takot mamatay. =) takot ako na mawala ang mga taong mahal ko.    i aim for results. i don't care kung paano ginawa as long as ginawa sa magandang paraan and maganda ang results.   if you can't say anything good, if you can't even think of a solution for a problem, if you can't be a part of others solution, if you can't even help those people who are thinking for a solution, then just shut up.  all good things are molded by time. and it's true.  tulog nako. i guess said too much. =)

      4:40 nagising ako. natulog ako ulit. nagising ako 7:20 na. punyeta. i forgot na i still have work. tangna talaga bwisit. since i don't want to have another bad record di nalang ako pumasok. it's better to be absent than to be late for an hour. bwisit talaga.  i opened my pc. nagmamadali ako mag online pagkatapos kong informed sa work na di ako papasok. inantok ako eh... naka park parin id ko up to now na i'm doing this crap. all of a sudden i found myself staring at her picture. i was looking at it while i'm half lying down with my head in the pillow. the pic seems to stare at me too. i smiled and grab it on top of my pc. =)  humiga ako ulit. sumandal sa unan. i was holding the picture with my right hand. staring at it, staring at her big puffy eyes to be specific. parang buhay yung litrato.. parang magkalapit lang kami. she was smiling at me. looking at me too. i began to whisper these words:    "it was trully rewarding to have your friendship still amidst of all the consequences that happend between us. someday when the right time comes, we'll understand why ours, is not just an ordinary friendship. sincerity and pure intention can always last a lifetime."   i smiled, kissed, put it right into my chest and went back to sleep.

      dami ko gusto makita tao. umm.. those people whom i met before and those people whom i still never meet up to now.   yung mga taong naging bahagi ng buhay ko. in many ways. in different ways. they have contributed something to me for a change. for making me better. well here's the list:  - si edar. i used to call him edar. eduardo kse name niya. he's a friend when i was in grade 1. siya yung karate kid na bumasag ng hallow blocks sa school just to show off. lolz. - si  peter. peter francis farr. never saw him again after grade 3. he's a good friend. - umm... mga batchmates sa corp. umm... si aldie, si howard (naalala ko tuloy dati nung ginugulpi siya bigla siyang umiyak. di niya kase kabisado yung loyalty pledge. lolzz.), saka si val. asan na kaya sila ngayon? =) - umm... si jay. never saw him until now. ilang taon na din kami magkakilala and ilang beses na din siya umuwi ng pinas pero di ko pa siya nakita. - umm.. si sugar pwede ko ba sama? i met this girl few weeks ago. she's kind'a cool. (when i say cool, it means cool. just like i always says, no strings attached.) - save the best for last ba? =) umm... si laarni. i have my new one liner eh. "all good things are molded by time."  tulog nako.  -fin-

      the year was 1998. aug 12, 1998 to be exact. after the briefing inside the dmst office the 1st class ordered all c.o's to form outside. sa dating hang out. umm.. infront of ceu gate. so from the other side tumawid kami ng mendiola papunta sa gate. 2nd class sa harap, 3rd class sa likod, 4th class sa likod namin. 1st class are just roving around. the place is covered with silence and darkness. dilaw na ilaw ng poste lang ang nagpapaliwanag sa lugar bukod sa pa isa isang kotse na dumadaan. we have this logbook in which we log everyday sa loob ng sbc rotc. sa logbook may nakasulat sa harap. "there is always a time for reckoning..." and every wednesday night there is. kung gusto mo tumagal, you've got no choice but to absorb every bit of pain. it's either bakat ng kamay ang nasa dibdib mo, kulay violet ang tyan mo or may bakat ka ng shoe's sa damit mo. =) expect the worst every wednesday night. dahil kung 4th class ka tatlong batch ang dadaanan mo... from 1st to 3rd. kaya minsan di nako kumakain ng madami sa briefing.. just like yung isa kong batchmate who also never made it to the top. hawak siya sa collar ng isang upperclass and after few blows sa stomatch bigla siya sumuka. sinuka niya yung kinain niya nung briefing. (errr.. please excuse...) ughh... nakakatuwa din lalo na pag nakita mo na kulay violet ang tiyan niyo. wehehe. the following day the rectors office received a fax letter coming from an unknown source. stating the hazing incidents that is occuring every wednesday night sa rotc. they  formed a fuck (oh i'm sorry) it's a fact finding committee to investigate about the complaints. sa first letter wala ang names ng class namin, sa second letter kasama na namea namin. pati pangalan ko damay ampotah. sino nag squill? sino paba kungdi yung 4th class. well mukha namn talaga siya kawawa nung hinatid namin siya sa car niya that night aug 12. dami niya pasa. dumaan na sa 1st and 2nd class dumaaan pa sa mga batchmates ko. sana lang kung di niya kaya di na niya pinasok. umm.. ako di mahilig mang gulpi ng loweclass, madali kase ako maawa eh. kind hearted kumbaga. mahilig lang ako mag trip.   kumalat ang balita. nakarating sa taas. kung mang hahaze daw kami dapat tinatansta namin kung kaya ng tao. what if mamatay yung estudyante? umm.. lahat kami sumabit. and that's bad. naputol yung scholarship ng iba kong upperclass, msama non nagkakaso yung iba graduating na sila. few weeks later lumabas ang results galing sa rescom, dismiss ang kaso. walang hazing na nangyari. kanino pa nga ba kakampi ang mga sundalo sa loob? syempre pinagdaanan din nila yun so naiintindihan nila kami. not only those guys from the corps but also to those people from the fraternities, it's worth the pain when you reach the top right? =)  the masikhay class of '99 added few paragraphs to the rotc history of beda. well that hazing incident of 1998 is the main reason eh bakit nagkahiwalay ang rotc ng sbc and ceu.

      being tough wouldn't protect you... it'll just make you feel numb for a couple of days. just like an anesthesia injected right thru your left chest. just like a drug that has affected your brain... i know it would be hard for you to give up your pride. that's ok. sometimes being cruel helps us understand our lessons in life better after the high of having it. once it's gone, you could always look back and find your way home... i have already think about this before and i have also prepared myself for it. i never intended to change you. i know you wouldn't. i just want you to give way and to understand why you should... nde ko inakala na pati friendship natin gigive up mo... =')  i understand. it's really tiring to have someone always there willing to catch you everytime you fall.  it's up to you if you really want to end this. strong ka naman dba? ikaw bahala.   kahit ano... basta ikaw.

      i know, and i never judge you for what you are. kung masaya ka ng ganito sige ok lang. pipilitin ko maging masaya para sayo... i won't be able to forget you. u know na there's a piece of you inside my skull and there's a part of you beside my aorta. =')    you've been a good friend...    i always consider how special you are to me. and u know that. either we stay up late or i woke up early just to catch you here... in this stupid world where we met. we shared secrets, we shared laughter, we shared tears, we even shared passwords. you're the person i can trust my secrets to. i can still remember that day you told me na u cried coz' i said i have sars. remember that? it always makes my heart smiles a bit coz' it was really funny although i know it wouldn't be the same again.. =')   remember that day we fought? i was so fucked up that day in the office. bigla moko tinext    "eric get out of my head and let me sleep please" 14-may-2003 21:33:58    i'm not doing anything, yet di ko alam i was affecting you pala... i know my mistakes, i know i have to pay the consequences of my actions. i don't have any intentions of hurting you that day, i just wanted to make it clear about some sick part of your attitude. kung hindi kita aawayin sino mag lalakas loob na awayin ka? others would just accept it.   for me, no more good guys. yeah i missed those days na we always fought, na there's no communication for a couple of days and all that tapos bigla nalang tayo mag uusap. i missed it. siguro it's just one big hell of a reason why i started a fight that night.    you're more than a friend... you're more than a family...   the fact that we're bounded thousand miles away is one of the reasons why i can't help myself from crying each time we fight. hindi ko kase alam eh... kung pano ko gusto i prove sayo na i'm really sorry and i'm really sincere about all that shit.  did that word (sorry) ever existed in your vocabulary? or you just missed some english classes when you were in grade school?  it seems na you never really cared about me being sincere in everything i say.  =')  you know what hurted me the most? that part i was so freaked out in my table that office afternoon and i was asking you to forgive me but you really never cared. wow... tsk. you made it too harsh... i was feeling stupid na nga eh and then pinababa mo pa tingin ko sa sarili ko...  i was a piece of shit being ignored while i was watching you talking over the fone with someone.     you we're too busy entertaining him and you never cared about me running after...   once again ...  i =')   may kapalit na ba ko? may kapalit naba friendship natin? may nanliligaw ba sayo? may halaga pa ba ko sa buhay mo?   ...  i guess ... i don't really know.  yes, i know what kind of person you are coz' ur one of those people whom i really cared about. i don't know you that long but i know you very well...    yeah i can't sit beside you... i can't stroke your hair...  i can't smell the scent of your perfume... and i can't even be with you in a concert...   pero our presence each day makes us stronger than we think. matter matters when u study physics, it doesn't matter when you feel about it...   i had a strange feeling... i'm just too afraid to think.   ganito ba talaga pag naging totoo ka sa sarili mo? all i'm asking is a little change. i'm not asking for much. and knowing you that much isn't an exception to that crap na i know what kind of person you are. think about it.   isa lang naman pinaka tanga kong ginawa eh, i blogged about that most stupid thing b4... hindi ko pinag sisisihan yon. not even being true and being sincere in every single damn thing i say and do.   you're the only one who's prolonging my agony. just shoot me in the head and it would be better. well if you want me to go i'll go. if you wan't to end this friendship then end it straight... i won't look back, though you know i'm too afraid to lose you. well it'll just make me cry my eyes out. you're too tough. i always admire you for being one... sana kung may papalit ka sa friendship natin, yung kayang pantayan ang level ng pag treat ko sayo or higit pa.  dito lang ako... dito lang ako lagi.  my day will never be the same again...  mag iingaths ka palagi...   =')   always   tke cre  ...

       "when i do right nobody remembers, when i do wrong no one forgets."   well i don't want to post anything for now but since it's the 21st day of the month, this will be a special blog. why special? it's because i love 21. ok ok... i know you're tired of hearing the same old crap i've been telling since this blog goes online. 21 gives me both success and failures. failures with lessons. lessons that helped me grow. and growing that helped me understand and achieve success somehow. it gives me the high.. the high that surely i won't find with drugs or anybody, just with the number and anything, anyone attached to it.  senate bill2356 have already been aproved. after the formal induction it'll be a legal holiday every 21st day of august. this is to give credit for the untimely demise of ninoy aquino. well both of us have the credit for it i guess. =)  it's been almost a week since my last post and i'm having a hard time coping up with my daily schedules aside from the fact that i don't have a phone line anymore. it has been cut last week right after i paid a quarter of my bill.   well i can pay it in full but i'm afraid it would cost my daily allowance. i chose to be with this kind of stage rather than suffering with the consequences of my stupid actions when i'm online. before i am online almost 24/7. now it's only 12/5. 12 hours a day 5 days a week. i have already uninstalled IM programs in my office computer. it ain't healthy and appropriate for me to chat at work.   i also never opened my yahoo account for a long time. it reminds me of something bad that could almost make my skies really blue.   "no matter what i say or do, i always end up thinking about you still."   break;  --- i just finished talking with teejz. i was about to read a message in my fone and he called. he's in the hospital, doing his slides for the presentation with his lappy. umm'... he's confined there. i'm not sure if i heard it right on him but i think it's because of his heart problem. we talked about the seminar that we will be conducting this saturday at a government school in manila. it will be a real fun since the 2 or 4 of us rather will be there. well i told him to stop doing it for a while and to get some rest. ---  teejz, u take care pare.  let's get back to where i stopped awhile ago:   "no matter what i say or do, i always end up thinking about you still."   you have already gained control of my weakness. it's my feelings. and in times when you seems not to care, the pain strikes deep down my heart. sobra. i learned so many things from you, perhaps the best lesson you had taught me was to be strong. no matter what i say or do, i always end up thinking about you still. for me you will always be the best. =) alam mo naman yun eh. there are times when i really hate you for being so cruel. that's ok. my mind says it was intentional, my heart says you're just too insensitive. for me it doesn't matter wether it is intentional or insensitive. as long as you are there, i can conquer everything, i can conquer my sadness. nobody can replace the happiness you brought inside my heart. =) i'm not hoping that someday we'll have a chance to know each other better. God is good, i know it would come our way. i thought you would hold on until the day we meet... i guess i'm wrong. now, the only way to be with you is in my dreams wherein such, no reason is necessary. i miss you my friend. i miss you so much... tke cre.  -----

      We often fool ourselves And say that it's love Only cause when it's gone We end up being lonely So how are we to know That it just isn't so That we just have to let each other go  There were many times When we shared precious moments But later realized they were only stolen moments So how are we to know That it just wasn't so That we just had to let each other go  If loving you is all that means to me When being happy is all I hope you'd be Then loving you must mean I really have to set you free  Each day we meet my love for you Keeps growing stronger But everytime we meet Makes leaving you so much harder So how are we to know That this just wasn't so That we just have to let each other go  If loving you is all that means to me When being happy is all I hope you'd be Then loving you must mean I really have to set you free  Letting go is not an easy task When smiling feels like I must wear this lonely mask It hurts deep inside And I just cannot hide That there's anguish at the thought That we should have to part  If loving you is all that means to me When being happy is all I hope you'd be Then loving you must mean I really have to set you free

        "i can't see you, but i know you are here..."    it was a nice cliche from a movie i had watched before.  i forgot the title of the movie... umm. city of angels yata.  i miss my friends. those people from school and the rotc. it's been quite a long time that i haven't seen them.  yung iba may trabaho na. yung iba nag aaral parin. yung iba tambay. well that's life and they choosed to live with it. ganun talaga.     "if one day i'll be dreaming of you once again, i'll force myself to die than waking up in pain that i can't have you in reality.  i never pretended to be a somebody because since then i know i was just a nobody in your life. sometimes i asked myself, "why can't you just go away, stop reading my words and leave me alone"... though deep in my heart it means "why can't you just stay, be with me and continue our friendship..."  you are here still, i want you to know that... occupying the most special space in my heart. i used to see you, i used to stare at you... i used to have this feeling for you, that i know will never be ever change. i guess some people are really meant to be special, and in my life... you are."    i just downloaded the song  color everywhere  by youth asylum and  because i love you  by DNH. i like it.  need to go home.  -fin-

        "The topic of perfection when tackled for personal interest doesn’t always have to be very difficult to explain. Yet I can presume that perfection is just an excuse from a harsh kind of living that we encounter everyday in life where in reality, there isn’t really no perfection at all. A perfect day for me needs not to lie within the borders of material things. Since we are equating the term perfect with a positive value, we are also aiming to happiness that we can’t find with tangible objects. For me, it’s not what I do have and what I’ll be having.  It’s within what happened this day and made my day perfect. Thus, we value memories and not dates of when and what happened. It’s the simplicity of life that makes my day perfect. Nothing can beat up the experienced of sharing quality time with the person you value. And because that person to you is special, you tend to light up mentally and spiritually like thousand of bulbs beyond an abyss of darkness. Though the physical body is tired and restless, with this kind of emotional adrenalin almost anything is alive and kicking, leading to perfection. With this kind of experience nothing is needed except for the time and exchange of thoughts. I guess all of us humans will definitely agree to me with this kind of conclusion right?"    i wrote this last april for my friend's assignment. naalala ko lang...

I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (the center), not falling down (of calms within the eye) I...

"fly away on my Zephyr I feel it more then ever and in this perfect weather We'll find a place together fly on my wing"    just a quick recall of what happend few weeks back:  the seminar me and teejz conducted turned out fine. next couple of weeks and it'll be keech and psyg's turn. i had a three nights straight drinking session that week. the 6 of us was there at the meet. peter, zero, psyg, teejz, keech and me. we're planning to make profit into the drugs business.. umm.. downers to be exact. we're quite serious about it. and it'll be legal of course.

"make love not war" near common ground. umm.. the ambiance is quite good and the acoustic music is relaxing. keech just stopped blogging. well i know that would be for now pero he'll gonna come back soon. he should.

      I.   If the file is usually accessed sequentially and if the file is relatively small, then contiguous allocation should be used. If the file is usually accessed sequentially or randomly and is large, indexed allocation should be used. If the file is usually accessed sequentially and not randomly and the fiel is large, link allocation should be used.  II.  Cache improves performance by powering space or time locality of the application   or system that is being used. Creating a small cache will considerably improve the performance but the hit rate grows slower and slower as the size increases. Additional, file buffer cache competes with virtual machines. The decrease of the amount of memory available for processes is the result of increasing the file buffer cache.   III.  A RAM (Reformed Armed-Forces Movement) is a file system that completely resides in memory. With this, buffering of files is much faster. RAM disk is also a user programmable disk cache and classified as a complete temporary storage. RAM disk also allows programs to write applications using their familiar file I/O and memory controls. One good example is mounting a bootstrap file system in RAM disk while installing the OS.

         When I fall in love I take my time There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why Because...    after arriving yesterday me and my colleague went to g4 to buy something. i was too tired.   i immediately sleep right after taking dinner. at last my nostalgic week is finally over...     the remedy is the experience. this is a dangerous liaison I says the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words I said the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on So shine the light on all of your friends when it all amounts to nothing in the end.    nothing much about this day. just blogged hop and commented out on some people. don't even have any plans to gimmick tomm night. i still need to accomplish lots of things in mind, as well as my detailed plan this coming december (hope i still have my job).  having a jobless christmas is too pathetic.  darn i miss u...  hope u know who u are....     I wont worry my life away.yeah oh oh... I wont worry my life away.yeah oh oh...     -fin-

      this is my 6th or 7th yata.. yeah 6th day to be here at sarrat, ilocos norte. i'll be leaving here thursday or friday i think. still tentative. it was very cold last night. after talking with  urlLink ana  (a new sister like online buddy), i ate dinner and went to the terrace for an hour to unwind and see the sky.  the stars seems to smile at me while i was staring at them. the leaves of the mango tree falls down as the wind blows. the sound of silence is like a devastating bomb that was dropped inside my body. after few more minutes i received a txt msg from a friend. i replied my last load and went to sleep.  i dreamed. and yeah it was in full color pare... very realistic. i saw myself sitting in my bed at home and lying my back against the wall. i was holding her picture, staring at it.. staring at her eyes to be exact while i was listening to this mellow music. i grabbed the phone beside me and dialed her number. i rang it trice to dropped a call and suddenly, tears began to flow in my eyes. i put down the phone, hugged her picture and utter the words "i missed you..." then i cried myself to sleep. it was very clear, as if i was watching a dvd movie. few seconds later the door in my room opened. it was her. she sat beside my bed looking at me... pouted and said "i miss you too, but i hate you. you're too good for me. i'm always been bad at you." she held my hand, held it tight... and right in the middle of my sleep reality cut my delusion. i woke up in darkness and checked my phone, it was 11:30 PM. no missed calls, no dialed numbers and yeah no credits left. naalala ko, i texted the last peso to ana nga pala right before i went to sleep so it was very impossible for me to drop a call.  my dream last night will be the most memorable of all since the day that i existed in this world. how i wish my thoughts could reach her, let her know how much i miss her, let her know how much i do care for her, let her know how much i think about her and her health and all that shit that matters. no this isn't an obsession. this is a very sincere feeling... only for the person so special.  how i wish ...  how i wish my dream last night was true.  -fin-

      playing: gin blossoms - follow you down | congratulations i'm sorry  i don't know why i was very happy last friday. it seems that God was too good to me and shared some blessings. i started right and everything right seemed to follow that whole day.   my boss (our sys ad) upgraded my testbed in the ofice from 98 to 2k so i could run iis (it's my only way of running asp script eh'). need to study the  web based implementation of this  urlLink sap  thingi'.  the hell. he don't gave me the admin pass.      i said: "nyek. pano ko mag iinstall nyan eh dami ko gusto install ser. tangina naman ser oh. sabihin niyo na sakin yung pass =(" he said: "hehe. tawagin moko kung gusto mo mag install".    f%ck. kailangan ko pa mag paalam para maka install sa sarili kong pc, pero because i have a very big respect on this guy (my boss)     sabi ko: "ser magagalit ba kayo pag nakapag install ako ng di nag papaalam?" sabi nya: "hehe. ikaw bahala. kung kaya mo ba eh. cge crack mo."     i get it. he's trying to test me. =) now i need to think back on those days again, how we're getting local and remote access, blowing up and screwing pc's across the net before together with  urlLink dcoder ,  urlLink keech  and the whole  urlLink gang . i even forgot na about this windows sam file thing'.  darn. after merienda punta sya sa pwesto ko      sabi nya: "ano na pasok mo na?"  sabi ko: "tsk. di pa ser eh. hirap. teka reboot ko lang."  sabi nya: "hehe. ala... kala ko pa naman matinik kana. oh, tangna nakuha mo na pala eh."      (he said it after he saw his pic on the win2k boot logo).  =)  another thing, my officemate asked me if i were late or not.sabi ko 6 minutes lang. sabi niya wag na daw ako papalate at baka daw mahanapan ako ng butas. my boss told her daw na they won't put me down though there are some people that are planning something to expel me.  thank God there are still good people who cares.  =)  after 6 pm i asked 3 of my colleagues if they can accompany me to glorietta. i'm experiencing a blurry vision sometimes and i need to have my eyes check-up. we went to "the optical shop". this _cute_ optometrist told me to fill-up the form. eh because i did not read it first na it's written pala, LASTNAME  first. i wrote my whole name on the last name section. sabi ko "ayy sorry." (tatanga tanga na naman ako)     sabi nya: "k lang. ano papa check up mo." (syempre mata) sabi ko: "kse i'm having a blurry vision minsan eh tagal ko na di nag sasalamin pero since grade 3 nka salamin nako. eh ayun..." sabi nya: "ic. may dala kba salamin mo dati?" sabi ko: "ayy ala eh. umm.. nawala eyeglasses ko before tapos mula non d nako nagpa refract ulit."     she told me to sit down infront of a computer thing and checked my eyes. i was looking inside this tube wherein you can see a very very far windmill with fences. tapos we went to her office and checked my eyes ulit kaso manual na. yung may letters na paliit nang paliit.     sabi nya: "eh wala nman pala problema mata mo eh.. normal naman. 20/20. astigmatism lang yan. ikaw ano papatuloy mo pa ba toh? wag nalang. sayang naman." sabi ko: "eh ano... eh.. o cge normal naman pala d nalang." sabi nya: "la naman problem eh. cge na nga wag kana mag consultation fee."     (naka libre pako)     sabi ko: "by the way i'm ___"  she smiled and said: "i'm jack"  we shaked hands then sabi ko: "nice meeting you. cge thanks jack."  sabi niya: "k lang. wala naman problema eh."     cute talaga ni jack. lol.   =)  pag alis namin don punta kami kfc. since it was payday i treat my 3 other colleagues dinner. we talked about our jobs and all sort of things about it. some past issues, umm.. at kung ano ano pa.  still don't know what made me soooo happpyyy last friday. maybe   someone   from heaven   sent   me a goodluck charm that morning. umm... i don't think so.  because for me...  she's a good luck charm herself.  =)     "i can be blind and can't see you smiling once you read my words.. =D i can be deaf and can't hear you laughing once you see me funny.. =p i can pretend that i don't misses you at all =/ pero still deep inside my soul, you're the only person who can always brighten up my cloudy day. =) thank you inspiring me. you know who you are. always  tke cre .

      i opened my black box, it contains all the things that was given to me by  urlLink apol  before. i saw those faber-castell colored pencils and pentel pens, together with the oslo paper. she gave it to me as a gift, alam niya kse mahilig ako mag drawing. i never had the chance to use it naman dati, too busy at work and stuffs. eh the other day when i saw it i asked myself: "umm.. marunong pa kaya ako?" the last time kase eh medyo matagal na.. way back 1999. i never held a pencil nymore since then.  so i decided to try if i can still draw or not. here are the results:       draw this last wednesday night. she's a fictional character from the anime gundam wing after colony.       draw this one here at work. wala ako magawa eh inaayos yung pc ko. i colored it last saturday sa rp-manila (foodcourt) while taking a glass of mais-con-yelo (alone).  bakit puro girl? d naman ako manyakis. the reason bakit puro girl yung drawing ko ngayon eh mas nahihirapan kse ako mag drawing ng girl na anime. i'm having a hard time drawing lalo na yung arms and legs. d ko ma perfect yung curve and minsan pag mali nde na proportion yung body =(  -fin-

       to you whom i love most...  the dream is finally over. songs have come to an end. poems will rhyme no more. now the only thing i can do is to accept that i have been defeated by my own paranoia. it was a very close fight between dream and reality, that from the very start i already knew... winning is next to impossible. i should have known, but i was such a fool. now it'll be hard for me to look back on those days, how we used to enjoy each others company, how we used to bind together against our different time, how we used to taught each other's lessons in the absence of physical structure. yes i'm too far, yet you can't deny the fact that i have touched you, in a manner that nobody else can... not even the guy whom you're sharing the night in bed at this moment. with due respect to what i call sincerity... i touched your heart. now, in a few minutes tears will again began to flow in my eyes. i can't help it. how i wish these tears can wash away the thoughts of you. i know... it can't. now  that you are already behind enemy lines, our friendship will never be the same as before. i'll keep it frozen forever. life is accompanied with so many experiments that sometimes it ends up either the good thing or the bad thing. i do hope you'll be smart enough to choose what you should, not what something or someone urges you. if experience is the best reward for human curiosity, congratulations. you have just been rewarded... please let this not blind you for what wisdom there is. i want them to know that my respect for you will always be as high as the clouds no matter what you do. i know you are happy to be with him. i want you to know that i'm happy for you too... you know i'll always be. i hope he can love you more, serve you more and protect you more physically... something i know the Gods wouldn't allow me to. he's very lucky to have you... to have the girl whom i used to share moments only in my dreams. in this world, chances are given randomly. if the deity will gave us the chance to know each other well enough one day, i hope you'll also consider to accept it. i may not be there anymore where we used to be like before, but still i want you to know... when the sky is dark and everybody seems not to care, i'm just here. 12 numbers away... 21 letters to stay:  i will always care for you  ...  goodbye my friend. i have just woke up. yes, it's over.

      happy birthday ana!!!  my friend psyg saved me from complete chaos. i'm already fucked up learning the how-to's of setting up dns and mail server so he configured ours for me. (it's free. hehe) after some discussions it turned out that my boss have been infected by what we call the BSD syndrome (initial state of paranoia. hehe). he also like teejz idea of eliminating ms office here in the office using open office instead. (hehe)   thanks pare.  we've got 2 vacant ip's left and I'll be practicing those things he taught me for the whole week. nothing unusual happened aside from that. always busy (busy nga ba?) or just trying to keep busy rather. just like what somebody always say's:  "same ol same ol parin..."   i woke up this morning with a numeric message on my phone. still can't figure out what does that mean. I think I'm beginning to be completely dense. haayy... kung alam mo lang pare ko... kung alam mo lang...  right time right place, not now not tomorrow not today... someday pare. someday...  alis nako. d2 na si boss.

I've got to be honest I think you know We're covered in lies and that's OK There's somewhere beyond this I know But I hope I can find the words to say  Never again no No never again  [Chorus] 'Cause you're a god And I am not And I just thought That you would know You're a god And I am not And I just thought I'd let you go  But I've been unable To put you down I'm still learning things I ought to know by now It's under the table so I need something more to show somehow  Never again no No never again  [Chorus]  I've got to be honest I think you know We're covered in lies and that's OK There's somewhere beyond this I know But I hope I can find the words to say Never again no No never again

      nothing unusual. i woke up early. got to finish my report for this day. i'm almost done doing the first part and now i'm starting with the second part of it.   majority of the blogs i read this morning are all senti mode. most people finds and uses medium that can help them release the pain from an emotional attachment or tension. its a known fact though.  filipinos are known to be romantic... one good thing about us.  i got my new pair of glasses at r.p manila last saturday.  my vision is quite fine now compared of before.  i visited my friend revoj yesterday naman sa shop niya. lots of people eventhough its a sunday afternoon.  mostly students who are living in dormitories and apartments studying in the nearby university belt.  suddenly mayan and blez arrived. i was supposed to treat them. (napasubo ako ah) the three of us went at kfc. buti nalang i still got 380 pesos left in my wallet. i was counting  how much would be the bill in my head while mayan was ordering the food with me. (thank God sumakto.)   it costs me 305.00 =)  mayan was silent. lagi naman siya tahimik everytime we had a gmmick, meet or something. she'll just speak to me when she has to say something important, otherwise she'll never talk with me at all.  minsan ok naman siya. she even called last week here at the office and chatted with me.  pero pag magkasama kami minsan lang magsalita. maybe its an after effect when i almost courted her last january.  she hates it when i'm shouting. pauwi na kami when i said: "lika na lika na.. bagal bagal. tsk."  "bat sinisigawan moko?!?" sabi niya. "d kita sinisigawan, langya di kana nasanay sakin eh..." sabi ko.  thats all for now. need to click the button and start working.   by the way, congratulations. for me you will always be the best. i bet you pretty know who you are.

      ' wanted to thank all those people who visited and tagged along...    "Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are  I had to find you Tell you I need you Tell you I set you apart  Tell me your secrets And ask me you questions Oh let's go back to the start  Running in circles Coming in tales Heads are a science apart"    haven't opened my blog for almost a week as usual. i just broke my "NO BEER UNTIL NEXT YEAR" policy. i almost forgot it was octoberfest nga pala. the price of beer at "chicharitos"  (the place here in magallanes where me and my colleagues used to hang out after work)  deppriciated from 25 to 17 pesos per bottle. sagot ni sir. sabi nga ng isang free newspaper "the best things in life are libre" (hehe).     "Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard  Oh take me back to the start"    that was on a tuesday night.  friday night comes. it was another senior colleague's treat. we went to bargo (few steps away from common ground). it was my first time to be there though. i found the place quite ok. the ambiance seems to be ok. i just don't like their vip rooms (vip rooms ba tawag don?) umm'.. i think i got the wrong term.. ohh i got it. ktv room pala (hehe..) the dining and the outside plus the service seems to be fine. the ktv part seems not. maybe ktv isn't their specialty.    "I was just guessing At numbers and figures Pulling your puzzles apart  Questions of science Science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart"    dipa don natapos. after saying goodbye's and thank you's to my boss' and the other 40 somethings, me and the other 20 somethings walked looking for another hop. since full na daw sa tia m, we end up ordering 5 bottles of smb lights at arkdia. they're jamming with the crowd when i was busy talking with 2 sisters on a table beside ours.  that was on a friday night up to saturday morning.  i woke up 10 am wherein i should supposedly be there at work around 9. i arrived at the office at 2 pm. finished a module around 6:30 and left there by 9 pm. slept around 11, had lots of dreams until 3 pm (i even dreamed of a grade school classmate named joerela) hmm... bakit kaya?    "Tell me you love me Come back and haunt me Oh and I rush to the start  Running in circles Chasing tails And coming back as we are"    right now i'm listening at  coldplay's scientist , few minutes ago i was staring on a national bookstore baggage number. pretending it was losts, i paid 50 pesos for it... just to have that thing tagged 21.  i wanted to write something about these midnight religious battles on tv kya lang i'm lazy right now. maybe next week perhaps...  ' need to wake up early. take care all and tke cre ü.    "Nobody said it was easy Oh it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard  I'm going back to the start"

      i was sooo preoccupied this past weeks. well guess what? i'm doing fine at work (ahemm..) hehe. this must be a good start for the coming year. my boss have already written down my projects from 1st to 4th quarter. thank God really i was able to do well... the only problem with me is what else? umm... not new. it's my usual tardiness. i received a "love note" last week coming from my boss, i saw it posted in my monitor right after merienda, stating: "***e, try to follow the regular work/office schedule." mahh bad   it's already 12:07 am. i should be sleeping now pero i can't sleep. yesterday (saturday) i was trying to make a move with this girl from the office. (parang gago noh?) i always tell to myself "tangina pare kaya mo yan" but then again (boinnggg) ... i can't. i'm born torpe eh'.  weh'...  that girl used to be my crush for almost a week now, she's from HRD, a newly hired newly grad yata'. everytime we cross path and she looks at me, i lower my head (as if i was melting like ice) arrgghhh.. i hate it. my co-dept already knew about this. last week her mouse ain't working and my colleague was teasing me to change it. i almost told them: "pano ko papalitan yung mouse? ano gagawin ko hoy?" wahihihihi... my co-dept's answer makes me laugh everytime i'm being reminded of that funny remark she said: "Dyos ko naman, ikabit mo lang yung mouse tapos sabihin mo don, don sa batang maputi nayon' "alam mo hindi kapa pinapanganak mahal na kita.."" (batang maputi amp.) lol. well i don't have plans of courting, i'm just trying to be friendly.  daw...  i woke up this morning with a message in my phone from an old friend i used to love: "Te hice sentir especial. Gracias" it's in spanish right? umm... the only words i can understand was especial and gracias. can somebody please translate to me these words... please. or maybe i should try using  urlLink babelfish .  i've got the perfect solution for those people who wishes to stop masturbation. try my mantra... say this every morning, everytime you're taking a bath or at bed before sleeping (well everytime you're horny). say these words repeatedly, slowly: "to masturbate is to worship the devil..." "to masturbate is to worship the devil..." you shoud be losing your urge for quite awhile, feeling you're between the battle of good or evil. now put your wrists behind your head then repeat those words again: "to masturbate is to worship the devil..." repeat it until you completely lost the urge.  well it worked for me. i bet it'll work for you too. ;)  next week i'll tackle a "celebrity deathmatch" between two religions. cheers for now.

        listening to: down with the sickness - disturbed    i'm quite in a hurry so don't have time to double check this out. please excuse some of my spellings and explicit words. thanks.    "Oh Shit Ooo-Ahahah, Ooo-ahahahah Drowning deep in my see of loathing Broken your servant I kneel Can you give it to me It seems what's left of my human side is changing Can you give it to me Is slowly changing in me"    i don't have grudges or anything bad about these 2 religious groups but i think they should start closing their tv programs because they're pissing everybody off. these are the "ang dating daan" and "ang tamang daan" tv programs that are aired every night. for those of you who belong to one of those i mentioned, please don't take any of the following words you'll begin to read personally. i'm sure anyone who will find these true well get pissed. these are mere products of my dick brain.. oopss, thick i mean.    "Looking at my own reflection When suddenly it changes Violently it changes I know, there is no turning back now You've woken up the demon in me"    if you're not quite into bible discussions and will watch for the first time how "ely soriano" preaches the word of "his God" then i'm pretty sure you'll be amazed. if you'll be able to watch "ang tamang daan" by "bro. michael" et. al. you'll get to experienced the same thing. i consider these people as talented, well versed and scholars in their chosen field. i never wanted to argue with them about my own religious belief coz' it'll be a total hell. yet preaching the word of God in their tv programs are completely senseless. apparently senseless in a point wherein the only objective of the show is to inflict a bad reputation to the other party. (perhaps spreading the words of their God was next to it). these people playing protagonist in the field of evangelical dissemination doesn't shed light on the facts that they should be. do you think God would be happy knowing people are uttering offensive remarks to each other because of him? well i don't think so. does it mean that if i can memorized and interpret every single words and period of the bible, i'm the best? i'm the scholar? i'm the chosen one? and yeah i can start my own religion? so whats next? aha! buying my own tv station and starting my own tv show together with my zombies (good idea). influencing others with my sweet tongue. preaching that i'm the one, the one chosen by God to spread his message. and then what's next? starting rivalry with other religious groups about my belief, about what is good and bad, about their own teachings etc. and then after that? people from politics would soon approach me for a religious endorsement, that whatsoever words comes out of my mouth comes from the mouth of God.  sick people.    "Chorus: Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Open up your hate and let it flow into me Get down come on get down with the sickness You mother get down come on get down with the sickness You fucker get down come on get down with the sickness Madness is the gift that has been given to me"    the bible is a compilation of God's words documented by those people who have experienced being with him in flesh, in faith and in doctrines. it was created by humans in Gods name, perhaps the reason why people has different interpretations. it should serve a special purpose, re-uniting people. showing that even though we have different understanding about his word, let us not forget that there is only one true God. the one who created this universe, the one who created us all. it doesn't mean that if i do not belong to your church, i won't be saved when the judgement day comes. nobody has the right to question once faith, only God. your God is also my God, so what's your problem? born again christians don't believe in saints, so what? moslems believe in Allah. so what? roman catholics believes in mama Mary, so what? mayor sanches once said he was a mama Mary devotee, but after pleading guilty to the rape and killing of the up lost banos student he did a dirty finger and shouted "putangina ninyo" on philippine television. not because you're good in persuading people  with your crap you can save me from my sins. Jesus in his time also fought false prophets, but he never uttered any inflicting remarks. it was his pure intention to speak the words of his father that lead people persuasively.    "I can see inside you the sickness is rising Don't try to deny what you feel It seems that all that was good has died And is decaying in me    filipinos are known to be religious. perhaps the effects of foreign colonization can be considered as one of the principal reasons why faith plays a very important role in this country. religions should help and inspires us in strenghtening our faith with God without the need to hate others who have different beliefs. want to know my christmas wish? watching  bro. jocel (ely's alalay) from dating daan and bro. michael from iglesia featured in mtv's celebrity deathmatch. what do you think huh?    "It seems you're having some trouble In dealing with these changes Living with these changes The world is a scary place Now that you've woken up the demon in me"    i guess these religious leaders should try eating their own dog foods. start practicing what they preach. well these are my opinions, i'm not judging anyone or anything nor i'm  playing wise... these are purely point of views.  umm... perhaps that's my final word for now.  until next week.    "Chorus: Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Open up your hate and let it flow into me Get down come on get down with the sickness You mother get down come on get down with the sickness You fucker get down come on get down with the sickness Madness is the gift that has been given to me

         "That which does not kill me makes me stronger."  --Friedrich Nietzche--    It was 6:30 last Friday, I was quite concentrating performing my work, finishing documentations and monitoring bandwidth. Sir Kicks told me that we need to talk. Suddenly, he told Sir Joey to go out of the server room for a while. It was very indifferent. I immediately catch his drift; I know it has something to do with my employment status.  I was right. It was my last day working with them.  As I read the memo my brain cells stopped working for a minute or two. I wanted to shed a single tear but I know it'll only make me feel less. I talked with my boss, faced him bravely enough to accept it. He said his sorry although there's no need for him to say so. I know he was defending me from the very start that all those false accusation are being thrown over me. All of them (the team) have been very supportive. I caught myself between the words "thank you" and "I'm sorry". Thank you for giving me the chance working with such professionals, I'm sorry if I have failed meeting his expectations. I don't know how I will tell it to him.   He told me to seek legal advice and talk with my accusers regarding that false accusation to clear my name. I thought of it at first but then I realized a day after that it was too late and I won't need it anymore. Case closed. Besides, talking with "Ricky" is like kissing a dog's ass; I won't care to kiss a dog's ass just to retain my job. It'll definitely lessen my morale. I can stand up for what I know is right and I can defend myself without any legal advises. Legalities and technicalities of the law are only for people with fear of losing. Their lost of confidence to a certain issue tends them to seek higher knowledge. I don't need higher knowledge to save myself. As long as I did not do anything wrong I don't care what other people would think of me. It's just that some people are unfair enough. They have been very subjective and judgmental about the matter. Maybe fear must have also conquered them the first time I wrote my correspondence. They never gave me the chance to speak out, they never let me faced my accusers, they never showed any benefit of the doubt and then I'll received this memo that they have found me guilty?  Hence it was really an  "ouch"  to be stabbed from behind but what hurt me most is that the fact that I have learned to treat the MIS team as a second family. The bonding was so strong. I love my job. I have been very dedicated to it through all those months kahit I have this  "tardi-sickness" , from thinking about tomorrow's tasks before going to sleep to carrying and doing my job at home. I don't even had time going online talking with my underground friends or those personal ones. I knew it's not only me who will going to earn pogi points once I finish my tasks but the whole team. The reason why I always put the word "TEAM" in every task I do. For me, dedication is not counted by long hours of work. It is measured by a person's willingness to perform tasks with accuracy against all the intellectual and physical challenges he might encounter.   All of them are team players. It was really an unforgettable experienced working with such good people.  I smiled, surrendered my I.D, we went out of the server room and I started packing my stuffs. I even forgot my digicam's USB cable. Sir Joey was asking me what we have talked. He has this bad intuition. I told him it was  "confidential" , good news and a bad news. He said  "tangina kinakabahan ako ah"  :) I pretend to be completely oblivious about it.  We went to chicharitos and had some drink although we're quite incomplete. After that, Sir Dan, Sir Joey, Jonathan and me took a cab while Judith, Jen, Oliver and Sir Kim joined Roman in his toy car. We went to Bay Walk. Jonathan was advising me how to make a move on Tin-Tin, I just can't tell him that moment it'll be the last time I'll be able to see that girl :)   After consuming few beers we walked and went to that acoustic place in Malate. That was the last hop. After in which Sir Joey reminded me about what we have talked a while ago. I don't want to speak up but because it'll be my last time I said my farewell.   Surely God has better plans regarding this. I dunno what'll happen next. Either I'll be working with the same job in the next few months or continue studying.  For now, I'm a total bum.  Hayyy... It's already 2:30 in the morning. I need to get myself some sleep. Gonna finish watching Smallville cd's tomorrow.      "Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are; your reputation is merely what others think you are.

      the year 2003 in my life was quite a pretty year. full of action, comedy, inspiration, sex (no violence) and dramatic moments (well i don't consider being jobless as dramatic though). i learned to blog, i got a good job, i lost a precious friend, i learned complex tech stuffs, i got one-night stands, i've been drunk as hell, i met few good people and i believed that still, God have been always there for me.  2004 na. year of the monkey daw ngayon. it's  my year. no! no! errr... i'm not saying that i'm a monkey nor i look like one, what i mean is that i was born on the year of the monkey. =) ok?   sweswertehin kaya ako? humm.. ano sa palagay mo? palagay ko... dapat lang. saan kaya ako pupulutin? wag naman sana sa kangkungan. magsulat nalang kaya ako ng comics or ng libro ng mga bata. humm.. pero ano naman susulat ko? hindi bagay sakin yon.   well let me tell you something about me being a blogger. i had this passion for writing since i was a kid. the person that first inspired me to released my innermost writing abilities was my ex girlfriend whom was at that time taking up creative writing at admu.   it was way back march 2003 when keech introduced me to the world of blogging. since then i had the chance to post in those "words left unspoken" and songs left unsung. it gave me the feeling of freedom from sudden outburst of manic depressions, inferiority complex, pessimisms and apathy.   ok ok. stop muna tayo dyan. lumalalim na eh.  anngggg taggaaallll ng foonneee koo... i need to get online here at home or else i'll be completely insane. i invested most of my remaining allowance in books and stuffs. well ok na yun kesa uminom ako every other day. besides, i told mom i could use it naman eh.       nde nako nakabili ng printer coz' i got this 40gb 5400rpm Maxtor hard drive. it cost me 3.4k mura naba yon? the book on the lower right entitled "the witch of the blackbird pond" is not included in my expenses. actually it was a book of my ex.      i also got myself a new bag. nde' ko napagsawaan yung old bag given to me by apple. my sister brought it when she left. pinaglagyan ng gift ko kay laarni last december 2002. umm... speaking of laarni, haven't talked to her for almost 4 months now. i really miss that girl so much. ano na kaya nangyari dun sa friend ko nayon'?      went to tagaytay last christmas. namasyal, kumain at nag alaga ng bata. tapos kumain sa mushroom burger. it was my first time eating there. at first i thought kuya was joking telling me i was eating a burger made from mushroom. it was quite odd though. how did they turned the mushroom (a plant) to a burger (a meat)? it's like turning an ampalaya to a tuna. tangina sabi ko. ibang klase na nagagawa ng sciencia ngayon. yun pala yung burger is not pure burger 'nymore they have mixed the mushroom with it.  now i'm here inside my room. i'm playing with my toy =) no! no! i'm not masturbating you idiot! i'm fond of reading these books i bought and playing with my hard drives. the 40gig was syempre' for windows (that is because my souncard isn't supported), the 8gig for FreeBSD and the 2gig from teejay for linux.  now i can start practicing some of norberts lessons. all i need now is an internet connection to start driving these things to hell.  so much for that.

      After few months of undesirable events in my life now I’m back. So what made me think to get online and start writing these pointless, senseless stories about me again? Well, nothing really special. I just miss blogging. Sometimes I need to feed this tiny little brain of mine and the only way that would let me satisfy these thoughts is to blog (well, just one method how to intellectually masturbate.)  I’ve got a new job with the same rate. Lots of people told me “pare bat d ka mag abroad?” My usual answer is “nde pa pwede eh”. I think my skills aren’t enough for a tough competition abroad. I was invited few weeks ago by my former boss to coach their new web developer. I asked him: “pare magkano starting mo?” He said: “Sir …” (after hearing his answer) I joked: “tangina mataas pa starting mo sakin ahh.. nde na kita tuturuan!”. Sabi niya: “Sir naman…” Well I was just joking about it. Naisip ko din: “onga pala.. last year payon and this is a different year.” Sometimes I used to think that time is moving too fast. I’m 23 and now I’m turning 24 and next year what? Yeah I need to look for a brighter perspective abroad or else…  No girlfriend still. Tagal tagal na din… 2 years ba? umm.. nope its 1 year and 8 months pala. That was August 2002 eh. Did I computed it right? After some harsh and traumatic experiences I think it’ll be better to wait for the right person. Well it’s not about having a no choice but an opportunity to make intelligent choices rather. Besides, I do have a prospect.   So what about her? I met her at work. She’s a colleague from another department (again). We’ve been dating a couple of times and I have already told her what my real feelings are. Well, still no violent reactions as of now. kidding aside, I like her. She’s the typical "saint" type. Not too pretty and not too smart (sophisticated types already brought paranoia to me). There’s one characteristic I do admire her most, her being close to God.  Very rare that we argue about religion though we have different spiritual beliefs. I guess that is also one of the many reasons why I like her. Well, still a long way to go. Besides, I think I’m moving too fast. I just started to work there 2 months or less and we’ve dated a couple of times and kissed her a couple of times. Hanggang dun lang. Kisses with sincerity. Besides, I wouldn’t care to take advantage even if I got the opportunity. I do respect her still.    It’s already 7 o’clock. One year na pala ko (pass the skyflakes and break my leg II). Thanks to all the visitors and referrers of my senseless blog.  Out muna ko. See you again maybe umm… after 3 months ulit?  Bye.

      It was 1986 or 87 I think when I was fascinated by a movie entitled “Prime Risk”. The movie was about a couple that forges ATM cards and uses it to commit hi-tech robbery. It also shows how they outsmarted a syndicate engage in the same crime. Since then my passion and curiosity to know more about the technology and hi-tech stuffs started.  I was in my near 2nd year high school when I first encountered a personal computer at school. I grew up as an antisocial kid and was raised by a simple family. I know that the stuff was very expensive and they won’t care to give me such thing at that time.  The first pc game I played was scorch earth in a 14” sampo paper white monitor, which is next to my favorite: “Where in the World is Carmen San Diego”. The first OS I learned was no other than MS-DOS, the first program I wrote was in batch file and the first executable program I compiled successfully was in turbo basic. Few months later I learned more complex stuffs like pascal and started playing low level at debug. My first mentor at that time was a 4th yr. comsci student from Adamson whom is fond of assembly language. My 1st lesson about this guy is about “registers” which I then used to break password-protected units in the computer laboratory of our gay instructor (yeah he’s a gay). My interest regarding the subject matter expanded and later on…  Computer lessons became totally boring to me on my 4th year high school. I wanted to learn and to share more but I know I can’t get what I really wanted to learn at school. I started reading more books and other references.  The 1st school I attended college was a total hell. I took up a computer science course and there was no programming subjects. It was written on their curriculum that programming would start in 2nd year second semester. That made my life bored and concentrated more on extra curricular. At that time I was already thinking if there are schools out there that includes Unix in their curriculum. Since I can’t find any info I just bought some books (and lived theoretically).  My 1st pc was a primitive 2nd hand i386 Silicon Valley with a 50MB hardrive, 8MB RAM, a 14” colored monitor and a CPU weighing 50 lbs. It runs in DOS (I have improved playing “Carmen San Diego” because of this pc). After 6 or 8 months it died.  I took up a 2 yr. course on what they say, “Asia’s largest and pioneer in I.T based education” (eoww! Talaga lang ha?) but umm… I quite learned better stuffs in them though than the latter one.  My first Linux was a floppy based distro (Trinux) and then a RedHat 6.1 (Cartman I think). I bought it from somebody who’s selling Cd’s at IRC. Then I bought some “How-To” books. Well it was quite odd at first because I don’t have any idea how to run the thing.  My informal lessons on how to crash a system began when I met a friend from IRC named “dcoder”. The first .ph website I have browsed in was “findme” (a site giving commercial GPS services). Jay taught me the basics and how to be a badass jerk inside a penetrated network. From the Unicode era wherein IIS servers are being fuck up, the adrenalin rush grew even more not realizing the damages. Since then the evilness draw more and started defacing websites from Microsoft vulnerable servers to different vulnerable Unix/Linux platforms. Those accounts were used to scan and crack more systems, install sniffers, keyloggers, bnc’s, eggdrops, LKM’s, dump sites, possible zombie for DDoS or if it is a merchant site, then carding. The group was highlighted in the year 2001 – 2002 where I became one of those total “.ph dot slasher”.  If Jay taught me the offensive and dark side, another orgmate inspired me to switched and improve more in the defensive and the good side. It was “keech” (Maybe that’s the reason why I haven’t seen him deface a website since then hehe). He’s more of an innovator and inspired me to grow “mature” and not to live a “dot slashing” career forever.  After few more months of E.B’s I began to meet those other “elite” individuals aside from keech. Most of them are undergrads that have been very kind in sharing what they know. Then we’re sharing about more in depth security and administration, not just dot slashing. I wouldn’t pursue to learn and strive more on the good side without the help of these guys from the underground. They’re the best.  It was 2 months ago when I got too curious to commit credit card fraud (scamming). I have tried ordering goods online (ebay) and started paying it with "stolen" paypal accounts, shipped it here in .ph thru UPS and claiming it using a fake ID.  I’m getting gadgets with the expense of other people and I don’t like it, especially when my inbox is bombard with insulting e-mails:    "wrote: Kung akala mo naloko mo na kami kasi nasa america kami..well you're wrong! Isoli mo nalang yung phone ko o magbayad kayo., nakakahiya ka..Alam mo nung tumawag kami sa EBAY sabi pa..Philippines is a very dangerous country! Iam so embarass kasi Pilipino ako!!! and sana hindi ko nalang sayo binenta yung phone..."    I never thought that I have victimized a filipina. And that made me feel less and degraded. I know that it was sick but that’s the only thing I know to satisfy my curiosity. I’d like to try an online money transfer at that time but I think that would be too pathetic and besides, I don’t know how the process works (nobody would like to get jailed anyway right?). There came a time when I was spending almost 300$ a day for a video chat session. A camgirl wonders and suddenly asked me this kind of  urlLink  question  .  Right after the 4th successful shipment I stopped. I have satisfied my curiosity and decided not to have a lifestyle of luxury with a lifetime in hell. The underground scene is truly a matter of trust relationship. I’d like to thank those people who influenced me both good and bad. Well, maybe one of them was you...  Thanks for all =)

         Pagod na pagod ako last night. As in para akong sabog sa loob ng room ko. Napagalitan pako ng mama ko dahil akala niya nde ko ginawa yung pinapagawa niya. Nagising ako ng 1 am dahil sa sermon at nakatulog din agad dahil sa sermon.  I arrived 10 pm in the office. That means I am an hour late. And that means an additional time for my pending suspensions or possible termination or end of contract. That means an added extra page for my 201 file.

      It’s been 4 months since my last post. Well let’s say that I’ve been very busy with life changing moments. Syempre both good and bad. Namiss ko mag blog. Namiss ko magbasa ng mga post, namiss ko yung mga kwento sa buhay ng iba. Hehehe… well honestly on that particular period of time in the center of love and hate, I have lost my passion in writing and right now medyo inaantok pako at wala ako sa sarili dito sa office. Well this is not about lovelife, puyat lang ako. Nagising ako 8 wherein I supposed to wake up at 6 because my work starts at 9. Because of these big eye bugs na namamaga kanina pang madaling araw eh napa punta ako sa 7 11. bago pumasok. nawala kase yung sunglasses ko and wala nako choice, kelangan ko bilin yung jollogs na sunglasses sa 7 11 para masuot ko at wag ako mapagkamalan nag drudrugs.  ganda ng porma ko! naka all black and nka redish sunglasses. pwedeng pwede na sa quiapo.  sisimulan ko na ang aking 1st entry for the month of august:  The 1st winter breeze struck me right in the midst of the spring season. It was april I think when me and joy (the girl I met in the office few months ago) had been super close to the maxx that led us to cross beyond the boundaries of friendship. Ang masama non, kung gaano ako kabilis dumiskarte, ganon din kabilis nag end up yung feelings nya. Well it was few weeks before my birthday. Ngayon me bago nang sumusundo sa kanya and I don’t give a damn. It’s just that sometimes I used to get pissed off by some officemates who thinks na “busted” ako wherein the first place I am not. I never courted her because at that time I don’t even need to court her anymore. Pero syempre, I need to get my feet on the ground and start keeping quiet than bragging about things that happened between us for her good sake. I don’t need to bother myself with their speculations because I’m already happy about what I am right now. “He” knew it =)  Yeah sad story but happy ending still. Not because we ended up lovers because we never did, it’s because she’s a very God-fearing lady and because of that I learned so many things in life, which I am quite applying up to now.  Ok na din yon. I learned my lesson it’s almost like second nature for us to want something that we don’t have, sometimes we get too focus on getting that something and we tend to ignore those things that are lying around in the open. The scary part is getting what we thought we always wanted and in the end realizing that it is not what we really want after all. I don’t want to waste my time for a person unworthy of my love. It’s a sad thing that we’re having problems finding the right person because we’re too busy making the wrong person right for us.  Cge mamya nalang ulit. Mukhang ginaganahan nako mag blog ulit ah’..
