      Blech. I think I'm sick. And what's worse, I had to go into the Market today. It was really bad in the morning, but it seemed to improve through the day. It's some kind of cold or something. Which is weird because it's not the least bit cold outside. But anyways, about the Market. Today was my second day on the job, as I do it every Wednesday. Like last time, I help set up my dad's plant's, sold stuff, talked to the crazy city people, and packed up. Then we went to Gritty's (that bar that my dad goes to), and my sister met us there (because she wanted to). Sooo my sister and I walked around. I went to that comic store I was looking for last week with little thanks to the directions I got from MapQuest (COMPLETELY WRONG). It was pretty damn pwnful. Wall-to-wall comics, it's a comic nerd's dream. :) Much better than the one in Saco that NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. Jerks. So then my sister dragged me to some jewelry store. But redeemed herself by buying me ice cream! Yay! Once again, I'm damned exhausted (and sick), but I'mma stay up and read those comics I bought. Whee! *collapses*

      Ian's mom had to do some errands, so we went to a bunch of places with her whilst, er...  urlLink fooling around with my new camera . During the outing, Ian bought The Matrix and I got a tabloid (I love those things XD). Then we went to Wendy's, but they were mean and didn't give us fries. >:(  Completely unrelated, Zefer is being weird. It's kinda worrying me.

      I finally got around to seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban today (shut up). It was pretty kick-ass with the exception of all the stuff they left out. The book was waaay better (shut up). I think this book was my favorite of the series. The movie's probably my favorite too, but it left a whole lot of important details out.  So after that, I went and bought some stuff with my newly earned money. A cheap digital camera. It's nothing special, but it was only $20, so I got what I paid for. ;) And also, I bought a DVD player. It was about damn time, really. My family has never purchased one before this, so we've been really deprived of the new craze that is DVD's. Yay! Now I can watch alot more anime n' such.  By this point I reeeally need to make some Oddities comics, but tomorrow's not looking good. I think I'm going over to Ian's house. I'll  really  try to get caught up later though.

I WOULD be reading Eragon as well, but Ian stole it back. 34. DID YOU WAKE UP BEFORE YOUR ALARM WENT OFF? Yeah. 36. DO YOU MISS BIG BROTHER YET? Sad as it may be, I think I'll be watching the upcoming season. You know, as long as it's not as SUCK as the last one. 37. FAVOURITE SMELLS? The smell of taaacos... Mmm... 38. WHAT INSPIRES YOU?

      I went over to Ian's today to play Dungeons & Dragons with him and Dan. But we actually did very little of that. As always, we cracked up at basically nothing. I'm still debating whether "pews" is an actual word or if Ian just made it up. :P Help me out, dictionary.com.  So rather than D&D, we ended up doing alot of  Whose Line is it Anyway?  games and went swimming in his pool. That was fun.  And so much for being on schedule with comics. I now have quite a bit of make-up to do.

      Besides waking up ridiculously early and working till complete exhaustion in the hot summer sun, today was a pretty good day. I don't know what is about Portland, but I'm quite fond of it. The architecture is wonderful, and the way the sun shines onto all the adjacent brick buildings is simply beautiful (I'd make that sound  less  corny if I wasn't so tired). I never really noticed how diverse it is though. I mean, Maine is definitely one of the least diverse places in the United States, but I did see quite a few different races and ethnicities. Some French (maybe) lady even bought some plants from me whilst talking some kind of... Franglish? That was pretty weird. She called me "bebe." WTF? XD  So after a long day of selling plants, we packed up and went to the bar that my dad frequents. While he talked to his friends, I attempted to find the comic store that the guy at the Casablanca Comics in Saco also runs. With no prevail. I'll have to find a map, since that part of the city is FREAKING HUGE. And the people that live around there scare me. Thugs.  I'd go to sleep now, but going to sleep at 9:00 is a sin. Even for an atheist.

      What eats mosquitos? Whatever does, we need more of them around here. I did some more work in the garden today. This time, hoeing! Ohhh! Facinating! Well, no. Extremely repetitive and boring. And to make things even better, it rained. I don't know if mosquitos really like the rain or what, but they made me into a blood smoothie (that sounds really gross). The bastards.  Tomorrow, I'm going in with my dad to the Farmer's Market. I have to get up at 4:30 (DREAD) and work there for most of the day, but I should make a pretty hefty income from it. If all goes well, I'll be doing that every Wednesday during my break too.

      I seem to be back on schedule with comics. I did one today, and I have one ready for tomorrow. And if everything goes as planned, this should be a pretty awesome storyline. :)

      I think this year is the first time I actually got my dad something for Father's Day. I usually just let my mom get something, and I sign my name on it. X) This year, however, I put some effort into a present. A few months (perhaps weeks) ago, Zefer linked me to a site where you can type in your address and get a nice aerial image of your house taken by a satellite. The images are black and white and kinda hard to make out, but since our house has that massive garden in back, it's pretty easily distinguishable. Anyways, I took that image of our house/garden and added in the name of my dad's farm business and the year it was established in MS Paint. Then I got a nice frame to put it in at Wal-Mart. I think it turned out to be a pretty snazzy Father's Day present. He seemed to like it.  After that, my sister and I played badminton for a while. And then we went to Subway for supper. Mmm... subs.

      So I ended up spending most of today planting stuff for my dad. Not  exactly  how I like to spend my summer days, but hey, I get paid. I planted about three rows of plants. These aren't little kiddy fun-time rows though. These are  huge, monster, commercial farming  rows. It was hot and the rocks were hell on my knees. Even with knee pads. So I'm pretty exhausted and dirty right now. I think I'll go take a shower. A nice, cold shower. And then I'll drink some lemonade. Yesss, lemonade.

      I got my report card today. I'm just glad I  passed  Geometry. :D The grade wasn't too high, but it's at least a C. Yay! No repeat-y! Everything else was A's and B's I think. So goodbye Freshman classes. Hello Sophomore classes. I'm sure you'll be just as painful. :)

      Another very unproductive day. I  still  haven't made any new comics like I've been promising. Oy. I'm too lazy for my own good. I'm going to try to make some tonight though.  Unlike yesterday, however, I got properly dressed (gasp!) and went to the orthodontist. Yes, those evil folks that have plagued my mouth with burden after burden of tooth-correcting contraptions. Good news though! They say I get my braces n' such off in six weeks! Whoo! I can't wait to chew gum and eat sticky candy again (this isn't to say I haven't, because try as they might, they cannot stop me from chewing my beloved bubblegum! when no one's looking.   On a completely different note, Chi's too bootylicious for me. He'd better get his damned internet back soon.

      Veeery lazy day. Got to sleep in till 8. Played Achaea and chatted on MSN for most of the day. Ate canned spaghetti for lunch (not real yummy, but really easy to make!). Did dishes. Hmmm. Those sentences could use more... nouns. Anyways, I'm going to go make some comics before Zefer kills anymore kitties.

      Here's an MSN conversation between Zefer and me. He's so wise.   Zefer:  Update Oddities, or I'll kill kitties.  Urza:  FINE.  Urza:  Later.  Zefer:  When later? =b  Urza:  When I'm not talking to lovely people like you.    Zefer:  I'll kill 20 kitties for every day you don't update. The death of kitties is directly proportionate to how much I want you to update.  Urza:  ;_;  Zefer:  So on days I don't care as much, I may kill... 19 kitties. Or maybe I'll kill 19 and badly beat one.  Zefer:  And on days when I care lots, I'll kill, say... 500 kitties.  Urza:  O.O  Urza:  Where do the kitties come from?  Zefer:  Other people's homes, streets, animal shelters, etc. =b  Urza:  Oh...    Zefer:  Where did you THINK I'd get them?  Zefer:  A kitty machine?  Urza:  The stork?  Zefer:  The stork isn't real, Urza. Have your parents been sheltering you from how you were really made? =b  Urza:  W-what?  Zefer:  It's true.  Zefer:  You weren't delivered by the stork.  Urza:  Were you?!  Zefer:  No.  Urza:  AHHH!  Urza:  Was... ANYONE?!  Zefer:  Once long ago, yes.  Zefer:  But the baby-delivering stork is now extinct.  Urza:  They were tastey, weren't they? Like buffalo?  Zefer:  People hunted down the baby delivering stork. These people disliked the human race and wanted them to stop existing. But it was far easier to kill every baby delivering stork than to kill every human. They succeeded in stopping the human race from existing... in a way.  Zefer:  I'm not sure I should tell you the rest.  Urza:  Tell me, Unky Zef!  Zefer:  There are no more people. We're all ROBOTS. With no more baby delivering stork to deliver human babies from the place only they know about, humans were forced to create robots in the place of real people. Every 'human' on the earth is really just machine. No one is quite sure of how real humans worked, anymore. Or even how closely we resemble them.  Urza:  *complete shock*  Zefer:  It is rather shocking, yes.  Zefer:  You'll be told when you reach age... ... hey, on a completely unrelated note, how old are you?  Urza:  15.  Zefer:  Oh.  Zefer:  Well  Zefer:  You'll be told when you reach age 17.  Urza:  Told what?  Zefer:  It's the official 'tell other robots who think they're really humans that they're robots' age.  Zefer:  I know. I'm not supposed to tell you.  Urza:  :O  Urza:  Wait, aren't you only 16?  Zefer:  ...Hey, shut up.

      At long last, the school year is over! Hurrah! So I've been reminiscing the good things of the year and blocking out the bad things that gnaw on my brain in the most painful possible manor. I could reminisce here, but that would take forever, and I'm sure you don't want to read that anyways. But overall, I must say, it's been a pretty good year.  On the last day of school today, I took my Gym final (eeeasy). After that, all I had was Global Village, in which we had already passed in final essays. So Brandon, Chris F., Chris G., and I played Gameboy whilst the rest of the class played kickball. I would've played, but I don't like kickball. Or moving. ;) Brandon let me play Metroid: Zero Mission. I got confused alot. I got to fight some big worm thing. Is it just me, or do all first bosses/mini-bosses involve waiting for their eye(s) to open and then shooting them like mad? Anyways, I got bored of that after a while (read as: I died), so I stole Chris G.'s Pokemon game. While he was looking. And I still have it. I hope he doesn't want to play over the summer. ^^;;  Since getting home, I've been listening to Bad Hair Day by Weird Al (as I do on every last day of school) and playing  urlLink Achaea  (which I've gotten back into for about the fifth time). And I ate a Lunchable (still cool!) for lunch.  Ah, free at last. So glad it's summer. Any longer at school, and I think I'd explode. I say this every summer, and it's usually a lie, but I'm going to say it anyways: This is gonna be the best summer ever. :D

      Oh, the irony. A coulple of days ago, I noticed that there was a new cement barrier between the hair salon and the church a few miles away. So yesterday, the hair salon put up the message "WE DIDN'T PUT UP THE BARRIER." on their sign. Apparently, people using he hair salon had been using the church's parking lot. The church didn't like that and put up the barrier. Why? I haven't clue. They only need it on one day of the freaking week. Seemed a tad selfish. Especially being the pure little Christian place of prayer that it is. So today, the salon changed their sign again to say "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR." XD All I could think was, "Pwned." Silly hypocritical Christians.  Anyhow, went to the comic store today. They didn't have any of the books I was looking for though, so that kinda sucked. So instead I bought a CD. Amnesiac by Radiohead. I've been meaning to buy it for a long time. Overall, it's pretty enjoyable. Definately not their best though.  Whee! Tomorrow's the last day of school!

      Being the nice day it was today, I decided to take advangtage of it and play some badminton. I've had a badminton net that has remained unused for quite some time now. My sister and I tried to put it together, but it was too complicated (read as: we were too lazy). So rather than going through the trouble of playing with a net, and with rules for that matter, we just served the birdie around. It was fun. My mom joined us after a while. We must've spent an hour playing, and I was pretty exhausted by the end. Yes, exhausted from  badminton . Man, I'm out of shape. :P

      Yum. I just got to eat lunch at China City. Chinese food = PWN.  In other news, I tried to do a Kirby move earlier today. You know the one where he ducks and then does sort of a slide kick on the floor? Long story short, I can't do that. ;) Wouldn't it be cool if I could though?  Thus far, it's been a pretty uneventful weekend. I'mma try to get a ride to Casablanca Comics later to pick up a few comic books I've been wanting. I'll probably see if Ian wants to do anything tomorrow too.

      Haha. My mom forwarded this to me. I thought it was pretty funny.   At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."  In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:  1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.  2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.  3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.  4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.  5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five percent of the roads.  6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" warning light.  7. The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.  8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.  9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls  would operate in the same manner as the old car.  10. You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.

      Ewww. Something smells like... Geometry final. I don't think I did too well with it. Then again, I'm not a math person. Even though I'm in an Honors math class.   So that's one half day down. Just one more to go. And that should be easy. All I gots to do is a little Gym final (Gym test? WTF?). And that's all I've got to say for now.

      Whee! New journalish blog thing! I had another journal a few months (possibly years) ago that got eaten by animals, so it's about time I made a replacement.  So what's going on? Summer break is almost here for one. Only one day (according to my mathematical skills, half day + half day = one full day) is left till the big break. Ah, can't wait. It'll give me the time I need to work on projects that I've put off during the school year (my under-updated webcomic and my big fiction story). Knowing me, I'll probably end up starting a few other things as well.  Today was pretty cool though. Seeing as it's the end of the school year, there wasn't much really productive going on. Geometry was studying for the final exam, Spanish was doing some quiz thingy, Gym was sitting, and Global Village was more sitting. Ohhh, I got to play Oregon Trail on the crumby school Macs with Chris in Global Village though. That was pretty cool. I caught typhoid fever and died. :) And I swear to god our guns shot cannon balls.  Anyhow, I should probably be studying for my Geometry and Spanish finals. They  are  tomorrow after all.

      So why haven't I been posting? Well, because nothing is happening. No, really. Ian is in Toronto. Or  something . Ragnarok has found a pretty effective way to tick me off. Chi has yet to return, and I don't think there have been  any  group chats this week. At least none that I was a part of. My Stargate SG-1 season 1 and 2 DVD sets have been keeping me pretty busy.  urlLink Bofrearl  started existing.  urlLink Comics  stopped existing. And once again, no work this week since it was all rainy and such.&nbsp;This has&nbsp;been  such  a rainy summer. Not the good rain, either. No thunderstorms or down pours. Just gray, misty, icky rain. Anyways, that's about it. I'll probably go continue working on comics. I'd like to get at least three done today. We'll see what happens though.

      That's right. I've become another victim to the addictiveness of  DRUGS  RAGNAROK ONLINE. Ian found me a&nbsp;snazzy private server and gave me some burned discs, so I wouldn't have to go through the&nbsp; tedious  download times. Since, I've become completely hooked. Resistance is futile. Ragnarok has claimed my soul. :(   But other than that, pretty typical week. Worked. Made comics (Need to do two catch ups though! Oops!). Read. Idled on MSN all freaking day. Spending the day CHI-LESS. I swear, if I was stonger, didn't care about going to jail, and lived across the ol' Atlantic, I'd go and give BT a little Urza Smash. *TERRORIST THREAT, TERRORIST THREAT* Oh, just kidding. I would never&nbsp;do such a thing! *LIE, LIE, LIE* Hey, shut up. *OKAY*

      Saturday was fun. Well, maybe not the work part. Because work is  work . And I must say, Saturday's Market is a bit busier than Wednesday's. But other than that, pretty fun. My sister picked me up from Gritty's after work, and we went to some Clam Festival a few cities away. Why we celebrate clams? I haven't a clue. I don't even like clams. They&nbsp; did  have some pretty yummy onion rings though. :) She, her boyfriend, and I did some little quarter-gambling thing very similar to roulette. And what do you know, we doubled our money! Too bad we only started out with $2. Then we went to her place and rented School of Rock, which&nbsp;was pretty funny. Jack Black cracks me up. That night, I got to sleep in the AC room. Ahhh, AC. Of course, I slept like a drugged panda. ;) &nbsp; I HATE YOU, GOOGLE ADS.

      Since I didn't go to the Wednesday Market this week, I'll be doing it on Saturday instead since I'm a greedy, greedy person who wants money. ;) After which, I'll be going to my sister's and spending the night. Thus, y'all probably won't be seeing much of me, and I probably won't be able to make&nbsp;a comic. So, you know, unless one of my five readers would like to make a guest strip, no Saturday comic. S'right.

      I went down the street to some generic resteraunt. Ate some yummies. The real reason I went, however, was because they were having some open mic thing down there. I though that sounded neat, and it's not like I have much better to do on a Thursday night. And it  was  nice. They had, like, three guitar players who were  really  good and two singers what were very good as well. They mostly did country and blues stuff, which really isn't my type of music at all. But I usually find that talent is undenyable&nbsp;and more or less enjoyable on some level.

      It's been about 8 days since The Chio said he'd have his internet back "in no more than 10 days." So I'm expecting him any day now. And he'd  better  show up. To think it's been about half a year since he got disconnected!

      This is the first Wednesday that I haven't been working in a while since it's really too rainy and icky to be outside at the Market all day. Sooo I'm home all day. Whee.  And I'm proud to say that Oddities actually has some new comics!  urlLink Ch-check it out!

      Hmmm. I wish those Google ads up top would stop saying I have cancer. :( Anyways, at lack of anything better to post, I give you... MSN conversation snippets!   Zefer:  I have no clue what autism is, though. =b  Urza:  It's like "living in your own little word".  Zefer:  Shit.  Zefer:  I want autism. =(  Urza:  ...it's a mental retardation...  Zefer:  ...Oh.  Zefer:  ...I'm not sure I want autism.   Urza:  Pity yiff, Baha?  Baha:  ...What?  Urza:  What?  jd:  what?  Zefer:  Am I supposed to say what?  jd:  probably  Zefer:  'What?'  Urza:  Way to crap on the oysters, Zefer.   jd:  it makes them taste better  Zefer:  How do you know that?  Urza:  Well I guess a negative plus a negative has to equal a possitive, eh?  Baha:  It's a negative multiplied by a negative.  Baha:  A negative plus a negative would equal a greater negative.  Urza:  I rest my case.  jd:  i rest mine too.  Zefer:  I don't have a case.  Urza:  Yeah, you do! A NUTCASE!  Urza:  *sitcom audience laughter*  Zefer:  PWNED. =(  Baha:  Going now...   Zefer:  But... hmm... Saskatchewan is close to the US border as well, but it's friggin' FREEZING there.  Blitzy:  and saskatchewan is in the middle isn't it? because then it makes sense it being a lot colder in the winter  Zefer:  Yeah, Saskatchewan is kind of in the middle.  Blitzy:  then it should be colder because it doesn't have any sea around it  Zefer:  =O  Zefer:  I see.  Zefer:  Didn't know that. =b  Urza:  Wouldn't places BY the sea be colder?  Rob:  Yeah.   Zefer:  I don't know how it works, but it seems true. =b  Blitzy:  nah, which is why the UK is never that cold, because it's an island and surrounded by the sea  Baha:  We had a question about that in Physics...  Baha:  I just wrote something about pirates.

      Whoa. It's been a while since I've posted something here. I'd say that I've been doing something awesome and productive, but that would be a lie. Well, I  have  been working on a website with Ian. I don't know if that's really going anywhere though. Probably not.  And I'd also like to add that I'm a horrible, horrible person for not updating Oddities enough. I'm horrible at keeping up with projects like that. It's like ADD on a larger scale. But with enough continuous punches from Mr. Catfish and Zefer, I might start getting some stuff up! Keep it coming, guys. The procrastination must come to and end.

      Third day of work at the Market. Twas mostly normal besides some nutcase thug (perhaps a drunkard/druggy) that wanted to fight me. Here, I'll put it into a general dialogue for your viewing pleasure.   Nutcase:  SEXUAL HARASSMENT!  Lady That Sells Roses Next To Me And My Dad:  OHHH! HELP!  Me:  CONFUSION!  Nutcase:  HEY, I NOTICE YOU NOW!  Me:  DAMN!  Nutcase:  THREATENING STATEMENT!  Me:  SILENCE TREATMENT!  Nutcase:  OHHH! IT BURNS LIKE KRYPTONITE! I LEAVE NOW!  Now here's how it would go if I  wasn't  a wimp.   Nutcase:  SEXUAL HARASSMENT!  Lady:  OHHH! HELP!  Me:  WHAT YOU SAY?!  Nutcase:  HEY, I NOTICE YOU NOW!  Me:  STATEMENT REFERRING TO VIGILANTE JUSTICE!  Nutcase:  THREATENING STATEMENT PROBABLY WITH SOME SORT OF PUN!  Me:  QUESTIONING NUTCASE'S ABILITY TO FIGHT!  Nutcase:  SMACK TALK!  Me:  SCRAWNY ARM  SMAAAASH !  Nutcase:  OHHH! PWNED! I LEARNED  MY  LESSON!  Haha. Yeah. Showed him.

      My doctor wanted an x-ray of my chest for some reason. He had one, but apparently it was outdated. There was alot of resistance on my part. Along with some name-calling. But I eventually allowed them do their x-ray. I expect I should be recieving some kind of superhero powers at any moment now.  Also,  urlLink happy (day-late) birthday, AaaSoC !

      Sooo... Kill Bill. Volume 1. Yeah. I'm not sure if I really enjoyed or really disliked this movie. On good side, samurais. Can't go wrong with samurais. Also, alot of cool Japanese culture stuff. Including a little scene of anime! However, you don't really know what's going on at all in this "volume". It's like, "Oh, she was going to get married. Oh, she didn't. Oh, people hate her. OH, SAMURAIS." I can only hope that the second one has some explanations. Also, someone needs to tell Tarantino how blood works. Because it most certainly doesn't erupt from wounds like volcanoes, as he depicts in this movie. Overall, odd movie. I'm still going to watch the other one though. ;)

      My TV was getting old. Prehistoric, one may say. She always needed help to do the new, cool things. You know, like adapters for Gamecube and stuff. She just didn't have the sockets I needed! The neat Audio and Video ones! And in BED. Ohhh, in BED. There was never any ACTION in bed. You know, because there was no remote control! I couldn't even bring her out in public. She looked... outdated. She had that whole 90's look going on. So yesterday, girl! Things just weren't working out. The age difference was just... unbearable. So I did it. I left her for another wom- er, TV. I'll admit, I feel alot happier now with Durabrand 13" Color Television, but I can't help but feel guilty when I see little little 90's-Television-That-I-Don't-Have-The-Box-For-And-Thus-Can't-Tell-You-Its-Name staring back at me when I'm walking along. We'll both get over it, I'm sure. We had alot of good times, sure, but there's something special between me and Durabrand. Oh yes. I could just feel it when I watched a DVD with her. It was... magical. I think she enjoyed it as much as I did.  *rereads entry* ...I feel dirty. :P

      I went to the doctor today. For whatever reason, my mom made an appointment. I mean, I'm sick n' all, but it's not "go to the doctor" sick. At any rate, I'm taking some pill now. The kind you have to swallow WHOLE (I know that's most pills. Shut up.). It's like PURE EVIL poured into a tiny pill capsule. 'Cause, y'know, swallowing anything that big that  isn't  food pretty much sucks. When I took one, it kinda reminded me of that "How To Feed a Pill to a Cat" thing that Incu sent me a while ago. Hey, I'mma go try and find that. :D

      Rumor has it that everyone's favorite online adventure series is returning! A continuation of  urlLink Mystery of the Forum  and its shorter-lived sequel,  urlLink Mystery of the Phorum  is being planned by Rob, Zef, and me. It's still in the planning stages, but expect to see some more info on it soon.

      Okay! Let's see how many words it takes me to describe a week!  Tuesday, went to Ian's. Played Thief III, which he had recently acquired. Awesome game. Later, Darren joined us.  Whose Line  games ensued. Then Darren almost blew up Ian's computer. But he didn't. Went home. Ordered pizza. *shock & awe* Which, like, hardly ever happens.  Wednesday, wooork. Started out pretty normal till around 6 or 7, when it started  down pouring . It was vicious. But luckily, that didn't last to long, so business proceeded pretty normally. I'm planning on using my earnings for some anime DVDs. So hopefully, within a week or two, I should have the complete Cowboy Bebop and Escaflowne series. Whoo!  As far as comics went this week, I managed to complete a M-W-F schedule. With help from Mr. Catfish. ;) I have no idea what I'll use next week. I'd like to do every week day, but I might end up with M-W-F again. We'll see.  And that concludes my muchly abridged week!

       urlLink   A BLEACH BLONDE Penguin Lies Beneath!    I took the  urlLink Inner Penguin online quiz  and found out I am a Bleach Blonde Penguin on the inside. Now this is quite a do-gooder kind of penguin. ^^ Being one of these wondrous birds is quite the experience; I'm what can be known as 'the quiet one' or in some extreme cases 'the wussy one'. This is because I have a great affinity for helping people out. My broad repertoire of healing techniques are well-known. Those who stick by me are lucky, as I tend to help them when help is most needed.   I don't think much of myself, and never put my own well-being above my friends. I'm calm, pleasant, intelligent, and vastly fun to talk to. On the battlefield, however, my healing purposes are my only strength. When it comes down to actually fighting, I'm not exactly gifted. Hiding behind a strong friend is always the best option! XD    This is old, but way awesome. :D

      As I said before, I went to my grandparents' 50th anniversary party. The  seeecret  one. They seemed to be pretty suprised. I took pictures, recorded stuff, and talked to relatives of whom  no clue  of their relation to me. And my uncle who was hosting the thing had his dog running around, slobering on everything. *twitch, twitch* If America was a dictatorship, and I were running it, I would have a huuuge dog genocide. It'd be like Hitler's, only mine would make sense. But anways, it was never too boring considering what it was. My mom did a great job planning it all.  These entries are getting so vague. ;)

      Chi got reconnected, like, two days ago. That makes me happy. But right now, everyone's depressed. That makes me sad. Zefer's being all weird again. Supposedly, he's leaving us.  Then it got contageous, and Karma got depressed. He said he was leaving. And Chi got it too, and he left as well. Then I decided to hop on the bandwagon and threatened to leave as well. I never can tell when we're being serious, but hopfully they'll all be coming back. =/  Anyhow, not going to be around tomorrow. Anniversary thing. Hurrah.

      It's been a busy few days. Especially with relatives over. First, on Saturday, my gandparents came. We went on a walk in some marsh. Which sounds stupid. And more or less  was . I still got some pretty pictures though. I'll post them here if I can get the digital forms.  Sunday, there was some anniversary of some aunt of an aunt that I don't really know. But I didn't have to go. Thank god. OLD PEOPLE  SMAAASH .  Then, Monday, my uncle who's in the navy came home. But my grandparents don't know, because it's a surprise! OMG, the secrecy. Anyways, he'll be staying here till Saturday when we throw my grandparents a  seeecreet anniversary party  of their own. That might actually be fun, because apparently, I get to take pictures and video tape stuff. I'm  so  doing commentary. :D
