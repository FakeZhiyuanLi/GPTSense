        last night i slept over at sharlits with becky. and do you know what we did. we read books. why i do not know. but we did stuff before that...like walking to zehrs at 10 at night...and walking to the store three million times saying that we were suicidal.          do i look suicidal?-sharlit     no why-me     because matt sloopka and becky said i did.-sharlit     have you heard that matt is a nerd...and becky is wrong.-me     yes.hehe-sharlit.     you know i am suicidal[give a 'suicidal face'-me.     omg! you are.-sharlit.      yes i know-me     and now i am walking in the middle of the road because i am suicidal.-me          that carried on through the whole night. with..          'are you going on the computure because your suicidal.'     'are you eating because your suicidal.'     and so on and so forth thurr is more i just cant remember. yes. right now i am at mike and michelles.and i am talking to cassidy while 'cheif' thur kitten watches me type. it is funny. because he is trying to catch the arrow. he is really cute..but i dont know why they named him cheif.because zorro is a better name. that is why maya should name her puppy that.anyways...cassidy is talking about matt livingstone and what they are talking about which i really dont understand..but that is okay. the kitten is now playing with my strings to my pants..and they are near my crothchel area...i like it. actally. it is making me nervous.but that is okay. but anyways i guess i shall go finnish watching coyote ugly. i was supossed to go to bed after one movie.but all well.           LOVES YEH ALL-lelauren.

        today.. i was at rachels. you all know her as the dad who has half a finger. and buried the rest in the back yard..          i must tell you.. that was the worst expeirence that i have in my entire life.. and i will never do it again.          well tonight. i dont know what i am doing.. because saba said come over. and i made plans with sharlit and becky before she said that. and when i called her she said she was going to her cousins.. so i dont really know. because sharlit and becky are coming over now.          so saba.. yet again. i am sorry if you get mad. for i thought that you were going to be at your cousins. yours always. lelauren.          if i didnt say that i would feel guilty.. but i dont know.. i am always in trouble...actually.. no i'm not. but still.           i finnally got my hair dye. and i am dying it 'deep intense red' otherwise.. dark red.          well i'm out.      -lelauren

        i am babysitting at this moment. and it is very early in the morning.. this kid is wierd sometimes..he was talking to his can of pepsi.. weird? yes. i must say...          so far i havent fallen asleep yet..and i am very proud of myself that i havent. although i want too.. i am not going to. i never realized that when you are sleeping.. you dont feel hungery. so when you stay awake the hungrery you get. gah! oh.. i am one smart cookie.          this weekn i am not doing much.. saba isnt hurr. and britt gets back on friday. so maybe i will do something with her. but i doubt it.           yet again i am dying my hair.. dark red. i hate this blonde/orange/ whatever colour it is.i dont like it and i dont intend on keeping it.       woah. i never noticed how violent the kids next door is. with thurr gun shooting eggs.. and lazers.. AND the count spankula.woah that is just WAY to violent for this child. maybe that is why he beats on me.i think i shall change it on him. but then he would beat me up. maybe he is secrectly count spankula..and he wants to spank me. and i dont very well want that...          well i'm out.     -lelauren

If I attend that wedding, but only as a guest   Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress   Spun with threads of my regret   Sing it loud to drown out the feeling     When you're feeling much more odd (even)   And half as true as dishonored seamen   We'll breathe Pacific and fight our demons   Would you be depressed?   If I attend that wedding, but only as a guest   Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress   Spun with threads of my regret   So arch your back   And flip your hair   Make eye contact so you know I care   You know I care   But only as a guest   Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress   Spun with threads of my regret      wow. that has to be one of the most depressing songs for me.. why i do not know.today my day was uneventful.. i had to babysitt. and i just slept.. yes i know. for shame on me for sleeping.. but the kid wasnt even thurr half the time.. and his older brother was home.. but all well.. i didnt eat. i was so hungery part of the reason was everytime i got up i would go all dizzy and i would see black and nothing else.
