      Attila,  How much have I fallen in love with the democrats?  Al Sharpton, Theresa Heinz Kerry, Bill Clinton, Obama, Kerry, I mean I'm sold!  Tonight I watched (online of course, I don't have cable and don't receive PBS) Kerry's daughter, the Band of Brothers and Kerry's speeches, but thus far I've been watching the videos each night when I get home from my computer.   I grew up a democrat.  My grandfather signed up as a Marine at a very young 17, got shot through the head but managed to come home, go through college and law school in 5 years with the help of the GI Bill, was elected a magistrate and eventually became an many-time elected judge.  Though he was supposed to be impartial, I can remember going to his chambers and seeing donkey figurines everywhere, and a rock on his desk that said "the buck stops here," a tribute to one of his favorite presidents that happened to be the only Missourian ever elected to office.  I remember watching the '84 and '88 conventions at my grandparents house, watching him yell at George Bush Senior when he was running against Dukakis, and loudly exclaiming to my parents that it wasn't fair that just because I was 8 I couldn't vote for Dukakis.   When my grandfather was still sitting on the bench I fawned continuously over this one figurine he had, a donkey with a garland of flowers around his neck, pink and prancing.  He gave me the figurine, and I carried it with me through college, and the summer that I graduated from college, the summer that he died, I broke that figurine.  With my grandfather's passing my feelings of connection to the democratic party, so tragically symbolized with the breaking of that cute "ass," dissipated, and I became so disillusioned with politics that I disliked both parties with equal fervor.  But these past few nights, something's shifted.  I cried during Obama's speech, laughed with glee at Bill Clinton's speech, discovered a new role model in Teresa Kerry, clapped my hands and shouted "rock on!"  and "no he did not say that!" when Sharpton spoke, then sat in misty-eyed contemplation at his words on Ray Charles, because I'd never heard that version of America the Beautiful before, and had never had the chance to think about what those words must have meant to him.  I've never been able to completely shake off this cloak of faith in the ideals and philosophy of America, this weighty feeling that I had been born into a country that had tremendous untapped potential.  But I had seen the majestic mountains, and had been privilege to have a caring and devoted family and good schooling.  My ever-idealistic streak has traditionally hidden under a cloak of cynicism, and I feel ashamed all the sudden.  Here's this man, Ray Charles, who had every reason to see only the dark side of American life, and the only memories I have of him are of him with a smile so wide, so cheerful and spirited.  What right do I have to be cynical?  After Kerry's speech tonight I called my dad.  He and I have had a very open dialogue about most everything for a very long time, and was thus expecting my phone call.  He and I both share this sometimes-overly empathetic spirit, and we've worked each other up in a dither these past few years, arguing and getting agitated and excited.  He's incensed that the networks didn't carry the convention, and that cable didn't carry most of it, and that most Americans didn't have any kind of access to any but one or two of the speeches.  The only reason I saw Barack Obama was because he's running in Illinois.  He wasn't shown everywhere by any means.   Dad got all choked up because he heard on NPR today that aljazeera was showing more of the conventions than our own media, and throughout the whole conversation he kept repeating, "what the hell are we doing?"  He told me that he was going to the Kerry office in St Louis on Saturday, and that he was mad at me for not doing getting more involved, even telling me that he might just buy me that cutie-baby doll Kerry*Edwards tee if I'd do some volunteer work.   So in a roundabout way, I guess what I'm coming down to is that George W Bush has stirred up a hornets nest.  I feel like the democratic party is more united than it has been in my entire life, and even if Bush gets re-elected there's been a swelling here of historic proportions, and I'm beginning to have faith that it won't be easily quelled.  My dad said he hadn't felt this excited about anything since the Vietnam war, and all the sudden I'm identifying with a party that I'd felt previously felt alienated by and feel compelled to claim for my own this brand of optimism that's being peddled on every corner.  A friend of mine is taking the copy of Outfoxed loaned to me and is making copies to pass out to friends willy-nilly, Puff Daddy is wearing t-shirts that say "vote or die", and moveon.org, blogs, and meetups are changing the way Americans and the world think about themselves, and most importantly, making everyone re-think the concept of community and what their place in it should be.   There were many great soundbites that came out of this convention.  Al Sharpton stating that African American's had decided to "ride this donkey as far as it will take us" blew me away, as did his proposal that Clarence Thomas wouldn't be on the bench if Bush Jr. had appointed the justices in the 50s.  One of the best, and one least likely to to gain any attention, was when Sharpton said "Life's not about where you start, but where you goin'."  And for some reason that made me think of the Microsoft tagline, "where do you want to go today?"  It's not a bad question for me to be asking of myself.  Starting tomorrow, after I get some sleep.

      Oh girl, "Yet wrong he is. Wrong as the day is long."  "The world is so intrinsically connected like so many threads in an ancient coat cyring out to be forever linked that we can no longer deny it. It's beautiful and frightening like all things true. And dear god I hope we realize it soon."  You'll have to forgive me for the big grin on my face. I mean no disrespect, I hope you understand, but that is one big pile of gorgonzola. Which, re-reading my recent post, I can't say that I didn't stray into some cheese of the bleu variety myself.  Recently, my roommate has become a dvd bootleg king. I've seen piss-poor quality versions of Spiderman 2, King Arthur, White Chicks, and right now we're sitting here watching Bourne Supremacy, having a few cocktails. BTW, you should look up the etymology of the word cocktail. Pretty interesting.  My dad has, in the space of a week, become a huge volunteer for the democrat party in Missouri. He calls me everyday practically, telling me about all the people who he's met, how they're all young people like me (and cute guys, too! he's quick to point out). He met a moveon.org organizer, he's so excited, and I feel like he's been given a new lease on life. It's really cute.  This segue's not so easily into what I wanted to say in response to your email. Maybe you have, and maybe you haven't heard about the benevolent dictator of Chicago, otherwise known as Mayor Daley. I disagree with a lot of Daley's policy's, a lot of his attitudes, but there's one thing that I always have to give him credit for: he loves this city so much, and he wants what's best for it. Our ideas as to what that means may be different, but his enthusiasm is authentic. That's kinda what I feel about the dems right now. I believe that Kerry really wants what's best for the whole country, in the long term. I've never felt that way about the Bushies. That, my dear, is the reason I feel hope.  For all the politicking, someone who cares about the people he's serving is remarkable, and that should excite you.

      Rian, I wish I had your conviction.  I see beauty in so many things, but politics is politics.  And here we sit, in a country with everything and yet as blind as Justice with covered breasts.  Thanks Ashcroft.    Yesterday, I was reading the local paper, and a letter of complaint caught my eye.  The wise, old fool writing this enlighting LTE was complaining about the amount of news in the paper that focused on the world beyond Central New York.  "Why," he asks, "do I need to read this."  He lamented that it didn't matter.  The rest of the world had no affect on him, so why should he take the precious time to read about it.    Fair enough.  Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion so say the relativists.  Yet wrong he is.  Wrong as the day is long.  Because as nice as it would be to sit on our porches in Middle America and proclaim to the ether that we have no responsibility in this world, we can only fool ourselves.  The world is so intrinsically connected like so many threads in an ancient coat cyring out to be forever linked that we can no longer deny it.  It's beautiful and frightening like all things true.  And dear god I hope we realize it soon.  As far as the democrats go, well, good luck.  Obama makes me want to cry, and Teresa Heinz is a stalwart woman.  I respect them both.  Sharpton, is, well, Sharpton.  And for some reason I wish he had won the nomination, just like I wish Obama would hurry up and run for president.  We need some people with emotion and conviction and a strong desire to make this country what it could truly be.  Maybe the dems could achieve this.  However, I haven't yet left the cynical station, and this train seems mighty shaky to me.  Maybe it's because I realize the quality of power.  To get as far as Kerry, a person has to sell a part of himself.  It's nothing against Kerry.  It's just the nature of the beast.  I am, however, willing to be wrong.  In fact, I want to be.  And I do feel an element of intensity swirling about this election like the excitement before a summer storm.  I just hope those winds blow Bush all the way back to Crawford, Texas.  He seems to like it better there than Washington anyway.      Well, I'm off with a few words of wisdom from Lawrence Ferlinghetti in his poem "A Buddha in the Woodpile"   If there had been only one Buddhist in the woodpile in Waco Texas to teach us how to sit still one saffron Buddhist in the back rooms just one Tibetan lama just one Taoist just one Zen just one Thomas Merton Trappist just one saint in the wilderness of Waco USA If there had been only one calm little Gandhi in a white sheet or suit one not-so-silent partner who at the last moment shouted Wait  If there had been just one majority of one in the lotus position in the inner sanctum who bowed his shaved head to the Chief of All Police and raised his hands in a mudra and chanted the Great Paramita Sutra the Diamond Sutra the Lotus Sutra If there had somehow been  just one Gandhian spinner  with Brian Willson  at the gates of the White House  at the Gates of Eden  then it wouldn't have been  Vietnam once again  and its "One two three four  What're we waitin' for?"  If one single ray of the light  of the Dalai Lama  when he visited this land  had penetrated somehow  the Land of the Brave where the lion never lies down with the lamb-- But not a glimmer got through  The Security screened it out  screened out the Buddha  and his not-so-crazy wisdom  If only in the land of Sam Houston  if only in the land of the Alamo  if only in Wacoland USA  if only in Reno  if only on CNN CBS NBC  one had comprehended  one single syllable  of the Gautama Buddha  of the young Siddhartha  one single whisper of  Gandhi's spinning wheel  one lost syllable  of Martin Luther King  or of the Early Christians  or of Mother Teresa  or Thoreau or Whitman or Allen Ginsberg  or of the millions in America tuned to them  If the inner ears of the inner sanctums  had only been half open  to any vibrations except  those of the national security state  and had only been attuned  to the sound of one hand clapping  and not one hand punching  Then that sick cult and its children  might still be breathing  the free American air  of the First Amendment  @) 1993, Lawrence Ferlinghetti reprinted with permission from These Are My Rivers: New & Selected Poems 1955-1993, A New Directions Publication

      I think he should pick that guy who plays the President on that t.v. show.  He seems pretty bright and Americans like to elect actors.

      As you know, I am obsessed with the speculation about who Kerry is going to pick for Vice-President.  I came across something interesting on AOL (insert your joke here).  They have an informal poll which asks people whom they would rather hear speaking during the upcoming conventions.  There are four pairings of a democrat vs. a republican, and people are asked who's speech they would rather hear in each case.  People strongly favored the republican in each case.  However, the democrat who did best was " Whoever John Kerry names as his Vice-President ", with 42% of those polled wanting to hear the unnamed man over Cheney.  Only 37% of those who responded would rather hear Kerry than Bush, and only 31% would rather hear Ted Kennedy over Arnold Schwarzenegger.    This isn't flattering to the Democratic leadership or Dick Cheney.

      You thought my Dick Cheney impersonation was pessimistic?  The Vice President is the Platonic Form of optimism, Honey, especially when he snarls.  But let me get to your questions,--How optimistic do I feel about the future of my country?  Well, I don't think we're in danger of being overrun by Talibanesque evangelicals any time soon.  There are simply too many of us, too many libertarians, and too many middle-of-the-roaders.  Furthermore, the retrograde swing of the evangelicals will be matched in turn by a greater forward swing by liberals.  We cycle in and out of conservatism and liberalism as an overarching human theme through all the time.  Periods of intellectual light are followed by periods of darkness followed by greater light followed by lesser darkness.  The depth of the conservative evangelical ignorance is not nearly as bad today as it was say during the industrial revolution or the time of the crusades.  The Bush-Cheney take on manifest destiny, albeit too imperialist for my taste, is not nearly as bad as Teddy Roosevelt's and the Rough Riders and he was progressive.  The average conservative in 2004 would look like some wild-eyed raving liberal in most political debates at the turn of the last century.  The progressives of that day were busy trying to stave off prohibition, eliminate boss-style government corruption, and create basic healthy working conditions for women not fighting for gay rights and universal health care.  The general trend is toward liberalism, toward human rights and justice--but it's not a straight line, it's a curvey line, a sine wave, where over the short term (that of a mere human life) the curve may move down (ignorant conservatism) or it may move up (intellectual liberalism).  Over the generations it is moving in the direction of enlightened knowledge and a growing self-awareness as a humanity.    Are we in the midst of a short-run downturn?  So it seems.  But that is to be expected coming off the rebellious Sixties and self-indulgent Seventies.  So take heart my thoughtful, kindhearted friend, it won't last long.  Ultimately people see through the hate-filled garbage as we move inexorably forward to truth.

      I don’t like your negative tone.  If you were really Dick Cheney, you would know that the Bush administration is all about optimism.  Pessimism never created a new job, you know.  Haven’t you seen the ads?  So, let’s talk about optimism.  Imagine for a moment, that you are a woman.  Settle down, Lou -  This isn’t the usual fantasy where you work at a truck stop and your name is Dusty Vienna.  You are a woman in Iraq.  You were cautiously optimistic when the Americans invaded.  You didn’t want to be colonized, but were glad to be rid of Saddam Hussein.   One of the few rights that you had under Hussein was the right to wear western clothes, and go about your business in public uncovered.  Now, however, radicals in your town are intimidating women who wear western clothes and drive.  Well, you think, there is still a chance.  Our new constitution protects the rights of women, and the Americans have promised to help us build a democratic country, right?  There are supposed to be free elections next year.  Then you learn that women who were registering people to vote in Afghanistan have been killed by the Taliban.  But wait, the Taliban?  Didn’t America liberate Afghanistan?    How optimistic do you feel about the future of your country?

      After reading your last post carefully, twice, I think my response can best be summarized by this simple question-- what ?!  Zola Budd?  Mary Decker? American entanglements?  Oh Margaret, Margaret, Margaret.  What in the name of God are you talking about?  It seems that your lack of steady employment has sapped your ability to make coherent thoughts, or really any sense at all.  So let us indeed forget about 1972 (or 172 as you would have it) and let us instead redirect our attention to the here and now.  Let's, for instance, pretend I'm Dick Cheney.  What would I be doing right now?  It's 6:00 a.m. eastern time, so I'm up, fresh from telling Patrick Leahy to fuck off at a Senate hearing.  Do you know that? Do you know that the Vice President of the United States told Senator Patrick Leahy to fuck off?  Because I didn't know about it until I read it on Aljazeera.net.  According to Aljazeera, Cheney's spokesperson Kevin Kellems said, "That doesn't sound like language the vice-president would use but there was a frank exchange of views."  So I'm Dick Cheney and I want to have a frank exchange of views with you, Margaret, and if you don't like my opinion you can fuck off or go fuck yourself...to quote the Vice President.  First, let me say, as Vice President of the United States of America, at least the second most powerful man in the world and by some accounts the first...let me just say that it is perfectly fine for me as an American to make huge profits from the stock I have in Halliburton.  That is the American way, people, it's entrepreneurial and if you don't like it you're unAmerican and you can fuck off.  Frankly, my holdings in Halliburton and other companies profiting from the death of soldiers and civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world are none of your business. Done.  Old news.  Let's move on.  Secondly,  Abu Ghraib torture.  It's a non-issue, a non-starter.  The President, and thus I, have complete authority to defy Geneva Conventions and torture whomever is necessary to defend Americans (unless of course, it's Americans dying for Halliburton oil, then it's a non-issue, they don't need to be defended, they're defending me, and time to move on).  Look, these are Arab infidels who subjugate their women, rape and pillage, practice terror, et cetera, et cetera; they deserve the treatment they get and it makes America safe.  Bottom line.  If you don't like it fuck off.  Look, Saddam Hussein is a bad bad man and we had to take him out and take the fight to the terrorists.  Look it's a non-issue that Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction like I said repeatedly before we attacked, it is a non-issue that he had no link to terrorists; what matters is that he's gone and my company is making Iraq safe for lovers of freedom and democracy, especially those who work for Halliburton.  So fuck off Margaret.  Fuck off all of you who would deign to question me.  This is Dick Cheney saying so long, I have to go get breakfast.

      Dave Wottle?  That’s what you have to say to me:  Dave Wottle?  I’m not quite as old as you, but I remember the 172 Olympics, too.  I remember two things – Mark Spitz winning gold medals and terrorists taking Israeli athletes hostage and ultimately killing them.  I can still picture a masked gunman on a balcony in the Olympic Village.  What’s the metaphor here?  American strength and youth overshadowed by violence in the Middle East.   Some things do not seem to change.  Since you seem to like track, do you remember this one?  In 1984, American midde-distance runner Mary Decker-Slaney bumped into barefoot South African Zola Budd, fell and didn’t finish the race.  America, although richer and better equipped will always get tripped up by entanglements with third world countries.    Enough.  Instead of dwelling in the past, let us look to the future.     Predictions  Someone in the democratic machine will get to the gay rights lobby and convince them not to make gay marriage an issue during the general election.  The Kerry campaign won’t want him to be forced to be too “liberal” by sticking up for gay rights.  Ironic, since he opposes gay marriage.  Although, you might be too liberal for some people if you don’t want gays rounded up and put in camps.   The women’s movement, however, will not go quietly, after having staged a huge national march this year.  Abortion and reproductive rights will be important issues during the campaigns.  Bush will find out that the country is a lot less conservative than he thinks.    Before the election, an American soldier who has served in Iraq will come out with a book that damages the Bush administration.  Question:  Why does Paul Wolfowitz remind me of  a character from a stop-motion, Rankin-Bass Christmas special?

      Dave Wottle.  That's right, Dave Wottle.  You probably didn't think  his  name would be raised to make a point in the 2004 Presidential election, did you? But what else could I do?  Do you remember Dave Wottle?  I do, very clearly.  I remember him because he was kind of goofy looking, he wore a funny hat, and he came from the back of the pack to overtake the leader in a memorable Olympic 800 meter track victory.  That was 1972, I was but a wee teen, Nixon's "plumbers" were committing a legendary break in, the Vietnam War was coming to an ignoble end, and there was Dave Wottle tearing up the track with an unlikely late kick, his ungainly legs propelling him past his tired-out rivals.  So here we are in 2004.  The Republicans are still up to their dirty tricks, we are in the middle of a bleak war in Iraq, and there's John Kerry, hanging back in the pack letting the leader wear himself out.  (The biggest difference between then and now is that I am no longer a teen or wee.)  Look Margaret, ye of the simple-minded strategy, there are three good reasons for Kerry to coast for while:  1) He has less money than the corporately swaddled Bushies so must conserve for a big splash later on  2) "W" will continue to fade and lies about Iraqi will continue to surface  3) Bill Clinton, Michael Moore and the 9/11 Commission will do Kerry's dirty work for him  So relax.  Calm down.  Sit back--you do that so well--and watch as Kerry comes out in full stride after the convention on July 29.

      Kerry has been notably absent from the news in the past few days.  The beheading of an American in Saudi Arabia, Bill Clinton’s book and the initial findings of the 9/11 commission have dominated the news for the past two days.   Clinton is not going away any time soon, and coverage of the hand-over of power to the Iraqis on June 30 is only going to increase.  Virtually the only news coverage that John Kerry has gotten is about his choice for vice-president.  It is ironic that his campaign has been concerned that the person he chooses not overshadow him – Now the whole process is overshadowing him.   This is bad.  Kerry is losing ground; Polls show that dissatisfaction with Bush has leveled off and he is feeding the public lines about how great the economy is.   Kerry has two choices:    Admit that he has been overtaken by events.  Spend some time actually being the junior senator from Massachusetts (he did get some bad press for missing votes). Wait ‘til after July 4th, to give the Iraq hand-over a chance to pass, and then make July his.  Announce the VP, go after Bush on 9/11, torture, and our economy, and make damn sure that the Democratic Convention rips Bush to shreds.  An attempt to wrest attention from present events could backfire.  Nothing could be worse for Kerry than staging some event and having it ignored in favor of one more interview with Clinton.   Realize that with current events, like Chicago traffic, there is never a good time.  No one knows what new story could be around the corner.  There will continue to be Americans kidnapped in the Middle East, and more horrors in Iraq.  Waiting for a slow news day to go after Bush could take until October.  But where is Kerry in commenting on the findings of 9-11 commission about Iraq and Al-Qaeda?  He is missing an opportunity to keep eroding the public’s confidence in Bush and his war in Iraq.    Kerry needs to get in the game, before the Greens’ Convention next week overshadows him, too.

      Is insanity the new communism?  It used to be expedient to dismiss and diminish someone who was against the government by calling him a communist.  Since we vanquished the commies*, that accusation to longer has the same power or cachet.  Michael Moore, Richard Clarke, Dean, Gore -All called insane.    *Who knew that all it would take was one American president standing in front of the Berlin wall and telling them to cut it out to bring down the Soviet Union?  Too bad Nixon didn't think of it.

      Everybody thought Newt Gingrich was loony too.  He was so far out there and pushed the edges with such vigor that he had to quit congress.  That's exactly what the Democrats need more of.  Our party has been so weakened that we would consider selecting a Republican to share the ticket with our presidential nominee.  (I'll state for the record now that if Kerry picks McCain or any other Republican I'll quit the Democratic Party and vote for Nader.) The problem is that too few on the Democrat side are willing to risk being called lunatics.  Why is Gore out of control for calling for the resignations of top Bushies when the Economist, perhaps the leading journal of political thought in the world, published on their cover the words "RUMSFELD RESIGN" after Abu Ghraid?  Why are not more of our Democratic leaders saying the same thing?  It is because they are afraid of losing their cushy congressional seats.  Oh, they'll tell you that it's because they can do more to fight the wrongs of this administration from the inside, but the truth is they don't want to lose the donations, the power, and the prestige.  Yet if any government in the recent history of the U.S. should be on the hot seat to resign it should be this one.  They lied and continue to lie about Iraq's involvement with 9/11 and Al Qaeda, they lied about weapons of mass destruction, they were asleep at the helm when the attacks occurred, their response to the attacks was chaotic, misdirected and cowardly, they created a culture of acceptance for torture and prison abuse, their actions have increased the danger that we as Americans live under, they have made our nation the pariah of the world, they have bungled the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, and outed a CIA operative as punishment for disagreement with their policies.  They have used the pretext of war to limit our freedoms, jail people indefinitely without representation, and to pre-emptively declare war on other nations not presenting a threat to our own.  The Bush administration and the Neoconservative imperialists that guide it are a menace to our nation's democracy and a menace to peace and justice in the world.  If our Democratic Party leaders will not denounce them in the strongest most vitriolic terms then who shall?

      I just finished looking at the first round of results of a survey of progressive voters being done by WeCount.Org.  Their purpose is to prove to Kerry that he can get more votes, and beat Bush by going more to the left.   One of the questions asks who Kerry could include in his cabinet to make him more attractive.  Ironically, John McCain’s name came up over and over.  This from supposed “progressives”!  John McCain seems like a sincere and moral man and his name is on my website as one of the Republicans that I don’t hate.  But for god’s sake people, he is a Republican.  He is not pro-choice.  He’s campaigning for Bush.  What does he have to do to prove to people that he is a Republican?  Bi-partisan appointments can be good for any administration – It acknowledges that talent may exist in both parties, and that every president has to govern the people who did not vote for him as well as those who did.  Clinton’s Secretary of Defense was a Republican.  But, McCain for Vice-President?  Again, I’m not just referring to the media, I’m referring to the progressive survey results.  For every person who wanted to see Kucinich or Noam Chomsky in the Kerry administration, there was someone mentioning McCain.  How devoid of leadership are we in the democratic party that this is happening?    Fill out the survey to pull Kerry to the left at www.wecount.org/survey.cfm.

      On the contrary, the conservative media hasn't ignored Al Gore.  Because he spoke passionately and called for resignations of top Bush staff and Bush's impeachment, he is being portrayed in the media as "unhinged" and dangerously close to a breakdown.  I strayed into a conservative blog this evening, where people were suggesting that the best campaign ad Bush could run was footage of Gore's speech with a reminder to the public that this was the democrat's idea of a great canidate in 2000.   I saw his speech and said "Where was that guy in 2000?".  Not everyone shares my assessment.   So, why should someone take a bullet for the party, like Dean or Gore, when the result is being labeled insane?  It sure doesn't look like anyone else from the party is coming forward to defend Gore.  The vice-presidential hopeful that is by far the most popular with the public is Edwards. And what is the word that is most often applied to him?  Optimistic. That's what people want - A handsome, upbeat guy to look at, to forget about what a train wreck our country is headed for if we continue to be in conflict with the Muslim world.    I sure don't want to look at Tom Vilsack for four years.

      Well we're at it, if Kerry picks a Black guy to be his runningmate we could get him into a little one-on-one hoops contest with Colin Powell.

      Newt Gingrinch didn't get elected president, Pat Buchanon didn't get elected president but their roles were instrumental in pushing the debate to the right.  Dems can't be satisfied with filling the middle ground they've left behind, especially if it's moving in the wrong direction or, in this case, the right direction.  We need some people pushing the envelop the other way and that can't be the sole job of Ralph Nader, a man that most people see as kind of wacky anyways or of Dennis Kucinich a man that most people see as kind of wacky anyways.  Nobody in the Democratic Party is willing to take a bullet for the greater cause.  We need some people, mainstreamers, out there screaming and hollering and calling the neoconservatives by their real name which is imperialists.  Al Gore has been attempting to fill this role of late but a convsersatively biased media hardly pays attention.  Freedom Voice America...Voice of America...what was the name of Al Franken's radio program?...it has fallen on deaf ears.    The most effective voice for the liberal has been Michael Moore and, quite frankly, he strikes me as a little wacky.  Where's Hillary Clinton's voice on universal health care?  Why is she not denouncing Bush and the insurance industry.  Where is Tom Daschel's voice against the war in Iraq?  Why is there not a call for Bush's impeachment?    It's because these middle-of-the-roaders are afraid to be defeated.  But until somebody starts fighting back we will continue to lose ground.

      Crossfire had a feature today about Family Circle Magazine’s cookie recipe competition between Laura Bush and Teresa Heinz Kerry. Hillary Clinton had to make cookies back in the early ‘90’s to prove that she wasn’t an intellectual, feminist snob.  When will it stop?  Why are these women participating in this ridiculous sideshow?  There is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman taking care of her family and friends and baking.  Sure, it’s flattering to be asked for a recipe – I myself am often asked for my recipe for  baba ganouj.  But, women are more than their cooking skills and asking the first lady and her potential replacement for recipes is silly.   Why not ask them to face off on something a little more intellectual, yet still close to a woman’s heart, like child care, domestic violence or crime?   As long as we are indulging in gender pigeon-holing, I’d like John Kerry and George Bush to come over and put up some shelves for me. I let you know who's the better man.

      Yes to both parts of the dichotomy. Yes. Yes. And Yes.  Yesterday, George Bush was freely wearing his political heart on his sleeve, bragging to his constituents that he is fighting the good fight to keep activist judges from making gay marriage legal.  Meanwhile, the Democrats are unwilling to be as straightforward.  Going back to my example from the Democratic debates, I always suspected that Kerry was passing the buck to the states to avoid saying he actually supports gay marriage, while Edwards was doing the same to avoid saying he doesn’t.  (I don’t know this for a fact, just a gut feeling). So yes, I would like to see a Democrat with guns blazing, just once.   On the other hand, people credit Clinton’s election and success to the fact that he “governed from the middle”, and moved the Democratic party away from its left wing.   Look at your example of Dean, who was both passionate and tried to move to the left;  The media took him apart and people believed it. He is insane, after all.   I mean, he actually got excited, showed emotion and raised his voice when he was talking to a group of his supporters.  What kind of man does that?  So, maybe it's smart to play everything from the middle.  Nader's not going to be President of the United States with 6 - 10% of the vote, after all.  Speaking of full in the belly, according to MSNBC, four of Kerry’s potential VPs are millionaires.  The poorest is Bill Nelson, from Florida, worth only $1.8 - $7 million.

      Is it that the Republicans are bad people for using volatile wedge issues to divide the country around wrongly posited moral issues or that the Democrats can't stick to their guns or take a stand or, preferably, take a stand with their guns drawn when faced with republican dirty dealing?  Isn't that why everyone liked Dean?  Because he didn't back down or compromise his stated beliefs...the beliefs he thought could energize a disaffected youth?  Isn't that why Ralph can still get 6-10% of the vote, because he doesn't mince words?  It's like the Pledge of Allegiance issue.  As liberals we're forced to argue around the edges...take out the "under god" statement and then it's okay for our children to be forced to recite a jingoistic pledge to our nation.  We can't argue that an amendment or law prohibiting flag burning is wrong and bad on its merits, instead we're left to arguing that it's a states rights issue.    So here's the sad state of our national political affairs: on one side you have bellicose imperialist neocons trying to lead us into a new world war and on the other you have a spineless, leaderless liberals too full in the belly to put up a fight.

      The Republicans are at it again with an amendment to the constitution to ban flag burning.  I have never burned an American flag in my life and I don’t plan on it now.  However, I like living in a country where people can.  Nazis punish people for destroying symbols, not Americans.   So much for the party that doesn’t like big government.  You can’t say that the Republicans are truly about states’ rights and the Democrats are about federalism any more.  It’s just a question about what is important to each party.   The Republicans are perfectly happy to make something a federal issue when it suits them. They are the ones in favor of constitutional bans on flag burning, abortion, and gay marriage.  So, they can be pretty excited about the power of the federal government when it suits them.  On the other hand, one of the highlights of the Democratic candidates debates earlier this year was when Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich were asked about gay marriage.  All four said “States’ rights issue”.  It was pretty funny, seeing all these guys pass the hot potato to the states to avoid having to make a firm statement about gay marriage.

         MSNBC yesterday featured two pundits talking about all the things that Reagan was unaware of before he died:&nbsp; He didn't know about the war in Iraq!&nbsp; He didn't know we were attacked on September 11!    Next on MSNBC - Events Reagan didn't participate in because he wasn't born:  The War of 1812!&nbsp; He wasn't a gladiator in the Roman circus!&nbsp; He never sailed with Erik the Red!

      There has been nothing on the news all day except Ronald Reagan dying, World War II (We won!) and the Scott Peterson trial.  I thought, "There has to be something of substance on C-Span.  Maybe it's Tony Blair taking questions from Parliament.  I love that."  C-Span is showing Lyndon Johnson's funeral from 1973.  What is wrong here?

      Al Sharpton, Theresa Heinz Kerry, Bill Clinton,  Obama , Kerry, I mean I'm sold!&nbsp; Tonight I watched (online of course, I don't have cable and don't receive PBS) Kerry's daughter, the Band of Brothers and Kerry's speeches, but thus far I've been watching the videos each night when I get home from my computer.&nbsp;   I grew up a democrat.&nbsp; My grandfather signed up as a Marine at a very young 17, got shot through the head but managed to come home, go through college and law school in 5 years with the help of the GI Bill, was elected a magistrate and eventually became an many-time elected judge.&nbsp; Though he was supposed to be impartial, I can remember going to his chambers and seeing donkey figurines everywhere, and a rock on his desk that said "the buck stops here," a tribute to one of his favorite presidents that happened to be the only Missourian ever elected to office.&nbsp; I remember watching the '84 and '88 conventions at my grandparents house, watching him yell at George Bush Senior when he was running against Dukakis, and loudly exclaiming to my parents that it wasn't fair that&nbsp;just because I was 8 I couldn't vote for Dukakis.&nbsp;   When my grandfather was still sitting on the bench I fawned&nbsp;continuously over this one figurine he had, a donkey with a garland of flowers around his neck, pink and prancing.&nbsp; He gave me the figurine, and I carried it with me through college, and the summer that I graduated from college, the summer that he died, I broke that figurine.&nbsp; With my grandfather's passing my feelings of connection to the democratic party, so tragically symbolized with the breaking of that cute "ass," dissipated, and I became so disillusioned with politics that I disliked both parties with equal fervor.   I cried during Obama's speech, laughed with glee at Bill Clinton's speech, discovered a new role model in Teresa Kerry, clapped my hands and shouted "rock on!" when Sharpton spoke, then sat in misty-eyed contemplation at his words on Ray Charles, because I'd never heard that version of America the Beautiful before, and had never had the chance to think about what those words must have meant to him.&nbsp; I've never been able to completely shake off this cloak of faith in the ideals and philosophy of America, this weighty feeling that I had been born into a country that had tremendous untapped potential.&nbsp; But I had seen the majestic mountains, and had been privilege to have a&nbsp;caring and devoted family and good schooling.&nbsp; My ever-idealistic streak has traditionally hidden under a cloak of cynicism, and I feel ashamed all the sudden.&nbsp; Here's this man, Ray Charles, who had every reason to see only the dark side of American life, and the only memories I have of him are of him with a smile so wide, so cheerful and spirited.&nbsp; What right do I have to be cynical?  After Kerry's speech tonight I called my dad.&nbsp; He and I have had a very open dialogue about most everything for a very long time, and was thus expecting my phone call.&nbsp;&nbsp;He and I both share this sometimes-overly&nbsp;empathetic spirit, and we've worked each other up in a dither these past few years, arguing and getting agitated and excited.&nbsp; He's incensed that the networks didn't carry the convention, and that cable didn't carry most of it, and that most Americans didn't have any kind of access to any but one or two of the speeches.&nbsp; The only reason I saw Barack Obama was because he's running in Illinois.&nbsp; He wasn't shown everywhere by any means.&nbsp; Dad got all choked up because he heard on NPR today that aljazeera was showing more of the conventions than our own media, and throughout the whole conversation he kept repeating, "what the hell are we doing?"&nbsp; He told&nbsp;me that he was going to the Kerry office in St Louis on Saturday, and that&nbsp;he was mad at me for not doing getting more involved, even telling me that he might just buy me that cutie-baby doll Kerry*Edwards tee if I'd do some volunteer work.&nbsp;   So in a roundabout way, I guess what I'm coming down to is that George W Bush has stirred up a hornets nest.&nbsp; I feel like the democratic party is more united than it has been in my entire life, and even if Bush gets re-elected there's been a swelling here of historic proportions, and I'm beginning to have faith that it won't be easily quelled.&nbsp; My dad said he hadn't felt this excited about anything since the Vietnam war, and all the sudden I'm identifying with a party that I'd felt previously felt alienated by and feel compelled to claim for my own this brand of optimism that's being peddled on every corner.&nbsp; A friend of mine is taking the copy of Outfoxed loaned to me and is making copies to pass out to friends willy-nilly, Puff Daddy is wearing t-shirts that say "vote or die", and moveon.org, blogs, and meetups are changing the way Americans and the world&nbsp;think about themselves, and most importantly, making everyone re-think the concept of community and what their place in it should be.&nbsp;   You missed one of the best lines, I think, of Al Sharpton's speech.&nbsp; He said "Life's not about where you start, but where you goin'."&nbsp; And for some reason that made me think of the Microsoft tagline, "where do you want to go today?"&nbsp; It's not a bad question for me to be asking of myself.&nbsp; Starting tomorrow, after I get some sleep.&nbsp;

      The guests from my convention-watching party just left, so I haven’t had time to synthesize my thoughts about Kerry.&nbsp; Overall, my guests and I thought he did a great job.&nbsp; Random thoughts:  I think that I was channeling P.J. O’Rourke when I was crabby about Edwards yesterday.   One of my guests said he wants Obama to adopt the phrase “Obama-rama”.  The same guests said that Kerry’s daughters are hotter than the Bush girls.&nbsp; As a feminist, I feel that I should object to this, but I’m too tired.   Either I had a stroke during the Kerry biography video, or sometimes Teresa just doesn’t make sense.&nbsp;   “Cornball” was the word a guest applied to Kerry’s statement that he was reporting for duty.   The highlight of the evening for me was the hamster story.&nbsp;   The surprise favorite from the whole convention, amongst people I have spoken with is Jimmy Carter.&nbsp; Nixon’s reputation was rehabilitated, for God’s sake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that history will remember Carter with the respect that he deserves.

      Ok – This is not the entry I expected to be writing.&nbsp; My primary concern over the past couple of days was how I was going to blog after Edwards’ speech without sounding like a column in Tiger Beat Magazine:&nbsp; He’s so great!&nbsp; He's so cute!&nbsp; I love his smile!&nbsp; Great hair!&nbsp;   Well, perhaps it’s because I’ve heard The Two Americas speech before, but I wasn’t swept away by Edwards as I had expected to be.&nbsp; Sharpton, Clinton and Obama were more energizing.&nbsp; While JRE was reviewing his life story, which those of us who paid attention before the convention know by heart, my mind had time to wander and I couldn’t help going back to the fact that although a millionaire, he gets to be “the poor one”.&nbsp; John, stop licking your lips so much and get some Chapstick™.&nbsp; It’s not professional.&nbsp; And stop the up-talk, that annoying habit that Generation X popularized of people raising their voices at the end of a statement that is not a question.   I’m glad to hear that he and Kerry are going to raise the minimum wage.&nbsp; He also said that they are going to finish the job on welfare reform.&nbsp; I’m afraid of what that might mean, since welfare reform has gotten people off of welfare without getting them out of poverty and has successfully cut off many women for administrative reasons, not because they are working.&nbsp; And we can’t blame the Republicans for that, because welfare reform passed under Clinton.&nbsp; To be fair, he has said that he had to compromise drastically to get something passed, so the end result was not his ideal.&nbsp; I hope that finishing welfare reform means fixing it, like the tax credit for child care that Edwards mentioned.   There have been some memorable catch phrases that have come out of conventions in the past:&nbsp; “Where’s the beef?”&nbsp; “Where was George?” &nbsp;I don’t see “It doesn’t have to be that way” joining their ranks.&nbsp;   Best lines (I do like the end of the Two Americas speech):&nbsp; “There will always be heart ache and struggle …and people of good will can make a difference.”  “No forever to any American working full time and living in poverty.”   He is cute.

      The pundits are already saying that he was too negative and too critical of Bush, because Kerry wants to run a positive campaign.&nbsp; Let’s pause for a moment to enjoy the fact that Bob Dole, not exactly Little Mary Sunshine himself, is criticizing someone for being negative.&nbsp; This also ignores the fact that the crowd loved Sharpton.&nbsp; I don’t see how the Kerry is going to run against Bush if no one but Michael Moore is going to point it out when Bush is wrong.&nbsp; Sharpton never attacked Bush’s family, went after his personal history or hit below the belt.&nbsp; But he did talk about the fact that the Republicans simply don’t help working people the way Democrats do.&nbsp; Note that I did not say don’t care as much:&nbsp; Republicans will say that they do care about the poor and I believe that some of them do.&nbsp; So, at their convention we are going to see &nbsp;pretzel logic to explain how tax cuts for the rich benefit the poor, how cutting welfare helps the poor (I think it has something to do with giving them self-respect) and how English-only helps the poor.&nbsp; Look for a Hispanic speaker to rebut Sharpton’s defense of Spanish speakers by talking about how much better his life is because he speaks English, or how learning English was the only way that his mother could put food on the table.&nbsp;   Sharpton is one of many Democrats who have already quoted one of our important patriotic documents or songs, such as America the Beautiful and the Declaration of Independence.&nbsp; It’s a nice move, because it makes the Republicans copy cats if they do the same, which you know they want to.&nbsp; It also makes me curious about the Republican response.&nbsp;   Best Lines:&nbsp; “The issue of government is not regulating behavior in the bedroom, it’s guaranteeing the right to provide food in the kitchen.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Sharpton knew its was his best line, because he said it twice  “We never got our 40 acres and a mule [from the Republicans] so we are riding that donkey as far as it will take us”

      Ron Reagan   I find Ron Reagan to be an appealing speaker. He’s got his father’s skill in projecting a home-spun kind of quality, a “We’re all friends here” feeling, but he doesn’t sacrifice intelligence to get it. &nbsp; Like his father, he is also not afraid to make an issue black and white, comparing reason and ignorance, and compassion and ideology on the stem cell issue.&nbsp;   Best Lines: &nbsp;“Some are grinding a political axe and they should be ashamed”  Future generations will judge us harshly if “we knew better and did nothing”   Chris Heinz   Cute jokes.&nbsp;

      I think I have to take back part of what I said yesterday, about the Clintons not supporting the Kerrys, because Hillary appeared to be scowling at the end of Teresa's speech.&nbsp; She looked unmoved during the speech, but I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she was just concentrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am grateful to Barack Obama for mentioning Galesburg, Illinois, in his convention speech.&nbsp; Galesburg, where my father lives, has been devastated by Maytag moving their operations to Mexico.&nbsp; 3,000 people are losing their jobs and the effects are rippling though the community.&nbsp; The real estate market has tanked, because so many people are trying to sell, so that they can move to look for another job, instead of staying, as Barack said “To compete with their children for $7.00 an hour jobs”.&nbsp; My parents’ home, which has been on the market for over a year, is going to go for less than the same price they paid for it ten years ago, probably $50,000 less than it would have gotten if they had sold before Maytag made their announcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The point is not the financial loss to my parents, but the fact that when the working class suffers, the middle class and upper middle class suffer, too.&nbsp; This is what people who support Bush don’t get.&nbsp; How long&nbsp;will it take the rich to figure out that they need the rest of the country to buy their goods and services and indeed to support the markets - Real estate, financial and labor?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obama put it far more eloquently than I am now, when he talked about how we are all diminished when one suffers.&nbsp; What makes me proud of the Democrats is that this part of his speech got the biggest applause out of everything he said.&nbsp;   Best Line:&nbsp; “Out of this long political darkness, a brighter day will come”&nbsp;

      Tonight puts to rest the rumors that Bill and Hillary weren’t going to give their all for John Kerry, because they want Hillary to be the nominee in 2008.&nbsp;   Looking far less puffy than he used to, WJC cranked up the charm and demonstrated why the Republicans hate him – He steals their issues and play their games better than they do.&nbsp; The draft dodger had the nerve to bring up Kerry’s service in Viet Nam. The&nbsp;immoral scoff- law talked about the Democrats as the law and order party:&nbsp; More police on the streets and a ban on assault weapons, both of which are being reversed by the GOP.&nbsp; Not many people could talk about being in the richest 1% of the population without making you resent them, but Clinton did it and used it as an effective tool to compare how a multi-millionaire benefits from the Bush tax cuts to the detriment of the poor.&nbsp;   Best lines:&nbsp; “As you might remember, the Republicans were kind of mean to me”.  "Strength and wisdom are not opposing values." I wish I could write something about Hillary’s speech, but I was reading my email and only half paying attention.&nbsp; But she did mention John Kerry and John Edwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      MoveOn is asking its members what the key issues are facing the United States right now.&nbsp; After careful thought, I have decided that the key issues fall into justtwo areas.&nbsp; Everything else is subsumed by them:  &nbsp;  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loss of family supporting jobs.  &nbsp;  Thanks to deindustrialization, NAFTA and the loss of union power, there are fewer jobs that allow a person to support a family.&nbsp; The days when a person with a high school diploma could count on getting an apprenticeship in a factory that would lead to middle class wages are almost gone.&nbsp; The town where my father lives is reeling from the loss of 3,000 jobs because Maytag is moving operations to Mexico.&nbsp; How are people supposed to support themselves with part-time jobs at Wal-Mart?&nbsp; &nbsp;How can they buy enough to fuel the economic engine of the country?&nbsp; If the private sector is not going to provide jobs that let Americans meet their basic needs, then the government is going to have to step in and provide health insurance, child care, elder care, housing and food subsidies so that people can get up everyday and go to their minimum wage jobs. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The effects of the loss of family supporting jobs are far-reaching.&nbsp; It has contributed to the increase in homelessness and use of social services even by those with homes.&nbsp; It leads to crime, substance abuse, and violence.&nbsp; It leads to a lower tax base, which contributes to the decline of schools and neighborhoods and dooms another generation to depression and struggle.  &nbsp;  There are two ways to pay:&nbsp; Give people a decent wage with health insurance so they can take care of themselves, or support a government and social service bureaucracy to take care of them and make them beggars in their own country.  &nbsp;  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bigotry.  &nbsp;  The reason that the government and society tolerates the above and other injustices is bigotry and prejudice.&nbsp; The people in power don’t care about problems that affect the Alien Others that they believe have nothing to do with them:&nbsp; African-Americans, immigrants, poor women. gays.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Illinois, for example, Black men in Chicago are incarcerated a rate multiple times that of white men, and sent downstate to prisons that are built as economic development tools for white areas.&nbsp; Substitute Detroit for Chicago and the Upper Peninsula for downstate and you have the same example in Michigan.&nbsp; Schools have been allowed to deteriorate in neighborhoods of color for decades.&nbsp; Women still work for less money than men get at the same jobs.&nbsp; Gay people can’t get married and some people out there still believe that AIDS is God’s punishment for their “lifestyle choice”, as phrase that makes it sound as though they decided to live downtown, rather than in the suburbs.  &nbsp;  When Americans care about each other, regardless of race, religion, class, sex or sexual orientation, then problems like bad schools, bad jobs and bad housing will disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      You are right that one ought not necessarily disregard the message because the messenger is an idiot or heinous bigot.&nbsp; However, one certainly should consider the motives of those who make fantastical claims when those claims do more to support their justifications for hatred than to support reality.  &nbsp;  I do not&nbsp;know for certain if a jumbo jet carries enough fuel and force to topple a giant skyscraper or what should remain on the ground after a plane crashes.&nbsp; This requires a knowledge base that I don't have.&nbsp; However, what I read on the web pages of those Holocaust revisionist groups did nothing to make me believe that an airplane could not topple a building.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I saw on television were planes flying&nbsp;into buildings,&nbsp; fires becoming so intense&nbsp;that the structural beams melted, and the weight of the crumbling material above the crash area causing the collapse of the entire buildings.&nbsp; This scenario, without the introduction of additional explosives, does not seem far fetched to me in the least.  &nbsp;  I also do not think it is unusual in an explosion for random elements to be flung free of damage.&nbsp; Shrapnel is an example of this phenomena.&nbsp; The remains of a firecracker another.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no knowledge of anyone finding a passport&nbsp;at the crash sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be remarkable if that occurred but hardly enough evidence to call into question obvious and visible facts.  &nbsp;  Although I agree that this administration has cozied up to&nbsp;some fanatical far right Christian&nbsp;groups and that they echo&nbsp;their evangelical apocalyptic prophesy, I believe they do this more for political expediency than out of&nbsp;honest belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, as rotten as this administration is, I do not believe for a minute that they would directly cause&nbsp;atrocity against their own countrymen.&nbsp; Were they asleep at the wheel?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Did they use the events of 9-11 to justify their long-held desire to invade Iraq?&nbsp; Clearly.&nbsp; Did they plot the destruction of the World Trade Center and murder of thousands to achieve their agenda?&nbsp; No way.  &nbsp;  I also doubt the claims on the web pages of these insidious Jew-haters who would have us believe that U.S. insiders caused 9-11,&nbsp;because I have heard no other reliable source make the claim.&nbsp; There are millions of reasonable, intelligent Americans who despise this administration for their deceit&nbsp;and who are looking for any shred of evidence to prove their guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the claims on these web pages were true, someone else would be pointing it out.  &nbsp;  The final point I'd like to make&nbsp;takes into consideration a scientific notion I know you are aware of about the simplest explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look to explain a phenomena, start with and expect the simplest solution, it is usually the correct one and is the best place to start.  &nbsp;  I am very pleased to see that you have joined&nbsp;our little foray.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       First, allow me to thank you, albeit with admittedly slight reservations, for this invitation.&nbsp; While I'm slightly intimidated by&nbsp;your delicious and sharp&nbsp;wits, I'll do my best not to embarrass you too much, and I promise to keep my mouth shut to the&nbsp;best of my ability.  &nbsp;  Secondly, Lou,&nbsp;I appreciate you dampening your criticism by calling me a pretty girl, a comment that I accept with my so-called engaging smile despite deep-seeded suspicions that I'm getting patted on the head.&nbsp; But I have to say that to a certain extent, I feel that you're so intent on making sure that you stay away from the anti-Semitic title that you're ignoring some of the more valid points brought up in the article, particularly more of the points sited in the"Was the Laws of Physics Different on September 11" article that I highlighted.&nbsp; While some of these articles had a definite anti-Semitic tone to it, don't you find many main-stream news clips and articles to have a definite anti-Islamic tone to it?&nbsp; Jew-haters are extremely repugnant and frightening&nbsp;but so too is Muslim-haters, Catholic-haters, Socialist-haters, and their ilk.&nbsp; Our president and attorney general are Farwell supporters, who I saw on network television pre-war stating that by invading Iraq, the United States was perpetuating biblical prophecy stating that the return of Christ had to come after the fall of historical Assyria, today's Iraq and Syria.&nbsp; Bush himself uses apocalyptic language and gets his information from notoriously unreliable sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a moral debate, this can't get much more heated&nbsp;- can you accept medical findings that came out of Nazi-Germany despite the evilness of where the information came from, or does morality preclude that that information has to be ignored? Do you unequivocally refuse to listen to the content of things being said, just because the source is repugnant? &nbsp;I've never been able to determine my own stance on that moral question.  &nbsp;  My point is not and never was that these articles are correct and speak the truth, but that some the questions raised have merit and deserve some discussion.&nbsp; Is it scientifically possible for those two planes to have brought down those two towers like they did, without the aid of some kind of explosives either on the planes or on the site?&nbsp; Isn't it remarkable that a single hijacker's passport miraculously managed to have escaped the crash, and float down to be found less than a day after the whole thing happened among however many tons of wreckage?&nbsp; One of the items found in one of the hijackers hotel rooms was a flying manual&nbsp;- a basic flying manual from what I understand, as in a "pull-back on wheel to gain altitude" basic flying manual, one that I would imagine most individuals who have pilot licenses would have little use for.&nbsp; It's like a quantum physicist carrying around a college freshman's Physics 101 book.&nbsp; Or how about them managing to find DNA evidence on the plane passengers&nbsp;- if this blaze was so intense, what are the real chances of that kind of biological evidence managing to survive it?&nbsp; Some of these are fair and important questions that should be asked, despite who raises them.  &nbsp;  All I'm asking if for you to go beyond the accusations to look at what's being asked, which are just as far to raise as those who questioned the WMD excuse for attacking Iraq.&nbsp; As of yet, I don't think that the evidence, the reason, and the knowledge stacks up so high as to be irrefutable as the earth being round.&nbsp; I'm most impressed that you're so comfortable with your chemistry, physics, and biology to say that you are.     Alright, ready for my next pat on the head [insert curtsy here].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Lyra

      Now I think I've been too hard on the democratic party for our lack of leaders.  The Illinois Republican Party is actually thinking about running Mike Ditka for Senate.  His qualifications are that he used to tell people what to do, and hey, being Senator isn't much different.  Also, he is white.

      ON June 25 I wrote a blog to you the gist of which was that the problem with Democrats today is that they continuouly run and hide from their own belief system because they're afraid of scaring away the middle.  What the Republicans did under the leadership of guys like Newt Gingrich is use the far right to push the debate so far from the center that the center is the only safe place for Democrats to be.  It boggles my mind that Bush and his lackeys paint Kerry-Edwards as "too far outside the mainstream."  Kerry-Edwards epitomize the mainstream, yet there they are, the neo-cons and their vast echo chamber, labeling them fanatical liberals.  We Democrats are so afraid of our own shadows that we don't even want to be called Clinton-Democrats when Clinton was arguably the most popular president in the past 30 years.  Since Nixon, none of the Presidents more consistently polled higher approval ratings and only Bush Senior averaged higher over the course of his term.  Clinton's approval ratings (according to Gallop Polling data presented on the Roper Center web site) average out over his two terms to be 56%; Only Bush Sr. beats him at 62%; Reagan was 52%; Carter 47%; Ford 46%; and Nixon 48% over the course of their respective terms.  Moreover at the end of their terms (counting the last 3 months) Clinton's ratings were 63%; Bush Sr. 43% (explaining his loss); Reagan 56%; Carter 34%; Ford 49%; and Nixon 26% (explaining why he had to leave office early.)  George the lesser's approval ratings have averaged at 59% over the course of his term, largely due to 9-11, but have fallen steadily since and are about 50% in the past three months.  Dems have to embrace Clinton...okay I'll leave the jokes to you.

      I’m somewhat peevish today.   New Democrats Online (http://www.ndol.org)has an article about how great Kerry and Edwards are, which calls them  Blair Democrats .  Evidently, we are so lacking for role models in the Democratic Party, that we can only compliment our leaders by harkening to the heads of other countries.  This irritates me.  Has anyone noticed that Tony Blair supports Bush’s war?    What they really want to say, of course, is Clinton Democrats, (because their point is about governing from the center and not being “too liberal”), but no politician wants that epithet, or his wife will want to have him followed and the press will oblige.  No one wants to be a Roosevelt Democrat, because that would be admitting that the government is ok and actually helps people.  Truman Democrat – Not sexy.  Johnson Democrat – Definitely not sexy, plus Viet Nam association is bad.  I have heard the phrase “Wilson Democrat” a couple of times, to indicate that Kerry is a conservative internationalist, but what else are you  saying about yourself if you don the mantle of a man who governed almost 100 years ago?  That you approve of hem-lines that show women’s ankles and that you wept for the boys at Ypres?   Can we call Bush a King Fahd Republican?

      Who didn't see this coming? This is an exerpt from a longer article.   Saturday, July 10, 2004 Pentagon: Bush Military Records Destroyed WASHINGTON (AP) - Military payroll records that could more fully document President Bush's whereabouts during his service in the Texas Air National Guard were inadvertently destroyed, according to the Pentagon.  In a letter responding to a freedom of information request by The Associated Press, the Defense Department said that microfilm containing the pertinent National Guard payroll records was damaged and could not be salvaged. The damaged material included payroll records for the first quarter of 1969 and the third quarter of 1972.

      The first thing I think of when I hear people talking about delaying the election in case of a terrorist attack is “This has to be the Republicans trying to work this to their advantage.”  I have images of living under martial law, the Bush administration’s power extended indefinitely, ‘til the national crisis is over.  Patriot Acts V, VI, and VII all rushed through emergency sessions of Congress.  I believe Syria has been under martial law due to national emergency for twenty years.   However, given a little time to reflect, I can come up with reasons why I would want the election denied.  If there is an attack just a few days before the election, like there was in Spain, there will be very little time for Kerry to reassure the public about his ability to deal with the crisis.  My fear is that people who are only faintly pro-Kerry now and the fence-sitters would be scared back in to the Republican camp (We need a strong leader!  Don’t change horses in mid-stream!)  So, it might work to our advantage to postpone an election in this event.  It would give people time to calm down and remember what a fool the president is and that he has created more hatred toward us.  And it would give Kerry time to deploy Edwards, who is obviously the more comforting of the two of them.   However, neither of our sides should be playing politics with a terrorist attack.  That is why even if an attack takes place days before the election, we have to go ahead, so neither side can try to twist it to their advantage.  In addition, exercising our democratic rights, as we always have, would be an important symbol to the world that we were not broken and that America was still America.  But I have only dealt with the semi-manageable scenario, an attack before the election.  What if we are attacked on Election Day?  What if we wake up on Election Day and part of LA has been flattened by a series of well-coordinated bombs?  Does the rest of the nation go ahead and we assume that the survivors in LA can live without voting just this once?  Could you go to the polls the same day that terrorists brought down the Sears Tower?  How would we hold the election if the Loop, where the Board of Elections is, were shut down due to an attack, or the building that houses the Board were damaged?

      Wow, I like your new found optimism.   You're sure it doesn't have anything to do with getting laid?  Okay Okay, relax.  You're right to be optimistic.  One would think that, since the 2000 election with Gore was so close after 8 years of Clinton-hatred and with an energized Republican movement, now there could be no possible way for Americans in the middle to vote Bush-Cheney.  One might argue that the reason polls still show Kerry-Bush virtually lock step is because people that "support the troops" won't say anything bad until they're in the voting booth.  I have to admit that I have fantasies of an election where Kerry-Edwards take 55% of the popular vote and 35 states sweeping them into the oval office where they can purge the Government of neo-con imperialists.  But events have a strange way of turning the hearts of the American electorate.  Bush was doing horribly in the polls until the terrorist attacks, after which he skyrocketed (and then managed to squander world-wide and domestic support anyway).  What happens if there is another attack in September, October or November?  Do Americans go to bat for their Commander-in-Chief even if most recognize that he is a "lying buffoon who is cavalier with American lives," to quote a dear friend of mine.  Or worse, could these monsters postpone elections in the event of a national security crisis?  I don't know.  So maybe it's time for a state-by-state analysis.

      Good Morning, Lou.  Maybe it’s because I got a good night’s sleep, or because I’m going out for Indian food in an hour, or because the sun is shining, but whatever the reason, I am feeling very positive about things today.   For the first time, I feel confident that Kerry is going to win.  I don’t think we can be complacent, but he is going to win.  The evidence keeps piling up that Bush is a lying buffoon who is cavalier with American lives.  The proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is also going to come back to bite him.  While this move may energize his base in the Michigan Militia, in the end, he’s going to lose more people than he gets, because the debate around it is going to expose Bush and his ilk as haters, not as defenders of family values.   In addition, we’ve got the report on the faulty intelligence that was the basis of the argument for going to war in Iraq.   Faulty Intelligence would be a good name for a book about the Bush administration.    Yesterday, I met a man how had served in Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo, who said that veterans are pissed off at W.  For one, they know that they went in without enough troops to do the job, simply because the Bush administration wanted to prove that this was not another Vietnam and could be done with a smaller number of men.  The vets also know that people’s benefits are being cut when they get back.  Finally, they are also mad that Bush has damaged the strength of the military for years to come, by spreading them too thin.  Unfortunately, vets are also pissed at Kerry and Edwards for not voting for the $82 billion last year.  Therefore, the campaign has a lot of work to do to explain to vets that it was impossible, because of the way that appropriations were structured, to protest the government's strategy while still supporting the troops through funding.   Finally, let’s talk about our vice-presidential candidate.  How much do I love him?  He’s young, charming, good-looking and has the little kids, which help to make him Kennedy-esque, but with a better accent.  Kerry has already lightened up after being around JRE for a week.  I imagine the Republicans have out a $10,000 reward for anyone who can produce a paralegal willing to say that John Edwards once slapped her on the ass.   I’m already looking forward to working on the Edwards/Clinton campaign in 2012.

      Here we go.  The day after the Senate releases their scathing report on the bad Iraqi weapons intelligence, Bush's response is to attack Gays.  This is the modern Republican Party.  They lose on real issues like taxation, jobs, and war so stir the pot on wedge issues like abortion and Gay rights in an attempt to solidify their conservative base and lure blue-collar types from the Dems.    Hopefully enough middle-roaders will see through their tactics and either vote Kerry or not vote at all.

      You are right; the nation is almost as divided as it was in the late sixties, when the nation nearly came apart.  Personally, I have lost my cultural relativism.  I can no longer see the Republicans as people who just have a different, but misguided approach to the world from mine.  I no longer care to figure out where they are coming from, or if they might have a point, or if we have some common ground.  They made the decision to polarize back in Gingrich’s heyday.  I was reminded when I read Hillary Clinton’s autobiography that the Republicans shut down the government rather than pass Clinton’s budget.  I think we’ve all forgotten that -  They shut down the government to prove how much they hated Clinton.    They have chosen to demonize the Democratic leadership, so why shouldn’t we demonize them?  Think of how many times that Republican leaders said they were ashamed of Bill Clinton, or that he had brought shame on the country – How does the Monica Lewinsky scandal even compare to the shame that Bush has brought to this country by dragging us into a war based on lies and lining the pockets of his Halliburton and Unocal pals?      How do they always seize the moral high ground?  Bush has been lying non-stop and Cheney has been plotting non-stop since they got into office.  They are corrupt and unrepentant about getting young Americans, Brits and other members of the Coalition of the Willing killed.  They play Orwellian games of alternately claiming that Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda were connected, and then denying they ever said it when confronted with evidence to the contrary.  Yet somehow, they continue to convince at least half the American public that they have better values than John Kerry.    Here’s the thing:  I don’t like living like this.  I don’t like hating people, I don’t like my knee-jerk reaction of disbelief when a Republican opens his mouth and I don’t like my own blind loyalty to the Democratic party, which is such that I would vote for Kerry if he named my cousin, the incarcerated drug dealer, as his Vice-President, and promised to make “The Hokey-Pokey” our national anthem.   I get no thrill from the battle.  I have been painted into a corner.  I am incapable of seeing any shades of grey.  I have become the evil which I beheld.   I'm going to bed.

      A friend of mine wrote a reply to one of my earlier blogs that I have heretofore ignored but to which I would like to now respond.  My friend, an attractive brunette with an engaging smile, is, more to the point, liberal, takes her politics seriously, and doesn't easily take a man at his word...she is after all from the  Show-Me  state, and it shows.  In her reply to my now famous Dick Cheney parody, my young friend asked me to review a hand full of web sites that call the common explanation of the 9-11 attacks into question.  Filled with righteous ardor she burns with suspicion of the powerful, questioning their every word and motive.  She asked me to look at these web pages with perhaps a more judicious eye, that I might assuage her virulent distrust of those entrusted with our protection.  Always wanting to help a pretty girl, I have made a scan of the web pages (see www.thewebfairy.com and www.public-action.com); here are my findings.   In a nut shell (so to speak), the sites all claim and attempt to make the case that the 9-11 attacks were concocted and conducted by American fanatical religious elements hoping to incite a U.S. led war against the Middle-East that might ultimately lead to the creation of Eretz Yisrael, a gigantic Jewish state covering Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the Sinai.  The site authors seem to believe that the aircraft used during 9-11 were controlled remotely from NORAD, the North American airspace control unit of the Department of Defense, and that the planes were packed with explosives.  To quote one of the pages, "There were no Muslim "suicide" pilots on 9-11 --  Muslims had the most to lose.  The jets were controlled by advanced robotics and remote-control technology.  9-11 was an inside job,  executed with the full cooperation of American traitors in the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)."  Carol A. Valentine who runs Public Action, Inc. calls this, "The American coup d'etat and the war for Jewish supremacy."  Where do I begin?  First let me say that I find these Jew-haters repugnant and frightening.  Stay away from them, far away from them.  These are the same lunatics who claim that mass extermination of Jews during World War II is a myth.  Their anger and hatred is so entirely self-consuming and extreme that their mind's logic has become warped beyond sensible recognition.  I find them and their reasoning so alarming and bizarre that I am not going to attempt to refute their argument...nor would I attempt to refute the argument of a madman who claimed the Earth is flat.  The evidence, the knowledge, the reason stacks so high and wide and heavy against such insane pronouncements that the only response I can come up with is, "Look around you and think."    Any intelligent, sane human in 2004 will make a quick and certain conclusion that the Earth is indeed round--a big ball in fact.  Any intelligent and sane human will also quickly discern that the tragic and painful events of September 11, 2001 were perpetrated by a handful of crazy angry militants.

      Okay, I don't want to sink into a game of "How much I dislike George Bush" one-upsmanship, but saying, "I'm not a big fan..." just isn't strong enough.  I know you were employing that wonderfully British sense of understatement Mags, but now is not the time for mincing words and hiding our anger.  I think George Bush stinks.  I think Dick Cheney stinks.  I think Donald Rumsfeld stinks and Condaleeza Rice and Colin Powell and Paul Wolfowitz.  They all stink.  They have stunk since the Reagan administration and the Nixon administration and they stink still.  They are chicken-hawks who have no fear of sending young people to kill other young people with little or no provocation.  They mislead, they money-grub and they lie.  This is the most cynical, despicable administration that I am aware of in the history of the United States.  You can call me a wild-eyed, raving liberal or whatever...that's what I am.  The conservatives get away with it, why can't we?  Rush Limbaugh rants and rants and rants and nobody says, "Look at him going over the edge" and he scuttles off embarrassed into the corner.  No way.  He just rants and rants and ignorant Americans continue to listen and suck up the hate-filled lies that are causing a rift between our countrymen not known since the anti-Vietnam and Black Power movements of the sixties.  I was at a small gathering of friends on July 5, liberals, several gay men and we began talking about F-911 which my wife and I recently saw with our son Alex (3 mos.)  The others in the group talked about how Michael Moore sounded angry and they found that his anger was, I don't know, distasteful.  I didn't say anything at the time because I'd already argued forcefully about another issue and didn't want to come off as a complete bore--but to criticize Moore because he's angry?  Of course he's angry.  The neocons have stolen the country!  "Oh just get over it," they'd say.  No I won't.  They were threatening a constitutional meltdown if the Florida vote call had gone the other way and what do Democrats do?  They scuttle off to their corners too afraid to fight to the end.  Listen and repeat after me Margaret, "George Bush stinks...George Bush stinks...George Bush stinks..."

      About fifteen years ago, I was in England and I spent a day with my two great-aunts, Ella and Flo. As they had so often when I was a child, they took me to Bolton Abbey, on the grounds of a stately home, surrounded by lovely gardens.  After we had spent some time looking at the ruins of the abbey and admiring the flowers and swans, we went into the home of the family that owns the estate.   In the hallway, there were two large statues of a young man and woman in uniform.  My auntie Ella explained that this was a memorial to two children of the family who owned the estate, who had both had been killed in World War II.  The two aunts started talking about the war and how the Germans forced the English to sacrifice the young men and women of their country.  More than forty years later, there was a living bitterness in the way they spoke about people who had died in the war.    So what?  So, today I saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  At least one pundit has already criticized Michael Moore about the footage of the mother whose son died in Iraq.  She blamed George Bush for sending her son to die in a war with no purpose.  The critic questioned whether the American people would have supported the American Revolution if we had known about the suffering of every soldier and every family.  Well, when my aunts were talking about World War II, they never cursed Churchill, they never blamed their government for the deaths of people they knew and they never questioned whether or not it was worth it.   And the reason is because they believed their country had no other choice.  The British didn’t have to go looking for the weapons of mass destruction; they were dropped onto the country from German planes (one fell behind my cousin Louie’s wardrobe).  Americans would feel the same if we thought we hadn’t had a choice about Iraq.  Thank God more and more people are waking up to what’s going on every day.

      If Bush is reelected, will I be thrown in jail when the authorities find out that I have been to the Al-Jazeera web site?    I was just visiting Al-Jazeera and reading comments that people from around the world had made about the Arab-American soldier who was just beheaded.  It was full of warm and fuzzy stuff:  Christians blaming Muslims, Muslims blaming Jews.  Over in Yemen, 100 plus supporters of a renegade cleric have been killed by government forces.  Meanwhile in India, more people have been killed in caste-related violence.    How can you read this and not quote John Lennon?    Imagine there's no countries, It isn’t hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  How much misery in the world was caused by atheists today?  We'd all be better off without religions giving people reasons to kill each other.  Human beings should have evolved far enough by now to behave themselves because it is the healthiest and most adaptive way to behave, not because a father figure in the clouds is going to be mad at you.   Oh, I'm sorry, I mentioned evolution.  If anyone in Georgia is reading this, email and we'll send you a definition.

      I've been too distracted to post anything of significance, because I am writing up my internationally acclaimed training on running good meetings, so that I can post it on my web-site.  I've decided that the greatest thing I can contribute to the Democratic movement is helping people to avoid pointless meetings while organizing for Kerry this fall.  Look for me to be hailed by one and all as a genius and brought on to the Kerry campaign at the national level.  By the way, I accidently signed up on the Kerry website to go to a swing state on election day, so I'll be requesting time off in November.  Hawaii is a swing state, right?

      Here's why I want to be cautious before pronouncing Kerry the winner. Because my dad, if he were alive, would vote for Dubya. He'd vote for Dubya for all the negative reasons...Gays are evil, poor people don't have any rights, there should be no taxation, abortion is a sin, Government is bad, just plain bad.  My dad hated Unions. He thought Unions were the cause of all ill in business, in the rust belt, really in the world. And of course Unions have their problems but without them and without Government intervention my dad would've ended his life making 1930 wages without a pension, without overtime pay, and without emergency fire exits. But Dad never saw it that way.  Unions bad. It was that simple. Gays...bad. Abortion...bad. Arabs...bad. Taxes...bad. There is no gray area. No room for discussion or compromise. It's my way or the highway. Standard, black and white, Republican thinking.  You know what? Even though my wonderful, nurturing, simple, dad is dead, there are millions and millions of people who still think that way and the Republican Party is masterful at playing to their cut and dried point of view.  But, I hope you're right.

      This is why I think Kerry is going to win.  My dad has always been a conservative dude.  He voted for Nixon, Ford, Reagan and George I.  He hates the communists, thinks the government is a bloated bureaucracy, is against rights for undocumented immigrants, and thinks welfare moms just need to get a job.  He is a member of the so-called “Greatest Generation”.   So why can’t the Republicans get his vote?  One word:  Iraq.  I have to give my dad credit where it’s due and say that he only voted for Bush the 1st once, because he eventually realized that GHWB was an idiot.  And he has arrived at the same conclusion about the son, because of his handling of the war on terror.   The more Bush bungles things in Iraq, the more Abu Ghraib-type scandals come to light and the longer it takes to come up with those weapons of mass destruction (remember those?), the more moderate conservatives are going to abandon him.

      One thing that John Kerry talked about was riding his bike through a divided Berlin during the Cold War.  It reminded me of seeing the Iron Curtain when I was thirteen. My family was in Germany for a week during the summer of 1976.  One day, we drove to a place where you could see the divide between East and West Germany.  It was an overcast windy day, perfect atmosphere for our outing.  There were a series of high barbed wire fences that divided the two countries and the free and Communist worlds.  German soldiers of both types kept an eye on each other from watchtowers and a sign reminded people looking from West to East that those on the other side were fellow Germans.  My dad thought it was very important for my sister and me to see this, to impress upon us how lucky we were to live in the United States.   That was the reality that dominated the world of my youth:  The Cold War, the Communist hordes that longed to roll over our country and enslave us, 1984, and the inevitability of an apocalyptic showdown between good and evil, West and East.   Children in the ’60s and ‘70’s believed that we would eventual perish in a Soviet nuclear holocaust.  I have often reflected since September 11, 2001 on how little we understood the powder kegs that the Soviets were sitting on or the problems that were fermenting in the Muslim world.  No one in 1904 could have predicted the political paradigm that would dominate the 20th Century.  At least we already know what the defining problem for the 21st Century is.

      Michael Moore and Bill Maher (HBO libertarian talk show host) literally got down on their knees on Maher's show Friday and begged Ralph Nader not to continue running for President.   Nader continues to assert that he will take more votes from Bush than he will from Kerry.

      Best Lines:  “We will deploy our principles as well as our power.”                         “What if we had a president who believed in science?” “Some people criticize me for seeing complexities.”  With these three quotes Kerry separated himself from Bush.  Basically, his message was, it’s ok to be a thinking person.  A recent poll asked people who they would rather have a beer with, W or John Kerry.  This got the Kerry campaign all tied up in knots about how to present their guy as someone you’d hang out at the bar with.  This is ridiculous and it is part of what is wrong with his country.  Does the president have to be able to understand the problems of average Americans?  Absolutely no way around it, yes.  Does he have to be everyone’s best friend?  No.  People think that Bush has a good heart, but John Kerry is too aloof.  Well, I want the President of the United States to be smarter than me and George Bush is an idiot.  He can’t even muster eloquence to describe the single greatest influence on his life.  During a debate in the Republican primaries, he was asked who his favorite philosopher was.  He said “Jesus Christ”.  The moderator pressed him to elaborate and he had nothing to add*, he just retreated into his ludicrous smirk.  Because really, what can you say about Jesus Christ?  He’s only influenced global culture for 2,000 years.  A million priests and pastors come up with something to say about him every Sunday, but really, what is there to say?     The emphasis of likeability over brains in the Bush-Kerry competition is scary.   The President has to deal with serious stuff, you know, like the war, dude. And the economy.  And he has to keep the Kyoto Treaty and the Geneva Conventions straight.  So let’s stop looking for the Prom King and start looking for the leader of the free world.  *Go to Slate Magazine for a description of “The Jesus Factor”, a documentary that attempts to plumb the depths of Bush’s faith and mentions this incident:   urlLink http://slate.msn.com/id/2099698/   In the same article, Bush is quoted as telling colleagues that God wanted him to be President.
