      My girlfriend and I watched capturing the friedmans last night.  It was a disturbing experience.  For those of you who don't know the plot- it's a documentary about a father and son who were accused of extreme sexual molestation in the mid '80s.  The documentary presents both sides, but definately makes a good case for the innocense of the father and son.  The father committed suicide in jail, but the son's now 34 and is challenging his conviction.  It's amazing how little things change- we're still capable of perpetrating salem witch trial-esque violence in this day and age.  Sad.  Anyway, Jesse Friedman (the son) has a webpage  urlLink here

      Wired.com ran an  urlLink article  on anti-porn website, xxxchurch.com.   The guys that run xxxchurch.com are a bit inflammatory, but I really like what they're doing.    In other news, my other neighor (there are four of us on the hall) left floaters (note the plural) in the toilet again. If purgatory existed, he'd be adding years upon years to his stay.  Classes are over here at Nashotah.  I spent the past six or so days reading all the stuff I was supposed to read for historical theology and systematic theology during the semester.  So all the material's still decompressing.  I really enjoyed reading Luther and Hooker (which surprised me).     Gas prices are high out here, although I understand they're not as high as some places.  Lee's got a really  urlLink funny pic  on his page about them.

      Added several links today.  Nashotah's obvious.  Disinformation's one of my favorite websites, and toolband.com... Tool used to be one of my favorite bands.  I'm not so keen on them now, but I'll still include a link.

      Hey all,  Not sure of what I'm doing at this point.  Will add more later.  Okay, it's later.  Check out  urlLink this  site.  It's where I get the blog name.  Only at Nashotah would I be called a liberal.  Still more information.  Check out my  urlLink neighbor's  blog.  Okay.  Managed to add a "links" section.  Can't figure out how to change the font for the "links" title, though.  Would appreciate some help.  I read the section in the blogspot help, but I couldn't figure it out from that.  The template I'm using doesn't resemble the example they give.  Not to mention, I had to add the code for the links section, so how and where do I add the code to regulate the font for the "links" title?  Frustrating.

      Trying to get everything coordinated before you go out of state can be difficult.    Nashotah's campus is pretty much empty.  Most people have left for the summer.  It feels weird to be here when no one else is.  No links for today.  No new news.
