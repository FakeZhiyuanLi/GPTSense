      This comes as a surprise only to those blinded by the right-wingers' snowjob (you know the one: "Pakistan is our friend.  They're fully cooperating in the war on terror.  Musharraf is in complete control.").  It's well-known that the Pakistani military and, worse, its intelligence service (the ISI) were totally in bed with the Taliban pre-9/11.  You think the true believers aren't upset with what's happened since?  All we can do is hope that the nightmare scenario doesn't come to pass: Musharraf is killed, the Islamists take over, and then they have the bomb.  I wish I could say it's far-fetched.   urlLink The New York Times: Pakistani Links Military to Failed Plot to Kill Him   P.S. Did anyone notice how the US let Pakistan off the hook when the fact that they were the worst nuclear proliferator in the world became known?  Musharraf claimed Kahn acted on his own (highly implausible; I'm sure Musharraf himself knew all along) and then let him off with an apology.  And what did the US do?  That's right - nothing.  Let's see, we went to war with Iraq because they were supposedly spreading WMD around the world (not true), and when one of our "closest allies" does the same thing, we say nothing.  No wonder the rest of the world doesn't take us seriously.  Rumor has it that the muted US response was in exchange for permission to hunt for bin Laden in Pakistani territory this spring.  And it's gone so well.  What a deal.  P.P.S. I'm not one of those who thinks that Bush is holding bin Laden and will produce him for an "October surprise."  He's way too fucking incompetent to have captured a wily guy like bin Laden.

      So we gave the city of Fallujah back to the Baathists.  Now we might make Sadr part of the government and allow the Mahdi Army to be incorporated into the Iraqi security forces.  Check out  urlLink The New York Times: Several Iraqis Dead After Clashes With U.S. Near Najaf .  That's just brilliant.  The various Iraqi insurgencies are 2 for 2 now.  You think they might get the idea that if you fight the Americans, you get what you want?  Thanks to Bush's disasterous policies, the military was put in a Catch-22.  Continuing to fight merely pisses more people off and strengthens the insurgency.  Caving in (the better option, and the one chosen for once) encourages the militants and rewards them for spreading mayhem.    So how is all this ad hoc bargaining going to affect the post-handover government?  Will Fallujah be a self-governing enclave?  Will Sadr, thanks to his private army, be the de facto ruler of southern Iraq?  Does Bush have his head up his ass?  Hint: at least one of these questions has a definitive affirmative answer.  Of course, the administration continues to ignore these major problems in its public statements.  Listening to Bush's speech the other night (or reading excerpts, as I did, because listening to his monkey ass makes my blood boil), and his simple "5-step plan," you'd think that none of this stuff had ever happened.  I just wish that Bush would admit, for once, that he's fucked everything up...

      Can you tell I'm doing my Washington Post reading for the day?  Anyway, here's another example of Ashcroft's characteristic megalomania.  Now he's  urlLink pissing off  his own people.

      You've gotta love overweight soda jerks (and I do mean jerks) in Bumfuck Nebraska.  Our good buddy  urlLink Steve Schwartzkopf  is upset about our soldiers dying in Iraq.  But does he blame the man who put them there?  Oh no!  He blames the innocent civilians in Iraq.  His suggestion?  "I think we should just go for it, you know, drop bombs and clear out any city where Americans are killed. But we're not willing to do that."  I kid you not.  People, guys like this one are why we have a monkey for a President.

      It's good to see that not everyone in the Republican Party is a member of the conspiracy.  Good ol' John Warner is actually - gasp! -  urlLink trying to find out the TRUTH about prisoner abuse by the military!   While this isn't really "news," I just thought it was funny how all the right-wingers quoted in the article bitch about how the investigation into the scandal is "distracting" us from "fighting the war."  Come again?  What does one have to do with the other?  How are a bunch of committee meetings in Washington "distracting" soldiers fighting the Mahdi Army in Najaf?  And isn't getting to the bottom of the scandal sort of essential to achieving the broader aims that this war was supposed to be about (a free, pro-US Iraq and all that)?  Clearly, the right-wingers just want to hush this whole thing up, because they know it's going to blow the lid off the entire Bush administration policy (ordered by Rumsfeld, known about by Bush) toward prisoners and interrogations in the "war on terror" (note: how does one fight a war against an emotion?).  Well, sorry, right-wingers, this cat's out of the bag, and there's nothing you can do to stop it now.

      As those of you who have been following this Iraq war thing already know, Christopher Hitchens has gone off the reservation.  I used to be a big Hitchens fan.  He always called a spade a spade and cut through everyone's bullshit to expose the truth.  When he came out in support of the war, I disagreed, but I respected his position because I believed it to be based on genuine idealism and concern for human rights.  I thought that after the whole thing blew up in our faces (and didn't all of us with any sense at all know that it would?), he would come around, admit that he was wrong (or at least that "mistakes were made"), and return to being a voice of reason.  Well, I was wrong - completely wrong.  Hitchens has either decided to become a right-wing hack, or he's completely lost his mind.  As the edifice on which he built his earlier arguments crumbles, Hitchens has resorted to more and more desperate measures to shore them up.  Today, though, has to be the low point.  He's on  Slate   urlLink defending Ahmad Chalabi .  Come on now.  This guy is one of the biggest con men and charlatans in the history of the world.  Even the US government, which had so much of its own credibility invested in him, has completely disowned him.  The guy is a joke.  How can Hitchens defend him with a straight face?  Hitchens' arguments are laughable.  They basically boil down to the proposition that even if some of the things now being said about Chalabi's shadiness are true (even Hitchens has to concede that much), we should give him the benefit of the doubt, because he  may  have been blackballed to some degree, and besides, we could do worse.  What kind of argument is that?  Just add it to the long list of untenable positions that Hitchens continues to maintain, including 1) that there  urlLink really were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  (based mostly on a single beat-up Sarin shell from the 80's that was found and used by the insurgents); 2) that  urlLink there really is a connection between Saddam and al Qaida ; and 3) that  urlLink killing lots of Iraqis is actually a good thing in the long run .  Perhaps Hitchens just has a problem  urlLink admitting that he was wrong .  But he really appears to be a true believer in the neocon cause.  It's just disappointing that he's willing to stoop to disingenuous writing to further it.

      Yes, everyone laughed when Hillary blamed "a vast right-wing conspiracy" when Monicagate broke.  But just because she was wrong about Monica doesn't mean that the conspiracy didn't (and doesn't) exist.  Right-wing nutjobs (like the current occupant of the Oval Office and his puppetmaster) are determined to deceive the good people of this country and rule through misinformation and fear.  Well I, for one, won't let them get away with it!  Thus, this lonely blog.  Visit here often to see the right wing's lies exposed (or at least ridiculed).  Wake up America - they're taking your country from you!

      Just when I thought he'd gone off the deep end for good, Hitchens puts out a typically brash, bileful piece blowing a gigantic hole in all of this insipid, annoying sentimentality surrounding the death of  urlLink Ronand Reagan .  How refreshing to know that Hitchens still considers himself on the "left."  If only he'd act like it more often.

      This one has Karl Rove's fingerprints all over it.  The Bush campaign has a plan to distribute campaign literature at  urlLink thousands of churches .  Considering that only a religious zealot could like the guy, I guess it's a smart move (even if in extremely poor taste).  But the Jesus freaks better be careful, or they could lose their tax-exempt status.

      So, Bush has  urlLink hired a lawyer  to represent him in the CIA leak case.  Interesting move.  Being a lawyer myself, I'm not going to give him too much of a hard time about this - everyone can use a good lawyer!  But it does indicate that he believes he may be called before the grand jury, which means that there is some basis for believing that he has relevant knowledge concerning what happened.  Maybe he does, and maybe he doesn't.  (Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't, since he appears to be out of the loop on just about everything that's important.)  Things will get really interesting if he does in fact get called to testify.  What will he do?  Will he plead the 5th?  (That would be political suicide!)  Will he lie?  (Possibly - hopefully he'll get caught.)  Or will he try to hide behind executive privilege?  The latter option is the most interesting, because it presents quite a dilemma.  It's probably his best option if he actually knows something and doesn't want to tell.  Ironically, though, it's people from his own right-wing camp who eviscerated the executive privilege in order to "get" Clinton in the Whitewater/Paula Jones probe.  Could that move come back to bite them in the ass?  They're certainly no strangers to blowback!  Stay tuned...

      More proof that the Bushies are a bunch of lying, ass-covering sadists.  Does it surprise anyone that they are trying to  urlLink cover up  the prison abuse scandal?  Seymour Hersh has already explained why - the abuses were part of a classified plan that came down directly from Rumsfeld.  It's unbelievable that he's still in office.  Oh wait.  No it's not.  Just look who his boss is.
