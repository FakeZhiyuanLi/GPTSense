      Today was scary and fun all at the same time ya know that feeling? I think i like it. Someone attempted to kiss me. It was more or less a disaster but if u wanna know that story you can ask me.Despite that i still like him. Ya know what i love this blogger. Here its only about me and only my feelings count. I think everybody needs a place like that. I think im gonna watch gothika here a little bit. cuz i rollerbladed for about 30 minutes at full speed. It was fun after the sitting and watching shane and shawn and cam skate for like 4 hours maybe even more. What i got home at like quarter to 2 and went outside after about 15 minutes, was out for like 45 minutes alone until shane came and hung out with me. Hes a real cool kid. Hes never had a gf which i find hardto believe i think hes real cute. But i dont think i would date him cuz i need someone a little more mature and not in it for the sex. Ya know? Not that i would hav sex with him cuz i wouldnt. But ya know "the perks" of a relationship. Thats not me at all. I want someone to care about my feelings and well being more than "getting some" I think that most guys want that too, once theyre ready for a relationship. We're all human right everyone wants someone who loves them.So if everyone wants it why is it so damn hard to find......

      I had a lot of fun at my party. I think i really like barry . Hes so cute and hes nice. My uncle hates him but i dont care. Because i like him and thats all that counts. I wish to date him. I was looking at his eyes and  almost kissed him. I really wanted to. I stopped myself. He stuck his hand down my shirt to get his keys back....i didnt hate it.....all in all a good day today my party tomorrow the mall...monday, THE WORLD..... RETRACTION-i do not wish to date barry.... i dont even really like him that much. I was on a party high. He said the RUDEST thing to danielle. joey went and sat in the floor ad barry said if you grow your hour and ye it blonde joey might pay attention to you. WHAT AN ASSHOLE maybe thats why he doesnt have a gf.....

      Okay this blog has nothing to do with Babe Ruth but i wanted to cal it that. LoL im a nerd! What can ya do? Okay why is Bill Clinton making a come back. All of the sudden hes in the spotlight again. Sine when does his opinion matter in anything? Even when he was president everyone though he was a moron. What changed? NOTHING. But anyways....i have found the way to be happy. And i am excited, as i should be. Junior year is going to be a new beginning. Im gonna get good grades and stop worrying about eerything and just focus on myself and makin my life better. Nothing can bring me down!! Im not gonna worry about guys or all the drama of school. It no longer affects me. I figured out that i can never be happy and i can never have a successful relationship with some who makes me happy if im not happy with myself first. So next year is gonna be good. Then as soon as i get out of school i will go on my road trip with chelsea. First we're gonna go to New York, then Tennessee then Georgia then florida. Maybe we'll even drive down to he Keys. Im really excited forthis year to start. Too bad its only june.....

      i see it in your eyes the look i've witnessed a thousand times the sadness persists but with all of this all i can say is i love the way you look at me the way at night you quietly sleep the pain the sorrow means nothing now because i know you'll be here tomorrow Light creeps accross your face  someday we might just win this race the battle you fight to be by my side constantly pushing  to feel whats right    Poem #2 Why do you insist on torturing me Take a look around you The world is filled with glee Is it real or is it fake We may never know Happiness comes in tiny doses Like a dozen red roses A shimmering lake You'll never know unless u try Open your heart And let it fly    I dont know how i feel about either of these....please comment  All Lyrics Copywrite TantricXL 2004,all rights reserved   i

      Have you ever noticed how fake everything is? Even people who try their very hardest to be a nonconformist are fake because they arent being themselves. Just molding into another frame of mind. Im tired of feeling like im not my own person. I feel like im in a rut. Its really starting to catch up with me. Maybe this summer will be like a new beginning. I sure hope so. Maybe do some stuff i've never done before. Meet some new people, yuck i just feel....i dont know blah. I wish i could spend the summer in florida. I love it there its so calming ad makes you feel like a totally different person. I dont know if its the ocean or the people or just the change of scenery. The weather is alway so beautiful *sigh* well im gonna go talk to david now....

      Holy dog shit in a pile of sheets. My friends are sluts....and that is all im going to say. I hate this country by the way....the news pisses me off so bad!!! Okay  this thing with Pres. Bush and gay marriage pisses me off!!!!!!!!He talks about how the bible says the marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman. WHAT THE HELL!!! You cant use religion for an arguement for something legal for the folowing reasons1. What happened to the separation between church and state? 2. Not everyone in the country shares the some religion so why should everyone share the same law based on what a bible that doesnt even represent what they believe says? It makes me so mad. This country cannot have a Leader who doesnt represent all walks of life. When are we going to have a black president, or a woman president, or a jewish or muslim president. Its just bullshit....I dont like either canidate for the upcoming presidential election. Theyre both retarded. But honestly if i had to vote i would vote for Kerry. I hate him too, i just hate him less than i hate Bush. I wish i could vote, this is the guy whos gonna be the President when im 18. He is going to have serious power over my life. But i cant vote, all i can do is bitch in this journal and hope some people with sense are at the voting booths this year.  Thats all for now...     P.S.----Does anybody know the names of the guys on room raiders the other day It was the one where the chick took a bath...2 of em ere pretty fuccin hot haha what has my life come to? yeah e-mail me if u know or post

      Well today sucked....i ended up calling my granny at friggin quarter to one in the morning crying because i was so pissed. Ever been so mad you cried. Today was my first time. Man was i pissed. Danielle is being a huge bitch and i swear to god if she ever says anything about my father again i will find her and break every bone in her body. UGH!!!!!!!!!!! heres her quote "my problems may not be big to you but you no what they are to me you think you  have it so bad well your wrong at least you still have your mom you just need to be grate ful and stop saying how your life is so horrible compared to everyon elses people have problems that yours dont  even compare to so just stop feeling sorry for your self" Her biggets fucking problem right now is that her mom wont let her go to her bf's house anymore cuz she found out theyd been having oral sex and found a hicki on her. At least i still have my mom??? WHO is she to say anything like that, she has two parents she has no idea what its like to lose your father. That bitch.I never said my life was so horrible  i know i have it pretty damn good but her problems are a fucking parade compared to mine. I have to live every day of my life with my dad dead. I was only 12 when he died and so help me god if she ever fucking even speaks his name i will punch her in the face.Oh because i think im so badass(sarcasm for those people who are as dumb as i am). And i sure as hell dont walk around feeling sorry for myself. Ask any one of my friends and theyll tell you i dont feel sorry for myself. I dont walk around like woe is me life is so hard fuck that i know shit happens and you gotta just keep living your life but its still hard and you cant comment on my life and me "at least still having my mom" i am greatful for everything i have so who the hell is she to basicly tell me im an ungreatful little bitch who feels sorry for hersle. I DONT FUCKING THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!!! grrrrrrrrrrrrrr when her god damn dad dies then she can talk to me about something like that fuck her......

      Today i hung out with sarah for the first time in forever. I was really glad to see her i didnt realize how much i missed hanging out with her. We always laugh a lot and today was no exception. Shes going through some really tough stff, i hope i can help her, im sure as hell gonna try. Shane is seriously sending mixed messags. Its like one minute he wants to be around me and the next hes annoyed with me.He needs to decide. Sam says she thinks he just wants ass and i dont have a had time believing that, but she always says she thins hes confused. AHHHHHH heres a sam quote...of her talking about how he wants ass and not a relationship..."which is understandable but he doesn't want that, and there's not much you can do untill he realizes that he's missing out and then is like wow, that caro chick is hot, and I want to be with her " I hope that happens and i still wanna be with him if it does. His friend Cam is a cutie too. But still i want shane, he has no idea how much either. ugh gonna go talk to meeh sarah....

      God the last few days have been so hard. My best friend chelsea's brother in law died on thursday. He left behind 3 boys and a wife and whole load of people who love him. I really hope he's someplace better beause those poor boys have to grow up without their daddy just like i have to and i dont wish that on anyone. Today was he funeral i tried so hard not to breakdown. Almost as soon as i walked into the church i saw Cam and he opened his arms for me to give him a hug i almost lost it. I gave him a hug and a kiss. Hes just so sweet and poor killian just doesnt quite comrehend whats happening not fully anyway hes too young. Anthony is being so strong. I think he feels like he has to take care of everybody. I wish i could do something for him. Steven (chelseas brother) is taking this really hard, he and i talked for about 30 minutes on friday. We had a lot to talk about since we havent had a chance to do that since he moved back to ohio. He turned out to be a pretty cool guy. Im gad he doesnt wish to torture me anymore. Just chelsea. Oh cheese and rice the dumbest thing ever happened at the funeral home. The phone rang and ashley goes "my ear is ringing" i looked at her and said....thats the phone idiot. She swears her ear was really ringing. lol I hope chelsea calls me back pretty soon. Well i havent seen shane in a couple days lol. Im having skateboarder withdrawls. Somehow i think i'll survive. Hes so damn cute but hes using me which im well aware of. I need to find a guy my own age who wants the same things i do. Im tired of feeling like nobody gives a shit.Im tired of danielle constantly talking about oey and me just having to smile and nod. I know shes not trying to sound like a conceitd self centered little bitch, but she does. I know theyve been dating a long time but she as no right to look down on me for kissing shane. She goes "YOURE NOT EVEN DATING HIM" who the fuck cares its not like im having his baby. Jeez! Thats a mouthfull from someone who can forgive someone for having sex with a man whore. Why cant she cut me some sack its not like my life is as magically wonderful as hers. I dont know what sh wants from me but this isnt her life and its not her decision. We do share a lot of the same morals but i guess astinence from pre-datig kissing isnt one of them. I cant believe im even saying this its just rediculous that she has a problem with it.Who gives a damn, not me, well obviously i do but im over it im tired of worrying about what danielle. Well im gonna go wath a movie.....

      I am sick. I have lost my voice. It really sucks. Bill even said that i sound horrible.(side note-excuse any typos i just got in from outside and my hands are numb) Anyways....i have been thinking a lot lately. Who is to say theres a god? How are peope even supposed to really know if they believe in god or not with all these outside influences. Sometimes i feel like there just cant be a god because all these horrible things wouldnt happen. Which brings me to my next point. People are so horrible to eachother all the time. You would think that if you were raised in an abusive home you would want to treat your children like 110% better than that. So that they wouldnt have to go through what you did. I dont get peoples logic. I mean of course i dont expect people to always be happy....but just try to be better to each other so even when the world sucks maybe it wouldnt suck so bad.Another thing i would like to talk about is purpose. I dont underdstand how to know why your here...what you need to do and how to get yourself in the position to do that. Some of my friends andmy boyfriend know what they want to do. I mean did they go through everything im going through to know that, is it this hard for everyone. My granny always tells me its because i have so many options...but do i really? I just wish i would wake up one day and know. High school always puts so much pressure on you to know what your gonna do and have a plan. I dont have a plan. I dont even have an idea...i've thought of thing i wanna do but then they just conflict with other things. I wanna have a family...but i wanna travel. I dont wanna be tied down but i wanna know that im secure and have someone who loves me to come home to. I have so many things i need to decide on but the most pressing is what im supposed to do with my life. I ish i could just figure it all out. Ya know? dont even know who i am. I thought i had a pretty good idea and im not totally clueless. I know what my morals are and i will stand by them but thats not really knowing yorself completely. I know that i dont know if i believe in god,or if theres such a thing as true love. I know im afraid of being hurt. I know im afraid of losing somebody i love again and that i will do anything in my power to keep it from happening. I know that i care about my friends and i would do almost anything for them. I know i have a boyfriend who i care about very much...i dont understand why thats not enough for me.I guess i cant really do anything except for take each day as its given to me and do my best to make it count.....

      I had a little panic attack when i realized ihadnt posted in this thing for a while and i figure if i took the time to make it i should take to time to update it.For all of those who actually give a shit bout whats going on in my life. Well ive been kindqa dating bill. Its not really official or anything but we've talked about it. I love hanging out with him, he makes me feel so comfortable and i never have to worry about trying to be something im not.We talked for about 2 hours last night. That was pretty awesome. I wish it had been in person though that would have been better. But i'll take what i can get. Hes coming over tonight....looking forward to that. Im gonna make him watch wrong turn with me cuz i hate watching it alone....even tho i lo scary movies.  I talked to meeh caitie today and told her about bill. She said he better not be anothr andrew or shell have to beat his ass. lol shes so cute. She now had a 2 week list which i think is hilarious. Poor thing i think all her relationships have been worse than mine. Hopefully her luck will change and she'll find someone she cliques with. I feel so friggin lucky to find someone i can talk to and doesnt want anything more than to be with me and for me to want to be there with him.things aee def. looking up for me. He kinda woke me up this morning...i love waking up to his voice.He is one of 9 children.I would just like to say holy crap. I think that joe is really pissed bout bill cuz now hes being an asshole to me. At least i didnt cheat on him. I wouldnt do that cuz that sucks...i would know. But just because i broke up with him doesnt mean he can be a dick to me....the bastard. ugh whatever im jus gonna finish cleaning for when bill comes over........
