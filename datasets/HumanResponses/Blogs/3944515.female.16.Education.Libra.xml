      Why... Suddenly felt so moody even though i had finished my ahem le.. Girls suffer from pre-menstrual syndrome.. I guess for me, it's post.. The answer dawned on me after lunch.. He called me yesterday.. Not even a word of "i miss u".. So uncaring and insensitive.. Then again, it's not his fault.. We weren't supposed to be together in the first place.. Or rather, we didn't even start a relationship in the first place.. Love is such a funny thing.. I told you before to go look for someone who can really understand your needs and suit your lifestyle.. I'm not the one for you, given my current situation..  Why are girls so silly.. Willing to do anything for their guys.. I promised myself before to&nbsp;think&nbsp;logically and rationally&nbsp;but then.. I hate it when the mind always cannot agree with how the heart feels.. Haha.. Sorry guys.. Bet you're feeling confused.. It's ok.. I'm one confused gal..   --*--Will time heal all wounds? I don't wish to hurt anyone anymore--*--

      Haha school ended early today so went with a couple of my friends to BK at Holland V to eat.. Hmm... What can i say about them?? They're absolutely terrific.. Crazy and wacky bunch of ppl who can only think of.. ahem ahem..YOU know what i mean haha.. The sad part was that Yanfang fell down.. Deep cut and she had to struggle all the way to the MRT station.. Yanfang, take care wor.. We share lots of light-hearted moments but i'm very afraid that i won't complete my projects on time.. It's like half the time we are fooling around instead of doing serious work.. But they're comical and i prefer them to stay that way.. It makes life a little more interesting and easier to go by..

      I'm not the way i am today.. Perhaps due to the lack of sleep haha.. Last night slept at 1.30 a.m.. At least, it's better than Caifong.. Pity her.. Slept at 4 a.m.. But nobody can beat Deny.. Sleeping at 5 a.m... Might as well don't sleep right? Wonder what guys stay up late at night for.. **don't wish to know** :P Didn't get into Ambassadors.. Damm happy about that.. Now i have the excuse to say&nbsp;that i can join other ccas.. Kinda interested in dancesports but&nbsp;somebody doesn't like me dancing with other guys...&nbsp;Ha ha please lor&nbsp;it's going to be more girls than guys in the cca.. &nbsp;As expected.. LOL..  &nbsp;  &nbsp; ..*-Promise me you'll be there when i need you-*..

        Frustrating&nbsp;day.. I don't wish to use my blog as an avenue to comment on people.. But whatever it is, i thank my colleagues for making my day brighter..Sometimes feel that working life is so much better than studying.. Except that when i'm working, i have a tendency to snack more.. which means that i'm growing fat!!      Not like in NP.. Everyday must climb mountains to reach classrooms haha.. I believe when NP was built, it was with that mission in mind:- To stay healthy..        &nbsp;    --*..Tip of the day: Climb more mountains..*--

      Wah.. I'm down with flu.. Weather has been really funny these few days.. One moment it's raining, the next it's sunny.. Can't believe i've been living in Singapore for the past 16 years of my life and i'm still not used to this weather.. Hmm.. Could feel the pressure already.. So many projects and the dateline is like 3 weeks away?.. My group has been really really cooperative.. They're willing to stay back in school even though lessons end around 4 pm.. I'm so touched by their dedication.. *crying*.. Hey, i mean it k.. Thanks Deny, Laywei, and Daryl.. Owe you one guys..

      Haha.. Half my weekend is gone already.. Here i am in school doing projects while i imagine my class mates snoring and sleeping blissfully in their beds till the late morning..Sobz..Life's never fair..  Sickening.. I can never understand what my Maec teacher is teaching.. Really think he's better suited in his old job..It's not that he cant teach.. Wait a min, he can't really teach!! It's just that whenever he's saying a concept, he'll pause for a moment and suddenly add in things.. As it is, Econs is so difficult to understand.. He's just making things worse.. He wouldn't have a problem teaching financial stuff given his background though..  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  --*.. Tip of the day: Love thyself..*--

      Yesterday had a class outing.. Went to Marina area to eat (what is it called?) i think it's similar to table bbq.. Mix of steamboat and bbq.. Haha.. Ok enjoyed ourselves though there were only 10 of us. Henry represented the seniors lolz.. But am kinda guilty that we didn't talk much to him, hope he doesn't feel left out.. Haha we crapped so much and i was so accident-prone.. Lao Da always kena my accidents, chilli crab, prawn.. Better stop saying else he'll hoot me..Haha.. The guys willingly downed raw eggs with beer for the photos.. Suddenly talked about eating too much eggs will make you horny.. It's my fault, it was me who said that.. Correction guys, it's actually eating too many protein-riched food that will make you horny.. Eggs are full of protein hehe.. Lolz..  They wanted to stay out longer but i didn't think it was a wise idea cos of the following reasons:-   It's late  Weekday night, trains don't function till late  Not much happening on tues   It's the seventh month   Some of them were so horrible.. Walked in front and started screaming..Scared the wits out of me.. Then realised it was a joke..But i rather be safe than sorry..pls ppl, don't play this kind of jokes anymore..It's really freaky..  On the way home, talked to X.. X, i hope that you understand that this 'dear' thing is for fun k.. I don't wish for it to escalate to a real thing.. Twice is enough and i've learnt my lesson.. Me calling you dear is just an affectionate form of calling you friend k.. I have to make it clear from the start..  As for him, he told me that he had been suffering from frequent headaches.. Say maybe not enough sleep cos of messaging me.. How should i react? THough i'm worried of your frequent headaches, are you also trying to say that i'm disturbing you? *Chrissy*, how should i act? Angry? Apologetic?  One addition..Moi miss Y and TCW very much.. Y, you're welcome to stay at Moi's place k..haha.. As for TCW, I'll try to meet up with you after my tests..   Thanks *organisers* for making it a success...Looking forward to the next outing..

      Though i'm jealous of all those PDAs i see on the street or in school, if he was to do that, i'll run away.. I guess it's cos i'm not used to it.. I'm a very practical person so is he.. That's the problem.. He doesn't make me feel like a princess for a day.. haha.. We don't celebrate V-day, birthdays.. But i remembered celebrating our 1 year anniversary.. He was so sweet.. Brought me to a park where we spent the time talking..It was so quiet and romantic... That date was the best  (the only date!) .. Lolz..It's as though we're married already and all we care about is buying groceries, getting food on the table and making babies..  Why can't we be like track 2 or track 9 of Jay's new album... Sweet.. I always feel like i'm in track 6..  Thanks ppl for listening to my woes...

      Monday morning...Went to school to finalise the written comm. project.. I arranged to meet the group at 10 am. All turned up except  Daryl .. Guess what time he showed up? 12.30 p.m.!!! I could have just killed him but i'm a nice girl.. Haha.. I hear sounds of disagreement..lalala.. We managed to submit the project but while printing our project, a funny and freaky thing happened.. Somebody seemed to be typing something on my notebook.. We saw sentences like "This old man", "14 in a jail".. It was so freaky!!! When i clicked print preview, the words just started appearing and spoiled my whole layout.. So we closed it and opened the file again.. Thankfully, it was back to normal.. But it's still freaky!!!*Hair standing*..  Went back home had an argument with Darren.. I'm sorry Darren that i can't meet up with you.. My parents refused to let me out and he's jealous that i'm contacting or even communicating with guys.. I can't believe it.. Just when i had stop arguing with someone, i had to argue with him..  YOu jealous? You say that you are not comfortable with me communicating with guys.. You say that you only want me to be yours. I am yours  (am i?)  but you must understand that these are my friends, honey.. Haha.. What a joke.. I got into a relationship with an older guy thinking that he would treasure me more than my ex.. How naive of me..I guess, it's still the same.. I don't know whether to cry or to laugh.. Everytime i message you, i got to wait so long for your reply. Sometimes, you don't even reply.. What are you doing at home anyway?? Yes i admit i'm difficult and petty but it's because i care.. I love you and you mean so much to me.. I can't break up with you nor can i bring myself to hate you.. Though we've only met 10 times, I treasure what we've done and gone through together.. 1 1/2 years of relationship.. Will time heal all wounds?  Hi Chrissy darling.. I understand what you're going through now.. Isn't it funny how the both of us are having problems in our relationships? I'm in a dilemma too.. Should i let him know that i have a blog? Should i let him know how i truly feel? There are many guys who treat me better than he treats me.. Sometimes the heart abit moved but i don't know... Whatever it is, take good care of yourself k.. I'm not around to lend you tissue or my shoulder when you're upset but i'll be your listening ear always.. Best friends forever.. Good luck for your tests as well.. See you soon i hope.. I miss you terribly.. We both got so many things to tell each other..  Sorry ppl.. Long blog these past 2 days.. So many things happening..

      Hi..Went to work yesterday and spent the whole day preparing files for a big event, hosted by MFA and IPOS.. Can you believe it? On a saturday?? Haha ok it was fun, met a new friend.. Aunt Carol's daughter, Alex.. She's studying in a Canadian University and came back to Singapore for her summer vacation.. She's an interesting person.. After finishing the files, had to pia straight to Fatty Weng Restaurant.. It's somewhere in Geylang.. Grandparents' wedding anniversary.. How sweet..Aww.. Ok ate a 10-course dinner.. Feeling like a pig now.. Haha those adults sure can drink.. 7 bottles of Carlsberg, 4 bottles of Stout... Me, i only drank a glass of Carlsberg.. At least i'm comforted that i'll be safe and sound with mama around..Lolz.. Reached home about 11 plus.. Had an argument with him.. Couldnt quite remember why.. But anyway he assumed that i was angry and didn't want to go out with him on sunday.. Ok fine.. Woke up on Sunday, went down to makan breakfast..*pig*.. I messaged him and asked whether he wanted to meet.. He replied "I thought you were angry with me so i made plans with mom to help her carry stuff".. *Infuriating*.. Ok fine..I told him to go help his mom instead.. After all, both of us were fillal children. I understand his position that's why i didn't want to trouble him to meet up with me..I'm not unreasonable ok.. Besides we've not met for 2 months.. Will another 1 or 2 more months hurt?  He replied back "But i also miss you. I'm afraid that you'll run away from me..".. Yes, i am tempted to run away from you because i never felt like i was in a relationship before.. You don't come out to meet me and never send me back to my house..only to the mrt station.. It's always me who's initiating meetings and when you finally got the hint that i wasn't going to initiate anymore,you took a more active role in the relationship but what's the use? Ends up we never meet up..When we go out, do you hold my hand? No.. We don't even look like we're together..Do you have somebody else? YOu always deny but why do i keep feeling like there's somebody else besides me in your life?  Hey.. A girl needs security.. Yes i don't like those public displays of affection (PDAs) but can't you at least show some care for your girl? We've been together for close to a year and a half but we've only met like 10 times.. It's so pathetic.. Thinking about it makes me upset.. Why should i even cry about you? You say you need assurance in the relationship, you say you need to be secured that i won't fly away, be with you forever.. This whole relationship is like a 1-way traffic.. If you don't want to take an active role in the relationship, don't blame me for flying away..

      I absolutely love dancesports.. Went for my first dance lesson on tues evening and learnt some basic Cha Cha steps.. Haha.. Too bad there were very few guys so i was partnered with a girl.. So guys if you're reading this, please give dancesports your fullest support by joining ok lolx.. If you need any more information on dancesports, can go look for Deny or Daryl.. They'll happily dispense what you need to know keke.. Well, we had some laughs and occasional steps on each others' feet and bumping into one another.. But i never regretted the decision to join dancesports.. I can't wait for my next lesson.. Hmm.. Tests round the corner.. Getting the jitters and to make matters worse, i'm down with flu.. The weather has been pretty hot lately.. Sickening..    --*-- Miss me?--*--

      Haha.. I haven't been posting for the past week.. Really busy.. Well, to summarise the week's events.. Eventful lolx.. Quite tied up these few days with schoolwork.. Stress level very high..The only good thing was that i submitted one of the projects.. Finally..Phew.. Hmm.. Got to know a new friend through this website:-  urlLink www.wholivesnearyou.com  . It basically shows who lives in your neighbourhood.. Abit freaky but fun.. Oh ya about that friend.. He's a year younger than me but very interesting and fun to be with.. And the world is so small.. I just found out that he used to be my best friend's ex-neighbour.... Should i be glad or freaked out? You tell me.. Haha.. Haiz.. Wanted to go out with him watch the fireworks on sun night but he didn't want to come out.. Ok i understand.. You live quite a distance away.. I don't want you to think that i'm unreasonable, i let you have your space..  --*--It's National Day!!--*..

      Went to Deny's place on sat to do a bit of our projects.. Feel so bad that Daryl's doing alot of work even though he's not the team leader.. Thanks Daryl..Oh btw, Deny's place is very lovely.. It's like a hotel..  You know.. Love is such a funny thing.. It literally changes somebody's character.. Take my younger sis for example.. She went into a relationship with this guy and my goodness, the way she talks to me is so different now.. It's like she's got a whole pot of honey shoved into her mouth.. Those who know her will know how rude and bold and brass she is.. But now.. Haha.. Just thinking about it sends shivers up my spine..That's so not her.. I'm not used to it.. Neither can my parents..Lol..  Yes, i'm a little envious.. It's like her boyfriend calls her everyday and talk mushy stuff, go out often.. What a far cry from mine.. Then again, the relationship just started out.. When you're in the dating stage, everyday is like heaven to you, sweet and mesmerising.. You miss the person and constantly want to hear his/her voice.. 1 year down the road, you'll think differently..   --*..Tip of the day: Sleep longer..*--
