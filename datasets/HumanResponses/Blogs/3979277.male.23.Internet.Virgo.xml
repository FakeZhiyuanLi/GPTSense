      Why does everyone seem to hate staff meetings at work?  Our team meets once a month to discuss various problems/questions people have brought up and everyone always complains about going. Why? I personally love getting paid for an hour to do absolutely nothing!  I usually just sit there and let my mind wander, while everyone else engages in a fascinating debate about why we have to do use a particular colour of paper or something else exciting. I 'm hoping one day to find a job that is simply 8 hours a day of meetings, then I wouldn't have to do any work for my wages!

      I was bored yesterday night so I decided to try to make the famed  Elvis Sandwich !  For those of you who have never heard of it here's the  urlLink recipe      Elvis Sandwich       2 slices of white bread 2 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter 1 small ripe banana mashed 2 tablespoons butter       Spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread and the mashed banana on the other. Press the slices gently together. Melt the butter (or to be truly Elvis-like, melt bacon fat!), over low heat in a small frying pan. Place the sandwich in the pan and fry until golden brown on both sides      I decided to be a bit more healthy than Elvis, so instead of frying the sandwich, I toasted it instead!   It was very nice but strangely no-one else was willing to try it!  Apparently Elvis used to eat 12 to 16 of these sandwiches a day, but I just stuck with 2 as I don't want to end up looking like fat Elvis!

        Yep it's that time again! Time to spend every waking hour of the day watching as much sport as possible, no matter how obscure it is!  Not had time to watch much yet, but did enjoy the Puerto Rico/USA men's basketball match last night. Even the incredible bias of the BBC's commentator could spoil it for me. Honestly I think this guy must have had some money bet that Puerto Rico would win or he was just a total hater of the Americans, but he could barely contain his joy when Puerto Rico scored.  Some nice play by Iverson and Duncan, but they just weren't good enough to beat Puerto Rico. Anyone writing off the USA is mistaken as I think they'll still take gold.   urlLink Match Report     I'm stuck working until 9pm this week at work so I'll miss most of the action, but I'm sure I'll find time to catch up!

      Been offline for the past few days so I haven't had the chance to read up much on the hurricane that hit Florida.  From the coverage on  urlLink Fox News  it seems pretty devastating, but thankfully the worst of the storm missed Tampa. It was initially estimated that it would hit the city head-on, which would have lead to most of downtown being flooded. Somehow the city escaped again as it's been 80 years since it was last hit.   "The U.S. National Weather Service and other experts predicted that Tampa would receive the worst of Charley's wrath. But it was actually Punta Gorda, 110 kilometres to the south, that was hit hardest. Local officials and residents complained that the change in direction left them ill-prepared"     It's pretty scary to realise that despite all the technology we have, if Mother Nature wants to change the course of a hurricane we have no way of predicting it.  Some pics:           It's scary to look at pictures of places I was visiting only three months ago wrecked like this.  At least only a small number of people have been killed, lets hope the death toll doesn't rise too much and the poor people stuck without homes and power get helped quickly.

      After working all weekend I finally got a day off yesterday.  Did originally think about staying in bed all day but decided in the end that it would too much of a waste to do that - after all I do most of my resting at work!  So I got up about 8 am and went to the gym. No  urlLink Gym Avoidance  today! Spent about an hour and half there, doing mostly cardiovascular work (bike, stepper and rowing machine). I was going to have a run on the treadmill but being lazy decided to leave that until later in the week!  Afterwards I came home, showered and had something to eat. Then took my brother to see  urlLink Spider-man 2  . Some  SPOILERS  below, so if you haven't already seen it avoid the red text and skip straight past:   All I can say about this movie is WOW! I though the original  urlLink Spider-man    was the best comic book adaptation ever (though X-Men 2 did come close) but this sequel blew the original away in every respect.   I thought the casting in the original was perfect, I couldn't imagine anyone else but  urlLink Tobey Maguire    and   urlLink Kirsten Dunst   as Peter and Mary Jane respectively.      The movie opens with a great re-cap of the first movie in comic book form and the pace doesn't really let up from there. The story is set about two years after the first and basically shows how Peter is trying to balance his superhero life with his regular life.   Needless to say he's having problems doing this, so he end up getting fired from his job, gets behind on college work and neglects his friends.      He decide to give up being Spider-man and live a normal life. However the superhero calling just never goes away and eventually he puts on the mask again after Doc Oc (a scientist who has 4 robotic arms fused onto his body during an accident) kidnaps Mary Jane.   What follows are some of the most amazing fights i've ever witnessed on-screen including a fight on the outside of a moving subway train!      It's all capped off with a stunning final battle in Doc Oc's base which has to be seen to be believed, words wouldn't do it justice.      Overall I'd give it 10/10. Future superhero movies will have to do a lot to top this.      I'm only working half-day on Friday, so I think I'll be visiting the cinema again to catch up on the all the summer movies i've not yet seen - popcorn at the ready!      Still need a job for September and despite all the ones I've applied to so far, still no interviews.   Oh well I guess thats the reason I have internet access at work - so i can apply for other jobs!

      I was supposed to be going to the gym today after work but decided against it last night.  The reason?  It might be raining when I have to go . This is despite the fact that I can drive all the way from work to the gym and the car park is only about 5 minutes away!  I sometimes wonder if out of all the people around the world who are members of gyms, whether i'm the only one who come up some of  the  worst reasons not to go? It's weird, sometimes I manage to be really motivated for weeks about going to the gym but since I went on holiday in May, iIve found it really hard to get back into the routine.  It's not that I don't enjoy it once I get there, but it's just that mental push required to actually go.  Now if I could only afford a home gym , then I wouldn't have any excuse not to go.....unless I really thought about it

      Monday morning......can anything be worse than that feeling when you wake up and wonder what day it is, only to realise it's   Monday   ?  To make matters worse when I opened the curtains, instead of being sunny, it was dull and grey! The combination of grey sky and Monday is not the best way to motivate you to get up.  Anyway I dragged myself out of bed and somehow managed to get out of the house and to work in time.  Mondays are bad enough, but this Monday was worse than usual. As I'd been working all weekend (we have to work one in every three weekends) it felt as if my life had consisted of  work  and  sleep  for as long as I could remember. Luckily I have a day off on Wednesday so I have the chance of a rest and hopefully get to finally see  urlLink Spider-man 2 .   Despite the fact that the sky was threatening rain, thankfully it stayed dry until I was safe in the office. Then the weather seemed to go crazy and what I can only describe as a miniature monsoon started! Strong wind and rain for a 2 hours non-stop lead to the car park nearly flooding and a stream of soaking people coming into work.  I sat smugly by as I looked out of my window at the smokers desperately trying not to get wet as they huddled outside the building. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll stop raining before I finish work tonight.  The only time I ever enjoy the rain is when I'm at home, have no reason to go out and I can just stare out of the window. It's very relaxing to watch but only if you aren't caught in it!  Garfield describes how i felt this morning quite well:

      Big Brother 5 is all over after 71 days. Guess I'll have to find something else to watch in the evenings :-)  I think this was the greatest Big Brother since the show started in 1999. It had it all over-the-top characters, controversy and most importantly fighting.  The following is shamelessly stolen from bbc.co.uk:      Nine million see Big Brother end  Nadia Almada received 3.9 million, or 74%, of the public voteUp to nine million people watched Portuguese transsexual Nadia Almada win this year's Big Brother reality television show. An average audience of 8.3 million tuned in to watch Nadia sweep to victory in the fifth series.   That figure swelled to nine million - more than 50% of the TV audience - by the time the show ended at 2300 BST.      The ratings are a massive improvement on last year when 6.6 million tuned into the final. But the climax still failed to match the record 9.4 million viewers who watched Kate Lawler crowned the first female winner on the final night in 2002. BIG BROTHER FINAL WEEK VOTES  Nadia - 3,863,696 Jason - 1,335,246 Dan - 685,995 Shell - 347,051  Nadia, 27, gained huge public support and had been the hottest favourite in the programme's five-series history. "There's no words that could show the happiness inside me," she said on leaving the house. "Thank you so much."  Jason Cowan, a 30-year-old air steward from Glasgow, came second with Daniel Bryan, 30, from Hull, third and Shell Jubin, 21, also from Glasgow, fourth. They had been locked in a TV house for 10 weeks, with nine other contestants kicked out along the way. Honest Nadia, a bank clerk living in Surrey, broke down in tears and started shaking when presenter Davina McCall announced the news. She kept the fact she was born a man from her fellow housemates and began the series as a 50-1 outsider. But she endeared herself to the nation to win the £63,500 prize. She said her transsexuality was not a secret, but she wanted to win the show without telling housemates for "a reassurance of myself". "It was very hard because there were times that I felt I had to lie a little bit and I didn't want to lie at all," she said. "There were moments when I felt I would just come clean and be honest about it." This series has been among the most controversial yet, with security men called in to break up a fight, sex between two contestants and producers setting "evil" tasks.  Jason - who entered the house in a thong in May - received boos from some fans on leaving but said he was "chuffed to bits" to come second. He said it was "brilliant", adding: "It's made me a better person so I've enjoyed it." Daniel, a hairdresser, insisted he did not want to win the show. He told viewers: "It's not something I would've been comfortable with. It's not hard work in the house." On leaving in fourth place, Shell, a student, said: "People just kicked me up the backside a bit and I had good fun from it."  Popularity Nadia received almost 3.9 million votes in the final week, compared with 1.3 million for Jason. Daniel got 685,995, with 347,051 for Shell. The total of 6.4 million was up from last year's record low of 4.3 million votes - but still lower than the totals for the first three series.  That makes it the second most popular of the UK's five series, behind Big Brother 3, which saw Kate Lawler triumph.     The only thing I can say about Nadia winning?   I'll leave it to Austin to comment:   .      That ain't no woman! It's a man, man!

      Well I've put off doing this for long enough, it's now time for my first post.  Hmm, what shall I write about to make people think "wow this is an amazingly interesting read"? I think if I spent the next ten years trying to write this post no-one would ever think that!  The idea of putting this blog together was really just somewhere to put my random thoughts about my life in general. I'm currently living in Northumberland, which is in the north-east of England. It's near Scotland and in general in rains a lot. Job wise it's a bit poor up here so within the next month I hope to be moving south to Hertfordshire, which is about 30 minutes outside London.  If you're not to sure about the area, here's a map :-) I'm currently living near Newcastle and should be moving just outside of London.(about 300 miles away)   I've decide it's time to move as I've been stuck in a dead-end internet job since I graduated in Jul 2003 and I think it's time for a change! I've sent off a bunch of application forms, so now it's time to play the waiting game. It's not a necessity that I a find a job before I move but it would be nice.  I must admit I'm slightly nervous about the whole moving to a totally different area, leaving all my friends and the familiar locations but sometimes I think you just need to make a change.I did previously live in Hertfordshire about 5 years ago, so I have a rough idea of the area and know people there, so it's not a totally new environment but still.....  Only time will tell I guess.
