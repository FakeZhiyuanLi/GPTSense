       1/31/04   Fairly Short Day....lazy sorta Saturday,. Really good seminar @ church though   Not much to say today. Basically I woke up, played piano, played PS2, then left for church for the seminar tonight. It was a good seminar though. But just before I get to that I'm gonna start from the morning...  I WAS going to wake up at 9 and practice piano for 2 hours to cram in some time so my teacher wouldn't kill me, but I decided to hit the snooze button and wake up at 10. Smart=P. Well anyways I ended up playing for an hour and 5 minutes, then ate some pizza *nutritious breakfast eh?,* Jason then called me and I told him to come over at 1, and then headed for piano lessons.  It was pretty bad for scales, but songs didn't sound bad. I HATE technique. Waste of precious piano playing time. Well after doing all that stuff I'm now officially realizing I need to spend more time playing my piano and less time doing other things. Ugh I really need a more organized life. Well that is something I do try to pray for. I honestly don't know though what I'd do without God. I mean after a stressful day it just feels so relaxing to read the Bible and do daily devotions. But yeah anyways after piano I got home....  And Jason beat me to my own house. Ouch. Well anyways he was on my comp, looking up stuff on the net, and we'd eventually be doing this for about 20 minutes or so before my dad finally finished watching the TV. Then came a bit of Silent Hill 3 *had to beat this one part before I forgot* then we went to play NFL street. Fun. LOTS of fun. When you're a runningback that can stiff arm, break tackle, juke, spin and then do a 360 hurdle all in one combo...........you get hit and fumble the ball. Yeah that happened a few times. We had some fun with that game though. Made my team better...My QB is actually not anerexic anymore. But anyways after that we then went to church, where we listened to Pastor Daniel Tjoe-Long *spelling of last name?* from OCAC talking about "The End-Time Christian."  It really was a good seminar though. Really brought up a lot. One main thing he kept on emphasizing is how we have to always be ready. I mean I've always known that but he really brought it up front.....VERY effectively. Some parts of the speech I didn't like though, like the part about how he seemed to think marrying someone from another religion is against the Bible. Maybe I interpreted it wrong though, because I was half asleep for most of it......until the 2nd half where after a short nap I got some energy pumped back in me. Then came dinner. Cha Siu was good, but Choi Sum was like drowned in Oil *shudder.* And then after that came the last part of seminar Last part of seminar was ok. Pastor Daniel spoke about how Christians start to backslide......and used Peter's denial of Jesus as an example. There were 7 steps. Boy I wish I wrote those down in my notes now. Oh well, the last three were basically about denial though. The first 4 were uhh......blast my memory fails me again. Well basically some of the main things he DID tell us to do was for example instead of just doing devos, READ THE BIBLE. Devos are supposed to HELP you understand passage. It is NOT a substitute book for a Bible. That was basically it.  Now we all head downstairs and leave for home. Jason, me and my dad got a ride with Pastor Mackness since our car is in the shop right now. Well now I'm home and am probably gonna go watch SNL in a bit. G'nite.

       1/30/04   3 Day weekend start! Sweet....   What a relaxing day it was. And also random. Well originally I was gonna go session today @ UCC but then decided not to because I was REALLY lazy. Well for a PD day it was well spent........bought a new PS2 Game, saw a movie, and figured out Friendster (www.friendster.com) sorta. I still don't get why the heck people don't just use MSN. It's kinda cool though I guess....But most exciting part of day today was probably the sudden change in the afternoon from breakdancing to seeing a movie. I don't regret that descision.....unless I could all of a sudden pull flares in one night which I REALLY doubt.  My day started off slow........woke up around 11ish, just because I was getting bored of sleeping for the morning. Unfortunately mom wasn't awake yet so I didn't really have a breakfast. Well....it was 11 so I guess I might as well just have lunch. Mom ordered pizza though......so in the end the pizza cancelled out the no food when I wake up. Mmmmmm.......Hawaiian pizza......so good. The other one had tomatoes *what's the point when you have tomato sauce?* so I didn't really touch it. Well after that got my daily dose of tea to wake me up and down to the comp I go to check MSN and email.  Yes I just realized something. The monitor says WOW......but my tin can speakers are yelling at me to buy new ones. They do suck a lot though. The button "3D sound" makes the speakers louder that's all. Well for 5 bucks can't complain.....actually I got them for free. My uncle bought them since my old speakers died out. Probably from when I dropped them on the UCC floor but no one knows....except the people that saw it happen.  But other than that.....I called up Jason and got Adrian to play SC. Jason then came and his friend "Sauron" came again. We played some SC, and then eventually we'd be doing that for about two hours. It was pretty fun. I pissed off Jason by basically  luring the enemy to his base. Then we lost that game. In another round which we won.....Adrian would mass lings, Jason would do most of the work, and Sauron ran to my base since he kinda got obliviated 10 minutes into the game. Well after a while I decided to find Sauron a new base. However Jason would do the same but I wouldn't know. Well in the end he ran to Jason's base......and I wasted a crapload of men for nothing. Well in the end I'd make profits back by mining from the base. So I wasn't really complaining. We then watched the replay of the game after. After that I decided that I've been sitting in front of the comp too long. So I decided to go finish some piano practice. Then I went to drum for a bit. Then it was time to go. I was already late to pick up Jason but Meh not like anyone's gonna be there earlier than us.....  Oh yeah just before the leaving for movie thing......well apparently we weren't gonna go see Last Samurai anymore *WHOO HOO MOVIE TIME COMES THROUGH AND FOILS PLAN.* Instead we were gonna go see Butterfly Effect. Meh. Beats watching a movie I've seen again. Though I did sorta wanna see Cold Mountain but Dictatorship was not the descision-making tool in this situation unfortunately or I would have won. Instead it was a Democracy. Gah foiled once again by freedom....not saying it's bad but I wish Dictatorship was there at that moment so I'd win ^_^. Ok.....we'll make it sound better. Replace Dictatorship with Communism. There happy =P? But anyways back to the going to movie thing and how I think we'd be the first ones to arrive.....  Boy was I wrong. Josh's punctuation came through again. He was there earlier than us. Called Jason on our way there on cell. I was surprised he was there. Well I went to deposit cheque in Scotiabank from Chinese New Year money, and then we went to Zellers to buy Jason's Friends Season Six. Zellers of course is a cheap store, so in the end they didn't have it. I was gonna buy Silent Hill 3 there but I thought maybe I should check out EB first. Well Jason then bought the Season 6 from HMV and then we'd go to EB...  WOW I was lucky I didn't buy Silent Hill 3 from Zellers. They sold it for 50 and I got it for 30....though it was used who cares it was in good condition.  Jason was gonna pre-order SC Ghost (I was too but forgot) but in the end we didn't because this family in front of us took friggin forever to buy ONE GAME. The kid traded in like 50 games and he still had to pay money afterwards lol. What a rip off. I think he probably lost over $100 in value in the end. Idiot. Anyways after we left EB we finally got back Silvercity....where we'd find Steph and Rebecca waiting for us in the theatre. Was gonna play DDR but not enough time....  Now we sit in the movie. There were a few movies that looked ok. Well I sorta forgot except for Dawn of the Damned.....it looked ok I guess. Thought it'd be Resident Evil 2 but nope.......cheap imitation of it. Same sorta storyline, except instead of one person fighting them all off it's a group. Wow big change. And there was another movie.......that was like You Got Served except Cuban style. I bet it'll bomb too since You Got Served only got 1.5 stars out of 5. It looked pretty stupid.....only reason why I'd even go see it is because of breakdancing....but why not go to UCC and watch people breakdance there? IT'S FREE! Hmm....there was another movie......gah forgot what it was. OH YEAH! This one movie about this cop being stalked and something about "how can you track it when it's tracking you?" Forgot what it's called though but it looks cool. Has Ashley Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, and some other person in it. Some white guy. He's famous I know but I forgot his name. Anyways now time for our Feature Presentation. Wow I should be a movie commentator.^_^.No maybe not. I'd be cut...  The movie was pretty good.....I won't ruin any of it though, so you go find out yourself. Steph was jumpy through the whole thing lol and Rebecca was hiding under her coat for a bit of it. THAT was hysterical. I was surprised to see that Ashton Kutcher can actually be serious though. It was actually a REALLY good movie. Though I was confused for some of it......in the end it all tied together. I'd actually wanna go see that movie again. Well maybe not....but I think it's a DVD buyer for sure. Try not to pirate it it's really worth seeing.  Well after the movie I played DDR with Josh at Silvercity. I've really got VERY out of shape. I can't even play heavy D2R anymore. I got a D on it *shudder* but somehow I managed a C for Hysteria. Meh. I really need a new pad......and a mod chip....and DDR Extreme.  Or if I'm rich enough I'd just buy the machine from Japan. ^_^. But I don't exactly have  10k handy so no. Anyways after playing some DDR, and watching some white kid suck at it lol I got a ride from Jason to my house.....where I'd find out I'm the only one home. Not much to do at 10pm though.  Well now I'm gonna go eat, finish some piano, then play Silent Hill 3 for a bit. Then sleep. So I'll blog more tomorrow as usual. Wonder what the seminar is gonna be like. Hope it's gonna be somewhat amusing. Heard it's in english so no need to strain to listen to Chinese. Well I'm Gone. Later.

       1/29/04   WHOO! DONE EXAMS AND LONG WEEKEND!   Yes I'M FINALLY DONE! Not exactly Navy SEALS hell week just yet....but it's a high schooler's version of it. Dreaded exam week. Well today wasn't extremely exciting...... nor was it very long. I woke up late and I'll probably sleep early for once. *GASP.*  Well since my music exam wasn't until 2, I slept in till 11. Actually originally my plan was to sleep until 9 and practice but screw that I thought, which I now regret. I ate, played a wee  bit, then left.  Today was the final day of exams. For some people it was a holiday......but for me I had my dreaded music exam as mentioned before. And dreaded it was. Slaugtherhouses probably look better than the sound that was coming out of my trombone today. But I don't think I did THAT bad. Least I think I passed. Hopefully. Well after going through that, I got out of the music room and was on my way to.........  GETTING MY LCD MONITOR!!!!!^_^  YAY! I got to the place around 3, and picked it up. Boxes for these things are so small compared to CRT ones. It was like a briefcase. Well anyways yeah after that I got home.  Goodbye 7 year old radiation CRT.....Hello Flatscreen LCD. My old CRT probably emitted more radiation than the Nuke in Hiroshima. Low Radiation my ass. Well maybe for 97 it was. But anyways.......yeah I finally got LCD monitor. Really happy w/ it =P. I can actually turn my monitor brightness up and my eyes don't burn. Whoo hoo!^_^.  Actually SC wasn't bad. Played w/ Alex and Jason for a bit. Then one of Jason's old clan members came and we played a 3v4 melee game. Well it was looking good at the beginning........Until Jason fell apart. Then he ran to my base, where I held out for the both of us. His friend *Sauron- is his B.Net name* then fell apart when a fleet of BC's came and clobbered him. Then my base was the center of fighting. 3 people trying to hold out on a spit of land meant for only one person. It made HK look like a rural area. That's how crowded it was. It was a piece of land with a missle turret around every corner and other buildings to replace the ground that has no buildings. Well it was pretty funny to watch. Got REALLY crowded. But I can't really describe it in a funny way.  Anyways....see like I said I didn't do much today. Just did music exam then went out for afternoon. Then SC'd, CS'd, Drummed and stuff for a bit and that's basically it. Well I'm gone. I wanna sleep.

       1/28/04   ALL EXAMS DONE!......except for music playing test   After 4 grueling days of hardcore examinatiosn and studying.....I'm finally done!. No wait.......crap I still have music. Well that will kinda be a breeze. Up until now I still hate arpeggios with a passion. Scales are easy though and the songs are just a joke. But yeah my blog isn't about the future it's about well the sorta present.....well what happened today. So here's the day story...  Well though science exam was @ 12, me and Jason decided to go study at the library before the exam. So I woke up aorund 850, and we met up at Galleria around 930ish. Well the studying actually did a lot for me. Refreshed my memory a lot. Well I also bought some food from the Cafe at the library. Unfortunately they didn't accept debit uner 5 bux, so I had to buy something else. Bought Jason a orange cream soda drink which he described as "a giant Campino." I had reg. coffee and a muffin that Jason would eventually eat. Well throughout the studying we had some pretty dumb jokes, and also Jason pointed out that cirrus clouds looked like the Flying Nimbus *Maggie if you're reading this you can see that I'm not the only person that uses cartoons to remember clouds lol* from Dragon Ball Z. Yes I have weird ways of remembering things. Like the Dodge Stratus I knew was a car and its a low value car, and stratus clouds are low level clouds. Ok shut up if your laughing right now...Hmm what else happened....Oh yeah I made a dollar from throwing paper into a garbage can. Don't asks lol. Well yeah we basically did that until 11:20 when we started walking to school then.  Well after a ten minute walk...........we were at school. Talked to Ryan, Steve, Nikola, Milosz and some other people for a bit before the exam. I would eventually then go upstairs and talk to Hammond and Korpela for a bit. Then.....it was time.......for the dreaded science exam....l  DUN DUN DUN!  Actually it wasn't that hard.....pretty ez if u ask me. Weird though. I seemed to remember a lot more. I think that my prayers really did come through for me. I remembered things I didn't even look over like lab diagrams. I think God really was guiding me when I asked for guidance throughout this exam. Also dunno why but this one question about clumpy clouds cracked me up. Don't know why......just the word clumpy lol. But anyways enough with that. Now we pretend the exam is over....and I am now speeding 1:30 minutes past the beginning of this paragraph.....  Well we all left the exam.....i actually didn't use extra time for once. I met up w/ Thompson  and Jason. Well originally Hammond and Steve were w/ us too....but then they left. Well we decided to wait for Hammond actually at first cuz he WAS gonna come *which he sorta did at the end but Webstation was full and we ended up at Webstation so Hammond couldn't find us* and we saw Lindsay Murphy and Giles. Well she was looking for Finlan and supposedly he was still writing exam. Oh wait Hammond was still with us I think at this time. Well maybe not. Point is we were bashing on Finlan a lot. He got a lot of disses thrown behind his back lol. Like this one where I said he probably thought March Break was in January and Jason said let's test that theory out *pretends to call him.* And then Hammond told this one funny story about him lol. Well Hammond ended up walking Teefy to Richmond St. and then did go to Webstation..but we didn't know and Webstation was full so we ended up at Head 2 Head which I must say wasn't a bad descision. Wasn't bad at all. Reasons why I like Head 2 Head better than Webstation: they have food, better comps, and a bigger selection of games. BUT, Webstation actually LOOOKS good. Those SC posters and D2 posters are so cool. Well anyways yeah in the end Me, Thompson and Jason went to Head 2 Head and played there for a while.....  The new most awesome game in my mind: Battlefield 1942. or C&C Generals. I got addicted to BF 1942 and most of my time was spent playing that. Played Omaha like usual, then Stalingrad, and a bunchload of other stuff. Then C&C generals my comp acted up w/ graphics so I had to switch comps. Anyways Thompson had to leave a bit early cuz of hockey, while Me and Jason stayed for an extra 30 mins or so then left. I bused home while Jason walked.  Oh yeah today I really felt the crapiness of Fido phones. I was outside w/ reception and for some reason I couldn't Call ANYONE. Anyways back to the day......  Got home around 6:30.......ate.......then started practicing trombone. Oh yeah Anton and Jonny and Calfun have no life and decided to pull the Arnold Schwarzenegger thing on me. Like that thing isn't old. I was doing that in Grade 7. They really need to find something to occupy their time. They make 8 year olds look mature enough to run a company. Well anyways enough of that.......yeah I started practicing trombone and stuff.....then called Hammond to see when my exam time was. Yes I did forget what time it was at. Anyways yeah that's basically my day....not very exciting......but Head 2 Head was a lot of fun. But how much can you really describe internet Cafe's? It's pretty difficult Anyways I'm gone....gonna eat then run over trombone songs. Cya.

       1/27/04   All exams gone....except science and music   I wish exam week was longer sometimes....then I could have longer break. Oh well I still have tomorrow and thursday left for exams. Well thursday kinda doesn't count because it's only a 10 minute music exam. But yeah science.....is the biggest thing im worried about right now. Weather unit never got through my head. I'm still back with Nomenclature. Lucky most of the exams on that ^_^.  Well least science doesn't start until 12. Me and Jason are planning to study at the library tomorrow morning. Today was pretty fun though....though I had an english exam but that would be forgotten within minutes after I was done.....  I woke up at 7am this morning. Woke up early on purpose in case the "snowstorm" from last night left any work for me. Apparently there was no storm. Just a few droplets of freezing rain. Well I didn't shovel in the morning.....and instead ate and just bolted out the door for school.  I would arrive at school pretty early....8 o clock. I woulda thought it'd take at least 40 mins today since last nite was supposed to be chaotic w/ freezing rain and 15 cm of snow...which by the way never happened.  But yeah I got to school at 8, chatted with some people for a bit *until 8:30* and then went to room 136 to write my exam.  WOW what a joke. Though I think I didn't do good on it I really don't care. The thing was out of 20. What kinda exam is this? our English test was longer about Animal Farm. Well, since I an hour and a half to write this exam..........and being used to theory exams I took the full time plus extra time..........I finished just at the very last minute like usual. Me, Sarah Pearlmutter, and Mike McQueen were the last people I think. Well when I got out finally after wasting the extra time and reg. time, I was about to call Jason........before I realized he was only 6 feet away from me. Wow......I'm very intelligent. You can see why it takes me almost 2 hours to write a exam out of 20. So yeah I saw John Thompson too, and we went out for lunch.....Burger King. WHOO! It was only 1030 so I got a breakfast. BK breakfasts kill McD's I think. Well Thompson and Jason got whopper n a coke..........eeew...............and I sat there w/ my double double coffee and croissanwich....oh yeah and a few hashbrowns.  Afterwards........I WAS gonna go study.....but Jason and John HAD to go to webstation after a 20 minute talk about SC. Got us into gaming mood. Well just our luck. Today was toonie tuesday.....and January was free membership month. So now me, Thompson, and Jason all have memberships at Webstation. Shweet. Though I didn't have $$$, Jason covered for me....actually he covered for all of us lol. Well we originally payed for an hour, but would be extended when two of their comps froze with BF 1942. Both of them were mine. Jason and Thompson were happily playing BF while I was sitting there......on msn. Whoo. Well originally we did start w/ SC but then we all decided why pay to play SC? So we ended up getting an extra 30 mins for inconvenience, which would drag into 45 mins......and we would be gaming for almost 2 hours. Thompson would eventually join me in a game of Call of Duty....which I have to say blows ass compared to BF.......can't believe Hermann likes it. Lol it was funny watching Jason's style of play compared to Thompson. Jason's a very detailed and serious person.....so he kinda sniped and actually took cover n stuff. Thompson the Quake Freak just ran around on the beachhead *Normandy level* and shot up everyone with PanzerShrecks and machine guns and grenades. Lol funny as hell to watch. Well after about an hour Thompson left cuz he had a music exam........I would then take over his comp and start to play BF w/ Jason. So much fun. Paul and Adrian are right when they say it's a fun game. I was addicted to it in seconds. Though I didn't have good aim......that's not an issue. I learned from Call of Duty that a submachine gun is your best friend at all times. While I was fighting on the ground.....Jason was desperately trying to fly a plane with a keyboard. He crashed 5 times and Paul nor Adrian ever told me how to fly a plane lol. I'm definitely getting BF1942 if I get a new comp.  Well after they kicked us outta webstation......we finally decided to go to the library to study. Jason couldn't study at all. I got some stuff back into my head. I pretty much know all chemistry now. Lol Jason was complaining we had been there for such a long time.....before I told him we had only been there for only 30 minutes. Lol. but it did seem like an hour though. Well since both of us had cells.....we were so bored we WERE gonna do this REALLY stupid idea I came up with......surprising no it came from me. Well I would call Gavin, and he would call Josh, and then we'd put the phones up together and make it sound like Josh and Gavin called each other. WE WERE REALLY BORED. Well Jason would end up leaving around 2ish and I would leave around 2:30. I studied a bit more and then renewed my book. Then I rushed to the bus stop.  Perfect timing. I just got on the bus. Whoo. Looked at my cell phone that uncle gave me to waste time on.......apparently it can save calls. Jason called once.....well then twice. Meh. Called him back......talked for a bit..then walked home. I then called Patrick to see if he wanted to play NFL street. He came over for about 3 hours. We got a lot further into the game. AFter he left.....I beat the first ladder. Then I started to study. Not much happened.  After I ate dinner.........dad came home. Apparently the aftermath of the "snowstorm" began to show. The car couldn't make it up the driveway. So out came the snowblower. First time I've used it for more than 5 minutes. It's actually pretty useful.....but loud. Well dad went to do grandma's house, while I sat on our driveway clearing the ice off. You can actually see the black driveway. The glory of seeing total black driveway.  Now I'm gonna sleep.....tomorrow I have to study at 9 @ library. Cya. And of course do my science exam.

       1/26/04   A Day of relaxing....aaahhhh   Whew.....kinda surprising. Only a matter of 2 days before I have to sit in a room for my science exam. Wow. Tomorrow....english exam but I'm not worried. it's english. But yeah today was spent as relaxing and just doing w/e I want. So yeah today I don't have much to write about. I feel like Strong Bad when he let The Cheat write his email that one time...  Well I woke up around 11 today.........wow........on a monday. Feels so good. Heehee no school. Feel sorry for Patrick. He had to write math exam today hahahahahahaha. Stupid 9er. Well anyways I called him up around 12 and basically from 12-3:30 we played NFL street. We got REALLY far. It was really fun too. We got further in 10 minutes today than we would have in 3 hours yesterday. We actually have a decent team too. I think I might buy this game. It's REALLY addictive. And it'll be my first sports game. Hmm....yeah not much else to say......  Daves family came......not dave or tommy but their family. They ate dinner here and stuff then left. I just practiced music and then studied. That's basically it.  See my day was pretty boring and relaxing today. Fit in SC, PS2 and studying. If only tomorrow were like this also...but NOOOO stupid english exam. Lates.

       1/25/04   First Pastoral Ordination Attended in Life...put me into some new thoughts in life   Hmm.......today really was a pretty important day. I mean, though I've never known what a pastoral ordination was....when I attended it today....it really was something special. And it's kinda funny. A few questions ringing in my head earlier today....which I'll list now were answered:  -How come it seems sometimes LCAC never grows? -Is there such thing as an "unblessed" church? -Do we go to church to admire the building or admire God?  Well.....while I was on the 2 hour long car ride to Toronto and Back from attending David and Tommy's Dad's Pastoral Ordination......I would think a lot....I mean I didn't really have anyone to talk to....I was the only person around my age in the car. It was pretty boring. Originally Wendy was supposed to come too but our car ran outta space. And it was crammed. Though I ahve a minivan now it still isn't comfy having 7 people in it. But yeah before I sidetrack to the end of my day let's cover the first part of the day.....  I woke up around 8ish today.....and forced myself outta bed around 8:10. Then I would do morning routine and be met with a breakfast of leftover roast beef from yesterday. it was a 24 pound loaf so Paul's and Pat's family didn't really finish the whole thing. We put a few in a box to give to Wendy....but yeah anyways I had some for breakfast. Mom couldn't figure out that my food was still cold so i wasted 10 minutes just trying to microwave it. So yeah I would be late going to Jason's house to pick him up....which by the way I called him in the morning but no one answered. Smart kid. He put it on siilent. And I mean he's actually smart. I was just doing it to piss him off. Didn't work =P. Well yeah we ended up leaving around 8:40ish and picked up Jason around 9:05. We thought we'd be late but we managed. Whew.  English service was pretty interesting. Pastor Mackness was speaking of the fact that we should honour missionaries. It was a pretty meaningful sermon. I read scripture for it. But yeah it was really speaking about how missionaries do so much in this world......and how much courage they really have. I mean sacrificing your life for your religion is pretty deep. Missionaries can be very devoted. However....if you are being a missionary at your will chances are you won't do much good. That was one thing that Pastor really outlined. You can be a good missionary at God's Will or you may be an ineffective one if you are doing it at your will. Scripture was Phillipians 2 19-30 by the way. But he related much of this to Apostle Paul, as he was one of the most talked about missionaries in the new testament. Mike, Dan, and Carmen didn't attend this service though. I wish they did. This service I felt really relates a lot.....especially to everyday Christians. I mean everyday you'll probably not think about "I wonder how those missionaries posted in our prayer requests in our bulletins our doing?" But after this sermon.......I do wonder more about how God's Word is being spread as I'm typing right now......  After service we went downstairs like usual.....talked for a bit.....had some food and then time for Sunday School. Though I wasn't there last Sunday Carmen did recap me on a few things. Basically she said that last week's lesson was about Job's questioning of why he was being "punished" so badly and blamed some things on God. In today's lesson......part II of wrapping up the book of Job *Part III is next week* we talked about how God finally spoke out to him.....and asked Job why he was blaming God for everything. Eventually Job would finally realize what he has done and repents his sin, and realizes that what he was doing was wrong.  This somehow led into a small debate between all of us about if sin was prioritized......if one sin you commit is worse than the other. Josh said no and that a sin is a sin. However, throughout the Bible Gavin and I stated that it always emphasizes loving God and how He is the only God. Gavin would then later on back this up by saying also that if you follow the first two commandments of loving God and loving thy Neighbours....really the other ones would just follow. If you loved someone you wouldn't lie, steal, or kill them. If you didn't love God, you wouldn't go to church, keep the Sabbath holy, or have him being the only God. So really I think what Gavin said makes a lot of sense......and I'm behind him on this one 100%. Steph seemed pretty tired....napping on Jason's fleece...and Calvin was playing with his usual candy wrapper. Wish that we could all one day pay attention for once. I mean a fraction of the class paying attention just isn't that great. I sometimes think that maybe if we all actually participated in class......class would actually be amusing....dunno if the others have thought of this theory yet.  Well afterwards...we ended w/ a closing prayer...and then we just chatted around for a bit. Dunno what the others were doing but I had to go change into my suit for Toronto. Well......the suit was nice....haven't worn it in a while.....and then after I got everything on.......I realized something. Mom forgot dress shoes. So there I was....sitting there trying to think of a way to compensate.......as at that moment I was in a full dress suit and then........old worn out Iverson Questions. Whoo. This really didn't work. Apparently it's the new style in HK.....which sounds REALLY retarted. I'd never wear something like this......though apparently all the "superstars" are wearing this style. No wonder why they aren't famous in North America. Who the heck would wear a Armani suit with Nike walking shoes? So yeah after I figured out this wouldn't work and this would "clash" in quotes from Wendy a while back....I switched back to Golf shirt and Jeans. We finally got on the road after Chinese service was over.....  Well......I can't really say what happened on the road as I slept for most of it. Well on the way to Toronto I was thinking about how our church could change....and this was where I was thinking about suggesting a relocation of  the church. But then I thought this is kind of like saying my church is a place to look at.....not to worship. But then again a nice environment to worship in does affect people. See this is how I fell asleep......brain overdrive....I would slowly fall sleep.......  Well I was awakened by a sudden stop at a service center. I was surprised Dad actually stopped at one. We usually go one way but mom and Kai Mah wanted to eat inside. So we ended up sitting there for an hour....I had four cheeseburgers which "astounded" the other people. Oh yeah and a cup of coffee. I was REALLY bored. I would then ask why would we end up sitting here and eat when we coulda had Dim Sum in Toronto. *Ugh.* Well after FINALLY finishing our food *mom still didn't finish her burger* we finally got back on the road. Oh yeah I started to practice clutching with a Dasani waterbottle in a cup holder. I was TERRIBLY bored.  Well after another 45 minutes we arrived at NCAC. The service was just about to start. Perfect timing. I found Dave and Tommy sitting at the front so I sat with them. It was a pretty cool service actually. We had the area superintendent Doug Wiebe speaking. He spoke REALLY fluent Chinese. I was surprised. It was funny listening to him speak cantonese though. He had good mandarin though. He sounds better than Anton or Jonny though =P. Well it was now that my questions were answered. I was surprised that my questions were answered today. I was complaining yesterday about going to Toronto for only an hour. But I think it was worth it now. To conclude my answers to my questions *in order:*  -A church takes a LOT of time to grow, and I should be patient -There is no such thing as an unblessed church (a church is a church...it is still a House of God) -We SHOULD go to church to worship God, but with human NATURE we sometimes stray away and start to think of how a building looks instead of WORSHIPPING God.  I really was surprised that I had these questions answered. It's as though God had set the whole thing up. Interesting. Predestination? Maybe. I have very complicated thoughts on this whole thing and it would take a whole day of Blogging probably to lay it alll out into text. But yeah I really think that God was listening to me very attentively, and it also showed me that God never ever doesn't listen to you. He's always there. Whether you have a question or not, a rough day or smooth, He's there. Well better summarize this quick. I still did pay attention to the sermon though remarkably even when I was relating this stuff together. Pastor Wiebe was also talking about servants of God....and how a Pastor isn't really exactly a "leader" of the church but more of a "guide." Shepherd. He used the analogy of a Shepherd. Pretty funny. He related how sometimes a member of the church may sometimes cause some hardships with the pastor. This was the sheep "biting" the Shepherd. Lol I was pretty surprised that he came up with this. But yeah ater Benediection for service we ordinated the now Pastor Yu then had a prayer for the now official Pastor Yu. Then pictures. They had the London family and Friends as one group out of the many. I really started feeling how special this day was when I heard that friends from HK came. So I guess a 2 hr. drive was worth it. Especially for an occasion like this.  Well the car ride home was pretty boring. Slept.....practiced manual shifting again w/ a waterbottle *I was TERRIBLY bored* and then we went home. That was basically it. Played SC, then started imaging. I may not be good w/ HTML.....but I can sure as hell image better than Josh at the moment. Jason? I don't know. His banner kills mine. He likes using pictures though. I like starting from scratch and making my own creations. But I like his style too though. Well anyways gettin late. Really I started blogging at 1:30 am I just changed the time so it'll say that I blogged this for the 25th and not 26th. Well I'm off to sleep now.  G'nite.

       1/23/04   History Exam...done. One down...only 2.5 exams left   After a grueling 5 months of school....came exams. History actually wasn't that bad though. NFL street and studying actually paid off at Jason's. I knew most of the stuff on the exam. It wasn't too bad.  Today was somewhat amusing........some parts of it anyways....I think that without studying....or Prayer to God....I think I woulda bombed. Well here's the rest of my day somewhat summarized....  Since Exam started at 830, I woke up around 7:40. Quickly ate some Eggs and Rice then darted out the door. Looked over notes one more time in the car listening to old skool music. Jocelyn Enriquez, Trinear and Friends......all old skool lol. And of course 1991 original Loft. "Hold On" *Not TNT mix Tommy original* is so good. Well I got to school around 8:15....saw MopHead (John Thompson) apparently he's writing his exam two rooms down from me. Wow wasn't that an exciting turn from my typing=P. Exam started at 8:30....and now I am writing....  So easy. Joke course. I guess the world war II and world war I obsessions that me pat paul and colin had from back in grade 7 and 8 really paid off. I remember things that I don't want to remember even. Like honestly who cares what guns were on a British Battleship? Oh well but yeah I took all the time to write the exam.........and would leave the room at 1:10 or so (we got 15 min extension). I think I did relatively good. Hopefully at least. Think I prayed at least 3 times throughout the exam lol. Well now that I'm done.....I went to the bus stop...and bused home.  Now that I am at home.......wow how boring a Friday is. I played NSFU for a bit.......unlocked S2000, got some new parts......and my car is faster now. Then I called up Age, Thompson, Josh, Jason, and Adrian for SC. Eventually none of us would play and I went to UCC since I thought Stefan and them would be there sessioning. I left around 1 and took the bus down to the UCC.....  Ugh I was wrong. NO ONE was there. SO I ended up working out for a bit.....not a great idea considering I would go back to breakdance at 5. Ugh. My arms are beat now. Can't even feel triceps. But then after realizing they wouldn't come around this time in the afternoon.....I bused back home.....  Now it's around 3pm or so. Played some NFSU, then got a game of SC going w/ Age, Jason, Josh and Myself of course. It was a chaotic game. We didn't know what we were doing and we were kinda screwed over. Age got killed 15 miutes into the game and Jason would end up limping his lone Engineer bay to Josh's. I was relatively safe with a Fort Knox going and Josh had his usual lurker D going. We both kinda got screwed over when they brought in the carriers.  Oh yeah during the game I got a phone call from Mike......They were at the UCC. Great. Right when I leave they arrive. I would later find out that when I got  there Stefan just let. Great timing by all today. Well eventually I would then get a drive down there.....and Igor, Mike, Dan, Jonny, and Anton were there. Well supposedly more people were there but I didn't see em. Well I would but not at the moment. Anton got Adidas Superstars. Geez seems like everyone has them now. And the thing is he still doesn't break. His original excuse was he didn't have the shoes to break *though he has K-Swiss* and lugz at one point. Now he has no excuse and he still doesn't break. Retard. Well yeah now to rant on about the session...  SESSION SUCKED....well for me anyways. Actually it wasn't  too bad.....but just the fact I worked out before I went breaking screwed me over completely. Steve was right when he said don't work out before session. Well eventually my strength would come back. I went from 2 hops for crickets to 10+. Though my hops r kinda loud cuz I made them smaller......I made a lot. Ugh now I have to quiet down my hopping. I got around 6 rounds of turtle...........Oh yeah and my Pikes are getting better. If I could post a pic up I would. Actually I can but I'm too lazy. If you wanna see it look at my display pic....when I get the pic up. Umm session by the end wasn't too bad. Eventually Brescia, Jeff, and some other people would come too. They were going out to somewhere to eat......Mike n Dan were gonna go but they didn't. Well I'd be there till 7:30....Stefan and Sergei and Mike and Evan came around 7ish or so........yeah that's where I found out Stefan came earlier just before I came. He pulled a nice Turtle Windmill combo. Really smooth. And like usual the other 3 did lots of fancy stuff. I had to go though @ 7:30....chinese new year dinner.  Well now I'm at the dinner. It was just my family. We ate....then talked......and now I'm blogging. Still gotta do piano which i'm going to do now. Cya.

       1/22/04   GOUNG HEI FAT CHOI TO ALL......and I got a history exam   Wow.....time really flies. I can still rememer the first day back from summer holidays when I first walked into history class and thought.....wow this is gonna be one slow year. Turns out I'm wrong. Now it's already January 22nd......2004. Chinese New Year was today....that's what the greeting was for in my subtitle. But this year I hope will be a prosperous year. So far I've been having a good year academically. Trying to stay above the 80 mark. So far its paying off. Today I found out I ended with a 92% on my careers project....my mark is gonna be at least a 82. Usually my mark estimates are decent. So the action packed exam week is starting tomorrow. Whoo hoo. First up to the plate.....History. Dreaded history. Though it's my highest mark...I hate exams. I really think I won't do that amazing on it. I forgot lots of the crap we've learned. But that's ok.......with the mark I have in history....i'm unstoppable....sorta. Today was pretty exciting though in ways....tried new ps2 game, got good final project mark in careers, and surfed the net in programming. And of course went to Jason's house to study history w/ Hammond and him.....Here's the detailed summary....you have to scroll down a bit......  Once again.......RELUCTANT TO LEAVE BED! UGH especially with my sleeping times.... tonight I really gotta sleep early for exam tomorrow. Well I woke up around 730....trudged downstairs to see a bowl of oatmeal staring at my bloodshot eyed face......well ate it......then quickly washed my hair to get bedhead out....changed.....grabbed school crap *and Jason's controller and NFSU for his house after school* and bolted out the door.  Weird.....today Patrick's mom and dad drove us to school. I guess his mom was going somewhere. Looked like skiing. But yeah traffic was horrible today. Oxford was gridlocked from Talbot intersection all the way to wonderland intersection. Well eventually we would make it out and I barely made it into class on time. But yes I made it. Wow so exciting there.......the action of running up 3 flights of stairs to history...I should have a theme song and a stunt double for this sort of action...  History we basically just did review.....I feel a lot more relaxed now about tomorrow's exam. Not as tensed up as before. Also I don't have to worry because we got updated marks again. My mark is still above 90 so I don't really care. Weird though today. People sitting in front of me were trying to name all 50 states in USA. I was thinking how boring history could get....I mean naming 50 states? Isn't that worse? I tried to name a few in my head.....got to like 45. Well yeah announcements came on and off to careers....  WHOO! Careers we finally finished movie "Finding Forrester." It was actually a really good movie. Very meaningful. And I think that my prayer requests and prayers really did pay off.....92% on my careers project. This is a big jump from 72% mark in November. I'm happy w/ my mark. Me and Hammond ended up studying for chem exam next wednesday. Then Hammond started to threaten me with a blue Sharpie. Whoot i got hit. Now lunchtime.....  Ended up going to McD's w/ Thompson and the others. Apparently Nathan heard about the pushing into snowbanks from the other day.....Mike got a bite back in the ass from when he pushed Thompson yesterday...Thompson rocked him today lol. Then at McD's we started throwing our cheeseburger wrappers *we had A LOT of cheeseburgers* and then we almost got kicked out.....stupid customer satisfaction. Then Thompson made a bet w/ me and nate that he could hit Maisie sitting at the other table. Damn. It grazed her lol NOT HIT but grazed. So therefore we don't owe him anything =P. So yeah after that little wrapper war we started walking back to school......with attempts to snowbank nate. Never worked. He almost got me and Thompson simultaneously. That was pathetic. But yeah we chased him back to school with crap attempts.....and now to math class.....  Math class we didn't do much.....got some h/w and did it.....Thompson was getting hell though. Jessica was drawing on the back of his neck and i got his face w/ a whiteboard eraser. He turned into Justin Rhoden for a sec....you know an Oreo. Well eventually he'd go clean it off, and he'd get me back by hitting chalk brushes in front of me. Bastard. Not much else happened. Thompson tried on glasses.....lol he frickin hilarious. Forgot who I said he looks like but he looked REALLY funny. Anyways after the math......hmm.....oh yeah now programming class....zzZZzzzZzZZzz.....  Programming like usual was w/ Hyperstudio. But since I was done.....I surfed the net for a while. Looked at some blog sites, NHL stats, and of course my fantasy teams that I made. I'm still in 6th place. Stupid Thompson's London Chinese. Ugh. Oh yeah we also got our tests back today finally. Got 73% on one and 80% on the other. Not bad considering half the class failed both. Turing was somewhat challenging but I'm happy that we learned it. Now at least I know the basics of programming. Sorta. Hmm........not much else happened......Day 1's are so boring. I just noticed that. Though I like the subjects better it's actually REALLY boring. Well who cares enough of that time to go to Jason's.....   Well I met Jason at his locker, then we went to mine....got my stuff....then left. I remember Hammond wanted to come study too but Jason apparently wants to get home ASAP. Well eventually Hammond caught up to us and greeted me with a friendly push into the snowbank. Ugh. That's 1.5 today. I ALMOST got pushed in at lunch but instead of falling in i somehow managed to land in the knee high snow on my feet and ran back out of the snowbank. DAMN WAS IT COLD! We eventually made it to Jason's, with my complaining of how a car seems faster. Obviously. But Jason's house is actually pretty far from Central. We got to his house probably around 3:15 and were met by a box of donuts and well......burned Leen Goe. Apparently Jason's dad can make it *he's a chef too* but his mom isn't that great at it.....it looked like "Crap with Caramel sauce" quoted from Hammond. Well we started off the study session with a game of NFSU, then some NFL street.....but I didn't really play and started studying. Jason was still playing NFL Street when me and Hammond did some studying....then some chatting....eventually Jason would join for  bout 20 minutes.....then started playing again. Hammond left around 5ish and I started to do more intense studying. I actually got some stuff done. Oh yeah Jason's mom gave me and Hammond Lai See. Jason's familiy is actually very generous. I was surprised I got one. I would then give one to Jason too....well my mom would.  But that would be later. Jason would then put on Rush Hour 2 to watch while I studied also.....while he kept working on NFL street.... I would go on his comp for a bit.....then back to studying. Eventually I woulda stueid straight from 5:30-630ish. Then I thought might as well try NFL street though it looked stupid. WOW IS IT FUN! Though it makes no sense compared to real football it's just funny how me and Jason played. I didn't really know how to play so I was horrible @ D but I was decent on offense. Made a few completions and lots of run plays. Lol Jason's not the most amazing QB but the stuff he did was pretty funny. 30 yard dropbacks, 50 yard passes, running when he figured out I can't run routes that well in a football game. Yeah it was pretty funny some of the stuff that happened. I might buy the game. Actually.......naw. Rather buy Silent HIill 3, or Grand Turismo 4 when it comes out. But yeah Jason's house actually is pretty cool place. He has food.  Also it was nice to see that he has his Bible by his bed. I'm assuming he reads it. He was pretty enthusiastic about it when he first got it. Pretty nice Bible though. And it seems to have benefited. He has grown spiritually faster than Dan or Mike. Dunno if it's maturity level or the fact a Bible helps this much....but it's nice to see how fast he's started his walk of faith. It's cool though. And he's taken in this stuff pretty nicely. I mean no offense to Gavin but when he first came to church he REALLY despised it it seemed like. But of course after 5 years he seems to be enjoying the environment. I still think we need a bigger church...and a new building. But that will come in time.....  Well by now after playing a few  round of NFL street my mom came.....so packed up my stuff and went home. Exhausted now......cramming for history tomorrow....and of course practicing music. I really wanna do good in music. Well anyways it's around 1130 now.......and I'm still studying. One big prayer tonight.....God's guidance with my exams....and of course the others. Wonder how they are taking exam week in. Carmen seems to always be stressed out with like daily homework. Josh usually is pretty serious w/ work. Dunno bout Steph or Gavin. Calvin I guess he's pretty relaxed bout this.....like everything else. I'm pretty laid back about exams. Just science I'm worried about. History I'm not worried......just kinda scared I'll just blank out in exam tomorrow. But then again I normally anticipate exams and big tests waay too much than it actually is. I mean math midterms studying for three hours? I think I went overkill. But it paid off. 86%. So I guess though I sacrificed piano.......i did good in school. Well I'm gonna go study a bit more....then get a good night's rest before my horrid exam tomorrow.  To end this entry....Have a few things to say  Sun Leen Fai Lok (Happy New Year) Hok Yeep Juun Bo (Hope your learning is ongoing in new year) Goung Hei Fat Choi (basically means may good fortunes bestow on you in new year)  and of course.....  SUN TAI GEEN HONG (be in good health)  I think that one's important because to me it's telling you......hopefully you stay healthy enough to make next new years =P. Well I'm out. Good luck to everyone on exams. Later.

       1/21/04   Multitasking....exams inch closer and closer   As I'm speaking.....er writing right now, I am also listening to music, studying, and on msn. Wow multitasking......what would I ever do without it? Uhh...single-tasking?  Well life's been average like usual, nothing much happened....I mean it's London. No murders, suicides, but there was a sewer gas explosion in downtown a few days back. There's still maintenance on that accident. Lol sewage gas exploding who woulda thought. Blogging has been kinda slow I realize lately.....not as much effort as before....so tonight I'll try to make this one another average Joe blog....  It was band today....."woot." Not. Like usual I woke up at 6, did usual morning routine....and jumped out the door around 6:45 or so. I got there think 5 minutes late. Not like Mr. Clark cares....but he does get pissed off when people don't go to band. We sounded ok I guess........one song sounded like crap.....but the Fugue sounded good. Oh yeah Zavitz got his red Adidas track suit. Makes my black one look kinda degraded. Argh Now I want a red one.....or a green one. Wait...green? Weird. I wanted a red one....but I'm not just about to bite someone else's style. Black track suit for me. I'll get a blue one eventually. Hmm.....not much else happened....oh yeah Meaghan stuck to her Wednesday Track Suit thing....she seems to always wear it on a Wednesday like she said lol. Well now I'm off to rant about music class.....  Well at first we sounded good......but then we started playing scales. We sounded like....*shudder.* It was the worst....and I think he was bulding up momentum to his PMS state.....because after we started playing another song.....and Connor and Arjun entered at the wrong bar......he was like PMSing. "Releasing his Tiger" according to Mr. McCumber. Wth? I just call it PMS. Music class was pretty funny though. Thompson was dressed as a "wanksta" with a tambourine around his head. Watch out reppin' the T-Crew. And Justin Deyell desperately tried to get his civics commercial together......Lol that was just terrible. Then after the PMSed Mr. McCumber, crap commercial, and crap playing.... came announcements and off to second period.  Now science was boring like usual......did lots of notes.......Well keep scrolling down to the next part nothing to write about here....  Now we are into lunch. It was Ally's B-day *Happy B-day Ally!* and so we went to Jasper's Cafe....  SO DAMN EXPENSIVE! But meh......nice place though.....and it's worth it....sorta. The poutine had actual gravy and not that XOXO crap from A&P, and it wasn't bad. Chris left a bit early for some reason......and the rest of us ate for a while. Mike got the sweetest meal....swiss mushroom melt burger w/ fries and tropicana jiuce.........all for 7 bux. Not bad considering the quality....beats Williams. And a lot of people came today. Pokan, Hermann, Eddie, Steve, Mike, Ally and her posse of people, Jessie, Wilson, Brescia, And I think the girl's name is Suzie (spelling?). And now we are all heading back to school. I'll consider going to Jasper's again. Not bad of a place....and it's more luxurious than William's I think.  Now off to bio. we did work. Lab, worksheet, lots of crap. Once again I zoned out at the wrong time and misheard the instructions.....causing Ms. Wiener to once again poke fun at my zoning out at the wrong time. Well in the end Robert told me what was going on but I am so out of it in Bio.......sleep time I think. Well we didn't really do much else......yeah even if we did it's not important. Off to English.  English was amusing. We had to temporarily be evicted from our usual room due to re-painting, so we just read this class and listened to Mrs. Gayed read for almost 40 minutes. Then we had to answer a few questions out loud....then PICTIONARY! Total Chaos lol. with lots of yelling of random movies......and of course random body parts too from people like Kurtis. We have very artistic people in our class...for forrest gump some person drew two legs with holes....and someone yelled FORREST GUMP. I'm surprised lol. well now the bell's rang by now....talked to some people......set tomorrow for studying @ Jason's house.....and while I'm at it play NFL street....wanna see what the game's like.  I actually talked for a while, then I ended up running out the door when I was stopped by Steph Bourdage. It's been like the 10th time she told me to write about her in my blog. Someone is just a bit greedy about fame. I mean first of all it's a blog I'm writing in. I only get like 20 views a day....maybe 30.....honestly I doubt some person will read this and go OMG STEPH!?!!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Then again sewer gas exploded under Galleria so who knows....=P. I then met up with Steve and Eddie and walked to my stop. Talked to them for a bit. Found out Eddie used to run....a lot. But now they had to go another way....sooo.... Well now I rush to my bustop...  DAMNIT! Forgot King street's blocked off....so I had to run down dundas trying to keep up with the 9A....when then all of a sudden the Dundas shows up. I KNOW! I'll take the Dundas....then transfer at next stop.......how smart of me ^_^....and it worked lol. Some other kid *Rui-Ming by name I think * was surprised how fast I got to that stop. He ran his ass off while I sat.....literally. Heehee......slacking off to its maximum. Well I walked home after I got off bus....and then sat on MSN for a bit, ate a lot. Oh yeah sent Thompson "Quake in Real Life." He seems hysterical about it....there hasn't been one person that hasn't laughed at that video....then my mom FINALLY took me to go look at a new monitor.....  Car ride was pretty amusing. Lots of snow......I slept. Mom woke me up when we arrived....for some reason she parked near the end of the lot when there was a space right beside the store....sorta. Well didn't matter for me.....I kinda got used to the cold from walking home from bus stop. Well I ended up putting down an order for a Samsung 17"LCD....model's like 170 or something like that. YES ONLY A WEEK OF WAITING! Can't wait. My monitor right now....7 years old....and probably produces more radiation than a Nuclear Power Plant. So now all i have to do is withstand this monitor for another week and WHOO! NO MORE RADIATION! well some but not as much. Now I go to Dragon Court to pick up dinner. And off to home....  Got home.....played some NFSU......sat around.......did some stuff......then  dad came home. I had to shovel the driveway.......AGAIn. And then off to theory.  Theory was usual.........didn't do much but I should catch up soon. Everyone was dead tired.  And back here now..........on the comp.....studying...........looking around.......gonna eat soon......gonna practice Trombone soon......MSNing.......LIstening to music. Gotta still do Devos too. Wow I'm really stressed out right now. I just hope  that HYPE prayers list got through to everyone too. Seems as though sometimes it doesn't work with some emails. Well I'm gonna go finish up work then do Devos then sleep. Cya people later.

       1/20/04   TRIUMPH IN MATH CLASS! Oh yeah and uhh....more snow.   WHOO HOO! After much studying and hard work........IT'S PAID OFF! 86% on my math midterms! SHWEET! This will take me outta the 70's. Well at first I thought all that work for nothing because I didn't answer 3 questions.......but thanks to good old multi choice......I have suceeded! Today's day actually wasn't bad... not much work. Got my careers presentation over with...and yeah that's basically it.  Well today Patrick was sick.....so instead of getting a lift from him my mom had to drive me to school today. Was about 5 minutes late since I was notified around 7:40 or so.......but that's ok it's only history. I wasn't the only one late. More people came afterwards. Well we copied down exam outline. Ms. Manson was yelling like usual about our loudness. Well "yelling." She couldn't yell if her life depended on it. And we got some review Q's to help us. Then came announcements and off to careers...........  Careers......I finally presented. I think it went well. In the end I ranted a bit about why I sorta changed my mind on job career path from CGA to something different......but now that I'm doing good in gr. 10 math......tides have turned. And then we went to a winter sports team assembly. Guys Bball, Girls V-Ball, and hockey of course. Then there was curling. Lol. And we honoured the junior boys volleyball team who won WOSAA, and X- Country and Girls senior bball team....who all won something. Then Ms. Young-Kipp was ranting about how we really need a gym floor. I agree. I hate tiling. Sucks. And then lunch.......  Mmmm......BK......like usual.  Now time for math. This is where I found out I got a good mark on midterms. Mike did too. Half our class failed. Whoo hoo. I forgot what the hell I did in that class. Oh yeah we had to write "goals." Mr. G. gave me half a sheet of paper by accident instead of the whole thing....so I had to glue together the two he gave me. 90 degree angle writing. skillz...........  Now time for programming.....uhh........no action......no circle strafing from Icy beating Pokan. Nothing. Just pure boredom  Now to summarize the time from 3-10........  Came home, ate lots of food, SC, drummed, showered, ate more, did h/w,, played trombone,  played NFSU, watched TV, ate,played piano, blogged, fixed blog site, read stuff, twidled thumbs, looked around, drank milk, stared at comp screen and typed on MSN, yawned, and now I'm gonna sleep. Cya.

       1/19/04   Fending off powder snow is easy....until his ally packing snow came...ugh   Nature can usually be your friend. You know, with the water, and sun, and grass and stuff. But when it comes to winter......it can be your worst enemy. It's like one of those female spiders that backstabs her mate by eating him after mating. Geez is Mother Nature much like the same right now I feel. Right now I'm kinda half dead.....shoveling the powder snow was a breeze.....but when it came to shoveling the crap at the end of the driveway that Merry Old City of London happily shoveled on......wow was it a workout. As I'm typing.....the stupid 4 feet squared of snow on the front of my driveway is still waiting there. Stupid Snow. Thinks it can make it's presence on my driveway like that. Grrr.....I'd blow it up if i had dynamite. Well now I'll leave this blog on, go have some dinner.....then shovel the damn driveway again.....  Well, now after a victory over the ruthless packing snow......and a cold dinner since I had to reshovel......I am now sitting on my comp typing up blog and practicing my trombone. For a Monday, this one's been somewhat mellowed out. Since I had no homework on Sunday I have some tonight........some Bio and Math. It was good to have it so relaxing......Exam Prep week is gonna be pretty crowded and jammed up for me. Lots of studying. Wanna keep my History mark and Science mark up in the 80's. English I don't know what I have and Music I don't have to worry about. Well anyways summary of my day as usual....not much else to talk about for my after school life.....with almost everyone bogged in h/w....  Woke up......went to school around 7:50......that is basically my morning. Ate also of course and usual hygiene stuff....  Music we had a theory exam......seriously I still don't know what the hell the pattern method is good for.....why don't they just teach key signature.....stupid retards. Well the test was a joke. Finished it in the 1st ten minutes.......and for some reason Mr. McCumber seems to think quarter notes and eighth notes are threatening during rythmic dictation. Wow. I really think my music class is getting more and more pathetic.  Science we started review. I really need this for exam. Some of the stuff I'm not that familiar with like I kinda forgot how to do ionic bonding. But im refreshed now. No singing today. Hmm......science was never too amusing. Bleh.  At the moment I can't really think that well because I'm kinda half tired.....but anyways. Today I stayed in school at lunch......played some basketball. My shot is like usual.......crappy. It's getting better I guess, but I think I should start playing more at lunch again.....besides its kinda cold going outside everyday for lunch. So I played some ball......then went to Bio when the bell rang....  Bio had some laughs. Like usual I was loud.....and asked some ritorical questions but that's ok......Bio always has something new to learn. We watched a very stupid video. Took notes........science courses are always so boring. OH YEAH I REMEMBER NOW! We did this one activity that totally bombed. We were supposed to let our arms dangle at our sides....then after a while blood was supposed to build up, causing the vein to show up so you can see it through ur skin. You then put pressure on it.....and it was supposed to do something that no one in the class could do except Ms. Wiener. Rachel Brown then made a remark that we all don't have veins......or that Ms. Wiener was old. Ms. Wiener gave the weirdest face at that. Lol Bio class is so messed up........but it's usually the funnier part of my day....  English class we had a quiz. Open book =P. So everyone did pretty well. We didnt' really do much....watched some videos from the 50's about socializing. Lol I can't believe they would promote stuff like that back then....so funny. They had videos like "how to become popular" or "how to date." Lol hilarious. Anyways the bell rang......and off to Stage Band X.  We had lots of talking today........lots about Huntsville. I'm bringing my PS2 for sure now. Nick said he's bringing his modded X-Box. Turns out his green light button is red. o0o0o0o0o. And then I somehow went on a rant about how you could break curfew and swim in the pool @ 2am by breaking the window....I think I need social help. We didn't really play today.......we just ran over old pieces cuz we didn't have score to Mission Impossible. And now......I go home.....I was gonna go study w/ Mike n' Dan but was too tired...  Now I'm really tired....so i'll summarize the rest of my day:  -Came home around 5 -Slept till 7 -Did stuff -Shoveled driveway from 8-9:30 -Ate -Did last 10% of driveway end (Stupid packing snow) -Practiced Trombone -Now I sleep. Bye.

       1/18/04   One day I don't have homework...The whole world does   Weird. The one day I actually have no homework and can do something EVERYONE else has homework. Not surprising since exams are coming up but why the heck does this happen on a Sunday? Ugh well since that happened my day was pretty much downright boring. Not much to write about today.  Woke up at around 830 for church. Kinda woke up late today so didn't gel hair or anything. THIS is when a good old hat comes in. I can cover up my hair with my hat. Innovative no =P. Went to pick up Jason. Since we didn't do worship, Pastor Mackness got this person called Dave Butler. He came a few times before but I really think that we should be able to do our own worship within our own church. Well today's message....erm.......well I remember the story. It was about David and the Besor River (spelling?) and about how he basically reclaimed stuff from bandits. Hmm this is great I can't remember what the main message was....  Well after a brief talk with Jason....I now remember. Thanks Jason by the way. Well it was kinda about how though we are followers of God, we still make bad choices. However we are forgiven if we believe. I think that was it. Oh boy this isn't good. Well I think that was it. Slow day. With UWO students out on a retreat there weren't many of us. Well after Offering and Benediction no song of respone since Dave had to leave....so we had announcements and went downstairs.  First thing I did was a great thing to do. Took off my hat and lo and behold......my hair isnt turned into hat hair. It's sticking out everywhere. Thanks a lot FlexFit. Damn. So yeah I had a bit of a bad hairday today. Oh yeah and today was VERY messed up. For some reason Brian Wong tried skin moisturizer *WTH IS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD NOW?!* and then Josh decided to wear Steph's pink scarf today. I decided to wear a scarf as a Turban and walk around pretending I was Taliban. Yes I realize that that was stupid. No worries though. We chatted around for a bit before Me Gavin and Steph volunteered to help with Children's Sunday School. Originally Rebecca and Josh were gonna help too but Pastor Mackness said 3 was enough. So off me and Gavin and Steph went to help with Children's Sunday School...  HOLY CRAP THIS IS ACTUALLY CHALLENGING! Trying to control 22 kids at once is NOT A FUN THING TO DO. And especially what we were doing today....pelting paper balls at someone while they were trying to find a yellow circle. Lol wish I had the pic from my D-Cam uploaded. This room is actually VERY chaotic. I now realize why I was in a way happy leaving CSS (not the internet lingo but Children's Sunday School). Well after about 20 minutes of pure chaos.....it ended off with a "calm" prayer. For some reason all these kids seem to have ADD.I was surprised of how even a 4 year old can be so hyper. Well afterwards it was "San Wui." So everyone was done. Service was over lah lah lah and stuff. I decided to go talk to Colin Ho's dad about making a website for our church. While that happened we somehow dragged Joseph Ma into it too and Josh. Well now we are putting a talk of starting a web design group for our church. Hope it's up and running by June or so. I'm apparently doing imaging. Whoo hoo. Now if only I had a more creative mind. Photoshop's actually very user friendly as later I would find out though. While we were waiting for my Dad to finish cleaning up Jason was trying to read his GMR magazine....but miserably failed with Rebecca and everyone else crowding around him remarking about how Doom 3 looks disgusting. I personally liked the looks of this one game coming out. Fatal Frame or somethin. Supposed to be a combination of Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill 3. Both those games I am interested in. So this game should be good. GT 4 Graphics are AMAZING I also found out today and Starcraft Ghost....now #1 *over Silent Hill 3* on my most wanted games list. LOOKS SO COOL. And it should keep me entertained until StarCraft Two comes out. If it ever happens. Well after Jason FINALLY got a chance to read since everyone else left, we had to leave....  So he read in the car. Reminds me of the time when Patrick told me he read in the car for 4 hours *who the heck would read the Caesar 3 manual?* and then threw up afterwards. Not surprising. Well anyways less sidetracking. Jason went home. I went home and ate and then from like 3-6 I sat on the comp fiddling with photoshop. I WAS going to go to webstation but had no ride and the buses suck like crap. Eventually I ended up sitting home....Playing the piano, drumming, MSN, watching TV. Superstation is now one of the best channels on TV I have just realized.  Well after watching some TV....I went back on photoshop. Made a splashscreen for a HYPE website when it happens. I took a pic of night sky *really nice pic if i could put it on this site but no server so nope.* and then just did some stuff with it. Well after that I watched GI Jane. Not that great of a movie. Then now I'm sitting here......blogging......talking on msn.......n stuff. Can't really recall anything else happening today. Was gonna go snowboard but didnt'. Well now I'm gonna quickly refresh my mind on Grade 2 theory for a test tomorrow then sleep. Later.

       1/17/04   And snowboarding season has Started....for me   Saturday! WHOO! Finally! No more school for the next two days. Today wasn't bad actually.....went snowboarding for most of it.  I woke up at 11pm.....after sleeping @ 2am from playing NFSU and watching MuchMusic. Ate some stuff and practiced some piano before I headed out for my lesson.  My lesson like usual was a lecture about how I should practice 525 minutes a week. Sure like I'd actually do that. My max so far is around 200 mins a week. Nothing higher. I really don't care for practice time. I got out of lessons around 1pm (30 min lesson) and then headed home and got stuff ready for snowboarding.  I never knew that snowboards worked as well as it did today with Candle Wax. I spent around 40 mins cleaning and waxing my board.....then scrounged around for my snowboarding stuff. It actually took me almost two hours to be able to find everything. In the end I made it to Marcello's house around 4ish or so. While at home though I drummed for a bit, watched TV, surfed internet....then left.  We waited for about 15 minutes before Dan Kalmar came. While I was at his house though I finally saw the board Tom Kalazitis gave him that Marcello was trying to sell now. Orange Liquid 5150. I didn't like it personally but it is a decent board. Then Dan came and we left for Boler.  By the time we got there it was around 420ish. Bought our passes and at first we didn't really see anyone we knew. Just me, Marcello, Daniel, and then Scott Sidhu came too. We boarded around for about an hour before we went into the chalet for food. Marcello saw some chicks that he knew, well "knew." They seemed pretty bitchy. Oh yeah found a BBQ lighter for some reason lying around in the chalet. Marcello would be a Pyro for the next 10 minutes then. He burned the table or sometin like that. Then he decided to put the flame into a pop bottle. Obviously the flame went out from suffication. Anyways now back onto the slopes.  When we got out we saw some other girl and this dude called James Hoe. Funny name Hoe lol. But yeah we then went down to the chairlift where we met up with Adrian too. Eventually when me and Age decided to go on the "T-Bar hills" (which now has a chairlift so technically its the "Ex-T-Bar" hills according to Daniel) and me and Age would end up going on the new chairlift hills. The others I don't know where the hell they were. Well in the end we met up after around an hour when Scott had to leave. We went down with him and said bye then we split up again lol. Me and Age went back in forth while Marcello and Daniel stayed on the old Chairlift hills. I don't know what the hell James and the other girl did.....I guess Easy Street since James was new to snowboarding. But yeah we boarded around until 10. I pulled off a small jump from terrain park and also pulled a manual. Nothing else too exciting really. The "races" we had were usual. Dan won w/ inside lane, then Marcello with 2nd most inside lane, then me then Age. It's pretty obvious who wins in our races. Whoever has inside lane. Pretty poorly planned but who cares =P. Boler actually isn't bad now with new Chairlift. Makes life a bit easier and they have Grindrails *Jibs I think?* on the terrain park. Though I didn't get to go on them I did go off the new backbone ramp, where I bailed and also off one of the ramps. Made 1/3 jumps great sucess rate. Notice the sarcasm. Well you can't really when all the typing's the same. After last run we all went home. Marcello n' Dan got a lift from me while Age had his mom to give him a lift. And now here I am sitting at home. Tired.  As you can see I mostly just snowboarded today. Since I woke up @ 11am I missed most of the day. The twins never went today but meh. I still had fun. Least it's a good start to my "season" of snowboarding this year. Stupid global warming. Woulda started in December if it weren't for it. Well I guess that's it. I'm gonna go sleep now. Cya.

       1/16/04   A day of many accomplishments...WHOO!   Today I probably had the most production in any field in a long time. I did well on tests, didn't sleep in classes, got farther in Need for Speed Underground.....and improved with breaking even =P. Summarizing my day in one word would be "SHWEET!"  Today since I slept around 1 yesterday I almost slept in until my mom woke me up @ 730. Ate quickly, dressed and ran out da door by 7:50. Got to school around 8:10 or so...what an action packed morning=P.....sure.  Well history we had a game that we played where we had a given income based on 30's *poor since it was depression" and we had to figure out a budget. I made $17.44 , and I had to cut money from so much crap just to make my budget work. For food I bought 8 lbs of rice (Maisie bought 10 so I'm not that outta proportion) and some other crap. Ms. Manson wasn't convinced that 8 lbs of rice could last a week. SERIOUSLY I'd like to see her eat that much rice in a week. I also had margarine for cooking oil.....and some other crap. She said I woulda died during the depression. My ass....the rice would make steamed rice, baked rice, fried rice, it'd even make good matress filling =P. What a great use for such a cheap substance. Oh yeah and i got 86% on 1920's test. Sweet.  Well off to careers. Didn't do my presentation today as we ran outta time. Pokan was begging me to go before him but I didn't feel like it and also I didn't have enough time. Eventually he went....he did his on kinecieologists or w/e the heck the spelling is. You know those people......sports doctor? Ring a bell? You could tell Pokan was a bit unorganized as he somehow thought 25% and 75% would turn into a 7:18 ratio.Hammond did a Family Physician where he interviewed his mom. Beats careercruising. com I guess. And some other people did some other jobs. No movie today though....now off to lunch.......I was actually hungry for once.  Well me, Thompson, Hermann, Nate and Mike *White one not Chan* went out to Galleria. But before I left saw Finlan. He wore a old Fleury jersey from when Fleury played for Calgary. First it's a team that has always sucked until recently so I feel sorry for someone to be actually wearing that jersey. And 2nd who the hell would wear a jersey of someone that is in rehab and sucks @ hockey? I guess Finlan would. Idiot.  I had pizza from this place called Pete's. It wasn't bad. Then Jessica Wittaker came for a visit to us. "So Thompson how's Lindsay Pratt now?" That one sentence would stir up the biggest convo today. Well we mistook it for fact that Thompson was going out w/ her....when really it was about something else. But it was pretty funny. Thompson was having the biggest embarrasment. Hahaha. Then this would drag on through into math class. Me and Jessica would still be bugging him about it. Then there was also like usual our hockey talk at lunch. Too much to say. We went from local stars to NHL....and of course Mike and his rants about the Knights. WHO CARES? IT'S OHL. But Mike seems hooked about it. And he likes the Oilers so that says something else. Well we are now trekking back *imaginination inserted here* back to school......in the freezing -20+ weather....it was COLD!  Now by the time I got into math class I was an icecube. But thawed out overtime. Like I mentioned before me and Jessica Whittaker *Sorry if your reading this Jess and I spelled your name wrong =P* were still bugging Thompson aboud Lindsay Pratt and what happened at lunch. We somehow then got dragged into talking about semi- formal. If I do go I'm gonna try to get some people to pool in for a Limo. Hopefully I can make this happen unlike last year. Oh yeah then Thompson made a VERY lame attempt to use Nathan's "Got a dog" line on Mr. Gilbert. First of all it's pathetic how he stole that line from Nate cuz it was an inside joke. Advice for Thompson MAKE YOU YOUR OWN JOKE LINES. Anyways, Mr. Gilbert was also pretty funny today. To "cope" with "Grade 10 intelligence" he started writing stuff very slowly. Then we started throwing in ideas on improving his handwriting. I said while he was at it why doesn't he dot the I's w/ hearts n stuff. Eventually he made a demented heart....and over time it would turn into a black square. Eric Bennett then outta random said "Mr. Gilbert your hand looks bony on the overhead." Wth? Seriously THAT is what I call random. Math class actually was pretty funny today though. Kept me awake at least.  Now onto programming. Boring. Looked at sites afterI finished my Hyperstudio project. By the way Hyperstudio makes Microsoft actually look appealing. How bad can educational programs get? Worse, there wasn't any entertainment today. No good jokes, no fighting, no Icy Vs. Pokan brawls. Nothing. Oh yeah 6 people got sent out at begining of class *lol* that was funny. and Mitch showed me the Monty Python song " I Like Chinese." LOL frickin hilarious.  Eventually we went to auditorium to meet this kid Kristopher who's travelling across Canada to raise money for organ and tissue donation. I thought it was a good cause. I really wish the kid good luck. He's damn courageous for a 14 year old. Least I think he was 14. Point is he's courageous for a kid period. There.  Now time for after school. Dan came over to my house cuz we were gonna go to UCC to break around 6. We sat around shoving food in our faces for a good 2 hours. Half a pizza each, 2 packs of Gung Jai Mein, a bag of carrots, Mcdonalds burger.....washed it down with some wine and stuff.....mmmmm food. Then Dan sat on MSN for a bit and I played underground. I FINALLY MADE IT PAST 65/111! I'm now at 70 =P. BIG IMPROVEMENT. I have FOB spoilers now. You know the HUGE ASS ONES that make F1 spoilers look like scraps of aluminum foil? Well I ended up getting a smaller one because Subaru Impreza's don't look good with FOB spoilers. Then again what does? We would then end up playing DDR for a bit....with controllers. WHoo hoo. Did a wee bit of breaking at home. Then off to UCC.  Saw anton and em already starting to break. Sergei and some other people were there also. Tonight I pulled off two windmills again. I think that's my peak for now. I also pulled off a decent airchair and Pikes, as you can see on my MSN display pic. That is right now my glory for tonight. Weee. Well I left early today around 9. Still had to do some stuff @ home and I was REALLY tired. I think that Grain products though like noodles and pizza....well the crust anyways if not the rest of the fat are very good meals to have before breaking. Really gives you energy. Anyways I'm out. Gonna snowboard  tomorrow and I don't wanna fall asleep on my way down the bunny hill. Cya.

       1/15/04   Slow start...big finish   Though my  day started off slow like usual....I mean every day two really sucks, it was ended off with a really good ending. Talent show was tonight.....and the last performance w/ Dave Rutt's (one of the Stage Band X conductors) band. THEY WERE AMAZING! Wasn't exactly rock, or ska, but it was like Spanishy music. The drumming was sick, and Dave's blaring on the trombone was really good. Tonight's talent show was much better than last years. Less crap....more good stuff. But I thought the last band really beat out Joe Ogan's band from last year. Well anyways now time to go on with the rest of my day...  Like usual I woke up around 720....crawling slowly out of bed met by a average breakfast....for me anyways. I had tofu and rice *lol* which I bet most people don't think is too typical. Tea is typical right? Well Patrick came over for a lift around 7:50...we left around 7:55....just made it ontime to school around 8:10.  Music class was REALLY boring today....least my trombone case has been taken to the shop to be fixed. All we did today though was scales....repeat of grade 1 theory.....I slept through some of it......and we did some really pathetic playing at the end...and off to science. Like I said music was VERY boring today. Mr. McCumber isn't the greatest teacher compared to Mrs. Wharton. She at least knows how to keep a class happy by serving Oh Henry bars every once in a while.  Well off to science. Note taking like usual. Nothing too exciting happened. No one was late so no singing. We got tips on what to study. Oh yeah Alan reminded me of careers class yesterday where we were talking bout G-Unit...then he said something about rice and then he somehow came up with "RICE UNIT" instead of G-UNIT. Then out of random I sorta said "TEAM ALLAH." Catchy eh???? Yah I know....it's too good to be true. No rap group could ever have the name "TEAM ALLAH." They ain't good enough for it. NO RAP GROUP IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR IT....Yet...  LUNCH! Well since Nathan had midterms he didn't go out....Mike and Hermann were pussies and wouldn't go out into the cold. So only me and Thompson went to McD's today. Cheeseburger special. Mmmm.....processed cheese......Hot Chocolate..........EEEEW! McD's hot chocolates are no good....but best substitute to English Toffee Cappuchino. Oh yeah out of random my English group partner Christine comes and tells me the news that she didn't do jack shit for our project. Wow. What a great thing to hear only 3 hours before 5th period. Well I didn't care. English isn't my strong subject....and my group really is "productive." Told Finlan to get a picture of Mao Tse- Tung and he gets a picture of a Chinese warlord who looks like he's only 10. Idiot.  Well now time for Bio. Ugh had to write the fastest ever of my life. I started from making detailed drawings and full sentence answers to chicken scratches and broken english. Ugh Ms. Wiener can't figure out how long it takes an average grade 10 to do an in class lab. Ugh well anyways didn't finish but who cares still handed it in....and off to english. Bio is starting to get REALLY boring. Well off to English class and see how our presentation goes.  Well we started ok...until Finlan didn't understand how the Chinese revolution worked. But oh well that was ok I don't think anyone caught onto it anyways. But SERIOUSLY my group really sucked. In the end I had to summarize the revolution because I "knew" the most about it. I really just improvised. Said the obvious. Hoped it went well. Our info pile was 3x bigger than anyone else's too. Well that was basically it....after that bused home and decided to go to talent show or not........self explanitory from the first paragraph I ended up going.  Well when I got home I moped around for a bit....ate food.....talked on MSN......went onto urbandictionary.com and looked for stupid words meanings. I liked this definition the most:  Thx:      Bastardization of 'Thnx,' which is a bastardization of 'Thanx,' which is a bastardization of 'Thanks,' which is a bastardization of 'Thank You.'       : I killed your rabbit!      : thx      : np  That really is a good definition. Whatever happened to writing Thanks or Thank You? I really agree with this definition. This site is much more useful than dictionary.com.......in ways. Well after that I left for talent show around 6ish....met steve @ market tower around 630 and we walked to school. Just got there in time.....saw Mike n' Dan. Dan ended up sitting w/ us while Mike sat with his school friends. Mike said they ruined the show for him. But meh. He kinda deserves it i guess =P. Well talent show was friggin amazing this year as mentioned. First act's memorable acts were Oriol's Band *where I realized that Gavin can play the guitar better than Rory.....all Rory played were a crapload of powerchords* and also Courtney Rosso's dance gig. It was riverdance sorta.....but still beats any toprock I've seen in breaking. It was like 8 mins of hardcore toprock....I can barely toprock at a slow song for like 1 minute. Usually I toprock for 10 secs than go into 6-step lol. Can't really remember anyting else from act 1....oh yeah two associate level piano players that were sisters played a duet. Really good. OH YEAH almost forgot Rasberry Social or sometin like that. Hilarious band.  During intermission we walked around for a bit. We being me, Steve, Dan and for a bit Brian Link was with us too. In the end when we headed up we found out the hallways were empty so........I PRACTICED WINDMILLS! And LO AND BEHOLD I, JOE CHAN.....LINKED TWO! Then on the 3rd I landed on my hip but WHO CARES?! IT'S A BRUISE! IT'LL HEAL UNLESS I HAV INTERNAL BLEEDING! Point is I LINKED TWO MILLS! Funny and when I was walking to school I was saying how I should work on mills. Motivation for myself =P. Of course Steve has been telling me to practice mills since 6 months ago but I never thought I could until now. THERE IS HOPE. Well after that Steve pulled two flares....and then Dan and me pulled an airchair or two. Now back to the talent show......  Act two highlights were the improv by Matt Brown and some other dude....hilarious. And then there was Igor and Stefan's breaking part of the show. That brought lots of whoa's and screams. And then the final act with Dave Rutt and this crazy drummer that Thompson told me was Mark. THEY WERE GOOD. Schooled Oriol's band. Great ending to a good talent show. Now after the show I bused home with Steve. Well walked to the bus stop with him. Then I got off @ Beckers and mom drove me home.  Well now I'm at home doing finishing touches to Careers. Kinda rushed through the end but meh. Gotta finish a few things then sleep. Later reader.

       1/14/04   Tired....starving....and relieved from math midterm   Today was another day of stupid band. Woke up @ 6am and ate....and that would be the only thing I'd eat until i got home. Ugh boring as usual. Played some songs...got lectured....then off to first period.....HISTORY *ugh.*  Well in Ms. Manson's history class it was same old. She'd put up her cheesy overheads, and then do a useless task of finding jot notes when she gave us the answers at the end anyways. Geez so stupid. We also got our untouchables reviews back. I got 18.5/20...somehow Scott got 19.5/20 though we had the exact same report almost....except he plaguerized some number figures. But STILL.......so stupid. Meh not that I can complain my mark is still VERY high. Well after a stupid talk about how stock markets work......which isn't that exciting when you've been investing in it since grade 7.....it was off to Careers.  BORING. Saw some presentations. Monica and some other girls presented today. So boring, no offense Monica if you're reading this but no matter who was presenting....it was boring. Well we watched more of Finding Forrester. Sean Connery gets lost @ a Knicks game lol. And Lunch.  I notice im whizzing  by my school day cuz today was damn boring. Studied for midterms @ lunch.  Math. Probably failed midterms.  Programming. Same old. Using stupid Hyperstudio. Icy killing Po-Kan. Hermann overlooking the raging battle between the helpless Po-Kan clinging onto dear life and Icy's merciless attitude towards him. And like usual the rest of the class would add to the excitment with "OOOH's" and "WHOA's" whenever Po-Kan was getting his ass kicked. Icy threatened him with a chair. That was pretty funny to see. Who woulda thought that in a computer lab there would be melee weapons? Not exactly an axe, chainsaw, or a @&#*$!% Tuba (quote taken from video clip Quake in real life...watch it at www.ghettofob.net) but I think Icy kinda wronged them with their saying that in real life not everyone carries around a melee weapon. Apparently Icy finds a plastic school chair a pretty formidable melee weapon. And of course I checked hockey pool while in class....still in 5th place. And still Hyperstudio is just as exciting as watching dried paint dry. And then the bell rang...  FINALLY OUT OF FRICKIN SCHOOL....only to meet FREEZING COLD WINDS. Now normally I don't complain about my ears freezing....but they actually started hurting today. No frostbite yet....but I think I'm asking for it =P. Cap hats can only help you so far. Least my head wasn't cold. Bused home....talked to Ryan and Patrick on the way home.....by the time I got home I decided to just hide in bed because it was actually Warm....a feeling that I had forgotten ever since 2:30 when I left school. Afterwards....I sat around for a bit....played the piano......SC....then  ps2. First time playing NFSU since.....before Christmas Holidays. still hasn't lost its fun. Forgot how to do a few things though. Got worse @ dragging and better @ drifting. Makes sense. I can't drive straight because I turn too much...something a drifting driver needs...probably.  Well by now it's around 8....and I had to go to theory. Only 3 people in the class tonight. Me, Thomas, and Lauren. Wasn't too exciting......basically we just learned more stuff to help us pass when the exam comes in May.....we all left by 9.  Now I'm at home sitting here......typing up English presentation......printing off science notes......found out Jason bought NFL street.....and writing this blog. Oh yeah and with the constant pictures of Sim City 4 Paul keeps sending me....I REALLY regret buying a ps2 now. Shoulda bought a new P4 Comp and sc4. Oh well that'll come in time hopefully. I'm gonna go now and maybe play some PS2.....or sleep. Productive.

       1/13/04   You walk around...then BOOM! EXAMS!!! NOO!   And so the countdown begins.....   LATE START DAY WAS TODAY! yes sleeping in till 830 *shweet.* And on with the rest of my shpiel for today.....  Yes I realize my titles are very VERY cheesy. But it's true. Only another 16 hours or so before my math midterms come up. It's basically an exam...but when the teacher gives u a review sheet with 21 questions....it's worth sometin. I just hope I don't flunk it. Math is my lowest mark right now. Last year it was too I think. That or science.  But today I really got prepared for midterms....me mike n' dan studied from 3-6 @ library. By the time I got out it was 6pm. Today has been one hell of an exhausting day....in ways.  Woke up around 8:30 today.......props to whoever came up with "Late Start Day." So good. Don't have to crawl outta bed @ 7 or anything. I actually didnd't fall asleep in bio for once!! AMAZING! Oh yeah neither in english. Woke up, got dressed, Patrick (Patrick will be Sackville not Finlan) and we left for school around 8:50  Traffic was jammed. Whole Oxford was clogged with metal chassis' w/ CO coming out of the end. Took us almost 30 mins to get to school. Lucky I had music, and Mr. mcCumber doesn't care about punctuality anyways. But Ms. Manson seems to bitch a lot on Day 1's when I have her for homeroom. But we eventually got there on time. Whoopteedoo we get our sight reading songs for exam. Heh lucky we've had 3 sub teachers. One of the songs we know how to play w/ our eyes closed cuz we had an earlier teset with it. We almost didn't get it because some retard *cough NIKKI* almost blew it by telling the teacher we should have another piece. SERIOUSLY U GET LIKE A FREE 100% ON SOMETIN IN THE TEST! Wonder what she was thinkin....  Well after music class It was time for science.....wrote notes.....that was it. Oh yeah....Justin D. Underhill and Sylviane came in late...so they had to sing a song....namely the school song. Well like usual Sylviane and Underhill just read it but Justin actually SANG. IT was a scary thought......and even Mr. Curphey was surprised. Said he enjoyed it too much.....I mean singing is supposed to be a "punishment." Well that was basically it cuz I'm not about to type ot the details of note taking.  Lunch....Me, Thompson, Hermann and Nate went to McD's. I had a English Toffee Cap. First time....it's pretty good. Beats French Vanilla. Then when we were eating Thompson somehow brought up the idea of Why Asians are considered Yellow when we really don't even have any yellow? Po-Kan and Derek Cason sitting beside us even heard us. Yeah we all started laughing. I really don't get how the hell Thompson comes up with all this stuff in his head. This is almost as stupid as the "Joe.....You my #1 Rice nigga."   Just got to school in time for bio. Whoo hoo another quiz. Not. Well least these are easy. Ez things to bring up my mark. Rite now I think I'm sitting at a healthy 85%. Can't complain. better from 80. For some reason I'm getting better at science. Maybe I'll ditch my Finance Business Job plans and head for a job in bio engineering....or something. Can't be much worse. I'll be like those people visited by Crackers the Crime Fighting Chicken from Michael Moore's "The Awful Truth." Good series. The one on Bowling for Columbine DVD is hilarious. Well we did a quiz......got some old work back. That was basically it. Oh yeah I'm with Okanski Underhill and Robert for a project that won't be coming up until later in the year.  English was boring like usual. Presentations started for revolutions.  Well after school, I had to go the the library w/ Dan N' Mike for a studying thing for math. We worked and talked, and ate, and stuff  for almost 3 hours. Saw a lot of people there actually. Jeff was there, Jesse, Wilson, Erin, Brescia, these two people in grade 9 that apparently knew Paul Nielsen. One I found out was the girl that knew karate that was good friends with Laura. The other one supposedly Me and Paul played basketball with one time back in like grade 5 or something. Wow what a small world. This is almost as weird as Marcello knowing my cousin. This world just gets smaller and smaller. Maybe its cuz London has less than 500k people. But yeah we studied until bout 6....well that was until I left. I dunno when they did..  By the time I got home it was about 6:30. Took a shower n stuff......then played the drums for around 30 minutes. Then.......MORE MATH STUDYING. I mite be taking this midterm a bit too seriously.......but I seriously can't remember half the shit we did through this year. Well I still got lunch tomorrow....and I can kinda study during careers I guess. Hopefully I don't screw up tomorrow.  Well now I'm still studying......stupid factoring. It's the worst. I hate these parabolas n stuff. Why can't the world just revolve around y=mx+b? Life would be way easier. Well I'm gonna head to sleep soon....still have Band tomorrow....and i don't wanna fall asleep halfway through my midterms. I know this entry's kinda bland.......I mean the most action packed thing was Thompson raising the question of why Asians are considered to be yellow. I don't know either. Well the library actually lots of stuff happened. Lots of jokes. Talks about old days in Montessori....and for some reason Mike kept saying someone was slapping his ass. Dunno what the hell Burger King put in his burger. Also talked to Jeff about some church things. But yeah that was pretty much my day I guess. I am now going to hope from now until I'm done my math midterms that it goes well. PLEASE.........

       1/12/04   On your mark...get set.... START WRITING TILL UR HAND GOES BOKAN!   Yes.....that's basically Ms. Manson's version of a test. Holy crap today's history test was brutal......writing wise. It was actually a joke test. Just the fact though I had to write another stupid Essay about "Prohibition affects on Canada." Seriously WTH!? Who gives a crap. I wrote a nice piece though I think. I wrote about how Prohibition created a new job field....Bootlegging. You wouldn't believe how many Canadians made big bucks from making homemade beer. Reminds me of the Simpsons. 1920's actually was a pretty cool era....sorta. I mean....we had a good economy.....and we had lots of jobs. Then again I'd rather live in this era cuz back then I really can't picture traveling at 40km/h in a Model T Ford. Anyways enough of history class....today's class was just a stupid test. Onto Careers.....  Watched Finding Forrester. At firs this movie looked REALLY stupid, but now I sorta wanna see the ending. Though it's a drama, it's a good one. i was surprised at the talent the director had in putting together this movie. Was about basketball, and writing books. I didn't know how that really related up till now.....but I think you people should get this movie....really good one. Oh yeah we had a Ms. Dymock for sub. Nothing exciting....mmm.........lunchtime......  For lunch.....well me Nate n' Thompson went out for subs originally. We did wait for Hermann but he never came so we left. We got to the subs place and Lo and Behold.....ITS SITLL CLOSED! DAMNIT! Stupid Broken English False advertising....January 12th they would reopen my ass. Well we ended up going to Burger King. Getting so tired of fast food. I'm basically paying for cancer. Least it keeps me going through the rest of the day. Yah lunch was usual......talked bout random crap, Thompson still used the N word a lot....and Nathan still ranting on about the "Got a Dog? Not anymore" joke. That's getting kinda old. Then again Thompson's "You my #1 Rice Nigga" is gettin old too. Then I said sometin about how by 2010 every white dude will be outnumbered by Asians 3:1. Got some laughs from that. Then again...don't we outnumber them already =P. K maybe not but EVENTUALLY...............you just wait.  Well Math we just reviewed. Midterms in a matter of two days. I found out I really did forget lots of shit....but it came back to me slowly. I'll be crammin lots tomorrow. Mike became the class tool when he photocopied answer sheet for everyone. Kinda funny. Started off with him going by himself to photocopy his own copy, the Mr. G told him to photocopy him one....then Bennett, then me, then Maggie....Travis....and so on and so forth till he probably had 5 bux in his hand for photocopying.   Programming class we had a test.....meh.  Ok see that part of the day was pure crap....you can see why I fall asleep through those two classes. Well sometimes in programming there's something exciting. Ok I'm just lying... maybe the reason why I'm writing little today is because I forget most of the stuff.  Well it's monday so I had Stage band X practice.....we didn't really play today. A new girl joined. Thinks she's Lauren. Wonder if it's the same one that used to come to my theory class? Well she's a drummer....now we have a grand total of two...Jake is kinda on the crap side of drumming. Me and Nick can play better than him. Oh yah and Shaunvir. I mean Jake SHOULD be cut if we cut people. We got pizza....for our "talent" at our other performances. I'm not complaining since its food.....mmm....pizza....  When I was leavin for home I saw Mike n' Dan, so we walked to the stop. Chatted for a bit before I realized my bus was making the turn....Ran. Still can't beat the half a kilometer sprint I had to make last year down Dundas to catch my bus. THAT was brutal. Got home around hmm..........Was so freaking tired. But meh still played a game of SC w/ Jason and drummed for over and hour. then I had to do piano n stuff.  Right now.....I think I gotta organize better. I wanna learn how to do graphics design, HTML and still have exams to study for. Better do exams first. I'll stick w/ my crappy graffiti Display pic for now=P. Well I'm out...gonna fiddle around with site more maybe. Later.

       1/11/04   The darkness SLOWLY takes over....Grr stupid exams   Wow. Tomorrow marks the first day of in class exams week. Am I ready? Helllll no. I didn't know about history test until today. But oh well no worries.....with the mark I have I dont have to worry about anything. But also I have to do review for my math midterms....thats the biggie. Have to remember everything since september by today. I wish I had an actual exam now....would have more time to study. Now I have my midterms on wednesday.....which really really sucks. But anyways here's the summary on the rest of my day.  Well like usual I went to church. Woke up at around 830 or so.....left house @ 845. Picked up Jason....got to church around 9:15. We were a tad late....they started just before we slipped in. Today's message was pretty interesting though. We had a guest speaker.....uh oh forgot his name....but the subject was about "Our Commision." Basically to me the message told me basically about how God's calling can really be emphasized towards you. He told us of the story of how him and his wife were called to China when someone from one of the booths (he was at a missionary open house sorta thing) and told them they needed a computer person and a nurse. Well he as a programmer....and his wife was a nurse....coincedence? Well he believed that this was a sign from God. I guess if you were in that spot you'd think that too. Also he had a very interesting story about faith. He asked a group of non-believers whether or not they believed in aliens...and they said yes, despite the fact they have never seen one, or even heard of someone seeing one.  Then he asked them why wouldn't they believe in Jesus Christ even though there is evidence of him living. They couldn't really reply to that. Well eventually that village he is preaching in (btw a village in China is around 700,000) now has 4 churches....which is good growth. Really feel proud for em. Oh yeah, and after English Service....Pastor Mackness gave Jason a brand spankin' new Bible. I thought it was a pretty cool gesture. In fact I think we should make it almost like a church tradition...giving new believers Bibles. Speaking of Bibles, I need mine back from Shaonan. Too bad he never really accepted Christ. He seemed like the mature type. I learned a lot from this though. Mature people don't always accept things more maturely. Spirituality especially, is VERY difficult thing to interpret. It's like a white guy reading Chinese.  Then came Sunday School class. Learned about Job. One thing that really still sticks in my mind is the quote that Pastor Mackness said about how "Spiritual life can interfere with physical life, but physical life can't interfere with Spiritual life." I kinda came up with a metaphor with the fact of how a small foot can fit in a big shoe, but not the other way around. No one got it....I looked like an idiot. Nothing new =P. Today was communion to though.....so we all went upstairs for the last part of service where the communion happens. Josh and Calvin then went downstairs to set up stuff...while the rest of us stayed for Benediction and some special deacon/elder announcement. When we got downstairs, we lined up for lunch. Gavin complimented Carmen on her new outfit....he said it made her look like she was bout to run a marathon or sometin. I just said I wonder if she even knew what the word "Rookie" meant that was written across her jacket =P. Lol that got some laughter. Well we left around 2 and got home around 2:30, dropping off Jason on the way and also picking up Bad Boys 2 and Tony Hawk's Underground from Rogers. heard the game sux....but i've seen the movie....rented it just for laughs again. BEST MOVIE I've seen probably.  Well I sat around home for a bit....did some things....played a bit of SC....but mainly got tired of it. OK I LOST IN IT THATS WHY! But main point is....I ordered pizza and went over to Patrick (Sackville not FInlan)'s house for a bit. Watched Bad Boys II and came home around now. It's about 945 now. Chatting on MSN and studying for History....dats why I kinda have to go and am now summarizing. Laters.

       1/10/04   YES WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!   YES! WEEKEND! Today I think I defined laziness. Well at least in my point of view. I woke up at 12 (Wow I haven't done that in a week) and then headed out for piano @ 1230. Wow......I totally forgot everything.....C Major seemed like a challenge. I also apparently made my piano teacher panic cuz she seems to think someone in grade 8 piano should practice 575 minutes a day? WTH!?!?!?!?!? SERIOUSLY the most i'll practice is 40 minutes a day. PERIOD. I sound good enough....the marks say so. 80+ from 40 mins of practice 4 days a week.....dats good enough. I'm not bout to become the next Mozart. After a gruesome 30 minutes.....I finally get home around 1pm or so.  I decided I wasn't going to go to Boler today. Well one reason was because I have HYPE tonight *fellowship* and another reason is because my board is in terrible condition. Need to wax it bad. Actually I just need a new board period. The liquid board Marcello's selling is tempting.....but then again I hate liquid  boards. I wanna get a Ryde or Sims board. I was thinkin Santa Cruz @ one point.....but man what was I thinkin now that i look back. Oh yah K-2 I wouldn't mind either. But yeah didn't end up going to boler or Webstation today because Colin n em already left....so in the end I ended up going to Masonville w/ age.  Went down to future shop......lucky we caught the wonderland bus. Took us right there ^_^. We were there for bout two hours. Saw Paul there....haven't seen that kid in a while. He's actually a lot taller than me now. I was surprised. Him and Adrian both got Sim City 4.....how I envy P4 comps now.....Grr stupid P3 Emachine.....4MB Vid card.....and tin cans for speakers. Wow my comp truly define the term "Scrap Metal."  Well anyways me and Age ended up browsing around for almost an hour and thirty minutes. I ended up getting a PS/2 Remote and a 7 foot long extension cable for my ps2 controller. YES!!!! FINALLY!!!! I can turn on the ps2, tv, sound, and play all from my couch......HEEHEE NO MORE WALKING UP TO THE STUPID MACHINE! This is why I think I'm getting lazier and lazier. Paying 40 bux for the two objects just so I don't have to ever walk up to the system (except for changing the CD but still.....I'll get a broom eventually) and I can play from the comfort of my couch. No more stupid sitting on the stupid floor. I haven't actually tried it out yet.....but I can picture the luxury now...................Couch..............Potato.............mmmmmmmm potato. Well we ended up leaving around 5. And this is now where I have dinner.  Whadya know? JU PAH *porkchop * AGAIN.....FOR THE 4th NIGHT IN A ROW!!! My mom seriously can't figure out what "variety" is. We've been having Jupah for the past 4 nights and I'm really getting sick and tired of it. First of all she doesn't reallize corn starch makes the meat more juicy and tender, and also SHE DOESN'T CHANGE HER FREAKING RECIPE! Oregano, Chives, and some other crap. And if your wondering if I'm a cook nut or sometin.....yes I am.  BUT SERIOUSLY wouldn't anyone get tired of having the same thing 4 nights in a row? Well least I also had chicken....and of course some......uh.......Choi Sum.....dunno what it is in english. Put it this way it looks like a celery....but softer........and its leafy. Defined? Maybe not....Probably not.... But that's ok. Point is it's good.  Left for HYPE around 6:00. Had to pickup Jason too....apparently his parents didnt know about this so he couldn't have dinner. Well we got there around 630. Interesting how Gavin brought a friend. His name was Liam. Surprisingly he actually was pretty open minded about Spirituality. Well first we started off with an icebreaker game.....we had to say a verb or adjective and an animal and then our name. It all had to start w/ the first letter of our name. For example.....my name is Joe. I could be "Jumping Jaguar Joe." Josh was "Jolly Jellyfish Josh." And Liam for example of a different letter was "Lazy Leemer Liam." Heh I somehow convinced someone that I was a Jumping Jangaroo.....what's a Jangaroo? What's a Jalopy? A car on homestarrunner.com. But Jangaroo? It's a kangaroo.....that starts with a J. Today wasn't the biggest meeting....was missing Carmen, and the twins Mike n' Dan. But we still went on....talked about issues that were mentioned in the 4 page long email Josh and I wrote. Me, Gavin, and Liam were w/ JT...we somehow talked about it longer than anyone else. Had some pretty good points though.....and I was surprised with what Liam had to say....he's one down to earth dude. And he really knows his stuff. We actually had a pretty good convo. He didn't seem out of it at all. He was actually like in depth with most of the conversation with us which I was surprised. We obviously had some laughs n stuff but it was all pretty mellow. We had other jokes too but can't recall them. But I heard about this one place "Youth For Christ" or sometin. They sound pretty twisted though. Liam said he went to the place a few times....and it seems like they mesmerize you to become a Christian. Now no matter how good of a scheme it sounds......it defeats the purpose of religion I find. I mean religion can't be forced which Liam pointed out...as well as Gavin.....and it is a very personal thing. I actually learned a lot from him. Pretty cool atheist. But honestly I thought he has spiritual potential.....but then again I wouldn't like force him to go to church or anything. If one day he really decides though that would be pretty cool. Was kinda interesting how he was thinkin bout being Buddhist....seems like white buddhists are on the rise. I mean Mr. Kimmel @ our school is one....and Richard Gere is too.....I think. But yah tonight's meeting actually was pretty cool.  By the time I got home....which is about now.....I'm pretty tired. Decided that tomorrow I'd probably stay home from going to Michael's on the Thames w/ my parents. Wedding Anniversary. I think i'll just rent a few movies maybe have a friend over or sometin and just chill. Oh yeah today Patrick's (Not Finlan the other one, Sackville) modem broke down.....well didn't work....he finally decided to call the Bell guy. Yes I'm not a professional with modems maybe but I know who to call at least....THE MODEM DUDE! er 310-SURF. Well I'm out....gonna go watch SNL maybe. laters.

       1/9/04   Week 1 of school over....totally burned out   FINALLY! FRIDAY! This week seemed so freaking long.....and it's so hard to believe that it was only the first week back in school from the Christmas holidays. But today wasn't too bad. Had some excitement if not a lot. Well here's the summary of my day:  Like usual I wake up, do all the wake up crap, and head to school. Whoopee, first period was music and we get to do theory. Really sucked but still point is it was an assembly day, meaning that my classes are shortened. We had student forum assembly day to day....you know like we get to put out our opinions and stuff and they school will sometimes take into consideration if they think it has potential. Capitalist? Yes....effective? Maybe. Makes student body happier? Most likely. Waste of time? Sorta...but some issues really do bring up questions. I forgot them obviously cuz I like to listen to the funny ones but there was one about like the gym floor....and how we have been raising money for a wooden one since last september. Well some "shmuckette" decided to complain about it cuz she isn't "athletic." Funny though. When other people make donations to the school, it always goes to music program, I mean we are one of the best schools in London. Anyways enough sidetracking. Some other dude decided to suggest for MOGA this year (Most Outrageous Group Activity) we should try to set a record by making the world's biggest human parabola (mathematical thing u know, looks like a bell....OOOOH NOW U SEE) to replace our hopeless and pathetic record attempt last year for the most people to wear those glasses w/ plastic noses @ once. Seriously what the heck kinda record setting is that? So cheesy. But I think it got rejected. Oh yeah, I had science before the forum.....stupid....we watched a video about weather...seriously does the Ontario gov't really think we don't know what rain is and how it forms? When its above zero, it "Rains." Below zero, it "snows." Seriously the gov't should maybe spend this $$$ on the army instead of us. Maybe they'll have the $$$ to afford a weather predicting machine....that'll benefit them more than this  benefits us.  Well after all that stuff it was lunch. I wasn't really hungry today, so I decided to play some ball. What luck. The day I wanna play ball Mr. Douglas boots us all out of the gym. Then for some reason he starts to play Patrick Finlan in a game of ball. LOL that was the climax of my school day, just watching Finlan being plowed by Mr. D's post made all the Gr. 10's watching laugh our heads off. Funny how Finlan was being humiliated infront of almost 40 Gr. 10's. And he seems to think Mr.D was trying his hardest.....when Finlan takes a shot and Mr. Douglas decides to stand 7 feet from him. Trying? Sure thing. *NOT.* SERIOUSLY if Finlan tried his hardest and Mr. D did, Finlan's FG% would be something like.........-0.5%? Fine I'll give him some credit. 1%. Oh that one percent woulda came from when Mr. D let Finlan shoot for the 200th time.....THEN Finlan would make the shot. But yah pretty funny....in the end he only lost 11-7...but then again Mr. D wasn't even playing defense, and Finlan was struggling to keep up with the gym teacher since Patrick is a gimpy.  Oh yah almost forgot. When we got kicked out....well me and some people decided to just talk for the rest of lunch in front of the gym doors. This was when we found out Finlan was starting to play ball w/ Mr. D. Forgot what exactly we talked about.....for some reason Lindsay had a urge to go into the guy's washroom. Seriously what's so intriguing about a urinal and a jawn? Oh well after that "excitement" we just chatted around for a bit, and that was when we then decided to watch Gimpy be tooled by Mr. D.  After lunch it was Bio, then English. Nothing much, so I won't touch on it too much. Just I had work.  Well now skip down to after school. Chatted w/ Ryan on the bus ride home, then got home around........3:15ish. One big topic we talked about was the game where Gimpy got tooled.  Well got home, drummed around for a bit.....I really can't do jack when im freezing cold. Drumming seemed like a challenge.... and those 5A stick's seemed to weigh a ton. Well after that I decided to tweak around on photoshop for a bit.....wow you know you're bored when huh? Well I actually dunno why but lately I've started to like to fiddle around with computer drawing programs. I took a shot @ graffiti-ing w/ photoshop. Looked kinda weird, I can draw decent C's, but my L's, A's, and R's are TERRIBLE. While doing that I was talking on MSN, chatting w/ Maisie about speech impediments...dunno how I got onto that topic....and sent out my mediocre attempt at graffiti-ing to some of my friends.  "Mmm...interesting" Said maisie.... and Jason said "What the Hell? I have Photoshop?" Yes....my screenshot was taken in photoshop, and somehow I fooled Jason into thinking that he owned photoshop. Smart kid huh =P. Well after that I played some SC (starcraft if you haven't caught on from my previous entries) and then ate and left for UCC. Friday....haven't done any breaking in over 3 weeks. But just before I left, I got a call from Wendy. Apparently tomorrow we have a HYPE meeting. Short notice...and this sorta ruins my Snowboarding ambition for tomorrow. Was gonna meet up @ Boler w/ Marcello n' Scott but guess not now. Guess I have to wait till next week. Well I guess in a way it was for the best. I don't have my contacts yet anyways....and I can barely see like 5 feet in front of me....in detail. Well now I guess i'll be headed to LCAC for HYPE. Now I'm leaving for UCC.  Well I got there around 6:50 ish. Saw some UWO people and then Steve, Sergei, Mike, and Evan. Today I just decided to work on crickets (really needed em back) and turbles (need those too). Somehow accidentally I pulled off 3 or 4 hops of dark hammers.....so now I know I do have the ability to do them. Steve said my airchairs getting better. Personally I really wanna be able to grab my toes when im doing airchair. Right now im still like i dunno 10 inches away from doing it. Dan, Mike, Anton, and Jonny came to around 7:15ish. I was surprised that Dan could almost hold airchair now. Not bad for only 4 months. Anton felt sick so he just slept. Mike is slowly still attempting turtles.....he is gettin better and Jonny.....well he can handstand which I was surprised. Before Christmas he could barely hold himself up with his hands. Pulled off one decent elbow freeze in a battle...and tried a mediocre attempt at crickets. Honestly having a battle near the end of session isn't the best time for me....by now I'm like dead tired. But yah I ended up leaving at around 9:30 or so....supposed to meet dad @ Alumni @ 9:15 for a ride so you can see I was already late.  Well now....it's around 10:30 and I'm home. Finished careers project. I'll just add some finishing touches on it sometime. But for now I'm fine. Got presentation on OpenOffice.org finished, and all I need are pics now. Wow CGA pics. I can maybe like get a computer....or a desk from Staples. WAH! SO EXCITING! And I guess I'll be attempting graffiti again w/ Adobe Photoshop. Lates. *Post post....shoam.*

       1/8/04   E-z goin day... I deserve one after this week =P   WOW.....for once I had a relaxing day. Well w/ exams coming up and stuff, I guess it isn't really exactly relaxing. I'm right now pretty stressed w/ the math mid terms comin up next wednesday. I am kinda thankful that I was only one of four people yesterday that put their hands up to have bio test next week......I would be totally burned out. But yah, now I have a math midterms comin up......plus I gotta do my careers project. So much crap....so little time. Well today wasn't too bad though.....History was same old....BORING, same as careers.....School seems to have plummeted since Grade 9....last year was somewhat exciting sometimes with Mr. Rice as a geo teacher. Guess having a geo teacher that once worked @ Yuk Yuk's really pays off.  When I got home today.....Ugh shoveling the stupid snow. Well that kileld bout 30 mins, then came in and ate some stuff. Mmmmmm..........peanut butter sandwhich.............dunno why but I've got hooked on that stuff lately. Well yah after that I kinda napped for a bit.....got really bored.  Honestly, school days suck for a Gr. 10 There's almost nothing to do....with homework n stuff in your way. I'm lucky my piano lessons don't actually start till this Saturday....oh crap which reminds me I can't go snowboarding till after 1pm. Ugh.  Well afterwards I surfed net a bit, played some online gaming, then watched the pathetic leafs game against the Sens. First, Sundin didn't play that could've been a factor to their gruesome 7-1 loss, or maybe cuz Kidd is the crappiest goalie since Cujo. Both ways, while the Leafs were struggling, I was sitting on the couch laughing at their crappy game. Who cares if they were in 1st. Anaheim was in 8th last year for the playoffs and they made Detroit look like the Penguins.  Hmm.........well I did get a 256 meg card for my D-Cam. Shweet.........now i can actually take more than 10 photos=P. What a feat for a camera.... well my camera at least. Well this could be a motivation....dunno why but lately I've come to take an interest in imaging w/ Adobe. Actually I started this frenzy during August but I didn't know how to use the program. Then bout two days ago I decided to figure out a few things, and the images didn't turn out that bad. Tommy and Josh said they are decent. Hopefully I can maybe make a web layout sometime soon or sometin. But yeah, don't know why but for some reason imaging has been kinda amusing these last few days. Beats doing math homework or somethin. And now for once I'm gonna go try to sleep earlier than usual. So g'nite....and I'll blog more tomorrow. Whoo hoo.......Friday! That means last day of school for the week......and also I can try to get my crickets back for breaking. Maybe I can also practice mills...er attempt to do more than one......connected.

       1/7/04   7 days of blogging. Oh yeah, Hell's been freezin over for a while   Well......it's been a week of  blogging......and I still haven't missed a day of blogging yet. Wow do I feel proud right now.....I've actually stay commited to something =P. Well today was day 3 now of REALLY cold days. Apparently these 3 days in London have all been around -25 with windchill. COLD. But yah n e who.....today actually wasn't that bad though.....school wise n stuff......some interesting stuff happened.  Well one thing was it was wednesday, which means my day lasts from 6am (gr 10 band) until 9pm (Theory class). Well yah today I got to band......dead tired.....first time in 4 weeks we've had to do that....how I miss the wednesdays where I woke up @ 1......and did usual crap....ate, dressed, u know......and rushed to school. Wow. Only about 3/4 of band was there. band was actually not that long today.....usual crap....new songs......mr. clark bitching about the smallest mistake. "YOU MADE THE DOWNBEAT HALF A MILISECOND EARLY." That kinda crap.  Well after that grueling hour, it was time for.........MUSIC. oh how I hate day 2's. Wednesday day 2's I spend over 2 hours straight in stupid music room........grr.........sucks. We had our usual stuff.....technical stuff....then some theory......then annoucements. For some reason music goes by pretty slow now....with da new sub Mr. McCumbern or sometin. We've already had over 4 sub teachers this year. He used to teach at Banting or sometin......but anyways he's a pretty crappy teacher. N e who, announcements came on....blah blah.....then off to science.  HOLY CRAP WAS IT BORING! We watched a "quiz movie." I dunno wat the heck the teacher's federation thinks of or whatever da hell made the movie. You watch some A.D.D. retard for almost 40 minutes talking about clouds.....then 10 quiz questions come up.......what da hell ever happened to the teacher actually standing up there and teaching? Slackers.....they seem to find newer and newer ways to slack off. One of these days they're prolly gonna pay a student to do the teaching, or something. Maybe they'll dump school in the future. Wouldn't that be nice? A whole generation of illiterate children. WHOO HOO!=P  Lunch was to cold to go out........seriously I mite sometimes think cold isn't cold......but minus twenty-five is damn cold. I had to stay in n e ways though.......had a bio quiz next period. Was thinkin bout playing ball but half da gym was taken. And the ball half only one net was working. So I ended up working in the library....not so great, but yah I slept early last nite, so I didn't really do n e homework. Ended up watching Tv, drumming, and playing some Sc for the night. Beats bio.  Well Biology class was usual. Lecturing w/ ms. wiener's annoying "fallowing's" instead of following and other really retarted speech impediments. But we also had a quiz. Wasn't too pleased. Boring, n stuff. Oh yeah, I started to read the book "Left Behind" in this class. I heard from lots of people it's a good book....english teacher, church people, then Rachel Brown told me too who sits behind me. Apparently if it's the same Rachel Brown Calfun knows she's a Christian too. She said the book is ok, 2nd one sucks. Apparently there's like 9 books or sometin in the series now. I don't see how they can prolong the end of the world that long. But yah so far isn't bad. Some people are in a plane........people disappear...their personal items still lying around on the plane. Pilot panics, radios ground......finds out it happened all over the world. People in plane are panicking also. Yah right at the beginning of the book...Chaos. You kno it's a good book when. Then at the end of 4th, for some reason over 40 kids were called down to the office.....and all of em were in gr 10. I wouldn't know what was going on till the end of the day.  English class, since it is the most retarted class in the Ontario curriculum, I'll just summarize briefly. We had a work period for our revolution projects, where we are doing Chinese revolution. We didn't do much. Ended up talking most of the time. We just tried doing some relating w/ Animal Farm and how it was like any other revolution. But yah that was basically it. Teacher also said my book's good. But like I said that's it. Oh yah also........j/k that actually is it.  Well when I got home, I found out what happened after fourth. Jason told me his whole class revolted when Mr McKelvey moved the civics exam from 21st or sometin like that to Friday. "Mr Mckelvey?" "Yes?" "You're an Asshole." Someone said that according to Jason. So they sent a petition to Mr. Scanlon, and they won back their right to have it on original date somehow. I was surprised school actually has freedom, er freedom of speech. But yah that was main reason why almost 35 kids were called down to the office and all of em were in Grade 10. I'd like to do that with my careers presentation.....move it to after exams or somethin.  Well I got home, ate Gung Jai Mein.......mmmmmmmmmm.........fooooood. And then after that I drummed for a bit. Slept. Played Sc for a bit....really boring after playing it for 2 days it sucks.  Well I went to Theory @ 8.  Now I am sitting at home blogging. Wow......Ju Pah for dinner....almost forgot lol....wow this joke has been going around in LCAC for almost like 2 years. Funny how it came about. Well anyways I'm out now.......gonna go do some h/w and watch some TV maybe. *Zing*

       1/6/04   4th day and running of having 7 hours of sleep or less   Well, now its come to that since my house has no coffee......tea is my source of caffeine. I think I'm gonna turn out to be one of those caffeine addicts soon. Well not much happened at school today. Same as usual.....history,careers, math, then comps. REAL boring. Slept through most of 2nd half of day. Wow.....we get notified about exams.....who cares.........school is so boring right now.  Well while doing my stupid english project, I learned a few interesting things. One, since im doing the Chinese Communist revolution, I found out that Mao somehow thought there was a government called "Democracy Dictatorship."   Well yeah today was pretty frickin boring. I came home and played one of the longest games ever on SC with Jason. Josh did play but he went to play gunbound after a while. I still can't figure how the heck a game like gunbound can be so addictive. It's like that old school game scorched earth, but with better graphics and you can actually see the difference between a tank and a walking doo hicky thing. Weird. I think I'll stick with my tea drinking here............if i had coffee wow life would be much better.  Well Imma head out now......gotta do a crapload of bio crap still...........so yah and i wanna sleep 2nite.....try to get more than 6 hours.

       1/4/04   BlAST! SKOOL AGAIN!? @(#*&@&*@(&^!   Well.............the Christmas holidays sure wrapped up quick. Two weeks already. And boom. back in my desk tomorrow......er chair for music class........i mean u can't exactly play a trombone w/ a desk in front of you. ANYWAYS.......yah for a last day wasn't too amusing. Had to work on project and stuff......and basically just moped around the house.  Well Worship didn't go bad today. Other than the fact we screwed up one song........the other 5/6 were good......oh yah our response Gavin kinda changed strumming patterns 30 seconds into the song, which made me basically wait until the chorus before i started playing. Sunday School was just sitting around again....played who wants to be a millionare....with Christian questions since we are in a church. It was nice to see some of the UWO kids back today though. Funny, i'll be one of those old people in a matter of 3 years. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OLD =P.  After  church i ate Dim Sum @ Loang Hing Gok. *Josh if your reading this its LOANG not LUNG or LING or w/e its LOANG* and then Wendy's family came over to look @ my newly renovated........main floor. whoopteedoo.....up till now i think 4800 bux on stupid hardwood flooring is a rip. Oh well but it looks nice I guess. I wish my basement was hardwood flooring.  Anyways......I'm getting terribly lazy about writing emails.......well the memories of 2003 and well the first 4 days of 2004 where there was no school will be in my head for a while.......obviously not forever I mean seriously my long term memory isn't even good enough to remember that "But how the heck can I remember the times tables?" Write more tomorrow. *Ponk*

       1/3/04   Last week of Holidays......Grrr '  Ugh......just to think that school starts in a matter of two days.....GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY! Winter holdays were so relaxing, and now I gotta work again, and do stuff for school.  First thing though, I was pleased to see some people replying to me and josh's 4 page long email about HYPE in 2004.......I was surprised people read it even lol. It's so long........my eyes were burning when I was writing this thing. But yeah it was nice to see basically what people thought....and what they agreed and disagreed with. This is democracy kinda i guess........sorta.  Well today wasn't so bad I guess. I woke up around 11, since I had to start up my careers project and finish a few finishing touches for church OpenOffice presentation tomorrow. Originally I called Gavin and Josh to come over and just hang around.....but josh wouldn't come because he thought 3 hours was kinda pointless. In the end Gavin came over for a bit and we played around on ps2, and watched pirates of the caribbean. Since he brought his guitar, we thought we'd "Jam" for a bit downstairs w/ drums and guitar combo................The AzN Stripes.....Watch out Jack White we gaining real fas *not.* Well honestly we didn't sound TERRIBLE......but we both realized we need more strum patterns for guitar. Funny kinda, throughout watching pirates of the Caribbean....we somehow got really bored, seeing this movie over 10 times, and we started replacing a word's first syllable with the first syllable of "Shmuck." You know, like clock would be "shmock," guitar would be called shmuitar, and modem would be "shmodem," which we cracked out laughing our asses off when we figured out what word it almost sounds like. Oh yeah, and also talking on MSN I told marcello I mite buy Silent Hill 3, and he sorta said was kinda pointless since the game is kinda "scary" i would play it alone and I should just rent it.....that was when i countered with my usual random rants....but this one made sense.......well as a Joke cuz seriously who da hell would play PS2 w/ a cross, clove of garlic and shotgun beside em? yah dat was basically wut i said  back to marcello......like I'd actually do that =P. And after doing that for about an hour and a half came dinner........roast beef=P. Wow it was good.  After he left.....well dat was basically the end of my day.......played some SC, and now im gonna sleep. Geez blogs take so much time....and also so much brainpower to think.

       1/2/04   Exhaustion at it's Max.....For a Holiday kinda Day   Wow. Today I actually woke up before 12pm. Yup, 11am I was up and about around the house. Why? Well first I had to get Vince's guitar for Gavin because him, Josh, Me, Carmen, and Rebecca were doing worship this week. Also, I was really hungry @ 11.....that pizza pop around 3am did jack. Left the house around 12:55 after lunch....and a cup of caramilk hot chocolate *Where can I get those?"  and picked up the guitar and amp. Then after picking up Carmen......we were on our way to the church to pick songs and practice for Sunday morning. Well Gavin was the first one to arrive.....waiting for us at the front. We would all then go in, and wait for Josh. I decided to dribble around a basketball and sit on the comp @ church for a bit surfing da net while waiting for Josh to come. He would arrive around 15 minutes late....or somethin like that, and we would end up starting practice around 3ish.  Today's practice seemed different though. I don't know if it was because of the hot chocolate, new year, or just a word of prayer before actual rehearsal, but practice ran really smooth today. We started off with a "Mini" Bible study....getting info out of the passage read, and seeing what songs could fit this week's theme (Promise of God's Help). We would get out some theme words like justice, love, mercy, and a few others which I seem to have difficulty remembering right now.....short term memory. Bah! Like it even exists. We then chose some songs.........which turned to be difficult but wasn't chaotic, and would eventually manage to choose six main pieces and one response piece. Oh yeah, Josh was eating out of his bag of cancer while we were doing this (McD's.....seriously you don't think it's food right?). I was already pretty tired out by Five, where we had a break for a bit. I was starving and raided da fridge where I would find chicken fingers.......BUT THEY AREN'T MICROWAVABLE! SERIOUSLY WTH!? They make microwavable pasta which is frickin disgusting yet food that isn't really food......more of a carb substitute they force you to bake. Why don't they make foods that are supposed to be healthy stay healthy.....and not shove it in a microwave safe box and zap it for however da hell many minutes it tells you to. First it tastes like crap and who really want's to eat microwaved tomato sauce? Kinda defeats the purpose of gourmet Italian dining.  We'd finish doing rehearsal around 630....ish. Wow......dinner was good..........Tofu......mmmmmmmmmmm.........beef........mmmmmmmm...............and of course Rice....mmmm. Food is good. Eventually I'd decide to go to Roger's Video and rent two movies. Saw Pirates of the Caribbean (Again) and Bowling for Columbine...which I always thought would be a gay movie till I saw it. Really points out facts you'd never realize....like why da heck Americans seem to think the answer of why their country is violent is because of a bloody history. Seriously, it looks like a drip of ketchup compared to British, Japanese, German, or Chinese history. Some of these wars......er revolutions last over 500 years and the Americans seem to brag and bitch about a 1 year revolution and seem to think it's the largest amount of bloodshed ever to occur. Oh yeah I really liked da brief history they made in that movie too........that was hilarious! Watching the Americans seeming to have some new fear introduced to them every decade. It doesn't exactly have a theme......more of sadness......relieved w/ comedy......then raised questions like why the heck do Americans always think that guns n ammo are the only way to solve problems. Ever heard of diplomats? Meh guess not, since they seem to still be convinced after almost a year that Saddam has WMD's even though they haven't been able to find any trace of one. Also not every building in Africa makes nuclear weaponry......some of them do make things we use like Aspirin. Smart idea bombing a legal drug factory.  Gonna sleep bit earlier tonight........and I still hate the time this stupid blogger runs by........it's around 2am and this stupid website seems to think in eastern time zone it's only 10pm. Well im out. Actually gonna sleep early for once.

       1/2/04   First day of New Years: Work and some Chillin   Well, after the party ended @ 3am, I went home, talked on MSN for a bit, then went through a relaxing 10 hours of sleep.......oooh yes.....sleeping from 4am-2pm sure kicks ass.............sometimes. Well after waking up from a phone call from Gavin, I decided to haul my butt outta bed, did all da morning stuff, then headed downstairs for a lunch of porkchop *mmmmm.......porkchop* and of course.......the best substitute for potato.......rice. Well afterwards, decided to start up my careers project......finished one slide of presentation when Josh then called. Wanted to know if I could head to his house for a bit to hang out n stuff. Went. Wasn't bad......played some NFSU........eventually butchered the game in dragging into Tony Hawk imitation One with stunts like 360's and flying into a tunnel roof then ramming into a pole. Yeah, doesn't match up exactly to Tony Hawk, but closest you can get with stock Volkswagen Jetta GTI's.  Well, after that, we played a bit of fooseball. I lost to Josh when he played one handed. Yes I know I am pretty pathetic at fooseball, but meh, last time I played it was in August=P. Well my dad ended up picking me up around 6:30 or so.........in a truck. Oh yes, driving in a freight truck, realizing you are as tall as a house.....pretty exciting compared to sitting in a Mazda MPV for most of my drives around town. We went to pick up dinner at Golden Dragon *which by the way is probably the best Chinese Food joint in town* and wow.......i bump into my aunt, uncle, and cousin *I think Kora was her name or something like that.* Well, after talking to them for a bit, and paying for our food....we are on our way home......until my dad realized he's till in his truck and you can't really fit that thing in a residential area that well. So he dropped me off first, and the food, and then drove back to Ah Jau to pick up his car and park his truck.  Mmmmmmmm..........after dinner.....dinner was soooo good. Grandma and Uncle John came over. I just sat downstairs working on my careers project and talking about some HYPE issues with Josh. Eventually we both agreed to send out a e-mail to everyone about our aims and hopes for the fellowship this year. Also, I finally got the theme for the service this Sunday. Now I gotta find some music to go with this theme....."Promise of God's Help." Trying a hefty bit of brand new songs, no typical "Forever" or "Now That You're Near." That's the only problem I find with doing worship for service.....your choice of songs kinda runs dry after a while......I really don't know how those UWO kids find so many songs.....I struggle to find 5.  Well after finishing the 4 page long email *combined both my part and Josh's* we emailed it out. I had some trouble at first because hotmail is the most retarted email program in the world. Wouldn't even tell me what was wrong I had to find out commas don't work that well in email addresses. After that....meh decided to play some Starcraft *Old School Game* with some friends. Now......hmm.......it's around 2:40am. Gonna eat sometin, read up devos.....then probably sleep. I actually have to wake up before noon tomorrow. Have to pick up Vince's guitar and then pick up Carmen. Praise Team singing practice tomorrow. I REALLY need a drum teacher, or take the time to make up some new beats.

       1/1/04   Fresh start to a Prosperous year (Well kinda fresh start)   Who woulda thought.....2003 really zoomed by. And already, it's 2004. Well......2003 was kinda a flash. I can barely remember what happened in 2002 and what in 2003. All I remember is a flash of movies, some kick ass sitcoms *Family Guy* and of course.......I got my PS2 this year ^_^. But of course, there were also the deficits of this year, like when the winter was short as hell *not as bad as right now though*. But snowboarding was still good. Then came summer. I started to breakdance a little bit again, and also I tried out some basketball. I've come to like it alright now. Overall I thought 2003 wasn't that bad of a year, even though there was SARS, blackout 2003, Mad cow disease.......the list of crap that happened to us this year goes ON and ON and ON. And who can forget Bush's efforts to take over half of Asia? What's next? Meh......either Iran or Saudi Arabia I bet. But in a way I suppose it could be a good thing......least supposedly we don't have to "worry" about WMD's hitting our borders anymore.  Well, spiritually, TC really did boost up my Christian walk. I mean honestly I've never really realized how important religion was until this year. Even though I only got to go one day of TC, personally I think my spiritual growth has really skyrocketed this year, with the forming of HYPE and being able to bring three new members to our english service that are around our age, I think that this year is an indicator that 2004 will be more successful. Also, relationships within our church I find have grown also, as there seems to be less hostilities than ever this year between the youths at my church, which of course is a good sign.  Yeah, so overlooking 2003, it was a good year, ending off with a nice party at Carmen's house, and of course kicking off the new year of 2004. Well the year sure kicked off for me really well......countdown just finishes, everyone's downstairs either sober or half-drunk....all of a sudden I get the TV remote. Then after channel surfing for about 30 seconds Lo and Behold.......I kick off my year by flicking to Porno by accident and with everyone just staring at a 60" gargantuan projector screen. Weirded out. Well yup this will be going down in my personal history until.....well I guess something else happens *maybe next year I'll accidentally tape it over a family video Idea courtesy of Jason* AND JOSH WOULDN'T MOVE. Oh well, it would all be forgotten *well not exactly but no one talked about it* after we saw Finding Nemo, which I have to admit was a well done movie for Disney. Geez that company's been unstoppable this year.....with Pirates of the Caribbean, Nemo, some other movie about bears, and all those stupid "exclusive" DVD's that no one would even give a crap about. For 2004, I guess I just hope that this year there won't be as many negative things happening in this world....and maybe hopefully see some more positive things. Also, I'm hoping to make it to both days of TC instead of one. I think that's basically my new year's resolution right there. Yeah I know, it isn't the biggest resolution, but it'll take more than being sick from "Da Been Lo" to keep me from going to day 2 this year =P(It's almost been a year and well whadya know I still haven't forgot it). Well obviously I have high hopes for HYPE to keep on growing, both spiritually and in size, and another thing I'm hoping for this year is probably that the church may grow also. And for myself.........I want to try to finish all my community hours and also I want my own frickin TV in my room. Heh, funny......parents said they would get me a cell phone in october and LOOK NOW...........TWO THOUSAND FREAKING FOUR and I'm still stuck here with a quarter and calling card. Grr..............Oh well, I have bigger fish to fry.....probably too many.....LCD screen, speakers, photo printer, Adidas shell toes.......wow the list goes on and on for stuff I want for 2004.  Well, now's about the time where I sleep, make a few thoughts about whether I really will be commited enough to blog everyday, and think of ways to make life interesting. Well I'm off to sleep now.......Happy New Year to everyone......wow I can't wait till Chinky New Year now.....that's probably a holiday that beats new year. $$$,food, and alcoholic drinks........beats food and just alcoholic drinks at new years.

       2/29/04   Leap Year Day Blog! Exclusive every four years! So Read SHMUCK!   ONE DAY, ONE DAY, ONE DAY ONLY! This is the one and only unique.........LEAP YEAR DAY BLOG! Ehehehe.......or not. Hmm......what's so great about leap year anyways? Just wastes more time.....and makes your year one day longer. And like I said before it postpones TC. Grr. But it was a pretty good day still....got a few things done........and had Adrian over for a bit. And of course church in the morning...which was actually pretty amusing today. I liked today's day in church a lot  ^_^. I actually heard more than 70% of it today lol. It was a good message too.....about pressing onward towards a goal......like........football, well that was the analogy that Pastor Mackness used. but more on that after the beginning of my day......  Make this short.......Woke up, ate, picked up Jason, and we are well on our way to church.  Today at english service.....well Gavin had to do worship alone. Though many of us did offer to help out.....well none of us were really prepared....so he flew solo today. Did a decent job too.....until he kinda played 3/4 time for a 4/4 time song. Gavin's as good as subdividing as he is at badminton (BURN!). Just kiddin' man I know I'm worse lol. Well today's message was about "Pressing onward toward the goal," which if I didn't hear wrong the goal being heaven. Well I think it is at least. Pastor Mackness used sports a lot in his analogies today.....which really caught my attention ^_^. He talked about football......about how the offence has to press onward towards the endzone to achieve their goal, and also how they can start from anywhere, but their goal is still the same. They will also meet obstacles on the way, and sometimes it may even take 3 plays on the goal line before the touchdown comes. But the point is.......we are still aiming for the goal, and if we are strong enough *look at this from football or spiritually* we will break through all obstacles and succeed. He also talked about runners too.....especially about the one in the 60's that had a childhood in legbraces *think her name was Wilma or sometin* and in the end she was the 100m champion in the Olympics. But yeah service seemed so short today......it actually passed by real well. I then talked to Pastor Mackness about his sermon. Think I said a few words too many like "Today's sermon I liked....normally your other ones are kinda you know.....boring ehehe" OOps=P. I meant it in an encouraging way heehehe.....k yeah I was pretty cornered by then......mentally lol. Well after that went downstairs to chat for a bit...like usual and for some snacks after service.  Hmm......we really just chatted around.......then class started. Talked a lot about school. Mostly about how Gr. 10 math is retarted.....and how U of Waterloo apparently has a Biotechnology/Chartered Accountancy course? HUH? I was pretty confused then lol. And then to class.  Class lesson today........we learned about different names that God has had throughout history.....Jehovah, Elohim, under Jehovah there were A LOT of names. Hmm......Sarah *Pow Pow* came again today.....that was good to see. She kinda fell asleep.....but least she made the effort to come. I guess attention in class will come in time. Rome wasn't built in one day as they say =P.  Well then took Jason home, and had lunch. My afternoon of going to buy some new shoes maybe plus maybe a few new clothes was kinda foiled when no one could give me a lift lol. So I improvised w/ comp and some SC. Talked to Lindsay and Company on MSN for a while lol. Did some pre planning for next saturday lol since it takes us friggin forever to plan sometin. Then called Adrian over for a bit......well from 5-9 lol. Did lots of stuff. Silent Hill 3 *which we got scared shitless at some parts* played some NFSU, DDR w/ controller *not mat* and tried to mix songs w/ PCDJ. Meh....wasn't that bad. Oh yeah also got him a copy of sc=P.  So yeah today wasn't all that bad. I mean I pre planned for the week, chilled with Age, went to church, and of course.......blogged. So yeah I'm out for the night........Later. G'nite.

       2/28/04   Blasted Leap year postponing TC...Bah.   It's unfortunate how much difference one day can make. I was at my piano lesson today and when I read the date "February 28th" I thought SWEET TOMORROW'S MARCH! Wait.........is it a leap year? D'OH! *Ugh* Now I gotta wait an extra 24 hours for TC. It's actually a really exciting time. Other than the fact I can escape this blasted hicktown that I live in.....well a "city" in Canadian standards, but also just the fact that going to a conference w/ so many other Christians....really is an awesome feeling. But other than that....my Saturday was pretty mellow.......not exciting......or boring........but.....so-so.  Due to piano practice.......I had to wake up earlier than usual. But I had some of THE most peculiar dreams ever. Unfortunately I don't remember the dreams that well now......but I just remember waking up and going.....=S. This is why I should write out an outline for my blog earlier in the day maybe lol. Some thing I want to put in......never get put in. Dreams to me are vital. They do so much in life. If it weren't for dreams we could never imagine the unimaginable. Also they can poise so many questions in life. If I remember correctly....I think it was another dream about our church in the future. Hmm...Deja Vu? or if there's a French term for "same subject of dreaming twice in a row?" *Shrug* I think that I think just a wee bit too much on that subject. But there's some food for thought on what I think a lot about.....dreams. Maybe I've been influenced by the Joseph in the Bible...the dream interpreter I mean not the one that Mary was married to.....or maybe I just like to think about things like this.  Well after 60 minutes of playing the piano *I ACTUALLY PLAYED MORE THAN 200 MINUTES THIS WEEK!* I had well.....brunch. Snow peas have become a fav food of mine now. I'm not a vegetarian....but I'm a fan of veggies. I'd prefer Chicken Caesar over Steak. Wait scrap that hell no I'll just prefer it over a burger......steak is another story lol. And I realize chicken is a meat. But yeah had some of that w/ some beef......and of course the universal food that goes with anything.....Rice. And some milk instead of tea for once. So yeah after that it was off to piano.....where I'd realize that this year's a leap year *crappage.*  Well a different twist in cars too. Dad took a test drive of the Kia Sorento *mid-size SUV from the imitation Hyundai company.* Actually the car's not horrible. The interior I like a lot.....but I still hate the name brand. It's kinda like how I prefer the Mazda Tribute over the Ford Escape though they are the EXACT same car almost. Different names though =P. But the Kia isn't bad at all. It was actually a decent car. But off to piano now...  Piano was alright. I've decided to do Gr. 8 exam next January. And apparently Mrs. Mitsis has a whole plan to have me conquer Gr. 8 and 9 piano in one year. I would do grade 8 exam in January.......work my ass off until June and then do my Gr. 9 exam in June. Possible? Yes? Great chances of it happening? Maybe. Doing all that and still succeeding in theory and school? That will require some thinking lol. But I'm thinking this could work.....WHO NEEDS GR. 11 MARKS IN SCHOOL =P. Me. Yes Shut up I realize that I need both.  Well when I got home..........I started "planning" to go to Masonville w/ Caitlin, Rebecca, Sarah, Lindsay, and well.....Hammond. Hammond didn't really help at all though probably caused more chaos than good lol. Well originally it was either movie or just chill @ the mall......but the Hammond added we hang out at his place. So we would spend 30 minutes figuring out which one to do.......then in the end I kinda thought "Hmm.......it's 2:30.......dun really wanna just go do sometin for an hour and a half and then go home" so I kinda dropped out. But in the end...Sarah couldn't go to the mall anyways since she had to babysit....so it was down to two choices.....Hammond's or Mall. Hmm........then it went to one.....but that was after another 30 minutes. Hammond finally actually asked if we could go to his place and the answer: No. So yeah.....this kinda pissed off a few of us, the fact that we spent an hour deciding over nothing basically. So yeah...in the end only the girls went. Oh yeah and lesson learned from that: When planning w/ Lindsay, Rebecca, Sarah and Caitlin plus Hammond......PLAN 7 DAYS AHEAD!  Well so I stayed on MSn a bit. Made plans to throw around the football on the street w/ Patrick for a bit. But before that......talked to Jenn and Gerty on MSN for a bit. Yeah recalled TC memories......and Jenn convinced Gerty to use Friendster. Lol Jenn seemed to have some competition w/ "Joe I convinced Gerty to use Friendster you lose!" I didn't realize there was a competition but in that case........Blast I lost. Wow look at that emotion.....*zzZZZzz.* But yeah good times........can't wait to meet up w/ them, Ju and everyone else from TC again this March Break. Wonder if I'll even see em @ TC....I mean 500 people....might be kinda hard to find em......=P. Hmm then again I wonder how many Asians really wear Adidas tracksuits lol. Referring to me by the way you slow shmucks.  And then I went to hang out w/ Patrick. Threw around the football then played some PS2. True Crime can be kinda fun when you're bored lol. We kinda just ran around the city doing random drive-by's, roadkilled some people and imitated the movie "Speed." You know the one w/ Keanu Reeves, some chick and they are struggling to keep a bus going so it won't explode? Yeah we imitated that lol.......but failed miserably when we rolled down a hill because apparently.......buses don't have enough horsepower to make it up a hill lol. And I decided to try a Jackie Chan maneuvre by jumping off a freeway.....but kinda got foiled when my dude died hitting the ground. So yeah did that and then went to Wendy's.....then HYPE.   Wendy's not much to say. Well she dyed her hair again......it's red now. She kinda was gettin peeved at me not noticing.....eheheheheheh sorry 'bout that by the way Wendy but yeah.......she kinda got mad at me for that =P. Ehehehehe=D. Well after that........I quickly ate.....waited around for dad and then me and Jason got driven to church.  Tonight we had.....well a spiritual version of Sex Ed. It.........was kinda weird. I guess I'd never think about having a thing like that at a church........but......well.......it kinda "flowed" along. Well before that...I got the crap scared out of me by Pastor Mackness when I was going down the stairs *Can pastors scare the living daylights out of a church member? lol* and also we had a few exciting games of chess. We butcher the game so bad it's not even funny. Well first game I sorta took over a evened out game between Gavin and Calvin....then kinda made it one sided for myself when I kinda slaughtered Calvin's army....er "army." Then the first game against Jason. Offense never beats Defense =P, as I would show in Game 1 as I absolutely killed Jason. But 2nd game......well technically I lost........pointwise but we aren't playing by that are we hehe. So yeah.........I lost all my pieces......cept my King and Jason still had King, Queen, and a Knight. he still never checkmated me lmao. Our game stopped when Pastor Mackness stopped us for the fellowship to officially commence. Oh yeah and the others had a seriously pathetic game of Twister lol.  The video......was featuring an American woman. She had an awesome message though. And her charisma reminds me of that motivational speaker we had this year at the beginning in September. She had some jokes......but also her message was really serious. It was about how intercourse is really a gift from God that shouldn't be altered from its status. In simplified terms......don't do it until after marriage. It's really benefiting though in the end I guess....won't have to go through all the annoying crap @ 30 when you're only 15, 16, etc. So really its saving you trouble. Heh and she also brought up another subject, the fact that after sex girls and guys care WAAAY more about pregnancy than something like STD's. And how abortion can bite you in the ass........she told a story about how some girl had abortion......but while they were taking out the baby they kinda pulled out her intestinal tract by accident *shudder* or sometin like that and the fact she was hemorraging afterwards, and had to go through ER. Now she can't have kids or go the the bathroom properly. That kinda gave me the creeps. But yeah there were a few funny jokes she told.......like the one about how she used to always wonder why teens seem to not understand the concept of sex w/ only your marriage partner and after marriage......but then again the President of the United States seems to not understand this "complicated" concept either. This video I'm guessin was made in 98 when Bill Clinton had the affair w/ Lewinsky. Dissed by his own country's citizen on a worldwide video. Ouch=P.  Well got home now.......and I am blogging. This one might not be THAT exciting....but *shrug.* Like I said it was just another average day. But yeah...........13 days and counting before March break.....and 18 more days until Senior TC 2004. WHOO! Lates.

       2/27/04   A Relaxing Friday after a Stressed out week........shweet   FINALLY! As if it hasn't came slow enough. This week was one of THE slowest weeks I've ever had. Though it was slow, it still did have its good times. The week after Huntsville......LOTS OF PICTURES! Some of them were hilarious too. Saw a pic of me and Mitch where I was catapulted almost from it, and also we the mass pics of the rock paper scissor wars. It was overall a good week. Good recovery from Huntsville. I liked the week. Entertaining, fun, and of course work *shudder.* But it all ended off with a pretty good friday. Though I'm still horrible at windmills, I've found a new move to try working on: Inverts=P. But I need new pics for breaking, and also I need to get windmills. Argh. But anyways off to the beginning of my Friday first.  Got to school around 8:10, so basically I went straight to music. Saw some people there already, and looked at some Huntsville Pics. I think they were Rebecca's pics. Also made fun of Thompson and his crummy piano playing. But yeah today was usual, played music, Mr. McCumber I think had therapy or something.....he hasn't got mad in two days. NO WAY! Oh yeah and saw Mrs. Wharton. She's coming back after March Break. WHOO!!!!!!! YAY! FINALLY! ONLY 5 MORE CLASSES OF McCUMBER OPPRESSION! 5 MORE CLASSES OF DICTATORSHIP.......BEFORE ONCE AGAIN BEING........umm............well a NICER DICTATORSHIP! WHOO! And then to science.  Did a physics test today. I'm actually kinda considering turning to sciences for my University career, cuz I do get decent marks in it, and it does kinda beat number crunching. But basically today we had a test, and I think I did ok on it.  Lunch....went to Jaspers, I think I scared Eddie w/ my cheap imitation of him.....with the "Hi Joe............." well yeah instead of that it's now "Hi Eddie................." OK n/m lol. Anyways yeah, chatted w/ Thompson mostly, since we kinda ditched the others when they wanted to go to some crap sub place for lunch, and yeah talked to Monica a bit.....and the person she went out for lunch with........Krutika her name? Pretty cool name actually. Well me and Thompson left early, and we kinda saw Jaime Christian walking back to school, so chatted with him for a bit. Apparently Justin Deyell thinks he's the BIG MAN now since he dissed Thompson with one of THE cheapest shots ever. Well today Thompson couldn't find this motor thing for the Vibraphone, and when he said "I can't find it" Justin mutters "your penis." HA. Ha. ha. NOT! Geez if Justin ever gets to read this entry......YOUR JOKES SUCK! WOW...........that's real original isn't it. Wow he's 'bout the biggest smurf I've ever met. Honestly.....he coulda at LEAST said it to Thompson's face. Might have had A WEE BIT of effect....like Thompson whooping that kid's sorry ass. Honestly if you're gonna diss someone with a crap diss like that.....at least go up to them and say it. But all in all....yeah dude *Justin Deyell* Get a life.  And then off to bio. It was a pretty fun class today. Day 1 of presentations. The people did the Lymphatic system. Unfortunately they had some technical difficulties w/ the powerpoint presentation *Tommy they used powerpoint* and couldn't get it on the big screen. So they improvised with a long video, and one of the members of the group lecturing about the Lymphatic system. I tried helping too, but I failed to get it to work =(. Yay for my techie skillz. Boo.  And English we read, and was reminded about the upcoming book report.......and yeah that's basically it.  I'm blogging as fast as I can today because I still gotta practice my cheese piano, so bear with this lame blog. I'm gonna MAYBE get 5 hits from this blog probably lol. Well anyways.......  Dan came over after school........we chilled, got LOTS of food, and just talked about random crap. And played PS2. DDR......I BEAT HIM IN ONE SONG! Forgot which one BUT I BEAT HIM! AMAZING! Practice for the DDR Competition tomorrow...........on a controller? Meh. Lol. Dan should enter the DDR competition though......he's actually really good for a grade 9 kid. But he says he'll "consider." Hmm what else.........OH YEAH! We totally fooled Calvin over MSN lol. We were both on MSN, and we were talking to Calvin, and somehow convinced him we were at two different houses. Got him goin on with that for almost........30 minutes? Yeah it was pretty funny =P. Sad how he couldn't figure out I was typing for the both of us. Sad Calvin just sad lol. And then UCC.  There were a few of us @ Session today. Calvin came too. Steve, Igor, Spencer, Stefan, Mike, Evan, Joseph *FuFu if I spelled it right* and some other people.  Well anyways today I still have crappy millz, Lost most of my power moves, but I still have Handstand Hops ^_^. And I still need to work on the following:  -Millz -Turtles(Smooth them out) -Smooth out crickets -Airchair -Inverts*NEW* -Tabletop to forearm to handstand to hops *MY YEAR GOAL OTHER THAN WINDMILLS* -Footwork -........  OK YOU GET THE POINT! I HAVE TO WORK ON EVERYTHING BASICALLY! ESPECIALLY STYLE! I've come to the conclusion of I HATE FRIGGIN POWER MOVES! But I like to try inverts....fun move. Had to leave early today though so I can rush home to still do retarted piano lessons.  And now.....talking on MSN......and blogging. Lindsay and em are over at Sarah L's right now.........Karaokeing? *Sigh* I thought only my family still did that lol. But nope.........apparently it's pretty popular among lots of people now. Makes me kinda want to get Karaoke Revolution lol. But yeah........I heard much about their desperate struggle to get it to work w/ the TV *How hard is it?* and heard much about.........their boredom of being on MSN......impatience w/ hooking up the Karaoke......and Caitlin's Belly flopping *WTH?! Lol.* Anyways yeah..............sooooooooo................ANYWAYS..............  So now.......I must go. But before that.............Hmmm.......To go to the DDR competition? Or not? HMMMMMMM..........................I'll decide later =P. Cya.

       2/26/04   Day Two of being Half Blind.....Fun.   Well by now my eyes are slowly getting back to normal....but that wasn't the situation at 7am. Car ride to school......boy I wish I had bought sunglasses when I had the chance. Basically all lighting is fine right now.....but when I walk outside and the sun reflects.......it's like Calvin's description of walking into STA: GAAAH SO BLINDING! *STA=Lots of white people.* But most of the day wasn't that bad. At least my pupils are almost back to normal size....only cover 2/3 of my iris now instead of 99%. Day was pretty average.....school then home. I was kinda over the top though in math class. And I'll start with my day in 3...2...1...  *BAUNG!*  7:30am: Joe wakes up to another brightly illuminated day. Stupid Sun. GAAAAAAAH HIS EYES ARE IN PAIN! WHAT WILL OUR HERO DO NOW? SUFFER FOR THE NEXT......6 HOURS!*dun dun dun!* Anyways I did usual morning routine.......then got a ride to school. No good music on this morning. Crap on Energy...Crap on FM96...Crap on 103.9...106.9 I never liked...Grace FM....wasn't really in the mood this morning to listen to it. And got to school. And it was blinding. And I'm happy that school's don't have super big windows.  We watched a video on the life of Adolf Hitler today.....since we are doing World War II. Hitler's childhood really sucked. He had a dad that beat him and he didn't have many friends, though he did have high marks in school. And then he got turned down from some Vienna art school many times, fought in WWI, and then some other stuff happened *he got put in jail for a bit.* Then he kinda started WWII. But yeah Hitler never really had a great life. And of course most of us know what happened in WWII. Anyways yeah that was most of history class. Ms. Manson kinda yelled at us because apparently some people were doing work from other classes. Someone needs to calm down o_0. But yeah after that came civics.....between the time switching looked over a few civics notes....well tried and failed miserably.  Civics. First thing Hammond says when he sees my pupils is "Joe are you baked?" No I'm not. We had a quiz...........then talked about our editorial cartoons. Lindsay, me Hammond and Dave were a group. Lindsay failed miserably at talking bout hers so Hammond kinda covered up for her lol. Looked at "Media Spin" afterwards. Looked at the front page of Globe and Mail and London Free Press from Tuesday. I never noticed.......but the headlines are REALLY different. London Free Press talks a lot more about local stuff, while the Globe talks about international. That makes me kinda think twice now when I want to subscribe for newspapers. Comics....or world issues? GAH! These can be difficult things to choose......if Globe and Mail had comics though they would kill London Free Press. And then lunch.  The struggle to walk to Jasper's. When you have dilated eyes. Oooooowwwwwwww......And then ate. Mmmm food. Coffee was REALLY good today. Mixed four different kinds.......and added LOTS of sugar. It was good. ^_^. Thompson  got a pretty nice meal today for only 4.75. A whole breakfast plus a coffee. I had a Bagel. Crap.  Math.......yeah I was wired. VERY wired lol. That pretty much says everything for math. Normally I mean I'll sometimes make a few jokes and laugh a bit...but today was kinda over the edge. I think Mr. Gilbert thought I was probably stoned or something lol. Big Pupils+my stupidity in math class=Debatable Stonedness. Don't worry I wasn't stoned....just very Hyper. lol. Learned something about roots and stuff. With numbers outside of square rooted numbers. Nick and me were pretty confuzzled. Mophead seemed to sorta understand it.  Programming......my project's quality is degrading rapidly. Least my marks are decent...84 in programming. Wee! not much else happened. That was the main climax. I still don't get how Dejan can make his so good. Me and Pokan kinda have the same type of project....except his is NBA and mine's NHL. Lots of people are doing sports. Brandon is also doing Hockey....Original Six.  And home.......bused, talked to Ryan on the bus.........and now I'm at home.  Not much else to say. Upcoming things for tonight: Piano practice and studying for Physics. Later. Yeah like I said today wasn't that excited......just blinding. For me.

       2/25/04   Wee.....I know what it feels like to see far things but not close things!   And of course today was.....EARLY DISMISSAL! Although it was that, I had to spend most of my afternoon at the optometrist......eye examination. Apparently last time she wasn't able to finish everything so I had to make a second appointment. Wow......this waas one of the most messed up eye examinations I've ever had. But first my regular school day. I'll have more on half blindness later =P.  First thing that happened was Band. Today actually didn't go too bad. Our band was able to basically play out a whole song in 15 minutes. That was pretty cool. Oh yeah and the new song we learned.........the Trombones get to do do that "gliss" thing. You know when you see in cartoons n stuff the trombone person slides the slide up and down and makes that really funky noise? WE GET TO DO IT! It's kinda fun....sorta. Seems more fun when you do it for fun though. That was the highlight of band really.....umm.......played some songs........and apparently Mr. Clark did think we sounded good out in Huntsville. Even we think we sounded bad but meh, if he says it's good......I guess it's good. Oh yeah....and the one day I decide to wear my Adidas Tracksuit......So does Zavitz. I had my black one and he had his red one. GRRRR! I want like a Dark green one if there's such thing. THAT would be nice.  Well in music.......Mr. McCumber was actually normal for once and didn't PMS.....but Thompson did.  Apparently Mitch and Lauren took all the good new percussion parts, leaving Thompson either bells or.....that one where it has all the little parts. Hahaha. Yeah that basically summarizes music. And of course the usual boredom. Not much else I can think of.......so......off to science.  Handed in two labs, and then prepped for Friday's test.....bleh.  Lunch........crammed for bio w/ Tehm, Rachel and Underhill. Circulatory system is VERY retarted, especially when you have Ms. Wiener as a teacher. She's more useless than the textbook put it that way. Anyways yeah we crammed for the whole lunch which was only 45 minutes since its Early Dismissal today. So now....time for..........  *DUN DUN DUN*  CIRCULATORY UNIT TEST! GAH! ARGH! EEK! CRAP! DOH! ERGH!  It was REALLY hard........and I was suffering in there. When you're half sick writing a test.......it's REALLY not that fun. But it woulda been difficult both ways.....when someone in your class has a 98 average in bio *won't mention names* and still panicks about this test....you know that if you have an 89 average in bio *me* you're basically screwed over unless you studied like you'd eat pie. I'm saying this in hopes you like eating pie. So yeah........50 minutes of that grueling crap and then English class..  Had a small quiz. Wasn't much. Probably failed because I kinda didn't do the homework =P. Read Act III.....Shakespeare by now is VERY disturbing. And I'll summarize what happened since most people have probably read this play Apparently Juliet is already married to Romeo.....but then her father not knowing this decides to make her marry some Prince. Mrs. Gayed actually made a pretty nice remark about that though:  "Unless you live in Utah, I'm sure that marrying two people is still considered disgusting and illegal."  Yeah that got most of the class cracking......if it didn't get you. And if it didn't.....shut up that's not my humour there that's my teachers.  I AM STILL AWESOME!   And then YAY! HOMETIME! AT 1230!? OF COURSE IT'S EARLY DISMISSAL! So bused home with Ryan.....and then got home and got ready for eye exam. Ate basically. Mmmm...........Porkchops......and.......Snowpeas. MMMMmmmmmmmmm. Food.......  And now for my exciting story of my stinkin' eye exam.  Well when I got there.......she was still out on her lunch break. So I waited around in that coffee shop in Sears for a bit...drank coffee obviously or why would I be in a coffee shop and then went back at 230. Apparently all she wanted to do was give me these drops to relax my eye muscles. Two kinds to be exact. The first kind of drops kinda felt like she was pouring Sprite in my eye, and the second one I felt like regular drops......so now I was supposed to come back in 45 minutes so the drops could work their way in my eyes. Now I wouldn't know what these would do until AFTER I looked in a mirror......HOLY SHIT MY PUPILS ARE AS BIG AS MY.......Iris? I think that's what it's called......you know the part that's coloured? Anyways it wasn't brown anymore.....it was black. Oh yeah I noticed something was wrong when I walked outside...and the sun seemed REALLY bright. Anyways back to the Optometrist now......apparently my eyes are bout the same....just my right eye is being more and more blind. Wee. Left eye is still the same basically =P. And then.....Now to suffer the rest of the day half blind....can't walk around outside or my eyes kill........so I thought NAP TIME!  *WUMP* Sleeep............yay!  And now I'm awake.....my Pupils are still immense......and I can only see things more than two feet away from me. So yeah I'm kinda trying to get around homework, Piano theory, piano practice, and attempting to identify the keys on the keyboard while typing. I seem to be having success......oh yes typing at 90wpm does have its advantages. I basically have this 104 key piece of crap memorized. Anyways I'm off now......still got work to do.....and still live my life with pupils bigger than my iris. Cya.

       2/24/04   Dream A Dream...   A new approach to my blog.....since I just woke up from a nap my mind is sorta a fresh new slate. But that was AFTER my boggled mind when I was napping. I have two particular dreams I remembered..........one about my church and one about LCD monitors. LCD Monitors? Yes I know it seems weird.........but it seemed as though it was about them taking over....with some moustached dude lol. Funny part is I've never seen this person before. It's almost like when I dreamed about people having no pupils......when I never saw that in my life before back when I was young. By the way I am not a GOTH.......or anything like that.....but I find it interesting how sometimes I can dream about things that I've never seen. Then it poses me with questions of whether God is making me have those dreams or some other supernatural force? But I'm not about to explain that.  As for my church dream.....well it was interesting. I kinda well..........ENVISIONED sorta I guess my English congregation being a bustling service. However....there was no change to the building. We are in the same building as we are now.....except in my dream there were a few new light switches. It was interesting though. If you were to ask me to interpret this.........it seems as though something's telling me.....that it doesn't matter what you're church looks like *my church is kinda small* but it matters on the state of the people. It was really interesting though how this dream even came about. People I remember from it include some people from my school.....and some lady that resembles someone off TV. I think that came in just because I watched Prime Time ABC. But the other people.......either God may be telling me to evengelize to these people.....or my mind just added them in as cameos since I can't think of anyone else. And I also had a dream about evangelizing over MSN. I think I've been on the comp too much these two days.  Well something there to think about......now to my day.  Day one......meaning I have history first period. Well we had a test today on the 30's........and it was kinda easy....so I'm not really panicking. But doesn't matter......we are doing World War Two....and back in grade 7 and 8 me and some people kinda went WW2 trigger happy after Enemy At the Gates. And that stuff kinda carried through grade 9. So yeah my history mark is gonna be good. ^_^.  And then now off too good old boring civics. Oh wait I forgot......I'M IN THE SAME ROOM! The boredom, sleepy attidude civics class has. But today's class actually wasn't that bad. We talked about editorial cartoons and actually had less than 10 pages of notes to take. WHOO! That was fairly interesting......sorta. But the editorial cartoons part was great. Ms. Manson actually did something amusing for once! So basically all class we looked through all these newspapers about cartoons. Some of them I didn't get at all......but others were pretty funny. Lots are talking about the Liberal Tax Scandal, and how Paul Martin basically got given a falling apart Government. Poor dude. Oh well....looks like the Liberals are gone next election.....probably =P.  Lunch.....I went to Galleria. I ate from International Soups. I ate pancakes. I went back to school and played some basketball.  Math class........yeah like usual me Mike Nick and John led the loudness wars. And like usual Maggie and Becky and them had to suffer=P. I'm actually sorry if I cause any distruption........ok I won't lie I can't help it sometimes.......but I'm sorry I cause a distruption......this time it's for real. In fact yeah I think I'll try to pay attention more and not act like a jackass. Maybe my mark will go up even. NO WAY!  Programming class.........yes the quality of my Hyperstudio project drops drastically from photoshop to crap pics off the web =P. Well anyways today instead of Mr. Dayus we had........either Ms. Hurley or Ms. Howard. The two look the same to me. But anyways yeah we "programmed" all class. Overheard some bet between Hermann and Pokan for one dollar. BIG SPENDERS!  Then bused home.........chatted with Zavitz and Underhill about a Inner City Olympics. What would happen if Harlem or Compton had an Olympics? With events like "Popping caps into a car" or "DRIVE-BY!" The Olympic Federation would go from 1 million viewers to 0. Ha....Ha....Ha? Ok maybe it's not that funny to some......but at the moment it was pretty funny with random stuff like that popping up.....the event thinking was probably the most challenging.....but funny.  Anyways............got home and went straight to bed. So friggin tired these last few days.  *WUMP* *Four hours later*  And now I'm awake yet again....blogging and going to start homework soon. Gonna go eat first though. Later.

       2/23/04   And the boredom of school strikes yet again....*sigh*    A teacher is using the "scientific method" to teach the class about evolution...  TEACHER: Tommy do you see the tree outside? TOMMY: Yes. TEACHER: Tommy, do you see the grass outside? TOMMY: Yes. TEACHER: Go outside and look up and see if you can see the sky. TOMMY: Okay. (He returned a few minutes later) Yes, I saw the sky. TEACHER: Did you see God? TOMMY: No. TEACHER: That's my point. We can't see God because he isn't there. He doesn't exist.  A little girl spoke up and wanted to ask the boy some questions. The teacher agreed and the little girl questioned the boy.  LITTLE GIRL: Tommy, do you see the tree outside? TOMMY: Yes. LITTLE GIRL: Tommy do you see the grass outside? TOMMY: Yessssss (getting tired of the questions this time). LITTLE GIRL: Did you see the sky? TOMMY: Yessssss. LITTLE GIRL: Tommy, do you see the teacher? TOMMY: Yes LITTLE GIRL: Do you see the teacher's brain? TOMMY: No. LITTLE GIRL: Then according to what we were taught today in school, she must not have one!   Thought I'd add that in first. Somethin I read off of my HYPE Counsellor JT's Blog. Thought it was pretty interesting....and funny also ^_^. But off to the rest of my day...  First off I'm surprised at the hits I've got from my Huntsville blog. Turns out people do look at my site when something exciting happens in my life =P. It went up almost 150 from before the post....that was pretty interesting to see. And apparently lots of people from school read my amazingly amazing blog =P. I told you guys the blog would be  AWESOME! . But after that wild weekend.....and relaxing Sunday, came the dreaded.........day of.................MONDAY! *dun dun dun!* Yes it is quite depressing....after a week like that it'd seem like there is no such thing as school. But yes unfortunately we do have school still, though today was kinda fun....especially biology class. I will never think the same of a heart again *ugh.* And of course who could ever forget music class.......so boring and stupid. But is probably the best class to talk to people ^_^. Anyways without further blabbing about that here's a basic summary of my day. Basic as in my usual blog *hee hee hee.*  I awoke at around.......7:20. Tired and still weary from yesterday's 6 hour sleep......I REALLY didn't wanna go to school. Especially since today's a day two. WAAH! I wanna stay home. Well anyways I got up, ate a quick breakfast of well........rice and snowpeas w/ beef......and then left for school, the depressing designation my school building has. *sigh.* Well today's drive to school wasn't that bad. Told stories of the infamous Huntsville Trip....and also listened to the newly formed Grace FM 105.9. They actually sound pretty good....familiar songs I heard are "All in All," and also this other one......but I forgot the title....but it's a really good song. I really like this new station. Has really good music ^_^. Though I haven't heard any like Stacie Orrico or Thousand Foot Krutch yet, but that'll come in time. For now I think Rebecca St. James and Chris Tomlin are just fine.  Trudging into music......I saw Rebecca, Caitlin and Sarah L. looking at.....well.......notes? At first I thought they were pictures......but nope....they were bio notes lol. I actually got to school relatively early today.....which is a change from the usual diving for the bell. At first Mr. Richardson came into the room and I was thinkin "YES NO MR. McCUMBER!" That all faded away.....well more like plummeted away very quickly when Mr. McCumber entered the room. Blast. Gagh. Argh. Oh well, least he wasn't having his daily mood swings today, or "releasing his Volcano." Yeah up until now I still think he REALLY needs counselling. Well we didn't do much since Huntsville was over, so we just worked on that Gambolier song. Oh yeah and then Rebecca reminded me.......WE HAD ENGLISH H/W! D'OH!  Then was time for science. Well today we had a lab.....and also we caught up on what the Huntsville kids missed. We did a lab where we were in the halls and had people run, walk, and crabwalk 30 metres. Obviously the running had the best time but crabwalk and walk had about the same amount of time. Then the Huntsville kids did a lab w/ toy cars going across a workbench. It was pretty amusing when Mr. Roxburgh *our sub teacher for Curphey* was all set to let the first car rip.....then the engine died lol. That was kinda amusing....and Rhoden almost got kicked out of the classroom. Could only be one reason. Can't be rascism since he's white, and it can't be because he's loud because I'd be gone if that happened.....IT'S CUZ HES A FRIGGIN JACKASS! There. Said. Done. And that concludes another day of dreaded Gr. 10 science.   Well......since Rebecca reminded me I had english homework today.....I ended up sitting inside for the whole lunch doing english. Yeah that took up most of the lunchtime. Well least we weren't the only people. Chatted w/ Maggie and Jess Whittaker for a bit, and Chris near the end. Well in the end I didn't finish everything, so I just did what I could and then off to biology class. Really I coulda finished just that......I'm REALLY lazy....and I really don't feel like doing anything at lunch, especially without food. So I then packed up and headed upstairs for bio.......wee.  DISSECTION DAY! Whoo Hoo! I TOTALLY forgot today was pig's heart dissection day! Was lots of fun ^_^. Just the fact that I got to perform an inscision on an ORGAN.......wow I feel like those surgery shows on TLC. Except without the blood since the heart hasn't been in a organism for months probably.....maybe years =S. But it was fun. At first I thought this heart was pretty crappy......since I couldn't see jack squat through all the fat around the heart. But then.........actually before I say what happens you might wanna close your eyes or something to skip this part.  *ehem ehem*  Yeah anyways at first the heart looked like crap.....but after cutting the heart in half......and then revealing the atriums and ventricles.......IT WAS COOL. Then I decided I'd shove my finger through the aorta to find out where the end was. Wow........turns out the heart has LOTS of holes. Vena Cava, Aorta, Pulmonary Vein, etc.  *EHEM EHEM*  Ok and back to the rest of class. Cleaned up and stuff...........and then chatted a bit before next class. It was kind of interesting though dissecting the heart. It looks like an apple lol. Anyways yeah that's what we did through bio class.......but it was A LOT of fun.....though it may sound sickening to some people. At first the stench of the hearts were unbearable....but when the aroma fills the room.......you get used to it after a while.  English class....we read............and then read Romeo and Juliet.  Stage Band X we got commemorated on our performance.....and then left.  See........today wasn't that bad.........actually English class was kinda funny......since reading Romeo and Juliet can be funny. Fishified apparently is a word in the english language lol. Also when you don't know what to add for a sound effect........use Zing. Yeah you have to be in my class to laugh at that.....and if you don't remember YOU'RE CUT!  That's basically my day........and upcoming for the night: studying for history/civics test, math h/w, and science and bio if I can get to it. And of course some good old SC. Later.

       2/22/04   tired......very tired   Hmm....well looking back on my weekend:  Huntsville, HYPE sleepover, and now Sunday.......TOTALLY burned out.  Oi this morning felt so weird when I woke up. I could barely move. But church is always a great way to start a new week.......so of course I woke up. So basically I woke up 20 minutes before we left, quickly grabbed some oatmeal to eat then left. Picked up Jason then headed to church.  Today since it was reading week for the UWO students.....wasn't really that populated. But oh well.....doesn't matter we are still there for the same reason, and that is to worship the Lord. Today's message was about  "Wanting to Really Know Christ." Now unfortunately I was pretty tired from the week, but that wasn't a prime reason. Prime reason why I don't remember that well was just that the sermon didn't really.......hit me. I mean some of the other sermons I remember very well. I mean up until now, I still remember that one sermon from Reverend Li about looking like a follower of God w/ the analogy of clothes, and how people can be judged easily by their clothing. But today's sermon, I do remember two of the prayer items in particular:  -Victor in Australia recently had a car accident *pray for healing* -The movie Passions  Victor I've known for a bit now since he originally attended LCAC, and truthfully he was the one that introduced me into serving Christ in the congregation.  He also really showed me how powerful one's love for God is, as he was the one that bought the church drum set. Up until now I look up to that, and hope one day I'll be able to do something like that. And the movie Passions, which is coming out February 25th, has brought up lots of issues. I mean lots of people have said the movie is anti-semetic, which I don't believe, but also many think that this is an amazing portrayal of Christ's last 12 hours of life. I myself haven't said anything as I haven't seen it, and I can't wait.  Well yeah unfortunately I can't remember the message extremely well.....sorry people =(. But we did have some visitors to do worship. Matthew and Sherene Bahadurs. They had a good lively worship for us, though one of Matt's strings broke on the guitar. But great recovery. And also......like always.....we shouldn't really worry about that as worship isn't about the instrument, it's about your heart. The instrument is just a tool to help. But now yeah off to Bible Study time.  As usual talked for a bit, but today Rev. Mackness put on a video of Primetime ABC. Showed us the interview w/ Mel Gibson about his new film Passions. I guess this film will be pretty epic, with so much to talk about it that they even had a full feature interview with the director, Mel. He spoke a lot about his spiritual life, and how he spent nearly $30 million of his own money on this film. It was pretty cool.......and then after class.......well..............Calvin started up his own Beyblade war with plastic cups. His intelligence has officially hit rock bottom lol. Actually probably did that years ago. But anyways.....yeah I was pretty tired today so I really wanted to get home.......got home and then.........  *WUMP* SLEEP!.  *Two hours later*  "I awoke two hours later, dazed and confused in the dark..." Ok if you don't know what that is that's from Family Guy when Peter was narrating his life and just woke up from being hit by Lois w/ a frying pan. Well today wasn't that excited.......lots of thinking though. Reflected on week while I was lying in bed.......wow haven't done this reflecting stuff in ages. I was planning to maybe do my devos......but I was REALLY tired....I didn't even bother moving my arm to fluff my pillows. But yeah.....thought back into Thursday on the way to Huntsville, Back from Huntsville, what we coulda done to improve performance @ the school, what I should have done in Huntsville Spiritually, HYPE, etc etc. I sat there for at least 30 minutes I think. Got interrupted by Jason for SC....and that pretty much halted my train of thought. But yeah these memories.......ain't gonna go away for a LONG time.....I still find the attempt to teach Teefy and Whitney Cantonese was hilariious w/ the "DEEM Ah WHITNEY!" "DEEM Ah TEEFY!" and of course the bubbling hostility between many of the students now and Mr. Baldwin. Personally I don't blame it all on Mr. Baldwin....but yeah I was sorta ticked off @ the time when we coulda stopped at Timmy's, or Mr. Sub, or Wendy's. Oh yeah and up until now.......I really don't see the fascination of Chinese. I mean when I was on the phone:  *Joe gets off phone* Thompson: LOL Joe how do you speak Chinese man? Joe: Maybe because I am Chinese? Hammond, Thompson, Mitch and some other people: It's just funny how you talk in Chinese then throw in an English word Lots of people: YEAH!...  And then this was the part where I taught the girls how to say What's Up and they kinda butchered it......but it was funny......and taught Thompson how to refine his "MM Ho Gao Ngor" a.k.a. "Don't Bother Me." And some other stuff too lol. And yeah I also thought about the HYPE sleepover. Really wished that I could have made it for the whole thing but yeah still it's all good. Anyways where was I?  ...  Oh yes I remember now. Ate a late lunch, then played some SC w/ Jason. Had a few hilarious games and played this one dude who was friggin amazing.......two games in a row. Afterwards had dinner and etc. etc.....then h/w.....and then now blogging..  I didn't really mind the fact nothing happened today....I actually think I sorta needed it.......after an exciting week like that.......w/ Huntsville, HYPE Sleepover, and Huge dinner yesterday....which was friggin hilarious....yeah I really needed a day to rest...and this Sunday was one well rested day.

       2/19/04, 2/20/04, 2/21/04   HUNTSVILLE WAS AWESOME!HYPE SLEEPOVER WAS AWESOME! WATCHING HAMMOND SUFFER ON THE SKI SLOPES WAS AWESOME!  THIS BLOG WILL BE AWESOME!    CRAP! WHY WOULDN'T MY D-CAM WORK FOR THIS TRIP!?!?!?!?!! GRRRR! Now that I've relieved my pissed-offness......  Yeah first off to explain why I haven't blogged. I'VE BEEN 400KM+AWAY FROM LONDON HAVING A BLAST! That's why. But yeah sorry bout keeping you guys just "waiting" for the suspense that will about to unravel in this blog. I make it sound so exciting no =P. lol. Anyways yeah this is gonna be a 3 part blog, so grab whatever you need to be comfy; you know a blanket, chips, pop....guess a beer if you're over 18. Or not. But anyways.......here it goes. Hope you got whatever you need because this is gonna be one LONG blog. To make life easier if you wanna find a certain date entry use your find feature *Under edit, or Ctrl+F* on your internet browser and type in the date. It might help you out. If it works. But without further delay....*ahem* here it goes.   *Trumpet blasts/drumroll*   2/19/04   In the beginning.....I woke up very tired.   It's 6am. There's no band. BUT I'M AWAKE. It was pretty difficult to get up on Thursday. The morning was a blank. But I remember I had set up everything last night knowing this morning I'll probably screw up. So I did my daily morning routine, and decided I'd shave. Ok I won't go into a lot of detail about a blade grazing across your skin with a 1/100 chance *probably* of you cutting your skin and leaving a scrape. So yeah did that, and I had ju-pah *aka pork chop* for breakfast. My request came through lol. No oatmeal this morning, but something filling. And I got it ^_^. I took my time this morning though, and we left @ around 6:50 with my luggage for school.  Now it's around 7:15am. Everyone is REALLY excited. A lot of talking, excitement, etc. Unfortunately I got dropped off on the other end of the school, so I had to lug my luggage to the other side. I would not realize how heavy my bag was until now. With the snowboard it was hell carrying it. Well I managed, and I decided with this spare time I'd add some cell numbers into my phone. Finlan and Pourier for now....I thought I'd have time to add more later.....wow what was I thinking lol. Anyways when I got on the Violet bus *FINALLY* after putting away my luggage in storage bay, I quickly ran to around the back and claimed a seat. Mitch came too, then Hammond and Thompson. At first this didn't look like a great situation for talking....as no one else came back here....but in the end Lindsay Murphy, Rebecca Mader, Caitlin Stewart and Sarah Lenehan would sit in front of us, and Sarah Teefy, Katie  McVey*I think, or was it McKay? meh* Amy Chick and Whitney Mendez would sit behind us. Oh yeah and Fewster was w/ us too lol. And in the end Finlan came too and sat back here w/ us. And we started chatting a bit......then the bus started to roll. The first few metres, for a 400km bus ride that will be memorable for a LONG time lol.  Yeah about 20 minutes into the bus ride....a few of us decided to play cards already. Gr. 10 kids get bored EASILY. So me, Hammond, Katie....Thompson.....and I think Teefy was the 5th person played President. So yeah I was happy....I was vice prez both times....then I got bored and decided to chat around w/ Lindsay and them for a bit. But yeah the bus ride for the first two hours was pretty fun....lots of talking n stuff. And then after some people decided to nap, some others decided to do somethin else....I pulled out my headphones and Cd Player and started listenin to some CD's. I never really napped on the way to Huntsville...since I had a bottle of Bawls *It's a high caffeine drink not what it sounds like you friggin pervs and shmucks* and also just the trip was waaay to exciting lol. The movie bombed....mainly because it didn't work lol. So I listened to my CD's.....and managed to actually listen through three CD's. That killed around two hours....and then we got off for lunch at a McDonalds *shudder.*  Summarizing lunch....we ate and talked. Greasy food. Funny hicks operating a McD on highway always funny.  And now through into hour 4/6. Right now it's about....noonish? Well anyways people sometimes go crazy on a bus after 4 hours...and me and Hammond are prime examples lol. Well at first we started to throw around a football.....really normal thing. But then....after a while.....I decided I'd challenge Hammond in a game of Rock Paper Scissors extreme *the one w/ the slapping on the hand if you lose.* Well with my "intelligence" and Hammond's true stupidity...I pretty much won lol. It was like 20 slaps to 15. I was the 20, as in I hit him 20 times. Anyways, yeah after that both our hands were purple....after bout ten slaps for each of us we both started to cringe everytime we got hit....then took a few secs to recuperate...then went again lol. Anyways after that....Hammond decided to play Mitchell. But Mitch, who makes a rock look smart decides to play scissors for the whole time. Really Mitch is smart just that he's pretty stupid at times. And well Hammond was relieving his stress on that Mitch was just laughing at the pain. Scary lol. Anyways after that Mitch's hand was like DARK purple. It was such a weird thing that Katie decided to take a pic of it. It was pretty scary lol. Well after that....Hammond decided he was still angry...forgot why. Well anyways so he decided to punch me 8 times or so....and that was when the battle of pillows in the aisle of a bus happened lol. There was silence....then a loud "WAAAH" from me and then...WHAP WHAP WHAP WHAP! Over and over again lol. Then Hammond decided to take up arms too.......and it was a pillow fight frenzy for bout five minutes before our fight was stopped by Mr. Baldwin lol. But it was pretty funny. Exchanging hits with a pillow and then once in a while throwing a punch....we could easily own WWF in viewers lol. After that we chatted for a bit.....some other stuff happened but yeah now we arrive in Huntsville.  REALLY small. But when I passed their high school I had the weirdest sense of Deja Vu. REALLY looked familiar in a dream I had back in.......grade 8? Weird....deja vu's always freak me out. But it makes me believe that something out  there does let you forsee the future...I mean even in the Bible Joseph did with the famine in Egypt back in the book of Genesis. Well we got to the public school finally.....and warmed up....  And we totally SUCKED. Reason A I blame on no prayer of guidance........but Reason two was just because WE SUCKED. The Strings actually I thought had a pretty good performance.....though Ms. Mitsopoulos kinda embarrased herself when she let the tuner go off during Mr. Clark's speech lol. But yeah they actually sounded ok FOR ONCE. Then Stage Band X. We sucked.....cept for last song lol. And Choir........I thought it sounded good until Teefy and Whitney were convincing me THEY SUCKED. I mean I don't mean to sound degrading......because personally I liked the strings and the choir was.......ok I guess....but I guess they had a point. I was sitting behind the choir and they were right beside em, so they have more accurate results.  Well our Gr. 10 band.....we sounded good.........but played bad. Well Prelude and Fugue wasn't TERRIBLE but it did have it's little bumps and potholes. We slaughtered General Greene. Trumpets learn how to count. But Valley Forge March was actually a decent playing. We sounded OK. But overall not our best performance. Well who cares about that now.......WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO THE DEERHURST INN!  WHOO HOO! Finally we reach our final destination. Though we suffered waiting in the stupid bus for an hour for the teacher to get keys, *it seemed like an hour, more like 30 minutes I guess* and then....we unpacked. At first I sorta was panicking when I couldn't find my snowboard....but then I reclaimed it in the end anyways so all came together in the end. Our room *as in me Mitch Thompson's and Hammond's* was sick. Not all the rooms.....just ours. PS2+Monty Python+ good food=good. But yeah it was REALLY cool. First thing though when we got there....SNOW FOOTBALL!  Wow......cold but fun lol. This time though I didn't wear socks since I figured it's a waste....I'll just waste a pair of wet socks....so yeah my feet were COLD. But oh well.....least not wet so no chance of Athlete's Foot....I think. Well in the end I kinda don't remember the teams but My team won w/ Boughton being our star runningback, Kick returner, Kicker and Center lol. I decided to play DB and line at offence lol. Well that lasted about 20 minutes then we were all sprawling gasping for breath...so we all ran in our rooms for warmth. This is when I feel sorry for the next person staying in our hotel room. Me Mitch Hammond and Thompson used the hair dryer to dry our shoes *started by Joe innovations,* then it overheated bout 5 times, and then the front of it smelled like......well..........feet lol. Oh yeah and right around now.......came Mitch's starting of the "Smurf."  Joe: Your face on a grill on a bigger bigger grill Mitchell: Smurf you Joe Joe:?? *stunned look someone's capable of being that stupid*  Wow........the word Smurf will now replace shmuck or co-exist with it lol. They both go with ANYTHING lol. Well anyways these two words....Smurf mostly would be the ultimate universal word lol. And we shoved everything in the fridge, hooked up PS2....basically we started settling in for our 20 hour stay lol. This trip woulda been perfect if Mitch chipped in his part though. Hammond brought pancakes, I brought PS2, Thompson brought our energy drinks *8 bottles of Bawls=lots of caffeine* and Mitch....WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING EGGS BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOO.He decided to bring money to BUY eggs at a non-existent supermarket we were supposed to stop at lol. So we played some PS2, chilled for a bit, talked to our neighbours...who were DL, Dave Wonnacott, Boughton and Burke. Then we all headed down for dinner.  Dinner met up with some people. Chatted w/ nick and Meaghan for a bit...but in the end I decided to sit at the table w/ Thompson, Mitchell, Brian Wong and some other people. Well really wasn't decided.....more like forced since there were no spots lol. Well dinner sucked though. Food was horrible. But before that Hammond comes up to me with a carton of eggs. Apparently he had gotten free eggs when he asked for some.....sweet diplomacy there. Hammond if you're reading this this is why you were a diplomat back in that river game in civics lol. But yeah anyways back to the crap dinner. I payed 120 bucks to get spaghetti and meatsauce, garlic bread, and some dessert? Wow this place really needs a lesson in cooking 101. If I wanted spaghetti I woulda made noodles back in our room lol. So I quickly ate....and then me Mitch and Hammond jacked some drinks n stuff for the ride home lol. Also Hammond had to put away the eggs so they wouldn't go bad. So yeah after that....well we kinda split up and this is where the blog focuses on me more...since I dunno what the heck happened to the others lol.  Basically me and Hammond snuck back into the dinner since weren't supposed to leave *oops =P* and then we all left for some free time. Squash, Raquetball, Pool, Hockey everything was there. Well first thing a lot of us did was watch Christian play Pac-Man....wow he's actually not bad at it lol. And then me and Thompson played some pool. I WAS SO CLOSE TO WINNING. Then I lost lol. Well I dunno where the hell Thompson went or Mitch but me and Hammond went to watch a heated game of Tennis between Rebecca and Finlan. Lol friggin hilarious. Finlan with his cockiness thought he was AMAZING at serving. He made 1/10 serves. 6 went out of bounds and the other 3 flew into the net. That's about the right ratio =P. But yeah Rebecca plays competitive or somethin like that though she didn't seem like it at the moment. I don't blame her though playing badminton against Finlan is a boring moment of life also.  I thought I'd head back to the room though....since I was kinda tired....I decided to play some DDR while waiting for Thompson since he was there too getting stuff for skating. Well I decided to stay there for a bit afterwards though since Lindsay and her posse kinda invaded my room lol. So we ended up playing some PS2, DDR mostly, and then chatted for a bit. I seem to be the only person in Gr.10 music that understands the game lol. Well maybe if I stop by Masonville I'll be able to play sometime^_^.  After that we headed down to the ice rink but ice hockey was over....but they were gonna start road hockey ^_^. So I went along too......and we played a good hour or two of road hockey. Fun. I didn't really do much played defense and pretty much just cleared the puck...since I have no aim whatsoever with a hockey stick lol. Reminds me of back in grade 3 though when my whole street used to play road hockey. Good times. Well I forgot which team won.....think we did since Hammond had double Hat-Trick and Nikki just can't play net in hockey. Hockey is different from soccer Nikki lol. And Sarah Wild, our goalie kinda just you know.....milled about. She was on the girl's hockey team but I don't think she played net. Kerry who was also on the hockey team scored a hat trick on Sarah. But we won be default since Hammond just ripped shots through Nikki lol. Really that was the end of my night since I was dead tired by then. This was also after we played a group of strangers by the way lol. But admist the fatigue, then I thought "Hey why not play some Squash?" and did that for a bit.  We got back to our rooms around......11ish? Meh whatever point is....we took Monty Python and the Holy Grail and all the guys basically ran into Boughton's room and watched it lol. We all got booted out around 12 though when Mr. Baldwin threw us all back in our rooms. Lol....this was when Hammond was really close to being caught with a Mechede in his hand and looked like he was gonna kill me and Mitch lmao. Well I walked in actually before and saw Mitch w/ the knife......about to cut my tylenol bottle. Wth? Yeah I was thinking the same lol. But yeah back to the Hammond story. Basically it went something like this:  Hammond: WTF I FORGOT MY SPATULA FOR THE PANCAKES?! WHAT AM I GONNA DO?! Joe: Umm maybe you could use the big knife? Mitch: You mean a mechede Hammond: *Finds knife* Hmmm...........RAGH! *has an angry look on his face w/ a knife* *Mr Baldwin walks in*  Hmm........Uh oh. Lol. We were lucky though w/ Hammond tucking it right behind his arm lmao. Then when Mr. Baldwin was looking around.....he slowly made his way to the drawer and threw the knife back in. Wow that was a close one. Well basically after that, played some Madden on PS2, then went to sleep. Called for a wake-up call for around 6:15am so until then g'nite.  *I'm not done you retards*   2/20/04   I SNOWBOARDED ON A HILL RATHER THAN A BUMP! ENRAGED STUDENTS THREATENING MR. BALDWIN! And of course HYPE SLEEPOVER!   Those were some of the main things that happened. Really actually day two kicked day one's butt all the way to.......England.  But before the good times....came the retarted. STUPID ROOM SERVICE! LEARN TO MAKE WAKE UP CALLS RIGHT! HOLY CRAP! Instead of waking up at 615.........I WOKE UP AT 550! STUPID SAM ZHANG! Apparently he made a wake up call for us. Stupid Smurf. lol. Well yeah in the end though not much of a choice we all woke up. Hammond got right to making some pancakes and I put the noodles on the stove. We all took our last bottles of Bawls that Thompson brought along for a jolt into our day. Hammond then called Lindsay's room *who was above us* and woke em up too. Yeah we can be jackasses but meh lol. We called them and asked if they wanted any food but they said no. So we ate our breakfast, also started packing. Mmmm pancakes and noodles lol. We even had extras. So me and Hammond decided to go try selling our stuff. We found a customer: Sam Zhang. The person that made the stupid wake up call @ 550 for us? Well yeah free breakfast doesn't come with pissing us off. He payed us basically three bux *710ml bottle of Pepsi plus a dollar* for 4 pancakes. What a bargain for us lol. 4 Pancakes is around 20 cents.  So we made $2.80 profit ^_^. After the packing....we all went downstairs and then locked our room....when then we realized......DOH! I forgot my towel and Thompson forgot his two pillows lol. So we asked Ms. Mits if we'd see em ever again and lucky she and some people are staying back just for problems like these. Yay! And now off to skiing/snowboarding at Hidden Valley.  Basically it was LOTS OF FUN....kills Boler.....well anything does really lol. But yeah this was a really fun time. Especially for intermediate boarders, since we for some reason had no lesson but we weren't complaining lol. So basically I boarded for the whole 8 hours we were there. Stopped for a small lunch then went out again. Well originally I was chilin w/ Craig and Dave W. for boarding....but in the end I somehow ended up w/ Hammond and Lindsay and them because well Dave sorta lost us and went w/ DL and Craig......well I dunno what happened to him lol. So yeah I basically chilled w/ Lindsay, Rebecca, and Hammond for most of the time. Talked to some other people a bit and laughed at the beginner snowboarders. Mitchell actually was really good for his first time though. Lindsay however was another storry lol. I feel bad for her though. Finlan kinda ditched her when he said he was gonna teach her. Oh yeah and the "best" snowboarder in Central took a fall going off the ski lift. Moron. I mean it's not the fact I hate Finlan......just that he's such a cocky smurf* (shmuck, dink, weiner, insert insult here basically*) and it's funny to see him basically bite himself in the ass after he actually does whatever he's doing lol. Well while on the hills....yeah I made fun of Hammond a lot. Made him suffer going down Flying Dutchman on his first time ever skiing lol and made him literally paranoid on the chairlift when I was rocking the chair around. He was petrified lol. But yeah made fun of Hammond on the slopes a lot to get back at him for the punches and stuff on the bus lol. Hostilities I guess you can say. Well now we are kinda even. So basically for the whole time we snowboarded....and skied in Hammond's case until 3......then had to board the bus for the Inn and then home.  Basically at the Inn again....well I played some last minute squash....and then the bus ride home. Well yeah the bus ride home......is gonna be in my memory for a long time. Lol first of all the chair tilting. Basically it happened in REAL slow motion. After I woke up from a 30 minute nap this happened:  Mitch: Joe move I gotta get some stuff Joe: Ok *Why does the chair feel different?* Whitney: Guys.......how come your chair seems to be tilted? Joe & Mitch: What are you talking abou..............LASJHG AHAFGH ;ASDHGF HL;!  You can all return from the edge of your seats now. I didn't die....nor did Mitch or anyone. Actually no one was harmed lol. So messed up though. Me and Mitch well kinda broke one of the rows of seats in the bus lol. Smart kids huh =P. So yeah from then on me and Mitch had to counterbalance the bench lol. I feel bad for Teefy and Whitney though putting up with that lol....basically their footrest was non-existent. In the end though I moved to sit beside Rebecca, and Mitch moved to sit beside Jessie........another one of Lindsay's friends. So problem solved. Other than the fact we all decided to kick out Finlan and have him sit on the defect seats lol. On our way home though like I said this was one of the most unforgettable moments....like the following:  Whitney: Lindsay can I borrow your Cosmo Magazine? *Mitch catches the title* Mitch: SEX?! WHOA I GOTTA READ THAT! I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT!  That got the whole bus laughing lol. Also this:  Hammond: Mitch, give me back my football. Mitch: Hammond, if you had no clothes on, you'd be naked *Hammond has the weirdest look on his face*  Yeah Mitch was the comedian of this trip probably lol. You can't go wrong with quotes like that. Oh yeah also the reading of the magazines. Thompson was reading another magazine earlier *another one like Cosmo or YM* and then when he'd stop to read certain articles, Mitch would just reach in and like feel up the picture of like a chick lmao. Then Thompson flipped to an ad w/ a Fish on it. Mitch just stares at it......then slowly....cautiously....his hand....................feels up the page. W.........t...........H? lol. It was really weird we all went hysterical after that. Me and Whitney also started to have a two hour talk about club music after she overheard my Strong Bad Techno song lol. Kinda weird. At first she was confused at the song....then got the joke finally w/ the slightly poor quality techno produced by homestarrunner.com's strongbad email  urlLink Techno  *click the underlined stuff*. Afterwards we then started talking about actual real dance tunes n stuff.....then I found out she is actually a Eurodance fan. Wow.....SAME HERE! Someone else that's heard of Sylver?! NO WAY! So yeah we chatted bout that for a LONG time....and Teefy chimed in too with some opinions n' stuff. Oh yeah and then came the starvation for 3 hours for McD's. Mr. Baldwin is gonna have another 39 new enemy students at school now. We all starved for 3 hours basically just so we didn't have to eat McD's cept in the end we still stopped at one. But it was funny....lol we were between a tractor trailer and our bus and Teefy slips on the ice lol. Poor girl but yeah it was a funny moment. This is now why "I HATE MCDONALD'S" quoted from Teefy lol.  After McD's we went back on the bus.......tired......and pissed off......but then crowd control came when we watched "Ten Things I Hate About You." What a chick flick but it was pretty funny at times lol. The English teacher is pretty funny. But the good times would end with a solemn silence for the cause of a 45 minute long traffic jam.  At first we all thought it was another one of those 10 min jams caused by some car going dead on the highway....but when we saw the twisted metal of two tractor trailers, mangled in a ditch, we were all horrified. Amazingly though....amidst the horror..........I found the courage to pray. I don't think anyone else really knew about this around me, but it was a time of silence...and for me a time of silence is a good time to pray. So I prayed for the safety of the drivers and of the safety of the people around it. This would be one sad moment of the Huntsville trip. I guess I did hope that the wounded and passed away were Christians, and that Christ will take care of them if it really was their time to go. But I was surprised at the maturity of the students from Central on our bus at least. All of us took a moment of silence. I was actually amazed. I guess it did worry me a bit.......if it was someone I knew. I was relieved it was Friday though and dad drove locally around London on Fridays, and that it's pretty much guaranteed he couldn't have been involved. Well we talked about it for a bit afterwards, but I guess it was somewhat forgotten.....well not really forgotten but you know how in human nature things do move on.....and we went back on with our chatting about some things more happier. But since the collision did happen, lots of us called our parents telling them we'd run late. And apparently it was in the papers this morning according to Lindsay. Unfortunately both the drivers died.....but I just hope that they were Christian and that Christ will look after them in heaven now.  Well the last few moments of our Huntsville trip.......photos photos and more photos. We got a pic of me and Mitch on the broken seat, I was in the air and Mitch being the counterweight was on the ground. Memories of the chair lol. Then some random pics of all of us. It was pretty cool. Nice ending to a great trip.  When we got back to school though......the collision on the highway apparently did affect us. One of the buses almost swerved into a ditch from the accident, but lucky they didn't. Brian Wong told me he prayed also for them, and both him and I believe this was God's works for sure. So yeah since I believe that, I'd like to thank God for sure for keeping us kids on the buses safe....and this reminds me of the Bible verse in Matthew 19:14 that goes:  " Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven  belongs  to such as these.' "  It truly makes me think of the fact that God does love everyone....Children, the old, and of course the working age people. But yeah I really do thank God for looking over us this whole time.  Well after finding everything I needed to find, my luggage mainly, I said my good-bye's, and cya's, and then headed to LCAC for the HYPE sleepover, which I really don't remember that well since I was already half asleep.  But I do remainder of the workshop I participated in. Since I got there late I just made it for the presenting basically. We sang "Jesus Loves Me" for our song. What the workshop was according to the explaining given to me was they looked over songs, and tried finding the good parts/bad parts of the song, and about what the songs mean. But I wasn't really there for the larger portion of the workshop, so unfortunately I can't say much about it. But I bet it was a blast. Anyways I did make it for prayer still, where I was grouped with Josh and Wendy, and also for GORGON! lol.  Gorgon basically is when our church was pitch black, except for one room having light. Spooky. Reminds me of the movie "Darkness Falls" since the Gorgon can only roam in the dark. Well basically we have to find 3 parts to a flashlight *two batteries and the flashlight* and then put it together and shine it at the "monster" to kill it. Well first game I tried too hard and got tired and then just let myself get tagged, but we still won! Second game....where I had a weapon....we lost lol. Gavin was chasing us down and I provided cover. Basically the people ran out the back door while I whapped Gavin w/ my pillow a few times, causing him to be blinded and confused then ran out the door also. Then 2nd time I kinda deeked him w/ the pillow then ran in. Eventually I got caught though. But the climax of the losing game for us was when Kendrick TOTALLY deeked out a crippled Gavin. Gavin got crippled from running into a wall and getting a door slammed in his hand *ouch.* But the wall colliding....sorry Gavin no sympathy w/ that kind of running skill you deserve to be hit by the wall lol. J/k man. But yeah it was pretty funny at the moment until he stayed on the ground for 10 mins. Then he got cheap and tagged the sympathetic people around him lol.   2/21/04   The aftermath of fatigue from Huntsville.....LOTS of sleeping   Well in the morning......I woke up @ around 1030 after a night of.............sleeping. The others except Mike played Risk while Mike slept also lol. Well in the morning I hobbled around in my sleeping bag...looking like a cocoon and then ate breakfast, had a failure game of Risk 2210 AD and then went home.  And now............well, back to my average blogging life. Today I'm just gonna relax, and wait for the mosh of people coming over for dinner lol. I dunno who but lots of people. But before I close this long entry, I'd just like to say to everyone............  HUNTSVILLE! SMURF! SHMUCK! AND GORGON! And of course.......It was great being the only Asian in the back of Violet bus lol.  Later people=)

       2/17/04   ONLY 1 MORE DAY UNTIL HUNTSVILLE!   WEE! I can't wait. Only two more  days until we drive four hours into the middle of nowhere, play for some hick school then head for the Deerhurst^_^. Wow. What trip could be better than that? Gr. 11 NYC trip, which I am looking forward to.  I'm really tired....so I think that I'll summarize my school day:  -Woke up -Music was boring -Science we had a sub....Mr. Curphey broke his leg so we have a sub for the week -Lunch we went to McD's -Bio was fun...blood pressure measuring is funny and I felt my heartbeat. 60 bpm hehehe. -English was funny. Romeo and Juliet is hilarious when people in your class read it. Elaina can't really figure out how to read without laughing, and Lilian kills literature reading w/ a monotonous voice.  And that was it. Basically. And bus ride home talked to Dejan and Elaina. Took Cherryhill today instead of Whitehills as I was too lazy to wait for Whitehills. So I ran for the Cherryhill. I make sense huh =P. Me and Dejan talked a lot about programming class. Though Hyperstudio is an embarrasing program, Dejan has a pretty sick "The Matrix" Slideshow. I was surprised how nice it was. Well after that I got off my bus...then walked home. Originally I was gonna breakdance after school but no stereo >=(.  Well yeah today was pretty short. From 5-7 it was SC. Then eating. And Now I go do h/w.  Not too exciting....but on Saturday i'll have a blog for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. So yeah that will have to be summarized lol. But yeah. I'm kinda lazy today so this is my blog. *Poink*  WAIT! ALmost forgot. New Haircut lol. And also...yeah that's basically it lol.

       2/16/04   WEST BEATS EAST! And I am very sleep deprived.   Six hours of sleep is never good. I WAS gonna do point form blog today....but decided that since I have time might as well do it the usual way....  This morning was really retarted. Mr. Clark decided that he'd move band from Wednesday to Monday.........wow and after watching some of the all star game *where the west beat east* and washing the dishes from yesterday having people over.......i was just a WEE bit tired. So yeah band was pretty boring.....played songs and stuff. Mr. Clark passed around this piece of paper for us to put down our snowboarding/skiing skills. That was basically it I was VERY tired.  Ok I'll just summarize history and civics. Note taking and lectures from Ms. Manson. Oh yeah me and Hammond planned out what's happening @ Huntsville too lol.  Lunch we went to Jasper's. Jason decided to come too today. And today I realized that Jason paid more than he did at Basemant Jam than he was supposed to. Apparently he thought I gave him a 5 dollar bill for no reason and took his 10, when really I was trying to pay for the both of us w/ his 10 since I figured it would work out for the person in charge of change. So I gave Jason my 5, and the 10 would pay for the both of us. Apparently Jason didn't know that, and he paid for himself anyways. Though in the end he believed it was worth it.....I actually didn't know he still payed for himself afterwards lol. Well yeah had lunch, then math.  Math was pretty funny. "Musical Glasses" as Mr. Gilbert calls is beginning to get very popular. Me, Nick, Mike, and Maggie traded around glasses to see how we looked. Lol me w/ Nick's glasses makes me look like a FOB lmao. With my hair and thick rimmed glasses....wow it was funny. Maggie probably looked the funniest though....Nick's glasses didn't even fit her but when she put em on it was funny. And Mike was annoying John like usual, and vice versa, and I now am improving w/ factoring ^_^. That was the main part of it....and Courtney let her PMS out on Thompson again. And this little ball of something was rolling around on the ground....it amused me Nick and Kyla for bout....10 minutes lol.  Then programming. spent 50 minutes making ONE IMAGE! I TRULY DESPISE *hate is a bit harsh* ADOBE ELEMENTS! JUST BUY PHOTOSHOP YA CHEAP SCHOOL! Well at least I finished it.....and now I gotta work on the rest of my stupid Hyperstudio project.  Stage Band X....final runover went fairly well. Had to wait till 3 before it started though since they had one more coffeehouse audition. So we all sat around in the outside hall waiting for the doors to open. I looked at the other rooms for Huntsville. Hahaha Finlan's stuck w/ Giles. And what else....can't remember much else. Think Brian Wong's with Arjun and some other people. But yeah some of the other room combos are pretty funny.  Well stage band went by quick, then walked to bus stop and talked to Nick for a bit.  Well I'm off to cut my hair now *NOOO LONG HAIR IS GONNA GO!* So yeah later.

       2/15/04   Happy B-day Wendy! 50 pounds of meat..........mmmm   *Insert Birthday song here.* Yeah it was nice to have a day of eating....I mean honestly, what could beat a day of worship @ church, class w/ Brian, NFL street, Wendy's B-day, 50 pounds of meat AND the NBA All-Star game?! All that except game 7 of Stanley Cup finals maybe =P. But it was a really packed day....so packed I forgot lunch and my afternoon nap I was planning...being delayed and omitted by NFL street. Good reason at least.  Today instead of waking up at 8:30 and leaving @ 8:50....I woke up an hour earlier than usual. Why? I'M DOING PRAISE THIS WEEK! Yes.....though I have to wake up an hour early it's worth it. I mean....it just feels so good being up there leading the congregation. No matter the size, you are still there for the same purpose...to serve the Lord and let the congregation have a sense of unity when we are praising the Lord. So I went to pick up Gloria, and then headed to church. Weird. I dunno if it's just me, but it seems as though Gloria lives in the same house as Steph Alexiou, cuz I know they both live on Paperbirch. Who knows maybe Steph rents out the basement to UWO students or sometin. But yeah picked up Gloria, then picked up Jason. Today actually was kinda convenient, as Jason had to do ushering anyways also. Funny. Since he was ushering he dressed up in a shirt and tie n stuff.......but then all the more spiffy look ended when it hit his shoes. Good old And 1's lol. So we got to the church FIRST! YEAH THAT'S RIGHT JOSH AND GAVIN I WAS EARLY FOR ONCE! And we actually WAITED *NO WAY* for Josh and Gavin. So yeah we got set up and stuff, and actually had enough time to run through all the songs. We had a really good run....and when we finished perfect timing.....Pastor Mackness called us to the back to do prayer. We had a guest speaker today. Reverend Li. Amazing speaker. Though his way of speech was pretty funny....it really shot a good point, which I'll explain later. Anyways we did prayer before we started service....and then singspiration.  BAH! Our beginning was a bit rough....but transition into We Wanna See Jesus Lifted High.....PERFECT! No flaws whatsoever. Exactly what we wanted all yesterday....we finally got it hehehe. I think God was there for u for that moment to really help us. We were PERFECTLY in sync it seemed. But yeah singspiration went fairly well from our point of view....but apparently Josh's Powerpoint.......VERY flawwed out. Chris after service basically nagged at us for not looking over it. But I honestly thought we shoulda gave Josh a break. The kid spent up to 2am making the powerpoint....I know how difficult it can be to proofread at that time. Coffee sometimes fails even. But yeah it overall went pretty well.  The message today was very hard-hitting in me. I mean it really gave me a big punch in the face. All this time I was wondering how close of a relationship I had w/ Christ....and I always thought you know.....I think I'm doing ok. But heck no. I can't even remember key Bible verses....like John 3:16 or the Lord's Prayer. Well yeah after the speaker Reverend Li pointed that out....yeah It's time I find a way to memorize Bible Verses. I think the title of the sermon was "When the Lord Reigns...." according to Josh. But yeah Reverend Li gave out an analogy of how Christians look w/ clothes. I mean honestly....when you look @ someone one thing you judge them by is their clothes. In a Christian's life....our daily acts is basically how people judge us....and how we act can determine if people think of us as Christians. Also he hand another analogy w/ Christians living in the light and vacuum cleaners. He as saying how one time this one salesman came and showed him this powerful cleaner and then the reverend's own. You may not see it with the naked eye, but under the light you can see it perfectly. It's kinda like how we may not be able to see everyday Christians' doing....but under the light of the cross it is VERY clear. He was a great speaker though. Knew how to make us laugh yet still make the sermon serious. Then came song of response....which went pretty good, and then offering. It's good to see Jason starting to become so involved w/ our church. Pretty cool sight. After that we then had Benediction, just before we left my dad made an announcement about the dinner @ my house tonight and about if anyone needs a ride contact him. I added the comment for them to try to use one plate so I don't have to clean as much. Then dad mentioned it was Wendy's birthday today *happy bday Wendy!* also, and our whole congregation sang "Happy Birthday" for her lol. Then went downstairs for usual talking before class.  Jason changed from his spiffy suit....and into basketball gear lol. Anyways yeah we had class....discussed the sleepover mostly for Friday and HYPE. Yeah a few of us will be late for various reasons *work, Huntsville, etc* and the confirmed start time is 7. Yeah after that basically I left taking Jason w/ me to my house....and we picked up NFL Street on the way from his house.  Wow.........FUN lol. NFL street was never better. We did some pretty hilarious plays today. We had an all DB team which kicked ASS. Passing? No problem all our guys can catch. Coverage? uhh....6 DB's should do it lol. Then I also had an all D-Lineman team which Jason finished the game with. AMazing defense but crummy offence. Our receiver consisted of Washington from the Pats and...Crap forgot my runningback's name lol. Think it was Payne from the Texans. And also.......the climax....it came when Gavin and them came around 4. LOL hilarious. Well it was after dinner. So first I'll cover dinner. But before that....yeah we got kicked off ps2 and my dad put on LOTR I *seen it like 10 times so I left for comp* and yeah we all stared at Gavin playing Gunbound for bout 5 mins.....then DINNER!  50 POUNDS OF MEAT HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER! Plus salad, and etc etc. WoW AMAZING! I was stuffed afterwards. Plus we had B-day cake for Wendy. And then after that we headed downstairs for some PS2. IT was the faceoff between Gavin and his Brother....HENDRICK. Dun, DUn....DUN! Basically it was a huge game of interceptions and MAAD plays. Hendrick mayde 70 yard bombs....and  between the two of em they had 5 inteceptions in less than 3 minutes. ME AND JASON STRUGGLE TO GET 1 IN 3 GAMES! But yeah hilarious game....and Hendrick WON! which was hilarious. Gavin was pretty humiliated afterwards. Such a good game though. And then Jason played Wendy....where surprisingly Wendy was actually playing decent against Jason. It's just the fact that *quoted from Jason* "SHE PLAYS SO UNPREDICTABLY I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH HER!" Lol on a passing play she would run it then pitch it 4 times before her player was downed lol. Though Jason won.....he won in a very frustrating way lol.  Yeah after that some Virtua fighter where Wendy and Jason dominated. I hate the game. Wendy got sick of Silent Hill 3's camera angles, and then everyone had to go.  I washed dishes afterwards. Whoo.  And now I'm off to sleep. Band 2morrow. Later. Yeah but overall....very fun day.

       2/14/04   Happy Valentine's Day!...Pretty fun day   Hmm though Saturday's always start off groggy and slow, it ended off pretty well. Praise practice, adventure of getting Josh's stuff from UCC parking lot, and HYPE.....NOTHING could ever top that.....except for a better day =P. Yeah weird Valentine's day huh? But I still don't get why some people sometimes despise Valentine's day. I mean it's like any other day........but now stereotyped w/ red hearts and cinnamon candies shaped like hearts, when really the heart would never look like a.....two humped thing coming to a point. The actual thing is like......you know......the thing that pumps your blood. But yeah......honestly Valentine's day to me is like any other day....I don't exactly hate it, nor do I love it. I don't get why 30% of the people I know seem to hate it. Anywho....yeah on with my day.  Like I said, my day started off slow like usual. Woke up at 10am, and then started to practice piano right away. Scales, dominant 7th chords, etc. They were all there. Ugh torture. And it pisses me off how I probably won't be doing June exam but doing February exam just because of stupid techniques n stuff. My songs are actually REALLY good. But yeah went to piano lessons, then right after that I headed off to church...er wait....wait yes I did go to church. Forgot I had brunch hehehe.  Anyways I finally made it for worship practice. Apprently Chris isn't doing it this week, so only me, Gloria, Josh and Gavin were doing it. Originally I thought Chris would too because normally he did, and also he called me. Well we ended up only practicing for an hour and a half or so.....when then I made a cup of hot chocolate 70% powder, 20% sugar and 10% water.......wow as it good. Tastes like a Cadbury chocolate egg liquified. Gavin and Josh were practicing songs for HYPe meeting tonight. After they were done I called mom to come pick me  and Josh up, and take Gloria home. Well while we were waiting.....we had LOTS Of chips.....mmmm Fritos are soooo good. And then I forgot how this ever came about but yeah me and Gavin started to break down the saying "Your face on a grill on a bigger bigger grill" in ways like this:  Joe: YOUR FACE ON A GRILL ON A BIGGER BIGGER GRILL! Gavin: Hmm........wonder if there's a way to shorten it. Joe & Gavin: Uhh............ Joe: YOUR FACE ON A GRILL....SQUARED! Gavin: THAT'S BRILLIANT!  lol jokes. But yeah we started breaking that down, then we went into more detail about if grill was an exponent like the following:  Joe & Gavin:Grill to the fourth plus grill to the fifth equals grill to the ninth Josh: Exponents don't add unless they are multiplied Gavin:That's not true....we'll ask Gloria. Gloria can you add exponents? Gloria: What's the base number? Joe & Gavin: Grill.  Yeah that was part two of distinguishing the saying about faces on grills. And then after  that mom finally arrived and drove us home. Stopped Subway for food, then went home. Well my mom went to UCC, and me and Josh played some SC w/ Jason, and I played some DDR. By now you should know I don't have a mat since mine BROKE! Ugh. Anyways yeah......well when it was time to leave for HYPE....we realized somethin. Well my mom took the minivan w/ Josh's stuff to UCC, and well my dad was taking us in the Honda. So we kinda had to get Josh's stuff somehow. Lol in the end we drove to UCC parking lot, stuck a note in mom's car....and yoinked Josh's stuff from my mom's car and put it into dad's. It felt so weird lol. People were just looking at us as they passed by with the weirdest faces. *Why are those people taking stuff from that car?* But yeah after that we picked up Jason, and amazingly.....we were kinda early. Er.......well more like 5 mins late but in my time it's kinda early lol.  HYPE was pretty good today. First off since we didn't start right away, me and Jason were locked in a "fast" paced game of chess. Lol since Jason was missing a rook we used a Hershey Kiss to replace it first of all. Afterwards Calvin ate it lol and we replaced it with the remains of the chocolate...the wrapper. Yeah I lost in the end, but for half the game Calvin would barge in and switch around pieces in stuff. Pretty funny game though. Anywas we  then started off w/ some praise songs led by Josh and Gavin, then we split into groups talking about prayer. I hope this lesson helped some of the new people *or n00bs as Brian K called em lol* that have just recently started coming to our church. It even got me back on track...and reminded me of the ACTS thing to help with basic layout of prayer. Actually normally I pray in  like a letter format...you know salutation, body paragraph, and closing. Well I almost totally forgot about the ACTS acronym, and I'll share it with you guys now:  -Adoration -Confession -Thanksgiving -Supplication  Basically it means you start with you know....words of praise. Then you start to confess your sins and ask for forgiveness. Then you a word of thanks...for you know......the stuff He has done in the world for you. And finally supplication....or prayer requests. Yeah that is basically one way of looking at prayer. Obviously you can just do one sometimes....but yeah that's one basic layout for praying. There is also PART, but I forgot what it stands for. Praise, word that means confession that starts with an A, forgot what R is (something like thanks giving) and Thanks. So it's basically the same thing, different letters. But yeah we learned about prayer mainly....and then ended in a closing prayer. After that we went upstairs to grab some stuff to eat....and Jason went onto alienware and made a 17,000 dollar comp lol. But yeah we then watched a bit of slam dunk competition......then had to go home.  Anyways I gotta sleep now. Gotta wake up early for worship tomorrow. Later.

       2/13/04   Gonna Miss semi=(...Least I'm sessioning =).   Yeah it's unfortunate. But with all the Gr. 12's not having tickets, huge lineups, and the trouble the school's going through just to fit as many Gr. 12's as possible to semi, I felt that I shouldn't buy a ticket. I mean really, I can still go to semi next year and Gr. 12, but the graduating class.....it's their last year. So that's why I also kinda felt bad for them since 250 of the 500 going to semi are 9ers. Honestly be a bit generous you fresh shmucks. Give up your tickets to people who may never see some friends ever again at a dance after this semi. But oh well, least I can't be blamed for selfishness, I decided not to buy one just to hopefully let another Gr. 12 get a ticket. So yeah instead I'm gonna just go session tonight. But yeah I couldn't believe how many 9ers are going to semi this year too. 250 of them. Last year the gr. 9 student body *the one I was in* only had 250 kids lol. I wonder how the semi's gonna go w/ half of them being 9ers. Meh. Well yeah this is why I'm now ending up going to session @ UCC instead. I hope I can sorta link millz tonight, or get one handed rollbacks.....well at least get the foundation of it =P.  But anyways to my school day. I WAS EARLY FOR ONCE AND MADE IT TO PATRICKS HOUSE *breathes* WITHOUT HIM COMING TO MY HOUSE TO PICK ME UP BECAUSE I'M "LATE." YEAH that's right. And I even got to school BEFORE 810. Wow punctuality....but for some reason I kept thinking I forgot something.....meh I'll figure that out later I thought.  Well off to music. YAY NO MR. McCUMBER! MR. RICHARDSON WAS BACK! For a day. He as a pretty cool teacher. Some of his jokes were pretty funny from before I remembered. By the way Mr. Richardson was our previous long term sub teacher. Mrs. Wharton is still not back. But yeah we had him for a teacher today, and then Miss. Mitsopoluos *I dunno how to spell her last name, some Southern Euro last names are so cool but hard to spell.* Well according to Jason's blog *go to it it's in link section of my site* Miss. M's name is spelled  Mitsopoulos. Wonder if he's right. So I was kinda close. But enough side tracking. Miss M then came into our classroom and handed out Huntsville Itineraries, and also hunted down the people who haven't payed, and also talked to us about how we gotta sign up for a bus.. YAY! We only play for one school for half an hour, then have one and a half days to screw around and do w/e we want. SOOO COOL. Hmm....wonder how I'll blog for that day. Laptop? Doubt anyone would take one. Meh I'll blog after I guess. Oh yeah and also earlier when I looked at bus signup sheet....Hammond signed us up already. That's good........except we were on the empty bus. At least more people signed on later lol. But there were only like 10 of us before. I felt so isolated. But meh not anymore =P. And then off to science.  Confusing like usual because I hate physics, and also more note taking. Nothing amusing really.  And lunch. Went to Jasper's Cafe and did some bio h/w. Didn't really finish it. Couldn't even finish one sheet. What a waste of time lol. I shoulda brought theory h/w. Oh well anywho yeah that was basically it. And then......we walked back to school and time for bio class.  Bio class was not productive.......but friggin hilarious today lol. We were "working" on our projects, but me Underhill Robert and Okanski wasted our time just talking bout random crap. We went from ghost stories to spinning a pencil top lol. Yeah we talked about movies like Darkness falls, Butterfly Effect, Chuckie, etc. Rober then pointed out it's kinda weird how we are talking bout this stuff on Friday the 13th. Weird. Meh. Uh huh. Ok.What? Bleh. I'll stop with that now. Anyways yeah we did that for the whole time.....and talked about haunted stuff. Lol it was a funny class though. Best Bio class ever probably. But yeah after all that wasted time with some productivity......it was time for 5th period.  English we read more. Left Behind is still a awesome book. It's actually a book I'm interested in. I might try finding the 2nd book now too. But yeah now the main character Rayford finally believes in Christ, and now starts going to church after the saved go to heaven. And some other Sunday Christians *aka Christians who don't really believe therefore not being saved* and those now go to church and are more devoted seeing what has happened. And some other stuff....but I won't reveal anymore. And then we read more of Romeo and Juliet. Remember when I said I thought I forgot something? I did. My Romeo and Juliet book=P. Also Heather was telling me about how she had EVERYTHING for semi....but then wasn't able to get a semi ticket. Poor kid. I feel so old calling people my age kids lol. But yeah I really feel bad for those people. I mean spending 350 bux on an outfit, plus shoes, and in girls' case getting their hair done and etc, it can really be costly. Anyways back to Romeo and Juliet.  Read the scene w/ Romeo and them at the Capulet party. I doubt I'd actually ruin this story if i revealed it since I think EVERYONE has had some perspective of this play. So yeah we read that, took some notes, and etc. etc. Oh yeah there were some funny parts. Like I started laughing my ass off when they said "the chinks" in one part of the play. People understood why lol. But yeah I just started laughing a lot. And another part everyone was laughing too. Romeo and Juliet can be a funny play when you compare some words used then for good w/ words used now w/ a bad meaning or sound like it *ho, chink, knave, etc.* But it's really funny.  Anyways left school..o0o0o got a ride from Patrick. o0o0o0o what? Yeah he happened to pass by my bus stop and offered a lift so I took it. Apparently Patrick's dad was trying to find out where to drop off Pat tonight at the Hilton. We found it, then went home. On the way back Pat was talking about Mr. Rice and how funny he was. Reminded me of last year. Especially the Sarnia trip lol. I remember Hammond told me about how Mr. Rice shut him and others down at their trip to Sarnia *there was two:*  Hammond and others: Mr. Rice why don't you chill w/ us back here? Mr. Rice: Uhh....no I would rather not sit back there w/ fags and losers like you.  That tops Dan's story about Miss Howard making fun of him for doing the I BROUGHT MY GUNS TO SCHOOL *flexes arms lol.* But yeah on our trip Mr. Rice was making fun of Mr. Douglas a lot and also talked about LOTS of stuff that happened to him @ Yuk Yuk's when he worked there. Hilarious teacher. But yeah....once I got home....I realized I forgot something else. CRAP I WAS SUPPOSED TO WAIT FOR DAN. That kid is gonna kill me lmao. Oh well yeah anyways I hope he went home and won't be stranded somewhere like EOA. So anyways I'm out.....gonna go do some stuff like piano, SC, sleep, eat, then Session. Later.  And I'm back. Yes back from sessioning. Well anyways before I went to session, apparently Daniel did come to my house lol. I accidentally sorta forgot *sorry man if you're reading this* about waiting for him, and well he decided to bus on his own and show up at my door.........VERY PISSED. I was pretty apolegetic about it....ehehehehe today hasn't been the best for memory bank huh =P. Well yeah he came, we hung out for a bit, ate gung jai mein and then left for UCC.  UCC.....meh. Still trying to work on windmill. Yes that's without the "s" as Will pointed out. I can't really get past one lol. My 2nd one looks like crap. Ugh well least I can still hop w/ handstands. Oh yeah me and Calvin nailed our double planche move too today lol. Oh man my triceps hurt like hell now though. What else happened at UCC? 1990/2000 free circle lol, trying to work on air chair and millz, oh yeah and Calvin can sorta do headspin now. I really need to work on breaking more. Need space/cardboard.  Anyways yeah that's basically what happened...lots of breaking. Anyways I'm out though for good now.....still gotta finish up piano and some other stuff. Cya.

       2/12/04   Final descision: Can't go to Semi. And It's Marcello's Birthday.   Yeah before anything else....HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARCELLO! Yeah unfortunately I couldn't go to the party tonight because I had to go out for a family dinner.....but hopefully he likes the gift I gave him.  And onto the rest of my day.  This morning I sorta woke up early.....but then decided to flop back into bed. So yeah in the end I didn't wake up early, and left at the same time as usual. Patrick was waiting outside on my driveway again in his van. Ugh makes me feel late lol.  Well today was a day 1 so I really don't care if I'm late or not. History isn't exactly IMPORTANT. Especially CANADIAN HISTORY. Well it's ok i guess...but Depression era sucks. Well we learned about the Dionne Quintuplets......"famous" group of babies which I never heard of. Apparently they were the first group of quintuplets to survive through a lifetime. Two still live I heard. But yeah we watched a video for the whole time today. And then announcements came.....apparently they are selling 100 more semi tickets. But too bad I forgot the form so I'm ruled out of that by default. But yeah after announcements came civics.  Civics we learned about symbols of Canada. OUR CLASS IS SO FRIGGIN QUIET. Ms. Manson even thinks we are too quiet for a class. You know your class is sad when the teacher says you're too quiet. But yeah the peace kinda broke after Nick started to do that water dropping thing with his mouth, and I started to talk w/ Hammond and Dave. Dave was talking about his dad's army stories like this one where this guy had to be trained to give himself needles, except when he stabbed it into his thigh he stabbed it the wrong way and ended up piercing his thumb. And my civics class is so crappy......only like 10 people are going to semi. My class seems to be the quietest class in the whole school.  Anywho after that came lunch. YAY! Nothing special today. No pushing into snow, no snowballs. Just plain old lunch at Galleria.  And in math it was like usual. Lots of laughs and crazy stuff happening. Mike was drawing on John's neck, and eventually John got so pissed off that he almost threw Mike over his shoulder. Then me and Nick started talking about.....how our math class couldn't ever factor x+1.....and we'd all have hemorrages and die....but then I realized you can't factor x+1. lol. And I forgot what the square root of one is. Yup.....this is why I have an 80 in math =P. Smart kid eh? But yeah we didn't really do much today except review. And got some h/w. Now to programming.  Programming started late because of this law test Mr. Cox was giving out to gr. 11's or 12's. Well yeah today we started working on projects right away. I in the end decided to do NHL, since breakdancing needed mpg's for video clips. Now I need to figure out what to do for the NHL thing. Oh yeah and something kinda funny happened today in programming. Cam was kinda put on the spot lol. Wilson came into our programming class, as the Gr. 12's are looking for scalpers for semi, since it's their last year. But yeah basically it went sometin like:  Wilson: Anyone in here willing to sell their semi ticket? Cam: I'll sell you mine for $200... Wilson:*replies quickly* 4 for $100 Cam: *Starts counting fingers and stares blankly* But....WAIT A MINUTE! THAT'S LESS THAN THE AMOUNT I SAID.  Yeah real smart there Cam. Lol. But yeah he was kinda put on the spot there. But also from that I kinda feel sorry for the Gr. 12's. After programming I'd see all these signs pinned up all over the school begging 9ers and 10's to sell their semi tickets to gr 12's. Some were willing to pay 50 bux. If I were a gr. 10 w/ a ticket I'd  have sold mine. Just for the fact that I can still go next year, but they can't. They'll be @ the charity ball @ UWO maybe, or w/e other universities have. But yeah if I could make a difference, I would have.  Well after school we WERE gonna session but Spencer and Igor had to work out, so me and Steve ended up leaving. Well I worked on millz for a bit, and we tried to see who could connect the most freezes. Our record was 3...or maybe 4. Steve did some combo like table top, to chair, airchair, and then......well I guess it's 3 lol. I don't know what he coulda done from air chair.  Anyways, got home, played some SC, then went to McGuiness landing, and dropping off Marcello's b-day present and saying happy birthday. HOLY CRAP the burgers at McGuiness are GOOD. I couldn't really finish mine, but it was AMAZING. I wanna go there again lol. And their milkshakes are amazing too.  But yeah now I'm sitting here, blogging, and doin h/w. Gotta sleep for tomorrow. Tired. Cya.

       2/10/04   ONE MORE WEEK TILL HUNTSVILLE! YAY! And a month or so until TC   You can tell when I start to run out of blog titles lol. Coming up with titles like ONLY THIS AMOUNT OF TIME LEFT UNTIL THIS HAPPENS! But anyways........it won't stop me from blogging about my day =P. So Start reading!  This morning I woke up late.......so I only had 15 mins to get ready. Ate quickly got dressed brushed teeth n stuff then ran out the door. Patrick's car was waiting on my driveway....hinting that I'm late. Crap. Oh well we still got to school on time at least. He was asking me about what semi was like last year for the ride to school. Obviously semi was really fun. But yeah got to school perfectly on time....5 min bell JUST rang.  So yeah just made it into history on time. One of the guidance councellors came in and talked about how basically the descisions we make this year affect us a lot. Could almost screw your life over. Great message.  But yeah after being lectured about how to not be a hobo, came the rest of history class. We learned about the depression 30's still. NOthing exciting. Found out test is on 24th. Whoo. Not a WHOO! a Whoo. Sarcasm. Then announcements came on and then there was the 5 min interlude where I sit in the same room and wait for civics class to come in.  While sitting there.......I actually almost fell asleep. 5 mins can get PRETTY boring. I woke up when Hammond punched me. And then civics came along. Me and Dave spent half the time staring at Hammond's Palm Pilot thing while he was playing Jawbreaker or sometin *kinda like collapse* and took some notes down about Governments. And I'm even falling asleep from writing this part of blog because civics can get REALLY boring. Being in the same classrom 2 periods in a row ISN'T FUN. Also I have the same teacher. Least Jason sees a different face. Well yeah after that came lunch.  Lunch we headed to Galleria. At first I was gonna get Subway but then switched to BK. Need Coffee so I won't get bored in math. Thompson got a free refill from my double cup....wee we scammed BK today! I feel special =P. The downside of free refills....customers abuse it ^_^. Me and Nate would ditch Mike and Thompson for a bit....but they caught up. Lol then Nate used Mitch's Joke on Thompson *He's American:*  Nate: Hey Thompson stick out your arm *Thompson sticks out arm* *Nate hits it* Thompson: Wth? you hit me. Nate: Just trying to match your wrist skin colour w/ your neck's.  If you didn't get that joke.....UR CUT. I even gave it away at the beginning. But yeah I was sorta thinkin "Wow I just told you that joke from Mitch." What a biter lol. Afterwards I forgot why.......but randomly Nate pushed Thompson into the snow. The score: Nathan 4, Thompson 1. Nathan as you can see is killing Thompson in this season's throwing each other into the snow competition. Anyways....back to school now. O0o0o0o Matchmakers came out today. Bought mine....results are kinda the same as last year.....although my best friends list is sorta weird. Best friends w/ Arjun and Christian? I barely know em lol. And apparently I bubbled in my bday wrong. I bubbled in Dec. 10 instead of Oct. 12. Whoops =P.  Math class we had some old hag teach us. UGH SHE WAS SO BORING. And annoying. We couldn't do anything with her watching us. We make a peep and she'd walk over and stare at you and the people around you for 20 minutes. So yeah I didn't get much work done. Also most of the time we just spent exchanging matchmakers and looking at each other's. Also I spent half the time filling out my Central form, and talking to Nick about music. Least no H/w ^_^  Programming was usual. Played some games w/ Alex and then started my final project sorta. Still brainstorming an idea. Breakdancing or NHL? Maybe a car company. At first I WAS gonna do Music. Trance, Dance, etc. and their artists w/ mp3's in background but apparently Mr. Dayus doesn't want our files to be too big. Doesn't wanna overload the school's hard drives. So I am still thinking up what to do.  After school no sessionin today. Just went home.  Played drums, SC, then drums again. Now I'm doing blog, eating, and gonna soon start h/w. Gotta sleep early tonight for band 2morrow. Later.

       2/9/04   Bah....another Monday Gone.   Well once again another Monday has come and gone by. Today wasn't really that much more exciting than any other Monday. It was you know.........average.  today I actually decided to wake up early.....7am! GAH THE SUN ISN'T EVEN OUT YET! But yeah I decided to wake up early for once. Maybe I won't be late getting out of the door. But anywho this morning I had fried rice *mmmmm* and then did the rest of morning routine and headed out the door. Perfect timing. Patrick's car was just leaving and I make it ^_^.  For one we actually got to school before 8. I think anyways. Well actually I think we got there only 2 minutes earlier than 8:10 cuz I heard bell go right off after I went in. Now I head to music class.  REALLY boring today. Meaghan was actually early for once though. Wow. Me and her chatted for a bit about Friday night still. Basement Jam....pretty hard to forget. I remember it better than factoring in math. But yeah apparently her church watched the clips from the night *a lot of people recorded* and it was Phenomenal. But yeah that conversation was cut short when class started. Mr. mcCumber seems to be pretty peeved about anyone that makes a peep in class *other than instruments.*  For half the class we listened to some Fugue. Wow.....it served no purpose whatsoever. We were supposed to play a Fugue today *2nd half to Prelude and Fugue* but in the end we didn't have enough time because saxophones seem to not understand that you have to blow into your instrument to make sound. Now don't get me wrong if you're some sax person at Central....but the ones in my class *except for Bradburn he seems to be able to do something* ALL CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING. Sorry but it's kinda true =P. Well like usual we played and played. Mr. McCumber today didn't get PMS. Then came announcements, and time for science *shudder.*  Science like usual took notes and sorta fell asleep. Don't remember much else. Oh yeah we started physics. Whoo.  YAY LUNCH! Today I finally convinced Mophead *Thompson* and Nate to go to Jasper's. Unfortunately Thompson hates it already cuz he got the same thing I got  *Chicken Salad Wrap which I like* and Nate just sat there doing his math h/w, then ate his lunchables lol. I dunno why but at lunch I started thinking again whether I should head to semi formal or not. I REALLY wanna get windmills.....maybe if luck gives me a smack in the face I can get em @ semi =P. Then again I'm not in the mood to ruin my suit by doing millz. If I could anyways. Lunch was probably my best time to do thinking today. Didn't have coffee to amuse me till I left cuz I decided to buy one then. But yeah today I did LOTS of thinking...  Like at the moment right now *well a few minutes back* I was thinking back on Sunday after I read Josh's blog (http://counterbalance.seventimes.net). His entry for Sunday is REALLY meaningful so I urge you people to go to it. But it really made me reflect on my Christian walk. Btw No I wasn't thinking about this in Jasper's if you're slow. But yeah I dunno why but it really made me think about my Christian walk. It also made me think of the book Left Behind. The whole thing about "who's going to go to heaven and who won't." I guess being a Christian may have you wonder sometimes whether you go to heaven or not but that shouldn't be the right emotion. I figure if you really are a Christian you KNOW that you are going to go to heaven. So why worry? Well with so many influences in this world.....why wouldn't you? I guess this is where prayer comes in, and just doing whatever is needed to improve your relatioship w/ God and secure yourself a place in heaven, which Connie yesterday depicted it as a "party" where all your friends are invited....so obviously you want to go too. But the only condition is.....you must follow God's way. Yeah I was thinking about this and this is what stopped me for a while today.  Well just think about that. And now back to my day. I'll make this fast.  Bio.......did notes. Doing a test soon. See my day 2's REALLY suck. Yes once again Ms. Wiener made fun of me because I'm somewhat slow. Mainly cuz her class is pretty boring and I zone out A LOT. Well nothing special today. Took up some h/w and now to English.  BORING. ROMEO AND JULIET=BORING. And to after school.  Stage Band X: WE ARE IMPROVING! Today I could actually make out the melody in Shark Bait, and our below Mediocre drummer jake actually completed a fill CORRECTLY! NO WAY! It was actually pretty fun. I got to play Lindsay Brown's Sax solo *though I play the trombone* in Rio Estate. I made up a bunch of notes....did some whale noises, and POOF! That was the solo. VERY amusing lol. It was actually pretty fun today and we are starting to sound good.  Well after Stage Band instead of going home.......I met up w/ Spencer, Igor, and Dan to session. We sessioned for about 45 minutes then left. Enough time for me to do a few hops and rollback into forearms. Tomorrow if I session: WINDMILLS.....LOTS OF THEM! If I can lol. Well anyways yeah Spencer had to leave pretty early and Igor left about the same time as me and Dan. Girl named Cassandra stopped by. Dunno what grade she's in if I'm not wrong I heard she's in gr. 10. But yeah I remember her from the talent show. She choreographed her own dance routine to Outkast's B.O.B. If you don't know what song that is....chances are you're either REALLY stupid or you REALLY deppreciate music.  Anyways I got home.....did some h/w, played SC, read some blogs. And now for math homework. Later. *Plunk*

       2/8/04   Usual Sunday....Plus LOTS of TV   Today started off normal like usual. Woke up around 8:20, did my hair, ate then left. Picked up Jason around hmm.....8:50ish? Least I wasn't late this time =P. Well we finally got to church around 8:50 or so........yay another thing we weren't late for! Hmm......well looking at my hair again in a mirror....wow it really was weird. Looked pretty messy. But I liked it. I hate taking time and making every hair straight, even though my head kinda looked like a nest lol. Meh, not like I really care. Anyways I helped Rebecca usher for a bit before we headed into the worship. While ushering I started to be amused by stupid things *like usual* and started to have a staring contest w/ a Christmas ball. Smart kid eh=P? Well after that intense competition *it was a tie obviously* we headed into the sanctuary for worship. Kinda interesting today. 4 singers and one instrument. Very Unique.  After that....well we had a word of prayer and then the sermon. Pastor Mackness today was speaking about "True Righteousness." Scripture was from Phillipians 3 3-9. It wasn't TOO bad of a sermon. Some parts of it didn't really go through my head....but I got the main point about how things that the world tell us to do may not be what God wants us to do.  But yeah after a song of response and offering *Gloria almost forgot she was ushering* and then we all headed downstairs like usual for chatting. Well Connie WAS supposed to teach us today......but for some reason she wasn't there. Turns out she woke up late and forgot to get a ride from someone.....so Brian went to pick her up.  She arrived about 10 minutes late. Had a lesson though at least. She won this thing from 105.9 *it's not up yet but this early bird thing* anyways yeah we had a different approach to a lesson today. We had a song......."I can only imagine" and from that song we did a lesson. Coincedentially we were also doing Phillipians 3. lol. Well Connie sure knew how to get a group of teens to pay attention. Bribery. What could she do w/out it? Oreos+ Ketchup Chips. Mmmm..........food. Well yeah we had some laughs, and got the lesson done and over with. Kinda reminded me of HYPE back in the old days.  Well anyways after that I stayed down with some people to set up tables and chairs for the food afterwards, and the others went up for Communion. After I finished setting up the stuff I went upstairs also, but by the time I got there it was basically over. Anyways long story short we ate then Jason came over.  To summarize the afternoon.........LOTS of NFL street lol. Well after a while I decided to check out what's on TV. CRAP MISSED NHL ALL STAR GAME. Well caught 3rd period. Amazed of how East won. Dang. Then we played some more NFL street and then Jason had to go home. 7pm-whenever....TV TIME!  Well anyways yeah, I'm now watching some of the Pro Bowl and Grammy's at the same time. So have fun reading more of my blog.....or go watch TV. later.

       2/7/04   Another Joe Saturday.   After a nice 8 hour sleep *below Saturday standard* I was awake at 11....tired, cranky, unstable. I was pretty tired still from yesterday. The side effects of Basement Jam. I had dreams of breaking, and in the morning I could still remember being burned by Futonics. I feel special, the whole "yay I got burned by a good crew!" thing, yup it's still fresh in my mind. But yeah once I woke up I remembered...piano lessons today *shudder.* So yeah from 11-12:30 MAD PRACTICING. Then at 1230 I left for piano lessons. Well piano lessons actually start at 1230 but I only live like 2 mins away....not like that will affect anything =P. Also I kinda left a bit late cuz my mom was complaining about sometin....meh.  But yeah....piano lessons went sorta ok. My planner book thing was a defect *like all the others* and had not enough pages so Mrs. Mitsis took all of em back and is sending them back to Business Depot for fixing. I also officially found out.....I'm not doing exam in June. Well probably not unless I start cramming like heck during the week for practicing. I average 27 mins a day in gr. 8 piano =P. Well at least I play my pieces well she said. I just hate Gr. 8 technique. Well at 1pm I finished, and well I had to go photocopy some stuff....somethin I shoulda d one 2 weeks ago.  Anyways when I got home.........ran straight to drums. I had a real urge to start drummin'. Yeah so I started doing that for around...............30 minutes? Then I sat on comp for a bit, talked on MSN....and @ 3 I headed out to session @ ucc.  Didn't really accomplish much. Millz are still stuck at linking two inconsistently, and normally it's PRETTY UGLY. I can do rollbacks better now...hmm....not much else. There was still a lot of talk about Basement Jam. Everyone still remembered how me and Calvin got burned by Futonics. Reaction when the dude picked out the name:  Host: And the first battlin' crews will be chosen from this random hat of randomness......*picks out paper* Joe and Calvin vs.....  People around us: o0o0o0o0o Joe and Calvin are FIRST UP (These people bein Stefan, Sergei, etc.)  Host: *picks out another piece of paper * FUTONICS  Me: Who are they?  Everyone else: (big O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O) Well....one thing to say "good luck guys."  lol I still remember that moment. But mostly there was HUGE talk about the Albino Zebras Vs. Crazy Ghost crew battle. Read more about it in yesterday's blog. But yeah basically that was the highlight of the night. Anyways other than that not much else happened. No friendly battles or anything today. I basically just improved on rollbacks into forearm and some footwork. Trying to incorporate a hat in. I really gotta boost my creativity skills up =P. Speaking of skills/talents it was kinda interesting how my fellowship will tie into this. But anyways before that comes I left from UCC around 5 and started walking home *ugh.*  Well on my way home, I called some people lol. Carmen, Jason, Josh. It gets pretty boring walking home....so meh when you have a cellphone........a whole new horizon looms=P. So yeah did that till I got home....and then basically got ready for HYPE. I was in my house for a total of like 6 hours today lol.  Well off to HYPE. While going there we almost forgot to pick up Jason lol. But we remembered in the end. Got him then quickly drove to Gavin's. They already started so yeah we were late lol. Not the latest though Carmen came 15 mins after. But today was different form of HYPE. We incorporated some of the issues brought up at the meeting. For example.....we started off w/ some praise songs. Trading my sorrows, the song that goes "From the ends of the earth *echo* from the depths of the sea *echo* from the heights of the heavens *echo* Your name be praised" that is the first verse. And then we went into the study for today. Ali first asked us....what are our talents? Lots of stuff was thrown in. Patient, Perfectionist, lots of people are music freaks *including me.....music can't live without it =P,* teaching, competitive, etc. Oh yeah and History Buff *Me* =P lol. In the end Ali wrote em all down...and would then lead us into the lesson. Today's topic was about Spiritual gifts, Spiritual Fruits and talents, and how they are all different. Also we talked a little bit about skills when I brought the word into the lesson. Well in the end we would all agree *since I made a HUGE debate on this lol* that Spiritual Fruits lead to Spiritual Gifts, and Spiritual Gifts lead to Spiritual Fruits. Talent is just what we particularly excel at. But yeah the lesson I liked a lot. I talked a lot in this lesson. I really felt pumped for the lesson *yeah I know it sounds weird  but it's true lol.* Also Kendrick suggested I read Proverbs 24:17-18, and I really suggest it for everyone who is competitive and likes to rub victories in other people's faces. This verse really hit me....and I'm really thankful that Kendrick showed me the verse. Tonight though I really felt God's presence at the HYPE meeting. Not as much screwing around, and lots of good talk coming out of all of us. I really think that God is doing something with this fellowship, which I TRULY praise him for. This is some of the best spiritual growth I've seen happen at my church in years. I really hope that when the HYPErs now get spiritually mature enough to be councellors that we can make as big as an impact as the current counsellors have done.  Anyways after the lesson, we closed in prayer and then headed to the food table. I went to check out Gavin's new comp, and it was one I saw in the papers. It's not bad. It even has 64MB integrated video card. Well yeah I left early because dad got there on time. Took Jason home, and Ali also. And yeah now I'm home bloggin.  Well anyways I got not much else to say. I'd just like to end w/ Proverbs 24:17-18. I mean this verse really applies to my personality, and I'm really gonna start to try to change myself to act more like the verse tells you to. Well here it is. I hope you people find this verse as meaningful as I did:    "17 Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when he stumbles, do not let your heart rejoice, 18 or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him."    -Proverbs 24:17-18   Well I'm out. Later.

       2/6/04   BASEMENT JAM 2004.....FRIGGIN AMAZING   Ok today's entry I'm just going to skip right until after school. I have better things to talk about today than how history class went, or how math went etc. Well anyways yeah most of this post is gonna be about Basement Jam....which was REALLY good.  Ok.....to summarize my early day. Woke up, went to school, history. Then Civics. Oh yeah our triple alliance killed the other villages ^_^. Math class we horsed around and took up this worksheet. Programming played some literati on yahoo. Oh yeah turns out Icy really does have braces. For overbite? Meh if it's really that important then I guess it's worth it. Well anyways after school, met up w/ Igor and Dan for a after school session. Turns out  Jason said he wants to come to Basement Jam too. Meh more business and it is for a good cause *and it was REALLY worth it.*  The session lasted around an hour and a half. Didn't really hit much. Just kinda fooled around, tried some new stuff, worked mostly on footwork. I really wanna start sessionin more often after school. Somethin to do. And it's benefiting me somehow too. I get better at breaking =P. Jalessa came for a bit to watch, and this other white kid did too in gr.9. Well we sessioned for a bit before we went to Stobie's, and then Igor went back to school to meet w/ Steve and me, Dan and Jason went to the bus stop to bus to my house. On my way home I just hoped that Calvin didn't ditch the main plan again like he did at Paramount.  Well got home, and Calvin called *WHEW.* Turns out he IS coming *good* and he was gonna be at my house any minute. Well I played Silent Hill 3 for a bit. Gets more and more twisted. Some person was locked up in a locker trying to claw its way through at me. Lucky it was behind glass. Then I go into a room and all of a sudden the  room starts to be covered in blood and my reflection freezes and gets covered in blood. Well then we played some DDR *controller since my pad is BOKAN!* It was decent I guess. Beat Dan ONCE! lol. Calvin then came, and we all ate then jetted for Basement Jam.  We were PERFECTLY on time. Signed up.....BUT FORGOT TO SIGN UP AS TOFU SUPERIOR! So we went in as Calvin/Joe lol. Amazed at how many people were there. There was probably somewhere around 100 people in there. A lot of people showed up. Saw lots of familiar faces from UCC. Well we started breakin around at the beginning for about 30 minutes to warm up. I just stretched and then did my common stuff. Forearm freeze, elbow, pikes, airchair. I then did a few turtles. They were pretty smooth I was surprised. Talked to some people, see who we were gonna battle. I was surprised to see how many people I knew were there. Also how I somehow bumped into Lindsay Brown and Meaghan Tanner there. They're real cool kids though. I was just REAL surprised that they were there lol. In the end I think there were 10 of us from Central. Wow. Also saw Tori *haven't seen her since Gr.9* and of course the UCC people. Apparently me and Calvin were pretty much the crappiest crew there.......so yeah everyone was hoping they'd battle us first lol. Well in the end.......we ended up battling first. Calvin/Joe vs................FUTONICS. WTH!? Wow just our luck. WE get pitted against one of the finest crews in London. Obvious what the outcome was. We lost =P. I was actually pretty happy w/ my round though. I pulled off crickets fairly well and a decent elbow freeze. Calvin pulled nice crickets too, and some freezes. But in the end like I said we lost to Futonics. I'm not surprised. Other people that got knocked out first round included lots of people that go to UCC usually on Fridays and Stefan/Igor also got knocked out first round I think. One team got a buy though... Well now round two *DING*  ROUND TWO WAS FULL OF CRAZY STUFF. But throughout the breaking, not a whole lot of power. But LOTS of style and freezes. It really shows how power isn't necessary to win a battle, and it's mostly about style. But Crazy Ghosts (SICK crew) shoulda made it a A LOT further. They somehow got knocked out by Albino and Futonics which was total crap. But anyways the main point is there were lots of good battles, and I really thought that paying 5 bux for this......was DEFINITELY worth it.  Well now we had an intermission before we went onto semi and finals. Well we had an open circle, but in the end it turned out to be....the most outrageous battle in the whole competition. CRAZYGHOST CREW VS. ALBINO ZEBRA & FUTONICS. IT WAS CRAZY! Halos, flares, elbow airflares, EVERYTHING was included in this smorgasboard of moves and style. Movie You got Served....who needs to pay 10 bux for a crap movie with a sappy storyline when you can see actual local breakers dukin it out for 5 bux and has no storyline.......just the forever grudge held between these two crews *CGC and Albino.* Highlights of battle? Wei pulled elbow airflares and Halo. Albino Zebras had REALLY nice footwork. But Wei's bro FUFu *right* would pull off the SICKEST headspins I've ever seen. Then this one other guy.....forgot his name but he was one of the judges, stormed in and shut down Albino w/ PURE STYLE & FREEZES. But Futonics and Albino did put up a good fight. But I think CGC whooped their asses. Yeah that would be a HUGE highlight.....and also another battle coming up next...where this one guys does the most outrageous move ever.  Well now it was 2nd part of the Jam. Semi finals and Finals.  Unfortunately by now all the people that are around my age (Mike, Sergei, Stefan, Igor, Steve, Will, Calvin, Lance, The guy w/ Mike forgot his name) got eliminated. Me/Calvin and Mike and the other guy got eliminated round 1. However Sergei/Lance and Steve/Will made it to round two. Sergei and Lance put up a REAL good fight with a routine....but the other crew responded with another routine of this guy controlling the other guy breakin' basically. Nice style. And Will and Steve got burned by I think one of the Albino crews *they were split into two since they were 2 man battles.* But Semi finals and finals were the HUGE highlights. This was basically where all the remaining crews pulled out the big guns. Huge style, mad combos.  In the semi finals.....this one guy pulled off the BIGGEST combo ever. He started off doing crickets and then did some other move like a spinning air baby or sometin and his hat flew off. LANDED BACK ON HIS HEAD. LIke it was set up. Then he started milling putting a touque through his legs. After about 8 rounds of that his crew member throws him a water bottle and he does another 5-8 rounds of millz. Then he actually DRINKS THROUGH THE BOTTLE in a freeze. I was TOTALLY mesmerized by that. UGH IF ONLY I HAD MY DCAM. IT WAS SO SICK. I honestly liked the 3rd place battle more than the 1st. The other guy pulled off mad top rock and footwork. I think those two crews deserve to go to finals for 1st and 2nd. The 1st vs. 2nd place battle was between the two Albino crews, with LOTS of popping and toprock. That was why I really liked it also. Oh there was a lot of sick combos, but I can't describe em. Lots of windmills and flares. And footwork was unbelievable.  Well the crews eliminated did get bumper stickers lol. The First place Cash prize was 130 and 2nd was 50. There were also prizes for hats n' T-shirts. Steve got a hat. Lucky Kid.  Anyways.....right now I'm very tired.....and wanna sleep. But Basement Jam 2004....totally unforgettable. And I strongly urge people to...........   GO TO BASEMENT JAM 2005  If there is one that is. You'll be mesmerized by what happens. Jason was even surprised how crazy breakin' could get. After seein that though.......sessioning is now on like #1 priority 2morrow...er #2 under piano lol. But yeah I'm sessionin for sure 2morrow. Don't wanna lose rollback forearm or my crickets. Keep workin on em. Well I'm out.....so yeah I'll talk to you people later. Cya.

       2/5/04   Stressed out day...two tests, some other crap, and then stuff.   Well out of most of the stuff that happened today....least it's good to know I've influenced another person to blog lol. Kurtis PK (http://kurtispk.blogspot.com) I think is the 4th person I've got to start blogging. There's Jason, Josh, Rebecca, Theresa and Kurtis. Wonder who else is gonna start blogging now. Anyways enough of saying who else blogs, if you wanna see that GO TO MY SITE AND CLICK ON THE LINKS. And now for the rest of my day.  By now I think you all know what my morning routine is....you know the usual stuff. Hygiene, eat, get dressed, out the door I go.  School hasn't been to great lately. SO BORING. Gr. 9 was way more exciting. Well anyways in music we basically just played music like usual. Hmm...oh yeah got theory test back. 96%.  I think that's what it is (106/110 just cuz I wrote B major instead of B flat major). Well that's basically the highlights of music. It's really lame. Hope mrs. Wharton comes back soon. All these sub teachers are REALLY boring.  Well after announcements it's time to go to science.  TEST! Weather test. So dumb, but at least it was open book. I got most of the stuff done in a bout 30 mins or so, really short test. After that our class then watched a video on El Nino the hurricane.  Then lunch. Well basically @ lunch today I had to study for bio. Bio isn't really that appealing when Ms. Wiener gives you a test about the crap we've done since September. A LOT of us were studying today. Tehmina, Rachel, Underhill, Okanski, Drew, Tanis, like I said a lot of us. I talked to Brescia at lunch a lot, since I went over and sat with her for most of lunch. Did a lot of studying too. She had some calculus stuff and I had my crap test for bio. Yeah today's lunch really sucked ended up studying. I didn't eat anything...so by the time I got home I WAS STARVING. But that's later right now it's time to face my stupid bio test.  Wow....I walk in the room and instead of the high pitched voice of Ms. Wiener I heard...I saw the evil Grin of Mr. Curphey. WTH I THOUGHT I WAS DONE AND OVER WITH THAT TEACHER 2ND PERIOD! Nope. Apparently HE'S SUPERVISING OUR TEST. After a awhile though Mr. Pigeon came though and supervised.IT was hard. Sorta. I kinda forgot a calculator so doing the time spent in each phase in mitosis was kinda hard so I just guessed for most of it. Then I got lazy and decided not to do the Punnett square for this huge ass question where you gotta draw one of those HUGE punnett squares. I don't even kno why the hell we have to do that stuff. it's pretty useless. I mean I can figure this crap out just from process of elimination. Genetics is the biggest joke in biology. Most of it was pretty ez actually when I think about it, the only hard question was the one about  time spent in different cell division phases. Oh yeah and a few multi choice too, but wasn't too worried about that. And now to english.  Boring. Talked about marriage cuz we started Romeo and Juliet. Hmm....yeah that's basically it. Read some of Left Behind, the book I'm reading. It's getting pretty good actually so far. I won't spoil the book but basically it's about what happens in Armegeddon *when God comes to this world, Judgement day, you know?* and a lot of people disappear (God comes back for his people.) Then the rest of the people in the world are either poor Christians, other religion people and of course Atheists. It tells about how different people react to it in different ways. Like to a news reporter, this thing is the jackpot. But to one Christian who was "Left Behind," he couldn't understand the fact that he didn't go to heaven and killed himself. Anyways you should read the book if you haven't. It's really good, though I wouldn't recommend the movie.  Now I'm going home. Bused w/ Stefan, then transferred on to Wonderland. Got home around.......2:45ish? Surprisingly early. Well mom wasn't home, so I had to get the key's from my grandma *she lives across the street.* Got open the front door and since I didn't eat lunch......cleared out the fridge. Chips, carrots, chocolate, bread, cookies...anything I could find. FOod.........mmmm. After eating I went onto comp, checked msn, and then decided to go to sleep when I then thought I'd call up Jason Josh Adrian and Gavin for some SC. We eventually played almost an hour later *I ate more* and we played until 6 where then I had to leave for my eye doctor appointment.  It actually didn't go that bad. And no waiting this time. Right on schedule. Well apparently my eyes have kinda got better *no more dry eye syndrome if you know what that is* but I didn't get prescription. She said my eyes were like overworked or sometin. *shrug*. Well I have to make another appointment now. Meh, I don't really mind I just wanna find out how my eyes are doing now. Least I don't have glacoma or anything =P. Yet.   Well basically got home, ate, and now I'm blogging. Yeah today was kinda boring, Sc was fun *we creamed gavin in a 3vs.1 Triple J beatdown. * Triple J being Joe Jason and Josh. Adrian kinda left because he was bored. Not much else. Oh yeah talked to Jason about buying comps cuz he's planning to annoy his parents for one. Convinced him to think about clones instead of off the shelves. But I do think that it was by God's Grace today that my eye appointment went fairly well. Kinda interesting. Last Sunday we learned about how God's grace is great, and now it's applying to me. Coincedence? I think not. Not exactly predestination either. Hmm...yeah the way I think of it I took the route. But I'm not about to explain how I think God guides us. REALLY long and......well I may be the only person that understands my own thoughts. Obviously. But yeah it's good at least my eye doctor didn't just go "oh you have this prescription now." Least she told the truth and won't just rip off her patients. That's a good thing to see in a doctor of any sort. Well anyways I'm out now....gonna go sleep really tired. Later.

       2/4/04   Course Selection day drawing near....Football Banquet *highlights of the day*   So far my day has gone average like usual. Hmm....yeah very average. Oh yeah I did have band today. I really don't like how I had to wake up at 6:30 am rather than my reguar 7:30 am. But band wasn't too bad today.  I woke up around my usual 6:30 for a Wednesday. Ugh stupid band. Well I did my average morning routine...you know eat, get dressed, brushed teeth...the usual. Well after that I finally got out the door around 6:50 with my cup of tea and headed for school.  Band....only about 40 of us I think. There were only 3/5 trombone people, and most of our clarinets were non-existent. The only section that had everyone was percussion. We played some songs, got yelled at, and then we were done. See isn't that painful. Kinda tiring though. But meh I'm gonna be taking this course all the way till I graduate. It's mandatory w/ music. Oh well anyways now that music's over....time to head to history.  Well while walking there I stopped by tech room to see what my final was in careers. 82!!!!! It's actually DECENT. Brought my mark up from a 72. YAY! But now I'm dying in english. probably have a 72 or something.  Well now to History class. Wow REALLY boring today. Actually it was kinda fun. We had a Stock Market simulating game. It was simulating the stock market crash. Now knowing me I'm somewhat paranoid, so I bought my shares @ 1 dollar each then sold them all when it only went up to 8. Eventually the stock hit 68. Wow I coulda made 13,600 but NOOOO I sold mine early and made only 1100 bux. Well at the end I wasn't the poorest at least. Anyways that basically took up most of my day in history. Then came announcements. More semi advertising. It really is getting tempting to go.  Well after History came.....CIVICS. *shudder.* Same room, same teacher. Meh. At least I know more of the people in this class. Well anyways first thing we did in civics.....was go to the course selection assembly.  It was like last year's basically. Got course selection booklet, application form, etc etc. Heard a lecture from Guidance counsellors. Well I'm actually really concerned about selecting courses this year, seeing I only got two more years in high school. Time REALLY flies. So yeah I'm really gonna be asking for God's guidance in this. Well yeah after that it was back to civics. We played this game where we were spit into "villages." The area had a shortage of water, and we had to come up with a solution. It could be anything. War, peace, combining villages, anything. So far my group wants to ally w/ 2 medium sized groups to kill the big group. Well planned Hammond lol.  Now for lunch. I went to BK w/ Thompson and nate. Mike didn't come and neither did Hermann. H/w. Well I had coffee and fries w/ gravy. Thompson and Nate had whoppers and fries. Whoo. Oh yeah Thompson got a coffee too. It really is waking me up though for afternoon.  Well anyways now to math. Didn't do much. Did some worksheet and talked a lot. Mr Gilbert really seems like your typical new teacher. He doesn't know what he's doing sometimes it seems lol.  Well now to programming. Not much here either. Finished an assignment on Hyperstudio *really retarted program, refer to one of Jason's blog entries in January* and then surfed the net. That's basically my afternoon.  Well bell rang, but since football banquet was tonight I stayed there until 5. Spencer and Igor WERE gonna session but NOOO not anymore. So I ended up working out w/ Hammond n Mitch and them, and then after a bout a 1 and a half hour workout we watched the highlights of Superbowl 37 and how the Bucs got there and won. Well at around 5 we all ran to the caf. FOOD!  Food was REALLY GOOD. We had Caesar Sald and this unidentified salad *I think it's Greek* but no one took any. And then there was REALLY good pasta, meatballs *mmmm* and of course the average Canadian Dinner roll. I had 3 helpings. REALLY GOOD. Then a speaker came from UWO. He was the CCH Defense coach at one point. I think he's the one that Patrick's dad said really sucks lol. Kinda funny how he's our "motivational" speaker,though Western this year was JUST over the .500 win mark. Worst season in a while. Well anyways after that I went home, finished some h/w, then to theory.  Won't talk much about theory. Did theory. Payed for Theory. Wrote Theory Exam Application form. Went home.  Now I gotta get going to finish Bio. Test tomorrow. Ugh. Later.

       2/3/04   Meh.....Ok Day I guess....1st day 2 back from exams   Basically today I got a lot of crap back. I got science, music, and english exams back. Also today after school I had my first session *bboying not smoking up lol.* It was ok @ school. Mr. Harris *I think that's him* walked by and told us about how back in the 80's that there were actually school competitions across the city....wow I wish that was back up and running. Anyways before I rant anymore about the later part of my day let me summarize....sorta the first part. Now I know my entries are long....so from now on when you read my entry....either have LOTS of food with you.......or have LOTS OF TIME. Or both ^_^. Wow what a strategy there....  Anyways my day started like a usual day. Woke up a round 7:30. Ate, morning routine, and then headed out   the door for another day of....school. Whoo. Ugh only two more years of this crap...then University. Not that I don't have to wake up then, but I might have afternoon classes =P. WHEE! Anywho.....back to the story....er day summarizing thing...  Now I'm sitting in music class. Played some technique, songs, and then......GOT MY EXAM MARK! 84%! AMAZING! Well not as amazing as last year but better than I thought I'd get. I thought I'd get something in the 60's. Finlan got a 65. 2nd year in a row lol.  Not much happened in class. Thompson and I were yelling across the classroom as usual, and as usual I got kicked out of the percussion section. And the announcements came on. Hmm......lots of advertising for Semi....kinda does make me wanna go. Stupid propaganda. It works though. Well I still have another week to think about it so I don't have to worry much.  Well now trudging to science.... *trudge*  Now I'm sitting in science. Got my exam back. 83%.....on a good roll of exams! so far none of em have plummeted below 80. high of 91 (history) and low of 83 (science). Wee. Anyways we basically just went over weather test we are having on Thursday.........oh yeah IT'S OPEN BOOK! Turns out that Mr. Curphey isn't the cold-hearted grinch after all. He knows that when a subject's boring we don't pay attention, hence our head gathered no info. So we have an open book test on Thursday. Yay. And then Mr. Curphey was as usual lecturing us about random stuff and we watched a REAL lame video on tornadoes. And then came lunch. FINALLY.  Well Jason asked if I was gonna play ball. I said no because lunch beats starving until.....AUGH! RAIN! So I stayed in lol. Decided to go play some basketball after all with Jason and them in the gym lol. We sat there watching Gr.9 Intermurals first.....wow Melum's team kicked the crap outta the other team 23-8. Dunno bout other game. But wow the game on our side was pretty one-sided. Well we then got out the balls to play after bout 20 mins, and then shot around for about 5 before Dave and Jacob came. We had a 3v2 then. Me, Jason, and Dejan vs. Dave and Jacob. Unfortunately we lost. I had a crap game. Made like 3 shots lol. Jason I guess had an ok game, but Dejan was kicking ass. Stopped half the shots comin at us. He's really getting better at ball. Well after playing for  bout 30 mins it was time for 4th period.  Biology. It's not ALWAYS bad since Ms. Wiener is kinda funny. But sometimes she can lecture for 70 fulll minutes.....THAT's when it gets boring. Well today we got assignments back, talked about our test on Thursday *yes I have two tests on Thursday* plus a lab due for next day...the blood vessels one. Whoo. Not. Ugh. Oh yeah we also got our marks updated. 87 ^_^. Up from 85, up from 80. I really am thinkin' bout takin' science all through my high school career....and maybe one day be a Bio-Chem dude, instead of number-crunching in an office. Anyways that's for next week to decide, and of course this is definitely going on prayer list. Which reminds me I still haven't typed out the request list. But this week has been REALLY hectic....so this one's gonna be a late comer. Anyways now back to bio. We finished up lab, and I'm gonna be makin the good copy of it tomorrow. And of course study for the test.  Now off to english. I'll make this one quick. Reading, got 66% on exam, and 76% on animal farm test. Not bad. Except for the exam. And then I left.  Well I WAS gonna go home, but then Spencer found me in the halls and said him and Igor were gonna session. Meh why not? Just before Basement Jam on Friday sure. So I ended up staying there for an hour. Did some sessioning. Some people stopped by and watched. Mr. Harris was even surprised at us. He then said the thing about how in the 80's how there were citywide SCHOOL competitions. THAT IS COOL. He said he remembered it because his school *Clarke Road* won it one year. Wow if this could ever get up and running again that would be so cool. Central and Lucas probably would have the most breakers lol. Close competition probably too. But yeah it would be cool to see citywide competitions for breaking. I mean it's sorta almost a sport. Has more physical properties to it than say like..........golf. And Golf's a sport. And a Car. And then some people from some other school came to watch the b-ball game. Our school against some maroon-coloured school. Well I would then leave w/ Mike and Dan...oh yeah they came a bit later. Dan has a crapload of food in his locker, and Mike has REAL lame convo lines. They're also old too. ANYONE KNOW HOW TO SEW? CUZ I'M RIPPED!" Lmao haven't heard that one in ages. Then when we were walking home Dan said that Mrs. Howard called him a loser *lol* cuz he went up to her and said "Hey Mrs. Howard I might be suspended tomorrow." "Oh why?" "CUZ I BROUGHT MY GUNS TO SCHOOL!"*makes gun shape w/ fingers* "You're such a loser." Sad Dan just sad lol. Well we walked to Dundas and Richmond stop, where I took the Cherryhill, then transferred onto Whitehills.  Stopped by Adrian's house to see if he was still coming over. He had h/w. Meh.  So I went home....played some DDR *w/ controller shut up* and then played SC with Jason and Josh.  We had an ok game. Jason's online friend Sauron came along again too. We had Terran wars *all of us were Terran including comps.* Very chaotic. I almost died at beginning but for some reason the enemy then ran and fought Jason's army. So I rebuilt....eventually building a formidable landing force of marines. Well Josh and Sauron had taken down some comp, but then me Sauron and Jason made a HUGE landing on another comp. Gols, Tanks, Men, EVERYTHING. We killed that thing. Then we killed the other one. I came in last score wise but who cares =P. It's the fact I contributed in the war effort.  2nd game was hilarious. Though Sauron and Josh left, me and Jason played a team melee game. Funny as hell. Originally we started off with a regular defense, but  then for some reason we had an excess amount of gas and no minerals. So I decided to go on a scourge building frenzy. That got us low on gas and LOTS of minerals. 15,000:500 minerals:gas ratio lol. So then I wondered what took lots of minerals. Jason solved that problem. CANNON MASS BUILD!. So me and him started one of the BIGGEST cannon building projects ever lol. It was pretty effective. Eventually I abandoned his project and then I went on my own task. I massed whatever I can. Lings, Drones, Scourges, you name it lol. All of them were pretty funny. I even massed queens. Parasited everything I could. revealed half the map lol. Then I made a siege tank raid. Made a spacious landing area, then sent in defilers. These dudes would plague everything in the base until Jason's cannon building stretched from our base to the core of the enemy base. Lmao. That all took about 1:30 minutes. Funny as hell though. We won obviously. Built 750 buildings. And I saved the replay. THIS ONE HAS TO BE WORTH IT.  Anyways after that I ate, finished some h/w, then played DDR. Then I started blogging here. And Now I'm headed for bed. Tomorrow I got band plus a assembly to "guide" me through my course choices. Hope that goes well I really need direction in life right now. Prayer is the key. Talking to God hasn't and NEVER will fail.

       2/2/04   FIrst day back from exams.....grr.   Blah. And I was just getting settled into the no school life. Ugh now we are back into school. 2nd Semester isn't bright at all. Well actually it's the same thing since I'm in a non-semestered system but it's just that there was one change....I have civics in the same room I have history....BACK TO BACK. I'm stuck w/ Ms. Manson in the SAME ROOM for almost 3 hours. Ugh. This situation is so ugly....it looks like a Pontiac Aztek. Ok I know  that was lame....but it 's true. Today wasn't much more exciting than before. It's the average, usual, Central day....  After waking up sometime after 9am for 4 days in a row....came this dreaded morning where I had to wake up at 7:20. Ugh. It took me forever to trudge out of bed....AND IT WAS SO COLD THIS MORNING. Or maybe four comforter blankets is overkill. But soo warm............Anyways yeah I went downstairs, ate, and slowly got ready for school. Patrick came around at about 7:45 and we headed out the door for school around 7:50. Oh yeah and for those that wonder what I have for breakfast....I had fried rice today.  Well we got in the car.....talked bout yesterday's superbowl game mostly. I still can't believe that Valieteri *did I spell his name right?* made the 41 yard field goal. He missed a 30 somethin yard, and got one blocked, but he sure came through when the time came. Yesterday's game was pretty exciting. Of course I was also listening to the radio. Was switching between FM96 and Energy a lot. I've never really liked 106.9. Hmm......well the person that came to our church yesterday from GRACE FM sure was right. There is a lot of Christian music played on radio now without us knowing.  For example, the other morning I heard Stacie Orrico. This morning I would too. Except I actually tried to listen to the lyrics. To me it was saying about how there has to be something else in this world other than our average life, and that someone *God* is out there watching over us. I think it's a pretty meaningful song. The dance mix makes it better because i'm into dance more than soft rock =P. Well we got to school around 8:10...just made first bell. Worth it for sleep though.  History was pretty normal. We got exams back. 91%. Whoo hoo!. I can't fail history....i'm actually considering taking it again maybe next year.....just to bring my average up..............maybe i'll take like marketin or something in summer school. No wait....ugh but I need volunteer hours. Grr. Well I'll figure that out later. We also did some work on depression era, and Ms. Manson talked about Gr. 11 and 12 Social Science courses, since history was one. School propaganda...sorta. I heard that there is a course fair thing on Wednesday. Wow time really flies. I still remember in September when we were filed down to auditorium for that motivational speaker. He was pretty funny though. But yeah first period was REALLY boring, but at least the semester change is indicating.......ONLY 4 MONTHS OF SCHOOL LEFT. well sorta 5.  After 2nd period bell......I went to........NOWHERE! I'm stuck in the same room with the same teacher for three hours this semester! THIS REALLY SUCKS. Especially when you are being taught civics, the most pointless class EVER. Well least I know more people in this class. Our first task: we were given 250 imaginary dollars and asked to spend it on something for a classroom environment. After much deciding in our group *we were in groups of 4-5, Hammond, Pokan and Dave were in mine* we concluded we would buy 4 swivel chairs for ourselves. Productive.  Well after that boring class came lunch. I'll make this short. Hermann, me, John, Mike and Nate went out for lunch. We went to BK. I had coffee to fire up my senses for the rest of my day.  Came math. BORING. Neew seating plan. I sit by Nick Saika, Maggie, Mike, Kyla I think is the other girl's name, and sorta by Thompson still. He's a row away. Oh yeah Travis is kinda close too. Becky is also pretty close. We did a really dumb worksheet about Quadratics.  Programming nothing exciting. Catch up day so I basically surfed the net.  Last period bell rang. Time for Stage Band X Practice.  Oh yeah and now I'm getting real tired and wanna sleep so I'm gonna make the last part of my day short: -Came home -ate -played some piano -played Sc -Showered -Ate dinner  And now I go. Bye.

       2/1/04   PATRIOTS WIN! And Snow football is FUN   What a long LOOONG day. Though it was long, it was fun though. Starting with usual awakening at 8 for church and not coming home till 1130......I'm pretty beat right now. BUT IT WAS WORTH IT .............WELL WORTH IT=P.  I started off waking up at 8am...and then trudging out of the bed at around 8:20. Went downstairs and was met by a bowl of "joak" for breakfast. Meh, it wasn't that bad. And then after that I got ready for church. However I didn't have time to really do anything with my hair so I ended up going to church hoping my hat would squish my hair down. Nope that didn't happen, as I'd find out later. Anyways today my whole family went to LCAC instead of mom going to North Park, and we went to pick up Jason then head to the church.  Service wasn't bad. We had Reverend Daniel Tjoe-A-Long still *by the way in previous entry I think I got name wrong this is real name* and he spoke about how is grace amazing. He had a video from "Les Miserables" showing how the bishop showed grace to Jean Valjean by forgiving him for stealing from his house, and fought the urge to have him arrested. THAT actually takes a lot of willpower. Honestly for any average human your reaction would have been ARREST HIM. He also talked about how we have to always forgive, and try to always treat others in as best way as possible. He reffered to the bishop in "Les Miserables" a lot. Also at the end he had something for people to go up, I wasn't really sure what it was for which I feel kind of bad for but I didn't go up. Anyways after the message this person from Grace FM *New London Christian station 105.9FM for whoever would like to be ready for it* and basically told us how they are progressing so far. They have a survey to see what music should be played at one time. Their main outline is messages in the morning, then from afternoon to night it progressses from soft rock to heavy metal/ more modern stuff. They handed out a survey which I'm planning to take. Also I really hope that our church can really help with this station in establishing a solid foundation. I really would like to see a Christian station up playing modern music. I mean, FM96 already has started playing stuff like POD, Switchfoot, and a whole shabang of other bands that I don't know of but Gavin and Josh seem to. Also that Stacie Orrico person or sometin apparently is a Christian artist. I heard one of her songs on Energy FM, well the dance mix but since I like dance music it was good. Hmm maybe I will start to buy CD's now and not pirate as much =P.  Oh yeah also the English congregation was SURPRISINGLY larger than usual today. I think I could have counted at least 60 of us. I mean HYPE already accounts for approx. 15, then parents 5, then UWO kids 40, 2 pastors, and praise team. That's almost 60. I was REALLY surprised at the turnout of people today. It was nice to see though. I really hope that one day our English service can grow to that number as in permanent attenders, and of course go beyond. Oh yeah that brings up the other reason why I am 100% behind Grace FM. In their FAQ sheet, they brought out something that really hit me. In like the 200 churches or something in our London area, there are always empty pews. And as Christians of course we would like to see those pews filled with people. I think that this radio station will help in encouraging people to start attending church. Who knows maybe this station will bring some of our closest non-Christian friends to strong believers of Christ.  Well after service came the FINAL closing day of Job. We learned of how he finally at the end got everything he ever had back....DOUBLED. You can see both God's power and mercy from that action. It also shows how God is understanding. I mean Job was tested, and he was rewarded. Wouldn't you like a reward if you went through a hard test like Job? Well one thing that I brought up *also thanks to Josh for putting this into an analogy...*Ok well first Pastor Mackness asked us why God would bless Job with double....and my reply was that like Job got what he originally had, and God gave him a surplus as like a Thank You gift sorta, or like a reward. In the end what Josh would say is almost EXACTLY what I was trying to bring up. First Christians are soldiers in the battle of Heaven and Hell. And as a soldier, sometimes we get wounded, as Job did since he lost everything at one point. However, if the soldier survived the agonizing wound *as Job survived the poverty and suffering* the soldier is awarded with a medal *as Job was rewarded with his prizes.* I really liked that analogy. In fact this is gonna probably stick in my head for a LONG time. Which I hope it does. And it was really cool to see Jason so attentive in class. For 4 months of attending church he REALLY is accepting the message that God is giving him VERY well. Like Mike n' Dan have also been growing which I commend them for, but Jason has been taking this stuff in SURPRISINGLY quick. Like even Gavin took almost a year....but Jason really seems different. It's a good sign though. I think he'll be a strong follower in Christ in no time. Good job Jason and keep up the good work! And of course for the rest of the HYPE group I wish the same also but I really would like to commend Jason for intaking so much in 4 months so well.  Now that class was over, Pastor Mackness went upstairs to catch the last bit of Pastor Long's Cantonese service sermon *which was in English translated by a translator into Cantonese* and the rest of us just chatted for a bit. Josh and I would have to leave with Brian Kung as the HYPE councellors and the "Admin worker" *me* and whatever Josh's position name was *we agreed on "Relations Rep right??"* and we went to Angelo's got some food and then headed for Brian's place.  We talked about a LOT of stuff. One main thing we did was plan out the rest of HYPE until April. Another thing is we brought up issues and tried thinking of ways to resolve it. For example we figured to break the bubbles that we would for prayer groups split up the bubbles and get the people to be with different people....like rotating. Effective ^_^. We have now officially decided to add a worship part to our HYPE meetings also. We also touched on the issues we have that were mentioned in Emails, and will try to work them out throughout the year. Basically our goal is to administer more growth in our fellowship spiritually and physically, and also just to foster a comfortable environment for all Christians alike in our fellowship. We even have a theme song now *lol* and a theme verse: 1 Timothy 4:12 right? "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity." That's it....pretty meaningful even though I heard it's a pretty stereotypical verse for many fellowships. Meaningful though. Well yeah we got all that figured out and basically our schedule. Then we left for ACF  SNOW FOOTBALL and SUPERBOWL PARTY!^_^.  Snow Football is COLD but FUN. I couldn't feel my hands or feet, and scraped up legs pretty bad in ice but I don't care. I got two interceptions and that's all I care for lol. At first only me and Josh were the only kids from HYPe but Gavin and Jason pulled through and got there halfway through. Jason was complaining about how cold his feet were, and one guy suggested he put plastic bags in his shoes. My feet were getting pretty cold to so I thought "why not try it" lol. THEY WORK. Though my feet were still getting wet they were WARM. lol. Oh yeah and also my sock was turning sorta red from blood but meh. It was still A LOT of fun. Well anyways after that game *btw my team lost* we headed for the house we were chillin at for the Superbowl Party. Oh yeah and Jason is actually an AMAZING receiver too. Josh is decent at DB, and Gavin and I blitzed a lot near the end on D.  At the house we were at *I forgot who's but thanks for allowing over 30 people in there* we watched Superbowl on projector, and had 8 pizzas. MMMMMM. PIZZA. and also Pepsi, and other carbonated drinks. Wow I sound like a nerd. Anyways yeah. I basically lost my voice there....from yelling stupid stuff like "GET BETTER CLEATS" or "YOU'RE CUT YOU STUPID RECEIVER," "YOU CAN'T HIT LIKE THAT," "WTH!??!?!? HE MISSED THE KICK?! YOU'RE CUT!" Anyways the environment was filled with stuff like that.....until that one REALLY stupid PGA commercial where the dude was like picking out clothes for a woman. In unison around the whole house: WTH!?!?!?!? HUH!?!?!?!?!?!? LOL it was just funny seeing the unified reaction. Anyways after watching the close game, ending with a field goal from the Patriots, Gavin Josh Jason and I left in Brian's car for home. Brian would go back so I really thank him for taking us all home. Thanks man if you even read my blog=P.  Anyways I'm out. It's 1230 and I still have school tomorrow. First day of Civics. Whoo. Lates.

       3/31/04   Another month gone by....   Bah March is already over. How could I ever have thought time passed by slowly? I have no clue. But these last three months have been such a blur. And yes tomorrow will be the first day of April.....am I enthusiastic about it? NO. The only reason why I'd even like the month is because it marks the fact there's only two more months of school. Other than that....rain, worms, and work.....eew. At least Easter is during April ^_^. Hmm......but I'm happy March has gone by in a way. HUGE Bio seminar is finally over and  done, and my school average is at a healthy 85 ^_^. Shweet....so yeah March has been a good month.....and of course who could forget TC?! AMMMMMAAAAZZZZIIIINNNNNNGGGG. I just hope April will pass by as quickly as March....same for may.....and June.....then July and August......SLOW PLEAAAAAAASE.  Well this morning was Wednesday so another day of waking up really friggin' early. Yay....Intermediate band. Seems like such a joke after Senior Band just passed by on Tuesday. And I thought the music was a little bit difficult.....wow I can't wait until Gr. 11 next year. Music is actually amusing then hehe. Like usual....trombones sound good ^_^ and like usual Mr. Clark yells at woodwinds. Really the trombone/baritone section....really good section ^_^...  And after band music.....MORE MUSIC! Yes today was day two so I had music homeroom. Ran over music like usual....scales and such and then Mr. Clark took all the brass and we played some brass ensemble thing. So boring.....and we sound like crap lol. But Mr. Clark kept talking about how he gave Connor the lonely part so he'd suffer for all the trouble he causes in band lol. "Mr. Clark what have I ever done?" "Want me to give the list in order? *ehem* Talk to Kurtis, Listen to Kurtis, Talk back to Kurtis...." etc. etc. It's pretty funny though watching Mr. Clark seem to have this "master" plan. Oh yeah and Zavitz got these KILLER pair of shoes. THERE'S A STORY WRITTEN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOES. Now THAT's unique. So yeah that was basically the whole music class.....being split up and playing music. Fun.  Science..........MORE NOTES! Some cheesy poor-graphic animated video about VECTORS. Wow.......1980's animation was horrible lol. But it was funny watching it in the making haha.  Lunch.....went to Galleria. What?  Bio......................................wow the people that presented today for bio class.......whipped right through it. Their notes were up for about 3 seconds a time......and yeah writing down the notes.......NEAR TO IMPOSSIBLE. It was a pretty cool presentation though....was about digestive system. One of the group memebers apparently has had life experience with some of the things that they presented. So yeah that made it pretty interesting actually. But yeah they kinda went through presentation a bit fast.....so no one really could take down any notes lol.  English.......OUR PLAY IS AMAZIN'! AMAAAAAAAAAAAASHING AAAH! UNSTOPPABLE! I actually can't wait till we present it on Friday.......it's actually a pretty funny play. So we spent most of the time rehearsing...then just sitting around and chatting......yeah it's a cool play though. Romeo and Juliet......FOB/Matrix/Mr. Bean style. REALLY messed up but funny hehehehe.  Bused home.  And now I'm blogging.......yeah my blog formats are all beginning to look the same. I still need to learn HTML and stuff.....or maybe how to use Dreamweaver in a productive fashion hehe. As of right now.......what's a Hyperlink? j/k I'm not that stupid. At least I can make my background sit in one spot now heehee. Hmm what do I have to do today........catch up on theory.......memorize English script......practice piano if I have time. Yeah my night's gonna be filled with crap. AWW NUTS I still have to do that canvassing thing. Well.....so far I have $5. Lol out of 10 people ONE PERSON donated. I'm gonna be puttin' in 10 though and mom's puttin in 20. So altogether...........$35 DOLLARS. WAAAH. Yeah but note to self: NEVER CANVASS DURING MARCH AGAIN. Wow it's FREEZING or it's SOAKING WET. I just hope I can finish at least 20 houses by tonight.  Well........so much for canvassing. In the end.......after canvassing whole Walmer Gardens.....TWO out of over 20 houses donated. *Shrug* maybe next time I do this I'll do it earlier in the year lol. So plus me and my mom donating the total $$$ made: $40!!!! Meh not much....but I hope it go into good use.   After coming back from that canvassing.......I went to drum for a bit....Hmm since one of my toms is broken decided to do a new drum layout. instead of 5-piece I do 4-piece set. Snare, tom, floor tom, and bass. So far....it's not bad. In fact I kinda like it ^_^  Well.....yeah I'm pretty much done for tonite.....got piano theory still and stuff. So until my next entry......KEEP FIT AND HAVE FUN *body break dun dun dun dun dun dun.* Hehe j/k j/k.....just have a nice day =P. Later.

       3/30/04   Gloomy days bring lots of napping ^_^   I remember back when I was young I always used to wonder "why the heck do people take naps? What a waste of time!" I feel like such a hypocrite now lol. Wow.....I can see why naps are so productive in their own way. Just today after school....well since it was raining I thought "ugh I'll do Kidney canvassing tomorrow." WHY MUST RAIN COME NOW?! Oh well.....I guess I should maybe remember to do this canvassing stuff earlier in year.....don't leave it for final days of month *oops.* Anywho instead of canvassing then.....I thought "hey why not take a nap?" Well a proposed one hour nap......turned into four lol. So now I finish all the homework I'm behind on...and then....SLEEP!^_^.  Well today was another Tuesday *yay....only 3 more days of school opression before weekend!* so it was another day where I wake up at a ridiculously early time *630am* to head to senior band. Well I was kinda trudging everything behind schedule this morning.......so I got to school late. Frankly I REALLY don't care because I was REALLY tired this morning. So I got there around 7:15ish and yeah she kinda made a remark about it. At least I'm starting to adapt to senior band more. The only reason right now why some of the music seems so hard is because I seem to have difficulty counting 9/8 and 8/8 time lol.  But it's fun....I guess. Better than I anticipated at least =P.  Well after the rehearsal it was time for history. Wow......I seem so bored. Today we FINALLY hit some actual action. We talked about the Dieppe raid. Up until now....I still don't understand WHY they even did this raid...especially when they failed to complete it during its rehearsal twice in a row. Also....they had no support whatsoever.....so yeah the Canadians got slaughtered at the beach. Sadly only about 300 Germans were actually manning the guns at the time, but they did have reinforcements 50 miles away. Hmm......history is appealing at least....it's just kinda funny how I seem to be the only person at times that even knows what she's talking about.  Civics class.......REALLY boring like usual. Talked about leaders and organizations that have affected the world. I'ts pretty self-explanitory stuff.....Martin Luther King Jr., World Vision Canada, etc etc. *Yawn* why must the government waste over $3,000,000 on stuff like this? REALLY the money used to buy each textbook in our school alone *around $1,200+* could be used for more productive things.....like photocopy budget? They complain about how we always go over....well maybe if we don't have CAREERS and CIVICS we'd save $5,000 for PAPER.  Lunch...spent time in library lookin' over script w/ group. Talked to Brescia a hefty bit too....apparently she's still applyin' for universities. Hmm.....wow just to think she used to go to my church 10 years ago lol. Such a long time ago.....and she's so tall too. Probably only Asian girl I've ever seen surpass the 5'4 mark haha.  Math class: Hmm.......yeah we still using the stupid graphing program. Sho shtupahd. I concluded I'll be drawing the 007 opening screen in every movie..you know gun barrel sighting him...then he shoots you.....then blood comes down. Yes somehow I've turned that into a graph picture. Apparently there's parabolas and circles in it. Wow you know you've become a geek in math when lol. Well geeks are supposed to be good in math *YES I DON'T FIT IN CATEGORY YET ^_^.* Wait is that a good or bad thing =P.  Programming.......YES I CAN DRAW PAC MAN NOW LOL. Surprisingly it was easier than drawing the face. Maybe because me and Mitch did it co-operatively I think haha. I figured out the co-ordinates of the actual Pac-Man and he figured out how to make it move. It was interesting.....but I get it now. And Turing has actually helped me a bit with programming actual things now. I actually understand the concept of HTML....sorta lol. OH yeah today was also first time I ever saw Mr. Dayus actually get mad. He tries to act like he's pissed......but he's laughing still lol.  And yes.......after school it was badminton. Apparently *sadly* me and John are the best guys doubles team this year. Wow...........PATHETIC lol. The other doubles pairs: Alex Hughe and Finlan *Finlan=HORRIBLE* and Po-Kan and someone else. Po-Kan would be good if he actually took the game seriously....but he screws around a lot lol. Mixed doubles.....I still don't know what's happenin' but apparently Finlan is playing it this week at Quad meet at Oakridge. I just hope that me and John are decent compared to other schools lol. I actually played decent today though. Made a few maaaaad diving shots...OH YEAH which reminds me...  I FINALLY DID THE SHOT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO SINCE GR. 4. Brandon dropped it....and I was thinkin' "ooh crap." Unfortunately my dive was just about an inch short, so I let my raquet go.....flew kinda and BAM! the Bird goes to other side and we get a point! FINALLY! Did the amazing dive shot I've been dreaming of since Grade 4. And I can do it kinda consistently too.....did it a second time today also ^_^.  Anyways back to badminton practice. Conclusion: Central Junior Badminton 2004: NOT VERY WELL TRAINED.  Well when I got home....blast it's raining. Which means I didn't go canvassing tonight. I kinda feel bad that I never did it earlier.....pisses me off when I fail to complete somethin'. *Sigh* well instead of goin' out....I slept......  *four hours later*  Here I am now....blogging, eating, multitasking like my usual self hehe. Hmm I'm actually happy that God's been helpin' me through life so much this last little while. Just that life seems so confused at times...and jumbled up with stuff. Haven't really been able to do serious devos for a few nights now. "Purpose Driven Life" I'm slowly getting through now at least....yeah but I really need to catch up on devos. I guess I'll be switching between ODB and Purpose Driven for a bit. So happy though that God really does answer prayers in such an effective way. It's been amazing how my marks are actually managing to go up....though my life is more jumbled than ever. May wanna spend more time on piano though ehhehe. Well I'm out for the night....got Intermediate band still tomorrow. Later.

       3/29/04   Signs that I've been drumming for a while now....and I should be decent at it =P   Hmm......well after writing the earlier entry I thought "Hey it's only 8pm....I'll go drum around for a bit...." Well the proposed idea of a 30 minute jam session by myself turned into a 30 second one......ending with my high tom's drumhead being BOKAN! Yes......this shows that I've had my drum set for  a while now lol.....well...now I gotta spend another 30 bucks buying a new drumhead. Whoo. Yes something somewhat out of the ordinary that happened today.......why couldn't it have been a positive thing!?

       3/29/04   Out with the old month (almost) and new with the in (almost)   Grr if it weren't for time.....life would seem so much slower. Well today actually was an ok day.....I didn't fall asleep, not too much hard work....and english class was actually pretty funny for once hehe. It's really kinda cool actually how my week started....not too stressful at all. Also after last night reading so much MegaTokyo *NEW LINK CLICK IT* I guess it might have started me my week off kinda happily I guess. HILARIOUS comic strip. Hmm.......I wonder if I am a bit more optimistic than many people? Meh beats being pessimistic though.....apparently optimism lengthens your lifespan ^_^.  Well I woke up at about 7:30 today......almost got to shool late lol. Oh well who cares....breakfast was good. Mmmmm French Toast ^_^. And also my mom wanted me to bring a coat to school though it was 12 degrees outside. In the end I took it off anyways though.....T-Shirt was good enough for today =P.  First class of today.......MUSIC. Ahh yes good old music class....never fails to amuse me. Today was pretty fun. Few jokes like usual......but of course we finished some work too ehehehehehehe. Of course yes people asked about what happened to my eye.....and I replied to them in the most modest and brief way as possible: I ran into a wall. OK real reason: Calvin CHECKED me into a wall...but same thing =P. Lol Lindsay got a sunburn in 14 degree weather from reading hahaha so I'm not that bad off =P.  Science class.......didn't do much. Note taking. *Yawn.*  Lunchtime.....well we ate lunch what else? Crappage apparently Nasvhille in hockey though dropped to 9th place. Really wanna see em make it into playoffs......LOSE ST. LOUIS PLEASE. They won't be able to do jack in the playoffs anyways. So yeah today lunch was a bit of talk about hockey...left a bit early since I had to help Lindsay and her group set up powerpoint for Bio class......so yeah not much.  Bio class. Unfortunately Lindsay's group's powerpoint didn't work.....so they had to resort to overheads. Well it worked....but the laptop didnt have a "A" drive *wow how crappy is that?.*  English....kinda rehearsed Romeo & Juliet script. Yeah some funny moments there.  Stage band......got yelled at to do better by Kiwanis basically lol.  Yeah I know I sped by today.....but I gotta REALLY eat sometin' and then head out the door to do canvassing for Kidney Foundation. I hope it isn't too late lol. SO yeah I'm out.....cya.

       3/28/04   The "wonders" of MSN   First off before anything else....my prayers do go out to Cecilia Zhang's family right now as today they found  her dead in Missisauga. I pray that the Lord be with their family at this time of grieving and that the close family and friends of the Zhangs may also be with them at this time.  Well I just woke up from a 3 hour nap *Naw didn't do anything in the end w/ Colin and Paul* and after a shower and dinner trudged downstairs to work on my science lab when then I find myself in a huge group convo with the following message:  "Everyone put an X @ da beginnin of ur name to pay respect to Cecillia Zhang whos body was found in a Missisauga Ravine earlier yesterday morning. Pass this on to every1 on your list"  First of all I had a deja vu feeling....but I'm not gonna talk about that. I'm just finding it kinda interesting how almost 60% of the people now have X's in front of their MSN name. It looks cool.....but honestly how many of them I'm wondering actually got a emotional punch from hearing it? How many actually have their MSN name written w/ a "X" for a reason and how many actually go with the crowd? Another point my friend John Li pointed out is why put an "X" for her and not every other person that dies in this world. That is a point that kinda got me thinking.....if humans are equal...then why don't we respect those who pass away like this everyday?  Then again........it is only MSN. So I hope people don't take it as though if you don't have an X,C,O, or w/e in front of his/her name.....it doesn't mean they are mean ruthless people. I mean it's what's in the heart that counts that an old friend of mine Gavin Docherty also pointed out.  But yeah it is upsetting how everyone had so much hope *I mean even I had thought they'd have a chance of finding her* but after today...that candle flame has just burned out. May her spirit be with the God Almighty now.

       3/28/04   Just another typical Sunday ^_^   Yes......another beginning for another week. How many weeks have gone by in my life? Too many to count. If you really wanna do the math 52x15=? So yeah right now....I guess I'm just thinking about what's going to pop up in my life this week. Probably more usual things....homework, working out, HYPE, usual I guess. Thing is though time is already passing so quickly. I mean right now two weeks ago was TC 2004, and I can't believe that in a matter of say...another 10 weeks it'll be 12 weeks ago when March Break happened. Time actually flys by so quickly. I now know why parents say we should cherish our childhood. I honestly think I've become 15 too quickly. Oh well...enough pondering about the future.....when I can barely keep track of the present hehe.  This morning I woke up at 7:30.....as I had to wake up early to do worship at church this week. Yes my eye is now swollen from yesterday when I got nailed into a wall......but that's the least most important part about gym night. The main object is........we all had fun =P despite the fact my eye looks like an apple lol. So went downstairs, had a quick breakfast and headed out the door. Jason seemed pretty cheery for having to wake up at 7am this morning since I had to pick him up early. Least he wasn't in a pissed-off mood.......so that's all that matters I'm still alive. Got to church around 8:10ish.....and quickly ran over the songs before english service. Yeah that's basically what happened before english service which then started at 9:15am.  After the singing, I was the first person to talk about my time at TC. I kinda don't know why they made this thing this year....but it was kinda cool. So I went up there and talked about my experiences at TC (refer to my flashback blog) and it actually wasn't that hard. I actually don't get nervous public speaking anymore......SWEEEET. So talked for about 5-7 minutes, then Rebecca went up, then Gavin. Basically we all talked about TC from different POV's (points of view). After that then I read scripture, Phillipians 4:1-7 and then came the message. Today's message was about personal and congregational peace, and how peace is the way to go in life. To me, if you have congregational peace, chances are you also have personal peace. Then song of response, and then offering, benediction, meditation then we all headed downstairs for food.....yum^_^...  Sunday school class we finished up lessons about different names for Christ...apparently God is called many different things throughout the Bible....like "The LORD is There" (Jehovah Shammah) or "The LORD is Peace (Jehovah Shalom). There were a few others....but I kinda forget em ehehehehhehee. Whoops. After the lesson chatted around for a bit.....then headed out for home.....I just feel like sleeping today......I WANT SLEEP lol.  Played some SC, did some homework, and of course.......ate lunch. Yeah today hasn't been to exciting....at church though Jason brought his inflatable Samurai sword....which was pretty funny lol. Like I said before my eye is still the size of an apple, oh yeah and like usual Carmen was late for english service =P. Oh yeah for some reason the UWO students had long rolls of newspaper used for swordfights...*shrug* weird bunch of kids lol. Hmm......other than that right now I don't really plan on doing much today......I sorta feel like just sitting here....and doing absolutely nothing. Productive no? Yes? No? Maybe? *Shrug* I still got homework and stuff.........and another stupid English test. I don't really see the purpose to these things. HONESTLY how the heck do you study for a english test? SHO lame. We also have a script for Romeo and Juliet thing set up. Me, Heather, Katherine and Robert are doing the scene where the huge fight happens and Mercutio and Tybalt die.....whoo how action packed....*zZzzzzZzzzZZZzzZZZzzz*  So what am I going to do now? Might go do something w/ Paul and Colin later, or just mope around here....waiting for what tomorrow has to offer for me hehe. *Yawn* Maybe I'll go sleep.....this week has been one LONG week.....and sleep looks VERY tempting hehe. Later.

       3/27/04   Badminton, Piano, Worship Practice, Church SPORTS NIGHT!   WOW what a long day today. I never actually realized it......but holy crap when you wake up at a time before 11am.....your day seems SOOO much longer. This morning I woke up at......I think 8am and my day started right then. Wow it was a pretty fun day though.....so much stuff to do and all....hehehe. Great Saturday not wasted ^_^.  My day like I said started at 8am today. Woke up early for UCC badminton. So yeah it was kinda hard waking up at 8am on a Saturday, but I managed....took me record 15 minutes to finally drag myself outta bed. Great time record set ^_^. So ate a quick breakfast, and then headed out the door.......armed and ready for 32hours of hard-hitting, intense, body-breaking BADMINTON!  *By the way yes that was sarcasm*  So yeah got to UCC around 8:30....and for the next two hours played some pretty fun games of badminton. Oh yeah saw Lina there too and her friend Yang! Haven't seen her since.......well Badminton season last year lol. Yeah she's got a LOT better now. She'd actually be a good mixed doubles partner....but she play singles since Banting badminton blows. Yeah and apparently people think I'm undergrad @ UWO lol. I am supposedly "good" at badminton for my age, as one first year PH.D student said to me lol. A 6th year student also thought that I was undergrad....wow lol do I look that old haha. But it's amazing how I can actually have decent games with people in University....I think I'm gonna start goin' on regular basis. It's cool too though.....since it wakes me up for piano also. Just gotta remember to sleep earlier on Friday nights. But yeah pretty good time.....had to leave at 10:30 though to get home in time for piano practice...grr.  So sat at home for about an hour....practiced piano and ate, MSNed for a bit and then headed out for piano. It's about 12:30pm right now.  Piano went ok. I got Kiwanis confirmation papers. Blast I'm competitor 1 for both my events lol. Not too cool but meh.....then again it can be good. I sorta set the bar. If I set it high.....well then it's more challenging for other people. So I gotta MAAAD practice these next few weeks hehe. Got nagged at for forgetting theory. Oops=P.  Well after that......I spent about an hour and a half at home just moping about....mostly drumming. Boy do I need a drum teacher.....my fills and stuff are all the same.....*shudder.* Hopefully summer I'll be able to find a teacher. But for now.....for the afternoon I drummed whatever I could, then got ready for Worship practice....which I was VERY tired for for some reason.  Got there perfectly on time. Everyone else just arrived too hehe. So basically we practiced to worship tomorrow. Most of the songs are somewhat slow so drums don't have much of a part but meh....it's still cool. I'll sing behind my noise bunker maybe lol^_^. But I don't know why.....I just seemed so TIRED for it. Maybe because I didn't really do anything.....but yeah I just felt REALLY tired. Glo, me, Simon and Niette doin' worship this week. Had some pretty funny talk there during practice though hehe.  Afterwards I headed straight to WLAC for Gym night tonight for our english ministry. Pretty fun night. Games, fun, food, etc. It was pretty cool. Met some new people...and just got to know some of the other people in the english service that normally attend on Sunday mornings. It was pretty cool. Unfortunately I kinda got injured lol. We were playing this game where you have a number, and when your number is called, you and the opponent w/ the same number get up and basically have a game. Well they called 4 numbers, it was a 4 on 4, and when I went to get the ball froun the boundary line.....Calvin checks me into the wall. So right now.....well my eye is kinda swollen but I'm ok. Ali gave me a ice pack that I thought would be useless....but I guess kinda helped take down the swelling. Ow but it feels so weird now....numb lol. After some group games *my group owned lol* we went out for food break and a short message from Pastor D. Spoke about Paul and his testimony in the Bible. Didn't really relate I think but apparently the committee back in LCAC made him do it. But it was still interesting. My eye was swollen through that whole time. Then afterwards.....VOLLEYBALL! So Deja Vu....I stuffed Craig *Gavin's friend* like I did to Rhoden last year....ONLY thing I actually did for the whole volleyball game that was good lol. Then some pickup games of 3-on-3 ball. Wow I'm horrible lol. Made probably a 20% FG%. Ouch. Lol I used to get at least 60% during summer.......this is what happens when you stop playing regularly for......almost a year? hahaha meh s'all good though all just fun times ^_^. It was cool times. Lol oh yeah and Jason's inflatable Samurai Sword lol......so cool. What else....Hmm....yeah that's all I can really think about right now. But it is really cool how God set up this event....for the idea of his followers to become closer Bro's and Sisters in Christ. Had really good times and just some great laughs.  So yeah now I'm home.....gotta head to bed soon hehe....plus I gotta make some point form notes for tomorrow since I'm speaking up there about my experience at TC this year. Plus I gotta wake up for worship hehe. Oh boy tomorrow's gonna be a LONG day too. Hmm....yeah I gotta prepare for tomorrow hehehe. Well anyways I'm out for the night I guess....fun day though....long days may have more hours, but that just means more stuff to do hehe. Yeah I guess I am kinda over optimistic. As Josh and Gavin mentioned over March Break I seem to be the only person that likes to take 6-hour walks around Downtown Toronto and still be smiling about it hahaha. Well yeah I'm out for the night Ladies n' Gents....so until tomorrow...Sayonara.

       3/26/04   WELL DESERVED WEEKEND AFTER LONG WEEK   Normally I don't mind school as much as the people around me....but this week just seemed SOOO LONG. I don't know why.....maybe because I now wake up at 6am for most of the mornings of the week, or maybe just because it's the week after March Break. It's just that March Break passed by so quick this year.....I mean I still remember last year on the train comin' home from TC I was thinkin' "Boy...this TC kinda sucked I couldn't even make it to day two....NOW I GOTTA WAIT ANOTHER YEAR for TC." Wow do I regret saying that lol....that year would come by so quickly. That year is now.....well last week. And it's already come and gone by. *Sigh* I wish that life would pass by slower.....I mean I've gotten over missing TC but just the fact it passed by so FAST. But then again....that just means it'll only be another year until me and Gavin are TC Captains. ONLY a year =P. hehe.  Hmmm...also I just read up some random blogs and hit my old HYPE counselor's blog....CONNIE! I'm surprised that she wrote a entry on Jan. 13, 2002 about us. That was almost two years ago...that's how long HYPE's been around for. Pretty cool when I think about it....also at the same time kinda retarted to think about how immature we were back in grade 8,7 and 6. But then again it's cool to see how much we've all grown hehe. HYPE's now two years old....hehe yay!^_^.  This morning started off with senior band....and I'm actually starting to enjoy it. The music's pretty fun to play....and just to listen to some of it ......it's amazing stuff. Make's intermediate band look so crappy. So yeah it's been pretty wild week in band too.....I'm actually starting to get the hang of some of the music. It's actually not that hard....just some of the beats are REALLY weird.  History watched rest of Pearl Harbour Documentary, and talked about the Japanese internment camps. When I think about all the racial issues back in WWII, I sometimes wonder if Hitler would have won or not if those 6,000,000 people he killed fought for Nazi Germany instead. Just think.....another 6,000,000 armed humans sprawling across the European continent in probably another 15+ Panzer Divisions. That woulda killed. That would have meant probably another 1,500,000 men defending the beaches of D-Day alone, and probably anoter 3,000,000 could have helped in Russia. But no Hitler wanted to kill them.....there goes his victory. Anyways for the two movies....the movie Pearl Harbour actually was pretty accurate. We get to watch Saving Private Ryan next...only first 25 minutes though.....ugh the movie's so good just watch the whole thing.  Civics we talked about leadership.....pretty boring stuff. Then watched a movie w/ Martin Luther King Jr's speech on freedom and equality....you know the famous "I have a dream" one. Yeah we watched that...wasn't too exciting of a class......then lunch.  Lunch went to Jasper's again today....forgot what I had. OH YEAH I REMEMBER NOW. The burning Chicken Pot pie. My tongue still feels burned from it. You know that sandy....weird feeling. Well yeah I can still feel it and it's been 3 hours. It was DAMN GOOD though. Best chicken pie I've had in my life. Mike and John got their usual burger and breakfast (food goes in order w/ names). Hermann went out w/ Steve and them and Nate wasn't at school today. It was good pie though....mmmmmm chicken.  Math class did some graphing program. Really stupid. Apparently costs $510 for you to own it. How stupid for the government to be buying stupid programs like that lol. That money could have gone into buying 50 new basketballs......two new school computers, or maybe.......25,000 new pencils. But NOOOOOOO they HAD to buy a program we rarely use. *Sigh* the government....you gotta love em *not.*  Programming......made some program with a face winking....BOOOOORRRIIINNNNNGGGGG. I'm almost done Hyperstudio project though......such a crappy project but *shrug* lol.  Then came home off bus........and now........gonan probably go drum and then UCC. Maybe go canvassing for the Kidney Society....gotta do that by next friday hehe. Nothin' much else happened today....just that this week has gone by REAL SLOW.  I still remember on Sunday helping Janny w/ her history, Monday I was totally burned out, Tuesday Bio presentation, etc. etc. Oh yeah and LOTS of band in between those areas. I just don't get how the week passed by so SLOOOOOWLY with all that stuff to occupy me. *Shrug* hopefully next week will be different hehe.  Well originally my original posted blog was around 6 or so....but now it's 10pm and I just got back from UCC. OW MY MUSCLES HURT SO MUCH. First time working out in..........a month? Did a somewhat intense one. My biceps feel so numb still......and my chest feels messed up still too from bench. But yeah no breakin' tonite.....gotta build up muscles for.......badmintoN? Lol. And of course just for other stuff.....also I like to try to keep fit......and not become a 160 pound gr. 10 kid w/ 30% body fat. So yeah I did that today w/ Dan and Marcello basically for four hours.....good workout though. Now I'm sitting at home....blogging....gotta still practice piano....and wake up at......8 for badminton 2morrow lol. Plus worship practice, AND gym nite 2morrow....hehe long day =P.  Also on a side note.....COURSE SELECTIONS ARE SO FRIGGIN' DIFFICULT FOR GR. 11! I have too many things I want to take. If you can.....pray for the Lord's guidance to be with me while I'm confirming my courses in April. Thanks a bunch people =P.  Lates.

       3/25/04   Slowly settling back into school time again....   Yup it's been four days.....and I still can't settle back into my schedule before March Break. My brain still seems to think that sleep time is until 2pm......and lunchtime is still around 2pm in my head. So yeah last 4 days.....I've been starving in the middle of either english or programming. Stupid biological clocks........GET IT RIGHT LUNCH IS AT 11AM AT SCHOOL! Yes I realize that my biological clock won't just LISTEN to me but still just getting that comment out (come on...I'll give you a pizza if you listen =P)......no I'm not talking to my stomach I'm talking to my very talkative "Left Wall Section." Yeah you can shut up now. That was directed to you....yes you...the reader.  My day started off relatively decent. Last night was the first night I actually got  7 HOURS  of sleep! IT IS POSSIBLE TO SLEEP MORE THAN 5 HOURS. And WOW was it cool.....I actually felt AWAKE for once. Morning went by pretty quickly......got everything done and left the door at about 7:50 or so. Pretty nice looking day today....sun's shining already. A great blessing from the Lord after think it was 4 straight days of rain. Yesterday when I decided to cut across the train tracks to get home.....wow my shoe was actually getting stuck in the mud.....yeah and my Iverson Questions are basically ruined for now. They're old though so I don't really care. So yes.....headed to school like usual.....radio really stunk this morning....every station played the crummiest music I've heard in my life....106.9 I just hate because it's non-stop rap....the crappy kind. I mean I don't mind some (like Nas and such).....but listening to the artists like 50 and Chingy.....random crap about stuff that doesn't even matter....yeah they need a lesson 101 on "how to rap about stuff people care about." I mean I like Nas because he actually has stuff to bring out....like how so much in society is poison (his song "Poison"). IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS COOL BECAUSE THERE'S COOL ISSUES IN IT. I mean HONESTLY why would I give a crap about what a "wanksta" looks like. Crappiest song ever....besides "Right Thurr." *Shudder.*  And at school.... Music class first. We didn't really do much....worked on Gambolier....then we got into little groups like quartets and started playing random songs.....weird.  Oh yeah....and Kiwanis week....I'll be busy...REALLY BUSY. Apparently I'm now part of Senior Band for good, playing in intermediate band, and also Stage Band X. Plus my usual piano repetoire....wow. So much stuff....and so yes that was basically music class summed up right there....  Science.....did some lab w/ people running....I was falling asleep during that time....I'm amazed my marks are still so good even though I sleep during 50% of the classes lol.....I mean I still remember at times in September where I would fall asleep while writing a note......and my note would kinda trail off into "-------------------------------"   Lunch today was different from ordinary. I didn't go eat lunch.....but instead stayed into play some basketball. O M G i'm horrible now. Sunk one from outside perimeter and then another one around the foul line. Wow I really need to start playing again lol. But yeah....played a pick up game sorta thing.....me Jason and Dan were on a team. Boy were we horrible lol. Jason was the most hyper one out of all of us like usual......and I just sucked. Long story short.....I starved for lunch =P.  Bio class........Tehmina and Rachel's group presented their presentation today on "the respiratory system." Lots of candy.....basically they killed our group in all aspects. And I've never seen so many overheads in my life. It was REALLY good presentation though.....just the content....and the game afterwards. We won! lol. Mmm........sour gummy bears and gumballs. The  gumballs I shoed 20 in my mouth.....not very smart as up until now my jaw is still numb from chewing the huge piece that was in my mouth. Well combined into one gigantic piece thing.  English...read......and went to Robert's group. John Terry and Adam Crookes are just too friggin' annoying. Nothing against Mike he's cool but the other two....yeah just can't stand them. So I went w/ Katherine, Heather, and Robert now. Robert's alright ever since I got to know him better from working on bio presentation together.....and when u sat beside him in Geo and Bio this year.....yeah you talk a little bit. Heather and Katherine are pretty cool kids too.......both seem pretty obsessive w/ drama though haha. So we started the script.....pretty much debated for 40 minutes what scene to do and whether we should add bullet-time matrix stuff for the sword fight lol. Yeah........and at one point since we figured we were short on actors.....we were planning a teddy bear to play Mercutio lmao. Yeah weird bunch of people....oh yeah and the line that my last group had.... "Where Romeo at....Dawg?!" honourable mention from teacher haha.  Badminton tryouts today.....I thought I did OK. I still don't get how they decide how good you are from watching you play doubles. Doesn't make any sense. Meh both ways I think I might have made the team.....but then again I think I may have got cut because well the 9ers basically make it on by default for experience, and Pokan plays decent. there's 10 spots. Hermann, Jacob, Brandon, Niner A, Niner B, so basically 5 spots left on the team lol. Well for the guys....I don't know anything about the girls on the team. Too many of them lol. SO yeah that was basically badminton summed up. I hope I make it at least hehe.  Afterwards, walked to bus stop w/ Mike and Dan, and then headed home. Stopped at the park to play ball w/ Dominik and Ryan for a bit. Wow I'm horrible still haha.....plus I was starving lol. So played for about.....20 minutes or so then headed home.  Napped for an hour......thats long story short at home. Drummed for a bit...and now I go eat after this blogging hehe. Yeah I'm on the phone w/ Josh discussing HYPE website so it's kinda hard to think lol. Cya.

       3/24/04   Well....lookie I actually am blogging again lol   Yeah....was just surfin' around some blogs.....and went to Jesse Wong's. Crazy how the dude still seems to remember us so well hahaha. Well yeah it was cool to see a whole entry.......FOR OUR FELLOWSHIP!? Were we actually that annoying though back then I wonder? Wouldn't be surprised.....but yeah I never really realized how much more mature we've got over the years. Come to think of it....we've changed......A LOT. But it's pretty cool that he still remembers us hehehe. Gavin still learns guitar off him so yeah I guess he'd remember Gavin pretty well hehe. Well yeah thought I'd add that....pretty cool though seein' that we're still in his mind. Keep growin' in Christ Jesse.....if it were never for you LCAC would probably still have no youth fellowship.  Well I'm gone hehe....lates people.

       3/24/04   Image is Nothing...Thirst is everything. Obey your Thirst   Hehe kinda funny.....yeah I bet you recognize that slogan....Sprite? Now ring a bell? Well yeah I was watching that commercial yesterday....and something pretty funny just popped in my head....the slogan can almost seem to fit for Christianity haha.....  "Image is nothing" in my mind was like....your image on this world to others is nothing....However "Thirst is Everything" reminds me of how longing to build up your relationship w/ Christ is everything. "Thirsting for his friendship." So therefore...."Obey Your Thirst"=P. Amusin' huh? Bet you never thought of it that way haha. "Image is Nothing...Thirst is everything. Obey your Thirst" hehe.  ANYWAYS.....  Yeah this week is the first week where I gotta experience Gr. 10 and Senior band all in one week....it's the first of the many future weeks....well 'till the end of the school year. So yeah....these last few days I've been averaging 5 hours of sleep a night.......Pretty sweet eh? NO. I've been so tired last few days....I just REALLY need some sleep lol.  So yes....my sleep deprivation is soaring still.....as I can barely stay awake first period each day now...but I can still manage hehe. Today though I had band....argh. So I woke up at 630.....going to bed at 1am the earlier night, and trudged out the door after a usual....slow moving morning. It's cool though how the sun's actually UP when I wake up....hehe I clearly live out the phrase "rise w/ the sun." So I got a ride to school...it wasn't actually too bad weather this morning though...right now it's raining....actually it's stopped looking out my window but it WAS raining.  Band......yes I play bass trombone now. It's bigger, louder, and cooler. It's actually shiny too ^_^. Usual repetoire....Trombones like usual sound good......and the trumpets like usual sound like a bunch of out-of-tune foghorns.Flutes and Clarinets sound good now though.....amazingly. Even though 15 flutes were missing today....you can't ever tell the difference. I think half of our band IS just flutes...and yet 4 trombones still produce more sound =P. So yeah band was pretty good today...  And after that......history class. We watched Pearl Harbour and a Documentary ON the actual battle. Compared the differences and similarities. Well basically yeah if you haven't seen the movie it's a decent example of the actual battle....I mean obviously they kinda made the Americans look "good" even though they were getting their butts kicked....but patriotism right =P. Which by the way I kinda thought was interesting how they played "happy, victorious, rah rah go America" music when......well they managed to get TWO PLANES up to fight.......300 Jap planes? lol......sad how Hollywood needs some sort of "America's got hope" thing in the movie. Also.......it's kinda stupid I still find how in the end they just HAD to add the bombing in Japan-occupied China....that was supposed to make America look "good" by retalliating...when really it was a waste of B-24 Liberator bombers, and well-trained American pilots...they just HAD to add that to the movie even though it happened almost 4 months later. The actual battle was a lot more gruesome probably......and also I doubt it'd be that amazing managing two planes to get into the air. Basically Americans had a TOTAL loss...and Japs whooped their butts. Final Casualties: Japan lost around 30 planes and 5 midget subs. America lost whole Pacific Fleet  Civics classed....watched the rest of Remember the Titans. Great movie....seen it umpteen times but still really good. "Everywhere we goOOO Everywhere we goOOO people wanna knoOOO people wanna knoOOO...."etc etc. Great cheer lol. So yeah watched that....chatted with Fenoulet and Pokan a bit...then headed for lunch.  Lol great times today at lunch. We went to Jasper's Cafe today.......Mmmmm pasta.....sho good. Some beef something something. AMAZING THOUGH......it was REALLY filling. Oh yeah and my daily cup of java too. Java, mocha, mud, Cup O' Joe.....w/e you wanna call it. New staff person today......made Thompson's breakfast look like well.....crap. Boss yelled at her too I think from what Thompson heard. Bummer hehe. And well so yeah....basically today at lunch:  John: MAN.....why do those Gr. 9 FOBS always take the couches?! Joe: Man QUIT CALLING EVERY ASIAN A FOB John: UGH BUT THOSE FOBS.... *Joe smacks Thompson across head* John: OW.....what was that for *punches Joe* *Joe Smacks Thompson across back of head...* John: GEEZ CHILL.........I only said ONE joke *Hermann then smacks Thompson....causing him  to spill his coffee all over himself*  Asians vs. Americans....Asians won lol. Hermann "accidentally" smacked Thompson while he was drinking his coffee. Hermann's excuse: (which is very original by the way)  "I DIDN'T SEE IT!"  Lol so yeah Thompson kinda look like he wet himself....so people got a few laughs out from that....he was pretty pissed though for the rest of the day. But yeah it was kinda funny.....seeing he spilled coffee on me before too.....so yeah Hermann kinda just did something I was supposed to do a LONG time ago...but I'm not that "hostile" anyways to start with. But yeah I think John's gonna kill me tomorrow lol.  Math class........WE GOT OUR TESTS BACK! Class average........51%! AMAZINGLY THOUGH I whoooped graphite ass on this test. 96%!!!! CRAPPAGE TOTALLY CHINESE-FAILED IT! NOOOOOOOOOOOO! J/k 96% is actually the best mark I've got on anything in math this year....other than stupid 2 question quizzes......I'm talkin' about like BIG KAHUNA tests. So yeah.........life's been very dear to me lately....I've had some great times....and the future is looking bright =). But I really despise geometry........trigonometry's up next. Hope it's easy. But yeah I really do thank the Lord for guidin' me through that test. It was honestly BRUTAL. So happy I only got two marks off ^_^.  Programming......well I made my first game EVER in my life today on a computer. Not interactive but it's still pretty cool. Turing is pretty basic language, but you can do a hefty bit with it. So yeah we made a checkers game. I finished mine pretty quickly and headed to surfing the web.....Lol one kid Raymond posted up the code on his website, a few others copied and got sent out to the hallway....all of em haha. Now they get zero no matter what. Bummer lol. Mitch kinda went overboard and made a movie-script-like thing to go w/ his lol.  Well after school....bused home w/ Dejan and Elaina. Talked...then walked home. Wow lucky I didn't wear K-Swiss shoes today woulda been ruined.....decided to cut across train tracks....NEVER DO IT IN THE RAIN. The grounds all muddy and squishy from lack of roots holding ground together, so yeah when water falls the soils all loose and muddy....grr my Questions are sorta ruined now. Meh. Just happy they weren't my K-Swisses. Hmm.....so yeah today kinda sucked since it was raining. Managed to get home still at least hehe.  Piano practiced, ate, MSN for a bit. Gloria was just telling me about how some Koreans get their eyelids surgically enlarged....eew. And in Mexico apparently you can do it on the streets. *shudder* reminds me of movie Minority Report. Actually I laughed at that part of the movie sadly lol.  So yeah that's basically my day up until 5pm. Doubt I'll blog later unless somethin' REALLY cool comes up. Got piano theory and stuff tonight. Grrr....Oh well haven't seen those people in theory for a week...kinda cool to see em I guess after March Break=).  So yeah....I'll just leave you with my cheesy slogan taken from Sprite:"Image is Nothing...Thirst is everything. Obey your Thirst." Lol I am overusing that phrase.  Lates.

       3/23/04   Thought I'd add this   Yeah this is my first time ADDING onto a day's entry...but I just really felt I had to add this...  Well while surfing blogs just now......I came across Gavin's. His last few days have just seemed so rough. I'm just thankful that he's got back to his senses now. I mean.....with his new gift of being able to "see" into Spiritual Realm....can sound so freaky. I just wanted to say Gavin man....you got guts to be usin' that gift. If I were in your shoes, wow would I have fear at some times. Props man.... maad props.  On another note.....I mean I guess the person I helped on Sunday hasn't totally slipped my mind yet. I just hope the assignment I helped her on will be alright....also I just hope that her life will improve period. I guess this is just like a "reflection/thoughts" part I'm adding in.....never really done this before. But yeah...you know who you are out there....your life is in God's hands no worries.  Yeah so I thought I'd add that....not much else to say. I just hope that those two things mean something to the people I'm writin' to. Lates. (Wonder how Josh is doing with his Buddhism exploring w/ why people believe in Buddhism).  Oh yeah Gavin...read March 23rd's Our Daily Bread....might give you a little bit of encouragement there buddy.

       3/23/04   Biology Presentation went DECENT....The opening of Badminton Season   So I guess March Break's ending does bring some fun.....I mean the start to a new badminton season.....hehe there's a bit of fun there I guess. Also we got a tea dispenser now at my house ^_^. So yeah these last few days have been somewhat amusing I guess since school restarted.  Well this morning did have its unfortunates. I ended up only getting 6 hours of sleep last night since I decided to stay up 'till midnight. But it was alright I still managed to wake up on time. Weird. The sun's actually up now when I wake up at 6am. Good sign of summer I guess. So this morning was a bit welcoming I guess....the sun's up now when I rise. Cool. Well then I head to school after doing my usual morning routine.....and off to senior band I go.....whoo.  This morning......wow it was a bit of a waste lol. I mean I was signed up to play basically just Godzilla Eats Las Vegas.....but in the end now I am basically PART of the senior band. Meh......it's kinda cool but at the same time VERY HARD. Senior music is actually a bit difficult compared to the stuff I play right now. Next year I might actually have to start practicing for band =P.  After band today......MUSIC! Featuring back....MRS. WHARTON! Yes the teacher I'm supposed to have is finally back. And yes it was an interesting music class. Much more open than usual which was pretty cool. So we just played random songs.....and stuff like that. Basically just chatted around since it was her first "full day" back.  Science......notes notes and more notes. Fake quiz on first day...which was really lame of Mr. Curphey to do. HA HE'S LAME AND THAT'S LAME......shut up.  Lunchtime..................today I headed out to Galleria and bought Subway.....mmmmmmmmmmmm subs. And then I had to buy a prize for our bio presentation......we have a cheesy mini-game show that totally failed at the end lol.  BIOLOGY! Summarizing: The presentation by me, Robert, Adam and Everett KICKED ASS. Well I think at least lol. We took up the whole 75 minutes. It's actually not that difficult to. In fact, we could have taken up more time....ok maybe not because we just ran a video in the end. About a "nutrition rave" in Los Angeles somewhere. it's a rave....but instead of E it's vitamin supplements and instead of booze it's juice. Interesting I know lol. So yeah basically Adam did the powerpoint, I did the talkin for the intro and some other add-ins, and Okanski and Robert split up vitamins and minerals. Oh yeah and Adam's intelligence at its prime:  Adam: Alright people.....now time for some questions to see if you were paying attention. Flip that note over on its back so NO CHEATING =D. Joe: Adam....the sheets double sided.  Yup.....so our game kinda bombed. Adam assumed we were supposed to let them write the answers down and first person to hand in all the right answers wins. Well MY original idea was to ASK them with a VOICE and have them put up their hands. So yeah....unfortunately in the end after much confusion and getting some people pissed off *I think half the class wants to kill me now =S* We FINALLY managed to find a winner. Some dude in gr. 11. Meh. I really don't care....it's 3 bucks of fried potatoes. I mean yeah they're good but fighting over them? PEOPLE THOSE FRIED PIECES OF POTATO CLOG YOUR ARTERIES. I mean HONESTLY their fighting for deterioration of their bodies lol. Maybe I'm going to far but yeah just somethin' that Adam said that inspired that hehe.  English......read. Then I had to stay back because I left "early." Wow two minutes before the bell SORRY. Not that I care since I have badminton anyways....and 'sides more time to finish my novel. War Angel.....about 9/11 a bit and some other stuff. It's alright I guess.....grr I wanted to get Tribulation Force (2nd book of Left Behind). But yeah off to badminton now...  Badminton..........meh fun fun I guess =P. I think I'll get cut though lol I'm actually terrible now. All I can really do is drive and clear....my smashes aren't much better than before. If I even have a chance it'll be because of "technique" and not brute force. I hate smashing so much.....lucky I can kinda receive em hehe. But yeah not much to say about that.....just playing and stuff. There are some decent 9ers actually........BUT SO MANY OF THEM! Like 20 of them....and only 10 gr.10's. Oh yeah and 70% of the team are asians......and 90% of them are FOBS lol. Me, Hermann and PK seem to be the only people that don't even seem FOBee. Oh yeah and of course the white kids hehe.  Well yeah now I'm home....nothin' much happened as you can see today. Well least my bio presentation went well. I seem to pray a lot more than before now though ever since my Gr. 10 year started....and so far it's been doing  good for me =P. I feel pretty comfortable public speaking now too.....today I actually didn't speed up like usual. Oh yeah tried cracking one or two lame jokes too lol. But yeah I'm out.......think I'm gonna go drum for a bit. So until tomorrow......here's your daily cup O' Joe....fresh off the uh.......keyboard?

       3/22/04   NOW I remember why NEVER to blog early AGAIN   Hehe......well my plan to blog earlier yesterday was pretty stupid. I now remember why I don't blog until my whole day has passed hehe. Well I'm first gonna blog about what happened yesterday AFTER my blog post went up.....as one of the weirdest things ever came up. Well not weird exactly.....but more of like....cool actually...  *Flashin' back to last night*  Well after blogging, I basically spent the rest of the day yesterday doing the mound of homework I had due for today and tomorrow. Well the Biology note had to get done since I needed to get Ms. Wiener to photocopy it, so it was kinda default that I had to do it. But yeah my night kinda took a turn *instead of sleepin' at 11 I slept at 1* when I helped someone do their history...no it wasn't anyone in London but someone I met @ TC. After helpin' her w/ her project *no names mentioned* we started talkin' n' stuff, and then by the end.....she basically told me about how her life's not exactly too cool at the moment and how @ TC she never really felt that comfortable. It was kinda cool though how earlier that day in Sunday School the speaker that came in to talk to us.....talked kinda about the same thing. ...  Basically he never had a great childhood or anything, and didn't  turn to God until about 16. So I told her the story, and I don't know what effect it had on her up until now. But yeah I started prayin' for her last night also. Thought I'd share that....was kinda interestin' how somethin' I learned at 11 came handy 13 hours later. It was also my first time helpin' out someone in a Spiritual "depression." Basically she wasn't havin' exactly a great time growin' in Christ. I talked to some other people about what I should do.....and I just hope the advice I gave her was really from Christ himself. So after that THEN I started the bio and stayed up till 1am. Wonder how she's feelin' right now...  *Back to now*  So yeah...for the whole day today I was still thinkin' about what happened yesterday. So basically I didn't sleep until 'bout 2am last night. Lucky it wasn't band night or I woulda been screwed =P.  So I woke up around 730.....and then did usual morning routine and headed out  the door with Patrick. Got to school pretty early actually which was surprising. History class was ok today.....we didn't really do anything.....just usual note-taking and preparing for next day where we're gonna compare the movie "Pearl Harbour" *Parts of it* and some documentary to see how real the movie really was. Funny though when Mr. Campell had to sub for Ms. Manson for a bit today. He was makin' Ms. Manson seem like a dictator haha. Actually I like his teaching style better......waaay more laid back and not as serious. Also today in history.....I just felt REALLY sick.....wanted to go home but I felt better throughout the day. Kinda started prayin' in my head. So yeah it was pretty boring.......you know usual history class. I mean I like the subject....just sometimes Ms. Manson makes it so......BORING.  Civics class.....whee *there Gertrude I spelled it WHEE* we started watching "Remember the Titans!" FINALLY! Something that DOESN'T require AS much work. No note-taking for 140 minutes in a row! er wait 150 since periods are 75 mins long each, and having that two periods in a row in the same room w/ the same teacher is pretty unappealing. So yeah..........watching the movie. AWESOME MOVIE if you people have never seen it. Seen the thing probably over 10 times already.  Lunch today went out like usual. I couldn't really eat though. Wow first time I had no appetite at mealtime. *Cringes at that thought.* HOW?! I have no clue...but it got to the point where I gave Thompson one of my pancakes and Hermann a piece of toast. ME!? GIVING AWAY MY LUNCH!? Yeah it's unusual.....but I just had no will to eat today. *Shrug.*  Math class.....YES I DON'T FEEL AS BAD AS THIS MORNING IN HISTORY! So yeah I actually got to intake some KNOWLEDGE. AAAH I'M LEARNING! Started geometry.....my dislike in the math subjects. Why can't we do algebra? It actually makes sense. Who cares about.....ANGLES and LENGTHS OF SIDES and if a stupid triangle is CONGRUENT. I'd rather figure out what "a" equals to than looking at two ALMOST identical shapes, calling them CONGRUENT or NOT and then getting it wrong because I was off by half an inch or something. THEY'RE CLOSE ENOUGH. But most of all the funnest math unit......is probably BEDMAS. So useful and easy ^_^.  Programming.......BORING. That should basically be enough to say.  Stage Band X today.....actually we are beginning to sound decent. I'm actually beginning to like the sound we produce.......sometimes.  Ohh yes the bass trombone I play in Stage Band X.....shooooo shiny lol. It actually still looks like BRASS and not like PLASTIC.  Well when I got home......I drummed for an hour then watched TV. Then slept.  Now what am I doing? Well after finishing this blog I'm going to eat, then do homework, and then sleep. Senior Band tomorrow. OH YEAH also tomorrow MRS. WHARTON'S back to teach us! SWEET! No more Mr. McCumber I just remembered hahaha.  But anyways.......by day's end my mind's been cleared up from all the thoughts I had from last 3-4 days, and I just feel a lot better compared to this morning health-wise. So I'm cool for now. Lol Ada just told me she d/l all the pics off Martha's MSN group. Craaaazy........almost 70 pics haha. And now I'm off to dinner. Mmmm.........foooooood^_^. Later.

       3/21/04   Early Blog....there's sometin new   Blogging at 230?! From ME!? NOOOOOO WAY! Well yeah believe it....it's happenin' right now. Yeah today I'm gonna basically be cooped up in my house anyways.....drumming, h/w, etc etc. So much work to do today that I kinda shoved behind me from March Break. Then again who doesn't do that hehe. So yeah I'm officially settled back into my slow-paced hick life.....filled with loads of sleep, piano, drumming, and blogging. Of course though I'm gonna keep on pushin' on the goals I've set for myself at TC. But just from last night after I stopped blogging until even now....I'm still thinking of all the crazy stuff that's happened these past few days. I mean I felt God's presence just.....so much more I guess. Now I'm realizin' that before when I complained about God not being there for me or sometin', really it's just me being too ignorant to even stop and listen to anyone....including God. So yeah after realizing that today during church....I'm going to try to look around everyday for how God's done something for me each day in my blog....as I know everyday he provides me with something. I just hope that I can keep this goal and that this isn't a "spiritual high" aftermath.  Well today I woke up at usual time. Wow reflecting on your week until 3am isn't exactly MOST intelligent thing to do the night before church....but really cleared my mind. It was so weird though. While I was thinkin'......all these weird noises were coming out of my compy. Either I think too much of Silent Hill 3 (there was like a high pitched noise comin' from somewhere) or yeah sometin' weird was goin' on. Well I guess I was thinkin' at the time maybe it was time to go to sleep. So yeah headed upstairs....and then decided to read Psalm 23 tonight. I guess I'm kinda going off track with my devos.....but sometimes I just like to read the Bible on my own and not follow guidelines. So after waking up this morning.......I had a quick breakfast then ran out the door. Picked up Jason and then English Service here I come!  Today was pretty interesting for english service. Well before anything else Calvin and Carmen are on a two-game losing streak for ushering. Showed up late both times. Yeah I do realize I'm still on a hockey aftermath from the "Spiritual hat-Trick" thing but meh I like hockey....and it does kinda make sense. Sorta. Maybe. Somewhat.....Anyways point is me and Gavin had to take over for ushering today. English service saw a new dude come in. Think his name was Greg dun really remember. But yeah hope that dude keeps on comin. Service today also took a different route.....we had TEAM Missionaries come in and speak to us.   The speaker, who's name was Charlie, spoke about well.....missionary work today. He read from Acts chapter 1, and the memory verse for this week I find pretty cool. It reads:  "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."  By the way that's verse 8. So from that one line the speaker Charlie was speaking about how missionaries should be witnesses all the time anywhere. Sadly I was kinda falling asleep from lack of sleep last night....so I went downstairs and slashed some water on my face to wake me up. I felt alright after that. After the sermon though.....Ali who was doing song of response w/ worship team went up and read the EXACT verse I was thinkin' about. The verse is Isaiah 6:8, which reads:  "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"   I remember that verse as last year for TC 2003 I was in team Isaiah, and that verse was our "key" verse I guess you can say. But yeah I did some thoughts on it a while back, and I just find it pretty cool how Isaiah was already so enthusiastic about doing such works. Heh these few months have shown me so many people that sacrifice so much to get to know God. I feel as though God is telling me "Joe, you can still sacrifice much more." I really do believe in that....as this is why I am beginning to improve my prayers and increase the time spent on devos. Oh yeah Carmen and Calvin managed to make it for offering part of their ushering task though. Least they made it. Better late than never as they say.  After service.....well my SECOND bag in FOUR DAYS broke. The strap on this one broke piece of crap lol. I hopped off of the stage and *snap.* Lucky I have a spare strap. On my TIME bag the strap was still intact, but the ring for the strap broke. So yeah I've been havin' pretty bad luck w/ duffel bags last few days. But now time for class =P.  Class today we listened to the Len Nation's story of his life. Wait I think his first name was Len. Well anyways the speaker was talking about how he ever came about to becoming a pastor and pastoring at a church. Apparently he was raised in a pretty crummy area, his parents divorced, and he just never had a decent childhood. High school he was basically the school bully, narc dealer and booze hound. But after this one even that happened.....the gov't put him into a juvie program that forced him 4000 miles away from community and they had to climb the Rockies. Basically each day was military training, and then one day.....a huge glacier avalanche came down. A barrage of snow, ice, and debris started hurtling down the hill, and him and the other juvies ran to take cover. He happened to find a big indent to hide behind for cover, and he said that as he was sitting there with all the stuff flying by he felt and pictured God "holding him by the neck with a dagger in other hand." But....after that....God just stood back....like backed off, as though forgiving him and giving Len mercy. See all Mr. Nation's life he's been doing everything possible against God as he hated him, but when God seemed to still forgive him, Mr. Nation was just so amazed at God's Grace. Pastor Mackness said that it's almost like the Song "Amazing Grace," which talks of Christ even saving a wretch like the composer. So yeah i've met some pretty cool people last few days. Pastor Bartha was just an amazin' speaker @ TC (like the story of how someone was almost 'bout to kill him but backed off when Bartha said if he died, then his word would spread even faster from the fact someone would kill him for that), Sumair for his amazin' story about how he came to Christ, and today Mr. Len Nation for basically giving us his testimony. Craaaazy stuff, but cool.  Well yeah that is basically the highlight of my day. For the rest of my day, I'm gonna be doin' the homework I've held back and just drum around. Not much variety of stuff but it's gotta be done. So yeah......until later.....Lates.

       3/20/04   Spiritual Hat Trick By Christ himself   OK.....well after TC 2004....you know....especially this year as I had mentioned before I feel re-dedicated and refreshed. God already showed me so much this week. I'll basically go straight into the whole "Spiritual Hat-Trick" in a moment.....but today was just so spiritually amazing. No wait....correction that this WEEK has just been.....so powerful. I was gonna say weird but earlier when I was talkin' to my dad he used the word "powerful," which I find MUCH more appropriate.  Well today sadly was the day I head back to London. *sigh* TC 2004, the chillin' in downtown T-dot, yeah it's all gonna be cherished for a while hehehe. I mean......just havin' bot hthe priviledges of Spiritual growth....and just havin a blast w/ some friends......yeah it's honestly some of the best times that I think you can have on this earth. So yeah.....we said our final good-byes and stuff, and headed out the door for our final subway ride down to Union Station for home. This morning I was really missin' TC lol.  Well before headin' out the door.....logged on MSN for a bit and checked my blog's g-bookie. It's CRAZY how small this world is. Apparently the counselor that helped me re-dedicate......is none other than Gerty's Cousin! Waaaaah.........Daniel Trinh and Gerty are related!? NOOOOOOO WAY! And then also....I found out that Jesse Wong apparently knows one of Jenn's friends. And then she told me that Jesse's girlfriend goes to TCBC. Wow what a small world just thinkin' about it now. My old HYPE counselor somehow knows Jenn lol. Er Jenn's friend. And Gerty's cousin helped me get my life back on track? Incredible. So cool though =P.  But yeah....got a drive from Dave's parents to the Subway stop.....and then said our Thank-You's and stuff and then headed downstairs. Stupid Toronto subway. I thought I got stuck in the revolving doors. I was going through VERY slowly through the door w/ my gargantuan bag when I hear a *click* and I'm thinkin "There's no friggin way your lockin' on my ya piece of crap." Thankfully it was a false alarm lol, but yeah it was pretty scary at the moment=P. But yeah then we headed to the train stop.....found Jason *we were a bit late but we lived* then quickly ran to the train. JUST MADE IT FOR BOARDING. Too bad all the group seats are taken *blast* but we managed to find some aisle seats near one another. However though this would lead me to a really weird thought later on...  Well as the train started headin' off, I started listenin' to music. Jason was already slowly dozin', Gavin was readin his TC booklet, and Josh I'm not sure of because he sat in front of me. I know though he did his devos because I saw him do his when I started doing mine. I haven't been using the ODB actually for a bit, and I'm actually gonna probably begin using the Purpose Driven Life devo book for the next well......40 days hehe. But today I just read Matthew 6, and just read over how to pray once again. To me honestly, prayer is probably like THE biggest thing. Just the idea of putting total faith on the Heavenly Father.....yeah that's why I think prayer is one of the most powerful things out of all the things to do for a Christian. So yeah I am finding the Lectio Divina method of doing devos pretty effective. i'm really startin' to sometimes really be able to just PICTURE the exact happenings of the stuff written in the Good Book. So did my Devos in about 40 minutes....yeah I find long time devotions really is effective. I did it last night too....read Acts chapter two about when the Apostles started to talk in different languages all of a sudden after being filled with the Holy Spirit. So yeah I guess TC did effect me a hefty bit this year. I just hope that it lasts on until....well.....ever hehe. Well yeah just finished devos and......PERFECT TIMING! Lunch =P.  Mmm.....Ham and Cheese sandwich. The marvelous talent of VIA cooks =P. Gavin payed for my meal since he owed me $$$. So his 7 dollar debts been paid.....and Josh still owes me 2.50 hehe. David still owes me 15 bucks from bus tickets lol. So yeah it was a pretty good lunch. Gave my peanuts to some dude sitting beside me. Pretty cool guy though. We chatted a bit about few things. UT2K4, gaming, even a bit about religion. Was kinda interesting to see him having a Muslim Qo-Ran. So I asked him if he was Muslim. Apparently he's Catholic....just readin Qo-Ran for more knowledge. Kinda intersting though....I sorta wanna get to know other religions better though too. So after that I then started to listen to my music for.......hmm.....30 minutes or so. Oh yeah really weird....I think I saw my careers teacher in the train too =S.   Actually one thing that kinda got me thinkin' on the train today was my devo. See....there's always people saying how the Bible's "contradictory" but honestly I have never seen it happen before. Well today I ALMOST thought that with the line "don't pray like the Gentiles do." Thing is though...I am a Gentile. I'm a non-Jewish Christian. However....as I kept thinking about it....it did make sense in the end. I mean....it's sorta like how if you read something saying something like "don't program this program like the humans did." However, you're a human being. A Person. But, you can still change your way from how the previous humans programmed.  It's like how I'm a Gentile Christian.....but I don't do what the Gentiles do in Prayer. Get it?  Well after chattin' for a bit n' stuff, FINALLY LONDON ONTARIO. Blast. I was actually kinda sad too because now I'm officially 200 kilometres from Toronto. Crappage. Well got a ride from Gavin's parents......and off to home I went.  Home.....basically I sat in front of the comp chattin' to TC kids, reorganizing comp, and just lookin at the 97+ pics I took while on vacation hehehe. Wonder how I'm gonna get these developed lol. So talked to TC kids, and then this was where the Spiritual Hat-Trick came in.  I used the term "Hat-Trick" as first I'm a hockey fan and I felt God has majorly showed me three amazing things this last week. First one: gotta be the craaaazy dedication that I saw my counselor Sumair have from being a "sorta" Muslim guy to a devoted Christian. I was wowed by how he became one. He had to just go through so much toil, and arguments at times to get to his goal. But I really praise the Lord for lettin' him receive the prize. So yeah that was the one big first thing that hit me. So that's One "Goal."  The second feat that God showed me of himself was the WHOLE TC 2004 day two. First thing that was when I re-dedicated myself to God....and I was just almost in tears in seeing so many people either re-dedicating or dedicating for the first time. Really felt a warm feeling in my heart. And also just the final worship......when I prayed for most of it....and just reflected.....wow so much happened there. I doubt I'll be able to describe it in blog....but it was just sometin' that I never felt before. I mean....I just felt the Holy Spirit just take over me and seem to say "Welcome back Joe into God's arms."  And also after Gavin's talk today about how he felt demons and stuff during worship.....real deep stuff but really makes me think twice about why I'm so priviledged to know Christ. It's also crazy how Gavin felt it during worship....just shows how powerful Satan's presence can be....yet be defeated by Words of God when Gavin prayed for it to leave. So yeah that was Goal #2.  Now the 3rd one. This one is a bit weird. I mean it started off with a debate w/ Josh on whether d/l music is cool or not. Now personally up until now I still don't consider it "stealing" but he did. So we kinda got into an argument *details not included* and then in the end I kinda ended with a "Alrite I'll stop d/l music if either God or the Artist tells me to stop." Well....this sentence I think kinda cornered me as God would show me at fellowship. See today we had a workshop on "descision making" and how the four main things that affect it are:  Values Virtues Variables Vision  So yeah.....I was thinkin' "wow....these things are basically the things I was goin' through my head when I was debating with Josh." Now though.......I don't know for sure if God's tellin' me to stop d/l music though....cuz I mean....I'm not exactly selling it for myself, I'm just d/l em for my own musical appreciation.I guess I kinda live by the sense that music is like art. Josh actually came up with this analogy. Art if you like it can be sketched for appreciation. So basically well I basically just download the music for appreciation. So up until now....I'm still a bit confused, but as the night is going by *it's 1am now* I think I'm starting to get a clearer vision of this. I mean.....I guess I've been livin' by the whole idea of "private use is OK" sorta thing. But I think I'll be buyin' CD's soon anyways. But yeah......I guess it just made me think today...."God REALLY does speak when you challenge him." So yeah.......think I'm gonna be thinkin' twice before I type now. Just how direct and how quickly The Lord answered me....wow. Thanks for the eye-opener God.  Well.......actually come to think of it Christ scored more than 3 goals this week. There was also the very strange thing of how my workshop got switched.......but it was switched for the best. Originally I was gonna take a workshop on relationships and another on Music and Evangelism....but in the end the Music one got cut off....which left me with none other than....."Give me Oil in my Lamp." This workshop was for the best though. I now really know what "doing my devos" really means....er wait what was the other word I used before....socializing w/ Christ? That works hehe. So yeah and also....I am now beginning to fix up my prayer. In fact I tried it out today.....and I was amazed how fluent my prayer went. It was as though the Holy Spirit was actually in me.....speaking out of me word for word. So yeah.......put it this way forget the hat-trick thing. What's someone who's scored more than 12 goals in one game called =P.  As for the rest of fellowship tonight......well after the little Missions Presentation we got from a group of missionaries, HYPE had their own little meeting about TC. Junior one really seems watered down from the previous ones. I guess removing the workshops really had sometin' to do with it. But yeah Steph seemed to have a cool week back in London too w/ her dad. And then the seniors (me, Gavin, Josh, Brian and Jason) had LOTS to say. So yeah we took up about an hour. Talked about so much. I mean just some things I remember off the top of my head.....  Well Josh talked about the vision of heaven that he had a while ago. Thing is though this time he was tellin' us about how he afterwards prayed for each of us to either experience or envision God in another way. Surprisingly without me knowing......it happened. That dream I told you about a while ago about my church growing? Well...see these were all never on our prayer request lists......yet we somehow seemed to mentally communicate. And Gavin............he's really been experiencing so much. That little dude can take in a hefty bit of stuff in a few days. I mean....if his seeing the Spiritual Realm gift is true......wow he's got lots of courage to use it. So yeah today I've been stunned, confused, amazed, and just recognizing God's power all at once. So much has happened.....I think that tomorrow morning *Sunday* is one Sunday that I truly need to clear up my mind. I mean today in fellowship I wrote so much.....my booklet I got from TC looks like a collage of graphite. We talked alot also just about how TC seemed to connect us back to our HYPE lessons too (Spiritual Gifts one mainly) and how it's affected us. This is actually pretty cool how these last few days seem to go so well......it's like the total opposite of my windmills=P. Oh yeah also....Josh talked about his little talk w/ Lily about religion. Well apparently that has now spurred Josh into tryin' to look into Buddhism and see what makes them tick. I just hope that Josh knows where he's goin.....same w/ Gavin and his Spiritual Gift.  From all this thoughI'm really startin' to have a new look on pre-destination. I don't know why....but all this seems to have been set up perfectly. It's like putting a sports play into action and working 100% smoothly. I mean Workshop change, the message Pastor Kirk gave, Josh's prayers.....too good to be random. So yeah...these few days.....I really have had lots of reflecting time. And I'm thankful I had the  time....just so much to think about.  Well after the long discussion......got some forms n' stuff for gym nite....and then went into groups for prayer. Me, Gavin and Carmen got put together into one group. I actually liked it though. I mean the talk we had.....about Spiritually preparing for battle and how to be careful of using our gifts....really cool stuff. But yeah just hope they are careful with it and use it with the right aim. So yeah this was when I prayed.....the most fluent prayer......I had ever heard myself speak. So yeah....this was a great note to end on from the whole week.  So yeah.....I gotta be headin' to bed. Lol me and Karen have been postin' pics up on Martha MSN Group (http://groups.msn.com/m-a-r-t-h-a) so yeah I've been kept busy for a while hehe. Well I'm out for the night. But just thinkin' back on all the stuff that's happened......I mean TC 2004, the talk at fellowship, and the somewhat ongoing debate in my mind about d/l music. Still though I think I'll still be d/l music....but honestly not as frequent. Also I may start to be buyin' some WOW Worship CD's. But yeah....this week has just been awesome. I'll be bloggin' more tomorrow....since I'm gonna be a bit of a hermit doing all my h/w hehehehe. So yeah I'm out kids. Later.

       3/19/04   Downtown Toronto=Fun =P (though we got lost for 2 hours =P)   So last day in Toronto.....yeah it was pretty cool. Sadly it's the last day of March Break though.....and also the last day of me spending time in T-dot. Ugh Monday......back to stinkin' school. This March Break has just been too much fun. I got reminded of school again when David was  complaining about the 2 pages of math homework he has for this March Break. Sadly I have homework too. Ms. Manson gave us a flippin' history PROJECT basically on Hitler's propaganda in Germany, plus a science lab and my Bio project still. Argh Sunday I'm gonna be cooped up inside doing 3 projects blast. Oh well least I had my fun this March Break. TC 2004, Chillin' around in London, and of  course runnin' around Downtown Toronto like typical tourists lol. So yeah this March break was pretty awesome. I liked it a lot at least....don't know about the others about walking in circles in T-dot=P.  Well our plan to wake up at 10 kinda got scrapped when no one cared about the alarm clock and headed straight for bed for another hour. So yeah nothing from there till then =P.  *One Hour Later*  11AM!? Uh oh....we were supposed to be gone by now but we have just woke up lol. So yeah we kinda started getting ready slowly. Played some G-Cube, Talked on MSN, and tried getting some TC kids if we found any to come to Toronto too. Unfortunately everyone was already doing stuff......or too lazy so in the end it was the original people: Me, Dave, Josh, Gavin and Jason.  Now we WERE supposed to leave at ASAP....but the ASAP turned into a LONG TIME after it took us about 30 mins to get bus tickets. In the end I ended up getting a ride from Dave's mom to Dominion to buy them......and then went back to the house and we headed out for the bus stop. Wow......our morning started off bad. After getting the tickets......we still screw up when David forgets where the shorcut to the bus stop is lol. So we ended up walking an extra.....hmm 30 minutes or so and then FINALLY got to the bus stop after taking a few unecessary turns. Amazingly no one complained. Me and Dave were still pondering on where the shortcut was.....and Gavin and Josh I think were talking about their TC experience. So yeah it was pretty well....quiet walk lol. Well afterwards.....after about 40 minutes we FINALLY managed to get to the bus stop....then waited for another 20 minutes for the bus. WHOO! SUCCESSFUL! WE HAVE MADE IT THROUGH STEP ONE!  Now.....off the bus and off to the subway. THIS is the complicated part. Up until now I don't know if we were supposed to pay, get a transfer, or not bother to do anything and just hop on the subway. So I did choice 3. Nothing happened so I guess that it was ok lol. I think we were supposed to get a transfer but I didn't really care since bus driver was a smurf. I was kinda peeved but we still got to our aim location: The Eaton Centre. But.....we didn't get there at the aim time....we were 30 minutes late lol. Oh yeah but while on the Subway....Today was the day Gavin actually discovered London has no subway, though he's been livin' in the hicktown for over 10 years:  Gavin: This is my first time on a subway...pretty cool Joe: Heh yeah HK's subway way cooler though. I've been using subway a lot in HK, Montreal and stuff. Gavin:Is there one in London? *Josh and Joe just look stunned* Josh:*ehem* Yes Gavin London has a subway system using every Mac's variety store as a subway stop. Gavin: REALLY!? How come I never knew about it?! *Joe and JOsh just look at each other amazed at Gavin's stupidity* Josh: Yes Gavin....all you do when you go to Mac's is ask the store manager for a key to the back, and then you open a door, go down a few flights of stairs, and there you are London's premier Subway System. Gavin: Uhh.....*kinda doubtful look* are you sure. *Joe and Josh just shake their heads with a 'Gavin your an idiot' expression* Gavin: Aww nuts....*slaps himself*  yes.......probably biggest blonde moment on this vacation lol. Amazed it happened in the aftermath of TC. Also sadly Josh was the one that explained it and he's been livin' the least amount of time in London and knows more than Gavin lol.  So when we got there....first thing we had to do was find Jason. So no sign of him at subway where we were gonna meet, so we went to EB since we thought he'd be there. After realizing this is the most pathetic idea, we decided to call his cell. And yes he was pissed off lol. Threatened to cut off his leg and hit us with it. "Ok go for it Jason...." He kinda just thought about it then lol. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea huh Jason =P. Well after that we headed down to the food court for some lunch.  Jap or A&W? Hmm....Root beer owns Jap so A&W it is =P. So we ate lunch......very "nutritious" meal of a teen burger combo =P.  So after the eating.....we kinda just roamed around the mall for a bit. I really wish I lived in Toronto. Eaton Centre is actually such a crazy mall. First off there were breakers today sineit was like Busker week or something where random people could just volunteer to take some time and show off something *music, dance, anything) and just to bring a crowd. The breakers were decent. One had a roll-back Hollowback and another one had a spinning airchair. Then there was this horrible group of chicks doing a crappy Choreoed Dance. *Shudder* wow did it suck. Looked at it for 'bout 10 secs then left lol. Places we went to today....mostly places like Athlete's World and Foot Locker and stuff. Oh yeah had to buy a new bag since my Time Magazine one broke lol. So yeah now I have a new duffel bag =P. And also Head Quarters....AMAZIN place for hats lol. Bought two new hats, and also......my now treasured......NOWITZKI JERSEY! Not a authentic but meh still alrite =P. One of the 70 dollar Reebok ones. For some reason though Sport Chek was selling NY Rangers Jerseys for more $$$ than Jerseys w/ player names. Maybe because Rangers is Authentic Jersey. Oh wait wouldn't that be worth 10 bucks then =P.  So after spending time at the Eaton centre.....well we decided to walk around downtown Toronto. Now unfortunately we didn't make use of our TTC day pass much, and ended up circling around downtown Toronto not knowing where we were headed lol. I find downtown Athlete's World near very end which kinda sucked *blast.* Grrr...Yes and I manage to get all the blame for going nowhere in one and a half hours. Whoo. How nice of them=P. But meh stuff like that always happens. I don't mind walking around downtown for over 3 hours but they're legs were hurting....and Gavin was sorta feelin' sick he said. So yeah we ended up kinda just milling around random places...somehow ended up at Union Station and decided to leave for home (it's about 7pm already now). Jason left for his Raptors game around 6pm and we WERE gonna go to Mopicks, but since Gavin' wasn't feelin' well we all agreed to go home....or at least some place closer  to home to eat. Oh yeah on a side note.....bumped into Paul Nielsen today. Weird.....never expected to see anyone from London. Crazy how I saw him in a city of 5,000,000+ people. Said our heys then kinda left, since I think he was catching a train and I was trying to run back to Gavin Josh and Dave.  Now back on the subway. Subed up to Fairview and had dinner there. Mmmm.....Taco Bell. I know it can be gross at times but it is still a decent place to go to. The whole day today though.....has been filled with TC talk. None of us can even try to get the thoughts of the great times we've had this year. I mean the spiritual growth we all had, meetin' new friends, and just catchin' up with old friends from previous TC's......yeah unforgettable times. Just wait'll TC 2005.....I'LL BE A CAPTAIN *hopefully* MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I won't say much about trip home....other than the fact I finally figured out how the Toronto Transit system WORKS. SHWEET! Next year I won't look as big of a tourist, even though I already did look like one for a while @ TC when I was carrying around some of my group's bags and carrying like 3 cameras at times lol. So yeah just wait till the summer boys n' girls.....I won't look as Touristy as before =P.  Well for now.....this was basically my day. Slept, Chilled in Downtown, and then headed home. These last three days have really been a blessing. For Wednesday and Thursday.....God once again has forgiven me.....and now I'm a re-dedicated follower of Christ. Somethin' I really needed to do. Thanks a lot God....MAAAD Props. And Friday.....just a day of relaxin' and seein' what Toronto really has to show about itself. Yeah Toronto was pretty cool once again. Summer I hope the times will be just as chillin' when we get a Martha reunion set up. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT MARTHA.....REUNION IN SUMMER K =).  So yeah I'm probably gonna spend my few final hours in Toronto now packing, just chattin' wit people from TC on MSN, and of course play a bit of G-Cube and just talk with Josh and em. So until tomorrow's blog.....where I'll be in Home *not so sweet but still alright* home....the L-Dot. Londontown. L-Unit. Little England....Poser Toronto....you get the point we are probably the unknown big city in Canada lol. But yeah today was fairly interesting.....chilled....and we totally lost our sense of direction....to the point so bad East was officially unofficially West. Like I said we really needed to take in our direction senses in for a tune-up.  Anyways yeah I'm out for the night. For now I'm gonna just chill w/ my final hours here.....and then sleep and get ready for the big trip home tomorrow=P. So yeah once again....Shout Out to all TCers and.....yeah guess that's it hehehe. Keep on growin' in Christ kids.  Lates=P.

       3/18/04   TC 2004: Re-dedication in my life...I am reallly thankful for making it to Day 2    This year.....I MADE IT TO DAY 2! No projectile Vomiting (YES!) and I think this was all totally set up by the Lord this year. I mean, I've never had such a feeling of Christ being in me to make me re-dedicate my life. I mean sure I've been going to church, and praying and doing devos (somewhat poorly but I'll catch up), today really marks a pretty special day in my life compared to last TC or even yesterday at TC.  Today was a bit more reaxing for me. I mean, no waking up at 730, and today I got to wake up at 8 ^_^. Basically Gavin dragged me out of bed today, so yeah I trudged upstairs, had a breakfast of pizza again, and then did daily morning routine and headed out the door for TC day 2.....a day that will be in my mind for a LOONG time.  Day started off with worship today, where my group unfortunately had to sit in the back *grrr.* Oh well we are still all worshipping the same God, just that I like sitting near the front better. So yeah worship today was like yesterday, a big greate blast of warm air into the sanctuary as 700+ Christian youths are worshipping the Lord. It was great and all....but honestly sometimes it seems like a show more than worship when people start turning into a mosh pit at times. But overall I mean the atmosphere is VERY welcoming and I can see why non-Christians would be so convinced to turn to Christ after going to TC. Honestly I think that the praise time at TC really gives you a Spiritual shot of Caffeine as both days I have been attentive in the sermons....which I find interesting...being I woke up ounly like 1 hour ago =P.  Sermon today was about the gospel of John. Actually mostly the 1st chapter. Verses 1-34 if I'm not wrong. But yeah it was speaking of the Word of God with the famous line "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Verse 1 of John by the way. So yeah he spoke about that, and about the life of John the Baptist....well when he was baptizing people in the Jordan and baptized Jesus and how he came to fortell the coming of Jesus. I was actually keeping track in my Bible and everything....very exciting ^_^. Though I knew the story fairly well, but re-reading it always brings something new up, which I'll talk about more in the evening when something just shot a HYPE memory back in my head. The main thing though about the morning sermon....was that I re-dedicated my life to Christ. Pastor Bartha had this analogy of sin as a dead, roadkilled raccoon. You take it then wear it under your shirt. No one can see it, but they can sense it (smell, and just by attitude in reality) and also you feel pain ("the raccoon is now rotting and eating at your skin" quoted from Pastor Bartha) of the sin. So after he said that, I just thought of all the sins that I kind of just quickly asked for forgiveness, then shoved it into the back of my mind. So after this sermon.....I really felt that Christ brought me to TC here for a true reason. In fact after the sermon and Pastor Bartha called for the people who wanted to either re-dedicate or dedicate their lives for the first time for Christ to go up to the front (altar calls), I went up. Really was a great feeling. I just felt so Spiritually cleansed right at that moment, with all those sins I had been shoving in the back of my mind just washed away. Afterwards they also took us up to the chapel for a small talk, where I met Daniel Trinh.  At first I thought I was in the wrong place. But afterwards, with some talking, I finally really realized....this was the perfect place I had needed for more than 3 years. Just the fact that the counselor I had (Daniel) was pretty open, and he was in the same situation as me. He said he re-dedicated over 3 times in his life already, and that it is hard to keep up a good Christian life. So yeah I really felt that God's presence was in there this morning, as I just felt so Spritually cleansed after the talk and  the sermon. So yeah....Daniel Trinh if you ever get to read this Props man...and thanks. My life's back on track now.  So after that.....hmmm I lost my bag. Uh oh lol. Lucky I was re-united w/ it afterwards since Matt actually took it since he thought I forgot it. But yeah s'all good....I found my bag afterwards ^_^.  So yeah after losing my bag, I went to workshop somewhat unprepared now since I lost all my stuff lol. Yeah I had to grab a new booklet and everything, and I was a bit late too (oops=P.) Workshop we learned about prayer today. A well-known subject that has so much related to it that re-learning it over 100 times still hasn't hurt. In fact it's helped me a lot, since I finally got some pointers on how to make my prayer life better/Devo life. For example, I'm gonna try to do Devos at a better time now and actually spend more than 5-10 minutes, and also for Prayer I'm going to begin to learn how to pray for more than just people I know and me. Also starting today I've learned that I must listen a LOT MORE for God. So yeah I think the two booklets from my workshop (Give me Oil in my Lamp) are gonna be used throughout this year a hefty bit....at least until I make it a routine to do the goals I wanna do =P.  After workshop it was LUNCH!......wait No it wasn't. I thought it was but then Jason told me it was interaction time.........so starvation for another hour lol. But interaction was cool. Sumair answered some of the questions asked last day about Christianity and about God. He got people to chip in opinions about each one....and yeah I chipped in one or two since I normally am a debate/talking person hehe. But yeah interactions was pretty cool. But reminder that only 2 left=(.  Lunch was A LOT COOLER today. PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNEW EACH OTHER SO THERE WAS TALKING! NO WAY! Yes way lol. Even though we still had sandwiches which I'm not a fan of, it was just cool to be able to talk to more people since everyone was so much more open. Also I got a funny pic of lunch time, and also of the dreaded lunch lol. It was pretty cool time actually. I also talked to Gavin, J,Dave, Gerts and Jenn too. Oh yeah and also got to start talkin' to Gerty's friend Joy, who was in my workshop. REAL cool girl. Shouts =P. And yeah lunch was pretty much that, just our group gettin tighter w/ each other and also meetin' some new people outside of my group =P. But even w/ that....GO TEAM MARTHA AAAH!  FAMED REC ORIENTATION AGAIN! Except this time NO SEE-FU! HOW?! WHY!? So yeah when his "replacement" came BOOOOOOO! lol all jokes though. Lol oh yeah and of course the "translator" er assistant today, was imitating Golem lol. They had a cheap version of TC rec leader tryouts, it was pretty funny though. I personally liked yesterday's but today's was still good. Not much else just pure laughs hahaha.  Seniors got Rec time first, so the gr 10's got to do interaction. We did Bible study, and we were still revolving around the community lesson from yesterday at first. We had to get a skittle from one end of a line to another *two diff teams* with the spoons in our mouths and first team to make it to the other end wins. We lost =( but s'all good we still got Candy! Ada and Matt *our amazin' TC el Capitaines* fought over a gummie frog. Feel bad for Ada though Matt kinda just yanked it out of the bag lol....well sorta ripped it with the bag....hard to explain but the people that saw it........yeah it was funny lol. Also the study we did followed up on the Gospel of John sermon from this morning, and also listened to Sumair do the final follow up conclusion. Basically he told us of how to be completely honest w/ God....and gave us this acronym to remember it:  Honesty Open Direct  They all sorta mean the same, which is sorta like the Trinity of Christ. Jesus, God and the Spirit are KINDA the same, but are three different factions. But yeah this year's TC interaction Bible Study was GREAT. So Ada, Matt, Sumair....if you readin this....GREAT STUDY =). Though it seemed somewhat like you guys were winging it sometimes...GREAT improvising lol.  After the study came REC! We played electric fence (had to get someone across these two ropes in between the ropes) and also this thing where we had to all of us make a certain "machine" out of all the kids in our group. We made a lawn mower and washer and dryer lol. OOOOH yeah and then came the thing were we could only have this amount of certain parts of the body touching the ground (i.e. 20 hands, 10 feet and 2 elbows). That was like a diff version of twister. Fun though =P. Oh yeah then the dreaded "Step as many people on 16 or so blocks as possible and whoever gets the most wins." I thought piggy backing would be easy, so Karen hopped on....except yeah I was getting tired after 20 minutes lol. But yeah the game was kinda amusing, but tiring. And afterwards, when doing our cheer....my Time magazine bag broke. NOOOOOOOO MY BELOVED TIME MAGAZINE BAG! Hopefully I get another one =P or a better quality bag lol. But yeah lost that, but lucky I had my combo lock with me. So I made a makeshit clip with it lol. My bag hung lower than my knees now though but  doesn't matter....it still worked...sorta lol. We actually did pretty well, and we were against....SILAS lol. Kinda embarassed myself when I tried to clap w/ Karen's feet lol. Gavin Dave and Jenn just gave a pathetic "Joe you suck" sorta nod and I sat there going.....aww crap lol. So yeah SORRY KAREN lol.  Then after REC came TC Media. This time I managed to stay awake through most of it. SHWEET! I mean the presentations are REALLY good, just that even @ school I always fall asleep after lunch. Also Rec kinda got me tired out =P. But yeah today the main theme I got out of it was the "Multiple Personalities" part. It was sorta Malcolm in the Middle style, with the person talking to us, and then to the play, then to us again. It was pretty cool, and moving. Like the one about how one girl's dad passed away, and how everyone seemed to overtreat her now, more than before just because of that. Also the one where two people kind of met through the same situation *they were both doubtful of their friends* and then became fast friends at a bus stop. The story is more complicated but I'm sorta zooming by because it's over 1am and also I still gotta cover another half of the day lol....the most exciting half of the whole TC. So after the media, we went to our FINAL interaction of the day *sigh.* These are the times when I wish TC lasted the whole week. I would get to know people so much better. Then again TC is about knowing God more....and the friendships I can make on the side =P.  Interaction 3.....basically just chillin'. REAL chillin. Me and Arthur started sessionin outside (breakdancing) and yeah he's not that bad for breakin' less than a year. I kinda hit crickets....and I need to work on my nike's now lol. Other than that we also passed around our booklets (for me paper pad since I forgot booklet=P) and just gave our emails, contact ways, and also words of inspiration. I kinda forgot my booklet though and just asked for emails lol. Yeah by the end....I really got to know the captains pretty well. Matt and Ada made an awesome "crew" lol and also just the people in the group were pretty cool kids. Diana and Karen basically made my loud image look like a muffled bullhorn, and those two combined were....Loud. VERY loud. Arthur is another B-boy, Gloria Vikki and Jenny were hilarious, and Clarence...though he was weird he reminded me of....me:  Clarence: *Takes out a wooden pole* MACHINE GUN *bak bak bak* Joe: *look at him with a stunned look* Someone's more retarted than me?! Clarence: Guess so.  Yeah when you take out a wood pole from the team banner and use it as a machine gun...you know you have problems lol. Oh yeah and Louis (one of Dave's friends in my group) was hilarious lol. "UGLY!" "UGLY!" and then we started smacking each other  and then punching lol. Yeah my groups is pretty crazy group. Then for group pics. Mine is a bit unique....GOT IT FOB STYLE lol. Just before the REC leader was 'bout to use my cam, I just yelled "EVERYONE FOB STYLE" and everyone put out the peace sign lol. AMAZING group of kids hahahahaha. Props to all who read this and are part of TEAM MAAAFFAAAAA! lol. Lets see what else happened.....someone hid Arthur's shoes, stole some of Lazarus' food *whoops lol* and Diana is apparently an AMAZIN pianist. How come all Asians play the piano I sometimes wonder. Must be a cultural thing now....  Dinner time.....Well no cardboard pizza from rumours....BUT CHINESE TV DINNERS! Wow never knew they existed but yes they do. Dinner wasn't that great....food was bad but MOST CHATTING IN WHOLE TIME. Day two wasn't filled with too many of my trigger happy camera pics...but got a few funny ones. Yeah confirmed with Jason we chillin' tomorrow @ Eaton Center, and also just last minute contacts/chats with Martha dudes/dudettes and of course people from other groups like usual =P. Met some people from Silas, and also became pretty fast friends with Joy. Good times good times hahaha. Wow I feel tall though...not that I'm bragging =P. But honestly some Asian chicks lose like 5 inches when not wearing shoes lol *not that I'm including you Gerty or Joy =P.* *Sigh* yeah but these times are cherishable moments. Even last year.....dinner was unforgettable...for day 1 lol. Talked a lot more to everyone, and everyone was just so open....and loud lol. I kinda threw out half my TV dinner, and chatted more instead and of course PHOTOS!=P. But yeah after the more socially scrumptous meal...Final Worship/Praise=). This was both a happy time (amazing praise and worship) but also saddening at times as this was actually like THE final time I'll be seein' most of these kids until next year. WAAAH! lol. Up until now at home already I miss TC 2004 already lol.  So yeah before worship...REC presentation for Top Teams. Unfortunately Martha didn't make it =( but Congrats to Noah, Lazarus and Ezra for winning overall team awards. And of course Abel for winning the Spirit Awaard (Good Job Brian your team won an award! Represent LCAC lol). Just wait'll next year....Me and Gavin will own the team competition =P.  Final worship....honestly I didn't sing as much as I prayed. I mean actually final worship was MORE exciting than the first worship, but I honestly just felt it was the time to pray for everyone to leave TC with a grateful heart, and an evangelistic one. I mean Spiritual Highs are always an issue, and I mostly prayed about that, plus for myself also to be able to listen more to God instead of always asking and me always doing the talking. I also took a few pics of final worship, and a video or two hehe. But yeah truly unforgettable moment. And just the environment around me....just wow. I really felt the warmth of God surrounding me at the time also, as when I was praying, I just felt like an inner warmth beginning to take over. The Sermon focused on Acts Chapter 1 when Jesus left the world and gave us the Holy Spirit, and spoke of how the disciples went on to preach the word, as Acts is about the acts about the apostles. In the end Pastor Bartha was just basically summarizing the last two days, and also spoke of how he and his friends blew up a car when they were younger lol. But yeah the main message in the end of this to me...I don't know if it was but just to me....cuz it really hit me was Acts 2:4:  "All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. "  It hit me just because I remember the Spiritual Gifts workshop that HYPE did with us, and how learning other tongues was a gift and how sometimes people can just automatically preach in another language at any given time. Oh yeah which takes me to the original TRUE message *I think:* For the final message Pastor Bartha spoke much about sharing Christ w/out fear, and this is going to be something that will affect my life for sure. I just feel so much more open and ready to spread Christ's Word and also just seeing people like Jenn, Sumair and many others suffer so much more for Christ than me....really sets the max bar MUCH higher for me. For song of response.....well actually songS of response I prayed for most of it. Prayed about so much.....there's too much to name. One main one was about a dream I had a while back which I mentioned in one blog....the one about my church thriving just from people evangelizing and had nothing to do w/ church image? Yeah prayed about that plus the other dream which I have never mentioned and still won't. A little on the personal note and it was about someone and I dunno if they'd want me to mention it. But yeah I don't know why but all of a sudden I felt as though Satan had a part in that dream, as it was somewhat anti-Christian. But I prayed about it, and prayed for the Lord to please drive out any demons or old sins stuck in my head to be cleansed out, as most of my day has been revolving around that since I re-dedicated this morning. But yeah for the very end....I mostly meditated and prayed. I really just felt so open for it though. Great time....this is gonna be goin' down in my life history for a while.....since today really marked somethin in my Christian Walk w/ re-dedication. Once again Props Daniel...and Props God Jesus and Holy Spirit for allowing Dan to redirect me. Props for sure for that.  *Sigh* and the most moving part now. After all the thanking and final cheers....it was time to go. Said final good-bye's to everyone, and took a few final pics. Wow....such an emotional time. I can now see what I missed last year hehehe for day two. So yeah said final good-byes, chatted a few final chats w/ some kids, and then headed out the door with Dave, Gavin, Josh and  of course myself =P. But yeah....me and Gavin....LOOK OUT TC! WE BE BRINGIN' DOWN DA HOOSE NEXT YEAR hahaha=P.  So yeah now I'm home.....recalling TC moments....planning my Sunday where it's gonna be pure postin' pics and h/w. So like my Huntsville blog *this is probably gonna be goin in w/ my look back blog also* I have a few final things to say....  "When the dishes are done, All is washed away, and I simply Clean, Longing just to Broom, Something in your Room, That will bless your Home....  MARTHA  (Insert Evanescense theme here =P from Wake me Up)  What else to say....OH YEAH..... AAA MAAAFAAA! FOB PIC EVERYONE! And of course....GOD IS GOOD ALL THE TIME! AND ALL THE TIME.....GOD IS GOOD!  TC 2005.....wonder how that'll turn out =P. Lates to all. Props to all TCers....and mega props to Martha Cap's and Counselor and kids=P. LATES! KEEP IN TOUCH!  Lates.

       3/17/04   Drive to Toronto: 3.5 Hours. Sleep before TC: 5 Hours. TC 2004's First Day: Timeless   After a year, I sorta forgot how exciting TC really is. I mean at the beginning of the day I was somewhat tired, and the day did start off slow. But after interactions with our teams, and some rec games and then final worship.....wow. Yeah memories of TC 2003 are now being slowly washed away by new 2004 memories. Of course there are always the memories that re-occur every year. The meeting of new friends, TC Rec games and of course........"NO MACKING" lol. This blog might be a bit long, so grab whatever you need to read this. Chips, apples, peaches, pizza, I'll give you 30 seconds to order Chinese Food.  *30 seconds later*  Times up here it goes =P.  Well my morning started around 7:20am. Yeah I was REALLY tired when I woke up, mainly from Gavin and Josh waking up before me. The noise of footsteps....argh. So yeah I dragged myself outta bed and then headed upstairs for breakfast. Whoo. Leftover Pizza....hehe. So after a scrumptous meal of leftover pizza, some Orange Juice, and my regular morning routine, I got dressed, packed my bag for the day....then headed out the door. First thing I do.....I break out my D-Cam and start taking random pics and vids. Lol the car ride there was sorta amusing hehe. Decided not to blind anyone with the flash from camera today hehe. 15 minutes of riding in a car....yes all that can happen. No stupid stuff though most of us were pretty tired still from the morning wakey-upey.  Yeah so we got there around 8:45 or so.....didn't see Gerty or Jenn like we planned *lol crappy planning there* but I did manage to find Jason and Brian Wong. Gavin Dave and Josh were still with me. So we got our stuff, and apparently my name tag had almost been taken by someone else by accident. So we chatted for a bit before heading into sanctuary. As we were walking in.....FINALLY SEE SOME FACES I RECOGNIZE. Good old Gabe lol. First reaction when I saw him "GABE!" "YOOOOO!" from the both of us lol. Then I bumped into Jenn! Ok so I'm not at the wrong TC lol I finally see people that I remember from last year. Oh yeah then I saw lots of people from David's church NCAC. Louis, Desmond I think his name is and Jacqueline, Wendy's cousin. Oh yeah and right about now.....bummer I have an upset stomach lol. But I really believe God was with me for the day, as once I prayed for the pain to go away, during worship it left me. Amazing. So TC started off first with usual chatting w/ other people, and then TC RULES.  I know you must think I'm insane to think rules are amusing, but just the way they intro'd each rule was hilarious, with ways like:  -2 Fast 2 Furious ( don't be late) -The Matrix Pills (No drugs) -Freaky Friday attempt to jolt (No changing teams) -Tampon Commercial (for name tags lol hard to explain)  But yeah this year's I have to say was a lot funnier than last year's LOTR one. Sorry I'm not gonna explain how each one worked, but that alone would take a whole blog so yeah =P. After the exciting start with the Rules and the TC 2004 intro....came the high-energy praise & worship. Wow was it amazing. The drummer(ette) is CRAZY. And the guitarist is amazing too. Wow the team they put together this year was insane. The music seemed to hit a whole new level. With the energy surrounding us and just the great worship section they put together, wow that woke me up for the next two hours hehe. So after that high energy worship, we came to the message, which was spoken by Pastor Kirk Bartha of Waterloo Mennonite Brethren Church.  First message he was speaking about I unfortunately can't remember 100%, but the thing that probably hit me the most was the miracle that happened in BC for him. He went out to some rural town in BC, and preached to some First Nations people. Amazingly when he said he would pray for anyone, the first person that came up was this alcoholic student. So after some hard prayer, and determination from the student, he broke his drinking habit. In fact, his father was so amazed he became Christian also. Powerful story of evangelism and how miracles still happen these days. That really inspired me to evangelize more also, as it really seemed to show me how POWERFUL evangelism really can be, starting from one child and then spreading like wildfire to many others. He also talked a lot about himself, lots of funny stories from him heh. So after the message (which really whizzed by) we ended with a closing prayer and then.....WORKSHOPS! hehehe=P.  Yes....the workshop that I ended up in somehow was #19 which is a two day track. "Give me Oil in my Lamp" is the title, and basically the workshop was to help us put our Christian lives back on track, which I really needed. Heh funny though.....didn't think I'd know anyone until I started passing out books that I noticed someone:  Joe: *pokes person to give her booklet* Here's the Pile. Girl: Oh Thanks.....*stares weird look* JOE?! Joe: GERTY!? NO WAY!  So yeah that was basically how it happened lol. But yeah I didn't know it was her until after 20 minutes or so *slow huh lol.* The workshop I thought was really well done, and the speaker for our workshop who was also a pastor (Christine Lee) was pretty funny. She had lots of stories....like the one of how her husband joined a car club and to her they just "stand around" in parking lots Friday nights lol. I actually reallly find this workshop so far REALLY useful. So many things that I need to know once again, like how to do Devos more effectively. I think I'll be trying the Lectio Divina (Divine Reading) format or the "Three R's." But yeah apparently the speaker speaks even faster than me *it is possible* and we finished 20 minutes early. So I chatted around with Gerty for a bit, then met up with Gavin and David and picked up my TC 2004 shirt. So yeah by now I've taken probably 40 pics already, deleted a lot of crappy ones lol. And at lunch I'd take more pictures too ^_^.  Lunch was kinda weird. Last year we had interactions first so I knew some people by lunch. This time at lunch I didn't really know anyone, so yeah lunch for ALL OF US was pretty quiet lol. So I kinda shifted over to chat w/ Jenn for a bit, then Gavin and Dave. Couldn't find Jason or Gerty though. Lunch consisted of orange juice and a sandwich that resembles Arby's Sandwiches which I hate. Oh well ate it anyways, and then went to chat more until lunch table calls started hehehe. Yeah so groups did that for a bit and  then....OUR FIRST INTERACTION!  FINALLY TEAM MARTHA COMES TOGETHER. My group this year is SOO much different from last year. All grade 10's. Wow. And my two counselors this year are Matt and Ada. Funny people lol. One was stalked over MSn (Matt) and the other has slipped playing bowling (Ada). My counselor actually is really cool. Sumair was his name, and he was a Muslim before converted, which I find really cool. So for first interaction we played an icebreaker game...TWO TRUTHS AND ONE LIE, which I failed to be able to play lol. I said three truths instead of two lol. Then after doing that icebreaker game (we only got through half the group) we learned our team cheer. WHOO!. Actually ours is pretty funny. We start off in like a sappy remix of "Heart of Worship" and then all of a sudden after a 1 second pause we go straight into Evanescence's song that has that loud yelling dude and the lyrics go sometin like "WAKE ME UP WAKE ME UP INSIDE CAN'T WAKE UP SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING" and you get the point Evanescence sucks =P. Our cheer would also emerge victorious in the end as we are right now one of the top 9 teams =P. Then afterwards.....it was time to show off our skillful cheer, and also make some NOISE!  REC PRESENTATION! Hahaha another presentation of the rules.....this time we had a dude that would translate what Master "Wong" said in either poor broken English or Chinese lol. It was pretty funny. "I learn my english from Star Wars Yoda." Lol. Anyways yeah so they did a presentation, some pretty funny skits, and then REC TIME!  Rec included games of "Shape it Up" where we have to make shapes and never break our connections w/ our hands, volleyball w/ blue sheets to launch the ball and also running around tied up with toilet paper in our groups. And of course much yelling=P. Oh yeah my voice is slowly going by the second. OH YEAH the Scavenger HUNT! AMAZING! Had to do stupid things like throw in 10 shoes tied together, 4 belts tied together, or the 4 seperate keys. Hmm what else happened....LOL OH YEAH THE 6 MAN PYRAMID LOL. That was hilarious since Gavin just reminded me. We won in that too hahahaa=P.  After kicking the crap out of all the opposing teams in Rec, it was time for interaction 2. We had a Bible study for Interactions 2, and did skits of Genesis lol. Basically the creation of the world. My group ultimately failed miserably and improvised with reciting the thing basically with other team members poorly acting it out lol. We also got some snacks then, and also.....talking of course =P. Finished up 2nd half of Ice-Breaker too. Karen I think her name is wrote hers out and had them all prepared for her turn. Wow....weird lol.  TC Media. Now unfortunately all I remember is the MSN skit where people were talking over MSN about a certain issue, which was pretty funny, but after that unfortunately I kinda fell asleep lol. So yeah I don't really remember 2nd half that well =P. The MSN skit was pretty funny, but meaningful at the same time. Showed us that going to church is to praise the Lord, not to MACK hehe. Funny how TC emphasizes "NO MACKING" so much lol. Became a tradition. Even Tommy remembers it hehe.  And Dinner FINALLY. This was when more talking started since people finally got to know one another, and we've gone through two interactions already. But with that, I still talked to old friends too. Yeah chatted with Gerty and Jenn for 'bout half the time and then Jason, Gavin and them. Apparently Gerty and Jason are in the same group, and Jenn, Gavin, and Dave are in the same group. BLAST I'M ALONE. *shrug* meet new people =P. If it weren't for that I would've probably never met Vikki, Arthur, Wilfred, or a host of other crazy people hehe. Dinner was good. Chow Fan.... Mmmmmm. Sho good. Arthur spilled some of mine though *shakes fist* but lucky we get 2nds =P,though I didn't need it since I'm trying to prevent myself from projectile vomiting lol. Don't ask =P.  Then time for final interactions. Now this was when we heard about Ada and Matt's most embarrasing moments, but the main highlight was basically Sumair's almost-as-long-as-a-testimonial speech about how he came to Christ. I really enjoyed it though, and was amazed of how much he had to pull through and still believe so faithfully in Christ. It really raises the bar for me in being a follower of Christ, as Sumair could suffer through so much and still be so devoted. Props dude if you're reading this mad props.  Now we are nearing the end of the day *awww.* First off.......We find out the top 9 teams through the "Kung Fu Endurance tests." Yeah basically it was hilarious *ask others that saw it TOTALLY indescribable just plain HILARIOUS* and we find out.....MARTHA'S IN THE TOP 9 TEAMS WHOOO! Same as Josh's Hosea. Sorry Gavin Brian and Jason you guys are CUT =P. Jokes hehe. But yeah after that....came the most exciting praise and worship I've EVER experienced, but since all the energy was spent on that...I sorta fell asleep at the message whoops =P.   Sorry can't say much more about that, but I really need to get to sleep ehehe. Tomorrow I gotta wake up early once again for Day 2, and I really want to go to it this year lol. Anyways yeah but all in all, amazing day, and look forward to my Thursday and Friday blogs. They'll be just as exciting with my milling around Toronto. But for now....Lates=P.

       3/16/04   Trip To TO: VERY retarted (as in us lol)....FINALLY IN TORONTO WHOOOOO!   YES! After a three hour trip, and some very songs in the car (Gavin and Dave were singing Beer Bottles on the wall....they made it from 99 to -2) and struggling on the snow-covered 401.....I am now sitting on Dave's comp, hogging it to use to type in my blog. heeheehee shweeetness=P.  Well after the sleepover yesterday, which consisted of Stepmania, Gunbounding for Dave, and watching David get the crap scared out of him from Silent Hill 3 (a phone rang and it literally killed him lol). Also a few pillowfights, and just random talking, and me defending my TV from producing the horrific images of.........SHANGHAI NOON! (dun dun dun). So yeah the sleepover wasn't too bad, and it was pretty funny actually lol. I don't know  when the other two went to sleep yesterday night, but I slept at......thinkg 2am-ish? I dunno what the other two did. I just built myself a fort (very mature huh lol) and then went to sleep....  *This morning*  Morning didn't really start until 10:30am. I was the first to wake up out of all of us I think. Actually wait. I think Gavin woke up first because I awoke to him singing  urlLink  Milk and Cereal  . Yeah watch that you'll probably get a laugh or two out of it. And Holy Crap I'm lucky that that I posted as I just closed my window lol. But yeah I'm lucky I posted so it saved all of the stuff up until the Holy Crap. So yeah when we woke up, basically we ate lunch, cleaned up the family room from the wreck it was, and then I packed.....yes preparing for my 3 hour car ride out to Toronto in a REALLY big blizzard.  So yeah our car ride to Toronto. Me, Dave, Gavin and Josh. Yeah we go pretty insane after a while. The beginning of the car ride actually wasn't  too bad. Me and Josh just sat around listening to music, while Dave and Gavin were talkin' in the back. But after 5 mins David started listening to music also. *Shudder* Asian pop music hurts my ears.........usually. I dunno why, but I just don't like stuff like Sammi or Twins. But LMF isn't bad. So after about one hour of listening to music, well what else do people do going to Toronto? SLEEP. Duuuuuh.  *1 hour later*  Just passed Cambridge, and I'm still listening to music. I woke up to the sounds of Rapper's Delight the original one. NOT THE REDMAN VERSION, which really sucks. So yeah there was a traffic jam around Cambridge, and we sat around for a bit. This was when we started going insane. My thought about how teens go insane after 2 hours in the car proves correct once again. Here and Huntsville, both times after two hours or less we go insane. At Huntsville me and Hammond started having pillow wars, and here today......my attempt at drawing a smiley face turned into a almost satanic look lol, and Gavin and Dave started poking me to death after I punched Josh lol. Then after that I decided to listen to more music, in hopes of ignoring them lol. But then afterwards....after mass pokings, I notice the Ferrero Rocher chocolates didn't have the stickers...  Lo and Behold.....my back is now a gigantic Ferrero Rocher commercial. 18 stickers were stuck to my back, which led me to retaliate by failing to punch Gavin and Dave lol. Then....yes yet again another traffic Jam. By the way if you find most my blog revolving around my car ride.....IT'S BECAUSE MOST OF MY DAY HAS BEEN IN THE CAR. So with the traffic Jam, I started singing to the songs I was listening to, mostly trance and of course the Techno song by Strong Bad. Then Gavin and Dave, going even more mentally retarted, start to sing 99 bottles of beer on the wall. They managed to sing it for an hour, I know this as they started singing on the outskirts of Toronto and reached -2 bottles of beer on the wall (accompianment by me and Josh) by the time we reached Markham, where I'm staying. So after that, well we were all pretty dead tired. I was beginning to feel light-headed from all the singing, and also just the fact most of us were going retarted in the van also got us pretty light headed.  So yeah when we got into....er to Dave's house, I say to and not into as I couldn't fit in with 5 duffel bags. Rambo poser I realize=P. I even stood on the front doorsteps and did the (CCHK CCHK.....GUNG GUNG GUNG GUNG) and Josh with a look saying "Joe, you need to go to Ching San," AKA go to school in the small bus, or live in the Special Building where losers wear the "sane" stickers=P.  Anyways I'm out now....Dave's kicking me off the comp and I wanna go play GC. So until tomorrow where I may not blog (TC 2004!)......so I guess I'll say until either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.....ZING! BUNUNUNUNUNUUNUUUUNUNDUNDUNUDNUNUNUUNUh! Lates. *Ponk*

       3/15/04   Life as it is......the usual March Break day   Well one thing that's different today........I finally decided to get off my lazy butt somewhat and actually do something =P. I guess I feel.....lazy still. March Break feelings you know. But yeah I really can't wait 'till tomorrow now. Only bout 15 more hours....seems so short now when I think about it. I still remember typing out my blog on Saturday when I was really excited about well......March Break lol. I don't really know what else to say today.....I mean I lazied out for most of the day, since Dave was over we sorta ended up playing PS2 all day from 12-4:30, since people came over then for the big dinner tonight. Not sure for what but meh Big dinner means food and people comin' over to tear apart my house =P.  Aftermath of sleeping @ 230am: I woke up about 11am =P. Making the most of what I can with March Break, and sleep is always one element that can't be removed. So yeah I woke up around 2pm, and then...well....had lunch (mm..........pizza). Yeah today I couldn't really do much since most of the day I had to help prepare for tonight, where everyone just left. It was pretty amusing though tonight, but I'll fill you in on that later =P.  After lunch, well helped around the house, and when I could played SC lol. Dave was in the other room playing his True Crime file, and yeah that was basically what took up most of the afternoon. Yes I realize my afternoon sucked but meh it can be amusing sometimes watching someone play True Crime and just blowing up everything in their path =P. Also I drummed around for a bit, I really am thinking I need a drum teacher. I need to learn some better techniques and just work on my sticking. My power in each hand is still pretty uneven.  Then came 4pm. Yes people started pouring into my house. Lots of little kids (Priscilla, Heather, and their little posse) and some other random kids that I barely know. Then in kids around my age Josh, Gavin, and Wenders came. I doubt Wendy reads this anyways so she can't kill me when she sees Wenders in place of Wendy =P. So yeah we all pretty much just hovered around PS2, played NFSU, NFS Hot Pursuit II and Virtua Fighter 4 mostly. But after we got bored of the fighting, drunk fighter, crashing, shooting, poor driving and NOS, we then turned to the one and only scary (and I mean DAMN scary) game of......SILENT HILL 3. Not much to say on that.......I am still friggin scared @ the part I'm in at the game right now, so I won't play it till later on tonight. Hmm........yeah so we ate, chatted, hung around......and then........yeah they left. Gavin n' Dave are still here though, leavin' for T-dot 2morrow w/ Josh also. Rite now......Gavin n' Dave are exploring the twisted world of Silent Hill 3 lol. So funny watching Dave play though......he makes any serious video game seem like a retarted comedy lol.  Yeah I know this blog kinda sucks, but I really don't have a thinking mind right now, nor was my day extremely exciting. Also I can't stop thinkin' about how TC went for the Juniors. Last year's was awesome. Just hope it was the same this year. Well yeah...that's all I really have to say for the night. I'm out I guess.......this is my last entry before TC....so yeah Tuesday-Friday I may sum up in one big blog on Saturday. I'll decide......but hang tight people......I may be bloggin day by day still =P. Lates. Oh yeah on another note.......  I CAN LINK EXTREMELY UGLY WINDMILLS! WHOOOOOOOOO!

       3/14/04   2nd Annual HYPE Exec Meeting: Productive (Kinda at least=P)   First Sunday of March Break, and also the countdown still continues to TC 2004. Yeah I'm pretty hyped about it right now still, and just seeing how quickly time is flying by, wow. But yeah so far my March Break has been.........lazy. VERY lazy. So far it's consisted of sleeping, sleeping, and dreaming lol. I dunno why but I've always been fascinated with dreams. Who knows maybe my mom naming me in the hopes I'll be like the Joseph from the Bible has an effect to it =P. By the way I mean the Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat Joseph not the one that was with Mary. By the way if you don't know why I'm saying the 1st Joseph it's because he could fortell dreams, and the actual story does have a bit more sadness in it. But anyways, enough about that for now I guess....I'm not about to let go my whole life history =P. So yeah...to begin my March Break Sunday...  Today I had one of the strangest dreams I've ever had in my life. I mean, I don't even know if I should put it on my blog. I mean it was REALLY weird. I mean it wasn't really about me......it was about one of my friends. I don't know if I'll even share it with her. Oh well.....in time it may come out though but right at the moment I think I need more reflection about it than speaking out. Thing is though it's about.....well suffering for Christ I suppose. That's as far as I'll go for now......details may come later on in this blog when I feel I've done enough reflection. But yeah lately I've been having REALLY strange dreams. Unfortunately some exciting one's I can't remember *blasted short term memory grrrr.*  Well after that, since my dad was in the bathroom, I decided to go on MSN. and lo and behold Gerty was on. She told me she knew of the plan of meeting up @ TC by recognizing me wearing........A BRIGHT GREEN SHIRT?! I said GREEN not BRIGHT GREEN JENN! Lol so yeah after going through that confusion....well yeah now it's final......YOU'LL SEE A DUDE WEARING A HAT, GREEN ADIDAS SHIRT.....AND HAVE A TIME MAGAZINE  BAG lol.  So after pondering about that in bed for a bit, I did my morning routine and then headed out for church. No lift for Jason today......since he's in Toronto. What a smurf. Same for Mike and Dan=P. Jokes all jokes dudes. So today I got to church relatively in a more relaxed way, since I didn't have to worry about taking anyone to church with me. Got there, chatted w/ the people for a bit, then me and Wendy did ushering for today.  Today....sermon theme was......ooooh boy I really have a crummy memory lol. But I do remember the memory verse was Hebrews 9:14, which reads:   "How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!"  Now if I remember correctly, one thing that the guest speaker Don Hill did talk about today was the power and superiority of God. That was the main title, but I don't remember the EXACT words. But basically the message today was how Christ, who came to the earth to die for us, did what 10,000 animal sacrifices could never do......and that is give us new life. So yeah I really did like today's sermon. Lol the speaker made fun of Chris a bit. Heh seems like everyone loves to make fun of the guy. Poor dude lol. But yeah speaker was pretty cool today. He had a comedic sense. Usually comedy/ real life experiences really get my attention in sermons. Oh yeah and on a side note, for me preparing a prayer during song of respone for offering didn't work lol. I choked more than I normally did. Ehehehehe gotta work on public speaking more even though I like it=P.  So yeah after that we had a Sunday school class with none other......than our HYPE counselor ALI! Today we learned about how basically the whole english term "two heads are better than one" saying works. I mean in the Bible even it talks about it. We studied Ecclesiastes chapter 4 today. It was speaking of a man who had no one to turn to, and how he was fairly depressed. Then it spoke of many analogies about how we should stick together to make life easier for one another. Also we spoke about how Christians are encouraged to marry other Christians, as people with more things in common probably get along better right =P. So the idea of people that have common likes/dislikes living together is like a team of oxen. If you have one big and one small oxen, life is a bit more difficult to plow the field (the plowed part being life's achievements). However if you have two even built oxen, the job is done faster, quicker, and the things you accomplish in life may look better (better quality plowed field). So yeah I really liked today's lesson also. A great day at church if you ask me hehe. Oh yeah Victor came back from the land Down Under again *AUSTRALIA for those shmucks out  there* and yeah chatted w/ him for a bit. Apparently he did break his arm in the accident but he looks healthy.  Then today was Communion, so we went upstairs. Well, me Ken Josh and Gavin stayed back to put out tables and chairs for the special lunch we have every Communion Sunday. Today was also the 2nd monthly HYPE exec meeting. The meeting went by fairly quickly, and I liked how the counselors really listened to me and Josh. It was pretty interesting meeting, and I felt we had accomplished lots of tasks to be completed in that meeting. I really am happy for the changes that have happened to my church. Our church's English/Youth ministry has never been better I think. Today's meeting also marks how close we are to summer holidays (for UWO students) and how some of them are leaving =(. But then again, this does happen, and we can only pray for the best for these people. *Sigh* but it seems so weird......in a matter of a year or two Josh Lo can be a counselor. So weird lol. But yeah we had a pretty good meeting, went over many issues/hopes for the future of HYPE. One main thing is getting our room painted. It's still sorta halfway done only lol. After this meeting *which was GOOD.....yes GOOD* it was time to go home.  Well.............first nap in car *ZZzzZZZzzZZzzzz* and then got home.  And to my surprise........DAVID'S HERE? Weird thought the kid wasn't comin but yeah came home and he was hoggin' my comp w/ Subspace. Wow...............weird lol. He seemed so bored too lol. But oh well yeah s'all good. So yeah he was playin comp, and I decided I'd nap. Yeah today and yesterday have compiled of nap, nap, and more nap. What a immense combo. MMADDDDD.   *WUMP* Nap time =).  And then after a shweet nap, went to Dave's grandma's house for dinner. REALLY boring. I was dying there. lucky I made a deal with parents to be back by 8 or they are paying me $$$ lol.  SO yeah now I'm at home bloggin', typical blog endin' for me. Yeah I can't believe it's only 10:30pm right now. Feels like it's friggin' 1am. I guess it's just because my day's passed by so quick, and I've done so much tonight already (blogged, slept, MSN, PS2, Dave's over and typing up Bio notes for Underhill for project). Anyways yeah I guess I'm goin on SC for a bit, then headin for the the hay and more Dreams. Hehe lates.

       3/13/04   First day of  FREEDOM !   Before I say anything else, I'm happy to see people blogging again! I mean during the school weeks, it was sometimes a bore at night....which is almost perfect  timing to be surfing blogs. Unfortuntely, may people dun have time to blog during school =(. I totally understand though, sometimes I just don't feel like  blogging, but then again............it is pretty fun too sometimes. Also it helps me w/ my memory *got the idea from Buttefly Effect I guess, but it works* and also my english writing skills have actually gone up. I've also come to like public speaking now through this. Sharing online isn't much different from sharing in front of people now is it=P? So yeah it's cool to be reading so many updated blogs today. Gavin and Jason.....BLOG!  And for the rest of bloggie for today.....  YES! Finally...........Day 1 of March Break. And a relaxing day 1 it was. Wow I haven't had a Saturday like this in ages. I mean........I completely forgot what it's like to nap for a whole afternoon. Also........I have got back into Badminton. I'm actually really excited about badminton season now. But yeah for a first day of a break week.......it was pretty enjoyable. It wasn't like AMAZINGLY HAVING A BLAST sorta day but REALLY relaxing, something I need after last week w/ all the tests n' stuff.  This morning I woke up EARLY. 7:45am on a Saturday? Yeah I know I'm crazy......but Badminton was that early @ UCC today. So had a quick breakfast, and then headed out the door for badminton. Both of us *me and Thompson* were late though, and didn't go in until 8:30.  Badminton was actually pretty fun today. Beat thompson 11-8=P. Then again I ain't goin for singles just because I hate doing all the work. I'm the lazy type, so someone else can hit the bird when I don't feel like it ^_^. So we played some singles, lazied around, and then some doubles games with some UWO students. Apparently some of them were surprised when John told them we were 15.  SO yeah basically did that from 8-11, and then came home.  Oh yeah I made a long distance call vai cell phone to Jason, who was in Toronto *whoops=P*  Now like I said......today's a lazy day, so I napped whenever I could. With that said, I slept from 12-12:20. Wow a 20 minute slumber....amazing. So after that grueling nap I headed to my last piano lesson before the holidays came by. WHoo.   So now I"m playing piano.....pretend you hear my exquisite, superior piano playing skills. Just picture Beethoven......but Chinese=P. Oh yeah and of course I'm better......*I wish, to both of those claims.*  So yeah after piano.......TIME TO DEPOSIT MY LONG EARNED MONEY FROM STARVING @ LUNCH FOR 3 MONTHS PLUS VARIOUS OTHER OCCASIONS! Wow.......I never knew Isaved up almost 400 bucks over last 3-4 months. My wallet couldn't close. Yes....this was about the first time *wait maybe 2nd, the time I refunded PS2 I had LOTS of 20's* my wallet couldn't close properly. Wow......Now I know how rich people feel....only their wallets probably can't close at all. So I went to deposit my money.....and I saw my account jump from 281.99 to 651.99. Wow......all that money.....all stored electronically in some database on a comp. I feel really safe w/ my money. I mean having an inatimate object keep track of it......yeah isn't it trustworthy=P. So basically all those days of starving @ lunch have paid off. Actually it was starving every once in a while.....I actually spent a lot at lunch these few months, going to Jasper's n' stuff. But yeah......and then after that went home.  Now........this is the time where I sleep from 2pm-5pm. *zZZZzzZZzzZzzZZzz*  Now I wake up......headache,and sorta confused at what time it was. Apparently Dad left for the church for the event tonight, and mom's not going. Least I have a dinner ^_^. So I woke up, ate, and then headed to the comp to see who's on MSN. Not really many people, so I went on SC.  SC....played diplomacy mostly tonight. Got bored, then went on MSN.  Yeah and now I'm on MSN, blogging, Kazaa (d/ling some new songs) and probably gonna sleep soon. Yeah I know today......isn't very exciting. But in 3 days........there's gonna be three really exciting blogs......they'll be JUST AS competitive as the Huntsville one. I'll probably add it to the looking back blog also. And I'll be blogging of course on my regular one here=P. Well I'm out for the night. Wow TC is inching closer and closer. In fact with Jason, Mike and some other people already out in Toronto, it really makes TC seem closer than it is. So......yeah I'm REALLY excited right now. I can't believe that it's already Saturday, the Saturday that marks 4 more days until TC 2004 for Seniors. SO EXCITED! Well yeah anyways I'm out.....so I'll see TCers on the 17th, and lates to all.

       3/12/04   And it's over.....SCHOOL'S THAT IS   WHOO HOO! GOOD BYE SCHOOL (for a week) AND HELLO MARCH BREAK! Wow Finally the long waited week of rest has come! Wow.......to think that only a month and a half ago I was complaining about exams. Well yeah with another bit of school done, the students and teachers finally get to enjoy a nice relaxing week of doing nothing. I especially am excited, as today marks the fact that there's only (yes count them) 5 more days until Senior TC 2004. The twins, Carmen, Rebecca and Calvin are headed for the Junior one on Monday and Tuesday. Wonder how they'll take this whole thing. Last year was friggin' AMAZING. I just hope it has the same effect on them as it did on the people that went last year. So yeah, but for the first three days of March Break, I'll still be in London. So yeah I'll have some time to kill in this old hick town. Wonder what I'll do. *Shrug* figure that out later....but yeah here was the outline basically of how my last day of school went....well the day before March Break.  Ooook......well woke up at around 7:20, and left by 7:40. And to think I had time to gel my hair, pack my bags, AND eat french toast? Wow I'm amazing =P. So yeah, left for Pat's house for a ride to school @ 7:40. Wow.....he's right at my doorstep waiting. Even better I don't have to walk down 3 houses lol.  Today, since it's snowing (what is wrong with Canadian weather, it was 17 degrees celsius last week) it took us nearly 25 minutes to get to school. Stupid snow......it was gone for a week and now it's back. I mean I normally like snow, but just when I started getting used to spring....SHOAM! More snow. BAH! So yeah today we had a pretty long car ride to school, but we were still on time. Ran to locker, put away stuff, and.....yeah then I headed off to....MUSIC!  Today was the final day for Mr. McCumber. I mean though he was a good music teacher, I never really liked him. He had spasms all the time and "volcanic eruptions of anger" as he describes it. So basically today we merged classes, and just had some fun w/ music before March Break. Really didn't accomplish much work.  Science class.......did some lab w/ making stuff fall. Physics is pretty boring like usual.  Lunch.....well today since it was last day I decided I'd treat myself *wow I'm very generous to myself no =P* to a nice luxurious lunch @ Jasper's. Instead of grabbing usual coffee and bagel.....I decided to go Ritzy style. Fried rice.......AND CHICKEN CAESAR WRAP?! PLUS A COFFEE ALL FOR JUST $6.38! Mmmmmm......food. Thompson got usual breakfast, Mike got burger and Nate a bagel. Hermann then came with Monica and Co. So yeah we chatted for a while, 'bout random stuff, then headed back to school....where Bio class awaits.  YAY ALMOST NO WORK TODAY! Just a quick sheet about nutrition facts, and then watched some lame 1980's National Geographic Video. Whoo.....no work......too bad my group presents first day back =\.  English.....finished Romeo and Juliet. Yeah the movie's just as twisted as the book....VERY. And that basically describes it.  Bused home, chatted w/ Dominik and Ryan.  And then home. SC, piano practice, etc etc. Usual stuff.....and then UCC (typical Friday).  Yeah today @ UCC originally me, Calvin and Sergei were only people there, but more people came in the end. B-droids was only open to people 19+ so we still had a small session. Steve, Igor and Lance came too, and some other people as well. Today....well I didn't really accomplish much. I can now very poor form link two mills. I'm SLOWLY getting the concept. Well I'll work on it over March Break I guess. But yeah got that sorta done and over with, and got burned in a battle. Me and Calvin vs. Steve and Sergei.....yeah just a bit stacked. Pulled off ugly millz=P. But I had to leave early so @ 9......I was back home.  Played piano, chatted, and now blogging. Gotta sleep early tonight since tomorrow I'm playing Badminton w/ Mophead and Hermann maybe. So Later.

       3/11/04   And after almost two and a half months blogging...   Yeah, I've come to see blogging really does make time seem to pass by so quick. I mean just to think I'm already on entry #72 or sometin like that already. And also......after two and a half months, watching more blogs pop up, and etc., I seem to be the lone survivor of blogging. I mean this as in I seem to be the only one still blogging daily. Jason kept the fight up until about ate February, while Gavin could keep up for 5 days lol. Lindsay kinda keeps hers up and running, and Kurtis does his weekly. Jenn also stopped, Josh kinda goes on and off......so yeah........I'm the lone blogger it seems now lol. Surprisingly, doing all this blogging has made me come to like public speaking now also. But it's also kinda  cool to see so many people have visited my site over the last few months. Ever since January......I've had about 1700 visitors. Well almost....I'm at 1640 almost right now. But that's already almost catching up to MANY Asian Avenue people. Not bad considerin some of em have had their site up for over two YEARS. Mine's just a little over a month ^_^. But yeah......blogging has basically become part of my life now......I find it amusing, and just sometimes when I'm bored I do sometimes read back on what I did say on......February 19th *Huntsville* or January 1st *New Years.* Well here's yet again another blog........ENTRY #72......  My day started off typical. Woke up, got ready, and headed to Pat's house for a ride to school. Got there, did this, walked there, threw stuff into locker, and then headed up to history class. I'm starting to think school's getting REALLY repetitive lately. Nothing exciting.......well until after history class.  History class we watched this video called "The Wave." Basically the video was showing how easy people conform to authority. The teacher *in the video* was teaching about Nazi Germany, and was talking about how Hitler murdered 10,000,000 people basically right under the German People's noses. Then the students asked how blind could the  German people really be, and that was when the plot of the story unravels. Basically the teacher then makes everyone think they are a cult called "The Wave" and has a whole system of society. The teacher then shows them how easily they were conformed at a rally, and the students then realized how easy it was to fall into a political trap. That was history class for you.  Announcements today: BADMINTON SEASON HAS SORTA OFFICIALLY BEGUN! Well signup started in rm. 314.....which I would head to at lunch to sign up. Hmm....I'll probably end up playing mixed doubles again. But before talking about that......Civics class.  Kinda interesting how mood swings happen......Ms. Manson was pretty nice in history, but right when civics kicked in.....she turned pretty bitter. Apparently our class "pathetically" failed the first civics test, even though most of us had decent marks. We started leadership unit today. We got into groups and had to solve this "mystery" of who blew up a bank and stole one million dollars. The suspects: A janitor, teller, president of the bank and.......a hippie. Right at the beginning we ruled out the hippie since well......HE'S A HIPPIE! So we then solved it since only the teller had access to dynamite and the keys to the bank. ANYWAYS yeah it was pretty lame. Our group concluded that in leadership......I seem to like to take control. Whoo! Point for me ^_^. So off to lunch.  Right after lunch.....SCRAMBLED to find room 314.........and I found it. It's a bloody hallway. WTF? Yeah I figured something was wrong, so then me, Thompson and Hermann went downstairs to the office to ask where the badminton meeting is. That's when I caught a piece of paper saying 314: Mr. Endo. I figured from there *don't ask how* that it was the physics room.....so I ran up there and I was right. Problem is: it's room 314 too. Wow......our school REALLY needs to learn how to number rooms. When you have two room 314's it's pretty difficult to set up meetings. Hmm turns out LOTS of people are going for JR. and SR. badminton. For Juniors I saw Thompson, Hermann, Meaghan Tanner, and Thompson's partner from last year Jen. Apparently lots of regulars *Jacob and Brandon* didn't know about the meeting lol and didn't sign up yet. Well so yeah did that.....and then studied for math test. Lots of people needed help lol. Maybe 3/4 of our class showed up. But lots of people did. I left about 3/4 of the way through since I learned everything I thought I hd to learn.....er review. SO quickly bought a lunch *well actually Thompson bought it* and then went to math.  Test actually wasn't HORRIBLE. Some stuff I didn't get at all though......but yeah I think it's a good thing I prayed. Really felt I had guidance from God. Unfortunately there was one question I never studied....the stupid rectangle. *Shrug* I just put down random formulas for that.  Programming.......boring. MOre turing, More crap.  Then bus ride home. Took  Cherryhill today w/ Dan and Elaina.  And Now I'm home. Typing, SC.....and now haircut ^_^. So people for now I'm out. Later =P.

       3/10/04   Moment In Joe's Life: His debut.....into Senior Band 2003-2004   Yes.......read it and umm......suffer! MUhahahahahahaha! I'm now officially the Bass Trombonist for ONE SONG in Senior Band. Well now two since the other dude gave me another song. But yeah you heard me. I'm in SENIOR BAND! WHOO HOO! Yeah senior band isn't much different from regular band. Actually I find it really amusing.....that's why I'm looking forward to senior music next year.  My day started off like usual Wednesday morning.....except this week instead of gr. 10 band I'm headed for senior. So I woke up at gruelinf 6am as usual *Yeah Jenn (Wong) 6am is brutal, just think I'm gonna be doin' this 3 times a week compared to your 5=P* and got ready for school n' stuff. Headed to senior band......and yeah like I said not much difference. First impression for me: I hit someone's music off a stand....and senior band folders are IMMENSE. So yeah not that great first impression=P. Better make it up somehow. For my first appearance though......I think I did....well decent. Hopefully. Only difference I really noticed between Senior band and intermediate  band: Senior band moves faster, but looks at stuff MUCH more detailed. From a wee little crescendo to a note tapering, Mrs. Wharton could point out every mistake you could think of. Then she totally burns the trombone section (not including me cuz I don't play the song she was making fun of =P). Says to them the 4 of them are pretty pathetic as Dave Rutt (Stage Band X conductor/senior trombonist) could produce more sound than them alone. Ow. Lucky I wasn't included, or else it would be 5 =P. For Godzilla, I actually have a REALLY easy part. Since I'm a bass line, I  basically follow Tuba, or in other words Christian *music genius* and Sam Zhang *Asian Retard.* Only hard part about my part is I have to play REALLY low notes. I'll learn in time though. I just need a bit of practice and I'll be up and running. This morning I just sight-read everything.  Music class....bit different today. Mr. McCumber played sorta a "farewell" thing. He's actually pretty good w/ the clarinet. After that business as usual. I'm happy Mrs. Wharton's coming back after March Break........I mean though Mr. McCumber did calm down these last two weeks compared to before but I just don't like him. He's a REALLY weird teacher at times. Today we learned that the song "Son of a Gambolier" is actually the Georgia Tech theme song or something like that. Cool, we're playing something somewhat famous. Hmm....nothing really amusing happened in class. Pretty quiet class today actually.  After music headed up to science class. We didn't really do much today, had a cheesy quiz *which I didn't do too well on* and then after that talked about a lab we are doing next day, which I have to print off. Not a very exciting class.  Lunch......I spent my time doing programming project. Hermann went also, and Robert and some other people I saw in there too. Hmm........so far this week's gone really well actually. I've saved 15 bucks already just from starving. I can see why playing basketball in the gym can be popular now. At this rate if i save 15 bucks a week, I make 60 bucks a month (if I save 15 bucks a week, if I save 25 then 80 bucks a week). Holy crap to think I can afford a PS2 game each month if I did that. So yeah worked on that...and Jason came in for a bit too.  Afterwards headed to bio. For the whole class today basically did some random work since Ms. Wiener didn't show up as her grandfather recently passed away. Me, Okanski, Underhill and Robert planned out what's happening w/ project. It's  been agreed we meet Friday FOR SURE, then Monday if needed. Wow one day to do a 75 min project.......just amazing lol. I'm confident we'll get a good mark though.....I've started to like public speaking ^_^. Not much else really happened, since a lot of people in that class was on vacation. Oh yeah and then me and Okanski started making the faucet noise thing *the one where u hit ur cheek and make that water dropping noise* and pissed off the teacher. Then Okanski started randomly calling Drew, pissing him off lol.  English class we started watching Romeo and Juliet. BOOOOOOORING............VERY BOOOOOOOORING.  Then after that time for home! Bused home w/ Dominik, Ryan and Underhill.  Then got home. Nothing very exciting at home today. I ate, played SC, then napped. And then Theory class.  By now in theory we don't really learn anything. Basically we go there and do our theory papers since we know the basics to everything now. As usual I'm VERY behind, but most of my answers are right at least. We finally got our score sheet. Lauren got bored and started drawing a group picture of us on the scoresheet *we have open space since we have only 4 people in the class now,* which really shows how bored we can get. Also Melody went sorta insane, and Me and Thomas were on a hot streak w/ guessing words today. Whoo. Yeah I know you don't have to tell me never make another entry about  theory class. It's a waste of space I just noticed also but I'm not about to backspace my efforts.  Then came hom around 9pm, and started studying for math. I have a REALLY big test tomorrow and so yeah two hours of solid studying *plus msn, winamp, and other crap* but SOLID studying. Anyways I'm out for the night now, so watch out for my next entry coming THURSDAY MARCH 11th. No way! Yes you better believe it another one tomorrow. Later.

       3/9/04   Blog w/ Big Title=*shudder*   Yes......this WAS my first blog with the new TITLE FORMAT! But it looked like absolute crap so no big titles. But yeah sorry people. Today I gotta have a cheesy summary style blog. But it was a late start day today which was cool ^_^. Slept in whoo! And here's the day:  -Woke up -Lift to school from Pat -History....learned about Battle of the Atlantic (my comp froze, destroying my note....crap school comps =@) -Civics........did stuff w/ politics. We were grouped into parties and then voted (NDP won somehow, I was Liberal and voted Liberal) -Lunch....worked on programming project -Math: Review for dreaded test on Thursday -Programming: We did more imaging crap w/ Turing. So lame. -Bused home -Ate food -SC -Ate Dinner -Homework -TV -More homework  And now.......SLEEP! So yeah I'll make a better entry tomorrow. Later =P.

       3/8/04   Most Barren Band Practice EVER...   I remember when Jason wrote the entry about his classes when we were away on Huntsville and how they were all barren. Well I think I got a taste of that this morning. This is why...  Well after waking up on a Monday morning @ 6:30 for band, I got ready fairly quickly and darted out the door. But when I got to band today. First I was kinda surprised to see the strings in our usual rehearsal room, but also when I actually stepped into the strings room for band rehearsal.....WOW it was barren. Instead of the usual 91 of us......there were 15. I was late too lol. Our rehearsal started off with NO clarinets until about 5 minutes in. There were only 3 flutes compared to the usual 40 billion, and 2 trumpets lol. Two clarinets, Thompson the lone percussionist.....and oh yeah one horrid sounding oboe *they sound worse than clarinets ugh.* There were also the assortment of other people and stuff, like the usual militia of Saxophones (Maggie, Lindsay, Caitlin and Rebecca) and me, Pourier and Shaun covered the trombone parts pretty well.....but mostly today was pretty big waste of time in band. He might as well have just let us go and roam the school for one hour. But no we still rehearsed. and after that really boring rehearsal.....came first period which was.....MUSIC *shudder.*  Music today we crammed together the two classes and rehearsed. We don't sound half bad. I don't have much to say for that time because I was half asleep.  Same for science. All I remember is some lab testing acceleration.....and then spent 40 minutes chatting about random stuff. Oh yeah Rhoden sang the element song since Mr. Curphey got pissed off at him.  Lunch today I went to get a book for english class. I'm gonna try starving this whole week, since I'm trying to save up as much $$$ as possible for TC. My aim of 600 bucks came about 50 bucks short =(. Oh well least I still have $$$ to spend =P. Afterwards met up with Thompson and them and we went to Athlete's World for a bit before heading back to school. Nothing really too great....downtown Athlete's World isn't even that much better than Masonville's. So yeah what a good waste of 10 mins=P.  Well when I got back to school......it was now bio class. We had a sub though today since Ms. Wiener's grandfather just passed away today. So she was out and we had a sub teacher and we watched some video and then chatted. Now originally me Underhill and Robert would agree to go to the library after school, but I had Stage Band X and would meet up with them later.  English class we finished Romeo and Juliet. For the next two days we would watch the movie. She assured us it ain't gonna be that crappy modern one w/ Leonardo The Craprio or however the hell you spell his name.   Stage Band X.....I am now officially a Bass Trombonist =P. Wow our school actually has friggin nice instruments. The bass trombone I had was basically brand new. So yeah I'm now gonna remember Trombone # 3366 for next year. I hope it was that number at least lol. But yeah rehearsal actually went REALLY well today. I was surprised how well it went. Other  than some talking, we actually ran through the music really smooth.  Now then I get to the library......and they weren't there. Well.........looked around for about 15 minutes and after figuring that they had everything done already *I don't know what really had to be done* so I left for my bus stop.  Now I'm home.........blogging, chatting, the usual. Probably gonna nap for a bit now. Anyways yeah I'm out both ways so later.

       3/7/04   Just another average Sunday   Today didn't have too many highlights. I don't know why, but on Sundays I seem to like to relax more now than running around town. Saturdays though I can never tolerate staying cooped in the house all day. That's one reason why I like HYPE, it gets me out of the house for sure each Saturday lol, and also I'm happy I live by Masonville and UWO. So yeah my weekends are normally spent outside my house anyways. Today though marks the beginning of the last week of dictorial school before the Break. I can't wait...March Break sometimes to me seems more exciting than summer I don't know why. Maybe it's just the "let's see how much funm I can shove into one week!" or just the fact you can snowboard AND play basketball even sometimes at the same time of season. But also of course........TC is around this time....and that is always one heck of a fun time for both my Spiritual growth and meeting new people. But that'll be in one week's time. So for now....onto talking about my Sunday.  My day kicked off around 8:30, waking up and getting ready for church. Slow moving morning I found. Took me bout 10 minutes to get ready and then off to pick up Jason. Listened to a gospel on 105.9FM and then when we got to Jason's house....well he was still sleeping. But thankfully the doorbell woke him up so off to church we went. Whee we were early again! It was cool to see all the UWO students back again. Also Kendrick bought Daniel a Bible, which was pretty cool. I sometimes think now that the dream I had a while back about our English congregation growing quickly, may be true. Just seeing such generosity within our congregation really brings up my dream as a possibility. Worship today consisted of a Drunms & Piano combo which was somewhat new, and......JESSE WONG CAME BACK FOR A DAY! Our old HYPE counsellor, he was pretty much the dude who formed the fellowship. So yeah this dude does have his place in LCAC. He did so much for us, starting the fellowship, and just giving us the chance to really grasp what a fellowship is like.....awesome. So yeah today was kinda cool at church. Oh yeah....and though Carmen and Gavin WERE supposed to usher....in the end Jason had to take Carmen's spot since well she kinda....didn't make it lol. So Jason took her spot for today...*shut down...sorta=P.* The message today: modeling the Christian Life." Now unfortunately after Kendrick sorta gave me a Bible to read since he thought I forgot mine *really it's because I pay attention better without ANY distractions* so I started flipping through the Bible that was-to-be Dan's. So I kinda didn't grasp the message today =S. Zoned out reading Revelation. Read Revelation 8:8-9 which reads:   8"The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a  huge mountain , all ablaze, was  thrown into the sea.  A third of the sea turned into blood,  9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed."  So yeah after reading that....I started wondering if that has happened yet. At first I thought of Atlantis....and if it was referring to that. But then I thought about Global Warming....and how it is said that a third of the world's land mass would be lost once the poles melt. Well if they do. So I started thinking about that during sermon for about 30 minutes. I still haven't come to a conclusion obviously....but it was a thought to throw out I guess. Then during tithes & offering, I had a quick prayer about my dream. I don't know why but it seems that this dream REALLY does mean something. I don't know if it's just me, or this is as meaningful to me as the entry in Josh Lo's blog about the glimpse of Angels during service one day. Well after service, talked with the HYPE counsellors about when our meeting would be...it is now officially set for next week. And for the whole morning Kendrick was looking for someone with nice writing to write sorta like a "To: Dan From: Hype Counselors" sorta thing. I dunno who he found in the end but he found someone lol. Then had the usual chatting time afterwards, and then class started with Pastor Mackness.  Today mainly we talked about the movie that we all just saw last night * The Passion of the Christ if you don't know what I mean.* Had a big discussion on it, what surprised us, what the movie meant, etc. Josh who couldn't make it, asked us what we got out of the movie. Personally though I never said it....I didn't actually get any like NEW things out of the film. It was more of a reminder to me of how much Christ suffered and how great of an example he has set for us. Afterwards we finished up our lesson on God's presence with different names for him throughout the Bible. Abba, Elohim, Jehovah, the list goes on and on. I think there were about 15 different names. Well actually a few of them start with Jehovah, but I counted those as individual names. After that, Jesse and Gavin had a "Jam sessioN" w/ guitars, and the rest of us just chatted. I locked together a few of our bags together *amusing no =P* and there were the daily poking wars between Rebecca and Jason lol. Chatted a lot, and then Badminton started w/ Calvin and Gavin. Originally Jason was gonna come over and we were gonna play that new 007 game for PS2 "Everything for Nothing" or sometin like that, but since dad had to fix some speaker at church we kinda got delayed to 3 lol. So I sat there, taught myself 3 new guitar chords *NO WAY!* and now my guitar chord span is up to 6! C,G,D,E,A,Em! THAT'S A +6 IMPROVEMENT lol. Originally I vaguely knew G or C lol. Well I kinda got the hang of C from practicing it for 3 months, but yeah now I can ALMOST play a whole song lol. All I need now......are those chords like "Asus" or the dreaded B, Bm's, Bsus or.....the infamous F#m. *Shudder.* Stupid bar chords....I can see why Gavin hated them lol. So I basically  taught myself *with some help from Gavin* on how to play the basic guitar chords, and some badminton. I REALLY suck now at Badminton lol. Lucky I'm basically the only veteran mixed doubles player lol so I can't get cut =P. So after waiting around until 3pm, with some badminton, and guitar playing, FINALLY we got home.  So me and Jason ate quickly, and the played some 007. AMAZING GAME. Co-Op is so much fun. I mite buy the game actually. REALLY fun. And it's in 3rd person thank goodness. I'm happy EA finally learned that 1st person shooters and PS2 just don't mix. 3rd Person shooters...I love em. This game I honestly I think is the best 007 yet since Goldeneye for N64. So after we did that for a bit, dad kicked us off TV, so we ate half a bag of tortilla chips and half a tub of sour cream, and then played some SC. Jason left around 6:30 or so.  Anyways.....yeah that basically summarizes my day. Now....what's comin up next? A really insane week @ school *Programming project, Bio project, first time tryin out senior band, and a math test* and for tonight.....dinner and some h/w. So until tomorrow's entry.....  Download some music you people. Later.

       3/6/04   "The Passion of the Christ..."one word to describe it. Wow.   When I say wow to the movie, I don't just mean as in it was a very moving film. I mean it as in just the detail, the images and the power that this movie really has. Maybe it's just because I'm a Christian, or maybe it's the same reaction for Christians and Non-Christians.. But when I saw this movie today at 6:30 with HYPE, I was never really anticipating that much detail and awe that this movie really has. No I didn't cry, or feel very different like "oooh I'm gonna re-commit my life now," but it was very interesting to see what another fellow Christian brother pictured in his mind when he read about the last 12 hours of Christ's life. And the discussion afterwards at McDonalds *very appropriate place to discuss huh=P* was very interesting too. But like usual I gotta cover my day before I reach the climax. So here it goes....my day that led to the seeing of one of the finest films I've seen so far in 2004.  It all began today with waking up from an 11 hour slumber. I haven't slept this much in ages. I had some very strange dreams last night. Originally I did remember them earlier....but yeah they are somewhat faint now. Some of the dreams I remember though really boggled my mind when I woke up. Others kinda made me think what my mind has going through it at 3am. Nothing really that stays in my head for 8 hours. I mean there are some dreams that stay in my head for ages. Like I still remember the one back when I was 8 that scared the hell out of me when I saw pupiless-eyed pale people stepping out of my TV. Or the time when I saw my English Congregation at Church spreading to many people in the community. But yeah the dreams I had last night stayed in my head for only about two hours lol.  Well after waking up, I went to practice my piano for about.....yeah a good one hour. Ate lunch, then quickly threw in an extra 15 minutes. Oh yeah and I did something really stupid: I cut up some photocopied music by accident =P. And then off to piano lesson.  Today....mainly getting prepared for Kiwanis coming up in a month or so. Nothing really big happening.  After that yeah I spent most of my afternoon working on a resume, chatting to people on MSN, and lunch. Nothing very appealing today in the afternoon. So yeah to get out of the house ASAP called Jason and we went to Masonville a bit early before the movie and pre-ordered SC Ghost. Saw Nick Saika too. Talked for a bit, then went off to some other stores. Champs and Foot Locker mainly. No place sells Adidas Superstars as much anymore. Bummer. Well if I find a pair in Toronto MAYBE I'll get one. Then walked around a bit more, grabbed sometin to eat before the movie. And then met up with the rest of HYPE for the movie. Went in, bought some stuff, and then.......the anticipated part of my day/blog....the movie.  I was surprised that there were almost NO commercials in this film. Only previews for ONE movie instead of the usual 7. The movie though started off almost right from Jesus' arrest. By the way I basically can't ruin this movie for you. I mean it's been written in over 20,000,000 books in this world, and translated into more than 200 languages.....so it's pretty hard for me to ruin the film. If you haven't read the black n' white version of it, go to BibleGateway.com and under passage search Luke 22:39-23:49. That'll be basically the whole movie in its original form. I really like how they portrayed Satan in the movie. Instead of the stereotypical voice in the air, they used an actress *Rosalina something forgot her last name* and poised her as a bald, eyebrowless Satan. Really added an affect to the movie I think. Creativity points right there. And from the beginning, on, it basically showed what Jesus' went through *A lot of pain and suffering* for the people that rebuked him, but He still loved. Another part of the film that I found really well made was  the emphasis on how Pilate *the judge that condemned him* didn't want to at all, and tried all he did to save Jesus' life. In the end though he did it only at the Jews' cries and edge to start a riot, and he even said basically that the Jews were responsible for his death, and the Jews AGREED.  Just to say now also, I REALLY disagree on how so many people say this movie's Anti-Semetic. I mean it's recorded they did it......and they did say it. It's not like every Christian's now going to hate them because of it. It was said many years before this would happen. And it's been like this for 2000 years and it hasn't changed so I don't think from one film everyone's going to hate them now. But back to the main point of my blog....the flim.  The torture was the part where I really was surprised of how much they pictured Jesus going through. Whipping with sticks, and then the flog. Wow the flogging.....really disturbed me in a way. I mean it wasn't that bad at first, but when one lash actually was latched in his skin and the Roman just rips it out...*shudder.* That really turned my stomach a little bit. Then the crucifying. It all seemed like the usual picturing....with the nailing to the cross and of course the pain that goes along with it. I mean I've pictured it....and seen it in the old films that talk about Jesus. But one part that REALLY caught me off guard and actually made me just tense up.....when they turned the cross about face. I mean LANDING on your knees WHILE nailed to the cross.....yeah that really shot in my mind "Joe, Jesus did a lot for you...A LOT." The suffering, and the pain that he had to go through for us to receive salvation....yeah it's a lot to intake. "A good shepherd dies for his sheep," that statement means a lot more to me now than before probably. I mean....I know he did go through a lot for us to receive salvation, but I guess just because of human nature...visually SEEING it.....yeah it made me think. But I would recommend everybody, Christian or Non-Christian to go see this production, and I hope that both ways it will make you think twice about what Jesus has done for us.  After the movie we headed to McD's for a little discussion before heading home. We got split into groups, with JT and Kendrick taking me, Calvin, Mike and Dan. We started off with a word of prayer. It was actually really good to see Mike taking the courage to pray in a public area like McD's. Him being such a young Christian and already doing so much....wow. I don't know if it was because of the movie, or because he's really moving on his Christian life....but it's REALLY cool to see Dan, Mike and Jason already grow so much in Christ. Personally if I were in his stage of a Christian I wouldn't even have the courage to pray in public. So if you're reading this Mike Props Dude....many Props. We then talked about the film...many responses were the movie was powerful, and it really showed how much Jesus suffered for us just for us to have eternal Salvation. The whole thing about the movie being touching to the stage of making you cry, personally I didn't think so. I mainly didn't really feel that because of this reason:  Pretend I did cry and feel so moved and stuff....it would've made me feel guilty that it takes a human to show me how much Jesus suffered....when it's been in a book that's been sitting in my room for over 10 years....loud and clear....straight from God. Says so in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John about how much he suffered. And if four prophets couldn't get it through my head and all of a sudden a Hollywood can...that just shows how much Media affects us and how lazy I am not to have read my Bible. This story's not new...it's been around for over 2000 years, translated into over 200 languages, and been in mass production since the Printing Press was invented. So the only time I should have been moved by this story....was when I first read it. Though I didn't...but I still do know how much he suffered, and paid for our sins in the form of the worst torture known probably to man. But I don't expect every person that watches the movie to ball their eyes out afterwards. I mean I know some people will, but I didn't for my own reasons, and I do think it's perfectly fine if you do and no you won't die if you did. It's just in my opinion why I didn't, and I don't expect it to even be applied to anyone. But anyways yeah that was MY opinion and back to the discussion @ McD's...  We discussed a lot about the accuracy of the film also. It was official.....lots of us were freaked by the demon lurking in the forest that just popped out at Judas. Also the demonic figures chasing Judas after he turned in Jesus for the money, that was scary too. Overall yeah this film was VERY accurate...and probably went beyond. Going through Roman history to determine the name of the Pilate and his wife, the process of torture, and the process the Romans went through before the crucifixation, I really commend Mel Gibson and his production team in going through so much effort to make this movie accurate to history as much as it was to the Bible. And like I said before I really liked how they portrayed Pilate as an actual Judge and not a random condemner, I mean he did try to avoid letting Christ being crucified since even he found no fault in Christ, and also how they emphasized Christ still forgiving us even when the Romans tortured Him, and not cursing. Also Kendrick kinda said a few things he shouldn't have said lol. I won't mention one of them as it was a pretty embarassing counsellor moment but here's the one I will mention:  Ken: What'd you think of Steven carrying the cross with Christ? How are we sorta like in Steven's situation? JT and others: Isn't his name Simon? Ken: .....Whoops ehehehehehe=P.  Yeah that and also we kinda discussed about a few other things. Some funny moments at McD's. Then aftera word of closing prayer, and talkin to the others....I left for Paul n' Yu and got parents drove me home *they had dinner there.*  So yeah summarizing today: Woke up, piano, boring afternoon, and then movie. The movie though I really recommend. The Passion of the Christ...very moving. I recommend anyone to see it. Even though it wasn't exactly like the usual theatre thing *no DDR or anything afterwards* it was still an amazing time with HYPE. Anyways I'm out for the night......it's 12:25....lucky I had 11 hours of sleep yesterday. Hmm....not much else to say really. So....G'nite. I think I've covered everything I want to cover. Lates.

       3/5/04   No I didn't miss a day of blogging ehehehehe=P   Technically I'm blogging this actually at 1:12pm on Saturday....since I kinda...well.....fell asleep for 11 hours lol. Originally I had my whole night planned out: UCC, Piano practice, and then blog. Well that kinda got changed to UCC, Piano........WUMP! I sat in front of the 88 key wooden block for 15 minutes then decided to take a 30 minute nap, which got prolonged into a 11 hour slumber. SO yes see.....a very legitimate excuse for not blogging yesterday. At least I catch up fast....unlike some people who's name I will not mention. *Cough.....JA.....Cough.*......*Cough SON Cough.* So yeah here goes.......the recalling on what I can recall out of my non-recalling mind of yesterday.....er I mean "today." Whenever I say "today" in this blog it refers to the date posted on the blog date by the way. Hmm also kinda interesting how 30 people still visited my site without me updating.  I woke up like usual, fairly tired since the night before I was doing stupid but "productive" things like reading other blogs, surfing the net, and just letting TC memories whiz by my head while I was thinking about how much more exciting this year's TC will be since I'm DETERMINED to go to BOTH of the days. But anyways I got ready for school like usual, and then headed out the door for a expected average day 1.  Turns out it wasn't that average. Today was assembly day! WHOO! AVERAGE ASSEMBLY DAY 1! Actually it was a first. This is the first time in the whole year that I had an assembly on day 1. Reason why I remember is because it's the first time I got to sit in the balcony this year for an assembly. Normally we sit in the back, struggling to see what the hecks going on with the heads of gr. 11's and 12's blocking our Gr. 10 miniscule field of vision. But yeah before that we were in History......whoo hoo. BOOOOORING. I dunno why.......but I really find this history unit boring. So far at least. I mean, I love learning about World War II, since I used to be sorta a 20th century war nut......but I guess just the pace of the class has kinda made it seem boring. I liked the  class before more when we watched the video on the Battle of Britain. Today we just learned about basically the Canadian and American convoys going to Britain lost LOTS of boats. U-Boats would whoop Merchant Ship ass out in the Atlantic. Hmm that's basically all we did.....History class is norally this amusing. I guess one reason is cuz Ms. Manson....can't come up with a SINGLE joke in class. I mean she could at least TRY, and have us laugh at her lame attempt, like Mr. Estabrooks last year, or Mr. Douglas. So after 60 minutes of that boredom.....it was time for Civics.  Bah. We were in assembly #2. Rats. That meant I had to suffer the boredom of Ms. Manson's civics class BEFORE the assembly. So yeah today we went to the computer lab and further did more on that assignment about the Canadian government. It's pretty lame actually.......we have to compare the provincial and federal parties and see the differences. It's basically the same.....only Federal do less actually. They don't have to worry about education funds, or the money put into health care. So yeah we learned about that, and then went to the assembly...  The assembly today was on multiculturalism. I don't mean to sound mean.....but the assembly really did blow. With all the technical difficulties, and seem-to-be poor preperation, just the environment wasn't too appealing. Last year's I actually enjoyed watching, the people on stage seemed to have a passion for what they were doing. This year's was just so slow moving and crappy I fell asleep for most of it. There wasn't really any highlight......some people afterwards told me that the first assembly was better,and ours was cut short. Both ways I really didn't like it.  For lunch...went to Galleria. Had some wedges and coffee. Weird combo I know but it works. Then back to school.  Math class once again Mr. Gilbert had to tolerate w/ our loudness and annoyance lol. We basically reviewed for the math test on Thursday. Not much excitement there. Hmm.....well like usual Mike was a jackass, John was being bitched at, Courtney still needs PMS pills, Nick was also a shmuck for a bit. My Coffee didn't affect me that bad.......I wasn't AS hyper as usual.  Programming...not very amusing. We learned Turing imaging more. It's terrible. Today's class sucked....no funny things happening...no Icy mauling Pokan...no nothing. Just pure silence and the sound of typing.  Then after school met up with Dan for UCC. well First house than UCC. So at home we just ate....lots. We bought some stuff at Angelos to eat then went home. First we ate this cake stuff called "Tiramisu..." SOOOOOO GOOD. It's like a Cappuchino cake almost and I'm hooked on em now. Then after that went on MSN for a bit....and I went upstairs to grab a bite of Lemon Meringue Pie. Dan came up too for some....but when he sat down....CRACK. Congrats he just sat on the lid for the pie. So we ate about half of that and we were still hungry. And that's when we came up with the most ultimate food at  the time. Cheese+Tortilla Chips+McDonald's Salsa=SOMEWHAT BELOW AVERAGE NACHOS! WHAT AN IDEA! So we quickly grated some cheese, put them in the oven.......and 10 minutes later POOF! NACHOS! Mmmm.......soooo good. Then after that we decided to make more.......and we did. More food.......mmm....more fat and carbohydrates and minimum proteins. So after that......we decided to go to UCC and work out for a bit before sessioning. Well a session that we'd eventually not do because we were WAAAY to tired after the workout we had.  Yeah so we did weights, cardio, the works. LOTS of it. from 5-7 pure working out. I think I went through 3 bottles of water through that workout. My bench has gone down from 125-110 unfortunately, but I can still do as many sit-ups as I could do in the summer, maybe a bit less. I did 60 today (not full effort but meh), but over the summer I did over 60 with a 25 pound weight. So yeah maybe it has gone down a bit. But I really need to start working out more, my muscles are DYING slowly. Dan is a friggin tank. He can already do 120 in Gr. 9. Not bad with the fact he's 5'2 lol. Then we ran about 30 Mins of Cardio, and then more weights. 15 mins of Cardio, then went upstairs to see how the session was going.  The session had a hefty bit of people show up. I just watched basically since my muscles were kinda tired out from weights. But yeah it looked like a pretty good session. Then me and Dan went back downstairs for a bit more Cardio, then I had to go. Friggin Cell phone didn't work *damn Fido......DAMN YOU!* and then ended up buying a 20 dollar phone card lol. Stupid Bell machine not providing change. I HATE YOU TOO! And then went home.  And this is where my day ends. Watched some Family Guy, Piano for 15 minutes then.....WUMP.  And that's the end. For now.....I'll blog more tomorrow. Later.

       3/4/04   Today marks 12 more days till TC   Hmm.....if I could get one of those timers......I would make one counting down to TC. So excited....there's still 12 days and I all the memories from 2k3 are already coming back into my mind. The flag carrying, yelling, running around the church like my usual self at school.....except more cuz after day 1 my voice was dying already lol. And then the food.....and me and Gavin's shallowness.....yeah immature 9ers....so typical lol. LEING LUI OVER THERE AH! Yeah we had some of those laughs too in TC....of course though we did grow spiritually also. But enough said about that for now....each day until TC I'll slowly talk about that. But for now.....yeah you guessed it......it's time to talk about my day =P.  Today was............Thursday that's right so no band lol. Almost forgot there. OH YEAH I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED NOW! I woke up......and then Patrick called and said he's not going to school today. Well since I didn't have to worry about giving him a lift to school......I was kinda tired too....soo........Hmm I was tempted to stay at home today. But then again I needed to see guidance today *which I did in a 50 minute interview* so yeah with my willpower I finally got up, got dressed n' stuff (morning routine) and headed out the door.....for another day of high school.  Well......first class up......music. Boy only 3 more classes w/ Mr. McCumber and then Mrs. Wharton comes back. Thank goodness. I'm sick and tired of this dude's moodswings. One day he'll be all happy and next day......PMS TO THE MAX! So yeah I'm happy I only have to tolerate this for three more classes. Well today music class sorta started with a jumpstart when Mitch fell off his chair and made the xylophone thing fall too lol. He kinda fell into it and CRRRRAAAAAAAASH! Mr. McCumber wasn't too pleased, the rest of the class just laughed lol. So yeah like usual we played lots of pieces, and then today once again Mr. Clark merged his class with us. Nothing too exciting there.....I had to help Spencer w/ his trombone solo, and I was bored so I played some of the Sax part since Bradburn sits beside me. Yeah not very exciting except for the Mitchell falling off the chair. Meaghan's still has a broken wrist....and Lindsay and Katie were late. See not very exciting except for that one highlight. I'm still deciding whether I should play senior band for the next 3 months left in the year. It'd be training for next year at least.......but should I? So many descisions to make...and yes this is why I have to pray. I dunno who else but God could really help me at this time.  Science.......hmm not much today. Me and Korpela kinda had the weirdest idea *PATENT PENDING* that I won't say what it is or else well....you'll know our idea=P. And no it isn't squeeze bottle ketchup I realize that's been made. Or Peanut Butter Paintballs. We are still doing pyshics in class.....really boring. Hmm.....that was basically it....then lunch *DING DING*  Well today Jason came out for lunch with us....and we went to Galleria. Lots of talk about the big trade the Leafs and Rangers made. Brian Leetch w/ the Leafs........they actually have a chance at the cup now I think. And Sergei Gonchar with the Bruins.......two new stacked teams....COMPETITION. And of course the no name trade Edmonton made lol. I don't even care about them.  By the way I'm talking about the NHL if you still don't know what I'm talking about. So yeah today we went to Galleria to eat......and then headed back to school. Oh yeah Mike wasn't there today.....so the scapegoat of making fun of someone was........the one and only.......AMERICAN POSING.........JOHN THOMPSON! Yeah everyone made fun of him lol.  Bio Class.......BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG. Another presentation.......well actually this one was kinda amusing.....they were talking about narcotics lol. But even if I wanted to nap I wouldn't have been able to. Holy crap Adam Ozvald sniffles once every 5 seconds....for his presentation he'd sound like this:  "Nicotine *sniff* is a form of depre*sniff*ssant.*sniff*It acts as a *sniff* depressant as it *sniff* causes *sniff* you to not *sniff sniff* have as *sniff* great of *sniff* senses *sniff sniff sniff* as usual"....*SNORT*  So yeah even if I tried to sleep......I woulda been woken up by the constant sniffling. Half the class was kinda giggling 'bout it too. Robert was gonna suggest to tell him to blow his nose....but didn't as he thought it might "offend" Adam. But in a way I think he shoulda to put Adam out of the misery he didn't know about. Oh well.....it's over now anyways. I really need to start working on the project, which me and Robert did after school.  So now to English Class....normally. However I had a guidance appointment first...so first to that....  *Running to Guidance Office...Zing.*  And now I'm sitting in Ms. Fallon's guidance office. Yeah I really needed this guidance appointment. I kinda let everything compact itself in so I never really thought about guidance until now....where I would have a 50 minute appointment lol. So basically I'd talk about how instead of pure business.....I may drop Co-op now and take Chem and Bio. It's an idea....I guess. I mean....now I have three fields I could enter: Business, Law, and Sciences. Bah but I wanted something with psychology. It's actually becoming kinda interesting....the whole neurology thing/psychology thing.....pretty cool stuff. I guess office work is starting to look.....bland I guess. But it's cool too.....with the whole competition thing. Oh well I still have until late April to figure it out....so yeah...this is gonna be one huge prayer request...just for God to help me organize out my future for me....for those praying people out there. Yeah so that was basically the whole guidance appointment......50 minutes of talking aboutwhat I wanna do with my life. The bottom line: Keep my horizon broad.  And now that I'm done that...........back to English class. Listened to some book reports. Read Romeo and Juliet. *ZZZZzzzZzzZZZZzzZZzz.* We are up to the part where Friar Lawrence plans to fake Juliet's death. Boring. REALLY Boring. I hate this stupid 500 year old play....so useless.  So yeah had to suffer that for only about 20 minutes instead of the standard 70  becuz of guidance ^_^. And then me and Rob went to the library to start our bio project on malnutrition.  Not much to say.....we researched and took notes....not much else. No one's there on Thursdays for some reason.  Bused.....came home......hmm.......yeah after school life consisted of TV, SC, piano practice, and some homework.  Yeah your typical Joe Chan day....with guidance added and some funny parts to today's school day. And now.....yeah I think I'm gonna sleep early for once....or do some more piano practicing. Later.

       3/3/04   Tiring days make Joe.......well tired.   Bah another Wednesday. Wednesdays are probably the most hated days in my life. I mean just the fact it mocks you by saying you're only halfway through the week already peeves me off enough. Then again it's an indication its halfway through the week.....so only two more days before weekend lol. But also it's the fact that I have band *shudder* plus theory *double shudder.* Yeah that's why I hate Wednesdays. Average day lasts from 6am-11pm. VERY boring and tiring. But today actually wasn't horrifying....just tiring. I haven't got good sleep for the whole week, and today was no exception.  This morning I was debating about whether or not I should go to band. For some reason I decided reluctantly to go......and I did. We played actually very well this morning though. I was really surprised. And I was happy it was day 1...don't have to suffer in the same place for over two hours. Oh yeah....and up until now I don't know what the heck that green jersey I bought was of. It's just green......and it says #6 on the back. It's a nice shirt though, looked it up on foot locker. Apparently it's a Boston shooting shirt? Shooting=? Meh it's a nice shirt so I'm not complaining lol. Some people thought baseball, and others thought Rugby. I truly don't know lol. Footlocker.com says its a "Boston Shooting Jersey." Celtics? *shrug.* Who cares really it's a shirt lol. Anyways off to history...  We talked about Battle of Britain today. FINALLY a battle. The French lost so badly in the war that Ms. Manson didn't even bother talking about them really lol. Just talked about how they failed. We watched a video. History is biased.....since it was basically showing Britain's glory. Though it's true Britain whooped Germany's ass. If Hitler never PMSed though and started bombing London instead of the defenses though on Britain.....I think he could have won. But since he PMSed, and attacked London, his landing never came. He did the same with Russia. Some people say Hitler attacked Russia because he lost in a game of poker to Stalin. Yeah history zoomed by sorta.....slowly. I can see why now though Britain lived....with Hitler making a stupid descision like that. Oh well off to civics.  Learned about gov't more......blah blah. Boring. Went on computers to do some research on our government. Whoo.  Lunch....well I'm cutting funding this week and next week.....hoping to save at least 200 for Toronto and TC. I'm at 190.......so yeah I'm cutting back on food lol.  So I had fries and coffee.....what a weird combo it is. Thompson had shitty pancakes from International Soups today, and Nate and Mike had BK and Subway. Mike left early for some reason, but after he left me Thompson and Nate started talking about starting a playoff pool for NHL. And then we left for school.  Math class........it was usual. Mike was being a Jackass, everyone was a jackass to Thompson *lol* and Mike said to Courtney that she needs PMS pills. Yeah our math class is getting more and more hostile each day.  And programming......was pretty entertaining lol. We got an extra day to work on our project....and I kinda missed guidance cuz of it =P. Lol it was funny though. Pokan found out Icy's password for Friendster, and then was gonna change it......and for 40 minutes Icy was struggling to keep Pokan and Hermann from changing her PW lol. Then Pokan found out that her password worked for ALL her comp things...MSN, Hotmail, Login name for Comp, etc. So Icy was basically PMSing the whole class......and actually viciously attacked Pokan lmao. Funny watching though. And it's funny how biased Mr. Dayus is lol. He'll get Pokan in trouble......but NEVER Icy. She's always "good." *Cough*. *HACK HACK COUGH.* That was basically main highlight of programming class. I still have to finish up Hyperstudio project. Hmm.....other than that.....yeah the main highlight was the Icy vs. Pokan n' Hermann warz. They are friends but seem so hostile to one another. True blue friendship lol.  Then bused home w/ Ryan. Too tired to go to library.  And now I'm home. See I'm tired....and I can't think of much else to say about my day. And now I'm gonna go nap. Later.

       3/2/04   And still counting down to TC   Yeah you're gonna have to live with my crummy titles for the next....two weeks or so. I can't really think of anything else right now except TC 2004. I can't pay attention in school even. I just doze off and think about how great it's gonna be. Then again...today did have its points where it was kinda amusing....but really I don't like Tuesdays.....the lead to stupid Band Wednesdays.  I've also now concluded......I'm one of the sole survivors of bloggers. Many of my friends have either stopped blogging or have not updated in a while. I don't blame em though....these few weeks have been tough. Well some people that I know of that have stopped blogging.....Jenn. And long-time-no-updaters are Jason, Gavin and Josh. Like I said though I'm not gonna like YELL at them or anything....these weeks have been tough.....and I've been averaging only 6 hours of sleep a night. I'm like a UWO student.....but not quite because I still have food=P. But onto my day......and I'll talk about university when I'm in university.  Life's been a bit hard lately like I've said. I don't get why since report cards are coming out in 3 days, but my teachers are bombarding me with so much crap....that I haven't had much time for drumming or piano. Breaking I still go on Fridays, but at home......not many places to practice since the cars in the garage.  Starting off in the morning....got to school like usual, and Hammond apparently set up everything for the weekend. Wow. Problem is: I can't go cuz it's when HYPE is =P. Also it's at my house......so both ways I'm having fun. So really I'm not complaining about not being able to go to Hammond's lol. I mean in both cases I get food, and have fun. HYPE has always been as blast since it came about. So yeah.....can't go to Hammond's and I'm still with HYPE =P.  Well today in music....we kinda merged classes in the end and that was the main highlight. We played for a bit, and then heard some song on a CD. Then came announcements.  And in science.......MR. CURPHEY'S BACK! No more of some retired Saunders teacher called Mr. Roxburgh. *Shudder* that guy was weird. He seemed to not understand we're in grade 10 math and would make an equation look so hard. Well since he taught us most of the motion unit so far, we don't know much, and most of us didn't do amazing on the Science quiz we had. Amazingly I got perfect! 100%! I was surprised, but not complaining lol. But yeah Mr. Curphey's now on crutches, hobbling around the classroom and still teaching us like his usual self. Lol it's kinda funny cuz we can kinda go milling about in the room and he can't do much about it. Rhoden abused this priviledge by chatting to almost every kid on the left side of the classroom, and by the time Mr. Curphey could hobble over there, Justin would mockingly pretend to hobble away. Yeah Mr. Curphey seems to be having a hard time, but it's cool to see him back. Some kids signed his cast also. And my mark is still at a healthy 87^_^.  Lunch...we went to McD's since it was Big Mac day. Not much amusing stuff happened at lunch....since now there's no  snow bank to be pushed in, and we all know if we push each other in mud, the other guy's gonna die once the muddy dude gets back up. Uhh....oh yeah but Jason came out for lunch today also. We talked about SC at lunch sadly lol.....but eventually we got in a huge convo/debate about how Chinese has no alphabet, and Nate didn't seem to get it. He kept wondering how we write stuff if we don't have an alphabet lol. But yeah in the end I think he finally understood we use CHARACTERS and not every language is based on ENGLISH RULES.  Bio class Melissa's group went today for seminars. Our group really has to start working on ours. It was REALLY BORING though. I slept through most of class.....and most of science class too. I've had good naps in class lately ^_^. Not good though for learning but meh.  English.....handed in book report, and watched the very few people that chose to, do their oral book reports. Yeah all of them were just winging it. Funny though lol. And then she gaves us 40 minutes to complete 17 Romeo & Juliet Q's. Fun. Not. I only got up to 14 and had to hand em in then.  Well now after school. We WERE supposed to Session for a bit....but I dunno where the heck Spencer went, or the twins. Saw Meaghan Tanner....apparently she broke her wrist. Ow. Hope that gets better soon. And then walked outside, about to begin my trek to my bus stop when WHAM! WTH!? Twins were outside!? *Shudder* oh well no session apparently. They had to go places. Anyways.....chatted w/ em for a bit then headed for bus stop. Yeah I'm really tired by now....but I wouldn't sleep as when I got home.....  I ate food. Then went on SC. I was REALLY bored tonight and didn't feel like doing any work, so now I'm really behind in piano theory and practicing=P. Least I got no day 2 h/w, except that stupid science crap. Well then yeah I played a few games of SC, wasn't too bad had a few fun ones. In one game I was playing against all hackers which pissed me off, and John and Age, so I started hacking as much as I could. Stacking, Map Hacking, not letting anyone do anything without my consent or Jason's.....yeah Arve and his friend got really pissed off. But yeah I proved my point in a way. Hacking is really gay. Arve was PMSing afterwards lol. So did that for a while, and then ate, and then played w/ Jeff and some other dudes on SC again, and then h/w. Oh yeah and some piano somewhere in there. Family guy tonight was a repeat.  Hmm yeah school days aren't that exciting. No blog right now even comes close to matching my Huntsville one. Well....I know for a fact TC 2004 will match it=P. Or even exceed it. So much Spiritual growth can happen at that retreat/conference. Last year I still remember....the retreat convinced me that I had to go to service every Sunday, which I'm thankful it did. I mean....without going to church service......How would I have ever gotten closer to Christ? Anyways yeah can't wait till then..and sleepin' early tonight. Band tomorrow....so catch you people later.

       3/1/04   Whoa....March already? Wow.   Yes....I bet you're surprised too. And I'm surprised that I still find the will to blog at 11:45 at night. I guess typing up that book report of mine really spurred my typing fingers right now. I really don't wanna stop typing right now lol. Normally right now I'd do a jot note blog, but nope not today....this is gonna be full length, UNCUT, UNRATED, UN....umm....RELIABLE MEMORY! Well somewhat reliable=P.  But though this is supposed to be a normal blog, it's gonna be somehwat short because I REALLY want to sleep. So to make my morning short......it was a typical morning. Waking up was REALLY difficult today.  But I managed....and still got to school early so I'm ok =P.  History class we are going more "in depth" into WWII. I'm surprised how Canadian history actually tells of how lazy the Allies were in the beginning of the war and would even mention the "Phony War" at the beginning where the Allies declared war, but then didn't do anything basically. WWII history can be somewhat boring....since we haven't even hit Pearl Harbour yet. And also I'm a pretty big WWII history buff, so right now this stuff is LAME. I only like the parts where guns are the focal point. We watched a pretty interesting movie though. This Russian somehow disguised himself as a German and was sent to Hitler Youth. The movie showed the Hitlter Youth camps, and wow.....they are twisted. Also got history test of the Dirty 30's back...I GOT 100% SOMEHOW! WOW! AMAZING! YES MY MARK WILL GO UP NOW! Hmm.......and then Civics class.  Don't really remember what we did today.....OH YEAH wrote a stupid note on Canadian government hierachy basically. CANADIAN PM MAKES 140,000 A YEAR FOR SITTING ON HIS BUTT APPOINTING PEOPLE TO DO STUFF! Ugh.....how unbalanced this world is. I should make that much going to school. Oh yeah and the fact that our Governor General spent 1 million dollars of OUR TAXPAYER MONEY for a 3 week vacation in Europe. You wonder why Canada can't afford an army. And the story of how one senator only went to work 12 times in 10 years and still got paid the same 70,000 a year plus a 10,500 tax free allowance and 64 free first class air tickets to anywhere in Canada. Wow......how corrupt our government is.  Lunch.......went to Galleria. Had pizza today. Interesting how there was an expo for volunteer organizations today. So I decided to pick up a form for London Public Library. Could work who knows? And also picked up a job application form from City Hall for summer job. Thompson got the two forms also.  Math we had a quiz. got 75%. *Shrug.*  Programming last day on working on project....now we gotta do it on our own time. GAY GAY GAY.  Today at home.......lounged around for a bit.....bought some new clothes from Winners *whoo* and then did h/w. And then now blogging.  *Yawn* yeah I'm gettin pretty tired now. Sorry if this blog sucks I realize it does too. I'm getting bored from typing it even. But I can't think at midnight.......MUST SLEEP! *WUMP*

       4/30/04   Another Friday of tiring self out   Relaxing Friday? PHHHT That hasn't been on the menu for a while lol. Friday's always consists of cramming for piano, UCC, and other various activities that seems to kill away my Fridays very quickly. Not that I don't like that.....in fact I enjoy it but time flies fast enough....ugh why does time have to seem to fly faster? It's like time puts on NOS boosters whenever I do something fun. But enough of the complaining...my day was.........pretty amusing I guess =P.  Senior band was much more interesting today. We played Godzilla Eats Las Vegas as opposed to the last 7 weeks where we practiced Vesuvius and our challenge pieces for Kiwanis. Gets so boring after 3 weeks....so yeah I'm happy that we have a change of course FINALLY. First time fully rehearsing Godzilla.........didn't sound bad actually. Sounds pretty cool actually I think =P. Senior band is a lot more exciting than Intermediate....as I've mentioned many times before. And also....  Apparently Senior band made the Kiwanis "Stars of the Festival" concert for Vesuvius. SHWEET! WE DID AN "OUTSTANDING" performance as described by Kiwanis. So after that excitement walked by....basically band was over....and Mrs. Wharton put on our recording of Vesuvius of our Senior Band on as 1st period music filed in for another day of productive "learning."  Music class we learned more about music history....nothing big. After that..........Mrs. Wharton announced that we will begin our quest to search for our solo piece for our final project. Hmm.....this year though we can't play anything too modern. Blast. So I'm stuck with pretty bland music for Trombone. All the songs are so crappy...and lame. So I decided to pretend to look like I was doing something class related....by looking through the crappy books we were provided with...and then thought "Ok...I'm goin' to Belle Air for music." Then I blared around on the piano for a bit..and class was over. Yes time flies.....then again it is Music....one class that I never like missing =P. Yeah also asked if I could play keys next year for Jazz band....but she would rather have me on Trombone. Ergh....  So after that good old science class *Shudder.* What a horrifying class. It's so lame especially when you're doing ECOLOGY. WHOA LOOK SNAKES EAT MICE....WHO THE HELL CARES?! I'D RATHER BE MORE AMUSED LOOKING AT THE FOOD I WILL BE INDULGING IN THE NEXT 60 MINUTES AFTER THIS RETARDED CLASS. *ding ding* YES THE BELL!  Lunch today: good old Galleria. Got one of those pancake breakfasts....which I haven't had in ages. So ate one of those......Mike had a sunburn so smacked him across the back after he nearly pushed me into a garbage can.....and John hit Mike a few times too lol. Tip: When you have a sunburn..don't piss off your friends =P. Quick lunch.....I wanted Jasper's today though. Their food is startin' to really be good......mmmmm perogies and quesadillas....and pizza....mmmmmmmmmmmm.....................foooood...  Bio class was pretty lame. Watched some video we've watched already and I slept through most of it. Not very exciting....  English we started our exam guiding.....pretty fun I guess. Figured out me and Kurtis have the Oct. 12 as our B-days....which means I ain't the only kid that doesn't have their G1 till then. Nothing much really happens in english....read a bit....and today we are just preparing for our essay exam......*shrug*  After school......headed for home. Took the bus w/ Ryan and we decided to meet up at the park to play some ball after school. So got home....quickly grabbed a sandwich to eat...then headed out for the park...  Played some ball for 'bout 40 minutes or so....then we left. Well he left first....then I left 10 minutes later. Eventually though I'd still end up playing a bit more ball when I headed to UCC....except basically me and Dan were the only people @ UCC playing ball lol. So went home.......did some stuff around the house...piano,drums,etc. and then headed out to UCC after a dinner of a omlette that sorta resembled a Western omlette   No breakin' tonite....just workin' out w/ Marcello and Dan and then some ball on my own since no one seems to be at UWO now since everyone's GONE. So did some cardio...weights *my arms are useless right now literally* and then balled. Then went home...  And here I am....desperately trying to organize everything for the weekend. HYPE schedule....praise for Sunday....etc. Yeah I really feel like a secretary right now....only thing I'm missing is a phone headset and a coffee machine. Later.

       4/29/04   HYPE for May-June: All Wendy and Kendrick lol   School may not have been exciting today....but after school life was pretty amusing. Well it wasn't my average Thursday at least.....had to go to Josh's to plan for HYPE over the summer. Then after that.......explored for the first time the Adidas Outlet store down on Fanshawe Park....which I thought pretty much sucked. But school did have its bright side I guess.....I think I aced a trigonometry test....and Mr. Brown subbing for Civics is pretty funny. Anywho for the rest of my day...  I woke up at 720 this morning like usual time......and I actually felt refreshed from a good night's sleep for once. I think I was talking in my sleep last night though......well for some reason I recall doing that...plus my mom thought she heard me talking to myself in my sleep. Heh haven't done that in ages....last time I recall doing that was grade 5. So anyways after pondering for a few minutes about whether I was talking out loud while sleeping or not....I finally decided that I did and then headed downstairs for my breakfast...I ate that...and then morning routine...and then headed to school.  At school......well I got there somewhat early today....and then headed into History class after chatting with Pourier about yesterday's Kiwanis....which like I said we blew total crap. After that headed upstairs then...and then headed into history.....preparing for the dreaded test that we......  DON'T HAVE?! AUGH IT'S POSTPONED AGAIN! Actually wait.....SHWEET IT'S POSTPONED AGAIN! Though I wasted one hour doing something I didn't have to do.......at least I have more time to study now =). Apparently Ms. Manson was at a track meet......so Mr. Campbell came into teach us today. Apparently last class they watched the Nuremburg trials....which are REALLY pointless and lame. I mean why would you charged someone for murder when they were under order to? It's not THEIR fault that Hitler told them to...if they didn't they would have died. That's what I really don't get about these trials....and apparently some people even now are still trying to hunt down the Nazi veterans. Their 90 now for crying out loud leave them be! Might as well let them live out their old.....quiet lives now. Well after finishing that stupid movie *most of them got hanged* we then had Mrs. Bailey come in. *Shudder* she's loud....old....and annoying. She's like your typical old person. She tells us to shut up....and then 5 minutes later she starts blabbering. Ugh can she ever shut up....she's worst than those FOBS at Weldon Library that Cynthia described in her blog. I mean talk is good.....but when your teacher is blabbing about economics in history class.....and about how London has no outlet stores though it does......it kinda ticks me off sometimes. She seems crazy sometimes too. Well after history though.....we had another two sub teachers for Civics...  Civics never seems to liven up. Watching a video with some kid narrarating how Parliament is "exciting" doesn't make life much more exciting in that drab Room 308 during civics class. Then after the video though.....Mr. Brown came in to teach a bit of civics. Somehow....he actually made it seem exciting. He imitated some parliament dudes which got us all kinda laughing plus he also talked about USEFUL things....like how much a MP gets paid....which is apparently a CRAPLOAD. I can see why law class is pretty popular @ Central. He's a pretty cool teacher. Well after a quick 40 minutes or so with him teaching....it was lunch. Fastest civics class ever I think happened today =P.  For lunch....well Nate headed to Stobie's so me and John headed to Jasper's. Brescia came too...but she had to walk to a bus stop....apparently she forgot something at home lol. Had a pizza at Jasper's today that was REALLY good and John apparently got addicted to Chimichangas...or however you spell it. You know.....deep fried wrap w/ chili and stuff and you serve it with sour cream or salsa? Anyways he said it's REALLY good...but the pizza at Jasper's ain't bad either. Monica, Maisie and Pokan came to Jasper's too....and apparently Pokan and Monica were figuring out their essays or sometin' for their english class. HAH we do ours next Thursday lol. So for today I studied trig @ lunch....and then after a bit me and John headed back to school for our math test.....  Math test: was easier than I thought. Hmm it's kinda funny......but it seems as though as my Spiritual Life grows....school stress seems to lessen and lessen more. God really makes his presence when you ask him for it. Well I believe that at least anyways if you don't....but really last few months....entrusting Christ with more and more of my life....things have really been flowing as well as water flowing through a river. Today's test seemed to be fairly easy....and I hope that Mike did alright also. Well it SEEMED easy at least....who knows maybe I did everything wrong lol....hope not though. Well after the test.....  PROGRAMMING! Like usual......much typing.....and trying to crunch the many Syntax errors within my program down. Eventually with the help of Mr. Dayus I solved the problems.....and now we are onto a project where we have to animate a whole animation thing. I was gonna do Super Mario....but decided that's too hard so I'm gonna maybe make a robber steal something.....or maybe a plane. *Shrug* I'll figure it out later....my head was hurting at the time.  So after school now....WHOOOOO! Took Springbank up to Josh's. Realized two things while on bus:  1)Bus drivers in London are much more polite than Toronto drivers 2)Reading PDL seems so much easier on a bus than at home  I don't see how......but reading Purpose Driven Life is so much easier on bus. Not as many distractions as at home.....plus it's so quiet on the bus....at home there's TV....Compy....MSN's constant *doo doo doo* or something like that. And the bus driver started talking to me. Like a regular daily convo. Well me being a loudmouth I started talking also....and before I knew it 30 minutes had passed....and I was at my stop. In Toronto it took forever for me to even just get a transfer lol. So like I said....before I knew it I was already at my stop. Talked to Justin Deyell while on the bus.....plus some girl that I don't remember that somehow remembers me from Pearson. Don't really know her name...but I've seen her around school once or twice.  So after walking up this massive hill to Josh's place....FINALLY started our meeting for HYPE planning. This will be the last one Ali will attend....and also the first one for our summer term. Surprisingly everyone was early lol....so Wendy's plan worked haha. Basically planned out HYPE for May and June....mostly Kendrick and Wendy will handle it *with Theresa "guest-starring" a few times* and also we talked a lot about the three kids comin' in from Sunday School group in September. Also a few pondered about whether we will have new counselors next year. Hmm...so far our summer seems pretty relaxed compared to school year HYPE....and yeah we'll be packing lots of fun nights and stuff lol....mostly because well....IT'S SUMMER! Everyone's lazy =P.  Got a ride back to my place from Kendrick.....before that though we all stopped at Fast Eddie's for some burgers and fries. Seems to be a favourite place for UWO students to go to lol....plus I think now that that would be the last time I'll see Ali as part of HYPE. Didn't realize that at the moment....but now that I think about it....yeah I think it was. Bummer. Kinda funny but I think I'm the last HYPEr to see Ali before she's leavin'. Oh well...time must move on I guess....and as that cheesy drama saying goes "The show must go on."  Afterwards made my first ever trip to Adidas Outlet store...which really isn't that grand and then headed home....  and now I'm here. Bloggin' yet again. Sleepin' soon though since I got band tomorrow....gonna watch a bit of hockey though if it's on. Wonder if the games are over yet? *shrug* Later people.

       4/28/04   School? uhh...Oh yes right that =P   Hehe almost forgot about that government facility that over 5000 kids in London go to 5/7 days of the week. Why? Well simply because I barely went to school today lol. Oh yes.....the Kiwanis festival has once again pulled me out of class and killed 4/5 of my schoolday, since today was also Early Dismissal. With all that into play, I was in school today for a total of......100 minutes? =P.  My day started off with brass ensemble this morning.....and would be our only time rehearsing for our Kiwanis class later on in the morning lol. So got up.....trudged outta bed.......morning routine and *zing* I was off to school...  Ergh.......now sitting in room 125 like every other band rehearsal.....and we sound like crap. With the added problems like half of the people can't count....and another few I don't understand why they are in Gr. 10 music.....we took one hour to rehearse the one and only song we are performing and we still sounded like crap. So after that grueling one hour practice......we sat in music class.....  for the duration of 50 minutes that it lasts. Then.......OFF TO KIWANIS! WHO CARES IF WE SUCK......AT LEAST WE ARE MISSING CLASS.........and there's nothing anyone can do about it =P. Oh yeah something interesting in announcements today:   ME AND JOHN MADE 7TH PLACE IN GUYS DOUBLES IN TVRAA!=)   That's one place higher than our original seeding! AND WE ARE IN TOP 10! WHOOOOOO! So we didn't do AS  bad as thought.....which is good. So there....some hope for me and John's badminton career =P.  Summarizing today's Kiwanis in one word: Crap. Total Crap. Finlan's trombone skillz would actually look mediocre for once if he played today.......so after a lecture about how we sucked, and what we could improve from our total suckage we left the Salvation Army Citadel....and sat on their lawn waiting for the bus. The bus ride there and back was filled with many various convos.......ranging from chicks to Star Trek.....and Family Guy. Yeah the minds of various gr. 10's. So vast and bubbling with so many...uhh.....already existent ideas and stereotypical thoughts =P.  SO arriving back to school..........ARGH 40 MINUTES LEFT OF SCHOOL! Was gonna go out for lunch....but some people from Kiwanis went back to class already so it'd be kinda funny how I didn't make it yet the others did. English class consisted of reading though so no biggie. Rain Fall is getting to be a better and better  book now....plus Fried Green Tomatoes is kinda picking up also. Reading's becoming a DECENT pastime now =P. But 40 minutes passes by quickly.....as this paragraph will. POOF!  YAY NO MORE SCHOOL FOR A DURATION OF MANY HOURS! After school......I was gonna go ball w/ Jason @ UCC.....but Indoor Soccer had its time at UCC after school. So for alternate plan: LAN gaming at Head 2 Head. Met up with John...and headed out to downtown. Actually......UCC was 2nd plan come to think of it, since me and John planned to go gaming earlier =P. Oh well anyways to the subject.....stopped at Jaspers for lunch...where eventually we cancelled and John ended up getting a Java for no reason....and headed to Head 2 Head.....where lunch would consist of microwavable food *hot dogs and mini pizzas =P......mmmmm the unhealthy goodness=P.* First up on our gaming list: C&C Generals....  As we kept going on playing various games.......it started raining outside. Lauren would tell me later at theory that it was apparently freezing rain and hail...and she had to bike in it. Poor kiddo lol. Jason would eventually head off to play SC.....while me and John went to play some Quake III....  Our contrasting gaming styles once again cause John to win...but I killed him a few times =P.  Then: BF1942. Jason would join in this too...and we played mostly holdout maps *D-Day* and urban fights *Stalingrad and Berlin.* It's kinda cool though how realistic programming has got over the years.....I still remember back when......well Doom was 2D lol. So we played BF for a bit...then went on to BFV.....where backstabbing became a trend for us lol.  Yeah we pretty much made a good looking game look its worst. We butchered it a lot with stupid acts like sinking our own boat, fighting each other and roadkilling one another. John was driving full steam into me with a jeep....I machine gunned him....eventually we both died lol. Head 2 Head I don't think will ever get boring.........may sound geeky but meh games can still be fun every once in a while =P. I'm not 40 just yet hehe.  And so home......after tiring gaming....slept lol.  *2 hours later*  THEORY CLASS. Whoo. Didn't do much....overlooked papers......and hoped for the best as May 8th slowly comes closer. Hmm......only a week left......and I still need to do a few papers lol......I should be  done soon though....only got a few questions left =P. Cramming rules haha...  Anyways back home now....cramming for history and overlookin' trigonometry stuff. Goin' to bed now though....hehe prayers for my history test and math test to go well....God I know you're with me......and I really hope you'll help me and whoever else with these upcoming tests. Last month and half of school left.....as Simon on his blog said for his UWO exams:  HOME STRETCH!  This right now feels like the home stretch.....last 100m before Summer Holidays! HURRY UP!  Sayonara.

       4/27/04   Conference Today....GRRR NO WOSSAA!   Argh......the bitter taste of loss when it's just so close to a victory. When you get eliminated by STA 1 and then lose to Saunders 3.....yeah it really sucks. I feel like the Red Wings right now back in 2003 when the Ducks killed them in a 4-0 series. Ergh......and I was so close to making quarters. If only we got by them....cuz next team I know we coulda won. Oh well.....we made a decent run for 8th seeded team I guess. I'm surprised we even got seeded lol.....we went to one quad meet and *POOF* we are in 8th place. Well though me and John's hopes are now crushed for making guys doubles in WOSSAA.....there's still next year......or the year after that. Hopefully in one of them we make it. This spring/summer: Badminton Practice.....LOTS of it. Plus volunteer work/basketball/usual stuff I do in summer. But other than that....BADMINTON lol. On the bright side though.....least I got to miss school =).  Though school wasn't on the menu today.....I still had to wake up at 7:20 to get ready for badminton. Lucky I packed everything last night.....so this morning I just had to jump in the car and go on my way to STA. Breakfast this morning consist of rice.....and some other stuff since I wanted carbs....as so rumours say a carb meal is good before sports. So after that....quickly brushed my teeth n' stuff and then headed out....all set and ready for the day that lies of head for badmintonage.  Got to STA around......8ish? Saw Meaghan struggling to find an entrance so we eventually found the front entrance. STA's announcements are much different from ours. After the anthem they seem to say something......like a prayer of some sort before the day starts. I didn't know so when I began walking and then heads turned....yeah I realized something was different lol. Plus I was actually kinda amazed that kids are independently standing in the middle of the halls for the anthem. At Central....if a teacher doesn't see you.....normally kids will just walk to wherever they are going. I was surprised that students actually showed respect during the anthem. Maybe Catholic Schools do have something different. *Shrug* Well after that headed around the school.....trying to find the gym in a school seeming to be 4x the size of Central. Eventually we managed to....and......  WOW THEIR GYM IS SMALL. Well compared to Saunders. Maybe every gym is this size around town....but their gym seemed somewhat small. So warmed up.....rallied a bit with John.....and then talked to the people I know there. Calvin, and the few who I've played before already. The dude quickly made a few announcements *the organizer* and then....LET THE GAMES BEGIN. So grabbed my Gatorade, raquet, and headed to Game 1 of the day: Central 1 *me and John* Vs. CCH 3.  Not being in competition badminton for a year.....I felt kinda shaky. But as we rallied, and then got into our game face.....the game blew by pretty quickly. Two quick victories of 11-2 and 11-1. Fun fun ^_^. OOOOH so this is what guys doubles is like at conference level. So me and John....shining with our victory reported the score, and then waited for our next game....which wasn't for a while. So heaaded up to the mezzaine to watch the games......and we see Hermann. HUH? Yeah weird but guess he skipped school for badminton spectating. So talked to him for a bit, then Calvin, Pokan.....and then headed downstairs to get ready for 2nd game. Just before that though.....John apparently met his heavily-stoning partner...whatever the hell his name was.....but John seems to have lots of nicknames varying from Mophead to T-Time lol. After chattin' for a bit, we headed down then. Surprisingly.....Central's doubles teams would all make it through first round. SHWEET! lol.  And so to our 2nd game: Central 1 Vs. Holy Cross 1....  We whooped them lol. First game 11-2.....and I guess 2nd game they picked up the pace a bit so 11-7. Whew I was thinking "Crap......tiebreaker" but it never happened =). So won that....and up next.....the dreaded, and most infamous.....STA 1. *Eep*.  Before that though....a quick lunch =). Ate a granola bar+a Snickers, downed with nothing else but Gatorade.....mmmmmmm. Then Josh came down for his lunch also and chatted for a bit. Yeah he told us we were screwed......much the same way Calvin did:  "Have fun"  Why am I so intimidated by STA 1 you ask? Uhh.......*COUGH.*  Even though we had time of rest......OMG WE GOT OWNED lol.I can see why Josh and Calvin were pretty much anticipating my loss. They didn't look that good...Short kids.......and one seemed to be anorexic lol. I can see why he was nicknamed "Bones." Even with that though.....when gametime came.....1st set me and John got shut out for the first time in our lives. First time in my badminton career at least....and IT HURTS. Just knowing the fact that every serving attempt you had was wiped out by an onslaught of smashes, and you can't do anything about it since me and John only clear for smash reception.....yeah we lost pretty bad....and were pretty peeved cuz of it. 2nd game though, we did what no other team before us did.....  WE MANAGED TO PUT OURSELVES ON THE BOARD!  YES! 3 POINTS! THOUGH IT WAS A HUMILIATING 11-3 LOSS......BUT WE ARE NOW KNOWN AS THE ONLY TEAM TO HAVE SCORED 3 POINTS ON THEM! GING AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who cares if we lost....we did what no other team has managed to do yet =). We had this one mad play though during the 2nd match. Though I don't remember it really since I was the one diving.....but what pretty much happened was I received two smashes, dived for a third, then John took in 3 and then we took it home.....OUR FIRST POINT! In a REALLY good rally. Like I said before though...we got wrecked lol. And coaching did nothing since Ms. Bates seems to only state the obvious. Gah why couldn't our student coaches be here they actually PLAY badminton. Oh well.......least I lost knowing I lost to the 1st seeded team in the league....no Mighty Ducks story for me. You stay underdog....you lose underdog =P.  Yup.......now we are in elimination round......last team from Central to have it occur to us. First game we played: We played Central 2...  Yes.....the irony/crappiness of that. First game we play in elimination we play our own school. Plus after that game the victor plays either some other school or Central 3. So basically our school killed ourselves. Josh came down again after our loss to STA.....and actually congratulated me and John on our defense. WHOOOOO! We are now officially labeled:   DEFENSIVE TEAM CENTRAL!   "Least we are good at something" as Josh said. And it's true. 3/4 of the teams come with no technique, offense, or defense whatsoever. At least we had one half....and this summer we are hoping to develop the 2nd half. And so after that talk.....he had to head to class....and me and John had to prepare to whoop Finlan and Hughes' asses. Not the coolest thing playing your team....but we were victorious happy to know we owned Finlan in both games=). Team unity there eh lol.  And so the game began with us whooping them.....and it ended with us whooping them. The game was pretty one sided.....and we managed to really beat them pretty bad. Finlan doesn't move....and Alex really does try his hardest it seems.....but when you got a gimpy partner....yeah times can be difficult. So finally....me and John are the lone survivors from Central Secondary School in this conference final.....all the other teams are now gone....including our girls doubles squad which got chewed up pretty badly in the beginning few matches. And so after that victory......our final game was at hand: Central. Vs. the humiliating Saunders 3....where ironically we somehow lost.....we didn't bring our A game for sure....more like our B Game....or maybe C. Both ways......we sucked pretty badly.  It started with a crappy 3-0 run by them....where we eventually caught up but just couldnt keep the pace. Eventually we lost around 11-7.....which really sucked and in 2nd game we just blew it and loste11-4. It was pretty bad....and so that was the end to me and John's doubles badminton season. Beats last year at least...both of us crapped out much more than this year....and this year we actually managed to get past 2nd round.....WHOA!!!! Well he did....last year I got beaten out since my partner seems to struggle at figuring out how to hold a badminton raquet.  So then we stopped at Angelo's....bought some food and then gave him a lift back home and I went home...ate then slept.  *Three hours later*  Here I am blogging once again...bleh today had its good times and its bad times. We had our good beginning run but then was abruptly shut down by STA....and then got our bags packed by STA. *Sigh* oh well there's next year still and gr. 12 like I said....so two more chances of making regional finals.....er actually provincial in senior and then it's over for me and high school badminton.  Now I go eat dinner and then do homework. WHOO HOO early dismissal tomorrow! Can't wait =).  Cya.

       4/26/04   One more Kiwanis event to go.....AND FINALLY I SEE GOLD!   After some nervous playing....and fumbling with the trombone slide....I FINALLY SEE GOLD AT KIWANIS WITH SENIOR BAND! Now at first....I was kinda expecting a silver since we had the same communist-like adjudicators as when Intermediate band played....but once we heard Lucas got Gold....I started thinking "YES WE HAVE A CHANCE!" And we did =). Central got gold....PLUS A TROPHY! Ahh yes....so Kiwanis now I've got a glimpse at every sort of make-believe Kiwanis earth metal there is. I've technically got 1 Gold, 4 Silvers, and 1 Bronze. This is including band stuff and my regular stuff. So if I had Kiwanis bling....I'd be blingified =P. Plus I missed lots of school.....production at its best =P.  So my day today started with the awakening of me around 7:20 or so. Ate, morning routine, and then headed out the door.....carrying a whole bunch of crap for school today. Badminton stuff, music stuff, school stuff, other stuff....like I said lots of stuff. Hmm dunno why but I was pretty cheery today....guess I was excited for Kiwanis....plus NO SCHOOL TOMORROW *badminton conference *AND EARLY DISMISSAL WEDNESDAY. OOOOOOOOH yes...sweet sweet luxury of no school =)....or very little.  Well after dumping most of my junk in my locker, I preceded heading to first period: Music Class. Mostly all we did today was listen to our performance on Thursday......which was pretty bad. That was Communism day....and it sucked. No worries though I'm not complaining THAT much about it....since I guess we're lucky we didn't get Bronze. Would have been humiliating being only school with a bronze...especially being Central. So we talked about how we sucked, and how we did DECENT I guess.....and then some music history! Whoo. I just LOVE learning about the music periods *not.*  After that class.....SCIENCE. Slept through some video about endangered Species. Don't remember much. For some reason there was an ant infestation near my desk. Squashed most of em....reminded me of SST commercials in the movie lol. Science class....argh how I wish the school year would end quicker. I've survived 7 months of this crap already....JUST ONE MORE MONTH! Er.....1 and a half or so.  Lunch: Well I was thinking of playing Baddy @ lunch....but couldn't resist going to Jasper's for lunch. Especially today....I definitely don't regret going out for lunch. PEROGIES ON SPECIAL!?!?!?!? Mmmmm.....who cares if it was $6.00?! THEY'RE PEROGIES! Plus I got a Caesar Salad. Oh yes....who cares about badminton when you have FOOD?! GOOD FOOD! Mmm.....Perogies ^_^.  After lunch.....afternoon went sorta like this:  Bio class: note-taking + tirendess makes Joe tired. Not many jokes today or anything....pretty below-average class. We did some note taking. Oh yeah and I took down a whole note....AND THEN FIND THE HANDOUT AFTERWARDS IN MY BINDER. ARGH! STUPID UNORGANIZATION *whaps head on table* OW!  English class.....since we were supposed to be doing exams but they are postponed for various reasons.......we read....a crapload. And first day of "what are you reading" book reports. Random choosing of people to talk about their book. Whitney and Mike I remember went up...and I think Lilian was the last person. Looks easy enough....all that happens is we get interrogated about our book, and then sit down and she writes down a mark. Beats writing out reports =P.  After English.....yeah picked up Senior band uniform and then Stage Band X practice. Ran through some songs.....went over adjudication for Stage Band X and then baddy practice. Not much happened. My whole after school was quite a blur. Went home then to eat and then headed out for senior band which I've talked about already.  Anyways I'm out for  the night. Gotta sleep early for baddy conference tomorrow. Wish me Luck! Gavin managed to make it to WOSSAA for singles....Hope me and Mophead can do the same for doubles =). Later.

       4/25/04   Two more days until conference...   Though this may not be exciting or nerve-racking for some....but for me.....a average badminton player who's playing doubles this year....I WANNA MAKE IT INTO WOSAA............if I can. Well....there's two more days....so quickly practice....and hope for the best I guess haha. Good day mostly today.....mostly badminton....plus some jamming w/ Gavin and of course church. Hmm guess a usual Sunday I guess...plus 5 hours of badminton....and just awaiting the time of Conference Finals...plus more Kiwanis still lol...  After catching some shut eye, I finally woke up around 830 or so and quickly ran around the house getting ready for church. Scrambling around for my things and gettin dressed and all......yeah by the time we headed out the door.....I was tired =P. So picked up Lina....and then drove down to Jason's to get him too....and then off we were. While passing by Mykono's this time....I ACTUALLY NOTICED IT! Unlike the usual "uh what's that dump?" Now that place has itself nestled into the food section of my brian =). Mmmm....foooood.  So finally getting to church....we were early...something we needed though since we had to haul in a thing or two into the church...mostly chairs we borrowed for BBQ. And then we headed upstairs....where umm a guest person was doing Praise & Worship. Originally I think Gavin was asked by Pastor Dale....but this weeks been REAL busy for many of us. With dinner, farewell for some HYPE members and for me Kiwanis and Badminton....life's been pretty hectic lol. But worship was still good....and today in the message we now have completed studying Phillipians. Our final memory verse from the of UWO school year:  "And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus" -Phillipians 4:19  Today's sermon we learned about sharing, and one big thing that caught my attention was though Paul SEEMED like he'd be a hated man going through so much suffering for Christ, so many Christians back then supported him with so much. So suffering for Christ....in return you do get rewarded and God does have backup planned for you =).  After that we went downstairs, chatted....then headed into Sunday school where we learned about Jonah today. So far in the book.....we just got past the part where he gets eaten by the GIANT FISH....not WHALE. Afterwards.....well me, Jason, and Calvin may have a Hoop-It-Up team this year haha.....but we still need to find a centre. Jacky said he may...so YES MAYBE we have a team already MAUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Fiddled around with guitar *I CAN SUCCESSFULLY CHANGE FROM G, TO C, TO E-MINOR TO A NOW!* and then headed home....taking Gavin, Lina, and Jason also.  Well took Lina and J home....and Gavin came over for a bit of jamming w/ drums and geektar. Ate first of course....who can forget lunch and then jammed.....that's basically what we did for an hour, then played PS2, Compy, and then headed to badminton....  Now since I'm running low on time....and my eyes are struggling to stay above my pupils....I'll summarize my evening with this one word:  BADMINTON.  It's great =P.  Later.

       4/24/04   So much for adjusting back to normal life...   Heh seems like a ritorical statement I made yesterday about me going back to normal. Truthfully....after today....yeah a normal average Joe life still hasn't gone by. Today was just as hectic and crazy as any other day of this week lol. So today's Saturday was a really fun, exciting, and jumbled addition to the rest of my week. Very fun though......as mentioned before plus tried Greek cuisine for the first time in my life today...which I must say is GOOOOD!  With Kiwanis over, I decided to slack off this week from piano. It's kinda at the bottom of my list now with theory and other things to finish. so today.....being the lazy one that I am...I woke up around 1130ish. Ahh yes sleep....but then the annoyance of being waked up by the aroma of a barbecue getting up and running. Ok so not ANNOYING exactly but.....still disturbing lol. The aroma of BBQ sauce dripping into the fire, the sizzling of the steak being BBQ'd and all....yeeeeah it was a good aroma lol. So falling into the temptation *OH NO.....TEMPTATION* I quickly ran downstairs, grabbed a plate, rice, and quickly ran out to the wood deck to grab a piece of steak. Yeah savouring the previews to this afternoon's BBQ day for my English Service....mmmmmmmm good steak ^_^. So after eating that steak.....headed out the door for my usual Saturday piano lesson.  Lalalala.....yup at piano lessons now. Like usual congratulates me on my achievements in Kiwanis....and she even thought was total b/s how some girl won playing a piece that was out of the rules. Grr....coulda got two seconds =@! Oh well.....least I still won something I guess....not everything's a win win situation. Today didn't do much actual playing.....more of "Joe let's mark your theory....even though you're coming later!" So yeah now I've got all my theory marked....and I am still on my quest to complete final 5 papers. Pray for me to finish 'em by May 5th lol. Procrastination is not the key in this case =P. Oh yeah and apparently Mrs. Mitsis told that Helen person to look for me at  school because she needs help on Latin Prelude....which I'm pretty good at. OOOOK so she's not a stalker *whew* lol.  Got home after lesson.....and to my not-so-surprised self everyone was there at the BBQ already. Mmm....the food.....and everything....yeah good times this afternoon. So much steak....and the salad was pretty good too. Dad came through again for being the master chef he is.....and really cooked up a good meal today for everyone. Think 50 people showed up in the end.....pretty crowded out in backyard though. Fun times though....with all the jokes and stuff. The steak instantly reminded me, Josh and Gavin about Ju Pah.....lol plus we would be reminded @ Mykono's also =P. Oh yeah and I've now set the bar of insect classification as this:  "Anything below 5 feet is an insect..." *COUGHREBECCACOUGH!*  Well in the end that burn didn't work anyways....since she's past the 5 foot mark now lol....and Jenn I think just misses that mark too haha=P.  Well after eating...we headed downstairs to watch my newly bought movie....KILL BILL *again.* I've seen it 3 times already in two days....and the 3rd time watching it today was no different. I'm still somehow amused by the movie...  So yeah pretty much everyone thought was pretty good movie. Many think it's funny how the excessive blood squirting is amusing *I did a bit.....I mean it does sorta look like fruit punch* and also few of 'em liked my favourite part with the "Wiggle your big toe." I won't reveal much of the movie.....so go rent/buy it on your own =P. *Shudder* one downside/upside of showing the movie today though....  First the downside:  CALVIN CAN'T EVER SHUT UP DURING A MOVIE! Throughout the movie he'd honestly ask some of the dumbest questions ever. I mean not trying to be mean....but when someone's squirting litres of blood....THEY'RE DEAD CALVIN. Also CORN POPS DON'T RANDOMLY FIRE OUT LIKE A BULLET FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CEREAL BOX.....as he somehow cluelessly thought does.  But the upside:  Calvin can never deny his somewhat often occuring stupidity ever again =P. This is going to haunt him for a while....and as Gavin says:  "You are now officially out of the movie watchers club. The club: everyone else."  Jokes jokes Calvin....but honestly smarten up at times lol.  So after watching the  movie for the 3rd time....it was four....wait....FOUR!? CRAP! And I quickly rush out to car and dad drove me to theory class....EMERGENCY THEORY CLASS. Everyone else was still at my place.....so don't know what they did lol. But on my perspective of the afternoon.....  Yup....so I got to my theory class late....but meh s'all good I'm only just trying to find some time to really cram in some theory....which I managed to do. Started paper 10, and did a lot in the other ones. Also chatted with the few people I knew there *NO ONE FROM THEORY 3 WHY!?* so managed to talk with Jaclyn and Lindsay while there lol. Though I'm mostly totally out of the bubble they have, there were a few things we could relate to. Normally I don't really see 'em much at school....hmm I think mainly because I guess I chill w/ different people? Not that I don't like em....actually they real cool people...just rarely seem em lol. So sat a round there until 5:15....where after a photo or two and grabbing a donut *something we get everytime at a theory "clinic" hobbled out of her house and then jumped in my car.....and off to Mykono's we go!  Judging this restaurant is like judging a book by its cover. The outside....when I saw it for the first time *er noticed it more like* my first thought:  "O M G I'm going to this dump for dinner on Saturday?"  Turns out I was totally wrong...the inside is actually pretty sweet.....and plus their little tented area where our HYPE group sat in....was pretty cool =P. So well....the HYPE counselors like usual arrived according to Chinese time *around 15 minutes late* and Ali couldn't manage to find Mykono's until she called Brian lol. Theresa thought the same as me also from what I heard about the whole...."eew we going to this shack?" but in the end it all worked out I think. Well at least for me it did....I don't complain about a restaurant that serves REALLY good food. Few people ordered souvlakis, one table just ordered an appetizer plate or two to share among themselves....Josh ordered this kickass Greek coffee and some steak meal...and I got myself Greek-Style Lasagna and a Frappe. Aww crap forgot the word for greek coffee w/out sugar now. But gotta try that next time. Coffee tasted like coffee....with a tang of "huong dow saah" *cheesy direct translation to "red bean dessert"* lol. My frappe was amazin'....plus the greek lasagna.....*mmm.....lasagna.* Oh yeah and Greek salad I've never actually known to be this good. Feta cheese on salad is actually a great combo. I think I'm gonna become a lover of Greek cuisine now after today...gotta go there again =P. Plus ONLY PLACE I'VE EVER SEEN IN LONDON THAT SELLS LAMB CHOPS! So those meats they sell at meat shops labelled "Lamb" does get business from some places lol.  So after that scrumptous and eye-opening dinner into a new world of cuisine....I hopped into Kendrick's car along with Dan, Jason, and Gavin and we headed to BKung's place. Lol but before that....the crazy car rides that Kendrick somehow manages. First off.....drag racing a Jetta Vs. Brian's Protoge....LOL hilarious. Jetta killed the little Jap Lawn Mower.....and we then stopped by at a Shopper's Drug Mart to buy some food and stuff for tonight....so did that....then back we went into Kendrick's Crayonmobile *it smells like crayons for some reason.* And off to Brian's.  *Sigh* yeah tonight's the last meeting for JT and Ali. We'll be missin' em a lot...and on a personal note:  Thanks JT and Ali for all you two have done for our HYPE group along with the other counselors. May Christ keep on shining within in you guys in whatever future paths you may step into. We'll all miss you always...and you both will be in my mind forever....with the amount of work you've put into helping LCAC grow furthermore and putting a HUGE stepping stone in my Walk of Faith....or if you want a big boost for me. Thanks a lot to both of you guys.....and keep in touch!  But before that....we had some time of fellowship. Tonight just getting closer with one another with many games and just chillin' with people. Played some Bible Pictionary, and then after that the card game "Killer." They then went on to play Yuker....but me, Jason, and some other people decided to hit the X-Box with Gotham racing and NBA Street. Lol Two point games with 12 second shot clock in NBA street were hilarious. In the end I think JT and Brian killed me and Jason but we pulled off some pretty sweet stuff still lol. Ali had to leave early though.....but we all still managed to sign her journal and JT's before the day was at end. Kinda cool though with the whole journal thing....I want one now lol. Hmm for now though.....we chilled....then headed out around 10pm or so....and this was basically where my day ended.   Hmm.......so guess now I'll be headin' to bed. Church tomorrow plus some badminton practice. Also gotta find my band uniform at Bud Gowan's tomorrow for Kiwanis on Tuesday. So hehe....until tomorrow's entry. Later people =).

       4/23/04   And the world revolves normally again *for me*   Hmm.....sometimes life  can seem to be turned upside down. When I say this I don't mean like "OH NO EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" I mean it more of a "FINALLY LIFE'S BACK TO ITS AVERAGE SELF." Usually I don't like normality of my days....but after this hectic week....normality can seem to be such a precious commodity. With 4 days of Kiwanis, badminton, catching up on history+civics, and a whole potpourri of other things....hehe yeah these last few days have been a blast though. So sometimes being out of the ordinary can really whoop ass. Who cares if Kiwanis turned out pretty crummy this year....this week also brought many other things into my life for me to see. I got to see disabilities of humans can never get in the way of achieveysments, see melf do decent in Kiwanis if not the school, Stage Band X beat out a senior jazz group, and of course.....SEE KILL BILL VOL. 1, which I'll elaborate on later. And also....seeing God's guidance and wisdom really fall on me as I could have never gone through this week with the ease and calmness that he provided. So props to him =).  Like I said....life is getting back to its normal route....which actually as I'm writing this entry now I'm starting to not like. This week has been fun *not just because I missed lots of school* but also because I got to see so many new things.....like me actually doing decent at Kiwanis, and learning that reading can actually be amusing at times. Too much to explain....as I will do throughout this blog...  SO CONTINUING FROM "Like I said..."  Senior Band this morning. Hehehe we play next week.....so yeah Kiwanis isn't over this year until near the very end for me. Like any other Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday I woke up at 630am, trudged out of bed, and slowly made my way downstairs for breakfast. Also like any other morning, I did my morning routine, got packed up and headed out the door, eyes still drooping and everything still seeming like a blur to me at 645am. Nothing too out of the ordinary for my mornings.....radio was talking about hockey games from last night....Leafs lost, Detroit lost *surprisingly* and Colorado lost   Band this morning: I'm actually starting to sound somewhat decent. Though there still are some parts I don't get in Vesuvius and Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, but I'll figure that out in time =P. One thing though I'm happy for is the fact that Mrs. Wharton actually gave me opportunity to play in this band....SOOO MUCH MORE FUN than Intermediate band. Same as Stage Band X.....much more jokes and fun. Also it keeps me occupied.....so I don't start to do stupid things at home....like say drink up half a bottle of wine while on MSN like I did a while back....yeah that's about the extent of "Joe's No Life" goes: Being a poser of an alcoholic =P. After band had to make an appointment to get my uniform for Senior Band.....and then I headed to my first class of history this week.  WHOO! Didn't miss jack....who cares if I did anyways....WWII is a joke...kinda studied it back in grade 6 on my own time, plus Paul and Patrick's MOHAA addiction helped too. Hearing about it everyday between gr. 7-8 and also watching Band of Brothers helps you learn much about WWII. Apparently last 3 days they've been watching Schindler's List....a war movie made by Spielberg. Pretty good movie seeing the fact I only saw about 70 minutes of it so far....and the movies almost 3 hours. But it's not bad....I actually liked the part I watched....er saw. And we still aren't done.....more still for next Tuesday...though I'll miss it because of Badminton Conference....=). Hmm....downside of normal average day 1: double period in same room w/ same teacher. Ugh. Civics class is a drag....  Civics today: caught up on stuff I missed....which was about voting....and today we learned about elections. Pretty straightforward.....and I still think Civics is a waste of time. But we do get to go on a field trip =). Social Justice Conference.....something I was maybe planning to go to I'm now forced to go to. Basically it's a conference where you get to attend lectures about issues of today. *Shrug* I guess can't be that bad. I heard actually from people who went last year it's pretty fun. Something to look forward to I guess hehe. Other than that......Yup......watched a REALLY lame video and took more notes. I'm running out of paper and plus I think I'm gonna get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome from all this note-taking =S.  Lunchtime: went to go try on band uniform then head out for lunch.....OH CRAP BADMINTON MEETING! So I quickly rush upstairs....but it was over. Turns out she just needed to know the conflicts that badminton conference will have. For me: virtually none =P. So getting that by, me Nate and Mike ended up going to Stobie's today; a place I haven't been to since last November.....don't remember why...thought it was expensive back then. But seeing my spending habits now...it's a bargain for the quality food I get there. Their pizza's back up in tip top shape compared to before. Might go there more often now =P. Oh yeah Starbucks opened too today according to Natalie....wanna go there and give it a try. Mmmm......Frapuchinos ^_^.  Math: I did math. Nothing out of the ordinary. Trigonometry is a joke =P.  And Programming: I'm definitely not taking it next year.....as it is such a lame course. Comps suck...I hate Turing....and our class is sometimes so friggin' retarded you can't get any work done anyways. I'm not trying  to sound like a geek....but I can't even surf the internet at times with so much crap going on in the class. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SURF BLOGS WITH THE CRAP THAT GOES ON, but it is a funny class though. Kinda good that it's sometimes a last class waker-upper for me with all the stuff that goes on...most of it being funny. Apparently when I thought I woke up early this morning....Mitch literally killed me at that event. He woke up at 430am for rowing. That's one reason why I like badminton: such a lazy sport =).  HOME TIME! Except today went to UCC for badminton. So decided to take long way there instead of waiting for Dundas bus *patience right there* and took Cherryhill w/ Dan and Elaina, then transfered onto Wonderland. Got to UCC around.....330ish?  Badminton today was decent I guess. Didn't really see anyone I knew....so played a few pickup games with some random people. First game I did horrible.....and wasn't into the flow of things....but by 2nd and 3rd game I managed to get my serve up and actually tied from 14-8. In the end though we lost.....I hate tiebreaking games. Heh saw Steve Zhao from the team come today too. Managed to play a singles game with him. Although I lost, but I made some would-have-been decent doubles shots. Final score: 15-12 or something like that. We whooped some UWO ass though when we played doubles. Killed other team 15-5 or something like that. Yeah doubles is definitely my kind of game: run less.....more action hahaha. Unlike singles....ugh all the running.....defeats the purpose of badminton being my "lazy" sport. In the end though chatted w/ Marcello who came for ball, and saw Dan and Adam there also. Well I headed out early though, leaving around 6pm....got a lift from mom back home then....and proceeded with the rest of my day =).  Got home....quickly downed some food....and then.....WATCH KILL BILL VOL. 1!  Now I won't ruin much about the movie....but some parts are hilarious even though it is an action movie. Also....anime part in the movie is crazy. If GOOD anime is like that, yeah I gotta pick up a few anime DVD's. Also just the beginning starting like an old Chinese Kung-Fu flick....really funny but cool. Quentin Tarantino I can see now why he is such a famous director. His movie was ingenious.....with bits and pieces of everything....plus a KILLER soundtrack. Anyone know where I can get my hands on a copy of it? If it's even on sale. MUST....GET.....SOUNDTRACK. Was so good....some of the songs werer crazy.  The whole movie actually.....was crazy. Best movie I've seen this year I think...now I wanna see Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs lol.  For now though....I'm out for this blog entry. Still talkin' on MSN, wasting my time, and I gotta eat dinner still. Wow it's 11:30 already. Blast Habs lost to Tampa 4-0....but I heard from Jason Yao and the Rockets are killin' Lakers right now. Hehe at least something's going right today in the sports world =).  Later dudes and dudettes =).

       4/22/04   Kiwanis: Why is it so weird this year?   Out of all the years of my life competing in this music festival held every spring in London....this year has got to be the worst/weirdest one ever. First off....on Wednesday when some girl should have got disqualified for not following song regulations.....she got 2nd....pushing me back to 3rd.....and today.......9 OUT OF 9 POSSIBLE AWARDS FOR SCHOOLS WERE ALL SILVERS! I mean.....honestly I wouldn't care if someone got bronze. In fact....no one did, nor merit, nor gold. All "shiny" silvers. As quoted from Shaunvir:  "Why are they so communist this year?! Everyone's equal. I mean WTH!?"  Unfortunately I have to agree with him on this. This year's Kiwanis wasn't that great. No winners. No losers. Just a bunch of average Joes getting silver. Whoo. So after we also heard Banting got the trophy for a song we played in grade 9 *yes they played a piece that we memorized and got gold on last year....last year being when I was 14* and somehow they beat us out. Hmm........GAY! They played a EASY piece, a piece that we learned last year and managed to beat us out. Yeah pretty b/s I know.....but enough ranting about how crappy our Kiwanis went....onto the happier parts of my day....like missing out half of english class.....or struggling on a bio test=P.  So my day today started @ 7:30....jumping out of bed, eating breakfast, rushing upstairs, doing morning routine and then grabbing my stuff and heading out the door. Yup....like usual I gave Patrick a lift to school and we just got there on time =P. Hmm for once I actually had to use my locker for Kiwanis stuff, badminton stuff, and a whole potpurri of other junk. First time in my whole high school life where my locker actually looked full. Wow. What an amazing feat huh =P. So first up on the list today: Music class.  Yup....final runthrough before we enter the Kiwanis....shining with our many instruments (over 40 flutes, something like 40 clarinets, heckload of brass and some saxophones, plus the percussio n' stuff) so we merged the two music homeroom classes together and had a full run-through rehearsal. We sounded pretty good I thought.....though there were some rushing issues with trumpets. Nothing new. Mr. Clark then gave us a pep talk for Kiwanis......you know about how we are a good band, and how we are still a good band even if we don't win anything. Meh....we actually do sound good.....and even Lina thought we whooped ass. Plus Oakridge and Westminister REALLY sucked beyond the boundary lines. It's like if it was a hockey game.....and the team sucks so bad that they would lose more often with the goalie in the net than if they didn't even have a goalie. But somehow they managed a Silver still.....which was ridiculous. EVERYONE thought they shoulda got something like a Merit....or whatever's below it *coupons to Wal-Mart?* Oh yeah....also a gr. 11 student came in to play for us....run through before real thing hehe=P.  After music class.......well headed to usual science. We have to make food chains for next day that somehow relate to us (we eat beef, beef comes from cows, cows eat grass). Yeah boring huh? Yes very.  For lunch......Jasper's today and did some quick studying for my Bio test...which I thought would be a quiz. Turns out it's one HUGE test. Well had a chicken quesadilla today from that place......WOW WAS IT GOOD. KILLS ANY OF WILLIAM'S FOOD. Mmmmm...........chicken. So quickly studied for bio while munching on my quesadilla and also had my daily cup of java.....mmm........java. I'd have to cups today so yeah I'm still a bit wired =P.  Bio class: Joe failed/chinese failed/probably usual failed the test I think. I forgot what a spleen was. OUch. Yup.....it was pretty bad. Walked in thinking it's a 20 minute test and lo and behold......WOW A 75 MINUTE FULL TEST. *Uh oh says Joe to himself.* Well I still did it obviously......but checked it over I think 10 times....hopefully it does something. Prayers have helped me much in this course....and I hope it comes through again. Won't complain if it doesn't though......since I barely studied. Thought that reading random blogs was more important the night before =P.  So after that.....ENGLISH CLASS. Read some new book I got on my own....called "Rain Fall." It's pretty cool so far. A guy kills another guy with a pacemacker jammer making it look like the guy's pacemacker failed. I thought it was pretty interesting. So yeah I finally found a book worth wasting my time on =P. I guess reading isn't that bad after all. Thing with me: if I find a book I like.....I'll sit in front of it for 3 hours straight reading it whole. If I don't like it.......I'll read 40 pages in 4 months. If it's an average book........same result. I only read books I REALLY enjoy. Everything else basically goes in a pile for burning =P. Oh yeah English exam postponed because of Badminton and other various activities =P. Shweet....now the exam's on the week that WOSAA's on. I hope that I make it to WOSAA so I can avoid the May 4th one *waste of time....that's why.* COME ON GUYS DOUBLES! LET'S WHOOP SOME ASS =P.  So since class was cut short.....we headed out for Kiwanis then. Funny thing happened though today while packing for Kiwanis...  I was heading into the music room for my trombone.....when someone told me a Helen Neil was looking for me or something. Apparently she wants me to help her with her piano. ME?! Hmm.....yeah like I said I was surprised too. Kinda cool though that someone's actually heard of my piano playing. Interesting too I guess....how it's in my school. I think Mrs. Mitsis told her to find me....it's about a piece that I'm good at. Meh w/e.....never found her since I had to leave for Kiwanis. So yeah....talked to Arjun on the way there. He had Kiwanis again today. Apparently this time he got 2nd....which is an improvement from well....nothing =P lol. Yesterday he kinda forgot half his piece....and today he bounced bac for a silver. Great recovery. And for some reason Fred and Christian were talking about......STAR TREK!? Uhh.....I thought that craze was over um.......20 years ago? lol. So talked to some other people on the bus.....and looked around the Kiwanis program for events that people I know are playing at. Didn't really see much except for some younger kids that go to my church. Two of them apparently have a duet, which I think is pretty cool.  So when we arrive at Saunders....kinda funny how first 3 people I see are Anton, Jonny and Tyler. They were waiting for parents, so chatted with them for a bit. First thing Anton brings up was that prank phone call they made about 2 months ago w/ an Arnold Schwarzenneger voice....and yeah it was pretty lame lol. Talked a bunch of other stuff too.....apparently he knows a few people in our band. Not surprising seeing there's almost 110 of us in band. He's gotta know SOMEONE. Especially also since 60% of Central students are in the music program. He's gotta know SOMEONE. Lol him and Tyler look almost the same though....except for the fact of course Anton's uglier *BURN!* And plus he's also a bit more retarded lol. Arnold prank calls? I have call display too. I remember Paul did that w/ Patrick I think back in grade 6, which is Anton's Maturity level now =P.  So like I said before: Kiwanis wasn't that great.....I mean 5-way tie out of 5 schools then a 4-way tie out of 4 schools. In the first class we played "Concorde Sketches," which I thought we did ok. But that wasn't the main thing I was amazed at.....I saw a gift from God today that was blessed upon the snare drummer for Lucas....  Well at first I didn't notice it.....but when Lucas went up to play their piece....something in the back caught my eye. The snare drummer....his arms weren't exactly well.....normal. Thing is.......he can play the snare better than the drummers in my school. John was astonished when he saw the talent that the dude had in him. It was pretty cool though.......his snare playing was so technical....it was GOOD. I was amazed to see that even with disabilities....it does prove true that God can still shower blessings on you. I witnessed that today. I also saw that in one of Lucas' trumpet players, who is a parapalegic, yet he plays the trumpet like any other trumpet player. It's actually really cool to see. That was one thing this Kiwanis that was shining on the positive side. I mean....I really I guess don't care AS much about winning now, and also just seeing that....I was astonished at the fact that Lucas had such talented individuals who may have disabilities, but those two literally own some of our musicians in my group. True blessing from Christ =).  Then after Lucas played, watched the other schools still. They mostly sucked. Banting did decent, but like I mentioned before played a song Central 9ers learn, and still manage a gold. Banting managed a silver. Oakridge sucked, and Strathroy wasn't that good either. We did decent, though we could have done better I think.  After that class.....DINNER! Went to buy pizza....and my 2nd cup of java for the day. Got a "roll up the rim to win" cup.....but lost. Grr.....stupid Timmy's not letting me win. You win probably once every......30 times I heard? Unless you're one of those really lucky people.....gah which I'm not. Oh yeah! GREAT FEAT TODAY PERFORMED BY JOE!  YES I NOW OFFICIALLY OWN KILL BILL VOLUME 1!  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! Now I can watch that.....and then watch Vol. 2, AND STILL HAVE VOL. 1! NO WAY! Yes way =P. After accomplishing that task, I then headed back to school with Pourier talking about how we shoulda got a gold....or someone should have if not us *so bland when everyone gets silver* and headed back to Saunders.  For our 2nd class.....everyone played "When Summer Takes Flight." Really retarded song in my opinion....BUT EVERYONE STILL GOT SILVERS! WESTMINISTER LIKE I SAID SUCKED....AND THEY MANAGED TO STILL GET A SILVER! BAH! Banting and Central should have got Golds....but NOOOOOO..........it seems as though Communism has swept the Kiwanis Nation into a equality world.......so therefore EVERYONE got silver. By the time that was over......  Central had to stay for one last class. The march class. We played the Gambolier song....and it sounded good, but apparently you don't win anything in that one. So all that effort...plus constructive criticism for nothing. So then a frustrated group of ninety some odd Centrallers packed their gear....then headed home.  So yup....here I am blogging about my day....complaining about the corruption of Kiwanis, and the fact that I flunked a bio test. All in all......not that bad of a day. On the bright side got to miss some school, see some friends at Kiwanis and play t-bone. Also I got to find a book I'm actually interested in =P.  Now I go watch some Avalanche game....and then head to sleep. Got Senior band tomorrow. We play on Tuesday....hmm somehow gotta make it after conference lol.  Later.

       4/21/04   Personal Kiwanis Achievements: 2nd and 3rd =)   Hmm.....well turns out after entering two events during this year's Kiwanis....I came out from both with an award. Though there were no first places, I don't really mind. I've been there, done that, so I'm not complaining *last year I got first on sometin.* So this year I'm pretty happy with my results, seeing that I barely practiced 30 minutes a day....SHWEET!=). My day's been pretty short, as my usual 6am wake-up call was shut off by me as I really don't wanna go to band when I got Kiwanis. I'd be dead tired by the time performance came. Also coming home and taking a nice one hour nap.....yeah my Wednesday has been lazy, short, and sweet =).  Well like I mentioned already....the thought of going to band and attending history class completely blanked out of my mind. Even though my Kiwanis event wasn't until 10am.....WHO CARES?! I like to sleep....and have enough energy to actually hit the keys on the piano so no wakey wakey until 9am today. MUAHAHAHAHAHA! I was planning to practice a bit before performance time came...but sleep took over.....and I then just woke up, ate somethin' quickly, did usual routine and played my piece only twice. Then headed out the door for my Kiwanis event.  Yup......and back to the same church I was at last day for Kiwanis. Up against some familiar faces, one being Arjun and the other being some girl.....Keila I think was her name. And this time my "YES NO ASIANS OTHER THAN ME" luck took a turn when 3 Asians strutted in with their piano books and their piercing piano looks. "Oh no I'm screwed" our protagonist Joe thinks to himself. Will he be able to pull a 2nd or 3rd or 1st? Find out.....when you scroll down to the next paragraph!  Dun Dun Dun.........  Location: DaySpring Presbyterian Church: London, Ontario Time:10:15am (a bit over since the class started late) Kiwanis Class #: 3104 Joe is: Competitor #1 Song he plays: Some old Sonatina by Friedrich Kuhlau How does he do: He places 3rd out of.....9?  ......something like that at least. So yeah I didn't do too bad. I was first again....in order of playing...and for some reason......I was REALLY nervous. My hands were shaking as though 3 cups of coffee was going through my system, and my leg was having very weird muscle spasms. So after the competition officially went underway.....I walked up to the piano. I then announced my piece. And then the playing of the wooden box with 88 keys (52 white keys and 36 black keys, which then equals 88) put into it with lots of wiring and felt hammers. Ugh did horrible.....blips here and there....and lots of crappy mistakes. I was actually very surprised that I managed to still clinch 3rd. I beat out two of the 3 other Asians, with the other one clinching 2nd. So all in all I wasn't really complaining. Arjun woulda done really well I thought....except he kinda forgot a bit of his piece. Don't blame him though......apparently was his first time in Kiwanis. He didn't do that bad of a job either. Sounded really good. The first place person though did really good. Me and Arjun think the 2nd place shmuckette shoulda been disqualified though, since she played a piece that wasn't even supposed to be allowed in the program. Phht..........what a fluke. If she was disqualified I WOULDA GOT 2ND! TWO 2ND PLACES IS GOOD! BUT NOOOOO.........STUPID ADJUDICATOR DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DISQUALIFY! GRRRRRR! AND SOME OTHER PERSON WOULD HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEDGE OF GETTING 3RD!...BOOOOO! Oh well.....it's over and done with now. I got 3rd....I'm not really complaining *cough GAYNESS x7* and I'm still smiling *grr.....woulda got 2nd=@!*  So afterwards....wow it's already 12pm. I'm late for math. Oh well....I'll still head to McDonalds for a lunch and then head to school. NOTHING gets in the way between me and lunch....except if I don't feel like it =P. So headed to lunch, ordered, and then drove to school while munching on my McChicken and Fries. Oh yeah and of course a cup of coffee. Mmm....coffee ^_^.  And I regret going to school.......math class consisted of approx. 10 people. Half the class was at Kiwanis, and the other half at Fiddler on the Roof. So chatted with John, Travis, and Nick for most of the class, since I got all my homework done over the period. Trig actually isn't as hassling as I thought it'd be. Calculators make life very easy =). Kinda funny how people used to have tomes and volumes of books telling them every TAN, COS, and SIN calculation for every angle. Hahahahahaha and to think all I have to do is press 3 buttons now =P.  Programming: won't elaborate much. Boring.....Mr. Dayus is gonna probably kill us one of these days, and it was boring like usual.  Badminton today: Hmm........I don't seem to understand why I seemed to like mixed doubles in grade 9. OMG IT'S SO BORING! I had to play a practice match today w/ John and two girls because Ms. Bates made us....and it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TIME WASTING. Slow moving, and everything. I don't see how Josh seems to like playing mixed....but guys doubles is much more fun and action-packed. People actually HIT the bird. Maybe it's just because our mixed doubles is all the rejected people.......so me and John are back on the doubles team. Thank goodness lol. I couldn't survive playing mixed. Such a lame game. Hmm......crap it's raining outside. Rugby, Track and Soccer came in soaked.....so this can't be a good sign for me lol. Dave got a new raquet, hmm.....and we did some drills. My dropshot's getting crappier *shudder* but my smashing has improved altely =).  Hmm.....bused home w/ John....then walked in the pouring rain back home. Quickly ran upstairs and took a 1 and a half hour nap. I used to wonder why people nap....I realize why now. With a life like a high schooler...I'm not surprised. Everyday, about 6-7 hours of sleep, and so much happens in high school at times. Yeah I can see why now people like naps. I'm becoming a napper myself now =P. And so much can happen in your sleep too. Dreams are still something that I'm always fascinated with.  *1.5 hours later*  Quickly did theory.......and then headed to theory class, where I did more theory. I'm done 5 PAPERS ALMOST NOW! WHOA! And so far my average is 79.5. Not bad considering I'm barely getting some of the things. Oh well....s'all good I'll cram the night before =P..  Yeah anyways I'm out for the night. These last few days have been pretty fun though, with Kiwanis and everything. Sleepin' now though hehe. And in the quotes of Ada:  "I bid the farewell."  Hey it is pretty catchy=P.

       4/20/04   1/3 of my teams made it in.....GRRR!   Well after watching the Sens being humiliated in their final game 7, and the 3rd or 4th year losing to the leafs, yeah I'm grateful at least my favourite team.....the Avalanche made it in. If it weren't for them.....hmm I'd be stuck watching the Flames, Leafs, and Flyers. Eew. And then I'd end up cheering for.....the Sharks? Or even....THE HABS?! Oi.....yeah playoffs took a much different turn from last year. All the usual teams made it in, and the usual teams got past round 1, unlike last year which seemed to be the Underdog's heyday. Well.....now back to followin' the Avs after their long break from defeatin' the Stars. First game:  Thursday, April 22nd, Colorado @ San Jose @ 10pm.  Can't wait 'till then....last time they played the Sharks they beat 'em....and I intend the same to happen this year ^_^. Pretty good series though I'll bet.....Sharks have become quite the team over last 4-5 years. Hmm....Toronto plays Philly,  Montreal Vs. Tampa and Calgary will be taking.....Detroit. Good series matchups....though half the teams I wanted in never got in. Well Ottawa I wanted to win just to piss off the many Leafs fans in my area, but Canucks and Devils not making it in I really didn't think was cool. So yup....most of my evening has been spent napping, and watching the Leafs and Sens game that ended with the Leafs humiliating the Senators 4-1. Whoo. Grr. Other than that...hmm well now I'm just waiting for the Colorado and Sharks to face-off on Thursday Night. GO AVS!  Hmm other than that my day's been really tiring....and boring for school. I got up at 630 this morning for Senior Band and got ther at usual time. Ran over couple of the songs.....and Mrs. Wharton commended Stage Band X in Senior Band. We got Silver yesterday, and of course the Senior Jazz Band whooped ass. Can't wait to join that next year =P. After running through Senior Band, Wind Ensemble *senior one* stayed back for a quick run through. I also stayed back to work on much needed to be worked on theory. yup......MUCH NEEDED WORK.  Anywho after that: music class. Today we ran through all our Kiwanis pieces, and also some other drill stuff. Meh....usual stuff. Arjun and I are both going to be playing against each other tomorrow at Kiwanis. Hopefully I win. I doubt it though...he's pretty good at piano.....and I don't have my Sonatina that well conquered. Well hope for the best...the best being not Joe Failing. Chinese failing is still lingering on the horizon.  After music class.....which proved that Saxophones may need some practice on their instruments came the trudge up the stairs to Science Class.....where I fell asleep for half of it. Nothing too out of the ordinary. Me sleeping, Mr. Curphey lecturing, taking down worthless notes I will probably never use since I find Ecology a waste of time. WHOA LOOK THE FISH EATS THE PLANT, THEN GETS EATEN BY A BIGGER FISH, WHO GETS EATEN BY A SHARK, WHICH GETS EATEN BY MAN, WHICH GETS EATEN BY A CAMEL! O M G! FOODCHAIN REACTION! THE WORLD'S FALLING APART! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *wump.*  Lunch: Went to Subway...........overpriced to the max. spent $8.25 on some stupid sub and a can of Pepsi. Why didn't I go with Heather and Nate to McD's I don't know....IT WAS BIG MAC DAY TOO *shakes fist.* AND HEATHER EVEN GOT THIS REALLY WEIRD TOY.....THAT DID SOME REALLY WEIRD THING. AND ALL I GOT WAS A SANDWICH AND A ALUMINUM CAN OF CARBONATED SUGAR WATER. BLAST!  Bio class: worked on our  Digestive system theme park. Yeah......that is classified. For now.  And English. We have been informed we have another exam. HUH!??@?@??!?!?!? Yes sadly the english department makes two exams a year, which is a total waste of time as english is an ART....not a uh.....whatever the opposite of art is. Rhythmic dictation course? Hmm......oh yeah and today Robert showed the full might of his stupidity:  Katherine: Hey Robert.....did you know gullable isn't in the dictionary? Robert: Huh? Uhh........sure? Katherine: Do you know what I'm saying? Robert: I think so......Gullable's not in the dictionary? Katherine: Yes.....do you know that? Robert: Yes....NO WAIT what's gullable mean?  *Robert then realizes how stupid he is.* So after that......we got into groups and did these question things about Fried Green Tomatoes. Boring book......and very weird. Now apparently one's a bisexual while the other is a lesbian who loves to play poker and bring elephants into town. Interesting.  No badminton.....so went home. Talked to Adam on the bus, got things organized for Bio project...and then home.  Sc, Drumming......then Game 7.......which I now really think wasn't worth an hour of me watching. Meh oh well.....at least Thursday the Avs are back in the game. Finally I can watch a good team play. Ergh....but why did the Canucks lose. They even sent the game into OT and managed to lose......BAH.  Anyways.....goin' to sleep soon. Didn't do any work whatsoever tonight....and I'm going to Kiwanis tomorrow. No hockey games tomorrow...but instead badminton and piano theory. Oh boy Mrs. Mitsis is going to kill me when she finds out I'm barely done half the papers.  Anyways.....yeah I'm probably going to be cramming for most of tomorrow for this stuff, plus a biology test on the digestive system.  So I'm out for the night. Later.

       4/19/04   YAY! FIRST DAY OF KIWANIS!2ND PLACE!   Every year around this time......I'm always grateful I play the piano lol. Though it can be hard work at times, get in the way of things, and seem like it's a horrid instrument.....but I really don't mind it. In fact, its led me to playing the drums and trombone also....and soon the guitar I'm hoping =). Yeah I guess I'm a pretty curious person with things.....and after I learn one thing I wanna jump on for the next. Music seems to come pretty easy especially though. So not much school today...mostly consisted of playing piano, trombone, and then going home for naps =). So yeah.......pretty easy day for me......ergh Thursday's gonna be hell though intermediate band from 3-9 lol. Hope we win something.  So today instead of school I awoke at 8:15 to get ready for Kiwanis this morning. Walked downstairs to the aroma of French Toast *mmmmm* and quickly downed it, since it was good lol. So then quickly ran through my songs, said a quick word of prayer and then headed out the door to DaySpring where I was to play my Kiwanis piece.  So got there around 8:50 or so then......and one of my wishes came true...  YES I'M THE ONLY ASIAN THERE! NO FOBS OR OTHER ORIENTAL MUSIC FREAKS THAT PRACTICE 7-10 HOURS A DAY TO COMPETE WITH MY MINISCULE ASIANALITY MUSICA SKILLS! Not saying white people suck or anything.....but honestly I really don't like playing against those music-geeky Asians that seem to think Mozart is still Metallica and Beethoven is 50 Cent. They're all dead, and their corpses are probably gone....GET IN THE TIMES YOU OUTDATED SHMUCKS! Well there were 7 of us including me today playing against one another, and lucky me...I'm first on the list. So....you know did the usual announcing my piece, then started playing.....YES I REMEMBER HOW TO PLAY IT and surprisingly after the results came in......I GOT SECOND, ONLY TO BE DEFEATED BY SOME PREPPY WHITE GUY THAT CAME IN FIRST! NOT BAD AT ALL.......DIDN'T CHINESE FAIL....well by my standards at least......ok I didn't Joe Fail......I probably Chinese Failed....seeing I got 2nd.  So after my class at Kiwanis, where I reign semi-victorious......well victorious over 5/7 people I stop by Subway to buy my lunch then head home to pack my things for school......still having a seem-to-be dimpled smile on my face from winning 2nd. So I head home then, and quickly eat. Hmm no one on MSN at 11:30 *wonder why...OH YEAH SCHOOL....hehe forgot=P*  So now heading to school....yay math class. Why couldn't I have more Kiwanis classes? Grr.....so boring. I hate trigonometry. It's lame....VERY lame. So sat trhough 70 minutes *seemed like ages* and then headed out for programming.  Programming.....a clock fell on Cam, Icy got the blame, in the end no one got the blame. So we then worked on Turing, I for one got pretty bored and started surfing the net. Was pretty much done anyways. So after that long grueling class......of constant tacking of compy keys and *woam woam* of monitors.....SCHOOL'S OVER........well the government-required part. Final run through for Stage Band X as tonight we perform.  So after practice.....bused home in REALLY heavy winds. Finally got home.....and WUMP! YAY NAPPY TIME! I have no idea why, but today I've been pretty dead tired, despite sleeping in and everything. Pretty weird.....but point is.....from 4:30-6 I napped. Didn't intend to sleep so much, so quickly jumped out of bed then ate a quick light dinner then headed out the door to Saunders for Stage Band X's premier performance for 2003-2004.  WHY MUST WE BE #1?! Ergh first competitor in both events today lol. Originally we were 2nd or third but we had to bump ourselves up as someone had to leave early. Wasn't too bad though....we got to have a quick run through of piece being up there. While we were in Saunders room though warming up...lol Fred drew a pretty funny statement:  y=ex  BUT:  y1=ex IS THE SAME THING! ISN'T THAT WHACK!?  HA take that Saunders kids. Plus........apparently THERE IS SOMETHING LOWER THAN APPLIED MATH! It leads to really retarded math through the future....but I was surprised there was something lower than applied lol. Band went through a quick runthrough....then GAME TIME! Er performance time.  *1 hour and 30 minutes later*  Listened to other groups play.....one group someone looked like Mike......another group was a hick group of pure guys and no girls basically *except two* and then the group w/ a choir.....which got Bronze. Pretty unique though. We got tied for Silver with other two groups. Not bad......though we didn't win trophy =(. Oh well.....least we beat someone, we were entered in a senior group so I'm happy w/ our results lol.  Now I'm back home. So today wasn't very long...as half of it was cut short from sleep and Kiwanis. Pretty fun though......after finally getting back into Kiwanis after a year......brings back many memories. And reminds me how easy it can be to play your music in front of people which I think is a pretty cool gift. I rarely get nervous, and I always wing things lol. S'all good though......and it came through in the end with a healthy 88 and second place plus a Silver award that is shared evenly among all the Stage Band X members. Good Job dudes and dudettes!  Anyways I'm out for the night. Still got Senior Band tomorrow hehe.  Cya.

       4/18/04   Happy Birhtday Icy! And of course the rest of my day =P   "HAPPY BIRTHDAY ICY!"  Now that I've gone on with that, it's time to go on about.....well.....the rest of my day =P. Well today was like usual Sunday I guess.....except for the fact that Lina started comin' to church now....plus today we took the van. WHOA OUT OF NORMALITY THERE OH NO! *gasp.*  Today originally started off looking gloomy. Up until now I still don't get what's with me and thinkin' rainy days are gloomy....well it's not just me it's with many people. So I woke up pretty slowly, got downstairs had a quick breakfast and then got ready for church.....slowly. Gloomy days bring slow production. So left around 845.....then drove down to Lina's then Jason's....and then to church.  Btw........LEAFS JUST LOST AND SENS TOOK SERIES TO GAME 7! EXCITEMENT! Now I don't really care for either team, just that I'd rather see Sens in the playoffs this year going further than the Leafs.....deep inside.....GO COLORADO! WHOOOOO!  Yeah game just ended and I'm typin this blog at 10:45 so *shrug.* Thought I'd add that in...but back to my day.  Got to church around 9:10......just on time hehe. Jason and I did ushering for today. Hmm.....2nd last day for the few who are graduating. So we did usual ushering, and then headed in for Praise and Worship section of the service.  Today Pastor Mackness was speaking a lot about contentment, and how Christ gives us the strength to do everything, as it  says in Phillipians 4:13:  "I can do everything through him who gives me strength. "  Service was somewhat a slow moving one.....yet a blur at the same time. It's hard to describe.....but it was pretty cool lol. I felt as though it was speeding by....but then when I looked at the clock...."Why....it's only 10:10." It was cool though.......liked the message today. Good reminder that no human or Satanic force can stop you, when you have Jesus Christ backing you up =). It was also cool to see that by the time sermon was over.....the storm was over.....and the sun seemed to shine outside then. Wow. Cool hehe.  So after service, we headed downstairs and just chilled for a bit. Some signed the journals that Connie and Mike are going to be getting, and the others would do that later. So we all just chiilled downstairs for a bit. Lots of talk about the Rockets vs. Lakers game last night and the Flames Vs. Canucks triple overtime. Wow......Canucks won too ^_^. Apparently me, Lina and Jason weren't the only people who stayed up lol. Lots of us did. Yeah lots of talk about that, and of course our usual fooling around "DBZ HAND CLAPPING!" right Gavin? lol. Plus some other things.  Hmm......well normally we give parting gifts to people when they leave *which we did,* but in return Ali being the cool counselor she is gave us all personalized bookmarks. Really cool thing to do I thought. For me....she wrote from James 1:19-20, which reads:  "My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires."  When I read that on the back of my bookmark today.....I immediately reflected to yesterday's praise night practice. I mean......up until now when I think about it we were all being complete jackasses  to one another, and that isn't cool in our eyes.......nor God's. I was happy though that we could all just sit down yesterday and pray. I mean two things I really love about being a Christian is evangelizing and the power of prayer. NOTHING can defeat the word of prayer in my mind. It was cool though how Ali picked a verse for each of us. I really liked mine..as at times I may get pissed off quickly......especially when things aren't going my way.  Oh yeah today another new kid came to church to. His name was Derek, and apparently goes to Saunders. Another SC player lol. Well didn't really get to talk a whole lot to him, but hope he comes around more often.....anyone's welcome in the house of God =P. Well he seemed to think it was alright at least. Too bad he couldn't stay for graduation lunch today.  Which is where I'm leading to now. Graduation lunch seemed like a communion lunch, except the graduates got to say a word or two about their times at LCAC. Ali's really was touching......as I actually never knew she was the only UWO student at LCAC at one point. And to think that now....there's 30-40 of them. Wow determination really does come through. Even I'd be saying Praise the Lord for her to be staying here....never giving up on the English Ministry. If she had left........I don't know where us teens would be or even our church. And apparently there are even some gr. 12 grads this year, which I actually never knew about lol. So we listened, talked, and made fun of Chris a lot today lol. After the lunch.....we cleaned up church a bit while waiting for mom......and then headed home. While cleaning though.......yeah we had good times. Me and Gavin had lightsaber wars *mature huh* w/ wooden sticks and recorded Gavin karate kicking a already broken cinderblock lol. Oh yeah........and Dan seems to really hate styrofoam. MUAHAHAHAHAHA something I can piss off the twins w/ when they piss me off =). The squeaking of styrofoam.  @ Home......what'd I do? Not much. Drummed mostly lol. No SC or anything...didn't do h/w...... procrastinated piano.....YUP usual afternooon. Was thinkin' bout playing ball but was gonna go play badminton w/ Lina around 5pm anyways so just stuck around at home. Yup.........sat on MSN for a bit though. Ergh Missin Game 6 of Sens and Leafs for Badminton. Oh well.....that's what Sportscentre is for lol =P.  So from 5-9.........played baddy at UCC w/ Lina. Hehe talked to JT there too....studyin' for exams *sucker* and also met a dude from Gym Night. Sam, who was in my group for some of the games. Hehe was pretty cool, and I'm slowly building up my badminton friendship hierachy. I'm actually getting BETTER and stuff.....so yeah I can actually sometimes compete against some university students lol. My smash receiving is pretty much the best @ church at the moment, plus out of the people I know. So played a few games.....and saw another dude from Central team there Steve Zhao. He plays mixed I think....was gonna go for singles but Hermannator, Brandon and Hoffman wasted him. So he's playin' either mixed or guys doubles now. Well so basically baddy from 5-9......chatted a bit too.....Yang also came for a bit too but left early to study for bio. Hmm.....so after 9 yeah me and Lina left for home. I needed to do math h/w n' stuff......so gotta get home hehe.  So yeah at home now....took Lina back to her place and now I'm back home, watched the Leafs lose, did some math, and blogging. Plus talkin' to Jenn, Lina, Dan, Carmen and some other people on MSN. Hmm...sleepin' in tomorrow.....good old Kiwanis Festival: Joe's best friend to avoid History and Civics tomorrow =).  Well I'm out for the night....Lina needs to copy my blog for hers plus I'm done for the day hehe. Later.

       4/17/04   Praise Night: A learning experience never to be forgotten   The detail of my blogging for yesterday:   -Band -School -Home -Josh and Gavin came over and we settled everything in for tomorrow   and to today's blog.   Not your average Saturday...er not my average Saturday hehe. Wasn't a bad thing....in fact it was good experience to learn how to do a praise night and how to improve it. Next year though I'm really hoping more people will show up.....as it is a noutreach night also for non-Christians. Overall though it was alright I guess......learned a few new things and also figured out that planning means more than two days. But me being the optimistic one....EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE.=P.  So my day started around 1030 this morning......got up, ate, then quickly headed out to church for rehearsal for Praise Night. Wasn't best rehearsal in the world.......for many reasons. One being.......WHY CAN'T OUR CHURCH HAVE DSL INTERNET?! So when I found out that my compy presentation was a Openoffice file......and our church takes four hours to download it.....I had to call dad, and send myself home, save it as a powerpoint *shudder* and then drive back to church, which killed an hour. Another bad thing was Carmen took 2 hours to get there. Well at least we got rehearsing done....and actually we even got to jam around for a bit =P. Had some fun times there......inside jokes n' stuff, pretty funny and good times. Tried choking Gavin w/ Josh's broken bass string *ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 1 FAILED*  then Gavin tries to kill me with his guitar when we were jamming *the end of it was whacking my head.* Some random drum solos and bashing on guitar....bit of everythign I guess you can say =).  Amidst all this though..there were tensions built up. Not exactly best thing for 3 hours before praise night but it happened. I guess I sort of feel the same sometimes.....but it's for the church that we are doing this, and I sorta sometimes feel taht we shouldn't be bashing on other people when you volunteered to do this. I mean if they don't do their part, God will deal with it, not you. I mean I was somewhat frusturated running on overdrive at 2am last night trying to make everything right, and then in the afternoon today running home again to reformat it.....but that was my fault *though I wish our church would get high speed* and I was the one that volunteered for the responsibility. Josh was somewhat frusturated feeling like the only leader, and Carmen didn't seem to be havin' that cool of  day. Becca seemed to be neutral throughout the day and yeah Gavin was pretty frustruated as Josh was bein' a bit hard on him with some cheap shots of remarks and sarcasm. I'm happy though that when Kendrick came, we all just got to sit down and talk about it. Really felt good emptying all those canned in emotions. So we quickly said a word of prayer....then went upstairs to start praise night..the first official one done by only HYPE kids.  *Playing music, doing stuff related to praise night, I'm drumming =P*  And it's done after.......40 minutes? *uh oh off planned time by 2 hours 20 minutes.* Yes I now realize what Kendrick meant by sending out a schedule. Ow. lol. So what are we gonna do for 2 hours and 20 minutes. Well in the end the Praise team had quick meeting about what we could do to improve for next time. Lots of things said........and yeah this will help plan future things like say.......COFFEEHOUSE 2005! Which reminds me tomorrow I gotta print off a sheet of the minutes today or tomorrow. And after that......well.....some of the kids went home and the others went w/ JT, Brian, Kendrick and Felix *Brian's Friend* to Fast Eddie's for a quick meal of Grease platter and bubbly water with much sugar in it *aka burger n' fries and pop.*  I actually never been to Fast Eddie's before in my life....and I kinda regret it lol. It's actually pretty good place. Better than McDizzle's or BK at least. So many jokes made tonight though lol. Too many to explain. One being Gavin's "HEY MY CRAZY FRIES AREN'T CRAZY" and Kendrick replying "THEY LOOK QUITE SANE TO ME!" Fries with mental personalities........wow.....how do we come about with these things? Oh yeah and the documenting Lina's "Clarinet Practice." Yeah all this time she was out w/ us she was at a "Clarinet Practice" at a friend's. And she's on the other side of town with a bunch of weird dudes makin' up jokes about 'hoods *house ones not clothing* and distinguishing if a french fry is retarded. Oh yeah and Lina's name reminds me of my remark of how "HOT CHOCOLATE IS FOR WIMPS" lol. HYPE should have more of these "meetings" lol. Then we all left for home. Brian took me Lina and JT back along w/ Felix and Ken took Calvin, Twin #1, Gavin and Jason. So yeah that is where it leaves me at.......  HOME! So today had it's ups and downs. Learn something everyday though hehe. Satisfies my need for asking the question of "how does this thing work?" *KABOOM!* Well in the midst of the explosion you get something out of it.....in that very watered-down example from an explosion you learn not to tinker with a can of metal that looks like a bomb that says "NUCLEAR BOMB" beside it. Well today.....we may have not had an AMAZING praise night...but hey we now know how to make one more fun and.......better running? Like instead of singing through 16 songs in 40 minutes.....TAKE A BREAK. There's an idea for next time lol. Plus Meditation and Prayer....kinda forgot that. Oh well, nothing comes out perfect. I mean the first time you bake a chocolate cake will always be worse than your 10th, 15th, or 30th time. Experience is everything, and God will lead the way for us onto the path of success. It was cool though being able to lead the first Praise Night. Really hope rest of HYPE will be more involved next time though...  Anywho I'm out for the night. SO HAPPY AVS WON.......but kinda peeved that Nashville's out. Bummer, wanted them to get by the Wings. Well......now if I can I'll try to go watch Rockets-Lakers game. Later.

       4/15/04   Bouncin' back from laziness...   Great bloggin' yesterday eh? =P. Been a bit busy lately so hehe couldn't blog as much as I usually do yesterday. Today though......I'm back to usual self....you know....somewhat sleep deprived....living off carrots and Tea......reading Fried Green Tomatoes for english class.....YUP back to usual days. Not as lazy as usual.  Well this morning.....after staying up till 1230 last night watching Sportscentre and Avalanche winning *and Sens winning also.....NHL playoffs pretty intense this year* I woke up around 7:30 and started doing my morning routine. Yay it's a day 1. That means no science or bio =), but instead the long, boring torture of double period w/ Ms. Manson *History then Civics....uuugh.* Well actually don't mind history...but Civics is really a waste of money and  time. OOOH LOOK AT ME I KNOW HOW THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT WORKS! It's not like anybody even cares for Canadian elections...we've been gettin' less voters as years have gone by. Who cares? Didn't give Patrick a lift today since he said he didn't need one because he's leavin' later. Well in the end when I left....he left around same time. Pointless yes I know but meh....he started it. His dad explained later that he didn't eat until 745....HEY THAT'S MY USUAL EATING TIME =P.  Well headed to school then....and hopped out of the car....er minivan. Does that count as a car? Anyways quickly jammed useless junk into locker, and then headed to history. I'm almost late.....well I thought at least. Turns out I was just on time =P.  I'm not going to say much about history. We went to the computer lab and rotted there for 75 minutes, looking up stuff about the Holocaust. Yup.......that was basically it.  And after that boring class comes the icing topping for boredom.....CIVICS CLASS! We started off with our test on Canadian Politics and then went on from there. Why do my mornings suck so much? I don't know......but there has to be a reason. if PAS class is like this next year.....*ugh.* After that we took notes *how uncommon is that?* and did some survey telling us which party would be the most suitable for us to vote for. I'm a Liberal. Hmm always thought of myself as a PC dude *somewhat capitalist, figure that people shouldn't abuse welfare system, etc.* but after taking up our scores..I'm apparently Liberal. Hmm after doing that....took down MORE NOTES ON POLITICS. THE EVOLUTION OF OUR POLITICAL PARTIES. Yep.....every party.......EVERY political party started out either as a crazy dude expressin' his thoughts and people are appealed by it or out of the blue a group of people get peeved at an issue and then eventually somehow evolve into a party. WHY MUST CIVICS CLASS BE SO SUFFERING?  LUNCHTIME! Went to a place I haven't been to in........LOOOOONG TIME. William's=P. And I remember why. It's the same thing as Jasper's but more expensive. Jasper's has waaay more food too, plus they give discounts to Central Students^_^. But William's does have its good stuff.....flavoured cappuchinos, their breakfasts look better, etc. Mmmm.......breakfast platter. Ahhhhh........$6.35. MY MONEY! Lots of talk about last night's hockey, you know about the Leafs LOSING to the SENATORS and the Avalanche stealing a win from Dallas. Yes though I am an Avs fan I admit they did steal that win.......SOG was 41-23 or sometin and somehow Avalanche won lol *Avalanche was the 23.* Apparently lots of Central students still go to William's though....haven't been there in a while don't really remember hehe. Went back to school then and sat around in Gym for a bit. Played a wee bit of ball. Oh yeah then this happens:  Finlan tells me he's movin' to my area.  Whoo. Hoo. *Hint Hint SARCASM.* I don't exactly HATE HIM but he's a bit of a jackass. Jason and Alex and Hughes and probably Hammond gonna be bringin' out the champagne and booze when Gimpy moves out.  Math: Trigonometry. Not much more to say about that, except Jenn is suffering in Toronto w/ Quadratics while I'm FINALLY out of that pif of crappage and into easier stuff that I really don't like....TRIG! Learning about how to find sides of a triangle. I don't know why they have been emphasizing this since grade school. First comes Pythagorean Theorem, then some crap about Triangle theorems, and now THIS......TRIGONOMETRY! SHO STHUPAHD! And somewhat useless also...unless you're gonna be some engineer building stuff......er more of an architect.  Programming did absolutely nothing. Surfed net, struggled to figure out Turing like my usual self.  And finally hometime......YAY! No badminton practice today, except some of the team went to a quad meet at STA. Dangit I wanted to go....but NOOOOOO I've gone to one already. WHO CARES!? Wanted to go for mixed doubles but think Steve Zhao went instead. Finlan and Alex went for doubles....good luck dudes. STA I heard is a good team but hey Alex has got a pretty killer smash. Talked to Ryan on bus ride home. Apparently Ryan heard about Finlan moving around here too. Hahaha at least I'll be living more than 2 blocks away from him....Ryan's pretty much stuck on same street as him =P. Sucker.  Well....yeah that was pretty much my day....took a bit of a dip but s'all good......only once in a while stuff like this happens hehe. Well I'm out for the uh.....day? Sun's still up so yeah guess it'd be day hehe. Cya.

       4/13/04   Bargaining Band for Sleep: Effective =)   People complain about the flu bug...well I complain about post-holiday sleep syndrome. What is this disorder you ask? Take me for example. After a very relaxing easter weekend......all of a sudden I wake up at 6am the next morning? Uhh.....don't think so=P. So after some quick thinking and sudden descisions.....I concluded that I'd miss senior band today. Besides...she won't notice will she? *She did apparently....didn't think Mrs. Wharton would pay attention to a Gr. 10 that much.* So yup...that was my morning...slept intill 730.....I'm not about to wake up at 6am when I woke up at 11am yesterday.....BIIIG DIFFERENCE.  So waking up at 730.....I quickly got ready for school...you know usual morning routine and stuff. Breakfast consisted of leftovers from Wendy's house yesterday from dinner. Microwaved too. Ugh. So yeah not very appealing but meh....better than nothing. Wait.... is nothing on the menu?  So after getting a lift to school........I quickly jammed stuff I didn't need in my locker and headed upstairs to a re-welcoming history class. Not. Watched some boring movie about Hitler. And we started the Holocaust unit. Yay....the excitement. Now don't get me wrong it's not that I don't respect the Jews or anything. In fact, I commend them for making it through such a great struggle.....but the unit is so repetitive. Been learning this since Grade 7. So took some notes down about that...and the bell rings. Yup...Oh yeah and the results of my Math Project Maisie saw. Yeah she thought it was.......interesting? Hahaha nothing can be worse than Thompson's picture though....a fish turned football? Underwater. Yup.......it's pretty sad =P. You wanna see it? Click  urlLink here =P.  So after a boring history class....came a very boring civics class to follow along with it. Learned about governments..and how no matter which way you go.....you go too far it leads to anarchy and chaos. Yup.....governments...you gotta love 'em=P. They're as cuddly and lovable as.....a ball of nails? *Gets impaled by one and dies.*  Nope I'm still here...that could just be my Sprite Can that did that.....huh?  Oh yes and I have yet to discover another talent of mine. The water noise I can make w/ my mouth *for those that know what I mean* I can make it hitting the top of my head. Works sometimes. At other times it just hurts *ow.*   After civics class....went out to Galleria for lunch. Hmm...blasted Leafs. Winning against the Senators....BOOOOOO! Now Nate and Shawn can mock the me and the Senators for losing. *Shakes fist.* Uhh....GO AVALANCHE! My favourite team. I'd just rather see the Senators win. Will it happen? Yes. I hope. So yup.....went to Galleria w/ Mike.....everyone had to do something it seemed today.......Subway for lunch then headed back to school. *yawn.*  Math class......trigonometry isn't THAT hard. Calculator is your best friend. Without it....yup I'd be screwed. Project handed in....and for rest of the day we did these trigonometry problems. Triangles scare me. *Why Joe will never be a engineer....he hates physics and triangles and geometry of all sorts.* Oh yeah which by the way....my course roster for Grade 11:  English Music Math Chemistry Biology Accounting Law PAS (Psychology, Anthology Sociology)  Funky huh? Yup thought I'd scrap the whole "FOCUS ON NUMBER CRUNCHING!" idea and go for the Asian 3 pack and some Social Science courses. What am I gonna be when I grow up? Hmm....maybe a new job field:  Biochemical Psychiatric Medical Accountant of Law. *hhhhuuuuuh?????????*  Oh yeah and Guilfoyle kinda came up with a good question too: WHO the heck really does read my blog? Who are the 2300 people that have hit my site? A mystery never meant to be solved *unless I'm geeky enough to check every IP address.* No I'm not.  PROGRAMMING CLASS.......sub teacher *YAY!* so did nothing for whole class except draw stupid pictures on photoshop and fiddle around with default turing programs. One really cool one that was like a basic MSN. Connect to people and chat. Reminded me of TelNet back in CTG *Cheesy Text Game* days. *Sigh* geeky grade 6 and 7 days. Brings back memories......REALLY text-like memories. And sleep. *Snore*  After the day of schoool....oh wait it's not over. Badminton practice! Won't say much about that......me and John gonna probably be Central Doubles team A. Then Alex and Gimpy, then whoever else. Unless me and John have a bad day when we choose the A's, B's and C's. Central junior Boy's singles is gonna whoop ass though this year at conference. Jacob, Brandon and Hermann are really good. Probably one of them could school me and John.  Bused home.....and now I'm sitting here. Lots of crap to do tonight. Theory, Bio lab, read stupid book. Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. Jenn how can you possibly think it's a good book? Lol so far all I've got is there's a depressed woman that eats a lot and has started to talk to a woman that blurts out about her life story to random people. Sounds kinda......Soapy Operashy? Meh......got another 300 pages to read or so......so don't judge a book by it's cover....or first 64 pages I guess now also. It can't be THAT bad of a book...can it?  Hmm.....still gotta do some devos for today. And I'm off....for now. Yup.......uh.....food looks good upstairs hehe. Lates.

       4/12/04   Aww...Easter Weekend's Over *Sigh*   Burgh........back to good old school.....er more like old school. Good shouldn't be in there =P. This really isn't my happy day......I mean I was so happy shifting to 10 hours of sleep today...and tomorrow I'm waking up at 630 once again for senior band. *Sniff Sniff, Shakes fist.* YUP....great way for the week to greet me:  "Hey Joe! Haven't seen you in a while for school.....I'M GONNA START WITH SENIOR BAND! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA SUFFER! FOOL!"  That's my rendition of it at least....if not everyone's. Good to know at least I didn't spend my last day of the week in agony hermitting in front of my compy. So I avoided one thing lol...and got other things done =P.  My day's schedule got pushed back a bit today as instead of waking up at target time of 9am....I decided to relax and sleep until 1130 lol. Wasn't all bad.....I got more sleep......a very precious commodity during high school and university ^_^. So headed downstairs....ate....and then a phone call barrage/chaos erupted...  Yeah....today I had to go to Gavin's for planning for praise. Took us a LONG time *Not gonna go into gruesome details* to FINALLY get everything set up and done and over with. Don't know if final outcome was for the best....but I think so since also we got some hefty ground covered for praise night. So after the loooooong delay......we FINALLY got into the car and off to Gavin's.....making a stop @ Carmen's to pick her up...and FINALLY we arrive at Gavin's 30 minutes later. Lucky this ain't Toronto.....couldn't imagine what life would be like if it were like that lol. Wait....SUBWAY! =P.  So finally made it to Gavin's *trying to make this blog speedy gotta get sleep* and started planning. A few accomplishments made today:  -Got 22 songs brainstormed for Saturday -10 or so themes to think about -Scripture for those themes -I CAN SWITCH FROM C TO G TO E MINOR CHORD ON THE GUITAR SMOOTHLY!  OOOOOOH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT! MY CHORD EXPANSION IS AT ABOUT 8 NOW AND I CAN SHIFT BETWEEN THREE OF THEM WITH GRACE AND SMOOTHNESS! And of course the other things too lol. So got all that stuff covered.......ate some food *courteously provided by Gavin's parents hehe* and fiddled around with compy for a bit...then off to Wendy's for dinner and just some good times.  Dave and Tommy were there also....which I forgot to get 15 bucks from Dave. What else? Hmm........just lots of jokes and stuff......eating of course......PS2......chattin' and an unfinished game of Chinese Checkers.  Anyways....I'm off to sleep.....after this weekend one must adjust back to crummy school time. 6 hours of sleep *shudder.*  Cya.

       4/11/04   Another Sister of Christ Baptized: Many congrats Steph =)   Hehe to think that 8 years ago we were all in Sunday School learning songs like "Jesus Loves Me" and winning food if we could memorize a Bible Verse. And to think now, 8 years later, in 2004, I'm sitting in the pews today listening to one of my fellow HYPE members Stephanie Chan, giving her testimony and anointed with the Holy Water, representing her full affirmation of Accept Jesus Christ. Yeah it was a pretty cool and touching sight. I mean as she was being baptized, even I was thinking:  "Wow.....to think we were all little 7 year olds trying to memorize Words of Faith for gifts and prizes. Now, we try to remember Words of Faith to bring others to Christ and gain Spiritual gifts and prizes, and to fight off the temptations of Satan."  Ok that is a little bit more fancy wording, but it was basically around the area of that =P. Another thought that popped up I guess *as of every other baptism I've attended* I started to wonder "when will it be my time?" Only God can tell =).  Well this happy day started off with my usual morning awakening to another sunny day. Hmm....weird I woke up at 830.......WTH 730?! Ugh stupid clock fooling me.....er eyes. So yeah slept for another hour. False alarm hehe =P.  *1 Hour later*  OK NOW IT'S ACTUALLY 830 *unlike that stupid fake 830 an hour ago* and now I'm alive and about. Walked downstairs, ate, got dressed, usual hygiene morning routine....and WOOSH! I'm out the door! Went to pick up Lina for her first day at LCAC *wonder if she liked it* and then off to pick up Jason also. Then usual 5 min drive from Jason's to the church.  Hmm......got there pretty early today. Mike, Dan and mom came today which was nice to see. Really hope those two dudes can bring their whole family one day....got real big hopes on em hahaha *pressure's ondudes.* Jokes jokes. So headed upstairs......was pretty cool seein' Gavin leading worship. Yeah and Ali Austin and Chris were also up there today. Hmmm....thinkin' about it bummer.....this is gonna be Ali's 3rd last time leading worship? Graduatin' so yeah I think it's either 3rd or 4th last time. 5th maybe? There's my math skills for you hehe. Ushered for a bit before Brian finally got there, and Wendy took my spot in place of Gloria. And then service started.  Today started off like usual....opening prayer and then songs of praise. Afterwards though.....Steph said her testimonial. Hmm......if I'm not wrong is she the first English testimonial person? Even if not that, she's the first HYPEr to be testifying before baptism hehe. It was actually a very touching story.....I won't say anything though as I don't know if she would want me to post it up on MY blog. It is her story....so I'll let her tell it =P. So listened to her story, and then afterwards Pastor D went on with his sermon after Carmen read Scripture. Today's story: Easter story....er actually more of the story of what HYPE studied last night: how we benefited from Christ dying and rising from the tomb in 3 days. It was actually pretty interesting what he had to say though...  Before that though......ouch much bashing on the dentist kids @ UWO in LCAC today hahaha.  "Yup......though there is much suffering and pain in this world....to think one day all of it will be gone, and I'll be in heaven, way from war, pain, suffering, sadness.....and dentists."   Dentists not needed in heaven? Jokes haha....but yeah still just the moment when he said it lol.....everyone just turns to Jesse and laughs *Jesse slowly hides behind church bulletin.*  Pastor D was saying how obviously many of us in this world will say "how did we benefit? What changed? I mean, there's still pain, suffering, sorrow, etc." But when you think about it.....and it even shows in Bible..Christ gave us the boldness and courage to go out and preach to the world about the wonders that God has done for us. Before Christ died, the Apostles were even kinda shaky about the Faith, and even fled when Jesus was arrested. However, after Christ rose, they would die, and even be crucified just to stand up for Christ. So yeah changes and benefits did come, but sometimes we are just too blind to see it. So yeah just a bit of a heads up for me even I guess.....I mean it's always good to have reminders like that so we won't be led astray.  After the service *which Lina said actually wasn't that bad* we headed downstairs for refreshments. OH YEAH CALVIN'S NOW OFFICIALLY REFRESHMENTS CO-ORDINATOR HAHAHA. CONGRATS MAN lol. Actually it's cool seein' us all gettin' more involved in church.....it's a start.......funny one but it is a job hehe. Cookies were good though so good start Calvin haha. So chatted, ate, you know usual stuff and then headed to class.  Yes class today....HILARIOUS lol. We wrote stories....er more of news articles of what news might have been back then when Christ rose. This was me and Josh's interpretation:   THE WOMEN WHO CRIED RISEN!  The Good Book said He would rise in three days. And right it was. Early this morning, local prostitute turned Catapult Dynamics Enginner Dr. Mary Magdeline was going to pay her respects to Jesus, a recently crucified carpenter/teacher when she found the tomb opened. The 54 ton rock guarding the carven tomb was rolled away. "I was surprised to see that the guards were not there. With my knowledge of wedge-tool dynamics, I concluded that no wedge-tool could have removed a rock of that magnitude with such magnitude! It was inconceivable!" She also reported that she and friend Mary "Mother of James" Smith encountered an angel at the tomb. The angel told them to "Go out and tell the others" that Jesus had risen. On their hasty way, Jesus apparently appeared to them. Smith tells us: "Dude! It was totally rad. Like, Jesus totally rose from the dead. He was right there and we fell down and praised Him! We got to touch his feet too! It was totally far out." Rumour has it that over 500 people have also seen the risen Jesus. However, that remains to be proven and this reporter, for one, will not report the senseless chatter of blabbering midwives. This is Jahoravich DingleShmienz reporting for the National Inquirer."   You like? Haha Hope you did took me 3 minutes to type *OH NO!* So after that fun filled class we headed upstairs to watch Steph's baptismal, and of course the others. Heh Josh got the video and I got the pics. Argh stupid recharge time....only got 3 pics lol. Well s'all good.....the point is I'll remember it....since she is the first HYPE kid to be baptized. Once again....many congrats Steph =P. So after the baptism headed back downstairs for some chattin', and pictures w/ Steph. Yeah she got flowers, gifts, you know.......cool stuff hahaha. And yeah picture taking was funny lol. I had to head out early though.....had to go home and help chop down Mr. Tree in my backyard....the one that's been back there for....well as long as I've been around hehe. Since I was born lol...well right when we moved in so 13 years. yeah big old tree. Never noticed it till today lol.  So got home....ate.....Jason came over for a bit too....was on compy while I chopped down tree. STUPID TREE SAP.....ugh so friggin' sticky. It's like glue...but smells like crap and probably tastes like it too lol. So did that quickly then headed down for some games of NBA street and NFL street. WOW lots of wasted time.....BUT WHO CARES POINT IS IT WAS FUN =P. So did that until Jason had to leave....and then drummed for an hour, then ate, and then......  And then........PLANNING FOR TOMORROW WHICH WAS UTTER FAILURE. Though my day didn't end off too well......I am always seeming to be on optimistic side.....and well yeah I looked on bright side here too. I mean though Josh can't make it to the planning tomorrow nor Rebecca, me Gavin and maybe Carmen will still push ahead and try to come up with as much as we can. Well we still got a few days so no worries hehe. Praise night ain't till Sunday anyways. Well after thinking more.....isn't that bad I guess. I mean...who knows....God could be doing this for a reason. I mean............predestination.....it exists. Everything's planned. So yeah there is definitely a reason why Josh can't make it tomorrow.....and I'll leave it be for Christ to reaveal to me how it was for the best hehe.  Anyways....yeah I'm out for the night. Gotta wake up, do theory, read, finish math, then head to Gavin's tomorrow early hehe. Later boy's n' girls =P.  OH YES HOW COULD I ALMOST FORGET..........MAISIE MAD PROPS FOR HELPIN' ME WITH MATH TODAY Lol. Thanks a bunch =).

       4/10/04   Ergh....Laziness......taking.....over   I never thought I'd fall to such a level of laziness.....today I literally did nothing. I mean I tried going to UCC....but absolutely had no will.....I had no will to even pick up the phone and call people to chill. Yeah today....was laziness at its worst.....took MANY bullets of laziness today. Guess there were its upsides though. Drummed so much my arms began to hurt lol. And just had some time to relax, chill out and reflect I guess. Also....I don't know why I was so tired today....interesting.  After playing SC until about 1am (hey you think that's bad Jason was up till 4am on that game) I slept until 10am and then woke up. Had to do some piano practice before lesson. Yeah this week's total practice time: 140 minutes lol. Yeah I'm havin' horrible time with piano practice lately. Oh well...least I'm gettin' stuff done still. Oh yes and I'm still extremely behind in theory lol. Gotta do that too. Right now my list of things to do is somethin' around this area:  -Theory -Math project -Bio Lab -Piano Practice  Yup.....my hectic Easter holiday. Work? Yeah I can't believe I have work this Easter. Saddening I know. Really need to get priorities straight though....*shakes fist* WHY MUST NHL PLAYOFFS BE NOW!? SO MUCH CONFLICT lol. Argh.......always tempted to watch the Leafs being massacred *how'd they shut out Ottawa?* or watch the Avs trample the Stars into pixie dust. Grr......but instead I'm stuck on either Compy or in front of piano.......working away. ARRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!  Piano lesson: gotta catch up on theory...and my music's going really well. Not much else to say =P. Good playing....crappy theory. Yup......lol. Good old piano.....least I'm doin good at it =P.  Yeah.......my afternoon: VERY BORING. I wanted to sleep...BUT ARGH SO MANY INTERRUPTIONS! PHONE=GAYNESS TO THE MAX. If I only had one I'd unplug the piece of crap..but I'm not about to go hunting for phone cords in my house, nor will I take wire cutters and butcher the wires. Unlike Adrian's mom I'm smart enough to realize not to lol *she cut their cable.......LITERALLY.* So giving up on sleep, went to drum for an hour or so, then SC. Finally assembled enough good people to make it past 40 minutes in Raccoon City. But then.........GAME CRASHED! BLAST! Oh well...only game not like it's a project. I'd punch my towercase *monitor's too pretty......17" LCD =P* if it was a gargantuan project. We talkin' like 50 page essay or something. I'd be REALLY mad. Thank goodness for system recovery lol....and Ctrl+S.....don't know what I'd do without that =P. *coming out of geek mode* I called Age afterwards to come over and chill for a bit. Got further in Silent Hill 3. Yeah 3 of us in that room afterwards....me, Adrian, Jason and we still scared shitless at times lol. It was good times though.......had a few good jokes. Lol some fat monster looks like a Sumo wrestler...and when it deflated when we died.....wow we all just started laughing. Yeah but then found out it was 5:50.....CRAP GOTTA GET LINA FOR HYPE lol. So I quickly took Adrian's bike and jetted my way down to her place lol. WHEW bikes go much faster than walking. After not using one for over a year......yeah underestimated its usefulness lol. So got there in record 5 minutes *NO WAY* and back to house in another 10.....we walked back since she didn't exactly have a bike also. So yeah......HYPE meeting would start soon.  Well by the time I got back......yeah Josh, Becca, Steph, Calvin, Gavin and the Twins would be here also. Brian and others would come afterwards too. Yeah showed some TC vids.....my video blogs haha. Yeah they are pretty interesting......blogging during TC lol....on my camera. Yeah I know it's kinda weird. Actually if one day I can...I wanna set up a video blog for myself. But this will do for now =P. So after everyone got here *Age had to leave but meh* we started our HYPE meeting at my place.  Started off with a bit of singin' led by Steph......then went into Bible Study. Talked about Acts mostly today....and what the Lord left us after leaving for heaven again (Holy Spirit). Also talked about the purpose of Easter holiday too hehe. Hmm........prayer groups got together w/ Gavin, Jason, and Lina. First time leading a group......wow it felt so weird lol. Yeah to think next year Jeff may lead HYPE hahaha. Funny but cool also. To think the dude used to come to Sunday school with us. And Josh may be counselor in two years......yeah far out lol. Unless he going to University...which reminds me JOSH FINALLY LET ME BORROW INFO BOOK! YES! Now to see what my courses are like for university lol. Must choose.......grrr.  Anyways back on topic. So went through some times of sharing.....lol lots of talk about b-ball........Lakers rivalry between Lina and Jason building up already haha. Jason absolutely hates them and Lina loves em haha. Good to see us gettin' to know one another already haha. So prayed, talked a bit and then FOOD! Yeah JT also announced this is his 3rd last HYPE meeting. S'all good though....he still gonna be around....just helpin' out more w/ ACF on campus. Wonder if I can join ACF lol. Wait till I'm a froshie I guess hehe.  So yeah that was basically my lazy day. Sleep, Piano, SC, then HYPE. HYPE meeting was cool though.....jokes, good times, and just gettin' closer with my Bro's n Sis' in Christ.  Well I'm out. Lates. Easter Sunday tomorrow. STEPH'S GETTING BAPTIZED *congrats Steph!* Lol made a fe jokes about that...."QUICK STEPH UNLEASH ALL YOUR ANGER BEFORE THAT HOLY WATER HITS YOU TOMORROW!" Quoted from BK hehe. Or JT's "LET'S ANOINT HER WITH PEPSI!" Lol. Oh yeah and made some jokes about if HYPE had initiation:  "Dear *insert name here,*  But due to the lack of good grades, you have been placed on the HYPE waiting list. Yeah basically we are saying YOU'RE CUT!"  Or the thing about "Ok....so you new? Ok lead the Bible study =P."  All jokes though hehe. Well yeah that's it for the night hehe. Later.

       3/9/04   Good Friday...Remembering what Christ did for us on the Cross   Yeah I probably should have done that a bit more today. Well I mean I went to service and everything...but I know in my heart and soul that that just isn't enough. I should have done more devos....which I still need to get cracking on. Today took a bit of a turn though for Good Friday Service....instead of headin' down to LCAC I went with mom to North Park. Today was a pretty quick passing day actually.....even though it started early. It was good though. Well I guess I did have some quiet time w/ me and Christ. Service was good...plus afterwards I did just sit around and have a moment of silence. Wasn't on MSN or drums or anything....well slowly I motioned over to drums. I've been pretty amused with my new 4-piece setup lately. Since my drumhead broke....the new setup actually isn't bad. Less things to hit....but waay more fun =P. And then Badminton for most of afternoon.....so dead tired after that....  So like I said before......woke up around 8:15 to go to morning Good Friday service at North Park. Couldn't really get a lift to LCAC.....but hearing how retarted Gavin and Calvin were today at church...yeah I'm kinda not regretting going to North Park lol. It was a pretty cool change though. Service was pretty quiet today. Reminded me of a Remembrance Day assembly. It was pretty quiet....remembering what Christ did and of course communion. It seems kinda weird...but sometimes when I go to North Park and see people like under 10 taking communion....I'm wondering do they really know what they're doing? I mean....it clearly says in the Bible in 1 Corinthians 11:29 it says:  "For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself."  So I'm just wondering if those younger people even know what they are doing when they take the bread and cup. Half of them I bet think it's just a mid time snack during service. It really gives me an uneasy feeling when I see them taking communion. Even today I just sat there meditating like I would at LCAC, since I'm not exactly baptized yet. Well....wait a couple more years. Congrats to Steph though....this Sunday she will be embraced by Christ through the act of baptism. Congratulations Steph on affirming Christ is your Saviour!=).  So after the service came home......sat around.....MSNed, then drummed for almost an hour. Ate...more drums lol. Then some SC. Hmm.....yeah today's pretty relaxing....needed it though since at 2-6 I'll be playing baddy, which was SO  much fun today. So I'll just zip through *sc sc, drum, eat, scsc, drum, zZzzZzzZzz* and it's now 1:30. Yeah planned with Lina and Yang to meet them at Sarnia Rd.....so I'm off!  WTH WHERE ARE THEY!? UGH! Yeah I sat around waiting for 30 minutes.....and then I just thought "OK it's been 30 minutes.....I'm gonna start walking." So I get to UCC 40 minutes later.....AND LO AND BEHOLD THEIR IN THE GYM! DESERTERS!!!! OMG! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT THEY WERE WAITING AT OTHER TRAFFIC LIGHTS! ARGH! Oh yeah and the Gavin Josh thing:  *on phone* Gavin: JOE MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR US. Joe: OK.  What happens? THEY GO IN! Ugh........so I ended up waiting 40 minutes out there for nothing. I felt like jamming badminton birds down his throat....but of course I wouldn't since I'm a peaceful dude =). *Sinister laugh.* Naw j/k I don't even have the voice to make one lol. Best imitation I can make is the cheap laugh Mike has at times haha. So yeah......after finding out all the people were inside already.......I FINALLY get dressed into badminton gear.....and..........BUH NU NU NUH! JOE HAS ENTERED THE COURT! *Uh who cares? He sucks at Badminton =P.*  Yeah so from 2-6.....WHAP WHAP WHAP AI YA! KUM BOA AAH! Yeah Badminton was fun. Had some REALLY good games nearing the end, but at beginning....WOW DID I SUCK AT PLAYING. Oh yeah saw Big BK there too *Brian Kung.* JT also came by and said Hi, but yeah lots of people were there. In my group alone there were like...8 of us lol. Me, Lina and two of her friends, Josh, Gavin, Calvin, and then Brian. We played some doubles....me and Josh owned Lina and her friend lol...oh yeah and Me, Gavin Josh and Calvin....MAAAD GAMES LOL. Indescribable haha. Too many jokes =P. So did tha from 2-6. Lets see....made one mad play with returning smashing......two returns then WHAM THE THIRD ONE MY RAQUET FLIES AND IT MAKES IT OVER! IT'S GOOD! WHOO! lol...what else. Oh yeah totally demolished another feather bird...this is why 15 year olds shouldnt play with feather birds. Hmm.....what else. Beat Calvin in a quick singles game up to 7, Josh and I beat Calvin and Gavin....me and Gavin lost to Calvin and Josh....Gavin skooled Josh in singles. Great times this afternoon....badminton never fails =P. When I think about it though....yeah this may be the last time I see some UWO students. Kinda noticed that again while playin' with Brian today. I mean people like Ali, Mike, Connie.....such great people movin' out back to T.O. Wish them the best of luck on future edeauvours though hehe =P.  So yeah.....playing SC with Josh and them right now. Omg it's taken them over an hour to kill Josh and it's a 3v1....me and Jason died while back lol. Yeah it's taken Calvin, Gavin and "Vboi" over an hour to pierce Josh's D.  Hmm.....yeah and I wonder if Avs are beating Stars tonight.......I was gonna watch game but meh SC caught on....plus chattin' w/ Jenn on MSN right now.   Hmm.....speaking of which I forgot when her B-Day is.....and she wants me to call her then.....Hmm.....problem? Yeah just a bit lol. Maybe if I have $$$ I can buy somethin'. Hmm....yeah I'm out for the night anyways.....leavin' w/ these words:   "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. "  -John 3:16  .....Heh one of the more famous lines from the Bible....guess just a reminder of what Easter really means. not the chocolates, capitalist commercials or Cadbury Creme Eggs. It's about remembering that Christ died for our sins, and rose 3 days later, conquering Death and giving us Eternal Life. Well yeah....I'm out for the night. Piano, Devos, maybe a bit more SC. Hehe lates all....and Happy Good Friday and Easter.

       4/8/04   WHOO! LONG WEEKEND!   Before anything else..........YEAH I THOUGHT THE SENS WOULD WIN! And it's SENS game Shawn....Leafs game? I'll call it that when they win Stanley Cup sometime in the next......75 years? Hopefully anyways....yeah so so far basically the teams I rootin' for *Vancouver and Colorado.....Sens over Leafs* are all doing well =D.  And of course FINALLY the long weekend is here. After a long waited week.....through many toils and fatigue....it's finally here. Easter Weekend. I'm just wondering what I'm doing though this weekend......so far it's lookin like this:  Friday: Good Friday Church Service, then Badminton, then Workin' Out Saturday: Don't know yet.....I still got Piano *Shudder* Sunday: Church, don't know what else after then....maybe homework? Monday: No clue at all.....depends if I do homework on Sunday  As you can see I'm mass future planner eh =P. I wish I was headin' out to Toronto this weekend though....I mean 4 days you can do some stuff...Martha was gonna have a reunion.....arghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lol I wonder how many are goin' to that though. Oh well for me....I gotta wait for summer to come. If any other Maafaah kids read this......tell the others I said hi =). I'm still stuck in good ol' Londontown for weekend....waaaaah Toronto!  And on a daily note......to summarize up my day.  Woke up this morning with the notification stuck in my mind of the fact today was last day of school week. So waking up this morning was pretty joyful. Though it was a day 2, no worries =P. It was a pretty cool day two, and of course just the fact it was end of school week.....that cancels out all possible sadness =P. So this morning headed to school with a smile on knowing "in 6 hours.....the dictorial attidude of school will be forgotten for 24x4 hours" =P.  Music class today....NO REP TEST!? SHWEEEEEET! Mrs. Wharton was unfortunately sick *mood change there hehe* so we sadly had Mr. Clark teaching us. Yeah apparently Mrs. Wharton was sick today so Mr. Clark merged the two classes together into one big class. Wasn't too bad of a class....played music like usual and stuff. Not much happened in music today. Just usual little jokes and stuff. Then we broke up for brass ensemble, wind ensemble and whatever the saxophone and percussion do. Us brass people just sat around twidling our thumbs...talking...which leads to this little quote:  Connor: EVERYONE SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME! I'll conduct =). There's only a ME in TEAM Fred: Oh yeah? Well there's also a U in SUCK *strange laugh like science geek from the Simpsons*  Yeah the main focus was probably Fred's line.....lol U in Suck. Never really thought of that play on words.....very creative haha. Oh yeah and heading back into class......found Tanis conducting? W...T.....H? Teacher not doing job? *looks outside* OOOOOOOH he's conducting saxes....good call =P. Saxes seem somewhat musically challenged at times thats all lol. Jokes.  Science....today we had 70 minutes to finish up this vector assignment. SO stupid. Got to know Toronto a bit better though haha...Gavin, Josh, David and Jason: next time I'll actually know where I'm going in Toronto....hey at least I know Toronto better than Dave sadly =P. He lives out there. Anyways yeah finished the assignment....then went out for lunch.  McD's for today. Yes some grease platters.....my favourite *not.* Wow took forever to decide where to go today though. It's kinda nice to have McD's every once in a while though I guess. Wait what am I saying? Eeew I should smack my head against the wall for that.....EEW what WAS I saying!? If Subway was 3 bux for a sub combo I'd go there everyday. Why must Subway cost more than Chinese Dim Sum it seems at times? I can get a platter of fried rice for the price of a footlong sub. But I still buy it every once in a while...just don't go overkill on $$$.  Bio class.....Saliva lab. Spitting in 4 test tubes gets you pretty dehydrated after a while. It was pretty sickening too though. Saliva+HCl+water=almost solid solution. Eew. Lol or maybe it was just the cracker at the top acting as a plug. I don't know but when I turned tube upside down....it didn't spill out haha. Lab was pretty cool though. I looked like a crack addict splitting up a soda cracker into 4 piles of crushed powder with a ruler. Yes.......I kinda realize why crack addicts are retards. Wow I felt retarted doing that lol. Spendin $500 bucks doing that and then killin' yourself in the process? Wow......you need rehab =P. Only another 75 minutes and home time! =).  English.......IT'S ENGLISH NOT HISTORY CLASS! We spent 70 friggin' minutes relearning the depression 30's. My mom n' dad pays their taxes for me to learn history in history and english in english.....NOT HISTORY IN ENGLISH....ESPECIALLY RELEARNED MATERIAL. So we spent our time learning about that....dunno why but apparently it links with our new book "Fried Green Tomatoes At the Whistle Stop Cafe." A book that flips back and forth between depression 30's and a retirement home with a crazy woman that talks 24/7 about random stuff and a depressed woman who eats a lot. REALLY weird book and I don't see why it's considered an "amazing" book. IT'S SO STUPID. But who cares about that..when it's HOMETIME! =). WHOO! THE BEGINNING OF 4 AND A HALF DAYS OF FREEDOM! FREEEEEDDDOOOOOOOM!  First thing I do for long weekend: HEAD 2 HEAD GAMES LOL. I know it's kinda sad...but hey it was pretty funy =P. Tried out BF Vietnam.....GREAT game but I prefer original BF over it. Got overrun on Omaha like last time. Oi and in Midway map.....watching the water go by while swimming......VERY nauseating lol. But it was fun times there for 2 hours. After playing BF and BFV played some Quake III. Haven't played that game in almost a year.....and only 2nd time playing. Wow......2nd, 3rd, then 5th place. Not bad for first  time playing lol. Arjun was there too....oh yeah almost forgot about that. I beat him =P. My style of playing derives from Adrian's a lot........circle strafe, mash keyboard to dodge bullets, etc. Works very well =P. Quake III is so funny and stupid...but fun at times haha. Got a ride from Mophead home afterwards. Dunno what Arjun did. Was actually kinda weird seeing him there then gaming with him. He's an alright kid though I guess.....got nothin' against him. Then again I try not to make enemies.  Like the Lord said:   "Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD."  -Leviticus 19:18  Sometimes when I think about Christianity.....I mean I don't see why people like to throw it away. I mean...really in the long run it helps you. It prevents you from doing stupid things and theoretically if all is done by the Book and His Word.....this world would be perfect. *Sigh* why must people ignore the Love of Christ? Life would be so much easier for everyone.  Like I was saying earlier though.....after Head 2 Head got home. Ate, Drummed, then SC for a bit. Played two melee games with Jason then.......HOLY CRAP 7PM ALREADY!? NHL TIME! Sens Vs. Leafs....  WOW Leafs can't penalty kill. And bad luck for them too...after scoring 3 minutes in.....Marchment gets a puck off his skate and past Belfour. Whoops? Hahahaha afterwards they'd lose anyways.....4-2 for Sens. I fell asleep though....got the score from Antoine haha. Fell asleep after 2nd period......soo.....  *WUMP*  *3.5 hours later*  Yes I'm awake and well now.....it was 11:50pm.....now it's almost 130am lol. I've been around the house eating etc. etc. Gotta sleep though soon...still got Church service to head to tomorrow....ugh won't be able to sleep though from a 4 hour nap...meh. SC? Anyone? lol j/k I've had enough of games. And I just missed Conan O'Brien. *D'OH!* So yeah.....nothin' much else left......guess sleep? Lol Later.  Happy Easter everyone!

       4/7/04   Stress: Something Joe FINALLY encounters in life   I've never really even thought about my life being stressed. I mean back in grade 7, 8, and even 9 everyday after school.....I'd push homework to very last priority and drum, chill, snowboard, or do whatever from 230-9. These days though......life's been a bit more difficult. I mean school I'm trying to gun my average up, and theory.......oh boy dreaded theory. Mrs. Mitsis is going to kill me soon lol. I'm gonna try typing this blog up a bit quickly, as by the minute I'm missing the Colorado Vs. Dallas game for playoffs. NHL playoffs kicked off tonight....and at the moment Colorado is winning 2-0. WHOO! So yeah this blog will hopefully be decent length.  Today like any other Wednesday I woke up at 630 for band. I got decent sleep though.......I actually felt well slept when I woke up at 630am today. Headed downstairs, quickly ate b-fast and then headed out the door for another morning of band. Gr. 10 band seems so easy now ever since I headed up to senior. I can sight read pretty much anything now. I just hate hitting really low notes on t-bone. Today we managed to go through a full repetoire for rehearsal. That's.......new. Lol VERY new. Usually we play through 10 bars and work on those. So I was amazed when we managed to go past 20 bars. NO WAY!  So after a grueling 1 hour band rehearsal.....I head to history class. WWII went by quickly. In a week and a half we are already done the war lol. Covered how Hitler lost the war, and how next day we are going to be starting up the Holocaust. Got propaganda assignment back too.....20.5/21. *Shrug* my marks going up at least =P. Hmm......yeah nothing exciting ever happens in history or civics, especially on band days. Too tired to pay attention.  Civics class I typed up my essay on JFK. What? Do I have to say more? TYPE TYPE TYPE TYPE TYPE. *TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK.* ZzzZzzZzzZzZzzZzzZzzzZzZzZzz.  Lunch time. Today headed out to Galleria. Subway.......haven't had it in a while and it still tastes good =P. Too bad Canadian Subs closed.....that place was actually pretty good. Cheap too.....closed down though wonder why. So ate that....then headed back to school. No homework or anything today too lazy to do any...I'm really tired today.  Math: FINALLY WE START TRIG! I don't get it at all........something about similar triangles and stuff and making lots of lines. Why does trig look so dumb? I have no clue...but it looks really stupid. Pythagorean theorem at its dumbest. I hope Mr. Gilbert doesn't screw up his teaching like last unit....vertical compression and stretch he flipped around. *sigh* You wonder why 3/4 of my class is failing math. I don't blame them....Mr. Gilbert isn't the greatest teacher. He's cool...but he REALLY needs to look over his notes.  Programming........hmm not much. Surfed net mostly today. Turing is getting pretty funny with graphics. My animated dude kinda walks properly. He walks better than Finlan already though. At least he can walk more than 10 centimetres without complaining about being gimped =P.  Badminton practice today.....I REMEMBER WHY I DON'T PLAY SINGLES. I'm HORRIBLE at it lol. Played Pokan today.....got murdered by him 11-4. Ouch. Yes this is why I stick to doubles. We also did badminton conditioning today. We actually did DRILLS. HUH? Yeah I thought badminton was lazy sport apparently they have drills for us too. Strange. But practice was fun. Played a few games....though I'm doing horrible for badminton last few days. Don't know why.....lack of sleep? Maybe.  Bused home then.....got home around 5. From then till 8 I drummed, did theory, ate, and then slept for a bit. Then theory class.  Managed to finish a thing or two.....shweetness =). I'm not as behind as before.  Got home....and did homework. Right now still watching hockey game. Apparently it started at 10pm.....Calgary and Vancouver started at 1030. WHoops so when I turned on TV Avs were already winning 2-0 lol. Right now.....9 minutes left in 2nd. SO yeah this blog took a while to type with procrastination and stuff. So yeah gonna finish watching game then head to sleep. So yeah today......wasn't bad of a day....I mean I got stuff done, and even fit in a short nap. So yeah I'm out for the night. Later.

I'm lazy today....so.......POINT FORM BLOG *yay people are going to punch me for this =P*  -Woke up -Senior band...I'm getting better and better each day =P -Music.......not much here -Science: BOOOOOOORRRRRIIIIINNNNNG......tried getting out of homework by saying I sacrificed homework through Lent =P.

       4/5/04   *Yawn* What it's Monday already?What? LITERACY TEST RESULTS!?   Bleh.....Monday already? Bummer. Well I woke up like usual this morning...to a very sunny morning. I'm still trying to adapt to daylight savings time.....so boring. Well headed downstairs then and ate, then headed out the door. Ugh school's been so repetitive lately. I mean if it weren't for the english plays, good test marks and watching everyone get in trouble in programming class.....wow would school be super-boring. But then again...isn't school already boring? Hmm......today would be a bit different though as our Heavenly Father slowly unraveled the day he had prepared for me...  Well on our way to school....amongst the fighting over radio station between Patrick and I, and the constant debates on why rock music can suck sometimes (Lenny Kravitz=SUCKS) we finally got to school....and we were on time....almost late but not quite =P. History class today.....studied D-Day. Not much excitement.....I learned too much from MOHAA when me and Paul played it at his house over LAN lol. Oh yeah but then after all that...the suspense came...  LITERACY TEST RESULTS!? AWW CRAP. Something I've been hoping to avoid all year. Blast it finally comes. Then slowly....as I take it....out...of....the.....en....vel.....ope.............................................................  ......................................................................................  I PASSED! WHOO! YES! I'M LITERATE ACCORDING TO THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT! YAY I'M THAT MUCH CLOSER TO GRADUATING! NO MORE PANICKING! I CAN READ! I CAN WRITE! NO ABC LEARN FOR ME! WHOO!  Yes I passed.....and then announcements came on. Lalalalala..............I PASSED! *Apparently 5/300 Gr. 10 students failed.* Oh yeah got course verification forms today also. Need to figure out basically my life by next Friday *eep.* Prayer request please? =).  Civics class we worked on our leader assignments today. Whoo.....I get to do a whole assignment on JFK. You know, Cuban Missle Crisis? Got assasinated? Youngest president ever of USA? Well I'm stuck with doing him....which I'm not exactly complaining about compared to what others got. James Naismith? I mean it's an easy subject but BASKETBALL? *Shrug* What kind of leadership rubric does Canada have? You invent a sport and you're acclaimed a "leader?" Wow......next time I'll invent like........Chinese Checkers and win that. Oh wait it's been invented *BLAST!* I still find History and Civics back-to-back REALLY boring. I don't get WHY this school seems to think it's perfectly fine for a student to take over 10 pages of notes in one morning. I'm gonna get carpal tunnel syndrome probably soon from all this writing. Typing's different....more healthy maybe? =P. Not. Oh well.....I don't CARE. Typing's more efficient then graphite on paper. And I'm rambling....  Lunch: Went to Jasper's today with the Mopsta and Mike. Did theory H/w and ate.  and Now I'm going to zip through the rest of my day as NCAA finals are on now!  -Math: Got bashed on about Nowitzki Jersey by Courtney. Who cares though she's wearing Iverson jersey....the jersey that almost every kid has even though Philly SUCKS.  There's a reason why no one buys his jersey anymore. -Programming: did programming.....drew pictures....surfed net. -Home: Drummed....sc......etc etc.  And NOW I GO STUDY AND WATCH NCAA FINALS!  DON'T KNOW WHO I'M CHEERING FOR BUT *SHRUG.*   LATES!=P

       4/4/04   Ooh......triple 4's =P....Final days of some UWO LCAC people   Yup.........it's already the end of the UWO school year. Lucky ducks......we high schoolers and public schoolers still gotta suffer another two months while they bathe in the 17 degree celcius May sun......or go back to Toronto. Bleh.....then there's us still toiling in our binders in our classrooms like there's not end. But instead of thinking about that........there's much brighter things to think about in our lives. For example.......church today.....  First day of church during daylight savings time period. Yup.....for the next "x" amount of weeks our human biological clocks are basically set forward an hour, meaning we have to RESHIFT our body's adaption from winter. So like everyone else I lost an hour of sleep *grrr* and woke up and then left for church. Yes daylight savings time seems to still have some people forgetful. I mean I've seen that happen before.....but what happened to Jason today I'd never think I'd see lol........  Basically what happened was Jason........he set his clock because I kinda reminded him last night. But......instead of setting it forward......he set it BACK another hour. So technically.......he's two hours behind at any moment. This is the first and probably the ONLY time I'd see someone fail to set a clock properly. He was wondering why he felt so energetic in the morning....maybe because he slept for 10 hours? So when I got to his place to pick him up...yes he was sleeping. And so I headed out to church then. He'd come afterwards but yeah.....setting your clock backwards more than it already is? Sad................lol  So got to church on time still.......and I had to do ushering this morning in place of Grace since she was doing praise and worship. Steph came afterwards too to help. Josh today was on Bass in Worship. Bass+Piano isn't that bad of a combo at all. Message today was about the verses in Chapter 4 (vesres 8-9) that talk about basically thinking of positive things....and do/think about things positive if you want the Heavenly Father to be with you. One song that really hit me was probably "Be Thou My Vision." The idea of Christ being my lifelong vision......fits theme really well hehe.  And then.......afterwards today NO SUNDAY SCHOOL! Today was the day where we head to Youth for Christ center and just have some fun.......last day for some UWO students. *Sigh* to think Conni, Ali and Mike are leavin'......graduating already *sniff sniff.* So quick......I still remember last year when I made a remark basically implying I thought Connie was 30 when she's barely 24 lol. Or back in Grade 5 or 6 when I played the piano for Children's Sunday School's Christmas performance replying to Ali's call for a Pianist. Seems like such a long time ago.......yet so short also. And of course Mike's unforgettable announcement time always after service:  "Hello everyone and welcome to LCAC. Is there anyone here that's new that'd like to introduce themselves?"  Yeah that line will be remembered on and on throughout the years lol. So we all headed downstairs after benediction.....and just hung around for a bit. Took a few photos....talked.....ate food.....  Well at the YfC place.......we basically just chilled.....talked you know good times. Playing ball and stuff. Wow.......I made 3 HUGE rejections today.......so cool though lol.......I seem to play better ball fooling around =P. Also Bump was fun....though I lost both times it was pretty fun playing it. I got some people out ^_^. And yes like usual Gabe was a beast at ball lol...probably best player at LCAC. Chilled with some people for a bit.....but most of my time consisted of playing ball and fooseball and pool and volleyball lol. Then one game of Big 2. Basically my afternoon was pretty fun. Our church should have more of these occasions. Yeah but I'm gonna miss those UWO kids.....lol me calling university students kids.....makes me look like im 30 haha.  Then ride home....got a lift from Pastor Mackness. We had to wait for Steph's mom and Gavin's family to come pick 'em up though. Lol so we all waited around for a bit. Kendrick started kicking Brian's car for some reason lol....and I got chased around the parking lot for throwing a volleyball at Victor's Camry hahaha. Gimpy in the end kinda beat the crap outta me but s'all good.....I hit his car and I felt sorry for the guy.....making a gimp run after me hahaha. Boy if he reads this blog he REALLY gonna whoop my ass lol. Oh yeah and when Victor was chasing me around ready to kick the crap outta me.......Kendrick took his car and tried to run me over too lol. In the end we all waited in Pastor Dale's car........and eventually yes they did come.  Hmm.........bleh after some running from Victor hunting me down and also avoiding being chased down by his Camry....FINALLY I got to go home lol. Got home and first thing on agenda: TYPE OUT HYPE REPORT. Done =P.....then..........SC!!!!! lol.  Yeah played a few rounds of that...I really suck at the game now.  Drummed afterwards...  Then dinner......mmmmm........food. And then after that.....well bloggin' hehehe. Yeah today was pretty cool day........I don't know why but lately I seem to not be able to fill in detail gaps anymore......my 3 page blogs have shrunk to 1.5.  Then again......yeah I think I should probably start doing my devos soon.....Purpose Driven Life= REALLY GOOD BOOK. I've been encouraged to read it every night before I sleep now I think. I like it a lot though.....probably gonna recommend it to a friend later on. Actually Lina said she wanted to start reading the Bible.....figure this mite help a bit =P. Oh yeah and just talkin' to Mike Chan just now.....apparently he's been operating on non-daylight savings time for the whole day. HOW I don't know but somehow he did lol. "No wonder why work today was so weird." Yeah no wonder =P.  Well anyways.....yeah I'm out for the night. To HYPErs: SIGN UP IN OUR NEW SITE:   urlLink    Lates.

       4/3/04   Why does it seem like the world is shrinking?!   Though Walt Disney sorta figured out the world is a small world....I never knew it was THIS small until today. Today at HYPE meeting I'd find out that Kendrick....one of my HYPE counselors apparently went to the same church as Jenn, Peggy, and others. Lol kinda funny to imagine that he's now my HYPE counselor. Today was a REALLY long day. Beginning at 8am with badminton and not ending until later after a game of SC probably lol. And blasted daylight savings time....ugh got one hour less sleep 2nite >_  Like I said before today my day started at 8am. UCC badminton.....yup once again I'm headed to the UCC for more badminton. So I woke up, quickly ate, and ran out the door. Though I was supposed to meet Thompson there today at 8.....I kinda was 20 minutes late lol. This time though he was on time......so he had to wait for me. Well my Uncle *who's name is John also* was already there when me and Thompson went up there. Lina and Yang were there today also. Played some mixed doubles game.....and then a guys doubles game where it was me and Thompson vs. my uncle and some other dude. We lost 15-8 *crappage* lol. It was pretty cool though....I've actually got a bit better now =P. Fit in around 6-7 games.....and then left for home....still had to do piano.  Piano practice....ate.....more piano.....then left for piano lessons. Wow.....fun eh?=P not.   Piano lessons......got nagged at for being behind theory....but my pieces for Kiwanis are still soundin' good.......JUST GOTTA KEEP THIS SOUND GOING FOR 2 MORE WEEKS...........AND DO MY THEORY lol. So yeah piano lessons weren't that bad. Didn't get yelled at =P.  And no time to lose.....after piano lessons went to hand in my Kidney Foundation canvass stuff.....but the place was CLOSED today. Ugh.....stupid form...so now I gotta go again on Monday when it's OPEN. Grr......waste of time going across London for nothing. Bah.  So came back home....ate.......played SC.....and then got ready to go to Wendy's for HYPE tonight. SC was amusing...I guess. I've started getting back into it again. I need a better comp....I want to play Battlefield Vietnam....gah stupid P3 800mhz......I need a "l33t" comp. Oh yes the word "l33t," bit overused by Megatokyo.......but what kinda manga would it be w/out the nerdiness? That's one reason why I like it. "PH33R MY L4CK OF B33R!"  So off to Wendy's house for HYPE meeting. Well pre-meeting to plan out rest of April. Before that though...played some PS2 w/ Kendrick and Josh. SOUL CALIBUR II= HILARIOUS GAME LOL. Wow.....playing 8 on 8 is so cool. It's like Street Fighter........but with more  bling bling and cooler moves lol. It's actually pretty cool game....lol cheap like any other fighting game but it's really amusing. Oh yeah and Wendy seems to complain about a 51" widescreen TV being to small. What's wrong with her?! lol j/k Wenders =P.  Never really realized until today how many people are graduating from University this year. Mike, Connie, Ali.......*sigh* so many people that I first met in english service when I first started coming. Also Connie will always be remembered being one of the pioneer counselors of HYPE.....her, Jesse, Amanda, and Janice were like the pioneers of HYPE lol. Mike....well he was always announcements guy lol and Ali well she's our present HYPE counselor......plus she's been around w/ our church for a while now....as the others. Gonna be so weird next year not seein' em in service....as they are back in Toronto. Well there's always visiting =P. But yeah just planning stuff today.....end of UWo school year is so close........yet High schoolers still gotta suffer for two months *shakes fist.* Basically this is what's comin' up:  April 10th: Easter study April 17th: Praise night April 24th: Farewells and year end party ^_^  Those are the last 3 meetings Ali and JT will be in unfortunately though.....but they do have their other callings from Christ still too. But it's for the best that they do leave since it is God's will. Hope they remember us and HYPE =P. After the planning and discussions *oh yeah I gotta type up email for HYPE about this,* had an IMMENSE dinner courtesy of Wendy's family and then HYPE meeting w/ the rest of HYPE.  HYPE meeting..the actual one. Today's lesson: Corporate vs. Consumer churches. Basically we were learning about how we could serve in our church *kinda like Spiritual Gifts workshop* but we got more in-depth with a church's image also, and how a church shouldn't be judged on looks but on the people inside. I liked today's lesson...and it got everybody involved which was cool. Oh man.......but Steph tonight was just lashin' out the burns lol.  Gavin: Yeah....my brother's been a bit mean to me lately. Like we haven't really been talking. Maybe it's because.... I'm a bit of a..... Steph: Jerk?? Gavin: OOw.......................  Then the rest of HYPE starts to laugh too lol.....then there's me  Joe: Yeah I've been thinkin' lately that counseling seems pretty cool.....I mean the idea of helping people w/ their problems and sharing your feelings with them... Steph: Joe remember counseling requires listening.  And since I'm a talkative one........yes the rest of HYPE once again chimes in with OOOOOOH'S and LOL's. Gavin shot back in the end though......saying something around the lines of "Yeah Steph is doin' all this 'cause u know.....it's all gonna wash away all squeaky clean when she baptizes." Yeah I bet half of you don't get it....but it was basically makin' fun of her baptism. Not very smart but it's all jokes haha. Steph then made more remarks....but I think I've said enough lol. Hilarious night though. Yeah......but honestly I've come to start to really get more involved with my church lately. Pretty cool though....I mean doin' Worship at times, Ushering, etc. On the side I also like to "counsel" people w/ their problems......great feeling when you see another bro or sister of Christ or even just a random person walk away with their problem solved. Kinda makes me consider Psychology a career route =).  After some prayers, sharing, and of course FOOOOOOD! Had some of that.....took a cookie and pop and then had to go home.  SO yeah that's the shortened version of my day......HYPE meeting of course also had teaching.....and oh yes JT's friend came too.....forgot his name though =S. But fun night tonight. Hmm.....things to do now. Set my stupid clock back for daylight savings time....and then sleep. Stupid clocks.......why the heck does Canadian gov't make us do this? Waste of time...and sleep. Argh. So yeah I'm headed to bed now......only got 5 hours of sleep left technically. Lates.

       4/2/04   Hmm.....Joe? Improv?? Uhh....POSSIBLE =P   Lol today I kinda got in touch with my acting side....I think I'm a bit of a ham.....but hey who cares at least I tried =P. Yup...Me, Heather, Katherine, and Robert's rendition of Romeo and Juliet: Act 3 Scene 1 (the rumble). Wow I never thought we could be so......dumb? lol. But it was a pretty good play......one of the more memorable ones I guess haha. Today actually wasn't too bad....well I enjoyed the day at least =P. Got sleep last night, and everything ^_^. So today was actually a pretty....well...."energetic" day?  Like I said I slept early last night (11pm....WHOO 7 hours of sleep OWNS!) and managed to wake up on time for once (6:20am or so). It's Friday so band....yup Senior band again hehe. Actually got there on time today though....hahahaha wasn't late =P. Today....hmm.......well I'm not used to 5-page long music in band yet......so I kinda accidentally skipped a whole page of music in Godzilla Eats Las Vegas. They were @ bar 40 and I was on 139....whoops >_>.......  Music class.......whoo playing test today. Eeew I did so bad. Well "chinese-failed" at least.....also a Joe-Chan-Music-Fail. 90%?! Yeah I know it's high but normally I can whoop those things to 100. Grrr.....oh well least I'm passing =P. Then we split up into our little groups for the ensemble things. The brass group I'm in actually sounds pretty good now.....lol Mr. Clark burned the saxes today also which was pretty funny....  Frederick: *hears saxophones* hey....I think I've heard that tune before....sounds famliar....it's actually good too. Mr. Clark: The first sound yes....the last one they made is probably a sound we never want to hear again.  Then there were woodwinds too....don't know what happened with them. Mrs. Wharton was conducting them. Oh yeah and the song Son of a Gambolier.......WOW does it sound good now lol.  Science....we did a lab today where we ran around da school with those trundle wheel thigns measuring out hallways. 3rd Floor reeked of something REALLY gruesome.....and I couldn't breathe going down biology hallway (pig dissections I think?) Both ways.....*shudder.* But lab was kinda fun. Mr. Curphey made Rhoden go last though....wonder why *cough*. And Pourier got another detention for throwing paper lol.  Lunch......went to Galleria. HAD CHINESE FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD! Haven't had that for lunch in AGES. Fresh fried rice.....yeah it  still appeals to me =). It was pretty good stuff......I might consider going there more often ^_^.  Bio class today........Wow...........................one of the most funniest classes ever. Ms. Wiener I think had a bit too much caffein flowing through her system....but it was funny what happened today lol. Just so much random stuff *can't really describe* but it was funny. Unfortunately I got dissed by Drew today. When she called him Joe by accident his reply: "How dare you insult me like that." Ow. That's all I could say lol. It was a funny class though......then she started ringing the bellringer bell.........and sang Okanski Happy Birthday lmao. Oh yeah.....and also when we started talking about old children TV programming......LOL. She actually KNEW Transformers theme LMAO THAT was classic hahahaha. Then Okanski:  "Man.......Power Rangers was so cool! I mean at first I was like 'whoa the red ranger kicks ass' but then the White Ranger came along.........MAN WHITE RANGER WAS WHERE IT WAS AT!"  Yeah my bio class can be pretty unforgettable at times. Oh yeah....now I know why stomach acid doesn't burn through your esophagus when you vomit...mucus protects your epithelium! But what about the sink?=P. Why's it stay alive hehe.  Oh yes........english class today.......soooo unforgettable hahahaha. The plays today were hilarious. Lol.....the best one I can remember other than mine was probably the one by Kelsey, Anne, Holly and the fourth person....forgot who whoops =P. Anne's imitation crying lol wow it was funny. Then again.....I think our play whooped some SERIOUS ancient Shakespearean ass =P. Lol first off though we had wrong 007 theme for our opening.........WOW JAMES BOND TECHNO W/ OUR PLAY LOL. Me and Robert jump onto scene with techno music playing in background...then I speak in Jackie Chan accent "MY PALM PILOT SHOW CAPULET COMING! LET US HIDE!" Yeah the whole class.....was cracking up through the whole thing. Mrs. Gayed couldn't hold in her laughs either.......Robert's Teddy routine......wow it got her cracking up for sure. Oh yeah.......and then for the fight scene the music we got was uhh........P.Diddy's "Come w/ Me?" LOL it was good though.....the whole fight scene was hilarious....and then the intermission music lol.....me and Robert draw the "bodies" of Tybalt and Mercutio. Oh boy good times good times hahahaha. This play's gonna be stuck in my head forever. Oh yeah then the Chinese Take-Out remark I made....kinda made fun of Chinese food but I had to say it. See there was this one line about sadness....and one part was "instead of a wedding feast, we are now going to be mourning at the dinner table" and I said somethin' like "instead of a wedding feast.....we stuck with Chinese Take-Out again." Yeah I realize what I said.....but it was pretty funny at the moment. Oh yeah and English test: 90% BeeHATCH! =) YEEEHEEEHEEHEEHEE!  After the wild english class, bused home w/ Ryan. Then went home. Tonight no UCC, no nothing. SC ALL NIGHT LOL. Yeah I know no life but who cares lol I'm dead tired today. So SCed, piano, dinner, SC, piano, theory, and now.......SC then SLEEP! =P.  Later.

       4/1/04   April Fool's Day: Was it playing a joke on me @ Badminton?   Wow.........I don't know what's with me today....or just with badminton.....but was April Fools plotting a joke against me? Lol I don't mean to sound cocky but I don't know how I managed to be undefeated at Central's first Badminton Quad Meet today. But yeah.......wow today's Quad meet.....TOTAL JOKE. Practices at school are more intense than today. Yeah though Oakridge gym sucks, their floor is like a skating rink, and their nets were always kinda sagging down in middle.....me and John still managed to shut out one team, and keep all the teams below 10 points. Well actually all but one below 5 points lol.  Today I managed to start the day off at 7:30. Yeah got decent sleep last night....wasn't too bad. French Toast for B-fast but we are now officially out of maple syrup *sigh.* So I'm stuck with....other sources of sweeteners for French Toast now. Grrr........Why can't we get more maple syrup. Headed out to school then....gave Patrick a lift also today.  Got to school......and wow history class got off to a REALLY lame start.  Ms. Manson: Alright class today we begin to look at what else was happening around the world in World War II. Better pay attention you gonna be havin' a quiz at the end of the day.  *class in pure silence*  Ms. Manson: APRIL FOOLS!  *more silence*  *Sigh * Ms. Manson's sense of humour for you. *ZZzZzzZzZzzZzzz.* After our class finally got the joke. Ha. Ha. Ha. .......... Yeah it was pretty boring as you can see. We focused on Russia campaign and how the Germans got their butts whooped, and Sicily and how Italians back in WWII basically did nothing. WHOA THEY INVADED ETHIOPIA....ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. PIMPS! And when we invade they surrender immediately lol. So yeah history was kinda interesting today I guess. Talked about more than just Brits and Canadians.  Civics class today: talked about the Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau....you know the one that had TrudeauMania and everything? Probably biggest PM Pimp ever lol. Dated celebs, known throughout the world.......yeah he was like swingin' 60's Austin Powers for sure hahaha. Also he pissed off USA, and united the French.....what more could be better =P. So yeah I guess he was a pretty awesome PM....*shrug.* Sounds more exciting than Jean Chretien or Paul Martin......most excitement they got is yelling at each other for a scandal that made Canada lose over 30 million dollars. Gains public attention AND hatred? Wow great combo.  Lunch..went to Galleria today. John didn't go though and instead gave Mike $$$ to buy John's food to bring back. Lol felt like pizza delivery boy for a bit since I had to caarry the stuff. Heather and Jessica I think is her name came along too......well more like by coincedence.....funny though since Nate burned Heather...forgot what he said but was pretty funny lol. Hermann also was acting like a queer today......I don't know what happened.......Quad Meet attitude? hahahaah j/k. But yeah today's lunch....."WEIRDED OUT" in quotes from Strong Bad.  Math class......yes I was late like usual. I kinda jumped in and asked "AM I LATE?" when everyone was sitting in desks and Mr. G was already writing stuff on chalkboard. *OOOOk I think I'm late* was my reaction lol. Mike then ran in and gave John his lunch lol. Pretty random I know....running into a classroom with a box and a pop? lol yeah I was wondering how embarrased Mike felt. Then again he ran X-country so he's used to it =P. haha jokes man. Math was pretty straight forward.....learned about "similar" triangles today. You know they look the same but ones bigger than other? Those things....*shrug* it's math boring ok? Well except for when funny things happen lol. Oh yeah and math mark........82 NOW HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! IT'S GONE UP TWO PERCENT! Shweeeeeet.......now to worry about english *grr*.......  Programming class.....lol 5 people get kicked out 30 seconds into class hahaha. Oh yeah Ryan's back from suspension also *anti-semetic material on his site* but he was still kicked off comps lol. Dan apparently can actually make a Pac-Man game while we are all just animating Pac-Man. REALLY scary..........BUT COOOL haha. Hmm yeah worked on Hyperstudio.....I'M NOW OFFICIALLY DONE! ^_^.....not much else happened.....pretty much just couldn't wait for Quad meet.....exciting no =P. Actually it wasn't as I'll explain later....  BELL RINGS! YES! QUAD MEET! WHOO HOO! TIME TO OPEN A CAN OF WHOOP ASS! Well we left school around 2:40.....and me Hermann and John got to take the Taxi school provided haha. Arrived at Oakridge....and found Gym without much of a problem.   "Joe John you idiots it's over there." "HERMANN notice how all the athletes are headed left." "Shut up."  That was basically only problem lol. Other than that we were stoked and ready to whoop some ass. Now personally I thought we'd win........but not obliterate. Actually in fact I thought we may lose a game or two.....but no like I said we obliterated EVERYONE lol. It was pretty funny actually....playing at school was more intense than playing today. In fact some people are actually WORSE than Finlan. IS THAT POSSIBLE!? Sadly yes lol. 6-0. UNDEFEATED IN 6 GAMES. Sadly lol. I thought we would die....since I mean me and John we kinda suck but surprisingly we won all 6 lol. Finlan won one game in mixed....and Hermann was 6-0 also. Girls didn't do too bad either. I think Aleksandra *however you spell her name* will be pretty good Gr. 10 when next year comes. But yeah first Quad meet of the year.........what a joke lol. I started practicing playing w/ left hand and my horrific net serve. Oh yeah also somehow when I was practicing smash we beat Saunders 11-0 lol. So yeah note to self and other badminton players in London: Saunders, Banting *no offense Lina=P* and Oakridge are HORRIBLE lol. I wonder if STA sucks this much this year....I MITE BE ABLE TO GET PAST ROUND TWO THIS YEAR AT CONFERENCE =P. And oh yeah Thompson......he's got his smash back now *sorta* hehehehehe. Net shots today were actually pretty good though. Don't know what I'd do w/out backup haha. I'd be screwed in Singles. So yeah props to you Mophead...good job today haha.  Gave John a lift home....then headed home. Some houses in his area are HUGE. Apparently one mansion has an indoor pool, outdoor pool and skating rink. Wow. BIIIIG house. So yeah gave Mophead a ride back home and then I headed home........to my house. Ate some stuff, blogged for now....and now I am going to go do other things. Hehe lates.

       5/31/04 Aaah.....relaxing start to a week   I asked...and God provided. Not the first time either, which I'm thankful for =). Sweetness though....last week was one of the most hectic weeks ever, and today started off so nice and easy. Great start for a week. No work or anything....just watching the day drift by slowly....ahh yes that awesome feeling of "yup I'll just sit back here and watch the day go back." It's as enjoyable as...mmm coffee...mmm tea....  So my day today started with the awakening from my 6 hour slumber at around 730 or so. It was kinda weird last night. For some reason I didn't feel like sleeping, and decided to pull out my WOW Worship 2001 CD from my dusty CD rack...  I have no clue why either...when I bought it in gr. 7....I had never liked it thinking the music sucked. Hmm guess my music appreciation has broadened now though. It led to me listening to it for almost an hour, wondering why the heck I had never listened to this stuff earlier. Apparently Stacie Orrico existed back then...and Rebecca St. James had an awesome dance song "Reborn." Oh yeah that's the other thing...  OMG THERE IS CHRISTIAN DANCE MUSIC! I found a new brand of music to add to my already growing blob of listening music =P.  WHY DID I NEVER STUMBLE ON THIS STUFF EARLIER!? I don't know, but I'm sure as hell gonna be going to Upper Room or Creation soon to grab more =). But yeah...after reviewing a bit of PDL...I quickly fell asleep as I was dead tired...  So now away from that flashback. I quickly headed to the music room to savour what practice time I could for my trombone solo, and then studied the wee bit before the test we had today. Mr. Boldt was the weird person he was...some ways I think he's worse than McCumber. He sounds like a drunk at the front of the room when he talks to us. Well the music test was a joke...I only forgot one or two things but the other things were really easy. PHHT music history.....boring and useless =P. So 75 minutes of pure crap.  Then science. YES signs of year end is approaching with textbook checks and test dropping. UTTER SWEETNESS!!! So I get to drop my first test which I got 73%...yes that was my lowest mark and also we had some assignment to do that was pretty easy. got 95% on ecology test...yeah signs of the year end is approaching everywhere...which whoops ass =). Not much else happened that I can recall...think that was it.  Lunch: practiced solo. Yeah me and Arjun managed to get through the whole song! Dave Rutt then owned my song...sight reading it *since he played it last year.* Gah...to think I have to be that image next year in senior band....er in two years. Blargh.  Bio class: had Kevin Luzak's sister come in and talk to us about organ transplanting. I think I may sign a donor card...why not save someone else's life if I could...I mean I'm dead anyways...not like I'm gonna be using my parts anymore.  English: Cafe thing got scrapped for today since no one brought food. But we played this game where we had to identify ourselves from FGT....and then get in groups to make a skit. Ours was pretty weird...with me, Lilian, Lucy, Rachel, and Kelly *I think that's her name* doing the skit where Ruth gets taken back to Whistle Stop w/ Big George, Julian and Idgie * I was Julian =P.* Yeah pretty weird class...and we had to tape the sheets we had the other day about someone from FGT into a big tapestry...dunno why....many of us thought it was a waste of resources.  Getting home....I slept for the majority of the early evening. But before that....started listening to the same CD I was listening to last night and doing my devos. Hehe today I also realized that God had always made time for me to do devos......I just never saw it. After school everyday....I have nothing better to do normally so I SC. But honestly that game's gettin' a bit old...plus playing it for 3 hours is kinda lame sometimes. So yeah the one hour after school now...I think it's gonna be my devo time. Spent a good one hour studying Mark 12 after reading a section in PDL which led me to read my Bible then. And then sleep I went =)...  *Waking up at 7:30pm or so*  The time from waking up till now has consisted of watching game 4 between Calgary and Tampa *where Calgary is losing at the moment this blog was made grrr...* and also blogging, dinner, and gonna start math review soon hehe.  Anyways I'm out now. Oh yeah and on a side note...    I'M RANKED #107 ON GOOGLE IF YOU SEARCH "Daily Cup O' Joe."   Later.

       5/30/04 Blargh...a Sunday full of work   Ugh....so much work to do today...so little sleep last night. Bleh the two worst combos that can happen. So today wasn't horrible....but it had its downsides. For example....the whole lack of sleep thing, lots of work...and my DDR file went corrupt. Me, being the lazy one just shut the PS2 off while it was saving, so yeah I gotta start all over again *grumble grumble.* OH well.....least it's only DDR...takes like an hour to beat =P.  Well today started off at 7:40, getting ready for church and heading out the door by 8:15 or so. Grabbed JT, and then Grace and then we were off to church. Jason got a ride from Carmen and Lina would get a lift from Vince. I was still trying to shake off my morning slumber, as the ride to church was pretty tiring. Things picked up though when my dad started talking about the Saturn SUV, and before I knew it me and him were debating over why dent-resistant cars are good/retarded. Yeah I know pretty random...sad part is he says next car he's thinkin' about that SUV. Then again he'll probably change his mind again...at one point was Jetta TDI, then Protege 5, Mazda6, Mazda Tribute, Ford Excursion...the list goes on and on...so by now I'm not worried what he says about the next car.  We finally arrived at church at around 830....and got right down to business. Ran through the songs real quickly with Gavin, who got there before us and then before we knew it, 9:15 was near. We almost had some problems with the laptop....BUT I FIXED IT! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Service today...hmm I broke my blister during the sermon....which was kinda gross so I rushed downstairs to grab a band aid...and also to avoid projectile vomiting if anyone else saw it. The sermon today was about "Pouring out your spirit." What I thought the message was this morning was that in order to fully believe in God....you have to fully let him take control of his spirit. The respone song I felt today was really suitable, being the song "Sanctuary" which goes like this:   Lord prepare me To be a sanctuary Pure and Holy Tried and True With Thanksgiving I'll be a living Sanctuary for You   There are a few more verses, but that one's my favourite. I like it mostly because it's telling God to prepare the sanctuary for you....not yourself, since this is something that only a power like Christ can handle. Plus....I also have enough burdens right now with school....so it's nice to know also that God's always there beside me preparing me with my spiritual walk, and also the other things on the way I request help for. I also liked today's memory verse:   "In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams."      -Acts 2:17   It's also pretty cool having the assurance to back up my thought of Christ always with me with this verse. It's cool to see how in the last days....which literally means as the end times near, God will be with all of us, every step of the way. It's pretty cool to know how there's someone always there for you....even if you're in times of trouble and no one else is there, except Christ. So yeah....for once I didn't zone out totally at the sermon....and actually enjoyed today's sermon =).  Heading downstairs after the service....BANANA CHOCOLATE CHIP LOAF! I dived on that, ate a lot of it, but was still hungry. So then...to burn some fat *fat? Joe? HUH?* Carmen taught CiCi hot to tickle me....which then got me on a running marathon from a 7 year old trying not to be tickled, as yes I am a wee bit ticklish. So then after that run, I then chased Gavin down for a gummy bear, where I emerged victorious with a red sour one =). Afterwards though....yes I was still hungry, and Gavin was also...  That was when we then stumbled on 12 boxes of Cup Noodles *aka bui mein.* So we took a case and started making two cups, when then the whole HYPE group plus JT, and Kendrick and the people that were with Kendrick wanted one too. So by the time we were done eating, we downed 3 cases of Bui Mein lol. Mmm......Monosodium Glyceride....or w/e MSG stands for...always forget the G...  Class....was basically an extension of Sermon. Yup...except afterwards while reading Jason's GMR magazine....Lina and Josh kept throwing a Tic Tac box at me...which then led me to throwing my duffel bag at Lina and punching Josh. Yup.....that's most of it. I learned a new chord on guitar though! =) Plus I know how to play a F chord now....just not well.  So then getting home. Took Lina and Jason home first, and then got home to see a whole lunch of Take-Out Dim Sum already out. Mom had gone to Dragon Court to pick some up....so...the next 30 minutes consist of eating, eating, and more eating. Mmm.......food......  Played the piano a bit, then trombone, then piano again, then played DDR. This was when my file would be lost....as I shut the PS2 while it was saving causing a corrupt file to emerge. Oh well....yeah like I said not exactly an insanely hard game to beat. So after wasting time like that.....and having some productive time with the music practice....I headed to my piano lessons, since yesterday they got rescheduled to today.  Piano lesson: I need to work on scales/technique more....and got a new piece =).  Then for the rest of the night....hmm some SC, and LOTS of homework. Gotta start on history, english monologue, study for bio, math, and music still. I got a London Youth Symphony audition on Thursday....and I hope I make it. Hehe it'd be awesome if I ended up being a tromboner in LYS. Shaunvir's tryin' out also, and Arjun's going for trumpet. Meh....least I can still sleep. I'm still boggled by how Jenn manages to sleep so little and not get sick...and still manage to go to school. If I get less than 5 hours of sleep, I don't go to school. Period. Yeah London's pretty slow moving though. Just lookin' at people like Rebecca, Gavin, and even myself....we all seem to be pretty lazy people lol. Oh well anyways...getting off topic there...  Yeah I gotta go finish up some work. Heh first average blog in a while hope you enjoyed it =)...  Cya.

       5/28/04 Ahh...back to normal   Whew.....finally the week is done. As though it wasn't long enough...yeesh. Ugh this week has been filled with many ups and downs, but I'm just happy right now that my week is over and a new one is about to start around the corner =). So now life is much easier, without the bothersomes of band, I can sleep in until 720am every morning now heeheehee! Haha so Jenn's all alone now with waking up that early. Least she finishes school earlier than most of us...lucky bum.  So my day started off at 720am like usual, and got ready and stuff and left the house around 750. Got to school around 810 and when I walk into history...yes I realize that I did my essay somewhat wrong. Apparently we had to cite EVERYTHING and not just quotes....so yeah I'm gonna lose a few marks on that essay which sucks =(. I still don't get how my history mark dropped 8% from two assignments, so yeah I gotta ask about that next day. Today though we had our first presentation. Maisie and her 50's group did their presentation today, which wasn't half bad. Hmm after history...came civics...  Took up some of the exam....but Ms. Manson still has to mark the essays. So for the rest of the year....we have to do some project about us being a political party. I got stuck into a group w/ Hammond, Dave, Lindsay, Brittany, and Melinda. I dunno what they really did....since I had to go get ready for the spring teams assembly or w/e....which replaced MOGA....which is really gay how that happened....so after 40 minutes of class me, Dave and Pokan got to leave early for the Spring teams assembly. Yes apparently badminton was on the roster this year =).  So we got photos taken, the assembly was pretty lame...yup and lunch came.  Mike John and I went to Stobie's today. Heh haven't had pizza in a while....and I don't regret going to Stobie's. Mmm....pizza ^_^.  Math: Review. Programming: Final Evaluation. I think I did mediocre.  Then bused home....sat around at home, ate, and stuff like that...and then I had to go to the church for worship practice and also cleaning it afterwards.  All that took around...3 hours? from 7-10 basically I was at church...which wasn't bad. I mean practicin' worship w/ Gavin, Grace and JT is pretty cool. We had a pretty quick rehearsal, and then cleaned for a bit. Lol Vince was there yet again ridiculing Gavin's guitar skills.  Hmm so yeah today was pretty relaxing day to end the week. Wish I coulda gone to the Chrome tonight for the bboy event....but oh well things came up....so yeah there's always next year I guess...plus I haven't bboyed in a while now....almost 2 months =S. Gotta get practicin' again...ergh so many things I wanna do...plus now I'm also gonna try out for London Youth Symphony. Arjun and Shaun think I'm gonna get owned....but meh might as well try anyways =P.  Anyways I gotta go start the slide show for Sunday....and go grab sometin' to eat. Maybe I'll play SC. Later.

Plus I've been on a trend of 2 hour naps...which is really cool ^_^. Blasted Flames lost tonight, which makes the series tied 1-1 now which kinda sucks. Hmm rest of my day went something like this..of course much more detailed:  -Music: learning minor scales though I already know them like a Chinese Restaurant owner knows Dim Sum -Science: Bio Test. I think I did alright -Lunch: Mmm Jasper's ice cappuchino rules =). -Bio: Got tests back. 75% on all of them....and 57% on bellringer. Lucky they worth almost nothing. -English: Finished in-class assignment, Kurtis still had his football gag going. Monologues due soon.  Ugh pray for me people....I'm actually working for once. End of grade 10....well I can't relaly slack off I've come to realize. Bummer if gr. 11 and 12 is like this...ugh.  Oh yeah also Arjun and Shaunvir said something about London Youth Symphony Orchestra...think I might join up.

       5/25/04   My day once again ruined by English...   Gargh....I was happily going about on my 1st day back from long weekend, until I walked into my English class. Actually, it was at the end, that I found out I got 67% on my exam. Ugh...so my aim for an 80s final in English will be thwarted, as my exam mark is what's pulling my mark at the moment. So if I'm lucky I'll be stuck at a 78 yet again, and if I say do do amazing on final assignments then MAYBE I'll get back to an 80....which I would be very happy with =). At the moment though...yeah my mark isn't exactly the best....but meh 78 I'm not complainin'. Beats 72.....in careers, which luckily got bumped to 82. So now I'm just hoping for the best for the rest of my year. It's a given my average will be over 80...but I wonder if I'll get that piece of copper signifying I got over 85 average this year...  First day back from holidays was pretty usual usual.....got to school around 8am today since Patrick needed to grab sometin', and I needed to go talk to Mrs. Wharton anyways. Kinda funny though, it seemed as though school started pretty quickly anyways. 15 minutes passes by pretty quick. So before I knew it, class started, I handed in my music critique thing, and got 12/10 on my music log =).  That summed up most of my music class. Other things that happened included my music test reschedule to next Monday, and also notified that solos are in 2 weeks. Yeah I gotta get working on that.....blasted high A flat is still hard to hit. Oh yeah....and next year if I do well enough....I can do no work in gr. 11 music for theory =). So come on theory exam....whoop ass =).  Science class was next...where we basically did review for next day's test.  Lunch went to Jasper's. Food. Yup....what else to say I don't know.  And summing up my afternoon.....heh the format of this blog kinda changed....but oh well the Calgary game's on....and I gotta study for civics....so here it goes:  -Biology Bellringer: Smelly and I think I did OK. -English: Bombed essay...Yup....  That's pretty much it. Then I slept for 3 hours....and yeah.....go away now.  Later.

       5/22/04,5/23/04,5/24/04   Typing up my May 24 Weekend...   Yes....it is finally over...and once again I will be using the same format for mass blogging like I have with TC and Huntsville. You know, the Ctrl+F feature *Find feature* in your internet browser. So once again, if you wanna jump to a certain spot use the Find feature and type in the date "month/day/year."  Here it goes...   5/22/04   Day 1 of May Camp *and getting there*   So the morning after Friday....I got up around 8am to get everything loaded into my van for May Camp. The morning started off a bit rocky, as my mom was still clinging on to that stupid argument about the gas pump filling thing and was still peeved from the night before, so in the end I did forget to pack my coat as I couldn't exactly think too clearly with her yelling in my ear. So got out of the house as fast as my can, as my dad also couldn't really stand it so we were both working as a coalition to escape the grasp of my house and was on the road in no time. The plan of me goin' to Gavin's on Friday Night and sleeping over and leaving next day kinda got scrapped when I found out that my dad's headin' up there anyways, so yeah that's what happened....went with dad instead of Gavin's family.  So while on the road, we talked and stuff, and somehow I managed to stay awake the whole time and we chatted bout a whole bunch of stuff. Everything from cars, to stuff about life and of course just stupid stuff that I don't remember that well now lol. So one hour passed by real quick.  As mentioned, in no time we were at the Heritage College place in Cambridge. Much to my surprise kinda.....  WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF CAMBRIDGE.  I was kinda finding it funny how our church retreat....well one aim is to be away from our usual everyday distractions of the city life...and have time to relax and just quiet time w/ God....when we are on a main road, across from a Liquidation store and Zehrs supermarket. I found that REALLY interesting. Yet they tell us not to bring electronics. So got out of the car, and helped unload the stuff that my dad brought up in the van plus my luggage also. Getting there first people I saw was Steph, and apparently Calvin and Gavin were over at the supermarket buying supplies for the weekend lol. I said hey, but then had to help set up the sound system for the weekend for the seminars and workshops that the adults had. That took about 40 minutes and after that went upstairs and checked out the place we were at. VERY much like home....but with a few more things like a pool table, fooseball table, and ping pong table, which the kids and teens would revolve around much for the next 3 days. One thing that caught my eye though was the gym. It was REALLLY nice. Couldn't go in at the moment though as it was locked...so went upstairs when Gavin and Calvin also came. Oh yeah and Pau Pau also. So we chilled around for a bit before we were told to head downstairs for lunch.  Lunch today consisted of Chow Faan and some noodles of some sort. Think it was Chau Chow or w/e, I didn't have much of it. I ate most of the Chow Faan lol. So we ate for a bit, then headed upstairs for some free time and then our first Bible study, were we met our youth co-ordinator(s): Lindy and Thea. I say the "s" in braquets as Thea was more of just helpin' w/ the little kids....Lindy did all the Bible Study. For the next few days we would be studyin' the book of Nememiah, and how he rebuilt the city of Jerusalem after permission granted by the Babylonian King and also after it had been razed to the ground. I liked the studies for the week....and the first one for a first one wasn't too bad. Started off with gettin' to know one another, and then poof we were on our way =P.  After the study....FREE TIME! yes we got to use the gym. Me, Calvin, and Gavin played some ball mostly for the whole time, ranging from 3-on-3 to 4-on-4 to other stuff that resembled basketball *American 21 for example.* Heh without Jason there, me and Calvin ruled the courts haha. I actually managed to play post fairly well, and also made a few decent blocks. My stats for my best game was 6 pts, 7 assists, and 5 blocks. As you can see I am not much of a scorer, but I play defense a lot. Also couldn't score many points as shooting from the perimeter...besides the fact my perimeter shot is horrible I also took my glasses off after being whapped in the face by the ball twice and them staying intact, I took them off to avoid any further damage. So all I could really do was play post and shoot from inside the perimeter. I could still block though =P, and since Gavin's shot is a chest pass basically, it's not exactly rocket science to know how to block it. In the end though the team me and Calvin had won, as our one player Roy was REALLY fast, and probably took more rebounds than me lol.  After the balling, Josh and Rebecky finally arrived, and it was dinner, so more eating ^_^. Didn't really like the dinner as the dishes weren't that great to my taste, but meh can't really complain huh? So ate quickly, and ran upstairs again to have some free time before our final Bible study for the night.  Around 830 or so Lindy came up, and we finished the Bible study for today. We would continue on on Sunday and Monday, but for today we were finished. We talked about variables that could stop us from doing this for God, and Lindy used Nehemiah as an example with building the walls back up for Jerusalem to bring pride to God's people *the Israelites* again.  After the study, had some free time, ate some snacks before sleep, then me and Gavin took the leftover Chow Faan and brought it back up to our  room....plus some plates and stuff to eat it and also water to drink. Bedside fellowship was at our place, and so we chilled for a bit, just talked about our day, and also had some prayer time in groups. I was grouped up w/ Dan and Wendy, and like the other groups we talked for a bit before praying. Well not a bit, more like an hour of talking and then prayers lol. Sarah, Josh and Gavin talked for an endless time before starting their prayers, and Becca, Steph and Calvin's group I dunno. So after that, it was basically bedtime, well you know we ate our Chow Faan that was sitting in the oven, and also showered and stuff. Read some of Purpose Driven Life, talked w/ Gavin for a bit, then headed to sleep around 1230 or so. So that pretty much concludes my first day...   5/23/04   Day 2 of May Camp: Thoughts and Doubts   Day two of May Camp I really felt God's presence with us. At times I feel that God's presence isn't always a happy feeling of just like "OOOH HE'S HERE! ALL THINGS ARE HAPPY NOW!" I feel sometimes when God is around, the conversations that I have with my fellow Bro's and Sisters in Christ....they just seem so much more out there. I mean I feel God's there, but it isn't like a happy feeling. It was still cool, but the presence of Him helped us with our conversations, and really got us somewhere in our Spiritual Walk. Today, many new brainstorm ideas would shoot up, and I felt that it was actually a pretty awesome day despite the boredom we faced for 4 hours of the afternoon. Oh yeah Jacky and Carmen also came today *the Leungs* so we had some more people to chill with =P.  My day started at 730am with Josh's dad waking me and Gavin up. I slept in till 8am though, then jumped out of bed and brushed teeth and washed face and all that shabang, get dressed then head downstairs. Unfortunately the clothes I had intended for today got ruined 10 minutes into my day with me spilling some Curry on my clothes, forcing me to change 10 minutes after I had just changed lol. But after that, headed down to the main building for breakfast, and then a Bible study afterwards. Breakfast consisted of making Gavin's smiley face cup breakdance, me spinning the camera around, and a whole bunch of other stupid stuff. We ate, and then headed upstairs for some freetime yet again and then our first Bible Study. Oh yeah Rebecca's hair looked like a gigantic cornrow lol.  We continued with Nehemiah, and talked about how leadership is vital in accomplishing' God's will on this world. Hmm....by today I think Lindy figured out that many of the kids it seems in HYPE don't exactly like praying aloud, well I feel that way at times anyways....not that it's bad but I guess many of us are somewhat quiet, so she prays for us now basically and that's it. So then freetime for a bit, and then dinner.  Freetime was awesome lol. Ping Pong will be remembered with the dumb twists we made to the game. One started by Wendy, was the one where you ahve a category like "movies" and you have to say a movie title while hitting the ball at the same time. It's harder than it sounds....anyways me and Gavin butchered that and began to singing single notes from tunes *like 007 theme* and did that so much we just eventually started getting tired from laughing mor than playing Ping-Pong lol. We watched Veggietales also w/ the little kids for a bit, and me and Josh had a game of checkers. He owned me lol. Dan slept, there was some pool, and fooseball would be the centre of attention for much of the time lol. I'm getting better at it =P.  Oh yeah then game time or sometin' with the rest of the church also. I didn't really like it, though we came in 2nd overall. But it was pretty boring. I won't touch up much about it.  Hmm then dinner. Dinner was like usual....I didn't like it lol.  After dinner though.....UGH SO BORING. We were supposed to have a Bible study, but it got a bit delayed as the little kids were going crazy, and also the church going on there was using the place at the time too w/ us so it was a bit crowded and loud. The little kids are really annoying, especially Jordan and Jacky in my opinion. So with the 2 hours+ we had, many of us moped around and it was pretty boring. Jacky owned Gavin a few times in pool, and then had to leave. Oh yeah me and Gavin were really retarded yet again and we imitated DBZ with a volleyball lol. But after all that fun though....eventually it got boring, which led to a talk that me, Wendy, Dan, Sarah, and Calvin had about how May Camp seemed a bit lame at times. The talk lasted about 30 minutes, and it was kinda funny how originally we told everyone to go back in and 5 of us stay behind to talk about this issue. But it was cool though, Sarah made some pretty cool remarks, which I guess in a way makes me have a different outlook on her. She sometimes seems like as though she just goes along with the ride going to church, but she really does have some pretty sweet ideas. Dan also made some cool points, and in the end I think we really got somewhere in becoming better friends with one another, both Spiritually and just as people.  So finally we started a Bible Study after everything was settled down. We talked a lot about things we could do to help our church and even in our schools, and came up with the idea of the Coffeehouse *er mentioned* and also I brought up my hope of seeing cell groups starting in our fellowship. It was pretty awesome, and also now I'm hoping that we could have the Coffeehouse with WLAC. It'd be kinda cool being able to see the two Alliance Churches in London get together and just get to know one another and bring new Christians to know God. So we had a lot of talk revolvin' around that, and Lindy seemed to be pretty interested with our thoughts. So the hour and a half or so came and went, and then bedtime snacks and then back to our rooms.  Tonight for Bedside fellowship, we just chilled. Didn't have much else to talk about, and Wendy decided to lead us into some games. We played one of those games where you like clap your hands, snap your fingers and stuff and have to say someone's name, except the names switch around depending what chair you're in. And if you screw up, the guys got makeup and the girls got pounds of hair gel. Me, Steph, and Gavin were the survivors lol, and it was hilarious watching Dan, Calvin and Josh being turned into blobs of sparkles, or Sarah's hair turning into a shiny round rock from globs of hair gel. Wendy got the front all spiked up, and Becca....well.....Gavin totally failed with the hair gel so her hair looked pretty much the same lol. Me and Calvin used half a bottle of gel in Pau Pau's hair.....so the spikey part of her hair was literally a bayonet. Good times haha. Hmm if I ever get time to find somewhere to post the pics....or develop em I will lol. So after that time of just screwing around, they had to leave, but me Calvin Gavin Josh and Dan were already in our room so yeah.....we just chilled for a bit before we slept. Talked about a few things in our church, and just reflected about May Camp. All of us agree that the people need to pay much more attention to the kids and us, and also next year some of us may organize this part of May Camp.  Well Dan and Calvin left a bit earlier, but Josh stayed back in me and Gavin's room and we chatted for a bit. Mostly about what we hope to get out of May Camp, or why we are even here. I was at a moment thinking why bother coming here, or how this was a waste, but after thinking about what God's done for me this May Camp and for the others, I looked back on to the greener side of the pasture. I mean, one thing I always wanted to do was meet someone from WLAC, and that got done this May Camp with our co-ordinators from that church. Another thing that I also really thought was a great statement that totally eliminated the thought of money for May Camp out of my mind:  "Would you pay $120 to see another non-believer come into the arms of Christ?"  Josh said that after I was saying how paying that much money for a May Camp seems expensive, but when I think about it now, it isn't. I mean honestly I would give everything I could to see everyone in this world come to Christ, so $120 to pave the way for another believer, definitely =). So after that talk, we ended in a word of prayer, and Josh had to go back to his room to sleep and me and Gavin just chatted for a bit and then also headed for some shut eye.   5/24/04   Happy Victoria Day! Day 3 of May Camp   Er more like 2.5....but point is it was the 3rd day. Today got up once again at 7:30am from a wakeup call from the same person, but I would once again sleep in until 8am. I thought I slept in a lot, until I saw Calvin, who didn't come down to breakfast until after his mom poked him with a balloon constantly until he got pissed lol. He came down around 830 or so, just in time for the start of breakfast. So we ate, cereal and macaroni with ham once again, but no muffins or croissants this time =(. Oh well, quickly ate, had some fun with the camera, and then headed for our first and final Bible Study for May Camp...  We wrapped up Nehemiah, er the part that Lindy was focusing on which was leadership in our church. She left us with a few final words, and we gave her our emails....er me and Josh did so I could send her directory and that was the last of the studies. So for the rest of the time basically for the day, we just had some free time. We had everything though, the Gym, Lounge etc. So wasn't too bad. I played some ball in bare feet *which isn't the coolest thing* and also we had some games of some tag game and just chilled also and stuff.  Well lunchtime finally, and we ate and ate. Final meals, and I didn't really like it lol. All the food had no taste it seemed....well the food I ate lol. The fruits were good though...I had two apples =). And once again the camera fest we had since 3 of us have cams, so yeah we took lots of pics..oh wait Steph's camera also...not a digi but still a  camera lol. Also I decided I'd stay an extra 2 hours and get a ride from Alan back to London. So for the next two hours, we just hung out, took some final pics and stuff, and just made fools of oursleves like our HYPE group normally does =P.  Well eventually the time was up, and after some good laughs, it was time to go. I threw my bag into Alan's Cavalier *shudder* and then the ride back home. He had to take some other people too, so yeah the trunk was quite crowded. The car ride actually wasn't bad though, and I had enough room to sleep still so I'm not complaining =P. Got home around 5ish, and from then till now it's been unpacking, MSN, blogging, and dinner.  Ergh gotta start homework soon though. Well yeah that wraps up my 3 days over the May Two-Four weekend....not exactly like UBER EXCITING....HOLY CRAP I TOTALLY FORGOT! Gavin and Dan's Rave party Joke...  "I want to have a party" "What Kind of party?" *Both turn around* "RAAAAAAAAAAVE PARTY! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHOOOOOOOOO ASLDFLIATOIA HTOIAHGHASILF OSHG HGDB HFH GGH DFJGH F HYJGJSFDTJSDAOIJSHJD;LFGH L;KSJ HOIAH FIHGA HFOIJH JG G JGJPO!"  You have to be there, or see the video. Anyways, I'm out...hope you enjoyed this long entry, and didn't find it too hard to learn to use your internet browser more than you already know=P.  So yeah gotta start on homework and stuff...and play on my once again working DDR =). Cya.

       5/21/04   A well wasted Friday of Shrek 2, chillin', and got my new DDR Mat ^_^   Yeah....today was probably one of the best Fridays I've had in a while. Despite mom seeming to think taking to lanes to fill up gas is "normal," everything else went on very well. Oh yeah except for seeing the 3 inch ant that Jason caught in a waterbottle lol. Masonville was great, seeing Shrek 2 and bumpin' into a lot of people also. Finlan, Lindsay, Sarah, Rebecca, Ginnie, and the list goes on. Think I saw over 15 or 20 people there that I knew. Lotta people anyways. So yeah....If you wanna just read about my after school day, scroll down to near the 3/4 mark or so.  So today was final Senior Band rehearsal....well for this year. For Dave Rutt....and some others it's their FINAL band of their lives...at Central. For me....I still got 102+ to go through still for gr. 11 and 12....plus more if I join the other things in music. Awesome band practice though. Some jokes, playing....AND DONUTS ^_^. Mmmm....Timmy's donuts. So talked to Shaunvir and some others about the Senior Band future next year....and Jazz Band. Really hope I make it into Jazz...that'll whoop ass =P. Oh yeah handed in practice log also....still gotta do a review though. So after all that jabbering....it was off to history class.  History we just did reasearch. Really just chatted 'bout stuff with some people, and our group was trying to brainstorm what we'd do for a heritage minute. We still don't know....so yeah we gotta work on that part. Most of the time was just on work....so yeah room was pretty quiet...  Civics class we just studied once again. Me and Hammond started talkin' about the previous teachers that we have had since Wharton is out again w/ a hernia, so yeah we've once again got another sub. Apparently he has a different one though, which is kinda weird. Oh well....so one hour actually passed by pretty quick....and before I knew it it was lunch...  Played ball today during the time of rush dining. Shot around mostly, didn't play mostly because my shot's still horrible, so I decided to work on my shot today. Hmm it's gettin better, my post play is actually not that bad. Only missed like two or three out of 15-20. Too bad I wasn't 6 feet or I'd be playing centre =P. Best position if by my standards, or power forward. Point is....I wish I was taller lol.  So after lunch math class. Reviewed also. Seems like around this time of year like any other year, this time is either tests or reviews for a test or exam or review for an exam. Or a project. So all math class did some review of Sine and Cosine laws, and chatted.  Programming: self explanitory. We programmed.  After school instead of goin' to Jason's to look at his mutated ant I went home instead hoping for a nap. That never happened though as by the time I got home it was almost 4, so I played some games until 5, and then got ready to go to Masonville for Shrek 2. Ate some stuff, and then headed out for the movie...  WHOO I wasn't the last one =P. Apparently Jason was haha. Saw Josh, Steph and Becca first, than Brian and Jason. Oh yeah and Rebecca's friend Rachel came also. Went for 6:30pm show, and oh yeah....saw Gimpy there also. Didn't really talk to him though since well he is a bit of a jackass, so I just said "hey" and went on with my way. So while I was at the thingy where they rip your ticket....yeah I also recognized the person workin' the shift. Apparently Eric in our trombone section was takin' the shift....so me and him sorta thought "Who the hell's that guy? Why's he lookin' at me?" But afterwards we finally figured it out that we both played trombone in band lol. Didn't really recognize him with glasses but his name sounded famliar, and he did resemble someone I could recall. So anyways after a brief chat, headed down to cinema 10 to see Shrek 2...  The previews were all about cartoons and comedies since the movie's PG. So saw a few previews for some movies like a Shark Tale or something, and some other movies that I don't really recall since I was making fun of Rebecca's glasses lol. Oh yeah and the face jokes haha. Anyways the previews went by fast, and the movie started.   SHREK 2 WAS AWESOME!   Won't reveal any of it, other than IT WAS AWESOME! GO SEE IT!  So 2 hour and a half later or so, the movie was over....and a good movie it was. So when we came out I was surprised it was only 8 o'clock or so. So we decided to walk around the mall for a bit. I went outside to call my parents, and then came back in....and they were gone. Josh then also came out, and he also was surprised they were gone. So me, him, and somehow Brian managed to find us walked around for a bit, before bumping into Ginnie and some of her friends. Apparently she was gonna buy a Fender amp *used* for 250 bucks with a cable, but Josh talked her out of it saying it's a ripoff. Even I thought it was though...brand new ones cost that much. Chatted w/ em for a bit, then went on to try to find the rest of the people. While doing so stopped by CompuCentre where I bought a new DDR MAT *^_^* and also by other places. Tested Jason's theory of HMV not knowing about Jin, but at least now they have HEARD of him, just they don't know he has an album lol. SC Ghost is comin' out in a matter of 3 weeks, and also ran into Lindsay, Sarah and Rebecca *no not you Josh's sister I realize you were with us already.* By the time I was done talkin' to 'em, it was 9pm, and we had to go.  Well while waiting for parents, managed to fit in one round of DDR....on a broken mat. Ugh stupid thing making me waste a dollar on only two heavy songs. I coulda easily got 3....but it's hard acing a song when your left arrow doesn't work. Ergh so yeah I did look a bit "poserish and white" *quoted from Dan* and basically wasn't the best time of my DDR playing there. By the time I was done that, got a lift from mom, and we also took Jason home.  After that though....ugh my mom seems to love applying the theory of "Chinese women driving on the sidewalk." Now this may sound stupid to some, but it pisses me off how I was right and yet she totally ignores it and thinks she's right. What happened was while going to fill up gas @ a station, she parks on the right side when our gas tank is on the left. So I thought it was smart to tell her to move to the left so we wouldn't be blocking the people that may want to use the other one....but NOOOOO she seems to think starting an argument with me about how I was wrong and dumber than a rock and how she was right seemed to be more efficient than moving the car to the left to avoid retarded stereotypes and make ourselves look stupid. So in the end she did all the gas filling by herself, and then while heading home....yeah she still didn't really get how it's wrong to clog two lanes to fill up one car at a gas station. She seeems to think the 20 ft. wide lane is meant for one car.  So getting home, after my dad heard about this issue, he also tried to tell her that it's wrong taking up 20 ft.+ of space to fill up a car. She didn't really get it still, and said that both of us were wrong and how there was no problem of her taking up two lanes. Apparently her theory is she's only there for 5 minutes so she can leave. Well at McDonald's an order takes 5 minutes it's not like I'm gonna clog business for an extra 10 minutes doing absolutely nothing. Anyways enough of this, basically she pretty much made part of my night crash and burn....but I don't really care. If she wants to make herself look like she doesn't know how to drive a car...by all means go for it. I REALLY don't care. Yeah I know I shouldn't be pissed off at my parents, well God said so at least, but honestly sometimes she's so ignorant. Also Lina brought up another point. It's SO true that parents seem to think we need all the advice love can buy us, but when WE give them advice, it's worth just as much as the recycled toilet paper at a Loblaws.  But other than that....yeah I loved my day today. Also packin' still tonight for 2morrow....church's annual May Camp retreat. We up at Cambridge this year. Wonder if calls to Toronto are local. If they are I could make a few lol. So yeah better be headin' to sleep now, and also packing. So final words....GO WATCH SHREK 2! Later =).

       5/20/04   Yay day two of Pig Dissection!   Aww crap I can't upload them at the moment since MyImgs.com apparently only lets you have a 5 day trial with a free account...so yeah I can't post up my gruesome pics of the dissection. But yeah final day of dissection was still amusing, despite the smell of preservatives and the decomposing of the pig. But ignoring that, the cutting up of the pig and exploring the insides of it was still as amusing as before =P. The rest of my day was also as usual as the other days, with another sub teacher since Whart is gone...and we'll ahve a different one next Tuesday. Yeah I know so many of them...  So this morning I woke up at usual time, got the usual things done like usual, and then headed out the door. Happy Calgary won last night...hope they face off with Tampa, since I really hate Philly. So going to school, I guess I was in a good mood...and like usual the music sucked. Got to school, and since I left late I headed to music class pretty quickly. Oh yeah and the T-Wolves won ^_^.  Music class today....we had Music Council elections! The videos like usual were really funny, and that pretty much took up the whole class. Whew avoided chromatic scales test ^_^. So anyways the people I voted for 2004-2005 were:  Secretary - Lindsay Brown $$$ people - Niki n' Caitlin VP - Helen Kneale the Co-P's - Christian and Geoffrey  Those are all the positions....right? Anyways those are the people I remember voting for. So after the elections, headed to class for last 5 minutes, and then 2nd period.  Science: two words. ASSIGNMENT WORK. Or Worked on Assignment, but that's three words. Anyways that's all we did for class, and then handed 'em in.  Lunch today went out with Nate, Fulmer, Duong, Chris and Pourier. Ended up going to Mr. Sub, which actually isn't too bad. In fact if I don't play ball tomorrow, I may head there for a lunch ^_^. It's actually better than Subway in a way I think. So ate there, walked back, and played the 30 seconds of ball I was there for and then the bell rang.  Bio class! Yay! Finished dissection! Today we had to look at the reproductive system and excratory system mostly. Also, we looked at the trachea, kidneys, and various other parts also. Oh yeah and today's gruesome part:  Breaking his jaw open.  That was probably the more interesting part of dissecting today. It wasn't as hard as cracking the ribs, but much more sound effects. I mean, just imagine someone shoving something to pry open your jaw, then two strong forces pulling them apart so wide, that you hear the cracking and dislocating of your lower jaw and the joint part. After that though it was all pretty easy cruising. I decided to take a few pics with my d-cam....ugh was so friggin' annoying since my batteries were on low so I had to be very conservative with what pics to take lol. Oh well in the end I got 5 pics....hopefully I can upload em one of these days... so finished that up, and then headed to english class.  English we got some year end assignment where we have to act out someone from a book we studied in the year, and also we finished watching Fried Green Tomatoes....well almost. 7 minutes or so left.  So headed home then...and while cutting through the park today...*crack.* My bag's strap broke AGAIN. Ugh this is the 2nd time...except this time the strap was intact, and the joining thingy broke. UGH.....this is why you:   NEVER BUY CHEAP DUFFEL BAGS FROM SOME BAG STORE IN THE EATONS CENTRE WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR CLOSING DAY SALE AND SELL YOU A BAG FOR 20 BUCKS!   Ugh it breaks in a matter of 2 months anyways....so I'm still stuck w/ same old same old. Also this shows that my average bag weight for school is over 20 pounds. Maybe the government should begin to give us less homework =P. Anyways when going to see Shrek 2 tomorrow I also gotta pick up a new bag >_  Got home....played some SC, balled, ate, slept....drank the remaining wine I opened the other day. Yeah....sparkling wine is good ^_^. And no I'm not a boozer, I just happen to like drinking wine after school....average amounts. Anyways, around 7 or so called up marcello to head to UCC for a bit.  Worked out and balled. My arms are slowly going back into ship shape as I could actually manage to bench 115 easily today.  Biceps are still kinda crummy, but abs and other stuff is goin' back to normal. Never will I go on that 4 month drought that put my muscles back into the stone age. So yeah gotta keep myself in shape now...since summer's coming too I have more time =). Also we balled a bit in the end....didn't do much since the courts actually had people today...and also Marcello and I just worked out so our shots were WAY off.  Got a lift back from him...and here I am now posting my blog. Think I'm gonna go eat now after chattin' w/ Niki and some other people on MSN.  Cya.

       5/19/04   How HK Are YOU?   I scored a  60%  on the "How Hong Kong Are You?" Quizie!  urlLink What about you?    Yup....got a bit bored after school so decided to take that little survey. Not much to talk about today...it was same old @ school...band,history,civics,math,and then programming. Yup...  So I got up at 6:20am today for band, and yes it was early. So ate, got dressed, usual morning stuff and then off to school I went. And the music isn't much better on the radio at 6:20am. Same crap that it plays any other time in London. So after 15 minutes of driving or so, got to school. Fred for some reason got to school in a Checker, which kinda surprised me. Not everyday you see a kid go to school in a checker limo.  Band was just a run through of all the songs through the year. Apparently next Friday we got a concert. Also, I have to play on the 26th @ Centennial with the rest of the Senior Band. For some reason though they have intermediate and 9er band playing next Friday. So we ran through pieces, and then left. Mr. Clark has officially lost my practice log, so I gotta find a way to record down all my practice dates now.  History....oh yeah today we didn't do much since we had elections for grade reps. Lots of people were running this year, so after careful deciding *two I already decided earlier and one random one* I decided to elect in Fred Wu, Amy Chick and Burke Adams. Meh...if it's anything like the previous reps nothing's gonna happen =P. Hmm...other reps I didn't really pay attention to, but yeah I think they did a good job with their speech. I Think. So when getting back up to our rooms, we just did research for our projects. Ugh gotta start my slideshow soon, plus study for civics, PLUS do the essay part of the project. Ugh so much work...least May Camp will clear my mind out for a day or two =P.  Civics....we studied/reviewed for our exam next Wednesday.  And for lunch. We were gonna go to Starbucks, but that changed when Starbucks I forgot they don't sell much food. So we went to McDonald's today. Some random old guy was talking to John, and some random lady was yelling down the street also. Yes downtown is kinda weird. Hmm.....Jason also came to lunch today, and after eating we all just walked back to school.  Math: reviewing for exam....and the test also. So today we did review Questions.  Programming: Helped move tables. And I'm done my turing program =). That's pretty much it...don't know what much else happened. Yeah...that's basically it.  Then got home....balled for a bit on Paul's old net, drummed, SC, h/w, and tonight watching the Calgary vs. San Jose game. Hopefully they win tonight, and if they don't well hopefully the road game trend continues, as that means Calgary will win =P.  Anyways....I'm off to eat now. Later.

       5/18/04   Pig Dissection Day!   The gruesome smell of preservatives....eew. But other than that....the rest was fun =P. Yup....fetal pig dissection day could not have been better lol. My group consisted of Ben, Melissa and Robert, but for some reason they wanted me to do most of the dissecting. So being me, I had the honours of doing the first cut ^_^ and afterwards Ben would help out a lot actually. But yeah....this is really making me want to be a surgeon...or something of that sort =P.  Before that though....starting with the top of my day....and slowly winding down to the end...  Morning went by as any other usual morning, except no senior band today =P.  Music was first class of the day. Sadly we don't have Mrs. Wharton once again as she has to go into surgery to repair a Hernia or somethin, so we are stuck yet with another sub teacher. Don't know his name yet, but he's missing two front teeth it looked like. Anyways today's music class sucked....we did scales major and minor, and since I already know all of them from top to bottom.....ugh it was lame. He said he wouldn't teach us any way new to learn the sharps and flats, but in the end he did anyways....what a waste of time. So helped Niki with her stuff, since she seemed to not get this...nor did I understand this teacher's system of remembering stuff. Anyways didn't like the teacher much....sub teachers are pretty lame.  And onto science class. Did some stupid assignment which I have to finish tomorrow.  Lunch....went to Galleria....had a sub, then walked back to school  Bio.....like I said before was fun. Pig dissection was very amusing, though the preservatives did smell. Also Robert was being a retard trying to open the pig's mouth and eyes...though it's dead. I had my share of the fun cutting up the pig, and cracking the rib cage. That's gotta be the worst part about dissecting. The point where you have to take a pair of scissors, and then break through the ribcage by splitting it right down the middle....yeah that was pretty gruesome. Or the first time you open up the pig...and bile spews out...yeah I was kinda surprised that happened since well...usually dissections for schools don't have juices coming out of it. But after that one scare nothing else really happened that scared me. Other gruesome part had to be seperating the cage from the muscles and tendons keeping it stuck to the organs and skin. Ben got to cut that while I had to hold it....yeah dissecting is fun. I can't wait until next year =)....gr. 12 I heard you get to cut up a full sheep.  English class we started watching FGT movie. Not amusing...the movie really sucks personally I think because they leave out so much stuff. So that was the basic outline of english class. Not much work as we are nearing end of the year.  Bused home with Dan and Elaina, and then walked home through the tracks and got home around.....330ish? From then until 730 basically I slept....originally I was gonna go work out with Marcello but he's still kinda sick so I just decided to nap instead.  *4 hours later*  Woke up, ate, played some ball at Paul's old place and then SCed for a bit. Math h/w's done, and I'm gonna now shower and head to sleep. Got band still tomorrow. Later.

       5/16/04   UCC Balling....Yup....   Hmm.......so pretty athletic Sunday. Even though it got off to somewhat of a rocky start, the end result of today was pretty interesting. I for one didn't really mind it, and in the end enjoyed it like any other Sunday. It's cool how God can always make a crappy day somehow turn out good in the end. He seems to make everything right always....no matter how wrong life can look at times.  So starting my day wakin' up at 730am, I quickly ate, did usual morning stuff and then headed to church, all ready and such for Sunday Morning Worship practice. Got there a bit late....and already I thought "Ok we gotta start this now." HOWEVER, yes....I still had to fix up Slide Show Presentation to fit with the order....something I believe Josh shoulda stayed online for last night instead of sleeping. And then afterwards, yup Steph wasn't b/sing when she said last night no trombone today. So yeah...basically I wasted 40 minutes of my morning doing jack, however harsh sounding this is but yeah I myself felt that worship this morning was not what any of us hoped for. The fact that all the songs no one knew, and low rehearsal time also added to this, making today like I said before not one to be remembered for effort. So Josh, Rebecca, Steph, if this seems a bit harsh, well it's true. I actually felt this way....and there's not really anything that can change history now. So when worship started...yeah I didn't pay much attention since I barely do anything today anyways....so I might as well had slept in 50 minutes and not even bothered going there early. All I had to really do is get the Slide Show in order...something that should have been done the night before.  Sermon today unfortunately still had abit of aftermath from the earlier things, so I didn't really pay attention, and used the time more for reflection....on things like "how did we even think of doing worship this week?" or "Why did we put forth only 60% instead of 100% of our time into this?" Maybe the others don't feel the same way as I did....but it's pretty crappy hearing Josh say he needs his sleep when I myself only got 6 hours....because I didn't know what the heck I was doing for the whole time while making Presentation. Oh well...so yeah before I knew it service was over....apparently thinking can make time go by REAL quick.  So after service, I went downstairs as usual. By now I felt that I had no need to be angry anymore at the events of the morning, so I went about with my day, and I felt more relaxed and not as peeved as the day went by. So first off with Bible Study, we had a guest Jason Perry come in today. He tought us a different way to do Bible reading (I normally do the Lectio Divini way...spelling?) But he tought us the AEIOU way:  Ask Questions Enunciate (emphasize some words) In Your Own Words Other References Use it  I guess it's a somewhat interesting way...and it never hurts to learn new formats of doing devos/ just regular Bible reading. Also with Jason being an undergrad psychologist...yeah when me Gavin and Rebecca thought we knew what the passages meant...he could ask the most simple question...."Why?" and we were all stumped lol. Oh yeah and Rebecca burned Carmen and Lina today pretty bad too lol. Basically calling the two blondes/ditzes....Oh boy lol.....never thought Rebecca could pull a burn like that lol. So me and Gavin afterwards branched out from the burn, and yeah that was talk of the town for a bit haha. Oh yeah and the thinking of how Carmen and Lina could actually figure out a Bible study together LOL. I know its ounds kinda mean but after Rebecca made that Brulee....yeah me and Gavin went overboard on the burnages lol. Oh yeah and also I made smiley faces on Rebecca's shoes =P. After the lesson *and brulees*, Calvin, Jason, and Gavin came to my place...  Where we ate Dim Sum, played some PS2, and then headed out for ball. PS2 was pretty funny......and oh yeah I switched Jason's MSN name...which he recovered but when he saw it *quote*:  "DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO WRITE THAT NAME OUT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"  Thank goodness he has message history lol. Anyways......after fixing that *I think* and whooping some ass on NFSU, BALLING TIME!  Basically for two hours....we played basketball. some 3's, 4's, and 2's almost at a time but then eventually turned into 3's lol. Kendrick and Thomas came for a bit also....and also playing 4 on 4 full court....lol it turns to be as exciting as golf after a while. Ugh....I need to work on my driving again....get stuffed almost everytime I go for layup....except for the one good time where I actually completed a decent crossover and finished also. My defense is actually somewhat tolerable now, though I need to work on stuffing still, but man to man coverage I'm getting decent at now again...well when I actually try to do defense lol *this isn't including our one on one games where a pylon is more effective than me Jason.* Anyways....so after two hours of that, headed home....pretty tired...and my feet hurt also heh.  Played some NSFU again until they left, then SCed for a bit. Showered, ate, then did my cosine law math homework. Ugh so stupid.....and now I've forgotten Sine law lol.  So....as you can see my day turned out decent. I think God put those laughs in today for a reason, as they really did cheer up my day from the sluggish morning start. Anyways...I'm out for the night...and yeah Thanks again God for lighting up my day =).  Oh yeah and Jason found his 3cm cockroach/ant....well w/e it is anyways lol. Hopin' to see it on Friday when I go over haha.  Later.

       5/15/04   HYPE: Yes back to its usual fellowship =P   Before anything else...I'd first like to congratulate my neighbour Scott Yaeck on gettin' married. Seems like yesterday when I moved in and he towered over me. But gettin' back to the main point....yeah congrats on gettin married =P.  So yeah as you can tell, today my neighbour got married....well actually his son Scott did. Point is someone got married to someone. That was just one of the many things that actually happened today....and my weekends seem to be pretty jumbled now. But yet they are fun....and I love livin' every minute of it....so starting off with my awakening from my 10 hour slumber....  I awoke at 1040am after a 10 hour sleep or so, and preceded to head downstairs to examine the carbon-based foods set forth on my plate that my cornea within my eyes are now locked on (LOOK AT THOSE BIG WORDS!) So after eating sometin, I then went to practice some piano before going to my lesson, along with talkin' to Jason about playin' ball at UCC today. Mornin' went by quickly, as before I knew it, it was already 12:30, and I had to rush to my piano lesson.  So in piano today, we were going to run through some pieces, until I opened my big mouth and said I have some pieces for school where I'm accompiniament for other people. After that, she then said "GREAT WE CAN DO SIGHT READING!" *shudder* The thing I hate most about any music. Sight Reading. Sounds so bad and makes you look bad....so we did that for 30 minutes, but it was good the fact that I now know my pieces better =P. So after 30 minutes, mom then came to pick me up, and off to UCC I went.  For the next 2 hours, I'd play ball with Jason. 1-on-1 I got owned...mostly because my shots ALWAYS short now that I changed my form for shooting, and also because I got lazy on defense lol. Beat him in 21 though =P. After 2 hours though we got bored, so then went and got a lift from dad back to my place.  Back here.....played some PS2, ate food, compy, and stuff. Hmm.....waited for mom to get back then her, dad and me went over to the Yaeck's to congratulate them. Eventually though I was only over there for 15 minutes as I had to then go back home, eat, and then head out for HYPE. Mom got back at 5pm instead of target time of 330pm so yeah.......we got there REAL late lol. But after playing some NSFU on PS2, me and Jason then quickly ate somethin', grabbed two Cokes and then headed out to Carmen's place for HYPE.  Today joining us was Vincent...who has happily volunteered to aid in helping HYPE for the summer....or aka aid in keeping us crazy HYPE kids below "insanely hyper." So today we did a bible study on Wisdom in relationships instead of improv night. Good lesson though nevertheless, with lots of talk about our friendships with one another. Pretty funny  though, me and Dan kept going back to the burns and punching/shoving into lockers as our usual greetings. And also was funny to watch Dan get soaked by Carmen's water tap. See her house is pretty high tech lookin', and handle for the tap looked like a soap dispenser, but when he turned it on WHOOSH! lots of water came out lol. Umm so after the study...which I was in the group w/ Dan, BW and Vincent, we ended in closing prayer *by moi* and then lounged around for a bit.  Then after all other groups were done...we went upstairs for food. LOL so many jokes popped up from this. Examples include Calvin's bragging about how he can turn his hat 360 degrees on his head without use of his hands *he twiches his head like 1000 times* or Josh's comments on White forks....yeah racism towards forks LOL. Too many to count...or the vector joke *Jason, Gavin, Calvin we can all clearly remember that right lol* and of course the "I'M THE WHITE LARRY BIRD" joke from Family Guy. Jason was rolling around on the floor for at least 5 minutes after that. Well if not ROFLing then LWHOT *Laughing w/ Head on Table.* Oh yeah and Calvin reffering to a Chicken Nugget as a Samurai....Vincent had to clearly state that a Samurai is a person....not processed chicken meat with breading. After the food fest though, we headed downstairs and watched the Chinese movie.....which was really depressing. She has the same cell phone as me though lol. Anywho dad came, picked up me Jason and Lina and headed home....taking them home first.  So last hour been spent MSNing, making Slide Show Presentation for Church and....dreaming of a band with Gerty and Joy lol. TLC Joy ahahahhaha....can't wait till that happens lol. Ergh pretty tired right now though...but pretty fun day overall. HYPE has gotta be one of the best meetings ever....yeah life would be pretty drab without Calvin coming up with another intelligent "talent." Oh yeah and somehow me and Lina said 3 things in  row that were almost the same....it all started with another cheesy burn by me....but for once not about a face. So both of us went "NO WAY A NON-FACE BURN!" then "GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE!" Lol somehow we both said that at the same time haha. That pretty much sums up my day I think.....hmm yeah lots of laughs for today. No harm done though....laughing and happiness only increases your life span =P.  Cya.

       What a day...   Social Justice. As quoted by one of the people (something around the words of this) is "people taking action to social issues." Something like that anyways. I for myself, found it somewhat interesting hearing the biased thoughts of many intellectual humans speaking out against various things like Coca-Cola, the War in Iraq, Corporate Capitalism and many other issues. Obviously there were some issues I didn't agree with, but there's the pros and cons of everything in life isn't there? So today was spent much attending seminars (mine were mostly about the wars and conflict issues around the world), eating pizza @ Pizza Hut and coming home. Of course afterwards worship practice also....which we REALLY need to work on =P. Meh beats the more boring days of life though....i'd give this day a 7/10 probably....past mediocre but below GING AH!  My day started off at a healthy 730 once again today...morning went by quick since all I had to bring to school was a cell phone and my wallet. No classes today....since I went to SJN Now! meeting. So got to school around 805, sat around outside for a bit, and then bus boarding we went. I sat with Mophead to and from Althouse, and talked about random crap. Also talked to some other people also, but ride isn't that long to Althouse from Central Secondary School so in a matter of 10 minutes (we ain't exactly going across sometin like Metro Toronto) we arrived at the College by around......9ish? Retarded part was I had to go back to school anyways after the conference....even though I live only like....10 mins away. Come to think about it I shoulda just missed the bus and walked lol. Oh well.....anyways we got in, sat around in the auditorium, and then the conference started.  We started with a video, and then some people gave speeches. I kinda fell asleep slowly, but we were all dismissed for our seminars just in time, so no I didn't catch any shut-eye yet. Anyways....to my first seminar: War and Empire...  Hmm the speaker....Craig Simpson or sometin like that was talking about how USA spends way too much time on helping other countries, when their country is suffering enough. He actually came up with a very good point: with the $$$ USA spends on their 11 carrier battle groups (consisting usually of a aircraft carrier, 2 cruisers, 3 destroyers, and two subs, plus various other frigates and minesweepers), if they didn't spend it all on those 11 carrier battle groups, they could have probably solved their poverty issues by now. Plus....the money that Pentagon uses (which by the way they can use as much as they want) they could probably give Americans free health-care. Other things he touched up on include the 770+ bases that America now has around the world, plus the over 1100 bases in USA....all that money can do just WAAAY to much than can be mentioned. Basically....USA needs to learn how to spend their budget and also stay out of another country's issues. For example...also....America has never had any success in establishing governments. El Salvador, Cuba, Rwanda, and a host of other places. Bottom line: USA, stay out of another country's issues...and learn how to establish a democracy.  Seminar #2: Canada: a Peacekeeping Nation or Imperialist Country?  Now by the end of the seminar I still don't know where the dude stands....but my opinion is he was more towards peacekeeping, which I agree. However, Canada also does become imperialist sometimes, with capitalizing other countries with our banks, and also only helping those countries that may benefit our nation in return. Total human nature I know....the idea of helping and getting something in return...but we as people should really change that to God's image of helping everyone, regardless of getting anything in return or not. I really liked the 2nd one more as we had more discussion also, and...yeah I really enjoyed myself =).  LUNCHTIME! While walkin' in the halls....saw the Motorola T720's deficiency and how I'm happy I listened to the dude that I was gettin' cell phone from. Apparently T720 really does have crap receptio lol. Brittany Lockhart was right by the window on main floor and no reception sadly haha. Anywho, went to Pizza Hut with Hammond, where eventually we met up with Mophead there. Frederick would also be there, plus a whole host of other people. Mmmm....pizza. Pizza Hut so good. Well their slices are pretty good anyways, and we also bought a medium pizza and split it lol. Hey well worth it...more food than I'd get at Subway for the money I spent...only around 5 bucks =P. And I got....4 slices of pizza =P. Plus two cans of pop lol.  And we then went back for some guy talking about how his life got torn apart by Monsanto...the biotechnology corp. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in it...so I actually slept for 30 minutes, before Meg Tanner poked me, waking me up. Just in time though, since we had to go lol. So busing back to school, went to the music room to see when I'd get my practice log back, and John made a few burns to Mrs. Wharton lol.  "Hey Mrs. Wharton when are you going to get back from your surgery? Tell me when so I can start punching you in the gut again"  or:  "Hey Mrs. Wharton...while you're getting your hernia fixed think they'll give you a new pair of legs also?"  She's short...so get it now? lol. That one caused her to throw stuff at John though lol. Anyways after that, gave John a lift back, then I went home and immediately went for some sleep.  *Two hours later....actually more like 3*  Woke up, ate, got dressed, and headed for church. Though I was a bit late, we still got a few things done. I'm doing the presentation for Sunday, plus it'll be my premier on trombone I think =). Hmm....so we got some rehearsal done, and we still meetin' up Sunday mornin' @ 8:15am to finish it up. Then we finished, and I got home.  Yup....that pretty much sums up my 7/10 day. Maybe 7.5/10. It was pretty good though....and I'm once again looking forward to the next day =). Anywho I'm gonna go do something more productive than bloggin....like sleep or SC =).  Oh yes...and....   HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY JOY!  Lol....yeah bit past May 12th...but still wishin' ya a happy sweet....16?? I think =S. Well hope I'm right anyways haha...only 5 more months till I'm that old.  Later everyone.

       5/13/04   Senior Music Night: Wow.   WHAT LONG DAY IT HAS BEEN! Oi.....starting with a friggin phone call at 7am and lasting until 1130pm+...yeah I'm runnin' on overdrive as we speak. But it has been a fun day....sorta....but the night was insanely long. So right now pretty tired...but I will still push forth and complete this post =P.  My day started off somewhat retarded this morning. I normally sleep to 730...but was awoken by a phone call at 7am? Who would call at such an outrageous time I thought only Patrick could calling in saying he couldn't go to school or something....but no it wasn't. Nor was it a relative from HK or sometin. It was Robert Michelak asking to borrow DDR. Did I let him borrow it? Uhh.....wake ME up at 730am....I THINK NOT. So therefore....he never got DDR from me =P. Well now that I've been awaken from my slumber....I reluctantly....and angrily got out of bed....stomping down the stairs....and nearly falling out of my chair when sitting down to eat. Yeah my balance is VERY poor at 7am. So ate breakfast, did usual morning routine *earlier than usual* and then tried to kill sometime...played the piano mostly....and then headed out to school at around 745am or so. Yeah my steam wasn't totally blown away yet...and I was still pretty peeved in the car. Yeah...waking me up from my sleep is one of the very few things that I can't tolerate...besides hypocrites, bling bling gangstas, and people that put the definition of "cocky" to a whole new level. See? VERY few things =P.  I got to school 'bout 805ish and pretty much headed straight to history. Chatted with Ryan and Milosz a bit, and then up I went to history class....where today we would head to the library to do research....  As said....we went and did research. What I'm doing for the research: Canadian economy in the 90's. Bottom line: It was mediocre. With many ups and downs, and gas prices that are more ridiculous than tye dye t-shirts. Also our dollar has sucked over the last 10 years. Wonder what happened to make it plummet from 95 cents to 67....and then back up to 74. So researched for 75 minutes on our economy....and that was pretty much it. Me and Hailey couldn't really figure out this one person's name in our group. Yeah I know kinda sad....but it happens I guess *shrug.*  Civics: we started debates today. Hmm....so difficult to come up with pros for an issue you are always against *i.e. Same Sex Marriage* Unfortunately I had to support this issue being the "government," BUT IT'S SO HARD. Lol but nothing was as bad as Quinn....he was on the government side and said a statement supporting opposition lol. Debates were kinda fun though....I made a remark, but it was a crappy one. Got rebutted pretty effectively *shudder.* For abortion though, I was whooping some ass =P. Being against abortion is easy...as one big point always is that you are murdering a child....though it is unborn but it still does have life. Anywho....since it's an assembly day... classes were shortened, so by 1025 we were out and down in the auditorium for the student council elections....er more of speeches to make you vote for him/her.  Assembly was kinda boring....wansn't as good as last year's but I'm not surprised since each candidate had a $50 limit on campaigning. Apparently last year the president spent over $300 on his campaign....and I'm not surprised he got elected =P. Today though I liked some of the speeches that were put out. Though I sorta knew who I was voting for in the beginning, but it was still pretty cool seeing the different personalities of each person going up and saying what they had to say. President, Treasurer, and Vice was pretty much default...with the people that won it giving acceptance speeches instead of "voting for them" speeches. Oh yeah....and of course I can't forget the trailer for Phrinj Movie night. "Nitrogen is a common earth element" is the movie they showed, which is a spin-off of a 007 film. That got my attention though...so I'm definitely going to go see movie night next monday =P. So after that short assembly, headed back to class to vote. And this is who I voted for (don't shoot me please):  Minister of Communications: Tehmina  The two social directors or w/e: Melissa and Teefy  Yup....that pretty much sums up my morning....preetty boring I know...but at least tomorrow....my morning will be at the Social Justice Now conference...WHOO NO SCHOOL =p.  Lunch headed out to Jasper's today. Mmm....Chicken quesadilla and caesar salad. All for the somewhat expensive price of $6.50 (includin' a root beer.) Ate, talked about random crap....hmm can't remember much else...for some reason today everyone noticed I got new glasses...Got a haircut yesterday maybe that did sometin =S. Anywho point is ate lunch and left and talked also (not in any particular order.) Oh yeah....JASPER'S HAS ICED CAPPUCHINOS! I just found that out today =P.  Math class....finished cosine law....and really there's only about 4 more classes of math before review *sweet!* So did questions, chatted for a bit....and then programming class came along.  Programming: ALMOST DONE MY 007 ANIMATION! Only a few more lines of programming....and I should be done =P. Right now it's pretty good....I like it anyways lol. So almost done that...and today we also did some spreadsheet stuff. Final evaluation...NO EXAM! SHWEET!  FINALLY school's over. Bused home w/ Ryan and Dominik, and then got home around....330 ish? Anyways point is....got home, ate, went on compy for a bit then slept until 6pm where then I had to get up for music night...  *few hours later*  Yup, after a stomach-upsetting dinner, and a lift where I was drinkin' some tea to wake me up....SENIOR MUSIC NIGHT. Ugh I played horrifically tonight, but point is the band still sounded good...along with the other ensembles =). 4 hours of pure senior music. I didn't mind it...in fact I enjoyed much of it. Though I had a bit of an upset stomach, but after a word of prayer....and just complaining in my head....it wasn't much of a bother after a while. Jazz band was amazing like usual....but the best part of tonight HAD to be the song that goes with the movie "Nitrogen is a Common Earth Element." LOL it was EXACTLY like an actual 007 movie theme song....and was written by none other...than the infamous Dave Rutt =P. Lol hilarious song though....you know a song's gonna be a hit single when it's a song about Nitrogen. Hysterical though....and then after that we went on with the rest of our program. Choir *shudder* and some other ensembles....and to close it off was us...the senior band. Ugh stupid cell phone....I accidentally left it on vibrate during intermission....well I think I did I doubt Maisie even could figure out how....and was so annoying throughout performance when my parents for some reason called me 10 times. If I don't answer it the first time....I WON'T ANSWER IT THE 10TH TIME! It's like charades....  "IF THE ANSWER'S NOT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME DAMNIT IT'S NOT RIGHT THE 2ND OR 3RD TIME!"         -Stewie Griffin  Yes a family guy quote....but I really agree with it lol. Well eventually the night did end....with the senior band *the one I'm in* ending off the night with "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night," "Godzilla attacks Las Vegas," and "Vesuvius." Great pieces, and if you wanna hear us play Vesuvius....go to the "Stars of the Festival" concert on May 26th @ Centennial Hall. Out of 20 performances, 11 are from Central =).  Anyways....Mophead gave me a lift back home....and here I am now, an hour later @ 1225am....technically Friday Morning posting up this blog. Chatted with Jenn, Peggy, Vikki and some other TCers and people on MSN for a bit...and now I say "Au Revoir."  Au Revoir.

       5/11/04   Another lazy day   Brain...slowly.......changing.....to.....summer mode.  Ugh my mind's functions are slowly detereorating from school mode now. I can barely think these last few days, and sleep is becoming more and more needed. But to think.......11 more day 1's and 11 more day 2's and school's over. Well exams but then school's over. Exams are a breeze anyways. Ergh....but this is when intense schoolage happens. Like today....  Senior band..we got music night on Thursday and Intermediates tomorrow. I just hope we sound good. This morning we had a 1.5 hour rehearsal, though it was a late start day, but regardless I still had to be at school by 730am. Argh.....so early...but it's worth it for senior band I think sometimes. Sound so much better than intermediate....and much more productive. So we ran through pieces this morning, and got out at 910, just before class started *late start day.* Oh yes and of course...morning routine before going to school hehe forgot to mention but yes it did occur =P.  History class......Ms. Manson had to go to a track meet so she quickly assigned us to our groups for the final year end group project, and then left. Hmm....well I'm doing present day Canadian Economics. Wow....our dollar sucks and gas prices make buses look more and more appealing each day. I mean subway is self explanitory to look good......but BUSES?! AND LONDON BUSES!? *shudder.* Stupid gas prices. Hmm...my group pretty much is people I've never worked with, so can't really say much about them. Maisie's with....uhh....some other group? lol. Hmm...so yeah not much in history. Chose groups and then bell rang...  Civics class: We didn't do anything for first half with no teacher, but Mr. Baldwin eventually came in after realizing he had an on-call. Actually he was pretty funny today...had some good jokes that made most of the class crack up. Then he left....and another teacher came in *Mr. Brown?* or sometin like that. We did more debating....I didn't talk much *GASP* and just sat there reading the proposed bills each class made for civics. Hmm....Marijuana legalization, Same Sex Marriage, Euthanasia, and some other ones. *Shrug* easy debating issues I find. Oh well....but that's for next day. For now....  LUNCH! Jasper's...had some sorta pasta that cost me 5 bucks. Just found out Mophead's meal everyday would normally cost 4 bucks for me....and it is a lot more filling. But Alfredo pasta is SOOOO good... Ugh descisions descisions.  Beats BK though where every burger just looks like a different form of grease =P.  Ok summarizing rest of my day:  Math Programming Home.  Yup...that's pretty much it. Use your imagination to fill them in. I'll help with a few things though. Example A: While I was doing science h/w today, I had to go outside and stare at my garden and somehow manage to make up and ecosystem. While doing this process...a bumble bee comes by...and for anyone that doesn't know me I HATE BEES. So seeing it....and it approaching closer and closer I turn and flee....eventually hiding behind my minivan in hopes the bumblebee is out of my testing area for lifeforms. After doing that....I ran inside then....and finished my project behind a window. Event B: Played ball w/ Patrick for a bit....I WON! HAH! Oh yes and also no drumsticks at the moment as for some reason they've gone missing.  Anywho.....use your imagination for the rest. Studyin' for bio then I'm out.  By the way Jenn.....REAL sorry to hear your blog went BOKAN! to the extreme. Mine kinda did...but I'm salvaging what i can =S. Ugh shoulda listened to Jason. Yet again he is right in life *shakes fist.*  Later.

       5/10/04   May 10th: Marking the final month of school   Yup.....this is really the home stretch...only I think 10 more classes of each day 1 and 2 and then it's exams.....and then I'm done Gr. 10....well I doubt I'll fail it. Right now where I stand it's impossible for me to fail any class =P. So I'm not really worrying....and stress levels are at an all time low *whoo!* So yeah right now life's good with theory done, slowin' down on piano since exam ain't for another 7 months or so, and school's almost over. HOME STRETCH!!!!!!  Woke up at 730 this morning for school. I'm feelin' a lot better now compared to other days as I'm not as sick, and I felt a lot better with my new prescription glasses today and didn't feel like I was going to puke. So headed downstairs after doin' morning routine, ate, packed my bags and then left for school...  Finally getting to school around 810 or so, I quickly tread to music class since the bell was going to ring in 5. So got ready for music and stuff, Arjun has figured out the accompinament for my trombone solo which is good news. Hehe I didn't really start practicing Niki's or Kelsey's until today.....gotta make it good so they don't kill me if I suck lol. So today in music class some woman came in to sub for Wharton since they didn't get back from NYC until 2am, but unfortunately this teacher doesn't know jack about music. So me and Amy in the end begun conducting the class, which wasn't exactly the greatest thing in the world but hey we managed to get some work done lol. And then for rep I played Bradburn's sax parts.....so yeah wasn't a productive class...who cares though we need one of those every once in a while =P.  Science....we have a lab due for Wednesday that's about looking at our front lawn, and then we also watched some lame video. VERY boring stuff. Science never really gets better....just worse (ie we don't get to go to Zoo like the other classes =@).  Lunch: Mike, John and I headed down to Galleria where I got that breakfast thing from International Soups like usual if I go to Galleria. Ate that, talked for a bit, NYC apparently whooped ass according to John. Ugh now I REALLY regret I didn't join senior band earlier lol. Oh well...least I get to go next year.....and the year after if I decide to take music in gr. 12 also =P. So after lunch.....ugh the wonderful world of Biology...where we are learning taxonomy and finishing up the respiratory system.  Bio class started REALLY slow for me as I was sleeping for first half. Then we did our respiratory lab....where I found out my lung capacity really sucks lol, and then started taxonomy. My way of remembering the different classification names:  King Phillip Can Order Farm Grown Straberries Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species  Brilliant eh?! Lol....apparently much of the class likes my little creation there haha. Took up a sheet of fill in the blanks, and stuff....didn't really do much but the lab was fun. Got to run around the hallways to see how much breathing I need after running.  English: We did these stupid FGT Questions.  And then Stage Band X Practice. Last practice of the year for us before our big Spring Concert. It was a good run through of the songs, and pretty funny when Dave Rutt was conducting w/ his trombone haha. Hmm...what else happened I don't know...we ran through music, and stuff....and Mrs. Wharton approved my solo piece for year end assignment. Not much else I don't think....*shrug*  And heading home. Hmm since I had to wait for bus, I read a bit of Purpose Driven Life while waiting. Also, while waiting at my bus stop today though....I thought I saw a person from LCAC. Problem is though...  I don't know who it is. I know she goes to my church.....but I've never talked to her, or even tried to meet her. I guess it's kinda weird how I barely even know the person, but not until like a week ago did I even know she's in gr. 12. She's in the Chinese congregation, and this just shows how seperated the English ministry can be from Chinese. I really hope that changes though, as it did feel kinda weird....like the feeling of "OH I KNOW THEM.....wait do I?" Hmm....never really thought of it as a prayer request sorta thing....but I would really like to see more church unity between the two congregations. Felt so weird seeing a fellow church member walk by, yet I can't even say hi since I don't even know who she is.  Well anyways.....bused home....just got home before rain started pouring. HOLY CRAP it was a friggin' monsoon here for most of the afternoon. Hail, rain, Lightning, etc. Rain got so heavy at a time while playing SC that I couldn't even see out of my window. Pissed me off too since my compy shut down twice because of power surges *ugh.* That then made me restart my compy, and also downed my uptime for my comp. Oh well....anyways after stable power was back, I played a bit of RollerCoaster Tycoon for some reason, and then some SC where I whooped some ass along w/ Jason and some other random people on Bnet.  So did that for abit, then drummed, dinner, showered, and some other stuff in no particular order. Hmm.....Flyers won tonight I think....well 5-0 by 2nd period says something...and I'm now gonna head to sleep. Whee late start day tomorrow. Too bad I have band....but at least it's still an hour later =P.  Cya.

       5/9/04   Happy Mother's Day!   HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO EVERYONE!  Now that that's outta my system....well to the other parts of my day =P. It was typical Sunday I guess + some other things occuring....like today I got a new pair of glasses to replace the pair I broke on Friday =P. YAY I'M NOT BLIND NO MORE! Lol. Other than that it was usual SC, h/w, and MSN. Argh my life seems more drab as it goes by during the school year. Ugh hurry up and come faster.....Stupid June *shakes fist.* Thinks it's so great hiding behind May.......waaaaargh! Anyways though enough about rambling about how June's hiding....  I awoke this morning to the sound of cheesy radio music emitting from the radio downstairs. Ugh stupid 101.3......the channel that everyone over 40 seems to enjoy. Argh....so forcing myself out of bed....I finally get out, head downstairs, and you know the usual routine by now after 108 entries. So after doing all that, I pick up my bag, and head for the car. Only had to drive to Lina's today since Carmen was giving Jason a lift. So left a bit later, picked up Lina, and then headed for church...  At church today....we did what a church should do I believe.....have a Mother's Day service =P. Yeah today's service talked about how moms have done so much for us in the past, and how we should honour them *and of course our fathers.* It's a good reminder. Repetitive things can benefit on the occassion..and this is one of them. So today during service being half blind wasn't TOO bad. Got a seat in front row....but did the slide shifting which isn't smart when you don't have glasses since I can barely see the words lol. Service also started late because Gavin snapped a guitar string, but things went underway pretty quickly after gettin' that fixed. So service today was rotating around mother's day... and it went by fairly quickly today. After service though....wow most Anti-Gavin guitar bashing I've ever heard courtesy of Victor and Vince lol.  "GEEZ LEARN A BETTER STRUM PATTERN" "PLAY SOMETHING OUT OF G" "YOU KNOW GUITAR'S HAVE MORE MUSIC VARIETY THAN THAT" "YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR STRUM PATTERN IS? THE OASIS PATTERN!"  So while being bashed by these "critics," I went on putting away the projector and stuff, while Gavin was packing his things and simultaneously being ridiculed by the Fung brothers lol. Then we headed downstairs and ate some stuff before class started...  Class consisted of finishing up book of Jonah. First thing Pastor Dale asked us was what we think is a "right" form of anger. After using the example of Jesus getting mad at the merchants selling stuff in front of the church *as the church is a place of worship....not to sell stuff* we then went on about our personal ones. I said hypocrites....and then went on about the theory of how lots of people think they're so "ghetto" when the silver chain they have around their neck is worth more than a house block in say......Harlem. "Ghetto gangstas" for sure...lol makes me laugh though when I see FOB gangstas lmao. Lol gangstas with the poorest command of english I've seen in my life lol. Funny stuff....especially at Pac Mall seeing them lol. Anyways.....Vince and Victor went on with the "Gavin sucks on guitar" routine and the other came up with their own things. Anyways we finished the book after some discussion, and then communion. Then we got home.  Home......hmm today went to get glasses after lunch, came back for some SC, then went back out to pick them up....then more SC lol. After that though sat around for a bit, drummed, ate, talked to Jenn and some others on MSN for a bit....and then did the most weird thing I've done in a while:  Internet games. Somehow me, Lina and Jason got hooked on Yahoo! Pool lol. So played that for over an hour, with dinner, and fiddling with my new cell phone......and stuff. Ugh my eyes are killin' me though now....new prescription for new glasses I still gotta get used to. Oh yeah and some InkLink with Lina earlier before Pool lol. Anyways though...  I'm out for the nite.  Later.

       5/8/04   A productive day in the T-Dot   Hmm.....yeah well though I probably don't know most of your mothers, but it is mother's day, so therefore....have a good one =P. I for myself had a pretty good day, beginning with a theory exam. Not the best beginning, but things would hit a climax when I got my cell phone lol. So here's my short, somewhat summarized entry on they day before Mother's Day.  I woke up at 830....and realizing I woke up later than expected I rushed around the house, crammed the very final few minutes I could and then ran out the door, multitasking of cramming, drinking tea and listening to music. So finally rushing to the Social Sciences centre, I run up the stairs, make a few complicated turns *all this is without my glasses so I can barely see signs since my glasses broke* and then FINALLY.....I manage....out of the bluriness of 4.0 poor eye sight........I FIND ROOM 2028.....  And I walk in thinking I'm late....and quickly rush for a place to sit. However.....hmm I have no paper. That was when people began to direct me around places.....making me look like a dumbass. Wasn't too bad though....it was my "big" entry into the theory class.....confused, distorted, and VERY dazed about what is happening and yes I realize those words all pretty much mean the same thing. Waking up 30 minutes before my exam though, yes things like that can happen. So after finally managing to find my stuff, and get myself settled.... I pull out my gargantuan clock that I brought in for time, and set out my writing utensils and stuff and then prepared to write my exam....  Writing away, I start off writing out the words as I tend to forget many of them. Unfortuantely I blanked out on two, but meh that only puts me down to a 98 for a highest mark. Grr that lessens my chance of getting my trip to Pizza Hut though. So while writing, I decided to take a break halfway through since I had two hours to write it. So started having a thumb war between my left and right hand *It's REALLY boring in there* and made a makeshift drumset for pencils out of erasers my pencil case and other various objects I found in my pencil case. Checking over the test a few times then, staring into the ceiling, and trying to see how blind I really was took up most of the remaining time then....and before I knew it time was up. Wow.....celing staring is very efficient to waste time apparently.  After the exam, quickly ran out the door excited about going to Toronto. Though it tends to be drab at times walking around the same stupid FOB mall everytime, every once in a while something interesting may occur. So anyways got picked up, then picked up one of mom's friends and then we headed out to Toronto....first stopping by a McD's for some lunch and then on the highway. While on the highway, talked for a bit, mostly about my plans of making a bridge to stretch from HK to Vancouver for easy driving access between the two cities, ate, and after feeling full from a good grease platter I decided to sleep the rest of the way.... ahh yes sleep my favourite part of a car ride...  *3 hours later*  FINALLY arriving in Toronto, we first go grab some dim sum in that restaurant in Pacific Mall. With nothing better to do while waiting for the food, I tried to expand my readable chinese knowledge to two words. I usually do this since what's there to do that's more productive....and for some reason I like to read the names of Dim Sum lol. Plus it prepares me for the future when I have to order Dim Sum on my own *omg what a lame excuse but valid =P.* Shut up if it isn't. So after food came, quickly my family dived into the food.....and after 45 miutes of eating.....got the bill and left.  So while mom went to buy stuff and grandma went to get her haircut, me and my dad walked around the mall looking at cell phones at random FOB cellphones store. Then we passed a Rogers Wireless store. Then we thought "hey why not get a cell out here?" So I finally got my cell phone, going through all the paperwork and stuff when all of a sudden.....BRLLIANCE OF PUTTING TWO HEADS TOGETHER! We could get mom a mother's day gift! WHOO IDEA GOES THROUGH! So in the end we got some family plan, and activated my Motorola C370 or sometin like that and Mom's LG *eew I hate LG phones.* Then after getting everything set, we go and give mom her Mother's Day gift...and head to dinner.  Dinner: Basically ate at Richmond court then went home. I had some baked chicken thing with fried rice and a coke w/ ice cream thing. It was GOOOD. Richmond Court never fails =P. Anyways ate, payed bill, then got home.  Finally arriving home.....we drop off grandma at her house *across the street,* chatted with my uncle for a bit who just pretty much put surround sound everywhere in his place, and then got home.  Now I go SC then sleep hehe. Cya =P.

       5/7/04   My 2nd pair of  glasses: 2001-2004   Yup....my second pair of glasses have just died....er broken on May the 7th 2004 while playing lunchtime b-ball. Oh well.....it was bound to happen sometime....and I really was starting to really hate my frames. Gettin' old I guess *Shrug* but I'm aiming for contacts and a new pair....since contacts can be a pain in the ass to put on. Other than that "saddening" event......well in way not really since I get that new pair of glasses I've been wanting....the rest of my day. Average, not out of the ordinary.....what else to say =P. Wake up, school, home, and whatever else. Hmm.......theory exam though tomorrow....FINALLY gr. 3's over...unless I totally bomb the exam tomorrow which I think won't be an option.......I hope lol. So studyin' for that right now while typing up this entry, and doing various other things like MSN, listenin' to music, and sitting in front of this compy typing up this.....entry.....  My day started around 730 once again, with me dragging myself outta bed reluctantly and then trudging down the steps from my 2nd floor to my 1st as I am anxious for my breakfast. Starving from well usual slumber hehe. So ate a meal of tofu, beef, and rice and downed it with a glass of milk *wonder what it all looks like mixed with gastric juices in my stomach =P* and then headed upstairs to brush teeth n' stuff, get dressed, then head out the door. Stupid single strap duffel bags seem to get heavier and heavier each day.......but they carry so much more crap which is good =P. Anyways...back to the subject. Headed out the door, Patrick then came and then we headed for school.  School started today with history class like any other day 1. History bein' pretty boring....post-war Canada really is lame....worse than 20's or 30's I think. Well basically we talked about cold war....yeah that was history. Pretty boring.  Civics class then....where me, Lindsay, Hammond and Dave finally finished our stupid civics assignment. And then......got my essay on JFK back. WHOO 19/20.....my civics mark is going up =P. And so far my day is going well. But all this would turn in a matter of seconds around lunch.....and math....  Lunchtime played some crap ass ball and also broke my glasses in the process. So that kinda sucked....and then I realized that playing ball w/out my glasses feels a lot different. The net looks blurry from the perimeter lol. After playing ball though..yeah.....well not really playing more of shooting around since I was kinda blind but meh.....still s'all good. Math class anyways....  And my day would go downhill a bit more...geting 68% on my stupid GrafEQ assignment. Apparently he thinks that I made up the equations.....though I just printed them off the project. OH well.....*shrug* I still have an 83 in math.....somehow managing to be 2nd highest mark in class lol. Didn't really do much...just work today.  Programming: Usual.  And after school went to UCC to play some ball with Jason. Grabbed some more pizza from the new Pizza Hut and then ate and walked simultaneously to the UCC. Getting there, we played some one on one, shot around, and then the full court games started so we had to shoot when they were on the other end of court. Hmm not much else.....ugh I still need to work on my shot. My driving is startin' to sorta come back though which is a good thing, but gotta guarantee those finishes. So did that for two hours, then headed home.  And my night went somethin' like this  -SC -Theory -SC again when I got home -Studyin' for theory  Anyways I'm out for the night...so yeah if you people can pray my theory exam goes well for me that'd be great =). Gotta sleep now though.....exam plus Toronto tomorrow hehe.  Later.

       5/6/04   TV: one inatimate object that I nearly forgot about =P   TV. The last time I remember watching the thing before today was at least 3 weeks ago. Holy crap the stuff I've missed. Example: Friends Finale tonight.....it was the first time I watched the show and the last time as it being an actual functioning show. Talk about ironic huh =P. Thing is though I actually enjoyed the last episode, whichw as surprising since I never really even regarded it as a "show....in my list of TV shows at least. It's kinda interesting how one's perspective can change over a course of an hour of watching a show. Other than that though....today was also day 1 of recovering from the last two days where I have been a bit sick, and also today I wrote my english exam essay thing; wonder how that turned out =S.  My day started off in the morning at 7:30am. Reluctant to get up since the night before I spent most of my time on MSN and looking at random websites, I was pretty tired when I woke up. Nevertheless I still got out, sick as I was, and walked downstairs for a quick breakfast, and then headed out the door after a quick morning routine.  While on the way to school, chatted with Patrick, and finished my tea to wake me up in the morning. I can understand now why some people need tea or coffee to wake them up in the morning. I'm becoming one of those too lol. Anyways got to school pretty quickly, and got out and headed for the school.  Music class........not very exciting. We had some sub teacher today that came from Russia and taught at Pearson for a while. Mrs. Wharton and Mr. Clark are out in NYC right now, so yeh the music department's pretty much abandoned for now. Our class worked on our solos for the first half, while our sub, Mrs. Veiner or something on the lines of that worked with Mr. Clark's class. So my class spread out over many rooms and started to practice a bit, preparing our solos for June. I sight read the songs that I have to play keys for *Kelsey and Niki so far* and also practiced my piece for a bit, that has now changed since I bought a book at Belle Air. After a while though I got bored, and started reviewing my Grade 8 piano pieces on the piano. Who cares about my trombone piece.....it sucks and plus I changed it anyways. So therefore.....be productive by attempting to memorize the few songs you have in your head ready for the future exam. Amy played a few pieces then, and then we talked a bit about piano. Apparently she's CC too I think and not RCM. Meh anyways before much else happened....headed back to the other room for some repetoire and then left class for science...  Chatted in the halls with Niki and BW and some other people for a bit, and then me and Niki headed up to science class. Today: Ergh we did some stupid assignment of labeling an ecosystem. I handed in the assignment due for the other day and then began working on today's work. Pretty lame stuff....finished it in about 30 minutes and then chatted for a bit with Dylan and Boughton and some other people. Nominated Boughton for student council....*shrug* that's something different today I guess. Student parliament has started elections so I see. Anyways though....bell rang....all those thoughts just jumped out of my head and off I went to study for english exam.  While in the library, chatted with Brescia, made a few more notes, and then ran over them. Didn't really do much at lunch. I starved =P. Yay the feeling of emtpiness in your stomach.  Bio class now. Since 16 people were missing....NO LAB! Whoo! Instead we watched two boring videos *shudder* where I slept for one and watched the other since it was actually somewhat action packed *GASP.* Bio class was pretty short, and Robert read over some of my notes as he didn't make any. So meh whatever thought might as well give him a bit of a chance. Lilian was set for the exam too, and so when the bell rang......dun dun dun.....  English: summarized....I wrote my exam. I was 2nd last person to hand it in. I think I failed =P.  After school I went to Belle air to pick up music, then home. While going home though, I stopped by the new Pizza Hut where Western donuts used to be. SWEET 2 BUCKS A SLICE OF PIZZA! I may not even have to go out for lunch anymore =P. So grabbed a slice, then walked home.....ugh backpack feels heavier and heavier in the warm weather.  Anyways......after school watched some TV, homework, then caught the last episode of friends. Yeah that was pretty much my day I'm zippin' by it really....gotta shower and sleep hehe.  Cya.

       5/4/04   Ah....Choo.   Compared to yesterday's sneezing, coughing, aching and etc., today actually wasn't that bad sick wise. I didn't feel like crap.....and I have come to realize that Contac-C is fairly useful in times like these. Well.....after all the work yesterday of cramming a whole bio project in one night....here's the result:     An aerial view of "G.I. World"       Rectal Rangers.....where evil intestinal parasites lurk     Pretty nifty huh =P? I personally thought we did a pretty good job on this project. And I think I did a good job on my part....considering for the whole time I was coughing, sneezing, sniffling, and having a head more stuffed than a..........stuffed teddy. So after catching sleep for 7 hours, and missing band, I finally woke up at 7am....to a very unpleasant feeling of crappiness in the morning. That all changed though.....all thanks to Contac-C lol. So in the morning.......ate breakfast....and then took Contac-C, washed it all down with some OJ and then headed to school......of course after morning routine. While packing the project, almost broke adam's Esopha-Drop, but other than that it was good =).  So on the way to school......talked to Pat since I gave him a lift today. He seemed amused with the bio project....and was curious to why there were Micro Machines on it. Well I'll explain now....they're "visitors" to the park lol. Imagine the guns aren't there hehe. Radio today was pretty stupid...oh wait was it even on? I don't remember....was too attentive trying to explain the whole park to Patrick. It really was a work of art....though I'm still sniffling from post-sawdust syndrome.......that's ok....most of the reason probably was from me in shorts, sandals and shirt in 5 degree weather. The sawdust was just another factor to make things worse.  Finally arriving to school.......I struggled to get the project upstairs. Thank goodness people at Central are willing to hold doors.....or my project woulda been smooshed going up the flights of stairs just to reach 3rd floor. Well finally reaching the 3rd floor.....Tehmina then notifies me that I should beware when I go to room 301 since apparently Mr. Pigeon was pretty pissed off today. So I quickly went in, dropped off the stuff and then headed to first period class: Music.  Music class consisted of still choosing our pieces.....of which I will do at Belle-Air soon. I still chose an auxiliary piece though just incase....but Dave Rutt told me to get a Ariose or sometin' by Bach. RCM 6....gotta remember that. So we played........Mrs. Wharton noticed my absence in band and gave me the evil glare that all teachers seem to possess......and then we went on with music. Lots of counting stuff today.....since it seems many gr. 10's can't count past 4 in music....and practiced some songs for music night. Not much happening in class......easy breeze class like usual.  Finally reaching science class, I finally get to see the portfolio that Underhill typed up for our bio project. Look's pretty good actually....and I'm beginning to like taking pictures with a D-Cam lol. We did some lab today with ecology......about how animals thrive and stuff with food and without. Lab's due Thursday....same day as english exam. Argh. Finished that.....and then left for lunch...  Oh wait there is no lunch for me today....I have to go finish bio project lol. So we headed into library....plugged in my glue gun *is that allowed? oh well* and started finishing it up. Okanski ran to his place to grab the project portion he had and came back....and we began glueing together our masterpiece. We were fairly organized with it.....and quickly managed to finish up the project.....then off to bio we went. While milling away to bio class....I then see that the whole hallway is littered with bio projects for 4th period class. Wow....some of them were AMAZING *Lindsay's group and Tehmina's group had crazy ones* and also another two gr. 11 groups had REALLY good ones. I then look down on mine....and think deep inside *aww nuts* but reassuring myself *Joe you may have Chinese failed....but you still are Joe Passing.* Well to bio class....  Instead of the proposed lab for today.....we each presented our project for fun. And then after that while explaining our lab, Ms. Wiener would for some reason make a sound effect for everything she did *example following:*  After taking the mouthpiece, *yoink yoink* you can then clean it in the ethanol just like this. Dipping it in *dip dip* you then rinse it off *rinse rinse* and then shove it onto the machine *erk erk.*  It was pretty funny...but yeah highlight of bio class today had to be the projects.....all of them were so cool...But I really hope we don't have to do this again.....takes so much stinkin' time to complete and money....argh I spent 50 bucks @ art store for all the crap.....and the plywood was never used. But the project was worth it I think.....it looked pretty nice. But yeah.....after that class....FINALLY......the final class of  the day which I'll summarize very quickly....  English class.....prepare to write exam on Thursday. Prayers please for that....ugh I hate exams.....especially english. So unpredictable. Well at least we can bring in notes for reference....but stilll ENGLISH UGH! WHY NOT LEARN SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE!? Oh well......off to making my notes tomorrow I guess....ergh hopefully I do well....got 65% on first exam this year....argh......  Busing home then.....I got off at Sarnia and Castlegrove like usual. Surprisingly though I see Adrian....and chatted with him...well until the next Whitehills bus came lol. Yeah so apparently he did move out to Grand Bend, and lives with his dad now. Was kinda surprising though since only 3 weeks ago he was over at my place....what a change in location and times lol. SO we chatted for a bit.....and then we both went our ways since he had to go to UWO to find his dad to get home *his dad's a professor there* and I walked back home with Ryan....since well his Whitehills bus came by. Wow.....I sat there for 15 minutes. Amazing how fast time goes by lol....  Getting home......I get informed with the recent news. IMPORTANT news....like Hermann got 4th in WOSSA and Gavin got 7th. Lina got 11th, and by the way this is all badminton. What other news......umm oh yeah from before I finally realize Red Wings are out of the playoffs *NICE* and the flames now go on to play either San Jose or Colorado *Better be the Avs....they'll OWN them =P.*  Anyways.....I'm out for this entry. Got some stuff still to do tonight, plus band tomorrow, plus I'm still half sick. Cya.

       5/3/04   Sick, and cramming for bio project? What else could make my day worse?   Ugh.....why did I have to not wear a coat and dress like it's July in 5 degree weather yesterday? The outcome of that dumb descision: I've been suffering with a stuffy nose, sneezing, aching, coughing, etc. all day long. ARGH and to make things worse I had to endure sawdust, smell of spray paint and various other things while making my bio project tonight with Underhill at my place. UGH.....not exactly the best day of my life, actually today was probably one of the less happier days for me. However....with the bad comes the good also.....as finally I have pretty much secured a spot for gr. 11 physics and dropped gr. 11 accounting =).  It's 11:42pm right now, I'm sick, huddled under a blanket in front of my comp, so my blog's gonna be brief today:  -Woke up with a scratchy throat, thinking I may be sick -School -History test......totally winged it....but it was WWII so it was all jokes =P Easy stuff -Civics: Note on politics....started debate assignment -Lunch: Jasper's....throat feels a bit better after lunch -Math: Got 86% on trig test -Guidance appointment: Secured spot almost in physics for next year -Programming: Made 007 animation a bit more... -Stage band X: New song......My Funny Valentine or sometin like that....easy piece -Got a ride to Masonville to pick up project materials -Underhill came over and we finished most of project up -Built Rollin' Colon and Rectal Rangers, and Tooth booth (I'll post pics tomorrow....HILARIOUS) -Typing up bio portfolio -SLEEP!  Yup....that was the main outline of my day *sneeze...cough cough.....gasps for breath.* And I'm still pretty sick....so off I go to sleep now! Cya!

       5/2/04   First Sunday of May: very procrastinative =P   Hmm.......well my day's been somewhat amusing I guess. Actually today at church was pretty fun...with me, Gavin and Steph leading worship.....and Bible Study today wasn't too bland either. After that, some great food from Dragon Court and then....well I WAS gonna go work on my bio project........but I don't have any popsicle sticks to make the gargantuan structures that I have planned. So instead......I went to play B-ball at UCC w/ Jason lol. Procrastinating eh? NOOOOOOOOO! Of course not.......I improved sorta with B-ball....SORTA....  My day started off at 7:50.....quickly getting ready then bolting out the door...AWW NUTS IT'S RAINING! So I had to put something over my compy so the rain won't fry it *if it does* and stowed it away in the back of the car. Ergh if floppy diskettes could hold more than 1.4 megs.....I wouldn't have had to lug my stupid compy to church for a 2 meg file. GRRR! And then off we went to Lina's place to pick her up....and to Jason's like usual. After pickin' em all up....finally we head to church =).  Getting there around 8:30.....we immediately begin to prepare for english worship this morning. Ugh.....this morning many technical difficulties from many of us. For some reason the stupid projector would switch from RGB to Computer input back and forth until Josh set it right....and I plugged the mouse and keyboard plugs in the wrong ports......and MANY other problems occured this morning lol. Luckily though...after some prayer and bashing some stuff......IT WORKED! And of course magical button pressing from Josh =P. So we were ready and underway.....and my presentation didn't go to waste *PHEW!*  So worship started at 9:15 like usual......and well our singing part didn't go that bad. After the Praise part of service....came the sermon. Today's topic: "Following Jesus." Basically the main message through the scripture (Galatians 5:13-18) says that if you live under Christ's faith.....then you will be protected from the grasp of Satan. I really liked the sermon today....and I was actually awake for much of it. Zoned out a bit thinking about some other things......but quickly got back on track. Over history though *on my note* humans have been straying futher and further away from Christ. It may be a difficult, long walk, but with Christ's help....he'll guide you through the right path. I really thought our response song "Pure and Holy Passion" fit in real well, basically with the lyrics saying  that you want God to be your leader, and we may see him and go on after him, following in his Holy and True footsteps...like I said....really liked the sermon today hehe.  After service headed downstairs for some REALLY good cookies.....and then chatted around a bit before class started. Steph spilled some tea.....twice.....and me and Jason made plans to play ball after church @ UCC. And then Bible Study class......(or Sunday School....whichever you wanna call it)  We studied more about Jonah. Mr. Kilik and Victor joined us also. Much debate still about whale or fish that swallowed Jonah, and also if he was stuck in the whale's "air chamber" *aka lung* or his stomach. I say lung since if he waas in stomach.......I was thinkin'....wouldn't HCl burn up Jonah? lol. Anyways enough of my scientific ranting with the Bible......after that class......had to go home early.....mom had to drive some people places and then we headed home for lunch.  Ate some lunch....some NSFU *FINALLY PROGRESSED SOMEWHERE AFTER 4 MONTHS* and Jason read my Brood War strategy guide for more strategies to use on Battle.Net. I just played NFSU.....and changed my car from a Impreza to a RX-7. YAY!  And then ball from 3-5. Hmm my shot's slowly coming back. Jason beat me 1 on 1.....but I beat him at 21 2/3 times. He beat me once....*shrug* I won majority =P. Then we got really bored......and started chucking the ball from half court. Surprisingly....Jason actually made 7 shots from half lol. I amde 4 close ones and many misses. Also I seem to have trouble making 3's....LOTS of trouble lol. So gotta work on that......plus my regular shot + driving if I'm gonna go into Hoop-It-Up with Jason, Calvin, and some other person we still need to figure out lol.  After getting a lift back home from Jason's dad.....I sat around for a bit before heading to David's grandma's place to eat dinner. Ergh........so boring. I mean I don't mean to complain....but it can be pretty boring there....but at least she has satellite TV and she cooks REALLY good food. Why's it old people cook better than anyone else in the world I don't know....but it still proves true.  So got to the place around 6:30.....and filled the timeframe in from 6:30-9pm with eating, watching TV, talkin' to Josh, Steph and Rebecca and playing cards. President, Speed, and a new game I learned called "Yueker?" Anyways it's kinda like hearts.....and bridge sorta......and we play in teams. It's weird.....I still kinda don't get it. Oh well.....time really flies when you're eating.....and I go home =P.  Showered....and now munching on carrots, studyin' for history and.....about to sleep hehehehe. Yeah it's pretty late....gotta head to bed soon hehe. Later.

       5/1/04   May: another month blocking my road between summer and school   My title actually has nothing to do with my day today. I just thought of that actually just now as I was busy working away at my church's Presentation for worship tomorrow. My day's actually been non-stop "action" if you will say.....never really stopping for a break or anything....yes the average Saturday....plus more work than usual. Hehe.  My day started at around 10 or so....with me getting up aftera 1 hour delay and immediately beginning work on my theory papers. Hehe all caught up already....I only got two more papers left =P. So after doing a crapload of that....wow already 1130. So I go shower, then ate my breakfast from good old McD's =P. So quickly ate that....played some piano.....and off to piano lessons...  Yay.....3 marks for theory papers. I MANAGED A 96! SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE! HOLY CRAP! So yeah there was one highlight....Melody's not the only person with a 90+ now.....MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. Enough of that though.....after some marking of theory...played some pieces...then off I went back home...where I had to wait for Underhill, Okanski and Robert to head down to my place to do some work on our project...  And for project working today: we organized who's doing what then everyone left. Yup....Okanski was amused by that huge-ass light I have in my family room...and Robert's roller coaster actually looks pretty cool. This project is actually pretty retarded....making a theme park for the digestive system? L-A-M-E. Our ideas are pretty cool though. Gastrointestinal (G.I.) Joe....heh a creation by Okanski. It rings though hehe. And so after Okanski and Underhill leaving first, Robert played some DDR for the first time in his life....then left shortly afterwards.  I'm gonna zoom by the rest of my day briefly.....as my fingers seem to be frozen and cannot type....and plus I wanna go on SC for a bit then sleep...  Theory Donut Clinic #2 for me: Productive. Got some work done while chatting with some people........and found out that Jaclyn Jung's sis seems to be one of those typical Asians who likes really high marks. She was complaining about an 85 in theory. I was surprised....since back then when I was in gr. 1 theory....I was happy with a 70 lol. High standards from a grade 5......or whatever grade she's in. Her sis is good at music though so I'm assuming the same for her. So after working on some theory......I then left with a Maple Syrup donut *one of the ones from Timmy's* and then headed to church for worship practice...  IT ACTUALLY LASTED LESS THAN 1 HOUR! So after doing rehearsal w/ Steph and Gavin....and then got a ride home from mom. But when I went downstairs to get my bag...  Hmm....no one really came to tonight's movie night @ LCAC. It kinda make me thought "ouch" since my dad even spent time makin' a dinner and stuff....but at the same time I guess it was just this week....plus this was a first time thing. Hopin' though that more people would come next time....kinda a bummer I guess.....but oh well.....it took more than a week to build Rome as they say. And my church's Chinese Ministry does tend to be less participating in events I guess than the english half. Maybe one because many are fairly old.....but even the younger people seem to be too "busy" with other things. Well...prayers I do believe will be answered, and I guess this is just one of many other items I can pray about. It was kinda crappy to see that sight though....I really hope that one day more people at my church will see that a church isn't just a building to enter on a Sunday....but can be used for other events as well...  Oh well.....getting off that subject though...I came home, but that never really got outta my mind since my mom was talkin' about it with me on the way back home.  But getting home....had dinner.......and quickly begun working on the church's Presentation for tomorrow.  Oh yeah, also checked on NHL.com........THE AVALANCHE WON AGAIN! YAY! 3-2 SERIES ONLY NOW! TWO MORE GAMES AND THEY COULD MAKE WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS! COME ON AVS! Plus lucky Jenn.....she got to go to a concert led by the one and only CHRIS TOMLIN! *Shakes Fist* Lucky kid =P. Why must London be so lame? Also apparently Josh now has most of his Linux figured out....and I finally got those pics sent around to Jason and them from my camera. Lol the day when  Gavin "Judo kicked" a cinderblock haha.....BLAST deleted it by accident though =(. Plus the white pipe that turned into a hat/kung-fu stick lol.  And now.....after all that work....time to relax a bit. SC then SLEEP! Later people.

       6/30/04 Spiderman 2: Eeh...   Just got back from watching Spiderman 2, and yeah...I wouldn't recommend it. I basically wasted 10 bucks on THE most cliché movie ever. Then again there were some cool parts, but I won't reveal them and let you figure them out on your own by paying money to go see it. But yeah I'll talk more about that later...for now you can read the rest of the entry, or picture in your head how mediocre Spiderman 2 really was, or skip down to the paragraph about it...  I woke up today around 1030 once again, and this morning decided to do my devos early in the morning. I read around Colossians 3:13, pretty much Colossians chapter 3. The chapter was about how once you become Christian your aim is to change from your old ways. I really enjoyed reading this passage, as just the encouragement alone in the passage helps I hope all Christians know that God will always help you back up on your feet, and also that we are all on the same boat on earth, and to keep one another from falling, encourage one another, and don't laugh at another's fault. On another subject, while doing my devos, I kept on wondering how some Non-Christians don't want to believe because they think God doesn't want them. I was actually talking to one of Carmen's friends about that, and I don't see how in the world he made that connection when probably half the Bible speaks of God's love. How can people see something like that?  After doing my devos, I slowly got ready to head to downtown to meet up with Josh and Ginnie. I also got my money ready, as I was going to deposit money today. My account will be back up to a healthy almost $400 dollars, and then I'd spend a lot today haha. So I left around 1230pm or so, and met Josh at the Scotiabank tower around 1245pm...ish. I called him on the cell in the building to find out where he was, and there he was, standing outside totally clueless that I'm indoors already. Ginnie then came afterwards, and we went to Jasper's for lunch. I heard Ryan Ruderford got the job there, that's cool I guess, and also I still got student discount =). Food was top notch quality like usual, and I couldn't fit all the pasta in me, not even thinking about the complimentary garlic bread. Yeah after being stuffed, we then walked to Bellone's, to finally go amp shopping  for Ginnie.  I went there mostly just to check out a guitar if I am considering, and also to look at some drumheads and cymbals. After going there, I then got stumped on what to buy, and decided I'd go home to look at some stuff on the internet first. So while I was oogling at the cymbals and drumheads, Josh was playing around with a defretted bass, which he is now very attached to *but he has no money unfortunately* and Ginnie was trying out different amps. In the end, she bought a 10 W or so Marshall, which is actually a pretty sweet one. The staff member there who was the specialist in guitars ROCKED. He was actually insanely good on the guitar...makes Gavin look like Gavin before he learned new strum patterns haha. So eventually Ginnie bought the little amp, and I got a pair of wooden sticks, since Zavitz and Shaunvir both convinced me to change from nylons. Nylon tips though do have two disadvantages that wood sticks would never have:  -The nylon tip comes off very easily. I could pull one off probably. -The nylon tip leaves white marks, meaning I have to clean more often.  Wooden sticks...they just get soft after a while and break.  After goin' there, I got home by bus around 330pmish, and began my search for Zildjian or Sabian cymbals, and what Remo heads I'd buy. Also during this time chatted with Maisie, Josh, Jason, Lina, and various other people. This would also be the time that Josh announced our domain is totally up and working. It may be bland, but it works. So far Josh, Jason, Gavin and I share the space on this spit spat of webspace, where eventually a much better blog will be up...once I borrow Jason's book on CSS, XHTML, XML, AND HTML =). For the moment, you're stuck with this =P. Drummed around for a while, and then my dinner would consist of a veggie/fruit platter that my mom made. It was good, and I don't complain, it made me full =P, and even had enough for leftovers which I'm almost done eating around now. Maisie and I shared some more files, and before I knew it I had to meet Jason at Masonville since me and him wanted to go to Champs earlier, me because I wanted to grab a Yao jersey for 35 bucks and Jason to look for future things to buy.  Got to Masonville around 640ish, and then bought my Yao jersey. Checked out EB, HMV, and other places too. Apparently Masia One CD came out a LONG time ago...August 2003. Anyways point is, I'll order it some other time, and stick to DJ Doboy music for now.  After that short time of mall prowling, we went back to meet up with the others for the movie. Twins and Jonny where there, and Josh, Rebecky, and Gavin then showed up. Gavin received his guitar capo present that me and Josh bought from Bellone's today, and Josh even wrapped it up in duct tape haha. So everyone was here...except Carmen and Lina...  Sad part is, they've been at the mall since 5:30, and sadly THEY'RE STILL LATE. So in the end we decided to go in anyways without them I mean they showed up five minutes before the show somehow. So when they FINALLY got there, the movie had just started, so yeah they were lucky haha. Theatre had been packed since 730, so we had to sit somewhat scattered. Jason, Gavin, Josh and I sat where there were legrests, while the others managed to fit themselves 2 rows behind us. From then on the movie started...  Now I guess the movie wasn't ALL that bad, with some really cool parts like the Subway fight. During that battle, there was this one part where everyone in the theatre basically went "whoa" and Gavin sadly missed the part haha. In the end we told him, but you have to see it I think. There were other good parts, but go watch it yourself =P.  Afterwards we all chilled at McD's for a bit. Saw Kurtis there and chatted with him for a bit, then went back to the others. So we sat around for a bit, chatted, and then I had to go home, and give Lina a ride back also.  So here I am now, blogging, eating, and chatting with Ju, Jason, and was with Jenn on MSN. Haven't talked to Ju in ages, so yeah good to see her still talkin' haha. Gerts is shocked to hear me mock Spiderman, so she left with a "PFFT!"  Anyways I'm gone for now. I don't know what the heck I'm doing tomorrow for Canada Day.   Later.

       6/29/04 Ok I'll just do one big post...   Well originally I wasn't going to post anymore for today, but after doing my devos today, I felt the need to blog this stuff out.  While reading through my PDL, I then came across the verse Hebrews 3:13, which reads:  "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."  I found it nice that there was such a nice verse in the Bible that basically summarizes *in my mind* to "Keep your heads high, and always be there for one another as long as there is a tomorrow." However me being me, I like to read the full chapter of verses that interest me. Hebrews Chapter 3 isn't all that happy though. In fact, the majority of the chapter is about the gloomy end you have if you don't believe.  I then started to think, and then eventually referenced to NIV version *NASB is a bit difficult to understand, big words* and then prayed for guidance. Prayer never fails. Nor does NIV...it's proven to me time and time again that it is much more understandable than NASB...but I use NASB more because I need a bigger vocab. Anyways to the point...  As I was reading the chapter, and reflecting, it really boggles my mind on how ignorant people really are. It hurts even to think about it at times. Now I may be a hypocrite it seems while writing this as I can be ignorant too, but no one's perfect, and I can still give out advice. I'm happy though at least I never ignored the opportunity in believing in God in my life, and I can see him doing so much in my life everyday. It hurts all the time though to see so many of my friends live their daily lives without even knowing how much God does for them backstage.   This isn't a new issue though. In the story that Hebrews refers to *the crossing of the Red Sea, Moses, etc...it's in Exodus* the Israelites, even seeing countless miracles *the 10 plagues, the Egyptians drowning in Red Sea, etc.* they STILL don't see how caring God is, and time and time again, complain about the lack of care they are getting, and still rebuked the God that led them out of Egypt. Despite all this though, God still loves them, even 'till today. It's pretty cool how despite the fact many of his children rebuke him and do such bad things in His eyes, he still loves each and everyone of His children, and still hopes each and everyone of us will see and believe He is the Lord. What an awesome loving Father God really is. I wish that after 2000 years, humans could change this bad habit of ignoring God.  It seems as though the Bible never ceases to teach me new things =).  Haven't shared a devo in a while, and the stuff I read really got me thinkin', hope it does the same for those who read it. As for my day...  Well I tore down previous posts about my day, so yet again, I'll write it in one big post.  I got up around 10am this morning being awakened by a phone call. At first I thought it was another annoying telemarketer, or some really annoying friend who would dare call me at 10am. Well after the answering machine picked up, and I realized it was for volunteer...  HELLO!??!?!?!?!?!  Yeah I quickly picked up the phone as I am in dire need for hours haha. So I'll be at Masonville Library doing Craft prep for a day and then surveying there for two days. So much fun...at least I get hours, and it's nice giving back to the community as the saying goes. So yeah my day started like that, and afterwards, dragged myself out of bed and headed downstairs for my welcoming breakfast of leftover pizza. Whoo.  Afterwards chatted around on MSN for a bit, lost to Maisie 3 times out of 4 in the Minesweeper Flags game on MSN, and then had to go to Belle Air to return my trombone, exiting the room with a glorious tumble out of my compy chair.  Getting to Belle Air, it took me two hours to do the full process of returning my trombone, and eventually purchasing it. Here's a rough breakdown of how it happened:   230pm-240pm:Drive to Belle Air. 240pm-245pm:Paperwork and stuff to return trombone. 245pm-3pm:Tried out the trombones I was thinking about purchasing. Went with Yamaha. 3pm-345pm: Mom haggled the price down from $700 to $660. During this time I would look at guitars, cymbals, and nearly knock down a drumstick rack, which luckily I didn't. Chinese people seem to LOVE to haggle, and in the end got tuning slide grease and a spray bottle for trombone slide w/ my purchase. Didn't wanna rip Belle Air off THAT much. 345pm-355pm: Drive home.   As usual my mom went to watch the stupid Soap Opera w/ my Grandma, that one called...PASSIONS that's right. Ugh I can hear the stupid theme song everyday coming home from school, and over the summer...everyday either upstairs, or downstairs. Ugh why did the world ever create such retarded TV shows? Well anyways, during this time I ate, lounged around the house, and would be cleanin' and trying out my newly purchased trombone. It's shiny =). Chatted on MSN for a bit again, then went to drum for around 40 minutes or so. Also, I'd spend an hour file sharing with Maisie for some reason...we were both REALLY bored so we tried everything that MSN can do...where most don't work unfortunately. This afternoon between 4-7 was pretty lifeless when I think about it. I drummed, tromboned, and MSNed haha.  Afterwards I was going to go workout with Marcello, but he didn't call back until 830 so screw that. Then I thought "why not ball?" So while talking to Jason on the phone, we finally both agreed to go to UCC...until my mom reminded me about dinner.   "SO THAT'S WHY I FEEL SO HUNGRY" I thought to myself. I had somehow managed to forget dinner ehehehe. So yeah ate, and didn't go to UCC haha.  Afterwards showered, and then did the devo as shown earlier.  Today I think was an awesome day. Got a reply from WLAC regarding coffeehouse *90% it's a go,* read an awesome devo, got a new trombone, Josh finally got the green light for our domain, and of course....T-MAC IS A ROCKET! Why Houston is now my favourite team along with Dallas =)...actually I've always liked Houston for Yao, but with T-Mac now...they'll be awesome next season. Shaq still may go to Dallas which is cool, so heads high for both teams =).  Anyways yeah...beat Maisie at checkers then, and now...yeah I'm done posting.  Sleepin' early tonight since tomorrow got a big day ahead of me. Amp shoppin' w/ Josh and Ginnie, lunch w/ 'em also and then watching Spider Man 2 and chillin' at the mall. So..in conclusion...  Later boys and girls.

       6/28/04 Badminton: The sport I'm horrible at =P   Tired from a day of baddy and planning for HYPE's summer. So yeah not much happened today except for those two things really.  I got up at 11am today to get ready to go to Ken's place for HYPE meeting. So left around 1130, got some McD's, and then met Wendy and Josh @ UCC and walked to Ken's place.  We planned until about 230 or so then hit some badminton.  I got wrecked =P...  Now I'm really tired. I really hope that coffeehouse can be arranged with WLAC through Lindy, and Josh's friends. So yeah after today's meeting, all I can really say is sit back, pray, and just led God lead the way through the summer.  God, I know you're watching us everyday. Help us find the path that is yours, and not ours. It's Your will....not ours that is to be done.  Later.

       6/27/04 A very tiring Sunday   Sunday was one very appropriate day of sleeping and a great way to end my weekend. Not that it really matters since I'm on holiday everyday, but it was still nice to just sleep for 5 hours today after Jason and Gavin left @ 5pm or so and just have no care about whatsoever. After a week of lookalike celebrities shish-kabob contests, cutting my hair, crashing into a siderail at a  OUTRAGEOUS  10km/h, havin' Jason, Gavin and Josh crash at my place, and Jason and Gavin over today, yeah I needed sleep...well more than the 6-7 hours I go the other few days. Sleep....is good. =).  My day today started at 730, waking up earlier than usual for worship rehearsal at the church. So got ready fairly quickly, and headed out the door. Jason slept in today, so didn't pick him up today, and Lina went to do some volunteer work. So yeah only me today, and of course dad drove.  Got to the church 2nd! Vince was waiting there when we got there, but Gavin and Josh, the two "punctual" ones were actually late....REALLY late. I don't blame Josh since he had to do the slide show...but Gavin has no excuse for being late =P.  Worship went really well today in my opinion, and it sounded pretty cool with two guitars, a bass, and drums....and of course who could forget Rebecky on vocals =).  Sermon today was about voting. It regarded mainly of course the UWO students, but was still good to listen to. Pastor D reminded us of how when we vote we should be listening to God, and not to ourselves. It also spoke of how if everyone didn't listen to themselves, and if everyone listened to God, many of our problems in this world would not occur. Good sermon....hope I'll remember it when I'm 18 =P.  After sermon, we went downstairs to be welcomed by a breakfast rather than refreshments. Apparently dad had been cooking all morning for us with breakfast foods of all sorts...well mostly pancakes and bacon, but there were timbits too =). So we all dug in, and then also some of us went to the siderail I hit to re-evaluate the damage. To make my collision feel all that much better huh guys =P. Yeah...I still find it kinda funny how I actually managed to hit the siderail up until now...oh well good lesson learned...plus I learned lots...including the fact that auto transmission cars go without you hitting the gas...they naturally move at 5km/h or so. So after re-evaluating the bent siderail, we all headed back in and then went to Bible Study.  Studied chapter 3 of Daniel today, the story where Shadrach, Misach and Abed-nego were thrown into the fire to die, but emerged alive. Nebudchadnezzar also was surprised to see four people in the fire instead of three, with the 4th person resembling as he called "a son of the gods." That is still disputed by some to have been Jesus or an Angel, but I still think it was an angel. After the study, had lunch at church since we had LOTS of leftover BBQ stuff, and we chatted around for a bit, then Jason and Gavin came to my place.  For the afternoon, pretty much just chilled and gamed...make use of the multitap as much as possible =P.  Then they left and I slept.  And my blog is getting shorter.  One sentence paragraphs are so cool....not.  Anyways I'm out. Later.

       6/26/04 My first chance at driving...and I scuff the car AND bent a siderail..Oh yes and picnic , and of course...    GAVIN GETS THE BIRTHDAY BEATS   Wow....what a day today. Today, June 26th, 2004, marks my first day behind the wheel of a car, and holy crap I'm horrible at it lol. Well at the moment at least. Actually my turning is good, but my sense of how much pressure to apply on the pedals...THAT will require some work. Also, I can park as well as Gavin does going forward...except I parked rear first...and yet I still parked just as bad as Gavin...which therefore means I can own him parking forwards =P. Also today was also the first time I've rehearsed with dual guitar and bass plus vocals for worship, and also today was our church picnic, where I got to eat the food that I prepared along with my dad and Jason, Gavin and Josh. Though Jason still talks about how he couldn't eat the stuff we prepared, I didn't mind...it's still food...and it still was good. In fact, I even picked up my signiture "J-Shroom" *a mushroom with my carved "J" on it* that I learned off that Chinese cooking show off Omni 2, except he did a star, which I did also =). I'm approaching chef level 1...for creativity at least haha.  After a crazy night of NFL/NBA Street last night with Jason, Gavin and Josh, plus some stupid stuff like random talking and throwing crap around the place, we finally got to sleep around 3am or so, with Jason going off to play SC until 5am sadly lol. Well we all got up today around 10am, and quickly got ready to go to the picnic. Started the morning with more gaming, and then we just kinda chatted around and stuff. Some of our voices are kinda cracked now from all the yelling and stuff, but yeah it's all good. I'm lucky to have parents that can tolerate us being loud. I mean me I'm already annoying enough yelling "MOM" from the basement just to figure out where she was in the house, in fact Jason and them threw a Moose and a Squirrel at me *stuffed animals* to shut me up. Yeah eventually when she replied I just said "HI" and she just ignored me. Plus when us four are together, we make rock bands sound like flutes.  We got to the picnic around 11am, and surprisingly I saw Anton and Jonny there. Calvin invited them, and yeah it was cool how they came. Rebecca then saw my hair, and she was surprised I took all of it off too. Calvin said the exact same thing Josh said:  "Hey Joe, if you add 6 dots to your forhead, you could be a monk. STEVE DUONG WANNABE."  First off I only cut it this way because I screwed up cutting it before, and secondly, HOW MANY BALD ASIANS ARE THERE? LOTS. ARE THEY ALL STEVE DUONG WANNABE'S?! *Calvin you're an idiot.*  We started the day off with some ultimate frisbee, and apparently Rebecky was sick today =(. It was Gavin's Birthday, and once Vince found out, Gavin got the beats haha. So after that, we started playing frisbee as mentioned before. We drawed, with my team consisting of Anton, Jason, Mike, and Rebecky. We drawed, and then we all quit when Calvin and Josh spirit fingered the frisbee...which was really lame. But after that, came food. The food that we prepared =). It was actually pretty good, and as said before I even found my trademark "J-Shroom." Last year I found my super onion shish-kabob, and this year I found the shish-kabob that I made for myself =P. After eating and chatting for a bit about random stuff from Power Rangers Movie on CityTV the other day *me and Vince butchered it* all the way to random fads of our past, we then played some football. Me, Pastor D, Josh, Jason, Rebecky and Carmen L. were all on one team against Calvin, Gavin, Jonny, Anton, and Jacky. We won despite the fact they tried running real plays...PHHT that shows how useful THEY are. Actually also because Calvin' doesn't know anything about football...he didn't know you can't forward lateral or the fact a centre can't run with the ball after the QB calls "Hut." Anyways that was fun, we owned....35-21 or so....and yeah after that we lounged around for a bit before I left with Vince, Gavin, Rebecky and Josh to go to worship practice.  I ALMOST for got my sandals but lucky Dad grabbed them.  And so we got to the church and began rehearsal. Started a bit wonky, but we made a strong finish at the end which I'm happy for. I find it annoying though how Gavin wanted me to play the drums to this one song EXACTLY the same way....though I thought it was retarded. I refused to in the end anyways, and we changed the songs up, but when we play a song, IT CAN HAVE VARIATIONS. But we managed to have some fun still, and get business done by the end, so yeah it was all good =).  Then when we were leaving, Vincent decided to take me, Gavin, and Josh out for a mini-road test. Gavin drove nicely, as did Josh *since he has G1.* Me on the other hand, yeah...that's another story as mentioned before. I park better than Gavin, I can turn, I can almost break well now....but I just learned the fact today that cars go by themselves at 5km/h or so WITHOUT applying gas. Sadly, I know how a car works, yet I don't know that basic thing. I know it goes disengaging in neutral, on Park the brakes lock, and something that most people probably don't know how, how a supercharger/turbocharger works. yet, I don't know that cars move without applying gas. Oh yeah I also managed a few turns using the one hand technique, which I feel special for. I can drive with one hand...like many others....but still I feel special =P. Problem is though I had to learn it's hand over hand for turning and not hand under hand with my hands upside down...apparently I die doing that =P. So with my skills, and my lack of senses at the moment, I managed to brake while turning *which is a good thing,* unfortunately AFTER that when I applied gas, I forgot about the fact cars move on their own a bit, so I hit a bit too much in, and....   SCREEEEEECH!   I graze/hit a siderail, bending it and causing me to go into shock. So for a few moments I was thinkin' "crap I just ruined Vincent's front" but apparently he said it's buffable...so WHEW. At least I didn't break a light...as I know that costs $$$...LOTS of it. Well yeah...I better work on my driving...but it was sure as hell fun...and a memory that will last forever I think haha. At the moment though, 10km/h seems fast to me, and I'll never yell at my parents to go faster when they are going 40km/h in a residential area. I won't complain about things I can't do myself.  Well after that first-time experience moment, we headed to Swiss Chalet for Gavin's Birthday. Vincent paid for us all, but I'm going to pay him back tomorrow. Swiss Chalet honestly though sucks. The chicken is dry, forcing you to use that crap dip they provide, which made life worse. Only reason why I can somewhat tolerate it is because their mashed potatoes actually are decent...unlike some other places. It was good times though, lots of laughs, and we eventually started talking about Vince's childhood for a bit after he showed us his still well-kept Banting Student ID. Me and Gavin ordered ice cream then, and Josh had his pie, and then we left.  First dropped off Gavin, and then Rebecky and Josh, and then me since I live only about 5 minutes drive from Vince.  Anyways getting late...and I gotta wake up early for worship rehearsal tomorrow.  Later.

       6/25/04 Library Compy Test==>PHHT! Jokes Another picnic preperation day of memories haha *THE CHICKEN LOOKS LIKE ACHILLES FROM TROY! Oh yeah, did I mention my hair's gone?   Ahahaha yeah today was awesome. I don't think much else could have topped it. I'll just start right away since Jason, Gavin, and Josh are crashin' at my place tonight. 4 player PS2 *rented multitap* and just chillin' times, haha we were all talkin' about when we are 40, and we still talk to one another about this stuff hehe. Anyways, I'll get right onto today...  My day started off at 1030am this morning. I had to wake up early as today I had to get ready to go to my Tech Tutor test at Masonville Library. So I got up, ate a healthy breakfast of McD's, played some NBA street, and then headed out the door for the library.  Got to the library around 11:50amish, and then made my way to the front desk to get the test. I would then be sitting at Computer Internet Plus #1 for the next hour and forty minutes, working my way to complete the blasted quiz I had. It was mostly jokes, and I think I got the volunteer position, but there were a few things I didn't get....like something about making something show up on two different spreadsheets. But other than that everything else was jokes. At first I thought I couldn't copy and paste stuff from internet because they disabled right click on the mouse for EVERYTHING, but then remembered I can highlight stuff...whew. Excel and Word are two of the most useless pieces of junk though in the world in my opinion. Everyone should conform to OpenOffice.org =).  Well afterwards, I made my way to The Bay to find the blade oil for my buzzer. I couldn't find any there, and then just bused home. Well actually bused to UWO, then had to walk for 15 minutes, and then bused home again hehe. I called Jason and Becca to see where they were, and apparently they were wanderin' the downtown. I was thinkin' about meetin' them at Masonville, but then scrapped it afteI realized my blister from my sandals was getting to bleeding stage, well more of oozing stage *eeewww gross =P* and also I was just plain lazy. So walked home, eventually got my buzzer re-oiled at my uncle's house, and also checked out his Audigy 2 soundcard. It's pretty nice, but I can never really tell the difference with integrated and regular. Only difference I can really see is one can mix more noises and one can't. He also got Rainbow Six 3 and Tomb Raider AOD with it....I MEAN WTH!? ALL THAT FOR $150!? That's crazy....too bad my comp can't run the games or I'd be playin' two new games right now heh...actually probably not I don't find a passion in those Lara Croft games *the gaming heroine that has "a rack large enough for a Ming Vase" as described by GamePro magazine a while back* and Rainbow Six I've never liked.  Anyways when I got back home...I finally made the descision of cutting my hair....well shaving it I guess you can say now since hair isn't exactly present at the moment. Well sorta, it's like moss almost as described by my mom and dad. See ORIGINALLY it was gonna be around a #2 *if you know what I mean w/ buzzers* but then I accidentally cut off a bit too much off the side, and then I decided to ignore the fact it'll grow back in a few days, and decided to take it all off. So far Gerty says she'll yell at me later, lots of Eiee's from Wendy, Jenn and Lina and some whoa's from others. That's a shocked whoa not like a WHOA! After cutting my hair, I then sat around, SCed for a bit, ate food, and then got ready to head to the church to prepare the food for tomorrow. Well on the pro side, I never have to sleep with a wet head now, and also there is no drawn line between shampoo and soap now...IT'S ALL THE SAME! On the con side, for some reason my hair manages to get caught in the fibers in my shirt now, making it harder to put a shirt on. That actually surprised me I mean you'd think with shorter hair life would be easier with that sorta stuff...it backfired...sorta.  Getting to the church at 7pm, we *being Jason, Josh, and Me* begin to help my dad in preparing the food. Gavin then came a bit later, and that was when we began to fully work in full production. Right from the beginning the jokes were flying everywhere haha. Me and Josh fighting our veggie wars, the butchering of the chicken with the cleavers and the loud "WAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!" that followed every cut, or the imitation of celebrities/random figures with sish-kabobs...  Gavin: HEY LOOK IT'S TOAD FROM MARIO BROTHERS *makes a mushroom with lots of peppers and onions and some chicken* Joe: OMG GUYS I MADE ACHILLES FROM TROY! *puts shrimp resembling a helmet on top of a mushroom*  I would also go on to create one of those dragon dancers from a slab of chicken and a tomato, and also a Indian War Chief with more chicken and mushrooms and stuff. Yeah cooking can be so much fun. We couldn't marinate the chicken this year though, but oh well. Jason did the beef, and me Gavin and Josh packaged the stuff. Oh yeah we also talked about anime for some reason, and also my dream from yesterday....from different POV's.  Gavin kept talking about how we would be owned by the zombies, but I kept on claiming that we owned them since I didn't hear wimpy screams of humans, but the very low bass moans of zombies....as mentioned before Teenagers get these things in their heads from too much Silent Hill 3 and Resident Evil, but I'm not about to go through that shabang again about that stuff. Point is Josh's version had a Sniper Rifle-Flamethrower thing, where he'd miss the zombie even if it looked down the barrel, and Gavin's version of a regular Flamethrower. Jason had a Basketball-Ball Launching Gun of some sort...yeah that one still needs a bit of work...but it's still l33t....sorta.  Anyways yeah that was the most of my day...I'm gonna go play PS2 now, and eventually sleep tonight. Later....  Oh yes and before I leave, the current reviews of my haircut:  Wendy: EEEEEEEWWWWW! Jenn: Eeieieeeeee Gerty: I'll Laugh and Yell at you later Mabel YeeYee: Wah A Joe Deen gai lei jeen duk gum duun? John: LOL JOE YOUR EYEBROWS ARE LONGER THAN YOUR HAIR! Carmen: It looks good.*holy crap how the heck could he do that? Like omg...umm...I mean...like...oh geez...umm...like....eewww...geez..umm...like...eew...omg....LMSAO!omg omg omg omg omg omg omg ......EEEEWWWW!* It looks good =P Other random ones: Oh my Gosh, Wth?  Hey...I got one positive feedback...well probably not as I imitated...but meh.  Anywho I'm off now...Jason's staring over my shoulder reading this post while I'm typing, and I'm still gonna MSN for a bit and then I'll log off and do something more adrenaline-rushing than this...SLEEP! And PS2.  Later.

       6/24/04 Oh so NOW I dream about cool things   Ugh....when I DO want to dream about cool stuff I don't...and when I don't really care THEN the cool dreams pop in. GRR! Oh well they were funny dreams though. I had one last night and one this evening when I was napping from 6pm-8pm. Up until now I still don't get why I could dream about things, but yeah as I describe them right now I'll talk about my reasons why I think I thought of this stuff.  Ok so my first dream...which I will label   Resident Evil...in Cambridge    The morning was sunny when our hero Joe Chan wakes up. It was around 9:30am, and he has just woke up. Preparing for his day, he does his usual hygiene biz in the washroom, and then precedes to his downstairs to eat breakfast. After finishing his breakfast, he then heads to school for Report Card Pick-Up Day. It was June 24th, 2004.  Arriving at school, he gets out of the car and then goes into the cafeteria to get his report card. Upon heading out and about to wait for a ride, he then sees his math teacher, Mr. Gilbert:  Mr Gilbert: Joe. Joe: Mr. Gilbert. Mr. G: I saw you didn't come to instructional day. Would you like to see your exam anyways? Joe: Well, I didn't come because I DIDN'T want to see my exam *ha ha* but, alright sure might as well  *Mr. G then hands Joe the report card*  Joe: O M G! I TOTALLY BOMBED THE EXAM!? Whoa.  Our hero, shocked at his mark, had gone faar out of the heights from Joe fail and Chinese Fail. He even fell far below White Pass. He White Failed. Our hero's day had just been nailed with a gargantuan wall of depression. 50% on his math exam *by the way really I got 80%.* Our hero then skips off the Head 2 Head proposition he made with some of his friends, and then just got a ride home.  *Joe now forgets most of the dream around here*  Our hero now dazed and wondering where the heck he was *due to lack of memory from the storyteller* now finds himself, along with his HYPE fellowship friends at the Cambridge Heritage College, the same place LCAC had held their May Camp in 2004. However, our hero feels something is not right about this place this time. However, unable to diagnose the situation, Joe just chills along with his friends up there in the main Rec building, until night came along...  "Man it's getting late, I think I'm heading back," says Joe. "Wait up man we're comin' too," Josh and Gavin say as they come along with him.  Heading out the door, the three of them then begin their 75m trek back to their dorm. All was quiet in the midst of the night, until a silhouette of another figure appeared off in the distance. The three, conversing amongst themselves, then remembered the camp owner saying how they were the only ones there for the weekend. The figure, who seemed unaware of the group's presence, then left, in a very slow moving manner, as though it was dragging itself.  "Wonder what that thing was," thought Joe to himself.  The three, who decide to conclude it was just a local hoodlum, make also the descision about not worrying about him and continue back to their dorm. Opening the door then, they then use their keycard to access the inside of the dorm, and are heading up the stairs when from behind them a heavy breathing came...  A man, strangely resembling  Dave Rutt  *Stage Band X head...I don't know HOW this dream came together* was standing at the bottom of the stairs. However, for some REALLY strange reason...he was a zombie (How can a average group of 15-year-old dudes determine this? Well, from experience playing much Silent Hill 3 and seeing clips of Resident Evil...Joe owns the movie =P). The three, who realize what the thing is, begin running as the demonic, pale, flesh-rotting figure *not offending you Dave* begins to slowly drag itself up the stairs (yeah my dream has the slow moving evil figure and the frantic good guys also). The three fortunately make it to their room, where they then decide to brainstorm about what to do. They already know the following:   -Zombies are bad -Zombies hurt when they bite (well, probably) -There were more than one of these zombie things; there are at least TWO -They had to find a way to tell the others back in the Rec Centre   Finally concluding to a plan, the three then decide that they would climb out the window and run back to tell the others. However, our hero Joe, being the productive one he was, decided to walk out the front door. So while seeing off Gavin and Josh, Joe then walks out of the room and locks the door behind him. Walking down the stairs then, he then sees the same zombie, (the Dave Rutt resembling one) waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Joe then realizing that he screwed up the plan execution, RUNS up the stairs as the zombie chases him down. Our hero then jumps out the window, with the zombie floating out behind him. Our hero recovering from the fall then begins running towards a construction site. Crossing the property line, he then looks behind him and sees no zombie. He then looks around, and sees that no zombie was around. Our hero, who is safe, then hears the shrieks and screams of the zombies as they are being owned by the HYPE kids (yes they sound different, I don't think a dead figure can scream as high pitched as Steph, Carmen, Lina, Pow Pow OR Rebecca) and begins his trek back with a crowbar to the camp, ready to fend off any flesh-eating, flesh-rotting, odour-resembling-old-fish zombies that dare to stand in his way. Our hero is Joe.   That was the conclusion of dream I remember from last night. After finally waking up from the dream at 930am with my alarm clock jolting me awake, I then remember it was all a dream, and I am once again relieved that I did not totally blow my math exam haha. Waking up, I go through morning routine, and leave my house to meet Arjun at Head 2 Head at around 10am.  Getting there a wee bit early, I then wait for him for 15 minutes. After him not coming by 10:30am, I then decide to abandon this idea and go grab my report card.  So I walk there, get greeted by Mr. Dayus and Coach Doba, and then grab my report card and go. I wound up with a 86.3 average, so I'm on the honour roll still PLUS I get one of those copper plated medals for saying I'm over 85% average =P. I then go to the music hall to check who's in Jazz band...and yes I made it. Unfortunately Arjun got cut, but Pourier made it on Trombone too. So heading out, I call mom to tell her I'm going to Head 2 Head with John, Josh and some other people, and also the fact that I got a decent report card. Seeing Pourier heading out also with a trombone, since he found out he made it so he said he's practicing over summer. Well after some chatting, eventually we somehow got to me telling him to come along to Head 2 Head also. So we head out then and meet up with John. Arjun just called then and said he had JUST woke up at 11am. Well anyways afterwards Josh had also just arrived at his stop at Dundas and Richmond. So I told Josh to walk towards Dundas and Clarence, as that's where we were. Josh though somehow got onto King and Clarence, and then I had to run to find him. Eventually we figured out where he was *via cell phones* and then FINALLY we began gaming for the next 5 hours...well for Josh 4, and Pourier 2.  We started off with Battlefield, and would play that through the 45 minutes that Arjun came for in the end and for a bit when Colin and Mitch came also. So our afteroon was filled with BF, EE, Halo, and also Call of Duty, which with more people I found out it is actually pretty fun. So yeah that pretty much took up most of the afternoon, with me and John taking the bus @ 5pm. Mitch and Colin had more time since they came later, so they stayed back. Getting to the bus stop I also saw Stefan, who was also takin' the Dundas. Apparently in EuroCup England and Portugal were tied 1-1. We kinda got to talkin' bout soccer, though I didn't really keep track of EuroCup, but yeah World Cup...I still watch that closely =P...when it's on of course. Got off the bus then, hopped onto Whitehills bus, and then got off and walked home.  Getting home, I watched some TV, drummed, and then took a nap for 2 hours.  This was when my second dream happened. This dream wasn't AS weird...but still kinda on the unusual side haha. I don't know if any of the Martha TCers actually read this blog, but if you guys do, well here's a dream about none other than TEAM MAFFFAAA!   Martha Reunion...if it happened at Joe's   Actually I don't remember much about this dream, but here goes (it's kinda short):   The evening in Joe's house was filled with laughter and jokes with Team Martha 2004 all chattin' around in Joe's place. The house was packed with the 30 or so kids that was part of Team Martha in 2004, all just chatting about their summer so far and what they've done since March Break. Most of them have you know done the usual, chilled, and everything *daily thoughts I suppose in real life* except one person,  Karen , somehow became a hip-hop artist *I think I've been listening to Masia One a WEE bit too much.* So she pulled out her recently released CD, which was kinda BOKAN! but the CD was the main point. No one ever put in the CD for some reason, and we all stared at the somewhat BOKAN! case and the shiny CD that it encased within...so shiny.   See it's short. That's all I really remembered. I saw everyone, but once Karen pulled out the CD, the whole group was just quiet. We all just stared, and then I woke up because sleeping with three blankets gets really hot in the summer, and me being the smart one decided to sleep with three blankets. Anyways waking up, I have a bowl of "joak" for dinner and then for dessert some "yee mai sui."  Currently I'm on MSN. Karen and Steph are both in HK right now, soaking up the the slightly magnified-radiation rays of the sun, and of course eating all the good food in HK...mmm Dim Sum every morning was l33t when I went there in 1998. I was going to go again in 2003, but SARS...and you know yeah it sucked. Talking on MSN, I told Josh, Gavin, and Dave Rutt about my really messed up dream, and also was filled in every few minutes by Maisie about the show "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy." I never watched the show, but yeah she decided to ignore that factor and still jabber on about it. Also when talking about her receiving her orders or somethin' like that for cadets, we got into a talk about how she received a call instead of papers. Eventually it led her to explain it this way:     ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: cuz i'm leaving for camp the next day , n i gotta b home to get my departure orders Joe...so NOW the cool dreams come rolling in says: o0o0o departure orders...so militaryish Joe...so NOW the cool dreams come rolling in says: it's called a sheet of paper FYI!   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: sort of....   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: but they call u   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: cuz i won't see them until the day that i have to leave Joe...so NOW the cool dreams come rolling in says: so theyre papers.    ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: noooooooo   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: they call u stupid!   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: wait...that sounded wierd   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: they call u   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: and ur stupid   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: hehe i call u stupid!   I don't know if you guys get that...but yeah read the part where they say "They call you stupid!" and I think you'll understand how it came out kinda funny.  Anyways, off to do something else that may seem more productive than blogging...and probably is. I've typed enough for today. Gonna sleep earlier tonight. Have to get to Masonville Library by 12pm to do Volunteer training.  I'm out. Later.

       6/23/04 "What's that thing called when you hit all the pins down?...A STRIKE THAT'S IT!"   That quote taken from the one and only Calvin Chan when we went bowling along with the rest of the HYPE kids and also my two cousins Anthony and Jonny. It was an awesome time, pure jokes and chillin' haha. Today was one of the more energy-pumped days I guess you can say, with basically my whole night taken up at Fleetway tearin' up the lanes....with bowling balls. It was a nice way to end my day, beginning with stupid power repairs *meaning my power was going on and off* and also my volunteer interview at the Library. My whole day wasn't that bad though, in fact was probably the best day of this week haha.  My day started off at about 11pm. My clock was off, since the power was down since 9am, so I just picked up my cell phone to check out the time. Mom was goin' out somewhere, so I sat home alone for a bit. At first I was skeptical of what I was to do with no power, since it seems like my life sorta revolves around electricity now, but I finally realized something out of the blue....  This was the perfect time to do devos. So I spent some time then reading up on my PDL and then the Bible, and just reflected on them I guess. I read a lot on how each of us may have different talents, but God uses each and every one of them in his own way, and we all form one Spiritual Family. The Bible uses the metaphor of a human body, and how every part of your body isn't the same and has different functions. For example, the nose is used for smell and ears to hear. Without the ears you can't hear, or without the nose you can't smell. Same as the Spiritual Body....each of us have different talents for different things. I also read about the always said "treat others as you want them to treat you," and also how if everyone treated everyone with love, how we wouldn't have many of the problems in this world. It kinda sucks when you think about it how people sometimes just don't see that and how beef starts, and then eventually that beef can turn into....well you know whatever else bad can emerge out of it.  Well after doing devos, I headed downstairs to drum around for a bit. Sat on compy for a bit then, and decided to play SC with Gavin and whoever else was online at the time. I suck with Zerg, and when I was actually doing good....the power went out AGAIN. So then I scrapped SC, since it was already 2, and then I got ready for my interview.  Interview wasn't so bad today. Had to do some WHMIS quiz to know all the hazard signs and stuff it was pretty easy. Then just got asked a few questions. I'm probably gonna be a compy geek at library...or gardener. Dunno if I got position yet but I gotta do training Friday at Masonville Library.  And afterwards, sat around for a bit before Jason came. Then we headed to Fleetway.  I'm too lazy to blog the rest, but yeah basically the night was filled with lots of jokes, memories, and of course our farewells to Steph as she's leavin' for HK tomorrow...and not coming back for a month and a half =(.    We'll all miss you Steph...have fun in HK!   Anyways I'm out...plus I'm just too lazy to blog right now haha.  Later people.

       6/22/04 Lazy...REALLY lazy   Lazying around can actually be amusing, yet crappy. Today was probably the laziest day I've had this summer, with almost no sports included whatsoever, but meh other than that it was all good =). 'Sides after 3 straight hours of ball yesterday, a day of rest is good. Plus yesterday I FINALLY got a pair of Green Adidas Track Pants, though not the ones I was aiming for but hey it'll do for now =). Yesterday was actually a pretty long day when I think about it, waking up at 10am, sleeping at 3am. Then this morning...  I wake up at 12pm, after a well rested night. Jason was supposed to come over by this time, but apparently he didn't wake up until 1pm so yeah that was delayed a bit. So I went downstairs, ate, then did usual morning routine, sat around, and lazied about the house for a while. PS2 was the main form of entertainment for the majority of my afternoon. Lunch today consisted of "joak," which wasn't so bad I guess. Originally today I was going to go to see how I did on my exams, but then decided not to with laziness as the main motivator and sleep leading the way. So after lunch, I just sat around until Jason came, where afterwards we still played more PS2 haha.  Today though I found out that my uncle has a new sound card. Creative Audigy 2 or whatever...I know it's a whoop-ass card basically. I find it funny how he used to not care about his computer, and last few months he's bought 5-pc speaker system, grabbed my old monitor for larger desktop, and his video card. OH YEAH and a all-in-one printer, all within last 2-3 months.  That's almost 600 bucks or so spent on new compy junk. I found out this stuff when I went over to grab my Kill Bill back...but yeah recently all I got were speakers. 3 piece....I crumble to 5-pc systems.  Well when I walked back Jason just got there so yeah we PS2'd for most of the time. Then mom wanted to watch some TV so Jason went on compy while I went to grab some food. Jason was about to go to miniclip.com, but then I showed him the game "Defend Your Castle" on Arcadetown.com. Within minutes he was addicted the same way I was when I first started to play it, and then showed John the game and then he got addicted to it. Somehow though Calvin doesn't like it....which then led to this quote from Jason:  "So....let me get this straight. People who have an intelligence find this retarded game amusing, yet people who don't like to think don't like this game? WTF has this world come to?"  By the way, if you want to see the game,  urlLink here it is.   So after playing that game for an hour *yes we were bored, and I got tired of food GASP* we then returned to PS2, where then we played until Jason left around 6pm or so.  Afterwards I watched some TV, MSNed, and then called up Patrick to go play some ball. We played some 1-on-1, where I beat him 7-3. But then when we played a game with shots only....he won 7-5. Only reason why I came so close that game was because I fouled him whenever he shot, and did a lot of kickball that we never called hahaha. But that just shows how horrible my shot really is, which is why I have to work on it =P. Was funny watching Patrick try to do some handlin' skills...yeah he needs to work on that =P.  Well anyways yeah that was the most of my day, now I'm just bloggin', MSN, and probably gonna sleep soon. Gotta do devos tonight like I promised haha. Also gotta wake up for Job interview tomorrow...well volunteer. Library needs interviews however, so yeah pray for me guys n' girls for that, and also tomorrow goin' bowlin' with the HYPE kids...and and will also be the last time I see Steph =(....until August that is =P.  Anyways I'm out. Later.

       6/20/04 Happy Father's Day to all! Mmm Father's Day BBQ...   A day to commend the efforts and doings of the male population of society. I wonder if this can relate to our Spiritual Heavenly Father too haha. So today for Father's Day instead of headin' out for dinner like our usual family tradition my dad did what he likes to do the most on any day of the week: cook=P. Yeah up until now culinary arts is still one of my dad's favourite hobbies....besides R/C cars, Model Kits and cars of all sorts *I like that too now ^_^* he is also one of the best cooks in the world. I wish I had talent like him...so far my culinary advancements have taken me only as far as pizza pockets, Mac N' Cheese and eggs =P. OH YEAH and hotdogs and hamburgers...actually to think about it I've made everything that a McD's employee can back in grade 4 when my dad owned a fast food joint in Brampton. OK so maybe I can cook some things =P...I wanna learn good stuff though haha.  So today started off with me getting up at 830am for church. Got ready in 15 minutes and then headed out the door. Dad was making a list of food for this Saturday's church BBQ at London Life place down on Oxford. So we left, I read over the list *various types of Pah's, salads, kabobs, etc.* and I'm gonna help prepare the food again haha. The memories of last year when me and Gavin made the food....mixing the chicken, butchering the chicken, pretending I was a one of those "Siu Laap Po" people with a cleaver butchering the meat....I felt like a butcher =P. Obvious why. And so that's what I'll be doing for most of Friday evening...anyone wanna help make food =P?  So picked up Jason, and then off to church we went.  This morning Dave Butler did the Praise portion of our worship since apparently no one did it this week *shrug.* The message today was about honouring our Father's in society and of course of Heavenly Father. Pastor D also talked about the love that we should have in our Heavenly Father, and the faith that there is in Love. So he spoke of the 2nd miracle in John chapter 4 where Jesus heals the Official's Son. The Official begged for Jesus' help, and even had the faith to leave when Jesus said "Go, your son is healed." I mean it's pretty difficult to trust a random stranger to go home and believe in the theory of your child being healed by those words. I like that story also for its message of how Jesus doesn't just do good to those who are Christian, but even for Non-Christians. Afterwards the Official and his family did turn to Christ though, which is still cool. Yeah. And so after service...we all headed downstairs yet again like any other average Sunday =P.  One thing unique today though....FIRST HYPE NEWSLETTER! Rebecca's efforts paid off, and today marks isssue 1 of "What's the HYPE?" It's actually pretty cool I find, with little stories and stuff from people all over HYPE. Josh also put an advertisement for tenmore.net in =P. It's our new domain name which my blog will be moving to soon. Ahh...someplace where I can upload pics and stuff to make my drab layout that much better =P. Back on track though, so we had some refreshments, with stale cheesies being one of them. After some chattin' and stuff, we then headed to Bible Study.  Today we spoke of Daniel once again. Chapter two this time though. The story of him interpreting Nebuchadnezzar's dream. I think I spelled that right. Heard the story many times in my life, but it's still a good one. It's the one about the statue made of gold, silver, bronze, iron and clay; and then a boulder toppling it afterewards and establishing a mountain there. It was a metaphor of the kingdoms each getting weaker and weaker, and eventually the boulder, which represents God will establish the eternal kingdom as He is the ruler of all. Read about it in the Bible =P.  After church we chatted for a bit once again, Jason left with Rebecky and Josh for Dim Sum and I headed home.  Home...watched TV, and then slept ehehehe. Entertainin' no =P. WB Superstar's final episode I finally caught, and wow it sucks. Then dad came, watched some soccer, and the last bit of Superstar, then he went to start preparin' the BBQ and I went to sleep. PS2 wasn't exactly at the top of my list today, and instead I decided to nap and catch up on the missed sleep fron yesterday's staying up watching SNL and MSNing. And also watching Ghostbusters, which is an awesome movie =P. So anyways to my nap.  *Nap nap...3 hours later*  Waking up at 7pm, I go downstairs to a dinner of steak *mmm* and some chinese cucumber with meat dish *shrug.* Ate mostly steak and then some cucumbers haha, and then just sat around downstairs for a bit playing NBA Street Vol.2 for a bit. Me and Jason switched games for a bit, well for me gameS since I got NBA and NFL Street over here now haha. Meh he's beaten both games 3 times over at least anyways, and I haven't beaten NFSU once even sadly haha. Patrick then called for some ball at the park, so picked up my basketball and headed down to the park with him then.  My shot's finally kinda coming back! Somewhat demented still, but at least it goes TO the net now instead of the ground =P. Er...to the net before the ground. Anyways yeah so my shot's finally coming back slowly, and I need to work on driving again. Last summer I could at least make a layup on a fast break or even through traffic, and at  the moment I can't. So yeah work on that. Balled for about an hour, then came back to my place after some chatting outside about old times when Paul used to be around also. Go-Kart building that failed, the long train with escape hatch, gigantic slingshot, soybean milk launching water guns, yeah lots of old memories hahaha.  Anyways yeah so been on blogger since 10:30, still chattin' on MSN...and I may sleep early tonight haha.  Self Reminders: -Report card on 24th -Wednesday bowlin' with HYPE people -Ball at UCC more -Wish Jenn a happy b-day on July 2nd -Stop procrastinating devos everyday -Find a CD by Chicago....recently got into more Jazz-style music  Well I'm out. Later.

       6/19/04 Meh..   I feel lazy today, plus my day wasn't very extravagant, so yeah it'll be a somewhat short post today. All the time wasted so far though when I think about it since Wednesday, and I still haven't really done any of my devos. I feel kinda guilty now about that. I pray for God to clear out more time for me, and when I do have the time...I somehow waste it away either on the compy or doing some other stuff. Yeah I should really stick to my prayers and act upon them when God does something for me. So yeah back to doing my devos starting tomorrow. Oh yeah tomorrow's father's day too haha...almost forgot =P.  For my day today I started it off waking up at about 10:30 or so. Went downstairs and began to practice my piano in preperation for my last lesson of this school year. I sound like crap right now...having not practiced for two weeks hehehehe. SO did that, ate, and then headed out for lesson.  Basically was briefed today on how I should practice a wee bit over summer just to keep my skills in....and not forget them come September. I'm doing my exam in February, so yeah I better be able to do this stuff by then so this summer I will be in front of the keyboard a bit.  Got home and basically from 12pm-4pm I did nearly nothing but sit in front of comp, watch TV, ball, eat, and sleep, with those not in any particular order.  Jason then came over. We played some NBA Street and then went to HYPE.  Getting real lazy now, I'll summarize HYPE tonight real quickly:  -Sang some songs of praise -Ate -Chilled  Yup that's it. Now I'm bored and probably going to sleep. Later.

       6/18/04 Central 2004-2005 Tromboner *along with 3 others,* basketball...whoo what a day!   Though the title sounds like I didn't do much...really it took up the majority of the day haha. Proud to say though that I am now definitely in Central Jazz, I can't wait until next year =). And my balling skills are slowly on the climb again as I start balling at UCC more often now...yay two things done in one day =).  My day started off at 830 this morning, as I had to get up and go to my school for auditions. So had a bowl of oatmeal *meh* and then headed out the door with my trombone and the audition piece "Caravan" by Chicago. Yeah now, I know why people say that Jazz/Funk music is probably the best music of all time. I don't get how the heck it ever died out, but the music is actually amazing. I need a Chicago CD now, or Duke Ellington haha. I wonder where I can get this old school stuff. Ebay? Some old CD stores? Meh...it's good music though, I suggest you people go get it =). It's actually music worth buyin' unlike 50 Cent or Eminem, or those dreadful Making the Band people. American Idol is barely tolerable, the only reason why I give credit is because they actually have some talent.  Anyways off to my school, I get there around 930 or so. Fred, Craig, Garrett, Adam P. and Christian were already there workin' away at their parts of the music. Christian ran in to do his audition, while the rest of us continued practicing our pieces. Hmm...practice went well, and I found out today that I can easily hit two octaves now almost. Actually if it were on bass trombone I could do three octaves, but I only had my King Trombone with me today, so no F Attachment to make life easier. Anyways after Christian was done *which he made it in I think* Pourier went in to do his audition. I didn't hear much of it, but I did hear a few blips.  So after his audition he walked in and said "Joe, Wharton wants you to audition now." So then I walk in, and Pourier adds "Oh yeah, she wants me to spectate also." To my surprise though when I walk in, Wharton was surprised to see me volunteer *I'm usually the lazy one that waits* and also finds it funny why Pourier was still there. So after she finally found out what's happening, she boots out Pourier and then off I go with my solo.  She said my solo was well done, even though I think I sucked. But oh well no complaints from me...I'm in Jazz. And that's the story of the evolution of Joe from average tromboner to Jazz tromboner...summarized somewhat =P.  After the audition and returning home, picked up some food at McGreasePlatter and also at Angelo's. After grabbing the food, I finally get home, eat, and then hover in front of the computer for the next hour and a half, spreading the good news of being one of the 4 jazz tromboners in Jazz, just chatting, and trying to plan out both the Paramount thingy in July and also if I'm gonna go see dodgeball next week w/ Carmen, Josh and them.  Hmm well what I thought would be an hour and a half turned out to be two hours and a half in front of the compy, as I started playing Empire Earth again. Oi I gotta stop it's getting too much fun. Well after realizing that it's getting lame and also that it isn't good sitting in front of this box that long, I finally decide to go outside and play some ball.  After 45 minutes of ball or so, I return back to my house, cooled by the A/C and grabbed some stuff to eat. Drummed, played the piano for a bit, and before I knew it it was 5pm and it was time to go play ball.  Balling today was pretty fun/productive/hilarious. Met up with Jason and Calvin around 5 and then headed into the UCC. They actually have a anti-sneaking in system installed now...  One of those revolving metal pole thingies that are at the gates of almost every amusement park, except this one doesn't lock. It just makes a noise lol. Anyways cramming our junk into a locker, we head up to the gym...  And for some reason today was like Asian day or something. Two 4 on 4 games going on, and BOTH of them had 8 Asians on each court. Weird, usually it's a clan of black people or like a mix of cultures, but today it was as though Asia was the only existent continent. Anyways so we played some ball on our own first, but then we started a two on two game with this other dude, who was the only white guy there lol.  It started off with me and Calvin dominating 7-0. But I don't know what happened, afterwards we ended up losing 11-9. I think it was because I began shooting wild 3 pointers and since I'm not exactly the best perimeter shooter *I'm terrible* yeah we kinda lost lol. I made a few nice layups though plus set up one or two decent plays. But the highlight....I made 6 blocks in total, 3 on jason and 3 on the other guy. I'm like Ben Wallace, only I'm Asian, and I'm much poorer at ball than him =P. Blasted Jason and his clutchness....if he had lazied just 4 more points we woulda won. Oh well after that since the guy left, we decided to play a few games of American 21...  Where 2/3 of the games was total B/S lol. The first one was somewhat normal, with us alley-ooping one another a numerous amount of times, but the 2nd and 3rd game...Calvin won from shots from half court that we deemed as the "5-Point line." Yeah we twisted around the rules just a bit, making the foul line worth two points, 3 points from perimter and 5 points from half court haha. So even with 13 rule in, it was nearly impossible to actually fall for it. Anyways me and Jason pretty much lost all hope after calvin made 7 shots from half court in total from the 3 games, and so we began to foul one another to stop the onslaught of points coming from any of us....if we even had points left from the mass alley-ooping. So after two hours of pure chaos, including 2 on 2 games, American 21, and Kill, we finally tired out and all went our seperate ways home. Well I had to give Jason a lift since his dad wasn't home. Oh yeah also...NEW HIGH SCORE IN CHEESY CELL PHONE SOCCER GAME! 69 POINTS! EAT THAT! *yes I realize it seems like I have no life =P*  Anyways getting back, watched Zoolander on TBS, and began to play the piano. Argh last lesson of the year next week...the wretched practicing...so close to being done for the summer =).  Anyways back to keyboardin' the 88 keys.  Oh yeah before I close....list of things I forgot:  -record my madd trombone skillz for Jenn -Need new drumheads still -Go to the Athlete's World 50% off sale...if it's still happenin'. I need new shoes =P...Adidas Superstars.... -Make plans to see a movie next week.  Anywho yeah now I'm done for the night. Hehe later.

       6/17/04 Ahh...first full day of summer   Ahh yes the first full day of summer...embracing it with sleeping, tromboning *audition for jazz tomorrow* and much b-ball. Yeah with summer coming in out with books and papers and stuff and in with basketball, golf, and if I still know how...breakdance. Geez I haven't done that in almost 3 months now that I think about it. I wonder if I can do anything still...  My relaxing day started off at 11:30am....a HUGE change from school, and started with some music listening. Yeah why not waste time when I can =P. To think that when I woke up exam kids were already up for over 3 hours. Muahahahaha...killing time rules =). And so heading downstairs I check email, MSN, and then played some NSFU. Yeah not much to do today, since most of my friends still are in exams, or studying...or something. And so quickly grabbed some lunch, and then finally decided to go to UCC. I haven't done anything athletic in a while....so start now haha..  And getting there I start off playing some ball. Played some 3v3....but yeah I kinda died from lack of physical activity over last two months. So after an hour of ball, I decided to go work out then....since I haven't done that either in over 3 months lol. So yeah after doing that for an hour I was dead tired...so went home haha.  So for a while played EE, tromboned, then Jason called for more UCC. Meh why not? So yeah I got ready and then after some food and more trombonin', headed down to UCC.  Heh for some reason there was lots of fighting between the people playing ball today. Over the things from fouls, to travels, even people on the same team were arguin'. Also saw Ken and some other LCACers there, so played some baddy since bball courts were kinda fuller than in the daytime *THIS IS WHY YOU GO TO UCC IN THE DAYTIME JASON.* Well yeah after some of that played a one on one game of ball against Jason, which I claim victory winning 7-4 or something like that. Also...on top of that beautiful win, TWO BLOCKS! HAH!  Anyways yeah back home...gotta finish some more trombonin', talkin on MSN, and stuff... Trying to figure out when the whole6crew will meet in summer along w/ other TCers and of course the usual London people featuring David that come along with me to Paramount haha.  Anyways I'm out. Cheers to all of summer kids =).  Later.

       6/16/04 HAH! Monosaccharides and cosine law have been conquered!   FINALLY DONE EXAMS!  Actually it's kinda funny how I'm done all my exams before half the people I know have even started. In fact, Jenn's the only person that I can think of that finished exams before me. HEEHEE DONE! So today after going to the math exam *which I think was easy* I bid some people good summers, and then went on my merry way to...  Head 2 Head games.  Yup again lol. I think I've been there too much last 3 days...which is why I'm gonna stop for a while haha. Today though me and John headed there and played some Empire Earth, which took up most of the time. We started off though with some Quake III, where I got owned, well except by the bots I actualy came in 3rd outta six which isn't bad, seeing I've played the game only 'bout 10 times in my life. EE took up most of the time *over 2 hours* and in the end...WE MANAGED TO KILL ONE COMP! Yeah sad I know lol. After that played some BF, and then had to go home.  So here I am now...home...  Today and tomorrow I'm gonna be a hermit in my house, as I have to get my jazz audition piece up and ready by Friday morning. So back to tromboning haha...  Oh yeah...and after listening to the Chicago copy of "Caravan," yeah Chicago is now on "my favourite non eurodance people" chart. They're actually AWESOME. If you ever find it, listen to Caravan by Chicago...it is actually AWESOME.  Anyways as said before, back to tromboning...and adding Maisie's link onto my blog.  Later. FREEDOM AT LAST!

       6/15/04 MONOSACCHARIDE HAS BEEN CONQURED! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!   HAHAHA DONE AT LAST! I don't know how I did, but at 10:30am today, I FINALLY GOT RID OF THAT BLASTED EXAM! Biology if you haven't caught on. So yeah down with that...and now I'm studying for math =P.  For the rest of the day after exams, I pretty much did my volunteer hours of cleaning instruments. Fun times haha. Kelsey and Niki were there also, and they did trumpets while I cleaned trombones for the majority of the time. Went out to Subway for lunch, came back and cleaned some more and then headed home.  Yup...that was pretty much exam day one. Tomorrow: Math exam. And then I gotta practice my audition piece like hell for Wednesday and Thursday.  Anyways yeah I'm out for now. Probably studyin' for math for majority of day. Later.

       6/14/04 Monossacharide=Single sugar. Mitosis=Somatic cell division. Zygote=the result of sperm and egg meeting. Nucleotide=Sugar,phosphate, and nitrogeneous base. Spider Keys, Dichomotus keys, GAAH BIOLOGY!   This whole day has been revolving around SBI 3U1. Whether if it was the studying in the library, the one hour @ Head 2 Head games, or after school studyin' with Tehm and Lilian...it was biology. Yeah...this whole day my brain's been filled with stuff like the saccharides, cloning, the different systems in the human body, etc. And to think that after the exam tomorrow I gotta cram in the formulas for math. Not that that will be hard, but still it won't be that fun. Today wasn't bad though...the studying actually helped alot. Plus just having some quiet time in the morning reading out of the Daily Inspiration PDL *recently found out I got summarized version of PDL, which is already summarized. Therefore Summary of a summary* and sipping a large java from Timmy's and havin some timbits. It wasn't that bad, and I feel somewhat well prepared for tomorrow...if not totally haha...  So this morning I decided I'd wake up and head to library for morning studies at 9am. So ggot up at about 830, got ready and headed out the door. Bought timbits and coffee at Timmy's for breakfast and then headed to library with my food and books.  So started off my studies with a quick word of prayer, and then decided to read a few verses from PDL. Finished off the section about how we are all part of God's family, and re-read some of the previous stuff also. Then begun my studying...  Gargh....cramming all the biology from the whole year back in my head. At least I can focus today and not have a headache bugging me. So looked over old tests, filled in some wrong answers, tried some review. Apparently I know most of the stuff on the review, so I'm assuming I should be ok for the final evaluation. Plus the quizzes on Mr. Kimmel's site helped alot, so I should be ok for tomorrow. An hour and a half quickly zoomed by, and before I knew it I had to make the descision of whether I should go to school or not. Eventually I decided I would, so I packed my things and trekked my way to school.  Music class today...yup about 6 of us lol. Thompson called 10 mins into class not realizing class started, and then quickly drove down to school. Today we just sorted out music, and listened to Niki's Eagles CD. Justin brought his guitar, and played a few things, and yeah 40 minutes passed real quickly. Gave away the crappy Timbits that I dared not to touch *the plain ones* and also chatted with the others guess you can say one last time before summer started.  Science I didn't really go to since well basically no one was there. only 5 of us, so me, John and Hammond said a thanks to Mr. Curphey *he was an awesome teacher* and then me and John and Pourier would head to Head 2 Head...had to fuel my craving for BF Vietnam. For some reason I felt like gaming lol. But before leaving I read this:   Curphey's Law  1. I am always right 2. If I am ever wrong, refer to rule 1 3. I am perfect 4. If you disagree, refer to rule 1 to 3   I thought that was great. Oh yeah him and Mrs. Wharton both got these funny award certificates from the group known as the "United Pricks." It was the thing used for their 007 film on film night, consisted of Fed, Matt Brown, Dave Rutt and some other gr. 12's that are graduating. The awards were pretty funny though.  Anyways like I said we got bored so we went off to Head 2 Head games to play some BFV. While there today I grabbed a 1 month membership just to try it out, plus it was a deal. Free half hour and I only had to pay 2 bucks for the extra half hour needed to make a full one hour. Plus I got a membership ^_^. Starting BFV, which took a while, we finally got underway after about five minutes, since we had some server problems and for some reason the computers kept rebooting for no reason. As I mentioned before this whole ady was about biology, so me being the geeky biology freak I decided to make my largely intimidating BFV name "Monosaccharide." Anyways so we played for an hour, and then I headed back to school for some bio review since I had bio then.  There were 10 of us in that class lol. Yeah so went over a few questions. I FINALLY GET PROTEIN SYNTHESIS! All thanks to this really weird puzzle thing Ms. Wiener had. Also I feel special that I know taxonomy...and I got to help people w/ it haha. Usually I'm the pretty stupid one...BUT I ACTUALLY KNOW STUFF NOW! Muahahaha! Pretty much only gr. 10's where there, but meh we still got some review packed in. After bio me, Tehm and Lilian then went to the library to study. Ok correction...Tehm Lilian and I, for those English freaks out there.  Arriving at the library around 130...ish, we get there and immediately dive into our books. That was when I realize at 2pm that I had to run back to school to order my CD's still lol. So ran back to school, and then quickly ran back to the library in 10 minutes or so *our school and the library is very close.* Tehm went to grab 4 burger from Arby's in total through the time plus some various other foods, while for some reason my craving for some proteins, carbs, cholestrol, lipids etc. died out while studying. We talked about lots of stuff, from Chinese restaurants to Tehm and Lilian talking about the weird people they see walking in and out of the public washroom that was facing our study table. Yeah like I said...WIDE variety of talking subjects haha. So after two hours of studying, we all went on our different paths to our homes.  Arriving home, I finish up some brief studying, watched some TV, drummed, relaxed a bit, ate, and also managed a 30 minute nap.  Waking up at 8pm, I showered and once again resumed my studying. From then till now (11:37pm) I've been cramming in stuff like capillary fluid exchange, plants, and other stuff into my head once again. Pray for my bio exam if you people can, and back to my studying hehe.  Good luck on your exams too people.  Later.

       6/13/04 Gah..sick for the most part   So wasn't exactly the study crammed Sunday I intended, but more of a day of sleep. For some reason I was sneezing a lot today, cept I held them in, so yeah my head felt like it was going to pop. So for the most part today I slept....but before that...  I woker up this morning at around 8am, and then quickly got ready for church. Had to bring towercase again since I was too lazy *and also didn't think of this* to put powerpoint on two floppy disks and then bring it to church. So instead I just unplugged everything and brought it to church. Jason didn't answer his door this morning when I went to give him a lift to church, which the story will be explained later. It's really very interesting how he didn't answer the door. Anyways got to church at about 830...  But for some reason only Gavin was there. So when I asked him where she was, he just shrugged and said "I don't know." So yeah...by 8:50 we had to call Carmen and tell her she's not doing worship this week. Wasn't the coolest thing to do, but she didn't show up and we had to practice, so we had to do what was done. So worship started around 915 as usual, and we didn't do too bad for just drums and guitar and Gavin on vocal.  I couldn't get full message of second coming today as I was running back and forth with a somewhat runny nose, but I got for the most part that He IS coming soon, but we should always be prepared, since God will not be coming on schedule, but by surprise. The Bible uses the analogy of a thief coming without notice. So yeah...be prepared haha. Carmen and Jason came a bit late but they still managed to make it. Mike got an I-Pod which is shweet...hmm yeah that's all I can really remember. Oh yeah and after service they pointed out that for the song "I can only imagine" I forgot to put in lyrics....OOOH SO THAT EXPLAINS WHY NO ONE WAS SINGING...Haha whoops =P.  So yeah going downstairs I asked Jason if he just slept in this morning. Apparently not...  He explained that when I went to ring on his doorbell...he thought today was Monday. Yeah I know sounds farfetch'd, but he pretty much thought "wth? Who would ring my doorbell at 830 on a Monday? Screw that I'm gonna sleep." A while later he then woke up and wondered why his mom wasn't at work. Then he finally turned on his TV and saw it was Sunday. That was when he thought "Uh Oh...CRAP!"  That was the story of Jason's morning. Carmen's I don't know. Like usual though she was poking me to death, with my defense of flailing arms almost working MUAHAHA! Anywho, me Calvin and Dan and Mike then went outside to throw around the football for a bit, and then Bible Study started.  Today we started studying Daniel. You know the story, how he got taken to Babylon, etc etc. Personally I didn't learn a lot today, but I did learn something new at least. I never really noticed the courage Daniel had to even request for a different food from the King. Normally you'd think people would take what the King has given, but he objected to the King to not go against his own morals.  So after lesson chilled for a bit, I learned power G chord on guitar and then I had to go home.  Lunch at home was alright....some celery dish w/ mushrooms and pork. Meh...and rice of course. So after lunch played some SC, but for some reason a killer headache was beginning to form, so I quickly stopped and headed upstairs for some sleep.  *four hours later*  Waking upt at 9, I then realize that the house is pretty quiet. Apparently dad went to sleep, and dinner was made a while back. So quickly ate, and from then until now I have been studying for biology. Argh so much stuff I still must cover. Anyways I'm out for now....gotta study for bio still haha.  Later.

       6/12/04 First Saturday of holidays...aah   Awesome day today. To me, I thought today was a great way to start off my summer. Filled with fellowship, worship practice, and just chillin' with the rest of the HYPE kids. Even though some of them are studying their minds out...there were still a few of them that came to the meeting at my place tonight. Hmm.....as for the rest of my day...  I awoke around 930 today to start my weekend. Now I had to be at the church by 10am to do worship practice w/ Gavin and Carmen, so yeah I had 15 minutes to get ready then bolt out the door. so breakfast, teeth brush, washed face, got dressed, then headed out.  Go to church around 10am...whoo on time! So we started rehearsal right away, yeah sorta skipped prayer....but oh well it's over with now. So this week's theme was on the 2nd coming of Christ, so songs were HARD to choose for this week....VERY HARD. Eventually we got through though. Songs we picked this time contrast in tempo a lot...two jamming songs and then two slower songs, and another one. I like response song this week though. It's the one that's titled "I Can Only Imagine." I think it's awesome song. Oh yeah...then me and Gavin had this inside joke going. Carmen was singing pretty quietly, so Gavin kinda died out from singing, and then I was saying how it sounded like all of a sudden only drums could be heard, so then Gavin made this 1 man Jam...argh too bad I can't show over blog, but it was funny haha. Practice went by pretty quick...and 12pm came just on time...like usual. I wonder why =P...  So getting home...just sat around for a bit before Josh and Lina came over to study for bio. Yeah....Josh surprisingly doesn't know a whole lot lol.   "Uhh...guys is X the boy?"   Oh but one of the funnier ones...   "Ok Josh what's external respiration?" *Josh inhales and exhales*   He did the same for internal also and cellular...but with some hand clapping haha. It was pretty fun time studying...some jokes and some knowledge crammed into head. Hmm....so yeah 3pm...Lina had to go back home, and Wenders and Ken came over for prestudy before HYPE tonight. So yeah my house has been the centre of events today =P.  Prestudy went fairly well. ME AND JOSH LED STUDY TODAY! Well....did the main leading w/ help from Wendy and Ken. It was fun =P. So we did prestudy, then ordered pizza. Mmm.....pizza ^_^. So good. Well actually Ken and JOsh went to his place to print off some handouts and then also went to pick up pizza. Wendy and I stayed at my place and looked at old pictures and stuff.  Hmm yeah...today would be the first time I had anchovies on pizza in my life. It tasted...well fishy. Oh yeah and REALLY salty. We all vowed to have a slice of anchovy pizza....BUT THEN WENDY BROKE HER VOW! Well sorta...she nibbled one anchovy and then left the rest to rot. The rest of us had two slices each. Pineapple, Mushroom and italian sausage was good though. Jason came early and got a slice too. Then Calvin and Becca came. Oh  yeah today Becca and Lina for some reason both used my printer to print stuff, as slow as it is. 'Cept even after I told them not to use black ink...THEY DO ANYWAYS. So yeah they had to REPRINT EVERYTHING and wasted over 20 sheets of paper. Ugh....smart people *not*...  So then HYPE started. Only Steph, Gavin, Calvin, Becca, Jason and Brian showed up today. Plus Josh and counselors. So yeah leading was pretty fun today. First time in my life actually doing it semi independent...it was cool =P. I could delegate people to do things haha =P. It kinda reminded me of back when I was little using training wheels on a bike...I sorta got the hang of riding the bike but still had help. Actually more like riding a bike with training wheels and a rollcage....I could still fall probably...but if I would have fallen the rollcage would protect me =P. Point was it was fun...and educational. Now I know how hard it is to teach things haha.  Then after HYPE...ate food and then most of the guys went to ball. I was kinda lazy so chatted w/ Wendy, Becca and Steph 'bout a whole bunch of random things. From Troy to whether I could cut Rebecca's hair; but I'd have to shave my legs for the price...yeah the whole potpourri of stuff. It was pretty funny though...Wendy started complaining about how Hector in Troy was missing a teeth...I was surprised she could notice that lol. It reminded me of the time when Adrian pointed out that Trinity used Linux to hack into the power grid....OI how the heck can you notice that?! Yeah we also had some laughs...HYPE was pretty funny tonight. Oh yeah and also Wendy was saying how she was getting fat even though she's as skinny as Steph, and then me and Becca had convo about Spoonfaces and Girlie shorts...yup.....very spirited convos.  Yeah so after hearing ehough of their talk, I finally went outside and played some ball. Hard to see a black basketball at night. Anyways played American...Calvin won, then Jason, and then yeah they all had to go.  And here I am now working on tomorrow's slide show and finishing up blog....and MSNing. Well I'm out. Later.

       6/11/04 WHOO! SCHOOL'S OUT!   FINALLY! After....many days of school...IT'S OVER! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! SO HAPPY! No more lugging around a backpack to school and stuff. In fact, after Wednesday, I won't have school for another 3 months....shweet =). So yeah....so far I've planned out following for summer:    -Volunteer @ Library for July -Chill w/ homies and homelies -Toronto in August -Canada's Wonderland w/ the 6crew and the usual people *you know who you are* -Anime Convention?   I doubt the last one I'll do...since I'm not that big of a fan of anime anyways. Sad...Melissa and Robert in my programming class already know more anime than me...and you know the stereotype of Asians liking anime....well I don't =P...except MT...and Chobits I guess I can tolerate a bit now.  But yeah...last day of school was pretty unproductive...but fun =P.  History and Civics we watched Shrek. Angela and some other person walked into civics for no reason and just sat there....whatever last day of school who cares =P. Final civics and history project got perfect, and civics exam I got 86%. SHWEET I MAY BE 85%+ AVERAGE STILL =). It all depends on english...come on don't go under 70 =). If it stays in 80...I almost have 90 average. GRRRRR.....  Lunch today....went to Jasper's one last time. Got a bagel and cream cheese to save money haha =P. It's actually pretty good. I can understand why white people like it for breakfast...it's actually good stuff. I like it now hehe. Hmm...it may be a breakfast thing next year =P. Kinda like coffee...cept parents seem to hate it.  Then math class. me still being hungry, I got some people *me, Saika and Mophead* to order a pizza. So the 3 of us went to call at a phone booth since reception blew downstairs. Ms. Davidson found it funny how "calling home" required three people. So in the end we ordered a cheese pizza from Pizza Pizza. Too bad it never came...blasted crap service. We even named the EXACT room. Room 114, London Central Secondary School. Mr. Gilbert really never knew what was happening till then end of class, when Nick warned him:  "Nice havin' ya for a teacher Mr. G. Oh yeah....if a pizza comes here tell him you're Mr. Freeman"  Hmm while waiting for the pizza, me, Jess and Maggie began lookin' at each other's cellphones. Whitaker has a sweet phone...it's the Sony Ericsson w/ the analog digital clock. It's kinda feminine phone though. Hmm....Courtney's charades game died pretty quickly....yeah math class was entertaining. A few people still did review..but yeah other than that nothing heh. Hmm next year I got chem and physics with Sarah Wild also found out, and music w/ Maggie also. So let's see...in music we've got Shaunvir, Christian, Leanna, Arjun, Kurtis, and Maggie...well that I know of. Hmm interesting. Surprises are always good =P.  Programming......only like 15 people so we did jack squat. Got tests back...87%,100%, and 96%. So programming mark is gonna skyrocket =). Hmm....yeah for the rest of the time just chatted with some people, and got to kinda know that 9er girl Monica that's in my programming class. Apparently she's really hyped up about marks...probably more than the average Asian @ Central....which is somewhat surprising. I say somewhat because that one "Asian Posse" is like "gangsta..." least they sure think so....HAHAHAHAHAHA that's funny. Anyways...  So school ended early today @ 1:30 for year end assembly. This year just many goodbyes to teachers, including our Principal Mr. Scanlon, Mr. Curphey *the ultimate science teacher,* and the infamous Mr. Krisak. Apparently Scanlon's a Christian, and Krisak seems to believe in a God. Found that kinda interesting. So the assembly had a few tears, lots of talkin', and farewell speeches. OH YEAH how could I forget. Mr. Endo's leaving too! I was looking forward to physics with him. He's our badminton coach also...but he is retiring. Ugh I don't want Doba for physics...football coach + physics? How did that ever work? Anyways, After the assembly...  Me, Mophead and Jason then headed down to Head 2 Head games for some gaming. Meh this is how I started Christmas holidays too lol. So gamed for 3 hours. Got owned in Empire Earth by compies, and BFV was fun like usual =P. Nothing as exciting as last time when the boats sank though...this time we actually played well and won =P. Grr...I really want a new comp now >_  TODAY WAS GRADUATION. WTH!? I THOUGH SCHOOL'S OVER! Well yeah for some reason they had some graduation thing today. THE ONE DAY WE CHOOSE TO PLAY BALL THEY HAVE GRAD. Ugh how ironic is that? So yeah we ended up going to my place...walking back since mom had to pick up dad since car was in shop. Got back home around 7pm...mom was kinda surprised we balled so quickly, so explained what happened. so PS2 for the time at my place, and compy. Not much since Jason had to leave an hour later.  So gave him a lift back, came back home, ate, did some other stuff...and here I am now. Joy, Gerts, and Jenn all find my water-noise thing that I make flicking my cheek pretty amusing. All of them got some laughs out of it hehe. Oh yeah also turns out the May Tang I met at the Orientation is ANOTHER May Tang...so different one from the one on my MSN list haha.  Anyways I'm out for the night. Gotta study for some bio, maybe math, and hit the hay. Gotta wake up at 9 tomorrow to do worship practice with Carmie and Gavin. Hmm...oh yeah tomorrow Lina and Josh comin' over too for "mad" bio studying. Then HYPE hehe. Later people....and have a good summer to all! =).

       6/10/04 Savouring the final days of gr. 10   Hmm....gr. 10 year did pass by really quickly. Not that I'm pissed at that in fact I can't wait to go into gr. 11. being a senior next year, as mentioned by Gloria "WE'RE GETTING OLD!" haha and also the senior music trip.......always awesome =). So yeah...final days of gr. 10 are spent cramming for bio and math. Great eh =P.  Well my day started at the usual 730. It's kinda funny to think I used to leave my house at 730 back in early grade 9. Heh now I wake up then, and then get to school by 810. Well gave Patrick a lift also, and we got to school as I said by 810. I had to photocopy my solo for Mrs. Wharton, and then after that rushed downstairs to do what rehearsal I could.  Before I knew it the last music class of the year begun =(. Oh well...did my solo. I was 4th. I got a 89 for it...not bad. I was expectin sometin worse...but 89 is good I guess lol. I'm volunteering to help clean up after bio exam on June 15th, hmm and yeah we also got rice krispie squares =P. Mmmm.....food ^_^.  So science basically we did nothing. No notes, just talked and stuff. John got "Penis John" written on his back by Nick Saika who was "just" writing John haha. Hangman was a popular game...7 up died after 2 rounds lol. Hmm.....dunno what else happened. Today was pretty relaxing...nothing to do at all. Lunch came and I went to study w/ Hammond for bio.  Lunch yeah we studied. Hmm.....yeah Hammond needs some work on biology. I do also...but I knew more than him hehe. I need to learn more taxonomy...and stuff. And DNA...yeah I need to relearn that. So far biochem and the systems i've conquered =P.  Bio.studied. And somehow we began to talk about movies lol. Underhill, Drew and Okanski were in their own group, and somehow me, Robert, Melissa, Tehm, Rachel, and Lilian began talking about movies also lol. Lily gave us some fortune cookies...mmm cookies ^_^ and then we kept on talking about movies. We all agreed Dodgeball looks funny and Texas Chainsaw Massacre *though I've yet to see it* is retarded. Just hearing about the crappy slasher film makes me not wanna see it hehe. Oh yeah Tehmina was talking about some part in the Ring about the horse falling off a cliff...yeah she said she was as MSN lazy people say "lmao." I'm really lazy so yeah...and also this points out how the english language has been butchered. Totally off subject but I thought I'd point it out =P.  English...FREE MEAL! We had our cafe today...so basically I got a lunch for free =P. Watched a bit of some movie "Ms. Dodgefire" or sometin. Pretty funny. Robin Williams is in it. I wanna see the rest of it =P.  After school went to study for math a bit w/ Steve, then headed for home.  Yeah....that was pretty much my last day two of the year. I'm not going to school on Monday since it's redundant. Argh well until Ms. Wiener said we get to see our marks Monday. So I may just drop in Monday for bio and then leave again lol.  Anyways I'm out for now. Later.

At last I'm done my history and stuff...and now all I'm going to be doing is cramming for math and biology exam. WHOO HOO! Yeah school year is coming to an end...I'm so excited. Gr. 10 was such a quick year. In no time I'll be in university...kinda scary when I think about it =S. Oh well...that's for another time...right now I got other things to do.  This morning history presentation I think went well. We had locker cleanout, and Christian showed me a 2000 yearbook of our school. Apparently we had a golf team. Hmm.....I didn't have much to clean out so threw out a few papers and that was basically it. Oh yeah I also got my timetable for next year:   Day 1 -gr. 12 bio -Gr. 11 chem -Music -Gr. 11 Law  Day 2  -Physics -PAS -Math -English   Civics....lost election =( lol.  And now to summarize the rest of my day since I gotta cram for bio:  Math...review programming...slacked off practiced for music after school....solo tomorrow =S bus ride home...slept on bus, traffic jam from a car accident up ahead then went to Library volunteer orientation  Hmm apparently at the library thing.....I saw Melody....and this girl May Tang I think Carmen knows...and someone that used to be on my MSN list. Wait I think she still is on...but point is I've never met her lol.  Anyways back to studying for bio.  Btw...need prayers for exams haha. Thanks for those who are prayin' for me=P.  Later.

       6/8/04 3 more days...come on   Everyday is another day gone, and closer to the summer break. Gah...why must it be so long? Oh well....savouring my last few days as gr. 10 hehe....today wasn't that bad. Late start dah =). Yup that means I wake up at 830 for school and I'm still not late =P.  SO got up this morning at 830, did you know the usual stuff. Eat, hygiene, get dressed, etc. and headed out the door around 840. Had to go there a wee bit early to rehearse with Niki and Kelsey for their solos today in music. So got there, practiced a bit...  And then the moment of truth. Yup...solos. I don't go till Thursday, but Kelsey and Niki went today so I had to do the piano. I think they did alright. I screwed up a few times, and when I played w/ Kelsey she came in maybe a bar early so we were out of sync for a bit. Oh well...other than that it went well =). On the whole, most of the class sounded good.  Science: we finished soil lab. Oh yeah did my speech today...it sucked haha.  Lunch...ahh for once I went out again. To Jasper's I went, where I had a philly steak wrap. Mmm.....so good....downed it with water since I ran outta money =P.  Bio class we started review. Hmm....yeah I think I'm screwed for the exam....I forget everything we are reviewing lol. I'm not the only one though. Our whole class forgot about hormones that help with digestion (i.e. Insulin).

Today also was D-Day's 60th anniversary, game 1 between Lakers and Pistons, and Patrick Sackville's birthday. Yeah so a lot can happen in one day haha. Today @ Church was alright too...great speaker. Hmm then history project...our Heritage Minute...  Yeah that pretty much sums up my day. I made a whoop-ass civics brochure....and yeah I'm done for now haha.  Later.

       6/5/04 Good start...not so great finish   Ok so my Saturday was going about well...in fact, I even thought it was an awesome first Saturday of June =). Well until my mom brought back beef from like two weeks ago. I mean SERIOUSLY you'd think you could let go of stuff that happened two weeks ago...but nope not my mom. She seems to just LOVE bringing back things that happened two and a half weeks ago and seem to be like "HAH LOOK YOU'RE WRONG!" Do I care? Not really...the only thing I really care about is if someone can come up with constructive criticism. I mean...if someone calls me an idiot and points out the reason...obvious or not I can tolerate. But when people are calling me crap like that for no reason....or one of those "reasons" that just HAPPEN to be so "obvious" it can't be told...   BULLSHIT!   ...Yeah this blog is going to get a little bit more positive....BUT HONESTLY it's so friggin stupid when I get home after watching Troy...and my mom brings up random shit from two weeks ago about how a damn gas station lane at that one stupid gas station is single lane, or for some reason the time when I thought worship wasn't that great. Yes the subjects varied that much....I mean SERIOUSLY. There are times when I can tolerate this...but when she adds in random words like "idiot," "retard" or other various synonyms for those words....yeah I can get ticked off. Is it right? I doubt it...I mean God I don't think liked it...but does he REALLY like people that ridicule others without reason or with one of those "UGH IT'S SO OBVIOUS" reasons. If it's so damn obvious help the person by explaining to him how obvious it is. Why leave a fellow soldier drag along on his wounded way when you can help him? Who cares if it's OBVIOUS that the wound isn't that severe...help the person....and not make the wound bigger by jabbing at it with a 9 inch blade....or in the argument case by ridiculing them even more. Ugh it took at least two hours before my mom finally stopped with her blabbering. Oi....two hours of pointing out random stuff that don't even relate...and when I DO come up with a relevant point it's off to subject #29103948576: Why I'm apparently a poor driver. Heh funny I don't drive since I don't have a license....makes a lot of sense. Like I said....lots of irrelevant subjects....some I laugh at in my head when she brings them out. Others I'm surprised she can bring up beef from 4 months ago.  Anyways....enough with hearing 'bout my negative b/s....the rest of my day is awesome. I always do try to live up to one of my favourite Bible passages...you know the one about how I should love my neighbours and enemies, and also speaks of how revenge is never good. Matthew 5:38-48:   An Eye for an Eye  "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.  Love for Enemies  "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.   Anyways to start my Saturday...positively =)  I woke up today around 11am after last night from chattin' a wee bit too long on MSN. Well getting up, I was gonna practice piano, but decided to try out trombone practice for new Jazz audition song. "Caravan" by Duke Ellington. I don't know what it sounds like...so I went on Kazaa hoping for a listen. Well....apparently people don't know it either so there's 8 different songs with the same name and composer. So now I'm hoping I got the right one...and gonna figure it out on my own also haha. So by 12:25 though...I had to leave for piano...  Piano....hmm not much since I'm not doing exams. NO lesson next week =P and also apparently she wants me to start gr. 9 music. *Shrug*  Getting home...Jason got here as he needed a lift to Springbank, so we played some Underground, and I played some DDR before he came. Unlocked NISSAN 350! WHOO! Though for some reason it sucks more than the Sentra, and RX-7...meh I got it anyways for the looks lol. So after 15 minutes of that...we had to go to the Park. Picked up Lina and then we were off...  While on the car  ride....we were talking about my idea for a car washing mechanism that resembles the window washing system in your car. Yeah...my idea is to put those little black things on the sides of your car above the windows and spray the car every once in a while. Yeah after hearing some doubts...and now thinking back on it...it can't work lol.  Got to the park around 2:15...and apparently I'm not the only one that hasn't arrived =P. Carmen wasn't gonna be there for another while, and Gavin and Steph just got there. Ken had an exam so he came a bit later. So we started off with a word of prayer that I said, and then we dug in, since Carmen was gonna be 30 minutes late, and Ken was at an exam for now. Well afterwards Carmen somehow just showed up...it was kinda weird because once I turned around POOF she was there lol. Kinda like the time when out of nowhere Jason walked in my house and I just yelled "HOLY SHIT!" And so she brought sandwhiches, I brought the veggies and fruit, Josh and Becca brought cake, Lina brought drinks, Gavin and Jason brought noodles, and Ken and Steph would bring appetizers. I liked the picnic, and we actually had a decent amount of food =P. Lots of leftovers.  So after the eating, we sang some songs of praise, and then went on with lots of freetime. Some of us started playing w/ a volleyball, while others began their wars with water. While the war was going on for the first half, I was playing Gavin's guitar trying to learn some new chords. Well in the end I helped Kendrick learn a few new chords in my "broad" knowledge of the guitar and yeah he learned D and G from me lol. I didn't really get involved in the water gun fights until Rebecca shot me while I was playing Gavin's guitar. Getting annoyed with water going down my back I finally took up a bottle of water and chased Rebecca whipping water at her. Then after that ran out I quickly took my somewhat defective gun and dumped it on her, causing her to run further than I've ever seen her run before lol. The real highlitht had to be though, the triple team on Carmen lol. Josh was reloading, so she was about to run for him....er shoot but then Gavin comes from behind, grabs her so she can't do jack, and then I dumped a bucket of water on her =P. Yeah she got soaked pretty much from that....not that she wasn't already but she was whatever is beyond soaked lol. Hmm I remember the whole war though starting with Gavin totally soaking Lina, then all the girls just chased him. Wendy almost lost a contact but then I pointed out it was in her goggles that she was wearing lol. She lost one anyways though in the end. Hmm oh yeah then afterwards near then end before I had to go....  Wendy: Ok guys let's stop....we gotta go soon stop refilling"  *Starts shooting me and Gavin*  Yeah we were helpeless and Wendy shot us....and we couldn't reload since we had to go soon lol. So while we were about to leave...all of a sudden my day changed. Instead of jamming @ home w/ Gavin and Dan....well we decided to go see Troy lol. Well Dan wasn't home, so couldn't really jam w/ just a guitar and drums. So we went to see Troy.  Well I had to go home first to change, so Ken said he'd come grab Lina and me at my place. However apparently my mom seems to think that having a girl at my place while she's not there wasn't too cool....so in the end she seemed to blame me for her being late because she can't really trust me. Bleh oh well in the end we got to the movies. Ken came around the corner with a powerslide, and literally making Rebecca petrified lol. Gavin Josh and Jason were like the usual guys though......"YEAH POWERSLIDE!" Yeah I was thinkin' it was awesome too, but in the end mom drove us since Ken's plan was to drive the 7 of us in a Jetta lol. Well it was kinda my family's fault...since originally he was gonna take them to Silvercity first then come grab me and Lina, but yeah since my mom called telling him to hurry up he hurried...literally lol.  We finally got to Silvercity around 6:30 or so, where we bought tickets and milled around the mall until 7. BLAST! SC Ghost is delayed till December! However DDR Extreme is comin' out September 23rd! Can't wait for that =). That'll keep me entertained until SC Ghost =P. Well 7pm came around fast...and off to watch Troy.  Movies to look out for from previews: King Arthur, some movie about demon fighting ft. Keanu Reeves, Ocean's 12...or w/e the title's gonna be lol. So yeah...after those previews...MOVIE!  Hmm throughout movie made fun of it...lol. Well it was a good movie just that there were a lot of things that me and Jason made fun of. Like the thing of how it'd be funny if the fire burning the corpses ignited the igniter, or how "them Trojans be treadin' on A-dawg's turf." A dawg being Achilles. Yeah the movie was good though...with many sad and cool parts. I also realized Shakespeare ripped like half of Romeo and Juliet from Troy. Woman loves man from the enemy, they fight, THEY EVEN HAVE IDENTICAL NAMES! Prince Paris was the most obvious one...I mean if I were Shakespear I'd at least make the name different to make it less obvious. The movie's fight scenes were AWESOME though. Achilles apparently has a 2 meter vertical with armour on. Wow he'd rule the NBA =P. Plus he owned everyone on the battlefield...until the wussie Prince Paris killed him when he was saving a Trojan woman. That part I found somewhat lame...though the real story goes like that apparently. Bummer. Hmm plus was pretty cool with the one on one battles between soldiers to determine victory or no. Prince Paris did lose to the King of Sparta, but wussed out of the battle and then had his bro kill the King of Sparta. Oh well....yeah the movie was good...won't reveal anymore...go watch it =P.  Well getting home...yeah then it loops back to the beginning of my entry where mom began her unproductive lecture.  Meh... oh well...gotta head to sleep now. I'm thankful though that Christ at least made my day mostly enjoyable, despite the two hours of crap. But hey...2/24 hours...that's nothing. Not even 10% of my day...so I don't really care for it. Totally sucks how Calgary lost tonight though. Oh well least I can see game 7 now haha. But yeah I really wished Calgary won tonight....I mean who cares if I saw it or not I care more about if they won or not. Like my dad said I can see the highlights on the news or some sports channel =). But yeah...as you can see the rest of my day was pretty awesome. Soaking people with water, eating food, learning more stuff about guitars, and watching Troy...another flick off the checklist. Now for Garfield and Dodgeball =P..  Later.

       6/4/04 Ahh...school life has never been closer to an end =)...for ths year   Ahh yes....only 5 more days of oppresion and then it's freedom. Well except for the exams...but those don't count =P. Oh yes the sweet smell of freedom just around the corner. It can be mocking, yet assuring =). Just to think in a matter of a week, i don't have to worry about waking up at 730am anymore, or getting to school on time. Ahh yes...in a matter of 5 days, all I have to worry about is studying for bio and math, and playing PS2, balling, and back to my summer workout schedule...yup....and of course just chillin'. Also I find in the summer I sometimes have the best times doin devos and gettin closer to Christ. Nothing in your mind to get you off track =P.  Well for another day of school...  Today in music we had some stupid theory test. Mr. Boldt the retard still doesn't seem to understand how to write scales, so our whole class is doing it wrong. I tried to correct him, as well as some other students, but him being the old head of the Laurier music departnment, he's an idiot. Plus....LAURIER S.S....I bet an average Central student knows more about music than that guy. Oh yeah and afterwards....we used insufficient tools to clean the instruments...well more like 3 trumpets. It was pretty stupid...  Science: Studied dirt. Yup.  Lunch: Kelsey WAS supposed to come practice, but in the end she didn't really come....so I ended up talkin' to Dave Rutt a lot about senior music...well he's graduating and I'm plannin' to do jazz band, wind ensemble...you know the works =P. Sight read Jessica Winegart's piece while she was waiting for Freddy Wu...who came afterwards. Then I practiced my solo for a bit...and then left.  Bio....watched videos and did some homework.  English: Presentations.....bleh. I do mine next week =P  And then after school had to practice Niki's solo with her. That went pretty good...and then after that...well I got bored...didn't feel like busing...so went to Jason's house lol.  ....Yeah so I walked there with my l33t sense of direction and then arrived at his place around....yeah 330 or so. We walked down to Rogers Video then and rented some RPG game and also stopped by at A&P to end my craving for cheesebuns lol. I don't know why...yesterday @ A&P though...I saw cheesebuns and had a real craving for them. So I bought some today, since I didn't have a lunch today anyways and managed to munch on 3 of them before we got back to Jason's place.  Watched a episode of Friends *he has the season packs* and then started playing the game. Forgot what it's called...but it resembles Gauntlet a lot. Heh me and David played that for GC a lot so I got hooked on this game pretty quick lol. Resembles D2 more though...but pretty good I thought. Wish we had gotten NBA Ballers...but they didn't have copies *blast.* So afterwards Jason then ate two of my remaining 3 cheesebuns, and I had my final one on my way home when Dad picked me up around 6pm or so.  Then got home...and here I am now. Drummed, ate some food, ate some more food, chatted w/ Gerty, Maisie and Ju on MSN for a bit...and then...yeah....that's pretty much it. Gonna SC soon I think. I have no will to go to UCC tonight....beat tired.  Hehe cya.

Can't really write much today either...had to do SOO much crap today....but yeah basically the main highlight of today...civics class was kinda funny with our commercial filming, but most of all for today...  I got cut from LYS.  Least I think so....ugh I had horrible audition. I think Shaun might have done better than me even...oh well doubt either of us made it...we don't got private teachers and are tenor-clef illiterate. So yeah....now back to bio h/w.

       7/31/04 July....gone....August....almost here.....   Hmm today wasn't that bad of a Saturday. Actually something pretty eventful occured...not for me...but for my church.  As usual, patience and prayer come through, and God once again shows His mighty hand working within our church.  I woke up this morning to some chatter going on downstairs. Dad apparently had Pastor Ming Wong over and Pastor Kwong over to discuss the merging of WLAC and LCAC over brunch. At first when I heard about this, I was thinking I'd never want that to happen. Then I thought more carefully about our current situation in our church, and maybe it wouldn't be so bad after all. I mean, it may seem like a crummy idea, I mean after HYPE got established and everything, but then again, you have to let go sometime I thought to myself. I mean in a matter of one more school year, Josh and Steph won't be around anymore, so change is unavoidable. Also who knows, maybe this merge could benefit all of us. All these years, I have been hoping for the Mandarin and Cantonese congregations to merge back together again, as it shows unity not only as Chinese, but also as Christians, and we all know God's presence is always strong in groups.  Well after the two pastors left, I then also cancelled my badminton plans as no one was going. So instead, for the afternoon, I went and ran some errands with dad, and in the process bought much needed badminton birds, and also FINALLY developed some photos from May Camp. Next time I'm going to be developing the 80+ photos compiled of new years, TC 2004, and other random pics haha. So yeah my whole afternoon was basically that, and then by the time my dad and I were done, it was already time to go to HYPE. So went home to pick up clothes for painting, picked up Lina and Jason *in the order mentioned* and then headed to church.  We had some prayer, then painted, then left....all in 2 hours =).  Here I am now home once again. Gave Carmen, Lina, and Jason a ride back to their places, and then here I am now. Yup.....HYPE was pretty quiet tonight, with only 8 of us. Half of us are camping out somewhere....er Chinese Camping *Rebecky's dad was going to bring a rice cooker to camping....SSSSSEEEEERRRRRRIOUSLY* and Stephie is still in HK. The twins are somewhere, Toronto I think, and yeah I don't know where the others are hehe.  Anyways that's my rant for today.  Later.

       7/30/04 A new month is soon to roll in....   Today...yeah didn't do much. Basically sat around, worked out @ UCC, and then came home.  Yup....that pretty much sums it up.  Oh yeah I've come to like the book of James a hefty bit in the Bible now hehe.  Anyways I'm out.  Later.

       7/29/04  Another day of wandering with Rebecky and Jason     Nice day today to wander around downtown and Masonville. Yeah I realize I did this on Monday, but yeah eventually after some last-minute descision-making *waking up and deciding* I then thought "alright I'll go." So I then got up, headed downstairs, ate a banana for breakfast, and then headed for the bus stop.    Getting to downtown a wee bit late *due to lateness of bus* I then met up with Rebecky and Jason and then we went to William's for lunch. Heh haven't been there since school ended, and I actually almost forgot how good that place can be. Anyways ate some food there, Rebecky tried Italian Soda, and then headed to a few stores in downtown. Rebecky managed to find a $130 purse from Adidas on our adventure. I actually saw a store with a pair of old school green adidas track pants, but expensive......REALLY expensive. So left that store, and then while heading to my bus stop, Rebecky introduced me to the CD store that is literally l33t....    The Madrigal.    THEY HAVE EVERY CD I CAN THINK OF....that's not contemporary, which means every GOOD CD. Duke Ellington, Chicago, even those Chinese piano prodigies that you always hear of but never hear them actually play....holy crap they are insane. Me and Rebecky then wonder why we can't piano like those crazy people. Anyways, I'll be back there again, next time with cash =).    So then we headed to Masonville. Walked around and looked at stuff. I'm horrible at DDR yet again, but at least they have DDR Extreme now =).    Anyways I'm gone. That was basically my day. It was a lot more fun though, as I know my describing is dull right now. I'm too lazy to elaborate, as food is waiting on the table for me....and food is good. So....in conclusion, yes today was funny, a lot of inside jokes between me Jason and Rebecky now hahahahahahaha.     "No Rebecky you need this book, Carmen needs this one." *points out another book*     I won't name the books, but Jason and Rebecky know what I'm talking about haha =P.    Anyways I'm out now....dinner heehee.    Later.

       7/28/04  Lalala more tutoring....       That was the initial highlight of my day for today. Other than that, I sat around, played around with html for my new site that will be up eventually, and just SCed with some people.    Oh on a sidenote, I learned how to cook snowpeas =).    Anyways I'm out.    Bye.

       7/27/04  "HEY LOOK JOE, I CAN AIRFLARE" *Calvin makes horrid attempt*     Heh yeah I couldn't really come up with a good title today, but I did remember today when Calvin went:     Calvin: Joe look I can do half an airflare  Joe: WHOA MAN....IF YOU DO TWO HALF AN AIR FLARES...THAT MAKES A WHOLE AIRFLARE!    That was one thing that happened today. Other stuff.....I'll write about in the following couple paragraphs....    So as usual, I sleep for most of the morning, and I wake up at 1230 today after finally somehow getting tired of sleeping. I read up some more PDL, and then headed downstairs for the meal that most people know as lunch.    By now it was already 130. Today consisted of leftover pizza from Pizza Pizza. Before that, and during the reheating of the pizza, I somehow managed to watch through some of the tennis US Open. It was Agassi and some other dude, and it was a close game. Basically I can watch any game that seems either clutch or evenly matched I think. So after watching a bit of tennis, I ate, and then SCed for a bit of the afternoon. First time I played an Alamo match in a long time, probably only the certain few know what I'm talking about, and then after some of that, Calvin came over, and we headed to UCC.    Today at UCC....I'm trying to get style back into my stuff.........my footwork I've noticed now is actually terrible. AND I MANAGED TO LINK 3 MILLS.....well sort of....they were ugly but at least I didn't stop this time. Then after some breaking, came home again....      Days can be so short when I wake up late....but yeah.....so came home, ate some dinner, then watched some TV.    I've actually never really noticed how the show South Park can be so politically/international issues...ly active. It was kind of funny, today's episode on the Comedy Network was one that focused on the child molesting issue a while back with the Catholic priests. I find it interesting how they can make the show still funny, yet at the same time show you the serious problems these international issues can bring up. So yeah, over the summer, I've come to tolerate watching the following on TV now:    -South Park  -CFL football  -Baseball (don't ask)  -Tennis    Oh yeah....and reality TV is still looming around on the screen, so yeah I can still catch some of that junk.....though I'm still not a big fan of much of it.    Anyways I think that's all the ranting I have for today.    Bye.

       7/26/04  Another lazy blog for a lazy day...     Ok well today, since I feel lazy, this blog will be short.    In summary....    I woke up this morning at 1030, as Rebecky was supposed to call then, but she didn't call till 11, while I was on SC. So we planned, and eventually got Jason too, and we all agreed to go to Masonville.    So after mom was done talkin' to that insurance person at my house, and eating pizza, I got a lift to Masonville.    We bought stuff, I got a new pair of shorts, and then well eventually Rebecky left refusing to see "I,Robot" so in the end only me and Jason went to see that.    She missed out on a good movie. I won't ruin the movie though.    Then I got a lift home....    Watched some TV....    and here I am now done blogging.    Bye.

       7/25/04    ZzzZzzZzzz     Such an entertaining day today. Well not really actually, but I still didn't mind today. Even though I spent most of the day napping, and just sitting around, it's sometimes good I think to just sit down and just reflect. Today was one of those quiet, reflecting days. So other than sleeping, I still went to church, and then came home, napped, and then afterwards just reflected, ate, then watched some TV. But yeah today I had some thoughts while reflecting/doing my devos that I guess I'll scribble.....er......type out....    Today I read Romans 8 for my devos. While reading it, especially when I read the final few verses, it just really hit me when it says that we are all heirs and co-heirs with Christ, as long as we are his children, and that is obtained through living by the spirit, and not by ourselves. Also in this passage, like much of the New Testament contains, is the constant reminder of the fact that the Holy Spirit is always with us. That is probably one of my most favourite parts of the Bible, the fact that God keeps reassuring you that no matter what, no matter how wrong things can go in this world, that He is always, as the Holy Spirit, in you. Reading this passage today also got me thinking about the serving masters thing that we learned about in HYPE a while back about how we can't serve both God and money. To me it kind of relates, since in the passage it also speaks of how we can't be pleasing in God's eye if we live by a sinful nature, and how we are Spiritually alive when we live by God's ways. So yeah....I guess today was one of those total linkage days in my mind ehehe....    But yeah, that was a lot of my thoughts jammed into one for today. I guess it also goes with the sermon about serving we had I think may have been last week. Definitely wasn't today, as he was speaking of being a "well-watered garden." But yeah, today though wasn't an amusing day, I still enjoyed it, as like I said, I don't mind having some days when I can just sit down in the quiet and think.    I'm not really going to blog about yesterday, as I'm too lazy too, so I'll just say Dave finally paid me back the 15 bucks he owed me from my bus ticket blackmarketing, well not really, and also the wedding reception dinner wasn't bad. So the trip to Toronto wasn't that bad.    And onto today.....    I woke up this morning at 830, got 5 hours of sleep in total last night, and quickly got ready for church. Ate a light meal as I was still sleepy, got dressed and stuff, and then headed out. Picked up Lina, and Jason at his place was still sleeping, so went to service without him this morning.    I had to to the slide shows, since I didn't exactly have them in pristine order, so I had to jump around a little bit with the presentation. Dave Butler led today, and our congregation was probably the largest in weeks.....with approx. maybe 20 of us hahaha. It's so quiet without the UWO students here....so basically just the HYPE kids and a few other people. As mentioned before our topic today was being a "well-watered garden," with the sermon focusing on Isaiah 58.    After the service, headed downstairs, and chatted abit before me and Rebecca helped out with Sunday School today. It was Carol Ma's last day at teaching today, as her family is moving out to Toronto, since Joseph got a job at York U. But yeah, she did do a lot for the CSS, she was probably the person that organized it to it's peak that it is at today, as back when me, Josh, and the others were in CSS it wasn't exactly the best time of our lives. But the kids seem to really enjoy having Carol as a teacher, and she did do a lot for the church, so I'm sure she'll be missed by many of the kids. Today coincedencially with the topic of my rambling before, their focus was on serving today. So the kids learned this through a lesson, and also then through two games. One with ice cream, where one fed the other, and the other they had to put on one another's shoes. Me and Rebecky had to scoop the ice cream, well more of I did the scooping ( Rebecca: "SPOON MY FACE JOE..."   hahaha jokes)  and then me and Rebecca frantically finding a way to put all the ice cream in the fridge without crushing them *we did twice* collasping our pyramid *multiple times,* so in the end we shoved it all in the freezer until the kids were ready. Eventually I'd have to volunteer to be a partner with one of the kids since they had odd numbers, so I partnered up with Andy. He wanted to win, so he sacrificed brain freeze for large gobs of ice cream being shoved in his face, we won that game =P. But for the shoe game, we lost haha. Then while they were cleaning up, me and Rebecky had a conversation on the whiteboard, but yeah.....anyways....hahahaha......yeah........that was pretty much my experience today in helping the CSS =P.    After church, came home, ate, then slept from 3-5.    I was then woken up at 5 from a doorbell. Since dad was downstairs watching TV and couldn't hear the doorbell, I had to grab the door *ugh....loss of sleeping run.* Gavin's dad was at the door and he came to pick up the tents from us, since they are borrowing them for next week when their family and Josh's go camping. So after giving him the tents, I went back to sleep, and then woke up at 7.    After waking up at 7, I did my devos then, and then headed downstairs to eat. Afterwards, chatted on MSN for a bit, ate, showered, milled about, and here I am now....again haha.    Think I'm gonna go watch TV now. Argh....summer's goin' by so quickly. To think that 4 weeks ago we planned the Wonderland trip that is to be next Saturday. Wow...in another 4 weeks, it'll be September....oh well.....enjoy the summer sun while it lasts =).    Anywho I'm out.    Later.

       7/23/04  H2H gaming=fun =P....BOKAN! from Sessioning....       Yup, those are the main highlights of my day. On a sidenote, Maisie today comes back from her camp thingy, which means....another blogger will return!....er.....Xanga....er. I wonder if she brought me back a rifle like she promised...    My day started off at 1130am this morning with me starting off my day drumming. After that, had some lunch and then called Colin. I walked to his place to catch the bus around 130ish then, and we managed to catch the 145 one. So then off we went to downtown to meet up with Jason and his friend, and John.    When we got there though, only saw Jason and his friend Darryl. John was nowhere in sight. So phoned him, apparently he wasn't awake, so he came down in a bit. Went to BK, got some food, then went back to H2H to start gaming.....    Fun times today. Even though I missed out on the first game of Wc3 *the comp b0rked,* I would come back and play it with them =P. After that game, and me playing SC4 by myself, we then went on to play Call of Duty, with me and Colin against them 3 and some other dude. Me and Colin owned them, they had no chance....and even though we were playing in a sniper level, after a while, it turned into a bloody battle royal-melee game, filled with machine gun blares and hand grenades. No skill required whatsoever =P.    After our dedicated server got cut off because some clumsy shmuck logged onto that comp, we then switched back to WC3. Er, TFT. Whatever you want to call it. The game turned out to be me, John, and Jason vs. Colin, Darryl and that same random dude. We owned them =P. In 30 minutes, the three J's leveled the map of its enemies....flat.    Then after some Quake, we left.    Got home, went to UCC, and here I am now. Argh I suck so much at breaking now...worse than before. At least I can sloppily consistently link 2 mills now hahaha, and I can almost rollback onto forearm, to handstand, and then begin hopping. So there is SOME improvement =P.    Anyways I'm gone for now.    Bye.

       7/22/04  Another day of baddy and volunteering....     ...or vice versa. So that pretty much sums up my day, more volunteerin' and badminton.    Woke up at 1130 to get ready to volunteer. Got to Masonville around 12pmish or so.    So today I did the same thing as Tuesday. I counted books left out, counted people using computers, and added ticks for every person that came in and stuff. Today passed by a lot faster though, as I was trying to catapult myself out of the computer chair I was sitting on, and was also reading a HTML book to pass the time. The time passed by really slow from 1-2, since for some reason no one came to the library during that time. Things picked up after 2 though, with almost all the internet computers booked, and also some hick singing for the kids in the meeting room. So my shift ended at 3pm, and mom picked me up around 315ish. I took out the HTML book too, so I'll have something to refer to while designing my Tenmore page =). Also I have that Left Behind book to read still haha....so yeah I'm starting to use the library =P.    Got home around 330, and quickly grabbed a lot of cookies and began eating. Then sat on MSN for a bit, and then drummed for awhile. Afterwards, mom made dinner, and then I ate somethin' before heading to the UCC. I finally got my towel grip onto my baddy raquet, and it's actually pretty cool. It balanced out the weight more so it seems easier to move the raquet now. Bottom line, I like it haha. I also played another game of Hexic with Jenn, I think I won =P.    So I got to UCC around 630 or so. Josh and Lina were already there, but no sign of Gavin or Carmen. Not surprising, since Carmen is ALWAYS late and Gavin was getting a ride from her, so I thought no biggie they'll probably show up around 7 or so. Well in the end, after calling them, they showed up at 8, and then played until 9. So basically that was 5 bucks down the drain for each of them. Carmen not surprisingly didn't play that well, as it is basically her first time, so we taught her how to play a little bit, which kind of bombed since in the end we just played normally. I got a shot straight into her throat by accident hahaha, and then later on I'd hit Lina with the bird too. I know you don't have to tell me, I got super good aim =P. I would take the credit, but yeah accident for both haha. I was surprised too that I hit Carmen, I was using my left hand to play, and I'm horrible with it, since my right arm was getting kind of tired from playing so much baddy this week. I won most of my games today, and also there was this one girl who was playing with her dad that is REALLY good for her age *she's not even out of public school yet I think.* As Josh said, she's better than half the people in high school already. Anyways, got a lift from mom home, Lina also got a ride too.    Here I am now. Blogging. Just ate some more food, and yeah I'm probably going to read tonight, and then watch some late night shows maybe.    Later.

       7/21/04  And the deal is sealed...!     Yup, after some talking, changes, ideas, suggestions, and stuff, WE GOT THE DEAL SEALED....    WLAC AND LCAC WILL BE HAVING AN EVENT!    We don't exactly know what yet, but it will be awesome I can already see that =P. The idea of two churches coming together to figure out something cool to bring in new believers, what could POSSIBLY go wrong =)? Nothing my point being, so HAH!    So my day started off with me getting up around 1130am or so, and then headed downstairs for breakfast. I had the ever so healthy sausage and egg McMuffin from McD's, two of them, and mmm they were good haha. Afterwards, I basically sat around for 30 minutes or so, and then had to head out to volunteer work at Cherryhill.    Tech tutored from 1-3 again. Still my Tech Tutor shirt has not came in yet, so I did work with only a volunteer tag. Yeah I know it sucks we don't even get real name tags, but oh well =P. Today didn't really do much, slow day. Answered two questions about the internet, and that's about where it ended. Josh came around 245 to wait, and also annoy me simultaneously. Meh didn't matter anyways. By the time my shift was almost over, 4 people were on Yahoo! games, and only two people were actually doing something. Anyways after my shift was done, mom came to pick Josh and I up to go to WLAC. I took out the 5th book of the Left Behind Series, which is called Appolyon or somethin', and then we made a sidestop at Angelo's for food.    I got an ice cap and Pizza. Josh got rice and perogies. Then mom bought a stock of cookies and some organic pear juice *shrug.* It's ok, but a bit too sweet. Anyways, after that stop, and eating a bit, we then went to WLAC and met Graham, their youth pastor.    He's much younger than our english pastor Dale, so yeah I guess it was easier to talk to him. Plus he knew someone that is part of Thousand Foot Krutch, which is COOL. So yeah, we discussed stuff, and eventually we came up with some ideas and then thought we should maybe get the two youth groups to meet one another before anything else happens. So eventually, we agreed on a meeting of the two groups, and also making a planning committee for the events that are to follow. Apparently the pastor's gettin' married *congratulations!* early November, so our first mini-coffeehouse can't be held until late November. Oh well, that's awhile down the road anyways, so we got time =P.    So after meeting and talking over our ideas, with some new ones thrown in, we then walked to my place, typed up an email and sent it to the HYPE counselors, then Josh's mom came and took him home. I then talked on MSN for a bit, beat Jenn in a game of hexic, and then grabbed a quick bite to eat.    Afterwards, went to the UCC for the first time in AGES to session.    Bottom line, I'm horrible now. So met Calvin there, no one else was there yet so we sessioned upstairs on our own for a bit. After about 30 minutes, we decided to migrate downstairs, but a fire alarm would change that. When Calvin we were about to go to basement, Calvin then stuck his foot out to play around with the door sensors, then a fire alarm went off. It was kinda funny since it looked like Calvin set it off, but I really doubt sticking your foot out to mock elevator sensors can trigger a fire alarm. So everyone had to evacuate, and then fire trucks and all came. We then saw FuFu, one of the members of CG there too, and after the whole commotion was over, we headed to basement to session. In the end there were 5 people sessioning tonight, and then I left with Calvin *he had a lift so I got one too* around 9pmish.    I'm here now, alive and well, and happy for today's turnout. We got something setup between WLAC and LCAC, I got to session again, and I can start reading a book now hahaha =).    OH and how could I forget! Pastor Kwong and Evelyn *his wife* have a new baby girl, Ingrid. So Samuel is now a big brother haha. Congratulations to them too =).    Later.

       7/20/04  Short day....     Yeah I'm lazy again today, so short  blog for a short day.    Basically today for the whole afternoon I was at the library, surveying how many people use what at the library, and then cut stuff again.    Some good new for today though, I called Graham, the youth pastor at WLAC, and he seemed to like the idea of a coffeehouse between WLAC and LCAC. Him, Josh, and I are meeting tomorrow to discuss more into detail. Pray it goes well people =).    Then I came home, ate, SCed, and then now I go watch Conan O'Brien.    Bye.

       7/19/04  Gaaah...Badminton horrible today....but King Arthur was good =)     Well you gain some you lose some, so yeah today I totally got owned in badminton. However, seeing King Arthur with Niki didn't go that bad.....so like I said you gain some you lose some =). Those were the two main highlights of my day, and the rest of the details follow:    Morning was really slow today. It was friggin' impossible to get out of bed this morning for some reason, but eventually I forced myself to wake up and head downstairs. There was supposed to be some insurance person coming to talk about....well insurance....but funny part was he spent 45 minutes looking for my house because he thought my house number was 181, though there is no 181 on my street haha....so yeah in the end my mom rescheduled for next Monday. Ugh breakfast..er more of brunch today was sandwiches. I haven't ate a sandwich in eons, and I remember why. Bread taste so bland after a while. I don't get how some people can actually manage to pack a sandwich for lunch everyday....I would actually die. So after washing down the bread with a lot of juice, I brushed my teeth and stuff, got changed, and then headed off to Masonville.    Beat Niki to the mall, so waited about 5 minutes before she arrived. It was he first time since school ended that I saw her, and it was nice to see she is still the same cheery person she has always been. Walked around the mall for a bit, and then headed into the theatre. I was my usual dumb self, so Niki led the way to the theatre since I didn't know where in the world I was going...    The movie wasn't that bad.....I guess. I probably would see it again, and it is DVD worthy, but there's something missing...... I still don't know what....but it needs something else added for it to be an ass-whooping movie. They probably have one of the poorest pickup lines ever to lead into a sex scene though, and that deducts probably 20 points, and also not enough blood......so that was also what I didn't like....they need more gore to match with Gladiator or Troy =P.    After the movie, while waiting with Niki for her parents, all of a sudden....    The twins pop out of nowhere.    It was weird, one minute I was talking to Niki the next I hear a "JOSEPH!" and then I see Mike and Dan. So then chatted with them too for a bit, Niki's parents came just a bit after the twins arrived. Originally I was going to leave for my bus stop, but eventually, laziness defeated me and took Mike and Dan's offer for a ride lol. They were headed that-a-way anyways, so meh...why not =P. Originally Niki offered a ride, but she lives on the other side of town, so thought it'd have been better off if I bused. Oh well....but laziness....yeah......you know how it comes and just puts you at gunpoint to be lazy.....so yeah......in the end I got a ride from Mike and Dan heh.    After getting home, SCed for a bit, and heard one of THE most bizarre stories ever. Apparently yesterday after I left an MSN convo with Josh and Jason, afterwards, they somehow had a war between High paid lawyers and Lucas Arts versus Dungeons &amp; Dragons featuring Goku and the Fanboys, or vice versa. Both ways it was weird.....Josh had a one sided 21 dice or something, and then Jason said he was going to sue for cheating. Then Josh "burned" the evidence but then realized he had no dice to fight with now. ANYWAYS I am still just as confused/shocked about this story, and also this really puts stupidity to a new level, and concludes in my theory that LCAC has absolutely NO intelligent people in HYPE. Calvin's ran into a locked door, Josh and Jason had that REALLY strange story, I've proven many times that I have my super dry jokes, Brian thinks Terry Payton is a star Lakers player, and Gavin thought London had a subway system with every Mac's variety store as a subway stop. So yeah....we are now all officially dunce. Oh yeah and the twins.....have their new form of Chinglish haha. So yeah....I can now officially say LCAC has no smart population within the youth group of guys =P. The girls....they're slowly getting there....Carmen and Lina both have had their moments, and so has Rebecky tripping over a wooden pole. So yeah, stupidity is now at a new level, and I even told Josh and Jason that their right of calling me stupid, has just been taken away from them =P.    Anyways after some SC and that VERY weird story, I then went to play badminton....    Saw Steve Zhao there today, along with a Jane from Lucas who Lina says she owned, Lina, Gavin, and Josh.  Jason also came too, but he balled. So today in badminton, my record turned out to be something like 1-3, which really sucks as now my total record is something like...5-7....ugh. I don't know why I keep track, but meh something to do I guess =P. Lina was a lucky horseshoe for every game she played, with SO many fluke shots that I just stopped trying after a bit. Me and Gavin when we played her in doubles, geez she made 4 just barely over the net shots. While resting, we played with Steve's deck of cards, mostly Big Two. Then Gavin and Lina kept asking Jason to play badminton, where Gavin then stopped, then started poking and telling him to play baddy again, leading to my SHUPA stupid joke:     Gavin: Warning: Incoming badminton flood  Jason: Dude, you and Lina have been flooding me for baddy for the last 10 minutes.  Gavin: Uhh....ok...well then....MEGA BADMINTON FLOOD  Joe: Haha....badminton flood. Gavin, it'd be something like...."Badminton.....NNNNNYYYUHHHHHH!" *pretends to drown from a badminton "flood" ha.....ha.....*  Gavin: SMPGO!  Joe: BOLL!  Jason: (after seeing it ) LOL!     So yeah, you probably have to see it to see what we are talking about, but yeah Gavin and Jason probably still know what I'm talking about. Also Jane then pointed out I talk a lot...who hasn't =P.    Then afterwards, when me and Gavin were playing again against Josh and Lina in a game of doubles, we came up with a new strategy....MAKE THE OTHERS LAUGH SO THEY CAN'T CONCENTRATE:     Joe: Alright Gavin time to put on our game face  Gavin: GAME FACE *two thumbs up and makes a very big smile*  *Joe and Gavin start to SMPGO and lose total concentration*           So our plan failed, but point is, we tried =P. Eventually we got owned due to horrid luck, and also like I said, we lost concentration and Josh and Lina just looked at us as though we were tards. We eventually lost really bad, but that's besides the point it was funny at the time.    Eventually badminton did end, and then walked home with Lina.    Now I'm here....blogging...and chatting. I think I'm going to go watch Leno maybe.    Later.

Not much happened today, and after yesterday's post, I'm a little bit lazy, so here's a summary    -woke up  -was late for worship practice (Carmen was apparently the first one there today)  -English service (studied Jeremiah today)  -Bible study (studied Daniel 6, the famous lion den story)  -Home  -Not much since (some SC, chatting, usual stuff)    Yup....that pretty much sums it up. Now Shoo.    Oh wait, actually before shooing, here are some quotes I leave you with....    Gavin: "YOU SMELL SO BAD YOU MADE SPEED STICK SLOW DOWN!"  Dan: "YOU SMELL SO BAD YOU MADE RIGHT GUARD TURN LEFT!"    OOOOOOOH SIU. Anyways I'm out.    Later.

       7/17/04  Another HYPE sleepover come and gone...     Ahh yes, so now back home from HYPE sleepover, and after a 3 hour nap, and Wendy and her family coming over for a bit, I am FINALLY firin' up my blog entry covering July 16-17. As usual, use your search feature to find the date by format of mm/dd/yy  (7/17/04 for example)  and start readin' =).     7/16/04  Last minute shopping for sleepover and day 1     Friday, since it was a long ways back, is somewhat vague, but I'll still try my best to recall as much as possible.    Ok, so my day started off at a healthy 1100am. After waking up, I preceded downstairs to eat my breakfast which was McD's since mom didn't want to cook today. So after eating, I headed downstairs, and chatted on MSN for a bit and also had to print off a few things for the sleepover. Afterwards, while packing, I then remembered:     Crap, I have quite a horrible memory. I need a checklist usually.     So then, I quickly called Rebecky, and then me and her talked on the phone for awhile while I was packing, and she was listing stuff off also for me. During this time, I was also talking to Joy and Gerts on MSN, well more of listening since I was already doing two things at once, almost 3 as I also had to keep track of what I had/had not printed off. Er, four, I also had to keep updated on the church key crisis, as we had no way into the church at the moment. That is, until Gavin pulled through and got his hands on a key. So crisis solved =P. But back to the MSN convos that I had while packing...Yeah, Gerts and Joy are awesome people, they have the most random convos.....well to me at least. I'm sitting there trying to keep up while there is a lot of LOL's and hahahaha's and of course SMPGO's, but yeah it was funny talkin' to them. Gerty then made me have a craving for a watermelon popsicle after she announced:     I have a grape popsicle.     So after that, I got hungry, but I had to go to Loblaws to buy the food for sleepover still, and then get to church by 4 to practice the worship part of the sleepover/Sunday Worship.    Shopping at Loblaws. Not much to say really, how exciting can it be? Exactly, not very. So bought the stuff we needed, and then headed to the church.    I was a weeeee bit late, but that's ok, as Carmen was still the last one to run through the finish line =P. Gavin and Josh were upstairs waiting, and since they were pretty much set, I asked them to help unload the food that will be needed for the next two days. I myself also did some of the unloading, including the stuff I need to sleep. After all the unloading, Carmen then arrived, and we all then began to practice for Sunday Worship.    That went by fairly well, and in around an hour and a half we were done. For dinner, I ordered Pizza and then Rebecky and Wendy arrived. Calvin also arrived too, and sat there watching us practice for a bit. So after we finished doing practice for Sunday Worship, Josh, Gavin, and I then got ready to do the HYPE worship session.    So the worship session went well. It lasted around 50 minutes, which was close to the proposed hour. It went well, not many mistakes, except Gavin still needs to remember that 3/4 time strumming is DIFFERENT from 4/4. But other than that, all went well, and we actually sounded really good I thought. But yeah, afterwards, after some clearing up and cleaning, we then headed downstairs for our Bible study.    Today Pastor Mackness continued with our studies on Proverbs, but looked more into Ecclesiastes. The book is actually very hard to understand, as it is really vague, and everything seems to be looping. However, in the end it all comes together, and the message of the book is to forewarn you about falling for earthly things too much, so it did all tie in together. I still wish that some of us could pay attention just a WEE bit more during studies. There are still those few who seem to just idle there and daze away.    After the study....and some snacks....came the infamous game of.....     GORGON.....*DUN DUN DUN*     Yeah so we played that for a while then *until 1am or so.* For the first game, Jason was the gorgon, which was a fairly decent length of time game. I got caught somewhat early, as Calvin was in my way when I was trying to run into the safe zone, so yeah, I got caught. It seems as though my forewarning statement of "MOVE!" didn't mean a thing, so yeah I got caught. In the end Jason won, and yeah, we lost miserably lol. It was funny with some of the things that happened. Plus the dark also adds a big factor as you can't see who the heck is running at you until you either hear him or you can actually see the person instead of a black silhouette. Calvin managed to run into a locked door, while Gavin ran himself into a dead end and got owned.    Second game Andy *one of the newer kids* was the Gorgon. This time, Jeffany *the other new comer* was one of the first to get caught, while me, Gavin and Jason lasted a decent amount of time *actually the other two lasted through the whole thing* but the emphasis is put on this. Our secret weapon, The Pillow *actual pillows* worked really well as working as inatimate obstacles and body shields. And since natural reflex is to catch something, throwing the pillow at Andy worked really well. Eventually I got caught though as he just caught me as I was running into the door, so yeah I got out. Calvin and Jason though managed to hold out through the game and find all the parts of the battery and then.....    Gorgon hunting.    We let Andy go hide since he didn't know the game was over so we gave him a 30 second getaway. Afterwards, me, Gavin, Jason, and Calvin went off on an expedition to find Andy. In the end, we FINALLY managed to find him, after almost an hour of searching, and we had walked right by him over 20 times and never saw him. In the end, he started to mock us with noises that we were FINALLY able to find him. We literally looked everywhere, and we all felt like a bunch of dumbasses when we found him at the end.    Wendy and Jeffany were the final two Gorgons. Well they counted as "one" quoted from Wendy, as they run slower. But it doesn't really matter since you know the dark and everything, we can't run that fast up stairs anyways. This game was fairly short, as eventually it kind of died out, and yeah, we switched to card games and stuff until 2am or so.    Oh yeah, also me and Calvin started a new trend for those who were caught out during Gorgon...    Fly hunting.    Yeah since we had nothing better to do while waiting for the next game, we began catching flies and putting them in some old cookie container from Loblaws. We managed to catch a grand total of 6, with one kind of split in half =S courtesy of me. One of the flies unfortunately moved a bit too slow or too fast, and when that cup came down to catch it, it got caught right on the edge. All of us were sickened by that, but it was another bounty caught. Me, Josh, and Calvin each caught a decent 3-4, for a grand total of 6. I say this because after catching sometimes, they kinda managed to fly off, so we caught them again =P. After the trend was over, Ken had arrived from Toronto, and brought FOOD! He had to host a VBS thing back at his home church at his place or sometin', so yeah he started drivin' late, and managed to arrive. I was surprised at the phenomenal timing he had.    Uno was the trend for many of the girls and guys, while Big 2 was the other, along with this other card game that used the Uno cards. After a lot of laughs and card games, we all split our ways *guys into one room and girls into the other* and then tucked into bed....    or a LONG game of Risk and the girls I don't know what they did.    Basically in the game of Risk, I self sacrificed and weakened out Gavin, which then led to Andy and Jason to be supreme rulers. Me, Calvin, and Gavin were all kind of weakened *me and Gavin had a huge clash* and Calvin idled. Josh on the other hand was having a merry time making stupid stories with the Risk men that were actually hilarious.    "WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A PURCHASE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"  "I have no money."  "WHAT KIND OF BLACK MARKET TRADER ARE YOU!?"  "Broke."  "BREAK HIM! *JIU JIU JIU BANG BANG BANG!*"    And yeah that was one story, the other....    "Perimeter we must form around Jedi."    But yeah, anyways, I'll let Josh unravel those stories. But yeah eventually the Risk game ended with Jason basically victorious, and it was already 530am by then. A few of the guys went out to steal the girls' shoes, and I suggested they put them in the oven, but eventually they tied them to some pipes running overhead in the kitchen. So we just kind of chatted around until 6am, jumped Gavin when he was having a RAVE PARTY! and kind of eventually drifted off to sleep......     7/17/04  So.....tired....but.....worth...it     Yeah so after 4 hours of sleep, I finally got up at 10am, realizing I was an hour late for making breakfast. Apparently Ken and Rebecky were up already, along with Wendy, so yeah they had started already. Pastor D had to leave early for a wedding, so yeah, unfortunately he couldn't stay to eat. Making breakfast was fun, and somewhat gross, but all tied in together with laughs. Rebecca had broken two dozen eggs into one bowl, and Ken, thinking it'd be a good idea, dumped all the eggs in the frying pan AFTER frying bacon *the pan had dirty bacon grease in it* and started stirring the vat of eggs, with some of it burning at the bottom. Jason and I were kind of thinking "uhh, that's not right at all" while Ken kept reassuring "GUYS RELAX, IT'S JUST BACON GREASE. SEE THE EGGS SOLIDIFYING." The egg eventually turned out to be somewhat of a tannish colour, but it actually wasn't that bad. Bacon flavoured eggs in fact is pretty cool haha. The bacon turned out real nice though, as did the cereal...for obvious reasons =P. The toast was good on one side, but the other side wasn't even cooked lol, as I tried being like my dad and mass toasting them in the oven. The place reeked a horrid stench though, and I discovered that apparently the garbage can was beginning to get infested with none other than maggots. But yeah, we left that be for a bit *till after we ate* and dug in to the grub *ha...ha.....ha...........play on words........ha.........*    After breakfast, cleaned up, and did second session of worship. Went fairly well also.    And then came the Bible study led by me and Josh. Unfortunately, since we only had 4 hours of sleep, as with the others, we couldn't really stay focused really well, and the others, yeah it wasn't pretty. However I think Josh and I got the point through, and that was the Benefits of Wisdom in life. We spoke a lot about reputation and representation, and how important it really is. See, since we were made in the image of God, and God is perfect, then we must strive to live to be as close to perfect as we can get. Good reputation is one thing we revolved around alot, and we came to conclude that good reputation is useless, unless you use it to its maximum potential. Spreading the gospel can be much easier with a good reputation, as people tend to listen to you more. Good reputation is also one of the characteristics of a wise person, and it is true that many listen to the wise. Josh and I did a fairly decent job I thought in leading this *with MUCH help from Wendy and Ken; for me more thanks to Wendy as she REALLY helped me get through the study easier haha =).* Well eventually the study did end, with Josh getting a few more apologetics down also as a bonus =).    Afterwards, we just played some more Risk, chilled, and then went home after a wee bit of baddy also.    Once I got home....SLEEP!    *3 hours later*    When I awoke, at 8, all I heard was my mom talking to Wendy's family. That's when I realized crap no one woke me up for BBQ with their family. So I quickly showered, changed, and went downstairs to say hi to them. Apparently Wendy had been there for three hours already *whoops =P* so yeah, she was kind of bored. Eventually we both ended up chit chatting and watching Rat Race and WB Superstar before she had to leave. Her family brought cake also, so ate a bit of that, also dad's BBQ, and then back on MSN chattin' with many a people =).    Anyways it's gettin' late now, and I gotta head to sleep...so........    Later. This post is DONE.

        7/14/04    200th post! JAAAM SESSSSSSION!!!!     So yeah, today Gavin, Josh, and I had our first jam session in ages, and wow was it cool. I almost forgot what it's like to have a bass, guitar, and drums all going at it just praising God's name, and also addin' a bit of fun haha. Solos that don't even fit in, and just messing up and laughing at our own mistakes, yeah good times haha. Even though earlier in the day it was a wee bit boring, all that changed after 5pm or so. But yeah, so I'll start from the top then...    This morning I woke up at the usual 1130, and made a few phone calls to start the day. Josh and Gavin finally arranged everything to get to my place, and then made plans for next Friday to go to Head 2 Head.    After all the deen wa congee, I did my devos. I decided to read the "Give me Oil in my Lamp" booklet that I got from TC again just to read over some of the different ways of doin' devos, and still in the end did it the Lectio Divina style. So to day I read 1 John 3, which was about how to be at peace with one another in this world. It also spoke of God's command to follow his Son, and also just to love one another, and how He lives in us when we obey his commands. It's pretty cool how the Bibles interweaves. I never really noticed it until Theresa said it during Bible Study last Sunday, but it actually is so true =).    Afterwards, for the afternoon, I sat around for a long time. Originally I was plannin' to go out to downtown, but since Gavin and Josh said they would be here by 4, I decided to wait instead. Well, after talking to Jenn, Vikki, Rebecky, and a host of other people until 4, I was wondering where they were. FINALLY I decided to call Josh and he told me Gavin was supposed to tell me they wouldn't be here till 540. So yeah....I spent the whole afternoon moping, which sucked. Well in the mopage I was able to trombone for a bit, and also fiddle around with photoshop. So yeah I made this one pic of Gavin being squished by my moose, entitled "MOOSH-ZILLA!" It sent a lot of people BOLLing *hahaha Joy* and SMPGOing. Also of course it takes my stupidity to a whole new level, something that EVERYONE wants =P.    Chatting on MSN led to me and Jenn discussing the usage of the word "biter" and "biting" as in yoinking, as you can't really bite email....nor chopsticks. It's kind of like the explained one at UCC when Steve or Sergei was explaining how you can't exactly bite windmills or airflares. Also many of them got to see my amazing photoshop skills of the feared "MOOSH-ZILLA!" and oh yeah also this:     Joe: Hmm I need an idea for another photoshop project. I KNOW I'LL MAKE A POOR MUFFIN! LITERALLY!  Rebecca: Hahaha....  Joe: LOL hahahhah BRILLIANT!     That's the convo shortened a lot, as at one point I almost had to replace the muffin with a cupcake as they are easier to make. After I sent Joy the picture of the moose, she then started talking about whacky photos of herself too. Yeah so we talked about the immaturity of people like us for a while then, until she had to leave. Oh yeah, she has Fresh hat which is cool too =P.    Well after watching some Friends, and the Simpsons, Gavin and Josh FINALLY arrived. So first off we ate dinner, and then started off choosing songs with a word of prayer then began the song choosing.    Yeah during the song choosing, there were a lot of jokes including the long one about Chris Tan and his old-school music:     Joe: Hey for jokes, first day when UWO kids come back, let's play "Trading my Sorrows"  Gavin: Hahaha, yeah and then Chris would go on crazy...it'd be something like  *imitates blood vessel expanding* *Camera Zooms in*  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH! "You're making me angry....."  Joe: "You're making me angry.......SEI LEANG JAI!"  Joe Josh and Gavin: SMPGO!!!!!!  Gavin: *imitating Chris* "I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO PLAY WORSHIP MUSIC!" *imitates piano*  Josh: NO FINGERS TOO FAT!!!! AAAAAAAH *imitates throwing of piano into congregation  Joe Josh and Gavin: SMPGO SMPGO "Lmsao" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHA HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA!     And from that we were able to make ourselves laugh for almost a full 5 minutes. Eventually we were all able to calm down, and then Josh starts looking through music again:     Josh: Ok, we could have maybe "Majesty, Always...."  Joe: LOL MAJESTY ALWAYS...IT SOUNDS LIKE MAJESTA ALWAYS HAHAHAHAHA!     And then I start to SMPGO for a bit, and yeah eventually I did stop, and then another stupid joke came up:     Gavin: Joe stop playing with your stuffed squirrel  Joe: It's not a squirrel....IT'S A MOOSE!  Gavin: Joe that thing is clearly a squirrel  Joe: NOT IF I STICK ANTLERS INTO IT! *pretends to make the squirrel go limp*         That made me and Gavin crack up for a bit, and then FINALLY we got everything done and we then find Josh looking for "One Desire" and then see him looking at some pink webpage.     Gavin and Joe: Uhh....Josh? WTG?  Josh: What? I was looking for "One Desire" and one of the pages was this  Joe: WAIT IT'S A BLOG LET'S LOOK!     Oh yeah, then AFTER that, we then began to jam.    Jamming was fun. Despite the little blips and mistakes there were, all in all good fun, and adds to the ringing in all of our ears. Aah the sound of music, er of us going deaf. It was awesome though, I almost forgot how cool having live guitar and bass sounds with drums...I've been playing to CD's too much haha. But yeah all in good times.    Then afterwards, we waited for Josh's and Gavin's parents to come pick 'em up. That was when Gavin started dying of lactose, and Josh and Gavin explained to me their comic idea of "LIMSOW!" but yeah that's for another day...whenever Josh gets the comic up and running. For now, we have Nuklear Power and MegaTokyo to entertain us all =P.    Anyways I'm out for now. Debating with Jenn what the score is.    Cya!

       7/14/04 TECH TUTORED! Dinner @ Jesse's was awesome too...   All in all, a good day today, starting off with a morning of relaxing, then an afternoon of volunteering, then some catching up with my old fellowship counselor Jesse Wong, yeah today was a good day I must say.  Before my entry really gets underway, I'd like to say a big thank you to Jesse Wong for letting me, Gavin and Josh raid his house for the evening for a time of jamming, Speed Scrabble, and just catching up, and of course the pizza =P. I know, with experience, that having all of us over is not an easy task  *seeing Jason, Josh, and Gavin emptied my fridge last time* and I'd like to thank him for enduring through the 4 hours that we were chillin' at his place. It was cool to catch up with one another, and just to pull out the old memories and thewhat's been going on with HYPE, what's been goin' on in our lives, and of course the crazy adventures that Jesse always has in store to talk about haha. So yeah, thanks a lot man new about  =).  So my day started off this morning at 11am, waking up from a refreshing 9 hours of sleep. Waking up, I ate lunch first, sat on MSN for a bit, and then headed out to Cherryhill to do my Tech Tutor volunteer at Cherryhill.  So from 1-3pm I would work at Cherryhill. During the first hour, I was literally BORED out of my mind, the only thing probably keeping me occupied was the 3rd book of the Left Behind series which I read snippets of, and also the local papers. Eventually though things started picking up at around 2pm, when an older man asked me if I was a volunteer. So I replied yes I was, and then another person asked me something regarding hotmail, which I solved fairly easily. Eventually I would go on to answer around 7-10 questions in the next hour, which did help the hour go by a lot quicker. Also I'd begin to talk with this 9er about Orchard Park since he apparently graduated from there this year. I actually never really noticed how many people use the computers at the library. So in the end, I did do some work which I'm actually thankful for or else I would have been bored out of my mind, and left my two hour shift at 3pm happy =).  Walking home, I got home around 330, and then ate some food, and then SCed with Gavin until 530 when I had to leave for Jesse's place.  Finding his place would have been much easier if I had put down 283 instead of 238 Windemere Rd. I was lucky he wrote down Beaver Hall or I would have NEVER found the place. So lucky he did, and eventually I did figure out where his place was, as Josh and I would find each other looking for his place and then we would then find it. We were the first two there, and had the honour of meeting Jesse's roomate Mark who also grabbed some Pizza, and also met a fellow dentistry pal Ada *I think I got the name right.* Wait....did she do dentistry even? Uh oh....yeah....whoops haha. But she left early anyways, so when she left, Gavin had arrived. He was late as some driver's car went "dead fire" on an intersection which got Gavin's mom really peeved. So he got to Jesse's a bit late, but no worries, we still had time to talk and everything. It was pretty cool catching up with each other. Mark was a med student so talked to him a lot, Josh and I told them about our high school days, and Jesse had one REALLY cool piece of news...   MIKE LIM IS COMIN' BACK FOR MED SCHOOL!   So yeah that's an awesome thing. Also Jesse has TOTALLY upped his guitar equipment. He has a SHWEET Yorkville amp now *which would later turn Josh's acoustic into a bass* and a Wam-Wam pedal. SOOOOOO NICE. Me and Gavin would look at that thing in awe, as it is a Wam-Wam pedal. So after chillin' in Jesse's room for a bit, pizza came, and we all dug in. Mark also joined us, and we eventually would spend an hour and a half talking about sports while we were eating haha. Also me and Gavin would show off our extremely lame sense of humour that we use sometimes, and we responded with the *ehems* and *looks around pretending nothing just happened.* Afterwards we had a few rounds of Speed Scrabble *I came in 3rd or 4th overall,* and I saw the lowest Scrabble score of all time.  Gavin managed to score a 15.  He had a nice set of words, but problem was he never used his X's, Z's, K's and stuff, so eventually he got deducted down to a total of 17. So next game he had a word worth 36 alone and Jesse exclaims:  "Gavin, you just beat your last score with just that one word. GOOD JOB!"  So after that, we then decided to have a mini jam-session before we left. So there were them with their 3 guitars, Josh using Jesse's amp to imitate a bass, and me...  with a cardboard box for a bass drum and a tupperware for a snare. Cymbals and toms were beyond our reach.  So we jammed around for a bit, me wishing I had at least a hi-hat, and before we knew it 10pm had come around the corner, and was time for us to go. But yeah, tonight was good times. Only thing we were missing was a drumset, and more time haha. Like I said before, I thank Jesse for toleratin' with kids like us for 4 hours at his place, and also I would also like to thank God for just keeping us in touch with one another still. That I didn't mention before =P.  Well anyways I'm back home now. Unforunately Calvin missed tonight, but there will be other times. So yeah today will be remembered for awhile. Josh took some pics, hopefully he'll post 'em up soon ehehe.  Anyways I'm out for now. Gotta get sleep for tomorrow. Josh and Gavin are coming over for worship practice for Friday, and on Friday us and Carmen are going to be doing worship practice for Saturday. Maybe I'll be able to fit in some time to work out tomorrow.  Anyways that's another day. Me as an average shmoe I got enough to think about for one day haha.  Later.

       7/13/04 Yay! Webcam!....I stub my toe....LIVE now =P   Yup, I don't see what's so amusing about a webcam, other than the fact that you can see yourself stub your toe, eat carrots, and make others watch you as you stub your toe, eat your carrots, and run around the house looking for more carrot dip, scream in agony after stubbing your toe on your subwoofer, and attempt to use camera flash on the webcam. So yeah...that's my evening from 9-10....as for the rest of my day...  My day started in the morning, ate, TV, and then headed to UCC to do Bible study with Wendy and Josh. After that for 45 minutes, I then bought a 6 pack of donuts and then ate 4/6. Josh stole the other two. Then afterwards I worked out, balled with Jason, and came home.  Yeah and right now I'm still trying to fix my camera so it actually works....well. Other than that, meh....probably going to sleep soon. I'm dead tired.  Later.

       7/12/04 Badminton Summer Record: 3-4   Also...  Happy 15th Birthday Calvin. Now onto business....  YES I'M ON THE BOARDS NOW! Today after 4 hours of badmintoning at the UCC, I finally can post some wins in my record =). So yeah today mostly consisted of badminton for the evening, SCing in the afternoon, and some PS2 when Gavin came over. So all in all, not a bad day =P.  The day of course started in the morning around 11 or so. A phone call woke me up, though mom picked it up so I just went downstairs and started drumming. Due to poor coordination though, I decided to stop and SC with Gavin and Josh for a bit. Afterwards, more drumming, ate, Gavin then came over, played some REALLY rigged games of NFL Street *he managed to beat me 3/4 times* then Badminton.  I'm to lazy to expand on those subjects, So I leave you with that. And this...  "How much sword could a swordchuck chuck if a swordchuck could chuck swords?" - Fighter from Nuklear Power.  Later.

       7/11/04 "Uhh....how can you do a lay-up and dunk at the same time?"   New quote of the day I think. Actually I didn't have one until Calvin made that remark playing NBA Street. Yeah today was pretty cool, after church had Gavin and Calvin over for BBQ, and then Jason came too for some ball at the park and then an afternoon of PS2 and then topped off with Pizza dinner and of course just the jokes and stupid things we made up during the time they were over today. Good times though, haha like usual eventually we all got bored and just kinda sat in front of the TV.  My day started off at the usual 830am today, jumping out of bed, get dressed, eat, bathroom, and then off I went to church. Only had to pick up Lina today since Jason had just got back from Montreal, so he was a bit tired. Got to church around 910ish or so, and Theresa was in place for Thomas for teaching us during Bible Study today. So we did a study on Daniel 5 today, which spoke of Belshezzar's ignorance of God, and eventually dying for it. He was warned before, as he witnessed Nebuchadnezzar's exile, but he still didn't care, and long story short, God literally "pwned" him =P. Darius of the Medes then took over half of Babylon, and some other country took over the other half. Yup, one thing that I've always enjoyed about the Bible are the stories about the ancient battles and stuff. Just picturing it in my mind like a mental version of "Troy" or "Gladiator..." ahh yes it really does bring stories to life. So we did a study on the fall of Belshazzar basically today *the hand writing on the wall happened in this chapter also* and then up to service we went.  Sermon today I read the scripture for, and was preached by Pastor Ming Wong since Pastor Kwong was out and so was Mackness. He spoke a good sermon though. It was a good reminder of how we should be living our lives according to God, and not according to us. He reminded us of how we should ask God what our purpose here on earth is, instead of trying to figure it out on our own. We should be consulting God on whatever problems we have, and not trying to solve it ourselves. And most of all, we should be asking God to lead us through life, as walking aimlessly on our own is like walking with no purpose.  After the service, Calvin and Gavin came to my place for some BBQ.  Had some Ju-Pah, and I tried some BBQ fish that my dad made which wasn't bad, and then Jason came over also. So we played some PS2, chilled, and we even managed to fit in an hour of ball in the scorching 30 degree weather today *I mean celsius not fahrenheit.* And as mentioned before jokes jokes and more jokes haha.  Example. Since it waas 30 degrees, we got pretty tired from balling, but in a last effort ditch to play, we decided to finish off our ballin' with a game of "American 5." Yeah....that was one thing that happened today that was seeing us at our most retarded stage. NBA street was actually pretty funny also, especially when Calvin forgets everything we tell him 2 minutes later. He reminds me of Fighter from  urlLink Nuklear Power . Good times though still haha. All of us had our share of stupidity. Calvin had to leave at 6pm, but Gavin and Jason stayed until about 830-9ish. Jason left a bit earlier, so that is why I have a time span.  On the PS2 today, I almost forgot to mention, some of the most b/s stuff happened. NFL Street Calvin manages to make a last dying pitch to a fellow player to score a touchdown *it was a b/s pitch,* Gavin SOMEHOW made a defensive conversion, and in NBA Street I don't see how Jason ACCIDENTALLY scored with NELLY from  BEYOND HALF COURT. *  So yeah even though no jamming happened today, we still had chillin' times.  On a side note of goodnews, Rebecca is back from Winnepeg, and Jason as you have realized is back from Montreal.  As I think now still, so many jokes were made today or talked about. The Grill shirt that Jason saw in Monreal *a Nike shirt that actually had a grill on it and said "all up in your grill" or Gavin's woman shot in ball haha. There was also the joke about American 21, and whole bunch of other stuff.  And to leave you people with some famous quotes made today:  Calvin...  "What's a dunk to a layup?" "Uhh, how do you do a layup and a slam dunk at the same time?" "Pump fake? What's that?"  Joe...  "Hey you know how we have SMPGO instead of LMAO? Well for "lmfao" we could have SMCHPGO! SIUING MY CHO HAO PEI GOO OFF!" "COME ON BRING IT AMERICAN 21 IT YOU HOES!" "Haha Wein almost spells Weiner..."  Jason...  *He made a half court shot with Nelly in NBA Street, so that says enough...OH YEAH I REMEMBER SOMETHIN'...* "Calvin, you can dunk and lay-up at the same time FOR SURE. All you have to do is dunk it, and then quickly catch the ball and throw it again before landing...got it?"  Gavin...  *Cracks up from the American 21 hoe comment* "GUY I CAN'T DUNK IT WON'T LET ME!" "OWNED! OOOOOH SIU!"   Bah I'm runnin' outta ideas. Gonna head to sleep I think haha.  Later.

       7/10/04 Grandma's 74 now...   Yes my grandma is now 74 years old. Unfortunately, since she wasn't feeling well, my family didn't go to Toronto today, and instead I'm going to some wedding on the 24th. Meh, Toronto's Toronto, so I REALLY don't mind for what occasion I'm out in the T-dot for. So yeah...spent most of the day at home.  Today didn't TOTALLY go to waste though. First thing in the morning my family had a Saturday Brunch BBQ of some sort, with me and my dad making waffles for dessert. It was my first time doing that, so yeah I know how to make waffles now =). Even though it wasn't exactly AMAZING tasting, meh, first time so give me a break =P. I'll make them better next time hopefully...  Afterwards my parents went out shopping at Bellemere, and I drummed for the next hour and a half. Afterwards sat on MSN, then drummed for another hour. I've actually improved with fills and stuff now, as before I always choked whenever the pattern ended with my right hand. I'm beginning to smoothen things out though, and the new layout for my kit I find it is a lot easier. Having the ride cymbal on the right side instead of the middle is MUCH better. Oh yeah, and I REALLY need new drumheads, I'm going to be breaking my other tom any day now. So whenever I find 100 bucks to spare, I'm just going to refit my whole kit.  Anyways afterwards, parents came back, then went to Tai Hu for dinner tonight. Wasn't that bad I guess, I haven't been to the place in ages.  Afterwards we came home *obviously.* I decided to read PDL and the Bible for a bit. Read Matthew 18, about how to treat fellow Christians, and why we should be solving problems with our fellow Christians if a problem arises rather than shoveling more coal into the fire. It also reminded me of how God's presence is always with us in verse 20. I'm onto Purpose 3 in PDL now I think, er the small version of PDL, which is almost like a small version of a Bible haha.  That basically wraps up my day. Just chattin' right now and eating blueberries and strawberries. Veggies and Fruits have come to be compy snacks, and tea is the official drink of Joe when he is being a geek on the computer.  Anyways I'm out for tonight. Gavin and Josh are comin' over to jam after church tomorrow, so yeah no afternoon nap haha.  Later.

       7/9/04 Slow moving Friday..   Meh, bit on the slow side but oh well, here it is anyways:  I awoke this morning at 11am today. The sun shining into my room forced me awake as I couldn't sleep with so much light flooding into my room. So I woke up, and began doing my devos. Today I read about "the seven biblical steps of restoring fellowship." I won't say much about them, but I will tell you what they are:   1. Talk to God before talking to the person 2. Always take the initiative 3. Sympathize with their feelings 4. Confess your part of the conflict 5. Attack the problem, not the person 6. Cooperate as much as possible 7. Focus on reconciliation, not resolution   So I sat there and reflected for 30 minutes or so, and during that time also read some passages from the Bible *mostly expanding on the given verses for each step* and also just trying to figure out what each one meant. At first I didn't really understand 7, but I think I do now. Anyways, after doing my devos in the morning, I then headed downstairs to watch some TV.  Due to the cruminess of afternoon TV programming, I then ate lunch, and then drummed for an hour. Afterewards, it was already 330, and I called Marcello to see when he wanted to go to UCC. Eventually we set a time for 430, so I kind of just moped around for an hour. No wait, no I didn't. For some reason I re-installed SimCity 3000 *though there is SC 4 already* and played that for a while. I don't know why...but point is afterwards @ 430 mom gave me and Marcello a lift to UCC.  Worked out for two hours, then walked home talking to Marcello also.  Came back, played some more SC3000 *it's addictive* and then ate dinner. Now blogging, I am also chatting on MSN, and drinking Orange Juice *yum.* I wonder when WLAC will reply to my e-mail, or when the HYPE dudes will reply about my suggestion of a men's prayer group.  Anyways I'm out for now. Toronto got cancelled for tomorrow, so I don't know WHAT I'm going to do. Tomorrow's grandma's birthday though, so my family's headin' out for dinner anyways. Argh...BUT TORONTO! BOO HOOO ='(. I'll also be missing HYPE tomorrow for dinner *we are painting!* Gah...this weekend doesn't look to bright so far haha.  Oh yeah, and for jokes, you HAVE to go to this. "Saddam Rock Paper Scissors" is HILARIOUS.  urlLink Click Here .  Later.

       7/8/04 BADMINTON...First ACTUAL games in almost 2 months...   Current record for July: 0-2  Yeah the record looks grim, hopefully I can get back up and running. Second game was REALLY close, except me and Josh eventually lost to Gavin in an intense one point grab. Tied 14-14, me and Josh lost serve, and was back to Gavin's side who was w/ Jeffany's dad on a team. Jeffany's dad cleared the shot...and it was over. I was going to try to reach it but it was to high, and ducked for Josh to clear. No shot came, and the final score stood at 15-14. SO CLOSE...oh well at least it was good times. Saw Pow Pow, Hermann *who has a shinin' new raquet imported from HK* and Po-Kan also. We just kinda rallied for 40 minutes on a court. Didn't really play a game. But yeah first time at Westview in ages and last for the summer, as they close down for the summer season. Oh well, back to UCC it is...  For the rest of my day, I woke up at 1030 today, and did my daily devos. Today I read 2 Corinthians 5, mostly focusing on verses 11-21, about the "Ministry of Reconciliation," and how God reconciled himself through Christ. At first while reading verse 21, I didn't really understand it, but eventually I got it after reading it over many times, and finally understood that the "him" in the sentence is referred to Christ, who was perfect in all ways to be our living sacrifice, so that we might "become the righteousness of God." The verse actually reads this:  "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." -2 Corinthians 5:21  That verse really made me think about how much God loved us to sacrifice his own son for us, even though we have rebuked him so much. To think that God has endured through this for over 2000 years, and many of the people around me whine and complain about their lives being all crummy because apparently "no one there for them" *Even though God is right beside them* and their issues have been going on for maybe like what? 2 months? God has been havin' this stuff thrown at him for 2000 years, and Job even had bad times thrown at him for 70 years, and he STILL loved our Heavenly Father. If people asked for God's help through many things in life, most likely they wouldn't whine about the crapiness of it as much. Why must there be such an opaque wall set up by Satan around so many people's eyes? It's as though Satan has put a blindfold over many of us. If only people would just ask for God to remove it, and not lose all hope and begin to whine.  ...Well after morning devos, I went downstairs for some lunch. Afterwards, I basically photoshopped, coded, drummed, PS2'd, MSN'd, and ran around for a bit outside. That was the main outline of my afternoon in no particular order. Afterwards though, @ 7pm I went to Westview for some baddy, which as mentioned already I had a losing record, but it was still good times.  At Westview, Gavin kinda had a hard night with his badminton skills, and Josh was PURE clutch in our game, with me adding some luck haha, but still losing in an tight game of 15-14. Also got to chat with Josh about starting a Men's prayer group at LCAC, and also about the trip to Canada's Wonderland. Hope that thing will work.  Anyways, yeah here I am now blogging. I think I'm going to go watch Leno now though. And then sleep.  Until tomorrow..  Later.

       7/7/04 Happy B-day dad...   Yup today's my dad's 46th birthday. And it'll be my 16th in...3 months? Oi to think I'll be 46 in 30 years...  Today didn't really do much. Dad had his b-day celebrated on Sunday since he had to work today anyways.  So I woke up around 1030ish today and began doing my devos. Read up on Acts 2 today when Peter addresses the crowd about how the Holy Spirit was with them. Afterwards ate some breakfast from McD's and then went out to get my glasses, and also buy some clothes.  Apparently though my glasses were sent to White Oaks because their machine broke yesterday. So to kill time for another hour, bought my clothes then, then picked up my grandma from church, since she had fellowship this morning.  After taking the other people home, once again I go to Masonville to get my glasses. Saw Lina walking there while I was driving *haha* and then FINALLY got my glasses. Refitted lenses with no scratches or chips ^_^. Afterwards since it was already 130, and I had to get to head2head by 2, I just told mom to drop me off at a bus stop and I bused my way to downtown.  Muahahahaha though John and Josh called me saying I was late, really I was still 5 minutes early...ACTUALLY 5 minutes early, unlike Lina's watch. Anyways back to the subject *gah my writing is depriving over the summer* I arrived at the bus stop, and ran my way to h2h to prove I was early.  When I got there, my phone said I was 1 minute late, John's phone said I'm 40 seconds early, and Josh's watch said I was 3 minutes late or something like that. Point is, I made it, and then Arjun came too, and we commenced gaming for 3 hours.  *3 hours and a bit later, back at home*  I am pretty sure you probably don't care about my bus ride back, so I'll just get straight to the point...  Drumming has been a "baat poh" lately *Ha..Ha..Ha...I wonder if Dan or Gavin is reading this,* due to my lack of time sense for triplets...quarter note triplets. They are probably the most annoying thing to conquer in music. So drummed for about an hour today, with 40 minutes of it trying to figure out triplets of all sorts. I count in 3's now.  Afterwards, for the rest of the night *timeframe from 8-11* I spent an hour from 8-9 figuring out abit of CSS and HTML, and then from 9-11 watched "The Replacement Killers" on CityTV...  Even though Mira Sorvino is very "yeet" *Ha,ha,ha what a crummy joke I know*, holy crap does that movie suck. The plot is HORRIBLE. I watched it because when I first watched it when I was 10 I didn't get it, hence why it sucked, but now when I watch it again....IT STILL SUCKS. Watching Chow-Yun-Fat run around with Mira from some Chinese mob that eventually gets owned by a UPS truck, a few pistols and a TOTAL lack of Martial Arts *WTH!? Chow-Yun-Fat with NO martial arts? W....T...H...!?!?!?!?!?!?* makes this movie VERY crummy, except for the fact Mira is "yeet" *SMPGO! Jokes Dan haha...* Maybe musical triplets aren't the worst thing in the world...  So here I am now, blogging yet AGAIN. 192nd post of the year. Wow...almost @ 200. Well anyways I'm out for now, probably going to watch TV again or chat on MSN.  By the way, SMPGO *siuing my pei goo off* is the new form of LMAO.  Cheers.

       7/6/04 My first day of volunteer....=)   Hmm not much else happened today...other than that...I got up pretty late *around 11ish* and got ready for my volunteering...which took up the time fram between 1pm-3pm.  After comin' back home for a bit, I had to go back because I forgot something.  That took up most of the time until dinner, ate, and then here I am now blogging at 830pm. Yup....that pretty much sums up my day. I'm using my old glasses right now since my new pair is being fixed @ Lenscrafters at the moment.  Until tomorrow....  Later.

       7/5/04 Quick little sidenote...   Was blogsurfin' just now while waiting for commercials to end for Conan O'Brian to get back on, and read something pretty interesting.  When I was typing my blog on Sunday, and I hit the communion part complainin' about the people sitting beside me, I was wondering if I was the only one that even noticed.  Apparently not. I read Gavin's blog, and I'm happy to know that the others around me are mature enough to realize that that behaviour was really immature. So it's nice to see how we are all maturing more and more Spiritually and how we can all relate to another, but I really hope that we can help the others grow more. But still when I think about Communion, I wonder how some people can just be so thick-headed and not get it...

       7/5/04 Milling about...   Same old same old. Today wasn't very exciting, so this blog's going to be very brief.  Woke up aroudn 1030ish today, and started doing my devos. Read Ephesians 4 and about how we all work together as one body of Christ.  I have absolutely what I did to occupy the time from 12-4 though, a big mixture of drumming, PS2, compy, and chatting with a lot of people on MSN. Then I got bored...  And went to play ball for an hour. Afterwards...  Came home, ate some food, and off to UCC for some cardio.  I actually ran 30 minutes nonstop burning around 360 calories *GASP I CAN RUN THAT LONG!* Did some weights, some more cardio, and then left for home.  Finally got some HYPE stuff over with. Canada's Wonderland is a green light with 8 confirmed people, and also I've FINALLY sent out the email for coffeehouse to WLAC.  I'm pretty tired now, probably going to head to sleep. First day of volunteer work tomorrow haha.  Later.

       7/4/04 Rebecky's leavin' for Winnepeg *Awww*   Ahh yes, LCAC is getting smaller and smaller over the summer, with Steph in HK, and Rebecky goin' to Winnipeg for a bit, hmm...Carmen and Lina are the only two girls left. At least the two talk to one another...so it can't be that bad. But whom shall I call spoonface now? =(. Jokes jokes Rebecky =P. Oh well...she'll be back in a bit anyways hahaha...  Even though service started at 11am today, I still ahd to get up at 830, as our Bible Study class was at 915 instead. So got up, usual morning stuff, then went to grab Lina and Jason and off to church then.  Getting there, we were some of the first people there. So we kinda lounged around for a bit, dad made some garlic toast, so munched on some of that, and then eventually the others showed up. Carmen actually came somewhat early for once, and then after some chatting and stuff, we started our Bible Study on Daniel 4.  This chapter was the one where Nebuchadnezzar turns crazy, but then eventually goes back to a sane king, and he finally realizes how it is God that rules everything, and not him. Earlier, the reason why he was stripped away of everything was because he took credit for everything, but now he realizes that God runs this world. Well after an hour, we then finished the study, and then had some refreshments before heading upstairs for the joint service today.  Service was actually one of the best joint services I've been to. Pastor Mackness' message I thought was awesome. He spoke from Numbers Chapter 21 today, which tells of how ignorant the Israelites were while in the desert. Even after God had provided for them basically everything (food, water, protection, etc.) they STILL don't get the point that there is a God. So in the story, it speaks of how God then sent serpents to punish the Israelites for their ignorance. However, since God is merciful, he then told Moses to make a staff with a bronze snake wrapped around it *the current WHO symbol if I'm not wrong* and those who look to it will be saved.  I found this interesting, as when Pastor Mackness related it back to us, he did it very well. In that time, they had the  bronze snake on a staff. In our current time, we have Jesus Christ to look to in times of trouble. All you have to do is look up. Another reason why I liked today's sermon was because of how Pastor Mackness presented it. I don't mean to offend him or anything, but sometimes his sermons in english service are somewhat bland. However, even though I slept a wee bit today by accident *thanks Carmen for waking me up* I was about to fall asleep again, but for some reason the way Pastor D spoke today, it was so powerful. The expression, the power, the determined force that seemed to be driving him forth, probably one of the most exciting sermons I've heard from him in a while. So yeah after Carmen poked me awake, and after my temptation to sleep more, well that temptation sorta ended, I listened attentively to the remaining 30 minutes or so of the sermon. I actually remember this one very well, and I think I will for a while...  Communion then came along. I now know how my parents felt when I acted like a jackass up in service. I never really realized it until today when some people sitting beside me couldn't shut up for the whole time. I don't blame one of them as I had already explained, but the other person should have absolutely no excuse. I just hope that next time she'll be able to smarten up a little bit. Oh well, still managed to get through it, just kind of annoying with some voices beside me murmuring through the meditation time.  Afterwards, we headed downstairs, talked for a bit, and in the end I got Jason and Calvin over to my place. Jason, Gavin and I decided to have imitation martial arts battles, with Jason and Gavin never actually hitting one another just shifting up and down, and me chasing Jason around with one foot kicking the whole time and hobbling on the other. Effective way of fighting =P....  Afterwards for the afternoon basically just DDR'd and NFL Street for the time. Then they all left and I had a BBQ for dad's B-day, which is actually on the 7th but he's workin' then.  Anyways....I can't think of much else to blog about. Jason branded my house as being "boring" pretty much in his blog, if you want to see that. OH I REMEMBER NOW....  HOW THE HECK DID GREECE WIN EUROCUP!?  Now I'm normally not a soccer fan, but I still sure as hell know that Greece isn't exactly a top dog team. TOTAL underdog if you ask me, I mean portugal is underdog enough. EuroCup turned out REALLY strange, totally upside down from what I was expecting. Marcello and many other people cheering for Portugal are probably wide-eyed right now at the defeat that Portugal had received today. I for one don't really care, but I was rootin' for Portugal today if anyone. Things change since 2002 huh =P.  So yeah I'm going to go now, kinda bored, so yeah probably sleeping early for once tonight.  Those are my thoughts and rants for today.  Later.

       7/3/04 I ACTUALLY DID WORK IN THE HOUSE...HYPE movie night...fun times haha   Yup, back into blogging. Today was a bit more special than most Saturdays though, as it was my first time doing some work around the house since...shovelling the driveway in winter probably? Yeah I know I'm a lazy kid, which is why I actually did something for a change today.  Well my lazy day started at 1130 or so, waking up after dreaming about some REALLY stupid things again. I dreamt that I somehow became some zoologist in the Outback hunting down rare animals, and for some reasons hyenas live there now, and yeah...then I woke up after I caught it with my "team." It was weird I know. Anyways after I woke up, went to brush teeth and stuff, and then ate lunch. Jason called and said he'd be at my place around 3 so he can get a lift to HYPE, but eventually he delayed it to 5pm. So after eating, I decided to play NFL street for a bit, until my dad told me I should help with some work. I agreed, and this is actually the first time I did work WITHOUT pay...  Yes this concept is still somewhat new to me, I mean work without pay? But I agreed to, and then my first job was to fill in a crack in the side of the house with concrete. It was actually somewhat amusing for some reason, and I really enjoy doing stupid things like that. So while I was doing that, dad went to grab gas for the lawnmower. I managed to do most of the work, but when dad came back he put the finishing touches on it anyways. So while he was putting on finishing touches *mostly just smoothening out concrete* I went back downstairs and played some PS2.  After a bit of that, I then used the lawnmower, something I haven't used in almost 2 years. Yeah I've been VERY lazy. So I cut most of the backyard lawn, well until the gas ran out, and then dad took over after the gas refill. We kinda switched jobs, he mowed and I trimmed with that weed/grass trimmer thing. It was pretty fun...well until I ran into the swingset in my backyard from my childhood days. I forgot I'm a bit taller then from when I was little, so yeah...ow. Well, after trimming all the grass, and mowing the lawn, AND filling in cracks on the house with concrete, I can  NOW  truly say.... *quote taken from Rona*   "I AM A HANDYMAN!" =P   Well after the actually productive afternoon, Jason just got to my place, and we played some NFL Street before we had to leave for HYPE. Well actually I ate first, Jason played some NBA street, AND THEN we left to Vince's place for the HYPE movie night.  Well when I got there, apparently they were going to go back to blockbuster since the movie they got, "Secondhand Lions" is crap according to Gavin. So I called shotgun, jacked Rebecca's shotgun seat, and off we went to Blockbuster's.  You never know how hard it is to rent a movie with minimal violence/sexual content UNTIL you actually have to TRY to. Since the HYPE meeting is a church event, we had to find something that SORT OF goes along with it. So in the end, we got the movie "Radio." I was going to see that in theatres originally, but I don't know what got in the way of it. Meh, so I finally got to see it tonight, and I heard it's a pretty good movie, so we all agreed to get it.  Getting back to Vince's, Some people were downstairs playing PS2. Andy showed up today, which I thought was pretty cool that he took up the courage to come to the HYPE meeting with people like us haha. Rise to Honour actually looked like a pretty cool game, but of course with us there, we made the game look stupid as we do with any game =P. For example:  "BREAKDANCE DAMN YOU!" *Spins right analog stick rapidly and Jet Li does a flare* -Jason "LEI YEE WAI LEI HO GING?! NGOR JUONG GING GOR LEI!" -Josh and Gavin butchering a line from the game "Hey look public fire barrels for the hobos. I never knew Hong Kong was THAT generous" -Jason  Well after playing that for a bit, we finally started watching the movie, with Vince still trying to figure out a good message haha. In the end though I don't think there was a CLEAR intended message, but to me the movie spoke about determination and also the care that humans SHOULD have for one another. There was actually a line in the movie where Ed Harris' character spoke about Radio as someone who treats people the way many of us would want others to treat us. I thought the movie was really good. First drama I appreaciate in a while heh. Even with that in the bag though, us being us HYPErs still managed to make it look somewhat dumb sadly.  "Whoa, that place is like the white Barbershop" "Is that his daughter?" "No it's his mother." "You'll never know, they're rednecks." "He didn't say thank you for the coffee." "Imagine if that banner they run through was made out of rubber. Then they'd bounce off of it....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA." "HAHAHAHA that white guy's the only one laughing"  And the jokes go on and on, but those are some that I remember, for either the sheer stupidity or it was actually funny at the moment. Oh yeah and throughout the movie, Dan would pretend to flex, then say some really random thing in a deep football-imitating voice haha. I still don't see how we managed to poke fun at a movie like that. Yup....maturity at it's best ehehe...  After the movie, some of us went to ball, others stayed downstairs playing PS2. I kinda did both, but more playing PS2 w/ Rebecky and Brian. Watching Rebecky play PS2 is actually pretty funny, so I don't regret my descision haha. Afterwards they all came in, and we played some NBA Live 2004 for a bit. Jason played Rebecky first, and like usual Rebecca was shrieking, yelling, and screaming through the whole game as she mashes the buttons on the controller as well as a potato masher mashes potatoes. Played a bit of that, then had to drive Jason back to his place, and of course myself back home.  So here I am now, bloggin' yet again, reflecting back on my day. Tomorrow we have joint service, so service starts at 11am. Bible Study's around 9:15am or so though, so no sleeping in =(. Oh well, I wonder what stupid things will happen to me tomorrow haha.  Oh yeah Maisie leaves tomorrow too for wherever her cadet camp tomorrow. And in her own words...  "Aww Poor Muffin." Except this time it's probably directed to her =P.  Later.

       7/2/04 Happy Sweet 16th Jenn!   Wishin' you happy 16th Jenn, hope it brings you to new heights *ha,ha,ha* and of course your G1, and growin' more in the one and only God =). Best wishes...   On a sidenote, I can't feel my arms...  Today, being the first time I did a workout in....almost a month, it was tiring. When I say work out I mean a full one, and not just a few sets of bench. My arms are literally dead right now. Good way to end the day, tonight I won't be staying up late at least....REALLY tired right now.  My day started off at exactly 1054am this morning with a phonecall from Rebecca. She called me 6 minutes before my alarm clock rang, which kind of annoys me. I'm very picky with my sleep. Well so we started planning for today, because I told her I'd go for lunch with her and some other people today. Well in the end, after calling many people, only Rebecca, Jason and I ended up going. Before I left, decided I'd try to call Jenn *promised her I would for her b-day* but got her cell's answering machine, which she would explain doesn't even work. Caught her on MSN though, so wished her well, and off I went to downtown to meet up with Rebecky...  *cell rings* "Hello?" "Joe where are you?" "I can see you...I'm in the minivan apporaching your stop?" "Where?" "Here." "Hmm....OH I SEE YOU. Bye." *click*  Now in downtown, me and Rebecky meet up and then wait for Jason. After the clock struck 1pm, I then tried to call him to see where he was. Apparently he was across the street. Funny part is we could never see one another because 3 phone booths happen to be right in our way. Eventually he shifted though...and "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH there you are" came through the phone. So we met up, and decided to head down to the Palasad for the afternoon.  So we got there, and began to pool, order nachos and pop. I'm horrible at pool, but still managed to win our 9-ball game by sinking the last ball, which was the only ball I sunk haha. Fun times though, some stupid shots, and some pretty cool shots. The nachos were good, and my salad was good too. I'm definitely goin' back there sometime. They have good food, and the games are amusing ^_^. Rebecca playing NASCAR was pretty funny as all you hear are screams and gasps as she struggles to get around the track, almost sideswipping Jason on one REALLY fast pass. Jason then spent the remnants of his tokens on Silent Scope 2, and then we left the place. The bill only came to around $31.40. Not bad for 3 people. Well my salad adds on an extra 7 bucks, plus my tip, so in total....  $39.40 was the total amount we spent there today.  So Jason walked back to his place, while I walked Rebecky to her bus stop. Well, in the end to the London Life building where I got a lift with her also. She isn't exactly very good with directions, not saying I am, but I knew the area better than her so kept watch she didn't get lost haha. So in the end I got a ride from her family, and got home around 4pmish....  Where by then I called Jenn...this time actually getting an answer since I called her house. Apparently I do talk fast, as the first person *probably a parent* that answered the phone didn't know what the heck I was talking about, but eeeeventually I got the message that I talk fast, and slowed ....it....down.....very...... SSSSLLOW. After her almost convincing me that no Jenn existed at the place, and then the person FINALLY understood I said "Jenn" and not some other english word....  "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH you said JENN...Just a minute..."  So eventually got through to her, said our hi's, chatted for a bit, and then went off to drum around for a bit. A whole phone convo summed into half a sentence aren't I brilliant =P. I'm hoping I can improve a lot over the summer, because I'm horrible with fills and stuff right now. I wonder how I'll manage with 3 instruments next year...trombone, piano, and drums...oi.  Ate a bit of stuff, and then headed out to UCC with Marcello to work out. So we got there, balled for a bit for warmup, I'm horrible at ball, and then started to work out.  *2 hours later*  So after the workout, decided to walk home, just chill and talk. Beats driving, and it's more environmentally friendly =). Then after we split up, I started to jog back. I need more stamina...it's horrible. So ran from Platts all the way home basically, and here I am now....  Once again, blogging, chatting, editing the splash page for tenmore.net, and probably going to sleep soon.   Aah almost forgot...Maisie's leavin' for camp in two days or sometin'! Hope she has fun up in the Canadian North...well Northern Ontario...so not-so-North haha.   Did I miss anything in my blog now? Hmm...don't think so =).  'Nites. Ow....arms....BOKAN!....ooow...

       8/9/04 Such a long day....but fun =)   ....still so tired from badminton. Heh I just got back around 15 minutes ago, and wow I actually was able to play so much tonight. Good news for baddy today was that I actually won more than I lost... I think.  Wait never mind I was 2-3. Hey that's still 40% ehehe. But two of the loss games were singles games, as I got my butt whooped by Jane and Gavin. Against Gavin something like 15-3, and 15-6 against Jane. Yup....my singles skills are horrible =).  But there was still more to my day.....as today was a long and tiring day.  So I got up at about 1030 today, and sat around for a bit. Eventually Jason came over as he had nothing to do either, and we played PS2 basically until 4 when he left and Gavin and I had to go to a meeting. Fight Night 2004 is an awesome game.  Anyways after Jason left and Gavin came, we got ready and then headed over to WLAC where we have our meeting today to discuss what our two churches are going to do. So we got there about a minute late, and then met up with Josh and then went to Pastor Graham's office. So we had a meeting until 440ish, which was really short, and then went to Angelo's for some early dinner, as me and Gavin were going to go to badminton right after eating.  So after eating and waiting for Josh's mom, me and Gavin then walked back to my house. Oh yeah I had my first panzerotti today haha. Anywho back on subject....  Got home, mom drove us to badminton, and then we played a lot of games. I'm too lazy to blog much more.  Now I will go.  Bye.

       8/8/04 Average Sunday....   So the aftermath of Wonderland....  10 hours of solid sleep....aaaahhh yes. Unfortunately I did miss Bible Study this morning, but I still made it to joint service. So woke up, picked up Jason, and then headed to church.  Joint service today had Don Brooks speaking. He had a pretty cool message about the church, and revolved it around the story in Matthew where Jesus named Simon to Peter....well one of the Simon's. The one that didn't have a brother I think it was?  After service, helped set up for communion *which by the way after me and Gavin's ranting had much better behaviour from all* and then went home. Jason came over today too and we had Dim Sum for lunch from Dragon Court.  After eating we went to Roger's Video to rent a game. We ended up with Fight Night 2004....  And I've been playing it since which explains the shortness of my blog haha.  Finally got a Toronto trip planned out. I am officially going on Wednesday this week =), and the 6crew ft. David *hahaha doesn't that sound like a cheesy rap group* will be meeting up sometime in the next two weeks. Can't wait to see them again hahaha.  Anyways....that's my day. I got owned by Maisie at Minesweeper again, and was nice to talk to Niki again.  Anyways yeah....NOW that's it.  Later.

       8/7/04 So...tired....but Wonderland w/ HYPE...so...fun...     FINALLY back home now. WHEW what a day though. LOOOONG and tiring, but at the same time REALLY fun. Wonderland was already pretty cool when I brought Gavin and Dave and 'em up every year, but this year having the whole HYPE group out there was really cool haha.  So I'll start off my blog about today starting really early, to be exact, last night.  Even though I did say I was going to sleep early....eventually that never happened. Well I tried, everyone did, but in the end neither me nor Gavin could really get to sleep until 2am. I got hungry around 12am, so went downstairs to have some milk and raisin bread. I realize I'm probably the only person that likes that combo of food, but guess what it is good so bite me if you think it's gross. After eating, the house then felt really humid for some reason, and then eventually I didn't use any blankets and slept on top of all of them. Then I decided to open the window a bit, and then it got cold, so I resorted to using two of the three blankets. Eeeventually I would get so sleep, only from the fact though that I was too bored to do anything else. I was thinking about watching TV downstairs but was afraid I'd wake up Gavin, so yeah scrapped that idea and tossed and turned until around 2am. THEN I finally got some shut eye......  Until 6am.  Then I couldn't sleep again. I woke up, originally hoping to get in an extra 30 minutes of shut eye, but in the end thought "screw it" and then just went to get ready for the day. After showering and everything, Gavin was then awake, and we started putting the mats back into my car after me cleaning the things yesterday. They were still a bit damp, so we tried to stomp them dry as well as we could *I'm not about to use a vacuum at 6am in the morning and wake up the neighbourhood* and then shoved them in the car. Then came putting one of the seats back in. Eventually I did it myself with a bit of help from Gavin, after I finally remembered what I did yesterday. So technically Gavin and I were underway and ready to go by 6:55am or so, but NOOOOOOOOOOO.......  My parents took FOREVER to get ready. So while me and Gavin waited, we played some NFL Street haha, where I FINALLY beat him,er would have. I had a gamebreaker coming up and I needed one more touchdown and I had possession, so I would have won =). Eventually we didn't leave my house until 725am or so, rushing to Carmen's place so they wouldn't complain much longer. So got Carmen, she was wondering why we were so late, and then Jason, who was REALLY wondering why we were so late. Oh yeah and also we filled the car up with gas and stuff also, and by a healthy 8am, we were FINALLY out on the 401.  Hmm for the first little while me and Gavin ate, then listened to some of my music, and then we tried sleeping. Eventually I did manage to fall asleep, but then Gavin woke me up when he tried to steal my cellphone. SSSSSEEEEERIOUSLY try to not wake me up if you're going to steal it. So after being awoken from a 25 minute nap, we then all began to talk since none of us could really get some shut eye in the car. I don't know how many convo subjects we had in the car, but too many to count. From sports to music to cooking, yup it was all there haha. Lame jokes of course were in there also, and also Gavin's all so famous quote:   "Flex....no flex....flex....no flex...."   Now at the same time he was doing something that was really disturbing, and probably scarred Jason, Carmen, and my mind for much of the trip.  During the time in the car though, when I was feelin' somewhat not so good, I did some thinking. Great time killing I know. But I was thinking about just how in the world I can tolerate listening to trance music and stuff like that. I think I came to a conclusion:  There are no lyrics.  Well much of it anyways, and if there are lyrics, MOST of the time it's about POSITIVE things and not about suicide, death, gunshot wounds, or how their life sucked before they made crappy songs about their sucky lives. I'm not referring to any other kind of music here *coughrapandhip-hopcough* but seriously some of that junk out there these days is retarded. I mean speaking out about depression is not usually something public until now, but WAS what you talk to psychology counselors about. I think that's why I like trance music and stuff like that, because it's so...well.....tranquil I guess you can say. Kind of funny how at one point I made fun of Tommy's techno and stuff *which I listen to now* because it had no lyrics. Would have never  thought now I like it because of that reason hehe.  So after the 2 hour long car ride out to Wonderland, we were FINALLY there. So first person I see there is Dave, then Rebecky, and then the rest of the people at the main gate. We were all waiting for Ken then, as he was running a wee bit late. So we all just kind of stood there, many of us needing to go to the jawn, but we did wait until Ken came, then most of the guys ran to the jawn, and pretty much all the girls ran to the jawn. Then we jammed all our stuff into lockers, and began our walk to the first ride of the day...Tomb Raider.  The lineup was almost an hour and a half, and the ride is pretty crappy. A few of us went to ride Sledge Hammer while we waited, and the others just lined up and chatted. Other than the fact we are riding lying down, the ride goes damn slow, and it is pretty lame. But yeah we all went on it as a group, and it is the new feature attraction so meh why not just to say I went on the sad thing. Afterwards, we all then split, with Josh, Calvin, Jason, Gavin, Dave and I going to one group and the others into the other (Carmen, Jeffany, Andy, Rebecky, Ken, and Wenders).  So this is where I basically talk about the group I was in, since I don't know where the others were.  So first ride we decided to go on was Minebuster. Fun as usual, bit bumpy, but meh that's the beauty of the old rickety thing =). Josh overcame his fear of these things which is awesome, and it was Jason's first time on a Wonderland roller coaster that actually wasn't panzy. So we all had fun for that being our first ride, and quickly shifted gears to Vortex.  Lines weren't that bad right now, so we got through Vortex in about 30-40 minutes. This one was obviously a bit more intense as you all know, but also more fun =). Jason and Josh said they were still fine, and that was when we all then introduced them to the best roller coaster there...  The beautiful steel structure standing there known as Top Gun.  Ahh yes one of my favourites. Just the fact it's the fastest and most crazy one in the park is probably enough said. Anyways Jason didn't really say much until he actually saw the drop and went down it going "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH SHIT!" Josh I think I heard him scream from when I was on the ground, as me and Dave rode the car before the others. But the fun came with a hefty price. almost TWO hours of waiting PLUS downtime for the STUPID THING BECAUSE IT WAS BROKEN. But it's all worth it just to go back on Top Gun again. Plus it was cool watching Jason and Josh going on it for the first time. So afterwards, we then had to head to lunch, as we all agreed to meet at 3pm at that gigantic globe thingy.  I can't type well right now as for some reason NOW I feel dizzy.  But anyways back on track...  With us being early and on time, and the others being 15 minutes late, we FINALLY got to eat at 330. I was starving, so was Calvin, as the two of us basically went on Top Gun with an empty stomach which got me light-headed haha. So me and Dave split on a sub, Gavin had his own sub, and some of the other guys pitched in for a pizza. Wonderland food........as usual was really expensive but oh well what can you do. Oh yeah and today, I saw one of the coolest things yet in one of the funniest ways while waiting for the other people for lunch.  ...While Jason was on the phone looking for the others, I was kind of just sitting there looking around, then I see this black kid with a Houston jersey that at first I thought was a jersey dress since it went down past his shins and I was thinking "the hell doesn't he know that's a dre......HOLY SHIT IT'S AN AUTHENTIC." After FINALLY realizing the kid just bought a really long jersey that was too long for his own good, I finally poked Jason to look at the jersey, and both of us just thought "whoa......an authentic Yao jersey...." *drool.* But it was kind of funny how at first I thought it was a jersey dress because that kid was 4'11 and his jersey was almost his height. JERSEY'S AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THAT LONG.  Anyways after lunch, we continued our ways to other rides. The groups were basically the same, but we all decided to go to the arcade. A lot of us went to play Time Crisis 3, while me and Calvin basically stuck on DDR. Of course like usual there were those really crazy dudes, then us, with me being the better end DDRer out of all of us. So I had my share of the fun playing heavy, and I think Calvin and Josh also had a fun time playing standard/heavy. Jason, Ken, and Gavin owned on TC3, and the girls they kind of ditched us and went somewhere haha.  Afterwards though we went out and decided to go on a ride. So, after much choosing.....  And deciding....  And voting......  And thinking....  ........  ........ ........  ........  We decided to watch the dive show HAHAHA. That was probably the dumbest thing I know but meh....concluded drop zone line was too long for what you get, and we got bored and decided to sit and watch something. Some of the dives were cool though, but wow was the plot horrible.  After bearing through that though, thank goodness it was only 30 minutes long, Carmen, Jason, Dave, Gavin, Josh, Calvin, Jeffany and Ken then decided to go on Dragon fire. I always liked this one a bit because of double loop so why not =).  Yup and that was the ride. Short line, decent ride. It was fun though still, and hearing Josh's imitation screams is always hilarious.  After that, then a few of us went on a final run on Skyrider. That was horrid as we would have been on time for dinner, but NOOOOOOO stupid delays making Josh, Dave and Jeffany, and I late for dinner...  ...we made it though finally though, and quickly rushed to the globe once again. It was already 725, so Josh, Dave and I quickly ran to grab a funnel cake and munched on it on the way back.  Afterwards, the eating and everything, we then kind of hung out at the drop-off zone for a bit *aren't we cool, hey some other people were picnicing in their trunks at the drop-off zone* while we waited for Calvin's and Josh & Rebecky's parents. After everyone was finally there, it was time to go home =(. After a day of fun.....  COMES A RETARDED/STUPID/FUNNY RIDE BACK HOME.  Actually no not really hahaha =). Well there were jokes and stuff of course, but lots of the time in my car was recalling what happened today with all of us. Well Jason, Gavin, and I had similar stories since we stuck together with the others, but it was nice hearing Carmen's stories from her time with Wenders and them. Actually I wished I had spent more time with them. Then again, Dave was really only aquianted with the guys. I mean, he kind of knows Carmen but kind of from LOOONG time ago, and Jeffany and Andy technically know them but not well either. So yeah had to stick with Dave and the guys for most of the day. But yeah it was nice to know Carmen got to get to know Jeffany and Andy better =).  After telling one another about our days, we spent some time cloud watching for some reason. Carmen....er....Gavin.....one of the two....maybe Jason? ANYWAYS point is THEY *HAH problem solved* pointed out that this cloud looked like a helicopter.....  ....and then I butchered it with details with me being the geeky one haha....  I thought it looked more like a plane....er afterwards with some shifting the Houston old logo because I claimed that the rotor was too far back haha. Then another cloud looked like a tank, and I thought another one looked like a volcano, which got the other ones going....   HUH!?!?!??!   But anyways that's another point. I just happen to be the ARTISTIC ONE....  *this is when Gavin coughs and Jason shifts his glasses hahaha*  .....so after the cloud watching we were all going to sleep, but once again failed. So after I lost z103.5's radio feed, I gave my CD player to Jason to listen to. I got him hooked on some DJ Mystik and Sylver stuff, along with a side of Foggy and INOJ too haha. I've got another person to appreciate the music I like =). It still peeves me off how a lot of people on the sound of the word "techno" INSTANTLY think of MOBY and DARUDE.....  THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO TECHNO/THAT STUFF MUSIC.  Getting that point out and out of my system. Back to where I was. Oh yeah, then Gavin and Carmen each started to listen, and I pointed them to the ones I personally liked a lot anyways. Eventually....surprisingly...that took up the rest of the time back to London....  ....along with a pit stop at a McD's, where we coincedencally bumped into Calvin and them haha. I bought a coffee and two burgers, but when we got out....  Traffic Jam.  So we ended up eating in the car there, and eventually Calvin even left before us. They decided to go head first into the traffic jam, while my dad decided to wait. Eventually though Wendy called and said it wasn't that bad after the McD's area, so we headed out. She was right once again =) When is my Kai-Jei ever wrong haha =P.  So we finally got back on the road, with me getting in a debate with dad and mom about why American SUV/pick-ups own Jap ones. In the end like usual we couldn't come to an agreement, but that's the smaller fish.  There's a bigger fish that I fried....and OWNED hahaha >=).  So for some reason afterwards we got into a debate about whales and if they're cold blooded or warm blooded. Now I know they are warm-blooded, but for SOME strange reason dad said they were cold blooded, even though that means they'd die in the Arctic. Don't remember how I got into this debate, but it was well worth it. I made 20 bucks hahaha, after showing him in fine print that whales, indeed, yes they are.....  Warm-blooded animals.......LIKE ALL OTHER MAMMALS.  Anyways that was what happened after I took everyone home. When I got into London, took Gavin home first, then Jason, then Carmen.....  Ahh yes it was a nice day indeed. One to not be forgotten for awhile hahaha.....  HYPE's next big thing: I'm hoping a camping trip =).  Later.

       8/6/04 So....tired......     Tiring day today...so this is going to be a short blog...  Basically woke up, ate some food....and then went to UCC with Lina.  Played baddy until about 4ish, grabbed some food, and then came home to wash the car.  Gavin then came, as he's crashing at my place tonight.  Going to sleep soon since I gotta get up at like 6am tomorrow for Toronto.  That's pretty much it.  Have a good one.  Bye.

       8/5/04 Badminton..getting....bearable..   Muahahaha I actually managed to play two well played games today, except in a fluky mishap, Gavin and Jane actually managed to beat me and Steve in a close neck-to-neck game...they won 3-1 in the end which sucks, but at least I still won another game today haha. so 1-3 in total today, ugh....today was horrible for luck....even on the PS2, Gavin managed to beat me by somehow making 4 interceptions in a row on NFL Street....this was all computer too....Jason can't even do that! Oh well anyways.....  Other than that...  Well this morning I woke up around 11 or so. I've woken up from dreams at 630am for 3 nights in a row now which is kind of weird, but eventually I manage to get back to sleep anyways. So after waking up for the 2nd time, I then headed downstiars to watch a bit of TV, then go on compy for a wee bit. Afterwards ate some breakfast, and then drummed around for a bit. Afterwards, around 130 or so, went out to  buy some new shorts at the Adidas Outlet.  Other than getting shorts there today, Grandma also had to go get her passport photo taken at Wal-Mart. Eventually I also bought a new cordless phone there, something that my house really was in dire need of since all my old ones suck, and FINALLY I have one that doesn't static up from one end of the house to the other.  Coming back from there, I was getting ready to go to the WLAC meeting, and Gavin even arrived at my place. That was when Pastor Graham then called and told us he had to bail out because he had to go see a doctor about being hit by a softball. So after hearing the news, Gavin was surprised too, and eventually he stayed at my place until baddy @ 6. Josh I tried to reach him on cell and home, but he was not on either, so in the end he called me and asked what was happening. So yeah now we are rescheduling for Monday probably.  After that strange event, Gavin went to SC for a bit, and I got further in NFL Street. Then came the utter fluke of Gavin defeating me with ALL the games having at least 4+ interceptions...NOT USER PICKS.....INTERCEPTIONS. Stupid luck always being on the other dude's side....blargh...  Anyways afterwards went to play baddy. As I mentioned before, I got wrecked in 3/4 games. Gavin I came close to beating in singles, until I got tired and then lsot 15-8. I still can't believe me and Steve managed to LOSE our 8 point advantage and end up losing 3-1 (tie breaker set). Grr.....  That was pretty much my day for today. Tomorrow probably going to play more badminton, and then also have to clean the car for Saturday. Least I'm getting paid to do it.  Anyways that's it for now. Go about and surf other blogs now.  Shoo.

       8/4/04 "Now, you click in the white bar where the website is, and click there...nono not there, yeah there. Ok now start typing...good we are at google now. Now type in what you need to search for....you might want a space....nono don't have to backspace....wait....yeah...sorta...I think that's it..."   ....two hours of today was spent doing that, and stuff that resembles that. I'm getting better at doing this whole tech tutor shabang now though I think =). Everything seems to click now, and people aren't as hard to work with on the computer as I thought it would have been. So yeah, after working here for 4 weeks, I'm actually beginning to enjoy my job....when I'm actually doing something. The moments of the shift where there's no helpless person in need of help...  YEESH CAN IT GET BORING.  So I sat there for my shift of two hours, reading the papers when I wasn't helping someone, and helping people when I wasn't reading the papers. Dream Team got wrecked by the Italians haha, and apparently the Jays pulled another win out. Also apparently there's this full body swimsuit from Speedo that costs $500 bucks that people are actually going to use at the Olympics. Yup, the news these days. Oh yeah and cell phones are more popular then ever. Anyways, on top of the helping and reading when I was bored out of my mind, I also saw Steph Bourdage there. Apparently she was volunteerin' too. Also I finally got my long-awaited volunteer shirt.  So getting back from volunteering, I returned 50 First Dates on my way home, and also bought some food at Angelo's. Then came home, ate, and SCed for a bit, and drummed. After mom was finally done watching her baat poh shows, I then continued watching Enemy at the Gates, as I still wasn't done it. Watched up to some part, and then went to work out for a bit.  Coming home from working out, I am now blogging, chatting, and just finished eating. Rubbing in the fact that Roddick lost to Federer at the Masters or whatever  to Gloria is funny haha. Also still trying to plan out what I'm going to do when I'm out in Toronto, and wondering what tomorrow's meeting with WLAC will be like. I hope it will work out well.  Anyways that's it for today I suppose ehehe.  Later.

       8/3/04 Untitled....   No title for today, I couldn't think of one, nor was my day even exciting enough to think of one =P. It was another one of those thinkin' days, and basically sitting in my house's A/C days once again. Plus I just bought Braveheart and Enemy At The Gates yesterday, so I thought I'd watch them. Yes I've seen both of the movies, but I felt like buying them and watching them again =).  For some reason I slept early last night, and woke up early as a result. My mind still thinks I have to wake up at 6am when I sleep at 12am *I normally had band in the school year* which is a good sign of the fact that I can easily adapt back into school life....which also sucks since my sleep was disturbed by a sudden awakening. So it took me awhile to get back to sleep, and eventually I'd wake up at 1030 only. No 1130 or 12 today. Read devos about how problems are there for a reason, and that there is always a positive way out of them. Hehe reminded me of the lesson Josh's dad taught us during Bible Study almost 3 months ago.  So afterwards, I decided to watch Braveheart. Mom was still sleeping, as she had to wake up early or something today, and I had to wait for lunch anyways, so continued the movie from yesterday night. Most of the cool battle scenes happened here, and lunch came just in time after I finished it.  After....er, during lunch I then thought to myself:   I'm supposed to call WLAC to set up a meeting time.   So, I then scrambled for the phone, and then quickly punched in the number. Apparently I was supposed to get back to him earlier *I think I emailed, but yeah....stupid emails thinking Gmail is junkmail* so then I had to call Josh, and frantically set up the committee with him. Eventually, we thought Steph would be one, and Jason or Gavin would be the other. The 3rd person would be me or Josh. So eventually we settled for Gavin, Steph, and me/Josh *we decide eventually* but for now one of us has to sit in for Steph anyways. All this work did come through, and eventually we set the time for Thursday at 4pm. Awesome. So there something done. Afterwards, I drummed around for a bit, then watched TV, ate, and then headed on compy for a bit.  For some reason I have to pick a meeting date for the 6crew to meet in Toronto, and I think 19th or 20th is going to be it.  Anyways I'm going to go for now.  Bye.

       8/1/04 Short Sunday....   Sunday seemed short today. Not much to say really...  Basically I went to North Park this morning instead of LCAC. That was my morning pretty much. I still find I like LCAC better though, but NP does have its perks I guess.....if you really like to go to a big church with a lot of people, then NP would probably be a good choice. At the moment though I'm stickin' with LCAC, as it still needs a lot more help running than NP.  So after chuch, came home, ate....and yeah just sat around home for the whole day.  Watched Blue Streak....great movie hehe.  Anyways yeah.......tomorrow don't know what's gonna happen......Civic holiday and stuff, so everywhere is closed basically, or open for shorter hours.  Hopefully I can figure out something to do tomorrow hehe.  Later.
