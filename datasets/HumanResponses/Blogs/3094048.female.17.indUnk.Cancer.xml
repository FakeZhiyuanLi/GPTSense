      So yesterday my friend Amy from work calls me up and asks if I would do her the biggest favor then she asked me if&nbsp;I would pee in a cup for her so I was like what the hell its not going to hurt me any so&nbsp;I did.   Okay other than that&nbsp;I really miss Richard I wish that I could spend like a hole day with him no interruptions that would be the best you know I don't even know if he is still living here.&nbsp;I have noticed that&nbsp;I have a really sad and pathetic life sometimes&nbsp;I really just want to end it all but what is the use&nbsp;I would just be more miserable were ever you go in the after life you know&nbsp;I wish that when&nbsp;I do die&nbsp;I want to become a spirit and haunt the people who&nbsp;need it the most that would be great. I wonder how&nbsp;I will die, last night&nbsp;I had a dream were I died from jumping of a bridge fun huh. I wonder if I will go in peace or be in pain up into the second I become no more well&nbsp;I must be getting ready for work &nbsp;

       OH my gosh it is so exciting my teeth look so pretty except my one bad tooth but I am getting that tooth fixed on the 31 of this month. yeah for me. but anyway not that much has happened recently Iam really excited about Aprils b-day party everyone will be there and hopefully heather will be there too.   I had the weirdest dream last night it had all of my friend in it and we were all at college and my evil x was also ther and we started talking in class and then I asked him for a ride home and so we left the class but he didn't take me home but to a icecream parlor he got out of his car then went around and opened my door then held out his arm for me to link onto so I  did and we went into the shop and we went to set down on a couch and he bought be ice cream it was really cool but i am kinda scared of what it means cause I don't want to have feelings for him but I think i still do I DON'T WANT TO but thats life and it sucks. Oh yeah I really want to look good for school so I am back on the diet for a while any way? but I must go because I have to take a crap later

      ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head This is not enough I'm in serious s--t, I feel totally lost If I'm asking for help it's only because Being with you has opened my eyes Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise? I keep asking myself, wondering how I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me Nobody else so we can be free All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head This is not enough This is not enough All the things she said All the things she said And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushedThey say it's my fault but I want her so much Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain Come in over my face, wash away all the shame When they stop and stare - don't worry me _Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for meI can try to pretend, I can try to forget But it's driving me mad, going out of my head Mother looking at me Tell me what do you see? Yes, I've lost my mind Daddy looking at me Will I ever be free? Have I crossed the line?   I like this song I know that it hasn't been on the radio in awhile but it is still good
