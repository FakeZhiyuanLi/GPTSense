      I typed the title of this post five minutes ago.&nbsp; Instead of struggling with a proper text I think I'll just regale you with the ramblings of my mind.&nbsp; The point of this blog is to be a release for my annoyances and an opportunity to share my happiness as a man living the single life.&nbsp; Sure, most of what I will say leans toward the annoyed side, but then again one of my favorite sayings is, "If it weren't for the shitty parts of life we wouldn't know how to appreciate the good parts."&nbsp; Maybe I should just get on with it.   I'm frustrated.&nbsp; I'll give you the highlights.&nbsp;   I've dated lots of women in my life, but have never found the perfect one.&nbsp; From the ages of sixteen to twenty I dated (ie. went out on more than one date with) about twelve women.&nbsp; Of them only one is even worth mentioning, and only then because she was the definition of psycho woman.&nbsp; By age twenty-one I started believing that the problem was really me, so I decided to buckle down and fully concentrate on this one special person who is genuinely kind and cute to boot.&nbsp; That lasted five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end I had a friend (who I still keep in close touch with) but felt regret for time wasted with this kind person who has a drive and determination to succeed comparable to a slug in winter and with whom I have no more in common with than a firm grasp on the English language, a fondness for breathing and pretty good sexual compatibility.&nbsp; (of course now is a good time to point out that I believe firmly that when&nbsp;a relationship is going well the sex discussions count for about 20%, but when thing start going bad it seems like the sex stock rises to account for about 80% of the arguments)&nbsp; The final breakup was on leap day, 2004.   So now I think I finally know what I want in a woman.&nbsp; Looks mean a lot less than they used to (not to say that they aren't still important since, to be honest, you usually see a person's face before you hear their first sentence).&nbsp; Now I'm convinced that I know what I want...&nbsp; only now that I'm able to spot the qualities that attract me I seem to have hit a road block of bad luck.&nbsp; I'll embellish.&nbsp; I'll even try to make it humorous.&nbsp; When convenient I will change the names of the women, unless they really pissed me off and deserve full recognition.&nbsp; Enjoy.
