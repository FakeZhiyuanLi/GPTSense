         Hello! A lot of changes the last days. I finally have a domain name! Update your links to:  urlLink www.svdv-photography.net   As you can see the whole design of the site changed. I use Blogger now for easy updating and managing. I'm still learning to use it, so the functions on the site are rather limited now. But I hope to change that soon.  Blogger also makes me able to post work of other photographers who wants to publish and/or sell their photos. All they have to do is becoming a member of SVDV-Photography and they can start publishing photos.  In addition everyone is welcome to join and post their ideas on photography in general. It would be nice to have a periodic tutorial, or someone who wants to post funny or special photo's. Maybe a topic on a specific camera. You name it we publish it! Well, there are restrictions off course. Posts must be legally and morally right. But that is just common sense, I think. You can read more by clicking on the link in the 'Become a Member' section.  Hope you like it.

      There is never a camera around when you need one. When you can find one, the batteries have been stored inside the camera for years and are now green rust. Or a button on the camera is sticking since your nephew Eli nailed it with Silly String at his birthday party. Even if the camera is OK, you have to stop by a store to find the right film. Capturing a slice of an event, a moment in time that will become a memory for you shouldn't be this hard.  urlLink More>>>

      The use of mobile phone cameras to take peeping tom photos that can be posted on the internet has prompted a call for tighter regulations and clearer guidelines for consumers.  The Australian Computer Society, which represents more than 16,000 IT professionals, will ask phone manufacturers to do more to alert consumers to changes in the law and to discourage rogue users from taking photos up women's skirts. Known as 'upskirting', the practice is becoming increasingly prevalent.  urlLink More>>>

      Maurice suggested putting various posts in categories. Although this was a great suggestion. It is more easily said then done. The big problem is the Blogger-system we use. It does not support categories! So I searched the net for a work-around. And the solution for us seams to be permalinks. Each post on SVDV-Photography.net has is own link. That you can find by clicking on the green time-index below the post. The only thing I had to do now was creating a post with all the categories and place links to the different posts on the site. New posts have to be added manually by editing the categories-post. It seems that only Blogger doesn't have this category feature. All the other software I found had it. So hopefully the people behind Blogger will implement this feature soon.

InfoTrends/CAP Ventures predicts two more years of strong growth before sales peak. Consumer digital camera unit sales in the United States are forecasted to reach 22.8 million in 2004. This represents a unit growth of 42% over 2003, which showed 58% unit growth over 2002.   Factors that contribute to ongoing high growth rates include the growing market of first-time buyers (digital camera penetration is expected to reach over 40% of U.S. households by year-end), and the rate of digital camera users replacing or purchasing an additional digital camera.   “Digital camera users have a lot of incentive to upgrade to the latest crop of digital cameras, since many models introduced this year address several user complaints such as slow imaging processing and poor battery life,” says Michelle Slaughter, Director of Digital Photography Trends at InfoTrends/CAP Ventures. “Additionally, manufacturers are gaining more traction in the U.S. market with premium features, including larger color LCDs (2 inches and larger), ultra-compact and stylish designs, extended zoom models (over 3X optical), and digital SLRs.”   The growing demand for premium point & shoot cameras and sub-$1,000 digital SLRs is raising the average selling price for these devices. The average selling price is forecasted to increase this year, which is great news for manufacturers since they have faced steep price erosion over the life of most models.   The top vendors in the digital camera market are Sony, Canon, Kodak, Olympus, Fuji, HP, and Nikon, ranked in terms of 2003 U.S. unit share. Each of these players captures more than 5% market share, and other players capture individual market shares of less than 5%. Sony and Canon are the market leaders with nearly equal unit shares. These players are expected to remain the leaders through 2004.   InfoTrends/CAP Ventures’ new forecast report entitled 2004 Consumer Digital Camera Forecast, North America provides five-year forecasts for the United States by units, revenue, and average selling price for the consumer (sub-$1,000) digital camera market. The forecast also breaks out price, product, and resolution segments. The price segments provided include less than $100, $100 - $200, $201 - $300, $301 - $500, and $500 - $1,000. The product segments include point & shoot cameras and digital SLRs. The resolution segments include sub-2.0 megapixels, 2.0M - 2.9M, 3.0M - 3.9M, 4.0M - 4.9M, 5.0M - 5.9M, 6.0 - 6.9M, and 7.0M+. The document also provides a five-year forecast for Canada and total North America unit sales.

      The kids, all three of them, sat for studio portraits recently. I suppose I should say that it was my intention to have all three children sit for studio portraits; one of them (and I’m sure you can guess which one) wasn’t feeling as cooperative as the others. The photographer tried five different poses — the first and third include the charming Matthew, and the rest do not. During the setup and shooting of the poses that do not include Matthew, he was carrying on and causing such a general ruckus that another photographer, passing by the room we were using, chortled “Listen to the shriek on that one!”   urlLink More>>>

      Photographs offer us a mirror from another time.

For David Octavius Hill, the features of the 474 ministers breaking away from the Church of Scotland were too many to draw, so he used a camera, placing Scotland at the beginning of photography's history.  urlLink More>>>

           Issues addressed with firmware version 2.0       Autofocus performance has been improved.  Auto white balance performance has been improved.  A new option, FPS rate + AF, has been added to CSM MENU a1 AF-C mode priority.  Focus area display in Group dynamic-AF mode has been changed.  The label for CSM MENU a3 has been changed from Group dynamic AF to Pattern selection in Group Dynamic AF. The options available for this setting have also been changed.  A new custom setting has been added to the CSM MENU; a4 Disable Lock-On.  Numbering of some custom settings displayed in the CSM MENU has been changed.  The labels for some CSM MENU a8 Vertical AF-ON (previously custom setting a7) options have been changed.   A File name setting has been added to the SHOOTING MENU.&nbsp; This setting allows the user to change the first three characters in image file names.  The camera now supports CompactFlash™ memory cards with a capacity greater than 4GB.  Support for Exif version 2.21  The ICC profile will not be embedded in JPEG images.  Support for Exif version 2.21 means that a portion of file names for images captured with II (AdobeRGB) selected from the SHOOTING MENU’s Color mode setting has been changed.e.g. Image file names recorded as “DSC_0001.jpg” with the old firmware are now recorded as “_DSC0001.jpg”.  Image sensitivity has been added to general Exif tag information.&nbsp; This makes it possible to verify image sensitivity with software such as PictureProject, Nikon View, Nikon Capture or other such applications from which shooting data can be displayed.  A problem which caused the frame rate with continuous shooting to decrease, even when sensitivity was not controlled automatically with ISO auto turned On from CSM MENU b1 ISO auto, has been corrected.With the new firmware, frame rate with continuous shooting decreases only when sensitivity is controlled automatically.&nbsp; However, even with a continuous shooting mode of Ch applied, images can be captured at a rate of approximately 7 frames per second.  The calculation method for image histogram display has been changed.  A portion of the electronic analog exposure display differs when exposure compensation is applied.  Some changes have been made to the method in which image display is enlarged with playback zoom.  The image playback zoom ratio has been increased. The image display can be enlarged up to 30 X (for large size images) or up to 23 X (for medium size images) with playback zoom.  A limit has been set for the number of times the shutter can be continuously released when no memory card is inserted in the camera.&nbsp; The limit is the same number as that selected for CSM MENU d2 C-Mode max. shots.    urlLink Click here for the D2H firmware download page (Windows)    urlLink Click here for the D2H firmware download page (Mac)

          A New Series Designed to Optimize Image Quality in Digital SLR Photography   PENTAX Corporation is pleased to announce the development of the new  smc PENTAX-D FA interchangeable lens series, designed to optimize image  quality in digital SLR photography. The series also features an image circle  covering accommodating the 35mm-format film. As the first models of this new series, PENTAX will market two compact, lightweight macro lenses for close-up photography up to a life-size magnification.   Major Features   1. High-Performance Optical Design to Optimize Digital Imaging Characteristics  Taking advantage of its advanced optical design technologies, PENTAX successfully optimized the optical characteristics of these new lenses for digital photography, including lens coating and curvature and positioning of optical elements. In particular, flare and ghost images - the most disturbing factors in digital SLR photography - have been reduced to minimum for clear, high-quality digital images.   2. Image Circle Compatible with 35mm-Format SLR Cameras   The new lenses features an image circle accommodating the image size (36mm by 24mm) of 35mm-format SLR film cameras. As a result, they produces high-quality images with edge-to-edge sharpness and free of vignetting, even when mounted on conventional 35mm-format SLR cameras.   3. Aperture Ring for Fingertip Aperture Control  The new series comes equipped with an aperture ring to accommodate the lens-set Aperture-Priority AE and Metered Manual modes, assuring fingertip aperture control from the shooting position.   4. Compact, Lightweight Design   Both the smc PENTAX-D FA Macro 100mm F2.8 and the smc PENTAX-D FA Macro 50mm F2.8 are designed to be extremely compact and lightweight, compared to conventional macro lenses. The drastic downsizing and weight reduction were achieved through the development of compact, high-performance optical elements and the incorporation of durable yet lightweight exterior components. The filter size is standardized at 49mm.  5. Life-Size Macro Photography   The new lenses offer a maximum magnification of 1X (life size), producing impressive, well-defined macro images.   6. Exceptional Image Definition over the Entire Focusing Range   The smc PENTAX-D FA Macro 100mm F2.8 incorporates the FREE (Fixed Rear Element Extension) focusing system, while the smc PENTAX-DA FA Macro 50mm F2.8 features the dependable floating system. These systems ensure exceptional focusing distance to infinity - by effectively reducing annoying aberrations at any focusing distance.   7. Smooth, Effortless Operations   A wide focusing ring assures speedy, high-accuracy focusing operations in the manual-focus mode. In the autofocus mode, it is uncoupled with the autofocus mechanism and locked in place without rotation.   8. Quick-Shift Focus System   When mounted on the PENTAX ?istD, these lenses feature the innovative Quick-Shift Focus System, which allows the photographer to first capture the subject focus in AF mode, then move to manual focus without the need to perform mode switching operations.   9. Other Features   (1) Built-in focus-clamp mechanism to fix focus at any distance (2) Large lens hood to effectively shield the lens surface from excessive incident light (3) Metallic lens mount for extra durability

      Henri Cartier-Bresson, the Frenchman whose early dabblings with a Brownie box camera blossomed into celebrated lifetime of traveling the world to capture the human drama on film, has died at age 95.

Depending on the intended use, image quality can be set – before each shot – to Fine, Normal or Economy. The choice of single frames or continuous shooting opens up even further creative possibilities.

         The extremely slim new Prego dp4200 digital camera by Rollei is the ideal "camera for all occasions" – with technical features to boot!      Actually, it's hard to believe how much "contents" you can squeeze into such a tiny package! Rollei are now introducing a powerful, but ultra-compact 4.2-megapixel digital camera in an especially flat metal body, complete with 3x optical and 3.6x digital zooms plus video and voice-recording options. The Prego dp4200 will be available for € 299 (incl. VAT) from end of August 2004.  A mere 125 grams is what the Prego dp4200 weighs. And its dream measurements are 88.5 x 54.5 x 24 mm. In other words, it will hitch a hike in just about any pocket. And it will show off its versatility in just about any situation. As a mini video camera or dictation machine, for example. The Prego dp4200 will record video clips with 320 x 240 pixels and 15 frames per second in MPEG1 format (AVI). For brief voice commentaries, there are 30 seconds. A built-in microphone and loudspeaker make it all possible.  Conventional camera functions are enhanced by high-grade technical features. The 4.2-megapixel CCD of the Prego dp4200 makes the best of even larger print sizes than A4. Its 3x zoom lens f/2.8-4.8 covers a range of focal lengths which in 35mm photography are equivalent to about 32.4-97.2 mm. Plus there is a 3.6x digital zoom. A large, 2-inch TFT LCD color monitor and an optical real-image zoom viewfinder make framing very simple and fast. Autofocusing takes care of perfect focus between 0.5 meter and infinity. Even close-ups are easy with the Prego dp4200. Macrofocusing is possible within 6 and 50 cm.  Most of the camera modes are available on Auto and Manual. For the built-in flash, for example, there are – in addition to the auto modes – "Fored", "Off" and "Red-eye reduction''". For difficult lighting situations, there are manual white-balance presets for "Daylight", " Cloudy", "Tungsten" or "Fluorescent 1 or 2". „Forced“, „Off“ und „Red-eye-reduction“. And exposure can be compensated manually in one-third increments over +/- 2.0 EV. A self-timer with either 2s or 10s delay makes for entertaining group photos.  Depending on the intended use and available storage space, you can select image quality from "Fine", "Standard" and "Economy". Using the Eonomy setting, for example, the possible 515 MB of an SD card can be put to optimum use. And if you wish to obtain even more space, you can transfer your data via the USB or video interfaces (NTSC, PAL) to your computer or TV set.
