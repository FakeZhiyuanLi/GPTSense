      Okie, my boring weekdays starts after the ultimate busy Sat night at Velvet Underground... Damn packed with "old folks". Almost got stressed out being the drinks controller 4 the 1st time in at least 3 months... But hey hey, nothing can put Derek the Great down, as he breezes thru the night with no SWEAT! Woo Hoo! No kidding... But shacked out lahz.  Following day me got to know  urlLink Jacelyn  looks abit like  urlLink Lee Xin Jie  though. Fortunately the night didn't end a hostile one, thanks to my ah bung. Guys, haven't you all understand what they meant when they say that girls are naturally sensitive by gender? *tsk tsk*  mE juz accepted helping my eldest bro to run his spectacles distribution business today. It was quite a let down with Zero sales the last time round, but now I'm as damn confident as Dark Vader in the "Empire Strikes Back"... No link? Okie... Whatever.  =.=凸

      Juz got back from the gruesome and tough training of the annual reservist training. Had a wonderful and great learning experience that exposed me again to the different faces of people. Used the strategy to control my men by ruling them by their hearts rather than by the book. Eureka! It works!   Gotta know my results for the past semester out in the fields. Persuaded my buddy after a round of beating around the bush... Gotten my highest and at the same time the lowest grade in one examinations results slip... Oh... what the f**k! =.=凸

      It's been late nights with Euro2004 football matches continuously for mE... haven't been blogging 4 quite sometime, now that I come to realised it. I'm still down with cough, but mE am getting better now. Hehe, and no doubt that this contagious disease have certainly play a part in infecting the vulnerable ones still. Didn't know my cough have got its charms also... hehe. bE blessed that you've part of derek in you kae... haha. :p  Had this craze for sushi for a long time now, it's not until today that me finally lay my hands on one of them. Hmmm... that wasabi still choke the hell out of mE... But shiok, hehe. rEminds mE of the MTV "Whatever things" show where they applied wasabi on the eye of a japanese guy. Ooh... that muz have hurt sooo much. They're japanese, remember?

      It was 7:15pm Moses called me on the phone, and at 7:30pm I'm out driving towards Bishan liaoz. Met up wif my former secondary school mates for coffee at Olio Dome. They still looked the same as usual, but mE was commented to look younger as compared to the group and have become slimmer already. Man... i'm supposed to look more mature at this age lorz. Frankly speaking, think i really gotta do something to my dress sense. Hmmm, but on second thought, dun think i could be bothered also lahz. No one will really care so much anyway. Bishan gives me memories... Setting aside that, my Ah bung Allan is leaving for UK soon. Sigh, mE really gonna miss his company... Sad. Okie, time to watch soccer liaoz. Today's pick, of course Portugal lahz, though Luis Figo seemed as though his age is catching up liaoz.

      mE been coughing quite violently lately. "Pi pa gao" also no use on me lehz. Think I'm gonna visit doc soon b4 my workdays. Haha, in the meantime, bet some of you couldn't catch the 'live' telecast of the games like me horz? mE been feeling the itch to bet soccer these days, and even more so when my hunch proves to be right when France emerged the winner last night and Denmark & Italy drew an hour ago. My pick: Sweden will triumph over Bulgaria. If I'm wrong, too bad lorz. The ball is round, remember? Haiz, cannot think of betting anymore, mE muz have self-control... Hummm...

      Oh yes, I'm down with flu. I guessed so, though not yet examined & certified. mE HATE being sick... Who likes to be sick anyway? Except "MC Kings & Queens" lorz. Poor trees, dunno how many of them have to be sacrificed each time my nose runs. (Bet u're more heartless with them if you're someone who is "full of shit" :p) No choice, me still gotta work this weekend. Think it muz be I slacked at home for too long a time & became this vulnerable against the bugs. Muz go work on my bones during work to keep them in shape... Illogical? haha, that's mE. Since when u know so much about logic gates and stuff... =.=凸

      What's meant by aspirations? These questions regarding my future are constantly prompted and that worries me... Are these years of education really gonna pave a smooth passage to my successful career that I'm deemed to be working under the hands of someone for the rest of my life? This is definitely not something I want or something I foresee to be installed for my own future. A few of my friends have started carving their own paths by now, let alone my eldest brother. Felt lagged behind by so much in comparison. I'm eager, very much now to know what the future really lies ahead of me. I'm hungry now & wish for the day I could carve a bright future for myself with my own hands... someday...

      Oh yesh, I bought the nicorette chewing gum. Was rather helpful that it did helped cut down my cigarette consumption by quite alot these few days. The worst thing of the gum isn't the taste, but I kept biting my lips while chewing... Man, it REALLY hurts. Bled each time I "miscued". And now, there seem to be quite a number of new & old wounds from those bites. Oh well, what can I say when this is one small sacrifice to make towards a better health. For now, let's keep our fingers crossed whether I could succeed in kicking that habit...

      mE juz worked my ass off on Tuesday nite & had my much more relaxed working day yesterday for the "Heineken Green Room" thingy. Was couped up inside this tiny area dedicated to the works of a drinks controller yet again...  Gotten my hair trimmed and coloured. Looked more bengish than ever.男人不坏,女人不爱,right? Kindda resembles the hair colour of Monkey God showing now on Channel U though, hmmm...  Ok, I've given up on the music counter already. No more music for YoU & for mE... *sob* Got into a whole lot of trouble trying to edit that damn template. Had enough liao. *huff huff*

      I was quite astonished to know that the webpage took such a long time to be loaded. Think the connection with the host was disrupted. Gotta wait till I find some other hosts 4 the music link before it'll be in operation again I guess. Something new? Juz got my counter set up in the meantime.  For those who die die muz be accompanied by music while surfing my blog... hmmm... you can sing it urself without any background music whilst in front of ur desktop lorz.  It's yet another holiday eve today. Muz be a blessing to all those working pple out there who yearns to catch their breath off the whole week of work. Damn, it's gonna be another busy night for me though. 他妈的...

      Just had some flashbacks of my past, and they really had me thinking of how much I've changed. These thoughts worries me, it seems that I'm already lost in a world of my own, I've lost myself. It's a strange thing at how much a person can change over time, and I'm undergoing that change this instant... Sometimes when you try hard at things, things might not turn out to be what you've expected, be it relationships, studies, etc. Go with the flow, let nature take its course... Hmmm, maybe that explains why I'm so laid back these years. Deep inside, think I should be feeling glad. When there's no hopes, there's no disappointments. The older one gets, sometimes some things aren't worth that effort to fight for. Well,  age  catches you up, at least that's what everyone else might agree yah?

       Supposedly it's juz another night at my workplace. But oh boy oh boy, am I&nbsp;surprised to see  Steph Sung  sitting juz right in front of the table I'm tending to. Not much of&nbsp;a big hoo haa, she's pretty much an ordinary person, at least in my opinion. As compared to the small black box I used to see her from, she's indeed&nbsp;much bigger in size in person. Oops, hope I'm not hurting your feelings if she happens to be ur idol. If I did, go ahead and live in ur world of  self denial . haha.&nbsp;This is a  cruel  world...&nbsp; =.=凸    I was attending to this table where two jap ladies were seated. Had quite a hard time trying to figure out what they actually wanted to order with their accent.  'Oolong Cha' finally came out... &nbsp;but gotta drop that. In the end,&nbsp;mE still&nbsp;got her  water  instead.&nbsp;I was quite&nbsp;taken aback when I didn't&nbsp;expect she could&nbsp;turned out to be&nbsp;so short when she headed to the ladies. Ok ok, I know you're gonna say I'm not that tall either. But still...  I'm taller lor . haha.   Busy busy night. Sigh, it seems that I've lost the  passion  I once had working at such places... Now&nbsp;I'm still pondering the idea of giving that job up sometime soon...

      If you were to sink down into the ocean, you'll catch a  headache . What if you were to sink deeper?  Mygraine ... Corny huh?&nbsp;Dunno&nbsp;why this statement still manage to pop out from my brains when the&nbsp;head is still spinning...&nbsp;Enough of crapping. My mind cannot think straight now cos they seemed to be falling apart... like Humpty Dumpty? Time to pop the white capsules now...  &nbsp; Counting down the days to the Bintan trip this coming end of the month. Hmmm, a great 'grand' finale before the school reopens for the next semester... Then I'll be back to the boring schooling days once again, Argh...

      @#$%&! Damn! mE Got asked to pull over on my way back from supper by a police stop tonight yet again! Thought the blue neon pedal lights of the Honda Accord was the culprit, but mE now changed car liaoz leh, still the same old results again again and again... Do I really look like some sorta underaged juvenile delinquent who stole my dad's car keys and drove the vehicle out? No doubt, each and everytime whenever there's a police stop, I'm bound to be asked to pull over to the side, confirmed, guaranteed + chopped! mY ah bung once wouldn't believe that I'm that popular with the 'uniform' people that he once tried to act ignorant by sticking his finger into his nostril while mE drove pass them  (ah bung's identity is undisclosed to protect the privilege of the innocent, haha ). Guess what?! mR Popular got stopped again... Argh... They juz 'LOVE' seeing mE driving to the side of the road to death! kaoz! =.=凸

      mE had been asked the same question of 'why I'm still not attached yet' days ago... I do ponder over this question too. Hmmm, issit (A) maybe there ain't anyone in my mind I feel I have a connection with at this instant; (B) Maybe it's cos the time isn't right; (C) Maybe it's cos I'm too used to the life I'm living with now; (D) Maybe I'm still on the one sided track? (Final answer) In fact, I dunno. I'm juz crappin. When it comes, it comes. When it doesn't, no point harbouring hopes for one also.   mE juz went for supper at Bedok North Blk 85 (With? You can most prob get it right one lahz). Yummy, the minced meat noodles is still the same, still that delicious, still that small portion. If they were to offer the 'Supersize it' service like that of McDonald's, think their biz will definitely be alot better, haha. Ah ballings, mE had them ever since my schooling days at Beach Road when my elder bro was still serving for the nation. Man... that's ages ago! Good old days... Hey! Dun think I dunno that you're imagining the food sitting right in front of you horz. Haha, too bad that you've no luck with them now. :P

      jUz came back from prata again. Bet mE can be a "prata gourmet" soon. mE was at Jalan Kayu the day before yesterday with company. Guess what surprised us? The perspiration from the server actually dripped into the plate right before my eyes! Two drops... Yewk! heng ah, that plate was served to another unsuspicious patron. Luckily he came to the wrong table. When our orders came, all of us chipped in to help out the indian server to lay down our food on the table both efficiently & hysterically. Having gone through our careful QC - no sweat spotted & no extra foreign ingredients - passed.  Czech Rep is OuT! Man, mE felt as though the world has crashed on mE. No doubt the fans felt worse than how I'm feelin now, definitely. Only 1 word can describe my current state... SHOCKED! bEt I'll have problems getting to sleep later... But then again, I've problems sleeping early ever since the Euro2004 kick started. sO much so for late night soccer matches, mE earned my 2 lumps of pimples, i mean "lumps". Hey, at least this proves that I'm still young right? Go get some pimples first the next time you think of singing "Forever Young". :p  Music link back & up specially for ur listening pleasure. You can stop singing to urself while surfing my blog liaoz. Roger that? *dot dot dot*

      Okie, today marks the very 1st day of school for me. As boring as ever... though in fact I did skipped my first lecture early in the morning. Well, it just occur to me that sleep is more important then lorz... Not my fault.  mY coursemate Jeremy dropped me off his bike somewhere near his gf's place. And I've to take a bus back home alone. The bus drove near the stop I'm supposed to drop off, the TV Mobile thingy then was showing the ad for the new movie  "Alien vs Predator"  ,  cool... Okie, as always, I'll feel for my hp to check whether I've left it behind. But this time, heck it, it has already been such a boring day at school, nothing more unlucky will befall on me lorz. When the bus started to drive off, shit!  Just like a sprinter who pluck his feet from the ground upon the whistle, I plucked mine when the bus hit on its accelerator pedal! Shoo...! Issit a bird? Issit a plane? Definitely not the one who wears his red underwear outside lorz. I ran & ran... mY lungs almost exploded. "Alien vs Predator" huh? Whoever wins, we lose huh? In this scenario, its more like  "Man vs Bus"  ,  man wins, I win! Luckily the bus made a stop at the traffic junction. mE ran passed the traffic lights without checking for oncoming cars... "Contact list" kept ringing in my head then. Hmmm, probably that's what kept me running with my full strength lorz. Phew, close shave with death again. I must have been born as a cat in my past lives considering all those near accidents I've encountered. In the end? Just like every fairy tales you were to read from LadyBird books,  they always come with a happy ending ... ;)
