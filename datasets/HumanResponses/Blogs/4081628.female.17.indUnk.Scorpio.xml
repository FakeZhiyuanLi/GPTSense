       So tonight i worked, which is always fun.. ha. but yeah, this guy brian that works there was talking to me, and i said something snotty to him ( isnt that hard to believe :) )... and he chucked one of those silica gel packets that are in shoe boxes at me. and right on the label is says "do not eat." well it turns out i totally swallowed 3 of them. and to tell u the truth, i have been feeling dizzy for the past 3 hours. haha jk. ohh and i'm totally a lifesaver. today, i decided to cook myself a nice little lunch since i never eat lunch. well, turns out im never doing that again. i had the oven door open, and i looked out the corner of my eye and i see my dog about to jump up on the oven door. so i screamed and pushed him away, resulting in me burning my arm. but whatever, i consider myself to be a hero. josh just thinks that my dog was trying to commit suicide, but josh is gay. I saw the village tonight. and by the way.. i totally broke the armrest haha... but yeah, let me tell u, do not waste your money on that. it sucks so bad.... that, yeah. I also saw nick tonight at target, yeah.. he was high as fuck. dude... bad kid. annnyways.. i gotta get up at 6:30 tomorrow to go to work. boo... how dumb is that. i work from 8-11 then 4:30-10. megan miller came home today, and im real excited cuz shes been gone forever!! okay im gunna end this thing.. cuz i should be heading to bed :(

        Okay so for some odd reason i'm doing this. I used to read monica's all the time, and since monica is such a swell kid, i suppose ill copy her and try to be like her. yay :) so lets see... today was exciting. i went to the doctor and had tests done, which was not very neato.  then i came home and slept for a long ass time (9-3). yay. then went out to outback for my mom's birthday. and thats pretty much it. dude, i do not want summer to end, let me tell you! i fricken camped out in a tent 2 nights ago. that night will never be forgotten. so monica, maureen, and i decided to start a club called "GSW". first of all, high five for that!  so jason came over to monica's house to let us borrow his tent. but it ends up that monica has a big foot, and it only fit her foot. hmm.. we needed a new tent! since target is the god of everything, we decided to bust our shit to target to buy a tent. turns out, since target only carries luxury items, they only had real expensive tents.  do not worry, we ran into walmarts w/ 5 min til it closed and got a tent for $40! f yes!!  we ran to subway then to dairy queen and finally back to the florek residence to set up our new gsw headquarters (we can flinstone it anywhere)! oh for sure.. so we're chilling in the tent listening to delila.  so we're feeling mighty fine then i think to myself "why is my leg wet?" well.. it turns out this girl (who will remained unnamed..hehe) peed her pants on my leg! haha... so we all jumped our asses into the pool to get that shit off. haha.. then we get some guys to come over cuz it was crazy with just us girls! i did not enjoy my boob getting punched in... haha. haha... yippee... so we chilled, and called Kiss FM and requested MMmbop.. cuz that song is the shit.  then, the boys left cuz mother would wake up soon! so like a split second after they left, the girl who peed on my leg, now had puked in the tent cuz she had some bad food. soo u can imagine how that smelled... let me tell u, it did not smell like a meadow!! but yeah.. so being the nice friends we were, we cleaned it up! so we were chillin.. then all of a sudden i hear another water sound.. turns out piss came outta her again. dude, we tried to clean it up, but it smelled so like butthole that we just ran inside and slept on the couch. haha. and ps: if i called u that night, i apologize.. haha!! but the next moring sucked a little boy's pepe. we hosed off all 20 blankets and sleeping bags and dunked them in the pool. haha.. but yeah.. anyways now im bored. i thought this thing would get me un-bored. oh well. monica is telling me about how she planned out her whole life. thats crazy. she even had pictures of her wedding dress and the guy shes gunna meet. aww.. monica florek i heart you. btw... we're totally going to the alan jackson concert. i've been listening to the song "wonderwall" by oasis since like 11:00. and now its 12:30. I definately have to work tomorrow. which is depressing. but i am going to see "the village" after work w/ my good bud josh... who is sadly moving to iowa :(  But yeah, monica has just informed me that i can be one of her bride's maids. h yes. remember the old dairy queen commercial... "dude, dude, check one dude?"... wow my sister and i were talking about it. i miss that shit. omg, i just stepped on a nail with my pinky toe. that hurt like a bitch. but good thing i was on the phone w/ my babe cj. he works in a big bad pharmacy so he told me what to do! i think thats cute :) now my pinky toe is styling in a shrek bandaid. yay! ha.. random, random.. but yeah, i keep getting interrupted so i'm just gunna end this for the night! goodnight.. love you all!     PS: id also like to say hi to alex who bugs the shit outta me all the time :)
