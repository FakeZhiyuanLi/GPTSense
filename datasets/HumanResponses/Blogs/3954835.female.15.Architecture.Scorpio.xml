Lies -koRn I would like to search inside for all of the things that you will hide What's the problem?

Suzanne Delaney  SOMEBODY, SOMEONE -koRn I can't stand to let you in. I'm just watching you. And I don't know what to do. Feeling like a fool inside. Feeling all the hurt you hide. Thought you were my friend. Seems it never ends. I need somebody someone. Can't somebody help me. All I need is to be. Loved just for me. Giving you this and that. Giving gave nothing back. It's all related to. All the things I do. Feeling like a fool inside. Seeing all the things you tried. I am nothing. I look I sign. I need someone. Inside to help me out. With what I'm trying. I'm crying, I'm frying. In a pile of shit. I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying I need somebody (someone). Somebody (somebody). Someone. I need somebody (someone). Somebody (somebody). Someone. Someone.     Kill You -koRn Living life, don't you cry My life, pain is God Many nights, painful thoughts occur Yell at me, again I'm wrong In denial, I tried to be your friend I tried to be a good boy All I see, a hate deep inside Startle me, someone save me Now these memories fill my heart, they bury me All I wanna do (You are not my real mother)Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her) x4 Looking back I was never ever right You were my step-mom who always wanted me out of your sight I would come walking' in and I'd say hello, but you slap me and you make some fucked up comment about my clothes, Then I tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head, were with you with a knife up your ass, laying deadSo I popped some more caps in you assI'm not you're son and social funMotherfucking bitch, never tried to play me You made my life not so good All I wanna do...is kill you x2 All I wanna do Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her) x4 Wish (ha-ha) you were dead (ahh) now (uh-ha-ha) How can I cry over someone I never loved?

A place inside my brain, another kind of pain You don't know the chances. I'm so blind! Another place I find to escape the pain inside You don't know the chances. What if I should die?! A place inside my brain, another kind of pain You don't know the chances. I'm so blind! Deeper and deeper is all I'm turning to. Living a life that seems to be a lost reality that can never find a way to reach my inner self-esteem is low How deep can I go in the ground that I lay? If I don't find a way to see through the grey that clouds my mind.This time why don't you see what's between the lines. I can see, I can see, I'm going blind... I'm blind!   12:05 nah... may pasok pa bukas...gudmorning...!!!Ü

      JUNE 19,2004 Song:A Little Bit Saturday...walang pasok mga tao dito, kase laguna day,katamad,badtrip... kaya kakanta na lang ako..nyah! Hey Mom Why didn't you tell me Why didn't you teach me a thing or two You just let me go Out into the world You never thought to share what you knew So I walked under a bus I got hit by a train Keep falling in love Which is kinda the same I've sunk out at sea Crashed my car gone insane And it felt so good I wanna do it again Hey mom Why didn't you warn me Cos about boys was something I should have known They're like chocolate cake Like cigarettes I know they're bad for me But I just can't leave 'em alone Chorus I wanna do it again I wanna do it again Oh felt so good Yeah yeah yeah Hey mom Since we're talking What was it like when you were young Has the world changed Or is it still the same A man can kill and still be the sweetest fun  Inspire::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I'LL BE OVER YOU-TOTO Some people live their dreams Some people close their eyes Some people's destiny Passes by There are no guarantees There are no alibis That's how our love must be Don't ask why Bridge: It takes some time God knows how long I know that I can forget you As soon as my heart stops breakin' Anticipating As soon as forever is through I'll be over you Remembering times gone by Promises we once made What are the reasons why Nothing stays the same Bridge: There were the nights holding you close Someday I'll try to forget them Someday I'll be over you

        I love you not only for what you are,but for what I am when I am with you   For, you see, each day I love you more, Today more than yesterday and less than tomorrow. She's walking down the aisle With a smile as pure as honey A gust of wind as smooth as silk A glimmer of hopeA ray of light. She's walking down the aisle With lovely clothes of crimson red A look of a saintly figure A voice of an angel A silent whisper. She's walking down the aisle With eyes as deep as the sea A song of the morning bird A divine vision A picture of paradise. She's walking down the aisle Like clouds floating in the sky Like an angel ascending from heaven Like a drop of rain in the desert Like a promise never broken. She walks down the aisle.She asks me a question.I have no words to answer.And time stands still... I lie on the ground,and stare into space,the stars start to move,into the shape of your face. I see you there now,looking down at me,with that cute little smile,that I like to see. You say "close your eyes""tell me what you see"I see only two people,just you and me. We're walking the shoreline,with our feet getting wet,the horizon turns pink,as the sun starts to set. We make love through the night,on that white sandy shore,then I hold you while thinking,I could want nothing more. Oh I wish I could bein that one special place,as I lie on the ground,and I stare into space...  STOP THE MEANING OF THIS!!! Blind Jonathan: it is result of my hobby for drugs in a youth " Another place I find to escape the pain inside " Drugs supervised my life, I tried to escape from it, but did not see the future, did not see a direction in which me to go. " see through the grey that clouds my mind " I wanted to escape from it, but my will power was too low to change. I wanted to begin a life all over again, but did not know, how. Ball Tongue Jonathan: " Many think, that a song about oral sex (in fact Ball Tongue it is literally translated as " by language on eggs "), but actually this song about the guy who made to us firm "t-shirt". At him piercing in language or a wart or was such as that, we counted him mmmmm, such he looked in our eyes. " " There you are alone, with no hope of ever having something to be proud of, something earned without begging " It about the person who was well familiar with Jonathan, but approved, that he has made for group much more. This person has stopped to communicate with group, hoping, that guys will ask it{him} to return. But he was abruptly broke off. " Why are you at home buried in your own self pity? Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me? " This person spent a lot of time with Jonathan, but began to force to pay attention that only to him. " Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me. Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me? " Need To Song about prodriving time with someone whom you strongly love, but you are afraid to tell about it, to begin closer to the favourite person. " You pull me closer, I push you away, You tell me it's okay, I cannot help but feel the pain " It was in youth Jonathan when he thought that is too close with the beloved. " I hate you.... Fuck you, bitch " Jonathan was confident, that if not will make it the girl will break his heart. He hated her even how she something did. Clown Jonathan: " we played San Diego, to us has approached skinhead and has told " Be cleaned back to Bakersfield ". He even has struck me. But then we fucked to him ass. " " A tatooed body to hide who you are, Scared to be honest, be yourself " It also was an occasion for a spelling songs. Video Clown shows Jonathan a victim of the coevals and schools because he differed from others. He was another and his coevals could not accept it. Divine This song about revenge. Jonathan wanted the girl who did not want it. Then all has changed also the girl all the same him has wanted. " You're suffering ' cause of me, it's divine " " Did you really think you'd beat me at my own game " He wanted to show her what to feel such breaked when you want someone, and she - is not present. John has understood, that as soon as has lost interest to her, she has surrendered. Now there was his turn to break off and he with pleasure to her has taken advantage. " You know what, Fuck you, I'm fed up with you, I'm not as good as you, Fuck no, I'm better than you " Jonathan knew, that he is much better than her, at least, he not a puppet which it is possible to twirl as will take in head. Faget Jonathan: People think, that in that to a song I omit gays, but it not so. This song about me, at school of me named pussy, queer and so forth. Having lead some time with Jonathan, the person can hear many jokes to address of gays. But Jonathan never the gay was. him so named at school basically because of his imitation idols - group Duran Duran. " Everyone think, that all life I was the gay so I now laugh at it, in fact I the gay never was ". Shoots and Ladders This song from my childhood. Children singing at first sight children's songs, at all thinking about sense. All are very happy, when sing " London Bridge ". Children even tell terrible histories about this song. Words Shoots*Ladders are taken just from children's couplets. In general, this cool song, is especial if to know scary the histories, standing up for her. Predictable The name songs is translated as "Predicted". Any pastime with the girl was for its very predicted - at the end of all he will feel like awfully (see Need To). It is especially surprising, in fact Jonathan always spoke, that would prefer to die, than to feel a pain. " I can in every way, mistake the pain I feel inside. It comes to me, evil thoughts is creeping through my mind " Fake One more song touching, as well as Clown, a theme of falseness. The person does not want to be by itself, he represents the one his coevals want to see whom " I cannot stand the sight of you, I cannot stand what you put me through. Your life's a lie, that you hide. Is it that terrible being you inside? " Jonathan prefers to be oneself, instead of the person who does not have own opinion. " You try so hard to be wanted. False emotions tells you fronted. I think being a person relies on one thing. Be yourself, let you come through " Under influence of "crowd" the person varies, his opinion leaves on the second plan, and for the first the opinion of the majority leaves. " Fake, you'll regret it, you'll regret it " And only in an old age such people will understand, that they have ruined the youth, trying to be those whom are not. Lies The sense songs is similar on Clown and Fake, all about the same falseness. This song about those who too strongly is afraid to be oneself. About those who is hidden behind a wide back of a society. " I want you to see the life you have disguised " " Do you ever see from outside your fears " Daddy " People, having heard Daddy, think, that father has overslept with me and then I have written this song. But it not so. This song not about my parents. When I was the child, I was offended with one type, I have come to parents and all him have told, but they have not believed me, did not think, that such can take place with their son. In general, I do not like to speak about this song, it is more than that I spoke before. " When guys wrote down this song, Jonathan have overflown emotions and consequently they have not stopped record. Then it is possible to hear a sound of a clapping door is Jonathan leaves studio. Guys executed Daddy alive only once, and that - John was overflowed with emotions and they had to stop execution songs. Jonathan spoke about the father: when to me was 13, everything about what we spoke were women. Now he has changed. Somehow he me has asked time: " I was the good father? ". What could I answer him? " You were the mongrel "? Upwards  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Life is Peachy  Twist Heavy guitar music, basses, shock and scat. It is more in this song there is nothing. In this song there are no words. Is only scat - the illegible text. And it makes a song such class. Chi Jonathan: " Chi is a song about dependence on alcohol and drugs. People drink, use drugs when have too big problems that is simple so to forget about them. People do not want to feel the pain, want to dull even her and do it with the help of drugs. " The song is named in honour Chi Cheng'a - bass player Deftones. Lost Jonathan: " the Song about when your best friend gets the girlfriend and you remain with anything ". Swallow Jonathan: " This song about a paranoia caused by the use of drugs ". Porno Creep Tool song with a small amount of words. Similar, that she expresses opinion of group, in fact in booklets of the first and third albums there was an image of pornographic magazines. Good God Jonathan: " It about the guy whom I knew when went to school. I counted his my friend, but he only used me. He good for me has not made anything, he all time "hung" in my house, lived at my expense and compelled me to do what actually I to make did not want. I loved romantic music, and he was simply ultramodern. Somehow time he has told to me, that if I shall not be modern to put on, he any more will not be my friend. Somehow I was going to go for appointment to the girlfriend, but he has broken him as never anybody did not meet. He was simply stupid mongrel. I did not see him many years. " Mr Rogers Song Mr. Rogers all over again called name Be My Neighbor (be mine the neighbour). Mr. Rogers is a television show which Jonathan looked in the childhood: " when I was the child and looked Mr. Rogers, I very much was afraid. He was the ugly old man. Country Makebelieve and Mr. FuckinMcFeely made me by the patient. I hated him, after one release of show my brain could not come in a normal condition of 5-6 days. I have spent 3 months for this song only that I should make it. It is good, that I was helped by drugs. " K * O %! It about women whom I met during all life. About women not in a general sense, but only about those who once caused me angrily. And in general, all over again we have written this song to send her on radio as a joke, and in a week to send the present new single. No Place to Hide The song about that Jonathan feels like used the musical industry and to him is no place to hide from it. This theme is continued and in Freak On A Leash. Wicked It is the cover - version songs Ice Cube'a from album Predator, also at her there is an invited vocalist - Chino Moreno from Deftones. A.D.I.D.A.S Jonathan: " Value songs - in decoding the name " Low Rider Head it is ripe this song on the birthday. He sings her very much a deep voice, Tone Loc - the rapper of 80th years. Ass Itch Jonathan: " we have written down this album for a month and this song was last. Each time when I write words, I foll in depression because I start to think of the problems. " Kill You Song Kill You - about stepmother Dzhonatana who constantly scoffed at him. He frequently dreamed, as will finish off her. Upwards  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Follow the Leader It's On Jonathan: " People frequently put upon me pressure. Sometimes on parties I have bad mood, and everyone approaches to me and speaks " Give the guy, It's On! " That usually it happens on parties? Alcohol, cocaine, women. And all this mixs up in one heap. I also have written about it a song. On parties of a problem simply pass in other channel, but from it do not vary (" nothing changes, just rearranges "). Freak On A Leash Jonathan: " This one of the best names for songs. This song about the musical industry. I feel, that the industry of me uses. Corporate America simply makes money, thus taking away something of my soul. " Got the Life Jonathan: " I many times addressed to the god, but more it I do not want. I want from a life little bit more, than all this. I have everything, that it is really necessary for me, but sometimes it is not pleasant to me. I at all do not know, how it to explain. " Dead Bodies Everywhere Song Dead Bodies Everywhere is connected by that his father did not want that Jonathan was the musician. Therefore he has sent John to work in a mortuary. Well and further you know - John's all life is tormented with nightmares. " Thanks for it, the daddy and mum. " Children of the Korn Jonathan: " Ice Cube has written a song that teenagers feel. " As you can speak me what to do? " In the childhood all called me the pederast. It is amusing, as things have changed. Who's Laughing Now? (the name of album L.A.P.D.) who is dared now? In general, all children KoRn are our fans, all children have passed through something similar and feel, that I felt. " B.B.K Jonathan: " Big black cock (big black kock.)! It is no more, than a joke. In Europe everyone pour in such small glasses...One more reason of a spelling of this songs - I tried to master pressure which is rendered on me by all. I tried to kill myself. Whether really I want it? I all time ask it myself. Also I do not find the answer. Pretty Jonathan: " This song about the little girl who has acted in a mortuary where I worked. Her fucked her father. To her was only 11 months!!! Father fucked as a small doll also has thrown her in bathing. It is the biggest horror which I saw in the life. Nightmares about it till now dream me. " All in the Family Jonathan: " Fred I was with us on Korn TV and have suggested him to make together a song in spirit old school bethroom. I do not know, whose it was idea, mine or him, or Fieldy, but we at once have started to work. It was very much funny. " Justin Jonathan: " Justin is incurably hurt guy which last desire was to see us. It has simply struck me. Before the death he wants to see us! Really we are allocated with something? Than we are remarkable? We have certainly met him. At Jonathan there was such will power what is not present at anybody. I am amazed to force of it guy. To me such... " Seed This song about child Jonathan, Nathan'e. Cameltosis " It is the love song devoted to all women, gave to me a pain. I am afraid to grow fond of someone because this someone can cause me a pain. About it and Cameltosis. " My Gift to You Jonathan: " my wife always wanted, that I have written to her a love song - and My Gift To You (my gift to you). " Upwards  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Issues Dead " All I want in life is to be happy ", these words became the motto of many people. When I feel happy, something comes and takes away it from me. Then I feel, that I again anybody as if I am dead. " Trash "Trash" - a song how I have thrown out my world and the everything else in a pipe. I have torn with the wife. All this has taken place, when I was in round and was perfect fucked up. Beg For Me During rounds I feel well only when I leave on a stage, and about it this song. To be on a stage is that is necessary for me every day. Only on a stage my alarms leave. Make Me Bad " I need to feel the sickness in you "... The Song has appeared from the most ordinary occupation - sex, but for me it means much more. I have already been married, when, being in round, have overslept with other woman, that is have changed to the wife. Now I am not married any more, the marriage does not approach under my style of a life. Unless it is bad, what I have pepper and there is a desire to be with someone? Why I should love only one? As well as at any animal, an overall objective of the person - duplication. It is incorporated by the nature... My former wife - the good person, but I have correctly made, that have divorced from her, having left her life, and - the... Wake Up Song about quarrel on family values ' 98 when the group was close to disorder.. But thank God, all has costed.. Hey Daddy Sometimes to me in a head different ideas climb, internal voices advise me everyones bullshit, basically, to kill themselves. Daddy - one of mine nicks, therefore in a song I as though speak it to myself. In general, it is difficult to explain it Dirty " I feel the whore for recording compannies which simply remove me. They simply row money from us. We can earn money only in one way - making infinite rounds and selling any dung. I feel itself such fool.. I simply go to fuck any fucked bitches because sex is a unique way to leave from all it. " - Jonathan.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Untouchables Here To Stay " Here To Stay is when you are full up people which take your advantage. I have written her being malicious that I was born the good guy. And good guys always make benefit for somebody. I am tired from it, and I am not going to allow further to you it with me, " - Jonathan. Wake Up Hate " All song is one big " fuck off ". It is a song about feeling of hopelessness - as children lose sense to live further. What the shit him to live further? When I grew, children had many opportunities which now as though have evaporated. They finish school and get any senseless work or simply go to kill and plunder people. It about any revolt, the true revolt! " - Jonathan. Hollow Life " This song how is empty the life and as we simply wait for any signs can. In her it is spoken, that we do nothing that something change, we simply disappear in due course. "  "For one human being to love another; that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparations." "Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love." "Love has a hem to her garment That reaches the very dust. It sweeps the streets and lanes, And because it can, it must." ~ Mother Teresa
