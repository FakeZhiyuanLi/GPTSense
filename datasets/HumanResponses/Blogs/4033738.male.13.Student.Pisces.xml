       As I walk through the valley where    I harvest my grain   I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain   But that's just perfect for an Amish like me   You know, I shun fancy things like electricity   At 4:30 in the morning    I'm milkin' cows   Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows...   ( fool)   And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that   Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone   I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline   Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin   But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine   Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699   We been spending most our lives   Living in an Amish paradise   I've churned butter once or twice   Living in an Amish paradise   It's hard work and sacrifice   Living in an Amish paradise   We sell quilts at discount price   Living in an Amish paradise   A local boy kicked me in the butt last week   I just smiled at him and turned the other cheek   I really don't care, in fact I wish him well   'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in hell   But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it   An Amish with a 'tude?   You know that's unheard of   I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat   And my homies all I agree I look good in black... fool   If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears   We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years   But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare   We're just technologically impaired   There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar   Not a single luxuryLike Robinson Caruso   It's as primitave as can be   We been spending most our lives   Living in an Amish paradise   We're just plain and simple guys   Living in an Amish paradise   There's no time for sin and vice   Living in an Amish paradise   We don't fight, we all play nice   Living in an Amish paradise   Hitchin' up the buggy, churnin' lots of butter   Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another   Think you're really rightous?   Think you're pure in heart?   Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art   I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like   On my knees day and night scorin' points for the after life   So don't be vain and don't be whiny   Or else, my brother, I might just have to get medieval on your heinie   We been spending most our lives   Living in an Amish paradise   We're all crazy Mennonites   Living in an Amish paradise   There's no cops or traffic lights   Living in an Amish paradise   But you'd probably think it bites   Living in an Amish paradise   Yuck
