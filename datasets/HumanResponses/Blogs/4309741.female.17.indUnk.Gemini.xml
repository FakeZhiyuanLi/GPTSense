        Hello world!      Another Monday done and gone. Only 34 left of this school year. How sad is that? I'm already counting down. Today actually was kind of decent. Definitely I nice change from this weekend. I woke up with a jolt this morning thinking I was late for school (turning out I actually wasn't), and then went to fabulous Government where Bethany and I decided we don't like our class. After that came a bunch of other stuff that doesn't even interest me so why would it you? We had bad today. I don't know why but for some reason I felt like being a butt today so I made them stand at attention while everyone else wasn't and kept yelling. I'll have to work on that. After band came a devotional at Chad and Sherry's. I much enjoyed that. I like actually getting to talk to the girls about some stuff that's been on my mind. They are a great group of girls and I'm excited about our possible road trip to Abilene.      So 3 1/2 days until we leave for San Antonio!! Man that is going to be such a party! The bus ride back shouldn't be too bad either. I'm sitting with Tyler Cook and he's a cool kid so that'll be fun. The best part though will be reminiscing about our previous night. Wahoo!!!      Interesting random fact for One Tree Hill watches: Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush (that's Brooke on the show) are ENGAGED!!! I can't believe it. UGH! My dream man is taken. This blows! Oh well, that means... well I'm not quite sure but it has to be something good, right?      Interesting random analogy: Today in anatomy, Mr. Cotten was relating the phospholipid bilayer and cholesterol to something that everyone would understand. Well first them me tell you what the phospholipid bilayer is. It's the cell membrane, in short, made up of phosphates and lipids. Inside of it is cholesterol. Naturally, the more cholesterol you have, the less it is able to move around. Well he compared our school entry way (where everyone stops around the stairs while others are trying to get to class) to the phospholipids and the people that gather within it to cholesterol. So, in conclusion, those of you from now on that decide to stop in that area and prevent the rest of us from being productive will be referred to as cholesterol. And yes, I know sometimes cholesterol can be a good thing, but in this particular situation, you are not.      Now that I've rambled on about meaningless nonsense I think I'll go to bed.           Quip/Quote of the Day: Men think women cannot be trusted too far; women think men cannot be trusted too near.

       So here it is. Didn't think I'd actually end up making one of these things, but indeed I did. I am currently playing solitaire. I don't know if I just suck at it or if it really is challenging, but I can't seem to win.    Well, I started the final lap in my high school mile this past week. To be honest, I'm ready for it to be over. I have no friends in my classes with the exception of a few and band sucks. Oh well 13 weeks until thanksgiving, then 3 until Christmas break. This next weekend we have a game in San Antonio. It's totally going to rock. Sarah, Lindsay, Rachel, and myself are going down Friday morning, visiting the Trinity University campus and then partying all night for Sarah's birthday. I can't believe she is about to be 18! Eek!! Pardon me for sounding like our parents but I remember meeting her freshman year in Latin, man that class blowed but we made it work. I am going to miss them next year but I'll be sure to keep in touch.    I went shopping yesterday and got my prom dress. Yes, I know some of y'all are thinking, "Prom dress! This early?" Well I found it last year and decided that's the one, so I decided to get it early for senior pictures. I also saw Napoleon Dynamite for the THIRD time last night. I swear that movie just keeps getting better. I must agree with Sam and JMC though that the shirts are a bit much guys. Sure, it'd be comical to have a "Vote for Pedro" shirt but everyone would know what it means. I much prefer the ones like "Moo-Ha!"    Anyhow, I really should get on that English paper or maybe my Government packet.       Quip/Quote of the Day: "A crowd finds it easier to cheer than to think."
