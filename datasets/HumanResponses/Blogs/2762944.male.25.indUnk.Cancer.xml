      The team: Anthony Minichiello, Luke Rooney, Matt Cooper, Mark Gasnier, Luke Lewis, Brad Fittler, Trent Barrett, Jason Ryles, Danny Buderus (c), Mark O'Meley, Nathan Hindmarsh, Craig Fitzgibbon, Shaun Timmins. Interchange: Willie Mason, Ben Kennedy, Brent Kite, Craig Wing. 18th man: Brett Finch   A few changes forced by injury and returns from injury, I really don't think that this team is as strong as the one that lost Origin II.  Barrett's inclusion is a bonus for the Blues because he is a class player, although not nessecarily a halfback.  Fittler's selection was a given and as always he could prove the difference.  Gasnier and Cooper don't match up to Gidley and Tahu (both injured) so they lose a fair bit in the outside backs, with Lewis and Rooney being solid but not spectacular.  Decent foward pack this time, Ryles is good in the front row but Kennedy is a risk due to injury.  Overall, a weaker backline than Origin II but a much better forward pack - I think on paper Queensland might just be the stronger side.

      Yeah yeah I am a wrestling nut and there is a PPV on this weekend so here is what I think is going to happen :  WWE Championship : Eddie Guerrero (c) vs John Bradshaw Layfield Watching Bradshaw promos over the last few weeks, I couldn't help but notice the striking resemblance to one Vince McMahon - the same cocky attitude, rich, well dressed, strong ... I think Vince sees the JBL character as an extension of himself, and thus by giving Bradshaw the title he will be giving "himself" the title. Not that this is in any way the right thing to do, because as a character JBL may be strong but as a wrestler he has nothing. Prediction : John Bradshaw Layfield (unfortunately)  WWE Crusierweight Championship : Rey Mysterio (c) vs Chavo Guerrero Jr With the cruiserweight division not having any direction what-so-ever, this match is hard to predict. I think the WWE will punish Chavo for the sins of the father, and give the win to Rey Rey to keep the crowd happy. Prediction : Rey Mysterio  The Undertaker vs The Dudley Boys Eh, I wouldn't actually mind this match, if it wasn't for all the gimmickry involved. I think the Undertaker will not "do the right thing", beat the Dudleys fairly and squarely, save Paul Bearer, then show that he no longer needs to follow the power of the urn and end this silliness. Prediction : The Undertaker  WWE United States Championship : John Cena (c) vs Rob Van Dam vs Booker T vs Rene Dupree This match will be the one that I enjoy the most - I like all of the wrestlers involved and the fact that it is elimination now will make it all the more interesting. Any winner would suit, but I'll go with John Cena, just so he can continue to infuriate GM Angle. Prediction : John Cena  Sable vs Torrie Wilson Torrie is the face (I think) and the better looking (IMO) so she will win. Prediction : Torrie Wilson  Kenzo Suzuki vs Billy Gunn and Hardcore Holly vs Mordecai These two matches can be grouped together - overpushed veteran vs newcomer ... I think that Kenzo and Mordecai are going nowhere and the WWE doesnt want to take a chance on them actully being able to put the gimmicks over, so the veterans for the win. Prediction : Billy Gunn, Hardcore Holly  Enjoy

      I'm sick and tired of not having any money.  If someone wants to give me $5000 that would be great.  Email address is on the left.  Cheers.

      So it took three days longer than it should have but the lawn mowing and car washing has been done ... whether or not it is done successfully I won't say but at least I had a go.  Back to work tomorrow so I guess we'll have to see how updating goes then, I am off during the mornings so I will keep writing as long as I feel inspired ... heh, not that I am writing anything particularly inspiring that is.  Cest la vie.

      All sorts of strange shit happening this morning ... first I have a 13yo from Brisbane on Messenger trying to tell me I was in love with his girlfriend but he wasn't going to yell at me ... good for him ... and just now a nurse rocked up at my front door to do some home therapy or something ... what the?  Heh, at least it gives me something to write about.

      Garth and Brooke's engagement party is on tonight, and damn it is gonna be COLD!!  Its midday here and freezing enough, and the wind sure isn't helping at all.  To make it worse, I promised to wash the cars this weekend so I am not looking forward to have to stand there in the cold wind spraying water everywhere.  I'm actually gonna mow the lawn too, the first time I've had to do it myself in about four years, so that should be interesting.  Then tomorrow we might go to Brisbane for a bridal expo or something like that, depending on how we recover from the party tonight.  Fun fun ...

      Well then, this makes it my second attempt at a weblog.  The first one ("The Story of My Life") started out promisingly enough but for whatever reason I just didn't like it and/or couldn't be bothered updating it so it was doomed for deletion sooner rather than later.  So now I have this - "Semi-Charmed Life" - which I can only hope actually lasts this time.  Fingers crossed!  "Semi-Charmed Life" is a song by Third Eye Blind - it has a catchy little tune going on which I like and it has been one of my favourite songs for years now.  Although I can't really identify with the lyrics, the title is what relates to me since I believe that I have led a semi-charmed life up to now - it has been quite the fun little ride and also quite successful, although it has had no right to be - hence semi-charmed.  Not that I am complaining.  Here goes nothing ...

      "Semi-Charmed Life" by  urlLink Third Eye Blind   I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden  and she lives for me  She says she lives for me  Ovation  She's got her own motivation  she comes round and she goes down on me  And I make her smile  It's like a drug for you  Do ever what you want to do  Coming over you  Keep on smiling, what we go through  One stop to the rhythm that divides you  And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse  Chop another line like a coda with a curse  I come on like a freak show takes the stage  We give them the games we play, she said  I want something else  To get me through this  Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby I want something else  I'm not listening when you say  Good-bye   The sky it was gold, it was rose  I was taking sips of it through my nose  And I wish I could get back there  Some place back there  Smiling in the pictures you would take  Doing crystal myth  Will lift you up until you break  It won't stop  I won't come down, I keep stock  With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop  And then I bumped up  I took the hit I was given  Then I bumped again  And then I bumped again, I said  How do I get back there to  The place where I fell asleep inside you?  How do I get myself back to  The place where you said   I want something else  to get me through this  Semi-charmed kinda life baby, baby I want something else  I'm not listening when you say  good-bye   I believe in the sand beneath my toes  The beach gives a feeling  An earthy feeling  I believe in the faith that grows  And the four right chords can make me cry  When I'm with you I feel like I could die  And that would be all right  All right   And When the plane came in  She said she was crashing  The velvet it rips  In the city we tripped  On the urge to feel alive  But now I'm struggling to survive  Those days you were wearing  That velvet dress  You're the priestess, I must confess  Those little red panties  They pass the test  So slide up around the belly  Face down on the mattress   One   Now you hold me  And we're broken  Still its all that I want to do just a little now,  Feel myself with a head made of the ground  I'm scared but I'm not coming down, no no And I won't run for my life  She's got her jaws just locked now in smile  but nothing is all right  All right   I want something else  To get me through this  Semi charmed kind of life  I want something else  I'm not listening when you say  Good-bye

      ... until my birthday, so if you haven't already bought me a present then hop to it eh!!  Meanwhile, in other news :  The Broncos actually beat a team lower than them in the premiership on Sunday.  Karmichael Hunt scored four tries, which is a big boost to my fantasy team on Virtual NRL.  We won 60-24 this week and still lead the table as the highest scoring and best defensive team.  Go Ridley Revolution go!!  State of Origin is tomorrow, and the only thing that worries me about Queensland's chances are that they have never won at Telstra Stadium in 7 or 8 attempts.  Darren Lockyer is the key and if he is on his game (gut feel is he will be) the Queensland will get home.  Australia beat Sri Lanka in the cricket test in Darwin and it was great to see Michael Kasprowicz take seven wickets in the second innings.  Hopefully a better batting pitch in Cairns will make the second game more of a contest.  Haha, now this is funny ... was at work yesterday and they filmed a TV commercial to air up here and I get to be the main person in it ... lucky me, especially since I had been working for ten hours at the time and looked like shit.  Sheesh.  More later ... enjoy ...
