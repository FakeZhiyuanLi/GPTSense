      Earlier, someone (who had seen me on TV) asked me how I did a nip up. I responded "I'm not the best person to ask. There's a couple people who can do it better than me". He responded by saying that I do them smoothly or something like that.   For those who are unaware, a nip up is sort of a dance move where you lay on the ground, and throw your feet up, and push up with your arms. It's pretty cool to look at, and it takes some upper body strength to do. So basically, a fat person couldn't do this if they tried.   It took me, surprisingly, only a week to learn how to do it. The first time I did it, I was like "wow, that was really hard". But there's a way. If you can do it, you know what it is. If you're just figuring out how to do it, you'll eventually figure it out.  Wow, three posts in less than a day. Proves how much of a life I don't have.  Peace in the Middle east (hopefully).

      Damnit our wrestling ring broke, and we can't wrestle! The beam that supports the weight of the ring is starting to break down the middle, and that's a bad for those of you at home.  Stay funky fresh.

      Hmmm, what the hell is a blog anyway.  But seriously folks, I was bored and I decided to make one of theses doodads for my own personal......crap...I was gonna say a big word. Use! There we go. Yes, own personaly use.  Anyways, as you know I'm a backyard wrestler and most likely the only time I'll update this thing is if we have a show, house show, or something amazing happens to me.  And for my first update, we're having a house show (non-televised show)today, and I probably will not go, but chances are they'll find some way of making me.  So have a exstatic day, and eat your veggies.   Vortex

      Well, by golly it's almost time for Anihilation, and in terms of being prepaired, I am not in shape whatsoever. Staying away from the gym for almost a month really kills your body. I returned to the gym today, and I barely left alive.&nbsp; I'm mostly trying to work on my arms, chest, and abs. I doubt I'll get any of that before Anihilation, but it's worth a try. &nbsp; In other news, there was a House Show yesterday where I made my in ring return. Although I lost, I think my performance was my best yet, despite the match being almost 5 minutes long. It should at least help me in my TLC match at you know where. &nbsp; Bazooka Joe says "Boom shaka laka, Boom shaka laka, Boom!"

      Well, for one, we held our Fourth of July show "Scars and Stripes" on Saturday, and despite me not being there, it looked to be somewhat of a success. X breaks American Flags (Boo!), Stoney does a 619 to Clean Slates ass (Yay!), and Seth Cage comes out, to remind of of the Big Bossman (........). Anyway, if you happen to live in Vacaville, CA check for it this Thursday, or Saturday @ 10PM.  Onto other news, Mr. Owner of BWA went out with this very cute girl named Heather, and it was all good fun. We saw Dodgeball (Ben Stiller=ratings), and went to Starbucks to have a cup of "joe" as they may or may not call it nowadays. Discussions included puppy dogs, driving (almost......have......Permit........!), me going to a party naked, and drinking to say the least. Although I went pretty early for my time (woke up at 10! AM! In the Summer! Argh!), and I was switched into "awake enough to recognize my natural surroundings" mode, Heather is alot of fun, and we're gonna go out again.  Hopefully :)  Anyways, peace to all my G's, and later to all my homies out there.   I'm rich biotch! (Honk, honk!)
