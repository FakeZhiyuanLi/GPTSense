      I got invited to go bowling with a few people last night, so I decided to go.  Wow, it's been at least a year since I last bowled, and I was pretty rusty.  No competition though.  After going spare, spare, spare, strike, strike the next closest player knew he was playing for 2nd place.  Even though I bowled a 191 and 157, I was a little disappointed with my performance.  Maybe it was the rust, or maybe it was my sore thumb, which I smashed badly the other day, but I never could find my strike ball.  Aside from a few lucky strikes, all I got was spare, spare, spare.  Spares are boring (but they'll get you a high average).  Guess I shouln't complain too much.  Overall, it was fun - except for when someone decided to spill beer on me.

      Well, it's 2:30 in the morning and I can't sleep.  I've decided to post a post about my insomnia.  I actually have some sleeping pills, but I didn't want to use them figuring I can sleep on my own.  I don't know.  I guess I'm the type who does not want to take any body altering substances (drugs) unless absolutely necessary.  I generally won't even take, say tylenol, unless I'm really debilitated by a headache or something.  I thought, well I woke up at 7am this morning, so I should be able to sleep by midnight right?  No.  My body temperature is burning up as if I should be doing some sort of physical activity right now instead of sleeping.  My room is slightly too warm so I turn on the fan.  Then I'm too cold so I cover up.  Then I'm too hot so I uncover.  Repeat ad infinitum.  Meanwhile, my brain won't shut up.  I hate it that at night, I just keep thinking and thinking about various stuff.  I wish I could just flush all the thoughts out of my brain so I can get some sleep.  I love that in the morning, I have nothing on my mind.  It's like a clean slate.  I just wish that it would happen at night!  I wish there was a button I could press which would make me fall asleep.  With my insomnia, I do get enough sleep, usually about 8 hours.  Problem is, I can't seem to control  when  I get to sleep.  It would be nice if my body didn't operate on some freakish 32 hour cycle...  Oh well, right now I'm trying to decide if I should just take my sleeping pills, or if I should try to wait until I get tired and sleep a shorter amount of time (say 5am to 11am) and use the slight sleep deprivation to help me get to sleep earlier on the next day.  Sorry for ranting on and on.  If this post isn't making sense, maybe I getting tired...  hopefully.

      Is it better to 'play it safe', or should you take the risky path?  At what point does rationality lead to insanity?  This movie I saw, "Love Me If You Dare", pushes the limits of a relationship.  A story of Julien and Sophie, it looks at the most extreme case of, perhaps it's 'love', or quite possibly 'insanity'.  Watching this movie reminded me of a couple of books I read long ago,  Les Miserables  and  Wuthering Heights .  Both books were  romantic  in style.  That is, they often describe events that were extraordinary.  The mundane was nowhere to be seen.  It's hard for me to describe.  Here is a definition:  Romanticism -  Artistic and intellectual movement that originated in the late 18th century and stressed strong emotion, imagination, freedom from classical correctness in art forms, and rebellion against social conventions   This movie reminded me of those books (not quite as good, mind you).  Everything was exaggerated, stylized.  It was hard, fast, and exciting.  Maybe a little too exciting.  I cannot fully recommend this movie because it has a some flaws.  The main characters are not particularly likable; loathsome even (and probably certifiable).  And the ending may seem wanting (or poetic, or too ambiguous, depending on your point of view).  If this all sounds intriguing to you, go ahead and see the movie.  I would not call it great, but you won't find it boring.  Notes:  It is in  French  with English subtitles.  If you want to see it, act fast!  It is an independent movie and may not stay in the theaters for long.  The male lead resembles Patrick Dempsey; not that it's important I just happened to notice it.  And remember, the one game you must never play is 'bury yourself in a cement block'...

      I had an anxiety attack today.  This almost never happens to me.  I choose to eschew the occasional mental breakdown for a semi-permanent dour disposition.  I needed some air.  I leave the people infested theater to traverse the smoky casino.  Fresh air nowhere in sight.  I move through the casino and enter the exhaust filled parking lot.  I arrive at my car and enter.  I take some deep breaths.  Not exactly 'fresh' air, I take what I can get.  I'm on the clock so I can't stay.  I make my way back to the theater, passing under the hot sun in my black on black ensemble.  Only half my anxiety released, I go back to work.  There is no escape.

      Took me awhile to post the Kill Bill Quiz results because there were errors in the HTML code.  Looks like it's time to learn HTML.  It seems easy enough - I was able to fix it by trial and error.  However, it would be nice to be able to change the layout of my blog.  I'm not sold on the color scheme, especially the fonts.  And I don't particularly like using another person's template...

      Well, hello.  This is my first post on my first blog.  I'm new to the world of blogging, but it seems interesting so I decided to give it a try.  So here it is.  As of now, I'm not sure what direction I want to go with this blog.  Hmm, should I make it a journal of events in my life?  Or should I post commentary on this crazy world?  Maybe I should share some background information about myself?  Who knows, but hopefully it will be fun.  For now, I think I'll take a look at some of those internet quizzes...

      The skies poured rain upon us this weekend. Considering I live in a desert city, this was somewhat surprising. Perhaps more surprising was the fact that I had stepped out of the movie theater 2:30 am early Saturday morning having watched Napoleon Dynamite for the 2nd time in three days. See, it is unusual for me to watch a movie more than once (at least until it hits television). Watching movies is such a time consumer that I try to at least watch  different  movies.    I was curious, so I went to see Napoleon Dynamite for the first time. I would hesitate to call the movie great. The protagonist is seriously flawed and not very likable. The characters seem a bit underdeveloped. The plot is flimsy at best. Although the movie is very funny at times, what would possess me to go back?    Upon further reflection I realize Napoleon Dynamite is actually a much closer representation of reality than most movies. So what if the movie has no  point  to it? Rarely does life have a point. As illustrated in the movie, life is more like a series of events that come after each other. There are highs and lows, but they tend to come unexpectedly and without rhyme or reason. I look at Napoleon Dynamite as the antithesis of the WB network and all the 'teen' movies that have come out over the years. I mean, how often in real life do you see people who are so good looking, articulate, and well adjusted. You may know a few of these people, but certainly not  everone . Napoleon Dynamite looks at the other extreme. The main character is obnoxious and pathetic. Social interaction is awkward and stilted. Even the popular kids seem more or less ordinary. Granted, the film exaggerates a little, but that's what makes it funny.    Napoleon Dynamite is not for everybody.  I liked it, perhaps because it is so  opposite  of all the typical teen movies, that I feel by seeing it, I'm helping to restore the cosmic balance of the universe. I know someone who saw it (twice) to see the 'stupodity' of it (and I'm quoting him verbatim). The real star of the movie is not Napoleon himself, but the world he lives in. It is both absurd, yet somehow familiar.

      I come in to work today, and my co-workers express amazement that I'm drinking a  diet mountain dew  (yes this mythical soda does exist)!  What's the big deal, there are many advantages to someone who drinks diet soda.  Advantages of drinking diet:   No aftertaste!   You don't waste calories on soda. I'll admit I'm a bit of a soda junkie. Approximate calorie allotment per day: around 2,000 (more if I do some physical activity) Calories wasted on drinking diet soda: 0 More food for me to eat!   If I do happen to eat something that's sugary, like cheesecake, it tastes much sweeter.  After all, I'm not used to the sugar rush, so the effect is greater.   You don't like diet?  I didn't either.  When I had braces a long time ago, my orthodontist suggested I switch to diet.  It took me several weeks to get acclimated to the taste (It tasted pretty nasty at first).  But after that, it tasted just fine.  In fact, I can't drink regular cola anymore because it tastes like pure syrup to me!  Look, I'm not trying to convert anybody.  I just want people to stop hurling the stones of sarcasm at all the poor people who do drink diet.  I'm not trying to lose weight, I just want to get more mileage out of my food!  Odds and Ends I drink  regular  sprite because I needed something to drink that doesn't have caffeine.  There's not much variety in diet sodas (only diet coke/pepsi) out there, outside of the supermarket.  I also need my iced tea with sugar.  Ironically, I can't stand diet sprite or diet iced tea (blech!)

      Okay, to be honest lately I've had the urge to write some poetry.  Unfortunately I have lacked the  ability  to write anything worthwhile.  What's weird, is that in the span of one year, six years ago, I wrote a half dozen or so poems.  Nothing since then.  So what's different?  What was I feeling then which allowed me to use poetry as a receptacle.  Was is  wistfulness  or  anguish ?  Who knows?  I'm surprised that I managed to write anything due to my perfectionism and my obsession with rhyming stuff.  In other news, I've filled out my  urlLink profile .  It's not necessarily complete, but you can take a look, if you dare...

      I usually don't buy music CDs.  They are, in my opinion, way overpriced.  When I buy a CD, I usually can't help but feel disappointed with the overall product.  Sure, some of the songs are good, but unless I like the whole CD, I feel I overpaid.  I'll admit that CDs make good gifts, but buying them for yourself seems pretty inefficient.  A while back, going against my instincts, I decided to buy a Billy Joel Greatest Hits CD, figuring I would like most of the songs.  Before I go on, I should let you know that I have this tendency to not want to change CDs in my CD player.  Instead, I go ahead and play the same CD over and over again for hours.  How unfortunate that I find that my Billy Joel CD really consists of 2 CDs!  What's worse, half of my favorite songs are on one CD and half on the other.  So, as I sit hear listening to the 2nd CD (over and over again, hours on end), I decide I should start investigating CD burning technology.  That way, I can make ONE unified Billy Joel Greatest Hits CD, with the songs I want.  What!?  Someone agrees with me?  Visit  urlLink here  for someone who also thinks CDs are overpriced (among other things).

      I just recently browsed through a book illustrating the way of the Ninja.  It was pretty interesting.  For example, one of the main principles of the way of the Ninja is endurance.  Physical, mental, and spiritual endurance is considered very important.  The goal is to survive the hardships of life and death.  In order to survive, you have to train your endurance.  You survive so you can continue to protect your friends and family.  According to the book, survival is more important than 'winning'.  It is better to avoid a fight, except as a last resort.  You pick your fights, and fight only when you know you can win.  And finally, the best victories are those achieved without fighting.  Also, the book emphasizes awareness.  Ninjas have great awareness of their environment.  That way, they knows when to wait, and when to strike.  A ninja must subvert his or her own ego, and must never act on revenge, etc.  I found the book interesting, since in some other media ninjas are considered assassins or fighting machines.  But like many other martial arts, it is more a way of life than anything else.  Too bad the book was so expensive ($35), it had some cool pictures of, say, ninja chain mail which was sometimes worn under ninja garb.

      In an effort to motivate myself to re-apply for college, I made the resolution to stop blogging until I finished my application.  After all, certain things should take priority over other things, right?  Hours passed.  Then days.  Then weeks.  Then month- well fortunately I stopped being 'distracted' and finished my application.  So what has happened in the meantime?  Unfortunately, like a dream, life can be a bit hazy when you look back on it - unless you're keeping notes as you are going through it.  I haven't been keeping notes.  It's like the dream I had the other day.  The only thing I remember is that I dreamt that I got a sunburn.  I didn't write anything down when I woke up, so that's the only thing I remember.  Thing is, looking back I'm not so sure I really dreamt it at all.  I might have been thinking that I was going to get a sunburn one day, and now I only  thought  I dreamt actually getting a sunburn.  What has happened in the meantime?  Well, I watched a lot of movies.  I'm usually picky when it comes to seeing movies, but people have been encouraging me to see this movie and that.  "Go see Dodgeball, it's hilarious!" (they're right).  "Spiderman 2 is better than the original!" (right, again)  "Harold an Kumar Go to White Castle was so funny, I was rolling on the floor!" (again, surprisingly good)  On the other hand, I've heard very divided comments for  The Village .  Some people liked it, some hated it.  Even Ebert and Roeper are divided straight down the middle.  I'll probably go see it.  I haven't seen any of Shyamalan's movies yet, so I won't be looking for a twist or anything.  Worked quite a bit.  Went to a baseball game.  I do recall trying to convince a friend of mine to not drop out of college (probably in vain).  He was complaining that he didn't understand his teacher - he was speaking gobbledygook.  Unfortunately I know the feeling, it's a tough situation to be in.  Hopefully he will persevere.  That's all I have for now, I'm going to see a concert by Chieli Minucci in a few hours.  Ciao.
