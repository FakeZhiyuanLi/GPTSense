      all the words in the universe cannot express how much I love you and as every day and every night goes by there is nothing else I'd rather do  than to wrap you in my arms or to softly kiss your lips or to run my fingers through your hair and place my hands upon your hips the magic in your eyes the softness of your cheek these are the little things that make my knees feel weak since the first day I laid my eyes upon you nothing else has crossed my mind and as I went on to look for someone to love you were the one that I wanted to find you have the key to my heart and the key to my soul a little eye contact and a smile and I just lose control my heart beats faster when you're around my heart stops when you're not near I miss you every second of every day and I still miss you when you're here there is no one in existence that can make me feel like this that's the very reason I write this with all my love  and seal it with a kiss

      How can you say you love me, then act like you dont care? How can you say you love me, but then your never there. Everynight you make me cry,  whether you realize it or not. Everynight i wanna die, but thats not the way i was taught I feel like there is something missing, something deep down in my heart. I get that feeling now all the time, but especially when were apart. Those 14 months were the best of my life, But since we broke up, i have experienced nothing but pain and strife. I realize now that i need my life back, whether yer a part of it or not.  I cant go on living in this depression, i need to face the truth i've fought. So please make up yer mind, dont string me along like yer pet.  I have my own needs too, and i dont believe their being met. So leave me now or leave me never, and remember that if you leave me now, you'll be leaving me forever

      I might seem okay to you, And look like I moved on, But really I just can't accept, The fact you're really gone.  I just don't want to believe it, So I pretend that it's not true, Because I can't let you see the hurt, And what I'm going through.  Everytime I see your face,  It hurts me deep inside, I have to hold back all the tears, And they're getting hard to hide.  I wish I could just let it out, And show you how I feel, But instead I guess I'll smile, And make believe it's real.

      PLAIN OLD ME  I know that I will never be the perfect shape or size, but I know that I am beautiful  looking through your eyes.  My hair may not be perfect,  and I may not fit size 2, but I always feel so beautiful, all because of you.  I know I'm not a model,  and I know I'll never be, but you make me feel so great about  being plain old me.  My waist might not be tiny,  and my arms might not be thin, but somehow you have taught me,  to love the girl within.  If you werent here to love me,  and show me what you see, I wouldnt be this happy,  being plain old me.   [ i love you troy ]

      Poem i wrote for english  What is it to be confident?  She always wondered what it would be like to be confident, to step out the door in the morning and be proud of who she is.  That has never been her, she is always the one hiding in the corner.  Afraid to come out, to show herself, For she fears of being torn apart.  She stands infront of the mirror and says to herself, "If they dont know me, they cant hate me."  I just want to shake her, shake her and say, "If they dont know you, they can't like you."  But i can't, she can't know i can see her, everyday crying, sulking and wishing.  Wishing, that once she could be good enough, Good enough for the other kids her age.  So she could show them who she is,  Show them the "real" her.  But she's too afraid to be original, or to be different,  Or to stand up and tell everyone what she thinks. For she believes if she says something stupid,  Everyone will laugh at her, and she couldn't take that, she couldn't take the pressure.  The pressure of feeling alone, or feeling like everyone is centering her out.  So for now, she will stay, sheltered by the crowd. Because she's the shy one.  She's the one who will just sit and take everything in, And when someone pays attention to her, she jumps.  She gets all nervous, like she can't breath, but she shakes it off, she just shakes it off and says nothing  Because if they dont know her, they cant hate her.

       Well... Its like 1:26 and I'm supposed to be at school but since Mrs. Jacobson piled on all this h/w I stayed home today to sew my dress, I've been sewing since 8 with maybe a few 10-15 min breaks... Its so frustrating, although my dress is turning out pretty good... Maybe because my mom is helping me?  Ooo and I was supposed to get my yearbook today but since I was sick I wont get it till tomorrow, still exciting though except I look like shit in it and everyone is going to see my picture :| I shouldn't have worn my glasses ... But yeah maybe since they're handing the yearbook out before school is over this year I'll actually get more then 5 signatures... or maybe I just don't have enough friends? :|  Baseball... Baseball is going good, we've played 5 games and haven't lost one yet and I've only gotten out twice and walked once when she hit me (that means I've hit the ball like at least 10 times) so this year is looking up for our team...  WEEEEEEEEEE STANLEY CUP FINALS TONIGHT!! GO CALGARY, I can't wait! If Calgary doesn't win (which they will win) I will be sooo disappointed, but yeah I'm hoping to get to watch the game with Troy because its so much more fun watching it with someone else, but he doesn't know if he can do something yet... But yeah Gotta Love 'NHL' Hockey  anyways, I'm going to finish sewing my dress now because I'm supposed to go out with Kaila to hand resumes out right after school, so I need to get this done...

       Well my weekend suckkked... I did something with Troy friday, that was cool... we watched A Knights Tale and we i dont remember what else we did, then Saturday i had to work all day which sucked because i hate work and taking the goddamn bus, the night was better though because i got to do something with Troy, but it was kinda gay cuz we went to his house and when were at his house he wont even like lye close to me or touch me at all... (no not just like that... perverts) i mean cuddle and stuff like we normally do. Today suckkked so bad, i had to work all day which sucked then i only got a $96 paycheck which sucked, then i came home and did h/w all night which was gay as well...   Life sucks... Me and troy still arent going out, its been like 7 months, he confuses me though, he acts exactly as if we were going out, we do everything we did when we were going out (with 1 exception)... so yeah i dont really know what i wanna do... i hate being single it sucks. I want to move on but after a year and 1/2 of being together almost everyday, yeah thats kinda hard.   Bleh neways... gotta go finish all the fuckin projects assigned last minute... GRRR i hate mrs. Jacobson!!!

        PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate&nbsp; and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.  &nbsp;    You are a temptress   urlLink  Which Ultimate Beautiful Woman are You?    brought to you by

          Okay...        Alex Skelly is gay, he broke up with Tarah because hes "worried" about what to say to her, what a moron, yeah i'm pretty sure he used that excuse on Jenna and probably every other girl hes gone out with. Grrr... yeah but she can do much better neways, like he said to her "i dont know why you even like me, i have 4 friends and all i do is play video games" ... what a dork. but anyways.           &nbsp;     I'm so tired... Friday i worked all night then Saturday i worked all day then i was supposed to go to All-Stars for baseball after work but it was cancelled because it was raining. Which is really weird cuz my aunt lives up&nbsp;by the park(across town) and she said&nbsp;it was liek&nbsp;hailing and&nbsp;Shear park was like a lake and my coach said that too, and at&nbsp;my new house it was POURING (which is right over by steele street. Yet at my house&nbsp;literally 2 min drive from my new house, there was not 1 DROP of rain... it was CRAZY!! So since baseball was cancelled i went over to the new houe pretty much right after work&nbsp;and painted my room PINK, i didnt get home till like 10, then i had to wake up Sunday morning to work, then go to the movies... then tomorrow me and tarah are going to go to the mall&nbsp;if i get my paycheck tomorrow... which i better because i NEED it. I have like less then $1 in my bank...           &nbsp;     Ohh good news... Me and Troy are goin camping from July 26th till then 29th... We have to b home when our house closes on July 30th :-( ... I wish we could go up longer, i want to spend alot of time with him because we dont hang out as much anymore and it stinks... probably just because i'm working ALOT now, which means&nbsp;i'm making ALOT of money! wee... But when we go camping, at killbear... we can go like swimming, dingy boating (lol), rock jumping, have fires, so many things, im sooo excited! i wish i was going tomorrow! woo i love him :) ...           &nbsp;     His mom always tells me stories about Sarah (his sister) and Ian... and she says advice that she gives to Sarah, and wow does it ever relate to me and troy and i want to say " wow that reminds me so much of what troys doing"but his mom doesnt know that me and troy are more then friends (no matter what troy says )lol fooling around isnt what "friends" do, haha... troy used to say we were seeing eachother until about a week or so ago we got in a fight so were not anymore yet we've still&nbsp;fooled around, yeah it&nbsp;doesnt make sense to me either...&nbsp;but so much of the advice his mom&nbsp;gives relates to me and troy&nbsp;except me and troy went out for alot longer so its much more harder for me to actually take the advice and go thru with it... i dont think i could do it.           &nbsp;     Me and Troy went to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight, its a pretty good movie, like the concept and&nbsp;information is really interesting, just the way they presented it sometimes was a little boring... Ha Bush told Michael Moore to&nbsp;go get a real job though... poor Michael. But dont&nbsp;worry, Michael made fun of&nbsp;Bush ALOT!!!&nbsp;Bowling for Columbine is so&nbsp;much better though! I love that movie...           &nbsp;     I'm really bored... Troy told me he was going to come on MSN when he got to Mike and Kyles, but he still hasnt came on and that was like 2 hours ago, so bleh this succcckkss... I'm really bored, i'll probably end up doing a bunch of quizes and posting them haha...           &nbsp;     But i'm off to get started on some quizzes!        Stay Classy!

      Wow... I havent wrote for like almost 3 weeks... Well we moved into our new house a couple weeks ago, and then we drove by the old house and there was an old fat hairy man with no shirt on standing in MY garage!!! i dont want him near that house :-( ... i miss my beach room alreaddyyyy ! ahhhhhh... My new house isnt bad though, its alot bigger and weirdly not as scary when im home alone...  Me and Tarah went and saw the movie The Notebook... It was sooo good! Tarah Cried... :- lol  ... weirdo ! Then we walked home because we need exercise... We walked up dundonald hill which is soo big and i didnt even get tireed!! wahoooooo lol... i think i might walk home from work tomorrow depending on what time i get off, cause i can't miss BIG BROTHER!! WOO...  Since i last wrote... I have played lots of baseball, worked lots, went camping, moved and hung out with people.  Baseball... hmm we lost 3 games in a row :- which makes us like 13 wins and 4 loses, or something like that... eekkk we're goin downhill.. Still in 1st place i think though... I went to the all-star game and got a homerun ! wooo and ive gotten another homerun since then as well... Last game i got up 4 times, hit the ball everytime, got a homerun and got home everytime i got up... wooo, it was good!  Welll Me and Troy went camping a few days after i moved... It was pretty fun, we went swimming like alll day everyday, we played games, ate food, fed the chippies and made them take peanuts from our legs, shoulders, and mouth! lol but it was more then halfway out of mouth so theyd get really close but its not like theyd actually touch yer mouth! it was cool though... We got these like gigantic ice cream cones! lol... we stayed up one night till like 2 sitting on the rocks that go out far into the lake with my sisters boyfriend brad... talking about like life on other planets and the future lmao... it was fun tho! we stayed out there for like 2 hours... Then when we came home from camping my dad was doing all this sanding crap with the house so all the doors were plasticed up, and since my sis and mom stayed camping me and my dad wouild b the only ones home, and i would only b able to go in the kitchen so i just slept at troys... that was fun as well !!  Then my dad went back camping and my sister came home, so i was pretty much home alone that weekend cuz my sister was always gone out... So on the saturday night after work a bunch of people from work (Beth, Matt, Steph, Ami, Ian, Robert) Came over, and so did Justine... Before everyone got there i dyed Robert and Justines hair... Then when everyone got there went to steele street and played baseball, then came back to my house, ordered pizza (wit h the money our boss gave us!) and we watched The Exorcist :S ... gross movie... When everyone left me and justine walked to tim hortons and she slept over... the next day i had baseball... and that was that haha... that was last weekend...  This week i didnt really do much... But yeah that pretty much catches you up on everything since last time i wrote... or i think it should... I'm going to watch Starting Over!!  Night!
