      Tea this morning was serene as ever, Sensei gifted us with the presence of his own personal pottery and utensil collection. In preparation of the upcoming arrival of the grand tea master Sensei wants us all to get a feel of which pieces go well together and complement each other. Reminded me of Christmas, he brought in a box of boxes, the boxes within were of many sizes and wrapped in clothes. I sat back and watched as Sensei peeled the layers of wrapping from the surprisingly precious contents. First the outer clothe was untied and slide free of the wooden box within. These wooden boxes were made with extraordinarily skilled hands, flawless. The tops were tied on with thick durable laces that felt good between the fingers and the knots they employed to hold the boxes in check were an art in themselves. Thin rice paper lay cleanly between the laces and the lid of the box, I believe to protect the box against careless scratches from nails while untying the lace. With the lid clean one only need remove the newspaper stuffing in order to take out the artifact that lay within. Wow, this is quite a job when you have twenty some individually rapped pieces to unpack. The more complex the wrapping the more precious the article within, at one point I watched Sensei unpack a vase for presentation within the tokonoma. The piece had a real ora to it, I asked how old it was and was shocked to learn that it was over six hundred years old! Hard to grasp, especially as an American just how ancient that piece is. Throughout the practice that day I continually found myself gazing on that simple, unglazed, rather crudely made but incredible powerful vase.

       When a superior man hears of the Tao, he immediately begins to embody it. When an  average man hears of the Tao, he half believes it, half doubts it. When a foolish man  hears of the Tao, he laughs out loud. If he didn't laugh, it wouldn't be the Tao. Thus it  is said: The path into the light seems dark, the path forward seems to go back, the direct  path seems long, true power seems weak, true purity seems tarnished, true steadfastness  seems changeable, true clarity seems obscure, the greatest person seems unsophisticated,  the greatest love seems indifferent, the greatest wisdom seems childish. The Tao is nowhere to be found. Yet it nourishes and completes all things.    Tao Te Ching - Chapter 41

       My mango tree is out of control!!    Right now we’re harvesting about a shopping bag a day, which has been going on for a couple weeks now, no real end in the near future. My little morning ritual since, has been to make a heavenly smoothie out of the golden fruits. Nothing tastes better then the perfectly ripened juice from this tree, honestly! And there is no better way to start the day either… So I’m pretty much in heaven, (Along with all of the other lucky mango tree keepers in the area). Those lucky individuals that have had the honor of the gift of my tree are suddenly much nicer to me… Hmm? I guess the tree brings more then one gift.   Even when the tree is not fruiting, it offers the best view on the property, from its canopy I can see all the sites Honolulu has to offer including Diamond Head, Waikiki, Campus, the Pacific, and so on.   So please, all hail the mighty mango!!

      Another tea ceremony this morning, I truly enjoy my time in what seems to be the most comfortable environment my being has encountered since dawn. As I sit on the tatami, ankles burning from my own weight, I free the burning and take in the environment and all that it has to offer. The kitchen framed by shoji screens displays the mastery of uncountable crafts frozen in time. “We discard all jewelry watches rings and so on to show that we have that much respect for the instruments of tea…” says my Sensei. Looking upon the neatly kept shelves of ceramic and lacer ware this is easy to see. Not a single bowl biers a scratch let alone a chip, each piece is uniquely crafted and clean, some of the bowls are hundreds of years old yet one could not tell  My attention, now on the ceremony, follows the flowing movements of the server as she prepares tea for a guest sitting beside me munching delicately on a sweet in preparation for the thick bitter tea. Following the hands of one preparing tea, in thier ever flowing line of intentional movements, is like watching the white waters of a tumbling stream, enchanting in its grace for every rock below the surface brings a fitting reaction of submergence.   Haiku    Hands and Kettle steam Dancing with bowl and water Peaceful Saturday   Even though I understand little of what is said, I feel at home with the other students, like the family that’s missing on this island. I feel blessed that they have taken me in and treat me so kind.   Thanks to my Tea Family!             urlLink to learn more about haiku     urlLink to learn more about japanese tea

      Last night I partook in my first Kava session... Living in Honolulu for almost two years now I have come to realize that there is a certain dynamic that runs behind the everyday bustle of the city. A dynamism that it more deeply rooted in the ancient cultures of the native peoples that first populated these islands... First impression of the culture that permeates the island of Oahu was rather disappointing, noisy night scenes with little creative constructive release. SO, when I come across a gem of an environment like the small Kava bar, Hale Noe, I can take a deep breath in the realization that the past cultures still run strong and are deeply rooted in the more permanent aspects of the island society.   The scene is cozy, low-key lighting illuminates small tables and a humble bar garnished with fresh ginger blossoms and jungle greenery. In the corner, three men demonstrate there unity with acoustic jams, fresh bass lines with the occasional 12 string solo turn heads and brings jeers of Hana Hoe! Behind the bar and clearly ceremonious in nature lies a large Kava Bowl resting on three legs. In this bowl a cool and milky fluid is celebrated making possible the whole scene. Constantly it is being ladled into smaller dishes and served to the crowed. On the wall hangs scudelly a warning "If you are loud, obnoxious, or just plain mean a 10 dollar fee will be added to your bill." Sconces appear evenly along the walls and produce a warm glow, accompanied by the candles at each table there is just enough light to leave your neighboring table in gentle shadows. The walls are appealingly blank and clean.  I am blessed in having a Hawaiian brother and Cousin that emerge me in such happenings, Thank You both! Aloha!  I stirred with my finger and finished two small bowls of Kava along with some Taro root that was prepared in boiled pieces. The Taro was quite a delicate and delicious companion to the Kava which had a strange consistency that constantly demanded stirring, and after the first bowl my mouth felt as if it had been shot with Novocain. The taste was fresh and muddy and raw all at the same instant leaving an incredible sensation in your mouth that traveled gradually to the tip of your limbs, leaving you at total peace enabling you to enjoy the superb atmosphere that surrounds.   urlLink to learn more about Kava

      Spent the later part of the day with a friend of a friend from Hawaii. She is an interior designer and origanally frome the Chinese state of Taiwan. (I stress this for reasons hopfully talked about later in the blog) She took me around to some very interesting spots and invited me to dinner with some of her co-workers. We ended up eating at this great shanghainese resturant in south part of the city, and I had my first taste of really great Chinese food. A good thing since I was starting to have my doubts. to be continued...

       The city seems to be increasing in its pungency day by day. Never befor have i smelt and felt so many intrusive oders, they really cant be described fairly in words. Wwhat comes to mind as far as describing them is to imagine a mixture of rocket fuel and cow dung, create a mixture using equal parts put in a spray bottle, and mist lightly. Wahlaa, now you have your very own taste of what i have been breathing for the last week. Locals that I meet ask if the hot and humid weather has gotten to me, the answer is "No, but the air pollution here is enough to gag a sewer rat". Well I saw the cause of most of this foul air on my way into the city from the airport, we pasted through an industrial zone like youve never seen befor, except in some old black and white shots of industrial russia in the 30's. Anyway, smoke stacks as far as the eye could see and there plums all head to Sshanghai. Eevery morning my nose is full of boogers and the sand man is allways more than generous with his nightly sprinkle. I dont know how people handle it, really, I feel on the urge of gaging some moments. I guess it is partially due to the fact that hawaiis air is super clean for a small city. I hope it rains soon.

      A Mexican guy who has been living here for the past two years and I decieded to go out for a little dancing action last night. We kinda did a eny-meny-miny-mo to find a club in the endless listings and you guesed it Pegasus was choosen. It was listed as a hip-hop club with live freestyle battles in chinese of chorse... Lets put it this way I did'nt get my hopes up. Well we finally find the place, 2nd floor of some huge building in a ritzy part of Huaihai Zhong Rd. We were early, the door fee included a drink so we had a shot of Tokillya. Projection screen tvs and deep red lighting dominated the scene, a chill vibe for sure, i felt better about the situation and was wishing I would have dreeed a bit more fly. Sat back a while and watched as things started moven... the DJ looked like he came strait out of the Bay area of Cali but he spoke Manderan, a couple more DJ's joined in and a Jamacan dude started playen some pretty solid jams, were talken Roots, J5, Usher, DJ shadow, MC solar, And even some oldschool DeLa. I was stooked Dancen like a mad man bueatful people all around, impressive. I wasent expecting to find such a live party here but on the other hand we are talking about 20 million people. Lets just say that we all danced into the early morning, had a great time and oh ya... that rap battle, well somehow that turned into a wet T-shirt contest that was border-line out of controll.   All in all, i think i'm beggining to really like this big dirty City.

      Computers are old here Win98, outdated video cards, software, lack of USB, slow connection speeds you name it. The enviroment of the internet cafes here are another story... So pictures may not come for a while, sorry i know you all want to see... Oh and yes there is no spell check because the browser I have does not support Java script(???)  Anyway I have been taking alot of photos, you better believe it.

      The dramatic way of life here is strange and sureal. Last night I was in the French Concessions having a beer or two with somw fellow travelers but was rather reluctant to caugh up the rmb's required. The enviroments were catchy and creative but the prices were exsorbatent allmost silly 40 rmb (4 usd) per beer and never ice cold. To put this in perspective apon awaking this morning i went across the street with a local friend and had freash soymilk and rice pourage for 2rmb (25 cents). That is what i mean by dramatic or drastic... you can spend 25 cents or 25 dollars on practicly the same meal here depending on the eviroment.  The same can be seen everywhere whether it be buildings, clotheing, attitudes, and i dont mean only price but just the state of being. Some neiborhoods are as posh as the ritzy mountian resort towns of colorado like vail and aspen, and yet in other areas there is severe poverty as i have never seen, and this contrast seeps into all aspects of life...  The examples are endless, walking through a quazi construction site slash no-mans-land one could see the Jin Mao tower rise at its rear again representing the extremes of life present hear.

      This is a land where street signals are a meer suggestion, cars drive without lights at night, and boards with protruding nails lay in the middle of your path, a land with only one time zone. Everything is much more lax, im not sure how to discribe it other than the little things are offten overlooked. Today i stood at the top of a hotel garden tarace in the art decco style overlooking the bund, all by myself. A small cumquat bush lay beside me and as i munched on its sweet fruits I thought that Shanghai is a wonderfull place to explore, because these little things are ofter overlooked like the locking of a rooftop access door or gate to a hidden park, and so on. Oh and there is so much to explore and learn here.  For the first time i am actually interested in learning the destinct differance in styles such as baroque, Neo-Grecian neoclassical, art deco and so on. And what a wonderful place to learn them.

      It feels like a dream, in a way it is, a dream come true. Now that i am here the reality is set apon me. Everything is differant yet the same.  First thing after arriving at my hotel (it is a wonder how i found it) was to see the bund. Actually the bund called me I could see the Jin Mao tower through the haze and new that if i walked in that direction it would lead me to the riverfront. It is all much bigger then i could have ever imagined, and inexpensive as well. I believe yesterdays lunch was 50 cents, or something like that.   I walk through the streets and people react, smile, wave or stare or beg, fallow, laugh, cry run or just try to sell fake rolexs to... It is a dream land, meaning that many of my sences have been severed and in balence hieghtening others. For instince the whole city seems to be layers of movment high speed on low and so forth. Even the lights all move. the people migrate in torents. old ac units drip, bikers never stop and even the heat comes in waves with the dust.  Yesterday on the bund i cried  Because of the beauty of turning dream into reality.

       All&nbsp;I can do is say that it must have been meant to happen. And that is to stay in Soule one day longer exactly. I awoke at 4:30 this morning grabbed my gear and walked to the bus stop among the muggy&nbsp;dawn alone with the secedes and riot police. This is another story... SO I arrived at the airport walked into the terminal and POW my hart jumped into my throat. I had left my plane tickets and travelers checks in my locker at the hostel. Panic!!! Well once that had worn off&nbsp; realized that I life was not quite over... After talking with the teller at the ticket office he offered quite a nice&nbsp;option, the same exact flight on the following day. Oh so now I am back at the hostel and am having a great time networking with fellow hostlers.  &nbsp;

       The last couple of days have become an incredible blur. From the Tea ceremony with the grand tea master to dinner at the Japanese consulate to my now nearly finished day of Soule. What can I say?   &nbsp;  This city has got a lot of Soule. I have seen a big chunk of it in the last 24 hours but not nearly the whole spread. So many new tastes, smells (not all of them pleasant), and sites. Everything from antcient city gates and palaces to modern works by KPF and the like. And of coarse there is always the not quite as spectacular but somehow more significant everyday cityscapes, a fusion of old and new, unique districts rich with the life blood of the city.

      Finished repapering the Shoji screens today, the process was interesting/inspiring, the cycle of renewal represented seems natural, and the way the new paper is applied is quite elegant. I had hoped to take some pictures of the process but found the lighting uninviting and myself quite busily caught in the flow of work. The screen as a physical object is quite sophisticated, its interior frame or skeleton, made of cedar is durable and light weight with quite a long life span, its members are flush on one side to adhere to the rice paper. This paper has a considerable shorter life but is easily replaced yearly to maintain a clean look, few tools are needed to apply the paper and the glue is also made of rice. The rice paper is misted with water once it is glued to the frame so that when dry it is taught and even giving the frame extra strength. The paper has magnificent translucent properties transmitting delight to the observers within and without.   I will take the time to think over the possibilities the shoji has to offer modern architecture, keeping in mind the dichotomy between the materials and their lifespan. I particularly like the concept of the ridged framework being married with such a delicate skin. As soon as I can take some measurements I will create a detailed computer model showing joinery and proportion. Would think it especially interesting to apply the papering technique to a model in the future…

       I finally think I understand the true meaning of Chang. It hit me while visiting a park near the forbidden city yesterday, apon entering the park you must pay a fee of 10yuan no big deal I entered and started to look around and see the sights. I wanted to climb up an island in the park lake, there is a white temple on the hill top and I thought there must be a good view. Before entering the island I had to pay another 10yuan fee, now this isn't that big of a deal to pay the money but its the principal of the deal, I felt a bit cheated but got over it as I began ascending the steps to the temples above. The temples were quite beautiful, dark, with an air of peace as the grand golden Buddha smiles down on you from his throne. But when you enter the darkness you soon realize you are not alone, there are vendors in the corners that quickly try to sell you this and that, mostly crap. Strange, you would never find a hot dog vender in a church in the USA... All I could do was shake my head and move on through to the temples further up the slope. So as you reach the summit the view is masked be trees and shrubs, the good news it that there was a look out above like a pagoda type of hang out. Nice but there was a catch, you guessed it, 10yuan, all I could do was laugh, I should have guessed. Its kinda like going to the dollar theater and during the last 10 minutes of the film the movie stops and a fee of 7dollars a head is required for the movie to resume. But what can you do but write about it and turn it into an interesting story...

       A day of playing in the rain. I awoke this morning and the rain was coming down, looking up i could tell that it was not going to let up, so I decieded to have a day in the rain. After eating a bowl of cereal I rented a bike, pulled out my rain gear and entered the bikers world. Soon I was pretty well soaked, the biking here could almost be considered an extreme sport, I mean if your not paying attention you could end up a road pancake. The driving here is similiar to Shanghai, but the bikers are a much differant crowd, they seem to be more educated and of higher class... So I had fun running through the puddles while watching for overly aggresive cabbies and busses not to mention the fellow bike drivers. First stop was the Temple of Heaven, an increddible green park divided down the center by an axis connecting the major architecture.

       Beijing is a strange world. Mostly because I cant figure out what's so strange about it. Seems to be a combination of things. Darkly lit streets that are under construction at night with workers digging and arguing. Tight Hu-tong family blocks lie next to super blocks of enormous buildings full of shopping centers and apartments. The subway has two lines neither are automated. The government buildings of old are of much greater design then current operations.

       In just a couple of words... the wall, it's da shitttt!!! The single most powerful piece of architecture I have ever experienced. The Wall is larger than life, most places I've seen so far have been over hyped up by the photos I've seen. But the wall is truly amazing and could never be done true justice by mere photography. As I arrived at the site I looked up and in the distance you could see the massive wall laying like a sleeping serpent on the ridge of the mountains, in the haze, wonderful. At one point I sat on top of one of the towers and admired the wall disappearing of the hills, had lunch and drew for a bit, so inspiring, I had to pinch myself just to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

       I finally stood overlooking what I had previously only seen in books and magazines, Chinas forbidden City... What the books don't show are the massive crowds of Chinese tourists. It was strange because I had this feeling like all of us tourists there were really disrespecting the place, the city definitely has a way of putting you in your place, and I just did not feel right wandering around taking random pictures of this and that, and the fact that there were thousands of others doing the sane thing just kinda kills the romanticed images I held in my mind. I had a thought that it would be really interesting if china totally rebuilt the whole city using the same design but with modern materials and technologies, and then actually used the buildings as in ancient times. Wow, could be cool, and incredibly powerful.  Maybe that was it, The city is a ghost town, not being used but as a tourist trap seems kinda like a huge waste. It was still amazing just to go though, and imagine the glorious days of the Qing Dynasty, 500 years ago.  Today is the first time that I have felt fully charged in a while. Tomarrow will be the Great Wall!!!

       Arriving safely in Beijing this morning by train and resting all day here at the hostel, this evening I went to a local grocery store and went shopping! I was so happy when I found out that this hostel has a kitchen... I bought a bunch of veggies some really great whole wheat bread and some fruit and so forth. I was so completely satisfied and happy with my dinner, a big fat veggie sandwich some crackers and tomato juice, Ahh, just what I needed, my body was so grateful and I began feeling revitalized at once. I don't think I can handle any more Chinese food. I am ready to visit the forbidden city tomorrow. Wonderful!

       Well the trip here was borderline magical. The train was like stepping into a medicanal caccon. My expectations were low but as I stepped onto the train my worries washed away, quite a modern form of transport, the interior reminded me of a commercial airliner. When I was shone to my cabin I was warmly welcomed by a family of three ladys, two daugters and mother, I would guess that the daugters were 6 and 16... The bed was comfortable the ride was smooth and I was even sung a sweet lulaby by the incredibly cute little chinese girl. I was half delerious throughout the ride with a high fever and strang dreams of foriegn lands sliding this way and that. I was on the top bunk and had a down comforter and pillow, I climbed into my bed and 12 hours later we arived in Beijing. My Fever had broke, I was feeling rather rested and ready to start my new journey.   The computers here at this hostel are much better, windows 2000 and Photoshop so start checking for images because I will start posting them on older posts.

      Ohhhh, wow, I have been sick these last couple of days... nothing so bad as to keep me bed ridden but enough to keep me from doing what I had planned on doing in my last couple of days in Shanghai. I guess it is a cold that has crept up on me from all of the excitment in my life the last couple of weeks... In a way it has been nice to just play it low key here at the hostel but in the back of my mind of corse I am thinking of all that i could be getting done, or seeing what I have not yet seen in the city. I know that the most important thing is that I fully recover from this cold befor i do anything to radical. I just hope that is soon and that at that point I will be healthy for the rest of my stay. Tomarrow night I leave for beijing should be a nice ride, about 20 hours or so by fast train... And hopfully I will be able to post some pictures at the next hostel I am staying at.

      Some of my best times in the city so far have been in its Cafes. From the hotel jazz bar in the Jin Mao at 46 stories up to the little Art Decco Cafe I visited today in the french concession, I enjoy my time in the character rich atmospheres. Using these moments to soak up the scene and write down thoughts in my ugly yellow note book, the air is allways freash and cool the waitstaff is great at your side in a flash and the drinks are usually quite nice and all this makes the time well worth the steep prices, about 5usd a drink or 40chy.

      I continue to ponder the future of "Urban Earth". Shanghai has been a huge wakeup call... I wonder if it is making any real advancments in urbanization, or just turning into a monster of a city. Only time will tell if indeed Shanghai will Bloom or wilt away in its own waste.   On one of the largest digitial screens i have ever seen easily viewed from the bund at night, there flashes the slogen of the reborn city, "A better city for a better tommarow", I guess sofar this hasent quite come to be, life is very hard for the average Shanghainese in my eyes.  Does man inharently create waste?  Is pollution a must in urban centers?  My lifes work lays in the research and creation of mans future citys. I know this now more than ever.

      Taking it easy today, the weather, heavy food and air polution are taking there toll on my body. I awoke this morning with a sore throught (I assume from inhaling all of the crap in the air) Decieded to head over to the Shanghai Musume anyway, and aided by the tempiture swings of the hot city and icy air conditioning within the meusem I started felling feverish and low in energy. The exibits in the meusem however were first rate, many beautiful old artifacts of bronze, jade, ceramics, and coins and paintings and more...  I have decieded that it is about time to move on to my other destinations... Allthough I have not seen everything that Shanghai has to offer I feel that Beijing is calling my name. Many new adventures await me in the northern capitial. Departing saturday night on a soft sleeper train I will arive in Beijing the fallowing morning.

      I have realized that one of the best if not the best things about traveling is meeting all of the wonderful people along the path. I really stick out here in a crowd and this is at the same time a blessing and a curse. Many places I go especialy the markets I feel like i am seen as a walking dollar sign. "Hello! looky looky! DVD, Watch, Friend Looky Looky!!!" On and on and on and on they go and it rarly stops in some areas... But more comenly I am greated with a smile or curious look, little boys will run to me, smile, say hello and then off again to play in the road in thier underpants... this allways makes me smile. Everyone is allways very curious of forieners here because of there rarity, and I allways seem to meet very interesting people with wonderful stories and information to share, In Suzhou I meet several people at random, in a garden, on the train, in starbucks!!! yes even Suzhou has a starbucks, I couldent help but go in and check it out, and what would you know, the same familliar retro feel, the only differance is that the menu is in chinese (and english), it took quite a while for me to find out where the toilet was and when i we finally found someone that knew what I wanted I think pretty much the whole cafe was in on my situation... we all laughed together and for an instant there was no laungage barrier. The state of the toilet once I found it is a differant story, but lets just say that there was nothing to sit on just a   hole in the ground... Oh somehow I seem to have wondered a bit, I have been doing alot of that latly.

       Pronounced "sue-joe" and claims to be one of the most beautiful citys in china, there is an old saying that Suzhou is heaven on earth... (i probable botched that up but you get the jist) Well lets just say that it was nothing like I expected it to be. It is allso said to be the Venice of the east.  So I got up at 4:45 this morning through on some clothes and stepped in to the heat, even at 5 in the morning the city is like an oven... I barly catch my train cause the subway started running later than expected but I make it, so I spend the next hour in the middle of a loud chinese family sucking on little packets of meat (???) and pumken seeds, ocationally having a smoke and hawking something onto a metal tray in front of me. All I can do is laugh to myself... It was ok though cause thier daughter was cute and spoke deicent english, and no she wasent sucking on any mysterious meat packets, ok that just sounds wrong I'll stop now.  Suzhou train station is just outside of town, now by town I mean under 3 million but over 1 because if it was under I think that it would then be considered a village, not sure. So I rent a bike, a heavy old WWII tank of a bike with one gear and no breaks, but the tires were well pumped and it came with a lock so I grabbed it. I stayed with in the city center but that took up quite a bit of area, so I explored A bit befor finding a garden to cruz around in. The name escapes me at the moment but it was absolutly beautiful, traditional style chinese garden I took some pictures so I'll leave the detail up to them...  After exploring some more of the town I found some really interesting old streetscapes with old stone bridges and canals and for a moment I realized why suzhou would be called heaven on earth... I allso found some hibrid buildings old walls with new modern glasswork the combination was clean and well designed I liked it very much.  I guess the highlight of the trip was getting my pocket picked... yes some lucky fello now owns my phone. I thought it to intreging a story to get mad about, well not even much of a story since i dont know exactly when it happened, but anyway im just glad it was not my wallet. So now I have an excuse of why I did not send you all postcards, that is unless you email me your address, please do so.

      I have been thinking of a concept based around the idea of the "fabric of a city". Much of my photography has taken into mind what lays on and lays softly on the more concrete surfaces... As I continue on I really see the relation between a humans clothing and the film of inanamate substance that creats almost an embryo for the human to make the city livable. Most city street facades are hard and flat, the skin that I look into and have been disecting here in Shanghai is what a culture creates as sometimes waste othertimes as commerce (maybe none of this is making sense but it has been needing to come out) and is softer and more quickly changing. So if the architecture is the human body than they give rise to form, the citys skin than becomes a cultural expression, and is worn with daily activities...  This will be the underlying connection for my presintation at the school of architecture upon my return. I am visualizing a silent show of images and words, mostly quotes from this blog.

      It seems that if i find a computer that will except my reader than it will not have imaging software installed, and vise-versa. It is allso hard to get around on the operating system because its all in Chinese...  I have been capturing wonderfull images and hope to share them all with you soon...
