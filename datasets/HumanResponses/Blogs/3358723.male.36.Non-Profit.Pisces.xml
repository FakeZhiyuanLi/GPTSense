      OK, it's a bit melodramatic of a title, but the past month has been...interesting. I'm a single guy, and decided to put my dating life "on hold" (meaning, pickin's are slim). That's when my Russian cutie came in.  (Please note - this note contains  heavy sarcasm  throughout, and should be seen in that light).  She e-mailed me, and sent me a picture - not a bad lookin' woman. Of course, since my bull$h!+ detector is now on overload (and since I could always use a pen pal), I decided to be Mr. Cool and Distant via e-mail.   Of course, three weeks later, the bombshell - she's madly in love with me. Go figure. She even sends me a picture of "herself" in a bikini and says that she has had "sexual dreams" about me. Wondering what in the name of Buddha on a pogo stick is going on, I decided to do some investigating.  Looking through the pictures she had sent, they were all of two to three different women. (I guess she was hoping that the testosterone would flood to my brain and blind me). Thanks to a computer-savvy pal, we figured out that, for a Russian gal, her e-mails all orginated in the US...and that her domain didn't exist. Of course, searching on  urlLink Google  led to an industry of Russian women available...and that I was a soon-to-be victim of a scam.  Of course, my Russian "hottie" has now sent me an e-mail asking for $2400 to purchase the plane ticket, and that she now has a visa, a picture of which she sent to me. (Trying to get a tourist/business visa in Russia is like trying to locate a funny show starring McLean Stevenson that isn't M.A.S.H.) I told her that, in the next few weeks, I would be visiting  her .  Watch this space for updates!

      This past weekend, I took a little trip to the  urlLink President's Casino , as part of an activity with  urlLink Metropolis . It was one of those "you have to do it once in your life" kind of deals, much like an excursion to a strip club when I was younger.  It's interesting to see other people make the casino part of their Saturday night - on the whole, I spent two hours and fifteen minutes at the casino, and one hour and fifty of that was in the buffet talking to some friends about  urlLink Kevin Smith movies . After that, it's a multicolored, loud, gaudy experience - much like a Hawaiian shirt with Day-Glo paint spilled on it. Ended up tripling my money - spent $20, and won about $70 playing blackjack. (However, the highlight was watching a now-former friend play the "I-don't-like-you-anymore-so-I'm-going-to-visibly-ignore-you" game. It was almost like being in 7th grade again, it was so sweet).  Of course, given that I work for a substance abuse-related agency, I just had to take a good look at the poker bar - that's right, you can gamble  and  consume large amounts of alcohol at the same time. Get all of your compulsive behaviors taken care of at once. (I didn't play, though - after a few rounds of blackjack, I heeded the man's advice, and knew when to hold 'em, and when to fold 'em).  My biggest, most hazardous stunt this weekend? Watching  Weekend at Bernie's , acquiring through ordering a  urlLink Papa John's pizza . Nothing like enjoying the wacky shenanigans of a dead guy to liven up one's weekend.

      Well, last night was the big  urlLink Enterprise  season finale, and as a hardcore Trekker, I was seriously disappointed.  Ya gotta understand - I was brought up on the original Trek; heck, it was one of the few things that my father and I actually agreed upon. (We both beat out Mom in the Kirk vs. Picard argument). I don't own a Starfleet Uniform, nor do I attend conventions, but I actually like Trek, which was one of the few shows that treated you like you were semi-intelligent.   Maybe the fact that I had watched the  Deep Space 9   series closer, "What You Leave Behind". It was - and is - one of the few pieces of television that actually moved me to tears. Well-written characters, a great sense of ending plot, and (surprisingly) an almost cliche-free ending. It was uneven in places, and didn't wrap everything up in a totally nice bow...but it was a moving tribute to the cast and crew who worked on the show.  (For the record - TNG's series ender was merely a setup for the movie franchise, and  Voyager ...well, more on that later).   Enterprise , on the other hand, seemed to be lackluster, and even sprung a trick ending that was even more confusing than the twist of Tim Burton's  Planet of the Apes . Wow, would the earth survive? Well, given that the show occurs about 100 years before the original series...wow, what a twist!  The end formally began with  Voyager  - what started out as a unique premise quickly turned into a mass of cliches, unoriginality (hey, let's trot out the Borg!), obvious pandering (what else explains Jeri Ryan's woodenness in Voyager, but her all-out humanity in  Boston Public , and don't give me no "she was reclaiming her humanity" stuff).   However,  Enterprise's  main challenge has been working in a climate where even greater strides have been made. Want an example of extended story arcs?  Babylon 5  started it (albeit awkwardly) and  Buffy  strengthened it. Want unique science-fiction creatures and storytelling?  Farscape  Want something a little more, er, "edgy"?  Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda  (Which, ironically, came from a failed Trek proposal, along with some of Roddenberry's other notes). In a climate where greater creative strides are being made, instead of leading the pack,  Enrerprise  is following...and eventually, seems more like a cookie-cutter version of Trek than the real thing.  Maybe, in the end, that's the key - TOS, TNG, and DS9 were (somewhat) influenced by a single vision, before  Star Trek  became  The Franchise . It used to be about telling unique stories about the human condition - about how, as we reach for the stars, we learn more about ourselves. Sadly, it seems, both  Voyager  and  Enterprise  have boiled the vision down to base elements, as if having a person with pointy ears and green blood makes it valid and real, rather than exploring the character behind the traits.  Somewhere, out there, Gene Roddenberry is weeping...

      Right now, I'm in the midst of a lot of stuff at work - reviewing grant applications, training tobacco merchants on state law, yes, it sounds like an exciting, glamorous life. During times like these, I want my reading simple, to-the-point, and lacking pretension, which is why I pretty much devoured Bruce Campbell's autobiography,  If Chins Could Kill , in one Sunday afternoon.  Have to admit, I enjoy the guy's work, but wouldn't consider myself a fan - really liked  Brisco County, Jr. , enjoyed  Army of Darkness , wouldn't turn off  Xena  or  Hercules  when he was on it...but I'm not religious about the guy. However, after reading his book, I'm gonna be adding some movies to my  urlLink Netflix  list.  Unlike many celebrity biographies, this isn't your typical tell-all, bring-those-skeletons-outa-the-closet-and-make-'em-dance book. It's actually a simple story about a hard working guy who enjoys what he does, and who just seems...well, normal. He's the kind of guy you'd want to hang out with, and his book reflects that, and provides some interesting insight into the world of relatively lower budget filmmaking  If you haven't already, either check it out of your library and/or purchase a copy from your local indie bookstore. (Hey, the guy deserves his royalties). It's written in a deceptively pretension-lacking style, and won't make your head hurt. Trust me - my brain, right now, feels like I've watched about 48 hours of  Charles in Charge  non-stop, and Mr. Campbell's book helped clear it up, if only for a little while.  And no, I don't get any royalties, so you have no excuse. Buy it. Read it. Believe it.

      I have to admit that I am a total comic book fanboy, much more than, say,  urlLink Kevin Smith , and when I opened that issue of  JLA , and heard the news...well, let's just say I'm a little peeved.  It seems that John Byrne, who had his glory days years ago, and who has done some really good stuff in the recent past (including various  Generations  mini-series that are real-time stories of Superman and Batman), wants to revive  urlLink The Doom Patrol ...but unfortunately, his revamp cuts out years of established continuity.  Now, I admit, I may be taking this a little  too  personally - after all, Doom Patrol (especially reprints of the 1960s comic in little digests) were my teenage faves. (I discovered them through the New Teen Titans). This is not as distressing as, say, when Arnold Schwartzenegger announced that he was going to play  urlLink Doc Savage , one of my childhood idols, but...Byrne still writes like it's the 1980s (in my opinion), and unfortunately, no one has bothered to remind him that it's not the 1990s...  Continuity, ah, the fanboy's conundrum. Used well, it really helps gives cohesion to stories, and can provide elements which writers can use (such as  Star Trek: Deep Space 9 , which I'll blog about at a later date). Used poorly, it becomes an excuse for bad writing (which is why I commend Russell T Davies, producer of the new BBC  urlLink  Doctor Who   series - he's asking everyone to keep an open mind, and wants to tell good continuity-less stories. However, unless you're doing a total revamp (like  Buffy the Vampire Slayer , which went from crappy Luke Perry film to kick-butt action series), you need to accommodate history, especially if it's well-established. Nothing wrong with taking chances - and there is a creative way to reconcile it (e-mail me for details), but (again, in my opinion) Byrne's revamp of the Doom Patrol smacks slightly of ego - he is doing it merely because he  can . I'll give it a try, but simply put, it may be more  Voyager  than  DS9 .  In other news, just got some good books to read, including  Reefer Madness  (by the same guy who brought you  Fast Food Nation ), and Bruce Campbell's  If Chins Could Kill . And they say literacy is dead in America...

      OK, first, for the two of you who are interested - look for a new "Open Mike" on  urlLink Aantares.com . It'll be a gas, or something.  Also, it looks like  urlLink Yahoo is increasing its storage size  in response to  urlLink Google's new service .   Although I switched to  urlLink Fastmail  years ago (its paid options are a bargain compared to Yahoo), I occasionally use  urlLink Yahoo Pops  to archive my e-mail.  But great - more storage on Yahoo for spam, porn, and just plain unwanted e-mail. Yippie-ki-yay!

      First, some sad news - a good female friend of mine may be moving to Las Vegas. I'm happy for her, but will really miss lusting after her behind her back. If you want one night of magic - and you know who you are - give me a call on my cell phone. :)  Anyway, here's a great reason to be alive -  Monty Python's Life of Brian  is being rereleased, and it is showing at a really cool local theater. (It reminds me of the Brighton Theater in Chicago, before it got torn down for a  urlLink Walgreen's . Anyway, it will be good - after all the hype of Mel Gibson's  Passion , I think that good Christians everywhere need a good laugh. Plus, you just can't beat "Biggus Dickus" for a sleazy laugh.  In other news, and I'll have to get one of those blog listing thingies,  urlLink Andy Kaufman faked his own death, apparently . First thing he should do - find out why  urlLink  Enterprise   was renewed.

      Right now, I have just been mega-busy; merchant education trainings, keeping up with regular paperwork, coalition updates, -sometimes, I just need to keep my humor very simple and mindless.  I've been really digging  Come Poop with Me , the CD/DVD by  urlLink Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog . (OK, his 15 minutes will soon be up - I bought it used for $10. It isn't Voltaire, but has its moments, especially the back-and-forth between Triumph and Blackwolf, the Dragonmaster, who (sadly, now) seems to be in on the joke).  Not everyone's cup of tea, but definitely R-rated. In other listening news, like Bruce McCullough, I've been finding the soundtrack to  Shaft  (by Isaac Hayes) very sexy indeed. Thanks to my pal Ajay for selling this to me at his garage sale.

      Luckily, I'm too cheap to afford cable, but not a subscription to  urlLink Netflix  - luckily, I have been catching up on two of my faves,  urlLink Penn and Teller , and their new show,  Bull$h!+ .  I'm a big P & T fan; I'm the only other person who's seen their movie,  Penn & Teller Get Killed ; saw them live at the then re-opened Chicago theater (featuring Mofo, the Psychic Gorilla), and just dig 'em. They uncover scams, bad science, and other stuff. It's half laugh-out-loud funny, and half serious "What in the name of Christ on a pony is going on here?"  My personal fave bit: a demonstration on how to "fake" chiropractic science on a cat. Now, that's what I want to do - my own show on cable. Anyone out there wanna be a cohost?  Gordon

      This is just part of my morning ritual - get some coffee, sign online, check e-mail, and rant...  Luckily, I keep a personal journal - that way, I don't inadvertantly embarrass myself, and can just dump into a plain ol' computer file.  Spoke with Mom last night- she and Shrek (aka, my dad) are going to Vegas, and she asked what I wanted. Fighting the temptation to say, "For you to regain your sanity," I opted for 1) a deck of cards from a casino; 2) something Star Trek from STAR TREK: THE EXPERIENCE (as long as it wasn't Kate Mulgrew) or 3) 90% of her gambling winnings. (Of course, there's not much you  can  do with 90 cents). Hopefully, she'll have fun - she deserves it.  Finally, to add to my list of "projects that, maybe, one day, I'll get off my dead butt and get to" - revising my  urlLink home page  when I switch internet providers. There's something about it that says, "Sad fanboy". Please feel free to read and make comments. I could use the feedback

      You know, sometimes, a guy can't win...  I am having a serious love/hate relationship with  urlLink Ain't It Cool News!  , the movie "spoiler"/news site. I'm sure that Harry Knowles has much more to worry about - after all, I bet people say dumb things to him like, "You realize your name sounds like a skin rash, doesn't it?" But anyway, his site...ooh, it's starting to bug me royally. What bugs me about it?  1) Hey, here's a lesson in Web Development 101 - even with DSL, your pages shouldn't take forever to download. Cut down the graphics, the ads, etc, and make sure we can get to the meat of it!  2) OK, this is a "Hello, pot, this is kettle" moment - guys, these are only frickin' movies. Tone it down on the message boards - or, at the very least,learn how to have a decent argument. Or, if you need a time out, visit that web site with the  urlLink guy in the chicken suit  - that should help calm you down.  3) You know, there is a thin line between discussing rumor and the "I heard from this guy who was the roommate of the cousin of the guy who glazed the donuts on the first Michael Keaton Batman movie" phenomenon. Learn the difference.  4) Is it just me, or did you find the series finale of THE PRACTICE ultra-mega-lame? I mean, having William Shatner say "Denny Crane" for the entire episode would have been much more entertaining, doncha think?  Come on, guys on Ain't It Cool - just these few things, and you can redeem yourselves. If not, so help me God, Ben Browder and I will come to your house to school you over and eat popcorn...and we're fresh outa popcorn.....  My apologies - I lost my mind for a moment. Now, if anyone knows someone who can send me Svengoolie tapes (both classic and the newest episodes) from Chicago, let me know. I'll even spring for good videotapes, not the cheapo dollar store ones.  Thanks for letting me share,  Your pal, Gordon

      Just two things that I wanted to say, politically -  First, if you're conservative - or just like smart, political insight, then sign up for my pal Mark Kilmer's  urlLink Right Sided Newsletter . Even if you're a dyed-in-the-wool liberal like me, it's great, entertaining reading.  Also, having finished acting as a stakeholder for  urlLink Advance St. Louis , I wanted to make our  urlLink recommendations  available for anyone who wanted to read it. (Also, if I was a tool of "the man", I want to know where the heck is my kickback check! I need to buy my cat a new litter box, darnit!)  Thanks for letting me share, Gordon

      Recently, I was in Chicago and watched  Ebert & Roeper , which does for movie reviews what Stalin did for family picnics. Anyway, in a blatant attempt to replace Mr. Roeper (which would give me a great excuse to fly to Chicago and visit my family on a regular basis), here are two movie reviews - one for a movie in general release, one for a DVD release - both are documentaries, but won't bore the heck out of you.  The first is  urlLink  Super Size Me  , which is about the fast food industry and its impact on our health. It starts with a simple premise - the director will eat only McDonald's for 30 days, and sounds like something from Michael Moore's reject pile. However, this film makes some serious points, suggesting that the fast food industry engages in a "get-'em-while-they're-young" strategy, much like the tobacco industry. It's almost like a movie version of Eric Schlosser's  Fast Food Nation , and is - almost ironically - a primer in addictions. (I defy you to watch the director partake in his dangerous diet and  not  flinch, or mentally talk back to the screen). This is definitely a must-see....  For a documentary of a different type, check out  urlLink Gigantic , a documentary about They Might Be Giants. Unlike most rock documentaries, this doesn't reflect the rags-to-riches-to-drugs-to-comeback cycle. It's simply about two guys who enjoy making music - it's that simple. It's a great, entertaining film some really cool music...and the DVD is chock full of features. So many, in fact, that it justifies watching repeatedly...or just take the plunge and buy it - it's well worth seeing over and over, even if you're not a big TMBG fan.  Thanks for reading!

      Hello, everyone -   This is one of my attempts to be a self-published, and to develop a 2nd (or even primary) career as a writer. Whether you've enjoyed my "Adventures in Maturity" in the Shrubbery, or my "Open Mikes" on the Prodigy Comedy Community and/or Aantares.com, this is a place for me to expound, maybe just post some random thoughts, and use as a site for inspiration.

      Thanks to a really nasty case of dehydration (following an intensive end to a work project), I was able to watch more DVDs than a human being should in one weekend. (Of course, between Netflix and the library, it's a wonder I get anything done...)  Anyway, here goes:   Doctor Who: The Two Doctors   - I wasn't a big fan when this story was first shown in America, but watching the DVD, I actually enjoyed it. Patrick Troughton and Colin Baker have a great chemistry, and although it's no  Talons of Weng-Chiang , this is probably Robert Holmes' last gasp of greatness.   61*  - I have never really liked Billy Crystal, except for  Analyze This , and so I wasn't sure how to take this baseball movie he directed. Needless to say, it's an instant classic, focusing on the 1961 Yankees. This is one of those guy movies that women can enjoy. (Gee, is that patronizing or what?)   A Man For All Seasons  - this would be the last film that I would expect would be an influence on  urlLink Kevin Smith , but in two hours, it deals with so many issues of religion vs. the state...and shows why Leo McKown was the best number 2 on  urlLink  The Prisoner  .  These are all really cool, and if the new releases at Blockbuster are all checked out...you have alternates!

      First, I have to admit - I love comics. Had started as a kid with three books (Superman, X-Men, and Hawkman), remember the three-coverless-in-a-plastic-baggie-for-29-cents package deal, and fell back in love during the  Watchmen/Dark Night/Crisis on Infinite Earths  revival. Yes, I read "literature", but I also really enjoy graphic literature...and right now, I am still in semi-shock over how good comics have become.  I am talking about the first issue of the well-hyped  urlLink  Identity Crisis  mini-series by DC. Brad Meltzer (who wrote the book) has created a really cool mystery featuring super heroes. (For those of you who aren't familiar with his work - and I suggest you do so - he has a very clean, very gripping style - in short, like John Grisham with talent). This is the kind of comic you want to give friends to show them not just that comics aren't for kids...but that the best writing isn't necessarily in prose.  It's hard to discuss without spoiling, but I will give it a shot - it begins with two heroes on patrol, with great back-and-forth dialogue that you don't find in comic books (and slightly reminiscent of James Robinson's  Starman ). The story progresses in snapshots of time - between "now" and selected fragments from "now". Ultimately, 2/3 of the way into the book, we see the first sign of a mystery - a corpse.  The deceased...several people have commented on how inappropriate/cheesy/unnecessary the death is...which I think is Mr. Meltzer's intention. If he had killed off, say, Crazy Quilt (a bottom-tier villain), it would not have the kick-in-the-gut resonance that it does. It then goes into the investigation, a funeral...and then one of the best, couldn't-see-it-coming cliffhangers that I have ever experienced. (Having read issue one about 4 times, it  still  crackles and surprises).   Kudos also to Rags Morales - I've always been a fan of his DC art (in both  Hourman  and  Hawman ), and here, his art is really crisp and allows the heroes to shine at the forefront. (My only quibble - his Metal Men don't seem all that impressive; but hey, it's only the first issue). His art serves to compliment the plot: here, the heroes seem both larger-than-life and human all at the same time.  In short, this comic has done what very few comics have done for a long time - make me wish the days would go by faster, so that I could pick up the next issue. (And shame to Marvel for putting out the amazingly sucky  Identity Disc  at the same time - that book is a crime against nature). There are very few pleasures left in this world...thank God  Identity Crisis  is one of them.

      I have to admit, I didn't really get into the Ramones until college (hearing "Rock & Roll High School" at the occasional HS dance notwithstanding), but I got a little chill when I heard that urlLink  Johnny Ramone had cancer .  It is kind of strange - Joey contracts lymphoma, Dee Dee dies of a heroin overdose a year later, and the third crucial "brudder" is going down (but not without a fight). It's also funny, because I just watched  urlLink  Rock and Roll High School   again for...well, I bought the DVD used for ten dollars. It is not only a great pastiche of 50's "rock is the enemy" movies, but is probably one of the best rock films of all time...at the very least, the best film Timothy Van Patten has ever starred in. There's some datedness to the film, but it is proof that Roger Corman -who wanted to initially do "Disco High" - could be talked into a better, even lower-budget, idea.  It's easy to ignore the sheer brattiness and genius of the Ramones - after all, juvenile song subjects over a grinding 4/4 beat sounds, well, dumb. However, not only in context, but even now, with cookie cutter punk bands prevalent, it sounds like a well needed breath of fresh air. They never did disco mixes, or rap tracks, or even high concept albums (unless you count  urlLink  Acid Eaters  , their covers album). They were always about hey, ho, let's go, and no song lasted more than two minutes, making their CDs a bargain.  Also, many conservatives (maybe even my good friend  urlLink Mark K  don't realize that Johnny was a very staunch conservative and an articulate spokesman. (Coming from a leftie pinko liberal like myself, that's quite...something) Yes, it's hard to believe that in a realm of leftist values, here was a rocker who could speak on conservative issues who didn't come across as, well, crazy. (And yes, I'm talking about Ted Nugent).  Hard to believe they're gone...I wanted them around for my kids to play, so that they could drive their old man.  In tribute, the only words I have to say are...gabba gabba hey!

      A change of pace - a note that's more personal than critical or looking at the outside world.  The above is the title of one of my favorite songs by  urlLink Graham Parker . In recent times, I've been wondering "why am I doing what I am doing? Am I just engaging in insane behavior - doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result"  In the past few days, the answer has hit me - from other people - and it's  passion .  Passion is something lacking in our culture - irony, cynicism, distance, detachment, postmodernism are all prevalent. Our culture reinforces the idea that if we believe in something strongly, we have somehow "sold out to the Man".  Well, there is no "Man". Or "Woman". Things just are the way they are - it is tough to be passionate about something that may not pay well, or where great sacrifice is necessary. But somehow, it all seems worth it - it is as if passion can provide the motivation to move forward. It makes every fight, every argument, every dealing with a difficult person meaningful, and helps build towards a greater good.  Thanks for letting me share.

      One of my first posts back in may was about   Yahoo increasing their storage size , and so here's my first follow-up blog. Hooray for me!  Of course, I still stand behind my words, and I checked my e-mail this morning. Although Yahoo Pops! no longer works with it (and I'll have to see if I can still pop my mail), it's a slightly less appealing interface...and my SBC account has two GB storage.  Wow, just think - they could have done this all along...

      Sometimes, you come across something in your youth - a favorite record, a book, a film - that makes you reflect as an adult. You learn some new aspect and then you realize there was a much greater richness, greater sacrifice, than you previously thought.  Case in point:  urlLink The Smothers Brothers .  My mother had most of their mid-1960's albums -  Think Ethnic, Greatest Hits Vol. 2, Mom Always Liked You Best  - and, like her Beatles, Bill Cosby, and other 1960s records, I listened to them voraciously. I always liked the Smothers - two brothers who had an unusual give-and-take on folk music. (Kind of like George and Gracie, only a little more hip). As a child, I always dug some of their best, most off-kilter lines, like   "There were pumas in that crevasse!" "I don't like cream of asparakeet!" "My brother, super-sibling Dickie, put termites in my Lincoln Logs" "My old man's a refrigerator repairman, whaddaya think about  that ?"  Tommy served as "buffoon" to his brother, Dick (who, for my money, is a fine example of the Bob Newhart/Jack Benny school of comedians - keep a straight face and let everyone else get the laugh). For those of you who wish to sample, purchase a copy of Rhino's compilation,  urlLink Sibling Revelry . It's too bad Rhino is now Warner's de facto reissue label; we won't get a volume 2 with "My Old Man", "The Fox" and "Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair", but the CD is well worth the cost.  Recently, I caught  urlLink Smothered  which focused on their censorship battles with their 1967 - 1969 CBS show. After watching it (and strongly considered illegally taping off of of DVD), I have to say that now, their comedy resonates even more strongly...because now I realize that they didn't just use humor to entertain, but they made an honest effort to use it to change the world.  The documentary is just the right length (90 minutes), and seems to hit all the familiar marks. (The whole brouhaha starts with one sketch about censors being censored, features a Democratic president who didn't like the show, and devolves into a one man vs. the  network fight. However, what shines through isn't that the Smothers were ground breakers in delivering social satire on television...but that, even now, they are still quite clever and smart. (Unlike reruns of Laugh-In, which show it to be dated and too fixed in their time). For example, in one clever juxtaposition, two classic Smothers routines combine into a statement on race relations, bigotry, and acceptance. The tone of the documentary is casual, but what is revealed isn't about the nature of censorship...but of the power of humor.  It's a question of growing up - it's not about leaving the recklessness of youth behind, but being able to temper that anti-establishment spirit with a good dose of maturity and intelligence. Or, in other words, knowing who needs to hear "**** you" and how to say it well.  And for that, we need to thank Tom and Dick. They may only do yo-yo tricks now, but considering what they started...it's well worth it.

      Since today is a national day of mourning for President Reagan's death, and since most of my work contacts are off, I'm pretty much stuck in front of the computer...so I thought I would engage in this little activity first posted on my friend and fellow science-fiction enthusiast   urlLink Brian's blog .

      You know, maybe I'm becoming cynical (or a bad stand-up comic), but I am just a wee bit tired of reality shows...  Ok, I admit, I got a little hooked on  The Apprentice  (OK, the season finale), but it just seems a little...well, futile. Recently, here in St. Louis, we had a call for  Average Jane  - that's right,  Average Joe  with a woman as the "central interest." Between that and the improbably titled  Who Will Marry My Dad?   Personally, if you are going to do reality, do it right - do a day in the life of the President of the United States. Do the training room at my office at lunch time (trust me, it is laugh-out-loud funny). Do something educational, or uplifting.  Unfortunately, most "reality" shows are just as contrived as their fictional cousins. Let's face it - in real life, do you think Donald Trump would just call someone into his office and say, "You're fired"? Or, if set out in the wild, be able to bring one "special" object?  It's times like this that make me glad I have a library card...and that I'm too cheap to get cable, but can easily afford  urlLink Netflix

      Or,  Another Way To Spend a Saturday Afternoon...   Just finished watching the soon-to-be classic  urlLink  School of Rock  , and this movie, well, rocks. It's hard to believe that Jack Black and Richard Linklater could make a movie that is 1) so incredibly mainstream, 2) so sweet, and 3) gives such a cool counterculture message.  You all know the plot - Jack Black's a failed rocker, he becomes a substitute teacher, and he encourages his class to develop their hidden talents. First, props to these kids - they got talent, and none of them engage in "movie cute" behaviors. There are also so many ways that this movie could have gone wrong...and didn't. It's pretty much entertainment for the whole family, without being cloying, annoying, or sugary. You can see the plot points a-comin' at times, but somehow, the cast and crew managed to make them work towards its advantage.  Definitely one of those movies that I'll own on DVD (hey, the pitch to Led Zeppelin for "The Immigrant Song" is worth the price of admission..)

      I have to admit that, on the look of things, it seems unusual - after all, I'm not really in the acting/writing profession (unless you count my numerous attempts at trying to write). So when I heard about some improv workshops as part of the St. Louis Fringe Festival through  urlLink Ed Reggi , I engaged in my semi-regular hobby of attending improv classes.  You would think that a Chicago boy would have taken said classes through  urlLink Second City , but I never had the courage (or the money). Again, I'm just a community development/substance abuse/civically-minded guy: why take a class - albeit, cool - on short form improv?  Because...it's probably the safest form of play on the planet. It's a confidence builder that only involves threatening the imagination - no worries about bumps, bruises, or broken bones. It's about being able to mentally turn on a dime, on earning trust with another person, about doing the invisible dance of turning nothing into a symphony of action, motion, and laughter.   The stage acts as a laboratory, as a safe way to engage in hairpin turns. As an added bonus, it allows for creativity on the job, clearing out the mental cobwebs, and just allows for pure fun - entertainment for its own sake. A high that almost never gives out, and a few moments of joy in an otherwise overstructured world.

      You know, some things come when I least expect them, but are very pleasant when I receive them. The attention of a beautiful woman, the affection of my cat...and my regular issue of  urlLink The Big Takeover .   The Big Takeover  is a music fanzine, but it's not your typical rag like Rolling Stone or Spin, or even Blender (which does for music criticism what Charles Manson did for Beatles music). It's an intelligent, half-yearly (almost yearly) compendium of all that is hip and happening in music. It's subtitle is "Music With Heart", and that's precisely what this magazine is about. It opposes a statement made by one of my favorite musicians, Graham Parker, who declared,  "I have seen the future of rock...and it sucks!!!"   But what makes it great is not the editorials by Jack Rabid (who is one of the most intelligent, insightful individuals I have ever read), or even the value for the money (tons of interviews and reviews). It's the philosophy - to give you an idea, issue 54 (currently out) focuses on  Modest Mouse Pernice Brothers Killing Joke Rocket from the Tombs Poster Children Weirdos The Mekons Jim DeRogatis TSOL Leatherface Undertones Greg Dulli The Zombies Stereolab (featured on the cover!)  This magazine, in a non-nostalgic way, takes me back to high school, when I would head to Kroozin Music in Chicago (now gone) and just browse the racks, finding some obscure treasure...or just something that I had never heard before. In a time when modern music is oriented towards pushing product, towards moving units, this is always a timely reminder that music (like much of life) is always best when it comes from the finest parts of ourselves.  So head to the website, check out the sample articles, and subscribe. Tell them you were referred from me - I don't get a kickback, other than the joy of bring a hidden treasure to light.

      This morning, I had a feeling I shouldn't go into work - that I should just have stayed home, drank coffee, and just enjoyed a rainy day. Unfortunately, I didn't have any comp time, my vacation's already booked, and I couldn't think of a good sick day excuse. My call into work would have been really lame, something like,   "Hi, it's Gordon. I can't come into the office today - I have the disease Ali McGraw had in  Love Story "   It didn't help that, this past week, my office had been "cleaned out" due to rain flooding. Although the initial flood happened on the 4th of July, we were told that the roofers had "fixed" the problem. After the second time, and having to endure huge, noisy, industrial-strength dehumidifiers, I thought it was safe to go back. This morning, my office - as well as the two offices beside me - were flooded  again .  Admittedly, much of my time in the office has been spent helping prepare for a huge conference next weekend, as well as several smaller projects - nothing as major as the conference, and even that, I had copied the Power Point presentation onto diskette and writing notes on hard copy. Having been an "exile" from my office due to meetings, noise, etc, I was looking forward to a long day of, well, doing small work and goofing off. Maybe even getting my stats in early, and then leaving...or even writing another chapter or two (I'm two and a half chapters in - yay for me!)  Unfortunately, the damage is great - there is a huge tarf running from the roof of my office, and the water is flowing into one of those huge carriers. The kind of Rubbermaid carrier that you use to carry loads of laundry. Yes, it was  that  much water. And, of course, the only work area that was available was the computer & work area in the front of the office...so much for privacy.  Luckily, our executive director was going around, and (obviously) he was not too happy about matters - one of the offices hit was our main prevention secretary; the other was a director's office, and several key documents were destroyed. In addition, two computers were wet, meaning that they would have to be replaced. (My only real "loss" was a copy of  Guerilla Publicity , but if someone wants to purchase a replacement as a gift, please be my guest).   When our executive director asked me what kind of car I wanted (read: we're going to get everything that was damaged replaced), I quickly answered, "A '76 Cadillac...black with red interior."  (Aka, the car I learned to drive in). When he said that he wanted to get me a new car, and announced an Escalade, I asked, "Can I have some bling-bling with that?"  I know, nothing sadder than a guy tryin' too hard to be hip.  Right now, I'm trying to decide between a happy hour, meeting some other friends, laundry, and/or sleep - it's been that kind of week, folks. Even if I don't make anything tonight, there's tomorrow night's benefit concert.  Some days, I really regret not becoming an accountant, like my dad wanted.

      Just some upcoming events & opportunities to "Pay It Forward".  ( Please Note:   In the interests of full disclosure, I either know and/or am involved with several of the events posted. Just want to keep it honest, folks )    First, Boys and Girls Town of Missouri is having a really cool event at Harry's on Clayton on August 9th, as well as a golf tournament in late September. (I'll be attending a meeting in University City on the 9th). For more information, head to the  urlLink BGTM web site )   Something a little sooner - this Saturday, July 31st, at 7:00 pm, there will be benefit concert for the Missouri Budget Project, which committed to making sure that state fiscal policy helps low to moderate income households. The concert, featuring the band  urlLink Old Man Joe , will be held at Off Broadway on Lemp. (Click  urlLink here  for a map). It's 10 bucks, and will be my last hurrah before I move into the Milennium for a conference.   The Penrose O'Fallon Family Initiative (whose board I just joined) is in dire straits. As in "Klingons are surrounding the Enterprise, Scotty's totally bugnuts, and phasers are offline" kind of straits. If you know of any funding/other 501c3 resources, please e-mail me. Or, feel free to come to our next board meeting, Tuesday, August 24th, at 6:00 pm - click  urlLink here  for the location).   Finally, on Monday, November 1st, please head down to Arnold, MO for lunch and/or dinner. It's the day their smoke-free ordinance goes into effect, and we wouldn't want them to lose business.     Thanks for your help, and for reading!

      Last night, I ended up giving testimony in Ballwin for smoke free legislation as part of my  urlLink job . My experiences in Arnold (read  urlLink here   and  urlLink here ) had, I thought, prepared me for whatever would happen. Not even a musty office, and six hours straight (!) of work-related meetings would deter me. I was ready to roll.  Of course, the first rule of advocacy is  leave your expectations at the door .  The meeting began with the Mayor announcing that they were changing the format, and allowing for public comment before discussing the legislation. Luckily, several people in favor of smokefree legislation were there...but the opponents were there, and they quickly drew blood.  At times, it got nasty - as one person left, someone shouted, "Don't start your car in the parking lot." People openly grumbled, defied the mayor's "no applause" policy, and then began asserting that their rights were being violated. I always find it a little more than ironic when asserting their rights somehow means trampling on the rights of their opposition. Of course, I gave testimony - normally, I get a little nervous before speaking in public, but can shake it off. However, last night seemed different, and I was  extremely  nervous. I managed to get my facts out, and then sat down.  Of course, the night was not without its more humorous aspects - at one point, an older gentleman carrying a briefcase approached the council. He was a retired pharmacist, and proposed that since the Library of Congress did research into secondhand smoke, and had to truthfully testify before their congressman, that they were right in that secondhand smoke was not harmful. (Trust me, I am  not  making this up). In addition, a young lady who worked at a very popular restaurant on Ballwin brought all sorts of kids' drawings, proving once again that family friendly = tobacco friendly.  The interesting point of the night was that a gentleman from Arnold - the one who presented a ton of reports to the Arnold City Council - gave testimony (and documents) to the Ballwin City Council. Amazingly, for an ordinance that does not go into effect until November 1st, Arnold is already a vast economic wasteland. This gentleman also, after the meeting, attempted to attack my resources, even after I calmly (but firmly) debunked his information. The city council chose to revisit the discussion in their August meeting; three aldermen were ready to go, three others had reservations, and that's all right - it just provides more preparation time.  Quite frankly, it always surprises me that there is so much venom in the pro-smoking movement, and that it comes out so broadly. Granted, it is funded by an industry that doesn't want to lose profits...but it's also a little disconcerting. Disagreement is one thing, but character attacks are simply unwarranted. (Plus, admittedly, recent events have me gunshy about taking public stances of  any  kind).   What's the lesson , I always ask myself. Maybe it's learning how to develop a thicker skin; maybe it's realizing that more people need to speak up...or maybe there is no lesson. Just things that happen.  At the very least, thanks to our staff meeting raffle, I now have free dinner for two at Cracker Barrel. Please e-mail if interested.

      Oh, boy, some fun things to reflect on as this Monday draws to a  close...    First, thanks to this weekend's rain (and less-than-satisfactory work from our roofers), my office was damp, musty, and smelled like the inside of a worn sweatsock.   According to news,  urlLink the creator of Babylon 5 wrote a treatment for a Star Trek series.  Unfortunately, the best Trek is coming out of this  urlLink really cool fan site    Just began reading  Reefer Madness ,and so far, so good.   This past weekend, I managed to see Liz Phair live in concert, and took the time to watch both  Blade  movies with Wesley Snipes. Nothin' like watching ol' Wes kick vampire butt   Gave testimony in Ballwin about smoke-free legislation, to be blogged later (I am kinda tired, and need to get my beauty rest); and    I completely rock at playing Uno.

      OK, so it's been an emotionally ragged week, I have to prepare to give testimony in Ballwin on Monday for legislation, and what does a boy do?   Take up a pal's offer to see Liz Phair at the Riversplash concert series.   First, have to admit that I was one of the first on my block to own  urlLink Exile in Guyville &nbsp;- of course, Chicago in the early 90's was happening, with bands like Urge Overkill (who overdid the we-love-Neil-Diamond schtick) and Smashing Pumpkins (not one of my faves - hardcore Replacements/Husker Du man). The production was, well, tinny (it  was  an indie record). Live, she just...you would never have thought that she got married, divorced, had a child, and recorded several albums between then and now.  What was  more  impressive was the St. Louis riverfront being used as an entertainment venue. The show, and the laser/water/fireworks extravaganza were all really top notch, but the most impressive was that, for the first time (that I remember), St. Louis actually used one of its assets. It reminded me of Chicago using Navy Pier and the lake shore - it was just one of those "why-the-heck-didn't-we-think-of-that" before moments that make one glad to live in the Lou.  Now, if we can only develop holographic technology to hide the garish Casino Queen across the river, we would be set...

      Just a little something that was, at the time, laugh-out-loud  funny; hopefully, I can share it appropriately.   Two days ago, Quentin visited us at our office - we do a lot  of work with youth, and Quentin is considered a "successful  graduate." He's one of those individuals who proves that you  can overcome any obstacle in order to achieve what you wish.   He had visited during lunch, and with me being the only 1) male  and 2) under-40 person at the table, it took a lot to keep  quiet. Quentin was talking to the lunch crowd about his dietary  habits, and how he really loves McDonalds. He also claimed he was  "getting old" (read: 20), and that he couldn't handle White  Castle hamburgers anymore.  Cut to the chase: during the course of this conversation, Quentin announced that if his girlfriend smelled like a McDonald's french fry, he would "never leave her again." In fact, he stated that "the perfume companies would make a killing;  instead of CK, you have McDonald's French Fry." We then talked about the various permutations - Domino's pizza for men, new pick up lines like, "Hey baby, I'm wearing... Quarter Pounder with Cheese."  Just a little humor to lighten everyone's day.

      In the past few days, several of my friends have been giving me some great advice, which I would like to share. I will not identify them, but they know who they are.     "If you are not making mistakes, it means that you're not being  &nbsp;productive or doing anything of value"      (From Aristotle) - "If you want to avoid criticism, say nothing.  Do nothing. Be nothing."      "In the end, your friends like you, your enemies hate&nbsp;you, and it's all  &nbsp;irrelevant because it's all external"    No veiled messages - just some lessons I needed to relearn and share.

I head on down to  urlLink Left Bank Books , browse a little, purchase a used copy of Kevin Murphy's  urlLink  A Year At the Movies   and read it cover to cover.   That's right - Tom Servo himself, the man, the myth, the dessert topping,  actually spent one whole year (2001) watching movies...and sharing his  experiences in book form, and this is easily one of the best books about  movies that I have read.   It's hard to encapsulate how wonderful, how life affirming, how whiz-  bang fun this book is...and it's not just that Mr. Murphy discusses  really cool places he's seen movies, but it's an ultimate reminder about  the power of good filmmaking. Ranging from a theater where a guy sells  tickets out of his bedroom window, to an igloo in northern Canada,  and the best essay on 9/11&nbsp;(the event) &nbsp;that I have ever read...  this book is a treat. It is an easy read, and Mr. Murphy's comments  about the state of filmmaking, Cannes, Sundance, etc, are well worth it.   (Personally, my favorite chapter - and where I wish I had "been there" - was  where he and  urlLink Mike Nelson , his former  Mystery Science Theater 3000  costar, risk life, limb, and sanity to watch  urlLink  Corky Romano   in a theater.   Although they may have experience with bad movies,  Corky Romano  -  much like  urlLink  Monkeybone   - is the cinematic equivalent of slow, painful torture. It is not a movie to be taken lighty -it is pure evil on film.   I hereby nominate Kevin Murphy and Michael J. Nelson for the Congressional Medal of Honor. I kid you not.)   At a time where movies are becoming less movie-ish, where films like   Farenheit 9/11  and  The Village  are becoming better  known as stunts than actual filmmaking, this book is sorely needed.  Reading this book will change your life, your outlook, and help you  appreciate the movies a little bit more.   Thanks, Kevin. We really needed it.

      Whew, boy, after the sturm-und-drang of this week, it will be good  to have a relatively low-key week...OK, so  urlLink my employer   is planning a big conference the first weekend of August,  and I'm trying to get as much down time as possible. However,  last night was really rough - a bad leg cramp kept me awake, so I'm a little out-of it.   If you haven't been there already, check out  urlLink Pin-Up Bowl   on Delmar. I planned a happy hour for this  urlLink singles club ,  and...ok, they lost my reservations, and we had to switch lanes,  but hey - it's all good. (Plus, if you do per person per game,  it's actually cheaper). Great place, great food, great bowling. Plus, if I'm going to change my marital status...gotta, like,   do stuff with people, especially single people.   Also got to make a sorely needed visit to mypal  urlLink Craig . It's  nice to take a break and withdraw from the world for awhile,  play with a 2 year old (his granddaughter), and just have a  nice, adult conversation (with him and his wife).  One where I don't feel like I'm stuck in a bad episode of   The Prisoner , and I'm Patrick McGoohan.    This week's been a real ride - from volunteering for  urlLink Viva Vox's    Flipping the Soul Switch  event to fun and games in Arnold.  (Read  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  for more details).   As you may have noticed, my blog has changed, and is  slightly off-kilter (in IE; it looks fine in  urlLink Mozilla ; hopefully,    it will soon look normal.   Plus, I've switched from  urlLink Bloglinker  to  urlLink Blogrolling .  Much of it was due to the Hot Ambercrombie Chick deal -  partly, sites I wouldn't link to in a million years  (like a "Get a Thai Wife now!" site) automatically linked to me...since I'm learning more, and know what I'm doing, it's all good.   Oh, and as always, I do requests, so share 'em.

          When last I blogged, we had gone through a contentious give-and-take with several people protesting that they were not allowed to vote on a smoke-free ordinance. Now, the public input session has ended, and the real fun is beginning.     The council deliberations started when the mayor asked the council for input. The alderman opposing the bill (let's call him Mr. J) had cited the fact that the ordinance was essentially "slid under the rug", and that no business owners had been contacted. He argued (and quite validly) that the council had no right to make such a radical change without notifying the business community, and that the people should have the right to vote on a bill (i.e., make it a petition initiative). And, of course, how dare we public health officials come in and tell the city of Arnold what to do?   In the spirit of democracy, the council decided to move this item up on the agenda, and have a full discussion. The only way this law could be repealed is if one of the aldermen who voted for the ordinance (it won 5 - 2) "reconsidered" his position. As the discussion progressed, some claws came out - one of the aldermen informed Mr. J that he (Mr. J) had been there the evening of the ordinance, and that he could have called supporters in - why didn't he? Another pointed out that, in his five years as city alderman, nobody showed up to city council meetings...until that evening. Mr. P (the alderman who proposed the ordinance, and yes, I could use real names - but what would be the point? This is just a blog, not a news article) reiterated that this ordinance was for the health of the community, and that it was meant to give people with breathing disorders (like asthma) equal access to dining. (Half of the restaurants in Arnold are smoke-free; most of them are fast food restaurants like McDonald's, Hardee's, etc). Most of the pro-smoking contingent threatened the council that they (the council) might not be reelected next year.   During all this, the anti-ordinance contingent's behavior was relatively less-than-civil, with rude comments, blatant insults, etc., being thrown during the proceedings. (Several times, the Mayor had to remind people to conduct themselves in a civil manner). At our end, we attempted to keep our spirits up, and we really worked to avoid throwing stones under our breath. (Talk about mixed metaphors). Yes, this is a contentious issue, and instead of rising to the occasion, it was devolving. At one point, Mr. J - sitting directly in front of myself and a worker from the Jefferson County Health Department - seemed to want to make it very personal. Here's what was said:       Mr. J - You health people, who pays your salary?  Me: Excuse me?  Mr. J - Where does your salary come from  Me: I think this is about the ordinance and not about where my check comes from...     Eventually, the meeting died down, and the mayor offered to the pro-smoking group that, if they could acquire 902 registered voter signatures by August, the referendum would be put on the ballot. However, they quickly got upset - and extremely vocal - when Mr. P asked that, since the ordinance would take effect on 11/01, and the election was 11/03, if they could try to pass a smokefree workplace ordinance. The pro-smoking crowd, so willing to fight for their right to smoke and dine, quickly left, not wanting to fight for their right to vote for (or against) smoke-free workplaces.   The buzz around Arnold City Hall was negative - unfortunately, the local media chose to leave before the meat of the conversation (or even in support). But it made one thing clear to me - standing up for oneself (even when it's for the job) often leaves a bullseye on your chest. Or, as GK Chesterton once said,  "I enjoy being in hot water - it keeps me clean."    So, if you don't have plans for November 1st, please feel free to come down to Arnold and dine at a fine eatery. Thank them for being smoke free, and let them know that you would encourage your friends to come on down. Just don't be suprised if, while dining at the same place I am,&nbsp;I get some dirty stares.   (And also, please feel free to make comments, either pro or con. Democracy - like revolution - begins at home, preferably in the bathroom mirror).

           You're nobody 'til everybody in this town        Knows you're poison, Got your Number,        Knows it must be avoided...        You're nobody 'til everybody in this town        Thinks you're a bastard...       Elvis Costello,  ...This Town....        No, this blog is not about what you might think it is; however, it may be about it. It could be about anything. However, it's about my Thursday night in Arnold, MO.   It all started with a phone call from a colleague - some smoke-free legislation which we had helped pass was in danger of being repealed. There was going to be a "packed house" of people who would protest, and we were needed. Since the only major activity I had planned that Thursday night was my laundry, it was an easy choice, and so I prepared, studied up, and put on my game face.   Later that evening, after arriving in Arnold, meeting with the alderman who sponsored the bill (and got some preliminary strategic information), and conferring amongst ourselves, we went in, prepared for conflict. Of course, we weren't going to be nasty or insulting about it - we were just going to be calm, give the facts, and let the chips fall where they may.   However, always expect the unexpected - at the beginning of "business from the floor" (where citizens get to provide input), a gentleman approached the microphone. He admitted that he was in favor of the ban, but that he didn't appreciate the fact that restaurants were not advised beforehand (despite several notices in the local paper). He also then asked why I - stating my name, occupation, and residency - was there (as well as other people) when this was passed, but why business owners weren't invited.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For some reason, this time...it was personal. Normally (despite some people's opinion), I'm not seeking self-promotion; I'm more than content being a background guy. However, I was singled out first...but I needed to bide my time. See what would happen.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Testimony progressed, and it was a continual back-and-forth: testimony about "rights to smoke" vs. scientific data about the health costs of secondhand smoke. People not voting on this vs. public health matters (like asbestos) not voted on. Parents of asthmatic children vs. older people wanting their right to smoke publicly. (Of course, the pro-smoking individuals couldn't consider putting their cigarettes out  before  dining).

      Have to edit a blog that I was going to post yesterday - it's a little *too* up-close-and-personal, and was the result of too much stress, too much caffeine, not enough solid food. It's a kind of "romantic travails" essay...but more on that later.  First, after all of yesterday's hassles and triumphs, I got to pick up my weekly comics stash -  JSA  (man, I admire Geoff Johns - he can take all sorts of DC minutiae and whip 'em into a good story),  The Escapist  (and why haven't you read Michael Chabon's  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay  yet?)...and  Identity Crisis # 2 . As I was discussing with the clerk at the Fantasy Shop in Maplewood (free plug!), this is the first time in a long time that I have wondered what would happen  next  in a comic. The JLA's "secret" is revealed, which explains a lot about certain aspects of DC Continuity...and a twist is revealed. Brad Meltzer really shows his mettle, and this simply is a pure joy, and another reason to keep living. I kid you not.  Speaking on the other end...J. Michael Straczynski (or JMS) has always, in my opinion, been a rather spotty writer. I appreciated what he tried to do on  Babylon 5 , and I have found his comic writing to be rather hit-or-miss.  It's hard for me to believe that the same guy who is writing a razor-sharp  Supreme Power , a riff on an obscure Marvel group (itself a riff on the Justice League) also writes the Showtime original series  Jeremiah , aka "Apocalypse 90210" (available through  urlLink Netflix ).   One is an intelligent real-world, Watchmen-esque study of super powered beings among us. The other is a slightly above average survey of life after "The Big Death", where all the adults died and the kids grew up to inherit...a mess. Luke Perry and Malcolm Jamal Warner play two men who meet in these circumstances, and deal with the outside world. This series has its moments, but pretty much foreshadows with a broad brush and...it's entertaining, but encourages me to seek out the Hermann Hueppen graphic novels which it is based on.   Enough of my yakkin' for now...

      You know, when I started this, I thought it would be one of those fly-by-night things; after all, I kept a personal journal on my computer, so it wasn't like I would be posting my innermost secrets - just wanted to see where it took me, and it's an interesting process, to say the least.  Finished  Hitchhiker  - unless you're a hardcore Douglas Adams fan, I would avoid it. It's kind of, well, dull, and that's the last thing you would expect from Douglas Adams. Plus, I'm looking forward to making my way through some continually unread books I own, such as  Reefer Madness ,  The Corrections , and a three-book  Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine   series. (Of course, work will be keeping me busy, recovering from a big project and moving into a four-day conference in the city).  I'm also glad that many of my pals are bloggers - hell, I'm just glad I have friends. My sanity's been a little ragged lately, with all the drama that's going on...the brightest part of my weekend has been reading that a "Hot Ambercrombie Chick" linked to my blog. (Just click on her link - it's actually pretty cool).  Also watched  Election , and it may be hitting too close to home, but it is one of the most evil, unwatchable movies I have ever seen. None of the characters are redeemable, and did we really need an erotic scene with Matthew Broderick? I think not.  Until next time, kids...

      First, after a really short but intense week (Tuesday night in Jefferson County, Wednesday night in Chesterfield, Thursday night shuttling from Arnold to Fenton), I am proud to say that I completed the first draft of my novel! Yes, I didn't announce this previously, but sometimes, having a little drama in your personal life can be a  good  thing.   I also changed the look of my blog - nothing major; just wanted it to have a little bit more snap to it. (Of course, I had to import all the codes from my previous blog, so note to self:  always save your old template code  before  making changes ).   Finally, I sat and watched  The Last Supper  - no, Mel Gibson didn't make a prequel, but in these political times, it is very...interesting, and still very dark. Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Ron Perlman, and a cast of others are featured in this comedy/drama about a group of friends who invite a guest every week for dinner. Released at the height of the PC era, it hits some very painful areas...but is well worth seeing. Rent it today.   And now, to bed.

      And no, I don't mean "The Simpsons" or "Futurama" - more like "Life in Hell".   This has been a very busy week for me - providing testimony for some city council meetings in the county, being election commissioner for a very contentious local election, trying to catch up on work, attending a SIDS health fair, feeling overworked, underpaid, and tired...but it was Wednesday night, at Chesterfield Mall, killing time before a meeting, when I realized that I really was in hell. Nothing could prepare me for the worst, for this soul-searing revelation.    Punky Brewster  is out on CD...and you can buy it at Suncoast.   What sick, twisted mind devised this idea? What corner of freshly fallen hell did this individual come out of who thought this was smart? Punky Brewster is about this annoying little kid, her doddering old grandpa, and (I believe) a little robot monkey. The only thing worse than Punky Brewster is  Small Wonder , where it's about an annoying little kid, his doddering dad, and a robot girl, and they fight crime, or something.   Right now, the best thing would be an all-expense paid trip to some exotic island where I can be pampered, catered to, and generally gain an ego reboost.

      In my humble opinion, storms really frickin' suck. Monday, my power flipped out twice (and for some reason, my fridge was working but my freezer...let's just say warm Ben &amp; Jerry's Chunky Monkey ain't pretty), and I ended up spending most of the day asleep, recovering from my 4th of July partay-ing.   However, it wasn't all bad - started reading  urlLink  Hitchhiker   by MJ Simpson (It's a biography of Douglas Adams, and it looks OK so far). Note to myself - quit  the frequent trips to the library and start reading the books you own. That way,  you can't be arrested for library card fraud. Also slogged my way through   Doctor Who:  The Caves of Androzani   (Robert Holmes is a frickin' genius - he  wrote the ultimate Doctor debut in "Spearhead from Space"; this is the ultimate  Doctor regeneration story), and took a lot of naps.   Tuesday at work - ugh! The roof in my office was drippy, the air was musty, and I spent half a day in Jefferson County. Whatever I did in a previous life, I'm getting karmically kicked in the heinie.   And finally, the world must be coming to an end -  Simon &amp; Simon  is coming out on DVD.

      Most of today I have spent napping, trying to wade through H.P. Lovecraft, cleaning up my apartment, and recovering from Fair St. Louis.  No, it wasn't chemically induced - last night, I went to see the Wallflowers play a free show, followed by a really intense fireworks display. I have to admit that I'm not exactly the Wallflower's biggest fan - enjoy their work, but Jakob Dylan's Springsteenish habits never appealed. Last night, however, I have to admit - they kicked out the jams. You know you're dealing with a really good band when 1) you don't check your watch during the show; 2) you're impressed when they encore with "The Kids are Alright" by the Who  and  "Peace, Love, and Understanding" by Elvis Costello (via Nick Lowe); and 3) you are willing to go and buy their records rather than download illegally. (Just kidding about # 3, RIAA... or am I?   That was followed, after a seemingly eternal commercial, by a really intense fireworks display. I love big fireworks displays - why buy cheap fireworks and risk bodily injury when the professionals do it for you? Bright explosions of color so intense you actually feel the ground shake...man, that's it for me.  Other notable things: a friend and I walking through Laclede's Landing, trying to find a place to hang until the MetroLink lines thin out....running to a half-empty bar charging a $3 cover charge (!)...passing by a much smaller stage, hearing a very lame band, and realizing that it's the Gin Blossoms (aka the "Hey, Jealousy!" guys - how sad)...and then finishing up the night sitting in the basement of the  urlLink Bi-State  building eating really cheap Chinese food and digging the crowd...and finally, waking up in the morning to some really intense thunderstorms, and being able to just feed the cat and head back to bed.  If that doesn't say "fun", I don't know what does.

      If you're looking for two cool reads, don't want to slog through a lot of texts, and you still can't locate that copy of  The DaVinci Code , here are two really cool graphic novels you might enjoy.  First, I checked  urlLink Fables:  Animal Farm  out of the public library (something which was not considered when I was small and wee). The premise is simple: all our favorite fairy tale characters were ridden out, and have made lives among us. When I saw the book, I thought it was a lame premise...but reading the 2nd story arc, I am really wanting to get the collected first arc, or (honor or honors) have it in my pull file at the Fantasy Shop in Maplewood.  (BTW, if you work there, just give me a slight percent discount for the free plug)  Anyway, another really good book is Kurt Busiek's Astro City, and after discussing it with some of my coworkers, I submitted to temptation and purchased  urlLink Astro City: Confession , the trade paperback of the first extended arc.  It's about a young man who comes to Astro City and becomes a hero's apprentice. It has everything: high drama, great characterization, a still-can't-see-it-coming twist in the middle...and a lame dude named Crackerjack. If that doesn't spell good reading, I don't know what does.

      (Quick note - although it claims you have to subscribe to read the article cited, you can get a "day pass" - you have to click through a brief web commercial, but you get to read this...and a really kewl article on Husker Du's classic album,  urlLink  ZenArcade  )  To be honest, I had strange heroes growing up - most kids liked baseball, basketball, football...except for  urlLink Walter Payton , my role models were Doctor Who (the Jon Pertwee version), John Steed of the Avengers, and Ralph Nader. There was something inherently cool about guys who took on bigger causes, fought evil, and were able to do it (although maybe not in Nader's case) with charm, flair, and wit.  When I was looking up an article on a favorite album, I came across this   urlLink Salon article about Ralph Nader , and quite frankly...if half of what is said is true, I'm disappointed, but not surprised.  It's easy to see oneself as the kind of Raymond Chandler-esque, "down these mean streets a man must walk who is himself not mean, neither tarnished nor afraid" kind of person, that taking on great causes means that you yourself are indestructibe or beyond reproach. (Look at what has happened/is happening with  urlLink Michael Moore . It's considering yourself the only bastion of truth, justice, and the American way...and making sure everyone knows it. (In all fairness, I've pulled this kind of thing myself).  I guess the Stranglers were right - no more heroes anymore...

      First, I just had to blog about this -  urlLink a big frickin' hot dog . Hot Dogs = Power Food  Ok, I haven't been as blogworthy as usual - between a very contentious election for  urlLink Metropolis  (which I really didn't want to do, but got suckered, er, I mean, volunteered), finishing up a major tobacco education project for work, giving testimony last night in Arnold (the bill we were working on passed 5 - 2), working on a novel, and other various life activities, things have been busy and stressful. Of course, I have found the perfect stress reliever....   Futurama  on DVD - nothing eases your stress quite like a robot saying, "Bite my shiny metal @$$"

      It's official - yesterday, I had to clean out my office, due to the extensive rain damage. So, for the next two weeks, I will be a man without an office...floating around our agency, living out of my briefcase, doing paperwork and copies on the run. In short, like grad school without the Oreos and Mountain Dew. Although I have worked in a vacationing coworker's office, soon I will have to leave, since she will have returned on Monday.  But folks, the damage in my office is bad - tiles bulging inward and colored in various shades of yellow and brown; several papers and posters tossed due to them being damp and moist; my belongings boxed and hidden in a little cubbyhole. Thanks to some foresight, a curriculm which I had promised to one of my colleagues (and was packed away) arrived via mail yesterday, meaning that I can actually *gasp* perform my job.  Also, fortunately, I will be out of my office more frequently than I will be in the office within the next few weeks. This weekend is a huge, statewide prevention conference (so check out the archive if you want to read more stuff for the next few days), then next Thursday through Tuesday I'm on vacation - a well-needed break after the events of the past six months.  Luckily, today is more of a catch-up/finalizing day: getting things done and completed before I go off. In addition, the damage to my office isn't as extensive as that done to one of our directors - she lost so much in terms of records, papers, etc, it is not even funny. Our executive director is also not happy - lost productivity, lost time, and potential replacement of materials is  not  fun.  If you don't see or hear from me for awhile, please understand - I'm not ignoring you. Just going to be busy...

      As you've probably read in these very posts, I am a comic fanboy...and I have kissed a girl. Several, in fact, but that's neither here nor there. When I'm not working or doing social stuff, I peruse several comics-related blogs: here are my three faves, in no particular order:   urlLink Comic Treadmill  - reviews of comics both old and new, and currently focusing on the little reprint digests that DC used to put out. Not about nostalgia; it's all about the comics.   urlLink PostModern Barney  - news, reviews, rantings, and snarky comments about comic covers of the past. And no, I'm not including it because he linked to me - honest!   urlLink Progressive Ruin  - The Greatest Comics Blog in the Multiverse. I am  not  kidding.  Yes, they are all part of my blogroll, but go forth and enjoy. They're more fun - and informative - than you can conceive.

      Quite often, I have to read information about my field (substance abuse) in order to keep current. Although I love reading, I try not to read too many books about the field - mostly because, if I have to live it 40 hours a week, I would rather focus on something else. However, when I saw that the author of  Fast Food Nation , Eric Schlosser, was writing about the underground market (including marijuana), it was just too good to pass up.  Luckily, thanks to plenty of free time this weekend, I was able to make my way through  Reefer Madness , which focuses on three primary underground markets: marijuana, immigrant labor, and pornography. (Don't worry - although it's adult in content, there's no graphic sex or violence). Schlosser examines some of the forces at work within these three areas, and how they impact the "mainstream" economy.  The book's two essays about the "hotter" issues - marijuana and pornography - are the strongest, with the labor trade a close second. (In all fairness, all three essays are well-researched and well-written). Schlosser finishes the book with a capsule summary and argument about how all three have impacted the mainstream. It is a very informative, enlightening book that comes to some somewhat problematic conclusions about its subject matter. (Read: I disagree with some of his conclusions, but I respect the fact that he has taken the time to consider the facts, which is often not the case in these areas).  Is this an easy read? No, because it provides a really strong historical context (especially for pornography), and in our cut-to-the-chase culture, his book demands careful attention. However, like  Fast Food Nation , Schlosser's commentary provides illuminating insight not only into these phenomena, but into our entire culture as well.  Definitely worth pursuing.

      Admittedly, this past weekend totally rocked - Saturday night was a benefit for the Missouri Coalition for Budget Policy & Priorities, which works towards making sure that state fiscal policy reflects the needs of low and middle income families. Like much in St. Louis, there is the "social worker" clique - luckily, since I don't have an MSW (only an MEd), I am granted special privileges in this clique. Got to see Old Man Joe (a band comprised of several welfare/Medicaid/social work policy wonks), saw a Congressional candidate totally rock the house, and really noticed that a former colleague of mine was...well, attractive. As Wayne and Garth might say, "If she were a cult science fiction program, she'd be Babe-ylon 5."   (And if she ever reads this, I meant the above in a totally professional and dignified manner. Honestly. She has my utmost professional respect)   Sunday was spent taking a nice, long, well-deserved nap - since the next week are so will be busy, I wanted to get my rest in, and take in as much down time as possible. It seemed like the perfect weekend...  ...Until I got into the office this morning. Thanks to last week's rains, my office is still flooded, and I am "camping out" in a vacationing coworker's office. Sadly, our executive director had to give me the bad news - I'm going to be exiled for awhile, and will need to pack up my stuff and move it out. The landlords are going to totally rehab my office, from floor to ceiling, due to the extensive water damage. No problem - I will only be in five and a half of the next fourteen days, so I don't have to sweat it.  And, being the "tobacco guy" at my agency, I am currently working on insuring some legislation passes and/or stays put. Arnold, Ballwin are coming up, and pretty soon may be Florissant and  urlLink St. Peters . Although it's not the most glamorous (or well-paying) job, it's nice to know that my work actually gets results, and isn't just, well, lining the pockets of "The Man".  Thanks for reading, and hopefully, we'll touch base again...

      ...aka DVD reviews. Nothing major - just some recommendations should Blockbuster not have your fave new release, or if you want to start a Netflix queue.   Doctor Who:  The Curse of Fenric   - When I first saw this episode from the 1989 (and final) season of DW, I thought it was, well, pretentious crap. I had no idea what the heck was going on...thank BBC Home Video (through Warner Brothers) for not only providing the episodic version, but a reedited "Special Edition" on Disc 2, which has now convinced me that this is a flat-out masterpiece. Get this disc, watch the special edition on disc 2, and...well, I am more than willing to argue that Joss Whedon watched this constantly when he was formulating the  Buffy  series. This, plus all the extra goodies (including a revealing interview with Ian Briggs, the writer) make it a must-have and must-watch.   Shadow of a Doubt  - According to reputation (and the testimonials on the making-of featurette), this was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite film. It's mixture of sinister happenings in small-town America make it an instant classic. It won't get the ink of, say,  Vertigo  or  Psycho , but this shows the master of suspense at his finest.   Justice League:  Starcrossed   - This animated DVD, taken from the 2nd series closer, packs more character development/drama/overall action punch in 63 minutes than most Hollywood fare. It's basically a reintroduction of the Hawkman character (although not introduced as such), it's a setup for the  Justice League Unlimited  series to air this fall on Cartoon Network. However, don't let that stop you from getting this disc...   The Killing  - The first collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and Jim Thompson, author of  The Killer Inside Me ,  The Grifters ,  A Hell of A Woman , and other excellent novels. This noir masterpiece - an admitted influence on  Pulp Fiction  - features a racetrack robbery, a non-linear storyline, one of Thompson's best endings, and great acting. It's done something that very few movies do - makes me want to reread Thompson's books. (Also, check out their second and last collaboration,  Paths to Glory   - a classic antiwar film).   Founding Fathers  - My mother and I kid my father, who enjoys the History Channel, because there's very little suspense. "Hey, Dad, who do you think will win World War II?" However, this documentary - focusing on the American Revolution, is very revelatory about the forces that shaped our country. (By the way, you might also want to read Founding Brothers and Walter Isaacson's biography of Benjamin Franklin - great reads, and very insightful). You will learn a lot more from this DVD than you did in history class. That's a promise.
