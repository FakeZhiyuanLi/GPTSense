      Last night I went to see 'A Home at the End of the World,' which I had been highly anticipating for months. I did not read Michael Cunningham's book, which the film is adapted from, so I didn't really have any idea what the story was other than the quick blurbs that you read before a picture is released. The most I did hear, actually, was not about the film itself but rather the cutting (no pun intended) of the scene in which the filmmakers display Colin Farrell's penis. I happen to be in love with Colin Farrell, and he is only one of the only two celebrity men I adore (Tom Cruise being the first). However, I thought the hubbub and the controversy over whether to cut the uncut was only going to cheapen the story and the experience of watching it. After exposing myself to a great many French films, nothing shocks me in the ways of nudity and sex, and it's the story I'm after anyway. Talk all you like about the women who were "frightened" by Colin Farrell's penis during preview screenings, but save it for the DVD.  Like I said, I was anticipating this movie for a long time. And anticipation breeds expectation. I really enjoyed this film; contrary to other reviews, it is not melodramatic or sentimental. Sometimes I feel like writing nasty letters to film reviewers who mistake deep characters and an actor's vulnerability for melodrama and sentimentality. Colin Farrell is an absolute wonder to behold as Bobby. If people were on the fence as to whether or not he could act, they should come down from their fences. He wears his emotions on his face in a brilliantly understated way, You want nothing more than to take care of Bobby -- to shield him from a world that even though has caused him a great deal of heartbreak, he still sees its beauty. Bobby is a man-child who wants everyone to be happy, to be OK. You can't help but be brought to his level of sadness or happiness or longing, because by caring for Bobby, you too have become a child. Credir Colin Farrell with one of the strongest, most understated and heartbreaking performances you'll see this year or any other.   I enjoyed 'A Home at the End of the World' but I didn't like it. And I feel so strongly about the film that I've not been able to reconcile why this is. How could I have enjoyed something so much but left the theater feeling as though I wanted to hate it? Maybe Bobby is such a strong character in his likeability, his weakness and his dependency, that the betrayal he had visited upon him by one of the ones he loved the most was so unforgiveable that I left the movie with such a strong sense of loss. To have this happen to Bobby, after all that he'd been through, was a punishment that was inconceivable. Even though he's not totally abandoned by the end of the movie, he has suffered such an irreplaceable loss that I still cannot reconcile what has been done to him. Even though he covers up the pain with an unwavering belief that life, and the people that inhabit it, is beautiful, I could only grieve for him. And in a way, Bobby was me. So it wasn't any longer a question of how could this be done to Bobby, but how could this be done to me?   But on the other hand, I worry that I've become one of these people who ends up hating a movie because I don't like what happens to the characters, even though the script is flawless in setting them up for whatever it is they have coming to them. There's nothing wrong with Cunningham's script. But the fact that one of the characters did something that was completely unforgiveable to me has overshadowed the quality of the story. It worries me because when I write, be it a script or a short story, many times I make decisions that I know are going to upset an audience or a reader. Still, I ask them to look at it in context. I ask them to feel sympathy. I ask them to understand.   That's what Michael Cunningham and the filmmakers were asking me to do. But I didn't.  So now, in order for me to do that, I'm going to have to see it again and try to make myself understand.

      I'm all about putting Kerry and Edwards in the White House. But there's something that frightens me about John Edwards, and it's not his policies or his ideas, but something else that doesn't allow me to watch him for more than twelve seconds at a time. HE LOOKS LIKE A TALKING KEN DOLL. It's quite offputting to me. So much so that I almost want to cry when he opens his mouth and shows he has opposable thumbs. I'm happy he's going to be playing second fiddle to Kerry, because I just don't know if I could emotionally tolerate President Ken by Mattel.

      The Times-Picayune in New Orleans has a story about a 21 year old man who was busted by a sheriff's deputy when, after chatting with the officer for a while and then remarking that "there are a lot of stupid people out there," the cop noticed a plastic bag protruding from the man's pocket. There was marijuana in it and he was busted. As I read the article, I was trying to think of what I would do in a situation like that, then I realized that I wouldn't be chatting with the law when I had an illegal substance on my person.

      When I was building my profile at the top of this page, it asked that I enter my city, state, and country of residence. I decided to be funny and enter Wallis and Futuna as the country I reside in. This is not true. I don't even know where that is, as I am not good at geography. Please redirect the welfare checks to my real address in the United States. I realize now that some things just are not funny. I should have learned that lesson last year when I told family members I did not want visiting that I lived in Los Angeles, Kazakhistan. When they arrived at customs in Kazakhistan, they had a terrible time of it and I no longer receive their Christmas newsletter.

      This morning I noticed that my site has ads by Google at the top of the page. I suppose it's a good thing, though I don't know what it means exactly.   On top of my page this morning were two ads, side by side. The first ad was for drug and alcohol addiction treatment, and the second was for exotic Japanese Sake. I thought that was ironic, on more than a couple of levels.   Anyway, maybe the ads will convince someone to get help for an addiction. Or maybe the ads will make someone realize they need help after ordering a paycheck's worth of exotic sake.   I wish I had some sake right now.

      On Saturday, Jaclyn, Blake and I went to dinner at a place in Santa Monica called Shabu 2. All I could afford to eat was a hot dog from the stand in the mall, but Jaclyn bought dinner for me and Blake, which was very generous and very nice of her, and no one had to eat hot dogs.   Shabu 2 is Japanese. It’s a second restaurant from the people who came up with Shabu Shabu. I like to say Shabu Shabu and am finding that if I say it too much, as I’m inclined to do, I start to giggle horrendously and am unable to stop. At Shabu 2, you sit at tables with 2 sleek stovetops built into the tables. You order "pots" or you order "Shabu Shabu." Either way, the meat or fish you choose, along with your vegetables, come raw on a couple of platters and you cook them in the water basins that sit on the stovetops built into the table. I make it sound more complicated than it is, surely. We all ordered the Shabu Shabu because that’s what the restaurant’s named for. I had the chicken and the beef Shabu Shabu. Jaclyn and Blake got beef and fish. We also got drinks. I got a bottle of Sapporo -- a "tall boy" – because it had four glasses worth, and it became increasingly more difficult to lift my beef and chicken with the chopsticks into the boiling water basin. But I managed and it was very good. Jaclyn got ice cream with her dinner. It was leche ice cream and it had leche nuts in it. Blake and I didn’t know what leches were so I felt it was appropriate to declare: "It’s people! Leche nuts is PEOPLE!" We thought it was funny, but I don’t know if the Japanese staff thought it was very humorous.  Anyway, it was very good and we had fun. Shabu 2 is much better than Benihana and a lot funnier to say.  Then Blake and I watched "A Cry in the Dark." I tried to tell him for a couple of weeks that it’s about a woman whose baby gets stolen by a dingo but I don’t think he believed me. We both hated the movie and fast forwarded through most of it. We did walk away with some gems, though, including the classic "Maybe the dingo ate your baby!" which we kept telling each other in really bad Australian accents. We also came up with some kick-ass Halloween costumes. I’m going to be Lindy Chamberlain (the woman who watched her baby get carried off by the dingo), complete with a bob, housedress, and trouser socks. Blake is going to be one of the animal rights protesters. He’ll wear a T-shirt that says "The Dingo is Innocent." Jaclyn may go as an aborigine, we don’t know.

      Last night the eleven o'clock news did a quick report on a 600 pound woman who sat on her sofa so long that her skin eventually wove itself into the fabric of the sofa and she was stuck there. The fire department had to tow her out of the house and she was taken to the hospital.  Last night I had my recurring "I'm a Bologna Sandwich on Wonder Bread" dream. This morning I woke up thinking I will take up running again.

      My friend Jason keeps me laughing at work lately by sending me blurbs of reviews throughout my boss' career. I'm working for the only actor I ever actively made fun of and did impressions of through college. That I've ended up working for him is just another of God's jests.    *his name is protected because I don't want to end up on the street  (Erin's boss) is totally miscast as a geriatric mafioso, and his approach to the material is to weakly impersonate Ray Liotta, then add thirty years. Compare this to his performance in Lost in Yonkers, and you will see how far this once-great star has fallen.   But the flashes of satirical wit vanish once the basic premise has been established, and (Erin's boss' movie) gradually degenerates into a mindless, racist sex farce. Whenever the nice white characters stick on the Al Jolson blackface, they turn into horny, animalistic savages who wallow in toilet humor and try to boink anything that moves. (Erin's boss) in particular makes a complete jackass of himself waddling around in a tribesman outfit and making lame jokes about South Seas women with big cans.  (Erin's boss' character) at least had a good reason for resorting to fraud. It's anybody's guess what (Erin's boss) excuse is for appearing in this thing.  What am I doing with my life?

      Have attempted giving up smoking. Four days have gone by and today's been the first full day at work without my little rolled friends. The headaches are terrible. My true and wonderful friend Steven wants nothing more than to take me to karaoke tonight, especially because it's been weeks since I've seen him. I should be at home working on my applications but then again, I've been under some stress lately. Problem with karaoke is that people always buy me drinks. And drinking makes me want to smoke. I've only had one cup of coffee today because another cup of coffee would just make me want a cigarette. I told my friend Claire about my trials and tribulations and I told her that I don't know if I can do it, as I'm no quitter. "That's a T-shirt," she told me then went on to say how I shouldn't give up cigarettes AND coffee. Then I told her that I wasn't looking forward to eating because the feeling of fullness is a feeling I like to enjoy with a long stick of pleasure between my fingers. I told her I was basically an ex-addict with an eye toward anorexia -- THAT'S a t-shirt. She laughed quite a lot. It is rather funny, I think.   If there was a song about one's love for cigarettes and how that love has died, I think I would sing it tonight at karaoke. Maybe 'Tiny Dancer,' though that might confuse people.  I watched a rerun of a Jim Croce special on PBS last night when I couldn't sleep. I had watched it exactly one week before that. I am unable to get the song 'Operator' out of my head. If I was living out the song 'Operator,' I would have the operator he sings about put me through to a pack of cigarettes so I could tell them how much I loved them. But just as "she lives in LA, with my best old ex-friend, Ray," even though I love the cigarettes, they're still bad for me and I have to hang up the phone. I have to let the operator "keep the dime."

      I've been having really strange dreams lately. A few months ago I was having a recurring dream that involved having Erik Estrada as a roommate/wife. He wore a pink apron constantly. For the last two nights I've been having a dream that an inflatable Leonard Nimoy ten stories high was around every corner. On the way to the grocery store, on the way to work, on the way home, outisde my window. he was even doing the finger thing. I don't quite understand why -- the only thing I can attribute the dreams to is a change in diet and compounding stress. Or it could be that I've seen William Shatner at work a couple of times recently and last week he said "hello" to me.

      I am featured on my dear friend Marc's web site, The Daily Shower (www.thedailyshower.typepad.com). Recently, I wrote to Marc that I was indeed fired from my position at Dead End Jobs Incorporated, LLC, due to my daily perusal of The Daily Shower (click on the links in his blog and you'll see why, with a hefty dose of internet monitoring and a not-so-hefty dose of humor, I was let go -- downsized, if you will).  Since then, however, my employers have seen the err of their ways and rehired me, as they were unable to find anyone in Hollywood that was willing to stoop to the level that the job requires.   I am, however, still accepting the donations from Daily Shower readers to bestow upon my "legal team" (I would insert a link to a pornographic picture, but I don't know how to).  Thank you, Marc Cantone. And thank you, Daily Shower readers. There aren't enough wash cloths in all our showers combined that  would dry these tears of gratitude.

      I woke up very early on Saturday morning, more early than I’d have hoped on a day off. I was planning on going to the beach, set up my chair and read some scripts for work and do some of my own work. I was going to a party late in the afternoon, so I wanted to get as much work in as possible so I could enjoy myself without feeling guilty. But since I had woken up at 5 in the morning, it was too dark and too chilly to head to the beach right away. And the fork in the road at the end of Sunset Canyon that leads onto the PCH is tempting to someone like me, who adores the coastline here and is mystified by the landscape that spreads north of Los Angeles. If I had turned left then I would’ve been in Santa Monica and eventually in the Marina. But if I turned right, then I’d be driving through Malibu and beyond. I love what’s beyond Malibu – every bit of it. So I turned right.   The PCH is beautiful at five-thirty or six in the morning. The ocean smells the best at that time and there are basically no cars on the road. I recommend listening to jazz when you make the drive at that hour. Once I drove the 27 miles that is Malibu, I got off on Hueneme Road and drove through Oxnard and Ventura County. I decided I would head into Santa Barbara before coming back. I would have gone so far as Big Sur and possibly the Monterey Peninsula, but I don’t like to rush that trip. And there wasn’t enough time to do it anyway, since I had to be at a party and I was still a bit worried about not accomplishing any work. Soon though, as I wove my way down the PCH, I stopped stressing about losing those hours to work. I stopped in for a coffee someplace in Ventura County, by the Naval Base, called the Friends Café. The coffee was a little weak but there was something nice about the place. The people that sat outside eating their omelettes and drinking their weak coffee were not like the people in LA who crowd the sidewalks for weekend brunch. They weren’t like the hipsters in Los Feliz with their egg whites and their power fruit salads. These people seemed unaffected. They seemed happy. If I wasn’t on a schedule I might have stayed but I ordered my coffee to go instead and I got back in the car. I made my way to the border of Santa Barbara by about ten fifteen or ten-thirty. I drove around a while and started to head back the other way – back to the place I was from. Before I left I ordered another coffee, this time from Starbucks. I had gone through a couple of CDs on my trip – a jazz CD and then a Willie Nelson CD. On the way back to Los Angeles though I listened to Santa Barbara and Ventura’s NPR station, which was pleasant because they didn’t seem to have as many people on the radio with faux British accents. A woman was interviewing a travel writer who was based in Santa Barbara and divided his time between his home there and Japan. He was telling listeners that they should look at the place they live as though they were foreigners, so they could see it differently, as though they had new eyes. I think there’s a lot of weight to a philosophy like that.  I made it back to LA around two o’clock. I took unfamiliar roads home and I got a bit lost, but I didn’t mind. When I got to Marina del Rey I went swimming in the ocean before getting ready for the party. I saved my work for Sunday and got quite a lot done. I was thinking a lot more clearly, even though I still had seawater in my ears. Next weekend I think I’ll go swimming again before I begin working on my application for the Stegner.
