      I've returned at last from yet another camping trip (no more for this summer), my opinions on this one match those of the previous one; the key difference was that it was twice as long this time.  Upon my return, I found out that during the time I was camping, my grandfather back in Russia died.  We weren't close by any means, in fact I'm not sure if I've ever really met him anyway, on account of him being in prison.  I wasn't told when or how he died; I'll probably never be able to see his grave.

      I'm leaving again tomorrow afternoon for another camping expedition, this one will last longer than the last and you probably won't be hearing again from me until Sunday night.  Seeing as how a prolonged lack of Reality Sandwiches can be dangerous to your health ( and usually I prefer to make a post or 2 per day), I've made it a point to create a post that will surely stay fresh for the period of time during which I'll be gone.  I've shared with you all before some of my favorite music videos, but I believe the worst music video I've ever seen happens to be more entertaining.  So (due to  un popular demand) here it is, I give you the slightly homo-erotic video to the song "Dragostea din tei" by the Romanian "band" Ozone.    http://mapage.noos.fr/martialro/ozone/video.html  In case that doesn't strike your fancy, here are the lyrics as translated into English by someone who speaks the language.    Ma ia hi  Ma ia hoo  Ma ia ha  Mi ia haa  Ma ia hi  Ma ia hoo  Ma ia ha  Mi ia haa  Ma ia hi  Ma ia hoo  Ma ia ha  Mi ia haa  Ma ia hi  Ma ia hoo  Ma ia ha  Mi ia haa   Hello  Hi  Its me, an outlaw  and please except my love happiness   Hello  Hello  It is me Picasso  I gave you a call  And I am tough  But I want you to know  I ask nothing from you   You want to leave but  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't  You can't take me  The image of you face  And the love of the linden tree  Remind me of your eyes   I phone  To tell you  What I feel now  Hello  My love,  Its me  Happiness   Hello  Hello  It is me Picasso  I gave you a call  And I am tough  But I want you to know  I ask nothing from you   You want to leave but  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't  You can't take me  The image of you face  And the love of the linden tree  Remind me of your eyes   You want to leave but  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't  You can't take me  The image of you face  And the love of the linden tree  Remind me of your eyes   Ma ia hi  Ma ia hoo  Ma ia ha  Mi ia haa  Ma la hi  Ma la hoo  Ma la ha  Mi ia haa  Ma ia hi  Ma ia hoo  Ma ia ha  Mi ia haa  Ma ia hi  Ma ia hoo  Ma ia ha  Mi ia haa   You want to leave but  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't  You can't take me  The image of you face  And the love of the linden tree  Remind me of your eyes   You want to leave but  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't take me  You can't, you can't  You can't take me  The image of you face  And the love of the linden tree  Remind me of your eyes    urlLink

      2 posts about it in a row may seem slightly repetitive, but bear with me here.  I was passing through the living room and overheard a story on some sort of news show about the American Olympic uniforms being toned down and made less flashy on account that wearing something distinctively American is said to create a target for would-be terrorist assassins.  Quite frankly it's the most nonsensical thing I've ever heard.  Perhaps those geniuses responsible for this haven't thought of the fact that American athletes will still be easy to spot because they'll be the only ones whose nationality isn't clearly identified.. Oops. This paranoia is really being taken to far; strangely, many other nations who have terrorist attacks on a near daily basis (like Russia for example, Russia's always a good example for everything you know) still don't hide their nationality.    On a different note, go to http://opera.com and download Opera, it's a much better browser than Internet Explorer.  IE is for tools.

       Although I rarely watch TV, once in a while though I may take a look around at what's on when I've got nothing to do. Despite that, I've still picked up alot of the Olympic-patriotic-America-is-the-greatest type crap. Particularly this Michael Phelps dude with his goal of 8 gold medals which they act like he's already earned. Oddly enough it turns out he's already lost 2 of those medals. Goes to show ya really shouldn't paint someone out to be a hero before they've achieved anything. But morons run the media so what can one expect??  One a more positive note, I figured I'd share some music videos from one of my favorite bands, the Canadian alternative group MATTHEW GOOD BAND...enjoy.    urlLink  http://www.matthewgood.org/media/video/beautifulmidnight/apparitions_480.php       urlLink  http://www.matthewgood.net/media/video/avalanche/weapon_320.php       urlLink  http://www.matthewgood.org/media/video/whitelightrockandroll/alertstatusred_480.php

      ...well not countrymen, people from the country are annoying, citymen I guess, wait no, those people are rude, suburbanmen, I suppose that works.  Anyways, I've returned from camping last night, since most of the people who read this have never met me in person anyway, I'm not gonna bother with the personal details, basically it was near Lava Canyon in Washington, although I had a better time than I expected, it still wasn't good.  I wasn't violated by either a bear or bigfoot, this was both a relief and small disappoint as it means I wasn't deemed suitable for violation by large woodland creatures, talk about a self-esteem killer.

      Many of us will soon be voting for the first time, this is of course a great responsibility not to be taken lightly. I figured I should do the small number of people who read this a service by offering some insight about some of the key principles of voting. First off, voting for candidates of either Republican or Democratic party is wrong. The USA has nearly 300 million people living in it, this means there is a broad spectrum of political beliefs and only 2 choices of political allignment are nowhere near sufficient to cover it. Are people so unintelligent that any more than 2 options to decide between becomes too confusing? My pessimism says yes, logic says probably not. Even the newcomers to democracy in Russia (who've only had free elections begin within the last 14 years) have several major political parties to choose from. Be it congress(wo)men, governors, or presidents; because they are almost always just subjects of their respective party's agenda, they're not likely to represent your views. This however doesn't mean you are to stay away from the polling places and not participate in politics. The matter breaks down very simply, sometimes people are given the chance to vote on laws, taxes, and various other ordinances; in these instances, they are able to vote according to their opinions on the matter, not having to do anything with partisan politics. It is in this case that it's wise to exercise voting rights.

      Leaving this coming Thursday evening and not coming back till Saturday, then once again for 5 days the next Wednesday.  I've never been too keen on "the great outdoors," maybe I would be okay with it if I had known what makes it so great.  There's the mosquitos, the bears that try to catch me in the hopes that I'd become their "forest bride," and the morons I have to go with..oh and sasquatch of course...it just doesn't seem like it will make for a good time.

      No one reads it yet anyway, basically just testing stuff out.
