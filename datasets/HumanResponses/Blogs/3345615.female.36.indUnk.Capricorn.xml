      First time I tied on a pair of skates it was 1979. Rented for 5 guilders at the roller disco in Scheveningen. There I could dance on them all night. Dancing I say, for lack of a better word of course, especially since the first step was still to learn how to stand on them. The music playing was grown up music, which I used to hear at home each day and even as young as I was it fascinated me immensely. In the heart of the 70’s I spent endless days dancing to feisty funk, soothfull soul and dizzy disco as a toddler and now that I was a big girl, I could do the exact same thing on skates at the roller disco.  Cool fanatic that I was, it didn’t take long before I skated around the dance floor effortlessly, upper body swinging away to the music, naturally. That’s as far as I got. In the years that followed, my skates and I were an inseparable pair. It didn’t take long before I’d bought my first pair (brown suede boots: yea well, you must look cool of course, any other skates simply won’t do!). I stopped riding in buses and trams, even if it only was because I could take all the shortcuts and spend a tenth of the time I would’ve otherwise on public transportation to get to where I was going. In the meanwhile, around 1983, The Hague’s Uithof had been converting its ice skating rink into a skate hall during the summers. There was a DJ who had fine tunes bouncing off the walls and a skate ramp for the roller skaters and skateboarders. True skate dancers were still a rarity but when I finally got to see them I’d stand and watch in admiration at all those dance steps thinking to myself there was no way I’d EVER be able to do anything like that. Don’t know what made me decide not to give it a shot, and so I remained skating circles around the rink (with a swinging upper body) only to look enviously at the skaters dancing on a mere 2 square meters.  Life hits: your first job, busy busy busy, boyfriends, leaving the nest and starting on the journey of your first lessons of life as a “grown up”. I had a whole lot more on my mind than putting on my skates. I found a nice place for them to rest in a dark corner of my closet.  Almost 20 years down the line and I’ve joined the wednesdaynightskate event in Rotterdam a couple of years. A bit of a workout is what’s on your mind at such a time, and I can finally do something to keep fit. Hanging out at the Binnenrotte at the end of the night…….. and there I spotted the skate dancers again. Now the time has come, now I have to take matters into my own hands, now I want to learn how to do it. I can skate, and dancing I’ve always done. Combining the two ought to be a piece of cake. Let’s see… it’s august now and if I work hard on it I should be good by the end of 2003, no problem! NOT!!! Had my first class at the Calypso in October of 2003 and found out I’d been horribly mistaken in calculating the time I needed to master the moves. Sweat dripping off my face and after the first class I’m hurting and completely wiped out. But ma-a-an, how unbelievably cool. Sporting to feisty funk, soothfull soul and dizzy disco. Hooked and in love with dancing on skates. Certainly now that I’m getting better after a rough beginning I’m starting to get a good feel for it. I’m ecstatic and I feel my enthusiasm growing by the day. The moment a high intensity balance move works, I’m floating and that’s the feeling I do it for ‘cause it means I’m doin’ it right. Unbridled energy is the result I get from it. In a time span of 5 months I’ve added to my weekly skating regime: what started as a Thursday night class is now accompanied by at least three extra nights per week worth of training at home. And the Masterclass for the fine-tuning. Had real Beadle-plates placed on my skates for easier and smooth flowing movements. Wearing them whenever possible, strapping on the skates to do the dishes and at work too (how can I resist the parquet?) And… next week my foldable wooden floor (hinges fastened smoothly into the wood so it fits perfectly over the floor and with minimum seam) of 2.40 x 2.00 will be delivered at my place. Have a lot of training ahead of me before I get to where I want to be. My premature resolution to get there within 4 months I’ve long since extended to at least one year before I may get remotely close to its general direction. I see fellow fanatics around me. It only stimulates me to aspire for further improvement. Until my feet are blistered and I get cramps. But not a dull moment. It’s addicting. My skates and I are once again an inseperable pair. It gives me more than simply pleasure. “Got canned heat in my heels…” Jay K. (Jamiroquai)   urlLink  (Original Version)   If you prefer to read in Dutch

      Barely back from Barcelona and allready tomorrow I´m on businesstrip for a week to the other side of the world. This time I have to leave my loved ones behind. But I will get over this immense sadness. Will leave them in someone´s care who knows how to treat my babies right. They will be pampered and get some new coating for the summerseason.

      Second day in Barcelona. Yesterday took a trip to the marina and the boulevard and skated for about 2 hours underneath the palmtrees. Hahaha this is the life! Skating the centercity is more difficult because some areas and streets are just unskateable (at least for quadrollerskaters). But there are lots of Plaza´s where I can groove some of my moves. Gotta go now, sun is shining and is calling for me.

      Yesterday I got myself bruised knees, some losing of skin on my finger and a backache. Getting used to it, sort of. In some odd way you learn how to fall. I always seem to make the perfect slidings when I'm on a streetcourseroll. The streets don't like me. WELL I DON'T LIKE THEM EITHER!   We had a perfect day with sun and some cool wind. The course lasted about 2 hours and took us through a part of The Hague. Don't know really where we went, was to caught up in watching the black asphalt (not the best kind) underneath and right in front of my wheels. There were lots of holes, cracks and pits that decorated these roads. Only then the question comes to mind why the hell they wait so long before they start repairing. But most important we started and ended with some rollerjammin' on some funky music and that, for sure, was the main reason we were all present.  Fell asleep only half an hour after I got home, about 8 pm. Would not expect anything else after skating this last wednesday, thursday, friday, and sunday with an average of 6 hours a day. Really tired now, got to get some rest. I'm off to Bareclona in a few hours, needless to say but I say it anyway: WITH skates!!

      This is sick!! Last night I had myself a relaxing evening, doing nothing for a change, just my remote control in one hand and some lemonade in the other. By the time it was 11 pm I started to get ready for bed, brushed my teeth....and put my skates on. Started dancin', tried some of my new steps. 1 am I plumped down on my couch. 15 minutes later I climbed my bed with my eyes already half closed. Gosh, I must be really tired, my feet do feel heavy....stupid bitch forgot to take off her skates.

      So I'm a smart one. Everyone is fairly tired from celebrating Queensday yesterday. Going to bed way too late with quite likely some alcohol to wear off. I did my celebrating the day before and so got into bed very early (and very tired by the way) so I could at least make it trough the Masterclass, which is more important to me then spending the evening before on the streets and in cafes trying to make conversation when everyone else is too drunk to even stand up straight.   Normally we have the first part of warming up our muscles, balance-exercises and endurance training. Now listen carefully: since this is Masterclass, it is not to be compared with the Thursday 45 minute Calypso lesson. You need to have stamina to complete only the first hour of this Masterclass. A beginner (just starting out and not yet in control of the basic steps) will flunk completely. The pace is much quicker (not the music). Calypso lessons will take it slow, first the basic parts of 1 move, then in the complete step in slow motion and then in full speed if you can keep up.  Masterclasses starts at full speed with Lawrence, no slow explanation, no slow-motion (this is only when new steps are taught). The warming-up does not consist of 10 x times 'the forward' and then for fun let's say 5 x the 'groovy'. No can do. 3 full minutes of 'the flip' continued by 3 full minutes of 'the groovy' followed by 3 full minutes of a flip-groovy combination. Then a shake of the legs and quickly moving on to a full 3 minutes of sideward. This goes on and on with all sorts of combinations. Of course we bend and stretch a lot in between for a few minutes but even these stretching-to-the-limit exercises will tire you. Then after about 50 minutes..., trust me you are totally warmed up. We take a break for about 10 minutes and then Brian takes over. In general hes the one that teaches us new exercises, the dance steps and the synchs. So besides having the stamina and the physical condition to make it trough the first hour, you also need to have the enthusiasm to learn more, the technical skills to make the steps happen, the fun and memory to do the synchs, the mental force not to give up if it doesn't work out the first time you try, and last but not least the funk to work the body.  Due to certain circumstances, this lesson was not led by an equally divided amount of time between both my Quadsk8 teachers the way it usually is, but for most of the time it was led by Brian. And that is a bit different. Everybody was already worried and expected the worst because the warming-up and endurance training takes place simultaneously with the dance steps, synchs and new exercises. Which consequently means...you start at full throttle and go on like this for two hours in a row. We had one lesson before like this and in the end we were deadbeat. He was so very kind in giving us some breathing time in between, to keep the liquids in our body leveled, the consumption of some sort of sportsdrink is heaven by then, but no longer than 2 minutes at a time. After 2 hours of pumpin' trucks, poundin' floorchipping and grindin' the wheels (although he said he wouldn't make it as hard this time 'cause of queensday the day before), everybody was deadbeat again. Some even stopped a few minutes earlier but not I, I refuse to let myself down. But we all enjoyed the lessons again and learned some new steps and synchs to practice at home. Everytime I end my classes on these Saturdays and regain my breath with a feeling of satisfaction I know why they call it Masterclass!  For your information Masterclass is NOT an obligation in any way, but a commitment you can make with yourself, to come and follow the lessons if you want to. You can quit any time you like. But in case you haven't noticed yet:  Not planning on doing anything like that. Having way too much fun building up my iron discipline!

      The dream: Sk8ing around, doing a performance of a sort. Jumping up and down. The Groovy works its way in upspeed tempo, my Scissor is razorsharp, my pirouettes are inimitable. Then  The Twist ,but not a regular twist, is a twist on the side of my wheels. So my leftskate is balancing on the edge of the two left-outside wheels and my rightskate is balancing on the edge of the two left-inside wheels. If you cannot visualize the picture check  urlLink this wallpaper . If you look at the center you´ll catch my drift. So that´s count 1, on the second count I shift to leftskate-edge-inside-wheels and rightskate-edge-outside-wheels. Then back again, but because it´s a moving twist I have to jump slightly, so I end up about 1 ft. to the right of my original starting position. Now that´s count 3. Continued this 4 times and finished with a pirouette on the two back wheels of 1 skate. The other leg is lifted whilst making the full 2 turns of my pirouette. Then repeat this drill again to the other side. Can you see it?? Doesn't it look funky?  The reality: Last saturdayevening....balancing my leftskate and my right on two wheels each.  And then...uhm...I'm still standing balancing..okay..I have to shift now....still standing...balancing..my ankles..ouch my ankles..still standing...balancing..gotta shift...NOW..still..balancing..F*CK!  Okay, jump back to 8 wheels on the floor then. SHIIIIT!!! Gotta get back to bed! Keep on dreaming honey!

      Regretting having no rollerdisco or rollerrink to call my home. Luckily today (as I watch the time, I'd have to say yesterday) summer has officially begun. Outdooractivities and events are quite planned now. I just flipped through my agenda. In July and August I have no Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, they are all reserved for my curricular activities :-D Wednesdaynightskate, Fridaynightskate and Sundayskateswing. And out of precaution I just reserved my Saturdays too. Always will find something to do somewhere. And if I don't I'll just be the wanderer on wheels rollin' down the streets.

      Needed a day to comprehend what happened last thursday...when I think back my heart makes a jump. Two weeks ago I was allready on a roll but the day before yesterday I was floating on air. Normally on thursdays I go to HyperHyper, only a block away from my home, at 10 pm after fixing me a light meal and a nap. Last thursday the weather was too just to fine to stay in. So when I got home from work I put my gear on and left to go skate outdoors. Something felt different, I was in a very good mood so that must have helped. Due to a 3 days rest after my UK adventure I was more then ready for some 'local' groovin'. Passed by HyperHyper very early and in lack of anything better to do then skating I popped in. They were playing some music from their private cd collection because it won't get busy 'till their 1st DJ shows up around 11 pm. The funk for mind, body, soul & skates was buzzin' me. So at 8 pm I was allready pumpin' trucks. Every step worked, every turn swirled, every jump felt like having wings on my shoulder and the add up total felt like a burst of explosion. The 'gang' showed up at around 10-10.30 pm and it is very clear everybody is getting better and better as time moves on. We were taught a new sync, we all learned very quickly and within 15 minutes we were synchronized. We have a whole summer of outside activities we all will be attending and its's great practice before the new season when lessons start again in September this year.  At 1.30 am I went home really, really tired. All the effort I put into the skating the last months results into a feeling of extreme happiness and a peace within. Feeling this way about my skating also leaves its signs in my everyday life. Want to hold on to this because it's mindblowin'. Like I said in my first story; skating gives me so much more than just a simple pleasure. When I enter my world of skating it's a vigorous world...I boost and evolve on my own strenght...

      &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     So my prayers were heard. From the moment we set foot on UK ground 'till the moment we left the isle, Mother Nature granted us the sun to shine the whole 4 days. Considering all the compliments we gratefully excepted we must have made quite an impression, the 13 of us.  So first jamsession was at Bagleys Studios, London; 3 'rinks' (inverted commas because they were not that big) with different kinds of music. Our hangout most of the evening was the disco-funk-soul oldies dancefloor. Everybody just stared at us almost with their mouth open. Strange experience to be the centre of attraction, we differ from other skatedancers... that must be it. It only makes it more clear we have something special to show the world hahahaha. We all get together lots of times to skate around, do our dance and enjoy the music, usually caught up in our own group-groove. Somewhere in the back of our minds we know we are eyecatchers, but being in a different country, our presence there were we are supposed to be (in rollerdisco's), we realized we really heated up the local scene with our thang!!  Second day we had the daytime to ourselves. I sneaked out alone and went wandering down the streets of London and bought some souvenirs in the Soho area for my best of friends and for myself as a reminder of London and the great time I was having.  That evening it was Colchester Rollerrink. Now THAT I call a rink!! Apart from the lasergaming, bowlingalleys and pooltables, there was a rink made from Canadian Maplewood with a size of at least 2000 square yards (this is just an estimate of my guess). For rollerjammin' we don't need this kind of space, but the Canadian Maplewood was soooooooooo very smooooth. Skated around like crazy, and great for practising skating backwards too. I normally don't get to do that much often for there are ALWAYS obstacles in the way like trees, pickets, lantarnposts, a baby's buggy, small children, fences or hedges. Again we made another big impression. Met  urlLink Jennifer  and Eric from  urlLink Team Riedell  was also present for a demo, we were very enthusiastic because they have a totally different style called jamskating. They have a lot of breakdance moves and you have to have very, very strong armmuscles to do that kinda shit. Of course they taught us the basics, we connected right away for we all have the same passion. We had a great time and of course took some pictures together.  Third day was the trip to Eastbourne for the Eastbourne Skatefestival 2004. We did not catch a great deal of the Skatefestival itself, because we arrived late. Afer checkin' in a beautiful hotel with an oceanview we skated along the boulevard, got ourselves something to eat and ended up in the fortress where the rollerdisco took place. So here we are at an openair disco, a perfect temperature, music and the best of moods, all of us. Suddenly we found ourselves creating a circle and cheer eachother on to move across the circle in a fancy, funny, groovy, boogie, stupid or jumpin' kind of way. This was videotaped and can be nothing else but great!!! As I looked back on it...it was an unexplainable group-thing. We were all riding the same wavelenght at that very moment. Mmm...very good memento. And for the third time we made a big impression, including of course the inline skaters that were present doing their dancetricks too. Totally knocked out I fell asleep and jumped out early for a perfect breakfast. It was 10 am and we were about to leave at 1.00 pm. YES, you guessed right, we put our skates on for a ride along the boulevard. Made some more videotakes, guess these will be used as  urlLink promotionmaterial for Quadsk8 .  Getting into London trafficjams, crammed beds in a youth hostel although it was fun, late-night Shut-The-Fuck-Ups, getting out of Central London trafficjams, wrong turns, diversion-straight ahead, Suburb London trafficjams, everybody knows better (with a group of 13...), roundabouts with 1 entry and 1 exit ?, a burst tyre, freeway to anywhere trafficjams, hungry stomaches, out of order cashwithdrawelmachines, stupid Pounds instead of Euro's, just a regular trafficjam, 1 bus with NO airconditioning and 1 Volkswagon WITH airconditiong, lots & lots of driving with trafficjams, demolished showercurtains, and a forgotten jacket with a cellular phone! It's of no significance compared to the wonderful time I had with all of them!!  urlLink Thxs y'all . Keep the groove on!

      Going to the UK in about 7 hours :-). Skating of course! A group of 14, organised by Quadsk8, will be travelling to London. First night out is the Thursday Rollerdisco at Canvas, Bagley's Studios in London, second night out will be BoogieNights in Rollerworld, Colchester, third day we'll be driving to Eastbourne for the Eastbourne Skatefestival 2004. This coming Saturdayevening there is an open air rollerdisco in some sort of a fortress. Afterwards some chillin' at the beach, then I guess a short but good nights sleep back home on Sunday. Maybe, just maybe, back in time for the second  urlLink Sunday SkateSwing  at the Museumpark. Last sunday the weather was great and a sort of kick-off of the summerseason. Just got home from the Wednesdaynightskate, jammin' on some f*cking rocky streetpavement. Got my hand bruised but allright, got skates on my feet and all is well. My bag is packed and I'm ready to go. Got to get some rest now, although I won't be able to sleep, too excited.   Dear light of sun, you're the only thing missin' right now. Start shining today and don't you leave before the end of September.

      Last evening was bliss!!! Got funked outta my pants watching  urlLink George Clinton and P.Funk . Now this is music I´ve known since I was just a toddler. Yesterday evening I brought someone with me who never heard of George Clinton. But during the concert I heard her utter a continuous Oooh...now I know and Aaah...so this is the original?? Started singing with wrong lyrics for these are the lyrics she knows to these songs ;-)   Had a rough week and especially a rough day, so was really looking forward to this evening. Needed some mind, body &amp; soulinjection. Stood in front of the stage and from the first second I was a part of the whole and drawn into a beautiful feeling of complete happiness. It was a parteeee!!!!! Words cannot describe how I felt for that following two hours. Will not even try to so I will quote my friend;   After the concert my friend was kinda quiet and I asked her what was wrong and if she did enjoy the concert. She said to me: "I´m shivering all over, never ever knew how deep you can feel music within. I think it´s so very cool you brought me with you, I don´t know George Clinton but I love that man, wish I had a granddadda like that!!! Would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, for you have broadened my musical horizon."  The private life bitches the skate activities. If I´m smart I should be skating more in order to forget the nastyness of life. The feeling of yesterdayevening made THAT so much more clear. Gonna get up my gear and start 2night!!

      One of the funniest things happened to me last wednesday. I was visiting a dear friend of mine. We don't see eachother on a regular bases, but we always find the time once in a while to catch up, see and listen what we've been up to. Haven't spoken with him for the last 5 months, so of course I had to explain what I have been doing lately. Gave him this URL so he can read all about it. I gave him a short proloque of what to expect and out of the blue he tells me he's an oldskool skater from way, way back. I'm talking about 25 years or so. Me flabbergasted and not sure we were talking about the same subject, he jumps up and starts searching for what he claims to be his old rollerskates. And there under a thick layer of dust, completely decomposed boots with Krypto wheels like eggs from intense usage, his beloved skates saw daylight again after 20 long years. "Oh what the hell, I'll put 'em back on again. It's been a while, let's see if I can still stand straight without smashing facedown on the floor." He staggered for about 10-15 seconds and with any further doubt he starts doing the scisorss, the flip, the groovy and a carefull but quite steady pirouette. My jaw dropped!! Then showed me some moves, not that smooth anymore but for sure like an oldskoolskater!! D*mn I've known him for 10 years now, and strangely enough did not take him for a rollerskater. Since the day I met him he was always in the good company of his beloved skateboard or his even more beloved Harley Davidson.  So that's how his story goes. Started as a rollerskater, spending about all his spare time on the streets with some good music, dance and skates. By the end of the '70s when rollerskating became to be a hype, he traded his rollerskates for a skateboard.  He got very excited while strutting around on his ragged old skates and hollered with a smile on his face: "Oh man, this brings back memories." Promised he would come see me soon and watch how rollerjammers nowadays do their 'thang'. He's been working real hard for the last few years to get  urlLink his business  going, and with succes, spending all his time on this Passion with a capital P as in T for Tattoo.   Dear Les, I will never drive faster then my guardian angel can fly. Grtz and CU soon!
