       Where do political media and backroom politicos go for their info?  Online!  We live in a digital age, so it's no surprise that millions of people are surfing the internet ever single second.  What's more interesting is how engaged voters have become now that politics has moved online. There is a lot of information out there for anyone whose inclined to find it, by how does a young "generation-next" Canadian really know where to go?  Whether you're seeking the straight up on US politics, or Canadian, there are really just a handful of sites that I would reccomend.  First of off, most Canadian politicos keep abreast of there neighbors to the south, and I won't even start my morning blog until I have read  The Note.  ABC News' Mark Halperin is one of the finist bloggers in political history, and gives a complete daily rundown of what's happening in the world of politics.  No one on the hill (be it Parliament, or Washington DC) blinks until they've read it. It's become a political daily bible in a way, and I would highly reccomend bookmarking it immediatly if you follow US politics.   visit http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/TheNote/TheNote.html    But if it's the Canadian political scene you seek, there's one place that has it all  The Hill Times, a newspaper published weekly in Ottawa, you can also visit it online at    www.thehilltimes.ca    I find it to be an exceptional paper devoted to all things politically Canadian.  Great read, and essential if you want to know what's  really  going on.    I also highly reccomend Dooney's Cafe (   www.dooneyscafe.com   ) for an alternative newssource that fuses both Canadian politics and US politics.  My friend and colleague Mr. Max Fawcett adds a nice touch of wit and intellect on a weekly basis, and generation next politicos from all over will appreciate it.  So with 30 days until E-day in Canada, get on the net for the real deal.  You'll find that surfing is now an information term, and not just a california way of life.

        "All great ideas seem dangerous, at first" - Oscar Wilde     Jack Layton's NDP are moving ideas to the forefront.   He's more left than Martin, more right than the Green Party, and his poll numbers, while not leading the pack, are indicative of a leader on the rise.  In his new book  "Speaking Out: Ideas That Work For Canadians"   Jack Layton is campaigning on a different level than Martin and Harper.  He's actually campaigning on ideas, and it's actually a good book!  Without letting my daily blog turn into a book review, or an NDP massage parlor, I would recommend reading it, assuming you can stomach left wing policy.  He proposes a lot of new ideas in his book, some just polished versions of past policy, but nevertheless, they're ideas.  Thank god.  I've been waiting for someone to tell me how to fix the problem, not just what the problem actually looks like.  While many people will have their own attack on his ideas -- keep in mind, he's presenting Canada with  his way  to fix it -- and to me that carries so much more than the restless rants of those who are part of the problem.  I've been asked by many people to define my political leanings, and these days, it's tough. I was raised Liberal, but must admit that lately I feel more "left-wing" than actually Liberal. I've always been left. Each new party leader injects their own politics into a party, so it's always changing.   While I support most of the Liberal Party initiatives, I have to admit I'm smitten with young Jack.  He's missing the passion of Ed Broadbent, but seems to compensate for it with charm and with principled ideals.   At a time where Martin and Harper are being seen for who they really might be -- I dare Canada to take a chance on Jack.    During the NDP Leadership campaigns just under a year ago, I remember meeting with Jack at the Hyatt Regency, and talking politics near the bar.  I found him articulate, if not rehearsed, but genuinely sincere.  To say he had charisma might be a stretch, but he did display an ability to control the debate, and was a perfect gentleman.  He appeared genuinely interested in my political ideas, despite knowing I was a Liberal.  If I were a strategist for the NDP (and I'm not) I would strongly advise a re-branding.  NDP  carries too many associations with big unions, and over-taxing/over-spending.  I would propose that they become  The Democratic Party of Canada , and move forward on a new left-wing agenda as the Liberals move ever closer to the centre.  I could live with being called a Democrat.  More than that though, they've taken the first step and elected a man with a real chance, and with some real ideas.  As I get older, I've realized a man is only as good as his ideas, and whether or not he has what it takes to convert them to action.  I believe Jack Layton is such a man, and I've been impressed with his recent ad campaign.  He avoided going negative, and instead promoted the new NDP party platform -- look for them on CBC, CTV and Newsworld.    No experience, and no proven track record beyond Toronto city couuncil, he might not be ready just yet.  Jack, you've got a tough road ahead, and a party that desperately needs some credibility among middle income earners in Canada, but I believe you to be capable.  Your recent cover of a gay Toronto magazine demonstrated to me a kind of tolerance and progressive thinking we really need right now, and I applaud it.     The big fight will have to wait however, first he needs to beat a pro. If Dennis Mills has his way in Toronto-Danforth, "you won't know Jack!".   A prominent veteran MP, Dennis Mills is no doubt looking forward to keeping Jack from his destiny.  I'll be watching that fight closely.  My friend and fellow strategist Max Fawcett tells me Dennis Mills is no push-over, and I believe it.  It's a shame that Canadians have given Stephen Harper the credibility he does not deserve, by calling him the alternative to Paul Martin.  I really wish this were an election between Jack and Paul, because Canada has been longing for a long overdue ideas debate.  In the end, you need to read his book, and visit his website   ( wwww.jacklayton.ca )  to learn more, but if all you want is an honest guy with some potential solutions -- now you know Jack.

       Why do Americans love it when Canadians defect?   While I work with Americans, and love their spirit, and individuality, I'm an equally proud Canadian.  I watched in  disgust as Sunday night saw the betrayal one of our great hockey players, Mr. Luc Robitaille, as he sold his soul to the devil.   MSNBC  is a news station I can stomach more than most, but Dennis Miller's Sunday night varsity panel couldn't have had a more upsetting effect on my digestive tract.  Watching a Canadian proudly touting his American citizenship is painful, and disappointing.  To make a long story short, three panelists joined Miller on his show to discuss and debate the hot topic of the day.  Sunday's topic was "The Draft" and whether or not the American military should bring it back. Robitaille, who in my opinion shouldn't even be on TV to talk about hockey, let alone US Military policy, offered some idiotic words on behalf of Canadians.   "I think it's everyone's duty to protect freedom.  I've lived in the US for many years, and America is a great country.  I know many people from my country want to live here."    Are you joking me?  How many times have you been hit in the head? WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE THERE!  Robitaille, on behalf of Canada -- you're an idiot.       That is one of the stupidest things I've heard , and living in Vancouver I can tell you it's probably the other way around these days.  What's worse is pop culture shows like  The Simpsons  have branded Canada as America Jr. or the  West Wing's  remark that Canadians display an "inferiority complex" are all too common in American media.  Pamela Anderson was one of our more recent high profile US defections, and thank god she did.  We're known for our mountains in BC, no longer will people confuse them with Anderson's chest!  It seems that these high profile defections are often the result of Hollywood careers or pro sports contracts, and that suits me fine.  I can appreciate anyone who pursues the almighty dollar to maximize their standard of living, and care for their family.  But for god's sake -- Canadians would love to be Americans?   Why do so many Americans use a Canadian flag patch on their traveling bags overseas?  The answer is all too obvious.  We pride ourselves as being Canadian, and very un-American, and displaying a more casual Liberal view of our society.  There is a degree of manners unseen anywhere else in the world when you set foot on Canadian soil.  I'm proud to be a Canadian where I'm even more free than an American.  I can smoke a joint, marry a guy and burn my flag if I want -- and that, despite it's controversy, is what defines Canada.  Tolerance.  No matter where you stand, or what you think -- it's easier to say it in Canada.  I'd like to see America one-up us on that one.    Canada does tolerance bigger and better.   God keep our land glorious and free.....   Canada has long been a place of free speaking people, and a sense of silent pride.  We dont' need to waive our flag around and annoy the world with an overdose of patriotism.  Silent pride is perhaps the most Canadian of our attributes.  We let our society do the talking.    You'll never see Canadian media ramming US emmigration to Canada down anyone's throat -- and those are numbers that would really surprise you.   So in the end, Robitaille - stay in the US. You're doing great there, and we honestly didn't even know you really left.   But keep your mouth shut, and don't speak for Canadians, because last night, we all wanted to throw you in the penalty box.  CB

       My last McSupper was a religious experience.......   I knew even before I went and saw the film  "Super Size Me"  I might never eat at McDonald's again, so it was critical that I get at least one last bite of a quarter pounder immediately.  It was a heavenly experience, and I'll always remember it as a special moment.   There is something special about your first time, but your last time is also special in it's own right .  The same holds true for a cheeseburger!   Alas, I have given up McDonald's for good.   I have made a choice.  I write here in my column, I'm done,  this is my McGood-bye.   "Super Size Me" was a film that took a fast food experiment to the extreme, as documentarian Morgan Spurlock ate three square McDonald's meals a day - for a month.  Ominously, 37% of American children and adolescents are carrying too much fat and 2 out of every three adults are overweight or obese. Do we as a McSociety lack basic self-control or are the fast food corporations to blame?   At what point do we demand more investigation, and accountability about the dangers and physical harm of fast food from our governments?   Should we at all?  Why are  more people not alarmed by the fact that 70% of our population is at risk of dying from a preventable cause?  This statistic tells me we're  McIdiots .  The film also discusses the dangers and horrors of school lunch programs, the decline in  health and physical education classes among North American students, and food addictions .    We have become a society truly focused on sick-care NOT health-care.   I believe a government that has not explored the costs associated with treating preventable diseases is not concerned with healthcare.  If they are, it's nothing more than campaign fluff, as they work to lock down voter support.  Why is there no exploratory senate committee reporting about the affects of fast food toxins on Canadians?  Sick-care, on the other hand, is policy that is already too late, as last year 400 thousand Americans died of fast-related diseases, usually heart disease.  (Source: Supersize Me)   It is speculated by many academics that the recent trend of litigation in the US against fast food companies is indicative of a turning point in their evolution.  They have become the enemy now, much like big tobacco.    What was also frightening was the exploration of the branding and subliminal marketing that takes place by companies like McDonald's to lure and attract new customers, as young as 3 years old.  This is appalling to me, and I condemn it.  When you look at the scientific evidence of opiates (addictive chemical property) found in cola, cheeseburgers, and sundae's mixed with a McPlayplace gym a-la Ronald McDonald, a 4 year old brain is no match for it.  They're hooked.  This isn't right, and I am curious as to where these new investigations will lead our society.  Are we now beginning the assualt on fast food like we have been on big tobacco?  I hope so.    Do I want an MP to lead the charge against fast food, and destroy McDonald's to earn my vote and respect?  No, of course not.  We have bigger fish to fry.  Cancer and AIDS related diseases are quickly killing thousands of Canadians a year.  I stress also that that North American deaths and illnesses related to fast food are indeed preventable.  Why are people needlessly putting themselves at risk?  We as citizens need to guard our own health first.  It is our responsibility, no one else's.  But I do believe in learning the truth, and finding out things they don't tell us.  I want to know more about what these companies really know.  Those of you that know me, are aware of my intolerance for corporate greed and irresponsibility.  If this film did nothing else, it served to reinforce my anger, and informed all who saw it of the McTruth.  Disclosure: I was formerly a fast food junkie, enjoying burgers and fries like most North Americans.  I would consume fast food at least twice a week.  Adrienne has been working hard to keep me "green" to balance my diet.

       It's Tony Kuo's party, and he'll cry if he wants to   If failed Burnaby-Douglas nominee Tony Kuo says "It's a sad day for democracy" with tears in his eyes one more time, I'm going to throw up.   Tony:  We hear you. We agree with you.  It sucks that Bill Cunningham got appointed.  Crying will get you nowhere.   The reality is that loyalty plays a prominent role in politics today, and is usually rewarded with opportunity.  Bill Cunningham must have one loyal friend to get a free ride on this trip.  Paul Martin made it clear that loyalty would be rewarded (appointments) to certain candidates, and unfortunately it wasn't Tony's day.  Tony Kuo signed up over a thousand new members to the Liberal Party, and what did he get? A democracy pie right in the face.  I spoke to my good friend, and political strategist Max Fawcett about this very subject the other night.  Max has always been the epitome of loyalty, having recently worked with him on Taleeb Noormohamed's Van-Centre campaign.  Max has been a loyal member of Toronto MP Dennis Mills camp for many years, and is an up and coming backroom strategist in his own right.  He's currently in Toronto working with Dennis to keep NDP leader Jack Layton out of parliament.   "Loyalty, as with most things, isn't an absolute. The current leaders of our Liberal Party are rewarding their friends, often to the detriment of others, but this is a form of loyalty in its own way. I suppose we'll just have to wait and see if these kinds of decisions influence the loyalty that Canadian voters have shown us over the past eleven years."   I couldn't have said it better myself.  You can read Max's column at  Dooney's Cafe  each week at  http://www.dooneyscafe.com/   His recent article  "Betting On Canada"  is sure to get political junkies talking.  As of last night, the Burnaby-Douglas riding association demonstrated a kind of loyalty of their own, as they all unanimously agreed to step down in protest of the recent un-democratic process.  None could be reached for comment, but suffice to say Bill Cunningham is now at risk for paying the ultimate price for loyalty.  It looks like the Green Party may now officially have a chance at winning the seat in Burnaby-Douglas!  Tony Kuo deserves a shot, as all candidates do, and the Prime Minister needs to rethink his stance on the "democratic deficit" if he really wants a mandate from Canadians. If I was Kuo's chief advisor, I'd be advising him very strongly to run as an independent, and quit wasting his time on CTV Newsdesk crying to Tony Parsons.    He signed up over 1000 people!    He's an electible candidate for god's sake, who has time for all these tears?  Surely he has more than enough votes to take on shamed MP Svend Robinson and Martin appeaser Bill Cunningham?  Hell, Jack Layton would probably let him hop on the NDP wagon if he worked it right.    But sadly, I would bet this is near the end of Tony Kuo's incredible journey, and the reality is that there just doesn't appear to be a political animal inside of him that has any desire to really run, beyond sniffling on TV and berating the Prime Minister. It's a crying shame...........  You can visit Tony Kuo's website at  http://www.tonykuo.ca/English/defaultEng.html

       Sometimes The Truth Hurts   Going Negative has always had a bad rap in Canadian political campaigns, and it's damn shame.  This morning I had a phone call with Mr. Warren Kinsella, a great liberal strategist in exile, and we talked about going negative.  Warren Kinsella was one of the key architects in former Prime Minister Jean Chretien's electoral victories.  In his book  "Kicking Ass In Canadian Politics",  Kinsella talks about the history of negative campaigning, and the merits and problems associated with it.  Warren is a respected friend and also a hero of mine.  He helped brand the backroom to young politicos and he demonstrated that the guys in the back are critical to the success of the candidate at the front.  He made it exciting, and he made it fun.  As Blair's campaign seeks to unseat John Reynolds, the reality is that the Reform/Alliance MP is an incumbent, and we have to win votes from ideas and good positioning.  You can't win a campaign by simply going negative on your opponent.     Is it going negative if it's revealing the truth?  Warren would argue it isn't, and voters need to know the truth.  I would agree.  Going negative is usually considered slanderous and accusatory.   Telling the truth is telling the truth.   There needs to be an equal balance of ideas and truth on both sides.    Kinsella warned me this morning that it's easy to go negative, but there are lot of fools who can't back it up.  The famous "Barney The Dinosaur" bit he pulled on TV during Stockwell Day's leadership campaign only had impact because it was presented after a CBC documentary revealed him to be a beleiver in creationist theory.   "Don't lead with negative"  he advised.   "lead with ideas first".   Good advice indeed.  However, going negative is a tool, and it can be a very effective one.  So for all you lightweights out there filled with sunshine and rainbows hoping to run "a clean campaign" where no punches are thrown, get real.  Politics demands the truth, and so does a working democracy.  The reality is that, short of Mother Theresa, no candidate is perfect and many of our potential leaders won't tell you what they really think, or what they'd really do.  Hold them accountable, and ensure your voters know who they're voting for, on both sides.  Sometimes going negative is the only way to ensure voters get the facts.  Attacks and slanderous ads demonstrate a lack of character and integrity.  Voters know that.  But a strong negative campaign can reveal the truth behind an opponents agenda, and enable voters to make a more informed decision on election day.  Warren Kinsella and Chretien were two guys who didn't back away from a tough fight, and Personally, I love a good honest fight, and going negative makes it a lot more interesting.....

       Voter Apathy is just Political Disassociation in Drag   CBC's "Screw The Vote" was hosted by "Play" personality Jian Ghomeshi, and took a satirical look at Canadian voter pathy as our nation prepares for the next federal election.     "Let Others Decide Your Future"  was the statement du jour. Ghomeshi crossed the country to expose the rampant apathy between today's youth and our elected officials.  While his comical if not obvious point was made, it's dangerous to assume that we can define absent voters with such a simple idea as "Voter Apathy"   "In the last federal election, 25% of eligible voters cast a ballot supporting the elected party"  (Source: CBC www.cbc.ca/screwthevote/)  What does this statistic tell us that we don't already know?  Voter apathy has always been the target of new leadership campaigns, usually around election time if I recall. But with each new decade, their efforts are made in vain.  The problem is that Apathy isn't the problem, it's a symptom of the problem, and our leadership hopefuls fail to grasp the true cause of low voter turn-out.  Disassociation is a disease that is crippling poling stations from riding to riding, and there's only one cure: Education.  That's right, I said education. Imagine that.     My theory:  A more informed voter is more likely to associate with a candidate and/or their ideas of better governance.   We can MTV our country to death with flashbulb images of Paul Martin in a leather jacket, or we can face the reality that apathy is purely a by-product of political disassociation.  We don't identify with Paul Martin!  Who does?  Canadians under 35 don't believe their vote will make a difference, or rather they  think  it won't.  The political frustration voiced on  Screw The Vote  was largely the result of poor understanding of government, and a confusion of powers, and demonstrates that there is a clear ignorance as to what government actually can do.  One Toronto suburban was angry that the government isn't doing anything about "the crime in his hood" so why should he vote in the federal election?  Sadly, his ignorance wasn't his fault.  It also served to show us that there's not one potential Prime Minister in the bunch we really think speaks for us.  Herein lies the problem, but also the solution.  If the government is serious about increasing voter turnout, they must first show voters what they can actually do, and on what levels.  Present us with real solutions and real ideas.  They don't have to be perfect, we're just looking for an effort here!  How many voters really know the responsibilities of the federal government versus the provincial government?  Not many I can assure you.  To do this will require a serious investment in modern education techniques, and I'm not talking social studies, or government classes in high school.  Think internet and television, the modern mediums of communication.  That' the language generation next speaks today.  Canadians need to learn to speak government again -- and it needs to be engaging, sexy and smart all at once!  Next, reduce the voting age to 16 and reach out to young Canadians before MTV does. Engage them with ideas and opportunities and you'll see voters you never saw before.  Surely a country that prides itself on progressive thinking can see the inherent benefits of younger voters, can't it?  We need younger candidates as well, not  "a bunch of geriatrics who don't give a shit about me"  as one young skater so eloquently pointed out.  At the end of the day, we're still left with the reality that voters don't turn out to the polls because they don't associate with their electable options. While my ideas may help better inform potential voters, and maybe even motivate them, we're all still left wondering where our next Trudeau is, and whether or not we should just screw the vote.   --Christopher Bennett

       When was the last time your political candidate stopped a burglary?   I first met Blair Wilson at a lunch with my Mentor, Mr. William J Kurchak.  My mentor is an interesting guy.  An accomplished speechwriter and strategist, he's worked for Trudeau, Preston Manning, and most recently former Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Manley. To say Bill has an eye for great politicians would be an understatement.  Blair was a young CA running for the Liberal nomination in West Van and was looking to put a team together to go all the way to Ottawa. Bill was very impressed with Blair from the start, so I joined his communications team on Bill's command, always eager for a good political fight.  I'm no stranger to political campaigns, and this is the 2nd I've worked with Bill in communications.  Blair seemed fresh, young, and void of the usual traits we so often associate with modern politicians - I was eager to work for him.  We worked hard, pounded out the nomination fight and took it, despite being the underdog.   I liked that about Blair, I bet he's been the underdog before - it seems to make him work harder.  He's also a winner, and seemingly successful at everything he's ever done.    What makes him exciting to work with on a communications level is he understands timing. When he and Bill bang out a great speech together, it's magic because Blair not only  delivers  the message -- he  believes  the message. You can feel it in his rhythm and timing.  On Saturday, Blair took good timing to the extreme while he was on the campaign trail, meeting voters in a West Vancouver neighborhood -  and stopped a burglary in the process!   No joke, he stopped a burglary!  He noticed the door wide open with a window smashed and stepped inside the door, hoping everything was alright. What he also did was scare the hell out two burglars in the middle of a B&E.  They ran and the police were called.  In short, Blair Saved the day.  The whole event got me thinking about that old saying "What have you done for me lately".  The apathetic Canadian voter tends to view their elected officials with much the same cynicism.  I suppose this was a great start for Blair who no doubt earned the votes of two West Vancouver citizens the hard way!  If this isn't a sign of a super-candidate on the rise, I don't know what is.  Some guys have to learn timing, and practice at it everyday.  Then there's guys like Blair, who are simply born with it.  I knew this campaign was going to be exciting, but I had no idea it would get this good...........

       Splitting Up is Hard To Do.     I know all about break ups these days........  Like parents who’ve lost that loving feeling, the left is slowly breaking up, and showing their true colors.  The NDP and Liberal Alliance seems like a distant memory as their policy books and platforms were realeased to the public just weeks ago.  We can see the left for who they really are,or rather, who Layton and Martin are.    On June 28th, Canadians will go to the polls and either crown a Liberal Prime Minister, or a Conservative one. While Jack Layton's NDP are moving more right, to actually left, his popularity is growing, as Paul Martin's is sinking.  The danger that we face as young Canadians right now is that by voting for Jack, (who would need at least 35 seats to even be considered for a coalition government – which won’t happen)  we’re splitting the left wing vote, and handing the country to a Conservative Albertan separatist who is pro-life, and supports the death penalty.   Think about that for a minute.   This scares the hell out of me.   Paul Martin, by comparison has become a centrist Prime Minister, and brought the ever left Liberals to the middle of the political line, as Jean Chretien looks on in sorrow from the left.  A sad day for Red Liberals, but he’s certainly not the first PM to do so.  When the left was married, it was an insurance policy for liberal Canadians, who could count on a left leaning mandate and agenda to lead our nation into the future.  Now I fear that the battle between Martin and Layton is just what Harper wants, and by default, their battle would hand him the keys to 24 Sussex drive.    "Canada appears content to become a second-tier socialistic country, boasting ever more loudly about its economy and social services to mask its second-rate status, led by a second-world strongman appropriately suited for the task."   -- Stephen Harper, 2003    Our country can’t afford neo-Mulroney PM.  Like your education?  Expect cuts under Harper.  Like healthcare?  Expect Harper to privatize it so the wealthy can cut in line.  Like wars in Iraq?  Cool, if Harper were PM a year ago, it would Canadian soldiers dying for oil too.  Yeah, I'm a little biased, I can't stand the conservative mentality, and I miss the Joe Clark tories, famous for their progressive values.   We can’t afford their formula for a fiscal disaster as the many services and budget line items that make this nation great are cut like the filler in a saskatoon slaughterhouse.   Bit of graphic analogy for you?  Good, because you won’t even recognize your country under Harper.  I encourage all young Canadians, no matter what your party affiliation to visit this site before casting your ballot on June 28th.    http://www.stephenharpersaid.ca/   In this election, every vote will truly count, and I believe it just isn’t Layton’s time yet.  You’ve got to vote Liberal and ensure that at the least we are faced with a Liberal minority government, or I fear we are headed for national plastic surgery that will leave us scared, damaged, and looking more and more like the US with each year.   Breaking up is hard to do, so keep the left strong, for the sake of the kids!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   West Is Best, Ontario No Longer The Favorite Son   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  It’s the dance of the year – the cabinet shuffle. While there were some surprises, the day’s ceremonies had been predicted about a month ago.&nbsp; I’ve got mixed emotions about it all, not sure what I think of it yet.&nbsp; I’m pretty sure this cabinet was picked to look much like an all-star team instead of a seasoned group of veterans, able to do the job, but I’ll hold off final judgment.&nbsp; Maybe it’s still the fact that I miss the Chrétien style cabinet, or maybe I just haven’t grown into our new PM, but one thing’s for sure – West Coast Cabinet appointees look good!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I live in Vancouver-Centre, the greatest riding in Canada  (Next to London-West of Course Mom and Dad!) &nbsp; so you can imagine the opportunity that presents itself when you have 3 senior cabinet ministers within a 5 minute drive from 1188 Howe St. (4 if you count Raymond Chan from Richmond)  &nbsp;  There were a couple picks I hadn’t anticipated, and was pleased to see an old face back on the roster.&nbsp; I called my good friend, and fellow politico Max Fawcett this morning in Ottawa to get his take on it.&nbsp; Max is the President of Rainmaker Communications, and like myself, happy to see Dion back in cabinet:  &nbsp;    “I’m thrilled that Stephane Dion has  returned to cabinet as the Minister of the  Environment. He's a thoughtful, forward-thinking,  loyal Liberal who deserves to be in cabinet. It's good  to see that his talent was recognized after being left  out of the first Martin cabinet.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;    I couldn’t have said it better myself.&nbsp; Perhaps Max is alluding to &nbsp;the rifts formed during the Liberal “Civil War”, and if Dion can find his way into Martin’s Bedroom, surely other Chrétien Loyalists can too.&nbsp; Paul Martin never ceases to surprise me.  &nbsp;  Check out Rainmaker Communications Website at:   urlLink  http://www.rainmakercommunications.ca/what_we_do.html     &nbsp;   Who Made The Team/Who Got Cut:   &nbsp;  Gone are Bob Speller (Agriculture), Stan Keyes (Revenue), David Pratt (Defence), Hélène Scherrer (Canadian Heritage), Gar Knutson (New and Emerging Markets) and Rey Pagtakhan (Western Economic Diversification).  Newcomer Dosanjh takes over the crucial Health portfolio from Pierre Pettigrew, who moves to Foreign Affairs. Pettigrew replaces Bill Graham, who becomes national defence minister in lieu of Pratt.  Dryden takes on the Social Development portfolio from Liza Frulla, who moves to Canadian Heritage to replace the defeated Scherrer. Frulla takes on responsibility for the Status of Women file as well.  Martin left some big-name ministers out in the cold, including former environment minister David Anderson; former minister of state for financial institutions Denis Paradis; former minister of state for multiculturalism and status of women Jean Augustine; and Denis Coderre, who was once president of the Privy Council, but may come under some unpleasant scrutiny when the sponsorship inquiry resumes this fall.      Other high-profile appointments or changes:    Stephane Dion, Jean Chrétien's former intergovernmental affairs minister, is back in favour and in the cabinet after throwing himself wholeheartedly into helping re-elect Martin, who had demoted him. He is Canada's new environment minister.     Jean Lapierre, who left the Liberals in 1990 to help create the Bloc Québécois before returning to his old party at Martin's invitation, is transport minister and Quebec lieutenant.     Former Canfor executive David Emerson of British Columbia becomes industry minister.     Toronto-area MP John Godfrey will handle the new Infrastructure and Communities portfolio, which will play a key role in shoring up Liberal support in Canada's largest municipalities.     Scott Brison, who ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative party in the spring of 2003, then switched to the Liberal party in December after his old party merged with the Canadian Alliance, takes over the portfolio of Public Works, home of the sponsorship scandal.     Former transport minister Tony Valeri is the new government House leader in the House of Commons, an important role in a minority government as the Liberals negotiate with the opposition parties to move legislation through Parliament.     Stephen Owen moves from Public Works to Western Economic Diversification and also becomes minister of state for Sport.     Lucienne Robillard is the new intergovernmental affairs minister and president of the Privy Council, moving from Industry.     Tony Ianno was rewarded for beating NDP star Olivia Chow in Toronto Spadina, taking over the brand-new portfolio of minister of state for families and caregivers, under Dryden's social development portfolio.     Albina Guarnieri becomes the new veterans affairs minister.     Jacques Saada is the new minister of economic development for Quebec and minister responsible for the Francophonie.     Former veterans affairs minister John McCallum becomes minister of national revenue.     Andy Mitchell moves from Indian and Northern Affairs to Agriculture and Agrifood, taking on the troublesome mad cow disease file.  Former minister Andy Scott of New Brunswick is back in cabinet as minister of Indian and northern affairs.     Former labour minister Claudette Bradshaw is minister of state for human resources development.     Joe Fontana is the new labour and housing minister.  Mauril Bélanger becomes deputy leader of the government in the House of Commons and minister for official languages, as well as associate minister of national defence.     Raymond Chan is the new minister of state for multiculturalism.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   So where does the new-school Cabinet take us now?&nbsp; Only time will tell.&nbsp; One thing is for sure, this Cabinet is high on PR Sustainability, and falls short of the ability demanded by the Canadian people.&nbsp; We don’t want Martin’s friends running our government, we want the most able, and qualified leading our cabinet portfolios.&nbsp; Someone once said a nation gets the government it    deserves.&nbsp; What did I do to deserve this?

        CPAC Sucks   .   &nbsp;  Let's face it.&nbsp; It really, truly, sucks.&nbsp; I was watching CPAC with Kate, and as she fell asleep, I couldn't help but think most Canadians would probably rather be napping through it too.&nbsp; It's terrible!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In a recent survey of 10 random friends, NONE of them even knew it existed.&nbsp; Do you, the average Canadian, know about CPAC?&nbsp;   It's our national political channel, and it's usually found on channel 69.&nbsp; How ironic that such a sexual number as this one, is reserved for the most boring 24 hours of constant television, certain to diminish anyone's sex drive!&nbsp;    &nbsp;  The thing I love about CPAC, however, is that it is a secret testament to democracy and transparency in the western world.&nbsp; CANADA WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO TELEVISE OUR PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.&nbsp; Now if only we could give it a touch of "FOX TV", and we'd be in some serious ratings business!&nbsp;  &nbsp;    For those of you inclined to learn a little history, take note:    &nbsp;   CPAC was created by the cable industry in the Fall of 1992 as the Cable Parliamentary Channel, an experimental service whose primary mandate was to carry the House of Commons. In 1995, we were licensed by the CRTC as a national programming undertaking, and in 1996 they were re-launched as the Cable Public Affairs Channel to reflect an expanded schedule of unique public affairs programming.    1977 - Canada becomes the first country in the world to televise live Parliamentary debates, beginning with the Speech from the Throne by Queen Elizabeth II.      1979  - The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the federal broadcast regulator, grants the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) the exclusive license to provide the service.   1986  - Members of the Canadian cable television industry propose enhancing the Parliamentary Channel to include additional public affairs programming.   1988  - To further this objective, the CBC and the cable industry agree to build upon the original Parliamentary Channel to form the Canadian Parliamentary Channel (CPAC).   1990  - The House of Commons gives the CPAC proposal unanimous all-party support.   1991  - The CBC announces that it will cease funding the channel because of budget cut-backs. The House of Commons itself begins to pay for satellite transmission of its proceedings.   The annual cost to taxpayers is $2 million.   Early 1992 &nbsp;- A consortium of more than 30 Canadian cable companies forms to distribute the service, ensuring that millions of Canadian cable households would continue to receive House of Commons broadcasts at no cost to taxpayers or cable subscribers.   October 1992 &nbsp;- The consortium now known as the Cable Parliamentary Channel (CPAC) takes over operation of the channel.   September 1993 &nbsp;- In response to CPAC's application, the CRTC grants a short-term experimental broadcasting license, giving the channel the flexibility to develop further as a forum for public affairs programming.   January 20, 1995 &nbsp;- CPAC is granted a seven-year renewal of its broadcasting licenses commencing September 1, 1995. Under its agreement with the Speaker of the House of Commons, CPAC distributes live coverage of the House proceedings, then repeats the entire proceedings each day. The rest of the daily schedule is filled with long-form programming of conferences, speeches and proceedings from provincial legislatures  Who would have guessed there was so much history to such boring TV?&nbsp; So what can CPAC do to get you to actually watch it?&nbsp; For starters, take a cue from the recently reformed CTV -- give yourself a makeover!&nbsp; Add some hosts, and perhaps even some commentary to the standard senate committee meetings, or leadership conventions.&nbsp; Break down the political language for average Canadians, educate Canadians on why these events occur, and what it really means to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're eager to be more engaged than they think, and despite the open transparency in it's format -- it's not much good if we don't understand what the hell is going on!  I'm going to keep watching CPAC.&nbsp; For better or worse, I'm a political junkie, and can't get enough of it.&nbsp; But if voter apathy is ever going to be diminished, we have start romantisizing politics, and bring a little zap to this otherwise monotonous format of lame political TV.&nbsp;   Kate's got it right, time for a nap CPAC.

       Why Do Americans make such a fuss over Veep?               "The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided."    - US Constitution   Ahh...... Thank god. The DNC Convention is right around the corner, and in just few weeks, Boston will be hopping with the true political idealists.&nbsp; Red blooded democrats coming together for one singular cause:&nbsp; To nominate their candidates, and unseat President George W. Bush.&nbsp; Republicans, beware: John Edwards got the nod, and he can carry the south better than you think!   So why do Americans really make such a fuss over the VP candidate? CNN has had a political erection over the speculation for about 3 months now, and at what point do Canadians start to care about there own deputy prime minister, or understand the implications of such an overlooked parliamentary position?      Here's why :         The designation, Deputy Prime Minister, is strictly an honorary title conferred at the discretion of the Prime Minister on a member of the Cabinet. It has no standing in law, and does not carry any formal duties or tasks, though the Prime Minister may negotiate or assign specific tasks in conjunction with the title.        The title originates with Prime Minister Trudeau who first coined it when he designated the Hon. Allan J. MacEachen Deputy Prime Minister as well as Government House leader in an interview with the press subsequent to the nomination of his Cabinet, September 16th, 1977. Since then there has been only the Rt. Hon. Joe Clark who has never named a Deputy Prime Minister.  &nbsp;

      .   Hulsman’s “The Outsider” fails to let really let you in…..   As a Boston Red Sox Fan, I'm inclined to tell you:  My Boy Taleeb Is Wicked Awesome.  "The Outsider" has the story all wrong.  BC Business never ceases to amaze me.  Just when they get their hands on a great story idea, they take their foot out of their mouths, and step on it completely .  What’s left is the detritus of journalism gone wrong, a common occurrence when we overlook the truth, or at least the whole story.   Let me clear:  Kennedy NEVER had a chance.  Everyone who watched the Van-Centre Liberal Party nomination knew that.  It was Hedy versus the new kid on the block, Taleeb Noormohamed.  Noormohamed ran the real campaign – the “politics un-usual” campaign that will influence campaigns in BC to come, because it had a clear message, and an articulate messenger.  You think Lynne Kennedy took some scratches (“How dare you run against Hedy!!!”) ?  Taleeb took tons on the chin, but stayed true to his vision for the campaign, and restoring effective voice to the riding.    Politics unusual will be back, and so will Taleeb Noormohamed.  Mark July 8, 2004 on your calendar, I said it in here first, in Bennett’s Pen.  Taleeb Noormohamed for MP Van Centre in the next federal election.  If you’d like to learn more about the story in this months BC Business Magazine, got to this address:  http://www.bcbusinessmagazine.com/displayArticle.php?artId=351  Disclosure:  I was the Communications Director for the Taleeb Noormohamed Campaign in 2004.
