      With all the talk about mad cow disease these days, people have to take precautions.  Make sure to cook your meats really well.  But it turns out that meat isn't the only carrier.  A recent study has shown that 15% of all dairy products contain mad cow disease.  To make it easier to remember, the disease has now been classified into many parts.  They are now referred to as: Mad Milk disease, Mad Cheese disease, Mad yogurt disease, and Mad Ice Cream disease.    So make sure to boil your milk, cook your cheese, microwave your yogurt, and melt your ice cream.  We wouldn't want you to get sick.  Also, if you are a farmer, don't piss off your cows!!!

      Beware, it appears that when making the posters for Spider Man 2 that there was a typo.  In reality, the film is called Spidermon 2, and is the newest digimon movie.  Don't be fooled by the bad spelling (or possibly clever marketing) its not what it seems.  There is no Spider Man 2, its Spidermon vs Octupusmon, the digimon movie.  Well I haven't actually seen it but I heard it from a reliable source, I think.  It could have just been the water cooler making noises, but you can trust me, right?

      Ever wondered why dogs are known to run after the mailman?  Today, the all knowing Blog of the Gods will take you on an inside look at the truth behind mailman maulings.  Dogs are man's best friend, and its only natural that the dog is a secret spy trying to catch that wife doing the dirty with Mr the mailman.  Mailmen often are skinny and wear white uniforms which make them look to the dog like big bones with legs, and dogs love to chew on bones.  Most mailmen are relatively poor and probably don't always wash, and dogs have very sensitive smell.  How do you eliminate a foul odour, easy, you claw it to death!  Finally, mailmen are mostly social rejects, and the dog knows you don't like it when there's trash on your lawn.  So there you have it, the truth is that mailman maulings are just a way of catching your wife, having a snack, eliminating foul odours, or keeping garbadge of the lawn.

      With special help from Polie (http://polie.blogspot.com)  Sure sex is great... Or is it??? Anyhow little kids are having so much sex these days... But its with themselves!!!! As stated by the catholic church, masturbation (as they call the vile crime) is a sin! Don't sin children! Here's why!  -Kids these days have more and more glasses! IT DOES MAKE U BLIND!  -Masturbation is directly linked with Satan, that's why satanists do it while reading their bible (playboy)! Therefore people who flog it go directly to hell!  - Any object on your body that is so abused will clearly either bruise or even fall off! God wants you to have kids and you can't do that with no pecker!!!!  Don't be a panzy!!! Don't settle for the ripoff! When Digimon ripped off Pokemon did you buy digimon toys?? NO! So don't be conned into masturbating! Just go to the nearest strip club and show them the fake ID you bought last month when u wanted to get a playboy to perform vile deeds.

      You, this is god.  This is the first of many monthly newsletters, where I comment on stuff  Today's issue is Pokemon, possibly the stupidest things ever.  Who would want to play with some little thing that isn't even cute and pokes you?  I mean really, what's up with that!  There are so many of them nowadays, and the story is always the same.  I also think team rocket belong in a mental institution because they're so stupid.  If the people at Nintendo continue to make the games so badly I think I may smite the all!                                                                    -God

      Yes that's right, I believe that the future will be free of gun murders.  How? you may ask.  Well, its all thanks to the super soaker toy company.  The company's newest game is called soaker tag, and it will rid the world of gun murders.  The point of this game is to use your super soaker to wash away a patch located on the opponents arm.  I am convinced that eventually, everyone will get so used to shooting at people's arms that no one will have enough aim to shoot the head or heart.  So in the future we wont have to worry about getting shot and dying, we will just have really sore arms.
