      As you most likely know, Michael Moore posted the following letter:After the letter, you will find the response...PLEASE READ MR. TIMMINS RESPONSE. Bill Timmins President Aladdin Casino and Hotel Las Vegas, NV July 20, 2004 Dear Mr. Timmins: I understand from the news reports I've read that, after Linda Ronstadt, one of America's greatest singers, dedicated a song to me from your stage on Saturday night, you instructed your security guards to remove her from the Aladdin, which they did. What country do you live in? Last time I checked, Las Vegas is still in the United States. And in the United States, we have something called "The First Amendment." This constitutional right gives everyone here the right to say whatever they want to say. All Americans hold this right as sacred. Many of our young people put on a uniform and risk their lives to defend it. My film is all about asking the questions that should have been asked beforethose brave soldiers were sent into harms way. For you to throw Linda Ronstadt off the premises because she dared tosay a few words in support of me and my film, is simply stupid andUn-American. Frankly, I have never heard of such a thing happening. I read that you wouldn't even let her go back up to her room at your hotel! Are you crazy? For crying out loud, it was a song DEDICATION! To "Desperado!" Every American loves that song! Sure, some people didn't like the dedication, and that's their right. But neither they nor you have the right to remove her from yourbuilding when all she did was exercise her AMERICAN right to speak her mind. Of all the things that go on in Las Vegas, this is what creates theneed for serious action? What about the other half of the crowd at the Aladdin who, according to the Las Vegas Sun, cheered her when she made her remarks? Did > >you throw them out, too? I think you owe Ms. Ronstadt an apology. And I have an idea how you can make it up to her -- and to the millions of Americans you have offended. Invite her back and I'll join her in singing "America the Beautiful" on your stage. Then I will show "Fahrenheit 9/11" free of charge to all your guestsand anyone else in Las Vegas who wants to see it. Mr. Timmins, as the song "Desperado" says -- "Come to your senses!" How can you refuse this offer? I await your reply. Yours, Michael Moore Director, "Fahrenheit 9/11  Response In response to your letter dated July 20, 2004: You are correct that I had security remove Linda Ronstadt from Aladdin Casino and Hotel where the fun never ends and everybody wins. How very interesting to learn you are such a fan of Ms. Ronstadt. You questioned where I live and surprisingly knew Las Vegas is in the United States. You should visit it sometime. There are thousands of wonderful> 'All You Can Eat' buffets. There are also a lot of casinos who's owners don't F*** around. I am aware of the First Amendment and you have the right to talk about your hatred of America but once you are on my property and you are upsetting my guests, you will quickly learn about my rights. I can't remember if it was Jesus or George W. Bush that said, "Freedom is a two-way street." Ms. Ronstadt learned this long before I had her thrown out of my casino. You question my actions? If you come onto my property and upset my guests, you will receive the same, if not worse, treatment than Ms. Ronstadt received. I am sure your mere presence would upset my guests. You claim your film, "...is all about asking the questions that should have been asked before those brave soldiers were sent into harms way." I think your film does nothing but aid the enemy and hurt our troops. You have betrayed our troops, our leader and America. I have no respect for you or your vision of what America should be. I paid Ms. Ronstadt to entertain my guests, not divide them. The half that did not leave probably thought the verse you mentioned, "Why don't you come to your senses" was addressed to you. Maybe she should have dedicated her song, 'You're No Good' to you. I would have asked her back, had she done that. Regarding your request for me to apologize to her, have you and her on my stage singing anything about this Country and then playing your piece of S*** film is ludicrous! One of my workers is currently throwing away every complaint letter from brainless followers of you, claiming they will never visit my Casino. I could not be more pleased to know my casino and hotel will always be void of the kindmof people who support you. Meanwhile, my hotel has been quickly booked solid for the rest of the year with true Americans who love this Country and support our efforts overseas. They will see a framed copy of your letter and my response in the lobby to ensure they begin their experience with a laugh. Sincerely, Bill Timmins President Aladdin Casino and Hotel Las Vegas, NV  WHERE DOES MICHEAL MOORE GET OFF ABOUT TALKING ABOUT OUR RIGHTS THAT HE LOVES?????? I HAVEN"T HEARD MICHEAL MOORE SAY ONE POSITIVE THING ABOUT THIS NATION! I'VE RECIEVED NUMBEROUS EMAILS ABOUT MICHEAL MOORE AND HELL IT SOUNDS LIKE HE BACKS THE TERRORIST GROUPS! IN MY OPINION THAT FAT BASTARD SHOULD BE HANG FOR TREASON! MICHEAL MOORE YOU CAN ROT IN HELL!

      i've heard people say that the only reason Bush is in this war is to finish what his father started, which may be true, but if you think about it, that could be a good thing mailny because we're not attacking them to slaughter their people, we're trying to rebuild their nation and its not like the entire country is trying to kill all the americans, its a small group of terrorists. In the long run, most of the iraq people are happy we're there. Take Japan for example, we practically blew them out of the pacific ocean and then helped them rebuild and look at their country now its one of the healthiest, strongest, and wealthiest countries in the world, and they're now our ally. I don't know if you have been watching the Olympics or not, but the Iraqi soccer team is in the semi finals for the gold medal. This is the first time the soccer team has been back in the Olympics since 1988. Under Uday Hussein, the Iraqi athletes were tortured and severly beaten if they did not make it to the Olympics or if they did make it and not win 3 medals. Now the team runs around with smiles on their faces, representing their country, and giving their country something to be proud of, if not for the US this would not be possible, the Iraqi's would still be in Iraq under the ruling of Saddam Hussein, tortured because they didn't make the olympics. With the US soccer team out i am pulling for the Iraqi's to win gold.  this was a convo between my friend, celie wall from NC, and I and its so true!

      Whats your definition of "weapons of mass destruction?" Chemical weapons, nuclear weapons things like that right? Well how bout the people who have access to those weapons? lets use terrorist as an example. People are blaming the bush administration for "not finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq" Well if i had a gun in my room, and the police came to my house and said "we are going to search your house for weapons" would you just leave the gun in your dresser? or would you get rid of it??? i know what i would do, same situation in Iraq, we know that in the past saddam hussein had access to chemical weapons, and we did find evidence of them this past year. So we knew there was a threat. 2nd of all didn't we capture saddam hussein??? In my opinion there is a weapon of mass destruction right there. Do you not think that the world is a safer place now that hes gone?? The man who opened up chemical weapons on his own people isn't considered a weapon of mass destruction? Think about what'd he'd do to people who weren't his own!  BUSH 04!

      Whats the deal with everyone slamming prez. bush? I hear all these comments about how people are dying in Iraq, but its a war, it was a choice for those soldiers to go over and DEFEND our freedom they know the risks involved but they still have the guts, and understand the cause of why they are there. People sit here and critize what we are doing in Iraq, well to those people I say this, how would you like 2 live in a country where if you critizied the government, you were shot? You sit here and complain about what we're doing over there, but if we weren't defending our freedom, you wouldn't have that right! Another thing i've been hearing people complain about is the death toll of americans in Iraq, in the month of july there were 39 casualties in Iraq, well in Detroit, Michigan that same month there were 35 murders commited!!! Looks to me like we americans kill each other about the same amount as whats going on over there right now!
