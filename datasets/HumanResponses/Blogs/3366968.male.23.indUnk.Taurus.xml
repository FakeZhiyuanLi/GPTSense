      Waahoooo... my dear Cecil... i finally yield those word again... kerjaan gw d walhi kelar nih... ternyata rutinitas itu bsa ngebosenin banget.. walo padahal i really like the work description and work environment @ walhi. But how come when the job finally finish... kayaknya gw lega banget. Kaya semua beban d pundak gw lepas begitu aja. Lo tau ngga Cil pas pagi2 abis klar shift trakhir gw? gw muter2 jakarta pake motor sambil teriak2 kaya orang gila... gila Girl padahal jam 3-4an pagi tuh. Untung kaga ketangkep polisi dikirain orang mabok hihihiiiii....

      To my dear Cecil  Gw td jalan ke gramed with my faithfull black grasshopper :) Waktu abis bioskop di Jatinegara kebetulan macet tuh. Gila Cil, ada Ibu2 bawa anak bayi ngemis and duduk d trotoar padahal udah mao magrib. Wah jakarta emang gila... anak sgitu ngga berdayanya terpaksa harus ngisep polusi kendaraan termasuk motor gw yang akibatnya bisa nurunin tingkat kecerdasan tuh anak. Ngga adil banget girl... that baby suppose to have equal opportunity as same as we have to enjoy his life... begitu juga dengan ibu2 itu... ngga adil banget buat dia harus gemis2 d jalanan... and you know what is ironic? people surrounding me including my self couldn't do anything about it? some people may consider these as common thing... a part of cosmopolitan life they said... only she and her baby is the bad ones.... girl...i fell so helpes and mad also.... Jakartaa giiilllaaaaaaaa

      Got so fucked up and tired of living without someone special beside me. So hard to find "her" though realize that the world that i am living in is full of georgeous amazing creature. So starting from this very moment i'll create my special soul mate among terabyte of hypertext existance on the Net. This is the day where i give you life, so make this day is your birthday as well as my rebirth. I'll just call you Cecil and you will be the one where all my pain, misery, and maybe happines spilled and colided into one form wich shape my present to this world. You will be my best companion through this life and tell the world a story about small man who live in his own world without no one inside his private playground..... And now my dear cecil... we shall let the story begin...

      Dear Cecil How is life girl? wanna tell u something girl... what if...only what if i have an opportunity to spend a whole night with some girl that i really admire... most of guys may answer it with romantic dinner, hangout to some place... and i bet most of guys will answer it with romantic sex(whatever romantic thing) :) Well for me... if God give me an opportunity to be with some girl that i really like and spend the whole night with her... you know what i would do Cecil? nothing special maybe for most people... i just want to sit beside her bed watching her sleep... thats all..... just sit there watch her peacefull in her sleep...guarding her for the rest of the night... and i realize on that very moment i must be the luckiest man on earth and couldn't think a better moment beside that.... and the world would be a very beautiful place for me.... if only girl... if only..........

      Dear Cecil I guess i'm addict with phenylethylamine sensasion. The sensasion that coz by it its really beautiful and i can't describe by word.... unfortunately normally those chemical reaction usually known for people that in love with someone. And who i fall in love to? or i just a guy who easily fall in love? insane isn't it?

      Dear Cecil Hey...you know what she reply my sms. finally... well not really though. She said to me that she kinda busy right now and she also said that i'd better finish me thesis first.... then she would hear what i really want to say to her. This last thing make we wondering.... i think she afraid to say thing that would make me disappointed, i think that is the reason why she wan't me to finish my thesis first... what do you think dear? do my thought make any sense to you...coz that is the only reason that i can think of. If i'm right... well i'm totally screw..... if she doesn't have those feeling the same as i do, i think i will lose my faith on luv. I don't think i would be ever luv anyone so much just like the way i luv her now. Because i'm so tired for my quest and i think this is the last time i ever been in luv. Maybe in the future (if turn out she doesn't feel the way i feel bout her) i'll find another girl... we shall meet, then we shall marry, then we shall have a children together, then we shall spend our time together... but one thing for sure i wouldn't luv that woman as much as i luv her now. It would be just become another rutine thing to do without any deeply meaning that i would spend my future with another woman beside her. It would just make me totally numb.... heehh...my live just full of those drama irony kinda thing. There are many girls out there that would dream if only they could be in her position right now and feel very envy with her if they found out how deep my feeling with her. Oh dear Cecil... . she such a sweet thing don't you think dear.... i really hope that she would have the same feeling like i felt bout her so i still can belive with a word called luv... its all in her hand now... wether she would make me the happiest man on the planet that ever exist... or just make me loose fate on luv forever...

      Dear Cecil  I'll always feel so social misfit. The world just way to complicated for me. Especially those buzzing word called luv. Hey...you know what... just send her sms and telling her got some confesion to make regarding what i felt bout her. Hahh though she hasn't reply me yet. Guess i scare the hell of her with those sms. Well at least i got my 1/4 brain capacity back coz not have to worry again wether she know what i felt bout her recently. About the rest of these matter... i'll just worried these later... got so much to do dear in such short time. If i could just live inside the world that i created my own and forever be child. Being adult suck... trust me on these dear....

      My dearest Cecil How is the web lately, is there still any amazing stuff going lately.... maybe new hole on some lame OS found? if only you could tell whats going on there Cecil. Like usual dear, gue lagi suntuk berat....hemmm thats why i created you for anyway didn't i.... Hari ini dan beberapa hari lalu merupakan point terendah dalam hidup gue selama 23 tahun belakangan ini, semua hal di masa lalu yang gue rintis dan lakuin terakumulasi dan menjadi hal yang bener-bener bikin pusing kepala gue......feel wanna running away from life a bit and enjoy some peacefull mind...if only i could....all this thing that i've done in past become....well f*cked up.... warnet gue macet, deal sama PT temen gue ngga kelar-kelar sampe sekarang, server di kantor rada bermasalah, skripsi ngga klar-klar, dan hal-hal lain yang masih banyak di otak gue..... and other thing that really make me make really mad to myself is i still haven't find a way to tell her about my feeling that i've been telling to you past few weeks. Tapi untung tadi kita sempet ngobrol Cil... yup... i call her on the phone and we kinda chat a bit... felt great though only temporary until she hang up on me.... well she told me that she gonna leave this bloody country about late Jully or August or so....aaarrrgggghhhhhh....f*ckin hate it girl... All of this thing just become an obstacle for me to move on to my other point of life... but what can i do.... my brain just don't have the capacity to swallow all this matters at once. Life just being a bitchy hell for a guy like me isn't it dear...

Tapi smakin lama gw ngabisin waktu sama dia gw jd fell something different nih. Dari dulu gw maen k tempat dia biasa aja padahal. Shit what the hack happen Girl? smakin gw ngobrol and spend the time @ her house's smakin itu pula gw makin sadar bahwa smua yang gw cari dari seorang cewe mostly in her....aduh... kok jadi gini nih.... how come in all these year all the quality that i search from a girl suddenly i just see them inside her.... slama ini yang gw cari2 ngga taunya ada di depan mata kepala gw sendiri... tp dia best friend gw lg... iye klo dia ngerasa sama apa yg gw rasain k dia... klo ngga....i really couldn't afford to lose her as my best friend if i tell her about what i fell bout her... karena biasanya pasti bakalan jadi aneh dah(karna gw yg udah2 gitu)...and its not gonna be the same again....forever...tp disisi lain, gw pengen ngungkapin ini smua ke dia... she really make my phenylethylamine high.... i really miss her with every nerve cells inside me... i really miss her with every second that i have... i really addict being with her.... cuman dia Cil yang bisa bikin gw nyaman sama diri gw walopun qt suka cela2an. Gw akuin klo gw itu introvert abis dan cuman dia gw bsa crita smua hal yg ngga pernah gw share k orang lain even with my brother and sister even my folks. Gmn nih Cil...untuk kesekian klinya gw harus ada perasaan k orang yg untuk skrang bagi gw ngga mungkin... love definetly my curse girl.... God you really not fair this time!!! i really miss her badly... banget Cil sampai2 gw pengen slam my head to a wall and punch my hand to some heavy stuff coz this feeling that i can't share with her.... annnjjjrrriiittttt Ung knapa lo jd kaya gini nyet... dasar cupid banggsaaatttt....Cil klo elo nemu mahluk bersayap bawa panah dan namanya cupid tell him that "u should take your arrow and shuffle at your fuc**n ass" yah Cil!!!

      Dear Cecil  Sorry it took me a while since my last blog. Got so busy with those undergraduate thesis and those job at the office. Anyway, i'm still waiting for her to hear my confesion. The wait period is really hell dear... turn my live into completly misery coz i just can't keep this huge feeling to her by my self. But i just can't force her to hear all this coz i affraid it just scare her and at the end she just leave me for good. Sometime i cry when i really... really wanted being with her and miss her really... i just weak man dear.... and can't help deeply falling luv with this girl. I just wish she could... u know.. if she could just hear what is really inside my head... thats all.... i know is not my place now to ask her fo being my lover... though u know how much i want her so bad. Don't know wether i can't bear with this whole situation. I'm really tired dear... i really am....
