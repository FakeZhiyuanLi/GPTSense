      I must admit, I felt better today than I did yesterday. I think it was the combination of the gorgeous weather (even though it is winter), the late start to the day (going to school later than usual), and the fact that I  surprisingly  got a butt load of work done last night. Plus, American Idol has started here,  finally , LoL. I love watching the shows at the beginning of a series: all the bad, the worse, and the horrible.   They're playing season 3 episodes every night here, to try to catch up to the US so that the final show can play live. I hope it's gonna be as good as last season.    Now that I have accepted the fact that I am indeed... stressed, I can tell myself to slow down before I get all caught up in crap. Overthinking, overanalyzing, over-worrying, over everything. I think I'll just get to bed early tonight. Pretty pooped out.

      Maybe it's just the fact that it's almost midnight, and I've actually managed to stay up this late (it's late for me) doing school crap. Maybe it's just the fact that I'm pretty sure there's something going on with me right now, something I can't pinpoint... or maybe it's just the fact that Kirsty told me I had what she had long time ago - adjustment disorder (well, she had ad: depression, whereas, apparently, according to the website she found, I have ad: anxiety) that I feel compelled to start one of these things once again.   But in the end, I guess I prefer - hold it. I am not going to analyze. I am NOT gonna try to psychoanalyze myself like I always do. I'm sick of my narcissistic tendancies... That's the problem right here... okay, I just did it again.   Screw it. I'm gonna do more homework in hopes of distracting myself from all this damn... whatever it is.

      Countdown to Boston: 13 days  Guess what I did this morning??!!?? I bought a ticket for an awesome seat at the... JOHN MAYER CONCERT in two months!!!! I found out a while ago that on my last night in Boston, before I fly back to New Zealand, John Mayer will be performing at the Tweeter Center for Performing Arts in Mansfield, MA on August 22nd!!!! It's truly meant to be - it's PERFECT!   So I've bought the ticket online and the seat is so awesome. Not right up front, but pretty damn close! It's gonna be AMAZING. *sigh*   How hot is John Mayer?   Pretty damn hot, not to mention such an awesome performer/songwriter/singer/guitarist... just everything really.   Can't wait!!!

      Have you ever felt like you wanted to move on, but you couldn't because of obligation? Like you're so incredibly sick of something/someone yet no matter how much you just want to cut all connection to this aforementioned thing/person, you couldn't because... well, because you just couldn't?   It's been two years since I moved, and amazingly enough, some people have kept in touch up until even now. It takes so much work - long distance relationships, whether just friends or something more. And sometimes it feels like the effort isn't worth the payoff (or lack thereof). When did those friends of mine become a burden rather than a relationship  worth  the extra work? When did I start feeling like  I WANT them to stop writing  because I'm not the kind of person who can stop corresponding first.   When did I get sick and tired of people I don't even see?   It's amazing how much drama goes on in junior year of high school at an all-American, 100% typical town of the USA. Compared to my life in a tiny, conservative town at a small all-girls school, their lives seem like one big teenage soap-opera. And I get tired of just hearing about it. Who's pissed at who; who's a bitch and who's not; who are 'real friends' and who are fake... I mean honestly, bottom line is, who really gives a shit? You're all gonna lose contact in a year when you all leave for college, so who really cares?   I still remember some of the 'drama' from when I was living there... I guess the older you get, the worse it becomes.   I am so thankful I'm not a part of all that... I'm so glad that kind of crap isn't a factor in my life. I think of all the stress and worries I have, just school-work wise, and to have all that other unnecessary crap on top of everything else... I wouldn't survive!   I think I'm gonna avoid going online now. Today, one of those 'long-distance' friends I was mentioned talked AT me for about forty-five minutes. Conversation? No. She literally talked at me the entire time... was I listening? Trying to... easy to get distracted when all she's doing is complaining and bitching, which is fine and dandy... but not for forty-five minutes straight! So now, here I am, bitching about her bitching. What a vicious circle. I'm half way across the world and I'm getting sucked into all that dramatic negativity already!   No more.   No more.

      Queens Birthday so no school - yay! Except since I had such an awesome, kick-ass relaxing weekend so far, today is 'work-my-ass-off-and-do-all-the-damn-school-work-I-pushed-aside' day. Ugh. Oh well, no regrets.   Friday I skipped school to get my hair straightened - I LOVE getting my hair washed by someone else, hehehe... it's soooo relaxing. That night my friends came over for a Mid-Winter Christmas Party. It was fantastic. Didn't get any sleep at all! And then the rest of the day I zombied around, tried to sleep, went to tutor in the late afternoon (don't remember what I did!), then babysat until like 11:30pm. At least I made some money, even though I was soooo tired.   Yesterday, went to church, came back and Kirsty and I watched TV/videos for EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS!!! Hahahaha!!! We haven't done something like that in sooooooooooooo long. But with her studying for exams for uni, me busy with all this extra school work, we haven't really had any good, quality TV watching in a while. Oh man, Alias was soooo awesome! I had been missing some episodes lately becuase I've been so busy with school, but I taped it last week and I'm glad I did because it was the SEASON 2 FINALE! (NZ's a season behind) It was... unbelieveable! Michael Vartan is hot beyond description!  I'm getting incredibly excited now... two more weekends until I leave for Boston, and two months of Harvard!!! AHHHHHH!!! A part of me wants to leave right now, wishing the two and a half weeks were just over!!! But another part of me knows this anticipation, this waiting, this dreaming about the trip is just as fun as actually going on the trip where i'll be pissing my pants, scared shitless! LoL.
