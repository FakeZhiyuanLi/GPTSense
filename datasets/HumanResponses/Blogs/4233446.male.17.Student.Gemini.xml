      Ok, so it wasnt really a road trip but I couldnt come up with a better title.  So sue me.  Andrew, Derek, Dawn, Andrew's cousin, and I went to the mall yesterday.  Twas fun.  Bought a couple of cd's and never bought the keychain that I was going to buy.  *shrug*  Yeah, so that was my day yesterday.  The only thing that sucked is that I didn't get to roleplay at all yesterday like I said I was going to.  Forgive me, Meredith?

      Ohhhhh myyyy gooooddddd....I am sooooo tired right now. Even after having five energy drinks earlier I'm still feeling like I could collapse. School + physical labor for another 5 hours = mucho tiredness. *yawn* All but three of my classes this year are pointless and boring, those three classes being Pre-Calculus, Economics, and AP English. Everything else is...bleh. Yes..bleh. Ok so I can't think of anything else to put on here so that's it for today. Peace. \m/(--)\m/

      Omg today sucked so much ass. Well first off...for some reason I got really really depressed really fast last night. The fact that my parents were making me feel like shit didnt help much either. So that sent me into a downward spiral that lasted all last night and today. I ended up cutting myself again, something I abhor myself for doing cause it never helps, only causes me more pain that I already have. I can hardly even keep a fuckin coherent train of thought right now. I've lost one good friend and I feel that I'm pushing the others away cause I'm so depressed. I can't see any light in my life anymore. The darkness of emotion and life has stolen over me and pulled me down into its depths. I can't even be around hardly anyone anymore without feeling like I'm going to burst into tears cause of the lonliness I feel. Right now there's one person that could probably make me feel a little better, or just take my mind off of the pain, but she's not on and she has her own shit to deal with. Neither Andrew nor Allyse are on right now. Though I think I may have fucked up with Allyse. Big fuckin surprise there. I always fuck up, always. I can't think straight right now I'm so depressed and tired. Yeah work sucked too, but that's a given. *sigh* Oh well. Life fuckin sucks. Thats a fact. I'm alone and always will be. Another fact.   Right now...I really feel like I could take my life.

      As the title says...this section is a testament to the stupidity of the Plainfield High School senior class of 2005. I was in a bad mood yesterday and didnt post this. Anyway....two girls in my study hall got caught yesterday snorting coke...10 FUCKING FEET AWAY FROM THE TEACHER! Come on...how FUCKING STUPID do you have to be to do that. Jesus fucking Christ...grow some fuckin brains. And the kicker...one of them only got a one day suspension. Ummm...anyone else see the idiocy in that? Doing drugs...in school...suspended one day. WTF?!? The other's in jail...but she had 6 or 7 grams of coke and 3 grams of weed. Fuckin idiots.  And on to other things....  Someone who I've become really close to is having a really difficult time right now and there's not a fuckin thing I can do about it.  Meredith if you read this know that if I could take your pain away, I would do so in a heartbeat.  I wish so bad that I could be there for you.  But, seeing as how I'm not, I'll do my best to try and comfort you whenever you're in need of it.  I'll always be there for ya.  Well...there's some more stuff on my mind...but I don't really feel like posting any of it on here.  So, that concludes today's entry.  Peace

      Ok so last night, a couple friends and I went out to see AvP.  That really helped to allieviate some of the pain I was feeling yesterday.  Three of us are all really feeling the same thing so it kind of helped for us to be around each other and just chill for a few hours.  At least it helped me.  I'm still really depressed, but not quite as lonely.  I know there's people that care about me but I just feel that there's no one there.  The one person that could probably make me feel better right now isn't on and oh how I wish she was.  *sigh* Oh well.  I'm just gonna leave it at that for the day.

      Dont you just love it when you feel that no one will ever hug you again?  When you feel like no one will ever care again?  That's the way I've felt for the past couple days.  I watch people with their friends and their lovers and I know that I will never share that feeling with anyone.  Sure I have people that I call my friends.  But I feel like I'm losing them.  Like they dont even care if I live or die any more.  I have to watch someone I love feel the effects of depression, I have to watch her hate herself.  I have no one to go to, no one in my life any more.  Everything I thought I had accomplished has been burned and I'm left with a never ending grey as the color that dominates my life.  Nothing but pain and lonliness live in me.  I honsetly want to die right now.  I just want to dig away at my body till I've drained all my blood.  Cutting doesn't make me feel any better, it just takes my mind off of the depression for awhile.  Cutting is what I've been doing most of today, just digging away at my wrist with a sharpened pencil.  There's nothing left for me.  I hate this life and I hate who I am.

      Well today has been just fuckin PEACHY so far.  First, my alarm clock doesnt go off.  Thank whatever higher power there is that I was sleeping lightly last night and happened to wake up at 5:40.  So, I was only ten minutes late to work, but of course I still got bitched at for twenty minutes by my manager.  Four hours later, I pull my shoulder out of place for the umpteenth time since I started working there and had to yank that back into place and continue working.  Yeah, fun.  About half an hour later I pull a muscle in my leg.  So now my shoulder is killing me and my leg hurts like hell.  To top it all off, about twenty minutes after pulling a muscle, I twist my ankle and drop a table on my foot in the process.  So I'm in a fair amount of pain right now.  That's just what's physically wrong.  I woke up this morning and was hit with an overwhelming sense of lonliness, like there's no one in my life anymore.  I feel like I'm gonna be trapped in this place forever and never see anyone that I care about again.  It seems like everything's grey again, like I'll never know love or any good feeling.  I thought I was over this shit.  It's been a good four months since the last time I felt this way, since I felt depressed and lost.  But here I am again, here I am and this time there's really no one who cares anymore.  I feel like there's nothing left for me.  Right now, I just want to die.

      So yeah, work was a bitch last night. Aflac and an AA group in the hotel at the same time = me working my ass off. I set up banquet halls for those of you reading this that don't know what I do for a living. Anway, Aflac had 400 or so people in their group, all drunk as hell of course, and the AA group had nigh on 1000 people. Now, at 5:00 p.m. the Aflac group left the room so we could clean off all of the tables, about 40 or so, and reset them for dinner. While this may seem easy, trust me, it wasn't. There were beer bottles, bottles of water, food wrappers, various pieces of paper, and other random crap all over every single table. So we went around pulling that crap off the tables while the banquet servers set plates etc. down behind us. The group was supposed to be back in in 45 min. Needless to say they had to wait a bit longer, the sloppy bastards. Then, as we're putting ice and water into glasses, we run out of ice in all three of the ice bins. ALL of them. So, one of us had to gather money and go to speedway to raid the place of their ice supply and then, with my help and the help of two other guys get it offloaded from the bed of the truck onto a flatbed and then unloaded into the ice bins. All eighty bags of it. Once that was done we had to rapidly fill another 300 glasses of water and get those to the servers, *cough* fuckin pussies *cough*, to put on the tables along with the dinners. Once that was done we had to go into the room that the AA group was in and straighten all 1000 chairs in 30 min and replace the water jugs with new ones. Now, through all of this we had the client services people, the ones who work with the clients on getting everything right for the meetings, breathing down our necks about piddly shit that they could do themselves, except for the fact that their too concerned about breaking a nail or breaking a little sweat. Now, this is what really pisses me off about last night. My scheduled shift was 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Well, the Aflac group didnt break til 2 FREAKIN A.M. So I, along with the rest of the set up crew, had to stay there till 3 a.m. to get everything cleaned off. The one funny thing about last night is watching all the people in the AA group have to pass by seven bars fully stocked with alcohol. Yes I know its not right or funny to laugh at that but I'm sorry, it was funny. *sigh* I'm done rambling and ranting now. Peace.
