      #10. Blatently ignore, "Hi, how are you?"     A. Or respond with, "Just looking!" I didn't ask you what you were here for, I asked how you are.     B. Talk on your cell phone so that I can't make myself available to you until you decide, NOW you need me, then act as if you've been asking for my help for the last 30 minutes.  #9. Look directly at a price tag and say, "How much is this?"     A. Look directly at the price and ask, "Is this on sale?"     B. Insist that your regularly priced item be given to you for the sale price because you or someone before you put it back in the wrong place.  #8. Throw your payment at me. Credit cards in particular catch great air.  #7. Press your face on the glass to look inside for 5 minutes, without using the extra energy to open the door and come in.  #6. Talk to me through the glass trying to pursuade me to open early or stay late, FOR YOU!      A. Ask me to stay late because, "Don't worry, I just want to look at something?" Wow, since you won't be spending any money, let me unlock that door.  #5. Swear at and threaten the staff. Is this sales person REALLY ruining your life so much you want a mug shot taken?  #4. Get blisters from new shoes and try to return them. ALL NEW SHOES CAUSE BLISTERS! It's called breaking them in, don't be ghetto.  #3. Come in with an attitude anticipating a hassle over a return and throw the merchandise at me, while you treat me as if I, personally, made the item defective. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ME SYMPATHETIC TO YOU!    A. Make up a story about what happened. I smell your lie when you walk in and it only makes my ass harder.  #2. Don't like my answer and ask to speak to the manager. I AM THE MANAGER BITCH!  And the number one MOST obnoxious thing a customer can do;  #1 When asked, "Did anyone help you out today?" Look at your friend/spouse/sugardaddy and say, "He/She did. Do we get a discount?" Followed by lively laughter or a wicked snarl. Do you really think you are the first person to say this to me today? YOU ARE NOT FUNNY!

      So after the tears have been shed, champange sipped and hugs received, what's left of this in between phase called "engagement"? What are we engaged in, exactly?   I myself am engaged in war. Typically, these pre-nuptual battles happen with the future Mr. and Mrs. against their parents. Not in this case, unfortunately. While my fiance and I, (or as he affectionately refers to me, his finance), should be on the same blissful cloud we sailed on the weekend he proposed, we seem to have fallen through to the rocky sands of reality. Reality asking, how many parents of our generation set aside a substantial amount of money for their little girl's wedding? Hell, I would take a couple grand at this point.   Being the modern, non-traditional, we-lived-in-sin-before-we-got-married couple, I assumed it would be reasonable to suggest our footing the bill for the spring affair. With eyes glazed over, staring at the Mets lose another one, my fiance nodded in agreement. I scampered off happily, knowing that we had just saved my parents from financial ruin, and made the call to my mother. I told her, naively, that I didn't want our wedding to be a stress, but a joyous occaision, so my beloved and I would ensure that bills would be paid from our,(his), accounts. My mother was so touched, she cried. I felt mountains of stress lift from her shoulders as I went before my love with the great news of her happiness. Within seconds, I felt her mountains crush me through the floor. "I"M NOT PAYING FOR THIS WEDDING!" My groom was confused and angry. Apparently I mistook his not disagreeing with my suggestion, as aggreement. So what do I do now? I can't go back to my financially modest parents and say, "Just kidding, your son-in-law actually wants to talk dowry." I am left to try and reason with the cranky prince and ask for his understanding.   It's been three weeks and I am considering elopement.

      I just have to say to all of you that married during the 2003-2004 season, thanks a lot! Trying to plan this wedding on a budget after attending the other 8 extravaganzas is a real pain in the ass.   First offenders-- the Rodiers, with their Hamptons weekend. The height of elegance and good times, they had a genius band cap off the night with "Lose Yourself".  Then we had Steinberg's Reception-of-Gluttony with the most amazing array of food, I will ever see, plus a CIGAR ROLLER!   The Jaffe's made us stay in the boonies, but rewarded us with an incredible amount of alcohol, leading up to Mr. Hirsch's fine rendition of "When Doves Cry" followed by the now famous, Pilsbury Dough Boy incident.  Most recently, the Wong's had us escape to the Virgin Islands. The wedding was on a clifftop surrounded by the ocean. Need I say more?  And although I will defend California to Jay at every opportunity, the reality is, there's a lot more Valley than there is paradise. I have my work cut out for me.

      Heather and I met on the internet.   I feel it's somewhat apropos that our engagement is chronicled herein.  Hopefully Heather will have something to say here as well.  Likely, she'll have more to say than me.  Maybe it will be theaputic to vent here rather than in each other's face.  Maybe not.   As of today, August 19th, 2004 this is where we stand:  1.  We have no wedding date, although May 30th, 2005 has been discussed. 2.  We have no wedding location, although some place in the Santa Monica mountains has been discussed. 3.  We have no budget although 20K seems reasonable to Jay.   On to the high and the lows....
