      taban: i tried one day to explain this word to bird.  (note: never try to explain a dawn concept to a krossik!)  but this is the best english translation i can come up with: to do something only for the pure pleasure of doing it. but it is more, lots of undermeanings and such. one day i'll know english better and may be able to explain it.

      krossiks: people with little and/or narrow minds; or christain/catholic people, usually not an insult when refering to them as a person.  (example, when i say bird is a krossik, or when kriket is a krossik, or the pope is a krossik. it is only an insult if you say that krossik, that damn krossik, ect.) *****

      so, the memorial weekend:
i went up to the cabin we have on lake chelan, awesome place, but i was with my parents the whole entire time and it was boring if relaxing. i dunno how i'm gonna survive the summer. no contact with the outside is bother, just when the only contact is my parental unit it drives me CRAZY. not like i have far left to go but still, it isn't healthy.
and now i am gonna go hang with adri and porkypine before practice starts, its the first day in the outdoor pool and it is going to be freaky deeky shiver me ass off cold. it always is for the first week or month or so in the outdoor pool. and apple capital is this weekend too, a fun meet, not really serious just to see how you stand at the beginning but still friking FREEZING.

      let the smoke begin rolling, the weed start burning, its memorial weekend again. stoners shout and get their anger out, cocaine dreams and all the shit. white line thru the highway of life, its not stardust fool its just the straight and narrow. twisted beliefs all they see is what they believe. and how does that mind so grand comprehend the low-life, the midnight struggles and strife? it can't of course. the high and mighty do not know the ways and thoughts of us, the children, the forgotten ones. all they care for is perfection of the masses. a single unit. no individuality, no thoughts.  riki says, just sit back and enjoy life. you can't change anything so you might as well just be hapi. no way. not for me. BECAUSE I HATE THIS. this "life". bah. it is sickening, the destruction and waste just for one generation. they are willing to destroy all that is beautiful so they can have something cheap and easy. like a   fucking whore  . thats all they see the world as.

      to day in english i did one of those writing things where you just pour out whatever is in your head until you fill up a piece of paper. just random words, phrases, anything. and once you have put them all on a piece of paper you go back through and read it, and it is scary because while you are writing it your brain is kinda tuned out. you just keep the pencil moving. but as i looked back through it, i realized something. i really don't want to be here. big surprise.

all i wanted in life was to be accepted. all i wanted was to be recongized as something real. not just a prop in your made up play. that is what we all want. i think i've learned what i needed to learn. there is no hope in loniliness. there is no pride in vanity. there is nothing in everything and paradox is the rule of the world. falco when you read this, i want you to know that nothing is an impossible concept. but there is nothing. it is not the abyss, or chaos, or anything else. it is a state of spirit. the final passage from hate to love. the numbness you feel when a loved one is gone. that is your impossible possiblity. skie, i've got something for you too. you can't die of a broken heart. it is just the deciding factor. and no matter how cruel it sounds, you can not kill yourself, or die in anyway, with out hurting a whole lot of other people. there are too many close to you, too many who are somehow depending on you. when that day has come you will remember this and you will hate me forever. do you remember the mountain? because it is always there, on your back. death is only the door to another one.

         We've also seen images of a young American facing decapitation. This vile display shows a contempt for all the rules of warfare and all the bounds of civilized behavior. It reveals a fanaticism that was not caused by any action of ours and would not be appeased by any concession.   
may i just say one thing, mr. bush?  you lie 
1)i have never seen the tape. they're all edited. in fact, i'm not really sure that it isn't all just good acting. 2)There are no rules for warfare. civilized means killing. stop being so paradoxical, if you know the meaning of the word. 3)oy, where yah been? din't ya know american (yes you are the american president) soldiers are the ones who have been torturing prisoners?  TORTURING.  there is no excuse. I pledge no allegiance to the flag of america, land of the cowards and home of the stupid.

      some day i'm gonna down load hello-photo onto this comp, but with only ten days left of school i dunno if it is worth it. but it seems i only blog here, where every one is off in their own little flash-fireworks-dreamweaver and various bad music worlds. so i can rant and rave in peace and i even look like i am doing some thing. i sould try to post a flashmovie here, but i dunno how i would do it from my own personal files to this. probably impossible. found a cheat, well two really but they do the same thing, one for pix and one for text: if you get into one of those "sorry no right clicks" zones, simply left click and hold down then right click to get pix; hight light desired text and press ctrl-c to copy and ctrl-v to paste. fun and shyte. 
but since most of my pix would come from  urlLink elf wood   you might as well just go there then wait on something that'll most likely not happen. i love writing to invisible friends.


alright new update. can't download hello so no new pix from me

         My life is rated NC-17.  What is your life rated?  
i just took the test thing again, and now my life is rated "none under seventeen". but i'm just 15, so ????? this is, as usual, a screwed over world. and it is first period again. gods i hate this place. wish i could just say adi aiya to the world. (that means goodbye forever, more or less) but yeah read below. can't leave without causing pain. like falco said. sometimes that boyo scares me, he  thinks!  sometimes. very very weird.  i'm not crazy i'm the one who's sane its the rest of you bastards who are crazy. if i think i float off the floor, and you think you saw me float off the floor, then who's to say i didn't?  i've been reading 1984. good and twisted, doublethink and ownlife. don't i wish, nah not really. there never was hope, but you still believed, you poor crossik. 

 I wished once upon a star
wished i didn't have this scar
your love was pain and slow to kill
my heart was torn and blood did spill
agony, i'm passed out on the floor
agony, because i'll never know more 
this life is dedicated to the memory of truth, honor and value. may they never be forgotten.

      forced out of my shelter of insanity, there never was hope. lost my way to secluded peace, found myself here instead. i'm not alone, never alone, connected to all things, but this scar-marked body is battered and beautiful, so sick and tearful, you'd think there was an angel living here. alone in my own world, sheltered in the palm of the devil, you look at me with eyes covered in pity, because those grey tints in your colour are killing you, drinking the hate and love, leaving you hollow and blind. so i sing my song at this corner in life, waiting for some one to come and throw me a crown, dancing to the drums of hidden battles, the ones that are real, the ones in your head, because isn't it all a dream? when you're sleeping here, in what place do you wake, and when you are sleeping there, are you living here? how can there be nothing, darling, when i am living and breathing? how can you be sad, how can you love, when all the world's a dream and the life you live is but that of a play soldier in the sand-box wars of the gods? some day i'll show you the light, and we'll dance away to my world of bleeding skies, a place of solitude and sparkling waters. meantime, i'll keep my secrets and you'll keep yours, we'll pass in the street and never know, the real worth of a word, a smile, a murdering rage, because between us is the unreality of the mundane, the past of hate and horror, so pitiful the lost words that were never spoken, and so pray for your miserable soul, pray to the gods that are and never were, pray that you may leave and cause no pain, that hate wins and love is forsaken so you can be free. i'll forgive you, in my own way of revenge, once i've made you bleed and scream, so you can see what you could have caused. some day i'll remember you and you'll remember me, far ahead and to the rear, army's coming time to fear...

       urlLink    i drew this and then freaked it out in photoshop. yeah the blue chick is a crazy elf, the dude is just a dude.
why? it is not my fault. i have no controll over my life. ::glares but not at moe::  i swear it is all do this do that be this don't be that. and then all the little hidden things. blah. no controll. just follow the rules and be stupid sheep like every one else. baa-baa. ::dances:: and then every one is all oh the pity party boo-frickety-hoo. why can't they see all we want to is be able to find ourselves and then be ourselves? why is there is huge ass fear of sticking out? if we were all diferent, sameness would be the thing that is screwed over. my mom was watching and reading this entire thing. that makes me mad. i am never alone. i think i'm gonna be sick and tearful...

      i just noticed something: AMERICANS ARE STUPID! i've thought it for a long time. i just never saw concrete proof of it. until i talked to this girlio from japan, Ia. (i don't know if that is how it is spelled, sorry) well lets just say that normal ninth grade level is about fifth grade. ::feels incredible stupid:: i though i was smart... well maybe for an american i am... again, i really don't like AMERICANS. before every one starts sharpening their knives, let me say this: of all the people living in america, about 15% of them are AMERICANS. the whole baseball and apple pie crap. i live in america, i was born in seattle (heroine capital of the world!), but i am not AMERICAN. i just occupy space & time here. Hola ami! 
sachez que  je  ne le parler  franÃ§ais. i don't know if the grammar is right, but that's ok. i can't talk english very well unless i am thinking about speaking. which i never do. i dunno what's happening out there, real world, but this is the report from lostgirl, so called b/c of her inablity to read people. maps are easy. humans are impossible. i've got to finish my science report (gahck) so adi...

      i really hate school. classes: first, multimedia. i made the girls and boys swimming page for school, the girls is better than the boys because i was on the team. now that is done all i do is nothing. not to bad. second, algebra. evil. very very very evil. i don't get math very well beyond the basics. it is supposed to be logical, right? yaeh-hun sure, i've met more logical stoned stoners. third, english. first half of the year i was with a truly despicable teacher, mrs. johnson. she had been a kindergarten teacher for seven years before a jump to ninth. it was like reliving all the worst days of first grade all over again. right now i am listening to all the stupid bitches in multimedia and they are saying they are going to run away to FLORIDA to meet SURFERBOYS. now is the screwed over to anyone but me? everyone knows the sufer boys are in CALIFORNIA. d'uow. then i have lunch. a whole half hour. yay. fourth, p.e. we're doing bowling now, so we go down to eastmont lanes for 45 mins. not to bad. we can buy food there. fifth, science. scott the hott goth is in that class. yum. sixth, geography/history. mr. hoffner is pretty cool for an ancient guy, and amanda is in that class. so it can be pretty awesome.

      whoa i am school... din't know the blockade would let you blog from here. this school has serious issues about internet use, i got yelled at for going to dd&d (drink deeply and dream, vampyre site). so hi! world, from the bowels of hell-o mister princible man. but now i have something new to do in first period. yay-ers. anything happen? nope. why am i doing this? because i can. whats the point then? there never was a point, idiot. i suppose i'm right. [[skitso skitso skitso...]] not really. just fun. i'm easily amused. ::plays with string:: hmm... i really have nothing to say. i got called a chick adeee by the dragon-boyo... that was strange. in swimming we did only about three thousand yards... which is about 60 laps; not much really when you compare it to the 100 100s (400 laps)and it was all easy sets, no  mile I.M.s or four hundred butterflys... i'm reading the book 1984 for hon-eng (honors english) and its not as bad as i thought it would be. but no dragons or wizards. just evil nazi and little kids. i hate little kids; they are stupid and naive and blind. i think they call it innocence. it is supposed to be sweet or something. i call it psyco-maniac-ness. not the cool axe-murderer kind, but the wicked evil chinese water torure kind. i love the way i write about how i have nothing worth writing about, it is kinda like say a speech the says the same thing again again and every body knows it all ready, but they listen anyways. mindless munching machines!!!!! ::runs and hides:: the enter key doesn't work on this thingy... not on the actual post i mean. does any one know where raed is? all of sudden everyone in iraq/middle-eastrenness just stopped blogging... like a bomb went off and all the bloggers turned into bloody bits... i've got a morbid imagination, did you know that? well now all the off the class is leaving to go ice-skating but i forgot the permission slip so i am stuck here... ::over-joyed:: i don't really like ice skating but i could have missed out on three class. and i know half the poeple who work at the rink, so i could have hanged out with them... oh well, such is life, yada yada yada.  now it is creep-idy quiet and there are only two other kids in here (not counting the little voices)and the teacher. i think a bomb is going to explode or something. just BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and a huge shock-wave and everything goes bye-bye. what would it feel like, to be right in the middle of it? to be a suicide bomber? to die being blown to thousands of bits. i read somewhere that the cause of every single human death can be traced back to one thing: lack of oxygen to the brain. twisted good fun. there is a difference between brain-dead and body-dead, you see: brain-dead means you are just some much meat, body-dead means you are dead-dead or soon to be. the bell just rang,  gotta go...

      i'm stuck in here doing algrebra all weekend... it sucks big. what is the point of learning something we shall never use in the real world? they should be teaching us how to get away from rapist and how to deal with crazy presidents. stuff like that. life is boring because we are too afraid to step outside the comfort zone and EXPLORE! there is fun that does not have to do with sex and drugs and money. (no really there is) like climbing a mountain at midnight just to watch the sunrise from top. swimming a mile I.M. just to prove to yourself you can do it. being with friends and watching a really stupid scary movie. trick-or-treating on july 4. joining an iraqi militant group. running for president of the us of asshole. :D funi crap. i wrote something that is stupid and not very good but i am going to post it anyways.
**** telemon was strong and sleek, never was there a man to call him weak, telemon was a cliff diver, from high peaks he'd jump, and dive, and glide like a swan, to the ocean deep. on day telemon tripped, and slipped, and broke his neck, off a stair six inches high, and that was how telemon the cliff diver died**** i wrote that in the shower yesterday. :P i know stupid but kinda funi..........
UFSMA is going big i tell you... 
we're gonna win!!!!
oh if you don't know what UFSMA is: underground free speech movement of america.  **i really like the spell check thing...** **now if only they had a grammar check**

      saturday. yum. what happened today: i woke up. took a shower. worked on home work. worked on truck. blogged. ate strawberries in whipped cream. blogged again. slept. and now i am talking to moe, who is insane. but not as bad as me. ::cackles:: i think there are aliens that look like pizza. and if they ever decided to take over earth all they would have to do is get eaten and then they would slowly turn the human body they were absorbed into a slave. and then every one would be not human but still human and it would get really really confusing.
i think i shouldn't eat any more whipped cream....
but sugar highs are fun....
i'm not failing science. but i should be. and in multimedia all i do is make webpages that the school would not find to funi if they found them. not porn but just vampyre stuff. gods i'm not like falco (jj- :D)but this is the school where a group of three or more people wearing all black is banned. and clothes of the brand "southpole". but scott still wears his weed belt-buckle and i am wearing my "indecent exposure" (ok that was lame) stuff. and a knife. ::wiggles eyebrows:: i'm not goth i'm just me the girlio with scars and stalking problem...
i just realized that unless you know what i am talking about you have no idea why this is funny. and if you do know you're probably still wondering why this is funny. sorry. this is a lame night.

      i hate my life. typical teen-ager story... what's left to tell when billions have said it all before you? so i am living here in my mind, my escape from this screwed over world. so fun... i remember being happy once. it is the warm feeling that starts in your stomach and moves to encompass your whole body. like a warm blanket in winter. but i just remember. yeah i have friends, and food, and a place to go each night, and parents who love me. i know all that shit about how lucky i am. but if this is love i think i'll take hate. so i guess a blog is what? a place where you record your daily activities? a rantshoppe? i don't know so it is going to be exactly what i want it to be. my silent scream. pathetic melancholy idea, that. so "ooh when's the creepy music gonna come in?" so tragically tearfully. here's a twisted joke for you: my friends call me si, like spanish yes or the first letter of my name (c) but what they don't know is i like it because it stands for Self Injury. like cutters. like me. most of these scars are from me and my amazing razorblades. see how one moment they are silver, the next red? my arms, my hips, my legs, my neck, my hands and feet... i used to be able to stick one of those two-inch safety pins through my hand, between the first and second knuckles. used to because now the skin is all scarred over and to tough to pierce. i am one of the official freaks at school. it is amusing, watching all the other kids there, they think life begins and ends in high school. some prefect love stories, some hate and some gangs. they won't remember each other in five years. yes i am know i am cynical. but that's the way this cookie crumbles. i want a pet dragon. a little one that could sit on my shoulders and glare at people.

      went to morning work out again. six to eight, how fun!!!! but it was different this time. we did a circuit, 13 different stations compromised of 13 different pleasurable tortures. i still can't do V ups. nor can i do burpees of any worth. but i can do the mountain climbing thing; i went down to far and banged my knee so there was a little trickle of blood running down my shin for the remander of workout. heh. funi note. last night i was driving back home from practice (i drove all the way there from my house, about a half hour drive) and we get to this intersect. there are to left turn lanes, and my mom says go left because if we go straight there is a wicked evil blind curve to be taken at 60mph. so i go into the left turn lane. oops. she says "no, no! other lane!" as i'm turn so i slam on the brakes, almost sideswipe a guy in big yellow ford truck; luckly he was paying attention and managed to get out of the way. it was funny looking back, right then i was just p.o.ed because my mom hadn't explained exactly what she wanted me to do. just turn left, when there are two left turn lanes, does not work with me!!!! i need more specific directions or i will cause major accidents. ;) mad driver on the loose. for all you PNW people, WATCH OUT!!!!!!! fading's on the loose.....

      hey... some bad news today. skie might be sent to live with her mom, in seattle-ish. just because she lied about being on the phone. what else does her dad expect? if she is locked up all summer, no outside contact, of course she's going to try to break out. he should be glad she didn't run. i would have. but i was told to inform bird that she would be on today, around two or two thirty. i hope he gets on. it isn't like him to not live on the nets.

       What is the cause of the cosmos? Is it Brahman?
From where do we come? By what live?
Where shall we find peace at last?

What power governs the duality
Of pleasure and pain by which we are driven?

Time, nature, necessity, accident, 
Elements, energy, intelligence--
None of these can be the First Cause.
They are effects, whose only purpose is
To help the self rise above pleasure and pain.

       A zealous Christian who was trying to convert a Hindu found himself getting nowhere. "The thing is," argued the frustrated Christian, "you have to be born again!" 

"But I have been born again!" insisted the Hindu. "And again and again and again ..." 
well that sums things up pretty well. 
another thing i find: (off beliefnet's christian blogger) If it had a beat, it was labeled sin, with the strange exception of country music. I guess even Satan thought country music sucked.

      ::wink:: hi... ::yawn:: life is weird. ::dances:: especaily mine. ::wink:: demons can be catorized into three catorgories: lower, mid, and high. kysa are lower. i want one. they are slaves, basically. you can buy and sell them (with whatever-blood, money, sex, ect.) but they do what ever you tell them to do and have some small powers and some large powers, all of which are at your command. they aren't very loyal though, and will sell you out for freedom unless you bind them. the youngest ones are a pretty firey-orange colour, they turn darker and finally black as they age. when they die (they are completely spirit-body) they create eternal flames. so if one is near death it goes somewhere, like outer space, and snuffs there. the flames (which aren't eternal, really) emit a sort of "dark energy" until it has been completely dispersed. it is still there, just not gathered together.

      i think the world is drunk. or high. or maybe both. i'm not sure why i think that, i just do. freaky ass dream last night, one of  those  again. quite creepy. fun still, but any place any occasion i can be is fun. people i haven't seen in forever were there. the old team. blight verses truth again. i think we won this battle, but i don't know about the war. maybe the war itself is keeping balance. it was one of those victories where nobody is quite sure we won, the quiet and sorrow is overpowering. acts of courage and bravery unbelievable. new sights of horror. new ways to bleed, and cry. somedays i wonder. other days i just am. today is grey. no real. like being stoned, a bad tripp. fictional life of imaginary strife. adi ahya. "goodbye forever" but more like a sense of loss, deep sorrow. a door closed and locked. tearing apart, away, gone. never to return. death. i feel empty, sad. no new glories today. i don't see the point in anything at the moment. last night i was like i used to be. and today i am bound and banned again. if only if only.

(0.o maybe i should be a nike commercial??) yo but anywize still had fun, got tired-stoned at the end as always and some really really strange stuff got happening... new song: i am icecream man, running over people in my van. and (to the same tune) i'm on ext, little purple monkeys are chasing me... i think swimmers should be locked up in a special place. one with lots and lots of pools. chlorine yummm yum ^.^ well lets see... besides not getting my SSO times... nothing really happened. no captain speedo. can't wait for tommorow. time to breath all alone. listen to my music cranked way the hell up.

      so yeah i took first test in drivers ed today... and far from being hell on earth it was easy. first done, best score, and three pieces of candy instead of two cuz i just so fricking smart. now ain't that a change........ wooo hey guess what? bird shrunk! and his hair is longer, which is good cuz it used to be short. and i don't really like short hair, reminds me of computer nerds...  but he is one. so it is like a frickin paradox-ie. well oki i know y'all wants the facts, hmm  pity  i can't remember. he has a red bike though. and skie's daddy din't know he was going to be there otherwise she might not have been able to come cuz her dad is well,  a freak . not the good way either. so lets see..... oh they went missing about half-way through class (we were in the class room, they were out front on the couches) and mrs. teddy said, yeah andrea's gone, said she had something important to do, she'll be back around 5:30. oh and tanner's gone too. so everybody exchanged  looks . twas quite funi. 0.o and that is the report today. got night swim again, well will until the end of summer really. but so i eat dinner at six-ish, munch a bit til 7:30-ish, then go swim from 8:15-9:45 (only 1 1/2 hours at night, two in the sunrise workouts from six to eight). last night was hellish, all i.m.s and i  hate  i.m.s with a burning passion. even though apparently the i.m.s, both the 200 and 400, are "my thing". right, sure, whatever flaps your flag.... ;) loves and g'nite.

      i'm bored and can't think of anything meaningful to say. too mindrunk to type. i'm freezing in the middle of summer, how pathetic is that? little lostgirl is an icecube. ::shiver:: it is a wonderful happy day. sunshine no clouds, slight breeze. cherries are ripe and taste wonderful, fresh picked from the tree. but i am still freezing. blahg. you see my father-figure has this obsession with the thermostat never being above 70 degrees, summer or winter. not bad, you think, untill you have to live with it. put your hand in 70 degree water during the summer, it is nice and cool and refreshing. now stay in it for 24 hours and see if you don't catch hypothermia. grades are coming out soon. so scary. at least i didn't fail algebra, got a b in that. but the others i don't know, i may have failed multimedia. the teacher plays favorites with his boys and the yearbook people. don't get any advice unless you are one of them. and of course i am not. just the shadow in your memory, the dim impression of mass in your mind. heavens above and hells below, by what god did decide to freeze my toes? oh lol cool dream last night. i won't tell the details because i don't want to, i can remember. it was one of  those  dreams. the kind where you dream you got cut and wake up bleeding. body obeys mind, mind obeys soul, you are the soul. channel all anger, all fear, make that hot rage into a cold burning, slow fire running through your veins. that is power. cold, distant, utterly unknowing. use that. energy, karma, manna, it is the same. build it in your bones and release it. watch the world burn. watch your life fade.  be .

TOMORROW IS THE LAST DAY OF NINTH GRADE. AT 11:01 TOMORROW MORNING I WILL BE OFFICIALLY IN HIGHSCHOOL. this is the real world. it is now. i want to live it, to breath it, to feel the silken grime of life around my body.

       ONE AND A HALF DAYS OF SCHOOL LEFT.  
erm, hem. yay! i is so hapi hapi hapi. i need a tail so i can wag it instead of just wiggling my butt. have i said that before? w.e.l.l. anywize, we are taking a final in algebra the last two days of school, today and tomorrow, which i think is extremely sucky. sad and gay and everything perverted. and ronald regan is dead, another person famous and wise to past the boundaries of this little planet. pity. i think i would have liked him. a much  better  human than bush. current political situation: bored as hell and the future ain't looking brighter. disgusted in a distant, drug-haze way. ::skips off to the shower singing:: adi and g'night!

      glorious, glorious first swim meet of the outdoor season. how i love you. my time drops, the feel of the water freezing around my body, the sunburns, the tans, the mirrored goggles for backstroke, the sweet smell of chlorine at dawn. it is a beautiful feeling. the screams of the over-zealous swimparents, the coaches' whistles, the calls for races, they all combine to make an exquisite curtain of music that choreographs the dance of the athletes. the howling winds, the freezing temperatures, the desperate huddle for warmth with half-known strangers who become the best of friends in two minutes or less, the boiling sun the beats the energy and endurance out of my muscles that still manage to carry me through to the elusive first place. this is what i live for, this once a year brutish beating of the mind and body, the struggle and sweet victory.

      one thing to say on this day: i don't like! and you, my invisible friend, ask don't like what? and i will tell you the moment people stop reading over my gods be damned shoulder! which, really will be never. there is no such thing as your own life. i want to scream and scream and scream till the glass shatters and pierces their eyes.
 Fadeblack2whyt [8:52 PM]:  somebody shoot me quick, please 
 Fadeblack2whyt [8:56 PM]:  i remember once you asked me what was wrong. i tell you. even though you probably aren't there. 
 Fadeblack2whyt [8:57 PM]:  it is hard to put into words. sort of a ragged rage feeling deep inside. i want to howl. sometimes the pain is a release, sometimes it is a punishment. poor little lostgirl, so sad and tearful. all she wants is to die.
Fadeblack2whyt [9:01 PM]:  sometimes at night i sit there and i am lost so deep in my mind i cannot come out til morning. sometimes i make myself bleed. just to prove i am living, to let some of the pain go away, to recall what it is like living. sometimes i cry, yes me who never cries. so hard. i shake and my fingernails make my palms bleed.  i scream inside, but i can't get it out. too many people; always too many. not enough solitude. Peace.    
and that is all you need to know about poor little lostgirl tonite. adi world, adi...

      what if all we dreamed was real/
and waking we slip back into unreality/
all the storms and rainbows of life/
but the confusion of a sleep-torn mind?/
the things we think so real and meaningful/
-the untruth, the fool's dream/
what is this?/
this feeling-/
can i call it life?/
but if i am dreaming only to wake,/
dare i?/
this blood rushing, breath rasping in my throat/
eyes wide with terror, a silent scream unending/
back arched to breaking, muscles torn from bone/
 is it just a nightmare/
will i wake/
this dream no one is dreaming-/
will it end?/
one last breath and i scream, raw grating red/
one last thought and i am remembering/
not finding the calm they say  comes with death/
but that one last agony that is my death/
it is the only thought echoing down in my mind/
 
maybe my dream has just begun

      back again. for a night. no body on the nets, sorta boring. betcha all are just dying to hear what happened in my missingness. ^_^ the week at the lake, and swimmeet, went as follows::  friday:  swam the mile, the 200 free, the 200 IM. placed in all, got an A time in the 200 free.  saturday:  swam the 100 free, the 100 breast, the 400 free. did horrible in prelims, grand in finals. the 400 was a final-only swim.  sunday:  the 400 IM (ouch) the 200 breast, and the 50 free. died in the IM, of course. that race is refined torture, i swear. kick ass in the breast during finals, it was awesome. i love winning. total of 45 points for the team, not bad. not high point though. ;-( afterwards we all went to red robin for lunch/dinner, we were all swimmeet stoned. so fun. there was a cloud that looked like a pig. janelly, who raises pigs for ffa, said it looked like one of hers. 0.o i bet it did too. and that was the meet.  monday:  got ready to go up to lake. went up to lake. saw meg and trevor and kenny for the first time in a year or so.  monday thru thursday:  found out the boat was busted. thought we would get it back wensday. didn't happen. thursday, still not boat. we hung around on the docks and went to chelan one afternoon. forget to get the necklace i wanted (damn).  friday:  woke up and it was like a volcano had exploded. the fires up the lake had gotten completely out of control, at least doubled in size. no is quite sure exactly how big they got. but everything was covered in ash, like this poem i wrote last year, i'll have to post it some day. the sun was just a  small    red  disk  in the sky, it looked like  the end of the world . no one said anything, we just sat out on the deck in a sort of stunned silenced and watched the ash and burnt wood drift down the lake. we couldn't even see across the lake to manson, and that couldn't have been more than two miles away. three at the utmost. we got the boat back that afternoon though, and went out on the water anyways. was quite strange, not being able to see the shore as anything more than  a grey outline against   the lighter grey sky.   satuday(today):  went out on boat. tubed the tube out of the tube. two major crashes, the last one  hurt.  my uncle had bought this large two person triangle tube-thingy, and i would go with meg. since our combined weight is under 300 pounds, we got major air. and better whips. so terry(the uncle) was driving, and he is a crazy good driver for being pulled in a tube, and we get whipped out of the wake. we knew we were screwed for we were going over some huge ass wakes, but instead of the usual  wa -  bang    wa -  bang   it was just a nice smooth flight. and then the next thing i know i am under water with my bikini bottoms halfway up my intestines, trying to figure out what way is up. thank the gods for lifejackets. we think meg got knocked out, she was just floating around for a while. her bottoms went down to her ankles, good thing she didn't lose them. since she was on the inside the tube flipped her out and above me, according to kenny she flew for a while. then crashed. me being on the outside i apparently just cartwheeled into the water, then got smashed into it by the tube. i think that is when i forgot what happened. but it was awesome good fun, a very good no mercy ride. every one should experience something like that at least once.

      i'm sad. i want to talk to skie, only i don't. i don't feel like talking to anyone. but i'm bored of being alone, just surfing the net or reading all day. i feel grey. not like i could talk to her anyhow, she's gone right now. and from friday the 23(tomorrow) to august 8th,&nbsp;i most likely won't be on the nets. swim meet, cousins, camp. i hate how for the longest time i have nothing to do, then all of a sudden a huge ass rush. school is going to be scary, over a thousand kids this year and more next year. i don't like people. i hate being surrounded by them. makes me feel sick.&nbsp; i wrote something (again).&nbsp; we'll see how it works. &nbsp;&nbsp;behind that&nbsp; m a s k  i know you're crying  the others, those  p  u  n  k  s  and   wa nn ab es   
all they see is your .p.r.e.t.t.y. prep face  
even me, sometimes, even me   
you're everything we wanted  
everything we never had  
you have a father, a mother  
the big house on the hill   

a real good life   

jealousy, jealousy. turns me  green   
you're (sad) they don't know your (sorrow)  
afraid to try something different  
'cause, hey, this works-  
most days   

so this time i'll say sorry  
but next time, darlin, don't embarass me  
being seen with  .y.o.u.  ruins&nbsp;  m y &nbsp; social standing.  
i really hate having to go thru and put all the tags on. takes forever! but works. so yum and goodies.

       you know something, i think the car gods are conspiraring against me (along with the rest of the world, of course). but this is how it goes: tuesday: get backed into by some idiot who didn't know enough to look behind him before backing out. wensday: get pulled over by state patroll. apparently the back tail light was out. thursday: third drive for driver's ed. i can't wait to see what will happen!&nbsp; all we do is drive to a little town. i'll probably get sideswiped by a semi or something.

       i'm sick of trying
trying to define something meaningful   trying to see past the faux glitter   i'll just leave now. fall away!    its the trendiest way   we're all falling now-down into darkness   gothic makeup and fake fangs   little children of light and laughing   don't they know, they're a fashion disaster?   i've written a lot today.... i must be in a pissy mood.    or bored  . or a &nbsp;suicidal pathetic antention-starved forgotten artist?   hmm..... organized chaos is the game i am playing today.  i send my mind down into the abyss of unknown, and dredge from its dark depths the truth that no one can stand to see. it breaks me, brings me back from death's prepecipe. makes me laugh and smile, for i know that which you don't, and don't want to. power is my anti-drug! i don't need fake chemical rushes when i can have  this ! like falling in the stars' light, forever. safe in my danger, my insanity. lostgirl's losing it again!

      *****The moon is one, but on agitated water it produces many reflections.
Similarly ultimate reality is one, yet it appears to be many in a mind agitated by thoughts.***** ^_^ mwahahaha see  my  theory was right!
for ages and ages i've been trying to explain. thank you person!!!! my sense of the english has gone from bad to nonexistant... as you can tell from my spelling ::has given up on spellcheck:: i'm talking to skie... we are both are maniac depressedly and story-writing obesive. how about you just nod and smile, and please please don't ask.... i don't feel like explaining my serously screwed over (fucked up, messed down) mind. not only would it scare the average person shitless (ask john if you don't believe me) but i don't know it either! so its jacked and hopeless either way you go. ha! sweet revenge! dare to drink from me, i will hunt you down and drain you til you roll helpless on the ground, begging for your pathetic life... *_* i know i know i should go sleep, but i don't wanna. ::sticks tongue out:: hehehehe its  my life , natchos. poor skie. her life sucks even worse than mine:   TheNightsTears [10:27 AM]:    i'm mad... 
  TheNightsTears [10:31 AM]:   first,  miss being able to spend our 2 year anni with Tanner... then I miss andi's bday... and marissa's and casey's... and i missmeeting Tanner's and Casey's cousins... and i was supposed to hang out with them...  
  TheNightsTears [10:31 AM]:   and I was supposed to hang out with my mommy this summer  
  TheNightsTears [10:31 AM]:   and i was supposed to see haley and christian  
  TheNightsTears [10:31 AM]:   but i can't 
  TheNightsTears [10:31 AM]:   damn it alll -_-

      i wrote this. its not up to my usual godly prose :) but it'll do. i've got nothing else worthy of note to do...
 i watch them   so happy together   i smile with them   hang out, just friends   just like always     some days, yeah   some days i wish i could have him   only because i want some one   just for a day     then, later, they're all alone   and they don't care   they've got each other   over the miles and the years     i'm the one alone   i'm the unloved, the unneeded   but i smile anyways   just like always  
i don't think you need to ask what its about... but by the gods! its unfair for me. i don't care about them. and i don't care if that is a bad bad thing. why can't i have him back? that's i want. i'd be happy then. like it used to be, ages and ages ago. but those times never come back, do they? their just lost in the mist of time, a dream dreamt by a confused teenager, a crazy pagan witch. stupid of me to think it could ever be again. stupid stupid stupid. if only if only, lostgirl sighs, the light in the night was the light of your eyes...

      here. read  urlLink this . now go blogg! but besides that. i have my first drive for D.E. tommorow. problem: its a parking lot thing, and while i get real road driving quite well (except for the whole blinker thing, that is), but parking is NOT MY THING. i usually take up three parking spaces-or four, depending on which car i am in. heh so  yeah . whassup and all that grand nonsense poliet society uses. but just because it is not real doesn't mean it has no meaning, they are always digging for something. enough of the meaningful meaninglessness. hmmmmm bird really is insane. it's officail now. i don't care if already was before. oh hey i forgot to comment on the trials!¡!¡!¡!¡!¡! 1) michael phelps is going to slam the world record in the 200 fly. 2)it is awesomely funi to be a swimmer right now, as the announcers are continually trying to explain to the common american swimmer terms, or just forget the common american is too stupid to know swimmer terms. ::giggling:: 3)it is kick ass awesome to watch these inhumanly fast humans go and smash the impossible.

      positions reversed, we see, as indeed, no other eye has seen before. positions reversed, to see as it was as seen meant to be. this i hold, in truth as untruthfully my broken heart can sing, for the one i lost the one who could save me. this angry little girl, crying all her petti tears...

       urlLink    this is zingy. i drew him last night. i know the scan sucks, trust me he looks better in person. photoshop is still off line so i can't go through and fix him there. the reason he is all bent over and slouched looking is because i wanted him to look like that. he's sneaking around the back alley.

       well, i'm back. as you know, being the devoted readers that listen to my every rambling, i was away at camp. yes me, at camp. i did this mountainiering intensive thing. it was w o w... and this is how it went:   sunday  , arived. met counsolours (spectre and cat, explain later). found out we were sleeping in a tent on the beach instead of a cabin.    monday:   we hiked up to spider meadow, about five and half mile hike. very very beautiful place. a narrow valley between some incredible mountains, very green and scotland-like. a small river/creek runs thru the middle, so bright and clear. it looks like a fairy tale. during the night it starts raining, so all five of us (me, moe, bennet, cat, and spectre) sleep underneath a rock.    tuesday:   wake up and discover mice have eaten about half our food. at least we still have the yellow cake mix left. we then hike up to spider gap and into liman's (sp?) glacier. that was- amazying. for the first third we hike across the meadow and up a small moutian. then we climb a snow field/glacier thing. i'm talking hiking about a mile up hill through snow. in august. so crazy. there are two crevasses we must beware of, not very wide but quite deep. even though we have just gained about 1,800 feet in elevation, i for some strange swimmer reason are not affected. o.0. i begin to wonder if i am some mutant freak.  at the top of the snow field/glacier thing we have just hiked up is a small bowl. a pile of rocks at the top, in a more or less northerly direction, shows wich way we go. so we go. standing there, on the top of the bowl, we see lyman's glacier. a small chunk of alaska, now.  we slide down another snow field/glacier and i learn how to ski without skis. very awesome. we then procede to hope down a cliff made of piled up rocks, find a glacier stream and drink from it. the water tastes like heaven. we then lose the trail and deciced to hike in the general dircetion of a camp site spectre thinks is there. we find it finally, after trecking through some amazing back country. that hike from spider meadow up to lyman's glacier took about 6 1/2 miles. it was the best ever. this nite we sleep under some garbage bags but it does not rain.   wensday:    hike back to spider meadows.  this time we stay on the trail all the way to the gap. i find four vertabrae from some small animal. i think i'll make a necklace from them. we get rock climbing 101 b/c the smaller snow field/ glacier thing is much to steep to hike up, and the sides are rock. it was fantastic. spectre is a professional rock climber, and shows us the easy ways while he clambers around like spider man. quite strange. anywayz. we get back to the bowl, and while atempind to ski down to the bottom of it, fall on my ass and slide about 100 yards through the snow to come to a grinding stop about five feet from a pile of boulders that mark the far side of the bowl. please note that all i am wearing is my hiking boots, boys board shorts, and a tank top. i wear those for the entire hike, sleeping and waking. one my left thumb down to the middle of my palm it is numb for an hour or so. we ski down the snow field thingy, and me and bennet and spectre race the last bit. i nearly win, but two large rocks block my path at the end. stupid thingies. we get down to a picknic stop just beneath the snow field/glacier and there i do something incredible strange. a stream runs from the glacier and by the reststop. to large boulders block the stream and make a small pool. so what does silly lostgirl do? she goes swimming. i strip down to my bikini, spash around in the water. let me remind you about 100 feet away this water is still snow. :D it was one of the coolest things i have ever down. i felt very clean and good and healthy atferwards. cat and spectre thought i would die of hyopothermia.  then we hike back down to spider meadows and our old camp site.  another cabin from zanika (the camp) was coming so we decided to just set up there and wait for them. we waited. and waited. and waited some more. the hike that had taken us two and half hours had taken them four and a half. we felt very good about that. across the stream some girl scouts are camping. they sing songs and do all sorts of strange girl scout rites around a pitiful camp fire. the girls from jupiter (that is the cabin that hiked up here) are ungodly cheerful and energenic. we move to a different camp site. about 4:30 in the morning it starts raining. we move back under our rock. the jupiter girls have tents. we laugh at them, for we are hard core.    thursday:    we hike back to the trail head. it takes us one and a half hours. jupiter cabin, wich left an hour and fortyfive minutes before us, arives only five minutes and twenty three seconds before us (they timed the wait). we beat the girl scouts, wich had left about an hour before us. we smell bad and are amazingly dirty. jupiter cabin has to ride back to camp in the van with us. the windows stay wide open. when we get back to camp we eat at a table to ourselves. we smell to bad ;P. i think it very funny. we get to shower, and poor spectre gets tricked into going canoeing for five hours. he almost has to do the dirty face climb. it is very strange that though we only spent three nights away from civilization we all feel as though we have been gone much longer. the world has changed, or we have. it is not quite the same.  we spend   the rest of the week   sleeping, eating, and playing egyptain rat screw. i am now quite good at it. i light the wohelo (wo.rk he.alth lo.ve) fire again, since i am a ten year. i carry a stick wrapped in wood bark and witch's hair dipped in gasoline and say "i light the fire of wohelo, wohelo means love" then we have campfire. saturday i come home and take a shower. a very long shower. i still smell but don't care. then we go up to the lake and now it is   sunday   . that is that. hope y'all didn't die in my absense.
