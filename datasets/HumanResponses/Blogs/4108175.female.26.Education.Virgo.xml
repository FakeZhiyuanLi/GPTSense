       urlLink Theresa Heinz Kerry  spoke at today's Democratic convention with an impressive opening of greetings in several languages. Now that is a woman who can get my attention. I caught the speech on NPR radio, and I was quickly drawn to her unapologetically attitude.  Politicians are known for their showmanship, so I am not easily bought with the words they say. I do think, however, that Theresa's presence at this level of politics is a positive example of a worldly, intelligent human being who understands the intricacies of cultural differences through her education/career in languages.  How many U.S. politicians can claim him/herself as an avid student of foreign languages and cultures? When will the mainstream Americans recognize the connection between foreign language learning and the promotion of cultural harmony?

         It is hard to imagine how some of my young students survive their busy summer schedule. Being driven from camp to after-school activities to play dates, these children do not seem to ever get a break.  I did not realize the severity of the situation until yesterday afternoon when I conducted the usual session for four girls between five to seven years old. It was one of those days when I had to toss out whatever my lesson plan was and just went with the flow. The kids were irritable, hungry (even after a prolonged snack break), and as usual, painfully honest. Sometimes I forget to take negative comments in stride.

         J.L. and C.L. are two of my Mandarin students with Cantonese background and years attending Chinese school. What a joy this brother-sister team is to teach! With all the discipline of a model student, I never need to deal with attention or behavioral issues during class sessions.  The challenge for teen language learners seems to be keeping them interested and guiding them to fully utilize their vocabulary, sentence structure, and creativity. Some of the recent assignments I have come up with are:         Create a skit between a      teenage boy trying to solicit information about another girl from the      girl's school friend.    Conduct internet search of      unfamiliar phrases/expressions.    Bring a favorite music CD and      introduce it to an audience (updated version of Show-and-Tell).    Watch a Chinese movie and      provide verbal summary.    Read a comic strip and      comment on its style and humor.         Now how is that for a healthy dose of homework?

       I will be the first to confess that part of teaching is based on shopping for classroom materials, an activity that may explain why the majority of K-12 teachers are female :). My excuse for browsing various book stores and office supply stores is that Mandarin-specific teaching materials are hard to come by. After many hours in and out of dusty, cramped Chinatown bookstores, I relish the well-lit, air-conditioned chains despite lowered inventory of Mandarin books.  What puzzles me is that even in chains, there is a section dedicated to Spanish literature for children. I am not certain the percentage of Chinese population in other parts of the country, but I would think enough of them live in the Bay Area to form a target audience for book sellers.  Some of my recent acquisitions are:       A Chinese Character a Day Practice Pad  by  urlLink Philip Yungkin Lee  - contains both traditional and simplified characters, example expressions, and perfect for making classroom reproduction. Also by the same author:  250 Essential Chinese Characters for Everyday Use  Vol. 1 and 2.             The Composition of Common Chinese Characters: An Illustrated Account  (ISBN 7-301-03329-X/H-341) - bilingual (Chinese-English) introduction with detailed account of historical changes of the written form of individual characters. Humorous line drawings help convey the pictorial nature of written Chinese.     A series of bilingual story books by Pan Asian Publications including  Lady White Snake .   Even though Chinese book stores offer a greater variety of choices, from the perspective of a student, an easily accessible and affordable text is equally if not more important. So my 2-cents to the mainstream chains: start stocking up them Chinese books!

      潘世祺 (Shi4-Qi2 Pan1) is not only  urlLink the latest sensation  in the Taiwanese community as the first person who scored perfectly on computerized TOEFL, she has also shared her experience of learning English in the form of a "How-to" book. Yesterday Shi-Qi arrived the Bay Area for a year in Berkeley as an exchange student, and her family stopped by our house for a brief evening of rest as her father and mine caught up on old days when they were classmates in Taiwanese Navy.  Growing up in a tradition of standardized tests, I tend to be slightly over-sensitive towards their advocates or associates. When individuals are measured against one set of rules, the result is inevitably unfair and exclusive for neglecting individual differences. How do we define success? And how does that "success" measure up against quality of life? Clearly Shi-Qi is smart in utilizing her 15-minute of fame in the context where people look up to high scorers of standardized tests, and I applaud her for beating the system instead of being beaten like so many others. At the end of the day, happy or not, Shi-Qi will hopefully continue with her journey of language learning.
