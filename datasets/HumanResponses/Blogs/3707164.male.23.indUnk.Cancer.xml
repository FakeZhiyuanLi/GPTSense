(but who is TonyBlair… I m serious n dun tell me is England PM):)  Day 8 – always wake up quite early, bcos wanna go Sunday market mar… the market not selling fish or meat… it is place for public to sell their unwanted belongings, so basically most of the goods sold there are second hand (although there have new goods also). The goods sold there are very cheap. Hav fren bought a Nike jacket for just £1… soooo cheap leh…. Okie.. then I bought a glass, also not sure whether is crystal or just grass… but quite nice, so dun really care lor…. Then after lunch, hav a discussion for group discussion for wed… sad leh, Sunday bust still need 2 do assignment… last time, by this time, I should b playing badminton 1 mar… hahahahaha… long long time didn’t hav sport liao leh….  Day 9 – 2day have done another unusual thing tat I seldom or hardly do in my 4 yrs in TAR, tat is went 2 learning centre (same as library in Malaysia) to borrow SOME books…. The worst thing is I hav to carry all the books from the learning centre back all the way back to my room…. :p  But in the evening, we hav a quite delicious dinner.. hehehe, we hav our 2 best chef, Su Tsheng n Cher Ching prepare the dinner… hahaha.. . this thu cham liao lar, my turn… some1 help… hehehe…..  Day 10 – today is tue… so dun hav class… but need 2 wake up early, need to go to the laundry… if not go later, there will b many people…. Later hav discussion again… but satisfy with the outcome as manage to finish the preparation for the presentation… so now can start to concentrate on other assignment… hehehe….

      Wat my feeling toward Sheffield??? Cold, cool and a bit of disappointment.   Cold – although now is summer, but the weather was quite cold especially the 1st day. It was a gloomy day and rain late of the day. The temperature was below 10 degree Celsius. Then the other days was like the weather in Genting Highlands and sometime even cooler then Genting… but I quite like the weather here, u can walk for hours with out any sweat in the afternoon. Believe it or not….  Cool – the cars, building, scenery and bla blab la were cool. After a few days here, I can see all my dream cars, Ferrari, Lambogini, Lotus, GTO, FTO, Impreza, BMW (the model tat drove by James Bond) and many many more tat I dunno the name. however, there is proton here also. Oh ya, kancil also got. Taken photo somemore… hahaha : p  oh.. bout the building, most of the building may seem a bit old, but inside the building was very nice and class leh…. E.g. Sheffield Hallam Uni… : )  Disappointment – cant get into the apartment type of accommodation as wat the told us earlier as we are the last batch… okie, dun mind bout it… but some of us (include me) was place in Marshall Hall (it is the name of the block and not a hall) for temporary as need to wait the full time student to move out from Broomgrove Hall – the hostel we suppose to stay in. tat mean cant unpack and buy all the necessities. Then there is not internet connection in our room.  Day 1 – reach the Manchester airport at bout 5.30am. but the sky was very bright liao, now summer mar, hav daylight from 5am till 10 or 11 pm. The airport is much smaller than KLIA…. Dun have much activities for the 1st day.. just that in the afternoon, our senior bring us to the Sheffield City and a Chinese groceries store… didn’t buy anything as still in temporary accommodation. … then most of the shop is close on Sunday. So there is very quiet and dun hav much people around the city. It was a tire day and sleep at 10 pm (I cant remember when is the last time I slept so early… ) as I dun have any good sleep in the plane and bus…. Hehe…  Day 2 – wake up very early… bout 5 something in the morning… since my orientation will onli start at 9.30, so force myself into sleep again… hehe… I not pig lar, was still very tire leh…. The worst thing is we have to walk for 30-40 min to my uni. As usual the orientation start ed with a welcome speech, then registration, payment of fees and bla  bla bla…. Nothing much to say bout today….  Day 3 – hav a day off… but still hav to wake up early as need to go to the Hallam Union to get the ticket to Manchester and Bath (which it hav a limited seat).. will post up the photo after visiting those places… : )  After tat, as usual, shop for some necessities… we when to he market, I mean wet market. Just like in Malaysia, there is butcher, fish stalls, fruits…. But the diff is that their market r much more cleaner tat Malaysia n no bargaining….Not far from the market is the Peace Garden, a garden built to remember those warrior from Sheffield tat killed in wars. Many were  sun-bath there as today hav nice sunshine (which wont get this everyday)….. I was so happy leh today as Brian, Su Tsheng, Joyce, Rachel, Li Ping, Jo Anne, Cher Ching and Gim May have a simple celebration for my birthday… the 1st time celebrate my birthday at foreign country… hehehe …    Day 4 – classes started today… so dun hav activities going on… just tat evening cook our own dinner… tis is the 1st time we have rice since we reached Sheffield…. So cham…. Hehehe… : p  Day 5 – finally we can move into Broomgrove Hall (remember??? The place we will stay for the rest of the time in Sheffield).. now can unpack all my belongings…. I was place in room 504,… okie very satisfy wif it, hav a nice scenery…. Hehehe…. Dun worry… will take photo also… hahahaha…  The is a television room… so watched the Euro 2004 match between England n Portugal… eh, wat happen 2 Beckam (missed 2 penalty kick liao), any so call Beckam fan can tell me… disappointed wif England performance (although I m not an England fan)… however the match was exciting leh….  Day 6 – nothing special… just attend lecture….at nite, we hav study grp…eh, wat wrong, 2day is fri nite n 1st week of class… I start doing my tutorial!!!  Something wrong wif me??? Okie.. I m still okie... just feel a bit weird… : ) … but feel good lar, atleast complete something… hehehe  … fri nite mar, so after tat lepak at Brian’s room lar…  Day 7 – 9.45am woke up, should b the latest I woke up since reach Sheffield (not like me leh)…. : p  2day didn’t go for the trip to Warwick Castle, so wat the activities going on, okie, we when to Netto, the cheapest supermarket as told by the seniors…. They mayb right, the goods are quite cheap…so all of us buy quite some stuffs… it look like we torturing ourselves… we hav to carry our stuffs (which is heavy) all the way from Netto back to our room… which took bout 45 mins to 1 hour leh…. I think is the 1st n last time…
