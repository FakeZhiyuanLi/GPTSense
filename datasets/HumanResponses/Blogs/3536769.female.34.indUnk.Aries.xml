      i didn't think i would smoke cigaretts again.  but that was the way i chose to deal with issues - loneliness, heartbreak, and sadness.  i am not going to contact Bill. it used to hurt so much when i thought about bill.  but the pain seems to fade away. i am going to settle what is left between me and bryon.  i have to admit that he helped me to rebounce.  through him, i have learned a lot.  i enjoyed listening to the music he liked and learning dancing.  also realized how important to be reliable and responsible.    i am moving on. this is a new chapter of my come back to the right direction. i am going to start my routines again.  quit smoking.  eat right.  be happy. adventurous, smiling, and carefree.  time is precious.  i don't want to dwell on the past.  there are some important names that i still want to keep in touch with.  Troy, Ryan, Cleo, Jens.  Troy has a special place in my heart.  sometime i really wonder what it is like to live with him.  because of him, i definately began to appreciate this area has to offer.  cleo is kind of mistery.  i'll have to see what happens between us.  i don't think i know him well.          there are plenty of people that i can get to know in this world.  don't think twice.

      it is 12:33 am.  wednesday early morning.  why am i lettling bryon affect my life like this?  he is the best sex partner no doubt about it. but when he is not here, i am so lonely.  he didn't even call me tonight. he said he would.  i need to think about the way to treat him just as a sex partner.  no more no less.  i want to be able to enjoy sex with him but without being serious.  without having him make me anticipate and wait for him.  would that be possible?  what would it take to do that? these are things that i need to do; quit smoking work out 2-3 times a week stop calling bryon find someone else that i like to have sex and hang out with go out more maybe i should hang out with rich or someone from craiglist. maybe allen would be nice for that.  or jason?  or.... mark?  someone who is from hotornot..  need to choose... carefully.

      saturday afternoon... i am checking emails and voicemails.   spencer invited me to SF to hang out in mission.  i might do that.  i am unsure that if this is going to be fun.  he is too intense and serious most of the time.  i guess it is still better than sitting at home.  i have done that a lot lately.  it has something to do with Bryon honestly.  why is he not calling me?

      I don't think that bill is truly honest with me.  he has probably feelings for me.  but he probably wants to fuck everybody.  he might have one or more girls like me who he wants to date and be intimate with.  who cares.. it is over.  i just hope that he doesn't make it sound like i am the love of his life.  i KNOW clearly that is not the case.  If it is the case, he would not have done a lot of things that i know he did.  no details...  but i know what i know.   we had a lot of magical moments together.  i think he would have been happy with me.  and I would too.

      Today is the third day since i quit smoking cigaretts. every day it gets a little bit easier.  like everything else...   I have been reading bill's journals.  i don't understand how anyone wants to stay married but in love with someone else?  why do people create such a difficult situation?  that is beyond my comprehension.  reminds me of the song by Nelly, "dilemma".  he is a good writer. no doubt about that.  it is fun to read his writings. i am so close to complete my projects around the house.  when the garden looks presetable and my rooms are cleaned up, i can finally put my feet up and relish the outcome of my labor. i want to make every corner count and shine. i will celebrate it for months.
