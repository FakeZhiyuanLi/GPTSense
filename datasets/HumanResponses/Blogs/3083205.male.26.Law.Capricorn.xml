      To readers whom it may concern,  Expect less blog activity here for the next few weeks.  Law school finals are beginning in one week and I need to hit the books.  I'll be doing some light blogging in the meantime.    It's been almost a full month since this site has been up.  Thanks for reading!  I have recieved a few emails from readers and it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.  By the way, if you want contact: ccohen (at) gmail dot com is the addy.    I am still looking into getting my nice shiny new blog up.  It'll probably be about 5 more weeks until I do though.  I'm debating what company to go with but am leaning towards typepad.  Got any ideas for a domain name?  I have a few but I'm up for suggestions.  Hope all is well.    Chris Rush Cohen

      California has taken the step of banning the use of Diebold's electronic volting machines from their elections.  It is about time someone took action on this.  Not only are the machines totally buggy, as Californians discovered during a recent election, but the company itself was busted when some college students posted a bunch of emails from workers there that said basically that they knew the machines didn't work well and could be easily hacked (Diebold tried to attack the students and university using copyright law to force them to take down the documents).  Also, the owner of the company is a die hard Republican donor who has promised to " urlLink deliver  votes to the  urlLink president ."   "It is a good day for democracy," said Aviel D. Rubin, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University and a leading critic of the company's technology. "Those machines are poorly designed and full of bugs and security flaws." Michael Wertheimer, a former official of the National Security Agency who tested Diebold machines at the request of the state of Maryland and found that the election systems could be easily hacked by insiders or outsiders, said that the stringent action was appropriate and that the problems with the machines could be addressed. "They're absolutely fixable said Mr. Wertheimer, but "the time for mea culpas are behind for all of these companies. They have to get out front and say, `We are going to make these systems secure.' "    If you thought Florida 2000 was a mess, wait until November, when a bunch of states will use these machines without paper trails.  If there are questions of accuracy after the votes are in, there wil be no way to count them at all, so we'd have to let the Supreme Court decide for us again.  Diebold may even be facing  urlLink criminal charges in California  at the moment.  Yikes.  Maybe this sounds crazy, but shouldn't a voting machine company at least have the appearance of being apolitical?  Via  urlLink The New York Times .

      The younger generation will never know what it is like to receive a call and not know who is going to be on the other end.  Because of caller ID, we know always know who is calling - and caller ID comes standard with all cell phone plans.  Many people (such as myself) do not even have home phones anymore, cellphones are ubiquitous.  Engadget notes:   [C]ellphones are making people so accustomed having the person they’re calling be the person who answers that they’re dispensing with all the usual pleasantries of introductions, salutations, or even asking for the person they’re calling for, and instead launching right into conversations, oblivious the fact that it could be someone else they’re speaking with.

      The ACLU recently released the fact that they are involved in a secret lawsuit against the FBI challenging their ability to secretly subeona ISP's for records about users.  The FBI obtained this ability with the passing of the Patriot Act.  They may now obtin record without judicial oversight, and keep anyone from talking about it.  Another related power, that I will not address, is the sneak and peek provision of the Patriot Act, which actually allows the FBI to conduct physical searches without notifying the owner of the property until much later.  Kinda sounds like a due process problem because there's no judicial oversight.   The FBI can issue national security letters, or NSLs, without a judge's approval in terrorism and espionage cases. They require telephone companies, Internet service providers, banks, credit bureaus and other businesses to produce highly personal records about their customers or subscribers.  People who receive the letters are prohibited by law from disclosing to anyone that they did so. Because of this legal gag order, the ACLU was forced to reach an agreement with the Justice Department before a heavily edited version of the lawsuit could be unsealed.   The ACLU couldn't even disclose the existence of the lawsuit until now.  That is disturbing.    Via  urlLink The Washington Post .

      The XBox is on the come-up.  In the past one of XBox's greatest weakness (and Paystation 2's greatest strength) has been their inability to woo game designers to make exclusives for their box (and thus take advantage of the XBox's greater power).  Times they are a-changin'.  Also, the XBox is actually overtaking the PS2 in monthly sales now, although it could never hope to sell more in general.    Some games being made soley for the XBox that are on their way - Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict & Doom 3.  These are both bound to be huge sellers, which will strengthen its rep as the top box for FPS's.   Sony has prevailed up to now on symbiotic advantages: it sells more consoles because it has many of the most popular games, often exclusively, and developers of those games are attracted by the sheer number of PlayStation users. If Microsoft can woo more developers to Xbox, the balance of power in the next round could change.   Word.  XBox has the power, it just needs the software.

      The FTC recently held a  urlLink workshop on spyware issues .  If you don't know:   In general, spyware - called adware by its proponents - is software that shows up on a computer unannounced, often because the owner has signed up for a free service like a file-sharing network or has agreed to receive messages in return for gaining access to a Web site. The software usually delivers pop-up ads, but sometimes performs other actions without the owner understanding what is going on or how to stop it.  ...  The activities of spyware programs can be relatively benign, obnoxious or even blatantly illegal. Computer users may be driven to distraction by pop-up ads, some pornographic, or find that their PC's become sluggish, laboring under the computing burden of the unwanted programs. Some programs monitor Internet use or even record keystrokes, such as password entries.   Even legitimate companies like Yahoo!, Amazon, and Microsoft are wary of allowing the states to create anti-spyware laws for several reasons.  Among them are a concern that there will be different laws in every state, which is hard to work with; and that uninformed legislation will outlaw legitimate uses of programs that may or may not be considered "spyware" - like cookies that record user information and other helpful tracking programs (there are helpful ones).  This article points out that what typically happens, as with the CAN-SPAN act, is that several states will make legislation, then the interested parties will lobby Congress to make a new one without teeth to supercede all the state laws.    Truth be told, some of the main reasons that spam and spyware are such problems is a lack of consumer education - people don't realize that when they download freeware and shareware it comes with spyware as part of a "drive-by download."  Users even unwittingly agree to have it on their computers often time, they just click the "I Agree" button.  Do yourself a favor and get a spybot killer (I recommend  urlLink Search & Destroy ).  By being a smart user you can avoid all these troubles.  The answer to making the Internat a pleasent place to be may well not be to regulate the applications on the Internet, but to be a smart user who utilizes programs to aid you (spybot killers, pop-up killers).  Also, whenever you write your email address online write it out, but not as a link.  For instance, my email address is ccohen at gmail dot com.  Get it.  That way crawlers that harvest email addresses can see it.  Also, as for stopping pop-ups (which are often caused by spyware) get yourself the  urlLink Google toolbar , it rocks.  An attorney points out -   "[WhenU's] business model, and Gator's business model,'' Mr. Zeidner said, "is to put this [spyware/adware] on computers faster than the public is being educated and removing it from their computers."

      A new music group has released its first album as ringtones instead of on CD.  The group is called Super Smart and the "album" is called Panda Babies.  Weird.   Super Smart say this is because they want to avoid interference from the major labels, but it is no doubt a useful gimmick to attract media attention.   Apparently there is a music label that is trying to create a new version of music star - ones who become famous by releasing albums as ringtones only.  A good concept, especially for Europe and Asia.  US consumers are into ringtones, but not like Brits or Japanese.  Via  urlLink The BBC .

      This just seems wrong, but the fact is that the courts have determined that when you are in your car you are in a public space and therefore have no reasonable expectation of privacy.     One of the nation's wealthiest towns will soon have cameras and computers running background checks on every car and driver that passes through.  Police Chief Clay Walker said cameras will take infrared photos recording a car's tag number, then software will automatically run the numbers through law enforcement databases. A 911 dispatcher is alerted if the car is stolen or is the subject of a "be on the lookout" warning.   If you land on the "be on the lookout" list another camera will take a picture of your face!    Another reason this should be ok is that it isn't discriminatory in who it takes pictures of in the same way an officer may be.  The cameras and computers will check everyone, not just people of a certain ethnicity or from a certain county.    If you are a robber looking for a jackpot head to Manalapan, check it out:   Manalapan's town council authorized $60,000 in security upgrades last week after three burglaries this winter robbed residents of $400,000 in jewelry. The town averages two or three burglaries per year and residents demanded swift response   Get used to it, this is a trend.  There are already thousands of cameras in cities all over the US and the EU watching all the time.  For some reason this situation seemed newsworthy because it involves cars just driving through, but the fact is your on camera fairly often if you live in certain areas of NYC or London.  As the price of surviellence equipment drops and as facial recognition software becomes more effective these stories will keep on coming.  Via  urlLink ABC News .

      That's right.  Soak kevlar vests in this new solution and you've got some pretty effective and high tech armor.   This type of body armor is light and flexible, which allows soldiers to be more mobile and won't hinder an individual from running or aiming his or her weapon.    "During normal handling, the STF is very deformable and flows like a liquid. However, once a bullet or frag hits the vest, it transitions to a rigid material, which prevents the projectile from penetrating the Soldier's body," said Dr. Eric Wetzel, a mechanical engineer from the Weapons and Materials Research Directorate who heads the project team.     "The sky's the limit," said Wetzel. "We would first like to put this material in a soldier's sleeves and pants, areas that aren't protected by ballistic vests but need to remain flexible. We could also use this material for bomb blankets, to cover suspicious packages or unexploded ordnance. Liquid armor could even be applied to jump boots, so that they would stiffen during impact to support Soldiers' ankles."    Apparently the armor is even stab resistant, something that normal kevlar can't do.  Sounds good, lets get it out there in the field.  There have been ongoing complaints from soldiers that they are too lightly armored.  Families have been buying their children body armor and sending it to them in Iraq because the military is short.  Also, the soldiers in Iraq are short on armored Humvees.  I read somewhere that the military was disallowing the custom modifications some soldiers were making on the vehicles because they weren't official equipment.  Something's gotta be done about all that, the least they can do is equip these guys properly (it keeps morale up too).  Article  urlLink here .

      Here's a  urlLink BBC article on MoBlogging  (Mobile Blogging).  Moblogging is typically accomplished using a cell phone with a camera on it.  Take the pic and email it to an account that puts it up on your blog.  My new and improved blog, to make it's debut in late May or early June will have such capabilities (although I still need a nice new camera phone).  The article is worth a quick read if your unfamiliar with this fairly new phenomenom.

      The first lawsuits based on the CAN-SPAM Act were filed today against some spammers who were sending out email advertising diet pills.  They were doing some naughty things forbidden by the CAN-SPAM Act, such as; 1) falsifying their header information; 2) hijacking relay computers to send the spam for them; 3) not providing a physical return address; 4) not providing information that personally identified the sender; 5) sent more than 100,000 spam emails during the course of a year (millions in this case); etc.  The articles don't say these are the parts the spammers violated, but I'm taking a guess it is these provisions, and probably a few others.  These guys could be facing jail time, also, they will have to give up all of the money they have made from the operation, anything they have bought with that money, and all of the equipment and programs they used to send the spam.  OUCH!  Let the spammer smack-downs begin!   Court papers identified the four as Daniel J. Lin, James J. Lin, Mark M. Sadek and Christopher Chung, all believed living in suburban Detroit. They were accused of disguising their identities in hundreds of thousands of e-mail sales pitches and delivering e-mails by bouncing messages through unprotected relay computers on the Internet.   Much like their email return addresses:    The Lins and Chung could not be located at any of the addresses or telephone numbers listed in the court documents.   How Ironic.

      Now there's  urlLink AllOFMP3.com  serving up music by the Gig!  As the Russian site asks: "Is it legally to download music from site AllOFMP3.com?"  Well...   All the materials in the MediaServices projects are available for distribution through Internet according to license # LS-3М-03-79 of the Russian Multimedia and Internet Society. Under the license terms, MediaServices pays license fees for all the materials subject to the Law of the Russian Federation "On Copyright and Related Rights". All the materials are available solely for personal use and must not be used for further distribution, resale or broadcasting.   Users are held liable for the use and distribution of the MediaServices site information materials according to local legislation.    And you can get the music in any of several formats or levels of quality, check it out:   The AllOFMP3.com provides a service called "Online Encoding". Online Encoding is a unique technique of online audio files encoding, which enables you to get music in the format (MPEG-1 Layer 3 - MP3, Windows Media Audio - WMA, Ogg Vorbis - OGG, MusePack - MPC, MPEG-4 AAC, etc.) and in the quality you prefer. By choosing compression method and bitrate, you regulate the quality of the resulting (encoded) files.    If you are afraid of giving your credit card number to some wierdo Russian company don't worry, you can use  PayPal ! Best of all, the price is 1 or 2 cents per mg, depending on the download (which makes it about 96 cents less per song than iTunes).   The full price per Gig then is between $10 and $20 dollars!   If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is -- this is clearly illegal in the US, and I bet that's where you live isn't it?  On the other hand, you better get yours while the gettin' is good, 'cause I don't see this lasting too long.  The RIAA probably already hired some ex-KGB assassins to go get these suckers.

      This is way cool.     US firm Microvision has developed a system that projects lasers onto the retina, allowing users to view images on top of their normal field of vision.    It's only a matter of time before we can use this to enhance regular old life and even to enter virtual realities.  Bring it on.   "Seeing is believing and seeing these images floating in front of you at about arms length distance is pretty incredible.  Reality can be enriched by having more detailed information about what you see."    Honda is already using the technology in car production.   The system has been years in the making and has only just come into commercial usage in the car industry, with Honda using it in its dealerships.   The first generation product, called the Nomad Expert Technician System, consists of a wireless computer and a hi-tech monocle, costing around $4,000.    Check this out.   There is still work to be done but potentially the system could become second only to tapping into the optic nerve in terms of getting images to the brain.   It could provide three dimensional pictures in perfect colour, able to simulate near or distant objects with complete realism, which could provide gamers with an intense sense of reality.    Maybe we can expect such a system with the XBox 3?  Via  urlLink The BBC  and  urlLink Engadget .

      Stick it to 'em!  The government is going to raise the cost of purchasing the "Do-Not-Call List."     The proposal drew immediate criticism from the telemarketing industry. It represents "the ongoing, literal persecution of the teleservices industry," said Tim Searcy, executive director of the American Teleservices Association, which represents more than 600 call centers.    Awwww, we really feel bad for you, especially after we hung up on one of your friends this evening during dinner.  There should be tougher legislation concerning telemarketing - like with the CAN-SPAM act (as ineffective as it is) which provides a civil action and remedy per unsolicited phone call (and criminal suits if there has been over 1,000 unsolicited emails in one year).  There is the  urlLink Telephone Consumer Protection Act  which forbids unsolicited faxes ("junk faxes"), "autodialer" calling, and prohibits telephone solicitation calls to homes before 8 am or after 9 pm.  Unfortunatly niether the law nor the enforcement of it is very tough - the FTC has received 300,000 complaints from people claiming violations of the Do Not Call List and has yet to fine any telemarketing company.     urlLink Get on the list here , it does help.

       Poutine   Poutine is a culinary delight native to Quebec, and  urlLink people are taking notice .  It's good stuff:   Quebec's signature dish, made of fried potatoes covered with melted cheddar cheese curds and gravy, is slowly spreading beyond Canada and winning fans as far away as New York City and Florida. But the really big culinary news is that poutine is becoming haute cuisine.   I don't know about being haute cuisine, but it sure is damn good.  I have yet to see poutine in NYC, but I am looking forward to finding it.  Shockingly, poutine has been thought of as junk food and Quebecois were ashamed of their dish:   "People were ashamed to say, 'I want to go to a restaurant to eat poutine,' " said Mr. Picard recently in an interview at his restaurant. "You'd eat it at 3 in the morning when you are drunk or after a party..."    "When you go to a restaurant for a salad, you have a problem," he said with a stern look..."And when you eat poutine, it makes you happy."   Truer words were never spoken.  Quebecois chefs are getting creative with poutine in an attempt to make it more popular, one of them is even putting foie gras on it.  If you've never been to Montreal, go go go, it's a wonderful city.  Have a poutine and a "point" for me while you're there.    The Da Vinci Code   Typically, if I see everyone reading a bestseller book on the subway I assume it must be total trash.  Nearly every day last year I saw someone reading "The Da Vinci Code," either on the subway or where ever else.

      I got myself a fresh new Gmail account today.  These accounts are still of limited availability, apparently they are still testing the system.  Anyway, I am just bragging.  Here are some interesting portions of the privacy policy:   By using Gmail, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this policy. If we make any significant changes to this policy, we will notify you by posting a notice of such changes on the Gmail login page.   You should know:  We collect limited account information and store and maintain your account and email messages on our secure servers.  We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission.  We serve highly relevant ads and other information as part of the service using our unique content-targeting technology. No human reads your email to target ads or related information to you without your consent.  You can update your account information and preferences at any time.  To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time Gmail is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the Gmail service.  ...  Email contents and usage. The contents of your Gmail account also are stored and maintained on Google servers in order to provide the service. Google's computers process the information in your email for various purposes, including formatting and displaying the information to you, delivering targeted related information (such as advertisements and related links), preventing unsolicited bulk email (spam), backing up your email, and other purposes relating to offering you Gmail. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of email may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination of your account. Google employees do not access the content of any mailboxes unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect Google or the public.   We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of Gmail. Information displayed or clicked on in your Gmail account (including UI elements, ads, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the Gmail user interface, preventing fraud within our advertising system, and better targeting related information.  Google will never sell, rent or share your personal information, including your Gmail address or email content, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.  ...  How we deliver targeted content to you.  We never share your personally identifying information with any advertiser as part of this service, unless you specifically ask us to do so. When you are logged into your Gmail account, Google will display targeted ads and other relevant information based on the content of the email displayed. In a completely automated process, computers process the text in a message and match it to ads or related information in Google's extensive database. No human reads your mail to target ads or other information without your consent.   Advertisers receive a record of the total number of impressions and clicks for each ad. They do not receive any personal information about the person who viewed the ad. If you click on an ad, Google will send a referring URL to the advertiser's site identifying that you are visiting from Gmail. Google does not send personally identifying information to advertisers with the referring URL. Once you are on the advertiser's site, however, the advertiser may collect personal information about you. Google does not control or take responsibility for the privacy policies of other sites.   Google may send you information related to your Gmail account or other Google services. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.   When we may disclose your personal information.  As a standard email protocol, when you send an email from your Gmail account, Gmail includes your email address and user name in the header of the email. Beyond this, we do not disclose your personally identifying information to third parties unless we believe we are required to do so by law or have a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) enforce the Gmail Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (including, without limitation, the filtering of spam), (d) respond to user support requests, or (e) protect the rights, property or safety of Google, its users and the public.    Nothing shocking here, however, a privacy maven I spoke with last week got me thinking.  As a student of law, one is trained to consider the legal ramifications of a party's actions, but in the real world there are many other considerations; such as the reputation and goodwill of the company involved.  Here, Google has taken a beating recently, they look more suspicious all of a sudden.  Also, it is entirely possible for such information as Gmail will use to serve ads to be collected and aggregated in ways that would be considered an abuse of privacy even though not in violation of any statute.  While most will be quite pleased to have a Gmail account (with it's 1 Gig of memory), we all must maintain an awareness of the uses of our personally identifiable information.  I trust Google because they have a reputation to uphold and plenty of pressure from outside consumer advocates, but I wouldn't trust most online companies for anything.    If you want to get in touch with me, my new Gmail account address is:  ccohen at gmail dot com

      Whoa there pardna!  Be glad this guy isn't the head of the FTC, otherwise the only thing on TV would Seseme Street and Lawrence Welk reruns:   "I don't think censorship is a bad word, but it has become a bad word because everybody associates it with some kind of restriction on liberty," said Mr. Boone, who is in Washington making the rounds as the national spokesman for the 60-Plus Association, a conservative senior citizen lobby.    Censorship is not a restriction on liberty?  An interesting interpretation of words I though I knew the definitions of.  Oh wait a second, here we go:   Mr. Boone said that if he were in charge of standards, there would be stringent controls on material.  "It must be majority approved ... voluntary ... and self-imposed," he said, clad in a yellow blazer, black slacks, a canary yellow tie and white leather shoes. "Censorship is healthy for any society, and that goes for arts, entertainment, anything. Self-imposed means that the majority of people say that is what we want, and it can be changed if people's attitudes change, which is how a democratic society works."    Ok, there are so many problems with this paragraph.  Lets be glad this guy isn't in charge of standards because if he was, we would all have to  volunteer  to censor ourselves due to his majority rule.  Well, he got one thing right...in a democratic society you have to learn to live with things you don't like - nasty curse words even!  One of the beauties of a democratic society is that even those who's views are at the margins can say what they want.  A guy like this is one one end of the spectrum, maybe Howard Stern is at the other.  I never listened to Stern (maybe a few times), but I think it is a shame that no one can now - only because of what it represents about the mood of the country.  How did a tit cause such an uproar?  And how did people who espouse these views come to hold such power in our country?  Via  urlLink The Washington Times .

      It seems that legislaters are finally getting worried about spyware and adware, or at least the FTC is, which is a step.  The CDT is on the case:   "There's a number of concerns about spyware, which is that it takes away consumers' control over their computers," said Ari Schwartz, associate director of the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. "We consider privacy to be a control issue as well," and many spyware programs act as surveillance tools for advertisers without the users' consent, he said. In February, the group filed a complaint with the FTC arguing for stricter enforcement against two companies involved in using software for allegedly deceptive and unfair ads.    Many users do not realize it, but almost anytime you download shareware - free online software such as P2P programs, screen savers, or icons - you also get some spyware or adware.  You probably even agree to it by clicking a box after a long end-user agreement you didn't read.  This is called a "drive-by download."  These small spyware programs that are placed onto your computer allows the company or person who created the spyware to have access to your computers controls and settings and also allows them to track your web usage.  In theory, they could also steal information like your credit card numbers, it is only a matter of time before someone does this and causes serious problems for lots of people.    It seems that this method of drive-by downloading (as well as some spyware which is placed on your computer without any warning) is an unfair and deceptive business practice.  I believe that is the thrust of the CDT's argument to the FTC.  Hopefully the FTC will listen up.    (Get a spyware killer - I recommend  urlLink Search and Destroy , which has worked well for me.)

      I think the most significant factors accounting for the recent drop in CD sales are; 1) heavily marketed pop music is in a  urlLink sorry state ; and 2) CD's are just too damn expensive (people aren't rolling in loot like in the 1990's after all).  Because of this drop in sales, which certainly  urlLink aren't   urlLink all   urlLink attributable   urlLink to   urlLink music   urlLink downloading ,  urlLink if   urlLink at   urlLink all   urlLink according   urlLink to   urlLink recent   urlLink studies , the music industry is probably going to get powerful new copyright weapons to fight piracy with.  Therefore the music industry actually has only mariginal interest in working to help make online music sale systems like iTunes sucessful.  The industry needs to be able to continue claiming that CD sales are hurting and not being replaced by online music sales.  So what do they do... urlLink make purchasing the music online even more expensive than buying the CD's !   For instance, Janet Jackson's "Damita Jo" goes for $16.99 on iTunes, while the CD will run you $9.99 at Best Buy. Indie-rockers Modest Mouse's "Good News for People Who Love Bad News" carries a $13.99 price tag at iTunes, while Barnes & Noble's Web site lists it at $9.73...Apple says that any higher prices are influenced by what the record labels charge the company for each release. The labels, meanwhile, insist that they don't control stores' price tags. The wholesale prices they set leave room for retailers to choose their own profit margin -- which can be less than zero, in the case of CDs sold as loss leaders.   Most consumers out there, including myself, wouldn't even accept Janet Jackson or Modest Mouse tunes if they were free.  Perhaps the quality of the music is a huge part of the problem?

      A few weeks ago I walked into a video game cafe in the East Village just for a quick look-see.  It is called " urlLink Game Time Nation ," and basically you can rent a machine and chill out and play whatever game you want.  You get charged by the hour, but I recall that the fee was pretty reasonable, around $5 an hour.  The place is basically like an updated version of the old-school arcade.  There are a bunch of chairs and couches gathered around loads of monitors.   urlLink The New York Times has an article  about the spot now - go check out the pics.  An owner of a California gaming lounge is quoted:   Our place gets you out of your living room...It turns video gaming from a solo activity into a social occasion. You're in a roomful of 30 or 40 people hooting and hollering. I predict it will become a spectator sport.   Have no doubts, gaming is no longer the domain of the lonely teenaged geek.  In South Korea, where about 60% of the populace has broadband Internet access (the  urlLink highest level in the world ),  urlLink online gaming is already a national past time  and a sport ( urlLink especially MMORG's ).  This is more than just a trend, expect a national chain of video game lounges to arise soon, and to come to your city.  This will be a huge business at some point.

      There has been  urlLink some talk lately  about the iPod Mini's  urlLink having problems with distortion and static .  Apparently because they are so small the headphone plug is pressd up against another device and any pressure on the iPod Mini causes it to sound funny.  Apple of course  urlLink denies the problem  is serious.    My own experience with setting up and using a 15 gig iPod with an IBM clone was overwhelmingly negative.  It took literally months for me to get it to work correctly and had to take it back to the Mac store at one point (and I'm pretty tech savvy I'd like to think).  I still dislike it, it can't even hold a charge long enough to shift a few gigs of songs from my computer to its' hard drive.  The battery's performance has dropped steadily over time as well - even though it was bad to begin with.  In sum, the iPod was a terrible purchase, luckily it is my girlfriends and was given to her as a gift.  I should add that every iPod owner I have ever asked (which is only about 3) told me they has problems getting theirs to work at first as well.  I haven't tried any other hard drive MP3 players out, but I hear the Dell DJ has fantastic battery life and it is much cheaper than the iPod (probably because you aren't paying for all the marketing and hype).    There are people out there who swear by Apple products, but I wouldn't pay the premium they charge for their equipment, be it an iPod or a computer.    Via  urlLink Engadget .   Update : In  urlLink this article in Wired , the author touts the revolutionary effects of shuffling all your music on the iPod.  Two facts: one is that shuffle has been around forever (including on jukebox CD changers), and two that using the shuffle on the iPod brings its battery time down to a max of 2 hours of life as compared to about 4 if you turn off all of its features (backlight, equalizer, shuffle, etc.).

      A few days ago it was news that a California state senator (Senator Figueroa) is drafting legislation that will block Gmail (if passed) because of her concerns over the privacy issue.  That privacy concern is that the keyword scan of mail for targeted ad placement is an invasion of privacy, apparently of great magnitude to Senator Figueroa.    What I think - the Senator and her constituents can vote with their feet, if they don't like Gmail, they don't have to use it.  This isn't just a knee-jerk reaction, Gmail doesn't invade privacy because it uses a computer to scan mail for keyword so as to place targeted ads, it doesn't keep records or use personally identifiable information.  I've written more about this below, if you're interested.  Via  urlLink Wired .

      When I read  urlLink these articles  about how the Nielsen Media Research system must be inaccurate because it has recently registered a huge drop in TV viewership generally, I always snicker.  The TV media companies are claiming the Nielson ratings are suddenly no good.  Okay, I'm no media company exec, but why won't these guys wake up - the reason for the huge drop is that everyone is on the internet or playing video games instead of being spoon fed lame sitcoms and talk shows!  I haven't done the research, but I really believe it is that simple.  With the advent of cheap broadband the internet experience has become truly pleasurable for the masses, and people enjoy being able to utilize interactive media.  The internet is a media technology in which you "pull" down what you want to see as opposed to a "push" broadcast media - like TV or radio, where you have no option what you see or hear (beyond your ability to change the channel).  The main difference: there's always something on with the Internet.  In addition, video games, once considered the domain of geeks, are now insanely popular and getting more so - especially with the ability for online play.  TV just can't compete.

      Did you know that the Beatles record company is named Apple Corps?  The Beatles were around before Apple the computer maker, which was founded in 1976.  Are you beginning to think “hmmm, sounds like there may be trademark issues here?”    In 1981 the Beatles’ Apple Corps sued Apple for trademark infringement, they settled out of court for a substantial sum.  Apple (computers) also agreed to stay out of music related business as part of the settlement.  Because Apple is now cranking out iPods and particularly because of iTunes, the most popular of the online music stores, Apple Corps has had it.  They recently brought a suit claiming Apple has violated their old 1981 agreement with Apple Corps to stay out of music related business.  One problem for the computer maker is that they don't actually make money from iTunes, so paying Apple Corps off may not be a great option, on the other hand, iTunes is promising and Apple would certainly not give it up as an Apple trademarked business.    Like much IP law, this suit will probably come down to an interpretation of that old contract and of the applicable contract law.  This “may turn out to be more a question of contract law and contract interpretation than a commonsense question of what a music product would be."  The article points out that Apple could just rename iTunes for Britain only.  We shall see.    The most interesting goings on in the case so far is that both American and British courts have ruled that their own law should apply and so will both hear the case.  This means that the companies will have to battle it out twice and may get different verdicts in each country – this probably benefits Apple Corps because they get two chances to win.  This doesn't happen often so we’ll be keeping an eye on the case.    Via  urlLink this article  in  urlLink The Boston Globe .

      More about the potential for a Google OS, or an OS “lock-in” as they put it in this  urlLink Search Engine Watch dot com article .  If you’ve been keeping up, you know that you will be offered 1 gig of online storage space for your email on Google’s new Gmail system.  But:   Imagine next year that Google provides anyone with 5 gigabytes, 10 gigabytes or more of storage space for personal files.  Got a ton of Word documents, spreadsheets and other material?  Push it across to us, Google would say.  We'll store it, index it and make it easy to retrieve what you want.  This type of material Google already indexes from across the web and has done for ages.   The author goes on to point out that a “Google Desktop” will only take off if we trust them with our data.  My guess is most average people don't care about this targeted ad/privacy issue, but we’ll see.

      According to  urlLink this NY Times story , now that video games are pulling in such huge money, Hollywood is getting interested.  For years games have been made that are based on movies, often they are clearly a rushed-to-the-market afterthought.  More recently, as with the Lord of the Rings and Matrix games, the video game is a major part of the money-making machine behind the film.    Besides this trend, some directors are planning to start making games that aren’t just movie tie-ins.  For instance, John Woo (action movie premier), is working on a new game for Sega about a heist, in fact, Woo is considering making a movie out of the game.  Ridley Scott, the man behind Alien and Blade Runner is also talking to game execs about making a game.    This is surely a shift in the way video games are viewed by media bigs.  Look for companies like Warner Brothers to get in on the action soon – with their deep pockets.

      Ever heard of a company called Gator?  Well they are a notorious “adware” company, if you call them “spyware”  urlLink Gator may sue you for libel , like they did to  urlLink PC Pitstop  not long ago:  “If we find anyone publicly calling us spyware, we correct it and take action if necessary, said Scott Eagle, Gator's senior vice president of marketing.”    The difference between adware and spyware is pretty grey – Gator claims that their software is not spyware because when you download their program it comes as part of a bundle that you get with Kazaa or other shareware – and in that process you click “ok” to some contract of adhesion that you don't actually read.  So in essence you’ve agreed to have Gator on you computer tracking your surfing and serving you ads.  This “drive-by download” method is the only way to get it on users computers.  Spyware, on the other hand, finds it way onto your computer in more nefarious ways and without your permission.    There are clear privacy issues with such software.  Whether these companies utilize deceptive and unfair business practices is yet to be determined.  In the meantime, it seems that companies like Gator have used libel law to chill public speech critical of what they do.     urlLink Gator has recently changed its name to Claria and has filed for an IPO to raise $150 million to “continue developing its behavioral marketing platform .”  Great.

      Your author and his girlfriend will be heading to the  urlLink New York International Auto Show  later today.  Check out some of the crazy concept vehicles on the website - lots of gadgety goodness.  Maybe one day I'll actually be able to afford a car, though it will not be while I am in NYC, where it costs as much to park each month as you would pay rent for an apartment in most cities.   Update : We had a good time at the auto show, but spent half the time fighting to get a good look at the vehicles.  Volvo stole the show with their YCC, or “your concept car,” as featured in  urlLink this Wired article .  They also had a full sized Volvo made from Lego’s, a lowered station wagon that looked pretty tough, and one coupe with a pop-art paint job that was very cool.

Eggs, and consequently chicks, are a long-standing symbol of fertility and rebirth, an appropriate image for a holiday that celebrates the coming of spring. Originally part of a pagan fertility ritual symbolizing new life, the egg became incorporated into Easter as pagan rites were absorbed into Christianity with the Christianization of Central Europe."

      There really is no reason to take up shelf space with boxes of software.  CompUSA is trying out a method of selling software - from a device that looks like an ATM.  The machine is online and contains downloads of the latest versions of a vast array of software.  You pick out what you need and the machine burns a CD-ROM and prints out the instruction booklet for you.  This allows people to access a greater variety of software, for instance software in other languages that CompUSA would never use shelf space for.  Pretty cool idea.

       urlLink Here is an article  by Julian Dibbell in  urlLink Topic magazine  (which is pretty good, check it out).  Its about the first computer role playing game and the people who were central to its creation.  This may sound really geeky, but it is actually a moving article about a slave who mapped a cave system and then a programmer who, years later in the mid-70's, used those writings to develop a game called Adventure which captured the imaginations of some geeks of old and laid the foundation for the RPG's and MMORPG's of today.    Julian Dibbell is the author of some  urlLink very interesting stories/papers  concerning online gaming.  Among those publications is the famous "A Rape in Cyberspace," published in 1993 (although I think some of the more recent stuff is more fun).    I heard him speak at the recent  urlLink 'State of Play: Law, Games, and Virtual Worlds' conference  at  urlLink New York Law School , he was very engaging.  I should also note that he won the game of "massively multiplayer rock-paper-scissors" that everyone at the conference participated in, so he's quite a lucky fellow as well.

Things that make you go hmmmm: Ducks Unlimited claims to be the "world leader of wetlands conservation," next to these words on their website is a poll asking - "How many buddies do you typically duck hunt with?"

The pattern is now long familiar: the administration withholds the info, pressure builds for them to release it, pundits and papers begin to get very critical, the New Jersey widows start appearing on talk shows saying the WH is stonewalling, finally the WH releases a redacted version of the briefing and attempts to spin it through double-speak (‘those aren’t really warnings even though they look exactly like warnings’).

      An exciting XBox  urlLink rumor via Engadget  – the rumor is that Microsoft is going to sell a separate hardrive/MP3 player/iPod killer as an accessory to the XBox.  This makes some sense, if they are going to include only flash memory in the XBox itself it probably won't be enough for a serious gamer.  The separate hard drive will eat away at Apple’s business.  The Engadget rumor states that they will sell the hard drive at a loss, I wonder if Apple could bring an antitrust suit against MS for this?    This is totally unsubstantiated hearsay.

       urlLink Professor Crawford  teaches a great class at  urlLink the Cardozo School of Law  entitled 'Cyberlaw.'  We are getting into the privacy section of the class next week so the Gmail debate is timely.  She seems to have a similar perspective to my own on the situation although she is less concerned about the saving of deleted email.  Check out  urlLink this post  on her  urlLink blog .    Some highlights:   If we're really worried about privacy, what concerns us is someone developing a full-blown dossier of our every move and publishing it to people whose possession of this information would be hurtful to us in some way.  But, other than this particular worry, whether someone's watching is of no particular interest or consequence.  There is so much information in the world that it is unlikely that we'll be important enough to cause the sifting that would produce such a dossier.  Same thing for online life.  All of us send a great deal of email and wander around for hours at a time.  Sure, someone could be watching.  But should we worry?  Should we be concerned that an ad may be targeted at our computer based on our online activities?  Who is hurt by the personalization of advertising? or even content?  Might it be a "negative" instinct to be concerned about this -- and particularly to be so concerned about it that we stop wandering around online or sending email?  ...  But EPIC and others are asserting that Google's "data retention and correlation policies are problematic in their lack of clarity and broad scope." So don't use Google. It's not being forced on you. Go use a paid-for mail service that makes clearer promises to you.   My problem with the position of EPIC and others is that they analogize the machine 'reading' of email to that of a person reading it and, as Prof. Crawford put it, making a dossier.  This would be a concern if the information was being sifted by an AI and then stored, but we aren't quite there yet.    As I have said below, I am still awaiting an explanation of why Google is going to keep copies of deleted email.  But even if they do not offer one, I will still go for that 1gb account.  I've written a few posts about this already, see below for more.

      I have been told that coding games for the XBox is very difficult and expensive.  Add to that the difficulty of dealing with the massive bureaucracy of Microsoft and you may have the answer to why there aren't as many games out for XBox as there are for Playstation 2 (even discounting Playstation 1 games).  There are also less games made exclusively for the XBox, such as Halo, as there are for the Playstation 2.   urlLink This CNN article  notes that it costs an average of $10 million to make a game for any of the consoles (and it will only go up with 64 bit gaming), which greatly limits entry into the business of game development - a small company can't afford to put out a flop.    As an XBox owner, my main complaint is the limited selection of games.  Microsoft is addressing some of the difficulties with coding games for the XBox in the upcoming XBox 2 with the a new software development platform called XNA.  XNA is a suite of tools that "will let developers skip writing boilerplate code that often bogs down the time it takes to create a game."    The best thing about XNA is that it will be used both for writing games for XBox 2 and for creating PC games, which means that XBox Live users and PC users will be able to play together in virtual worlds - MMOG's are going to get even more massive.    Article  urlLink here .  It also appears that Microsoft is  urlLink scrapping hard drives in favor of flash memory  for the XBox 2.   urlLink Gizmodo is not yet convinced .  Just guessing, but flash memory would make the XBox run much faster in some situations, but may be a much smaller amount of memory as flash is expensive.    In other XBox 2 news -  urlLink the government wants to listen in on you as you frag your mates !  People who are concerned about the Gmail privacy issue should be much more concerned about  urlLink this .  Maybe terrorists will use the XBox 2 to communicate, who knows.  There is a proposal before the FCC that all internet communications programs be built with a backdoor that will allow the FBI to listen in on conversations.  The concern is that soon VOIP (voice over internet) will be taking over the use of normal phones and the FBI will no longer have an effective means of eavesdropping on suspects.  The proposal is broad in what services it will include and the XBox Live service will fall within it.  The FBI would still be required to obtain a warrant in order to listen in (I imagine).  More on this later.

      The Gmail controversy rages on.  In  urlLink this article  Chris Hoofnagle, the associate director for the  urlLink Electronic Privacy Information Center  says, "[w]e don't see this as any different than letting a company listen in on your phone conversations and letting the Postal Service open your mail."  Ok, I know that it is Hoofnagle's job to be a privacy hawk, but this is another analogy that just isn't helpful ( urlLink see prior post on another unhelpful Gmail analogy ).  A computer inserting ads onto the side of an email based on its content is nothing like a human being doing so.  The computer has no judgmental reaction to the content, cannot use the content for any purpose other than inserting ads in the email, and can't  remember  it.  Which leads us to the real problem...maybe it does remember it:  "Some parts of Gmail even could be illegal, said Simon Davies, director of  urlLink Privacy International , a watchdog group in London.  Google's current Gmail policy advises potential users that  residual copies of e-mail may remain on our systems, even after you have deleted them from your mailbox  or after the termination of your account.  Vast data collection like that appears to be a blatant violation of communication protections in United Kingdom and possibly elsewhere in Europe, Davies said."  Google keeping records of all email, even after the user deletes it, is a problem.   urlLink As I said before , they will need to explain what this is all about.  In the meantime...  "Privacy International already has filed a complaint against Gmail with United Kingdom regulators."  That was quick!  "If millions of people have their communication history kept on Google computers, Davies said, then that storehouse becomes a very valuable source of information for a range of unintended consequences."  I am no conspiracy theorist, but this does concern me as well.  As Ari Schwartz, associate director of the  urlLink Center for Democracy and Technology  puts it, Gmail has a "definite creepiness factor."  He has also pointed out ( urlLink as I noted below ) that there is a "lower threshold for allowing law enforcement to obtain e-mails that have been stored for more than 180 days."  Google's policy may expose more of a person's email to any subpoena seeking to obtain their old email.  I think there has been an overreaction to the Gmail privacy issue, however, I am still waiting for Google to explain themselves regarding the archiving of erased email.

      I think I'll ask him.    Check out  urlLink this article  which states that doctors who play video games are less likely to err while performing surgery.  "The study 'landmarks the arrival of Generation X into medicine,' said the study's co-author, Dr. Paul J. Lynch, a Beth Israel anesthesiologist who has studied the effects of video games for years."  Rosser, the other author of the study, which was conducted right here in NYC at Beth Israel, "has developed a course called Top Gun, in which surgical trainees warm up their coordination, agility and accuracy with a video game before entering the operating room."    Rosser "found that doctors who spent at least three hours a week playing video games made about 37 percent fewer mistakes in laparoscopic surgery and performed the task 27 percent faster than their counterparts who did not play video games."  How cool is that - now kids can tell their parents they are studying to be doctors when they are playing games.  I wonder if gaming can help out with lawyering skills...

      CNN is running an article called " urlLink The Tale of two gaming worlds: Online consoles soar while PCs stumble ."  They basically note that the growth of MMORPG's (for which you need a PC to play) appears to be flat while the growth of people playing MMOG's on the XBox and Playstation is soaring.  The console games are pretty much all first person shooters (FPS) as opposed to role playing games in persistent worlds (meaning they exist and evolve even when you arent there playing).  These findings are not surprising, FPS's have greater appeal to the average game player because they do not require a great investment of time and because the console systems are cheap compared to a PC.   "The console business is all about multiplayer," says an analyst who was interviewed for the article.  This is not surprising, gaming is actually a social experience for many people, despite the stereotypes of the video game player.  Anyway, it's a good article that summarizes what major online games are out there.   Here's the  urlLink same story in the WaPo .

      For those who are familiar with MMORPG's (massively multiplayer online role playing games), you know that those online realities are divided into various subpopulations, or "shards."  Each shard is represented by a separate server and name.  Some games, such as EverQuest and now Ultima Online allow cross-server transfer of avatars for a price.  It appears, however, that in the next generation of MMORPG's dividing the population by shard may be unnecessary because of advances in server technology.  Sun has  urlLink announced a new server  specifically intended for online gaming.  Perhaps MMORPG's are going to be even more 'massive' in the future.   urlLink Julian Dibbell  points out in  urlLink this post  at  urlLink Terra Nova , however, that perhaps shards are necessary due to the rise of the cost of content creation per player and not due to technical limitations.  We shall see.   Via  urlLink Terra Nova .  Another recent post on  urlLink Terra Nova , this one by  urlLink Edward Castronova , states that sales of virtual items on eBay has risen by 9% this most recent quarter to reach $5.85 million.  Keep in mind that this is payout for items with no physical properties over a period of only 3 months!  Unbelievable.    urlLink Edward Castronova  is an Associate Professor of Economics at Cal State Fullerton and conducts research on virtual worlds and their economies, very cool stuff.   Via  urlLink Terra Nova .  I should note that I heard both Edward Castronova and Julian Dibbell speak at the recent  urlLink State of Play conference , both of them were very interesting and engaging, more about them later.

      Many of my posts seem to concern Google, so why not stick with the theme.    It is increasingly apparent that Google is making a move on some of Microsoft's territory - with Gmail most recently, which will compete directly with Hotmail.  But it does seem that what Google is moving towards is something much more profound - they are becoming an online OS with "the world's top search engine, a social networking service [Blogspot], a shopping price comparison engine [Froogle], a new email service [Gmail], and a local search/yellow pages engine."   urlLink Kottke.org  calls it GooOS in this great  urlLink post .    All computerized devices will soon be online, and they aren't all going to need a big Windows style OS.  Instead, they could use an interface with Google, GooOS, to run the device, search, and create and store all their files.  Here's how  urlLink Kottke  puts it:  "Google isn't worried about Yahoo! or Microsoft's search efforts...although the media's focus on that is probably to their advantage. Their real target is Windows. Who needs Windows when anyone can have free unlimited access to the world's fastest computer running the smartest operating system? Mobile devices don't need big, bloated OSes...they'll be perfect platforms for accessing the GooOS. Using Gnome and Linux as a starting point, Google should design an OS for desktop computers that's modified to use the GooOS and sell it right alongside Windows ($200) at CompUSA for $10/apiece (available free online of course). Google Office (Goffice?) will be built in, with all your data stored locally, backed up remotely, and available to whomever it needs to be (SubEthaEdit-style collaboration on Word/Excel/PowerPoint-esque documents is only the beginning). Email, shopping, games, music, news, personal publishing, etc.; all the stuff that people use their computers for, it's all there."  Skrenta, at  urlLink Topix.net  calls the Gmail privacy issue a "red herring."  I think it's important for Google to resolve those issues, but few people will actually care that a robot is reading their mail in exchange for 1 mg of storage space.  Skrenta is right about one thing though - the potential of Google is not reached by giving out huge email accounts, it's the "seemingly incremental features [like Gmail] that are actually massively expensive for others to match, and the platform that Google is building which makes it cheaper and easier for them to develop and run web-scale applications than anyone else."  Google has designed and built one of the biggest and cheapest to run computer/server systems in the world.  They even store a  urlLink map of the entire web in RAM  - which is why your search takes only milliseconds to return to you.  As Google adds applications to their system and scales it's servers it is actually putting together the software components and the hardware platform for an online OS.  Apparently they've hired some OS experts as well.  Essentially, Google is putting itself in the position to challenge Microsoft, not only for online email service, but as an online operating system.    Via  urlLink Gothamist .

       urlLink Peeps , the little colored marshmallow chicks and bunnies, are one of the strangest modern pop culture icons.  Why do people  urlLink love them ?  Why do artists use tham as a  urlLink medium ?  Why do people  urlLink cover their cars in Peeps ?  Why is there a " urlLink Lord of the Peeps " pictoral that made me laugh so hard I cried...just thinking about how much effort it must have taken to create...  Here is a recent  urlLink WaPo article  on Peeps and another in the  urlLink Houston Chronicle .  There are 135 Google results for " urlLink peeps art ."  Anyway, the yellow (not pink)  urlLink Peeps Fun Bus  is going to be NY later this week - on  urlLink April 7th through the 11th , the 11th being a "NY Easter Event."  Surely not an event to miss, hopefully one of the  urlLink NYC photobloggers  will be out there shooting it so we can all enjoy it vicariously.  Call this number to find out exactly where the Peeps bus will be while in NYC if you're going to check it out -  urlLink 1-866-270-9638 .

       urlLink More  on the Google Gmail privacy issue on  urlLink CNNmoney .  The article suggests that Google's new email service, Gmail, will violate european privacy laws, which are more strict than those in the US.  The main concern appears to be that "residual copies of email may remain on our systems, even after you have deleted them from your mailbox or after the termination of your account, Google's Gmail says in its  urlLink privacy  and  urlLink terms of use  sections."  That does seem strange, but my impression is that a copy of an email is saved on every router or server that it passes through on its way to the recipient anyway.  If Google is actually saving the mail on their own system after users have deleted them that is cause for concern.  I think they will owe an explantation, why would they save your old email for themselves?  I'll note that this summer at my internship I will, if all goes according to plan, be working on comparitive internet privacy law - comparing US and european law.  I'll know the answer to this problem for sure by the end of this summer!

       urlLink Here is more on the major new IP bill  that has passed the House Judiciary intellectual property subcommittee, the "Piracy Deterrence and Education Act" (PDEA).  If you are sharing more than $1,000 worth of coyrighted media this bill provides for 3 years of jail time and $250,000 fines as the new criminal penalty.    Take note: "Other sections of the PDEA would require Ashcroft to boost the number of antipiracy cops on the Justice Department's payroll, and order the U.S. Sentencing Commission to revisit prison term guidelines to make sure they reflect 'the loss attributable to people broadly distributing copyrighted works over the Internet without authorization.'"

      If you don't know about the SCO suit already, well, I'm not going into deatail about it.  Basically, SCO is a company that has sued IBM claiming that IBM stole pieces of the UNIX OS for use in Linux, SCO claims to own the copyright in UNIX (although even that claim is under attack).  So far the very complex suit is going nowhere - it is in the discovery stage and SCO has been unable to demonstrate any specific code infringement so the case may go down in flames.  SCO, if sucessfull, will be putting the open-source movement on ice.  They are basically attempting to obtain a ruling that would allow them to profit from the work of all the people who made Linux, for free, by "licensing" the software to all the companies that are using it.   urlLink Here  is a cool annotated SCO stock price chart via  urlLink N.Q.B.

      Even the Hell's Angels are getting serious about IP.  The Hell's Angels in Finland weren't amused when they saw some kid at a bar wearing a "Hellus Angel's" shirt featuring the winged, helmet-wearing skull.  In fact, the bikers forced the student to hand the shirt over right there at the bar!  They then complained to the student's school officials, who agreed it was a stolen logo and was used on the shirts due to "thoughtlessness on the part of the kids."  The school has collected the students' shirts and handed them over to the local Hell's Angels chapter (what a windfall, free clothes).  Sounds like the school was just scared to me (not that it would be unusual to be scared of a biker gang).  Article  urlLink here . Via  urlLink N.Q.B (Not Quite a Blog) .

       urlLink This article  in the  urlLink NYT Magazine  is long, but worth the read.  It’s called “Changing All the Rules.”  It’s an account of how the nation’s environmental regulations for power plant emissions have been completely eviscerated by the current administration.   By the sounds of it, the American people’s health is being put at risk in order to save the energy industry a few percent of their yearly profits (and for Republican campaign contributions).  No one is under the impression that Bush is environmentally friendly, but I don’t think the extent of these unpopular changes is generally known.  Far-reaching changes that even Republicans in Congress had balked at considering (aka the "Clear Skies" program) have been implemented by the Bush administration.   The gist of the article is that many power plants all over the nation had been flouting regulatory laws since the 1970’s, spewing many more hundreds of millions of tons of pollutants into the air than they were allowed to.  The perpetually under funded EPA is charged with enforcing those laws, and had finally caught the industry in the act a few years back, giving them the leverage to achieve the goals that our environmental legislation was meant to achieve – to force the plants to upgrade to new equipment that could remove 95% percent (!) of the pollutants from their exhaust.  The Bush administration stepped in and made sure it didn’t happen by changing the laws by a version of executive decree.  In fact Elliot Spitzer (the popular NY Attorney General, and possibly future governor or senator of NY) and a sizable group of state AG’s are challenging the changes, claiming that they are so far-reaching that only the Congress should be able to pass them.  (In case you’re rusty on government: usually Congress makes the laws, and the Executive enforces them, but of course in reality there is a lot of overlap, especially with regulatory bodies like the EPA which are often under the control of administration appointees).    I’m not a big time environmentalist, but the amounts of pollutants these companies spew out really sounds detrimental to both Americans and the planet.  What really gets me is how the power plants are unwilling to spend even a small bit of their profits to clean up – even though it sounds like a lot of money to make them more environmentally friendly, these plants are pulling in a billion a year.  I smell a massive cigarette company style lawsuit at some point in the future: eventually public opinion and political forces will align against these guys and they'll be made to regret what are essentially crimes against us all.

      Here’s an  urlLink article  in the  urlLink NYT  about gaming laptops, via  urlLink Gizmodo .  Mine used to be a gaming laptop in 2002, now it’s a gigantic PDA without a touch screen.    Note the degrading first paragraph of the story (as if the writer isn't one of the majority of Americans who play video games).  If it had been you would you be described as “just like the other pale young gamers,” and is a “black T-shirt and blue jeans” really the “all-but-required uniform" for game playing?  I also take issue with the writer’s contention that laptops were not, until recently, able to play the most up to date games.  I will testify to the fact that even two years ago Dell sold a laptop with a serious graphic card in it – I know ‘cause I’m working on it right now.  This puppy still crunches numbers harder than any cheap laptops out today – but it cost a pretty penny at the time I aquired it (thanks dad).    Laptops are perfectly fine for gaming, have no doubt (unless you're competing or something).  They may not be the best of the best, or as upgradeable as huge towers, but they work well.  The real problem is – don't even fool yourself into thinking you're getting a truly portable machine.  My beast weighs in at around 10 pounds, and I’m sure all the new gaming laptops are the same.  Forget about lugging it to class to take notes on.  One surprising stat from the article - only 9% of computers sold last year were laptops, I'd have guessed much higher.  Check out these demographic stats from the  urlLink ESA :  "Player Demographics: Sixty-two percent of computer game players are male, while 34 percent are under 18 years old, 26 percent are 18 to 35, and 40 percent are over 36. Seventy-two percent of console game players are male, while 45 percent are under 18, 36 percent are 18 to 35, and 19 percent are over 36."  From  urlLink this article,  , (thank the ESA, the gaming industry lobby/legal team, for protecting your rights to play, btw).  Some other surveys  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  Also, from  urlLink CNN : "last year, the video game industry took in more money than movies, $10.3 billion to $9.5 billion."  Here's a story from " urlLink Beliefnet " concerning how videogame playing twists children's souls, those damn satanic games are ruining our moral values.  According to them 79% of children play games on a regular basis...sounds high but ok.  On the other hand, according to  urlLink Gamespy , "an overwhelming number of parents - 96 percent - say they are paying attention to the content of the computer and video games their children play, and two-thirds of parents say that games are a positive addition to their children's lives."  Cool.  They also state that 39% of Americans own a gaming console.

      The Bush administration is very much excited about the creation of 308,000 new jobs during the last month, that's no surprise considering they are losing ground to critics on both foreign relations and domestic economic issues.  Even with this recent job gain over 2 million jobs have been lost since Bush took office.  Let's hope job growth becomes a trend that endures for a-year-and-a-half, because that's when I'll be graduating from law school!  How strange would this election become if Bush could claim he's done good things for the economy - and convince anyone.  I am very skeptical that the economy will become one of his election strong points.

      So everyone is freaking out about the "invasion of privacy" that will occur on  urlLink Gmail , Google's new email service.  There are major news stories everywhere as well as lots of conversation across the blogosphere.  A "story" has even been posted on the Drudge Report (I'm not quite confortable calling one of Drudge's reports a story, still the topic will get loads of attention for being there).  Here's a  urlLink WaPo article ;  urlLink WIRED article ;  urlLink WaPo article #2 .  While I appreciate the concern over online privacy in gerneral (it is a problem), an interviewee in the first WaPo article listed above uses an unhelpful analogy - "Chris Hoofnagle of the Electronic Privacy Information Center ... likened the Gmail ads to a computerized voice interrupting a phone conversation about a vacation with a pitch for a travel agency.'"  This doesn't contribute to my understanding of the situation at all.  Why?  Because there's such a big difference in the sensory methods by which email and voice mail is accessed.  When you are reading an email you can just ignore all the ads on the side of the page, just like you do now when you go to any webpage.  You may not have noticed, but Google actually serves ads in a  urlLink box on the right side  of many major web sites - for the record they aren't the annoying blinking type.   urlLink Google states  that "it would use automated technology to scan the content of incoming e-mail for keywords and place related text ads inside the mail. For example, if someone sent an e-mail to a Gmail user suggesting they go out for Mexican food, the recipient might see a couple of text ads in the right column of the e-mail suggesting specific Mexican restaurants in their area."  The ads will not be within the text, obviously.  It is difficult to understand how this could be considered "editorializing" the email.    The most reasonable voice being quoted is that of Ari Schwartz of the DC based Center for Democracy & Technology.  He notes in the WIRED article that there is a "lower threshold for allowing law enforcement to obtain e-mails that have been stored for more than 180 days."  So law enforcement has to work harder to get fresh email, but as Schwartz points out - this situation is the same for every ISP.  So if you use Yahoo or Hotmail and have mail saved from back in the day, the gov't can get at it more easily than more recent email.  This is a privacy issue that may impact more if people begin saving all their email on Gmail due to the ton of space alloted to each user.    Why would users get worked up about machines looking for keywords in email?  It must just be a general techno paranoia - if the gov't wants to get your email, they'll get it, and they don't need Google's help.  To conclude, I will getting me some o' that Gmail when it comes out, much like Mary Linneborg, who is interviewed in  urlLink this article .  Unlike Mary though, I will not "be curious to see what they would try to sell me."

      File sharers: You thought you had to worry about possibly being the subject of a music inductry lawsuit and having to shell out a few grand right?  Well guess what, soon it will be prison time as well.    The House judiciary subcommittee has unanimously approved a bill that would punish file swappers with up to three years in jail for first time infringement offenses, and up to six for repeat offenses. This new bill is sponsored by Reps. Howard Berman (D-California) and Lamar Smith (R-Texas), and targets "heavy users of peer-to-peer networks and those who pirate copies of feature films."  The bill is known as " urlLink HR 4077, The Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2004 ."  RIAA spokespeople call it a " urlLink common-sense bill ," but then Jack Valenti has also famously said   urlLink "[i]f you buy a DVD you have a copy. If you want a backup copy you buy another one ."  Who needs fair use when you have the DMCA, right Jack?  So it appears that "common-sense" to the RIAA is different than for most media consumers (aka average americans).  The bill still needs to pass the House and Senate, but it likely has a good chance.  urlLink Wired  notes in  urlLink this article  that critics suggest that what this bill amount to is the fed spending tax money to protect copyright owners (aka media companies).  The bill will provide the DOJ and FBI with lots more cash to go after evil file sharers.  Note also that John Ashcroft and his pals at the Dept. of Justice are in a real tizzy over infringment on P2P networks and have assigned a new task force to figure out how to deal with it.  From what I understand, you don't want to get on Ashcroft's bad side.  Well, if you are going to have laws you should enforce them, but jail time for music downloaders seems a bit overzealous.  If the music industry thought their goodwill was going down the drain before...

      Google is going to start offering email services in a similar fashion to those offered by Hotmail and Yahoo.  No word on when these accounts will be available, but you can bet there will be a rush to get them - Google will provide a full 1GB of space for email storage, Hotmail provides a measley 2mb and Yahoo 4mb.  Google will also provide a search function that will allow users to search their email archive, not bad.  Microsoft and Yahoo have both been threatening to challenge Google with new search engine technology, it looks like Google is making a "preemptive strike" against them though.

      This situation is somewhat similar to the Google keyword sale suits.  Here, LL Bean is upset because Claria (formerly Gator), one of the nations "leading" adware/spyware companies, is sending people pop-ups for competing companies when people visit their site.     By creating ads that appear when Internet users visit L.L. Bean's Web site, retailers Nordstrom, J.C. Penney, Atkins and Gevalia have traded on the company's name and infringed on its trademark rights, said Mary Lou Kelley, vice president for E-commerce at L.L. Bean.  "These advertisers are illegally poaching on L.L. Bean's trademark," Kelley said. "Using our trademarked name as a trigger to which you want to serve your ads causes customer confusion and crosses the line into trademark infringement."   There have been such suits in the past.  These suits have been largely unsucessful because judges are under the mistaken impression that the users have choosen to have the ad serving software on their computers (or they at least agreed to a click-wrap license when they got hit by the drive-by download of the adware).  In UHaul v. WhenU, the court held that the serving of pop-ups was not trademark infringement, and neither was it infringement that the adware company used the trademarks in their database.  On the other hand, there is the 1-800-CONTACTS case, in which the court held that the pop-ups for competitors led to users having initial interest confusion as to the source of the ads and therefore they are infringement.    How you hope this turns out may depend in part on your view of the Internets development.  Personally, I believe that the answer to these sort of problems (spyware, adware, spam, etc) lays largly with consumer education.  Those in the know really get no spam or pop-ups.  Spyware may be a different matter however, if it is of the sort that just loads itself onto the users computer without any warning.  This I believe is an unfair and deceptive trade practice (actually, the drive-by downloads may be as well).  I am not sure that user education and technological fixes cannot solve these problems, but perhaps a little judicial intervention could halp as well.  Article at  urlLink CNN .

      First, if you're not already familiar with this situation (and want to be), go read some articles about the Google ad keyword suits, such as these: Here's a  urlLink article  that summarizes the whole thing, from  urlLink Search Engine Watch .   urlLink Here's  more on the American Blind case and the situation in general.  With the American Blind case, Google hopes to gain a ruling in their favor concerning the selling of keywords that are merely descripive - such as "american" and "blind" or "decorate."  American Blind had threatened to sue Google over its keyword sales, but instead of waiting for them to file suit, Google filed for a declaratory judgment.  That means that there is a controversy that could go to court, but one side is trying to preempt the suit and get precedent in their favor in order to try and ward off other similar suits, such as the just-filed Geico suit.  The American Blind case concerns generic words, or descriptive words that have developed a secondary meaning to people in its representation of the owner.  The real question is can Google sell keywords that are straight up fanciful.  These are marks that were not words in the english language until being made up as a trademark, like "Geico" or "eBay."  I don't know if they should be selling these trademarks to trigger ads for others, but my impression is that it is ok as long as the ads that show up do not make false claims that they are that company, as appears to be the case with Geico.  Google should have been more careful than to allow such conduct by advertisers.  On the otherhand they have a good defense in the case - those ads were for underwriter brokers who dealt with Geico (but still should probably not be titling their ads "Geico").    urlLink  Elizabeth Radar  has  urlLink more  on the Geico keyword suit.  She point out that Geico is taking a big risk by suing Google in VA and hoping that can speed the case through the court before some bad precedent comes out from the American Blind case in CA.

       urlLink Geico had filed suit against Google , alleging that they are causing consumer confusion by allowing advertisers to use their name on ads.  Before today, when you searched Google for "Geico," you'd have noticed that on the right side of the search page where text ads, several of which were titled "Geico."  They have since been removed.    These ads were for brokers for 3rd party insurance underwriters, including Geico.  It would be a nominative fair use of the trademark if the companies were using the mark to identify their product, but not if selling Geico insurance is only one among the many things they do, and not prominent among them.  It is apparent here that they are merely trying to appropriate the goodwill Geico has built up (read name recognition).    Google has been fighting off such lawsuits for sometime.  It is apparent that if certain precedent comes out of one of these cases Google's business model may be at risk.  Bring it on Warren Buffett.  Via  urlLink The Trademark Blog .

       urlLink This article in the New York Times  gives some insight in how the battle between MS and Google is developing.  I've posted on this a  urlLink few   urlLink times  before.  Google is trying to get on your desktop to provide searching for not only websites, but also your internal file, they are also doing email now which competes with Hotmail.  Microsoft is trying to defend by deveolping a comparable search engine that they plan to integrate into the next version of Window, called Longhorn, which will not be released until well into 2006.  If MS is sucessful and consumers like the search more than Google, then Google could go the way of Netscape.  Read the article to get a better idea of what is to come for PC desktops.  Times they are a changin'.  Google is lucky in that they have about one and half years to make their move before Longhorn comes out.  But MS may launch a new search engine by the end of the year.

       urlLink "Rivals challenge iPod's dominance.  Apple's iPod may be the flavour of the month, but there are better and cheaper choices, says a computing magazine."   Thank you, it's about time someone mentioned the other HD MP3 players out there.  The iPod is a piece of crap, I have one and I hate it (when it works).  The only reason for its success is that it was first and has a big marketing campaign.    I've been eyeing the Dell DJ as my next choice.  It's cheaper, has more memory, and a battery that last twice as long as the iPod's.  Too boot, it probably won't have buggy software (at least for PC) or crash constantly.  I have spoken with plenty of iPod owners - they all say they have problems with their iPod and that it took them forever to get it working, yet they all claim to love it.  I think they are just loathe to admit they got ripped off by a trend (ours was a gift, so no sweat really on the money although I have dumped at least 20 hours into trying to make it work/fix it over the last 8 months since we got it - it's about to go on eBay).  Don't waste your money on an iPod, look around.  Dam, I could rant iPod hatred all day.  Via  urlLink the Beeb .

      I can't believe this, people are paying upwards of $150 for free gmail invites on  urlLink eBay .  Maybe I should have kept mine!  People who are beta testing gmail were each given two invites to pass along, but some are turning up on eBay.  After seeing some of my posts about gmail (check the archive if you're curious) on this blog, a woman apparently decided that I was a bit of an expert on gmail and wrote me an email asking if the selling of accounts on eBay was legal/allowed.  I thought it was an interesting question so I looked into it (very briefly as I have a final exam today).  As it turns out, there is nothing in the Google gmail  urlLink Terms of Use  that forbid selling accounts, although they do reserve the right to cancel your account for any reason.  I told here that if she wanted to drop a wad of cold cash on an account she's in the clear, and that Google is probably loving the attention anyway so wouldn't try to stop it.  Plus, it's been going on for several weeks and they have yet to send a C&D letter to eBay to have them remove the auctions.  Strange times.  Please, just wait a bit because these accounts will be free to the public within 3-6 months.  Here are some  urlLink articles  about this.

       urlLink "Showroom Guilty in Counterfeiting Case"  in the NYT concerns a furniture company that was ripping off a famous furniture making by couterfeiting her stuff and either selling it as the real thing and making a ton, or selling them cheap to you if you really wanted it but couldn't afford it at the "real" price.  The plaintiff spent $900,000 in attorney fees to fight this battle.  Damages have yet to be awarded, but it seems like such a case of bad faith on the defendant's part that hopefully the plaintiff will be awarded attorney fees as well as actual damages.     Judge Cohn found the firm and its two principals, Steve Turner and Janet Greenberg, liable for "common trademark infringement, unfair competition, false designation of origin and palming off."   Check out how determined this plaintiff was -   Ms. Corzine and her manager could not find an order from Ms. Plasky. Ms. Corzine, whose factory is in Mexico, said she received a tip that the Turner Greenberg showroom was diverting Corzine purchase orders to a factory in the San Fernando Valley. Ms. Corzine drove to that factory, and found it protected by a pair of guard dogs.  The next part had Ms. Corzine playing Nancy Drew. She befriended the dogs, "then I climbed onto the roof of my Range Rover, jumped over the fence and went in," she said. Inside, a couple began screaming at her in a language she did not understand. But before she left, she saw a Nancy Corzine catalog open on a counter. "That's when I decided to sue," she said.   That's better than most private eyes could do.  Go git 'em tiger!

      Big news?  I have no time to really dig into this at all (studying for finals).  But I will at some point.  Anyway, maybe one of these days it will be legal for people to utilize fair use rights - such as archiving a DVD.  The general feeling seems to be that the DMCA goes a bit overboard.  We'll see if this amendment to it goes anywhere.      Sponsors described the proposal as a consumers' rights bill for digital media that would allow consumers to bypass encryption locks built into DVD movies by Hollywood to prevent copying. Such encryption schemes are increasingly common in music and movies.   Supporters of the change complained the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act prohibits consumers from using specialized software to bypass such electronic locks, even when making copies of discs only for their own personal use.   Similar legislation was introduced during the last Congress but went nowhere.    There has to be some sort of balance between consumer rights and those of the copyright industry - how lopsided that balance is is what this fight is all about.  There are plenty of people out there who consider the passage of the DMCA (as well as the Copyright Term Extension Act, a.k.a. The Mickey Mouse/Bono law)to have been a gigantic wealth transfer to the copyright industry at the expense of consumer's rights and the works available to people via the public domain.  On the other hand there are some copyright owners out there that are losing serious money due to P2P and pirating.  And guess which side has the most expensive lobbyists in Washington?    I don't personally know how this balance should be achieved, but I sure as hell know I'll be backing up and archiving any media I purchased if I feel the need - we should all be legally able to do so.  I don't think that there is any legitimate reason to evicerate or seriously weaken the fair use laws on the books now by allowing what are essentially work-arounds or loopholes for copyright owners to exploit.  Obviously the feeling is that it isn't really the guy at home making an archive that is the real problem for copyright owners but that's how it effects me...

      The article is in The WaPo and is titled,  urlLink Gmail Leads Way in Making Ads Relevant   I have been testing Gmail for weeks now myself, and I love it.

I've written on the issues of privacy that have come up because of it  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .

      California is serious about stopping people who go into theaters and video tape new movies for the purposes of pirating them.  They have recently enacted a statute which makes it a criminal act.   urlLink Article here :    In the first sentencing under California's new anti-camcording law, a 34-year-old Los Angeles-area man has been sent to jail for 42 days, the Motion Picture Assn. of America said Friday.    The guy was caught video taping "The Alamo." He got nailed when a projectionist with night-vision goggles saw the light from his camcorder.  They've got James Bond style equipment to find these guys.    The  urlLink artist recently featured in the New York Times  who videotapes movies in much the same manner, and then shows them in art galleries has made the wise decision to change up his schtick.      A 34-year-old video artist living in Baltimore, Mr. Routson has a very particular method of art-making, which will soon be illegal in Maryland, as it already is in the District of Columbia and five other states, including New York and California. Like the appropriation artists of the early 1980's, who rephotographed existing photographs as a way of commenting on society, Mr. Routson makes movies of other people's movies.   Since 1999 he has been going to Baltimore-area movie theaters, often on a feature film's opening day, and recording what happens on and around the screen with a small, hand-held camcorder. He shows the grainy, oddly distorted results, which he calls recordings, as DVD installations in art galleries.    This case appears to be blatant copyright infringement, but actually raises really difficult questions of fair use (an exam question?).  The artist doesn't film the work in order that it be sold on DVDs in Chinatown, he even shakes the camera and records the sounds the audience is making (crunching popcorn, slurping sodas, etc) - so arguably this work is transformative.  Also, he doesn't sell the works, he only shows them in a gallery, therefore there is really no effect on the market for the original work (as we all know, in an art gallery you stand there in front of the work for about 10 seconds before thinking, "ok, I get it,' and walk away, no one would actually sit there and watch the whole thing).  I think if this artist was sued there is a fair chance that - if the artist could afford to litigate, and if he got a very good attorney, and if he got a sympathetic judge, and the stars alinged in a certain way - he might get away with this.  Who knows?  The fact is that right now the industry is pounding away on IP crimes so hard that people's attitudes are changing about piracy and courts and the legislatures are getting very tough.  This artist would probably go down in flames in the real world.      Mr. Routson, who described himself in a telephone interview as increasingly nervous on his visits to theaters, said he had heard rumors that the management of one chain was offering $100 to any employee who apprehended someone with a camcorder.    Uh-oh.  The article goes on to make a very serious point.  Our surroundings are completely saturated with trademarks and copyrights - pop culture.  It would be nearly impossible to run a video recorder anywhere in this country for more than 30 seconds without recording some intellectual property.  We need artists to tear these images apart for us every now and then to remind us that there is more to life, and to expose the hidden nature of some of pop culture's forms.    Our surroundings are so thoroughly saturated with images and logos, both still and moving, that forbidding artists to use them in their work is like barring 19th-century landscape painters from depicting trees on their canvases. Pop culture is our landscape. It is at times wonderful. Most of us would not want to live without it. But it is also insidious and aggressive. The stuff is all around us, and society benefits from multiple means of staving it off. We are entitled to have artists, as well as political cartoonists, composers and writers, portray, parody and dissect it.      It's a valid point - the more harsh copyright law becomes, the less oppurtunity artists have to comment on it, and the less everyone else is exposed to competing memes and ideas.

      Seems that the copyleft's ideas are getting more and more mainstream media attention,  urlLink see here :    How punitive laws on copyright and e-snooping might just make activists of us all.  ...  Such strict laws help control the people that can do least about them - consumers. Music firms are not putting digital locks on CDs and downloaded files to deter pirates.     File-sharing has been blamed for the slump in music sales  "Technical sophisticates and dishonest users are not stopped by this. Ukrainian pirate gangs are not slowed down by digital rights management," he says.   Instead these locks milk cash from ordinary consumers, such as the mother unable to make a video copy of an expensive DVD in case the children break it.   "The people slowed down by [digital locks] are those that can least afford it. These people are just going to get screwed and that's a shame."    In the  urlLink meantime  -     The number of internet users who illegally download films and TV series has tripled over the past year, a survey has suggested.

      ay yi yi...    Hey everyone, sorry no posts since saturday.  The problem is that I am now deeply embroiled in law school finals.  I'll try to post once a day, but no promises.    As a side note, Blogger, the blogging service I am now using, has just been massively updated .  I will now be able to include a comments section (right next to the perma link down there below the post) so that my readers can weigh in on these most interesting of topics.  Also, there are new templates available, so the look and feel of this spot will probably change (feel free to let me know if you like/dislike).  If the changes are satisfactory to me, I may even be able to keep this blog here for a bit longer than I thought.  My gripe with Blogger has been that it is not very flexible unless you know how to script, which I don't.  Hopefully, It'll be a whole new Blogger experience from here on out.    If you didn't know it, Blogger is actually run by Google.  How about a shout out to the Googsters for trying to get that cutomer satisfaction going on.  Also, for the last month or so I have been using Gmail, the new Google email service - which is actually still in Beta so accounts are not available to everyone yet.  I must say that it is a marked improvement over Yahoo! and Hotmail's email services (both of which I have accounts on) - in function (it's very quick, and easy to figure out), storage capacity (by SO much), and look and feel (it feels more like using a personal message board than an email service). I think It'll be huge when they release it.  Good job Google. Soon we'll all be using Google OS, wait and see.  There's a war brewing, between Microsoft and Google.

       Court rulings have pulled the most popular software for copying DVD movies off the market [321 Studios program, called DVDXCopy], but a program, already on sale at CompUSA and Wal-Mart, is trying to get around these rulings and still let users duplicate copy-protected discs.   The software, called 123 Copy DVD, sells for as little as $19.99. Out of the box, it won't copy the vast majority of commercial DVDs, which are protected by encryption.   However, the manufacturer, also called 123 Copy DVD, has a website with a link to another site that contains a piece of decryption software. Users can easily download that patch, which allows the program to copy any disc.    Jeez, this looks like a major screw up.  First, if I were 321 Studios I would seriously be considering a trademark claim for consumer confusion against 123 Copy.  It seems all too apparent that 123 Copy is trying to appropriate 321 Studios' goodwill.  Second, 123 Copy is going to get nailed with a preliminary injunction, even though it is quite possible that the carriers of the program will pull it from shelves after receiving a cease and desist letter from the movie industry reps.  This method of trying to skirt copyright law (or para-copyright law in the case of the DMCA) by providing the DeCSS-esque decryption key for download on the company website is a non-starter.  Even a law student (cough, cough) knows that the courts will not participate in their little fantasy land fiction - these guys are blatently violating the DMCA by providing a program, the sole purpose of which is to circumvent data protection methods.  People just don't get it; these guys do not play games --- for purposefully violating (bad faith) the DMCA for business gain, 123 Copy is probably now liable to amounts of money that would shock (plus attorney fees).  The penalties for violating the DMCA are ridiculously high (both civil and criminal).  Just wait, I gaurantee I'll be posting an "I told you so" post in less than two days.  If these guys got advice from counsel (which I doubt they did), s/he should be sued for malpractice.  Via  urlLink Wired  &  urlLink CNN  &  urlLink PC World .

He called it the Memespread Project. "  ...  "Rather than doing it retroactively," Arbesman says, "I thought I'd try to inject a meme into the blogspace and see what happens and try to track it. In this case, the meme was the project itself."   Via  urlLink Wired .

      The music industry doesn't know when to chill out.  The suing of music downloaders has been at least somewhat effective at chaning attitudes about P2P theft of copyrighted material.  But the main music consumer complaints remain - that the state of pop music is the dumps, and more importantly that CDs are a rip off.    Lots of consumers have begun to pay for music downloads from online services like iTunes, which at 99 cents a song isn't so bad.  But recently, as I've noted before here, they've begun to demand more money for new music, which destroys the incentive to download the music because you the CD costs the the same and in some cases more.  No one wants to pay the going rates for CDs, it's too much - so by raising the download prices they are going to drive just as many people back to KaZaA as they drive to purchase the CDs.   urlLink Check this out :   At the Future of Music Coalition Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Glaser recounted his general frustration in getting the record labels to offer creative pricing beyond the 99-cents-per-download model. In fact, some labels -- emboldened by consumers' apparent willingness to pay a buck a song -- are talking about raising per-song fees rather than lowering them to increase volume.   "Can you explain what planet the record labels are on?" asked Walt Mossberg, tech columnist for The Wall Street Journal and moderator of a one-on-one interview with Glaser at the conference.   Glaser smirked. "I guess I'd call it Planet Spreadsheet," he said. "The problem is that they don't look at it holistically."    Not only are they going to dirve people back to P2P services, they are going to be driving them straight to newer services like  urlLink allofmp3.com , a new russian company offering music for $10 per gig (wow!).  By the way, Gizmodo has tried it out and liked it -  urlLink read about the experience here .  No only all this, but as most of us are now realizing - CDs don't even last.  When I saw  urlLink these   urlLink articles   urlLink about "CD rot"  I only wondered why they'd never appeared before.  I've been losing CDs to rot for years - that's why I recently ripped them all to a seperate external harddrive, to archive the music on them (which is fair use as a mere shift in media and because I didn't need to circumvent any data protection device or encryption to do it, which would violate the DMCA).    The rampant pirating of copyrighted material has to stop, but the music industry needs to play ball, not just sue everyone and jack up prices.  The music industry needs to work with their customers instead of alienating them.  I really believe that most people want to and are willing to pay for their music - but not at $20 a CD.  No matter what  urlLink Congress does about the problems of P2P , they can't enforce their statutes in Russia.  Via  urlLink Wired .   Update : A new article in the NY Post claims that soon songs on iTunes are going to be priced up to $1.25, with some full albums going for $16.99 (the same prices you can get the CD for, or more even).     EMI and Sony Music, which this week launched its own download service called Sony Connect, were said to be the most aggressive on pricing.

      I have noticed that the archives on the right of the page do not seem to be working.  Great, no doubt Blogger has lost the last months worth of posts.  That would really annoy me.

I am still working on a name for it (althought I do have one in mind that is available in the dot COM TLD).  If you think of any good ideas let me know.  I'm looking for something that "conjures up" the ideas of cyberlaw or intellectual property that I can get in the dot COM and/or dot NET TLD's (because they are just SO much more prestigious than little 'ol dot US, BIZ, or INFO).

      Seems pretty straight forward.  Of course the principle couldn't take a student's phone, listen to his voice mail, read his text messages, and then send texts and call people in his address book...right?  And certainly not if the search was justified on the grounds that the student was caught in the act of recieving a text message reading, "I need a tampon."  Well yes, this actually happened.  Check it out:   School officials say it is common knowledge that tampon is slang for a large marijuana cigarette.   Wow...I didn't know that.  Somehow, it just doesn't sound genuine.  Perhaps a little post hoc rationalization?  I can't imagine someone saying, as Engadget puts it: "I’m gonna go smoke up a phat tampon right now."    Seriously, students in a public school get less Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure than a person on the street.  Still, this seems like a step well over the line into a violation of privacy.  This was no real indication that the student was involved in drugs and the phone was his property (unlike a locker, for which the standard for searching would probably be much lower).  The principal even text messeged the student's 10 year old brother pretending to be the student!  Calls also went out to other students at the school from the confiscated cell phone, students who answered were told to bring their phones to the principal too.  This sounds like a good time to sue, sue, sue!!!  Via  urlLink Engadget , article  urlLink here .  While on the subject of privacy.   urlLink Here is an article in Wired  re giving up your info (or really just allowing its aggregation into a dossier) for the greater protection of the US.  It also mentions an ID card containing biometric info.  The article mainly profiles Derek Smith, head of ChoicePoint:   Smith can supply...information -- he heads ChoicePoint, a leading electronic data warehouse regularly mined by companies and the government. ChoicePoint does 8 million background checks a year, serving more than half of the Fortune 500. Database aggregators like ChoicePoint have quietly become powerful arbiters, whirring in the background when people seek jobs, get on airplanes, apply for insurance, commit a crime or fall victim to one. ChoicePoint's computers are packed with 19 billion public records.    As you can imagine he is in favor of "making the world safer" by "examining each other's digital footprints."  Scary?  I don't even know anymore.

      Some spyware and viruses contain scripts that allow a third party to take over a users computer and use it without the owner knowing.  The most common use made of people's computers at this point are as a conduit for spamming.  By hijacking a computer a spammer can use that computer's IP address to send the spam and mask that is coming from the spammer (this is now illegal under the CAN-SPAM Act).  Another fairly common use is to make the hijacked computer send out loads of data requests from a particular website, if enough computers are sending the requests the server that the webpage is located on gets clogged up and the target site is brought down.     Viruses such as My-Doom and Bagle surrender the control of infected machines to hackers. This expanding network of infected, zombie machines can be used either for spam distribution or as platforms for DDoS attacks, such as those that many online bookies have suffered in recent months. By using compromised machines - instead of open mail relays or unscrupulous hosts - spammers can bypass IP address blacklists.   Now things are getting even worse for users, apparently spammer and hackers are now selling access to these "BotNets."  Even organized crime is starting to get in on the action.  What they are actually using the BotNets for other than spamming and denial of service attacks is less certain, but with keyloggers and other tools they would certainly have the ability to find out passwords, credit card numbers, etc. from hundreds of thousands or millions of people who have this malware on thier machines.  They are even selling access to machines with highspeed access for a premium to speed up their spamming!   Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at email security firm MessageLabs, said much of the spam it blocks comes from IP ranges allocated to high-speed cable modem or ADSL accounts, such as roadrunner and MSN in the US. MessageLabs reckons two thirds of the spam it blocks originates from computers infected by viruses such as Sobig-F or Bagle. Spam volumes are growing. More than two thirds of the email passing through MessageLabs systems so far this month was spam compared to 53 per cent for March as a whole.    urlLink The recent MyDoom virus used infected computers to launch a DDoS attack on SCO , the company that is suing IBM over the Linux OS.  Obviously those virus writers were big Linux fans.    Sasser, the latest big-time virus which debuted over the weekend is spreading fast.  Some think it could reach MSBlast proportions, MSBlast infected 10 million computers.     The worms infect vulnerable systems by establishing a remote connection to the targeted computer, installing a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and then downloading themselves to the new host.   ...  Early Monday, Symantec had counted at least 10,000 confirmed infections, and acknowledged that hundreds of thousands of computers have likely been infected.    Luckily,  urlLink News.com.com  says:  Although Sasser.B does not feature a back door to allow spammers and others to enter a user's system, Symantec's Huger said he would not be surprised if that feature is added to later versions of Sasser.   So Sasser doesn't add you to BotNet, yet...    Via  urlLink The Register .  More on News.com.com about Sasser  urlLink here .  More from the Reuters  urlLink here .

       urlLink Ask Gothamist  on the ethics of  urlLink buying bootlegged DVD's .  I agree with this analysis for the most part, however, I must suggest that the connection between the criminals that bootleg en mass and terrorism against the US is tenuous and not supported by any study or government report I have seen.  I have read several articles in the media that make such a claim, but often without any support.  Obviously it is in the interest of the copyright industry to hype-up such a connection, and so while I do not know whether the claim is true or not, I view it with scepticism.  I'm no conspiracy theorist, but if I were Jack Valenti or the RIAA I would be directly connecting bin Laden to bootlegging gangs because it will encourage the US government to direct their attention to the problem of bootlegging, which certainly costs the copyright industries billions in losses every year.  Whether funneling money to terrorists or not, bootlegging infringes on copyright and is a serious crime.  I don't get to link to  urlLink Gothamist  often because it generally doesn't have posts relevant to the subject matter of this blog, but I do so with pleasure on this rare occasion.   urlLink Gothamist  is an award winning blog about what's happening in the center of the universe, my home and Gothamist's - New York City.

      When the Super Bowl comes around there are plenty of companies that run ads that aren't quite tradmark infringement, but only because they use coded speech similar to the trademark to let you know they are associating themselves with it - such as the "Bud Bowl" ads.  There can be great benefit to associating one's brand with a big event, which is why companies sponsor sports events for millions of dollars.  It gets the product eyeballs and also associates the product with the culture of the event and it's viewers.  urlLink This article  states:    It's why you're seeing so-called ambush marketing. Miller Lite Beer uses "Super Parties" on its billboards to get around the rules.     And  urlLink here  is a discussion of Super Bowl parties:    There is a significant distinction to the various special events and parties. There are the NFL-sanctioned events, which have the blessing of the football league. And there are the so-called ambush parties, which trade on Super Bowl excitement but are not part of the "official" landscape.     Of course anyone who wishes to use the actual logo needs to get permission from the NFL and pay a fee.  Hence the emergence of advertising which refers to "the game on Sunday" without using the term Super Bowl.  Likewise, we are seeing the same sort of ambush marketing with the upcoming Friends finale.  The New York Times discusses it  urlLink here :     [C]ompanies not officially part of the "Friends" send-off are trying to be associated with it, not unlike advertisers that do not pay to be Super Bowl sponsors ambushing those that do by running football-centric ads referring to "the big game." For example, the pasta maker Barilla has put up a Web site (www.finalepartytips.com) offering recipe ideas for viewing parties "to say goodbye to a few old 'friends.' "    It's an interesting article that mentions various tactics advertisers use to leach attention off of televised events and create an association with them.  Marketers have found ways to avoid liability for infringement, but infringers and fakers beware these guys don't mess around.  See  urlLink here :   During Super Bowl week, a contingent of NFL-hired security will prowl Houston streets, trying to curb the sale of knockoff NFL clothing by peddlers and stores. But that still won't stop all the "ambush marketing," promotions that link companies to the league or the game but avoid trademark infringement by not including the NFL logo or even the term "Super Bowl."  "Ambush marketing is a transparent attempt to cash in on the passion of our fans," NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said.    They go after big fish and small; see  urlLink here :   [T]he NFL is suing Yardy and Provider Technologies Inc., a Tampa Internet company, over the Web site operated by the pair to rent homes to those visiting the Tampa Bay area for the Jan. 28 game. The lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in New York seeks unspecified financial damages and a court order immediately forcing them to stop using NFL trademarks. "We're not saying nobody can ever use "Super Bowl' in any form or context," said NFL attorney David Proper. "But there's no doubt in our mind that these guys are using it inappropriately to try to create the appearance of an affiliation to our event that they clearly don't have."

      Good news for Linux and the entire open source movement:   In The SCO Group Inc.'s latest U.S. District Court filing as it battles IBM over Linux, the company is no longer using the affirmative defense that the  urlLink GNU General Public License (GPL)  is unconstitutional.    The general concensus was that the GNU claims were a crock.

"They're removing a silly claim from their lawsuit and retreating to claims that they have a hope of making in court," Perens said.

       urlLink This is a great post  by Martin Schwimmer at  urlLink The Trademark Blog .  Go read it.    Making bobble-head dolls of politicians is ok, but what about Arnold - does he get a special right of celeb because he's an actor as well as a politican?  Also, if you read the  urlLink cease and desist letter  (at the Smoking Gun) Arnold's attorney's sent to the maker of the doll you'll note that they write that the letter is confidential and cannot be reprinted on the Internet, etc.  Where do they think that confidentiality comes from?  There's been no agreement between these two parties re confidentiality.  This is the sort of stuff that gives attorneys a bad rap, trying to take advantage of people and being overly aggresive (just read the letter, it's over the top - although they do sounds pissed off).  If the recipient of the letter was person without access to legal counsel how they know that the letter's claim of confidentiality is BS - they wouldn't, they would be scared into silence, which is probably what Arnold's lawyers were hoping for.  Instead, Arnold's lawyers look like a bunch of jerks with a shaky claim.    There is no confidentiality in a cease and desist letter, anymore than there is in an email I send someone - even if I state just the opposite in the letter.

       urlLink State Rep. Derrick Shepherd, D-Marrero of Louisiana has drafted a bill would ban pants worn too low .

      Don't accuse others of copyright infringment if you can't back up your claim.  It could cost you $300 grand in a defamation suit.  A company named NSM was crawling other sites to get comparitive pricing information for their users.   Boats.com sent out letters to yacht brokers and others, claiming that NSM's data-harvesting was illegal   Oops.    Funny thing is, the plaintiff may have believed for good reason that they were in the right.  There was an eBay case a few years back in which a court ruled that another auction company couldn't crawl eBay's site in order to collect and aggregate auction information from all the online auctions so users could easily do comparitive shopping.  The court considered it a trespass to chattel if I remember correctly.  They reasoned that it was a trespass because the crawling used up eBays computing resources in such a way as to cause them "actual damage" (which was necessary, because with trespass to chattel you need to show actual damages, whereas with trespass on real property there is no need for a showing of damage).    I don't know why that wasn't considered to be a trespass case (different jurisdiction maybe?).  Perhaps because the defendant in this had claimed that the plaintiff was infringing on their copyright and not that they were trespassing - but you can't really hold a normal guy accountable for mixing up legal terms.  Maybe I'll investigate this case a little more one of these days...  Via  urlLink Business Lessons .

      My criminal procedure professor once asked the class how far we thought the police could go in searching or interrogating someone in a way that would normally violate their rights if either the perps life or another person's (or a bunch of people's) life was on the line.  What if it was a terrorist and there was a race against time before a bomb went off somewhere?  What if the perp had kidnapped someone who was missing and probably dying?    The courts have ruled that it is an illegal search (too invasive) to pump someone's stomach if the cops saw him swallow some drugs.  But what if the perp swallowed so many drugs that his life is actually endangered?  A jury in Connecticut has cleared a hospital for doing just that (and also the suppresion of evidence hearing on the motion claiming illegal search and seizure did not fly with the court).   Bridgeport Police Officer Frank D'Amore, who was present during the surgery to seize evidence, also was cleared of the illegal search-and-seizure charge.  "All the treatment he received was medically necessary," said David Robertson, the lawyer from Bai, Pollock and Dunnigan who represented the hospital and its employees. "He's lucky they saved his life."  Embry was brought to the hospital in April 2000 by Bridgeport police after he swallowed at least 26 small packets of crack cocaine during his arrest. Hospital staffers were able to induce Embry into coughing up 25 of the packets, but his blood pressure soared and his heart began to race, suggesting there was more to come.   The kid was still a minor at the time and claimed that even though he gave permission for the surgery he was sedated and the hospital needed permission from his mom.  It took the only jury two hours to decide he was out of luck.  It probably didn't help that was clearly a pro crack dealer.  Not that we know all the facts here, but it seems we got that question for the prof answered - yes, you can conduct an invasive and typically illegal search and siezure if the perp's life may be on the line.  Still unsure about if someone else's life is on the line.    Via  urlLink The ConnPost .

      Looks like conservative Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia's big mouth may keep him from becoming the future Chief Justice.  Check this out:   In emphatic phrases punctuated by operatic gesticulation, [Scalia] then launched into an attack on a series of the most important Supreme Court decisions of the last 40 years. The court was wrong, he said, to say the Constitution requires that lawyers be provided to poor people accused of crimes. It was wrong, too, to find that the First Amendment imposes limits on libel lawsuits.  "We have now determined," he continued, "that liberties exist under the federal Constitution — the right to abortion, the right to homosexual sodomy — which were so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that they were criminal for 200 years."   Too bad we can't put him in a time machine and send him back to a time when the Constitution was not understood in the broader way it is today, I'm sure he'd really enjoy it.  The US Constitution is a living document that grows and evolves with the nation.  As to becoming the Chief Justice:   These days, while he remains the great hope of many conservatives, even some of his admirers say his public profile in a bitterly divided Washington has made such a move unlikely.   ...    Indeed, many experts say that the nation's polarized political environment and Justice Scalia's high profile would doom any chance he has of succeeding Chief Justice Rehnquist.   Scalia claims:   "I am a textualist," he said. "I am an originalist. I am not a nut."   Well, the guy can write well, and he doesn't always go the way you'd think.  For instance, he voted for and wrote an opinion that made it illegal for police to use scanning equipent to observe you in your home from through the walls with devices that can make hear signature readings off the walls (while some of the more liberal justices voted that it was a-ok).  But then he also dissented in a case that made executing retarded people illegal, claiming that the ban was irrational and based only on the opinion of the members of the court (shocker here, I love how when the law is one a person agrees with it is precedent, and when it is something they do not like it is merely an opinion).     urlLink Lawrence Lessig  is a famous law professor, particularly in the area of copyright and cyberlaw.  He (although considered a bit of a lefty now himself) says Scalia has veered hard to the right recently:   "When I worked for him, he had a set of principles, and those principles led to principled results, which were sometimes conservative and sometimes liberal," said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford who was also a law clerk to Justice Scalia. "I don't understand anymore how his jurisprudence follows from his principles."   Via  urlLink The New York Times .

      Now  urlLink Booble.com  is going public too!  I'm sure their stock will shoot straight up, buy, buy, buy!  Booble is a commercial parody that Google probably can't do anything about, other than  urlLink threaten  expensive trademark  urlLink litigation  that is.  Which is  urlLink what they did do , and  urlLink failed  at ( urlLink cease and desist letter and response ).  Who would be confused by this?  Google may have a decent dilution claim though.   urlLink Here is a fantastic satire , go see it now (it's paid for by Ben, of Ben & Jerry's).  What's the difference between satire and parody you ask?  Well, a satire targets something other than the work that is borrowed from.  For instance using a Dr. Suess style of peotry to write a book that attacks OJ Simpson ( urlLink The Cat is Not in the Hat  case), or reworking a commerical for "The Apprentice" to attack Bush.  Parody is when the  work borrowed from is the one being attacked or referenced.  Parody is ok with copyright law, satire is not.    But then...The Apprentice-Bush commercial may actually be permissable because it is political speech and courts give wider latitude in such cases.  A court may even find this anti-Bush ad to be a parody although that seems intellectually ingenuine.  To be fair there are arguments on each side, for instance the maker of the ad could claim that it was partly parody because it is a play on the Donald's incredible ego (he thinks he can fire the president) or the stupidity of the contestants on the show (Bush is as pathetic as they are).  The work need be only partly parody after all.  See for instance the  urlLink Mastercard v. Nader2000  case.  There the court found  urlLink Nader's "Priceless" commercials , as directly borrowed from the popular Mastercard ad campaign, to be fair use under section 107 of the Copyright Act.  Good ole' fair use.  That outcome was welcome.  The Trademark Blog discussed it  urlLink here .  Via  urlLink The Trademark Blog .

       urlLink     Regular readers are aware of my  urlLink highly   urlLink negative   urlLink opinion  of Apple's iPod.    In the several posts linked above, I have recommended looking into the Dell DJ if you are considering getting a hard disk drive based MP3 player because it has double the battery time of the iPod among other differences.  I do not yet own a Dell DJ so take my opinion for what it is worth.  I do, however, own an iPod and I have had nothing but problems with it.    Anyway, I've been made aware of a  urlLink Dell DJ blog / user forum  which could be useful to those who are in the process of making a decision between the DJ and the iPod, or for DJ owners.  Also,  urlLink Dell is offering $100  to anyone who buys a DJ and sends Dell their old iPod.  A cool idea, but I you could sell any newer generation iPod for more than $100 on eBay anyway.    To be repetitive - the newly introduced INDUCE Act threatens the existence of the MP3 player as a device which induces the infringement of copyrights.  See  urlLink these   urlLink links   urlLink for  more INDUCE Act info and links.  Thanks to  urlLink Skrolls  for pointing this out to me.

      Honestly, I hate iPods.  I have one and it is a piece of s**t.  The only reason most people refuse to admit that they are crap even after all the difficulty they have with them is because they can't stand to admit they paid  $400 for something so crappy.  Once you've spent about 40 hours getting it to work right, the battery dies after a few hours of use anyway.  Try the Dell DJ if you are going to buy an MP3 player, and get it quick, before the INDUCE Act passes.  The Dell DJ is actually made to work with Windows OS and has double the battery power of the iPod, it looks pretty nice too (I'll be getting one soon, I'll do a full comparison here when I do).  Taking off on the  urlLink EFF's iPod complaint , in which they drafted a mock complaint against Apple using the terms of the recently introduced INDUCE Act, someone has put up a  urlLink "save the iPod" site .    Ok, I know that because of Apple's huge marketing blitz the iPod is the most popular MP3 player, but why couldn't they have made a "save the MP3 players" website instead?

       urlLink     Mattel has been defending Barbie's integrity in lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit recently.  Awhile back it was over Aqua's "Barbie World" song, more recently it is a Utah man who incorporated nude Barbie dolls in his artwork.     The photos often depicted Barbie dolls placed in sexually provocative positions. One called "Barbie Enchiladas," shows four Barbie dolls inside a lit oven, wrapped in tortillas and covered with salsa in a casserole dish...Forsythe has said he uses Barbies to criticize "the materialistic and gender-oppressive values" he believes the dolls embody.   Mattel lost its case when a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Mattel's appeal and said the Utah man had a First Amendment right to parody Barbie because it is a cultural icon (much like the reasoning of the court in the Aqua case).  "The panel also said Mattel's lawsuit may have been groundless and unreasonable."   The Utah man, who certainly could not afford to litigate against a monster company like Mattel was later awarded legal fees and court costs of $1.8 Million on remand.  He was lucky enough to find pro bono counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and a team of lawyers from a San Francisco law firm, it is the attorneys who get the fees of course.   "Plaintiff (Mattel) had access to sophisticated counsel who could have determined that such a suit was objectively unreasonable and frivolous," Judge Lew wrote in his order. "Instead it appears plaintiff forced defendant into costly litigation to discourage him from using Barbie's image in his artwork. This is just the sort of situation in which this court should award attorneys fees to deter this type of litigation which contravenes the intent of the Copyright Act."  Hopefully this will make companies think twice about going after some of the ridiculous cases they pursue in order to "protect their intellectual property," which really translates to "oppress and chill speech" in these cases.    I am all for the hardcore protection of IP, but like the court said here - Mattel knew this was baseless but tried to bankrupt this guy anyway.  That isn't what the IP laws were created for.  The US Constitution says copyright is supposed to "promote the arts and sciences," not supress them.    Note:  The pic above is not part of the pictures that were at issue in the recent suit.

You can see the art at issue in the case at  urlLink Illegal Art .   urlLink Here  is the recent opinion granting the fees to the defendant,  urlLink here  is the older 9th Circ decision in which they said the case was frivolous.

      I'm celebrating the sucess of this blog!  About three weeks ago I put up a site meter, signed up with some blog directories, and told a few bloggers about the site.  I have recently been getting around 60-80 hits a day and around 1,200 in those three weeks, which is very cool.  To celebrate I am giving away a Gmail invite!  I've got a Gmail invite for whoever wants to beg.  The conditions - either link to this site from your blog, or write me something I would want to post here on my blog (just put it in the comment and I'll copy and post it).  Use the comments to let me know if you link.  I'll make the final decision within a few days.  Good luck!

      On Friday the Senate passed the PIRATE Act, using a speedy method for passage usually reserved from noncontroversial bills.  The House still must vote on the PIRATE Act in order for it to become law.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for coming up with these laws.  Congress is attempting to pass the PIRATE Act in a quick and stealthy fashion, similar to how the the Judiciary Committee is attempting to get the INDUCE Act passed.  These are both very controversial bills and not a single hearing has been held for either of them.  A reason, one suspects, is because the senior members of the Judiciary committe get lots of donations from the entertainment industry: so far in 2004, Patrick Leahy has received $178,000 in campaign contributions from the entertainment industries, that's the second-biggest source of donations to Leahy behind lawyers.  Orrin Hatch has received $152,360.  These guys have definatly gone out for drinks with Jack Valenti after work.  To actually debate these bills would bring to light the Bill's many problems.  The RIAA and MPAA just want them passed, and quickly, before any press and critics get a say.   Foes of the Pirate Act have been alarmed by the unusual alacrity of the proposal's legislative progress. It was introduced just two months ago, on March 25, and not one hearing was held before the Judiciary committee forwarded it to the full Senate for a vote a month later.   For instance, the main change the PIRATE Act will make to US law is that it will allow the Gov't to go after file sharers in a similar fashion to the way the RIAA has been suing them by the hundreds, in civil suits.  Typically the Gov't, when going after criminals, file criminal charges against them.  Obviously their priorities are other than to prosecute teenage file sharers, considering the concern with such other criminal acts as murder, rape, terrorism, etc.  Believe it or not, the Justice Dept does have limited (taxpayer) resources and must pick it's priorities.   The Pirate Act represents the latest legislative priority for the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and its allies, who collectively argue that dramatic action is necessary to prevent file-swapping networks from continuing to blossom in popularity.   They don't want any hearings because there would be some difficule and embarrassing questions:   "I can't imagine that (Hollywood lobbyist) Jack Valenti or (RIAA chairman) Mitch Bainwol really wants to come before Congress and give testimony saying, 'We can't afford to bring these lawsuits. That's why we want the taxpayer to pay for them.' I can't believe they want to do that in public."   Bonus for the entertainment industry, they get to use wiretaps now!   [T]he Justice Department likely would be able to seek wiretaps to collect evidence about P2P infringement. Current wiretap law says electronic communications may be intercepted when a potential federal felony is being investigated.   A basic problem with the PIRATE Act is that it forces the Justice Dept. to do the RIAAs job for it, using taxpayer money.  Should the Justice Dept spend a couple million bucks next year suing file sharers?  Sounds like a waste to me when the RIAA is doing a fine job already.  Also, if the INDUCE Act passes there will be no need to sue file sharers anyway, because there will no longer be any P2P networks or iPods around.   "It represents yet another point in another very long line of major corporate copyright interests pushing for and receiving what amounts to significant corporate welfare," said Adam Eisgrau, a lobbyist for the P2P United trade association. "This legislation literally offloads the cost of enforcing copyrights traditionally borne by the copyright holder onto the federal government and therefore the taxpayers."

Go ahead and try to find an article that casts this bill in a positive light, I dare you (and no press releases from the RIAA, etc.).

      Articles about the INDUCE Act:   urlLink WaPo    urlLink NYT   Two NYT op-eds about file sharing and the negative effects of laws like the INDUCE Act:  NYT op-ed #1 -  urlLink Don't Beat Them, Join Them   NYT op-ed #2 -  urlLink Share the Music   Also, check out the  urlLink EFF Newsroom  for their latest press release.  They have also drafted a mock complaint in which "major recording companies" sue Apple because the iPod, induces consumers to infringe copyrights.  I'd lay down all my worldly possessions (ain't much) on a bet that if the INDUCE Act passes you'll see a flurry of lawsuits against all the MP3 makers, the companies that make their components, and maybe even retailers who sell them.  What would happen then, is that the music companies themselves would control the licensing of the technology and would either let it die off or start doing something like - making MP3 players that require the user's biometric data in order to allow the consumer to listen to the tunes on it. Such devices are  urlLink already in the works .    Thanks to  urlLink Tom  and  urlLink The EFF  for the links.

      It's no surprise they busted this spammer in Las Vegas, that's where I would go too after making the kind of money he made by selling AOL's entire email list to his fellow spammers.   An engineer working for America Online was arrested yesterday and charged with stealing 92 million e-mail addresses of AOL customers and selling them to spammers that were peddling penis enlargement pills and online gambling sites.   The engineer, Jason Smathers, 24, was arrested at his home in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., yesterday. Sean Dunaway, 21, who was described by prosecutors as a broker of e-mail lists for spam, was arrested in Las Vegas.    NYT article  urlLink here .

       urlLink     It seems that the new Beastie Boys CD, when loaded up on a Windows or Mac OS using computer secretly installs copy protection software onto the users computer.  That's pretty dodgy stuff, basically like some sort of hidden malware.  I got the CD a few days ago and it ripped on iTunes just fine, but who knows what the copy protection software does.  According to The Register the "infected" copy of the CD is being sold everywhere except in the US and UK, so chances are most of us are a-ok.  Anyway, it seems there is a way to get rid of it if you have got an infected copy.  See the links below for more.  Note: The Register (and several others) provide information on how to defeat the DRM software (digital rights management).  If the newly introduced INDUCE Act were to pass in Congress this activity create liability for those sites hosting such information because they have induced others to directly infringe on the copyright.  How's that sound?  More on the INDUCE Act can be found  urlLink below .

      If the INDUCE Act had been around for the  Betamax  case, we wouldn't have the VCR.  Sorry the posting has been light lately.  The reason is that I have been doing research on the INDUCE Act proposal.  The question on copyright mavens' minds these days is of course, how will an inducement to infringe doctrine work in copyright?  So far it all looks a bit scary, like maybe iPods and silly putty will end up being outlawed.    If you have been out of the loop, in the dark, not in the echo chamber of the blogosphere, and with your head the sand lately; then maybe you have not heard about the INDUCE Act.  It is a bill that was introduced by Sen. Hatch this morning that proposes to add a new version of third party liability to the Copyright Act, one of "inducement to infringe a copyright."    The bill is touted as merely shuttling the patent law concept of inducement into the copyright law, thus "bringing copyright law up to date."  But the fact is that copyright already has two versions of third party liability that, along with the "substantial noninfringing uses" doctrine from the  Betamax  case, accomplish the same goals as the inducement doctrine does in patent law.  Since it is apparent that it would be pointless to enact a statute that has no effect on the Copyright Act, one must assume that the INDUCE Act will actually make some changes.  We can tell what those changes are because of the INDUCE Acts stated aim - to kill off the P2P networks.  In order to do so the induce doctrine in copyright law will have to utilize a general intent standard as opposed to the specific intent standard that the inducement doctrine in patent utilizes.  It follows that any creator, manufacturer, or retailer of a device that is clearly capable of infringement may then be liable for inducement to infringe copyright, even without specifically intending to induce the direct infringements by others!  Say good bye to your iPods folks.  Seriously, if law was around in the early 80's we wouldn't have been allowed to have VCRs.  The INDUCE will eviscerate the doctrine of substantial noninfringing uses.  Ouch!  Worst of all, in the longrun, this technology killing bill with impede competition and innovation in the tech sector of the economy.  That effects all consumers.  So while you may not sympathize with the P2P networks (I don't personally), that doesn't mean you should support the bill.  We will all lose with this bill, ironically enough even the media industry will lose, as we saw with the VCR, young immature technologies can often be harnassed in such a way as to become money makers.  We may never find out what the mature versions of some new technologies end up being though, because the INDUCE Act will kill them off in their infant stage or even before they are born (who's going to invest in tech capable of copying media after this?).    I'll have much more on this issue in the near future.  And it will be less of a rant, I promise.

But really, the reason you should go to the site and see this is not merely because of this man's ridiculous hair, but because you can click on the picture to get a bigger version, and from there you can cycle through all the pictures in the "weird news" section.  It's worth it if you have 5 or 10 minutes to slack, there is some crazy (and some no big deal) stuff there.    The pics include, but are not limited to: a wild bear walking right up to some unsuspecting people in a hospital; a dog with prosthetic feet; the biggest sandwich ever; a car dangling out of a parking garage window several stories up; cops trying to pull over an escaping ostrich; a small shark attached to a man's leg; kids breakdancing for the pope; and a fried cow-brain sandwich.

      Apparently around 73% of all the Tiffany jewelry sold on eBay is counterfiet.     Using eBay programs like VeRO, Tiffany had two employees work full-time policing the site and forced the shutdown of about 19,000 auction sites on eBay, he said. This year, Tiffany randomly bought silver "Tiffany" jewelry on eBay and found that 73 percent of it was counterfeit, 5 percent of it was genuine and the rest was promoted as "Tiffany-like" but not promoted as genuine.   Tiffany has had it up to here, they've filed suit to keep eBay from selling any more counterfiet Tiffany goods.  How would eBay know which are real and which fake?    There was a similar case in 2002 -  Gentry v. eBay  - eBay was sued for selling fake sports merchandise, like signed baseballs, hats and so on.  eBay was made aware that a large portion of what was being sold was fake but they did nothing about it and were eventually sued by some customers.  eBay was off the hook because they are internet service provider as opposed to the content provider, and thus enjoy near immunity according to the Communications Decency Act (CDA) section 270.  At the time, the case represented an expanded interpretation of the immunity the CDA provided.  The court found that even though eBay made loads of money from the fake merchandise and had been on notice since 1996 that much of the sports memoribelia being sold was fake, they were not liable because they provided no warranty as to the authenticity of the goods and nor did they provide the content claiming the goods were authentic.    I don't see how this case would turn out any different, unless the courts decided to rein in the now (overly?) expansive protection the CDA provides.  Go ahead and type in  urlLink "tffany jewelry" at eBay , you'll be shocked at how you can get real Tiffany goods for only around $10!  Article  urlLink here .

       urlLink     Ray Bradbury appears to be seriously considering litigation over Michael Moore's "Fahrenhiet 9-11" movie title.   Bradbury, who is a registered political independent, said he would rather avoid litigation and is "hoping to settle this as two gentlemen, if he'll shake hands with me and give me back my book and title."  The film is being released this friday, so there's really no chance that the title will be changed at this late stage.  There's more on the Fahrenhiet 9-11 title issue in this  urlLink earlier post .  There, I wondered if the titles were actually related at all, but they obviously are as Moore has said that Fahrenhiet 9-11 is the "temperature at which freedom burns."  Bradbury's book is named Fahrenheit 451 because that's "the temperature at which books burn."  A confusion analysis would probably not work here, as consumers are unlikely to be confused as to the source of the film being Moore and not Bradbury.  A dilution analysis may work, if the book's title can be considered a trademark.  Article  urlLink here .

       urlLink     Scott Richter, the president of OptInRealBig, is known as the "spam king" (even though he's only the world's third biggest spammer, according to  urlLink spamhaus ).  You have almost certainly received email from this man before.   urlLink OptInRealBig  has a pretty professional looking website for a company that sells penis enlargement pills, it seems strange to me that Richter would even try to appear on the up and up.   urlLink Then again  "his 28-employee company, OptInRealBig, clears $2 million in sales each month. He drives a Lexus convertible and a Lexus SUV, owns a half-million-dollar home outside Denver..."    Richter and some of his associates were recently  urlLink sued  by the New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer:   With cooperation from Microsoft, the New York Attorney General's Office tracked these e-mail messages to identify separate marketing campaigns that passed through 514 IP addresses around the world. The investigation identified Richter in Colorado and his partners in Washington, Texas and New York as responsible for the campaigns.   They also determined that the e-mail messages were developed and sent in violation of the law. Some appeared to come from a foreign government's defense ministry, others from a hospital, and still more from elementary and high schools. According to the lawsuits, those spam e-mail messages used other people's sender names, false subject lines, fake server names, inaccurate and misrepresented sender addresses, or obscured transmission paths, all in violation of New York and Washington state law.  Recently Richter unveiled a "Spam King" clothing line and was promptly  urlLink threatened  by Hormel, the makers of SPAM the pork product "food."  Hormel makes their position clear on the  urlLink SPAM website :    You've probably seen, heard or even used the term "spamming" to refer to the act of sending unsolicited commercial email (UCE), or "spam" to refer to the UCE itself. Following is our position on the relationship between UCE and our trademark SPAM.   Use of the term "spam" was adopted as a result of the Monty Python skit in which our SPAM meat product was featured. In this skit, a group of Vikings sang a chorus of "spam, spam, spam . . . " in an increasing crescendo, drowning out other conversation. Hence, the analogy applied because UCE was drowning out normal discourse on the Internet.   We do not object to use of this slang term to describe UCE, although we do object to the use of the word "spam" as a trademark and to the use of our product image in association with that term. Also, if the term is to be used, it should be used in all lower-case letters to distinguish it from our trademark SPAM, which should be used with all uppercase letters.   Note that one of the first commercial spammings was  urlLink committed by attorneys  Canter and Siegel in 1994 to advertise their immigration law services.  Surprised?

      Some South Jersey men have been billing for the use of their names.  No one has been spared, including their own attorneys.  So far they have forced at least one Judge into involuntary bankruptcy.     At first, the judges and lawyers involved scoffed. They ignored escalating bills - for $3 million, $228 million, even $923 million.  A year later, on the eve of their trial, no one is laughing.  To collect on these purported debts, the defendants, who belong to an antigovernment group called the Moors, have filed million-dollar liens and lawsuits against various public officials, and have threatened to throw them into involuntary bankruptcy.  These guys are an interesting bunch:   [The]defendants are members of an organization called the Al Moroccan Empire, or Moors, a group that does not believe it is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. They cite a 1790s treaty between the U.S. and Morocco to assert that U.S. laws do not apply to them.  Check out  urlLink this article  for more.

       urlLink     For fans of James Joyce's hefty   urlLink Ulysses  , tommorow is a big day, it's the 100th anniversary of Bloomsday.  Bloomsday is so named for the main character of the book, Leopold Bloom.  The book is a step-by-step account of Bloom's activities on June 16th, 1904 in Dublin, Ireland.  Ulysses was published in 1922 and was subsequently banned in Ireland and the US for sometime, in part because it was considered pornographic.  it finally became available in the US in 1934 after a landmark decision.  The biggest Bloomsday celebrations occur in Dublin, where visitors mob the city and retrace Bloom's every step through the city and his every act (which includes eating a gorganzola sandwich and a grilled kidney by the way, ugh).  The Bloomsday celebrations also typically involve readings from Ulysses, which is of course, a  public performance  of the work.  Public performance is a right reserved to the copyright holder.    Enter Stephen Joyce, ultralitigious greedy copyright fiend (I'm all for strongly enforcing copyrights, but this is a special case).  Stephen is James' grandson and has seeminly made a living enforcing his copyrights in James Joyce's works.     He is the man literary Ireland fears most. Stephen Joyce, the highly litigious grandson of Ireland's greatest writer, James Joyce, has devoted his life to fiercely protecting his grandfather's copyright, setting his lawyers on those foolhardy enough to take the Joyce name in vain or to reproduce Joyce's words without consent.   Few are spared. He has targeted publishing houses, internet readings and even an Irish composer who requested permission to quote 18 words of Finnegans Wake and received a letter saying: "To put it politely, my wife and I don't like your music."   But now, fearful for this month's mammoth celebrations of Joyce's masterpiece, Ulysses, Irish MPs yesterday rushed through emergency legislation which will prevent Mr Joyce from suing the government and the National Library over an exhibition which displays 500 pages of Joyce manuscripts bought for €12.6m in 2002.  From article  urlLink here .  Stephen has forced the official celebration to forgo doing readings from Ulysses and from performing one of James Joyce's plays by threatening to sue.   Senator David Norris, a Joycean scholar, told colleagues in the Irish Senate: "It is an astonishing irony that a man such as James Joyce, who fought for freedom of expression . . . and committed himself so totally against censorship, should now find his works being . . . removed from public gaze by his own estate."  That's really sad.  I'm glad to see that Ireland is smacking Stephen a bit.  Can you imagine legislation like this going through in the US?  I know that the copyright in the famous Kennedy assasination video was stripped because it was considered to be too important to the US to allow one person to control its viewing.

      I'm sure I know a few people at my law school (Cardozo) that could have authored  urlLink this email :   To: [X] Subject: Invoice 6/12/04 Date: Sat, 12 Jun 2004 17:15:59 EDT   Dear [WOMAN'S NAME]  On June 5, you agreed to accept dinner, paid for in full, by me, based on your stated offer that we would go out again. In that you have ignored all overtures to said follow up meeting, you are hereby considered in breach of contract.  To that end, you are being invoiced for 50% of the cost of the dinner, pursuant to the offer. For the record, the offer presented you with the option of not going out again and paying for half of the dinner, or going out again and not paying at all. You accepted these terms, choosing to go out again, as stated above, but have since failed to deliver your end of the agreement. In that this was merely a promise to meet, and not a promise to marry, the agreement is binding under New York law and does not require a written agreement (i.e. statute of frauds).  Furthermore, this is absolutely not a joke.  Your share is 50% of $74.51 which is a total of $37.25. Payment in full is expected within 30 days.

       urlLink    Perhaps you saw the New York Times  urlLink article  concerning obsessive blogging that ran in late May (unfortunately the article is now in the NYT archives so you'll have to pay to see it, unless of course you want to see an infringing distribution about halfway down the page on  urlLink this website  or  urlLink here ).  I actually saw the article in the International Herald Tribune while in France, on vacation (during which I posted on the rare occasion, I should add).  There is a decent summary of the article  urlLink here .    The article, at one point discusses a Mr. Wiggins and his masturbatory like addiction to blogging.  The author creates the image of addicted bloggers sitting on toilets posting to their blogs while on vacation and includes a photo of Mr. Wiggins posting poolside surrounded by relaxing vacationers.  According to the article, the addict blogger hides his embarrassing habit from his family and friends like he was shooting up heroin.    Mr. Wiggins' blog is  urlLink here .  He writes about the NYT article  urlLink here  (actually the post largely concerns the computer he is using in the photo), the post includes the picture from the article.    Here's the funny part - apparently Mr. Wiggins actually contacted the reporter to tell her about an  urlLink idea  he had for an article he thought she'd be interested in.  She asked him if he'd told anyone else about it, he said no, but noted that he posted about it on his blog, which was read by almost no one.  The conversation with the reporter then quickly turned to why he wrote stuff no one reads and  voila , the conversation and article topic morphed into one about "obsessive" blogging that made Mr. Wiggins out to be a rather pathetic specimen (whether he was aware of the thrust of the article prior to its publication is unclear).  The reporter is completely unsure of why a person would write anything that they are not paid for.  Mr. Wiggins commented on  urlLink this post  on my friend Tom's blog,  urlLink Tom Thinks , to tell more about his side of the story.    Noteworthy is the fact that Mr. Wiggins posts to his blog far less than most bloggers I know or read (including myself)...does that mean we should all be attending B.A. meetings?

       urlLink     The "iRaq" posters showing up on the streets of NYC.  Parody or satire?    Answer - the clear target of these remixed ads is society/politics in general and not Apple or the iPod, these are satire.  The ads are political speech, but the political point they make could be made using any variety of remixed marks, therefore the legal system probably would not recognize the use of Apple's mark as a fair one.    An analysis of a case here may be similar to that of the 1997 "The Cat Not in the Hat" case (Dr. Seuss v. Penguin Books).  There, the 9th Circ. found that the Dr. Seuss style book, which targeted O.J. Simpson and his crazy trial, did not sufficiently riducule the original work of Dr. Seuss to be considered a parody.  Here is a link to a  urlLink sample poem .  Here's the  urlLink decision .   urlLink Here   urlLink are   urlLink summaries  of several parody v. satire cases.

      Today during a walk through Battery Park, only blocks from my apartment, I happened upon a police bust of people who were selling counterfeit purses.  The sale of counterfeit purses, sunglasses, watches and whatever else, is common practice in Battery Park, which is typically thick with tourist traffic.  Battery Park is located right at the southern tip of Manhattan, where the ferrys from Staten Island and the Statue of Liberty leave and arrive.  In the 3 acre park there are also several war memorials, and a memorial for the victims of the 9/11 attacks, which occured only a few hundred feet away.    Battery Park, while popular, is certainly eclipsed by Canal St. as the main New York City spot for selling counterfeit goods.  Here is a nice  urlLink descriptive blog post  about Battery Park, pictures of counterfeit material  urlLink being sold there , and the Park's  urlLink unofficial site .  [Click on any of the pics for a larger version.]   urlLink    This is the scene after police cordoned off the area, which was teeming with tourists.  The two closest men are undercover officers, these aren't secret service agent style undercovers with black suits, they look just like normal tourists.  Beyond the men and mostly out of view there are several garbage bags full of counterfeit purses the police have confiscated.     urlLink    Here is a pic from a little further out.  On the left of the piture you can see an officer holding a white bag full of counterfeit material.  The white car is an unmarked police car.   urlLink      urlLink    Here you see some undercovers outside of the cordoned off area chatting up a few of those who I suspect were the "innocent until proven guilty" parties (who are on the right).  It appeared that the police were going to let the offenders go, only confiscating their counterfeit goods.  In my experience those selling the counterfeit purses are almost always immigrants, and I believe that was the case here (African, possibly Senegalese).  There probably is little reason to arrest these small time players who are just trying to get by in New York City, this racket is controlled by big time organized crime.  The police didn't like my picture taking and told me to get out of there.  I wanted to get an interview with an officer and some more pics, but so goes it.  Maybe next time.  There were no media photographers or reporters there, but I will follow up and check for further stories or reports.

      Famous sci-fi and nonfiction author and Wired contributor  urlLink Bruce   urlLink Sterling  advocates more law enforcement on the Net.     Most of the advancements in Internet commerce since the dot-com bust have been illegal, Sterling noted, including spamming, identity theft, and "phishing," which is theft of credit card numbers or other personal information by directing customers to bogus Web sites to change their account settings. "If you advance into mayhem, that's not advancement, that's driving into a ditch," he added.   I'm not sure I agree with this statement.  There have been advancements across the e-commerce board recently, however, it may be that legitimate Internet users are currently losing the arms race against malware writers.  It is more disturbing though, when you consider malware as a business itself, and not as a bored teenager at home screwing around.     The authors of the Witty worm targeted users of Internet Security Systems Inc.'s products, while the Bagel and Mydoom virus authors attempted to turn infected computers into spam-sending machines, Sterling said. "Bagel and Mydoom are the future of virus-writing because they have a business model," he said. "Those are organized crime activities. ... These are crooks."  Virus and worm writing will grow as a weapon for terrorists and warring nations, he predicted...   "This is the birth of a genuine, no-kidding, for-profit ... multinational criminal underworld," he said. "I don't see any way it can't happen. We're going to end up getting pushed around by bands of international electronic thieves in a very similar way to the way we've been pushed around by gangs of international Mafia and international Mujahideen terrorists."   This is scary stuff, on the other hand, people are becoming more and more suspicious of statements that attempt to tie terrorism to just about everything that's wrong on planet Earth.  But then you hear about things like this - terrorist have been making millions by  urlLink running   urlLink cigarettes  into New York from southern states where the taxes are much lower.  These guys are pretty resourceful.    Inforworld article re Sterling  urlLink here .

      A student at a British university is suing his school for negligence.  He admits to plagiarism by downloading material from the Web, but claims that he didn't know it wasn't allowed and that the school was negligent for not catching him early on and stopping him.     Michael Gunn, a 21-year-old English student, told the Times Higher: "I hold my hands up. I did plagiarise. I never dreamt it was a problem.  I can see there is evidence I have gone against the rules, but they have taken all my money for three years and pulled me up the day before I finished.  If they had pulled me up with my first essay at the beginning and warned me of the problems and consequences, it would be fair enough.  But all my essays were handed back with good marks and no one spotted it."  I guess this doesn't have much to do with IP law beside the fact that this kid was obviously infringing on copyrights, but it is pretty funny anyway.

       urlLink     urlLink Caped Masked and Armed dot com  is running a series of remixed TV advertisements, check them out.   urlLink Lessig  notes that this is part of the newish remix culture.  This remix culture exists largely on the left side of the political stream and is called "jamming," a term popularized by Kalle Lasn's book " urlLink Culture Jam ."  Caped Masked and Armed note on their website:   The following [ad jams] are meant only as humorous, satirical works of art. They are not meant for sale or profit in any way, shape or form. Please see the fair use notice at the bottom of this page. Also If you would like to download and/or add them to your own site, feel free!  They probably meant to say that the ads are parodies, because as we all know, satire is not protected under the fair use provision of the Copyright Act.    A use can contain both satire and parody and will still be fair use, but if the use is soley satirical then it is not fair use.  The differece being that satire targets society in general and parody targets the work being used (or the products they advertise in this case).  Since these ad jams are noncommerical and are political speech that target the ads they should be considered a fair use of the ads they take footage from.  The jams about  urlLink Fox News  and The US  urlLink Air Force  (slightly graphic) are among the most powerful.  Also, check out  urlLink Gunner Palace dot com .  Apparently some soldiers in Iraq are making their own documentary about thier experiences.  This is almost certainly unauthorized by the US Gov't.  I am not sure I would call it a political remix excactly, but it is certainly futher testiment to the power of digital technology and the Internet to make information available.  There are two videos on the page (trailers for the film), check out the rap video, it's actually pretty good and certainly contains a powerful message from one of our soldiers.

       urlLink    College students are downloading pirated copies of required textbooks and reading them on their screens or printing them out.  I sympathize with these students as a deeply in debt law student.  Textbooks often cost $100 or more each, some semesters I have paid out well over $500 for a bunch of books that I will never use again.  Apparently textbooks are not all that is available on popular P2P networks such as KaZaA, you can also get copies of the South Beach Diet, The Da Vinci Code, all the Harry Potter books, and so on.  If you're really net savvy you can get even more on the IRC (Internet Relay Chat network)at a site called "#Bookz".     Envisional, a company based in Britain that tracks Internet piracy, estimates that 25,000 to 30,000 pirated titles are available on the Web. The vast majority are English-language titles...  Obviously this is all serious copyright infringement and is illegal.  As can be imagined the publishing industry has taken notice and is sending out C&D letters and shutting down certain chat sites.    I recommend checking out  urlLink Project Gutenberg  for works that have fallen into the public domain.  They have a vast library of classics (and some more recent public domain works) available for free.  Article via  urlLink The New York Times .

      Not much to do with IP law, just some interesting trivia really.  Article  urlLink here .   A record 4.7 million Internet addresses were sold in the first three months of 2004, bringing the total number of registered addresses to a new high of 62.9 million, according to a study released today by Mountain View, Calif.-based VeriSign Inc.   The growing demand for domain names was fueled in part by the new availability of Internet addresses that use Arabic, Chinese and Russian characters...  More interesting are proposals for new  urlLink top level domains  that  urlLink ICANN  is currently considering.  Check  urlLink here  for basic info on the list of proposals, which include .xxx, .mail, .cat, .asia, .jobs, .mobi, .tel, and .travel.  Although no TLD will eclipse .com, .net, and .org in importance in the near furure (although .uk and .de are giving them a run for their money), it would be nice to see more internet realestate open up.  Also, creating new TLDs  urlLink would aid  in content blocking (ie if porn is put in .xxx it will be easier to block by blocking all .xxx sites) and in fighting spam (by giving only reputable mailers a .mail TLD and blocking others).  ICANN is set to make decisions about the new TLDs in December.    However,  urlLink Tim Berners-Lee , one of the fathers of the Web (he created hyperlinks and the first browser) and certainly a net cognoscenti (netoscenti?), thinks it may be a  urlLink bad idea  to add the new TLDs.  One reason is that it will be expensive for trademark owners, who will have to purchase their trademarks in all of the new domain names (which will undoubtedly spark a new load of UDRP proceedings).  He is specifically unhappy about .mobi though, because its terms of use appear to violate the universality principle of the Internet by cordoning off a certain section for use by low bandwidth or small screened mobile devices, thus destroying the current independence between Web/software and the Internet as a dumb network.  He points out creating a TLD for a specific technology is silly as that technology will likely change dramatically or be eclipsed in the near future anyway.

       urlLink     urlLink Ray Bradbury  is extremey upset over the title of  urlLink Micheal Moore's  new film, Fahrenheit 9-11, which recently won the Palm D'or at the 2004 Cannes film festival.  Bradbury said in an interview:   "Michael Moore is a screwed a--hole, that is what I think about that case," Bradbury said according to an English translation of the story. "He stole my title and changed the numbers without ever asking me for permission."   But there are actually other works that use the Fahrenheit title as well, such as  urlLink Farenheit 666 .  Perhaps that book wasn't popular enough to be worth getting upset about, or maybe because it is spelled wrong they just figure the author is a moron and not worth the trouble.  If you read the interveiw it seems that Bradbury blames Moore for doing in Wesley Clark's campaign for the democratic nomination for president this year by associating himself with the General, apparently Clark was Bradbury's candidate of choice.    So is this infringement?  I doubt it.  A book title cannot be copyrighted or trademarked.  Also, although it seems that the title of Moore's documentary is a reference to Bradbury's book, this isn't really so clear, it could just be a reference to how upset you'll get when you watch the film.   urlLink Several   urlLink articles , however, assume a connection.  Bradbury refused to say whether he would take legal action against Moore.    On Moore's victory at Cannes Bradbury said:   "Who cares? Nobody will see his movie. It is almost dead already. Never mind, nobody cares."  Moore's film won the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival last month and is scheduled to hit theaters on June 25.  Of the Cannes award, Bradbury told the paper: "I have won prizes in different places and they are mostly meaningless. The people there hate us, which is why they gave him the d'Or. It's a meaningless prize."   Judging by the sucess of Moore's last film, which made $20 million, and all the hype surrounding Fahrenheit 9-11, the film should be one of the biggest money making documentaries ever.  See the  urlLink trailor here , it's the best political ad this presidential campaign has seen so far.  Fahrenheit 9-11 opens June 25th and is sure to spark debate and raise people's temperatures.

       urlLink    Did you know that "Don't Mess with Texas" is actually supposed to refer to keeping their highways clean from litter?  I lived in Texas for two years while doing a master's degree and saw the roadside signs all the time.  But I never realized that the phrase was created soley for anti-litter campaign purposes.  I always figured that the Texas Dept. of Transportation had merely co-opted an old phrase that was generally meant to evoke a macho Texas that once fought for its freedom from Mexico, was once it's own country, and is the biggest state and so on and so forth (you can't even be in Texas for five minutes without hearing all of those truths).    Actually, the "Don't Mess with Texas" phrase came about in 1987, and was only registered in 2000.  It was originally created as an anti-littering message, but now appears on loads of unrelated merchandise.  Now, all these years later, the Texas Dept. of Transportation wants to enforce its trademark and is sending out cease and desist letters (23 so far).  But just consider all of the products this has appeared on, it will be difficult for them to now rein in use of the mark, to say the least.    My guess is that they are now becoming concerned because the phrase is being used by anti-abortion activists that they do not wish to be associated with:   Trademark and patent lawyer Ted Stevenson said the department would have a difficult time showing that consumers were confusing the abortion-rights T-shirts with its anti-litter campaign. However, the state could claim its message is being diluted by the slogan's unauthorized uses.   Here is the official  urlLink Don't Mess with Texas website .  Article via  urlLink Yahoo! News .

      The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a think tank funded in part by Microsoft, has concluded (but has not yet offered any evidence) that Linus Torvalds did not actually write the open source Linux operating system.  This is probably only worth noting because of Linus Torvalds response:   "OK, I admit it. I was just a front man for the real fathers of Linux: the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. They (for obvious reasons) couldn't step forward to admit that they had gotten bitten by the computer bug and had been developing a series of operating systems on their own during the off-season.  "But when they started with Linux (which they originally called Freax—they do feel like outsiders, you know, and that's a whole sad story in itself), they felt that they could no longer just let it languish in obscurity.   "They started to look for a front man, and since Santa Claus is from Finland, and thus has connections to Helsinki University, and the Easter Bunny claimed, 'He's got good ears, if a bit small,' I got selected.  "Since then, I've lived a life of subterfuge, always afraid that somebody would find out the truth. I'm actually relieved that it's over, and that the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution has finally uncovered the lie. I can now go back to my chosen profession, the exploration of the fascinating mating dance of the aquatic African frog."  Of course, the reality is that the think tank is claiming that most of the material used in the operating system was lifted, not that Linus didn't put it together.  But who cares, it's funny.

      A comic book artist from Texas has created an alternate sound and dialogue track for the first Harry Potter film, he has called the new creation "Wizard People, Dear Reader."  You see the film as it was shot, but with completely different dialogue.     With Mr. Neely's gravelly narration, the movie's tone shifts into darkly comic, pop-culture-savvy territory. Hagrid, Harry Potter's giant, hairy friend, becomes Hagar, the Horrible, and Harry's fat cousin becomes Roast Beefy. As imagined by Mr. Neely, the three main characters are child alcoholics with a penchant for cognac, the magical ballgame Quidditch takes on homoerotic overtones, and Harry is prone to delivering hyper-dramatic monologues. "I am a destroyer of worlds," bellows Mr. Neely at one point, sending laughter reverberating through the warehouse Friday night. "I am Harry" expletive "Potter!"  Sounds pretty funny.  Apparently some video rental stores in Texas have bundled Wizard People, Dear Reader with the original film, I'm guessing these aren't chains like Blockbuster.  Wizard People, Dear Reader has gotten more attention since being shown at the New York Underground Film Festival recently.    No doubt, Warner Brothers will be taking an interest in this work by means of a cease and desist letter.  It certainly appears at first blush that this would be a derivitive work of the original.  Creating derivitive works is a right only the copyright owner may excersise.  However, this may be a fair use if Wizard People, Dear Reader is parodic to some degree; meaning it criticizes the original work.  Also favoring a fair use finding are the facts that Wizard People, Dear Reader will not replace the original in the marketplace and that it is not a blatantly commercial use.     It is not clear that Mr. Neely's soundtrack violates the studio's copyright. Jonathan Zittrain, co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, said that while the copyright holder retains the rights to derivative works, it was possible "Wizard People" was protected under the rules that allow "fair use" of copyrighted works for purposes like criticism, comment and news reporting.   The Wizard People, Dear Reader audiotrack is available for download from  urlLink Illegal Art dot org  (where you can also download DJ Danger Mouse's "The Grey Album," the subject of recent copyright difficulties; and view various other works that infringe on copyrights and trademarks).

I am also wondering whether the creators obtained permission to use the trademarks and copyrights they utilize, my guess is no (based mainly on the fact that the video isn't featured on an official Transformers website).  This reminds me of the video featuring the Peanuts crew signing Outcast's "Hey Ya."  Don't you miss that video?  Here's the most  urlLink recent news on the Peanuts video , I imagine the Transformers one will go the same way.

       urlLink    Here is a shot of the UN WIPO building in Geneva (or OMPI, if you prefer French).  I spoke with various random NGO and UN employees in Geneva while I visited (that's what half of the residents are after all), and they said that WIPO was the fastest growing branch of the UN.  Indeed there was a construction project going on at the base of the WIPO building to add a new wing, I left that out of the picture though because it wasn't so attractive.  I must say, I would certainly not mind working in this building when I finish law school.  Any WIPO employees out there that want to help me out?

       urlLink    Disney is very agressive in protecting their intellectual property.  I have little doubt that even using this font would get you a cease and desist letter here in the US, and then a lawsuit if you didn't comply.  As with the examples in the below posts, a dilution theory would probably be most effective in pursuing a case against this pizzeria since Disney is a famous trademark and it is unlikely that consumers would be confused as to whether this was a Disney owned pizzeria.    I took this photo in the old section of Cannes while on vacation there last week.

       urlLink    I imagine that Subway, the sandwich chain, would disapprove of this (click on the picture to see a larger version).  Like with all these pics, a confusion analysis of US trademark law may be less effective in attacking this use than a dilution theory because few people would probably be confused as to whether or not this fast food joint in Cannes is a true Subway (of the US variety).    I took this photo in the old section of Cannes last week.

       urlLink    This is the best and funniest example of trademark infringement that I saw during my vacation in Geneva.  I think McDonald's and Nike would both have something to say about Mike Wong's asian fast food joint.    I am unfamiliar with the trademark law in Switzerland, but if Nike or McDonald's were to bring an infringement case against a Mike Wong here in the US they would probably want to use a dilution theory.  Reason being, it is unlikely that anyone would be confused by this use of the Nike swoosh or the McDonand's "M", it is just obvious that Mike Wong's has nothing to do with Nike or McDonald's.  On the other hand, an infringement by confusion analysis could work, as long as the plaintiffs get some survey results showing that average consumers believe there is some permission from, connection with, or sponsorship by, the plaintiffs in the defendant's use of the trademarks.    By the way, I believe Mike Wong's used to be called  urlLink McWong's !   urlLink This travel guide  notes: "Rumour has it that the owner has had trouble from McDonald's for imitating their name and logo."  Shocker.

      I have yet to write a post concerning patent law, but  urlLink this article  on the BBC website piqued my interest.  I then noticed this  urlLink similar article  in Wired.    The issue the articles address is the ease of patenting ridiculous and obvious "innovations" and then using them to restrict competition.  Clearly no one should be able to patent the double-clicking or holding down of a button on electronic devices, and yet Microsoft has done just that for PDAs.  You do not need to be a legal expert to see how this is anti-competitive.  The idea is simple and needs to be available for others to use on thier products without facing the threat of legal action.  Companies shouldn't have to pay to license such an obvious idea, and MS could always deny such a license to competitors, severly damaging the usability of competing products.    The FTC may be ready to change the practice of granting what many contend are frivolous patents.     Mad cap patents ranging from protecting a method of painting by dipping a baby's bottom into paint or a system for keeping track of people queuing for the bathroom may soon be a thing of the past if the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has its way.  "The intellectual property system was designed to create incentives for people to innovate by giving them, for want of a better word, a monopoly on their ideas for a certain period of time," FTC commissioner Mozelle Thompson told BBC News Online.  "But we have seen instances where companies use that monopoly in an anti-competitive way, sometimes to prevent other products from getting to market, to prevent people from sharing ideas and to prevent the kind of innovation that the patent system is really trying to spur on."   Essentially, the bar will be raised for what will be a patentable invention.  The BBC article points out that a major problem for the PTO (Patent and Trademark Office) is that they are badly underfunded and therefore cannot thoroughly check most applications.     The National Academy of Sciences is calling for more funding for the patent office where 3,000 examiners handle 350,000 applications a year with an average of 17 to 25 hours to check on the validity of a patent application.   My belief is that this situation need be addressed as to not only patent, but also copyright and trademark.  It is necesary to toughen the review process in order to renew faith in the US's intellectual property practices generally.  My understanding is that courts typically give slight consideration to a work's registration status when considering the validity of its protected status, even where a registration is supposed to be prima facie evidence that the work deserves protection.  When even the courts consider the registration process to be a sham then something should be done.  Via  urlLink BBC  and  urlLink Wired .

      This is certainly the first time this site has been discussed in Kanji.

The post concerns the recent JibJab crisis and links to Ernie, Martin, and myself. That's pretty cool to get linked in Japan, and also pretty cool having your blog translated into other languages and syndicated by CNet.  You can check out the full  urlLink Lessig Blog in Kanji , it probably won't do you any good though (I feel pretty confident saying that because I know from "site meter" tracking data that 100% of my readers use an English language browser).

      More on trademarks in Vietnam. Farmers are  urlLink teaming up  to get their trademarking on.    The Vietnam Farm Produce Trademark Building Club made its debut on Friday, attracting nearly 30 Vietnamese businesses.  Director of Trung Nguyen Coffee, Dang Le Nguyen Vu, a founding member of the club, explained that the club selected farm produce to build trademarks because up to 80 percent of the Vietnamese population lives on agricultural production.  Mr Vu said most of the Vietnamese farm produce are unprocessed, therefore, they do not create high values for farmers to increase their revenues. ... “Up to 90 percent of Vietnam’s farm produce is exported through intermediary channels at lower prices,“ Mr Vu said, “These products are then stamped with foreign trademarks and sold at higher prices. In the end, Vietnamese farmers are the losers.”  He said: ”It is time to build trademarks for Vietnamese farm produce to maintain and raise the quality and prestige of our products. It is the only way to increase the value of our products and improve farmers’ living conditions.”   Good stuff. The Voice of Vietnam article  urlLink here .    UPDATE :  urlLink Here's more  on tradmarks in the fashion sector of Vietnam's economy. Check out the prices for clothes.  Apparently this trademark stuff is big news in Vietnam these days, at least at the  urlLink The Voice of Vietnam .

      I ran across this article from a site called  urlLink The Voice of Vietnam  titled:  urlLink "Trademark is Culture for Global Integration Process ." I'm not sure that title was properly translated, but the article is very interesting.    According to the Department of Intellectual Properties under the Ministry of Science and Technology, from 1995 to 2002, as many as 8,632 foreign firms registered for [intellectual] property rights in Vietnam, while only 305 Vietnamese enterprises registered. The figures represent 98.7 percent and 1.3 percent of the total number of certificates granted to foreign and domestic firms, respectively. This trend is a warning bell for Vietnamese products and farm produce prior to the country’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  According to the Ministry of Trade, as many as 4,206 US business trademarks have been registered in Vietnam, less than one percent in comparison to the number of registered trademarks in the US during the 1997-2003 period. ... For the past 10 years, the concept of "marketing accompanying the quality of goods" has appeared in the consciousness of consumers and the gap between Vietnamese consumers ... This represents a belief that the quality of goods and the significance of a trademark have strong links. Consequently, the quality of goods alone is not enough. It is essential to create an attractive image through the character of a trademark. Therefore, giving a name for a product is part of the culture of running a business.   Wow, it is hard to believe there are places where marketing and quality of goods are just only now becoming linked in the minds of consumers. In the USA it is almost to the point where (some) people are aware that the connection between quality and marketing is at least tenuous, which is a whole different level of consumerism.   The article goes on to describe what the purpose of trademarks are for products in an attempt to get Vietnamese producers to start creating more of them.    Currently, Vietnam has more than 500 trademarks. However, creating a successful trademark in Vietnam is not an easy task and the country is now on the way to global integration. It is necessary for domestic enterprises to learn more from successful foreign businesses, producers and markets, so as to increase productivity and develop a trademark with a deep impression, stable quality and attractive appearance.   I think I am actually jealous of a person who just hasn't been exposed to so many trademarks. In the US and Europe by the time a person is an adult they can certainly identify products and companies by merely seeing the typeface of the logo or a pictoral logo. Is this a sad or an exciting period that the Vietnamese are about to go through? It is difficult to determine the answer to that, although I do know they would probably prefer higher living standards, like anyone else. IP is a vehicle for increased consumerism and profit, hopefully the process of strengthening IP will benefit the people of Vietnam.  I think this article would interest Marty Schwimmer over at  urlLink The Trademark Blog , I'm sure he'd have some interesting thoughts on it.

      Denise Howell of  urlLink Bag and Baggage  fame recently had a very  urlLink interesting article  on  urlLink Law.com  about blogging ongoing trials.  She discusses how blogging trials can be an effective alternate media outlet that is controlled by the client, attorneys, and if the client is really rich (like Martha Swewart style) then also the public relations people.  She also warns that there are major pitfalls to blogging a trial.  It is truly a facinating endeavor.   In the article Denise interviews several hot-stuff attorneys about their experiences with blogging trials.  One of these is New York attorney Robert G. Morvillo, who recently defended Martha Stewart.  He came to one of my ethics classes at Cardozo and spoke to us about the Stewart defense.  I remember him discussing the blog and how useful it had been to get their infomation and spin out there into the media.   The lawyers interviewed say it costs a load to have a trial blogged.  It got me to thinking, any lawyers who want their trial blogged I'll set up a nice looking site for you and put your posts up at a cut rate price compared to those other guys! Hell, I do all this for nada already.  Anyway, go read  urlLink Denise's article , it's great stuff.

      An interesting article recently appeared on the Australian sites  urlLink The Age  and  urlLink SMH , titled  urlLink Intellectual property rights out of tune with public interest  (you can skip past the page that asks you to register).  In the article Ross Gittens argues that it is not in Australia's interests to join "free trade" agreements with the US that force them to adopt American IP law.    First, it's quite a contradiction to be including an increase in the protection given to the owners of IP in an agreement that's claimed to be about free trade. It's about restricting trade, not freeing it up.   About the "Yanks," Gittens notes:   They weren't much interested in protecting other countries' IP rights in the 19th century when they were using a lot of European IP to develop their economy but now they're hot against the evil of pinching other people's IP. Now being a poor developing country is no excuse.   Also:  ...tricks such as regional coding and prohibitions on parallel imports simply permit IP owners to engage in price discrimination - charging more in some markets than others.  And there's a long and sorry history of firms manipulating IP protections so as to stifle the creativity of their rivals. How's that in [Australia's] public interest?   It's an interesting article and a quick read, go check it out.

       urlLink      Big media outlets are getting their word in now on the  urlLink JibJab video  situation. Here's a solid  urlLink WIRED  story, a piece in  urlLink Reason.com  (that links me),&nbsp;and a short piece in  urlLink Newsday .   We already knew that the JibJab guys had  urlLink contacted the EFF  for help in the matter after receiving a cease & desist letter (C&amp;D)  urlLink [C&D - PDF]  from the copyright owners in the original Woody Guthrie song "This Land is our Land." Now the EFF has gone a step further by sending out a response  urlLink [EFF response - PDF]  discussing why they think the JibJab video is a parody. The discussions in both letters are informative as to the law of parody, they're only 4 pages each.   I must say, even though several commentators have agreed with me that the JibJab video is a satire, including  urlLink Lawrence   urlLink Lessig , I am having doubts about my original position based on the history of the song that interested bloggers and commentors have turned up. I don't know if I'm ready to be labeled a total "flip-flopper" yet, but my thoughts on the parodic nature of the video have shifted based on all the new information that's been dug up.   As I have noted  urlLink several   urlLink times  in the past, a work that contains both elements of satire and parody should still be considered a parody. Therefore, if the Jib Jab video is a  satirical  look at the current presidential election between Bush and Kerry, but also a  parody  of the meaning of Guthrie's song, then the presentation as a whole should be protected under the fair use doctrine of the copyright law and the  Campbell v. Acuff-Rose  case.   Here's my beef with the parody argument though: it reeks of post hoc reasoning (after the fact) that I am inclined to think is a little over the top. What I mean is that I seriously doubt the JibJab guys were sitting around thinking this as they authored their video (excerpt taken from the EFF letter):     "While [the copyright owner's] view of Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land" [is] predominantly about "the beauty of the American landscape" and "the disenfranchisement of the underclass" ... most Americans think of the song as an iconic expression of the ideal of national unity. [Our] parody addresses, among other things, the lack of national unity that characterizes our current political climate ([and ends] with the optimistic hope that unity might be rediscovered)."    In the comments on  urlLink this post  Ernest Miller suggests it does not matter what the artist was thinking and that the complicated reasons why artists do what they do is not an issue in a parody finding. I agree with him to some extent and so does the US Supreme Court, just look at the  Acuff-Rose  case. I seriously doubt that 2 Live Crew was thinking along the lines described in the  Campbell v. Acuff-Rose  opinion when they wrote "Pretty Woman."&nbsp; The Supreme Court in  Campbell v. Acuff-Rose  states:     "2 Live Crew juxtaposes the romantic musings of a man whose fantasy comes true with degrading taunts, a bawdy demand for sex, and a sigh of relief from paternal responsibility. The later words can be taken as a comment on the naivete of the original of an earlier day, as a rejection of its sentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life and the debasement that it signifies."   This paragraph as written by the Sup. Ct. is more lyrical than the song it describes, I don't think the members of 2 Live Crew are capable of such thought (and believe it or not I have met them, my opinion is based on personal experience).&nbsp; It is apparent that post hoc reasoning is acceptable and even necessary in these cases since artists do not record their thoughts as they work.&nbsp; But&nbsp;post hoc reasoning&nbsp;still sounds suspicious to some people (or courts).   Ultimately, because of my own suspicions about the post hoc reasoning I am left wondering if the JibJab guys actually used "This Land is our Land" because of it's history and meaning or just because it is a familiar tune with a refrain that worked well for their video...period.   To&nbsp; suggests the work is a parody&nbsp;one must take the position that the Jib Jab&nbsp;team knew the history and meaning of the song when making their video, even if that knowledge was some sort of background psychology at work in their heads at the time. The truth is that at this point it no longer matters because we can never know what they were thinking when making the video and therefore must assume for them a legal 'best-case scenario.'   The four factor parody inquiry is essentially an objective one because it utilizes this post hoc reasoning - the best stuff your attorney can come up with after the fact. But actually this appears to be an attempt to get at a very subjective question: just what was the author thinking when doing the work, even if the thoughts were in the background or subconscious.&nbsp; In the end what the author was thinking really can be irrelevant to the the legal finding.   In light of the newly dug up information on the history of the song and because the parody inquiry requires objective post hoc reasoning as to the authors intent in creating the work, I believe I have to change my opinion on the matter and give the JibJab guys the benefit of the doubt in this case and assume that they made the video with parody 'in mind' (even if in some deep recess of their mind). I still maintain my doubt as to their subjective intent in making the video, they may well have chosen "This Land is My Land" merely because it had a familiar tune and a convenient refrain.   Anyone have an opinion on this discussion?   [Note: My  urlLink original post  on this matter, linked to on  urlLink Slashdot  and  urlLink The Importance of... &nbsp;among others, is  urlLink here .]

In the article Lessig argues that copyright law is keeping the public from hearing important messages from politicians, including the US president, because the private news companies that record interviews and press conferences refuse to allow others to use the footage even though what the president says in public really shoundn't be copyrightable.  It's a quick and interesting read.

       urlLink    urlLink    Examples of pics available on P2P nets.   Ernest over at  urlLink The Importance of  points out this interesting  urlLink CNet article  about a new blog called " urlLink See What You Share On P2P ."  The purpose of the blog, so the owner says, is to demonstrate the danger posed to national security by P2P nets.  The author of the blog has posted some fairly sensitive material he found on P2P nets, including secret military documents (with names and numbers blacked out).    The author of "See What You Share" states that:   "Technology often outruns legislation. So is the case with Peer 2 Peer networks. Many people obtain P2P software so they can download music or movies. A large number of those people do not have any idea what they are sharing." As Ernest points out in  urlLink his post , the technology outrunning legislation is not really the problem.  The problem is one of security, a problem with   users  .    This is the typical situation where the technology and not the user get the blame for security problems.  It's the same situation with spam, spyware, and viruses.  These problems are (easily) avoidable, but it depends on the users' education about the problems.  For instance, many of us know  never  to put a hyperlink to our email addresses online b/c it will be crawled by a bot and the address spammed, but many people still don't know that.  There are also plenty of ways to avoid getting spyware, like stop downloading freeware smiley face and wallpaper programs and get yourself a spyware killer.  How about viruses?  It's oh so simple, get an antivirus program and set it to update regularly.  Also, don't load suspicious files; and yet people just keep opening those dodgy .TXT attachments in their email.  All the while a little user education could virtually put an end to these Internet ills, but instead everyone uses these problems to push for legislation and more hardcore Internet governance.  Legislation and more governance can't even stop these problems, the perpetrators inevitably  urlLink just go overseas .  The "See what you share" guy refers to legislation, obviously the  urlLink INDUCE Act .  The security problem he is making people aware of is not the fault of the technology though, but our own fault.  He so much as says so in his  urlLink statement of purpose :  "I want everyone to know that we can be our own worst enemies when we dont understand the full power of our technology."

       urlLink    Saw this on  urlLink Slashdot , more  urlLink here :   "The Stargate SG-1 Information Archive is reporting that the Feds filed charges against Adam McGaughey, creator of SG1Archive.com. The website is a fan site for the television show Stargate SG-1. The charges allege that Adam used the website to engage in Criminal Copyright Infringement and Trafficking in Counterfeit Services. Two interesting things about the charges are that they were apparently set in motion by a complaint by our friends at the MPAA and the FBI invoked a provision of the USA Patriot Act to obtain financial records from his ISP. Is copyright infringment now a terrorist act?"  You almost want to feel sorry for this guy.  But then...according to this  urlLink DOJ press release  the site offered downloadable copies of all the episodes of the show.  This  urlLink Google Group link  also indicates that this guy isn't deserving of much sympathy, it seems he's been engaged in some quite dodgy acts including ripping people off on eBay (not that that's relevent to the copyright issues, but still).  I see that  urlLink BoingBoing  has more on this.  Noteworthy is that the comments to the post on Slashdot get around to discussing the INDUCE Act somehow.  I don't know why, but I like the fact that people are thinking about it and are worried about it...because they should be worrying.    By the way, if you see anymore about the Patriot Act thing, drop me a comment with a link to the article, thanks!

      Stephen Nipper, of  urlLink Necessity's Progeny  patent blog fame, points out  urlLink this  flash animation with an iPod ad look. That really is Steve Ballmer sounding like Howard Dean at an Apple company conference. Scary stuff.   This flash animation is a satire, since it uses the iPod ad look to make fun of a person who was not involved with the creation of the iPod or the ads. If the animation targeted the Apple CEO or the iPod itself or something related to the iPod it may have been a parody.   Finally, I'd just like to say: Mr. Ballmer, chill out man, for one you're going to give yourself a coronary and two, no company is that exciting (ok, maybe one that you're making millions from is pretty exciting, but still, calm down before you hurt yourself).

       urlLink     More parody or satire! A great day indeed. Apple is all in a tizzy over these new ads for Fuse, a TV channel. Check out big pics of the offending ads  urlLink here . Frankly, the Fuse ads are much funnier than the iPod version. Although the others are more scandalous, my favorite is the one with beer bong action, I haven't done that since college.   So...the ads do not really seem to target Apple or the iPod specifically, but perhaps they offer some commentary on how banal the iPod ads are.  This is a slightly tougher case that the  urlLink "iRaq" ads , which were obviously satire.    If the Fuse ad pictures were not so funny, I'd be inclined to think that the Fuse ads are neither satire nor parody, but purely an appropriation of Apple's ad style.  Since they are obviously meant to be humorous I'll have to say that this is likely parody because it is obvious that the ads, while functioning as marketing for Fuse, also make a strong point about the boring and banal iPod ads.  After viewing the Fuse ads the iPod ads no longer seem very meaningful, the Fuse ads defuse them, so to speak.  It's a close case.  Apple has a strong argument that the ads do not target them at all.  We'll keep an eye on this and see what happens.  Via  urlLink Gizmodo .

      First watch  urlLink this JibJab.com video  featuring a parody/satire of the song "This Land is My Land" and starring Bush and Kerry, it probably will not be up for long.   The owner of the copyright in the song doesn't think that little video is as funny as you do. The company, The Richmond Organization, is breaking out the lawyers on JibJab.com. Ironically, The Richmond Organization can be shortened to "TRO," which is probably what they are seeking against JibJab at the moment (that's a "temporary restraint order" 'round these parts).   So, as happens at least once a month, we are back to discussing the difference between a parody and a satire. Simply put, a parody targets the original content or creator, for example if the JibJab video targeted how lame the song or it's lyrics are then it would be parody. Satire uses the work to comment on something other than the original content or creator. A work can be a parody if it contains elements of both parody and satire.   The JibJab video would likely be considered satire, because the video does not directly target the original song. The clear target here is Bush and Kerry or politics/society in general. Also, if the video is a commercial use of the song, that will hurt JibJab's case. Commercial use is loosely defined, that the video brings people to a site where there are things offered for sale would be enough.   TRO is upset about the use of the song because apparently:    ...the Jibjab creation threatens to corrupt Guthrie's classic [song] -- an icon of Americana -- by tying it to a political joke; upon hearing the music people would think about the yucks, not Guthrie's unifying message.   Article  urlLink here .   Here's more on the difference between parody and satire: the  urlLink "iRaq"/iPod  ads;  urlLink TV Commercial Jams ;  urlLink parody or satire?        *****UPDATE****  : There's a discussion of my recent "Parody or Satire?" posts over at  urlLink The Importance of... &nbsp; Ernest Miller disgrees with me that the JibJab video is satire, noting that the JibJab version concerning division certainly attacks the meaning of the original, which was a message of unity. But Lawrence Lessig agrees with me  urlLink here , and links to me  urlLink here , thanks Larry!

       urlLink    vs.  urlLink     Time for some fun:   urlLink The great Dr. Raj Baldev  has a complaint against  urlLink Stephen Hawking , that Hawking stole his idea!  Apparently Baldev is considering a copyright claim against Hawking!  (You learn on the first day of copyright class that ideas are not copyrightable, by the way.)  The  urlLink International Reporter , a purported news outlet, reports that Stephen Hawking's recently publicized ideas about black holes are not original to him, but to a Dr. Raj Baldev.  Hawking recently announced to the physics world that he has concluded that matter and information sucked into a black hole is eventually spewed out in a mangled form, as opposed to the former and more interesting idea about the matter being shot into another parallel universe.  This was huge news from Hawking, who has worked on the problem for about 30 years now, and was widely covered in the media, there are article  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  More from Google News  urlLink here .  The International Reporter has published two articles claiming that Dr. Raj Baldev came up with this idea years ago and that Hawking is  urlLink stealing his "copyright"  in the idea.  Apparently Baldev wrote about the same idea in a book called "Two Big Bangs Created the Universe."  The book doesn't seem to be available on Amazon, or anywhere else for that matter.  A  urlLink second article  in the International Reporter also questions the originality of Hawking's idea.    Dr. Raj Baldev has supposedly written this  urlLink mangled article  on black holes (in broken English and also in the International Reporter).     urlLink This page  states: "Dr. Raj Baldev, who is a famous Cosmo Theorist, is also considered an authority in Astrology and occult sciences..."  Hmmmm.  Also, the good doctor has apparently "discerned a plot against Bush,"  urlLink article here  (surprisingly published in the International Reporter).  Basically, this is a bunch of total quacks with too much time on their hands, or maybe even some cult or something.  Anyway, it's pretty funny.  I'll be keeping my eye out for that copyright claim Baldev is going to bring against Hawking, I'm sure the famous cosmologist has a strong case.  Maybe this is something that would interest  urlLink Snopes ?

      The House Judiciary Subcommittee voted 18-9 in favor of the Family Movie Act (a.k.a. the "Clearplay Act").  The FMA still has to go up for a vote in the full House.  There is no similar bill being considered in the Senate at the moment.    Basically, the Family Movie Act will allow people to modify movies as they watch them from DVDs in order to edit out the "bad" parts.  The main company behind the whole situation is the Utah based Clearplay, which sell special DVD players that skip over the naughty bits of movies.  Although the idea sounds like some sort of censorship by choice, or just a kind of religion-driven bit of silliness; the important point that the FMA makes is that people can use the media they purchase however they want to.  That is considered by many to be a good thing for all consumers.  Of course copyright holders do not like consumers being able to manipulate their media because, understandably, they want to retain control of how content is used even after it's purchase.    ClearPlay is currently involved in a law suit with several Hollywood directors and industry groups, the case is called  urlLink Huntsman v. Soderbergh .   The measure's author, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the legislation guarantees that parents will be free to use technology to protect what children watch. He compared skipping objectionable scenes in a movie to skipping paragraphs in a book.  "Parents should have a right to show any movie they want and skip or mute any content they find objectionable," Smith said.  ... Critics of the bill argued that it is aimed at helping one company, Utah-based ClearPlay Inc., whose technology is used in some DVD players to help parents filter inappropriate material by muting dialogue or skipping scenes. ClearPlay sells filters for hundreds of movies that can be added to such DVD players for $4.95 each month ... Hollywood executives have complained that ClearPlay's technology represents unauthorized editing of their movies. They maintain that ClearPlay should pay them licensing fees for altering their creative efforts.  Article quoted from  urlLink here .  ClearPlay's site  urlLink here .  Background on the situation  urlLink here .  The legal briefs and press releases from the ClearPlay case are available from the EFF  urlLink here .

      CNN has  urlLink more  on the recently filed lawsuit over "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" song (Ah-weem-a-way Ah-weem-a-way).  The family of the woman who wrote the song appears to be relying on moral rights laws to claim that they still own the song despite the fact that the writer sold it.     The song, popularized in the long-running theater production and cartoon movie "The Lion King" was originally written in 1939 by Solomon Linda, a Zulu migrant worker turned songwriter.  The writer died penniless in 1962.  Her family now lives in poverty in the infamous Soweto neighborhood in Johannesburg.     The song has been covered by at least 150 artists, including The Tokens, George Michael, Miriam Makeba and The Spinners.  Linda's three surviving daughters and 10 grandchildren, living in poverty in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, have received only a one-time payment of $15,000.  When you consider the condition of the family, you sort of hope Disney will just take a small hit and settle.  The suit is for $1.5 million, but I bet the family would take a whole lot less to settle, considering they are dirt poor.   urlLink Soweto  is not a place you'd want to go on vacation (if you wanted to relax anyway).   urlLink Soweto  is a neighborhood where poor black miners were forced to live during apartheid, it is still pretty rough.

       urlLink     I am ashamed to learn that  urlLink Hillary Clinton , my NY rep in the Senate, has become a co-sponsor of the INDUCE Act (now IICA).  Hillary Clinton has received  urlLink $1,100,390  from Hollywood in the past.    This really feels like a blatant sell out to me, Hollywood/media money vs. technological innovation and consumer 'rights'.  I wonder if Clinton even knows more than a few blurbs or soundbites about the bill?  I really don't see how the INDUCE Act is supportable by an intellectually honest and informed person.  I like Clinton for the most part, but after this I am much more skeptical of her motives in politics.  Too bad.  There are currently nine co-sponsors for the INDUCE Act.    Learn more at  urlLink The Importance Of... , Ernest Miller has been doing lots of wonderful posts about IICA there.

      There's a terrific and strongly worded  urlLink op-ed piece  concerning the  urlLink Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act  in the Kansas City Star ("that's what I are," sorry that's a private joke between me and whoever else knows the song).     To restore the balance between consumer rights and copyrights, the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act, HR 107, has been introduced in Congress. It ensures that consumers can use DVDs and CDs in ways protected by traditional copyright laws - where consumers decide where and how they view their legally purchased content. Not surprisingly, the entertainment industry that pushed through the copyright act is aggressively opposing HR 107 ... If HR 107 sounds like simple common sense, that's because it is. It is consumers who are driving the digital transition, and it is their rights that must be protected. The digital revolution is a revolution precisely because it allows consumers to enjoy more and higher-quality content, but Hollywood wants to turn back the clock and stop the progress.  After reading the op-ed maybe you'll be inclined to support the DMCRA  urlLink here , it takes all of 1 minute to send a letter to your rep.   urlLink Public Knowledge  has more on the DMCRA.  The op-ed is by  urlLink Mark Cooper , the director of research with the  urlLink Consumer Federation of America ,  urlLink article here .

      A major software industry group may have released a bogus piracy study in order to support passage of the INDUCE Act.  While these sort of studies are typically self serving, this new one claims that there is $29 billion dollars of software piracy going on yearly.  In previous studies the same group claimed that there was $13 billion in yearly losses due to software piracy.     [A] study released two weeks ago by the Business Software Alliance ... estimated the yearly losses from software piracy at $29 billion worldwide ... The trade group's previous estimate of software piracy losses was $13 billion a year.  Microsoft is a leading supporter of the Business Software Alliance.  Better news is that:   More than 40 companies and organizations - ranging from Intel, Google and Verizon to the American Library Association - wrote to [Senator] Hatch on July 7, expressing concern that the bill would touch off a wave of copyright suits and would chill innovation. They requested a hearing on the bill before Congress proceeded any further.    There is a hearing scheduled for Thursday I believe.  Of course it is hardly a full blown hearing.  It'll consist of the Judiciary Committe support and the Industry groups all making speeches about how the INDUCE Act is needed in order to protect them from Kazaa.  We'll see how much true debate there is and what they say about legal standards of intent and so on.    International Herald Tribune article  urlLink here .

       urlLink     An  urlLink Elvis  song called " urlLink That's Allright " is going to enter the  urlLink public domain  on Jan 1st, 2005 in&nbsp;Britain.&nbsp; The song was recently rereleased in&nbsp;Britain and is currently, for some reason, in the top 5 of the  urlLink Brit charts .&nbsp;&nbsp;    In the United States, BMG will continue to own the rights to the recording. Under the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, sound recordings are protected for 95 years from the day of recording in the United States -- for post-1976 recordings, coverage is the artist's life plus 70 years.&nbsp; In most of the European Union, the duration is 50 years after the first release of a sound recording. Record companies are calling this Elvis situation a "wakeup call"&nbsp;for EU lawmakers, arguing that they need to extend copyright as occured in the US with the Copyright Term Extension Act.&nbsp; Of course, since anything that falls into the public domain becomes the property of the people, this would amount to a massive wealth transfer from the populace of the entire EU to the recording companies (as it was here in the US when the CTEA passed).    "I regard this week's anniversary as a wakeup call and a call to arms to step up a gear or two in our campaign to lobby for a similar term in the EU," said Peter Jamieson, executive chairman of British Phonograph Industry, in a recent speech.    It would be a shame if such an act passed in the EU, as it was here.&nbsp; The fact is that all creative works are based on what came before.&nbsp; Without access to the works of the past artists and regular people are limited in what they can do with the works and how they can use them.&nbsp; Extending copyright terms impacts negatively on&nbsp;artistic innovation in music, writing, painting, photography, etc.&nbsp;   When a company produces a copyrighted work and are granted state sponsored copyright protection for the life of the author of the work&nbsp;plus 50 or more years, that company&nbsp;has also made an agreement with the public - that at the end of the copyright term they will turn that work over to them via the public domain.&nbsp; The work was protected by the state, later it goes to the populace of that state.&nbsp; Companies that are trying to extend their copyrights at the last second are renigging on that promise.&nbsp; I'm no idealist, this effort isn't surprising considering the money at stake, but I hope that courts will consider such reasoning when hearing these cases.&nbsp;   The fact is that at the time protection is granted the creator has already agreed to a time limit for that protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lengthening that protection will not encourage more creation, it only stifles innovation.&nbsp; There is not a single artist out there who would decide to stop creating because they'll get only 50 years of protection after their death instead of 70.&nbsp; It's ludicrus in light of the  purpose  of copyright law - to encourage innovation and creation by protecting the works for a limited time.

       urlLink      urlLink    Allow me to preface this post by stating that I really don't give a crap about Britney Spears or what she drinks...that said...  &nbsp;  I've described the  urlLink New York Post  as a  urlLink right-leaning scandal rag  in the past (and also  urlLink The Washington Times , which is no better - and is still running the "10 out of 10 terrorists agree anybody but Bush" ad on it's home page, if you don't know what I mean  urlLink click here ).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Proving me right yet again, yesterday the NY Post ran a huge picture on the front page of the paper of what they purported was Britney Spears drinking liquor from one of those mini bottles.&nbsp; Why this would even be interesting to anyone&nbsp;if it  were  true I do not know.&nbsp; As it turns out&nbsp;the drink was not liquor.&nbsp; Spears even has&nbsp;the&nbsp;guy who rang her up at the store on her side, saying he&nbsp;sold her a little bottle of ginseng.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This comes only a week after the NY Post got an " urlLink exclusive " on Kerry's pick for running mate -   urlLink Gephardt  , oops.&nbsp; They keep screwing up because all they care about is being the first with the story, true or not.&nbsp; They really are no better than the&nbsp;Drudge Report (which, incidentally, is also running the " urlLink 10 out of 10 terrorists agree " ad).&nbsp; This time it looks like&nbsp;the NY&nbsp;Post's screw-up&nbsp;may cost them a  urlLink money&nbsp;settlement  with Spears.  &nbsp;  I used to get the NY Post on occasion because it is only 25 cents and is definitely easy reading on a lunch break.&nbsp; I've since sworn it off and I feel much more intelligent for it.&nbsp; When you read the NY Post you can feel your brain cells melting down, probably much the same as you would feel watching  urlLink Fox   urlLink News , which incidentally is owned by the same right wing media baron, Rupert Murdoch.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Here's the  urlLink NY Daily News  on the  urlLink Spears incident &nbsp;(they're always happy to point out the NY Post's failings), and here's one of many stories on the Kerry  urlLink running mate flap .&nbsp; I also found an article in the  urlLink Investor's Business Daily  entitled: " urlLink The New York Post is becoming a bad joke ," unfortunately the article isn't there anymore.&nbsp; I think that title does just about sum it up though.&nbsp; If the NY Post were even 50 cents I think the NY Daily News (being 50 cents) would wipe it out (or if the Daily News were 25 cents).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The NY Post, Wash Times, Fox News, and the&nbsp;Drudge Report are all peas of the same pod.&nbsp; They aren't just trashy, they're misreporting the truth.&nbsp; It isn't such a problem when it concerns what Britney is drinking, but obviously when it comes to reporting important things like War, it can be a  urlLink problem  when half the country is getting  urlLink misinformation .

      According to this PC World  urlLink article , things are looking good for the passage of the  urlLink Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act .&nbsp; David Green, the VP of the MPAA claims that the DMCRA:     "...would 'put a hole in the ship,' Green says, by allowing the creation of devices or technologies that have significant copyright-infringing uses. The explosion of digital content available in the last six years is due to the protections of the DMCA, he says."  I guess Green forgot that the  Betamax  decision and the fair use provisions of the Copyright Act already give people the right to create technology with significant infringing uses.&nbsp; Also, I could have sworn the reason that there has been an explosion of digital content in the last six years was not because of the DMCA, but because of the DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, like the Internet (and also because&nbsp;digital content providers are raking in tons of loot).  &nbsp;  Thank god for the DMCA, without it all the digital content providers would probably just...keep producing digital content and raking in tons of loot.  &nbsp;  It is a shame that the MPAA and other media groups are so short sighted.&nbsp; They would love nothing more than to just freeze technological development.&nbsp; In the long-run of course, they have much to gain from the advancement of digital media technology - as they did with the VCR, which they were scared silly of too.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This killing off of technological innovation is the major goal of the Induce Act as well, which by the way, has been fast tracked in the Senate and may be voted on as early as this Thursday.&nbsp; Find out more and send&nbsp;petitions to your representatives&nbsp; urlLink here , New Yorkers go  urlLink here  for more.  &nbsp; It seriously takes all of a minute to send an email to your representatives about the Induce Act via the  urlLink EFF website .&nbsp;  urlLink Go, give it a whirl .

      Hew Raymond Griffiths, a "warez" pirate, may be the first Aussie to be extradited to the US to face copyright infringement charges.     US authorities allege he was the ringleader of an Internet group, "DrinkOrDie," which illegally copied and distributed more than US$50mil (RM190mil) worth of pirated software, movies, games and music before investigators shut down the group in 2001. ...   DrinkOrDie was part of the so-called "warez" scene in which participants known as suppliers obtain access to copyrighted software, videogames, movies and music files, often before the titles are available to the public.   Other participants known as "crackers" use their technical skills to "crack" the copyright protection, while others known as "couriers" distribute the pirated software to various fileservers on the Internet.   The group, founded in Moscow in 1993, gained worldwide notoriety when it released a pirated version of the Windows 95 operating system two weeks before it was released by Microsoft.   Hew faces a 500 grand fine and 10 years in prison, I bet he'll get every day of those 10 years too.  Ouch.  Here's an article entitled " urlLink Wanted: for long-distance geekiness ."  The article notes that the 41 year old Hew lives with his parents.  Apparently being the ringleader of huge international warez crews isn't a particularly profitable enterprise. Here's a Wikipedia entry about  urlLink DrinkOrDie .  Here's a  urlLink Slashdot interview  with a member of DoD.  Article cited from  urlLink here .

       urlLink     The  urlLink Town of   urlLink Hillsborough , North Carolina is going to "copyright" it's town logo, according to  urlLink this article .  Most probably this is an example of a writer who didn't even bother to look up the difference between copyright and trademark.  The logo is more likely to be trademarked as a designation of source, not copyrighted as an original creative work (it may not even be copyrightable).  Anyway, the town logo is of an old clock.  The town's boardmembers recently made the decision to exercise control over their brand, stating:   "For $35, it's kind of a no-brainer to do. For $35, why not have some sort of control over it? If it's our brand, the town brand, then we should be able to have some sort of legal control over it." ...  "I don't think there's anybody misusing it," he said. "It's just something, I feel like, something we should do."   Yeah, why not?  All this for only $35, that's 7 easy payments of $5!  And not only that, we'll also send you a blog post featuring YOUR TOWN absolutely FREE!  Hurry folks!  Call now before someone steals your town name!

       urlLink     While we in the US (mostly) debate the advantages and disadvantages of using  urlLink RFID chips  on people, a debate which essentially boils down to security vs. privacy, other countries and individuals are embracing them.    In Osaka, Japan the school system is going to  urlLink attach RFID chips   urlLink to the kid's  bags and clothes in order to track them.  In Mexico the Attorney General and other government officials are having RFID chips  urlLink implanted in their arms  in order to allow them to be tracked if they are  abducted.     Mexico's attorney general said on Monday he had a microchip inserted under the skin of one of his arms to give him access to a new crime database and also enable him to be traced if he is ever abducted.  Meanwhile, in Boca Raton, Florida, the school system has decided to  urlLink use hand scanners  to ID students.  The new Don Estridge High Tech Middle School will have hand scanners in "all 61 classrooms, the cafeteria, main office and media center."  Apparently there are also several schools in Palm Beach County, FL also have video surveillance cameras in the classrooms.  Dam, sounds like the Pentagon or something.  Hand scanners are also used at 18 schools in Akron, Ohio, the Johnson & Wales University campus in Denver, and Diebold (the voting machine makers)  urlLink has installed   urlLink hand scanners  at West Virginia University residence hall, among others.    As could be guessed, at this early stage in the use of handscanners, they are being donated by a company that probably expects sales to schools in the future.  Get 'em hooked pusherman, those teachers won't even know how to take attendance manually sooner or later.  Apparently at least two kids "are telling everyone about it. They think it's so high-tech, so FBI, so cool."  I don't think these stories relate in a particularly profound way, but they certainly point to changing attitudes worldwide when it comes to allowing what many people would consider an invasion of their (or their children's) privacy.  Thanks to  urlLink Tom Thinks  for pointing  urlLink this  out.

       urlLink      urlLink Afrotech  (interesting name...) has discovered the Super Megason IV gaming system at a store near his place in Bahrain.  Since this is an 8 bit system, like the old Nintendo, I wonder what the first 3 incarnations of the Megason were like.  Anyway, this is a great example of this interesting new trend I've been noticing on the streets of New York City, that's right, it isn't only happening in Bahrain!    Now that the components of such low-power computer systems are incredibly cheap, some pirate/hackers/companies out there are mass producing them and including a whole slew of old Nintendo games along with the hardware.  In this case the many games come on a single cartridge (even though it looks in the picture like the Megason takes a CD), but there are some similar devices for sale on the streets of NYC that have all the games built right into the firmware inside the controller!  Isn't that snazzy!  I have a friend who recently picked on of these up for $10, so maybe I'll post some pics eventually.    If you're reminiscing and want to get your Super Mario and Duck Hunt on, this is the way to go these days...that is, if you don't mind totally violating countless copyrights doing so.  Here's an overly sarcastic look at the Super Megason on  urlLink Joystiq .  Via  urlLink Joystiq  and  urlLink Afrotech .

      I am really loving  urlLink The Importance Of...  today.  See what happens when you go away for a few days?  All these interesting things go on.    Anyway, here's  urlLink another post  that just shocks, yes shocks me.  Apparently book publishers would really love to strip us of our rights under the First Sale Doctrine.  In copyright law, that is what allows you to sell your used media if it is copyrighted and the material is owned by someone else.  It is the reason you can sell your used books and cds at thrift shops, used bookstores, and online.  Yes, there really is a special statute for theses things you take for granted.    The NYT writes in  urlLink this article  that Amazon dot com's used book section has made it so efficient to sell used books that it is the new "Napster of the book selling business."  What a crock, the analogy doesn't work for so many reasons.    Personally, I don't feel sorry for the publishers.  They've been charging me hundreds of dollars per semester for their textbooks which they put out "new editions" of every other year just to keep (poor and broke) students like me from buying them used.  For more on students pirating textbooks  urlLink see here .  Via  urlLink The Importance Of... , more at  urlLink LawMeme .

      Classic - a guy selling pirated DVDs walks into one of Britian's "Trading Standards Office" offices without knowing where he is and asks the workers if they're interested in buying some pirated DVDs.  As you can imagine, they were quite interested.  The moron was arrested after figuring out where he was and running off.     Peter Martin, Essex County Council's cabinet member in charge of Trading Standards, said: "It would be great if all pushers of counterfeit goods would come to our offices to try and sell their wares. It would make the life of our dedicated team a great deal easier."    urlLink Article in the BBC .

      Ernest at  urlLink The Importance of...  has this topic completely covered.  Basically, after FOX sued over the title of Al Franken's "Lies and the Lying Liars..." book and was laughed out of court one would want to be careful when using the litigious FOX's material.   urlLink This post  is a good look at the issues involved.  Luckily for the producers of OutFOXed they had  urlLink Larry Lessig  and other copyright mavens to assist them in making their film infringement free and full of fair use.  See a clip of OutFOXed  urlLink here .  There are more clips to be seen at the  urlLink OutFOXed homepage  as well.

Update  : I just noticed this more  urlLink recent post  at  urlLink The Importance Of... , apparently FOX is already threatening to sue over the film and were very pissed off about that NYT Magazine article linked to above.  More articles:   urlLink Film Calls Fox News Biased, Channel Cries Foul   urlLink Fox Fights Back Against 'NY Times' Over Film Story    FOX is claiming that this is all illegal infringement that is being supported by the NYT and "liberal billionare" George Soros (inducement to infringe perhaps?).

      Ok, so it's been popular forever.  But Wired has recently done a few stories about Mozilla that has got me thinking I need this program (I just downloaded it).  Mozilla/Firefox is an open source browser that can be used on PC or Mac as an alternative to Netscape, Internet Explorer, or whatever it is that Macs use.  It is apparently much more secure than other mainstream (PC) browsers, most malware is written for IE.  Also, there is are a group of extensions for Mozilla called Firefox that allow the user to do some pretty cool stuff, like block all those annoying flash ads and blinking jpeg ads on websites, as well as pop ups and so on.  Anyway, I don't know much about it yet, but I am going to give it all a whirl.

      Sometimes life is too bizarre, or perhaps it was predictable that there would be a bail bondsman out there named Kerry Edwards who would've registered  urlLink Kerryedwards.com  and posted pics of his family on the site.  If this guy had no legitimate right to the site name then a quick UDRP proceeding could have been the solution for John Kerry's campaign.  But because the guy's name is actually Kerry Edwards the site name will have to be purchased from him.  The site looks so crappy you have to wonder if they didn't just buy it up for this purpose and throw some pics on it, that doesn't really matter anymore though (according to  urlLink ALoTTFMA  the site was registered several years ago).    In a  urlLink CNN interview  Kerry Edwards says he's been contacted by several "international companies" looking to buy the site and that he didn't even know the identities of some of the potential buyers who were making offers.  The highest offer so far is $150,000, but it sounds like Kerry Edwards is looking for five figures.  John Kerry's campaign has called him as well, but apparently aren't offering much.  One may wonder why Kerry Edwards, a Democrat, wouldn't just give it to the John Kerry campaign for a "reasonable" price.  But seriously, John Kerry's campaign has around $200 million last I checked, and John Kerry himself is sitting on another couple hundred mill at home.  I don't blame Kerry Edwards one bit for telling John Kerry to shove it.  I would do the same thing in his spot.  I am really nervous for Kerry Edwards though, I think he better sell that site very soon.  John Kerry will no doubt register something like "kerryedwards04.com" or "kerryedwards2004.com."  The hype surrounding the Kerryedwards.com site name could easily be gone within days, we'll see what happens.  I say take the money and run Kerry Edwards!  Via  urlLink Tech Law Advisor .

       urlLink     I just have to point out this ad that is running on the front page of the  urlLink Washington Times  website for "Authentic GOP dot com."  They sell t-shirts that read "10 out of 10 terrorists agree anybody but Bush."  On their website they ask, "after all, whom would Osama vote for?"  Frankly I am surprised that any paper would run such an ad.  I guess the Washington Times is like the  urlLink New York Post  though, pretty much a scandal rag that leans to the right.  For instance check out  urlLink this  article by the editor-in-chief of the paper about how Kerry and Edwards "lock eyes frequently in deep contact and stop barely short of demonstrating what great kissers they may be."  The headline on the NY Post site is about how Whoopi insulted Bush at a Dem fundraiser  Ah, a quick search is revealing: The Washington Times is owned by "Moonie" cult leader  urlLink Rev.

      Check out this amazing new site (still in Beta) called  urlLink Copyscape .  You enter your site address into Copyscape and it tracks down all the sites on the web that have copied your content!  The program is really amazing and is made by the same people that created  urlLink Google Alert .    When I entered my site into Copyscape, there were 15 entries, most of which were due to quotes I had taken from news sources (Copyscape will show you what you have copied as well as what others have copied from you).  The most common phrase that turned up for me was "The photos often depicted Barbie dolls placed in sexually provocative positions."  This quote comes from a recent post entitled  urlLink "Mattel gets nailed" .  I took the quote from a news story, which is linked to in the post.

       urlLink     I have been getting lots of hits based on searches of "iPod vs. DJ."  Below is a list of posts on the subject.  The basics go like this - a Dell DJ of the same capacity as an iPod (15 or 20 gigs) has much better battery power (nearly double Dell says) and is over $100 cheaper.  The DJ also plays WMA files, which the iPod cannot (although the iPod plays AAC [an Apple format], which the DJ does not), both play MP3s of course.    My own experience is that iPods are very problematic, mine regularly wipes its memory and needs its OS reloaded multiple times in a row.  Also, if you own a PC you can't charge the iPod while it is plugged into the computer (unlike with Apples) so you can only load part of your playlist at a time between recharges (if it dies during an upload prepare to reload the OS again).  Also, the battery on my iPod dies after only a few hours of use (and yes, I've turned off all the battery draining options like the light and equalizer, etc.).  Basically, if you buy the iPod you are paying for Apple's marketing campaign but getting less in terms of technology.  I think Dell should be paying me to say anymore on this topic, so I think I'll end it here (until I get a DJ, at which point I will review it).    Here are posts you may want to check out:  urlLink iPod vs. Dell DJ    urlLink iTunes selling low sound quality MP3s   urlLink problems with the iPod minis plus anti-iPod rant   urlLink The BBC notes that the iPod is a piece of crap    urlLink Save the iPod dot com    If you don't know about Congress' recently introduced INDUCE Act, which may make hard-drive based MP3 players illegal, but want to know more see here:  urlLink Hang onto your iPods: Here comes Orrin Hatch    urlLink INDUCE Act inducing me to do lots of research    urlLink INDUCE Act induces journalists to write some good articles

       urlLink     I had one of these many years ago in college, it was impossible to get used to.  Unless you have perfect typing form and never peck at keys it just will not work for you.  My sister solved my problems with the keyboard by pouring a Coke into it and then buying me a new "non-ergo" keyboard.    Anyway, Microsoft is currently battling a company called TypeRight Keyboard Corp. in an attempt to invalidate their patent on the keyboard and avoid paying them a licensing fee.     Microsoft in June 2000 won a motion to invalidate the patents. The company argued that the concept of ergonomic keyboards predated TypeRight's patents. Evidence that was presented consisted of an undated document from a German company, Marquardt GmbH, and testimony from paid fact witnesses.  On Tuesday (4 years later), the Court of Appeals in DC just got around to overturing the invalidation because Microsoft's evidence is shakey.  The case will now head back to the district court in San Diego.  Maybe they'll finish this one off by the time computers don't even come with keyboards anymore, but instead a direct connection to a person's nervous system through a plug in their neck that hooks up to their spinal cord.  That would be cool huh?  Article about the keyboard battle  urlLink here .

Actually, they will retain their patent rights until the appeal is over.     Foreign drug companies have been watching the case as a test of China's commitment to intellectual property rights. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Josette Shiner in November called the Viagra patent challenge a "particularly troubling" example of a questionable Chinese commitment to intellectual property rights...Nonetheless, Damond didn't want to attach too much significance to the event. He said the industry's main concern in China is counterfeiting.   China's commitment to IP?  What commitment?  China (and Russia) are the worst countries when it comes to protecting IP.  And really, who can blame them - why would they use their limited resources to protect our companies' IP rights.  It isn't that China couldn't do more, they have the resources (whereas Russia probably does not).  But why would China protect our IP at the cost of their own developing economy?  They wouldn't, of course.  Article about the Viagra patent  urlLink here .

      Everyone knows that the MP3 file type popularized music downloading and CD ripping because it is a compressed version of the original, meaning you can fit lots of them on your harddrive or download them quickly.  Compression is a fact of life when it comes to music being used on a computer, because of current bandwidth and harddrive limitations.  This doesn't bother most people, certainly when you rip a CD you can set the program that is doing the ripping to record the songs at a bit rate that is high enough that the average listener can't tell the difference between the CD and the MP3.  However, if you buy the MP3s from iTunes it may be so low quality that the difference is audible.   Customers [of iTunes] are led to believe that they are getting a CD in all respects except the trouble of going to the mall. The iTunes store does not warn about the permanence of its method of compression; once freeze-dried, there is no way to reconstitute the music into CD quality for playing through a good stereo.  Ah, for simpler times, when we never had reason to look up the bit rate at which music is digitally sampled for CD's: 1,378 kilobits per second. The bit rate for iTunes, 128, is so low that when played side by side against the original, the difference is audible not only to audio enthusiasts, but also to mortals with ordinary hearing. Wes Phillips, contributing editor at Stereophile, says "128 is like an eight-track," and he describes the combination of iPod and iTunes as "buying a 21st-century device to live in the 1970's."  So, if you plan to use the music you buy from iTunes on your home stereo instead of the tinny earbuds you get with the iPod, it may well sound like crap.   urlLink Tech Law Advisor  thinks this sounds like the litigation over the  urlLink PC harddrive size claims , that it is nitpicky and ridiculous.  I have to disagree, I play my music on various systems, and although I'm no audiophile, if I buy MP3s from iTunes then I want ones that sound decent at least.  Bringing a lawsuit over this would probably be frivolous though.  I have never purchased from iTunes, if you have let me know what you think of the sound quality.  NYT article  urlLink here .

      Something that has always been missing from the disscussion of P2P filesharing and the effect it has on the music industry is how it actually effects the artists themselves.  Recording companies know that the public is going to have very little sympathy for them, as corporations that make hundreds of millions or billions of dollars charging $20 a pop for (often crappy) CDs.  Typically the music industry trots out it's artists who it claims are really getting shafted.  This is probably true for groups like Metallica and Madonna, since they own their own labels and have been around for so long that they have completed their original contracts and renegotiated them.    The fact is though, that most music artists make only pennies for each CD sale.  Artists really make the vast majority of their pay from concerts.  The LA Times has an article today about how the Mexican music industry has been especially hard hit by piracy, Mexico now ranks #3 in the world for piracy sales, behind only China and Russia.  Some labels have even been letting go of popular groups because they aren't making money on CDs anymore.    The very popular Mexican group El Tri is one such group.  But, they say:   ...the band's main source of income has always come from performing about 250 live shows a year, something that even Mexico's powerful pirates can't take away.   "The commercial [recording industry] may disappear," said Lora, whose group recently celebrated 35 years together. "But we're going to keep rocking."   So, I am not a proponent of copying music illegally but I always look with suspicion when artists themselves say they are losing money because of piracy.  For the most part that just isn't true.  What the recording companies provide for these groups is marketing and distribution, and they are the big losers from pirating, not the bands.  LA Times article  urlLink here .

       urlLink Here  is a New York Times article on US v. Councilman.   The case in Boston involved an online bookseller, now called Alibris. In 1998, the company offered e-mail accounts to book dealers and, hoping to gain market advantage, secretly copied messages they received from Amazon.com. In 1999, Alibris and one employee pleaded guilty to criminal wiretapping charges.   But a supervisor, Bradford C. Councilman, fought the charges, saying he did not know about the scheme. He also moved to have the case dismissed on the ground that the wiretapping law did not apply. He argued that because the messages had been on the hard drive of Alibris's computer while they were being processed for delivery, they counted as stored communication. The wiretap law bans a company from monitoring the communications of its customers, except in a few cases. But it does not ban a company from reading customers' stored communications.   "Congress recognized that any time you store communication, there is an inherent loss of privacy," said Mr. Councilman's lawyer, Andrew Good of Good & Cormier in Boston.  In 2003, a federal district court in Boston agreed with Mr. Councilman's interpretation of the wiretap law and dismissed the case. Last week, the First Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-1 decision, affirmed that decision.

      Yesterday I did a  urlLink post  on the recent  U.S. v. Councilman  decision in the First Circ. in which the court ruled that ISPs could intercept and read users' emails.    Even the New York Times thought the decision was worthy of a  urlLink scathing op-ed piece , which appeared today.   Count us among the shocked. The decision, on a 2-to-1 vote by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Massachusetts, sets up a frightening precedent, one that must be reversed by the courts, if not the Congress. It's true that people are aware of some limits on online privacy, particularly in the workplace. But the notion that a company like America Online, essentially a common carrier, has the right to read private e-mail is ludicrous.   Americans' right to privacy will be seriously eroded if e-mail is not protected by wiretap laws. The implications of this erosion extend beyond the commercial realm. The government will also find it easier to read your e-mail if it does not have to get a wiretap order to do so. Congress ought to update the law to make it clear that e-mail is entitled to the same protection as a phone call.   I find the strong reaction to the  Councilman  ruling odd based on the fact that this result was completely predictable based on former interpretations of the Wiretap Act in  Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service .  There the court held that the Wiretap Act does not apply to electronic communications in storage, but only when they are being transmitted (as if it is possible to intercept an email while it is jumping from server to server in the form of packets).    If I recall correctly from my Cyberlaw class with  urlLink Susan Crawford : It is thought that the Stave Jackson decision was made largely for law enforcement purposes, to allow the Gov't easy access to electronic messages.  Because electronic messages in storage fall under Title II of ECPA (the Stored Communications Act) concerning stored communications the Gov't need only get a search warrant to obtain the communications.  If electronic communications "in storage" were considered to still be "in transit" to the addressee then they would fall under Title I of ECPA (the Wiretap Act) and the Gov't would have to obtain a court order to get the communication, which is more difficult to get than a search warrant.    Essentially the  Coucilman  decision relied on established precedent, although there is other precedent the court could've utilized (check out the  Konop  case).  It is clearly time for Congress to act on the electronic communications issue because the old Wiretap Act really can't be twisted to work well with newer technology.  At least not in such a way as to protect the privacy of typical Web users.  Even the Court notes in the opinion: "It may well be that the protections of the Wiretap Act have been eviscerated as technology advances."

      Some of the patents they plan to go after include one for the hyperlink, one for framed browsing, and one for online video streaming.  The EFF says:   Once it has identified some of the worst offenders, EFF will begin filing challenges to each in the form of a “re-examination request” to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These requests create a forum to affirmatively invalidate patents rather than forcing technology users to await the threat of suit. Under this procedure, EFF can choose particularly egregious patents, submit the prior art it has collected, and argue that the patent should be revoked. EFF will collaborate with members of the software and Internet communities as well as legal clinics and pro bono cooperating attorneys to help in these efforts.

      You'd think that reputable companies like J.P. Morgan Chase, Verizon Communications, Merck, and T-Mobile would stay away from advertising with controversial adware/spyware companies like WhenU.  WhenU and Claria (formerly Gator) are companies that operate by placing their adware programs on users' computers via "drive-by downloads."  Often these programs are included in downloads of freeware or shareware, like smiley face programs, free screensavers, or Kazaa.  The adware companies claim that consumers choose to download their adware because they are told of the bundled adware in the contract that you click "agree" to when you download a program.   Adware is software, often available as a free Internet download, that requires consumers to agree to accept advertising messages in order to use them. Some of these programs have been criticized for failing to adequately disclose their terms, which may include allowing companies to monitor consumer Web surfing activities, among other things.    The forthcoming report shows how WhenU advertisers target competitors' Web sites. According to the report, Best Western appears to throw up ads on 208 domains, including those of Comfort Inns and Days Inn; Thrifty aims ads at the sites of rivals Dollar Rent A Car and Enterprise Rent-A-Car; and Verizon DSL ads are triggered by visits to the sites of broadband providers Covad Communications Group, Direcway and 71 other domains.   While prominent companies advertise with WhenU, many of the advertisers hail from seamier sections of society. The report says 49 companies run gambling or betting ads on PCs with WhenU installed, and nine firms have purchased a total of 99 ads related to sexual enhancement. The largest advertisers are Priceline.com, J.P. Morgan Chase, Casino On Net, Verizon and Orexis (which sells sexual-enhancement pills for men).  Clearly no one appreciates getting pop-ups, and it can not help in bolstering a well though of company's reputation when they use these services.

The Inducing Infringements of Copyright Act introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) could conceivably make using CD burners, MP3 players and even some cellphones illegal.   Meanwhile Sen. Hatch continues to push another bipartisan bill, the Inducing Infringements of Copyright Act, which would permit lawsuits against any company that "intentionally induces'' consumers to make copies of copyrighted material. Supporters claim the bill merely targets file-sharing programs. But groups like the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation see it as something more insidious: a pathway to eliminating iPods, CD burners and other technological innovations that "induce'' users to violate copyrights.

      In  U.S. v. Councilman  the First Circuit recently ruled that is was ok for an ISP (in this case a bookseller who provided email service) to have email sent to its users copied and sent to them as well.  The ruling means that email providers can take and read your email without your consent or knowledge.    This decision interprets the privacy protections of the Wiretap Act very narrowly.  Here, the defendant bookseller was checking out the emails sent to his customers from his competition (Amazon in particular) in order to gain knowledge of their preferences in books and to keep an eye on the competition.  The decision indicates that any email provider can fully spy on their users without permission and without liability.    The reasoning for the finding concerns the nit-picky statutory interpretation of the Wiretap Act.  The snooping here did not violate the Wiretap Act because at the instant that the e-mails were copied, they were considered to be in storage, not in transit. In order to violate the Wiretap Act one must intercept the communication at the time it is in transit, which we all know, with email and other internet communications, is nearly impossible.  Since internet communications typically are copied and stored on servers, awaiting the addressee, they are all pretty much up for grabs according to the Wiretap Act.  This interpretation isn't new, but it is all the more disturbing in the age of the Internet.  The Wiretap Act is very old (passed in the 1968 I believe) and has not been able to keep up with changing technology.  Maybe it is time for a change in light of this recent ruling?

      A California teen got busted trying to film Spiderman 2.  A projectionist saw him and the theater turned him over to the police.  Being a projectionist in California recently got alot more profitable now that the MPAA pays out $500 to anyone who catches a bootlegger in the theater.  There are also criminal penalties for bootleggers.  A man was recently sentanced to 42 days in jail for trying to bootleg "The Alamo."  Projectionists in some theaters (including the one where this kid got busted) have been given  urlLink night vision goggles  to help them catch bootleggers.    Article  urlLink here .

      Republicans sure know how to party, and they need lots of strippers and prostitutes to do it.  The Republican Convention is to be held in NYC between Aug. 30-Sept. 2 at Madison Square Garden.   Agencies are flying in extra call girls from around the globe to meet the expected demand during the Aug. 30-Sept. 2 gathering at Madison Square Garden.  "We have girls from London, Seattle, California, all coming in for that week"...    Charging from $300 to upwards of $1,000 for an hour of companionship and a whole lot more, escorts said they can always count on conventioneers for big business.  Sex for money is a bipartisan activity (and I'm sure the Dem Convention will be no different):   "It doesn't matter what party you come from," said Robyn Few, a $500-an-hour California call girl who now runs Sex Workers Outreach Project, an advocacy group. "When you want to buy sex, you will."  Bah-humbug to morality and family values:     Clubs have started booking private parties for delegates anxious to ogle topless beauties after a day of watching fully clothed politicians boast about family values.  It is apparent that the GOP had planned this convention in NYC in order to take advantage of its proximity to the site of the 9-11 attacks.  Obviously New Yorkers, being fairly liberal in general are not very excited about hosting their guests.  Expect massive protests to go on while the conventioners cavort with their female companions.   New York Post article  urlLink here .

       urlLink Doom 3  was released today for PC and Xbox. It has been highly anticipated and is certainly going to be one of the biggest games of the year. The hype has been incredible and the creator of the game,  urlLink id Software , has been claiming that typical computers of the moment can hardly even be used to play the game at it's highest  urlLink graphical  settings (i.e. the graphics are eye-popping). Kids everywhere are running out to get more RAM and a new video card just so they can play this one.  The original Doom (and Wolfenstein 3D) essentially invented the first person shooter (FPS) game genre, one of the most popular types of games today. About Doom 3 the BBC says:  "From the cinema quality visuals and the incredible 5.1 sound, to the terrifying atmosphere and hyper-realistic environments, the whole game screams 'interactive horror film'."  I've seen screenshots and it does look fantastic. Unfortunately for id Software the game has somehow already been leaked and is available for download online. This weekend people downloaded the game at a ferocious rate, likely cutting into sales of the game:   Copies of the game on file-sharing networks and newsgroups are being downloaded by thousands of people. The cost to the game's makers, id Software, could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds in lost sales. The sci-fi horror title has been four years in the making... ... Developing a game like it can cost game developers like id Software in the region of $15m (£8.3m) to $20m (£11.1m). Its release is the gaming equivalent of the third film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In the US, the game is expected to retail for $54.99 and is expected to sell in the millions. ... At one point on Sunday, more than 50,000 copies of the game, which weighs in at more than 1.5 gigabytes, were being downloaded. Translated in lost sales, this amounts to $2.7m (£1.5m), if all these people instead bought the game. ... "Whereas in the case of Doom 3, it almost certainly won't prevent the game being a massive seller, it will still cost both the publishers and developers of the game millions of dollars in lost revenue, an outcome that can only serve to harm future game development on the PC," [Matt Pierce, publisher of the computer games magazine, PC Gamer] told BBC News Online.   The publisher of Doom 3 is  urlLink Activision . This is a real shame for id Software and everyone involved in bringing Doom 3 to the market. Hopefully they'll nail whoever leaked the code.  It's also stuff like this that arms proponents of the  urlLink INDUCE Act (IICA)  to the teeth with anecdotes about how content producers are the victims of technology. Thanks leaker, I hope you get something worthwhile out the deal (like a huge fine and a criminal record).

      Watch out Dentists, here come the copyright cops! The music industry in Canada is cracking down on professionals in Canada who play music in their offices. In the US the copyright law is also such that playing music in an office may be a "public performance" that the business should have to pay for.   Similar copyright laws exist in the United States. Some dentists, doctors and law offices choose to use background music services like  urlLink Muzak  or  urlLink DMX Music , which take care of the licensing drudgery via subscription fees. Those who opt to play their own iPods, CDs, records or tapes are required to pay the  urlLink American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ;  urlLink Broadcast Music Inc. , or BMI; and  urlLink SESAC , a performing-rights organization. These organizations represent songwriters, composers and publishers. Because these groups represent different copyright owners, professionals who play their own music in their offices must pay fees to some or all of the organizations.  Music played through headsets worn by patients may be considered public performance, too, since multiple patients use the headsets throughout the day, according to Jerry Bailey, a spokesman for BMI. If the office is particularly small, they may be exempt from paying fees for radio.  Not too cool.

       urlLink    There's been chat recently concerning whether or not the  urlLink University of Georgia  (the Bulldogs) may lose their trademark in their name. There have been long running difficulties between UGA's board of regents and UGA's main fundraising group (the  urlLink University of Georgia Foundation , UGF) that originally began over UGA president Michael Adams' decision not to renew the contract of popular athletic director and former head football coach  urlLink Vince Dooley .  Apparently UGA officials neglected to renew the trademark to the name "University of Georgia" in 1997, and the trademark was applied for by the University of Georgia Foundation (UGF), who now claims rights to use of the name on all sports paraphernalia and educational services.  Recently, the UGA has attempted to completely sever ties with the UGF. Newspapers have reported that this trademark issue has created a snag in the attempt to drop UGF, now that the UGF may have rights to use the UGA trademark. Perhaps the negotiation between the parties just got a little more interesting and heated.  Some basic trademark law is that trademarks are obtained by use, not by registration, so there is basically no chance that UGA could be denied the right to use the name they have been using for over 200 years. Letting a registration lapse does not constitute abandonment of the trademark.  The U. of Miami law prof.  urlLink Michael Froomkin , of  urlLink Discourse.net  and  urlLink ICANN Watch  fame, has  urlLink commented on the topic  (in an email that's been posted online?). He doesn't think there is much to the whole trademark controversy. He points out that state universities operate under the state's sovereign immunity and can infringe on intellectual property in general without worrying so much as a private enterprise about the consequences. Froomkin points out that the UGF's actions could result in a situation in which the UGA can't keep the UGF from using the UGA mark, therefore they would both get to use it.  Perhaps this trademark issue will actually push the battling groups back together. The fact is if the University of Georgia changed it's name the UGA mark would be worthless to everyone involved anyway, therefore neither party would have much to gain by pushing the issue, even if there is any meat to it, which there does not appear to be.

       urlLink John Battelle  and  urlLink Joi Ito  comment on the potential free speech implications to be wrought by IICA.   urlLink Joi Ito :  With more powerful cameras and PCs, video and Flash have become important mediums for free speech. They are increasingly being used for political action. The integration of blogs and p2p technology for sharing these videos like the  urlLink BitTorrent  link above from  urlLink Lessig  are a good example. I believe this is substantial non-infringing use.    urlLink John Battelle :  In other words, the INDUCE act could kill a lot more than p2p (or the iPod or even search), it could kill free expression and political discourse. Like, for example, the use of BitTorrent to discuss with and inform the public about an important political development...

      Some commentators have&nbsp;raised accusations of  urlLink 'foolish demagoguery' &nbsp;on the part of those who  urlLink suggest the   urlLink iPod is at risk  due to the proposed INDUCE Act (IICA).&nbsp;   The accusation is hardly an exposure of some overblown or empty&nbsp;argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;That argument has always been a very solid and moving metaphor.&nbsp; It is absolutely true that the iPod itself will not be threatened by IICA, but not because IICA is well written or not threatening to technological innovation.&nbsp; The iPod will   only  &nbsp;be off limits to lawsuits because of what lawmakers have said  urlLink on the record  during the IICA hearings, where they specifically stated that the iPod was not a target.&nbsp; Congress would not attempt to remove from the market a device that has been available to consumers for several years.&nbsp;  urlLink Orrin Hatch  stated as much himself  urlLink here :   For example, there is a mock complaint circulating that alleges that the Apple iPod violates S. 2560 because mp3 players would never have been commercially viable but for the preceding, massive wave of for-profit filesharing piracy that was defended by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. A real court would respond to that mock complaint in two words: Complaint dismissed. The caselaw states that no one can 'induce' unlawful acts that have already occurred.     Consider this  - IICA passes and several months later the iPod is released.&nbsp; Do you think that Apple would not be the defendant in&nbsp;a lawsuit&nbsp;considering the current language of IICA?&nbsp; It is clear that they would not only be targeted, but that their "Rip, Mix, Burn" campaign may well have been enough evidence&nbsp;to meet the&nbsp;general intent level&nbsp;necessary for a finding of&nbsp;inducement to infringe.&nbsp; Hatch's position, as&nbsp;quoted above,&nbsp;does not defend a product that induces more infringement than has already occurred.&nbsp;   So in one or two years when&nbsp;the iPod becomes available with a&nbsp;200 gig harddrive, much more music than the average person owns, is that going to induce more infringement?&nbsp; Maybe we'd learn the answer to that in court thanks to IICA.  No, there has been no exposure of a bunch of 'Chicken Littles' that has damaged credibility. When&nbsp;one must,&nbsp;one fights fire with fire. While IICA's authors were fully prepared to launch their campaign for support of the bill based on accusations that the P2P nets were to blame for child porn&nbsp;and other criminality (IICA&nbsp; was originally to be called the " urlLink Inducement Devolves into Unlawful Child Exploitation Act "), the opponents of the bill had to figure out how to draw the public's (and the media's) attention to IICA's problems.   The answer for anti-IICA activists to draw attention to their comments&nbsp;was to use the image of Congress taking your iPod away. Was this whole campaign some big lie?  No way , any product similar to the iPod that is developed after the passage of the INDUCE Act will be at risk of a suit because of the current broad language IICA.   The language of IICA is now&nbsp;being rewritten because of the great opposition to the bill, but that opposition didn't materialize out of thin air. It was created based on the work of activists who researched the issues and spread the truth about IICA - that it threatens to stifle technological innovation in devices capable of copying content.&nbsp; That some of those activists sought to illustrate the threat to technological innovation via a metaphor&nbsp;people could relate to is no crime, it is in fact a testament to the resolve, creativity, and intelligence of those activists.  In fact, the only reason the 'Chicken Little' accusations can even be made is because activists worked so hard to bring IICA to everyone's attention, including those who now accuse them of overstating their case.   There is more on this issue at  urlLink Ernie the Attorney  and at&nbsp; urlLink The Importance of ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .&nbsp; There is also more at the newly renamed  urlLink Invent Blog .

       urlLink Ernie The Attorney  has some strong words for anyone holding up the iPod to say IICA shouldn't be passed:  "The reality is that the INDUCE Act, if it is passed, might perhaps threaten some innovation and may even lead to some stupid lawsuits. But it isn't going to threaten the iPod, and people who make that argument are engaging in foolish demagoguery. Which proves that 'foolish demagoguery' isn't the exclusive province of companies that are threatened by new technologies."

      Now P2P is an issue of  urlLink national security (C|Net)  . Is this another attempt to add firepower to the arguments of the supporters of the INDUCE Act?   There is a new blog out there, " urlLink See What You Share On P2P ," that posts pictures of items the author finds on P2P nets, some of which he claims are military secrets.  In all fairness to the author of the site, he may be doing a service by making people aware of a situation that needs to be addressed, however, he states:    "Technology often outruns legislation. So is the case with Peer 2 Peer networks. Many people obtain P2P software so they can download music or movies. A large number of those people do not have any idea what they are sharing."  The true problem when confidential material appears on P2P nets is not a lack of legislation, it is one of computer user education and a lack of security.

It is going to stop U.S. developers from participating in this growth, just as it will stop U.S. manufacturers, distributors, and retailers from achieving any share of the profits to be made, or employing the people who perform these functions, and no one else is going to be paid, either.

      The P2P network  urlLink eDonkey  is a newcomer compared to old hat  urlLink Kazaa .  This recent  urlLink article  about IICA and eDonkey explains why eDonkey may be scaring the copyright industry even more than Kazaa and the others.     EDonkey's speed shows in its technology. It downloads bits of files simultaneously, and then seamlessly puts them into one file after they reach your computer. The name eDonkey is meant to spotlight its specialty in big files. The donkey is carrying a big load for you.  This  urlLink C|Net article  discusses the fact that Kazaa use is slowing while use of eDonkey and  urlLink BitTorrent , new rival P2P networks, is growing.  Noteworthy is the fact that eDonkey is perhaps the only P2P network incorporated in the United States (New York to be exact).     Unlike competitors, eDonkey is incorporated in New York and pays taxes here. That should account for something, Yagan [CEO] says. (Kazaa is incorporated on the small island of  urlLink Vanuatu ; Grokster is headquartered in  urlLink Nevis ,  urlLink West Indies ; and  urlLink Earthstation 5  is run from the  urlLink Jenin  refugee camp in Palestine.) Concerning the passage of the Induce Act, eDonkey's CEO says: "We'd have to figure out whether we need to close down (or)  move abroad and keep doing what we're doing ."   Like with spam or spyware bills, even if IICA passes, companies intent on using such a business model will find a place to do it.  They will incorporate in a country that will protect them and continue to run their P2P networks.    Personally, although P2P is a great innovation I feel no sympathy for the P2P networks because they  are  involved in massive copyright theft and are doing nothing to stop the infringement.  The point I want to make is this: let's not create an overbroad new copyright bill like IICA that will stifle innovation of mixed use technology in order to "kill off" the P2P networks because those networks will just go elsewhere anyway.  Let's write a bill that very narrowly targets P2P networks to avoid 'collateral damage' in the tech sector.    The buzz at the IICA hearing was to create a bill that will get "bad actors."  Let's do that, but also let's realize the probable ultimate result of IICA -- the creation of  urlLink data havens  and copyright infringement havens elsewhere (Russia, China, North Korea, small island states,  urlLink Sealand , etc).  The Induce Act should be rewritten with this is mind, otherwise, we may end up with a bill that not only stifles innovation, but does not even kill off the P2P nets.  It seems that the best we can do with IICA is  slow down  the use of P2P, let's spare technological innovation in the United States in the process.    Please comment on what you think of the possibility for the creation of foreign 'P2P havens.'

       urlLink P2P Net   urlLink press release :   Senator Orrin Hatch and other interested parties should meet with members of the commercial p2p industry to discuss alternative language and solutions to the INDUCE Act, says StreamCast Networks ceo Mike Weiss, who wonders why no one from the industry was at Thursday's Senate Committee on the Judiciary hearing into it. ... "Why is Congress turning a deaf ear towards learning the truth and hearing all sides of the story?" - Weiss asks in a statement released after the hearing... The fact is that no one really wants to hear from the P2P networks concerning IICA.  The INDUCE Act will put P2P out of business, why bother giving them a seat at the table?  It would be like letting a person on death row have a say in his fate.  There is nothing the P2P networks could contribute to the discussion because the only way they get what they want is if the INDUCE Act never passes.  As we heard at Thursday's hearing, Sen. Hatch is adamant that  urlLink something must be done  about the P2P nets soon.    That's why you get no seat at the table, Mr. Weiss (but you can keep fighting from the sidelines).

      and that 97% of the files on p2p networks are infringing.   Seems like a short term memory for Mitch, because during the  urlLink Grokster oral argument  [ urlLink mp3 ]&nbsp;I presume that attorneys for the industry were talking about 10% as being non-infringing because Judge John Noonan says to them:  So 10% is noninfringing?

That's your problem. Address that if you would. Filesharing doesn't seem to be hurting sales either. According to recent data -- I believe there were 13,000,000 more units (albums) sold in 1Q 2004 over 1Q 2003 and that file sharing networks saw somehting like a 5 million user increase over the same period.   There are studies too. Felix Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business School and Koleman S.

In addition, in the last two quarters, music sales increased while file sharing has become even more popular.  See&nbsp; urlLink Oberholzer-Gee/Strumpf study &nbsp;[ urlLink pdf ].

      While&nbsp;listening to Senator Leahy's testimony, I'm reminded of a recent article ( urlLink Some Like It Hot ) by  urlLink Lawrence Lessig  wherein he&nbsp;reminds us that every major entertainment media: film, radio and cable have their origins in piracy:  If piracy means using the creative property of others without their permission, then the history of the content industry is a history of piracy.

      There are lots of new articles concerning Thursday's IICA hearing.  It appears that many in the press are convinced that IICA is a threat to technological innovation (which it is, but that message wasn't gauranteed to get out during the hearing).  The coverage is altogether quite positive for those opposed to the passage of IICA.   urlLink Washington Post :  Senator Induces Support for Piracy Bill   "The architects of file-sharing piracy make millions of dollars while attempting to avoid any personal risk of the severe and criminal penalties for copyright infringement," said Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "I believe we can and must find a solution in this session of Congress." ... But Kevin McGuiness, executive director of NetCoalition, a group that represents Google, Yahoo and a handful of other Internet firms, said the bill puts too much power in the hands of copyright owners. Calling the Internet a "big copying machine," McGuiness said lawyers could use the measure in a way that would "jeopardize the essential architecture of the Internet."  urlLink InfoWorld :  Tech groups fight copyright infringement bill  "I can't find any technology company that supports this legislation as written," Shapiro testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "This bill is, by far, the biggest threat to personal creativity, new technology, and innovation in 20 years. I urge you to consider the harm it will engender."  ... While Shapiro and other technology groups said the bill goes too far, committee chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, challenged the groups to come up with alternative legislation to curb the unauthorized trading of copyrighted material online. The bill is not targeted at makers of legal technologies, Hatch said.   urlLink WIRED News :  Techies Blast Induce Act      The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony about the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act -- otherwise known as the Induce Act. In its current form, the bill proposes to slap technology companies for making any device that could "induce" or encourage buyers to make illegal copies of songs, movies or computer programs. The bill, introduced by Hatch (R-Utah) and Leahy (D-Vermont), has garnered strong support from Hollywood and the music industry. But technology companies say the bill would kill innovation and potentially outlaw some of the most popular devices, including Apple's iPod.  ... While all panelists expressed interest in working with the committee to halt piracy, four of the five panelists rejected the bill in its current form. The lone supporter was Mitch Bainwol, head of the Recording Industry Association of America. Observers said it was rare that on a panel of five invited witnesses, four would oppose the bill proposed by the committee chairman.   urlLink The Inquirer :  Incitement to piracy    And the bad intellectual property laws just keep coming...  urlLink Computer Weekly :  Tech groups fight copyright infringement bill   The legislation, which does not exempt makers of technologies with substantial legitimate uses from lawsuits, would discourage the creation of new products such as the iPod or TiVO, or home video and recording equipment, Shapiro said.  urlLink MacWorld :  Induce Act 'could kill media players'   Kevin McGuiness, executive director and general counsel of NetCoalition said that promise was not enough. "It's a little disconcerting for those of us in the Internet community to sit idly by and watch this legislation go forward based on presumption of good intentions forever on behalf of lawyers for the entertainment community," McGuiness said.

Andrew Greenberg and the IEEE offer this&nbsp; urlLink Proposed Substitute to S. 2560  [pdf]:   Section 501 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:  (g)(1) Inducement of Infringement.

(2) Contribution to an Infringement. Whoever knowingly and materially contributes to the infringement of a copyrighted work by another shall be liable as an infringer.  (3) Vicarious Infringement. Whoever has the right and ability to supervise an activity resulting in a direct infringement and has a direct financial interest in such activity and infringement shall be liable as an infringer.  (4) Limitations on Secondary Liability.  (A) manufacture, distribution, marketing, operation, sale, servicing, or other use of embodiments of an otherwise lawful technology by lawful means, with or without the knowledge that an unaffiliated third party will infringe, cannot constitute inducement of infringement under Subsection g(1) in the absence of any additional active steps taken to encourage direct infringement.  (B) manufacture, distribution, marketing, operation, sale, servicing or other use of embodiments of an otherwise lawful technology capable of a substantial noninfringing use cannot constitute contribution to an infringement under Subsection (g)(2) or vicarious infringement under Subsection (g)(3). (5) Damages for violations of section (g)(1) of this section shall be limited to an injunction against inducement, and actual damages for infringement of a work for which the defendant had specific and actual knowledge the work would be infringed.

       urlLink Les Vadasz  (wsj $): The problem with the "Induce bill" is not its intent, but its overly broad language ... The chilling effect that a law like this would have on innovation cannot be underestimated ... If this bill is enacted, many new opportunities will migrate outside the U.S.; others will never happen. It's unconscionable that at a time when our economy needs more innovation, we'd consider enacting a law that would surely lead to less. Innovation means jobs, productivity, a betterment of our lives ... what we need are legislators who can curb their urge to legislate in areas where their actions are likely to do more harm than good.

      The IICA hearing (officially titled " urlLink Protecting Innovation and Art while Preventing Piracy ") did not turn out as badly as it could have, in fact it went very well for those opposed to the introduction of the INDUCE Act.  Nearly every single witness at the hearing came out against IICA, with Gary Shapiro, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Consumer Electronics Association going so far as to say that a new law is completely unnecessary (here's his  urlLink press release ).  Most of the other witnesses stated that they thought a new and less broadly worded version of IICA should be drafted.  Even the BSA, who recently put out that possibly  urlLink dodgy piracy study  came out to say they want IICA rewritten (here's their  urlLink press release , and Robert Holleyman's  urlLink testimony ).  The only witness in favor of the INDUCE Act as written was Mitch Bainwol, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Recording Industry Association of America (which was predictable).  Bainwol stayed away from actually talking about the legal ramifications of IICA and instead mainly discussed how evil the P2P networks were and how file trading was hurting their industry.  Shockingly, he said he would be willing to work with IICA if it were considered to be too broad.    Also, Marybeth Peters, the head of the United States Copyright Office strongly supports IICA, but never got to comment on whether she thought a rewrite may be in order.  Here is  urlLink her testimony , via  urlLink Copyfight .  The conclusion of the hearing was that everyone needs to go back to the drawing board and redraft the law.  Sen. Hatch is adamant that "something must be done," so it appears that there is no going back.  On the other hand, it seemed that the tech industry representatives had Hatch agreeing with them that the substantial noninfringing uses Betamax doctrine should be codified, which must be scaring the crap out of the RIAA.    It also sounded like the intent standard is a big issue and there was some conversation about using the more objective specific standard utilized by the patent law for inducement.  This intent standard would make IICA much less dangerous to tech companies and innovation.  In fact, if a new version of IICA codified Betamax and specifically stated that inducement in copyright would use the same specific intent standard as patent then the INDUCE Act really would not change the copyright law very much at all (a good thing).  Finally, Sen. Hatch stated that he wanted to crank this new IICA bill out during August, so get ready for a quick and bumpy ride.  It's guaranteed to shock and thrill!

      Robert W. Holleyman II, the President and CEO of  urlLink Business Software Alliance , is scheduled to speak in favor of the INDUCE Act at the IICA hearing today.    In an odd bit of luck and good timing, the Business Software Alliance just happened to release a new piracy study recently.  While these sort of studies are always self serving, this new one claims that there is $29 billion dollars of software piracy going on yearly. The fishy part is that in previous studies the same group claimed that there was $13 billion in yearly losses due to software piracy.   [A] study released two weeks ago by the Business Software Alliance ... estimated the yearly losses from software piracy at $29 billion worldwide ...  Opponents of the copyright bill see the trade group's study as an overt political act intended to increase support for the proposed legislation by portraying software piracy as a rapidly growing problem that is far more costly than was previously thought ... The trade group's previous estimate of software piracy losses was $13 billion a year ...   The article notes that Microsoft and Hollywood studios are leading supporters of the Business Software Alliance. Larry Lessig is quoted in the article:   "I think the senators were totally misled about what this legislation is about.  This would not be a tiny, targeted change. It would be a massive change that would totally sidestep the Betamax ruling."  Better news is that:   More than 40 companies and organizations - ranging from Intel, Google and Verizon to the American Library Association - wrote to [Senator] Hatch on July 7, expressing concern that the bill would touch off a wave of copyright suits and would chill innovation. They requested a hearing on the bill before Congress proceeded any further.   The full witness list for the hearing can be found  urlLink here .  The hearing begins in half an hour, it will be interesting to see how the piracy study is used or if it becomes an issue at all.

      Robert Holleyman, the head of the  urlLink Business Software Alliance  (BSA) and one of the  urlLink witnesses  at the recent IICA hearing, has issued a policy statement urging Congress to take a close look at IICA. The BSA press release can be  urlLink obtained here .  In the BSA press release Holleyman lays out a vision of the IICA they'd like to see:   In its policy statement, the BSA says the bill should:  1) Clarify that multipurpose technology products that can be used for commercially significant, legitimate purposes are not subject to liability.  BSA suggested that the bill clearly state that the Supreme Court's decision in the  Betamax  case is unaffected .  2) Clarify that to meet the intent standard of the bill, an actor must be shown to have engaged in  conscious, recurring, persistent and deliberate acts  demonstrating that the acts caused another person to commit infringement.  3) State specifically that  mere knowledge  by a developer of technology, or knowledge by a provider of a service, of the infringing acts of another person using that technology or service  is not sufficient to demonstrate the requisite  specific intent  .  4) Clarify that the bill  does not create liability based on advertising or on providing support to users , including instructions for using the technology provided through manuals or handbooks, nor by providing assistance for using a product through a company's online help system or telephone help services.  5) Develop a mechanism to ensure that weak,  harassing or frivolous lawsuits are not heard by the courts , by establishing a way to ensure such cases are not brought without some prior review for its merits.  These suggestions sound fantastic, but the truth is that the INDUCE Act will not be very useful to content providers if all of these common sense provisions are provided for in it. One of the main problems with IICA is that without a general intent standard it really will not change the copyright law much. Congress needs to find a way to write IICA so that it kills off the P2P nets while utilizing a specific intent standard, that will be difficult.  If IICA is written with a general intent standard and without the BSA suggestions it will be overbroad and threatens to stifle innovation in the tech sector.

      Jim Rapoza writes in  urlLink "IT Advocacy Group Still Needed" , in eWeek, that the IT industry completely lacks the sort of lobbying organization necessary to fight off dangerous proposed laws such as IICA. He envisions:    ...an organization with the same clout in Washington that groups like the American Association of Retired Persons or the National Rifle Association have. There are lots of small groups that speak for different segments of IT and IT causes, but none that has gained any great measure of influence. ... Industry titans could subtly remind legislators of the economic might of the technology sector, which dwarfs what the movie and music industry add to the U.S. economy. Major employers could let lawmakers know about the potential negative fallout some of these laws could have on their ability to be productive contributors and employers in their respective districts.  The sheer size of such an IT advocacy group, which would easily dwarf groups like the NRA, could be persuasive in Washington. It could have the resources to tap powerful lobbyists and representatives.   If in fact the IT industry does not have a major lobbying group, then this sounds like an idea that is long overdue despite slightly differing interests of actors in the tech sector on certain issues.  An law like IICA is one that is bad for the IT industry as a whole and is best fought by a single strong voice.   Rapoza wants to help in the formation of such a group and asks IT workers and managers to contact him with info for a future article.  Article  urlLink here .

      According to the comments to this post on bIPlog ( urlLink INDUCE Hearing in MP3, OGG ) the following line by Marybeth Peters, Register of Copyrights, "We would never say no to you",  was edited  dropped out during the stream capture of the from the induce.wmv. [ urlLink via ]  When I first watched the movie, I just thought whatever was spoken by her that had the Committe in an uproar was just inaudible, but apparently no matter how many times I listened to it I wasn't going to hear it since it had not been captured  been edited out .  Peter Lopez has the missing chat  urlLink here  and Tom Barger explains the technical problems  urlLink here .  Listen to the mp3 if you'd like to indulge in Hatch and Peters flirtations.
