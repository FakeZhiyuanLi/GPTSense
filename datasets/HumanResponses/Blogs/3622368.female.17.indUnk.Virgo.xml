      ...is my new favorite song. I've been listening to it in the car over and over and over today! I just can't get it out of my head. Today I haven't done much. Talked to CW on the net for a little bit but not really like we usually do. Didn't talk to her at all yesterday. I'm sorta wondering if something is up. Don't really know what or why but things just feel different. Maybe I'm just freaking out over nothing. Went out to lunch with Shane today. That was fun..found out that he really is dating M.Y. though. I'll admit I'm a little jealous but not really because I'm in such an awesome mood for no reason at all today! Have a stupid commercial stuck in my head too so thought I'd sing it! lol.               Hello Mother, Hello Father              Fleas and Ticks...really bother!              Thanks for the package, that's why I'm writing              K-9 Advantex, stops all the biting!              Swimming, hiking....tent pitching              They're not biting...I'm not itching!              I can't wait to show you...all my new tricks!              Thank you for sending....K-9 Advantex!! :) Yes I'm bored and have no life! lol. I'm actually really hyper today! Well I need to go do some chores! Maybe work off a little of this excess energy!!

      I haven't been on the computer all morning which is very unusual for me so I thought I'd take some time to sit down and write this blog. Yesterday was a pretty boring day except for vball which was tons of fun. Then my softball game got cancelled and that made me happy but I spent the evening doing nothing.   Today has been pretty busy but not really lol. As soon as I got up I picked up the house and headed out to my gma's. I helped her with a few things for a little cash! lol. Then I went out to lunch with JG...fun but was ready for some alone time to do nothing. I'm really tired right now and don't feel like doing anything tonight but I believe that's impossible. I have TWO softball games tonight and I'm wishing I could stay home and do nothing! lol. I'm such a lazy bum but oh well. Well the couch is calling my name and I'm so ready for a nap so I'll write more tonight...

      This past weekend I went to a softball tournament in TN. It was a blast! (Well for the most part.) The days were long and tiring but had so much fun with the girls on my new team. In fact I've actually made new friends. We are going to hang out together some time this week and I can't wait. (Ok I sound like a loser that doesn't have friends already but the friends I have really don't qualify as true friends.) The trip had a few downsides but I'm not even going to talk about them because I'm in a pretty good mood right now. Overall I had a lot of fun and can't wait for next weekend!  Not much planned for today. Not feeling so great today. Oh forgot I have volleyball today and a softball game tonite. Guess that is what I will be doing today! lol. Well need to go get ready for the day..

      Today sucked so bad! Once again I find myself only thinking about myself and hurting the ones I care about most. After everything is all said and done I feel really horrible about the way I acted. I hate when I do things like that. I don't think before I do things and later I regret the things I've done, especially now. One of these days I'm gonna push people too far and they won't take the time to forgive me. I've been really down today. Everything in my life just really sucks right now. I can't seem to do anything right. I really want to try to have a positive outlook and change myself for the better but I just don't know if that is possible. I probably just lost the best friend I will ever have all over something stupid and me being totally selfish. If I could go back and do things different I would but things don't work that way so I'm stuck will dealing with it now. I hope she knows how sorry I am and even though sorry doesn't mean anything until I change. I need someone to talk to especially with all that is going on right now and I just pray that I didn't screw things up too much. I've been doing a lot of thinking tonight and I really am going to try my best to become a better person. I want so bad for things to be better than they are right now. I just don't know how to do that alone. I want to be happy for once and actually realize that I do have a lot going for me. Right now I'm just not feeling so great about myself. I guess if she doesn't decide to forgive me then I just hope she realizes how much she means to me as my best and sometimes only friend and that I appreciate all she does for me even though I end up treating her like crap some times. So I'm making myself a promise tonight to starting thinking of others and to change my selfish ways. So here's to a new start...

      Today wasn't a good day at all. I just haven't been in the best of moods today. Actually was excited when I woke up because I knew I got to go see my messenger buddy that I talk to EVERYDAY, but after that my day just went downhill. Nothing really has happened to cause this mood...just one of those days I guess.   Didn't do much today...not until volleyball and I'm extremely exhausted from. I'm about to fall asleep just writing this!! My knee is still hurting me too! :(  Well "he" called back again tonight...I made the mistake of answering it this time though. Fortunately I was busy and had an excuse for having to go and not talking long. He is supposed to call me back later tonight but yeah right, that never happens! Well I think I'm off to bed now...it's been a long day...and hopefully a fresh start tomorrow!

      After lounging around the house when I got home from softball practice, I had a family thing to go to for dinner. Well before that I learn that we are going to look at a car for my sister who will be getting her license. Well I guess we think we have money  because she ends up getting it! lol. (It must be nice being the baby of the family lol). I must admit it is a littler nicer than mine but I'm still a better driver and can beat her anytime in a street race! lol. So after that we go out to my cousin's house for the fam. thing. Nothing to exciting there. After eating I spent most of the time with Thad (my cousin that will be a freshman this year and boy is that a scary thought) playing pool and air-hockey down in the basement. (I'm not too big on socializing!) At about 9:30pm I decide it's time for me to go home! So me and KT make a lap in Ptown just to see if there is anything going on. I go to bed around 10pm...I was so tired last night.  Then I wake up this morning only to find out that I have two missed calls and a new voicemail on my cell phone. Well it was "him"...the guy I haven't talked to in exactly two weeks. The jerk that wants nothing to do with me except when he can't get anyone else. He left a message saying he really wanted to talk to me and crap...well this time things are going to change! I'm so not calling him back and I'm not dealing with his crap!! I've finally made up my mind and I'm movin' on!  Well not much planned for today...tired and my knee is killing me. Have volleyball at 4pm but besides that I will probably just be lounging around the house like a lazy bum! Oh well...

      Besides being up since 3:30 this morning and starting to get a bit tired it has been an AWESOME DAY!!!! Went to Wal-Mart and then walked two miles with mom this morning. After that it was the big tennis showdown between me and Rob! That was a blast!!! (Until some unsuspected visitors showed up!) After that Rob and I walked/ran a mile! Then I came home and relaxed some and talked to Dani on the net and texted Rob some too! Then it was off to softball practice in E'ville! I must admit I did get my workout today! lol. I'm just in such an awesome mood right now! It's been awhile since I felt this way! Oh yeah...checked out my ACT scores and I totally raised them way higher than the min. to get into Rose!!! That really made my day!!! :) Well now I'm off to a fam thing for dinner....

      Well once again I can't seem to sleep! I haven't had a good night's sleep in about a week!! I've just got so much on my mind right now and I just can't seem to relax! Been up for about an hour now....tried watching some tv and then forcing myself to try to get some sleep because boy will I be in a bad mood if i don't! I decided to get up and write this blog...which is only making me more awake so it's really defeating the purpose of trying to sleep! Oh well! Nothing too exciting to write about...gonna go try to fall asleep!!

      Well after chatting on the net in the morning I went and walked two miles with my mom and sister. Then I played a little tennis. Now I'm not a pro or anything but it was fun! After that I came home had lunch and then was lazy watching tv all afternoon. Oh Dani came over for a bit! Then had volleyball open gym! That was fun like always. Then had softball game. Not so fun there...but someone was there that I wasn't expecting to be so that made it somewhat better! Well I'm tired and don't feel like writing much, sorry!

      Today was fun as hell!! After picking up the house and stuff I went over to my dad's. Then we went out to eat in E'ville. Then for some strange reason my dad let KT drive his truck....yeah that anything but boring! His truck is anything but small and KT is anything but a pro at driving! It lead to a few laughs though! When we finally made it home (thank god in once piece) Bob and I went out on the harley. That was a blast! I love riding! We met up with Joey and cruised P-town for awhile before heading back to Bob's. Then after hanging out and talking a bit I went out on the 4wheeler and decided to take it down to the sandpit. With still a little water on the ground from the rain a few days ago it was perfect! I went muddin' for like 2 hours! I had SO much FUN!!!! I just got out of the shower (I had quite a bit of mud on me). Well I'm worn out now...don't know if I'm gonna do anything tonight or not, probably just hang around the house!

      Well I'm finally back on my usual routine of getting up, wasting most of the morning talking to my best friend on the net, and then finally getting my lazy butt up and doing something productive! I'm really glad she's back from vacation...I was about to die!!! (Not really but I was going crazy trying to find something else to do every morning!) So I'm in a pretty good mood today! Mom is out of town so it's just been me and KT at home this weekend. We're going out to my dad's house today but other than that I don't have anything planned! Probably just another boring day. Well not really much to talk about...I'll write more tonight.

      Today has been pretty uneventful! I went to E'ville this morning for softball practice then did a little father's day shopping! And of course bought some stuff for myself! :) On my way home JG called to see what I was up and asked if I wanted to do something. (His real reasoning being that his dad was using his explorer and he wanted someone to haul his ass around town so he didn't have to sit at home all day.) Anyway...we ended up going to wal-mart and then to goody's. Nothing too exciting there! Then I called home and got KT out of bed around 12:30 and we went out to lunch with JG. Then we ventured back to his place where we attempted to put the hammock together that JG bought his dad for father's day. (Sorry only got my dad a harley-davidson license plate...but it's what he asked for.) Anyway boy was that a laugh seeing JG (not the most manly man), KT (who was no help at all), and me (the only smart one out of the bunch) putting the hammock together! Well in about 30 minutes and a few arguments I decided to ignore them and "git 'er done" myself! By then I was completely exhausted and it was time for a short afternoon nap. (Which I just woke up from!) Now I'm just sitting here wasting time on the computer like usual! Don't have any big plans for tonight (imagine that). I think I'm gonna go watch tv and be lazy for a little while longer!

      Besides being a new single from Tim McGraw, "Live like you were dyin" has become my new outlook on life. A lot has went on the past couple of days that has totally changed my way of thinking. I'd really rather not discuss it, but word of advice...don't take anything in life for granted because before you know it life could pass you by.   On a more positive note...got a letter in the mail today from my good friend who left for the army ten days ago! He started basic training today...boy bet he was in for a shocker! It's been his dream to go be in the army and I'm so glad he is getting to do just that! Also really glad he is keeping in touch! :)  Also learned today that a certain person that I admire and am somewhat jealous of at times, actually acknowledges my existence! That really just made my day!   Really haven't been up to much today...had softball practice and been doing a lot of thinking. Obviously not going to the "big party" tonight that I had mentioned in a previous post. Decided to stay home and hang out with my fam. Plus my cousin and her new baby are coming over. Well off to go visit...I spend way too much time on the computer these days!

      I was supposed to have a softball game tonight but that didn't end up happening. We drove to pike watching it rain all the way there and then get there and sit in the dugout while it rains even more! Yeah...not the smartest thing to do! lol. Well anyway then after about 30 minutes we head back home! After that I go out to eat with a few friends of mine....  I guess you could call them friends! lol. Well we decide to go out to eat and then drive around town and then hang out at one of their houses. The smartest person I know...(besides myself of course)...can be so common sense dumb sometimes! I about couldn't take it! lol. We ended up playing sand vball in the dark with a glow in the dark ball...fun but not too practical!   Also tonight I've been thinking ALOT about "him". I want so bad just to pick up the phone and talk to him but I know it's not the right thing to do at all. I just need to pick myself up and move on once and for all! I need to quit putting myself in the situation!   Tomorrow night there is a big "party" that all the popular ppl are going to and a "friend" asked me to go with her. I really don't want to go because it's just dumb to go to those kind of parties with ppl doing stuff that they shouldn't, so I choose not to put myself in that position to even be tempted to try something that I know is not best for me. I feel like a big dork though because I don't go and do what other kids my age do. Oh well, later on I will be glad I didn't go. Well off to bed I'm tired!

      Well I had planned on just lounging around all morning but that hasn't happened at all! I went for a run then was put to work! I had to clean the pool, mow the yard, trim the shrubs, and a few other outside jobs. With only me, KT, and mom living here someone has got to be the "man" of the house and do that work! Mom has too many other things to do and heaven forbid if KT broke a sweat or got dirty! lol. That's just life and someone has to do the hard work! I'm worn out now! Well mom is cooking lunch and I'm starving (yeah I know you can tell by looking at me! lol) Off to eat...

      Last night had its ups and downs. Really did enjoy being a senior at vball and having ppl look up to me. Had a good time for the most part at vball but just a few things were said that upset me. I didn't know I was such a horrible person, but I guess I am. One person in particular seemed to find everything that was wrong with me. I'm not going to discuss the details though, it only makes me more upset. Oh well I guess....it's a new day and I should put that behind me!  Don't really have much planned for today. I'm sore as heck and just feel like lounging around all day, but I don't think that is what mom has in mind! :( Also have a softball game tonight. Well mom and KT went to go tan and stuff so I'm gonna go back to bed before I have to get up for the day!

      Well last night JG came over and we hung out for a little bit. Just chatting and watching tv,  nothing too exciting! He had better plans later that night so he didn't stay too long. The story of my life....not being good enough! Anyway I have a ton of stuff to do today! I just got back from picking KT up from a friend's house and now I'm gettin ready to go get my hair cut. After that I'll be grabbing a quick bite to eat then doing chores around the house. Then it's off to hitting practice in E'ville! When that is over I have to rush home get KT and then to volleyball open gym, which will be followed by an exciting ride with LL to the Tecumseh volleyball league from 6-9 tonight! After that I will be completely exhausted and headed to bed!!! Well I better get going...

      Yes I know what you're thinking...what social life...well that's just it, I don't have one! I'm sitting at home tonight doing absolutely nothing! The "friends" I used to hang out with just don't seem to be the same and we don't talk much anymore. I guess part of that is my own fault for not calling them or anything, but I don't know we've just gone down different paths. Things just change I guess. I just don't do the so called "popular" stuff. I'm so bored right now...just as I have been all day! Tomorrow is going to be extremely busy though. I guess it's better than sitting around the house all day, but I don't like to have so much to do in one day. Oh well I will make it! I don't have much else to talk about. I'm really bored! There's no one on the net to talk to either! Well I'm gonna try to enjoy an exciting evening of watching tv and surfing the net alone! Let ya know if anything exciting happens! lol.

      Tonight has been anything but wonderful! First of all I've been in a horrible mood from my lack of sleep! But I did something I have NEVER done before today. I bought a shirt from wal-mart. (Yes, how embarrassing I know but it had to be done!) We are gonna keep that on the down low though! Had fun at vball today...despite the fact that only four people were there! Hopefully that got me some brownie points though....boy do I need them! :) I think this year is gonna be pretty good though. Did not have a good time at softball at all tonight! First of all I'm still playing JV and I just don't get it. I work my butt off and it's all politics though and it just makes me so mad! I guess there is nothing I can do about it! B.M. really made me mad tonight! It's one thing to get mad at me and say something to me if I mess up but if you say it to my sister I just come unglued! She's has a f'n torn ligament in her hand and you expect her to catch perfectly...um I don't believe it is possible! It's making me mad right now just thinking about it! After I finally got home from the game tonight (oh yeah by the way we won...go team lol) I went swimmin with KT. Fun until the many bugs started to get to us. Oh yeah the golf team is after me again....honestly they really need to grow up!!! I mean yeah I know I'm great and they are jealous but you don't have to act like an immature kid and talk trash about me! Well anyway...talking to Rob, trying to explain to her what a blog is and working on our new "diet plan"! :)

      As you know last night I didn't get to bed till way late! Well I ended up finally falling asleep around 1:30AM, only to be awaken by a horrible stomach ache at 3:00AM! After staying up for about an hour I went back to bed and then was back up again at 7:00AM! (So much for sleeping in!!) I'm still a bit tired but just cant seem to sleep when I know the sun is out and it's a beautiful day. Not to mention I have a ton of stuff to do today! As soon as I get the energy to get myself away from the computer to go take a shower and get ready, I plan on doing a few chores around the house! (Yeah I know please try to control your excitement...I know you're jealous!) After that and running a few errands I'm coming home for a little lunch and watchin' a little tv, I have volleyball! I'm SO EXCITED!!!! :) I LOVE playing vball, especially since I'm a senior and this season is going to be AWESOME!!! There's been a few coaching changes but Rob is still here so I know the season will be a blast! I'm really ready for school to start just for the actual season to begin! (Not ready for homework or anything like that yet! LOL) Also have a teen league softball game tonite-not as excited about that! But I will sure put on an act like I am! Well enough of being a lazy bum and letting the day pass me by!!!

      It's way past my usual "bedtime", but I just can't seem to fall asleep. I've tried everything! I'm not even sure what is keeping me awake! Had a pretty good evening...actually had fun at my dad's house. Chase, his g/f, Katie, and I hung out and it was a ton of fun! Right now I'm watchin' a little tv. (Not much to do here when everyone else is in bed!) Also there's only 21 people online on my buddy list and of course none of the people I like to talk to! I really need to get some sleep!!! I start volleyball open gym tomorrow and have a softball game. I'm sure if I don't get to bed soon I will definitely be sleeping in later than I normally do in the morning! Well sitting here talking about nothing isn't getting me anywhere...back to try to force myself to fall asleep!!

      Just got back from a little morning walk with Mom. It finally stopped raining and thought I should do something productive today. Not much is going on today and I'm bored as heck! I usually spend my summer days chatting on the net but it doesn't help when the person I ALWAYS talk to is on vacation! :( Guess I need to find something else to do to occupy my time. I guess which is why I am writing this! LOL. I'm so excited right now because I finally got my NEW favorite song to download! It's called Ridin' With The Legend - it's about the GREATEST NASCAR DRIVER EVER, Dale Earnhardt. Yep that's right I'm redneck -nothing better than big trucks, country music, and relaxin' with a cold one watchin' a nascar race! LOL. Don't really know where I'm going with this conversation here just bored and writing about anything that comes to mind. I'm still in such a great mood from yesterday, when I received my Rose-Hulman application in the mail. I've been working my butt off in school (besides an A- in US History one six weeks but we won't go there LOL) and it's finally time to see if it has paid off! All in hopes that I can get into the school of my dreams and if so hopefully find a way to pay for the LARGE chunk of change that it is going to cost! Well can't think of anything else to talk about. Gonna surf the net for awhile and then have to head out to my dad's house for my step-bro's bday! Once again I'll hopefully have something half way exciting to talk about by tonight! :)

      Well decided to try something new...A friend of mine has a blog site and kinda got me hooked and made me want to start my own. So here we are!! :) Not much going on in the extremely exciting town of P-ton today! It's been storming like crazy all morning, which is why I'm up instead of sleeping in like any other normal teenager does during the summer! But I guess I'm not exactly a "normal" teenager. Of course I have the all common teenage attitude of thinking I know all, but as stated in the web address I'm a chem geek! I can't help it...what's not fascinating about chemistry! (Besides my teacher...JUST KIDDING!!!) Actually my chem teacher is GREAT and that's why I now love chemistry!! Anyway, no big plans for me this summer. I don't get much free time with softball and volleyball during the summer. But I guess I better enjoy it now because it's my last summer as a high schooler! Well sorry nothing too exciting to write about today maybe by tonight something worth writing about will happen! Off to get ready for the day!

      Well it's been awhile since I've sat down and wrote a blog! Things have just been crazy. I've been extremely busy but yet I feel like I never do much or anything exciting! I've been pretty bummed out this week but I really don't have a reason to be except for the fact that a certain person has sorta hurt my feelings lately but I'm not going to discuss that. &nbsp;I've started seeing Derrick again and it's been great. I know a few of the people close to me don't really approve but they have no idea how great I feel when I'm with him. Not so sure how long it will last or anything but for right now I'm just enjoying the ride. I'm so ready for school to start it's not even funny! It's my senior year and I'm actually going to try to enjoy it! Although I'm so excited to start class (yes I know I'm weird) ! Ready for vball to start also...sick of sitting around being lazy.

      I've been really busy which is why I haven't wrote in awhile but I thought I'd take the time now to write about the best thing that has ever happened to me! I've been thinking a lot today about how I met my best friend in the world and just how great our frienship is. We are so much alike but yet so different. I'm so lucky to have her as a friend...she would do anything for me. Right now she's going through a tough time and I'm glad that I get to be the one that is there for her. It breaks my heart to know that she has been upset lately and I wish I could do more than offer a few kind words to cheer her up. Sometimes I feel as if I don't tell her enough how much I care about her and what her friendship means to me, and when I do go to tell her that I can never find the words to express it. She is just the greatest person and I try everyday to become more like her. I've had some troubles over the past year with people who said they were my friend and turned out only to be a "part time" friend. These people would put me down and make me feel so bad about myself. Well I've finally found someone who makes me feel great about myself and I'm proud to be her friend. So if you're reading this and you know that I'm talking about you...I just wanted to say thank you so much for just being who you are and having the kindness in your heart to be my friend. I value our friendship so much!!!

      The past few days haven't gone to well for me. I've been feeling so bummed lately and just everything has gone wrong. But that all has changed today...with just a simple email from a friend that actually cares about me. It's the little things in life that really matter, and for her to even think of me right now jsut makes my day. With this sudden boost in confidence, I have decided to pick myself up and make this a great day. I don't know what is up ahead but with a positive outlook I know everything will be just fine! So here's to a great day...

      Life sucks right now. I'm totally bummed out today. With the shoulder injury and the pain from that, things aren't too good to begin with. I'm really bummed about not being able to do anything for three weeks. Nothing has gone my way today. I drop my phone today and crack the face of it, then get "un-invited" to go with my so-called friend, shoulder is in a lot of pain, and I'm just all around bummed. Also some family arguments are going down right now and I'm in the middle and just don't know what to do. I can't please both of them although I would really like to. Things just stink right now. When I get this way I start thinking of JA. Why...I do not know?!?! I know I shouldnt but I'm almost tempted to call him. Atleast I know he would want me for something, even if that something is what I'm ready for. It just seems that no one else has time for me or wants to be around me these days. It just really sucks to be me I guess. I really wish something would happen to get me out of this extremely down mood. There are only two things that could possibly happen to get me up again...both of them are pretty doubtful though. I just want to feel wanted right now...something really needs to happen to get me out of this mood.

      Well I spent the weekend playing softball. It was hot and humid but fun! This is my last year of summer ball so I should make the best of it. I was nervous about joining a new team but these girls are so nice and actually accept me and we've become great friends. Saturday night, Jennifer and Connie (two girls on the team) asked me to go out with them to eat and then to hang out. It was so much fun. We talked about everything like we had known each other for a long time. Also I had a great time with  just me, mom, and Kate. All of us are so busy these days that we don't get to spend time just the three of us anymore...before I know it, in another year those days will be gone when I go off to school. It makes me sad just thinking about it, although I really can't wait to go to college. Anyway...."the big party" didn't got down at my house last night. Darn! lol. I knew it wouldn't...the two guys that were planning it are such gossip queens and never follow through on what they say.   Today I have volleyball camp this afternoon. I'm nervous but excited too! It only last three days though. then next week it is off to Florida. That should be fun even though I'm not too crazy about the beach and stuff. Actually we're really not sure if we are going or not...KT really deson't want to miss the fair which is that week and there are a few other reasons but I'd rather not discuss. I guess we will just see what happens. Anyway...I need to go get my sister up and get ready!

      well just had a huge post and of course the computer messes up and i lose it all! Life is frickin' great! Of course something like this would happen to me. it always does. What all was said in the lost post I cannot repeat it all but I'm going to try....  I was talking about how I've been thinking a lot lately and trying to reflect on my own life and I start to wonder what life?? well i guess my life is okay on the outside looking in but from where I'm standing it's not so great. I'm going back to the person that I thought I had overcome...the me that is always depressed and doesn't want to do anything or talk to other people, that keeps all my emotions inside until I just can't take it anymore. I wish desperately that life had a plan and everything would follow that plan (that's the ocd in me kicking in), but things don't happen that way. I was at a high point and very slowly I'm starting to hit rock bottom again. I don't know how things go this way but I sure wish they didn't. I am feeling horrible right now. I hate everything about me. The past few days I've been in a bad mood and for no particular reason...well I could name a few I guess but I don't want to go into that. I'm sure not many people can tell that I'm feeling this way except for a few that are close to me. I don't know what is wrong with me but there has got to be something! I can't take it anymore...I'm sick of trying to pretend that everything is okay when it's really not. I'm scared of letting someone know that I'm feeling this way in fear of letting them down. All I want to do is try to please people and I can't even seem to do that lately. I've done a few things lately that I totally regret and wish so much I could go back and change things but I can't. I'm becoming the person that I do not want to be at all. I try so hard sometimes to be positive and hope that things will get better but yet they never do. I've got to find a way for things to get better soon before it is too late. Im sure if you're reading this right now you're thinking I nuts and a total mental case, and right now I'd have to agree with you. Well that's all I feel like writing now...
