        Life is absolutely shitty without the internet - I didn't have it this weekend - blah.  I am forcing my two best friends Emily and Shannon to read this because I want them to know WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ME BY LEAVING ME!!!!  :)  So guys, when you read this I hope you feel like complete shit, knowing that I am alone in this awful, godforsaken town.  So there.    Has anybody read what is going on with our gold medal winning men's gymnast, Paul something?  The judges are saying they messed up and didn't give his competitor the right points or some shit and that the other guy should have won.  WTF?  No way - its just like football - once play resumes, you can't make any appeals about a foul and nothing can be disputed.  Yet, a lot of people are saying Hamm should give up the gold.  No way - even if he didn't "earn" it points wise - anyone who watched him realizes that he earned heart wise.  That guy is a soldier!

       urlLink    This is absolutely my favorite band - AFI - Davey Havok - the front man doesn't quite look like that anymore.  This is back in the old days when they were hardcore.  Although I love their new cd Sing the Sorrow.  They are intense, talented and have lyrics and chords like I have never heard.  I am in love and obsessed with anything they write, cover and/or sing.&nbsp; urlLink

        So last night, I was basically told that because I am nice to guys, I have to deal with the fact that guys are going to have crushes on me.  Just because I am nice to them?  Isn't that something dudes have to fucking deal with?    I went out drinking last night with two guys and we stayed up pretty late.  I went to bed at about 5:30 and got to work around 8.  One of the guys didn't get here until 11 and the other one went home sick.  WTF???   I went out to lunch with mom and my brother.  We went to one of those buffet things, and it was funny because my brother gets the same kind of food he used to get when he was a kid.  Catfish, macaroni and cheese, fried potatoes and spaghetti.  He's a cornball.  He starts school on Monday and is taking Theater, Comp 2, Piloting 2 (he gets to fly more) computer science, general math and economics.  Damn!  Thats alot of freaking classes.  I am sure he will drop one though, for the sake of his own sanity.    BTW - what is up with dudes being able to look grungy and no one thinks twice about it, but a girl does it and shes fucked!  My mom today for instance - i am just wearing my hair up, no makeup, tshirt and jogging pants.  my brother looks like he hasn't shaved in three days, has done nothing with his hair and is wearing pretty much the same clothes as me - but my mom tells me  I  look bad today - like I didn't get enough sleep.  Well, mom I didn't - duh.  Do I ever?  I am convinced that even if I slept for 24 hours it wouldn't be enough.

      I am having an unusually quick day at work today. Unusual just recently actually. The numbers and phone calls started to slow down right after I left for surgery and haven't revived yet. That was two months ago! Anyways, my boss emailed me asking for some input on how to run our department more efficiently. I mailed her back basically saying - Teach Susan some fucking time management skills! To my shock - she listened! I didn't know it would be that easy! I enjoy being a lead - other than the screaming, whining customers I somtimes get.  I have found myself missing Shannon and Emily a ton lately. No one can obviously replace them and I am quickly finding no one can substitute them either. I spend a lot of time at home. I wish they would come back to me :( My boyfriend has been great though. He has been very supportive during this time in my life because he knows how hard it was on me when they moved.  My roommate of course is still driving me nuts. He is so full of himself I can hardly stand it. Sometimes when he is talking to me I feel like I can't breathe. Kinda ridiculous I know, but its true. When he is extremely high and CAN'T talk very well is the only time I want to be around him - as long as he is not talking about himself I'm good.

      I am writing a story - when I can - and here is the first part.  Lane,   No one ever said life was going to be easy.  However, I believe it is.  I think it is humans that complicate things.  My roommates are straight out of a reality show.  I feel like I am sucked in by their need for attention at all times.  Who are these people really?  Do they even know?  I don’t think that they can even fathom what the real world is like, much less live in it.  Understandably, they think that this, all of this is real.  It’s not.  It can all end in a second.  The only thing that is real is the constants – our bodies, our emotions, our families.  Even those things aren’t forever.  Forever is our legacy and the stories we leave behind.  That is why I am determined to make my mark.  That is why I am here.  Before I end my life, I want it to be worth ending. With adoration, Kalli   Dana Peterson walked into the grocery store on a Sunday afternoon, not realizing that her life would soon completely change.  Everything that she had ever known about love and hate would soon take a spin.  She grabbed a cart and pulled out her list, determined to make this a 15 minute trip.  As she was gunning for the dairy aisle however, a young man stopped her to ask her if she knew where the customer service counter was.  In her haste, she waved her hand and moved on.  Dana grabbed her milk and finished off her list when she noticed something incredibly strange.  The store had gone quiet.  She pushed her cart to the front, the sound of her shoes and the one squeaky wheel of her cart the only sounds piercing the still air.  As she reached the front, the young man from before looked over at her and nodded.  Before she could stop him he grabbed a handful of her hair and forced her head back.  “This is her Marky!”  His scruff voice bounced off the walls of Dana’s head.  “You just couldn’t be bothered to help me out, could you bitch?” he growled into her ear.  “Please – I’m sorry – just please don’t.”  Dana was determined not to cry in fear, but the pain from her head was forcing tears to her eyes.    “Shut the fuck up!”  A loud voice screamed from the front of the store.  “Shut up your fucking whining bitch!  Rob – bring her up here. “  Robb began forcing Dana to the front.  Marky stepped behind the counter he had been pacing in front of and forced the young girl that had been hiding to stand up.  “Take me to the safe, cunt.”  “I don’t know – I don’t know what you mean!”  she stammered.  Dana saw the young girls head explode at the exact time she heard the gunshot.  People immediately started screaming.  Crying.  Children hugging onto their parents.  Lovers clinging to each other for possibly the last time.  Everyone trying to make their peace with God, or bargain with him.  “Is there anybody else that will not cooperate?”  Marky shouldered his rifle as he spoke, daring anyone to speak.  Dana knew she was going to die at that moment.  The look in his eyes was too cold, too hollow for a human.  He wasn’t alive.  He was already dead and was taking everyone with him.  “You – you take me to the safe.”  An older man, presumably the manager stood up and quickly walked to the safe and proceeded to open it.  To Dana’s surprise there were stacks and stacks of bills inside.  Dana looked around again, head still being held back by Rob.  He smelled of kerosene and ashtrays.  She locked eyes with a young girl in her late teens.  She was a cute girl, with a short ponytail, jeans and a t-shirt.  They smiled at each other and Dana wished she could hold her until it was her time.  She wished she could tell her it was all going to be okay and not to worry.    Dana knew that it wasn’t going to be okay though.  She knew she needed to worry.  She looked over at Rob.  “Before you kill me, please tell me why you would want to do this?”  She knew she shouldn’t have said this as soon as it came out of her mouth.  “Oh, baby, I’m not going to kill you.  I’m going to make your life as miserable as possible.  I am going to hurt you in ways you will remember for the rest of your life.  I am going to leave you with a scar – something that you can see everyday.  Just so you can think of me and my brother here every day for the rest of your life.”  Dana closed her eyes and tried to breathe as normally as she could.                                        **************************************************** Kalli,                                      To imagine my life without you for the next year seems pointless.  I won’t imagine it.  All I see for my future is dark.  The only thing I can see, the only thing that is able to let me endure your absence, is your face.  Your dark eyes and sharp nose.  Your dimple.  Your curly hair and the way you tuck it behind your ear before you kiss me.  Your kiss.  Your soft lips whispering to mine what only you and I know.  Our souls are one.  I have only known you for a short period of time – you know me less than anyone else that is around me.  For some reason though, you understand me more than anyone I have ever met.  Until that day, Lane    Marky dumped the money into a plastic sack.  “Rob – bring that bitch to me.  Shoot the rest.”  Rob forced her into Marky’s arms and Dana watched Rob in horror.  “No – Stop!”  she screamed out – reaching for her teenagers outstretched hand as the girl’s arm was blown off.  The impact of the bullet and the scream of the young girls pain threw Dana back into Marky’s arms.  She tried to shield her face.  “No – Do not cover your face.  I want you to see.  See what YOU have done!”  Dana didn’t understand what he was talking about.  He jerked her head around so she could watch the insanity in front of her.  Her teenager was no longer looking at her.  She was staring at her bloody stub, screaming for mercy.  Rob reloaded.  She knew what was coming but still tried to stop him with her hands.  Everything from her shoulders up disintegrated.  Dana felt as though she was going to fall, but Marky was there to catch her.    Dana stared at the floor where a few minutes before the teenager had been smiling at her, and Dana had the desire to comfort her.  What was she thinking those last few minutes?  Dana searched among the blood and bone and her eyes settled on some hair.  Hers.  That was all that was left of her that Dana could recognize.  “Look here Ms. Peterson!  Who should I do next?  Maybe him!”  He grabbed a boy by the collar, no more than 10 years old.  He had wet himself in fear.  His mother screamed in agony, begging Rob to stop.  “Don’t ask me to stop you filthy cunt!  Ask that whore!  Ask her, beg her for your little boys life!”  Rob forced the mother to stand as well and pushed her towards Dana.  “Why are you doing this to me,”  Dana cried.  “Six years ago, you were a juror for my brothers case and my family begged you to spare my brothers life.  None of you listened and now he is dead.  Guess what?  DNA tests came back and he wasn’t the fucking killer!  Just like we told you in the first mother fucking place!  Do you remember?  Tell me you fucking remember!”  Marky’s spit flew at Dana and all the contempt he had felt for this woman for the past six years gushed out of him.  “Six years ago I was 19!  I was a kid!  I just did what everyone else said!”  She remembered every detail of that day, the other jurors, the look on the boys face when the sentence was read, and now, she remembered Rob and Marky.  “My brother is dead because of you.  Now you get to see what it feels like to have someone die in front of you.  To have someone take something from you that you can never get back.”  Marky held up his gun and blew a hole in the mothers chest, with the little boy soon to follow. Lane,   My life is starting to make less sense than ever before.  Maybe because before I left for this place, you were my life.  Without you, my life isn’t anything but motions.  I don’t feel pain, or sorrow, or misery.  I still feel your heartbeat.  I still feel you alive inside of me.  Sometimes I don’t though.  And it scares me.  I lay in bed and I can’t hear your thoughts and I sit up in bed and cry until it comes back.  I know you say goodnight to me every night.  Your presence is around me and in me and touches everything that I do, say, feel and see. Yours,Kalli   Groaning, Dana tried to roll over, but couldn’t move.  She opened her eyes and looked around.  She couldn’t exactly make out what that was in her arm.  She tried to reach for it, but she seemed paralyzed.  She started screaming, the image of her teenager coming back to haunt her.    “Hey, quit moving!  Shut up with that fucking screaming!”  Marky leaned over and grabbed something out of a metal lunchbox.  “Here, this should shut that hole of yours up.”  Dana felt something cold go into her arm and her mind began to cloud.  She could see a tunnel in front of her.    “Stupid bitch bit me before she passed out in there, dammit.”  Marky popped open a beer as Rob stepped on the gas of their van.

       urlLink    I went to high school with the two guys in the front, Nick and Tyson.  Nick was always a little punky and into music - I can remember him playing drums in band.  Tyson I don't know much about except he was kinda preppy.  I feel sorry for Nick's mother - his sister is in prison for conspiracy to commit murder or some shit, and he is in a famous band.  Two extremes - not something that happens everyday.&nbsp; urlLink

        I have a friend - or at least I thought he was one of those.  I don't really know what that means anymore.  I thought it was someone you can trust.  Lately though, I am suspicious of everyone.  There is a guy at work that I really enjoy talking to.  He is brutally honest and unlike anyone else I have ever met.  He is one of the first people to not make fun of me for a being a little different or a little blonde sometimes.  What I thought was clicking was obviously something different - he was great for a week or two - and then he completely changed.  He reminds me of Oklahoma weather.  He hardley talks to me anymore and when he does, its nothing.  The whole thing was never really romantic - I just wanted someone to talk to.  Obviously, he didn't want that.  I can't wait to get out of this fucking town.  Its ridiculous here.
