      Yes that's right! You all hear me! The website is almost completely up and ready for viewing, I actually managed to get the template to work, along with other files... I still need to add the comic as well. I won't give the link yet, but just you wait guys! Ta-ta!

      Ack not literally, I mean giving birth to a website! >_ I already have it up and running, but I still need to make the template and whatnot. Kinda hard. It took me 2 hours just trying to figure out how I can add some codes to my website, and what the heck an FTP is. I'm still a tad stumped actually, sorta need help. A friend offered help, but in order to edit the website you  need  the  FTP  program. Isn't that a booger? Didn't want him to download it neither, too much of a hastle. ^ ^; Anyway! The forums are up... actually they've been up... should I give the link to my fellow readers? Or should I tempt you all... hmm. I'll go with tempting you. It's looking pretty good, I'm a first timer too so don't bite me once you see everything!

      GAH! I finally got it! Wow I'm so happy!  Only... it doesn't really work. -_-    &nbsp; It may take 2 to 5 days before your account becomes visible via ftp or http.&nbsp; Until then you may not be able to reach your comic's sitename, and your password and account may not work properly.   See that?... Uhhh.  Evil account. Atleast I got it! After like a week. Though now I'll have to wait longer than that for it to  actually  work. Damnut! This is what I get after trying to login:   If you see this message, it means you have entered an incorrect password, but the form is working    Curses! Oh well, I'll have to scan my comic later anyway. ^_^

       urlLink http://www.xanga.com/AdiOpERsOcoM   The music there is making me feel so good... and at the same time kind of sad. Especially with the recent post there. Anyway, the scanner works, but I have yet to scan the comic, and then color it. You guys might have to wait a while longer... I get the website tomorrow *throws arms up in the air*, but I still have to create it's template/layout. You can all wait right? Who is   all   anyway? What if no one even read this? O_o Haha funny thought. Leave comments if you want, I enabled guest comments.

      And it does. I tried joining, and it said that my I.P. address was banned... I never even joined the place before! It said that maybe there is someone else with the same I.P. as mine... but how is that possible? I need help guys. ._. I was looking forward to joining too, to submit my creations and all there. Oh well. Going to dance practice for the first time since June, what a gleeful day. I've missed practice, and&nbsp;today we all return and learn new dances. Yayness. :D Gotta go and see what I can do about Devian Art... Peace!! &nbsp;

      Curses of a million  curses!!!!!!!!!    Nooooo damnut!   I just had to delete a cute little picture I drew in the oekaki board.  It was a picture of Jan holding a refreshing drink. Like soda.  That stinks!! I drew her so well too, one of&nbsp;my best oekaki creations ever. Curses! Gah!!  *ahem*  Sorry for that, I had to stress about it, people are like that sometimes no? Oh well, I'll just have to make her better next time. That's right! Much,  much  better.  As for the comic, I have news for all of you simple and nonsensical little characters out there:  My scanner is busted.  But it's okay! I don't get my website 'till 4 days hopefully.  Thus! Meaning my comic's debut!  Simple Nonsense ! *audience applauds*  You can all see I'm very excited, I really can't wait, I've been working on it for days, brainstorming ideas and story lines. It should be awesome.  Truly!  So my loves, I have to go to my friend's house, must get ready!  &nbsp;

      Fudgers. I can't post a picture here. Atleast I think not. But go here anyway: &nbsp;  urlLink http://chugworth.com/  &nbsp; 'Tis a very good comic indeed. It has inspired me. I look forward to seeing new ones!! This dude's got a talent hmm? Now I really have to use my own original characters to make a comic! &nbsp; The name of the comic shall be  Simple Nonsense , it's self explainatory. Basically, you imagine simple nonsense am I right? It's nonsense, that's it. That's all you have to imagine. I have yet to actually make a story... I don't think I will, the whole comic is better off with  Jan ,  Remy , and  Mace  [possibly I'll add another character later] and their misadventures in life. &nbsp; I'm excited, I can't wait until I launch it... my scanner isn't really working though... and photoshop is 'uninstalled'. Crudders. I think my brother uninstalled it. Talk about perfect timing. &nbsp; Look forward to it guys!! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      That's right my loves!  I am officially 17 years of age since the 7th, granting me the priveleges of walking into rated R movies without a hastle of "You need an adult of atleast 18 years to accompany you." legally, saying that I'm almost 18, and reading Seventeen magazine [legally as well].  Of course!! Along with many more free opportunities... that I can't remember right now.  And money! I have like 110 dollars worth of... well money. I can buy anime, and games darnit!! And $60 worth of Ross clothes!! Or any other things there! I shall pre-order Tales of Symphonia like I said I would damnut! I can't wait for all of those constant hours of gameplay, glued to my seat [or bed] just gawking at the graphics [I can be a graphics freak] and storyline... atleast... I HOPE the storyline is worth it!  Peace then, I'm growing tired of updating my online journals, especially since I have 3!! Yes that's correct. Three marvelous online journals.  Goodnight, have a wonderful day [today]!
