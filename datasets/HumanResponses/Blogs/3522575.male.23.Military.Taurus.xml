      my day took a horrid turn i wished pain and suffering upon every one i saw the malice i felt just wasn't getting instilled no one felt the fear  of my presence thus infuriating me all the more i tell you  i wanted to spit fire chew glass and radiate lava  now i type and now  i feel better but soon  it'll all be over i'll be home  and my days of service  will be a distant nightmare nothing to be proud of nothing to look back on i will turn my back and the only thing  i'll keep with me  is the friends i've made some brave enough  to try to cheer me up

      today has been a great day and its only 10:04am i witnessed something beautiful  this morning at 05:00am we were all brought outside  to fill lovely sandbags well i look around and it's not just lower ranking individuals it happens to be everyone if you were in the 615th this morning you had to fill sandbags now can any of you imagine what its like to see some of the laziest high ranking individuals doing lower enlisted work? i've never heard so much bitching and complaining in my life but it was very satisfying

      so last night while waiting on the airstrip for his flight, dyer witnessed a mortar hit the air field approximately 40 feet away from where he stood.  two minutes later, the aircraft touched down just long enough to pick the soldiers up and fly them away.  it is a miracle he was able to get on the shinook to fly home.  he truly is lucky.  i guess that was the insurgents way of saying "have a nice flight".  i'll bet this is the best time he'll ever have seeing his family and his dog, dingo.

      did i ever mention  how beautiful  you are? do i show it often enough? at times the words  are just too much but everything about you makes life  easier to live the pain of day to day is pacified by your gentle touch and the way you smile even the garbage is more fun  to take out  when you tell me to especially after  the forth time i don't know what i'd do if i didn't  have you  and like it or not you feel the same

      hello everyone today is saturday and the warden (sgt dyer) and i don't really have anything going on so we decided to just take it easy.  tomorrow is our "day off", if you can call it that.  we get one day off per week.  my day off will be spent in my commo shop because i can be online and doing online things.  if i sit in my trailer, chances are someone will come and pull me out and have me do something totally unrelated to my day off, like work.  well, to hell with that i say.  its better to look like you're doing something then people can't say anything.  ha, i think i finally have this army thing down, so i should just re-enlist for another 17+ years.  or i could just hit myself in the head with an antenna until    well that's better.  you guys have to hand it to me, i'm pretty funny, given my whole situation and all.

      so here i sit waiting for anyone to get online so i can IM them how horrible is my life?  it's thursday and it's almost nine o'clock and here i sit by myself typing.  nope no one has signed on yet.  i'm stuck reading away messages.  pitiful i tell you.  oh well, so i'm leaving now to go back to my room and sulk cause no one who has the first name of stephanie is on line right now.  so good night to all and just do your best to feel guilty that no one was online tonight.  "i'm just going to throw myself down the stairs!"

      first things first my connection really sucks so i am not always able to check my email sorry second thing i'm never coming back to america iraqis are much better entertainment than americans except a few on both sides anyway, i had a good day with the iraqis, i bought a hippie drum off of one of them.  now dyer and i can sit on the floor and have drum circles.  but seriously, it sounds great and it was cheap, can't beat that.  so yeah, home in august, i don't know what i'll do with myself.  i'll be cold.  thats about it.  i am trying to write but it's just not coming.  hey even bush has bad days, i'm sure.  haha.  maybe tomorrow on my day off i'll try again.  but, i love you all, you're always on my mind.  not all of you at once (that would classify me as crazy) but you take turns.  even if you don't think i don't, trust me.  you are the reason i'm here, i want to defend your freedom!  you were all in jeopardy before i got here!  didn't you know?  i'm the reason you're all still alive!  weapons of mass destruction!  go bush!  everyone of you are on my mind right now.

      when i look around i see an existence, not a life.  it's like prison wih a paycheck.  basically, they give you money and use you for their petty issues, whether to boost image, or line their pockets.  i say it all comes down to penis-envy, while they compare lenth, children are growing up without fathers, and wives are forced to compensate for the lack of their husbands.  we are creating broken homes and broken people.  if you're willing to sell yourself, we've got a buyer.  sell your body, mind and soul to feed the neverending ministry of lies.  don't worry, we'll let you be in control of something, just to pacify your absence of self-worth.  if you take away the title and the paperwork life, you'll be left with very hollow people.  no one should need paperwork to prove they are worth the air they breathe.  but what the hell do i know?

      i figure its about time that people other than my close friends know how i got the name GRAYO.  well for the longest time my name was GRAVY, derived from GRAVEDONI.  understandable, right?  well, we (darren, dave, me, fili, etc.) started a band called the 8 balls, too young to know what that really meant, and we had to list all the people in the band.  ok, so the first few were legible but dave's hand writing was terrible.  i asked, who's grayo?  he laughed and said thats gravy!  it was by no means gravy.  he declared from then on, i was GRAYO.  no big story, i know, most people expect this extravagant tale.  sorry, it was just dave's bad hand writing.

      time slips past us  we don't think it does  until the time is up family members get older some get wiser but you can always count on them sure we all have our petty grievences but you know what i learned you can't get time back those times you were too busy  to visit those times you weren't into studying times where smoking cigarettes and drinking  was more important than working "i just don't have time" i'll get around to it well all of the time those people  were living too no they didn't forget about you they all still love you and will help you  you need them and they need you for whatever reasons you may have think about why you love them hell  some family i don't think i know anymore  i know the person they used to be  but not sure if i know the person they are now and when i get back  i'll waste no time getting to know them i've learned that life gets put into perspective when you don't know if you'll see tomorrow and petty grievences  are quickly not even noticed i wish i could put everyone i know in my shoes for one week let them see how precious relationships are how quickly they might be taken away then for the rest of your life  you keep thinking  what if... well the time is now before it's too late YOU CAN drop an email their way  or pick up the phone time isn't on anyones side you have to take charge before time is up this is life not the dress rehearsal you might not get tomorrow today may be your last day i don't fear death because i've made right with everyone but maybe some should  "today is the day that the Lord hath made, rejoice and be glad in it" i want everyone to think about that because someday it will hit you like a ton of bricks to all this applies thanks for sticking with me and thanks to stephanie for being there when i know she shouldn't have i've learned my lessons in life

      ok so the whole beheading thing is getting to me.  everyone is like ooohh, that's terrible, those people are monsters.  let me ask you this...how the hell did that steak get on your plate?  things a lot worse than beheadings got it there.  wait now, humans are way different than animals.  are they?  ok right, animals don't start wars, animals don't get drunk and beat their spouses, and animals take better care of themselves.  i'm not saying i'm a vegitarian, because i love a nice rare steak.  i am saying that animals are harvested (killed) in a much more inhumane way than people.  if you want a christian approach, didn't god breathe life into every living thing?  so my point is, don't be so sensitive to the wicked ways of the world.  i'll tell you the iraqi people have seen things like this their whole lives and not just on the internet or on tv, it happened to their family members in front of them.  see not all of the iraqi people are insurgents, the majority of them are much like us americans, all they want to do is make money off of the foreigners.

      so this morning i was eating breakfast and AFN (armed forces network) was showing the oprah show.  now i'm not a big fan, but something did catch my eye.  a woman was talking about how her dog attacked her son who was about five.  now i've seen children in action around pets, they hit, they pull on ears and tails and the like.  i was taught at a young age not to abuse animals because they could...suprise not enjoy it.  so when the animal got sick of this prepubesent monster, it resorted to nature.  as i see it, the fault lies in the parents, and i feel absolutly no remorse for the family in general.  call me cold hearted, but violence breeds violence.  furthermore if parents hugged their children once in awhile, our society wouldn't be so damn twisted as it is today.  maybe showing children affection might reduce the need for gangs and other criminal activity.

      do they know what you think? or do they want to? if it's too much for you sometimes how would they ever handle it your thoughts consume you  beat you and leave you for dead when you walk out the door you put on your happy face so they won't think you're weird pretend to be just like them pretend to have no brain  talk about the latest movie or rap song  don't speak your mind then they might get in just smile and shake their hand pretend to be their buddy and don't vomit on them they can't help it they just obey what the media  and the rest of tv tells them you feel sorry for them sheep doing as they're told that's not you though you're no sheep right?

      i was recently informed to take off the last blog  and you know what it isn't to censor myself but  to actually protect my loved ones i guess i do believe in the secret police and the thought police soon we will have a society  where no one knows the truth and no one will speak their minds hell iraqis found out how that works  as a matter of fact a man i work with was in the iraqi airforce and his friend told a joke which almost got him executed now i will relate this joke back to you all:  there was a dentist contest  there was one dentist and one patient  from every country there  and the winner was chosen by  who could extract a tooth the fastest  well the US won  and comming in dead last was iraq  the judge comes up to the dentist   who has his arm up the patients rectum  and asked what was he doing?  the iraqi dentist replied,  well, iraqis aren't allowed to open  their mouths. now you all my wonder why this officer in the iraqi airforce was almost executed  the only reason he is still alive is because of the fact he was a decorated war veteran and very high ranking now this is no surprise to most people  that's over there that's not here yes it is sadly enough if you want to read it  let me know i will email it to you

      "but we fooled em, didn't we bob?" that's a quote from the movie: 12 monkeys so yet another "thing" has been done to my mouth i just wasn't made to have a nice smile oh well i just don't care plus it kinda gives me character and if anyone has a problem with my mouth oh well  so i was thinking about things today and i remembered something from my childhood it goes something like this... HER MOMMY HEARD HER HOLLER  AND HER DADDY HEARD HER SCREAM WHEN THEY WENT UP TO HER ROOM  SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN AND THE GOBLINS'LL GETCHA IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT
