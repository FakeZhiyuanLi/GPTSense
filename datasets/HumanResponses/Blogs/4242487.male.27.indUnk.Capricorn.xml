       urlLink gi joe valor vs. venom movie trailer   do you remember when gi joe was cool?  a movie like this would have been so cool to me back in the day. what is with us twenty somethings getting so nostalgic over our 80's cartoon franchises? i like the rebirth of  joe  and the  transformers . i like the new envisioning of the  thundercats ...  ...but when are they going to bring back  m.a.s.k.  ?   m.a.s.k.  was some cool shit.

       this morning i got to work at about 8am, like i do most mornings. i missed work yesterday and sunday due to a strained neck and massive 3 day headache.    never fear, a heathly breakfast of percocet and pancakes has me driven to strive through what could have been another rough day.      getting into work after being away for two days can be a harrowing experience. thank the gods for outlook rules. 100 emails later, i waded through my unread mail only to find i had a slew of new bugs [the errors in games are called bugs, and it is up to the person assigned to fix them] to detail.      do you think anyone missed me?   ;)

       never really had a blog before. it will be fun to see where this takes me...      i decided to start up a blog while working on   halo 2   and finishing up my personal site. I have not had much time to complete my personal site because of my extremely taxing yet fun duties on   halo 2   production.      i hope to include my personal portfolio and other animation related material on my new website.       in the coming months you will hear a little bit about   halo 2   production and the crunchtime that we are in right now, all leading up to the games initial release -  november 9th .      during the downtime i have in october i will finally get my personal website togehter and replace this temporary blog with an actual site. i have the template down, i just need to sort out all the content.      i know quite a few people out there have been waiting for my personal site to come together, and have also been waiting for   halo 2  .      on  november 9th , you get both, not that you will care about this site with   halo 2   in your greasy fingers.      so stay tuned and i will see you online, here at  urlLink   bentllama.com    and on  xbox live  on  november 9th .      i cannot wait for both...      peace.
