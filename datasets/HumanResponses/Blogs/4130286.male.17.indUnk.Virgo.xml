      fingers locked, ill hold you close your hair's against my cheek it smells so good, in perfect prose your voice puts me to sleep. Id lie here forever, sleep to keep you here with me avoid the sunrise, the moons enough to keep your pale skin lit. If i only had a minute left id spend it on you. But, you've grown out of reach, the fairest flower, too high to bring you down. But i can wait til winter, when frozen petals fall.

      HOLY SHIT! I just got home from seeing the Exorcist: the beginning.  HOLY SHIT!(quite literally)  That movie was messed up.  It was cool though, it scared me a good bit.  I think the best line from the movie is, "Whats the matter Marin, don't you want to fuck me anymore!?" I took noel and ryan to see it. Noel says she loved it but im not sure. I know ryan liked it.  It was just completely ridiculous.  So much gore, and bloodshed.  Oh so many freaky weird things happened in it.  I was afraid to get out of my car when i got home, cuz i thought some damn wild dogs would come rip me to shreds.(you have to see the movie to know what im talking about)  If you want a good scare i recommend seeing it.  Although, its not for the weak stomached.  Yeah bowling was a lot of fun.  And, as i said, i suck at it.  Band always sucks.  The other part of my day was just a fairly normal one.  You said meet me with your eyes, you sing to me its harmony when you're staring into mine.                                                                                                                                                   -No Delay

      For all of this, im better of with out you. Do you regret, so, your loneliness?  I love that song by the early november.  It isn't on their album, but its on the Drive thru records dvd, and i think its on their ep.  Emma, im writing for you again damn it!  I even stopped playing my guitar to write.  Hmm, the only problem is i don't have much to write about!  I didn't do a durned thang today.  And i still haven't shaved.  I will tomorrow though, maybe not though, its kinda fun looking like a bum.   Carter the cat, carter the cat, everybody loves Carter the cat! sorry that is from the Drive thru records dvd.  Its quite comical i must say.  Lets see, tomorrow i get to go to my granny's house and move a bunch of boxes out of her garage and into her attic.  Then ive got marching band(oooyay!)  After band, im going BOWLING with ryan and others.(i suck a very insurmountable bit at bowling)  After that, im goin to see The Exorcist with noel i think.  Then ill come home, prolly sleep, then get up friday, do nothing, and then go to work for another 6-12 shift.(FUCK)  Oops, excuse my language. I really do hate that shift.   Ok kids, im not going to blab about nothing any longer.  yep. thats its.  PLEASE LEAVE ME A COMMENT! AS I DO LOVE READING THEM SO!

      Yeah, today 8 minutes from victory was a rockin'!  We played from 1 to about 4.  Then i had to get some food before marching band, so where did i go?                   TACO BELL           , of course!  Yeah i ate with brad, adam, and ryan. Timmy was there too for a little while.  Oh my god im starting to hate, absolutley hate, marching band.  For the last few practices which last a good two and a half hours, i only got to play for the last half hour.  The rest of the time i talk with heather.  Man, if heather weren't the drum major, id have no one to talk to.  Yeah, then i went to josh's house to watch the Drive thru records dvd, Spectacular Spectacular.  It's got to be some of the funniest stuff ive ever seen.  Tomorrow, i think im gettin my hair cut?  Im not sure.  Other than that, ive got nothing.  Itd be nice if someone would ask me to do somethin(wink wink).  But, i may just hang out here and finish up some work for my ap bio class. Goin ta see the exorcist:the beginning, this thursday night.  That better be really freakin scary, or else i may just stick some corn in the ears of the director.  Yeah, thats it. Not too much to talk about right now.     she wore crushed velvet, jet black, and to the floor.  she rode on angel's wings, that use to shine, oh so bright.  -hawthorne heights

      Lets see, today wasn't a very good day in my words.  I just sat around, i did take my brother to see a movie, but ive already seen it.  Well, for the most retarded reason in the world, Adam, my best bud, whom i said would definitely get hired at the theater, did not get hired today.  And do you want to know why? FUCKING MARCHING BAND!  Im so pissed at my manager and at band right now. Band gets in the way of almost everything.  That really sucks.  I was so excited too.  Adam says he's not too upset about it though, seeing as how he has a job right now.  But he does think that it sucks.   Ive been doing an awful lot of solo work on my bass lately.  I can only write songs on my bass when i have no intention of working together with another instrument.  Besides, its impossible to write songs like the ones that my bands play without a guitar or drums.  I love playing my bass.  And i think im pretty good at it, but i know there is a whole other level that i need to reach.  Of course, ill never be good enough for myself. But that isn't a bad thing.  OOyay! School stars in about two more weeks.  I kinda want to go back and see all of my friends that i haven't seen this summer, but i really don't want to have to deal with the work.  Especially with marching band, my job, and my bands.  I know ill do fine though, but i will get way stressed out sometimes im sure!  I would love to have a relationship with someone too, but my only prospectives right now seem to be either freshmen(no way!) or people who don't share enough of my views.  I can't help how picky i am, but i don't want to have bad consequences when a breakup will happen, which im sure will.  I just can't stand being alone like this all the time.  And im not talking about not having friends, ive got plenty!   Ive got practice with 8:fmv tomorrow! I can't wait. I love playing with that band so much. We always get stuff done.  We might record something, too.  Our drummer is awesome, and hes just a really cool guy.   Infilitrate. Destroy. Rebuild.

      Yeah...  Today is Sunday.  I've had to work all freakin weekend long, 12 hours didn't pass  between when i was at work and when i was home.  From 6 on Friday night to 6 today i worked.  I didn't get to do anything with any of my friends.  I tried to get a hold of a few people to go with me to see a movie tonight, but they were either doing something already, or i just couldn't get a hold of them.  I sat on my butt and watched Fosters' Home for Imaginary Friends for an hour on cartoon network.   There is a slight possibility that i will become an assistant manager at the theater.  Im not sure if i would do it or not.  I just remembered that i had a severe attack of hyperness last night.  Im very sorry to all the people that im sure i was annoying to a great extent.  See, when im hyper, im insane.  I should not be talked to at all.  I start saying ridiculous things that make very little sense. I am listening to this song from Hawthorne Heights whilst i write this, I loves it.  Hey there, I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all Where you are and how you feel with these lights off as these wheels keep rolling on and on Slow things down or speed them up not enough or way too much how are you when I'm gone And I can't make it on my own because my heart is in Ohio so cut my wrists and black my eyes so I can fall asleep tonight or die because you kill me You know you do you kill me well you like it too and I can tell you'll never stop until my final breath is gone Spare me just three last words I love you is all she heard I'll wait for you but I can't wait forever You kill me well

      im sure many of you have already read this but i think its hilarious.  True story, I was happy. My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me." I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family. "The moral of this story is:" "Always keep your condoms in your car."

I saw my cousins, i saw adam, i saw timmy, i saw Andrew's brother Devin,  i saw a couple teachers from school, im sure there were others too i just can't remember all of them.  YAY! Adam is gonna get hired at the theater for sure!  Hmmmm... i can't think of anything else to say.  Eat some cake then sleep it off!  Drink a bottle of syrup and tell me how it feels! Im just yelling nonsense about food! Make some noodles and feed them to a turtle!   Ok, im done.

      Alien vs. Predator... that was a very cool movie.  It was reminiscent of the older alien and predator movies.  However, there a few things that i didn't like about it, but i suppose it made the movie better in a way, more like the other ones.  It had an interesting story line, not quite what i had expected and i was happy about that.   Yeah, i got up at 12:30, ive got work tonight from 6-12.  yeah, nothing really to write about...  maybe ill write something when i get home from work.  every time the sky breaks open with sunshine, as streamin swords collide it take me back in time...

      Hey, this has to be short.  Had band practice with brad and timmy today, it went well, til his mom needed him to take her to the hospital.  I went to taco bell with adam, oh so fulllll...  Band sucked (did i need to say that?) Went to Bob Evans with heather and jeremy after, that was fun. When i got home, my mom told me that one our friends' friends (basically, our friend) died in a house fire last night.  That makes me very sad.... I still can't believe it....  Ok, time to go see Alien vs. Predator at 12. ... cya

      Was today one day, or two? I had a urologist appointment this morning. Im thoroughly frightened of old men touching me in my special places. Ewww, creepy. My appointment was like most these days, "Well, if you get any more pain come back." I'm sick of not getting any satisfying answers from my doctors. If anyone wonders why i went to the "pee doctor" its because i had kidney stones about a month ago. Ohhhh they are so painful. Blarney stone. mmmmm. I sat in a brand new corvette today. wow. I want it.  Well, for those concerned, and i know there are few who are, Im not depressed. I just feel like something is missing. I feel hollow. Won't someone please fill me up, with imaginary happiness... sorry i was just digressing.  EMMA, YOU ARE A COLD HEARTED BITCH!!! ( no just kidding!)

      im slowly sinking into a frame of mind where I am nothing, was never anything and where true love is hard to find. I’ve got stuck in my head, last times together when you were you, where I was me and our time spent felt like forever.  My empty bottle, broken in two right down the middle the right half for you the liquid inside was blood from my heart but a broken bottle, for me, holds no part    Umm, i had no motive to write this. Why did I? Who knows? Well it was late. I think ive gone crazy with this idea that im becoming depressed. What have i to be depressed about? Just one thing, and i don't think i need say what it is.

      Ok damn it, im writing something for you!  Woke up, got outta bed, dragged a comb across my head. -The Beatles.  Hmmm what did i do today?  I cleaned my kitchen and bathroom, they were dirty and disgusting.  I pretty much just sat around today and watched the rain, and thought about everything that's been goin on in my life.  Band was dull, i think i played for a total of one half hour during the two and a half hour practice.  A bunch of people went to TACO BELL after band.  Ryan, Adam, and Brad tried to rape me.  Brad called his girlfriend, and we passed the phone around and said stupid stuff.  Then we called Carl, and annoyed him just as much as he annoyed us.  Now im home.  I guess when i think about it, i really didn't do that much today.  But I had so much time to do stuff.  I should stop being so lazy.  The only problem is i hate doing things by myself and no one ever calls me up and says, "hey ya wanna do anything?"  Ah well.   I have an appointment with a urologist tomorrw.  I like to call him the "pee doctor," after that, who knows what im goin ta do.  Ive got work too.  I feel myself slowly sinking into a depression...  I'm oh so sick of being tired, and so tired of being sick...   -Taking Back Sunday

       Ok, I had a good day.  Today is the ninth of August, meaning that today is my brother's birhtday.  He turned 13.  I took him to a movie, he loved it.  I got new strings for my bass guitars.  I watched a Wildthings baseball game with my family.  How very straightforward I am being.  You know, thats a problem that i find with most people these days.  They can't put any color into their conversations or language.  This is especially relevant in people from this area.  All i hear all day is the same thing from different people.  I won't say that this applies to all people, but most.  Why doesn't anyone try to put some gusto into what they have to say.  I mean, you only get to live on this earth once, why not speak as if you were never going to speak again.  I guess what im saying is, i need to get away, see the world, meet new people, and live through some really good and bad times.  But, im not joining the army incase any of you had that your mind.  Why am i being so cynical today?  I have no idea.  I truly did enjoy my day of running around with my brother.  People say we look very much alike.  Well, WE ARE BROTHERS WHO SHARE THE SAME PARENTS!  Siblings usually do look alike you silly people.        I was eavesdropping on some kid at the guitar store today,  he was announcing to some girl who was maybe 3 or 4 years older than he that he knew everything about being vegetarian.  He was also reciting many useless things that no one cares about.  I sersiously wanted to talk to him, and tell him to shut up.  But instead i proceeded with the purchase of a set of strings for my bass, and the my prompt departure from the store.        Ok, well i think that's enough of my cynicism for one day.  Until next time, i'll see you on... the radio.      I've picked the best parts, and played them in my mind...

      I didn't think that i could ever get tired of working at the theater, but lately i'm becoming very fed up with it.  I can't stand the people that i have to deal with.  But oh well.  Today, an old lady came up to me after watching "The Village" and said to me, " sir, i am 67 years old, and that is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life," she then decided to tell the rest of the people waiting in line to see their movie how horrible "the village" is.  I wanted to kick her.  I mean, its mean to do something like that to an old lady but this one might have been an exception.  To boot, she wanted her money back after she had finished watching the movie, thats against theater policy( but my manager gave them re-admit tickets anyhow).  Then a little later, some freshmen from my school came to visit jered and followed him around for a little while then the cuter of the two decided that she would just wait for her friend, who followed jered every where he went while he worked, and talk to me.  Or rather flirt.  Oh, how i can't wait to go back to school, freshmen freshmen freshmen.  I understand why seniors hate freshmen so much now.   After work i came home, tomorrow is my brother's birthday so we had his party today.  My parents got him sirius satellite radio.  I am extremely jealous.  I didn't realize how cool satellite radio actually is.  No commercials, any kind of music you want whenever you want to hear it, and good songs are always playing.  No crap.   I started reading Dave Barry's "In Cyberspace," very very funny.  I didn't want to stop reading it last night, but it was about 2:30 in the morning and i was falling asleep.  Actually, it's kinda late right now so im gonna go and read it. Until next blog!  Three sleepless nights, this isn't how its supposed to be. But you're so good at taking your           time to get back to me...  -Emery

       Today was Saturday.  I had to work.  After work, Heather, Jon, Adam, and I went to pizza hut.  The waitress called us sweet heart, and hon a lot.  Now, I am home.  Woo.       There is a girl at the theather with whom i work, and i'm thinkin about asking her out. The only problem is, I'm not sure if i want to or not.  As ive said before, all my relationships last about a week.  I don't know, maybe I'll ask her, maybe i won't.  I would like to get to know her better though, she seems like a fun person. (Oh and those damn freshmen marchers were at the theater today.  I wish they would let me be.)      Trinty High Marching band makes fun of McGuffey High Marching Band.  They can now eat my shorts.  I have only respect for those marchers who i know.  And we thought they liked us.      I'll float away... to another place.

      I AM SO TIRED! Today i got up at 5:30 and went to Kings' family restaurant for a breakfast with my fellow seniors from marching band. I ate way too much, including tons of ice cream. Band doesn't start til 8:30, so a group of us went to Wally mart and steph came up with the idea to buy some mice and name them after a few of the band directors. It was fun. I'm so happy that Steph and I are on talking terms now, everything is starting to seem like it was a very long time ago, about this time of year last year.  But i don't want anyone to get the wrong idea.  I don't feel like things will ever be the same as they were, and i don't expect them to be. Band sucked as usual.  I've been listening to a band named Emery for a few days, and i can't stop listening to them, and the lyrics make me think a lot about many things. When i listen to Emery, I just want to lay down on the grass and watch the clouds fly by. But, the music would be better if I had someone to listen to it with.  Well, my fear of little freshmen girls having crushes on me is real. One of the color guard girls, named Chloe, is "interested in me." I'm not quite sure how i feel about it. I mean it's cute, but i like girls who are either my age or older because of their level of intellectuality. Young girls just don't seem to have this extremely important quality, but maybe i'm wrong. Who knows?  I finally finished "Go Ask Alice" last night. That book is purely amazing. I practically cried after i finished. God, I must be the most sensitive guy in the world. I can't stop thinking about it. Emma, you need to suggest things to me more often.  Lastly, in my long day, Adam, Noel, and I went to Taco Bell. Then i had to work from 6-12(which sucks so much) And now I'm writing this at 1 in the morning, Saturday. I should go to sleep now. So, til next blog, Go fuck yourselves San Diego.

      Woo, fun, another day full of band, however, today was the nicest day we've had since band camp started. As I was playing my bass some clouds were moving across the sky so i watched as they blocked out the sun. (i was wearing sunglasses of course!) I thought to myself, "Gee, I haven't seen something as wonderous as this event for some time, I should really pay closer attention to the majesty of nature," it gave me quite a content feeling that I haven't experienced for some time. I forgot all about any troubles I've had recently. This event of a saphire sky, white globe and frail, wispy pale clouds and dark purplish cloud foreground grinding against the warm sun rays creating such an awesome display of light and shadow enstowed within me a feeling that i've been yearning for for quite some time. I realize now that i really do take much of life's treasures for granted, and so do many other people. I know i'm a freakin' hippy, but wouldn't people be happier and wouldn't they get along better if they could feel the way i felt today. These are the things that i think about when no one else is looking, these are the things that help me sleep at night, these are the things that keep me moving in the morning, and that is why i carry on. Ok the weirdest thing happened too, during the time that i have been writing this, someone who i haven't had a conversation with for several months tells me that we should talk sometime, but then says nevermind. Can anyone explain this to me? I wish people didn't hate me so much sometimes, I don't understand it.  what a beautiful color, it goes with your eyes....

      It was a long day. Band from 8:30 til 5, then Not Yet practiced at Josh's house after from about 6 til 9:30. I'm losing hope in that band, no one can ever stay focused long enough to write anything, and then someone always ends up disliking something about the song. Oh, and Derek decided to just disappear without a trace and not call us. I hate to say it but i'm gettin a little tired of playing my bass, but of course i still love it to death. Brad let me borrow the Emery cd which kicks total ass. I found my favorite lyrics of all in the song "The Ponytail Parades" the chorus is "It doesn't feel right, holding someone else's hand. Spending the whole night, living at two opposite ends." The song really gets to me, it makes me want to cry sometimes. I wish i could find a love like the one sung about in that song. I'm such a wuss.  hmmm.... Josh, I'M NOT A VEGAN!

        So, now that i have one of these blog thingies, i can spill everything ive wanted to say without saying it directly to anyone.  I like this.  So far this summer has been too quick, with far too few happy moments.  I had a couple relationships, both of which lasted about a week, one was more serious than the other.  I'm not sure if I'm going to try and have another one, since they all seem to last about a week.  Somehow, something never works, no matter how hard i would like to work on a relationship.  I may just as well wait for college.  My friend Brad and i started a new band today, it's the best band i've been in to date. The four of us, Brad, Timmy, Mike, and I clicked really well.  We got about 5 ideas for songs within about two and a half hours.  The other band im in is good too, but we can't seem to stay focused since we all love a different style of music, but im not giving up on them seeing as they are a few of my best buds.  My dear friend emma is, im afraid, slowly becoming like a character in a book that she has me reading.  It truly worries me. . .
