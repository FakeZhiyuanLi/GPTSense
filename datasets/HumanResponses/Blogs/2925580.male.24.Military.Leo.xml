      my poor little blog. it's brand new and i've already neglected it so. my bro, jon's, on the other hand is flourishing. it's taken me a while to submit to this blog mania. so many weirdos online, blabbing their whole lives to the world. you want to despise them, but then the call is just too seductive to resist. so, now i've joined those ranks, and this is already blog #4. one was simply not enough to document my rantings, i found. so, what is it about this blog thing? i know there are plenty of scholarly studies out there answering that question, but i'm too lazy to look them up and, at the end of the day, i don't really care. it is what it is. so, let's do a little electronic communication inventory: i have my message boards with friends and family, instant messaging, my cell phone, my list-serves, email, and now this. i think the appeal is in the journaling quality of the blog. i mean, you can rant as long as you want and who cares because, ultimately, it's your blog and you can do whatever the hell you want with it, right? then i have my real journals, i don't think i'll ever be able to give those up. and i write for a living. so, it's safe to say that i spend most of my life writing. i remember once i was at a newsroom meeting at the paper i was writing for at the time and we had to all go around the room and tell everyone what our hobbies were (one of those phony efforts management occasionally made to "foster a sense of community" in the newsroom). anyway, when it got to me, all i could think of to say for my hobby was "writing." there was silence for a minute and some weird looks and then on to the next person ("rock climbing," "making papier mache gift boxes," blah, blah, blah). i guess i wasn't supposed to write as a job and then write for fun. oh well. a retired english teacher who ended up oddly enough as a student in one of my writing classes told me that nothing destroyed a writer more than being a journalist. i think she might have been right. but anyway, what am i talking about? i'm just ranting and blabbing as i promised i would. isn't this where i should start disclosing my life history and heartaches and sexploits? i was thinking about the appeal of the blog and how that differs from keeping a physical journal. obviously, the public aspect of it. so does that makes us all a bunch of exhibitionists and voyeurs?

      i'm sick and it really sucks. :(   i knew this was coming. tuesday night i listened to  urlLink andrea bocelli's "rapsodia"  over and over again, singing in italian and crying my eyes out. crying, as you may or may not know, lowers your immunity, and i knew this but it was somewhat enjoyable so i indulged.   the next day, my neighbors downstairs moved out (i'm quite happy about it as their chain smoking wafting into my windows was fucking annoying) and i had a sore throat and beginnings of a cold.   so here it is friday and i feel like crap. all i can do is stumble around the house lugging a box of tissues with me and feeling too tired to do anything constructive.   it's also the last day of my spring break. :(  i've almost forgotten being in school and kind of decided that i want to ditch it for my new hobby of knitting. my whole life i have wanted to knit, and last week i found a little shop that specializes in knitting needles and yarn and such and i spent hours there picking out a yarn (color: breeze, fabric: cotton, wool, lycra) and some big, fat, wooden knitting needles!! i'm making a scarf, or a shawl, or a small hand towel. i'm not really sure what it will be, but what i do know is that i love knitting!!!!   i have a life to-do list and knitting was on it. now i can cross it off. :)   i love lists. i spend a significant amount of my time making them. here's the one i made for spring break:  1. look into funding for fall semester (haven't done. too boring.) 2. have dinner with friends (this weekend) 3. spend time with sis (had dinner together) 4. go to yoga studio (haven't done. too many of them, i don't know where to start, too expensive for my student budget. sigh.) 5. meditate (haven't done properly. too hyper.) 6. print latest lists (i print my lists and keep them in a binder. haven't done yet.) 7. catch up on reading for school (haven't done yet.) 8. catch up on calls/letters/emails (almost finished.) 9. send book proposal to publisher (nope.) 10. file papers in office (nope.) 11. plan new schedule (done!) 12. pretend i'm a tourist and explore my city (done) 13. see a movie (done. saw  urlLink "fog of war."  it won this year's best documentary, but i thought it would never end.) 14. read  urlLink "vein of gold"  (am currently reading. i love this author, julia cameron. she also wrote  urlLink "the artist's way,"  which i highly recommend to anyone who wants more out of life. when i read this book 6 years ago i was miserable, working in a job i hated and wondering how i ended up there. the book was magic! after i read it, i dropped the career i hated, moved to europe, became a journalist, started grad school and began my "real" life. which i like. most days. :))

      yikes, over a week has gone by and i haven't posted an update on my spring break frolicking! now, that just ain't right. don't hate me, those of you who are experiencing frost and snow, but today is a beautiful sunshiney day complete with blue sky, singing birdies, and cherry blossoms! it's 70 degrees farenheit out there (celsius people will have to figure that out--i can't do the math)! absolutely lovely. the epitome of spring, i must say. so what the hell am i doing in here in front of a computer screen? well, it turns out that i spent the first week of what i thought was my spring break finishing up a project for work. then, today, i found myself in the library at the shocking hour of 10 a.m. after a 9 a.m. meeting with one of my profs. (i have to add here that the library was deliciously silent and empty and i am toying with the idea of planning my work schedule to incorporate the "closed" times such as summer, spring break, and winter vacation. i love having all the books to myself!!! and all the desks! and all the comfy reading spots! but then when would i enjoy some time off? maybe never. time off makes me anxious. i forget who i am and why i'm here on this planet, hehehe). so, after i picked up some reading material (howard rheingold's "virtual community," in case you were wondering. oh, how eerily appropriate. . .!), i had lunch at an outdoor cafe near the water, and headed back here to work. after some thoughtful reflection, i think i've reached the conclusion that there's no real point in having spring break unless i'm lying on a beach somewhere.

      ok. this is just too funny to hide in the comments section and taking inspiration from shelby's must read post in today's  urlLink one girl show  in which she takes on a poster, i have to elaborate on some of joel's comments re: martha stewart. besides his woeful waffling on the subject, joel has made several references to "Mrs T" and "the pokey," as the following excerpt illustrates:  "Those goons upstate should not be getting Martha's raspberry truffle cheesecake or broiled cornish hens. I am sorry but that is not justice. The woman should be revered for her wholesome dishes, not  banished to cuddling with Mrs T in the pokey  [italics mine]. It is a sure sign of anarchy when someone as rich as Martha cannot break a law or two without having to fear the consequences. Damn the man--let Martha go free to bake another day."  later he reversed his position as the following excerpt reveals:  "That goon Martha should not get away with diddling the little man just because she can bake a cheesecake or broil a hen. The fact that she can cook shouldn't mean that she won't have  to cuddle with Mrs. T in the pokey  [italics mine]. It is a sure sign of anarchy when the rich and famous do not have to fear the same consequences that the rest of us do. Damn the man and screw the rich bitch."   although his disrespect for martha is clear, it was his repeated references to mrs. t and the pokey that i found puzzling. when i questioned him, i received this reply:  "To answer your questions, Mrs. T is my version of a female Mr T (from the 70/80's series the A team) and "pokey" is British jargon for prison. But where, you will ask in your next post, did the word "pokey" come from. Well, I'm happy that you're so curious. We're all familiar with the situation of hanging out with our buddies when all of a sudden a police cruiser is seen heading our way. What is the natural reaction? Of course, someone whispers, "Quick, it's the po po. No, don't look at him!! Just act normal." It is possible--though not altogether likely--that our funny-accented European island dwellers' term for prison was derived from our slang reference to the officers of peace (or perhaps it simply was derived from "police" but who really cares?)."  joel, you are a certified NUTTER!! hehehehehe. btw, you don't have to explain to me what the a-team is--i was watching original episodes when you were still in diapers! (the series aired from 1983-1987, NOT during the 70s!)

      [jon, it's good to see you're back. try not to have such long lapses between posting next time! hehehe.] thought i'd take a break from what i'm supposed to be doing (i.e., working) to make sure my post is first once again. spring break is next week and i'm bemoaning the fact that i'm trapped out here on the left coast. it seems like everyone around me is going on exciting excursions--visiting china, conducting fieldwork in afghanistan or going skiing in colorado. i feel a bit inferior that i'm just planning to hang out in my apartment cleaning out my files, pitching my thesis to publishers, sleeping too late and generally loafing about. doesn't it seems like i should be chasing yaks in mongolia, learning muscogean in oklahoma, or (my favorite) practicing stillness of mind at a yoga retreat in costa rica? something of that nature anyway. oh well. i'll be sure to post the exciting details of my spring break here. stay tuned. ;)

      Ok, so after I hit refresh about 30 times to try to comment to Deb's post, I gave up and decided to comment via a post of my own (yes Deb, I know I can only do this because you have, in your infinite wisdom, allowed me to).  :)  I think it is despicable that anyone would think of sending poor Martha Stewart to jail for 20 years.  What the hell kind of country is this, anyway? I agree with Deb, in that if OJ's dumb A*S can get away with killing his druggie wife and boyfriend (hers, not his), Martha should be cut some slack. Of course it is wrong if she tried to make a few bucks on the side, but that is what fines and stuff are for.  Besides, OJ already proved that if you have enough money you can get away with damn near anything, and why should Martha be any different.  After all, I like her last name, but that is just me.  If people went to prison for being rude and demanding, I would be serving several consecutive life sentences.  Whew.... :)

      what kind of fucked up justice system would convict martha stewart and acquit oj??   i just don't get it. don't get me wrong, i don't especially like martha--to be honest, i blame her for adding more pressure to women when we're already overworked--but i don't think she deserves to go to prison for 20 years. she's a multi-millionaire, why would she lie to avoid losing a mere $50,000 in stocks? please. and anyway, isn't the whole fiasco her stockbroker's responsibility? if you want to know what i think (and even if you don't!), i think martha is innocent of wrongdoing and being made an example of because she has dared to be a successful businesswoman and a "bitchy" one at that. check this out from  urlLink fox's coverage :    "Stewart had a reputation before the trial as a ruthless businesswoman, and in court she was portrayed as rude, insulting, demanding and cheap. According to testimony, she once threatened to take her business elsewhere because she did not like her brokerage's telephone hold music."    so what?!! she should go to prison for this? is it a crime to be a "rude" and "demanding"? apparently in martha's case, yes.

      i heard the most amazing thing on the news last night--it seems john kerry has won the superbowl! no really, dan rather said it himself on cbs, so you know it must be true!! what an amazing individual, this kerry. surely such a remarkable feat makes him presidential material.    i have not left the house ALL day, but have sat either in front of this computer working or on the couch reading my boring-as-hell stuff for school (while watching tv of course--is there another way to study? hehehehe). i don't feel too bad about it since it was cloudy, rainy, and cold all day. i talked to one of my sisters on the phone twice, and one of my brothers once. i watched a half hour of "idol" and 15 minutes of "the o.c.," just to see what misha what's-her-name was wearing (tight, ultra-low rise khakis, sweater set, in case you were wondering. yawn.) gotta keep up with the pop culture, you know. i chatted with two friends online. i cleaned my kitchen. i made my bed. i planned my schedule for next week. i made a menu and a grocery list for next week. i ate some leftover stew and had a frightening choking spell while i was talking to my brother and eating at the same time. i made cookies. (well, i broke them off and put them in the oven. same thing.) i ate nine of them and packed the rest for lunch tomorrow. no, that's not ALL i'm having! i have a lovely organic frozen dinner to take with me as well. (there's something oxymoronic to me about microwaving an organic meal, but i can't think about that too much. my friend eddie refuses to eat anything organic as a matter of principle. i admire him for holding to his convictions, but i am still seduced by the label. sigh.)

      [what little comment did i make? :S don't worry, i won't delete your postings. that's what this blog is for, remember? to rant, and rant, and rant some more!! also, maybe you should be more selective about who you send your blog site to? just a thought! hehehehehe. . .]  now, on to me and what's been going on in MY world.   the last two days have been difficult. first that bitch larisa didn't pick brian on "average joe 2--hawaii," instead choosing dumb ass gill!! what the hell was she thinking?! i'm getting fed up with cynical network execs luring regular, good-hearted people on to their stupid reality shows just so they can break them down and send them home in tears in front of millions of viewers. if you don't know the plot, i'll briefly sum it up. a beautiful girl thinks she's on a reality show to meet the man of her dreams. she then is presented with a dozen or so "average joes"--fat, balding, dorky, just normal guys. she gets all pissed off but is forced to continue the show because she's signed a contract. so, she gets to know the guys and miracle of miracles, discovers that there's more to people than just good looks. like brains, and humor, and a personality that's more exciting than a door knob. oh yes, and jobs other than "underwear model" and "waiter." no offense to either, of course. just as she's having this epiphany, a dozen "hunks" are brought into the game. all, you guessed it, underwear models and waiters. and all with the personality of a door knob. the only highlight to this demeaning charade is that the joes really shine through as quality human beings, even as the show is trying to make them look like idiots. i watched to the end hoping that larisa would pick brian, who took her to fenway park in boston (one of the best spots on the planet, mind you) and told her he would always be by her side. she cried, kissed him passionately, and then broke his heart! bitch!! of course, i'm sure that brian isn't hurting for dates now that millions have seen the show, but it was just so mean-spirited. the message is that being good-looking gives you the right be break hearts and be an empty-headed asshole. the whole thing just pisses me off!!   on to today. . . some asshole woke me up at 4 a.m. revving his/her stupid car. the neighbors below slam their door every 5 minutes and smoke like fucking chimneys!!! i can even smell their fucking smoke when i'm in my bed. it's infuriating. i don't give a shit if people smoke as long as i don't have to smell it, but when i have to take medication to be able to breathe, it really FUCKING PISSES ME OFF!!!!!  (wow. this feels good. hehehehehe. i feel so much more relaxed now! :) this reminds me of a study i read that found that people with asthma or diabetes who regularly vented their emotions in a journal experienced a lessening of symptoms. hmmm. . . .health benefits of blogging--it's a study waiting to be done.)  while i'm ranting, i have to talk about the oscars--johnny depp was robbed!! i can't believe that stupid movie "mystic river" got two awards. i detest both sean penn and tim robbins, both need a good ass-whuppin. you know what i'd like to hear just once? "i'd like to dedicate this oscar to the men and women of our armed forces who have the thankless job of risking their lives to give all of us here in hollywood the privilege to prance around here tonight in our fancy clothes, pretend to be important, and express our unfathomable ingratitude to our country and those who defend us."

      Just for that little comment, I am going to post on your BLOG so often that my head will be completely devoid of thought, and it will all be on the internet... :)    I have midterms today, and I am really excited.  Testing is my single favorite thing to do in life, because it gives me that feeling of satisfaction like nothing else.  I especially like the fact that I get to test in an office with 2 secretaries that think it is fun to babble about their senseless existence, and their new "diet", while I am trying to regurgitate 12 chapters of crammed material from the 6 weeks before.  I always have liked to be challenged.  I told them this last time, but I do not think they got my point; just blank stares.  Do you ever wonder what is going through those people's minds?  I venture to say not a damn thing, but you never know.  They are probably very satisfied in life, because they are fundamentally stupid, and do not know any better.   Of course, this is all merely my perspective, and open for interpretation.  I would hate to get accused of being negative...;)  Negativity is often merely realism, and I do not find it negative at all.  If your reality is negative, then that is sad, and should be remedied ASAFP.    This is some seriously senseless serious babble, if I do say so myself.  I like it so much, I think I will post it to my BLOG as well.  Mwuahaha hahahahha !!!!!  I have the power (do not delete this Deb, or I will have to make copies to all sites  :)  )  My brother Joel has jumped on the bandwagon with me, and created his own virtual nation through Nation's States.  It is by far the most ridiculous idea I have ever heard of, but also pretty damn entertaining as well.  The things I do for fun....  I made an interesting discovery this weekend as well.  Every weekend that I do talk to my family, I talk to ALL of them within 72 hours.  It is truly amazing that they all call at the same time.  I think it is staged.. lol.  Last but not least, the BLOG is a wonderfully thing.  It is great therapy, until your soon to be ex wife reads it, and then calls you pissed off, and then you genuinely do need therapy.  Now THAT is ranting.  :)  Then again, that provides for more BLOG material...I love being me....Muwhahahah :)

      after all the hateful comments i've made about outdoor activities, i have to report that i actually made my first hike earlier this week! it was a 2 hour climb up a small mountain and although i was huffing and puffing and lightheaded most of the time, i kept going and enjoyed the pay off of being able to look out over miles of trees and mountains and lakes. i also saw my first chipmunk ever! he was so adorable!! it was quite thrilling, i must admit. now i'm ready to go buy some walking poles at the hated superstore i mentioned before!   i can't remember the last time i was in an environment devoid of all the chatter caused by people, machines, and technology. yes i can--driving through western texas. how could i forget  that .  anyway, on a completely separate note, i have to post this link:  urlLink iraqthemodel.blogspot.com , essential reading for anyone who still can't seem to understand why we're in iraq. here's an excerpt from his most recent entry:  "I lost faith in the whole world and I wasn’t ready at all to make the slightest sacrifice for the sake of others. I was trying to leave my country and find a better job in a safe place, BUT, The brave solders. . . who crossed seas and oceans and came to my country to fight for our freedom -and don’t anyone dare say the opposite, as I met so many of these soldiers and had hundreds of letters from them and there families and I know their motives; they fight for their country’s safety and for our freedom and they are proud of what they are doing- gave me the faith and showed me that man should not care only about himself, his family or his country, these are not enough to make a human being. These guys are MUCH better than me because I have to fight for my issue and they fight for me. They deserve the respect of the world and so do the people who support them. They always give me hope to go on no matter how difficult it seems. . . .I know that even if other countries pull out of Iraq, we will always have the strongest and greatest nation on our side, the wonderful people of the USA, together with the UK, Italy, Japan and the rest of the coalition forces."  take  that , you fucking protestors! kudos to you, mohammed, G-d bless you.  and on a yet a completely different note. . .who  in the hell  voted for diana, john, and jasmine, instead of jennifer, latoya, and fantasia??!! how could  urlLink jennifer hudson  be voted off "american idol"??!! i'm so disgusted, i guess i'm just going to have to stop watching the show.

      that's how i feel today. i suppose i should wait until i'm feel a bit more chipper to post, but i've been waiting for a couple of weeks now and it doesn't seem to be happening, so this will just have to be a post about how i feel blah.  i went to one of those big superstores of outdoor apparel and equipment today. not by choice, but that's another story. while there i found myself suddenly enraged that a fucking TANK TOP by patagonia, or some such label, warrants a $38 price tag. wtf?! i also saw a pair of flip flops, just plan rubber sole, black fabric, for $50. i don't know why that pisses me off so much. i think because that damn store epitomizes everything i hate about this area. i hate the mountains, i hate the way everyone keeps suggesting i get involved in "outdoor activities" (call me crazy, but my idea of fun doesn't include trekking up the side of a mountain while i'm struggling to breathe), i hate the rain, i hate hiking boots, i hate these ugly-as-shit clothes everybody wears that cost a fucking fortune, i hate the kayaks that are bolted to the top of everyone's SUV, i hate their stupid SUV's with their "no blood for oil" bumper stickers (an irony that never fails to bring a sneer to my face), but most of all, i hate the smug, self-righteous attitudes of these fuckers i find myself surrounded by.    i just want to sit on the beach with a cold beer in my hand, nary a fucking protester within sight or smell. is that too much to ask?   i saw a preview the other day for some new disaster movie about an earthquake and when i saw the part where the left coast falls into the ocean, i just about collapsed in hysterical laughter. it was the bright spot of my week.  what else cheery is going on? i have a nice vegetable stew simmering in my crock pot. that's cheery.

      i'm happy to say that i'm feeling much better than i was last posting. seems i had a bad cold and maybe an allergy attack on top of that lasting more than a week. at any rate, i'm down to an occasional sniffle and cough now, and a fresh committment to eat plenty of fruits and veggies this time and get exercise and not stay up too late, blah, blah, blah. :)  am listening to some cool trance music on  urlLink www.digitallyimported.com .  it kind of makes you feel like you're at a club all day instead of work, hehehehe. i find this productive at times, depending on what i'm working on. sometimes i prefer the soothing sounds of waves crashing or water falling or wind blowing through bamboo trees.   my newest obsession is food. actually, it's an old obsession i've decided to take up again. there's no particular reason why except i had lots of time to think about these things while i was sick and immobilized during spring break. ok, fine, i admit it. i read a book by a yogi and now i'm convinced that food is either the carrier of good or bad energy, depending on what it is, how it's been prepared, and what one's state of mind is when consuming it. i'm so easily duped. :)  what this means for me is that i simply must prepare all my food by hand (or, better yet, have it prepared for me! hehehe) for each of my six daily meals. no more leftovers (stagnant energy), no more frozen food (take, don't give, energy), and no more restaurants (unless i can be sure that the cook is thinking happy thoughts whilst preparing my meal).   now i just have to figure out how to work into my schedule the preparation time i'll need to prepare my food . . .  in the meantime, i'll work on thinking happy thoughts while i eat. last week, for the first time in five years, give or take a few, i ate dinner seated at the table instead of the couch and--here's the important part, drum roll please--with the tv turned off! it was kind of cool. i couldn't really tell if the food tasted better (as the yogi assured it would), but i might try it again.

      ha! i was so jealous of jon's new look and then i figured out how to give my own little blog a summer makeover! i think i'll try this rose one for a while.   what to rant about. . .i am up to my ears in writing final papers for school. i'm so over it! the weird thing is that even in the middle of this end-of-the-term stress that has me so worked up i can hardly fall asleep at night, i am feeling weirded out that the term is going to be over. why?? that doesn't even make any sense! it's not like i haven't already made a list of a million things that i need to get done over the summer.   that's all i really have to say. boring, huh? that's how it is when you're living a half-life of studying for hours on end, cut off from the outside world. right now i can't even think past next week's deadlines.   some inspiring words from my very own bulletin board:  "Healthful Ways to Manage Change"  1. Solidify your support--surround yourself with positive people 2. Appreciate nature--get outdoors 3. Look on the bright side--change can be exciting! 4. Flex your change muscles--try a new hobby or take a different driving route 5. Stay in good physical shape

      found a fun new site:  urlLink www.brainplace.com . lots of fun tidbits about the brain and brain care. i found the interactive brain quiz especially useful and amusing. my results suggested that ADD with inattention (as opposed to hyperactivity--now wouldn't  that  have been more useful? sigh.) as "highly probable." this "diagnosis" explained why i am constantly bored. apparently eating protein will help. the quiz results also suggested another condition as "probable." i can't remember what it was but it was something that explained why i get spitting-glass mad when things are moved out of their usual place. the nutritional suggestion for this was to eat  less  protein. hmmm, let's see, should i attack the boredom or try to do something about the urge i have to beat the shit out of someone sitting in "my" chair in class? i think the boredom is a higher priority. the site also talks about studies that suggest that  urlLink different types of music  can affect the ability of the brain to function well. apparently, classical is the preferred music (improving brain function even more than no music at all) and heavy metal and rap tying for the worst. what a surprise that is.

      i can't help noticing how the ads above the blogs change depending on the postings. it's kinda creepy and kinda funny. jon's ads are for political websites, shelby's latest brought on ads for "gas tiki torches"! and mine? self-help, depression. go figure.   how can a whole week have passed already? i'm looking at just three weeks of classes left, people! i'm trying not to think about it; otherwise the urge to go ahead and check-out is just too strong! i'm already making my summer list, of course. i'm up to 28 action items so far.   i'd really like to attend a silent retreat some time this summer. surely in this land of freaks such a thing exists. seems like a silent retreat would be right up freak alley, doesn't it? then again, if it's silent that would preclude yammering on about the evils of globalization, the current administration, and western civilization as a whole. hmmm, this might be more challenging than i thought.   i have this weird thing about who i share my energy with anyway. i don't believe in participating in group meditation, for example, unless i know who the group members are and what their energy is all about. i don't want a bunch of weirdos mingling their auras with mine. sometimes in class, i get the feeling that people are crowding me with their energy. that really pisses me off.   (let's see what kind of ads i get now! hahahaha)

      i haven't felt inspired to post for the last couple of weeks. i'm bored with my shows, tired of the news media, and over my initial euphoria with the great outdoors. sigh. i think it's time to talk about "friends" and it's long-overdue anti-climactic finale scheduled for tomorrow. let me say at the outset that i was (and am still to some degree) a huge fan of "friends." in many ways, the show mirrored my own life minus the fancy apartments and the cool jobs and the amicable break-ups, and the fantastic clothes, and the great hair. ok, so maybe mirror isn't the right term, but let's just say that my generation (i.e., the xers) relates to the series if for no other reason than it has been around most of our adult lives and, as such, is part of our culture in one way or another. having said that, i can acknowledge that it's time, really past time, for it to take its place in the popular media history books. still, i feel a little sad, but mainly because i would have liked to have seen it go while the writing was still strong. it would have been a more painful parting, but one infinitely more satisfying than this slow, painful, oh-just-end-already, finale that has stretched out over the last year. will it be as bitter a disappointment as the "90210" finale? only tomorrow evening will tell.

      i dreamed i was having lunch with enrique iglesias and shelby! how weird is that?! shelby doesn't even appreciate enrique the way i do! i've been having weird dreams all week. earlier in the week i dreamed my oldest sister was slapping me in the face and i was screaming at her. in reality, she has never said so much as a cross word to me! a few nights later i dreamed my mother was yelling that she hated me. i was like, "i'm an adult, i don't have to listen to this!" but i woke up shouting anyway. my mother never yells at me. i don't know why i'm having these conflict-filled dreams. when i'm not dreaming, i've been staring at my ceiling, counting the few hours i have left before i have to get up! sigh. i think it's time to make regular massage part of my schedule again. it's not a luxury, people; it's a necessity! tonight after work, i went to a yoga class for the first time in months. i'm going to start going twice a week. i've also talked one of my coworkers, who's indian and been practicing yoga since she was five, into teaching yoga to the office once a week at the end of the day. everytime i practice yoga, i leave thinking my true calling in life is to be a yogi! all this running around all day, traffic, bad news, noise, time demands--i'm so over it. i just want to practice yoga. and sip some green tea. and lie under a shady tree, half in the sun, reading a book.

      in the week since i last posted i've started a new job and had to adjust to the horror of getting up at 7 a.m. i know a lot of people get up much earlier than that every day, but i have never had to get up that early. well, since i've been an emancipated adult anyway. i learned early on that 8 a.m. classes weren't happening for me. of course that might have been because i usually worked nights in the mall. hmmm. it's hard to say where it all began. all i know is that for the last 10 years or so, i have enjoyed sleeping until 8 or 9 a.m. and as of last friday, that has all changed. i think i'm ok with it. i like the new office environment so far. everyone seems friendly and sincere, which are two qualities i appreciate in coworkers. it's the best combination. unfriendly and sincere is ok too, but i can't tolerate friendly and insincere or unfriendly AND insincere. when you have to spend half your waking life with  people, it's important that the experience be somewhat pleasurable, or at least, not miserable. that's what i think. anyway, i think it's going to be an interesting experience and more importantly, will pay my bills!   i can't help feeling a bit like a mindless drone though.

      another blue-skyed, bird-singing day in the great northwest! i had anxiety dreams all night. can't remember what about, but sure it was something meaningless like working on an imaginary research paper! my stomach is grumbling but i can't think of anything i want to eat that's in my kitchen. i think i'm down to oatmeal. not too exciting. we had an oatmeal day once a week when i was a kid. mom had all the meals assigned on a weekly basis, and one of the kids assigned to make them. i think oatmeal was mine. i never really took to cooking. my mind wandered too much to pay attention to a recipe. i'd almost rather go hungy than cook. almost. some loud whooshing noise is coming from outside my window. i smell freshly cut grass, so i thought it was a lawnmower, but maybe it's a carpet cleaner. lawnmowers don't whoosh really. i have no appointments today. am waiting to find out if a job possibility is going to work out for the summer. my visions of a lazy summer lasted about the two days it took me to realize that my financial aid doesn't extend through the summer. oops. i think i'll spend the day filing my papers from the year and pruning old files. i've been looking forward to this all year.

      first saturday since last september that i've been able to look forward to! why? because i don't have some damn research paper hanging over my head! school is officially out! hurrah!! i've survived my first year here, i couldn't be more gleeful! one down, three to go. yikes. i think jon said something recently about people who go to school their whole lives, hehehehe. it does feel pointless sometimes, i must admit. especially this year. but i'm holding on to hope that it will be worth it someday.   today i'm going to see shrek 2. i love seeing movies in the middle of the day. i'm probably the only person in america who hadn't seen shrek until a few days ago. i have a mental block against seeing anything animated. i don't know why. i'm afraid i'll be bored i guess and there are few things i find more horrifying than the prospect of being bored! but i found shrek really cute.   what else is going on? i really have nothing to rant about. i feel so peaceful. :) here's some more inspiration from my bulletin board:  Bee Happy (picture of a cute little bee--precious!)

      Excuse my French.  Wait a minute, that's not fucking French! :)  What an insult...Excuse my profanity.  What do the French have to do with anything anyway.  I hate fries.      Protest Warrior is the bomb.  It is about damn time.  I say this of course, whilst I sit here and type, drinking Jack Daniels and listening to "Sweet Home Alabama", but hey.  Not very refined, but I do not think I ever claimed to be.  After all, I am out of style in Germany, I have been told.  Who won that war again?  Hmmmmmm. :)  It is nice to see a political and patriotic site that makes sense.  I am so tired of ignorance.  My favorite statement is, "Please stop trying to think, you are hurting my head".  Unfortunately, I have to say it a lot.  Stupidity and ignorance are rampant, and the only thing worse than being a dumb-ass is thinking it is cool and you actually have a viable point.  It really is sad.  In the words of that goofy kid Justin Timberlake, "Cry me a river....". :)  How is Britney, I wonder?  Another topic, perhaps.    Anyway, thanks for the link Deb.  You always have such interesting things to look at.  It is really refreshing...Really. :)  Post people; retort and reply, and all of that jazz.  Exercise your freedom of speech.  It is a principle freedom, believe me, and if you lost it, you would bitch about it, but then go to jail.  Irony is a bitch.

      well, i made it back from my impromptu trip to the right coast: pcola, mobile, new orleans and gulfport. what a relief to be back in the south for a week, even if it was for a funeral.&nbsp;(note to friends in pcola: i'm sorry i didn't call you. don't be&nbsp;mad. funerals make me very anti-social.) if one good thing comes out of my time here in freakville, it's that i've really learned to appreciate&nbsp;quality people. people who ask you&nbsp;how you're doing and wait for an answer.&nbsp; people who smile at you or say hello, or maybe (gasp!)&nbsp;both!&nbsp;i noticed something very interesting while i was home: ethnic diversity. i noticed it not because it's anything new in the south but because it's so rare here in "enlightened" seattle where wealthy over-educated (mostly) white people have pushed out everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;they pat themselves on the back for keeping out corporate "baddies" like wal-mart and then feign surprise that a more "diverse" population can't afford to live here. hello! when you&nbsp;can't find work and can't afford overpriced boutique groceries that's what happens.&nbsp;on to happier topics. . .i saw the red sox play the mariners earlier this week. unfortunately, they lost, but any day the red sox play is a good day. i love nomar. i know some people find his rituals annoying but i think he's just precious! get this--the mariners' stadium actually has flashing&nbsp;messages cueing the "fans" when to cheer. it's the funniest thing i've ever seen! can you imagine such a thing in fenway?! never.

      i have to talk about how fulfilling my long weekend was. i cleaned my apartment from top to bottom (with some help from my significant other) and threw out a ton of stuff! it felt awesome! i love throwing out stuff. no matter how hard i try to keep things around the house to a spartan minimum, junk seems to reproduce itself while i'm sleeping. i get out of bed and trip over some piece of furniture or pile of clothes or stack of magazines that i swear wasn't there when i went to bed. my sister was like, can't you clean your house any old time? why on the holiday weekend? but the fact is this--it doesn't get done any old time. daily life gets in the way. i think i've mentioned before that i'm not a big fan of vacations anyway. the way i see it, i don't get enough time in my own home, why would i want to pay a lot of money to stay somewhere else? one day nanotechnology will give us self-cleaning houses. then i'll take a vacation.  now i have to talk about how annoyed i am by these farenheit 9/11 missionaries by which i have had the recent ill fortune of being accosted. have you received one of their sappy e-mails yet? "please see this movie! i'll pay for it myself!" please fuck off, i want to say/write, but just press delete instead or smile/sneer and say "no thanks" and walk away. sigh. you have to pick your battles i suppose. what i don't understand is why people haven't figured out that people believe what they do for a reason. obviously i think i'm right. if i didn't, i'd subscribe to another belief system. no amount of propaganda-viewing is going to change my mind, just like no amount of logic and reason is going to change the mind of someone who thinks michael moore's dishonest film is truth. christopher hitchens wrote a great piece on the film for  urlLink slate magazine . he gives me hope that not all leftists are lunatics.

      i like new months. why? they feel fresh and new. another chance to start a new routine, eat healthy, work out every week, blah, blah. i suppose i could do that any day, but somehow the beginning of a new month feels especially inspiring. my favorite, of course, is the beginning of a new year. is there anything better?! how can people be depressed on that day? i spend hours writing my new year's resolutions. never mind that i never do them. it's the dreaming and planning that's the fun.  today i went rowing on the lake. it was a sunny day and you could see the mountain on the horizon. the lake was full of lily pads and flowers. i'd forgotten how much work rowing is though. i'm sure my arms will be sore tomorrow.  afterwards, i visited one of the boutique grocery stores i've complained about in the past. i had to see what it was all about. it's a hobby of mine to see where the other half shops, how they live their over-privileged lives. it was like a scene out of "brave new world". everything was beautiful and shiny and organic. all the shoppers were under 35 (i swear i'm not making this up), and either dressed in typical trustafarian gear (you know, nose ring, eye brow ring, dreads, very expensive, carefully selected, pseudo-thrift store clothes, neatly folded protest sign for use after grocery shopping. hahaha, just kidding, but that wouldn't surprise me), or advertising j crew from head to toe. nothing wrong with that, of course. i like j crew. i have two t-shirts i picked up during a rare sale for $10. anyway, my point is, all these perfect people buying their perfect groceries creeped me out. not to mention the creepy prices. $4.59 a pound for french green beans. $4 for a small box of crackers. i just don't understand. anyway, i walked along the aisles repeating to myself "intention, intention, intention" (my new mantra to remind me to stay calm and relaxed under all circumstances, kind of like "serenity now!" from seinfeld, hahahaha), got a few vitamins on sale and got the hell out of there before security stopped me for having chipped toe nails and an unkempt ponytail!  enough about that. i told myself i wasn't going to rant in this entry, what happened? sigh.

      On a completely off the wall note.  I took the advice today, of someone who's opinion I respect, and decided to go 30 days without drinking.  What brought this all about was a question, my question at that: How do you know if you are an alcoholic, or if you are just a party animal?  The fact that I asked myself this question was something in itself.  I have been drinking for years, and like everything else in life, I do not do it in moderation.  I do not really care, but I decided to test myself and see if it is an issue or not.  Somewhere along the line it became a very normal part of my life. I know it is an issue to everyone else in my life, but why, I am not sure.  Here is a good link that I looked at on the subject.  urlLink Alcoholism     More to come on this, I am sure... :)

      "What can go wrong, will go wrong"-  Muphy's Law .  Murphy was a pilot; he should have been an Air Traffic Controller.
So, I am sitting at home, trying to study, and I get a call from one of the guys that works for me.  He was working today and somehow managed to separate four airplanes in 3 mile increments, like we are supposed to, and then managed to turn them all back into each other.  I am not sure how this is possible, but he did it.  To make matters worse, he had someone more "experienced" watching him, and someone even more experienced watching that guy, and they still managed to almost have not one, but several mid air collisions.  Amazing, really.  Luckily, one of the guys started talking over the other two (the Air Traffic Supervisors have "override" capability), so no one died, and I can stay at home for the rest of my pseudo vacation.  Yeah... :)  Anyway, to make a long story short, 3 people I work with can no longer talk to airplanes, and have to go back into "training".  Not a good thing at all; you are only allowed to screw up that bad 3 times in a lifetime, and then you are through.  The ironic thing here is that the last two times I have been on vacation, planes have crashed, and I have had to go in to work, grab my gear, and go "bag and tag", i.e., pick up body parts (this is an "additional duty" that I somehow got volunteered for).  Hopefully these tragedies do not come in sets of three, or I will be afraid to ever take time off again. :)

      I feel similar in regards to school.  I love to learn, but somehow when you have to work 50 plus hours a week, it puts a damper on the "joy of learning".  Fuck all of that.  I do it, and I am good at it when I put the effort into it, but I would rather do just about anything else.  For instance, ironing socks.  I do not think I would go to school if I did not need the damn degree because society looks down on people who do not have one.  In all reality, you will forget half of the shit you go to class for, because you will never use it again.  Who cares though.... As long as some yahoo that is sitting across the desk from you during the interview is satisfied, fuck it, right?  What the hell....

      after struggling for an hour, i finally dragged myself out of bed. my head is swimming and i feel hung over but i'm not. could it be my nasal spray? i have to go dig through the trash now for the damn insert that i never read because it scares the hell out of me listing all those possible side effects. no, i can't worry about it. i have class in half an hour and i haven't even looked at the readings we'll be discussing. sigh. i just don't give a shit really, if i'm honest with myself. i'm hoping that changes in the next four years or this could be a long and painful process.

      Ha ha.. Howard stern got yanked..    urlLink Howard 
Anyway, today has gotten off to a slow start.  This post will be about nothing much at all, just what I am thinking about.  No promises for future posts either.  :)
I slept until 1100, which I am perfectly justified doing, since I am off all week.  I just took a random 8 days off, just because I did not want to go to work anymore.  I think if it would not result in jail time, I probably would not go back at all... Oh well.. :)  Actually, I should be using every free moment studying for my midterms rather than sleeping, but now that I have gotten the initial sleeping part of my "much needed time off"  out of the way, I can concentrate on studying.  I could sleep for a week.  Now that I am up, I think I will go for a drive.  It is really clear and sunny out today, which does not happen often in Germany, at all.  Granted, it is 22 degrees outside, but what the hell..Can't be picky about everything, right?   
Back to studying...I am cramming for a mid term in physics that I am taking on Monday.  I say "cramming" because it is an online class, with no homework except two term papers.  Consequently, it suffered the most out of my two classes.  I have been busy watching my life change continuously, from bad to worse to not so bad, and then back to "what the hell?".  I have not had the chance to stop and breathe yet.  Maybe soon.  Better be soon... He he... I had similar circumstances last year at this time, and I ended up failing both of my classes as a result of the distraction.  Every time I think that the woman can not possibly do anything else to fuck with me, she proves me wrong.  Damn, I gave it away. :)  
I really do think that women are all psychotic, to one degree or another.  I know this is an unpopular opinion among women, so I apologize if you are a woman and reading this, but just try to stay in control and not throw your monitor out the window or something, ok?  
In all seriousness though, women do some crazy shit.  Take my soon-to-be ex-wife for instance.  That girl is smart, beautiful, and crazy as hell.  She called me yesterday, crying, and says "Why am I divorcing the only man I love?".  Now, if that is not insane, I do not know what is.  Fortunately for me, I had already come to the conclusion that there was something fundamentally wrong with the woman, so the comment was no surprise at all.  Common sense will not be tolerated.  Think and plan and dream, and you will pay the ultimate price.  Reason?  What the hell is reason....

      OK, I must say this in response to an "anonymous" comment: whoever described alcoholism as "cunning, baffling and powerful" , was or is way the hell to melodramatic. That is like saying "Behold the power of cheese!!".  I mean, seriously.  It is not exactly mystical.  Give me a break, people.

      Ok, so I am awake again.  I did not go to sleep last night until...well, this morning, actually.  I have had only 5 hours of sleep, yet I feel like I have had 12, and am perfectly happy with that.  I was sober all night, for the first night in.......who knows.  I like nothing more than the sun coming through the windows and awakening me.  Actually, that is not really true, I like a lot of things more than that, but you get my point, right? :)  

"Shelby" commented on my most recent post, and got me thinking.  Not that I was not already thinking, because I was.  Anyway, the comment was " unless you are drinking for the wrong reasons, you should be okay" (and I paraphrase), i.e., drinking to feel normal, getting up in the morning and having a beer and watching "Bob Villa-type home improvement shows" (that cracked me up), just because there is nothing better to do.  

Reality is this:  there is always something better to do.  I have gotten up and started drinking at 0730 in the morning before, and done it all day.  Granted, I was "grilling", it was a Saturday, and my neighbor was definitely a  raging  alcoholic, who came banging on my door yelling "you drinking yet!!!".... but hey.  The point here is that I am easily bored.  I have to keep busy, and I have a difficult time relaxing.  If there is something that "needs" to be done, I will do it, and I will not stop, for anything, until it is done...not even food.  

I do not drink to feel normal.  I drink because that is what I have come to embrace as my means for relaxation and escape.  No one likes to hear the words "escape" and "alcohol" in the same sentence, but everyone has something they do for escape...think about it.  The issue is whether your means of escape and relaxation interferes with the rest of your life.  Mine does not, but it does give me a headache, and is a contributing factor to my acting like an ass...as if I need any help acting like an ass... :) Damn, I called myself out... :)

       I am still studying for my Physic's midterm, but I saw this email that I got awhile ago, and thought it was post-worthy.  Due to the sensitive nature of the material, I deleted my original post, and then asked the writer's permission.   I found the message to be disturbing, since it was sent to me, but at the same time, fascinating.  Kind of like a train wreck.... :)  At any rate, I had to read it about 4 times before I fully comprehended it, and I am still not sure I do.  It is, at the least, an in depth view of a moment in a person's life.  I thought at first it was an excerpt from a sick romance novel, but, unfortunately for me, it is not.  The plot thickens.... 

 I went to the beach tonight, and I was standing silently and still with my back to the city and my face and shoulders squared, overlooking the ocean. The wind kissed my face gently, like a piece of satin flowing across my cheeks and over my wide eyes. A piece of my hair strayed across my face, lightly tickling my nose and then just as quickly it was pushed away by the warm satin wind.  

The taste of the salt covered my lips and my tongue slipped out to enjoy it.  What a delightful saltiness... I listened to the sound of the powerful waves beating the smooth shoreline, and the distant cry of the seagulls echoed in my ears.  But the sand I remember most.  The cool February sand gently pressing itself against my toes and wiggling between them.  Soft as sugar, but so cool to the touch. Not yielding to the beating it received from the waves, strong and smooth as glass along the shore, so cold and strong.  

Not like the wind, the warm satin wind caressing my face and shoulders, beckoning me to get closer to the expansive water reaching out before me.  Yet the sand under my toes warned me of the icy waters so I stayed put. And I just watched, and listened, and tasted. Here, only a few yards from a bustling city full of busy people the sounds of the city were drowned by the beating of the waves and the cry of the seagulls, and the sounds of the wind, the warm satin wind which came from somewhere else.  

Somewhere far away, where life is much simpler and a woman can reach out to the man she loves with a soft kiss.  I stood there and warm tears flooded my eyes and ran unabated down my cheeks.  As salty as the sea, but as warm as the wind. My thoughts wandered and I dared to dream for just a moment of what life could've been-do you ever do that?  Live in a world of regret that even the sea cannot drown out.  

I could not hear the city, but my own thoughts were loud and clear.  I could run along the beach with the cold February sand underneath me, it is now withstanding the pounding of my legs and still not giving in.  

Everyone talks of the powerful ocean, but it is the sand that is stronger. And no matter how fast I run to get away, I am still there. I still taste the salt and hear the birds, but the wind is not so soft now.  

Tearing through my lungs and stabbing at my cheeks, the wind is now no longer the gentle touch it was before, but a torture. 

As is my heart.

      The title is obvious sarcasm.  I have not slept well in months.  I think I awaken about 15 times a night.  This is irrelevant, really, but only serves to add to my frustration. 

I talked to my daughters today.  They miss me, and the baby wanted to know why I can not "come over".  My oldest wanted to know if I would ask Mommy if she would let her come watch cartoons.  It ripped my heart out.  I did not know what to tell her, or how to explain that there is an ocean between she and I, and even farther between her Mom and I.  I always wanted to say that I had no regrets in life, but now I do.  It is okay though..As my little one said, "mummy's friend, and my friend, Mr. Dan is coming over to play with us".  Shoot me now... :)

I lost a friend today.  I do not have a lot of people I deem friends, so it is to bad.  Granted, we all have our acquaintances, but this one is different.  I know I made a mistake, but my "give a damn" factor is way down, and I refuse to grovel.  "I am sorry" is all you will ever hear from me, and if that is not enough, then feel free to leave, and never talk to me again.  I have neither the time, patience or desire for any more games.  Damn the bad luck.

It is late here, and I have mid terms tomorrow, so I am done here.  This weekend has highlighted what I now view as fact:  until you find yourself (whatever the hell that means), you have nothing to offer anyone else.  Not very poetic, but true, nonetheless.

      SOooooo there I was....I have spent all week cramming for my midterms, which I have tomorrow, with the exception of Friday night.  What a bitch.  I have looked at so many formulas and theories, I feel half crazy.  I dream about the shit. :)  I really do not care about the Law of Universal Gravitation, but I have to know it.  I had F= ma in my head, and I could not remember that it related to Newton's 2nd Law of Motion, so I actually had to get out of bed and look it up so I could sleep.  Anyway, I need a break, but the day before the midterm is probably not the day to take it easy.... Hmmmm... If I had not been distracting myself for the last 6 wks, I would not be cramming now anyway.  I will never learn... I will post something meaningful latter on.  For now I will go back to the insanity of mass memorization, and hope to come out with my sanity. :)

      This whole BLOG thing is really amusing me.  Besides my own BLOG (and also beside my own BLOG in "Other People's BLOGs), I have the privilege of posting on DEB'S CAFE.  Her rantings are nothing less than inspiring, I must say.  I post so much thought on the internet, that pretty soon I will be like those two secretaries from "What Women Want", who also remind me a lot of the secretaries at my University office.  

That reminds me; I wonder if people that have those really annoying squeaky voices do that on purpose, or their vocal chords force them to sound that way.  I sincerely hope it is the latter, because if it is the former, then I do not think that I can bear it.  It is all I can do not to comment, and sometimes I can not resist the urge.  

That, and courtesy laughs.  You know what I mean...The forced laugh, the fake smile, it is really irritating.  I for one amuse myself, laugh at my own jokes and the like, and that is how it should be, since my own opinion is most important to me.  I am able to achieve these amusing results, because few people are quick enough to catch my smart-ass comments but me,  and I think that is funny as hell.  What I do not think is funny, is when they laugh at something that was NOT funny at all, and in fact was not intended to be.  That makes me want to slap them.  I know this seems harsh, but that is how God intended it to be.  If it is not funny, do not laugh, or you will get smacked eventually.  If you are really that stupid, and find normal conversation amusing, keep it to yourself, and laugh on the inside, or you will get smacked on the outside, and then I will laugh.  Muwahahaha.... :)  When I become dictator (Joel, I win), I will create the virtual "bitch-slap", and send it out via email at random.  Then I will hack the planet...

      Ok, so not really, but I wish it was... :)  Today I go back to work.  I was supposed to be off until Friday, but one of the geniuses that works for me came to work drunk, so now we do not have enough people with me gone.  This is the same genius that tried to crash 4 planes simultaneously, although he swears it was not his fault, but rather the guy sitting behind him watching.  I do not know, I was not there, but when I listen to the tapes, that had better be the way it was, or I am going to rip his ass.  I do not even know why these assholes even bother lying; everything that is said is recorded, and there is no way around that.

Anyway, so I am pissed, because I have not taken off in forever, and I put in 50 and 60 hour work weeks, not counting all of the extra bullshit I have to do on my time off.  These people are high maintenance.  Yesterday I took my guy out to dinner, so we could chat, and I could make sure he was mentally ok, and not going to slit his wrists.  He has had really bad luck lately, a lot of it self inflicted, but he is really young, and not so bright sometimes, so I am trying to be objective.  It is hard to do when you get awakened on a Saturday morning though, the first one you have not had to work in forever, and go pick his ass up from jail. Damn...  I feel like a Dad for really, really delinquet children.  

Yeah, so, that is that.  This has been the most un-vacation-like vacation ever! :)  I ended up going to work for one reason or another half the time anyway.  OH well, what can you do.  Is it Friday yet! :)  Actually, I have to much to do..It needs to stay Tuesday for a couple of days...A week of Tuesdays

Last thing till I come home pissed from work; I wonder who the FBI agent is that surfs all of our BLOG's for threats to national security, and I wonder why he/she never has any comments?  Hmmmm..Got to wonder... :)

      So I am sitting here right, and all of a sudden, it dawned on me.  I have not posted anything on my BLOG in days!  Damn, this is a tragedy.  I specifically set this thing up so I could be rude and offensive, and not have to direct it at anyone in particular, and here I am neglecting it for silly stuff like school (yes, I said "silly", but not like that).  Silly is such a gay word.  It really is.  It even sounds "silly".  Anyway, that is irrelevant.  What is relevant, is that I have yet to get caught up in Physics, and it is pissing me off.  I really have a hard time catching up, once I get behind, mostly because I lack motivation.  This is also really irrelevant right now though too.  

I got this email from my friend Jeff in Iraq.  Apparently, we can no longer fly our flag in Iraq out doors, according to CENTAF (look it up).  It is "internal" at the moment (I think), but it is really some stupid shit.  I guess now we are trying not to offend the Iraqi people, and make it look like we are occupying there country.  What the fuck... We fly the flag here in Germany!?!  That is what happens when you lose a war (or two consecutive ones).  Weren't we just killing those dumb shits a few months ago?  Actually, we still are, we just have to be less offensive about it.  I will never understand some people's rationale.  I suppose it can be chalked up to politics, and the like, but I think it is bullshit.  Let America be a Super Power, and act like it.  How is it that everyone else tries to take over the world, and we just police it all.  I say go for it, fuck 'em.  Kill them all, and let Allah sort them out, since they trust in him.  After all, are they not supposed to get like 60 virgins or something when they die?  Does not sound like a bad deal to me... :)  I wonder if it will be ok with the military if we still drape our flag over the coffins of our guys on there final flight home, or if that will be to offensive...

      Yea, so I know I have posted nothing again in days.... :)  In my infinite wisdom, and for no reason really at all, I decided it would be a good idea to partition my hard drive on my computer.  So, after much thought on the subject (10-30 seconds), I went out and bought the program, threw away the directions, and had at it.  After all, my computing skills are clearly superior, so why would I need directions...... 
 Yeah, well, either XP hates Partition Magic, or I somehow managed to find the only possible way to screw it up. I specifically bought it because it said "safe and easy to use" on the box.  I think that should be a T-shirt.  It would definitely make my life easier.. ;)  Anyway, back to the subject at hand, I crashed my computer, lost all my shit, and acquired 5 viruses somewhere along the way.  It was so much fun in fact, I tried it 5 more times before I said "fuck it" (I hate it when I can not figure something out).  In the end, since I had lost all of my files anyway, I just partitioned the hard drive from the boot screen  (little hint: you can not create partitions unless you delete the "C" partition first).  I know this is incredibly interesting dialogue, and you are on the edge of your seats, but I can not take it anymore...It is just to painful to bear (sob!!) Damn Partition Magic. 

In other news, I also screwed up my website.  Oh, and another point of interest, if you misspell my web address, you will find amateur eviews alright, but it is not my site.  Mine is misspelled for that reason; the other one was already taken.  Ok, the real reason is because I can not type, and do not pay attention. :)   Anywho, I know this, because I typed it in yesterday, and was like "Holy shit, when did I put porn on here?"!  I did not in fact put porn on anywhere, I just crashed my site, and that was before the whole partition fiasco.

Have you ever wondered why people would call you at 0800 in the morning on a Saturday, when you just went to bed 3 hours ago?  I found myself wondering this a lot lately, since I have been receiving an increasing number of these calls, obviously not all on Saturday, but hey.  I work shift work, which means that, in order for me to function, I sleep when I am tired, and amuse myself or whatever when I am awake.  Translation is that I have weird sleep patterns, and do not like to be awakened.  However, due to the fact that I care about the person, I talked anyway.  

Now the good part.  I do not mind my soon-to-be-ex-wife waking me up on a consistent basis to talk, because I am a relatively nice person (not really, but I do have a soft spot).  However, the routine is, call, talk about what she wants to talk about, yell at me when the conversation does not go her way, and then hang up on me.  Kind of like marriage... ;)  Now, I am over the whole "you yelled at me and hurt my feelings" part (the magic of divorce), but it still pisses me off to get awakened and yelled at after a couple hours of sleep.  Maybe I am asking to much here, who knows.

SO now we will throw this out there to all you psycho analytical types: what is the point of calling me, and not the boyfriend, and should I tell her to quit.  I know what I would like to tell her, but I am working on this new thing called restraint; obviously not in every area of life, but at least in conversation...Over the phone...At 0800 in the morning..Only.  

I have to decide soon if I want to stay in the military, and I have not.   I can either re-up for 6 years, take my $60,000 bonus and invest, or I can get out and make $85,000 plus the first year, but no job guarantee right off the bat.   In all honesty, I like the military, although I do not like the fact that I do not personally get to kill or blow anything up, but that is another subject.  However, if I do reenlist, then I will have 12 years in, so might as well stay 20.  Not sure about that.

Now back to the important stuff.  I think I will start my own T-shirt bushiness, and sell T-shirts with the most idiotic statements ever.  For instance "looking for a meaningful one-night relationship", "simple, and easy to use", etc.  I know there is already a market for this type thing, and it is rather inflated already, but the thought amuses me...And I am all about my amusement. Which reminds me, Joel, you have posted nothing amusing lately, and it is pissing me off!! :)  Shelby, on the other hand, always has amusing shit on her site  urlLink One Girl Show ,  so that is a good thing.  I always laugh my ass off.  She is a riot... ;)  

Anyway, I have not really done anything exciting lately (I know, shocking).  Work keeps me pretty busy, and pretty tired.  Not the Air traffic Part, but the bullshit political part of trying to keep everyone happy.  I do not really care about being politically correct, or whether or not I am offensive, but damage control must be affected every now and then, or else it just gets out of hand.  I am forever having to explain my actions, usually in written format, on "company" letterhead, CC to several different people.  For whatever reason, the populace loves drama, here especially.  It is like a damn sewing club.  I have fathered children of people I have never met, and had to explain, on paper, where I was, and what I was doing, all due to some ignoramus starting a rumor.  Apparently, it is not to hard to believe though, since I am constantly on the defense.  Granted, I am  usually   in the right, but it is still a hassle.  After the last time I was unjustly accused and had to explain my position, again, I said enough. From now on, regardless of the severity, legitimacy, or validity, the only "statement" I will give is this: "I want my lawyer".  Four words, simple, yet so beautiful...  Maybe I should reconsider career options.  However, my last base was not like this.  I mean, the work environment was like "Melrose Place", but no one gave a damn.  We all worked together, partied together, and no one cared about rank or status, because it never was an issue at work.  Here, everything is an issue, and if there is nothing new to gossip about, shit is made up.  I was at dinner, for a going away, and said "what up my nigga" to a white guy, and was called a racist.  OK, first of all, my racial opinions are irrelevant, secondly, I was having dinner,  not at work , and lastly, give me a fucking break.  I could not believe it when I was asked to write what I said, and the context of it.  Un frickin' believable.

Joel, if you do not post soon, I will find a way to kill your virtual nation.  Cheese will rain from the heavens, and kill your little maggots.  I do not know if my politically incorrect offending-the-entire-family brother-in-law reads this type stuff, but if not, you should (he he).  I would find your commentary amusing.  Nothing more amusing than comments on nothing.  Aaron, I hope you can find something offensive in here to comment on, so you can be happy.  For starters, I think there is mild racism, sexism, and Hinduism in here somewhere.  Not sure about the last one, but that should get you started. ;)  In all seriousness, I am just fucking with you.  It is your God-given right to be ignorant, and you are entitled to be wrong.  It is ok.. I am here for you.  Go buy Partition Magic; great program, highly recommend it.  Fly your flag proudly, whatever flag that may be.  Did I mention I like the Confederate Flag?  Only because everyone finds it offensive.  People are really pathetic when it comes to what offends them.  Maybe I just do not understand how to be that petty, all of the time.  Pointers, anyone?  :)

      My poor BLOG.  It is so neglected.  I do not think I have done anything with it since.... Hmmm, there it is, March 15th.  Oh well, damn the luck.  Not really sure why, I just became unplugged for a bit, and now I am back.  I did not really have anything worth saying, so I stopped writing for awhile.  I know BLOGS are supposed to be for venting, and especially mine, but sometimes my rantings scare even me! :)  At any rate, it is irrelevant.

I have not done much more than go to work, come home, sleep, and go to a couple of random clubs since I last posted.  Nothing to terribly exciting.  I had to start catching up on sleep though, I stayed up for days, accomplished virtually nothing, and then slept for 18 hours straight.  What a complete waste....lol.. oh well, what can you do.  

My classes are coming to an end, and with that there are papers to write; 4 to be exact, along with various Power Point presentations, which I love so much (psyche).  The Air Force is very fond of Power Point; there is a presentation for damn near everything, for no reason at all.  Perhaps that is why I relate with the ideal; everything is over simplified and overplanned.  Sometimes I think more time is put into planning than doing. "beautiful plan, to bad we never tried it...."  My life story.

Once again, still talking to the ex.  I call her the ex, such a cold and un-endearing term, I really fucking hate it actually, but anyway..... I enjoy talking to her, somehow, but it is torment, nonetheless.  We talk nonchalantly about life issues, she randomly tells me stuff about her new boyfriend, and I try to be objective.  I do not have a girlfriend, but rather the "flavor of the week", and she does not want to hear about that (sorry, that was the best description of "relationship" I could come up with).  I am still not sure why we talk, but, once again, irrelevant.  In all reality, I can rationalize it with ease.  I thought I had what I was to spend life with, now I do not, and so I will take my time and "shop" until such time as I come up with a better idea; and since I am not really working on any better ideas, it will probably be awhile.  I am in a state of confusion to a degree, I suppose.  I feel as if there has been a death that I have not come to grips with yet, and I am in denial, distracting and amusing myself until such time as I choose to deal with it.  Who really knows, and who really cares, for that matter.  I know I do not, just psycho-analyzing myself.  I mean, what the fuck, really?   How can anyone tell someone else what is best for them, or "Duh" that will not work.  I for one, did not know anything about any of this, love, marriage, or divorce, until it was thrown in my face.  It is like someone handing you a grenade and saying "You will be fine....just mess with it, you will figure it out... ".  Yeah, ok, great idea, genius.  :)  Then I hear "BOOM!!!".

I am so tired of talking about that.  It needs to be done with.  Taking up entirely to much of my thought life.....

So, anyway, I have been writing a lot of music lately.  I thought of posting some lyrics, but they are not very nice, so I did not.  I play guitar a lot, and it is a form of therapy, I suppose.  I have always enjoyed it, and now I have something to inspire me!  :)  Maybe I should be thankful....  I have more musical equipment than I know what to do with, and enough to perform for a crowd of 400 or so people with ease.  PA system, amps, 5 guitars, FX, you name it, I have it.   Now I just need to find some other musicians.  Drummers are the hardest to come by, I think.  At any rate, I do not really care, because I do it purely for entertainment- my own, that is.  If it ever becomes anything else, that is fine by me.  

It is 0300 in the morning, and I am still awake.  What in the hell.  I have been working till 1000 pm every night, and it is getting old.  Shift work is just not natural. I do not even feel like sleeping at the moment.  I could sleep for a week....After finals. :)  

Back to women.  What a pain in the ass. (he he, sure that will get some comments).  Not directed at anyone in particular, just venting, k?  Women are the most complicated creatures ever.  Half the time, I am not even sure it is worth any effort at all to even try to understand.  Wait....That is why...oh, never mind.  It is to bad we are not all on the same wavelength.  Maybe some women are, but I do not know.  No, it is just the communication thing.  We mean different things by what we say, and it is just a mess.   I think that is why I will never be married again; I just do not care enough to put forth the effort to explain myself.  I find it a bother, and annoying.  It is perfectly clear to me what I meant, since it is exactly what I said, is it really necessary to "read into" everything?  I dunno, but I find it redundant and tiring to have to repeat myself, then elaborate, then repeat that, then get pissed and say fuck it anyway, just "forget it". :)  It is amusing, but at the same time, not so much.  

I think I will start posting more often, then review my posts, and see if I can come up with a plan for self-rehabilitation.  Sounds important....Better start research.  :)  I will close this stream of utter nonsense with this.  I was recently asked, "How many people have you slept with?", to which I replied that I had never stopped long enough to count, and, once again, it was irrelevant (word for today). SO, my question is this:  Does it matter, and why or why not, and why are people so hung up on that aspect of life/relationships?  I mean, I am aware that life revolves around, in one way or another, sex, or more appropriately, lust, but hey.  Once again, I find the curiosity amusing, but that, I am sure, is just me, and my cynical, sick sense of humor.  

 Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If he does not want it, give it back
I'll keep it for me, fade back into black 

I am not sure where the title of this post came from........

      I am so tired of this week.  Is it Friday yet, or what?  Damn, this has been a long fucking week.  I think it is funny as hell (on a completely different subject) that you guys comment for days on one post, and by the time it is over, we are talking about cloning pigs, and barcodes, and procreation.. :)  I say clone pigs, and chickens too.  I am fucking starving.  

Soooooo, I forgot how many people knew about my blog.  I got hate mail for days after my last post.  Fuck 'em, I say.  People are to damn sensitive.  Do not flatter yourself into thinking that I took the time to insult you personally.  I have neither the time, nor the patience, nor the motivation for that.  "Flavor of the week" was a general statement, so feel free to get over it.  Or do not- whatever makes you tick.  Women are so damn sensitive.  What makes anyone think I want a girlfriend when I am not even legally divorced yet, is beyond my comprehension, but, then again, I am a man.  I think sometimes negative attention is better than no attention for some people, even if all logic says that nothing was directed at you.  Oh well.  Fuck it.

This week has been busy as hell in regards to Air Traffic Control; it reminded me of how it was to be at a level 3 facility, and how much fun it actually is.  I can not wait to do that again.  I am thinking Eglin AFB, or Nellis, but it is really all about the job, to me.  I mean, damn, you spend 8-12 hours a day somewhere, you had better be having a good time, or you are going to be one miserable bastard to be around.  I know I am... ;)

My soon to be ex is still in love with me, but will not do anything about it, except call me, and torment me.  I do not even know what I would say to her if I saw her.  Very weird, very done.  But, I am a dumb ass, and keep answering the phone.  It is always the same routine, so I have decided to quit answering my phone.  :)  I set it to ring like a bird singing, so it will be a bit less annoying.  If it is important, call my cell.... :)  I like birds.  Chickens, actually...Cloned and fried. Ahhhh....

I have nothing pertinent to say, so now I will stare at my ceiling, as I try to sleep.   And I won't.  Watch Fight Club.  That is me.....  have not slept in 72 hours.  I try to count sheep, but they are all dead, just like everything that was beautifull to me.  Poetic, but not really pertinent.  Sleep is a dream................

      I find, that if you sit by yourself and stare into a beer (or other tasty beverage of your choice), muttering under your breath, "Crazy? I was crazy once...locked me in a rubber room..got eaten by maggots...maggots?  Maggots make me crazy...Crazy? I was crazy once....." and so on, you get a lot of weird looks.  It is fun though... :)  Also, " Can't sleep, clowns will eat me, can't sleep, clowns will eat me..."  and so on, is also a really neurotic thing to say.  I am like a child, and very easily amused though....  One of the guys at work mutters that shit when he is working planes, just to wig the big boss out.  Once again, I laugh my ass off.  Try it; quite fun.

So, I bought a fish tank.  I wanted a dog, but I am inherently lazy, and do not like walking the poor animal...or feeding it...or letting it outside..you get the point.  Also, dogs are like 700 euro, and fish are 5.   I can go through a lot more fish than dogs, and much cheaper.  Although, I do not guess I can take the fish out of the tank and pet it either...or take iot camping.   Fish are not called man's best friend, and dogs are.   Hmmmm.... Did you ever consider this; dogs are called "Man's best friend".  What does that make a women?  Think about it, I got you, admit it.... he he...    Coincidence? I think not... :)  Anyway, back to the fish: You do not have to walk fish.  Also, if you get hungry, you can eat them.  Although, I suppose you could eat your dog if you had one, but that is not really a "meal size" portion.  Unless it is a small dog, and you are really hungry.  Anyway, fish are easier to catch, I think....although you can call the dog, and not the fish, but then again, you have a net for fish, and not for dogs, so I guess it evens out.  Anyway, I bought a fish tank, and on the side of the tank box it says "Fish not included".  Damn... I am glad the manufacturer went to the trouble to write that there, because I thought they were included at first.  Just add water, and they come to life...dehydrated, but living nonetheless.  Wow...

Yeah so, now I have to wait a few days for my water to filter, all 30 gallons of it, and then go get some damn fish, so my life can be complete.  I know this has to be what is missing....I am sure of it.  It has to be.  It is the only thing I do not have.   Besides a dog...and a wife...I want a dog more though....more friendly....and I can eat it when hungry. :)  I will be happy with my fish though.  I was proud of myself in that I settled for a 30 gallon tank instead of spending like a grand on my credit card for the one I really wanted, since that would have typically been what I did.  I did not though, so that is a step.  I have absolutely no control when it comes to finances.  I mean, I do, but I just do not care.... :)  It is to far gone anyway, so fuck it.  Fuck em if they can not take a joke, when I stop paying... lmfao.  I am such an ass.

I went out last night, and it was a bore, as usual.  I mean, not really, but the whole club "scene" is getting old, and pissing me off.  I get to this stage, where I am just pissed, and do not care.  Girls will come try to dance with me, and I will tell them to piss off.  That is just me though, and they love it.  It is sad....for them, that they are so dense.  I even told a chick that, and she just laughed like an idiot, so I told her I was serious, and she just laughed more...sheesh...what an idiot.  I think it has to do with the fact that girls do not listen to anything you say, and assume that everything has hidden meaning.  if you think  about it, it makes sense.  If you are honest they think something completely different from what you say, and if you bullshit, they do not dig it.  I am a genius... :) Actually, I do not understand women in the least, and would sooner go skydiving without a parachute than worry about it.  Fuck Freud.... Who gives a fuck "what women want" (good movie though).

So, that is all that is new for now. Not really, but that is all I am going to write for now.  Sorry if I offended anyone.  Ok, not really at all, but I tried for a second to act like I cared.  My thought for today is this (my one coherent thought): never ask, "What else could possibly happen" , cause you will surely find out.  Chances are, you will not like it either.. :)
Buy some fish, they have lots of good character traits.  Great personality too.  And they do not bark, or bite, or talk...like a woman, and a dog.  Just let it go... :)

      i don't know about the rest of you, but i for one am tired of checking jon's site and finding no new random rantings!!! therefore, i've taken it upon myself to use my power to freshen up the site with a new posting! 

that'll learn ya not to neglect your blog!! 

what shall i muse about? how about tulips? i really love tulips and there's this big festival a couple of hours away with fields and fields of tulips. ahh. . . what a joyous thought. . . tiptoeing through the tulips. . .does it get any better than that? i think not. 

did anyone catch the first episode of that new show "the swan" last night? how fucked up a concept is that?! i was too skeeved to even watch. i did, however, watch the new "bachelor," where he called out the wrong woman's name and had to tell her it was a mistake in front of everyone! harsh. like a glutton for punishment, she stayed anyway. i would have liked to have seen her tell him to fuck himself and then march proudly off the set with her head held high. 

i really need to work on lowering my expectations if i'm going to watch these stupid reality shows!

what else can i blab about to take up lots of space on jon's blog and annoy the shit out of him when he finally gets back to it? hehehehehehehe

i'm listening to some lovely salsa music right now (you can find it at  urlLink www.digitallyimported.com , scroll all the way down); it makes me feel like i'm swaying in a hammock on the beach with a margarita in my hand, half asleep instead of sitting in a dark computer lab, still half asleep but sans margarita.

      No, I have never been to prison.

Deb, you are a goof ball.  The tulips were more than I could bear, but the shrew definitely took the cake, Joel...You are definitely on crack....so to speak.  Unlike some of you "civilians", my computer use when going to sites  referencing "entertainment" is extremely limited by Uncle Sam.  Since I now live at work, this severely hinders my creative writing. :)  It is all good though, Deb was looking out for me.  Shelby shot the sheriff, but she did not shoot the deputy; consider yourselves informed.  It is just to great a secret to keep.  Personally, I always wondered why they stopped shooting after the sheriff.

So, anyway, for all of you critics, I quit drinking for a month, and then said fuck it.  It was not as hard as I thought, so I decided to "treat myself".  I was just concerned because society says it is bad to be addicted, and I personally despise the idea (of addiction).  Ever heard of prozac, people?  Half the damn nation is on that shit.  At least I have a good time. :)  I know, I am funny, please hold all applause until after the presentation.

Yes, so I am now done with classes.  I am still awaiting grades, and keeping my fingers crossed for Physics.  I hate that instructor, he is such a retard.  Actually, hate is a very strong word, and and he is very intelligent, but he has not a clue of how to successfully teach a class online.  I hated physics so much, I signed up for Environmental Science next.  The book looks like a dictionary.  I am determined to beat my monster though; must find my power animal in my cave...I watch to many movies. :)

In May I will come/go back to the states, to see my girls.  Oh yeah, and get served divorce papers, finally, since Dana's lawyer is apparently to retarded to figure out how to do it here.  What a great lawyer; hope she did not cost to much.  Anyway, after my lawyers have a field day with the paperwork, I will send it back for revision.  I have a feeling this is going to take awhile.  I love Air Force lawyers; almost enough to do it.  I do like to argue and all.  No, I LOVE to argue, it is my passion.  :)  So argue with me...now...or else.... 

I was beginning to wonder if paperwork had been filed or not, or started, or whatever.  This is such a pain in the ass.  I am so jaded now; I do not think I am capable of any feeling at the moment when it comes to a woman-  emotion that is.  It is to bad; I used to be such a "sweet boy" according to my mum. :)  What the hell happened...ah, fuck it.  I hate to admit this, but when I look for a woman, I compare them all to who I affectionately refer to now as my "ex", and that is not so good.  For all the things the woman did and said to be a bitch to make me hate her, and for all of her fucked- up mind games, I have not found anyone who comes even close to being half the girl she is, in any way...and that sucks to have to admit.    

That was my mandatory emotional entry (sob!!!) :)

Anywho, I am going to Nuermberg today, so I am off.  I am not sure where this place is, but my friend Sean is going, so I am too.  Got to see all of the motherland before I leave this wonderful land of opportunity.

No more shrews and expositions on their bowel movements...and I hate tulips, they remind me of funerals, somehow.  Good looking out though.  You guys are so money, and you don't even know it... :)

      ***OK, I edited it, for clarification.  I forgot who the audience was..... :)  ***

Blow shit up.  

Inspector Gadget seems to be a fan of ass-fucking.  At least that is what I got out his comments.  I hope it is no one I know....:)  That is my sick line, by the way.  I stole it rightfully from someone else.  

I got the new Marilyn Manson CD this weekend.  I must say, I think it is his/her/it's best work yet.  Truly a disturbed individual, but an entertainer for sure.  

I saw a t-shirt this weekend that said "FCK- all I need is U".  It cracked me up.  The things people think of.  Oh yeah, and Marilyn Manson decided to right a song about it too.  Maybe it is a sign.... Naw, I doubt it.

So, yeah, this chick I am friends with.  I mean, she is cool and all, and we are friends, but not like that.  Anyway, I find the whole deal amusing, because she is so damn persistent!  I usually do not say no either, cause I think it is relatively harmless, at least for me, but this time I decided to try to exercise some self control.  What the hell, right?  :)  Go to try new shit every now and then. I consider her a friend, and I guess I do not want to screw it up.  It always happens:  I take a girl out, and then I lose interest.  It is such a vicious cycle, and I can not afford that again anytime soon with someone that I am around all of the time anyway.  Figure that one out, Frued.  Plus, I guess it is not a very nice way to conduct business, but some people just will not learn.  Either they think they are capable of working miracles, or they are just living in a dream. Either way, it would take one hell of a woman to change a guy like me.  I hate to sound racist, because I am, but I just can not tolerate people who are all "clicky", for whatever reason. I am jaded, I am an ass, and I have no apologies for anyone.  Why women like that, I have no idea.  I almost feel bad....  I have tried to be friends with girls, but either I end up sleeping with them, or they fall in love, or usually both, and it is maddening.  I know I am a delusional to expect anything different, but I do.  I expect normalcy.   Do not hook up with someone you just met and expect a meaningful relationship.  Where do they make these people, and why are the all around me?  I am changing my wardrobe, or something.

I was irritated for awhile, because I felt censored.  Yes, censored on my own offensive BLOG.  What the fuck?  Inspector Gadget can be an ass fucking fan, but I get hate mail for a week on my "Flavor of the week" comment.  I scoff...I mock... Get a fucking clue.  Women are inherently Psycho (it is capitalized for a reason).  Men are all pigs.  If you think different, you are stupid as well as psycho.  Anyone who comes across as if they give a shit, is retarded,  and trying to get in your pants.  The world revolves around sex.  It is in marketing, music fashion, you name it.   Sex sells, and yeah......  Multiple meaningless moments of satisfaction are better than none at all.  Write that down.  It is an interesting angle.

Did I mention I am a jaded fucker?  Well, I am.  The only good things I had to show for my life thus far are with their incredibly irritating and confused mom in the states, so I am pissed at the world.  I swear on all that is holy, if another person tells me to forgive, forget, and get back together for the girls, I will lose it.  Perception is everything; Pull your head out of your ass and have a bite of reality.  I am also painfully aware that I need time alone, and I need to stop fucking all of Europe, but I frankly enjoy it.  When I am 50, and wrinkly, I doubt I will be doing anything fun.  So much for shit that matters, but oh well. 

All I wanted was to be a good dad, and be friends with my silly ass wife.  Unfortunately, it is always easier to claim grievance, and blame someone else besides yourself.  Look in the mirror, genius.  You created your little fuck-up, now deal with it.  If it seems like I am stuck on the whole ex thing, it is because it will not leave me alone.  "I lay in his arms and think of you".  Is that a normal fucking thing for a woman to say to her soon-to-be-ex-husband?  Probably, but not in my book.  I am really fucking pissed, because my 2 year old told her cousin that "Mr. Dan is Mommy's friend, but at night she cries for my Daddy".  That is way to deep for a 2 year old little girl.  No baby deserves to have to grow up that fast because Mommy has major fucking issues.  Please, girls; If you need a fucking priest, or a fucking shrink, get one.  All I am is a fucking asshole, so spare me the drama; I am not qualified, and I do not give a fuck.  I will never understand women, but they will never understand men either, so I guess it works for everyone.


So, I am a bit stressed out. :)  I am so fucking irritated with the entire female population (with the exception of mothers, and sisters, and friends), I could scream.  I am a really nice fucking guy in reality, but no one gives it a chance.  If you are to stupid to know that it is really fucking tasteless and tacky to fuck someone that you have known for an hour, then  you are retarded.  Congratulations, you just failed.  Take a stuffed animal from the bottom shelf as a prize, and go the hell home so I can sleep in peace.  I do not have time to waste.  It is like shopping, only a bit more interactive.

I am in a pissy mood, and tired, so now I will go.  I apologize in advance for being a prick (DISCLAIMER).  Have a great day.

      It has been a while since I have posted, and I know this.  Ever since I came up with the ingenious idea to take online classes, I have spent all day at work (when I am not actively working-most of the shift) on the computer.  For this reason, I avoid mine at home, as if it were the plague, choosing rather to stare at it as if it were my enemy.  Then I wander over, check my email, and see how much money I do not have in the bank.  This is my daily ritual when I get home from work.  Due to the fact that everything is automated, I do not even have to get on the internet, because everything is downloaded and waiting for me; i.e., Outlook, Microsoft Money, Etc.  At any rate, this is why I have not rambled in a good long while.  That, and I do not have much to say of late.  :)  

Hmmmm, so what is new.... Not a whole lot really.  I passed my online hell classes, with a "B" and an "A", so that made my month; something had to.  Now I am taking Environmental Science, and it is of course much more in depth and difficult than it was advertised to be.  I have essays out the ying yang, as well as really complex online discussions that are entirely over my head.  I do not really care about it, I just want the degree.  Physics was enough fun; environmental science is a waste of my time.  Unfortunately, Dr. A does not share my opinion, and seems to think that the entire class also posses doctorates, same as he.  I am beginning to notice a trend....

I sold my car today, so now I am depressed.  Not really, because I can get out of debt now, maybe, but a bit irritated at the whole process, and the fact that I feel like I need to do it.   I am spoiled, and I like my toys.  No toy, however, is worth an $900 a month bill (including insurance and gas, of course).  When the things you own begin to own you, then there is a problem, and it is no longer fun.  I have always had pretty much whatever I wanted, but it has taken its toll on my financial health.  In an effort to redefine and begin anew, decided to say fuck it, bite the bullet, and get out of debt.  Not to mention, everything I have reminds me of a sort of relational hell, so I intend to get rid of all of that as well.  It is a bit liberating, I must say, yet somehow like the death of a small yet irritating pet.  

I now intend to get a motorcycle.  Yes, a motorcycle, that is what I will get. :)  My friend is selling me his for a grand, and it is actually really nice.  I do not know what year, but it is a GSXR 900, and I will have fun with it. Motorcycles are much more economical, although there is that fear of a bloody death or maiming, but the way I drive, the probability of such an occurrence was just as good in a car.  Now, I will have to be a bit more careful.  Hold the lectures, please. :)  

I have thought of this little paragraph for a couple of weeks now, and still have no good answer.  It is my mandatory bullshit paragraph... :)
In the absence of love, there is emptiness, and loneliness.  In the absence of emptiness there is love, but also pain.  To not love is to not fully experience all that a person is and has to offer, or life at all, for that matter,  but to love is to be vulnerable, and that is an unacceptable risk.  Loneliness is the tool of the devil  that sways and convinces the mind of the weak when they are at their lowest point, and then causes them to kick themselves in the ass at a later date.  Emotion complicates life; in the absence of emotion, all is irrelevant, or as they say in German, "es ist unerheiblich".  Regret is like a rocking chair.  Back and forth, back and forth, it is something to do, but you go nowhere, and it accomplishes nothing.  Despite the urge and the desire for the miraculous, perhaps sometimes it is better to just leave it alone, and let come what may.  I guess i will find out.

So, now I am learning German. Mostly due to the fact that I have been here for 3 years almost, and can say nothing much more than "Ein bier, bitte" und "Vas es los, mein hund".  This is a travesty, so I intend to try to remedy the situation.  It is irritating as hell to try to have a conversation and not have a clue what the hell the other person is talking about.  It took me a week to get my landlord to fix my hot water, and I still have yet to explain that I have not been warm yet, and that is why he will probably never see his deposit that I owe him, still.... :)

I am taking a break from the party scene, at least for a weekend.  This is at least my plan, but we will see.  I am coaching Little League Baseball, and we have our first game on Saturday, so I need to have my "game face" on. :) I never thought I would coach a sport; I suppose it goes right along with my 2 grey hairs I found.  It is tragic.  

I have successfully rid my life of distractions to the maximum extent possible, and by that I mean women, and no not anyone reading this (I think)  yet it is still not having the desired affect.  I actually have a female acquaintance that is pretty cool to hang out with, yet she is proving to be more of a distraction than all others combined. I do not know about this; the irony pisses me off.  At any rate,  I find the butchering of the English language in a frustrated and desperate attempt to communicate extremely amusing.  This is saying a lot, because it is generally annoying as hell, and it is good to laugh on occasion.  Not like laughing at someone who stubs there toe, but genuine laughter.  Perhaps it is the grey hair, and I am "normalizing"?  I seriously doubt it.   I do not think I have ever been in the company of a person who was speaking German,  Russian and English all at the same time, and still not getting their point across.  Funny to me, frustrating for her.  I suppose I could hire a traveling clown to follow me around and amuse me, but this is much more interesting.  :)  German is such a difficult language though.  Supposedly English is easy, but I do not know about that either.


Anywho, that is all that I will write for now.  I know I am a slacker, and I will attempt to at the very least be on here once a week.  It is quite amusing to read what you guys post for comments though.  All apologies for seemingly falling off the planet as well. :)  After all, what is the point of a forum devoted to random stupidity if I never post. ;)  To quote my favorite movie, "Do not take life to seriously, you will never get out alive"...write that down.  Read "The Art of War" too, if you get the chance; it is really quite interesting. Those Chinese really did think a little much about that kind of thing- pretty amazing that it is so old, and yet still referenced in the various war colleges.  Classics.... ;)

P.S.
This email is devoid of any hidden meaning, innuendos, and implication....and if there is anything in here that can be taken as either insulting or funny, I meant it as the latter.  If it is in bad taste however, there is not much I can do about that with the exception of having a lobotomy. That is for all of my female readers, by the way.  He he :)

      I am back, and pissed off again.

Usefull idiots.  Is there really such a thing?  Political terrorists, whose insanity knows no bounds.  The "new freedom fighter" as they have often been referred to as; one man's enemy is another's freedom fighter.  Whatever.  I say, bullshit, on all of it.  

    Yesterday, I am at work, stressing out over the incredible amount of bullshit paperwork, due, of course, while I am on vacation the next two weeks, and I see this video.  An American, sitting in front of a group of ball-less thugs, screaming in agony as he is decapitated, on video, for the world to see.  Now, I have never had a weak stomach, for anything.  I have seen dead bodies, I have picked up body parts and stuffed them into meaningless little baggies for weeks at a time, but this made me almost lose my lunch. 

I was so angry, I wanted to.... Pain, lots of pain and torment for those mother fuckers.  Piss on them, and shit on their "peaceful" religion.  I, and I am not alone, say we fucking kill all of them, genocide style, and let Allah, or Mohammed, or whatever sort them out.  Let him save them, if he will have them.  I have heard people say that tactics like this are a result of us brutalizing prisoners in Army camps.  Horseshit...

First of all, everyone knows that the overwhelming majority of Army personnel are just smart enough to pull a trigger and not question why, so I do not know what all of the shock is about.  Secondly, see how you react if you see your buddy get his leg blown off, or watch some kid barely out of highschool burn alive in a humvee, only to survive to a life of grotesque disfigurement, compounded with the news that your 1-year tour is now a 2-year tour in hell, and see if perhaps you are a bit irrational...Maybe even, dare I say it, pissed the fuck off.  Lastly, but most importantly, if those fucking imbecilic fucks had stayed the hell in their own god-forsaken country, we would never have had to invade theirs.  Let us not forget, these gutless morons have been doing this sick stupid shit for years, for no good reason at all, besides they are fucking loony.  Religion is a powerful tool to drive men mad.  

If they thought things were fucked up before, they are in for it now.  Those little fuckers in ski masks have just unleashed hell on themselves and the rest of their pathetic brotherhood.  Countless inocent will suffer just for looking like they sympathize as a result of their stupidity.  Maybe it is not fair, but you know what?  We are bigger than they are, so suck it up. Now every GI with a gun and half a brain will be gunning for them.  Shoot now, ask questions latter.  I know I will, if given half the chance again.  Oh yeah, I return to Iraq for another vacation in September.  Run and save yourself...

This may strike you as a bit severe, or extreme, but I think decappitating someone on film is pretty severe myself.  It is like a little kid going up to a pissed of adult and telling them to fuck off, and then giving them a papercut.  Seriously, what do they expect?  There is no "Holy War", it is just another moronic reason to be insane.  

For your educational pleasure.  Tell me how this is rational.  Just a little side note, this guy was not even military, he was a civilian.  

  Translated from Arabic   
Sheikh Abu Mus'ab Alzrqawy slaughters an American with his hands and threatens Bush with more 

 A statement to the nation 

The praise of Allah for all Muslims with his support and the humiliating of those who attempt to defeat Islam and who attack it and who entice the unbelievers with their cunning. 

The one that appreciated the days countries with its justice and the prayer and the greeting on from above the Islam lighthouse by its sword as for after : 

The Islamic nation 

You rejoice at the first signs of the dawn that have started that have granted the wind of triumph. Allah was benevolent to us in Al Fallujah, granting us victory 

On one of the days of Allah and that was known to Allah alone 

The Islamic nation 

Does any excuse for waiting remain? How the free Muslim sleeps, with his eyelids closed. 

And he sees that Islam is slaughtered and can be seen bleeding its dignity 

And the shameful pictures and the news of the evil humiliation of the Islam people men and women in Ghareb 's father prison then where the jealousy and where the zeal and where the anger about the Allah's religion and where the jealousy for the Muslims sanctities and where the revenge for the honors of Muslims and Muslims is in the crosses prisons . 

As for you are the Islam clerics then to Allah we complain about you, you see that Allah have founded the argument on you by the Islam young man who humiliated the strongest force in the date then broke its nose and destroyed its pride 

We came to you that you learn from them the reliance meanings and derive from their doing the lessons of sacrifice and redemption to when you remain as the women you master only the slapping language and know only the way of wail and weeping 

Then this appeals the world freemen and this it begs Kofi Annan and a third begs Amr Moussa and fourth he demands peaceful demonstrations and as if they did not hear to his saying ( ( O you the prophet incited the believers to the fight ) ) 

You were fed up with the fight of the conferences and the oratorical battles ohm came to you that you take the jihad way and carry the sword that sent by it the prophets master 

And we beg from you that you do not be involved as usual in the denial of what will do it satisfaction of the Americans 

He has ordered the prophet - peace be upon him - and he is master the merciful are with the slitting of the necks of some prisoners and their slow killing 

And for us it is an example and a good example 

As for you, the Roman dog Bush, I hope you are displeased and we wait for you with God's Help tough days and you and your soldiers today who tred Iraq's land will regret it. 

And she dared in it to the Muslims fever 

And another message to traitor Pervez Musharraf then we say to him that we in wait for your meeting with your soldiers 

We demand of the American and will take revenge for the blood of our brothers in and Iraq and elsewhere 

And as for you and the Americans soldiers wife then we say that we offered to the American administration this prisoner in exchange for some of the prisoners in Abu Ghareb prison but they refused 

Then we say but if the dignity of Muslims and Muslims in Abu Ghareb prison and others is worth theur blood and souls 

we tell you to know that the coffins will arrive to you one coffin after another, as your people are slaughtered in this way......... 

Then you kill the polytheists where you find them and you take them and count them and place them where they can be seen. 

Allah is the greatest and the honour to Allah and to its messenger and to the militants 

And our last claim is that the praise of Allah is the Lord of the Worlds

And you see the slaughter, your fighting brothers suspend the head of this unbeliever on one of Baghdad bridges so that they teach a lesson to others from the infidels and serves as a witness to the honour of the Muslims  

I do not know why you would want to, but I saw it, and it is hard to find, for obvious reasons.  If you dare,  EXERCISE EXTREME CARE .   urlLink VERY GRAPHIC .

Before any random readers consider wasting their time responding, and more importantly, wastes mine having to read your bullshit and belittle you, consider this:  every American has rights.  You have the right to your opinion, you have the right to be wrong, and you have the right to be an idiot.  Happy?  Think on this: at the present, someone you do not even know is defending your right to talk shit about him, his country, his flag, and his existence to defend your freedom, from all enemies, foreign and domestic, and half the nation is to damn stupid to realize what they are saying.  I offer anyone who disagrees with reason, with this thought:  exercise your right to educate yourself, experience an original thought free of media, free of partisan,  and if all else fails, exercise the right to keep your moronic opinion to yourself, and   shut the fuck up  .


Who said Islam was a peaceful religion again?   Fuck off...

      Jack is what I have not done all day.  Jacked is how my head feels from flying for 10 hours, being delayed for 6, and arguing with someone who knew limited English as to why my suitcase was not on the plane.  I hate airports, with a passion...Thankfully, I finally got my suitcase today, relatively intact.
  
I had a really nice vacation in Florida, and it was extremely relaxing, as well as stress-free.  Wait a minute...NO, not so much.  I Need a vacation after my "vacation".
  
It was worth it though, just to see my family, if for no other reason.  I can not believe how much all of my nieces and nephews have grown.  Unreal... I feel so old.  Now I begin to sound like deb, Huh? ;)
  
I do love the beach and sun.  You do not realize how much you miss these things sometimes, in the land of no-sun/lots of frickin' rain.
  
I could write a novel, and only address the first 3 days of vacation, but I will wait.  For now, I leave it at this.  Words to remember:  When it seems like everything has gone wrong, and nothing can possibly get more complicated, do not fear, it will.  :)

I just got off work a bit ago, and I am really tired.  I was going to relax and take a nap, but I got caught up in other activities, so I did not, and now I am awake again.  I think I have averaged 3 hours of sleep a night this week, and it is beginning to wear on me.  This is always the case on dayshifts.  My body can not seem to adjust to getting up at 0400, and going to bed in time to do so. There is simply not enough time in the day.  It does not help that it is not dark until past 2200, and light again at 0400 either.
  
I went to see the Air Force legal team when I first got back, and they told me I should have filed a response to my divorce paperwork while I was in Florida.  I of course told them that this was a ridiculous notion, because I do not believe in mixing business with pleasure, but whatever.  Perhaps I will get fucked over with this logic, but we will see.  I am giving a certain somebody a hell of a lot of credit here, and I am curious to see what she decides to do.  I am opposed to getting a lawyer, because I do not want to take out yet another loan for something so pointless, unless I have good reason.  At the risk of sounding ignorant and completely oblivious to reality, I am trusting it will not be necessary.  I guess my main reasoning is that I want this over and done with ASAFP.  I know how I am, and I know how I think, and I do not want to get a lawyer, because if I do, it will be because I feel or am being threatened outside my scope of control, and then I would be violently angry.  My mission in life would then be to ruin someone else's, regardless of personal or other cost.  Despite the common consensus, this is NOT what I want.  I just want to be fair, and to be shown fairness in return.  Considering permanent removal of the offender in question used to be my solution to infidelity, regardless of circumstances or severity, I think this is more than objective.  I suppose this goes back to my tendency towards the "all or nothing." approach to life.  I simply can not find an in-between, a useful, happy medium.  
  
I forgive, I understand, but I have moved on.  I do not feel guilty, I am done with remorse.  Remorse is useless, and dangerous.  Let it go, it will kill you, and make everyone else feel as if you have an insatiable appetite for attention and destruction.  There are some people I will simply never understand.  
  
I have discovered, through personal account, that it is possible to lie to yourself and everyone else to such an extent that you rationalize your actions into reality and suitability.  In short, you are doing the right thing, as far as you can see, but to everyone else it is obvious that you are missing various key points and facts.  It makes me sad to see it, but at the same time, I can do nothing about it.  Were the opportunity to present itself, I could be a friend, and perhaps offer some insight, but nothing more than this.
  
This divorce and all of the included "unknowns" are my most overwhelming and thought-consuming problem.  Closure; I need it! :)  he he...now I sound like a damn shrink.  Anywho, I hope for the best.  I hope for equity, for thoughtfulness, and for peace.  I do not wish anyone harm, regardless of what they have done.  When you truly love someone, and I have, it never goes away.  At the same time, however, reality is a bitch, and there are just some things that I will never get over.  I am the best friend a person could ever ask for, I think, but hell knows no fury, resolve, and insanity close to what I posses and to what being I become when backed into a corner with nothing left to lose.

      Today is a great day.  The sun is finally shining, the flowers are blooming, and the birds are chirping; at 0430 in the morning and waking me up though, but hey! :)  I could of course not go back to sleep, but that is ok.  I had an early night last night, and not early in the morning for once.  I do not really like going out all of the time, but I do it out of boredom.  If I can find a good reason not to, I do not.  Last night was all of the "girls" night out, so all of the guys did other stuff.  At any other time we all probably would have done the same, but there is a huge concert in town, and everyone, except me, went to that.  There is Korn there, Linkin Park, and a lot of other very cool bands.  Again, normally I would have gone, but after my "vacation" I am struggling to pay rent.  I am making some drastic lifestyle changes, so hopefully this will not be a recurring theme.  Once I pay my $500 dollar phone bill, I should be ok, I think.  Life is a bitch.... How the hell does anyone get a $500 dollar phone bill, you ask?  Believe you me, it is easy. :)  I did not call anyone local, I can tell you that.
  
Anyway, I got a car finally, a piece of junk, that is totally not my style, but it is "sensible" (how I hate that damn word), so it is better.  I also got the motorcycle, but I found out it is not as simple as it looks.  After several hours of practice, I overcame my fear of death and dismemberment (yes, even I thought of that), and took control.  However, the bike also leaves a bit to be desired, so it did not make it to the course for my license.  It is a great and fast bike, but the battery failed to care.  Damn,.....Looks like next week.  After all of the creativity that I had to put into acquiring a Euro license without a stateside one.  I should be a lawyer; a divorce lawyer..I love the challenge.  (deep breath) :)
  
Anywho, back to "girl's night out".  I want some input here, people.  I know why I go out, and it is not to "spend time with my friends".  That is retarded.  Get a bunch of guys, and a bunch of booze, and there is never anything harmless about it.  Women may be different, but my database on women disagrees, and finds it unlikely.  Yes, I know I am jaded, and all of that jazz, but I do not think anyone has all bad luck, do they?  We shall see.  I think it is the dumbest idea ever.  People are human, and this one can not mix liquor and women, and come out on top.  Actually, let me rephrase; ahead.  Pray tell, what do you think? I can hear all of you girls just waiting for the chance to let me know I am "dead wrong", and that we men are the only ones that think like this. ;) Experience is one hell of a teacher though, I can tell you that.  Experience the shit, and THEN learn.  The story of my life. :)
  
Anywho, that is all from me for now.  I am trying to be better at maintaining my BLOG, and Deb's too.  Now that I have all of this free time... What?  I have none... ;)  Check out this link though... urlLink WTF Mate?   He he..

      Today was a long, pointless day, not unlike the day before, and probably not unlike tomorrow.  
Flying was done 2 hours after I got to work, and I have spent the rest of the time doing nothing.  That is right.  Nothing.  I love this job.
  
I need to be at a busy base, with lots of traffic.  I am so tired of doing nothing.Last time I checked, I signed a contract for a job controlling traffic, not "flying a desk". Anyway, I guess you cannot win them all.
  
I sometimes wonder how other people perceive life.  What they think when they awake in the morning, what drives them to do what they do, all day, every day.  I hate monotony.  I live for a challenge.  Why do people go to college for years?  Is there a point to the never-ending cycle of studying, and testing?  Obviously for some there is a point, but plenty of people have degrees and no job.  Plenty more have one or both or neither.  I suppose it is all relative..Relatively insane.
  
Today I got a call at work, from Dana.  She called to tell me that she had taken it upon herself to email an old girlfriend of mine, and she just wanted to let me know.  Why exactly, I am not really sure, but thus is the nature of the beast, I suppose.  It is just really a sick and disturbed rational if you ask me.  I mean, I think I understand what she was doing, but that took a lot of effort, planning, and forethought, a lot more than I have time for. It is really psychotic and disturbing.  I almost had to laugh though.  It was like, did you wake up this morning determined to find some way to fuck with me, or what?  Sometimes I think that is the case.
  
Now, I have spent all week in heated, theatrical conversations with one woman or another.  Perhaps this is part of the problem.  I interact too much.  People are different.  Men and women are not even similar.  To get through a conversation with a woman having to do with anything that matters, and accomplish anything of lasting value, would be a new and exciting experience for me, I think. 
  
I heard that Freud died asking himself, "What do women want?".  The ironic thing about that is that no one knows, not even women.  It is funny, yet sick at the same time.  People, not just women, seem to want the unattainable, what they can't have, but only until they get it, then they want something else.  I have actually asked someone once what she wanted, and she said she had no idea!  This is after talking for 2 hours too.  Unbelievable.  That is enough to drive a man mad. :) Is it really too much to ask someone to know what they want?  I mean, I know that I am logical, and women are supposedly not, but hell.  How can you possibly expect someone to understand you when you do not even understand yourself?  That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard, and, believe me, I have heard some ridiculous shit.  
  
Here are 13 thoughts of the day, and not by me, but I share the sentiment.  Some are not very nice, but I found them funny.  Enjoy.
  
13.The first time you meet a woman, you need to go up and SLAP her as hard as you can in the face!
  
"Why would you want to slap her in the face?"
"That way later down the road she can't say, Brian why don't you treat me like you used to.?"
  
12. Life is sexually transmitted.
   
11. Good health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.
   
10. Men have two emotions: Hungry and Horny.  If you see him without an erection,  then make him a sandwich.
   
9. Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
   
8. Some people are like Slinkies.....not really good for anything, but you still can't help but smile when you see one tumble down  the stairs
  
7. Health nuts are going to feel really fucking stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing.
   
6. Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.
  
5. All of us could take a lesson from the weather.  It pays no attention to criticism.
   
4. Why does a slight tax increase cost you two hundred dollars and a substantial tax cut save you thirty cents?
   
3. In the Â60s people took acid to make the world weird.  Now the world is weird and   people take Prozac to make it normal.
   
2. Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession.  I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first. (figure that one out).
   
AND THE # 1 THOUGHT OF THE DAY:

Ha.  There is not one. All of that suspense for nothing.
  
I am ranting, aimlessly, just thinking on paper.  I go to Iraq again in 2 months, for 4+ now, and I cannot wait.  If I get the chance to stay longer, I will.  That is uncomplicated, cut and dry.  Do your job, go to your bunk, sleep for a few hours and do it again.  Simple.  No women either.  Probably the best part. I hate being alone, but I hate the drama worse.  I spend entirely too much time dealing with, thinking about and writing about it.
  
One of my boys just got back from Iraq today, so we are going to go celebrate. It should be a blast.

      I am back again.  Now I am at Coyote Cafe, where I can eat, drink and thanks to the wonder of modern wireless LAN, do work too.  Or... Play around on the internet.  They call them "Hot Spots"; I call them freedom from my room. :)  They are everywhere in Europe, and catching on pretty well in the US as well, I believe.  For a modest fee, less than you would spend on a drink, you can access the WWW for hours on end.  Since I do most of my work, both personal, school related, and Air Force required via internet, it is a real liberator for me.  
  
So, now that I am liberated, I can be one of the people who sit and play on their computers in public places and look busy....and I am. :) It beats the house, I will tell you that.  Deb, I am certain, can relate to spending hours in a room typing tirelessly on a computer, wishing we were somewhere else.  Now, I can have both; productivity and freedom to roam.  At any rate, I think it is the best thing since...well, damn near anything.
  
Now I am waiting for my food.  They do not know the meaning of customer service anywhere in Europe, so you have to be a snotty ass to get anything, which is right down my alley.  I live for this shit.  I know just enough German to get what I want, and to come across as knowing a lot more than I do.  Whatever.
  
I work days all of this week, which translates to getting up at 0400, and off at 1400.  Somehow, I find I have a lot less energy and motivation on day shifts than I do on swings.  I do not know why since the shifts are exactly the same length, but I never can seem to awaken at all on days.  Hmmmmmmm.... Who knows.  Can not sleep either, so it is a lose-lose situation.  Weekends are pretty cool though, since I get off at 1400 on Friday, and do not have to return to work until 1400 on Monday.  Not to shabby, by any stretch of the imagination.
  
I got paid yesterday, and every time I do, I marvel.  First I marvel that the government has not crashed yet and still found the funds to pay us, second I marvel that they pay me so much for so little (with the exception of deployments to hell, weekend duty, and 24 hour on-call status, but hey), and lastly I marvel at the rate at which the numbers dwindle.  I spent over $1000 dollars on phone bills this month.  Not this year, or this quarter, this month.  Un-fucking-believable.  I hate monopolies.  Frickin' Deutsch Telekom are the last surviving Nazis, I tell you that.  They send you a bill, and there is no argument.  If you do not like it, you can feel free to switch carriers, except there are no other damn carriers.  God bless the good ole' USA, and capitalism.  Socialism is a real bitch.
  
So, I am all hip now with the latest in technology, sitting in a cafe in Europe, and yet it seems surreal.  I have traveled and seen so much, there is really nothing overly cool left.  Perhaps when I am 50 I will look back and find this novel.  As of yet, I have not.  I have been to Amsterdam, France, Belgium and Luxembourg, all within the last quarter.  Novel, but normal still.  I am so easily bored.  Ah..... .WTF mate.
  
Some moron just knocked their little kid's chair over, and now they are screaming like hell.  People are so fucking stupid.  Why you would take your kid out with your friends while you got shitty drunk, I do not know, but it is pretty pathetic.  I have to feel bad for the child.  Stupid people.  When will they learn?  They should be drug out in the street and beaten severely, as should the guy who cooked this appetizer.  What the hell is this shit anyway?  Europeans kill me.  They take their kids out drinking with them all of the time.  It is custom, but whatever.  I have heard that there is a lesser rate of alcohol problems in Europe than in the US, credited to the tolerance they give, and the acceptance that is afforded, but I say bullshit to that.  I have been here for 3 years, and I can tell you that all these people do is drink.  Everyone, with few exceptions. I guess if intoxication is the norm, then it is easy to skew the numbers. :)  Cause the guy who published the report was probably downing a Weisen, or high.  :)

I had to post another post.  I was getting way to tired of reading the comments to "The Springer Show", as Deb so aptly dubbed my last post. :)  I am inclined to agree.  That was way to intense, so I will attempt to avoid that topic at all costs.  He he.. We will see how long that lasts.
  
Anyway, so not much new.  Dana and I are being civil (I guess), but it is to insane to even write about without getting a barrage of input, if you will, so I will save that for a later date.  It is hard to have an intelligent discussion about future relationship possibilities when she is dating somebody.  And by dating, I mean...  Anyway, I was not going to talk about that... :)
  
I have downgraded all of my "relationships" to friendships, because it is less stressful, at least for me.  Now I will work on me, since I apparently need an overhaul, according to popular opinion.  I just can not find anything to fix... :)  Hee hee... I am a goof.
  
Hmmmmmmm.....what to write about that is not a touchy subject.  Hmmmmmm,,, Hmmmmmmm,,,,,, Hmmmmm....  Well...I finally got fish.  Yes, I did (applause).  Six fish, in fact, and they have survived the night, so I am optimistic.  Until I go to Iraq, of course, at which time they will all die.  That is irrelevant though.  For now they provide me with hours of entertainment.  Not really, but they probably could.  I decided to move my tank downstairs out of my room, because it was to damn loud to sleep to.  Everyone always has some retarded idiosyncratic issue. How tiring.  Mom and Dad continue to give me much-needed, un-solicited,relatively undesired input on my life, but I suppose this is to be expected.  Just for the record, I do believe in God, and I know that humans are relatively stupid and incapable of doing much more than fucking stuff up, I just do not know what I want. Possibilities have never been the issue.  Choosing one has been, because people continue to change their minds, which in turn bothers mine.  And gives me a damn headache.  Indecisiveness is annoying at best, and infuriating normally.  I like to know what is going on, and what the future holds.  Nothing "concrete" exactly, but a general idea would be pleasant.  The wrong decision is better for me than being in limbo. I really hate it, and this is in reference to anything and everything.
  
I still have no car.  I mean, I do, but it is a piece of crap, and it irks me to see it.  It is not really mine either, since I am merely borrowing it, but I could purchase it, were I to choose to.  I do not think I could live with it.  It squeaks.  I detest squeaking from anything I cannot kill and make stop. If I decide to stay in the military, which will happen unless I get a job guarantee STAT, I will have my bonus to pay off all my bills, and actually afford the car that I want.  That will be refreshing, to say the least.  A BMW 330CI comes to mind.  I do not know, but I will probably get that upon my return from Iraq.. I love that country; I think I will vacation there over the holidays..and New Years as well.  Good stuff.... fun for all.  Camping; I love it.  Can I shoot something?  Plssssss:)
  
Back on relationships, briefly and non-specifically.  Perhaps the concept of "one strike, you're out" is not the best.  I do not know.  It has always been my stance on matters of faithfulness.  I am not so sure anymore though.  Perhaps I am being to stubborn and pig-headed, but to me it seems like a compromise of your standards, if you will, if you do not stick to your guns in situations of that magnitude.  I mean, realistically, how many tines do you forgive someone, or better yet, how many times should you have to.  I say none, but who knows.  It is open for discussion.  Not 24 comments worth, but some... :)
  
I think Dana should start her own BLOG.  Between the two of us, there would never be a dull moment, and I would have all kinds of new topics.  He he... then I might have to change the name of my BLOG to "As the World Turns" or something along those lines, since the rantings will no longer be random.  Perhaps my ratings will go up though... i doubt it. :)

This is the end of my non-specific, non-threatening post.  I feel like writing, so there is more nonsense to come.

      It is 11:30 at night, and I just got home from work.  I spent hours doing nothing again.  Not really nothing I suppose, but it felt like it, anyway.  There seems to always be some futile bit of paperwork for me to deal with, on a relatively continuous basis.  The experience level is so low at work, it is really frustrating sometimes.  I am forever pulling up audio records of the days events to figure out who screwed up where.  It is the beauty of ATC; EVERYTHING is recorded, and the tapes do not lie.  Digital audio tapes, but tapes nonetheless.  SO that was the  story for Friday.  I got to work at 0500, and did not get out of there until 2100 that night; and Friday was supposed to be slow and easy.  It all evens out though, except for the hours.  I make up for the easy days with the 16 hour ones.  If only people could exercise common sense more often and keep there proverbial heads out of there proverbial asses, I would be a happy camper.
  
I can not remember the last time I slept well.  I awaken 15 times a night, and that is not an exaggeration.  I grind my teeth.  I have nightmares, that never end.  I slept this way for 12 hours today, and feel like hell.  Tomorrow I will start running again, on a more consistent basis.  I still smoke, but not as much when I run consistently.  I do not really want to quit, but I hear it is detrimental to one's health.  That sucks.  I wish it were good for you.  Nothing I like is good for me it seems. I need therapy.. :) I joke, but who knows.  There is an alarm going off right now.  It is for the volunteer fire brigade.  It sounds like the bomb alarms from Israel...from Iraq too.  Disconcerting.  Still have the urge to run for cover.  Pretty damn freaky.  
  
Back to my nightmares.  On Sunday, I had a dream that I was standing on the airfield in Iraq, and there was a B-767 taking off.  It was coming straight towards me, started to lift off, lost control, slammed back down into runway 15, rolled and exploded everywhere.  Then there was fog and darkness, and I was scrambling for my latex gloves to go help look for survivors.  Blood and body parts everywhere, a man on a stretcher with no arms and half a jaw.  Reaching through a broken windscreen covered in blood and brain matter.  So real I gagged in my sleep, and I never gag.  This went on for 9 hours.  
  
Last night I dreamt that I was on the phone, and Dana was telling me she wanted the coffee tables again, and I was so angry I was shaking. Fucking coffee tables.  "If you want it, you can take it all away from me, it's all you'll ever have, cause I don't give a fuck"- courtesy  Puddle of Mudd , echoed with contempt by yours truly.
  
Mother and Dad want to come see me for 2 weeks.  While I love them very much, and would enjoy spending time with them, having them at my house for two weeks, two weeks that I have to work and go to school and maintain some level of sanity is, I believe, more than I am able to bear at the moment.  They reside in a place that is different from my reality.  That is fine, I am just unable/unwilling to accept any more constructive criticism at the moment.  I need to think, to find a way and a place to relax, but I can not escape this bullshit in my personal life long enough to think.  If I do not answer my phone for a couple of weeks, you can refer to this entry as to why that may be.  I am seriously considering it.
  
Last week was a traumatizing week in a lot of ways.  I had conversations with my newest ex-girlfriend that people of our limited background should never have to have.  Luckily for me, her, and the rest of the world, nothing materialized out of that one.  Now I am turning both cell phones off and disappearing from the face of the earth for a few...Days, weeks, who knows.  It is time to go stare at the ceiling for awhile, and fight my demons till the sun comes up.  I am completely absent of anything resembling human emotion with the exception of rage and disgust.

      since duece won't get off his lazy behind and post an update, i guess i'll have to do it myself! i'm sick of clicking on here to see what new madness he's wrought only to find that he hasn't posted since last month. priorities people. geez. i mean take me for example. i'm flying across the country tomorrow morning far earlier than i care to think about with less than 24 hours notice to pack, clean my house and eat all my produce, and what am i doing at a quarter to 11 p.m.? updating my blogs, thank you very much! i guess i'll be getting that vacation after all. unfortunately it involves a funeral on my in-laws' side of the family. sigh. i'd like to make it a priority to get together with family by choice instead of waiting for a funeral to bring us together. on to cheerier subjects. . .i will now share a recipe for an awesome lemon cream cake:
1 can sweetened condensed milk
1 tub of Cool Whip
1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice
mix together and pour into a graham cracker crust.
that's it! how easy is that?! looks beautiful and tastes heavenly. i made it tonight for the first time. it's been more than an hour since i ate a piece and i still feel sick! now that's the sign of a good dessert, hehehehehe.
enough babble.
duece, get your butt back on here and entertain your fans.

      Ok, ok, I admittedly am a slacker. :)  There, I said it.  I have been preoccupied with preoccupation for a week or so, so that is that.  Now I have returned (applause).

I hope everyone had a nice 4th of July weekend.  Mine was unbelievably eventful. I did more traveling and site seeing than I have the entire time I have been here this weekend alone. I am trying to think about what has happened of late.  I broke up with Natasha (the Russian), or t be more precise, she broke up with me because she loved me and saw no future with me because I am not planning to live here forever (figure that one out); right after I got back from Florida, in fact.  I had a lot of in depth conversations with her, and various other "ex's", but I simply could not comprehend exactly what they wanted, why they wanted it, and what strings were attached, so I stepped back again to think. Everyone wants a serious relationship, and that after a week, so I am at a loss.  I am a bit more "guarded" than before I suppose, but who knows.  Perhaps people should stop trying to "save" and "change" me.  I need time for this type thing, and when it happens, I will know. That was early week before last.

I did not sleep so well on Wednesday; got to bed at about 0100 a.m., and had to get up again at 0400 for a day shift.  My 8 hour shift turned into a 12 hour shift, I went home and worked out, and then had a friend over that Thursday night to bullshit with and catch up on some stuff.  No sleep that night either.

Friday rolls around, and I am the Devil because I have not slept in days, but it is Friday, so lighten upyahya? :) Ok, so I did, made it through the day, and then went out to volunteer at the 4th of July Bash they have every year here.  It is a little "fair" of sorts, but it is something for everyone to do, and all of the kids enjoy it.  After that chore was done, I went to Kaiserslauturn with a friend.  I have been there once since I have been here, and it was pretty lame, but I figured I would give it a shot again, so I did.  It is still a bit weird to be in a foreign country, with all of the fests and such, but it is cool nonetheless.  Anyway, I ended up seeing an Air Force girl on Friday that I had hung out with in the past, so we were going to hang out later after the fest.   That did not so much happen though.  It was me and a friend, his girlfriend, and all of her friends, in the middle of 10,000+ people, crammed into 3 city blocks- a bit crowded.  They sold 1 liter pitchers of beer for 3 Euro...I am sure you can imagine how the evening went.  We finally ended up at a little pub at about 0200 in the morning where we were supposed to be waiting for this American chick and her friend.  I have a short attention span, so after about an hour, I started talking to someone else.  Strangely, the other girl was not comfortable with this.  I will never learn, I suppose.

Anywho, stayed  up all night that night as well, and then I drove back to Spangdahlem, and proceeded as planned.  We drove to Masstritch, which is in Holland, went bar-hopping, saw some really cool art, got some food, and then ended up at a club called "Night Live".  Pretty cool, if I do say so myself.  Although, the music was a bit odd, to say the least.  They started off with 60's music, and then progressed all of the way past the 90's to typical R&B, which I detest.  It is, however, conducive to mayhem and madness and all other kinds of debauchery, so we had a good time.  I hooked up with some Italian chick there, and that was interesting to say the least.  That night, after 5 days awake, I slept like a baby.  Will not be pulling that stunt again for awhile, I do not think.

So, we somehow made it back to Germany alive and well, worked three days, recovered over the weekend, and now it is Tuesday, and all is well.  A friend that I met in K- town stayed with me all week, not really sure what that was about, but she was on vacation, so it was cool with me.  Whatever...I was at work.  A little much, but whatever.  Anyway, she went home today, and then back to Poland.  A weird week, at best, but she was happy, so I suppose one out of two happy is not bad.

Well, that is a very condensed version of the last few weeks.  Now, I am waiting for Mother and Dad to come visit at the end of the month, and then I suppose I will be forced to behave for awhile.  Like i said, I have an extremely short attention span, and am soooooooo easily bored, it is pathetic; even I will admit to that, but I need a challenge, and something or soomeone to keep my interest.  Who knows.  Perhaps it is just around the corner.  We can only wait and see....

PEACE!!!   :)

         This post was written on Wednesday of this week, it just took me this long to get online. :)  &nbsp;  I will also say that this a very difficult post for me, since it deals with yet another "personal" failure for me, much to many of which I seem to have had of late.     &nbsp; 
 In the words of the slightly eccentric&nbsp;Edward Norton, "On a long enough time line, everyone's probability of survival drops to  ZERO"  ( Fight Club, 1999 ). In short, if you "play" long enough, at anything, you will eventually run out of luck.&nbsp; 
  
It is said that experience is a hell of a teacher: it gives the test first, and then the lesson.&nbsp; I can definitely attest to that. &nbsp;Irony is a real son-of-a-bitch&nbsp;too.&nbsp; So, if you are wonderg where this is going, here it is.&nbsp; I have been abusing some sort of substance, heavily, since before&nbsp;I can remember.&nbsp; I am an adrenaline junkie, and bored way to easily.&nbsp; Personally, I could give a fuck, and it does not bother me at all, only everyone else that chooses to, either through boredom or actual concern, let me know that I need to "slow down", and that apparently everything kills you eventually.&nbsp; That is arguable.&nbsp; Anyway, I went out to meet a friend for dinner, had a glass or 2 of wine one night, and then I stopped by a bar and had a couple beers and shot the shit (so to speak).&nbsp; This all happened over the course of about 4 hours. &nbsp;I felt fine. &nbsp;At any rate, on the way home, I was driving to fast, missed my exit because my brakes locked up, and high-centered my car on a guardrail at 100 miles an hour.&nbsp; I was fine and the car was amazingly fine also, just precariously situated on a guardrail.&nbsp; Pretty unnatural looking, so it did not take long for the Polizei to show up (German pigs-cops, for the layperson), and haul my ass off to jail.&nbsp; I guess there is a first time for everything. 
  
Now, before we all start jumping on the band wagon and crucify me for my stupidity, I would like to point out something.&nbsp; If any of you have ever had a drink, taken medication or driven while having less than the optimal/suggested 8 hours of sleep, then you could just as easily been arrested for driving while impaired, or driving under the influence.&nbsp; The ironic thing is this:&nbsp; every time you drive while impaired (tired, intoxicated, etc), you accept a certain level of risk.&nbsp; Having survived and lived through this experience several times, unscathed, the perceived level of risk becomes less and less.&nbsp; Eventually, your accepted level of risk is quite high, yet it appears to be quite low, because you have been through this so many times, without consequence.&nbsp; Let me be the first to say that I am full aware that I am very lucky to be alive, and very lucky that no one else was involved, or injured, and my dialogue is in no way meant to justify any actions.&nbsp; Rather it is meant to explore the thought process in respect to how we as humans allow ourselves and rationalize our way into situations that we detest, and that defy any form of logic....and by we, I mean me.&nbsp; I just happened to reach the end of my luck.&nbsp; Yes, it sucks.&nbsp; I have no license now, I am in trouble at work, and I have to tell everyone to fuck off and get a life on a much more regular basis, but what can you do?&nbsp; 
  
Regret is a waste of an emotion; a total and complete waste.&nbsp; What is the point of ruing over something you have no control over, and that is over anyway? I am inclined to believe that living life in either the past or the future is, in essence, an exercise in futility.&nbsp; All we are guaranteed is this moment right now- nothing more, not even this next word..there.&nbsp; Live and learn.&nbsp; To live and not learn would be a tragedy, but if you end your day having learned something more than you started off knowing, then you are better off than you were before. &nbsp;Unfortunately, experience is the only teacher that seems to make a lasting impression on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    &nbsp; 
 So, I have been to see a shrink, ended up psycho-analyzing him into therapy, and am now back at work.&nbsp; I received no diagnosis, but was under the impression that they wanted to label as me as a "functioning alcoholic".&nbsp; What a cop-out.&nbsp; First of all, is there really such thing as a "non-functioning" alcoholic?&nbsp; Not for long, I bet.&nbsp; Also, if you are a "functioning" alcoholic, who really gives a fuck?&nbsp; There are plenty of people who are unable to function on any level, and do not even have a good excuse.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if you are functioning, who cares under what circumstances?&nbsp; Society is really pathetic in its assumptions of what is considered normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is more than willing to place the blame on anyone or anything other than the person who is obviously responsible.&nbsp; Alcohol and drugs never ruined anyone's life; the moron under the influence of them ruined his own life- he just might have been high or drunk while he was doing it.&nbsp; On top of it all, the Air Force encourages and promotes this lifestyle, and then hammers you, at random, when things go south. 
  
So, as you can see, I have had a hell of a couple of weeks. &nbsp;On a positive note, it is only a year without a license, and I will have great legs after riding 10 miles a day round-trip to and from work... Seriously though, I enjoy it.&nbsp; Also, after many failed attempts, I have finally quit smoking- no cheating, no desire for it even.&nbsp; Bonus...&nbsp;:)&nbsp; I must say, however, that de-tox is a bitch.&nbsp; My lungs are hacking up all kinds of gunk in an effort to rejuvenate themselves, and I feel a bit disconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, "disconnected" is a gross underestimation- I feel completely out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well, it will be worth it in the long run, yes?&nbsp; I have physically never felt worse. 
  
Life is a gift.&nbsp; Find something every day to be happy about, and hold on to it all day long.&nbsp; If you look hard enough and long enough, you will find a reason to smile and make the best out of everything. 
  
Oh yeah, and "K-town" is Kaiserslautern, Germany, Deb, close to Frankfurt.&nbsp;:)

       Velvet Jones.&nbsp; Where he got this name, I do not know, but it humors me.&nbsp; "Ladies and gentleman, Velvet Jones, Silky Johnson, and Buck Nasty are in the building....."&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick-names are juvenile, at best, but again, I really do find it amusing, and so does the rest of the general population, so it is cool.&nbsp; We have a blast just being ourselves, no excuses, no apologies to anyone.&nbsp; I think we thrive on each other's blatant disregard for anything that approaches giving a damn. 
   
 Today was a so-called "training day" at work, which consisted of boring briefings covering topics that a damn monkey could teach to an amoeba, or vice-versa.&nbsp; Of course, I felt inclined to let everyone know that the ability to take a simple topic and translate it using big words does not make it difficult and complex, but rather makes you an idiot and obviously way to bored.&nbsp; So get a job.... My philosophy.&nbsp; Interesting day, and yet another exercise in futility.&nbsp; Perhaps I should get out of this military after all.&nbsp; My idiot tolerance is way the hell down.&nbsp; Of course, we had the briefing about DUI's, and the whole thing was conducted as if I was invisible, and no one had a clue as to who they were talking about, which of course pissed me off.&nbsp; So, I raised my hand and told the audience that it was a cop-out to expect your buddy to watch out for you, and that we all have free will, and that there is such a thing as personal responsibility, so take it, and quit looking for a damn scape goat.&nbsp; I got&nbsp;kudos from the audience, and evil looks from the moronic briefer, but please.&nbsp; I hate hypocrites.&nbsp; Nothing is more nauseating.&nbsp; 
   
 Anyway, I still have not come up with a bike, so tomorrow I will walk to work.&nbsp; It should take no longer than an hour and a half, so fuck it.&nbsp; I am to stubborn to make someone else go out of there way just because I fucked up.&nbsp; Call it as you see it.... 
   
 Mother and Dad come next week, and I took the week off to be with them, and not have to walk to work, so that should be interesting.&nbsp; Mother is just worried and wants to see me, and who knows what Dad wants.&nbsp; I love them both, but I am somehow not very tolerant of criticism at the moment, constructive or otherwise.&nbsp; I am not a simpleton, and I am fully aware of right, wrong, and everything in between, and do not need a life lesson in anything. 
   
 I spoke with my daughters today.&nbsp; I want to try to call them every other day, because they sound so happy to hear me.&nbsp; It rips my heart out every time I hear there voices, and I want to throw my cordless every time I get off the phone. It sometimes seems impossible to have a normal conversation, and I just want to scream.&nbsp; So since it is obviously affecting me in a very negative way, I will avoid conversation until I no longer have homicidal tendencies.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Seriously though, this level of interaction with someone you once knew itimately is enough to drive anyone mad. 
   
 .....and now I am back to my writing of my book, and to play, and sleep, and dream....and no, I do not need therapy.&nbsp; I need to be left alone, and not fucked with for a long enough time so as to allow me the necessary space and solitude to adjust and move on and live and love......etc. 
   
 After Mother and Dad leave, I am taking a week of leave and will travel by train, explore this silly little nazi country and camp wherever I go.&nbsp; I am bored, pissed and in desparate need of being around no one that I know. 
    &nbsp;No phone calls, I am fine,.... really.&nbsp;

      It is official.&nbsp; Jazz is my all-time favorite music.&nbsp; A close second is classical, and then all the rest.&nbsp; I know... a true shocker.&nbsp; You thought it was metal, I know.&nbsp; I do enjoy the raging hate&nbsp;music as well,&nbsp;but at&nbsp;my best, I am listening to&nbsp;jazz.&nbsp; I enjoy nothing, and I do mean nothing better that a glass of rich, red wine, and a smoooothe jazz tune.&nbsp; Nothing at all.&nbsp; Not even sex. (gasp) 
  
Velvet Jones is the nickname for my friend Shawn.&nbsp; We are exactly alike, only I am more insane, if you will.&nbsp;&nbsp; He refers to me as either Silky Johnson, or Sundae, both of which have stories behind the names, as does his.&nbsp; We will not elaborate, because I do not have the temperament at present to&nbsp;deal with the fall-out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  
Back to the topic at&nbsp;hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;Consequently, he is cool as hell, and we have a really good time together.&nbsp; always out of control, but in a good way.&nbsp;&nbsp; :) We compliment each other, and make life fun, and leave a lot of happy people in our wake.&nbsp; I have no one in my past that I do not consider a close friend, as far as romantic encounters are concerned.&nbsp; Seriously. 
  
I must say, I am happy and surprised with the reaction from friends and family regarding my recent slip in judgment.&nbsp; I know I say I do not care what anyone thinks, and that is true, with the exception of the ones I love.&nbsp; Yes, I love too. 
  
I miss it.&nbsp; I miss the feeling of euphoria when you are with someone truly unique. 

More to come....

       I can not believe it is already August. This year has flown by, and definitely been the most traumatic one for me yet. I really hope that next year at this time, I will not be saying the same thing.
         Life presents a lot to think about. Half of what seemed important yesterday seems pointless and completely irrelevant to me today. I must truly be an interesting and challenging person to live/interact with. I can pull a complete 180 from one day to the next and apparently do it often. I have spent the last few years VERY confused, and extremely hostile, as well as completely indifferent to anyone other than myself. I do not consider myself to be selfish by nature, but perhaps I can be a little less than considerate sometimes. I really dislike all of this "soul-searching", etc., but I suppose it is something that needs to be done eventually. I hate being so stressed out. Sometimes it seems that nothing wants to work right. I still want to get on a train, and just ride for like a week and see what there is to see. I think it would be cool.            This BLOG has definitely been therapeutic. There is a lot to be said for getting your thoughts out on paper, although I am not sure about everyone being able to read and respond to them. Half the time, I read my posts and think, "Did I really go there, again? Did I say that?". :) Then I have to refrain from going back and deleting half of it, so as not to offend anyone.      Three Doors Down..."Here Without You" is officially the most depressing song to date, that I have ever heard. I watched "The Butterfly Effect" last night also. I found it to be quite disturbing. I hate that movie.      So today is Sunday, and I have done nothing all day long. Mother and Dad are here, and are of course showing there concern. I do not like to be lectured, but it is my parents, so I suppose they are allowed. I think I am going to go to sleep tonight, and not get up until tomorrow afternoon. Perhaps then I will feel better.      I rode my bike to work all last week. It is 6 miles each way, and it is all very hilly. If I had to pick a place to train for endurance, this route would be the one for me. After 60 miles a week, I should be in pretty good shape. :) Right now I am just sore though. Really fucking sore.        I really do not have a whole lot to say today. I feel disconnected, and completely out of control, in damn near every way. Not a normal feeling for me. Anyway, I am pretty tired, so I am going to crash now. Maybe tomorrow I will be able to think again .

       I am wicked bored. Mom and Dad are down in the den watching a movie, but it is from 1978 or something, and I can not bear it any longer. I know they mean well, but I barely posses the ability to sit still long enough to watch a movie that I want to watch. I told them I needed to get some stuff done real quick, so they would not feel like they were abandoning me. Truthfully, I need a minute to myself. Probably due mostly to the fact that I am used to living alone, but also because concern can be a bit overbearing at times, through no fault of their own.     Today is a gorgeous day. Dad and I walked the 2 miles up to the Duetsch Post to pick up some certified mail. It ended up being a letter and my military driver license, but I am not sure what that means. I do not know way they would send it back to me, but I will have to look into it. So far, That is all I have heard. We will see.     I slept terribly last night, awakening every hour or so, until about 0600. After that, I slept well until 1100, and have been up since. I do not know why I sleep so poorly. I guess I think to much, but at the moment, there is much to think about. I called yesterday and talked to the girls. I am so tired of dodging questions that I do not know how to answer. Danica, the baby, always asks me when I am going to come see her, and why I am not there now. Mercedes is always "visibly" happy to talk, but does not ask a lot of questions. I told her that I would try to work out a way to see them soon one way or another, and she said "Yea yea!!". I guess that means she approves... :) This twice a year visitation plan that was thrown around for awhile is definitely not going to fly. I am really unsure of how to handle any of this, and it is not getting easier, but instead it is getting harder. There just seems to be no winners, only losers in every facet of this ordeal.     Since I did end up getting a week off from work, I will try to relax a bit as well as spend time with Mother and Dad. It has been a really long time since I have seen them, and I did not realize how much different it is having people with you, than it is living alone. Not a bad different, just a different-different. It is definitely nice to see them though.     I have not smoked a cigarette since the 13th of July, and I do not crave then still, so I am happy with that development. I am still working on my degree, and taking some computer-based, computer classes on the side as well. The computer-based classes are through the Air Force Training site, but they will help me to get certified from Microsoft in several hardware and software disciplines. Other than that, I believe them to be useless, but I am not sure. The Air Force thinks it means you are "motivated" though, so whatever, and it helps relieve boredom. Computers are very interesting to me, both in the hardware and software sectors.     Yeah. So, anyway..... I read one of my previous posts, and in it I said something to the affect that I was friends with everyone that I had ever dated..... I was thinking about that, why I do not know, and decided that was not really true. Truthfully, I do not really care to put the effort into much of anything unless it seems worth it in the long run, and have no patience whatsoever for anything other than complete honesty and upfrontness, and no bullshit whatsoever. Every time that I am with someone and things get "complicated", which I refer to as "stupid", I bail. By "bail", I mean I quit, and move on. I do not know if that makes me a selfish or bad person, but I guess if I really gave a damn whether it worked out or not, I would try harder. Since I do not try at all, I guess that means I do not really care. Hmmmmmmm.... I will have to think about what that means.     AT any rate, :) I guess I will go do something productive now. I want to go do something, but Mother and Dad do not have very many exciting hobbies, and are not very open to suggestions, so I am at an impasse. I introduced them to German culture via a Wine Fest, but since they do not drink wine, they were a bit bored. Although, they did get to watch me drink it, so perhaps that was entertaining. :)     I think I am hungry now...
