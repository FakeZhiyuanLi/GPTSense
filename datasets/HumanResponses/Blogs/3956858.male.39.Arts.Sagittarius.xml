      Spend my last few yen in the airport shops. Board the flight, a 777, got lucky and got a window seat. Take off from Osaka Kansai Airport, which is a man-made island. Pretty cool. Have video in the headrest in front of me, and 9 channels to choose from. Of course, I have seen most of the movies showing. Oh well, start reading a John Grisham novel I borrowed from our FOH engineer. Good book, but a fast read, I'll be done with it a third of the way into the flight.  Dinner is served. Pork Cutlets with Curry. The entire plane smells like curry. My wife would die, she hates the smell or thought of curry. Sorry Paige. The cutlets look more like McNuggets. Not bad though. I can't wait to get home and fire up the grill. No more Asian food for awhile. Paige will be overjoyed!!  Can't sleep too well. Manage a few hours after I plow through the Grisham novel. Seems like they serve food on flight every ten minutes. There is also a screaming baby one row up from me. I try to keep my headphones on and the tunes blasting.   Finally arrive in Chicago. Wait for my bags, they both arrive safely. Score. Clear customs without incident. I have to recheck my bag to RDU, this process is a mess, they basically have people in a hallway manually checking bags and putting them on the belt. I leave my bags with a gentleman and take off for the train ride to the domestic terminal. Hope my bags make it.  Get on the train to domestic terminal, still don't know my gate number. I have to go through security again. On the other side I finally find out my gate is in the C terminal. OK, now a nice long walk. Grab a Chai Tea at Starbucks, and wait the 1.5 hours for my connection to RDU. More time to write to my Blog, this time posting wirelessly from my phone/pda.   While I'm waiting, Mr. Self Important Yuppie Twit talks business loudly on his cell phone so all can hear. Don't these people understand that no one wants to hear about their latest deal while we're waiting. Board plane, find my seat, Mr Yuppie Twit is behind me and stays on the phone till the flight attendant makes him shut it off. Flight leaves 30min late, I don't notice as I pass out once I hit the seat. As soon as we're airborne, I lean my seat ALL the way back,  to give Mr. Twit some inconvenience.   Sleep most of the flight, land in Raleigh late. Bags are late, Paige has to circle. All my bags make it though. Head home for a little over a week off. Stay tuned as I upload all my Japan pictures to a separate site.

      Up at 7am on the dot. Lobby call is 2pm for our 6pm flight. Go to McD's  for breakfast, then off to shop in the arcades for the last time. Buy a  few more gifts, run out of yen, stop at a small guitar shop on the way  back to the hotel (buy nothing honey). Drop off stuff at the room, head  out to the City Mall next door to the hotel, didn't make it there last  time. Buy a few more things with my credit card. Then, back to the room  for a shower and lobby call.  Get on the bus at 2pm, one hour drive to the airport. Fall asleep, of  course. Arrive at the airport, check-in. The airline gives me 110000  yen for losing my luggage on the way here. Great, now I have $110 to  spend at the airport. I change $100 into US. Keep around $10 to spend  in the airport. Arrive at the gate, open computer and boom wireless!!  So I'm uploading this to the blog before my flight. Cool.

      Wake up at 5am, stay in bed till 6. Check emails, drink tea, shower, then off to the train station at 7am. We take the Bullet Train to Osaka (about 2hrs). We're the lucky ones, some of the crew had to take a passenger bus last night to Osaka, time 10hrs. I feel for those guys. They really should invest in some tour buses over here, and not the crappy Euro ones, but a nice Custom Prevost. Ahhhhh.  Arrive at the gig around 10:30am. Doors are already open, load in and setup on side of the stage. Hang out more with the Who crew. Nice geezers. Watch the opening band Love Psychedelico (?), kinda the Japanese Sheryl Crow. At least its not as hot as Yokohama, as we are indoors. Still hot though. Have gyozas and rice in catering for lunch. More hanging around, since we don't go on till 7pm. Trade picks with Alan, Pete's tech. He has some good ones, as he also worked for Harrison and The Stones.  Finally it's time for The Who set. They have trouble with the drum monitors, and go on 30min late. Hey, it happens at festivals, when you get no soundcheck. We all watch their set again, stellar. Brad and I watch from behind Pete's amps, you can hear them great here. I can tell Brad is really getting charged up for our show. I go and stand by Alan, he shows me one of Pete's guitars that has blood all over the pickguard. Cool. Set ends. Amazing.  We go on late, due to The Who technical difficulties. Brad is in rare form tonight, he really got revved up watching Pete. The band calls all kind of audibles, and some golden oldies get played that weren't on the set list. All in all a pretty good show. Load out, tonight it takes twice as long to load the truck. What? Same guys that have packed it the entire time here, can't get it right tonight. The sound truck is almost done loading by the time our guys finally figure it out. Weird. Back to the hotel for a shower and some sleep. Will repack tomorrow for the flight home at 6pm.

      Sleep in to around 8, sure is hard when the sun hit's the windows at 5  am. I've now finished my last book, so not to much to do. Read emails,  drink green tea. By 10am I'm bored, decide to head to the gig at noon,  at least there's food and high speed internet. Arrive at the gig, our  crew room is packed, everybody's online. We call out a search for the  Godzilla  scream, someone comes up with it and soon all you can hear is  the call of the mighty Godzilla. Funny. Go up to the stage, catch a  little of Michelle Branch while setting up my gear, it is 97ï¿½ inside  our guitar world. Yikes. Hangout for a while then head inside for the  air conditioning. Have some lunch, curry again.  Go out around 4:30pm to get ready to see The Who at 5. Grab a set list  from my buddy Alan, wow nothing but hits. Gonna be hard to follow these  guys. By showtime, the wings are filled with all of our band members  and family. The Who are amazing, Zack Starkey (Ringo's kid) is on drums  and emulates Keith Moon to a T. I watch or listen to the entire  show,while setting up. The crowd loves them, hard to believe this is  their first show ever in Japan. It'll be cool to see it again tomorrow  too.  Sun is setting as we go on around 7:30pm. Pete Townshend is off-stage  left as we wait for our guys, I grab a chance to have him autograph a  guitar magazine for me. He obliges, an English gentleman. Our show is  good, but it's hard to follow such a stellar set by rock legends.  Finish up and load out, back to the hotel by 10:15pm. Must have my bag  down by 11pm for the truck, since we are going directly to the gig  tomorrow at 7am. Ouch. Grab a shower, then off to bed.

      Get up at 8am. Plan on meeting some guys in the lobby at 9:30 to head into Tokyo to the "Motorcycle Street". At 9:30 gather up the guys and head in, Rob comes along again, as well as his wife, who flew in last night. I am the tour guide, as I have the only map and seem to know the train system. We can take either the Bullet Train (15min.) or the regular JR Commuter line (90min), the Bullet being 3x as expensive at around $15. We opt for the Commuter, as we are in no hurry and we'll probably take the Bullet back from Tokyo. We have to make two connections, but I find an Express train that should save some time.   Train ride is not a problem, we hit Tokyo Station in about an hour. It is huge, about like Penn Station in NYC, with the Bullet, JR Commuter, and JR Subway all from the same station. We find our connection and make Ueno in about 15min. We stop at the Corin store first, this is the big one that was closed last Wednesday. It is 8 floors of helmets, jackets, and shoes. Wow. We hit a few of the same shops as well, since Gary and Jerry, who also came along, missed those on Wed. I take a few more pictures for the die hard biker boys at home (you know who you are). I even see a shop with three used Ducati's. Cool. Break down and buy some ELF riding boots and a cool commuter riding bag and a few gifts. Can't get this stuff at home, plus it was on sale. Gary gets his BUCO helmet visors he was looking for, and we head back to the train station bound for Akihabara or "Electric Town".  One stop away we arrive at Electric Town. This place is a crazy mix of electronic department stores (that put Best Buy and Circuit City to shame) and strange little flea market booths selling the widest assortment of electronic parts anywhere. I'm there for the flea market, as I've done the big stores in the past. It's lunch time so we hunt around for some food, the noodle shop in the train station looks good, except you have to order through a ticket machine, and there's no English in sight. Sigh. Oh well, looks like McDonald's. Rob and Ellen pass on McD's and head out on their own. I give them one of my train maps, they'll be fine.  After eating we hit the flea market booths, which is several hallways about 100ft long and maybe 4ft wide with booths on both sides. Cramped doesn't even begin to describe this place. There are all kinds of spy cameras, computer parts, tubes, capacitors, resistors, wires, and tools here. Not really looking for anything specific, it's just fun to check out. Gary has never been and his mind is blown. Look at a few other shops, then head for Tokyo Station and the Bullet Train to Yokohama.  Arrive at Tokyo Station, but none of us can figure out which Bullet train to get on for Yokohama. After 20min. of trying, we give up and head for the JR express we took this morning. Find the express and within an hour we are back in Yokohama. Up to the room to rest and get out of the heat.  At 7pm, meet others in lobby to hit our #1 favorite noodle shop for dinner (this will be dinner number four there). Soon they will be greeting us there like Norm in "Cheers". Eat more great noodles and gyoza and see a few crew members there. Head back to the hotel and visit the grocery store in the basement. Find the prices are more than the convenience store, so we head for the Lawson's for provisions. Back to the room for a DVD and much needed sleep.

      After staying up till 2am last night, I get up around 8:30 this morning. Not too bad. Skip McD's since I'm still full from Ramen last night. Around 10am I wander over to the attached department store. Then check out the basement of the hotel, which is a high end supermarket/deli kinda like Dean and Deluca. Will go back before we leave to get some stuff to take home.   Leave the hotel at 2pm to set-up for the gig at Yokohama International Stadium. Eat some Curry Chicken in catering for lunch, then go load in. This place is a huge outdoor soccer stadium. They played the World Cup here a few years ago. We're done by 5pm. Time to head back to the hotel and take a big group out to our favorite noodle shop.  Run into The Who crew in the lobby. Great guys, hope they'll get to join us for dinner. Gather almost the entire backline crew and a few others and head to the Noodle Shop, not too crowded, so no wait. Get two tables and order. A few more guys pass by the window, see us and come in to join us. Then the Who crew stops in, but have to wait for a table. A few others from our crew are waiting as well. Soon there won't be anyone in the place who's not a crew guy. Those who hadn't been before are raving about it. We finish eating, as we're all stuffed, decide to walk it off. Jerry and I end up walking around with with the lads from the Who crew. These guys have collectively been in this business for probably 50+ years, they've seen it all and have great stories to tell. I hip one of them to the Key Lime Kit-Kat's they have over here and he's on a mission to find some. We hit a few convenience stores, score the Kit-Kat's and head back to the hotel.  Make plans with a few guys to head into Tokyo to the 'Motorcycle Street' again in the morning. That should kill a good part of our last day off in Japan. I end up falling asleep watching a DVD.

      Sleep till my alarm goes off at 7:30. I promised one of the carpenter's, and fellow motorcycle enthusiast, Rob that we'd go down to 'Motorcycle Street' before our bus call at 12:30pm. Grab breakfast at McD's, I know, I know. Read in the paper that yesterday was an all-time high temp wise in Tokyo. 103 degrees, ouch. I notice another odd thing about the Japanese, no one wears sunglasses. And it is plenty bright! No shorts, no sunglasses, weird.  Meet Rob at 10 and we take the JR train to Ueno. We arrive and start looking around for our 'street'. Man, this station is huge. We walk around outside and finally spot a cycle shop, this must be the place! We head down the alley and it opens up to a big street lined on both sides with bike shops. It's still before 11, so not all are open. We hit the open ones, these shops have more helmets, gloves, jackets, etc. than I've ever seen in one place. Awesome! Also, some shops are all high-performance parts of every description, but few Ducati parts :( Oh well, there are alot of used bikes for sale on the sidewalk of the shops too. Some great deals on some cool bikes. Just don't think they'll fit in my suitcase. As it turns out the biggest store is closed on Wednesdays. Bummer. We walk around looking in the shops till it's time to head back to the hotel for lobby call. Neither of us buys anything, but we just know what we want is in those closed stores. May have to train it back on Friday and check it out again.  Back at the hotel, we checkout and wait for the buses. I get down in time to get on the second bus. It takes almost 45min. for it to arrive, but it gives everyone plenty of time to chat with the crew members who are heading home today (they're not needed for the festivals). Bus arrives, we depart for Yokohama. I sleep most of the way, being hot and tired after our morning of walking around.  Check into the hotel in Yokohama, it is a 43 story round building. I'm on the 28th floor and have a cool view of the city. Outside my window is also the bullet train tracks, and one goes speeding by every few minutes. Head out for lunch and find a quaint little noodle shop. They even have one English menu with pictures. Order gyozas and chinese bumplings (actually dumpling, but that's how it was spelled on the menu). Delicious. Best gyozas yet. May have to hit it for dinner too. Run into the 7-11 for provisions and back to the hotel to chill. looks like rain anyways.  After posting on this weblog, fall asleep  till around 7:30pm. One of the guys calls and we decide to go out to dinner. Run into one of our regular sound guys, Fumi, who happens to be Japanese, and head out to find some grub. We pass the place we stopped for lunch, but decide to search around some more, especially since Fumi can at least read the signs and we don't have to resort to pictures or plastic food displays. End up back at the same place we stopped for lunch, it is now packed and there's a line out the door. Well, it must be THE place then. Put our name on the list, and shortly we have a table. Order Ramen with shrimp and chicken wontons, it is amazing. Everyone agrees this is the best Ramen so far. Turns out this is a small family owned place going back three generations. It's even open till 4am, bet they get great after hours business.  Back to the room, watch a few DVD's, write some emails, etc. then go to sleep.

      Wow, sleep till 7:30 this morning. Skip McD's as we're going to the gig at 10. Get to the gig, it's a huge indoor baseball stadium with an 'air roof'. This means the whole dome is pressurized and the roof is held up by the air pressure. This of course means we cannot hang our lights and sound off the roof. A series of towers are built to hold a grid of trusses that the lights, sound, and video wall are hung off of. Pretty impressive, and a little scary when your standing under it all day.  Band arrives in the afternoon, no soundcheck today. All of the bands families are here now, and I do mean all. the dressing room hall way is like a zoo and barely passable with all the kids and guests hanging out. I go to the bass player's dressing room to show him my Mosrite (he is a huge Venture's and Mosrite fan) and rub my purchase in a little.  Hey, he can afford a REAL one. Mine's a fake, but it looks real and not too many people can tell the difference.  Have pasta with chicken and grilled tuna for dinner in catering. Good stuff. Show is at 7, and it flies by. Our monitor mix sounds great and the boss is happier than usual. Load out the gear and my regular truck driver isn't around. In fact, there's a completely different guy packing the truck. By the time he gets to the end I'm not sure it's all going to fit, but he makes it happen. Back to the room for a shower and some sleep.

      Can't sleep past 7am today. Get up and check email and read the Japan Times. Everyone keeps saying I'm eating too much McDonald's. I agree, but I've been just trying to go for breakfast, need fuel for these 5hr+ days of walking. So, I get my hotcakes this morning around 9am, nuff said. Head to the JR (Japan Rail) train station and head towards Harajuku. Have to take two trains, but it's easy and we get there in under 30min. Pretty crowded on the train, as it is some kind of shopping holiday. Arrive in Harajuku and the streets are full of people.  First stop is Kiddie Land, a 5 floor toy store, where I always buy some gifts for my nephews and others. After Kiddie Land, we walk around checking out the small shops on the back streets. I try to find the Paul Frank store, but never see it. Bummer. (realize when I get back to the room and look at the map, that it is actually inside a department store). Hit my favorite thrift store "Chicago", but don't see anything. Get back on the JR and head back towards the hotel.  Stop in Ochanomisu to check out the guitar stores again. Not as crowded as yesterday. Find my Mosrite, and after a little dickering with the guy, I buy it. Sorry Paige. I end up paying half of what the new ones are going for, so I think I got a deal. Now something will have to go on eBay when I get home. Jerry talks himself out of the Gretsch he was going to buy, it's a good deal, but he walks. He has more willpower than me, I guess. We check out a few more guitar stores and head back to the hotel on the JR, man this guitar is heavy.  Arrive at the station and we decide to be daring and try the 'Squid' balls they sell at a stand across from the hotel. We watched them make some last night and they looked intriguing (kinda like fish cakes). We buy a box of 6, medium spicy and take them back to the room. Bite into the first one, not terrible, but not fish cakes either. Sort of like eating eyeballs or something. Well, it was worth a shot. Chill in the room for a while, gonna go over to the gig later and see what's up.  Go over to the gig to upload some pictures using the free high speed connection. Decide to dine in catering (hey, it's free), fried rice and cashew chicken. Yummy. Surf the internet with about half of our crew, hanging out in our designated 'crew room'. Nice when you don't have a bus to go to on the downtime. Back to the room for reading and sleep.

       Wow, slept till my alarm went off at 7:15am. I'll beat this jetlag just in time to leave for the States. Up early to create this new blog, I like the layout better and it's easier to upload pictures. Hope you like it. Talk to my Mom on IM for awhile, their house seems to be coming along nicely. Att 11 we're of on the bullet train again, this time to Tokyo. We have 2 days off before the show, plan on doing some guitar shopping, and we're going to try and catch a baseball game if we can get tickets. I'm off to email this new blog address to everyone (even though I spelled my user name wrong, as guitaretch, is that a Freudian slip?).  Arrive in Tokyo, buses can't park at the station. We cross the street and wait in the hot sun for 10min. till the bus arrives. Bus takes us to the Tokyo Dome Hotel (right next to the gig), travel time 30min. Immediately head out to go guitar shopping in Ochanomizu. First stop at McD's, must have a quick bite. Short walk to the JR train station. we are only going one stop to Ochanomizu. One problem, the JR map is all in Japanese, usually it is in English too. Anyway, figure out our fare is 130yen and get a ticket from the machine. At least the platform signs are in English.   It's a short ride to our stop and we get off and it looks like 48th Street in NYC, nothing but music stores. I'm looking to score a deal on a Mosrite (Japanese) and I'm disappointed in the stock in most of the stores. We make some new friends at one store by handing out autographed picks. One salesman even has the Gretsch logo shaved in the side of his head. Cool. At the last shop I find a black Mosrite Ventures for a deal. Decide to wait till tomorrow to get it, as I might find something else in my travels. Besides, it's nearby. We walk back from Ochanomizu about 20min. but not bad. Head up to the room to write and check emails.  Out to a noodle shop for dinner. Have Ramen with bell peppers and chicken, also gyoza, and rice. All for under $7. Baseball game is letting out as we're walking back and we're swimming against the tide. Make it into the hotel and there is a queue for the elevators. Luckily the line moves fast. Back to the room for the night. Do some reading and crash.

      Sleep late again (6:30am). No McD's in sight so I drink green tea and surf the 'net till lobby call at 10am. Van to gig, 45min.  Gear is already on stage when we arrive. Damn, the Japanese are good. Have my laundry sent out, hope it's not too expensive.  Set up, and line check, done by 1pm. Do photo shoot with Japanese guitar magazine. They want to shoot all 20 of my guitars,  takes no time, done by 2pm. Doors are at 3pm and show at 5pm. Wow. Show goes well, band throws a few nuggets in for good measure.  Load out, back at hotel by 8:30pm. Seems later. Oh well, shower and take my bag down to the lobby to be sent ahead. Time to  read. I just started on my last book, think I'll need to trade around with someone before the tour ends.

      Sleep till 7 this morning, probably due to the late night (for me at least). Go down to the McDonald's in the basement, much shorter walk. See numerous fellow crew members eating. Hang out for a bit, then back to the room to get my stuff together for the trip to Nagoya. Train station is 30min. away of course. We ride the Bullet Train again, takes 2.5hrs. to get to Nagoya.  Arrive in Nagoya. Hotel is only 20min. away this time. Get to my room an there's my bag. Score!! This hotel also has free high speed internet. Score again!! I'll be able to finally publish this blog today.  Head out for some lunch, and it's after 2pm, so everything's closed again. Walk by the Hard Rock Cafe and decide it's hot, and probably we'll do no better foodwise. Meet the other half of the backline crew there. I have Blackened Chicken Pasta, and it is amazing. Or probably mediocre, but after the Cup O' Noodles it's killer. It comes with a price, $16. Wayyyyy too expensive, but what are you going to do. I'm now stuffed, we linger a while watching the lame videos they are playing and looking at the memorabilia on the walls.   Stop by the Lawson's on the way back for a big bottle of water. Head up to the room to do some web surfing and blog writing. After uploading this blog, fighting to stay awake. Decide to go for a walk, dark now and cooled down to 90. Hit the convenience store for ice cream (too full from lunch to eat dinner). Head back to the room to IM my lovely wife and read till I fall asleep.

      Sleep in till 6am. Must go to McDonald's at 8am, I think it's the law now. Walk the 3 blocks to the arcade and the closest McD's. Today I discover how to Supersize my Orange Juice, this is a major breakthrough. After breakfast, walk around the arcade, go in a few stores that are open (still early). Head back to the hotel to get some more yen.   Decide to go to the Peace Park and the Atomic Bomb Museum (might as well get some culture). Arrive at the Peace Park a few blocks from the hotel. There is a building called the Atomic Dome, which partially survived the nuclear bomb of 1945. We enter the museum and start the tour. This is a somber place, and a sobering tribute to the atrocities of war. The nuclear bomb that ended WWII killed around 200,000 of Hiroshima's citizens. We now have bombs thousands of times as deadly as that one. Wow. Leave the museum a little sullen, but glad that I went.  Walk around some more and decide to shop for gifts and spend $100 easy. It sure goes fast around here. My legs are starting to hurt from all the walking, plus these bags are getting heavy. Quick stop at McD's for lunch, don't feel like trying to find anything else. Back to the room and oops another nap. Wake up around 7:30pm. Not too hungry, but walk out the side door of the hotel and see food signs. there seems to be 5 floors of restaurants right next to the hotel. Why did I not see this before. Scope them out, but most are closing. I do see that there is a McD's in the basement, right under the hotel. Doh!! Make note for tomorrow morning.   Oh well, back to the Lawson's for Cup O' Noodle.  Take my bag down about 10pm and before I can even get out of the elevator the bellman is taking my bag from me. I ask him to put it with the other crew bags. I get a blank stare. I follow him and he finds another bellman, after many hand gestures, we seem to agree that my bag will go with the others. I pray it is at the hotel when I get there. I don't want to lose it again. Read till 1:30am.

      Down to Mickey D's for breakfast again. I'm starting to really like hotcakes ;) Walk over to a see if I can find a guitar store that I want to check out on the return trip. Find it and make a mental note of the location. At 10am we depart the hotel for Hiroshima. Today we take the Bullet Train, which averages about 150mph, doesn't seem that fast, but it gets you there in a hurry. On the way we are informed that the show in Hiroshima has been cancelled, due to the singer's fall on the previous night's gig. Great, more days off, more $$ to spend.  Arrive in Hiroshima, it is boiling hot, of course. My bag is already in my room. Now that is service. Head out to shopping district in search of food. Walk around for an hour shopping and still looking for food. It is around 2pm, so some places are already closed for lunch. End up in a conveyor belt sushi place again. This one is a little more low rent and I soon realize, especially by the waitresses uniforms, that we are in the "Waffle House" of sushi restaurants. Food isn't bad, but since it's so late, no new sushi is being added. We just watch the same stuff go around and around. Finally we decide to leave and my bill is under $4. Cool.  Shop some more for gifts, mostly just scope out stores for tomorrow. Find a cool guitar store and spend 45min. looking at guitars, too expensive to buy anything here. Back to the room and a break from the heat. Fall asleep for an hour or so, it's dark when I get up. Not too hungry, so head out to the Lawson's for another Cup O' Noodle dinner (280yen). This one is very spicy, but good. Watch some Japanese baseball on TV. Then due to my nap, I read till about 12am before falling asleep.

      Awake at 5am. Toss and turn till 6. Wait till 8 to venture out to Lawson's (convenience store) for provisions. It's boiling hot already, stop annd get McDonald's hotcakes on the way back to the room. 10am lobby call for gig, get in van, ride 30min. to gig. It's another gigantic baseball dome. They've decided to not turn on the A/C till we get there, I feel like a turtle in a small terrarium, throw in some lettuce please. Set up gear, eat lunch in catering, surf internet, wait for band, etc. Band arrives, no soundcheck, cool. Head to catering for dinner, they are serving tiny little baked potatoes, about the size of a red potatoe. Each in their own aluminum foil. Deliceious.   Show is at 6pm, gets off to a good start. During the last song before the encore, singer falls off stage (which has been raised to 7-8 feet). Security guy breaks his fall and he seems OK. Most of the band didn't even see it happen. Finish show, load out, return to hotel by 9:30pm. Shower and take my luggage downstairs (it goes by truck to the next hotel). In the lobby are numerous Japanese fans and they pounce on certain members of the crew looking for picks, etc. They don't bother me and I head back up to the room and stay up till 11pm.

      Get a call and go to McDonald's around 8am for breakfast, I decide to buck fashion and wear shorts, as it is unbearably hot. Order hotcakes and eat outside next to street café-style. While eating, assorted crew members show up with tales of falling asleep last evening and awaking in the middle of the night. Well, at least I'm not the only one.   Hang out at Mickey D's for awhile. Then venture off with my usual day off partner in crime Jerry. We head for the arcades with Electronics Town (ET) the ultimate destination. This place is like some whacked out SOHO and Canal Street rolled into one. Shops of every description and small restaurants (I use the term loosely, as some are just stands) are every few feet. It is never ending and a little overwhelming. We find one arcade that is all restaurant supply stuff. Some cool pottery and places that sell the fake plastic food that you find outside the restaurants here to advertise what they sell. The plastic food places are bizarre, everything from plastic sushi to plastic beer. We browse and vow to return and buy gifts on the way back.  On our way to ET, we see a music store. As Musos we go in and check out the new and used guitars, even see a few deals, but pass on buying anything. Hit a few storefronts in ET, see some cool digital cameras that probably won't hit the US for a few months. Deals aren't any better than the States (some worse). But, if you want the latest-greatest this is the place. I want a new digital camera, but I've been looking at them for a year now and have still not decided to pull the trigger on one. Check out a cool Hobby store with 5 floors of models and such. Search for a Ducati GP bike model, but no go. They have plenty of Honda ones though, even a Biaggi one. May go back for it.  End up back at the restaurant row and buy a few gifts. It's now time for lunch and we remember passing some good noodle houses in our travels, so we head that way. Now of course we can't find anyplace to eat, there are McDonald's and Wendy's, etc. but we don't want those. After walking around for an hour we finally decide on a conveyor belt sushi place we've passed a dozen times. We go in, it's pretty busy, but we get a seat at the front. These places are great, the sushi comes by on little plates with one or two pieces of sushi on them. You pick what you want and the plates are totaled when you finish. The guy is making sushi right in front of us, so you know it's fresh. Normally sushi is not that great in Japan compared to the US. No California Rolls, etc. just pretty normal nigiri sushi. I must say this was the freshest sushi I have ever had, the tuna had obviously been freshly killed, and seen minimal freezing (if any). The ebi (shrimp) was also outstanding. There were quite a few things we didn't recognize (or eat), so we just let them pass by. We finish and tally up the plates, my total comes to 960yen. I'm stuffed and it's under $10, who says Japan is expensive?  After eating, we realize we have been walking around for 5+ hours. Time to take the purchases back to the room and get a little rest.  Well, after 45 min. of rest I start getting sleepy (it's only 5pm). Not good. I decide to venture back out, Jerry passes, so I'm on my own. I want to check out the Amerika Town (like our china towns), just north of the hotel. Walk through an arcade I have never been through and buy a shirt for myself along the way. Get to Amerika Town and it's a lot of alleys with small vintage clothing, record and shoe stores. There's a bunch of punk rock kids and a few sleazy looking characters around. Feel a little uneasy, but have no problems. Visit a few vintage places, now I know why there's no good vintage in the US anymore, it's all over here!! Some places have 10,000+ items, wow. See a few bargains, but most stuff is overpriced and see nothing I can't live without. Wander back to the arcades and decide to hit the Tower Records near the hotel. Score a Gladhand's Best Of CD in Tower and a Japanese guitar mag. By now it is 7:30pm and I've walked around for almost 8hrs. today. My dogs are barkin'. Go back to the room, email, read and make it to almost 11pm before falling asleep.

      Gee, it's 4am again. Watch some crazy Japanese TV, they have strange shows here and seem to be obsessed with food. Even on the news they show what the people they are reporting on, had for dinner. Weird.  Raining again. Put on the same clothes for the 4th day in a row. Sigh. Go down for 10:45am lobby call for airport, no bag.  Talk to Yoko, she says my bag will be at the check-in counter. Get on bus, ride 30min. to airport.  Arrive at airport. Go to counter with Yoko, and see my bag directly behind the girl checking us in. Ask if I am able to open it before the flight, she says OK and hands me bag. Score!! I immediately get new clothes out and put them in my backpack so I can change ASAP. Reluctantly re-check my bag with ANA Airlines. Hope it makes it to Osaka!!  We are getting a group check-in, so it takes a while. Band and their families arrive (they are on same flight). See my boss and talk motorcycles, etc. until I realize the crew is gone and I'm now hanging with the band and autograph hounds. Walk to the gate with boss and family, he doesn't get hassled too much. Arrive at gate, where there are 100 or so Japanese schoolgirls in uniform, who freak when singer arrives. Try to distance myself from the cacophony.  They board us first, pretty cool, and we (the crew) sit in the upper deck of the 747. BIG plane. I have a window seat, and there is even a compartment under the window that my messenger bag fits in. Cool! Plane is full and Japanese crew member sits next to me (in middle seat). He smells of alcohol and BO. GREAT. I avert my nose and look out the window, we are very high up, compared to the usual jet. On take off, they have a camera mounted on the landing gear, and you can see the runway flying by. VERY COOL. We don't seem to be going very fast, but plane takes off easily. Uneventful flight, do see the strange man-made island airport that is built outside one of the cities (forgot which one). I hear it sinks a few inches every day.  Arrive in Osaka and go to baggage claim. We have our own belt for our group. Watch as regular passengers get their bags and leave. Wait by our special belt, and get our bags slowly come out 10min later. So glad we got the "special" treatment. My bag arrives and I hug it.  Head outside, immediate climate change from Sapporo, HOT and HUMID, did I mention HUMID? It's about 96 degrees and I have jeans on. Find the truck and load in bag, then go to bus. Hotel is 45min away, grrrrrrrr.   Get to the Swisshotel and check in. Hotel is above the Namba station in a very busy part of Osaka. Around the hotel is a ton of arcades (covered shopping streets) and an Electronics Town (which is a street full of big and small shops all selling the same gadgets for about the same prices).  Go out with other backline guys across the street to noodle shop. They have gyozas!! We order some, and I order Ramen too. Gyozas are great and only 190yen. Cheap. Walk around arcades a bit, notice that although it is incredibly hot, no one is wearing shorts, except for kids and old people. How fashionable. We head back to hotel around 6pm, promise to meet others around 8pm for dinner.  Start reading in room and decide to take short nap around 7pm. I awake at 9:30pm and feel like I've been drugged. Go back to sleep and awake at 2:30am. Uh oh. Go back to sleep till 4:30am, then get up to read and check email. Sun is not up yet, it waits till 5am to rise.

      Up at 4am again. Raining and foggy. Check email and read some more, snooze a little. Get invited to McDonald's (The American Embassy) for breakfast, but I pass. 9am lobby call for the gig. Get in vans for the 30min. drive to the gig (see a pattern here?). Gig is a baseball stadium, and HUGE. Production office, dressing rooms, are at one end (home plate side) and stage at the other (outfield), takes at least 5min. to walk from one to the other. Great. At least the catering is pretty good. Inquire with the hotel about my bag around 11am, still not there. Set-up gear and do my gig-thing. Band is supposed to come in at 3pm for soundcheck, doors are at 4:30pm, show at 6pm. Early shows are cool, but why am I so tired? Oh yeah, the 4am thing. Band ops to rehearse in the tuning room not the stage, much running back and forth.   Ask Yoko to check with United on my bag. She finds out it was supposed to be on a 6am flight, but it was cancelled due to fog over Sapporo. They will try to get it on a 7pm flight so it will make it to Sapporo by Sunday morning, just as we are leaving to fly to Osaka. She tells me they are sorry and want to show me "respect" by paying me $$.  Borrow a black shirt for the gig (Thanks Travis!) Gig goes smooth, at least from my end. Band plays 2hrs, since there is no opening act. We finish around 8:30pm. Load out and back to the hotel by 9:30pm. Feels like 2am though. Fall into bed and pray my bag arrives tomorrow.

      Sun rises at 4am and so do I. This is not good, but after all the sleep on the plane what do I expect. Try to read, fall back asleep and wake up around 9am. Go out around 11am with other backline crew who have also been awake for hours. Where we are staying in Sapporo is pretty suburban, we walk around for an hour before heading back to the train station we passed in the first 5min. We find a noodle shop with some nice ladies working, who speak no English. Cool, an adventure! We order Ramen and Soba, but they don't have Gyozas, bummer. It's tasty and we pay our 480yen and go to the 100yen shop next door.   The 100yen ($1 store) has some cool stuff and I buy a phone cord for my powerbook, since I left one of the 500 I have at home. Head back to the room and snooze a little, since it's raining again. United calls, my bag will be in Tokyo today, and should arrive at the hotel in Sapporo by Noon Saturday. End up sleeping into the evening and wrecking my sleep pattern some more, oh well, I'll be up at 4am anyway.

      We arrive in Tokyo, wait in 30-45min. line at Immigration, after 25min. Little Japanese guy comes by calling our names, takes us to the front of the line so we can make our connection. Get through Immigration to baggage claim, I don't see my bag anywhere, not good. Little guy tells me to go to United baggage claim counter, as I watch my fellow crew members claim their bags and walk through Customs. Fill out paperwork at United counter, I'm promised my bag will arrive tomorrow. Another little guy runs me over to Customs officer. They whisk me through and luckily I see my comrades on other side (they lost someone else's bag too, so I don't feel so bad. We board a bus for the 1hr. drive to Tokyo-Haneda Airport for our flight to Sapporo. And I thought Chicago was bad.  Arrive at Haneda and Yoko from Mr. Udo's crew checks us in with Japan Airlines. Mr. Udo is  a famous Japanese promoter. Everyone is very nice and they even give us 1000yen ($10) for being inconvenienced. Wow. We board our flight for Sapporo, it's very empty and the flight is uneventful.  Arrive in Sapporo, it's raining of course, get on a bus for the 45min. ride to the hotel. Isn't anything near by in this country? Get to hotel, it is now almost 11pm. We all spot a 7-11 and after dropping our bags, we head there for a Cup of Noodle and Japanese snacks (gotta spend that 1000yen). Noodles are good. I will now try to read and then sleep.

      Leave RDU for Sapporo, Japan via Chicago and Tokyo. Plane delayed 45min. leaving RDU, partly because Dubya was flying in for a $25K a plate luncheon, hope they all got food poisoning...   Arrive in Chicago with 40min. to connection, take "secret" bus to separate terminal for connection. I say "secret", because I've never seen this bus before, and there was only 3 of us on there. Think everybody else must have walked. Sorry, back to the point, get to the gate for Tokyo flight, plane is out of service, they must get one from Denver. GREAT!! Run into fellow Aero crew members, we're told by United that take off will be delayed at least 3hrs. Our connection in Tokyo is about 3hrs. Looks like a long day just got longer.   Finally we depart Chicago 3.5hrs. late. I get lucky on flight and sit next to an American couple on their way to Singapore. They serve food on the flight every 30min. of the 12hr. flight, or at least it seems that way. I sleep most of the flight, did awake as we were crossing Alaska and was treated to a spectacular view of the snow covered mountains (now I know why I asked for a window seat).
