      I have just had one of the "greatest" days ever. And if you missed the sarcasm in all of this, you my friend should seek mental help.I did not have a good start to my morning. I woke up at 8:42, early for my lazy ass, and turned on my computer. Last night we had a severe thunderstorm and thus I was not able to check my e-mail or anything. Going through my e-mail I see I have tons of reviews for my lemons (Fanfics that have descriptive sex scenes). I shift through, find many compliments, one flame and one that pissed me off even more than the flame. (Although the flame tickled my funnybone more than pissed me off) It was saying that it didn't belong on the site because it was NC-17. On Anime Spiral, you rate lemons like that as R, so I didn't know. Quickly, I went to Fanfiction.net to find that they had disabled my account. Prior to the thunderstorm I had shifted though this one man's profile and saw that some of his stories got pulled for inappropiate content, but they go and disable my  entire  account for inappropiate content! Prior to that I also discovered that this man paid for support services, I did not. Don't you find it funyy that girl just writing fanfics and doesn't pay the damn site gets disabled for inappropiate content, yet this man who pays them does not and only his stories are pulled? Some things just royally piss me off!!!>.  For those of you who don't know if I put * after a smiley it is my vein pop. Anyways, so I just send them an e-mail about it and continue on with my day. I get another chapter up for Love Never Dies and eat some lunch. I get one person still asking me to continue that, another who just simply had their eye twitch-.-; Then I managed to do something I thought impossible (then again she is one of my more frequent readers) I managed to make a "Kikyou-hater" believe that Kikyou was sweet in my lemon. The world is either ending or I am just getting better. My money is on the world is ending, though some would argue that. I added yet another chapter to the still growing and vastly popular, Public School. I don't know what it is about that story, but people just love it. The drama in it is just an exaggeration of teen life, maybe that's why some can relate and like it. It has been proclaimed the best multiple times and I have people who check it hourly to see if their is an update o.O Flattering really, but kinda scary. I just have to keep writing with the flow. I still have two characters to introduce and must get my butt in gear about it. Though they will be making their appearences quite soon, while poor Inu-Yasha will be tormented by Kiba aka Buddha Jr. Buddha is my loveable, yet annoying puppy. Poor Inu-Yasha, I can sympathize with him. Anyways, after I added that chapter I decided to be lazy and do absolutely nothing. Then I went for a walk. So much for doing nothing, eh?  After my walk I came back to reviews and wrote more. Then added that, ate supper, and went on, bored. Finally I added yet another chapter and decided to go for a walk, but ran into the problem of 6 little kids who all adore me and do sometimes call me by the name Kikyou. They scare me...so much that I had to sneak out the backdoor to get in and out unnoticed. Being so bored, I had an hour to burn before the highlight of my day/night. I stupidly went outside. They demanded for my headsets and heard the Japanese, instantly becoming enchanted by it while childishly fighting over the headsets. Not wanting to break them more than they already were, I brought out my boombox and played the music, they boogied like it was 1999.  Then I have a long 1 hr. & 50 min. conversation with my boyfriend and thus concluded my day on a good note. Other than that, nothing has happened. I will be writing a new chapter to The Taiji-Ya Village and then Love Never dies and then Public School and then The Taiji-Ya Village and then...you get the point. So thus concludes my long-ass day, wasn't it just great? Just remember, I'm not a whiner, I just complain a lot ~_^

        urlLink     What is so wrong with her!? I'll never understand it! Kikyou is not a villianous person! How can you say that about someone who is so hurt?   Posted by  urlLink Hello     I just don't get it sometimes, how can you hate someone like Kikyou? How? I just don't get it sometimes! People just don't take the time to understand her. Here are a few good reasons why  not  to hate her:  1) She is a really deep character. Prior to her death, she was forced to surpress her emotions. When she fell in love with Inu-Yasha, well then it all went downhill for protecting the jewel, but uphill for her emotionally.  2) Her reincarnation sucks. Enough said. She can't stand on her own without crying and screaming to Inu-Yasha, while Kikyou can stand on her own.  3) She is just a very hurt person. Wouldn't you act the way she does if your love had appeared to betray you so?  4) Her intentions are good, even if they don't seem it. What seems evil is really not that evil, just because it may have a semi-negative affect on the main character does not mean that it is realy evil! Nobody says Sesshoumaru is evil and I don't see any Sesshoumaru-haters so why the hell should Kikyou ripped at for that?  5) She is a really hurt character therefore "she" is filled with anger and pain, along with sorrow. That "dead, clay bitch" as many have put it is just an image of that, not of Kikyou herself.  Need I list anymore? I hope not because I could go on and on and you don't want that...    urlLink    This was before Kagome, hate to break it to you people!  Posted by  urlLink Hello     And my final rant...at least on the subject of Kikyou. What is so wrong with this picture? I don't see anything wrong with it, do you? I sure as hell don't. As I say in the caption, I hate to break all of your hearts, but those two were in love and together before Kagome! What is so wrong with a fanfics about those two? I actually had one person bitch me out because I wrote a fanfic of Inu/Kik pairing...I just don't get it. Whatever it is, it pisses me off. They told me I was a dumb ass and that I need to "make up for my dumb ass mistake and write a Inu/Kag fanfic" I just have to say one word to that: No. It's not a mistake and I don't have to repent for it. That was the way things were before Kagome, I just don't get why that is such a hard concept to grasp -.-* One last rant and then I'll shut up with my ranting is, I have met my first insane otaku. This person was yelling at me because they didn't like the way the characters interacted. Saying that Inu/Kag was a bad relationship, but you know, I don't see them reading my Inu/Kik fanfic...so what if it is a lemon? That's what they wanted wasn't it? People are so frustrating like that, but that wasn't my point on this one. The point on this one is a few simple words. ANIME CHARACTERS ARE CARTOONS! Some people apparently have a hard time grasping that concept. They may be based off real people, but that doesn't make them real! People piss me off sometimes...

      Anyways, on a better note, I'm extremely happy with my fanfics. Even ones that are a little less popular! I love writing and people seem to really like them so I'll keep them coming. I will have to take the whole day tomorrow more than likely^_^;; Which is going to suck because people will be dying to get more. Speaking of which I have to get writing! Currently I am working on 3 stories:   -Public School (PG) -The Taiji-Ya Village (I think PG...) -Love Never Dies (R [Technically NC-17, but Anime Spiral doesn't go that high])   Look me up on Anime Spiral as  urlLink Kesshou ! I hate Fanfiction.net, so I use Anime Spiral instead. So before I dart off, I'll give the daily quiz result...     Goddess of the Moon. Beauty, yet a sadness lurks about you at times. But hey, pain is beauty, right?    urlLink   What element would you rein over? (For Girls)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Go Me!
