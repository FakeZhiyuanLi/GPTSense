      If there were ever a more foul habit that I have become victim to, it’s the diet habit.  It’s the low-fat, non-fat, no carb, more water, less sugar, pump the iron, sweat to the oldies, loose the cellulite, gain the muscle mass, Southbeach Diet, Atkins Diet, Weight Waters, Jennie Craig craziness that has crept into every pore of my being. Ask me a question about the food pyramid and I will ramble on for hours on the pluses and minuses of following this consumption guide.  Ask me about blood pressure, blood sugar, clotted arteries, cholesterol from red meat, vitamins in fresh vegetables. I could put even Richard Simmons to sleep. If you want to know a weight loss/fitness tidbit, and even if you don't, I have enough useless factoids on this topic to make a grown man cry. And still, with all this knowledge, I steadily maintain being about 10 pounds overweight.  It sucks! And, frankly, it’s not helping my compulsion any.    I don’t believe that I’m anorexic. I eat all the time.  Well, I don’t eat ALL the time, but I do eat through-out the day.  And I’m definitely not Bulimic. I would prefer to run through the mall naked, wearing only pearls and a feather boa, than to throw-up. However, the desire to lose weight exists and, because there is no name for my particular disorder, I have made up my own. It is called Weightloss Compulsion without Leading to Anorexia or Bulimia. WCWOLAB for short.  My compulsion isn’t an entirely bad thing. Sure, I compare myself to those super humans who are really just air-brushed beauties followed wherever they go by hairdressers, make up artists and fashion designers. I look at myself in the mirror and compare myself to the Victoria Secret models. Damned Victoria Secret Models! Who wants to see you in your underwear anyway! I see the ads for weigh loss showing happy, smiling women who probably never had to loose a pound in their lives.  I see through their façade! But I digress.  My habit has led me to work-out often which is good for my insides, even if my outsides don’t really show it.  I am in shape.   I couldn’t go out and run a marathon, but I do have the energy to go to the gym, take the dog for a walk after dinner, and still be witty if the occasion foresees wittiness to be necessary.  However, it’s probably the only good thing about my entire obsession. I can’t even eat without wondering what types of saturated fats I’m ingesting. I worry constantly about my arteries being clogged with fat and about malignancies growing because of the amounts of LDL compared to HDL I have flowing through my blood. If I don’t eat green vegetables, I worry about minerals. If I don’t eat enough meat, I worry about my protein. It’s a circular habit with no end in sight. There is always something I can do more of, or less of, to make my body more healthy. And then there are these last 10 pounds, dammit!  Of course, with all these worries you would think that 10 pounds wouldn’t be an issue.  You might think that I would watch what I eat so carefully it is surprising that I’m not a human machine. However, I have a drawback to my weight loss obsession.  I have an addiction even stronger than my habit.  That would be cake.  Cake is the devil in disguise.  Now, I wouldn’t necessarily sell my soul for cake…but I might think about it. This is part of the proof that I suffer from WCWOLAB.  I might worry compulsively about weight loss and I might obsess about the amounts of preservatives in frosting, but it still doesn’t stop me from having a big piece of carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.  Actually, my cake addiction has even let me to believe some very sad untruths about carrot cake.  I trick myself into believing carrot cake is healthy, but in actuality, although the word carrot is apparent, this is still just cake.  As far as I’m concerned, we have the vegetable group (the carrots) the protein group (nuts), the bread group (flour), the milk group (the cream cheese frosting) and the extra group (uh. The cake.) All in all, carrot cake is a very balanced meal.  Yeah.  I know that I’m just tricking myself and if I really sat down and thought about it, I’m doing my body more harm than good. But, if someone were to offer me a piece of cake or a piece of celery- although my mind would tell me that I don’t need the calories or the fat or the sugar I would still pick the cake.  Because, it’s true that you burn more calories eating celery than you actually ingest from the celery itself, (Jane Fonda, eat your heart out with that bit of food trivia!) but let’s face it- celery isn’t celery without the peanut butter and I have to draw the line somewhere.    I do have a bit of consolation, however, in being a sufferer of WCWOLAB.  Some eating disorders are much worse.  The torment of comparing broiled chicken breasts to a big quarter pounder hamburger with all the trimmings can only make me wish longingly for someone to hurry up and invent food flavored air.  It might be hard, but I can concentrate on work or fun through the calorie counting, carb counting, metabolic rate, fat content bullshit I fill my waking moments with.  If I were anorexic or bulimic there is a chance I might die.  That would be much worse.  I mean, if I were anorexic, I wouldn’t eat cake and if I were bulimic I would just throw cake up so I would probably end up not liking cake. So, even with the extra pounds that seem determined to haunt me until the end of my days, living without cake would be worse than living with Weight loss Compulsion without Leading to Anorexia or Bulimia. I’ve decided to pick my battles wisely on this one.  Give me cake. I’ll deal with the additional baggage!

      I sat down and created this account using the pink sample blog.  I didn't use the pink blog because I'm a "pink girl". I don't have dolls or wear pale, shiny lipgloss or listen to trendy music. I also am not the opposite of a "pink girl" who has dyed black hair and blue eyes with pale white skin and a small dog named Brutus.  If there is any category of "pink girl" that I fit into, it's the category of pink girls who seldom wear or associate with pink, but are strangely drawn to that hue of color for reasons unknown even to them. Possibly I am drawn to that color because it is the first color I was dressed in in order to be differentiated from the boys who, of course, wear blue after their first moments free of the womb. I could say a lot about my life, however why bore anyone?  Suffice it to say, I'm a girl who doesn't have anything pink. I'm a redhead which is why I don't wear pink. I work as an Event Coordinator helping brides who love pink roses. I'm married to a man who loves the color pink. I think I have said the work "pink" enough times to disolve all meaning from those 4 letters. Let's get on with the show- Tonight was our Midsummer celebration.  Midsummer is actually on Sunday, but it being Fathers' Day, I can't be in two frames of mind at once.  I can't honor the man who raised me and celebrate the first day of summer on the same day! It would be hard to be stretched so thin. Plus, Dad wouldn't understand. So, we decided that instead of celebrating on Sunday, we would celebrate today. After all, according to a friend of mine, it's the first day of summer somewhere. Just not here right now.  Why is it called Midsummer when it's the first day of summer and not the middle of summer?  I have a very simple reason for that.  I don't know.  Just 'cause.  However, our evening was very nice.  We got home from work and cooked a great dinner. We decided on an Asian theme.  After our dinner of grilled chicken, sauteed vegetables and rice, we retired to the patio and the fire pit where we finished off our (third bottle of) wine and sat and discussed the mysteries of the universe.  Tonight our universe didn't extend beyond the boundaries of the patio which contained us, but that was enough for a couple of hours of laughter and profound thoughts. I wonder if our voices echoed through our fences and if the delta breeze carried our stories to the neighbors. I'm sure they could hear every word that we said. However, I'm also sure they weren't listening.  And now, after an evening of simplicity, after good food, good wine, and good friends, I sit in front of the computer writing a blog I hope others read and my husband sits in front of the tv watching something or other.  It's funny how technology encapsulates our lives, even when we spend an evening spurning such activities. I also wonder why I am sitting here staring at this bright computer screen when I should be getting ready to call it a day well spent and get ready for the night.  I have to work tomorrow and the clock says it's after midnight. Midnight used to mean nothing to me, but now it's such an important time.  Now yesterday is done and today starts. I better get ready for it.
