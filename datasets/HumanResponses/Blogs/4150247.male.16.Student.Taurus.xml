      Well recently I have been very busy but i manage 2 read the next 2 chapters of the book. The first chapter was Imagination versus visualization. It was pretty insightful and it basiclly said that visualization is imagination. Then he gave an excerise to do which was pretty easy. The next chapter was about mobile body awareness and it contained excerises to concentrate you awareness to one specific part of you body. It was pretty cool. Well dats all i have read. Again if anyone has read this book or knows how 2 perform OBE then please write back i would like 2 hear from you.

      Well to start thingz rollling Hello. I am new to this "Blog thing", but it said we can talk about anything so here I am. Well recently I bought this book from Robert Bruce called  Astral Dynamics: A NEW approach to Out-of-Body experiences.  First of all I always thought there was more 2 life than what we see. I heard 4 a while about astral projection some time ago but b4 it was hard 4 me 2 think that these types of things can happen. However I have read alot of stuff on the Web about astral projection and find it quite intriguing. SO i began my journey tryin 2 find out how to perform an OBE and i ran into  Robert Bruce's book. I read the reviews of some of the people who bought it and they seemed pretty satifisfied wit the book.  SO i bought it.  Well i have read da first section of the book called Elements of Projection. And wat a headache it gave you. DOn't get me wrong it explained it very throughly and i understood it . But wow does it make you askso many questions in ur head. Like especially the Chapter dedeicated to  Mindsplitting.  AGain i understood it but ..O god so many questions! SO i finished the first part and now am about 2 read the second part called New Energy Ways (NEW). I'll keep you posted on dat. ALso if anyone read this book or has actually experienced OBE's and can give me advice i gladly invite you to write.

       Hey again! Well in da last 2days there have been 2 birthdays in my family. The first bday was my grandma which was on wednesday. I felt sorry cause i 4got it was her bday and i didn't have money 2 get her anything. But my mom reminded me b4 she came home from her job so I gave her a hug and a kiss. And signed a card my mom bought her so i was good. Then 2day was my sisters 19th birthday however i was prepared so after i woke up and did my excerise I printed a banner from my computer and a bday card so i was saved again. I would have liked 2 buy them a better gift but i had no money! Anyway now thinkin of it they both didn't give me anything cause they both "didn't have no money". But w/e. Also there was a massive storm on wednesday. It rained alot but i like the rain so it didn't bother me. So dat pretty much what has happened 2 me. TTYL

      Hello to anyone who reads my blog. Well my name is Ray and I am still a little new 2 this blog thing. I am from New York and I am spending my vacation pretty much at home. It kind of sucks, but if life gives you lemons then make lemonade. I am 16 years old and am going to my junior year in high school, La Salle Academy. However, thats going to be in a few weeks. Recently I have been trying to look for a job cause I desperatly need the money. There's alot of stuff that I   want and need but I have no money. And i would ask my parents but they have their own things to pay off so I will feel bad if i take their money. Also, i began jogging every morning cause i gained some pounds during the july so that pissed me off cause i am unemployed and getting fat! Hopefully I lose the weight i gained b4 school starts.  Let me see what else is new..... Oh yea I am planning 2 do a new hair style so if u c me i have a afro growing cause i am growing out my hair. I tried to comb it down but it is pretty much unmanagable without a hair product, which i told myself i wouldn't use until i do a different hair style. Its a persional challenge cause i always wear gel. LOL I will probably post a b4 and after pic of my hair. Well, dats pretty much wats has been happening 2 lately. THis has been a description of many days of my life.
