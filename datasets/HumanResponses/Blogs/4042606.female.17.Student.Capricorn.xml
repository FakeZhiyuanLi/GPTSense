      Well my plane takes off at 9:50 am tomorrow morning, so this will be my last post for a while. I am going to be in the air for 4 hours so I will have time to write some drafts of posts to come. Like I said earlier, Ian is going to take over some posting! Yay! He finally gets responsibility! Anyway, We are heading in early so I must finish packing, and I will see you all in a week!  Kisses for Marty and Ian

      Well I guess Jackie was trying to get in touch with me all of last night. She finally caught me today after work. The South Park Characters, are not going to be up atleast until sunday. For some reason the website will not let me upload the files. I will crack the code and get those pictures up. Anyway, as for Jackie going to Tampa Bay, that is brand new news to me. So I guess it's up to me to update the website at the moment otherwise like Jackie said "Everything will be normal".

      Well I finally got a hold of Ian, and I sent him the pictures. He said he was going to work out the problems while I am gone. If I haven't told you already, I am going with my dad to Tampa Bay, Florida. Finally going on vacation! So, even though I will have my laptop with me, I probably won't be posting much so you'll have to rely on Ian for posts! Anyway he will probably post the south park characters later this weekend. Otherwise, things will be normal!

      I am trying to make south park characters of me and Ian. But, at the moment the website won't let me post the pictures. The pictures will probably be up sometime next week, or whenever I get Ian's attention. He seems to be quite the little party boy, and is never answering his cell phone.

      A freak rainstorm has blanketed Burlington with a layer of water. I myself had arrived just a hour before hand from downtown. I then was about to walk out the door to go skateboarding. All of a sudden it starts raining, this is the second time this has happened to me this week. It is also starting to anger me, Hopefully the ground will dry up so I can go out and do what I originally intended to do.  On another note, I have a cell phone. On my cell phone I get charge a certain amount of money for the amount of minutes I use. Now that you understand this, let me say that I don't want to here about some dork starring at your funbags for fifteen minutes. I don't know how Jackie did it, but she was able to turn that one simple event into an hour long lecture about how I shouldn't stare at her boobs. I not only lost an hour of my life, but, I also lost money. Something I will never be able to get back.   There are somethings in this world you will never get back.

      Weird things occur during rain storms don't they? Here I thought it was supposed to be partly cloudy, when I am outside talking to my mom when she is stepping out the car. Rain starts falling like no tomorrow and it is still perfectly sunny. I was totally soaked and had to change out of the brand new shirt I just bought that day. I didn't even get to show it off to anyone. I guess I will just have to wait until tomorrow to show it off.

      About an hour ago, I got back from my friend Tim's house with a borrowed copy of  The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind  for PC, I know I am a bit late on the morrowind train, but I have realized how good of a game this really is. I asked Ian to post a review of the game and he said he would think about it. I seriously won't be going anywhere for about a month because of this game. My wood elf scout is on her way to fort frostmoth to solve some problems!, if you are unsure what this game is about then  urlLink click here  and go to it's official website. And to tickle your fancy I have posted a picture of morrowind in action. Ian says I post to many pictures but I don't give a shit.

      The Burlington bike path has been my main mode for transportation for the past week. Taking me downtown or into Leady Park. But, there is one problem I do have with the bike path. The bitches that think they are the only one there and take up the whole damn stripe of pavement. I'm talking about the people that jack knife their crappy ass bikes in the middle of the path, then act like you are some kind of burden when you try and get around them. The topper is when they let out a big sigh when you ask them to move over a bit, then they stare at you until you are out of their sight. This just proves my theory that humans are the worst thing to happen to this planet, of course, not including me.

      As I was in EB Games down near my moms house, I noticed a nerdy kid starring at my boobs. I know some people are attracted to big chests (hint, hint) but he didn't need to make it so obvious when he was starring. It was like he has seen them for the first time and I was standing looking at a copy of super monkey ball. I turned to him finally and asked him what the fuck he was looking at, he just said "nothin" and walked away while still starring at my chest. If my boyfriend or Ian were there, they would have probably punched the guy out. I decided to let it go and just went and got an ice cream.  On another note I bought super monkey ball, and I love it! The only thing bad is I feel bad bouncing the monkeys around, it looks like they would die because they were spinning so fast. It is still a fun game though!

      After Ian posted about the old guy, I have decided to share my experience with you all too. After hanging out with Ian downtown (and seeing hitler) I went home to chill. I jumped onto my dad's couch and flipped on my tv when I heard yelling outside. I walk over to see what's going down outside, and I happen to see a shirtless fat guy screaming at his poor wife. He was yelling at her because she never respected him, So I yell down and tell him to shut up, and his wife starts yelling at me for talking shit about him. I thought I was helping to, So I quickly shut the window.

      Today I decided that I would go for a quick skate session down at my favorite spot, also known as hanny's cirb. Well, as I was walking back down the sidewalk, I noticed a old man facing one of the baby tree's that were growing along the sidewalk. Unfortunately I realized what the old man was actually doing. He was urinating all over the tree. I am aware that nature calls, but, there was a bathroom right inside Hannafords, and also not right in the middle of public viewing. Later, it was brought to my attention that this old man should be allowed to piss where he wants because he is old. Yet, I am not allowed to piss in someones closet on account of revenge.   This world is clearly a little off

      Let me tell you what really happened with "Mommy Hitler". We were walking downtown when we saw these dorkish looking girls playing their violins (poorly too). We were walking down Church St. when we see these people, and Jackie turns and says to me "Why don't we just give them a dollar?" At first I thought that, those kids must be pretty poor to be playing a cardboard violin on church street, when while Jackie is tossing the money in, I catch a glimpse of the kids mother. It was like she was Steve Urkel's white cousin.  Jackie tossed the dollar in and started to stand back up when the Hitler lady gave Jackie the look like the money was an insult. It probably didn't help that she was wearing my "I don't drink water, fish fuck in it" t-shirt at the time either. So, Jackie decides to toss in a 10, luckly I was there to stop her and we were able to continue on our way to Pac-Sun.  The mom probably was pulling some hustling gig on her kids... Clearly humanity is in trouble.

      I saw a really sad thing downtown when I was with Ian today. 2 little girls were playing their violins while wearing those little tap shows and standing on white tile. I was happy to see them busy, but then, I look and their mother is standing behind them, judging them. I thought it looked like their mom was forcing them to play for money. I felt bad for them so I tossed a buck into their violin case, then their mom looks at me with those eyes like "I hope you were planning on giving more". I was about to when Ian pulled me away, cause I was planning on giving them more.

      It has been brought to my attention from many people, that skateboarding is no longer a okay thing to do with your free time in Burlington. Everywhere I go now has some kind of sign that says I can't skateboard there. I am sick of this, because when I do complain. They just tell me to go to the local skatepark down at the waterfront. I hate that fucking place, it is filled with assholes that think they are better then you. Well, let me tell you something, I don't give a shit if your better than me, I just want to skateboard in peace. This is nearly impossible now because of those jackasses in suits telling me that I am going to break something if they let me skateboard in their parking lot.

      John Kerry finally has made his decision tonight about his running mate. Luckly, he did not choose Howard Dean, but, instead went with the popular North Carolina senator John Edwards. We can only hope that his attitude of liking everone will not make him weak in points where harsh words are needed. And Edwards is now pitted against the Cyborg Vice President Dick Cheney, They said he would provide a striking contrast to him, though Republicans countered that a debate between the two would be a face-off between sizzle and substance, particularly over the Iraq war, when John Edwards's relative lack of foreign policy experience would be an issue.

      " The National Institute for Media and the Family, a critic of violent games, reports that 79 percent of stores it surveys prohibit selling mature-rated games to kids. Many major chains — including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Best Buy Co. and Electronics Boutique of America Inc. — will have a carding policy in effect by the end of 2004, though the titles are available over the Internet."   This what the article (written by NICK WADHAMS) says about the subject of video game violence and what is being done to prevent young children from playing these games. Let me just say that if a 9 year old child has not seen someone get raped, murdered, fucked, shot, stabed, strangled, pistol whipped, gang banged, or paddled. Then that child parents have not been doing their job. I had seen all of that on television or heard it from music since I was 9 and I turned out only mildly retarded. The kids that do commit crimes and blame it on video games, are not victims, they are stupid and should be ass raped in prison. Otherwise I would like to see a little more of this (picture below) in video games rather then a character shiting flowers and hugging rabbits.

      Okay, here is the deal. I started a WMD Donation account over at Rum and Monkey so if you want to make the Wings of Kakutama stronger, I suggest you donate a weapon or two. You can do so by clicking the freaking awsome button below.  If you do not understand what a WMD Donation Account is, well, I will explain it to you. A WMD Donation Account is a little thing they started up that lets people donate "weapons" to a group the user names. If that group gets enough weapons they could appear on a top 10 list of most dangerous users. So do me a favor and donate to my worthy cause.   urlLink

      Ian wanted me to make another post on his website. So I will, since it is important to him that I do. I am still not clear on what I should put in this post though. Maybe I will put a picture of something I like, or of something I have encountered today. I do not know yet, I will ask Ian what he wants me to do, I don't want to ruin his website with my bad topics (just kidding Ian). I will figure something out though, maybe I will try and talk about what Ian does for me, like&nbsp;Ian was being really nice and said he was going to send me a birthday present,&nbsp;you probably don't know it but it is on&nbsp;monday. Ian, you really don't have to. &nbsp; It is almost 3:00 in the morning, and I&nbsp;have to go to sleep soon, this is the latest I have been up for a very long time, and if I don't get to sleep, I will get into trouble at work tomorrow. I really love my job, so I guess I need to sleep. See you (whoever is reading this) later and maybe I will be able to post tomorrow night.&nbsp;  I think everyone should also visit this  urlLink website , It has some cute things on it that I like.

      Your probably asking yourself why the fuck I am posting on a Saturday. Well because, to me it is still Friday. I haven't slept yet because I have been talking to Michelle all night and I just uploaded my new profile picture because the old one was gay. Anyway, This is the only post I will be making today, Hey wouldn't you know it? Right at the stroke of midnight, but, now I have to catch some z's before I head into work in the morning. That's right, my whole night was ruined and I couldn't go over to Becky's because I probably wouldn't of been to work until 5 at night. &nbsp; I told Michelle to post something tomorrow, I hope she does.

      I have no idea what the hell is going on. First Ian is talking to me, then he isn't, then he is, and now he isn't again. Plus, this Michelle chick is now a member of our website when Ian didn't even ask me if another person can join or not. I thought he was never going to talk to Michelle again either after what she threatened to do. I guess Ian just can never make up his mind. It is always like Ian to flip flop positions faster than the actual situation is made. I don't even understand him anymore, I guess I will just have to have a serious talk with him when I get back on Sunday. &nbsp; One more thing, If anyone gets a hold of Marty at all, tell him to call me. I don't think his cell phone is working everytime I call him the phone goes out.

      Hello, this is my first post on Ian and Jackie's website. My name is Michelle and I am currently in Ohio. Ian wanted me to do a favor for him and post once and a while on this website so he can see what is happening with me. Sometimes it is hard for him&nbsp;to get a hold of me on my phone, so I guess I will do him this favor and post. I can't post a lot because of my living situation with Adam and I am not always near a computer. I am mostly outside most of the day because I got a job working on yards and stuff like that. I hope this makes you feel better Ian. It kind of makes me feel a little better too. &nbsp; I don't really know what else to say, I am not really good at stuff like this. I don't always know what the right thing to say is so I guess I will just end my post now.

      I am going crazy, I just can't find that perfect look for the website. If you haven't realized, the look changes a lot. It's because I need change every day, else I go crazy. Ian on the other hand will leave things alone for ever and that just makes me angry. I also want to know who this&nbsp;new member&nbsp;is, and what is going on with the website. Since Ian is no longer talking to me I am completely in the dark. So if anyone has any information on this subject, please let me know.

      Earlier I was under the impression that I had the day off. Yet, Now I am working 11:30 to 8:00 so I don't know what is going to happen. Someone quit so I guess I have to step up to the plate. Anyway, my plans for tonight have to be put on hold, because, I don't want to be going into work with a major hangover. Then after I leave at eight, I am going to be coming in again at 3, so that gives me no time to sleep. That also gives me a good oportunity to hang out with some friends. Then I'll go home and sleep for the entire Sunday. So I might be taking Sunday off as well as Saturday. It's all cool though because someone else that I won't mention will pick up the slack. Also there could be a brand new member to the Kakutama Sign crew, if she is up to joining.

Oh, I am hoping to get out and see I, Robot. Tonight, with who, I do not know. But, I will see it eventually if I can't today. At the moment I am feeling tired so I am going to sleep for the rest of the day, then go out and party all night. Yep, my life is an odd one.

      Ian's on mute to me again. For some reason he refuses to answer my phone calls, and he won't reply to my emails. I don't know what I did to him but, it can't be as bad as what he did to me. I am not sure what is going to happen to this website. It may just end up splitting into two separate websites. I hope not though, I may not show it but I really do care about Ian.

      I just saw Anchorman staring Will Ferrell, with my dad and I loved almost all of it. It was funny and I laughed&nbsp;out loud, which is something I haven't done since Rat Race. Although at times&nbsp;Anchorman feels like an extended "Saturday Night Live" sketch from the show's treasure chest of Will Ferrell characters, co-writers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay&nbsp;created enough inspired&nbsp;insanity to sail past the&nbsp;stupid stretches and&nbsp;give&nbsp;a welcome splash of funny kickass movie-tude.  &nbsp;  This would be the first  Alright Alright  review. I hope you got something from this short short. I didn't want to blow all my creativity on one review!

      Last night was not good, instead of going to the waterfront and ranting. I decided to play it safe and stay in my house. That wasn't the case because I was on my computer all night IMing people and posting random crap that shouldn't have been posted. Hence that long section about how much I hate people. Right now, I have a horrible headache and I want to sleep. When I was about to go to bed a spider fell off the ceiling and onto my arm. It set me off balance, because, I was freaked out and fell on my bed. Luckly I fell asleep.  Anyway, Jackie was right last night. Part 3 of the story A Figure In October will not be posted because I haven't finished yet. I have to write a couple more pages then I will post it. Right now though, I am not really in the mood to do anything. I really had to force myself to even write this. I just barely woke up too.

      I am about to head out the door and go down to breakfast, I just wanted to leave a message that I hope Ian gets. Stop drinking you crazy redskin. I think everyone in Burlington, and now everyone that can get on the internet, has seen what happens when he drinks. I also want to let everyone know that I am personally feeling a lot better, and as you can see Ian is doing better. When I get back I will deal with the other problems. Anyway I am hungry and I am going to get some breakfast, so catch everyone later.

      I am finally seeing the old happy Ian again. Unfortunately I think he is a little out of it right now, and keeps trying to mess with the website when I am trying to post my messages. I have already tried to post two, but, there was some retard interference. There is something about a drunk American Indian/Irish guy that really brings you into a happy mood.  Ian's greatest math equation ->   Irish blood + American Indian blood = Biggest drunk on earth   I wouldn't doubt that his head is laying on his computer keyboard right now.

      These people I know have been screwing me over my entire life. Now I am about to tell them all off in a horribly written one paragraph of doom. You know who you are you crack whores. It's wonderful news to find out while your dating your second girlfriend; someone mentions to you that they walked in on her getting tea bagged. You suck Kim. Anyway you need to leave me out of every stupid conversation you piggy pig. Next on the list is that fucker Jared, who thought it would be funny to try and blow my toe off with a bottle rocket, instead shooting himself in the stomach and telling me I had to buy him a new shirt. I hate you fucker. Another one is that bitch sister of Koki. She was so ugly, I felt ashamed to look at her, because if I saw a dog that looked like that, I would shoot it because I felt bad for it. I hate you to Koki, but, not as much. On a scale from 1 to 14 your about a 5.  New paragraph of hate, lets continue the list onto all those idiots I go to school with, and the idiots I work with, and the idiots who say "Lets put all the computer keys really close together so it takes Ian five minutes to hit it right without smacking an h or a j or some other gay ass letter. People blow.  Know who I hate the most though? Ronald McDonald, that fink-rat bastard. In every fucking commercial he is passing his rat burgers off on some little kid while he finger pops that fucking purple blob. You never see him eat the burgers himself do you? you know why, because if he did he would probably die. What a fucking stupid red head.  While were on reds, here is another person I hate. Joan you stupid freckly red headed retard, I thought you were just a little off, but I was mistaken. Your a fucking retard and I hate you. No wonder you smoke pot, If I looked like you I would too.  And who can forget Ryan, I don't know why I even bother mentioning him, your a jerk Ryan. If I wanted help changing a tire I would use your face as a tire changing device.  Ray's okay in my book.  Whatever made Georgia think I like her is gotta be a joke, I wouldn't touch that chick with a giant stick with little green stuff poking out the sides. Or Bamboo, because bamboo is fucking awsome.   Gimli rocks.  Vineee is chiller, like a freezer, actually now that I think of it, he may be trying to kill me. I think he is going to hire someone to accidently shoot me in the throat hole.  Jackie is an emotional wreck like the titanic. She needs to shut it and make me a sandwhich or sandwitch, however you spell that fucking word.  I need a nap

      Looks like Jackie beat me to the posting punch. Yes, infact there was some problems with the servers, and hopefully they have been fixed. An hour ago I attempted to post something and the website gave me the run around.  On to more interesting things though. My jacket should be here tomorrow, or Friday, since it is still Wednesday. Anyway that jacket is the coolest fucking thing I have ever seen in my life.  Hopefully no one that talks with my mother is reading this right now, but, I don't really give a shit. I am drunk, and in about five minutes the whole world will know how much drinky drinky Ian took in. That's right, the list of hatred will be posted.

      These couple of days have been a real downer. I have been in fights with two people I care about. I don't want to break up, and I want to keep my friend. The only way I can get through to anyone now is this website; since neither one is talking to me. I am so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I am going to change, I promise you that. I just hope I will have my best friend, and my boyfriend when I get back... I just want everything to go back to happier days.

      Lately I have been having a hard time getting out of a rut of depression. I don't understand it but, it seems as if the whole Michelle threatening to kill herself has brought me down a notch. As soon as I got home from work my mind just sunk a level. The whole day I was in a good mood. I think I will probably go see a movie tonight, something funny, and see if I am able to pull myself out. The only thing I did find amusing today was when I threw have my bagel out the car window and hit a SUV. God damn soccer moms.

              The morning was crisp, as if the storm the day before had never occurred. Yet, there were hints that another was on the way. As the clouds in the distance were forming, not the usual dark gray that a normal heavy thunderstorm would have; the clouds were pure black, as if someone sucked the very light out of them. There was no light no shine, no hope that a normal cloud would bring. The only thing that these clouds brought was an ominous feeling, and a sinking in your stomach. 	As the sun was beginning to be covered by the black sheet of clouds, a police car moved down the empty road towards the beach houses. There were calls the night before of screams coming from Isabel Katertil’s summer home. In the car there was Sheriff Wallace Gleyson, the most honorable man in town some called him. Sheriff Gleyson had always been liked ever since he arrived in the town 6 years ago. He moved up here when his mother became deathly ill, as he was up here he needed a way to pay the bills, so he joined the Sheriff’s department. His mother died 4 months after his arrival, he just never left. 	In the seat next to him was Deputy Mark Carls. Deputy Carls was not only Sheriff Gleyson’s partner but was also his best friend, he was particularly worried, because calls were coming in that there were screams coming from his girlfriends beach house. That is where he wanted to go the night before, but Sheriff Gleyson needed him down at the docks to help tie down boats. Isabel was always worrying that Mark would get hurt; he never thought it would be the other way around. 	“You shouldn’t worry Mark, you know Isabel knows how to take care of herself, she was probably just frightened that the power was out” Sheriff Gleyson said as he turned and looked at Mark. 	“I never thought I would be the one worrying about Isabel… She was always the one telling me to be careful, and now we get a call to her house” replied Mark without even showing a hint of emotion. 	“Mark, she is alright. Trust me” Sheriff finally said after a period of silence. And he then turned into Isabel’s drive way, and parked right beside her station wagon. 	The two officers stepped out of the car only to see no motion in the yard. Not only that, but, there was not a person on the street or any sign of life in the entire neighborhood. 	“It’s nearing noon, and I don’t see anybody Wallace” Mark said with a worried look on his face as he quickly looked around the street. 	“I don’t want to make you worry, but, this whole week has been strange” replied the Sheriff as he walked up the steps of Isabel’s summer home. 	“Isabel! Isabel! Are you in there?” Mark screamed as he banged on the front door. 	Sheriff Gleyson decided to take a look around the back of the home. Wallace slowly walked across the deck and looked down the side of the building, where the deck continued until it reached the back of the house, were it ended in stairs down to the beach. 	The Sheriff slowly made his way across the wooden patio and peeked in the windows as he made his way out back. As he was walking he could here his Deputy Mark screaming out front, still banging on the front door. 	Wallace looking around for any sign of anything found his eyes wondering to the wooden floor as he made his way to the back porch. What he saw, was a dark stain, as if a puddle of some sort had laid stagnant for a extended period of time. 	“Mark! Mark! You might want to come back here and see this!” the Sheriff yelled as he kneeled down to get a better look at the stain. 	“What is it? Did you find Isabel?” Mark frantically yelled as he ran around the house. 	“I couldn’t even break through the front door, it’s like something is leaning up against it!” Mark continued to say as he reached the Sheriff on the back porch. 	Mark looked down at the stain, and kneeled down with the Sheriff, as he looked, he face went pale and he looked at Wallace. 	“That’s blood!” Mark exclaimed as he quickly stood up and looked at the porch door. 	“Hold on Isabel! I’m coming in!” saying that, Mark jumped into the porch door and busted right through. 	Deputy Carls went through the door surprisingly easily, as if the door had been broken down earlier and had been placed back in its original spot. As Mark went through his feet hit something, and he hit the kitchen floor hard. Mark lay on the floor moaning for a brief moment, and then realized where he was again. He put both hands on the floor and propped himself up and looked around the kitchen. He then felt something on his hands, like it was sticky or just had been mopped. He looked down at his hands to find a red fluid all over him. The focus of his eyes then went from his blood soaked hand to the rest of the kitchen floor. 	As Deputy Carls went through the door Sheriff Gleyson quickly moved in after him and got a good look at his surroundings. The first thing that he noticed was the entire kitchen floor was covered in blood. This sparked him to withdraw his gun from its holster. 	“Mark stand up now” Wallace whispered as he pointed his gun towards the hallway. 	“It’s blood Wallace! What’s happening” Mark said in paranoia, usually Mark was very professional about situations. Today though, he was not ready to handle anything. 	“Get a hold of yourself Mark, I’m sure there is a reasonable explanation for this” Wallace explained, but, in his own mind he had no hope that Isabel was still alive. 	The Sheriff and his distraught Deputy slowly made their way down the hallway with their guns drawn; their destination was the front door. To discover why Deputy Carls was unable to break through, and hopefully find Isabel alive. 	They made their way down the hallway, sometimes looking at each other. Sometimes checking doorways to see if there was anything there, but, as they made their way further down the hallway, they knew they were not alone. As the Sheriff was leading he put his hand straight up, signaling that they were to stop. He pointed his handgun at the front door which was not very well lit. The shades were all pulled, and a gloomy yellow light was radiating through the whole house. It began to get darker as the sun was finally blocked out by the looming black clouds. 	Mark looked over Wallace’s shoulder to see what he was pointing his gun at and why they had stopped moving, when he saw a figure standing at the front door. Facing them, the figure did not move. Only standing there looking back at them; Mark couldn’t make out who it was, or if it was male or female. All he knew was the whole situation was scaring him, and he just wanted to find Isabel. 	As they stood there in silence Sheriff Wallace finally spoke up and said “Hey you! Put your hands on your head and identify yourself immediately”. 	The figure made no acknowledgement of hearing the Sheriff and continued to stand there. 	“I am not going to say this again! Put your hands on your head and identify yourself now!” the Sheriff yelled now apparently irritated. 	“Do what the Sheriff says!” Mark then broke his silence and yelled after the Sheriff. 	The figure then made a slight movement, as if it was growing tired and had to shift its wait from standing in the same spot for to long. 	“I will shoot if you do not follow my orders!” the Sheriff finally yells as he stares at the figure with extreme interest. 	Mark then pointed his gun at the figures leg and readied himself to fire upon it. 	Then as the stand off continued, and Marks finger started to press on the trigger, a bolt of lighting hit somewhere close by and in the flash the two police officers closed their eyes from the bright flash, and when they opened them, the figure that had been standing at the front door for five minutes was gone in a flash.

      I don't understand why Jackie continues to try and disect my mind. I am fine, I always have been fine, and she needs to stop trying to make me feel bad about things that don't effect me. Otherwise I would talk to her again; after the whole thing with Michelle, I had to take some time to sort things out, but, I don't need more than a couple of hours to do so. She on the other hand will dwell on things for what seems like an eternity. Yes, I did start writing  A Figure In October  after I got the news, but, it is not a "funnel" of sorrow. Jackie stop trying to figure me out. Unlike what Jackie says, I will continue posting regularly as well as posting the short stories.

      As of right now, I have calmed down from the horrible day of yesterday. I thought I was the only one depressed that day, but, apparently Ian was feeling down as well. I always worried about how he'd handle things, and I still do. For some reason though he is capabable of pulling himself out of a hole of depression with remarkable speed. I think  A Figure In October  is his funnel to get rid of some of that depression. That is why he is still around. I don't think he will actually be posting his thoughts for a while, posting the story everyday is kind of his little vacation, a vacation I think he deserves. I just hope he keeps busy, I know what happens when he sits around and begins to think. Sorry Ian, for sharing a piece of your mind with the world, but, people need to understand. While some fall apart, Ian just shovels it into the back of his mind. I am still sad from yesterday, but, I am learning from Ian, and I to will try and find an outlet for my sorrow. Sorry this post is so depressing, but, it is something I needed to get off my chest before I became even more depressed. I know Ian will probably not talk to me for a while. He has already started to break off communication with me.

      It’s nearing the end of October in this quiet little village on the coast of Maine. As winter rolls in, the storms become harsher and harsher, until the snow storms finally begin. This year though, the storms have seemed to be harsher than usual. People in the town were beginning to worry; yet, the mayor reminds them that they are just storms they should have nothing to worry about. On this night, the storm seems to be the worst than it had been all week. The waves were higher, the winds were stronger, and the moral of the town was fraying. The dangerous waters were sloshing back and forth on the decimated beach side. As the water would back off into the sea, you would be able to see dieing fish lying on the beach. Then the waves would come back in and wash the filth away. As a vicious cycle, the water then leaves filth again. The filth would momentarily go away, but, you could count on its return. Looking up from the beach are several beach houses. Paint worn and shutters flapping, the storm was giving these houses a run for their money. As the large gusts of wind blew in, the shutters would quickly smash into the sides of the houses. The wind would stop and suck back out to sea like a warrior taking in a breath before lunging forward again. Inside the pale green beach house, two women are sitting at a table, lit by only a single candle at the center of the table. The older of the two women is Mrs. Emily Thompson, a 62 year old woman, who’s out look on any situation, is that of utter disgust. While the young woman of 22, Ms. Isabel Katertil, had a lighter look on the world, in which everything had some kind of purpose. “You know Isabel, these storms have been getting worse ever since July” said Mrs. Thompson as she sipped on the freshly brewed tea that was made to calm their nerves. “We all agree that Mrs. Thompson, but, they will get better. You just watch” Isabel replied. “The mayor is just saying that… You haven’t heard what is really happening around here do you?” said Mrs. Thompson, she leaned closer to Isabel, as if someone else was there to here her. “Oh, come on now Emily. You have too much intelligence to be believing in those silly stories. With all those years under your belt, you’d think you would have more sense then that” chuckled Isabel as she poured Mrs. Thompson more tea. 	“You’re too young to understand Isabel, when I was your age I didn’t believe in no stories like these either. I smartened up, and so should you” replied Mrs. Thompson as she leaned back in the chair and drank some of her tea. 	As she sat in the dark, the lights flickered once and then remained dead as if they used up their last breath of air. Mrs. Thompson looked up at the lights in hopes that they would suddenly jump back to life. Isabel looked out the windows and starred at the beach. 	“You’re right about one thing Mrs. Thompson, these storms are getting worse” Isabel said those words and had a look of sorrow on her face, she then looked at Mrs. Thompson for a second then broke eye contact and glanced around the room. 	“I know you’re worried about your boyfriend, Mark, and you probably don’t want to here what I think. Everyone is always telling me I say the wrong things at the wrong time” said Mrs. Thompson as she got up and slowly walked to the door. 	At this time the two women both starred out the window to see that there was a figure on the beach. Out far enough to get hit by debris but close enough to not get dragged out. The figure was of something they had never seen before, it gleamed as a crack of lighting hit the water, and it was just standing still. 	“Now, what does that person think their doing?” Isabel said to herself as she looked out at the figure. 	“I never seen them around before, and why are they standing out in the water like that?” Mrs. Thompson said as she started to open the window. 	“Why are you opening the window?” Isabel seemed scared but, she tried to hide it. 	“Well, I am going to find out what the hell they are doing out there” Mrs. Thompson said as she looked up at Isabel. 	Mrs. Thompson open the window and grabbed onto the scarf that she was wearing, the wind was so bad, that if she didn’t it would have blown away. As she was about to yell something, the figure began to move. Slowly, but, just enough to notice, it was slowly walking up towards the houses. Mrs. Thompson squinted to be able to see it but with her age she couldn’t see much. 	“Isabel, where did they go?” Mrs. Thompson whispered as if someone might over hear. 	“They’re still there, but, they have stopped walking” Isabel said as she was holding her hand over her face so the rain would not hit it. 	“Hey! Hey you out there! You best be getting off that beach, your going to get hurt or worse!” Mrs. Thompson yelled out as she cupped her hands around her mouth. 	Isabel kept her eyes on the figure, the thing gave her the feeling that if she looked away, it would disappear. At that moment the figured turned and ran down the beach, away from Isabel’s beach house. Then it stopped, turned, and looked straight at Isabel. She knew it too, that chilled her to the very bone. A bolt of lighting struck somewhere off in the distances but was enough to light up the figure for someone with good eyes to see. 	“Did you see him Isabel?” asked Mrs. Thompson 	Isabel said nothing; she stood there leaning against the window sill. Looking back at the figure, as if it suddenly intrigued her so much that everything else in her mind had been shut out. 	“Isabel” said Mrs. Thompson as she took Isabel’s hand in hers and began to shake it. 	There was still no answer, and Mrs. Thompson began to get worried. She started shaking Isabel violently, as if to shake someone into consciousness. Yet nothing she did worked. Isabel just stood there immobile starring out the window. 	“Isabel! What is going on? All you alright? Do you need a doctor?” Mrs. Thompson’s questions rang out with no answer. 	Then Mrs. Thompson turned to look out the window, to see what was so interesting, only to see that her view was blocked, by the figure standing only a foot outside the window. Starring back at her, she let out a scream that was silenced by a roll of thunder.

      I just woke up from my nap and hopped on real quick to see how Ian was doing. I noticed he started ranting about how I am always on my laptop during my vacation. It's alright though I can understand why he was angry. I also wanted to thank him for posting all my messages, anyway, I think posting short stories is an awsome idea and I am going to join in when I get back on sunday. Anyway, I need to take a shower because for some reason I smell funny. It is like a mix of sweat and the smell of masturbation. I won't comment on either.

      Well as I was looking at the length of Part 1, of  A Figure In October  I noticed that it is fucking long. When I say long I mean, as long as one of my normal short stories combined with another one of my short stories. So, I have made the decision to split it into four parts. Making this run longer than I originally expected. I will be posting the first part of Part 1 before I go to work tomorrow.

      Get ready everyone,  A Figure In October  is being written as we speak. I have already said that. Jackie and I are beginning a project of short stories that will be posted on our website.  A Figure In October  is my first project, and is different from any other short story I have ever written, that's right, this is the first time I am actually focusing on the details of people rather than the enviroment. We will see how it goes, I may switch back to my regular style afterwards. I think Part 1 of  A Figure In October  might be able to be posted tonight if I can finish it before 10:00 pm, and if the website allows such a giant upload. I actually may end up spliting Part 1 in to, two segments.   We will soon see

      I just thought of the greatest idea on earth. You'll all love me for it too. I am going to start posting my short stories, and I will make Jackie post hers too. I will split the stories up so they last a little while. I got the idea when I was talking about Jackie's bitch of a post. Anyway, I am going to start writing the first set of stories tonight, since I have nothing better to do.

      Jesus Christ, I have never seen anything run so slowly. I finally got Jackie's novel up on the site. Just to tell you that time is wrong, It wasn't posted at 2:30, it was posted about five minutes ago. It took me from 2:30 to post the giant fucker. Thank you Jackie for writing such a short little story. Oh yeah, just to give you a heads up I wrote this at 6:30, that quick server I tell you.

      Dear Marty, I am trying to find a way to say this, without seeming like a mean person. I stay awake at night trying to think ways to bring this subject up, without it seeming scripted. While I got help from friends in writing this, (as you can see it is not really my style of writing) I just couldn't find a way of saying it right.  I have decided that what I am about to tell you, has been needed to be said for a while now. We have know each other for a while and you know I am really close to all my guy friends. You always seemed to show a little bit of jealousy. You also were untrusting when I would hang out with them rather then hanging out with you. I saw the look on your face when I would leave with them. It looked as if you were being shot in the heart. I am so sorry that you feel that way, but this is just a piece of my personality that will never go away. I am a flirt and I will always be that way.  I don't want to here you saying things behind my back also. I know you see me and my friends treating each other like that, but that is because they are just my friends. Not someone I care about dearly. It hurts me when one of your friends reminds me that you said I was a "cock tease". I never would say things like that about you, I don't know why you say them about me.  I hope when I get back from Tampa Bay, we can talk about this more. You haven't been answering my calls, so I thought something might have made you angry. I promise you that I will try and be with you more.   You also need to be more trusting of me, I know you think somethings are happening but they are not. I had never been untrustworthy, you should believe me when I tell you I haven't been sleeping around on you.  I hope Ian posts this since I am having trouble with updating from all the way down here.So I hope you get this before it is to late for us. Ian has been acting weird to me lately so I am not sure this will ever be posted. That is a problem that I will deal with later, this letter is to you. I guess I just need to get it off my chest and out into the open.

      There is no explaining that, she is a dick. I was waiting a hour last night to post something, because she is apparently writing a novel for her next post. It seems that she was logged in for a couple of hours typing the damn thing, locking up updates. Let me say this, It had better be one damn good update for making me wait all night. Also for being on vacation, she sure is posting quite a lot. And no Jackie, I am not going to post your letter.   But I am just ranting

      Tampa Bay is beautiful, and I couldn't be having more fun. I decided to make a post because I just got back from tanning at the beach. After I finish posting this I will probably go and take a nap. Hopefully Ian will be able to post this. For some reason I am only able to type it, then I will sit and rot. Luckly Ian has been doing the uploading for me. I heard about Michelle, I don't know her so I won't make any comments. I know though that Ian and his friends will be able to handle it, their tough.  On a much lighter note, I have heard that the south park characters are causing much more trouble then they are actually worth. So, I am not even going to deal with them anymore and just delete them. I worked hard on those too...

      Sometimes life doesn't go your way, your friends are falling around you and everyone breaks their bonds of friendship to pursue a wild fantasy that is never going to come true. Such things can drive a person mad, yet, I will put them out of my mind. As these events unfold I have a message for Michelle:       "Don't be stupid, you learn from most mistakes. But, that mistake will take your life and damn you to a hell that is of unimaginable irony and torture"   That is all I have to say on the subject and I will say no more about this unexpected turn of events. I will wait for a phone call, but, I have little hope of it.  Goodbye Michelle, we will never speak again.

Anyway, Click below now and take the test sinner.   urlLink     urlLink Are You Damned?    You can laugh at the silly superstitions of the religious, safe in the knowledge that we are only dust and lies. All that will be left of you after you die is a slow decay and some fading memories in the minds of your friends. Hope you're enjoying your life at the moment- there's nothing better to come.

      Your probably wondering "Hey Ian, why didn't you update your website yesterday?". Well, you should get out of my face before I break it. I was busy all night and did not get home until midnight last night, and I wasn't in the position to update the website. I hope Jackie is enjoying her time at Tampa Bay, because when she gets back, she is taking over update duty for a while.  Also, I want to know why I haven't gotten my fucking Mountain Dew hat yet. They shipped it on June 16th and I have yet to see it on my door step. I am getting mad, and when I get mad, I eat ham... Only replace eating ham with throwing things... and mad with pie... Because pie is fucking awsome.

      Sorry for the lack of posts, this entire day has been extremely busy. I barely have time to type this message. This will be the only post for today, Jackie's packing, I'm going to be at the movies, and Michelle has a very long day of work at some park. So I have to go and eat before I head out again. There will be more posts tomorrow hopefully.

      Well,&nbsp;I made my desicion and I am heading out to New Hampshire with my dad. I have realized that there just wasn't enough here to make me want to stay. I am getting a fresh start in New Hampshire. Don't be worried though, I will still be posting on the website, and on a regular basis too. I just won't be able to post for the first couple of days that I am there, because of all the unpacking and such. So I will be out of Vermont by August.

      It's my day off and I am doing nothing except watch old episodes of Walker Texas Ranger while I jam my fat face with pringles. I also will actually go and buy a new video game today, something I haven't done in a very long time. Anyway I am off to watch more Walker Texas Ranger, so leave me alone. I also turned my cell phone off so I can deal with none stop Walker Texas Ranger action.

      Here I am again, posting right on time, or maybe a little late. I am sorry to hear that Jackie must make a decision like that one. Sometimes things work out for the best though, so I am sure whatever choice Jackie makes, it will be a good one. I already knew about Ian's hurt foot, because we talk every night for a while. It seems like it has been bothering him for a while, I suggested that he see a doctor, but I don't think Ian likes doctors very much; as he refused to go no matter what. Anyway I don't have to work tomorrow, so I will sleep in and probably call Ian early, since he doesn't work either. So I guess I will go to bed, and wake up early. Maybe sit on my porch and sip some coffee, and stare at the pond in our backyard. Goodnight everybody, especially you Ian!

      I guess I will not be skateboarding for a while. My left foot was damaged after a incident in which I will take to the grave. There is only one other person that knows of this event and I know she isn't talking. Anyway, because of my foot injury I will be unable to skateboard for a while, which blows ass because now I have no outdoor activity to do.

      I still have not come to a good conclusion; I have reasons to stay in Williston, but, there is also a couple of very good reasons that make me want to leave forever and never come back. That was something Mute and I would always talk about when I spent the night at his house. We would stay up for 1 or 2 hours just talking about what we would do if we just left and never come back. Now I have the chance, but, I am unsure I want to take it.

      This is a record for us, We have had the website up for more then 3 weeks. It seems like it has been longer, but, it hasn't. We have also switched the archiving system from daily archive to a weekly archive. The list of days would become way to long. So anyway, the three week mark has been hit, and that is all I have to say.

      I could have sworn that my week was getting better, then I find out that my Dad is going to be moving to New Hampshire, so I have to make a decision by next Sunday, whether I want to live with him or my mom. I am not sure who I am going to live with. I don't think there is much left for me here, and I don't really want to start over in New Hampshire, so I have some thinking to do, I will post my decision as soon as I think of it.

      It has seemed that I am only posting at midnight everynight. This is because I never have time during the day to get on the computer. I am either working on someone's yard or garden, or Adam is on the computer working on things that I can not understand.&nbsp; So the only time I can post on this site is at midnight. I also talk to Ian on the phone a lot so there isn't much left to post here. I love the South Park drawing Ian did of me, and I am sorry Jackie if me posting on the website is making you angry but Ian made me promise that I would as often as I can spare.

      I have been digging through some old boxes of mine, and I just found my original Gameboy. This thing is so big it makes it look like I am smuggling a brick in my purse. I should start using it just so I can start a new fad. Think of it, everyone throwing their SP's in the garbage, instead, they whip out a 500 pound gray monster.&nbsp;Just to make things clear I am talking about the original Gameboy.

       I don't think Jackie is planning on posting a South Park version of Michelle, so I will do it myself. Now introducing:  South Park Michelle , I guess I have to describe what we did so, She is just wearing her red shirt, and she also has short black hair. I am done&nbsp;talking about&nbsp;this,&nbsp; Jackie should have done this instead of me.

      Well, remember us talking about South Park in Vermont? I finally got the program working, and the pictures are now up and running. If you look below, you'll see  South Park Mute , and in a couple seconds I will have  South Park Jackie  posted too, I have to say I look wicked cute in my pigtails!   Anyway, here is  South Park Mute  (I have gotten into the habit of calling Ian that now too). Wearing his usual dress shirt and I tried giving him his wild messy hair and his cargo pants.      Now here is what everyone wants to see; It's  South Park Jackie ! Look at me with my gorgious black pig tails and my white tank top (which now has bird shit all over it). I am also wearing my jeans.

      I tried going without a hat today, attempting to kick it up a notch. I thought it would be something different, but, I just thought it was stupid so I put my hat back on later. If you were to think I look good without a hat, then I would have to punch you in the mouth. Otherwise, keep up the good work.

      Did you know that having big breasts can sometimes be entertaining? Let me explain, today I was down at the University Mall shopping. I was walking down the food court when I noticed a couple of younger teens starring at my breasts. All of a sudden one of them walked into one of those giant cement columns that they have throughout the mall. Of course I started laughing and kept walking, but it is those little things that make my day.

      I hope Ian had fun at the baseball game he went to tonight. I also have noticed that the nickname I gave him from when I first met him has been reappearing as of late. I have decided I will let everyone know why he is called "Mute". When I first met Ian, we were with five other people, only one, Ian knew. His name was Rich, and he introduced Ian to everybody. We went out and walked around an talked all night, yet, Ian would walk beside us and remain silent, but, It would seem as if he was in the whole conversation. My friend made a comment about something, and I looked in at Ian, and he gave a brief reply about the subject. When Ian spoke everyone remained silent to listen. Ian has always been like this, when he first meets people or is around people he is unsure of, he will remain silent or mute, and take in all the information that he can get about people. Then always at the needed time, he will speak, only for a short time. And when he does, everyone listens. That is where Ian's nickname "Mute" comes from. After that night everyone called him Mute.

      Whomever thought of Baseball as the American pastime should be dragged out into the street, striped of their clothes, and beaten with large pointy sticks. The game was so bad that&nbsp;I actually died a little inside as I was watching it. The only reason I was having fun was because I was hanging out with a friend, otherwise it would have been a total waste of time. Also listening to that dumbass  Tarheel  behind me spouting off about how the  Expo's  were going to win, which they were clearly not going to. It even got to the point where Krystal bet&nbsp;Chad a dollar a run that the Expo's would lose. Chad now owes Krystal a good deal of money.&nbsp;We finally decided to leave at the 9th inning because the game just got unbearably sucky.

      I have been sitting in my house all day doing nothing, while Ian has been hanging out with some girl at a baseball game. I don't know why I wasn't able to go, but, I guess I didn't need to go with him. Anyway, I just finished watching The Fellowship of the Ring, and I need something else to do. I hope Ian gets home soon and starts posting again because this day's posts are all from me and that looks sad.

      I am sitting in my dad's living room right now trying to figure out the new program called Picasa. What it can do is organize photographs and use another program called Hello to upload photos we need to the internet. So that we can then post them here. I am trying to figure it out at the moment, so, when I do there will be a whole bunch of new pictures on the web.

      Well I heard that Ian's hand got mangled in his window this morning.&nbsp;I guess Ian was opening his window again and the top halve slid down fast and whacked into his fingers. He showed me this morning and it looks like the top of his middle finger peeled apart. Anyway, the reason Ian isn't posting this himself is because he was on his way to FYE to buy some music. Plus Ian has that baseball game to go to tonight, so he asked me to post about it for him. If you haven't noticed yet, Ian is talking to me again.

      I am hooked on online shopping. Everyone knows stores are not open at 2 in the morning; so I have been going crazy with my debit card and ordering everything I can find. I found this wicked awsome belly shirt on the  urlLink google store  which has the words "Feeling Lucky" written on the back. I am thinking about buying the beanbag chair also.

      I will be sleeping all day, until five comes around when I need to head down to the Vermont Expos game. I know they will lose but, it is better then getting high or drunk at a friends house... Wait a minute no it isn't, yet I am still going to the baseball game, because I don't want to ditch my friend Krystal. I hope the woman I will not mention updates the website while I am out. Or I hope Michelle will take some time and drop a note or to on the site.

      I want to thank Ian, for wishing me a happy birthday today. As I was talking to him on the phone, he gave me the best present ever. I hope he does not get mad at me for telling everyone what he did for me. It is a long story but, when Ian and I used to date a couple of years ago. The first song that we kissed to was an odd one; the song was called  Push Me, Pull Me  by  Pearl Jam.  As we were talking on the phone I started to hear a song in the background on Ian's end of the line. I asked him what was happening over there and the song got louder and he wished me a happy birthday. I never thought you would remember that, thank you Ian.  &nbsp;  Ian thought I was getting sad again, because I was crying a lot. But, it was because was very romantic and&nbsp;I was just so&nbsp;happy. So Ian doesn't have to worry. After I finished speaking with Ian, Adam also gave me a nice birthday cake and gave me a present. When&nbsp;I opened it up I found a copy of Harvest Moon, for Super Nintendo. I have been looking for a copy of this game forever and now I have it. I think this is one of my best birthdays I have ever had.  &nbsp;  Thank you Ian and Adam.

       The Butterfly Effect, is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has been a while since a movie has made me think as much as this one does.

      I think I have Ian worried, because I have not posted in a little while. I just came home to change my clothes. I had dirt all over them from working hard today. I went out and did some tree planting at this old womans house. She was very nice to me and the other workers. I am now going to go and call&nbsp;Ian and check up with him. I would think Ian would get sick of me by now but, I think he is starting to forgive me.

      I have just heard from my friend Vince has seen Fahrenheit 9/11 and he said that it was a movie that would make me hate everybody. Well, since I already hate everyone I don't think I need to see it. Then he claimed that I would hate everyone more, I was intrigued. So I will probably go and see this movie of hatred. Not anytime this week, because everyone I know is busy and people know how much I hate seeing movies alone.

I also want to know why Ian still isn't talking to me. I have tried calling him like four times today, and everytime I get his answering machine. I know he is working right now but he should still have his cell phone on. I am sick of this shit, I want to know what I did to everyone else that made them hate me.

      As I am still a member of the website, I see what is going to be posted before it actually enters the web. Luckly I was able to catch a certain post before it was going to be loaded onto the site. I knew I should have kept those two apart. I knew exactally what was going to happen, they just thought that I was freaking out like usual.  I have a direct message for Abby,  "Don't you dare think about posting what you just wrote. I know what you are thinking about doing, and your just setting yourself up for falure. I know what is going to happen, your going to scare him, and he will run away from you if you do it. So I suggest you really think about what your going to do, before you go through with it." That is the only thing I will say and I will not go any further into detail, because Abby knows what I am speaking of.

      There will be a few minor delays in updating the website this week. Let me explain the situation for each contributor of this website:  Michelle will be unable to post for quite a while. The computer virus that attacked her house-mate's computer days ago has seemed to do more damage than the originally thought. The entire harddrive is destroyed and it will take time and money to fix the problem. That means, no Michelle for about another week.  Jackie is still not communicating with anyone that is a contributor to the website. The only person that she has talked to since she has left was her mother. We all know, I am not on speaking terms with that woman either.  Spinner (Abby) is on her way back to Pennsylvania tomorrow. That gives her two more days of catching up with old friends. So you can bet she will not be making many (if any) posts tomorrow. I am unaware of how long the car ride back to Pennsylvania is so she may not be posting for a period of time.  Myself, will be leaving at noon tomorrow. I will be heading out to Williston until Wednesday, and I am not going to be wanting to post at all. I need a vacation from this place so I really don't want to be responcible for anything, including the website.  On another note, our other website went under today. I really didn't have the time to take care of two different websites. I am a busy person you know.  Other than the problems above, the website will be going good. Just think of this week as a vacation for all of the contributors on it. I will probably be making a couple more posts tonight, as well as making some more tomorrow before noon, if I have time.

      Guess what, everything went fine. Spinner got out of my house without my mother finding out so I am safe for the time being. It was at around noon before Spinner left, we woke up at around 9 but we sat there talking and waiting for are moment to get out. My mother had to take a nap, so that is when I got Abby out of there.

      Alright, we are about to head off to bed again. I just decided to make a quick post while Mute was in the shower. I know many people sleep in the same bed together. Yet, people find it odd that two good friends sleep in the same bed while nothing happens. We are just friends and Mute and I are just sleeping nothing else. I am saying this to make Jackie stop screaming at me and calling me a whore. She is one to talk in the first place. So we will probably get caught when we wake up in the morning, but, we can always hope that Mute's mom has to go out somewhere so I can get out without anyone seeing.

      Mute and I are in trouble at the moment. We want to spend the night together again, remaining in secrecy from certain people. When it is brought to our attention that Mute's mother is going to have the day off tomorrow, making it almost impossible for us to get up in the morning without bringing unwanted eyes. If there is a way to pull it off I would do it in a heart beat, I am actually screwed at the moment because I am at his house right now. My ride won't be here until around 10 tomorrow. So we are just going to enjoy things while they are good, and worry about that little problem that will occur in the morning.

      Here's the story, I slept over at Mute's last night. I didn't get home until 1 in the afternoon, and now I am at Mute's again. Jackie, apparently called home at like noon. My mother picked up, and I specifically told her if Jackie called, not to tell her that I was with Ian. Guess what? My mom said this "Oh Jackie honey! I'm sorry Abby is with her friend Ian". Thank you mom for fucking up an already fucked up situation. I called her back when I got home and big suprise Jackie is flaming. I got a long lecture on how Ian is a jerk and is just hanging out with me so he can get into my "pants". Let me say Mute is nothing like how Jackie is describing him. Mute, in his entire life has nevered asked for sex, or anything assosiated with it. I know him much better than Jackie ever did. She needs to shut the fuck off. I am nothing like her either, I will not sleep around like Jackie is known for doing. Mute and I are just really good friends. We have been so since we were around 9. So I think I have a better insight on Mute, then my dumbass sister.

      I am not sure if anyone has noticed, but, Michelle hasn't posted in a litte while. That is probably going to stay that way for some time. As I was talking to her on the phone today, She explained to me that Adam's computer got hit with a virus and is going to be down until they can get it to a computer repair store. I hope it get's fixed soon so she can add to the site. So for now it is just going to be Spinner and I. The only reason Spinner has been able to post is because she has hung out at my house for the past day or so. Anyway, I hope Michelle is able to get her computer fixed.

      The goal that day was to get a hold of Spinner without Jackie knowing. Well it worked, very well. Abby and I have hung out for like 6 hours everyday since then. Last night she sleep over (without my mother knowing ofcourse). It seems that we have picked up exactally where we left off when we parted ways about four years ago. Tonight we will probably get together again and possibly sleep over again. To bad she has to go home on Sunday, but, she is now a member of two websites with me so we'll keep in touch.&nbsp;She actually just left my house at about noon, before my mom got home. I don't think it would have looked very good if I were caught sneeking Abby in and out of my house at midnight.

      It's a long story, and I don't really know how to explain myself. I never really got close to anyone since I moved to Pennsylvania. Mute was the last person I was really close and open to. When I woke up this morning I looked beside me in the bed to see Mute sleeping peacefully. I laid there for like an hour just starring at him sleep. I don't know what the feeling was, but, it was a good one. It was like all my problems just sort of drifted off into the night. I know we are just really good friends, but, it is nice to know that there is someone out there in the world that cares about me. This is the first morning in a long time I haven't woke up either pissed off or depressed. It is something I could get used to.

      Mute just made a comment to me as we sat here that pissed me off. Let me clarify on the subject. When any of us mentions the "Emmon's Curse" we are talking about large breasts. Jackie has&nbsp;them (everyone already knows that). I wear baggy clothing so that I don't draw attention to myself, unlike my sister whom barely wears anything. Now I usually will always wear cargo pants and a hoodie. When I am with close friends I'll just wear the t-shirt under my hoodie. So they know my "endowments". If I ever hear Mute say my breasts look a lot like my sisters again, I will kill him. Plain and Simple, they are no where near as big as Jackie's so shut up.

      I would like to make a comment on how lady like Spinner is being at the moment. She is really classing things up by shoving as many Oreo's as humanly possible in her mouth. Trust me they didn't stay in there for long. She was in the bathroom 30 seconds later throwing them all up in the toilet. Just wanted to let everyone know that the serious Republican just made a complete ass out of herself, leaving a stain of spit up oreos on my floor.

      Yo everyone, this is my first post and I'm here to say that green is the new color of the website. Jackie picked that lame blue template, but, she isn't here to force it on anymore so I am making it green. If you ever would of thought that the little teen princess would throw the biggest fit on earth, well you&nbsp;missed it. I was there when she flipped out, it was totally awsome. She finally realized that I wasn't some little girl and I could take care of myself. She was just pissed that she could never have Mute. She thought I was trying to steal him away from her or something, even though we are just really good friends. That's why she got all pissed and left early, because she couldn't pressure Mute into things like she can with most people. And another thing, Mute was wondering if I still went by the nickname "Spinner". I hadn't been called that since I left for Pennsylvania. I am getting used to it again, as Ian is probably to me calling him "Mute" all the time.

      I find it sad that Jackie left on such a bad note. I hope she did not do anything she would regret, I also wish her luck in New Hampshire. I know I also left without really letting anyone know. I have realized though that you must make up with the people that you hurt. So I hope Jackie stays in contact with Ian and her sister before it is to late.&nbsp;I guess I will have to start posting more and more on this website now. It is just going to be Ian and I for a while until Abby gets the chance to start posting.

      I was seeing how popular each person was on Kakutama and the results are not very suprising:    Jackie Sign  Mute Kakutama  Michelle  Spinner Abby   As usual Jackie Sign is the most popular person on the website, probably because she tries and sucks all attention from everyone else on earth and pins it to herself. I was astounded that I actually beat Michelle for second place. I usually don't do well in popularity contests. I guess it has to do with Michelle never posting on the sight anyway. The only reason Spinner is in last place is that she hasn't made one post yet so at least I have bragging rights.

      Well, as Abby and I were talking more and more today; we decided we should have our own section dedicated to us. So Abby and I introduce  urlLink A Butterfly Effect , a website that is for our combined thoughts of the world. It is more seriously oriented than Kakutama, yet humorous in it's own way.

      Well when I got back from hanging out with Abby, I hopped on my laptop to see if Jackie posted anything new. I found that Jackie actually left, so I am not sure if she is ever going to post on the website again or what is going on. Abby will start posting as soon as she get's back to Pennsylvania, which will actually be next Wednesday. She didn't want to leave right when Jackie left, because she still had things to talk to me about. So I will say to Jackie, that she completely over reacted, and we could of hung out one last time before she left. But, being the little drama queen that she is, she left with a big fight. Abby says she has been that way her whole life, an I didn't see it until now. Anyway, with the loss of one member, we gain a new one. And another new one might be coming around, Michelle dropped a little hint that a friend of mine, Sarah, was asking to join the website. She is heading off to college soon and she doesn't want to be left in the dark. I am thinking about it, but, there seems to be a lot of women on this website these days.

      Well, looks like I'm leaving in 10 minutes. Ian and Abby have decided to hang out with each other instead of seeing me before I leave. I don't know why they feel that getting pretzels at the U-mall is better than seeing me for one last time, but, I guess their priorities are all fucked up, so see everyone later. I might post once I get settled in New Hampshire, but if Ian keeps being an ass, then this will probably be my last post.

        I just got a copy of the new Nintendo Power, and I read the article on Pikmin 2. I can not wait until the game is released. The graphics look absolutely beautiful, and they are the best water effects that I have ever seen. The Pikimin also have their same cuteness, adorable looks as they did from the first game. Now there are two new species of Pikimin joining the crowd, a white and purple breed. They are always so happy go lucky and skipping behind Olimar, then when they face a foe, they turn into these dangerous monsters that behead the enemy. It is very disturbing, but that is what gives the game it's unique charm.

      Well, I didn't get home until 4:00 in the morning. Abby and I were out walking around Williston. You may be wondering how the hell I got down to Williston without a car. Well, I would just like to thank a friend of mine for giving me a lift down there when I really needed it. I met Abby near Best Buy at around Midnight, and we walked around down there talking until I had to leave at around 3:30, It was good to see her again, she has changed a lot. Not only physically but also mentally. She said I have changed a lot too, but I don't really see it. Anyway, I am finally taller than her. When we were friends a while ago she had about an inch on me and she would always bring it up. Now I am much taller so, I guess I win in that aspect. Luckily Abby did not inherit any of Jackie's bad personality traits, instead she has whole other set of them. One thing I did notice though is she dresses a little more modest then her big sister. Last night she wore and Independent sweatshirt and some baggy cargo pants. Something Jackie wouldn't be caught dead wearing. The reason she says is she doesn't need to flaunt the Emmon's family curse to get what she wants. She is right too, Abby is a very opinionated person, who sounds sort of like a feminist.  On another note, Jackie says she is leaving early so she will never see me again. This in turn would force Abby back to Pennsylvania. Good thing that is not the case, because I am still going to spend time with Abby next week, because she is going to stay for another week. She will end up getting a ride back to Pennsylvania from her cousin who just got up here. So I guess Jackie's little plan isn't going to work and she is just going to deal with the fact that Abby and I are good friends again.

      I was going to stay until Monday, because Ian was going to come down and wish me goodbye. Well, I really don't ever want to see Ian again. So by Wednesday I will be in New Hampshire, also because I am leaving early; Abby will no longer have a reason to be here and she will go back to Pennsylvania. So it's a lose-lose situation for Ian. All because he kept ditching me for a stupid rich college bitch and a retarded red headed idiot. If he ever wants to apologize to me, he knows to leave my sister alone, an he shouldn't hang out with those two Burlington sluts anymore. Then maybe I will talk to him again. What pisses me off even more is that Michelle girl is actually encouraging Abby to hang out with Ian. I never liked Michelle and now she just game me more of a reason to hate her guts. If she thinks she still has a say in what happens in Vermont, while she is sitting comfortably in Ohio, well, she has another thing coming. So anyway, I probably will never be posting on this crappy website again, unless I want to check up on what that idiot Ian is doing.

      I feel really bad for Ian, he is the only male on the website. I also just found out that Abby is joining the website, and that Sarah girl also wants to join. So that means there will be 4 women on the website and only 1 man. I really do feel bad about this, because, it was Ian's idea to make this thing, and now he is being pushed down by all the women. I really like Abby though, so I do think she really should join.

      Well, Looks like I am sneaking out of my house tonight. I have to see Abby again, it is driving me crazy. So I am leaving now and meeting her at a certain location so we can chill. I am not saying where I will be because we don't need Jackie getting on our asses and making us split up. I keep reminding Jackie that Spinner and I were just friends and always will be friends no matter how much meddling Jackie tries.

      As Jackie is still pissed, as if you couldn't tell. Abby though called me when I got home from work. The plan worked and she got my cell phone number. So, we have been talking about the good old days and talking about what has happen since we all split. Let me tell you, she has defiantly grown up. Jackie doesn't know this, but, Abby and I are meeting at the mall tomorrow before I have to head down to work. Jackie has no chance in stopping us from getting together now, so she is just going to have to live with it. I also am getting pissed at her, if she calls any of my Burlington friends sluts one more time, I am going to lose it. She also has no right to keep Spinner and I apart since Spinner is the one who introduced Jackie and I. Spinner was one of my closest friends since I moved from Jonesville to Williston. So Jackie can just shut it.

      Abby is not going to join the website, I can see personally to that. I am sick of Ian thinking he is completely running the show. Why doesn't he just get one of his whores to join the website, and not my sister. I know exactally what is going to happen and he is just going to end up hurting her. Abby may have known Ian longer than I did, but, I still know more about him. Abby is just being stupid when she says she wants to hang out with Ian again. I would have posted this earlier, but, somehow Abby got Ian's phone number and hasn't gotten off the phone since 4 in the afternoon. I want Abby to stop calling Ian, and I want Michelle to butt out of everything, she has no right talking about us when she is way out in Ohio, and has no idea about what is really going on.

      Well, I am still talking to her, I just need to explain what is going on real quick. Abby is going to join in on the website. She just won't be able to post until next tuesday, when she goes back to Pennsylvania. Her profile is already up, and you can finally see a picture of her. She sure has changed after four years.

      Jackie thought she could out smart me, by staying on the internet all the time and not answering her cell phone. But, Mute & Spinner have once again joined forces. That's right, I hate to break Jackie's bubble; I have gotten in contact with Spinner thanks to a good friend which will remain secret. I also think Jackie needs to really think, Spinner and I have been friends much longer than Jackie and I. Yet, Jackie is actually trying to tell Spinner and I that we are not allowed to talk to each other. No one takes on us and wins. We just proved that, and it wasn't even that hard to do. So if Jackie wants to apologize then I am waiting, otherwise I don't want to talk to her. Anyway, I have to go and talk to Spinner about things, and hopefully she will join us with this website.

      I have just gotten back from doing some things, I will probably start cleaning soon. I haven't done that in a while. I heard that Abby was asking about me also, along with Ian. I don't think she knows I did a little soul searching for a while, and ended up living in Ohio. I think she knows now though, I can not stand that I won't be able to see her again. The last time I saw her, she was so small and adorable. I hope Ian gets to see her!

      Isn't it weird that I am posting at this time? I think so, If you have not heard, I have the day off today. I am sitting here in my pajama's sipping my coffee, and looking out at the front yard. It is a nice day, I hope Ian got in contact with Abby last night. I would really like to see those to reunited. I now need to go take a shower and I will probably go to the store to pick up a couple things, so I will post when I get back.

      Well everybody, I am getting back to posting only at midnight. I have heard some people call me weird because of my late night posting. I am sorry, if I could I would post during the day, but I am just not home enough to do so. I was luckly home early today, so I was able to post more. Today (July 26th, 2004) is my day of relaxation. As a birthday present, Adam said he would work in my place, any day of my choosing. So I chose today, when I wake up later I will post on this website all day. I will also try and figure out what is going on with Abby, Jackie, and Ian. Ian also said to be prepared to have another member to the website. I think he is going to try and get Abby to join in on the fun! I can not wait to see a picture of how much Abby has grown. She is the same age as Ian so I want to see if she is still a perky happy girl like she used to be when I was around. She was so cute when I first met her, so let's see how much she has changed.

      I don't know why it is such a big deal that Abby is home for the week. She is only my half sister so it isn't like we are extremely related.&nbsp; And I am not sure I want&nbsp;Mute talking to my half sister anyway, I can't really trust him anymore with other girls because he is always sleeping around with random girls in Burlington. So if he really wants to get in touch with an old friend, he can just visit "Sarah" and have sex all night with her. It doesn't matter if Abby wants to see Mute, I say he is an asshole and he'll only hurt her if she gets near him.

      Alright, it has now hit the one hour mark of me trying to get through to Jackie's mom's house. Apparently they have taken a brake from packing and gotten on the internet. Thank you Dial up for that, and Jackie is mad at me for some reason and is not answering her cell phone. I would like to say that I would really like to talk to Spinner, so I know Jackie may be mad, but that is no reason to keep old friends away from each other. Once again, narrowband has caused anguish in the world.

      I just got off the phone with Ian, and he told me all about how Abby is going back to Vermont for a week. You wouldn't believe how excited Ian is, it's to bad that I won't be able to see her though, maybe they will take pictures to send me. I really would like to see her again. She was actually one of the people whom introduced Ian and I. After we were done hanging out with Ian and Rich that night we all went back to Rich's house. Abby was there and that is where we saw Ian really talk. That is how I kind of got a little crush on Ian. So in a way Abby caused Ian and I to start dating. She was happy about it too, when she found out we started dating. She was also really upset when she found out we were breaking up before we all went our separate ways. Ian asked me to explain why Abby is called "Spinner", I usually don't call anyone by their nickname when I write, because it is confusing for people sometimes. I do though call people their nicknames when I am talking to them though. I just wanted to clear that up, so people didn't think I was weird or something. The story of "Spinner" is very cute, and I think everyone will like it. I was not there when she was first being called "Spinner". I guess there was just one event that gave her the nickname "Spinner". The reason though that she has that nickname is because her mood would reverse really fast without anyone knowing. It is hard to explain, like we could be having the worst day on earth and all of us in a really sad mood, including Abby. Abby, would all of a sudden become extremely happy, like her mood would just spin around. She would then cheer everyone up. That is the easiest way of explaining why Abby was called "Spinner".

      Well, I guess Jackie wasn't going to tell me, but, Spinner is in town. Michelle knows whom I am talking about. My old friend Spinner, her real name is Abby Emmons, and she is Jackie's half sister. Spinner as we used to call her used to be extremely good friends when we were younger. Until I had to move to Burlington, that is when Michelle and I broke up. Abby and I were both pretty down, so instead of sitting in Williston without me, she told her mom she wanted to live with her dad. Did I mention he lives in Pennsylvannia? Well he does, so I went to Burlington and Abby went to Pennsylvannia, all in the same month. Before this time I had started to become friends with Abby's older sister Jackie, who's dad lived in Burlington. Jackie would switch every week, from her father's to her mother's house. So when Spinner went to Pennsylvannia, Jackie became my new Spinner. Anyway, I was forced to Burlington, and I lost contact with Michelle and Spinner. But, Michelle and I started talking again, after certain events occured. Spinner on the other hand seemed as to disappear completely.  Now that you know the background story, here is the deal now. Spinner, is coming up to visit her mom, and to help her sister, Jackie pack. I got word that Spinner was asking about me and Michelle. This is where we are now, so when I go down there to visit Jackie one last time (if she lets me). Spinner and I will be united once again, and we will be back to our old games in no time. That's my plan anyway. I hope Spinner's has the same idea.  Anyway, I need to let Michelle know about this little blast from our past. I am not sure if Spinner is the same as she used to be since we haven't talked for about 4 years. Also if you want to know how Abby, came to be called "Spinner" you should ask Michelle, because, I don't feel like typing anymore.  Just another thing on my mind...

      Hello everyone, I hope I did not worry anyone by not writing anything for a couple of days. I had a big project at work that had taken up all my time. We were working at this park, and we were planting all sorts of trees. It was a lot of fun, I can not believe I get paid to do something I love so much. I also started a garden at home, I know it is late in the year, but, I think of it as starting early for next year. I also heard about the situation with Ian and Sarah. Ian told me all about it today, since we did not talk last night. We usually will talk on the phone every night for an hour, Ian was at the movies with his friend Georgia, while I was at a plant warehouse until midnight trying to get the right kind of tree for the park. So we didn't have a chance to talk at all. I think it's cute that Ian talks to me every day, even though I am way out in Ohio. I really appreciate it, and I love every minute he talks to me.

      You know what I don't understand about Mute, how he always hangs out with other girls, yet he can't make the time to hang out with me. I know he is coming to spend a weekend with me but that isn't enough. This is one of the reasons that I am not staying in Vermont, none of the people I care about spend any time with me at all. First he ditches me to hang out with that red head, now he is hanging out with that rich college girl, and he might be dating her? I don't understand, I always thought old friends were more important then some Burlington sluts. He never would go see movies 2 days a week with me, or spend an entire day at my house watching a movie I wanted to watch, like when I invited Mute to come and watch 28 Days Later over at my dads house, Mute just says he had already made plans to hang out with the red head. Well, don't even bother coming down to say goodbye Mute, just stay up in Burlington with all your slutty bitches.

      I don't know why, but, all I have been smelling today is Georgia's hair. I am unsure of what shampoo she uses, the smell is driving me insane, I think I am going to go and try and cut off my nose if it doesn't go away soon, it probably doesn't help that I am still wearing the same clothes from yesterday either.That&nbsp;still doesn't say much for Georgia though, if the smell is that&nbsp;strong&nbsp;that it can become intertwined with the fibers of my shirt, says that you could definitely smell her from a mile away. I can only say this: Georgia stop smelling so much, it's not that it is a bad smell, it's just that after smelling it for 12 hours straight you start to go a little crazy.

      I am at a emotional crossroad at the moment. A friend of mine, that I only thought of as so; asked me if it was possible for us to start dating. Everyone may think "Go for it" but there are unseen conditions that could make things harder. I have been thinking about this for about two days now, and I still have not come up with a conclusion. Everytime I run the&nbsp;situation through my head, it would always lead be back to where I started. So, I am still unsure if I want to date this person or just stay friends. I think I need a lot more time to run this through my head. I hope she is not expecting an answer anytime soon.

      I have been sleeping since I got home at 10:30 AM. The night before I was out with my friend Georgia watching  The Bourne Supremacy . Which happens to be a very good movie, even if neither of us has seen  The Bourne Identity . Anyway, I didn't sleep at all because I got home at midnight, and I had things on my mind. I went over to Sarah's at about 12:40 and stayed there until 2, then snuck back into my house at around 2:30, I then proceeded to go to work at that exact time. So that didn't leave me much time to sleep, as you can clearly tell. I was about to pass out at work, so I decided to leave&nbsp;a half hour early and get some sleep. I am glad I did, no one realizes how no sleep can drive someone crazy.

      I have realized that packing is not as fun as everybody makes it out to be. Because I am moving, I also have to get everything I have at my moms house also, which is quite a lot since I spent more time there. Anyway, I have to get all of my stuff on to a sort of cargo truck type car. This is taking me forever and I am going to still be packing well through the week. I leave next Monday, Ian said he was going to come down on Sunday and see me so I hope he does. Now I have to continue packing, away I go.

      There is going to be no more posts for a while. Some issues between all of us need to be resolved. As they are not going to be concluded anytime soon, we have decided it would be best if we didn't post about anything until we stop arguing. So for a while, there will be like a forced vacation for all of us.

      What I known for, and as my nickname states: I am a big believer in Astrology. It is always true, I even got Ian in the habit of reading his horoscope all day. And I was interested in what the stars say about Ian's little problem. I discovered that I now (in very rare events) agree with my sister. Here is what the stars say:  "The merging of Libra and Sagittarius can be paradise found for both Signs; this combination is a harmonious one, to say the least. Signs that are two positions apart in the Zodiac tend to have a very deep, special connection and understanding of one another. Sagittarius, the journeyer, is constantly in search of wisdom. Libra has a mind keen for art, beauty and aesthetics; Libra makes a stimulating companion for Sagittarius on their travels and adds much to Sagittarius's experience. The relationship always feels new because these two keep it exciting--and yet their natural understanding of one another makes them feel like intimates from the beginning. Together they will reach new horizons in love and in life. Libra and Sagittarius make great friends as well as lovers. They share a certain fresh-faced optimism in the world; they're both enthusiastic about finding truth and beauty in their experiences. Problems rarely occur. Occasionally Sagittarius may hurt sensitive Libra's feelings by speaking without thinking; conversely, Libra can sometimes be a bit too emotionally controlling for Sagittarius. Since Libra is a born diplomat who abhors conflict, they'll be able to smooth over any ruffled feathers. These two have the gift of forgiving and forgetting quickly. Libra is ruled by Venus (Love) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Luck and Philosophy). Venus's femininity and Jupiter's masculinity make these Signs compatible and balanced. Sagittarius is constantly on a quest for knowledge of the big things--the truth, the meaning of life and death--and whenever Libra comes up with a new idea (as they are wont to do) Sagittarius is eager to go along with their partner and become familiar with this new concept. Libra is an Air Sign and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. This partnership is full of kinetic energy. As air spreads fire and makes it grow exponentially, this relationship is heated and arduous. Sagittarius thinks they're steering the rudder, but Libra controls the flow of events with a quieter hand. These two are energetic in the extreme and can run together far and wide. The relationship runs most smoothly when Sagittarius can feel they have plenty of freedom and independence within the relationship.Libra is a Cardinal Sign and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Libra is an initiator; they think up new ideas and new places to go--but can change their minds at a moment's notice. Sagittarius is flexible and adaptable, amenable to any changes Libra wants to make in plans.What's the best aspect of the Libra-Sagittarius relationship? Their mutual interest in cultivating knowledge and utilizing intellect. They are well-matched and will go far together, both emotionally and geographically!" So as you can see, they are definately compatable, and I think Ian should go for it now.

      It looks like Ian was even more upset than I originally thought. After talking for a while with him, he decided he needed a little break from the website. So he can clear his thoughts. So he asked me to take over, and handle everything on the website. I will just say this:  "There is no room for two Emmons by Ian's side, and it looks like once again, I win Ian's trust and not anybody else". I also can't thank Ian enough for forgiving me for what I did. I think he has realized that I am right in a couple of ways. It may have been better if Ian and Abby never did get back together.

      Where the hell is my cell phone? I just noticed it was not in any of my bags, or any other box that I had packed. Usually I make sure I have it before I go anywhere but I thought I just tossed it into a box. Now I found out that my sister has it in Pennsylvania, and if she does not send it to me I will have her beheaded.

      I would have thought that I would be pissed at Ian even more. But, I can't help but agree with Ian. Nobody, not even me, has the right to force him to date anybody. I have realized that I was wrong and now I see that Abby and Michelle are also wrong. That is why he isn't talking to those two. Because they are trying to make decisions for him. That would piss me off too. So I am going to call him right now and see what the hell is going on.

      Mute is getting very defensive on the subject of not dating the "red head". I guess Abby really made him mad when she kept telling him to ask her out on a date. Then when Mute sent me the copy of the conversation, I agreed with Abby. That made Mute even more angry. I think he is just acting like he doesn't want her, because, he is afraid if he asks that she will turn him down. That is just my opinion, I know Mute doesn't want to hear it either. I think he has asked four other people about it, and they all agree with Abby and I. I would like to ask Ian if we could post Abby's conversation on the website, just to see what everyone else thinks. Unfortunately I know the answer, he is going to say no. He isn't talking to either of use since the whole conversation has happen. But, I just think he is embarrassed.

      Well, Abby has gone back to Pennyslvania. I am not sure what is to come of our relationship. I think we will continue to be friends, maybe trying something else. Abby seems to have gotten the idea that Georgia and I are dating which we are NOT. So if anyone else there is thinking the same thing, well there is your answer.

      Looks like I am about to spend my last night in Vermont. I am about to head home from Mute's house at around 3:00. Luckly my friend, Tom has been my ride around town all week. My last night here will be with Mute, and this is also the last time I will see him for a long time, so I am going to make it the best night of both our lives.

      That last post was the only time this week I have heard from Jackie. I am unsure if she is going to start posting, or she is still pissed that she can't have Mute. She knows what is now going on between Mute and I, and I am sure that has made her even more angry. Not just that I have made the offer, but, that Mute is actually considering it. I guess she is just mad that Mute and I are connecting better than she ever did.

      You would think being caught walking around on the waterfront by a down pour would piss someone off, yet, it didn't. Abby and I were hanging out downtown when it started down pouring. Then it started thundering and lightning's. We just didn't care, it is our last day together for a while, and no rain was going to put a damper on our party. She bought me a new CD, while I bought her a CD player.  I am unsure what are relationship is at the moment. We had a very long talk this past week, about our current "situation". I am still not sure where we both stand. Well, that isn't completely true. I know where Spinner stands, yet, I am unsure where I stand. Anyway, we might be spending tonight together. Tomorrow morning she will be getting on a bus and going back to Pennsylvania.

      Guess what everyone? I am still in Vermont. Sunday was going to be my last day here, and that was going to be the last time Mute and I were going to see each other. Things change though, and I remain in Vermont with Mute. I have actually no idea when I will go back home, I will probably leave tomorrow or Thursday sometime. I have to ride one of those Greyhound buses so I have to figure it out soon. Anyway, I am spending the day again with Mute, we are probably going to head downtown later if it doesn't rain again.  As for Jackie's suprise threat to me. I have decided not to post what I was going to post. Instead I printed it out and gave it to Mute when I saw him again. That is one of the main reasons I am still in Vermont. We still have a lot of things to discuss.

      Well I am back, after being offline for a couple of days. Ian let everyone know what was going on, so no one was really worried when I didn't post for a while. The virus Adam's computer had was not as bad as we originally expected. It was actually a quick fix, it would have been fixed faster if I had Ian around. I hope Ian and Abby had fun together yesterday, their final day together was probably very emotional. Anyway, I am back and I will get back to posting every night.

      If you haven't noticed, we are not posting on the website very often anymore. Maybe because of a lack of interest. Or maybe because we haven't talked to each other in over a week. All I know is the website is on it's last life. It won't be around for very much longer, yet I do want to create a new website. I will be in talks with some other people to create a more goal oriented website that actually has a purpose.

      This is the greatest joke I have ever heard in my life. Read it and enjoy:  There once was a bear and a rabbit that hated each other. One day, they found a genie in a lamp who said he would grant them each three wishes.The bear went first and he said,"I wish to be the only male bear in this forrest." And he got his wish.  The rabbit said, "I want a motercycle helmet." And he got his wish.  The bear went up and said, "I wish to be the only male bear in the United States, and all the rest to be female." And he got his wish.  The rabbit said, "I wish I had a motorcycle to go with that helmet." And he got his wish.  The bear said, "I wish I was the only male bear in the world, and all the rest were females." And he got his wish.  It was the rabbit's turn, and he said, "I wish that bear was gay."

      I got home from the hospital yesterday, and I am fine. Thanks to everyone that called to see how I was doing. It was even more suprising to hear that Ian was ready to hop on a plane to come down and see me. I thought that was very sweet, and there is no way I can put into words how much I appreciate that.  I will be out of work for a little while, I am on medication that will make me a little unsteady on my feet. They thought it would be best if I stayed home, and I also am getting paid for it. So I will be posting more than I usually do.

      There is absolutely nothing to do today, I didn't make any plans to go outside or anything because the news said it was going to rain. I haven't seen any rain at all and now I have nothing to do. I guess I will just sit on my computer and chat with Ian, because he didn't make any plans either. Hopefully Ian will wake up soon, for some reason he always sleeps until noon these days. I don't know how he got into that habit.

      The lightening went as fast as it came, and the two officers were astounded that the figure disappeared right in front of their eyes. As the lighting quickly went back to the dim yellow, Wallace began to regain his senses. He turned to Mark and gave him a nod. Wallace pointed to the stairs and motioned Mark to follow close behind.             “I think he went up the stairs” Wallace whispered as he placed his hand on the railing of the stairs.              “How do you know? It disappeared right in front of us!” Mark said, in a clearly disturbed voice.             “That isn’t possible Mark; he must have gone up stairs. He couldn’t have moved passed us down the hallway” Wallace explained.             Wallace and Mark moved up to the very top of the stairs to find more blood on the floor. Yet, the stairs did not have any; moving down the upstairs hallway they stopped as one of the doors was slightly opened.             “I’ll check inside you go on ahead” Mark said as he opened the door and peeked inside.             Wallace continued down the hallway, while Mark disappeared behind the jarred door. Sheriff Wallace slowly and quietly moved down the hallway and finally stopped at the end. Where there was a single door, light was coming from inside.             “Why is there a light on? The power is out all over town…” Wallace said to himself as he put his hand on the door knob.             As he pushed the door inward, he placed his hand on the safety of the gun and switched it off. Slowly, Wallace entered the room. The light was so bright that Wallace couldn’t really see what was giving off light.             As Wallace’s eyes began to finally focus on the source of light, he noticed that it looked like the figure that Mark and him saw downstairs. He still couldn’t make out what the figure looked like.             “Who are you? What are you doing in this house?” Wallace said as he pointed the gun at the figure.             As he said those words a loud thump came from the hallway that drew Wallace’s attention. As he looked over and then looked back, the light had faded and the figure completely disappeared.             “What is that thing?” Wallace whispered to himself.             After standing there looking around for evidence, as if still looking for the figure; he quickly turned around again as he heard the sound that occurred just a few moments before.             “Mark! What is going on out there” Wallace yelled, yet when he went silent to listen for an answer, he heard none.             “Mark! Are you hearing me?” Wallace repeated again, hoping this time that his call will be returned, but it was not.             Wallace quickly swung around and exited the room that had once contained the figure they were so desperately looking for. As he exited he noticed that the door that Mark entered was shut. He stealthy moved down the hallway and placed his hand on the door knob.             Appling pressure to the door, he slowly went to push it in. Wallace’s pressure was then met by an equal pressure from the other side. It seemed as if something was holding the door shut.             “Mark, if you’re trying to play a joke on me, it isn’t funny” Wallace said as he gritted his teeth. Wallace then knew that Mark wasn’t playing a joke, and that Mark had never played a joke on anyone in his life.             With a worried look on Wallace’s face, he decided to ram the door inward. As he backed up to prepare for a charge into the door, it suddenly swung open. Standing there in the doorway was Isabel.             “Isabel! You’re alright!” Wallace said in complete surprise.             Wallace then realized that she wasn’t alright, she was obviously crying and she was soaked in blood.             “Isabel! What happened in here? There is blood all over the kitchen! And I saw a strange figure in the house!” Wallace jumped from one statement to another, not giving Isabel any time to respond.             “Wallace… where is Mark?” Isabel quietly responded without emotion.             “I don’t know, we split up, I thought he went into the room you just came out of” Wallace then replied, but reluctantly as if he did not trust her enough with the information.             “Are you sure you are okay?” Wallace then added as he moved to put his hand on her shoulder.             “Don’t touch me!” Isabel suddenly screamed as if she suddenly awoken from a deep sleep.             Isabel began to rock side to side, and mumble to herself. Isabel turned to the stairs and began to walk down them. As she reached the bottom, she stopped moving and starred at the closet door. Wallace was eyeing her carefully as he began to follow her. Wallace looked down and waited for her to move, but could tell she had zoned out again.             “Isabel you stay right there! I am going to check around upstairs more!” Wallace yelled, but knew Isabel hadn’t even heard him speak.             Wallace turned back from the stairs and walked towards the door that Isabel just came out of. Walking in, he noticed that the floor (like the kitchen) was covered in blood.             “What the hell?” Wallace said to himself as he looked at the floor, continuing to walk in.             He pushed the door open a little wider, and then stopped when he noticed there was something behind it that was causing resistance. With fear, Wallace began to pull the door back so that he could see what was behind it.             “Oh my god” Wallace said in horror when he saw what was on the floor, behind the door.             Wallace looked at the back of the door, only to find two hand prints on it. Hand prints that had been there, trying to keep him out a couple of minutes before. His eye’s looked down and saw that Mark was lying on the floor. Dead, his head looked as is someone had hit it with a bat. Blood soaked his uniform, and the entire floor below.             Wallace glanced up in the air as if he just realized something and turned and ran out of the room, slipping on the blood as he went.             “Isabel don’t you move!” Wallace screamed as he pulled his gun from it’s resting place once more.             Yet, when Wallace reached the stairs, he saw that Isabel was no longer at the bottom. He suspiciously crept down the stairs glancing around to make sure there was no one waiting for him at the bottom.             As he finally reached the bottom, he noticed the exact spot in which Isabel was standing. There were imprints of her feet in the blood that had covered the floor. He then began to follow where the prints were heading. As he reached the end of the tracks, he saw that they went directly into the closet.             “Isabel! Get out of the closet right now! Step out with your hands in the air!” Wallace screamed as he took a step back and pointed the gun at the door.             “Wally? Help” Isabel screamed a muffled yelp.             Wallace stood there confused for a minute, and then began to hear nails scratching on the door.             “Isabel step out of the closet right now!” Wallace remained standing and steadied his gun.             The last noise Wallace heard from the closet was a soft thump and then silence. He quickly walked forward and pulled at the door, yet it wouldn’t open. He placed the gun back in its holster and grabbed the knob with both hands and began to pull frantically.             “Isabel! Isabel! Answer me!” Wallace yelled as he pulled one last time before losing his footing on the floor and falling.             Wallace lay on the floor starring at the ceiling, when he heard something in the closet once again. He heard the door open up, as he tried to move, he noticed that he couldn’t. His heart beat quickened as he heard someone stepping closer and closer to him. He tried lifting his head, yet the pain was so great that he was unable to. The stepping stopped and he looked up at what was looking down at him. It was Isabel; she was looking in his eyes, as he was looking in hers.             “Where is Emily…? What have you done to Mark…?” Wallace managed to squeeze out in between the shots of pain in his back.             Isabel did not answer though, and she continued to look into Wallace’s eyes. The pain began to take the better of Sheriff Wallace, he lost consciousness and everything went black. The last thing he was looking at was the lifeless look in Isabel’s eyes.             Wallace stirred back and forth on the floor. He opened his eyes and closed them again, trying to make the pain in his back go away. It was no use though, he knew something was broken and that he would not be able to move.             “Isabel where are you?” Wallace finally broke the silence in the house, expecting to see Isabel near by.             “What is going on in here? Please call 911, I think my back is broken” Wallace pleaded to an uninterested ear.             He began to move his head around a bit, just so he could see if anyone was around him. That is when he noticed that the closet door was wide open. And when he looked down, he saw the Isabel was no longer in it. He looked at the back of the door, and there were those bloody hand prints again. Just like in the room upstairs. He could only study them for a second when a shot of pain went up his back, and he had to put his head on the floor again.

      My day off was pretty fun actually, I went over to Sarah's early in the morning and did something that I was not expecting to do. Later I went skateboarding and then returned to have a barbecue with Sarah's family, I then went skateboarding again. Now I am sitting home at eight (something I rarely do) and I am bored out of my mind. But, this boredom has given me the chance to finish up on that short story I started back when this website was first created.

      Don't think I haven't forgotten about my cell phone. I wanted Abby to send my cell phone through the mail to me. I called it earlier today, and she answered it. I bet she hasn't been yelled at like that since she was a little girl. I think she needs to send my fucking phone back to me right away, and stop making long distance calls.

      I heard about what happened a little while ago. I really hope Michelle will get better soon, I heard that she looked like she was 3 months pregnant because it was so swollen.  Other than that news, things have been pretty uneventful for me. I know Ian's weekend was much more confrontational then he would have liked. Mine including sitting on my couch on a Saturday morning watching Sonic X. It is very embarrassing, but there was nothing else to do.

      Late last night, it was brought to my attention by Adam that Michelle was rushed to the emergency room. What happened was that she was working somewhere when she accidentally stepped on a Mud Wasp nest. She was stung 20 times on her side, did I mention Michelle is deathly allergic to bee stings? Well, she is.  They found her passed out on the ground. She was then taken to the hospital, and that is when they called me. I was thinking about heading down there on an airplane, but they said she would be fine.  Anyway, she is going to be in the hospital for a couple of days and she will not be able to post at all. I am not sure if Abby has heard about this yet, but I am not going to tell her. Jackie already knows though and she will be posting soon too.

      I never finished the drawings I was supposed to do last night. My plan was to draw them and then post the pictures on this website, but plans changed. Instead I drank a lot of wine and watch   urlLink Cool Runnings   twice before I finally passed out on the floor. I awoke this morning in a pool of my own drool, and my dad was not to pleased to find me there, on the floor unconscious, with   urlLink Cool Runnings   playing in the background. We then had a little talk about my drinking habits and how I am underage and shouldn't drink. I told him that he need to trust me more, and that I only get drunk when I am alone. He didn't like hearing that either. So I think I am in a little trouble for today, but I will be back in a little while.

      This was possibly the worst night of my life. Starting off with squeezing into that tight dress, that showed off way more then I wanted too. Then I had to listen to Mute and Jackie taunt me for 2 hours, before I even left for the dinner.  As I sat in the car, I couldn't breath because the dress was to tight around my chest region. I didn't care for that at all. My stepmother also made the comment that I could use to show off myself a little, she also said that I am to pretty to hide it under all that clothing. Well, she is wrong and I don't need to dress up fancy for people.  Getting back to the story, we got there at around eight. To see a whole shit load of people already inside. All I wanted to do was sit down somewhere, where no one could find me. That didn't work out to well, because my dad and stepmom wanted to introduce me to every single person in the building. Guess what, There was no eye contact the entire night, unless you consider my chest eyes. It was ridiculous, and people wonder why I dress modestly. I cannot stand this shit.  Well, as I went from meeting each person, I continued to look for a way to get the hell out of there. I found my exit, it was the bathroom. I said that I had a stomach ache and then went to the bathroom. I stayed in there for about 15 minutes, but when I came out my dad had more people for me to meet.  When I finally sat down to eat, I was luckily sat against the wall, so I was no longer in the center of attention. I thought the hell that was the night was finally going to calm down. Not exactly; When dinner was served I caught this one old guy starring at me the entire time I was eating. If that doesn't make someone uncomfortable, I don't know what does.  We left that hell hole at midnight. I got home at about 12:10 and I am finally out of that tight dress I had been wearing since seven. I am still trying to get my normal breathing patterns back. I am completely exhausted from this night, and hopefully I don't half to go through it again.

      Abby is off at the banquet, Ian is in what he calls "the zone", and I am left bored out of my mind. It seems as though everyone else has something to do but me. Usually it would be the other way around. I guess I can't complain though, this is the first night I have been able to just sit around and do nothing. I finally can have sometime for myself, in which I can reflect on my life. Actually I think I am going to get drunk and watch  urlLink Cool Runnings  until I finally pass out on my floor. It sounds like a plan to me, so I won't be posting until sometime tomorrow.

      I have lost Ian for the night, apparently he finds Kingdom Hearts more interesting than anything else in the world. Even, dare I say? Women. That's right, I have discovered that Ian actually enjoys playing Kingdom Hearts more than talking to me, or anyone else in the world. I hope his house doesn't catch on fire because he would surely die. Blissfully but dead none the less. Anyway, I am finishing the picture drawing fiasco that I got myself into. Ian was going to help, but I don't think that is going to happen now that he is playing with Goofy and Donald.

      I have had the urge to play some Kingdom Hearts tonight. So you people will probably not see me until Friday. I will probably be sucked into it like I was yesterday, so I will be up until 1 in the morning playing it. Then I will be going to work until eight. So yeah, my time is short. Typing this now is even taking up precious time that could be going to Kingdom Hearts. So I am going to stop talking now, and go save Atlantica from the evil clutches of the Heartless.

      I sit here on my computer, before I go to leave for this banquet that I was forced to go to. I look like I am some rich snob. I also happen to notice that the dress I am wearing was probably worse than the one that showed off to much cleavage. It is pressing my breasts together so much that it hurts, and it makes them look even bigger than they actual are. It will be a mirical if I get through the night without having someone grab at me. As for Jackie and Ian's idea of taking a picture and posting it on the website, you two can go to hell. I want this night to be over, and I don't want any evidence of it actually happening. It's bad enough that I am going to have this dress hanging in my closet.

      Abby has continued to complain for about 3 hours now. The banquet is at eight, and she has to start getting ready at five. It is funny, because she hates wearing dresses so much, because she can't hide her "endowments". I know for a fact that this is going to be the most uncomfortable night for her in her entire life. I also wish that Ian and I were there to see this monumental event.  Ian and I have been ridiculing Abby for two days now, and we won't stop until the night is over.

      My stepmother's boss has invited her and her family to a banquet tonight. Now this may seem nice, except for the fact that I am apart of her family. That means I am not only going to have to show up at this dinner, but I also find out that I am going to wear some crazy evening dress, because my style of dressing is unacceptable at this place.  I'll let everyone in on a little secret, I don't like dressing up for anybody. I am fine with my sweater and cargo pants. Yet I was going to be wearing some black dress that shows a little to much cleavage. I told everyone I wasn't going if I had to wear that dress, luckily my stepmother found a dress that was a little more in my taste. So now I have to go.  When I told Mute about this, all he did was start laughing, he added after the laugh "Have fun with guys staring at your boobs all night". While Jackie may not have a problem with showing a little breast, I do. This is going to be possibly the worst night of my entire life. And Mute and Jackie are getting a kick out of it. Good thing they are having fun, because next time I see them, they are going to get their asses kicked.

      Well Sarah left today to go to college. I still didn't figure out what college she was going to. I think she told me once before, but I guess I just didn't remember. Somewhere out in West Virginia I think.

      In 1994, The Elder Scrolls: Arena was released to the public. It was amazing to say the least, it's non-linear gameplay and nicley developed RPG system was raved about by everyone whom played it. Here is a description of The Elder Scrolls: Arena by the people whom made it,      Arena started, as the name might suggest, as a medieval-style gladiator game. You had a team of fighters and went around the world fighting other teams in each city's arena until you became grand champion in the Imperial City. The world used for Arena was Tamriel, the fantasy world created by a few members of the staff for use in their weekly D&amp;D campaign. During development of Arena, more and more RPG elements were added -- what if you could walk around these cities? What if you could take your team into a dungeon? And soon it was clear what Arena needed to be -- a full-blown RPG.  Inspired by such games as Ultima Underworld and the unheralded Legends of Valour, Arena was now seen as a massive first-person RPG -- the game that recreated the pen-and-paper RPG experience -- be who you want and do what you want. For a long time Arena was a party-based game, where you lead a group of adventurers. This style of play proved less fun in first person, so Arena became a single character game.   Arena was to be the first chapter in an ongoing series of games, so the series took its name from Tamriel's mystical tomes of knowledge that told of its past, present, and future -- The Elder Scrolls.   Now why am I talking about a 10 year old game? The answer is simple, the people over at  urlLink Bethesda  have re-released The Elder Scrolls: Arena. Not for sale mind you, but for free. You can download it at their Elder Scrolls  urlLink website . I suggest you do, because I already did and I love it.

      I forced a copy of   urlLink Start Something   by the   urlLink Lostprophets   on Mute today. Mute came home today from his friends house to find that the mailman dropped it off in his mail box. Mute said he didn't like it at first, but after listening to it for a while, he told me they had some good qualities. Of course I knew this, that is why I sent it to him in the first place.  The   urlLink Lostprophets   are probably one a band that I enjoy quite a lot. It is very embarrassing to admit this though, because of their "fake punk-rock" image they acquired. I don't want to like them, yet I am compelled to. Just like Muteman is.

      If you haven't heard, on the  Viral Cartoon Show  Michelle announced that she was leaving both websites. She asked both Adam and I for our advice, and we both told her the same thing. That if she didn't want to be on the websites anymore, that no one was going to force her to do it.  I guess she agreed with us, and now she will no longer be posting on the website.

      After hanging out with Sarah for a little while this morning, I returned home and sat in my chair deciding what I was going to do with the rest of the day. As I sat there contemplating my next action I saw my copy of   urlLink Kingdom Hearts   sitting on top of my Playstation 2. I decided I had nothing better to do, so I started playing it.  6 hours later, my foot was asleep, and I was two inches from my TV screen. I some how was trapped in a little world in which nothing but saving the world from the Heartless mattered.  Apparently while I was trying to save everyone from the Heartless, Abby was trying to get a hold of me. I should have heard my cell phone ring, when it was sitting right next to me, but I was so busy with the keyblade that I tuned every other noise out except the sounds of Daffy Duck yelling "Sora!".

      Okay, so now the other website is gone, after lasting about a week. Abby has become friends with Ian once again, and I wanted to only focus on one thing at a time. So here we are again.  It's funny, no matter where we go, or threaten to go. It looks as if we always come back here, as if it is a secret mental meeting place for us. Anyway, that site is gone and now the three of us will be focusing on Kakutama. The only thing that hasn't changed in the past day, is the name of this website.

      Looks like I am running Kakutama now. Ian has gone crawling back to Jackie like a lost puppy. So I guess I will run this myself, Michelle is not posting for some reason too. I think everyone is going against me. Oh well, I guess things were bound to go this way eventually.
