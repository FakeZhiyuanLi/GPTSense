      I came across this poem about 6 years ago. The book that accompanies it holds many truths about who we are and why we love the way we do. This is an inspirational poem and I have given it to those I love in my life as gifts.  At various points in my life since I discovered teh poem I have come back to it to gain wisdom from it. Last night I picked it up for the first time in about a year and it put allmy present worries in perspective again. I hope it inspires soemone out there today.  The Invitation by Oriah Mountain Dreamer  It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing. It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive. It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain! I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it, or fix it.  I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human. It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.  I want to know if you can see beauty even when it's not pretty, every day, and if you can source your own life from its presence.  I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, "Yes!" It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children. It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here.  I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back. It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.  Copyright of Oriah Mountain Dreamer 1994

                                             It Tells in the Eyes  Like a Spectre it envelopes me, grasping at my throat, Ravishing the peace and filling me with torment. Suckling on my breasts and mocking flesh, It laughs in the face of emptiness. Absence.  Haunting, an unborn child lost in its fruition, It feels it way aimlessly through my mind. Wrapping its wanting lips around my thoughts, Holding dreams of breathless rejection, Desire.  A false truth, a temporary tonic, It feels like hope but smacks of indifference, Beyond the pain but before joy, It sits uneasy between her legs, Comfort.  It tells in the eyes, a respectful ease, Achieving the most, loving the best, Sweet promise, soft love, Love earned, love that is real, Awareness.  But it twitches in anticipation, Hostage behind the wall of indifference, Hold’s itself up to pangs of desire, Its disguise Intellect.  But were it not for this we would cease to exist, Time would pass insipidly, Love a mere blush in the tissues of intimacy, Clutching the tired harness of duty.

      When we two parted…  There is a stillness in my blood, A tear ripples the water Our farewell looms near Courage within, don’t let me falter. I remember you warmly And the curls I longed to touch. The lips that made me wonder You leave me needing too much. The mist that rose between us Blurred the edges of our meaning Our minds forever entwined You abandon me now, alone and dreaming When we two parted With silenced tears I feel the regret we will have When we think of the years Years spent knowing, longing and dry The years spread before us Wondering why? Why cruel as destiny is, I bared my soul Creating the connection But sparing your role. When we two parted With a swift embrace A flicker of love So soft, just a trace.

      Patch-work doll  I wandered lonely as a cloud To see what sights I could behold. But it held nothing. Surrounded by empty shells. Broken mirrors reflect shattered images and fragmented solids. And I find myself amongst the pieces Patch-work doll. But I still have my soul, And so I sing.  Who is the ‘I’ that I dream of? Am I the ‘I’ that is the truth that wandered? I have built my dreams on those daffodils, And watched the sunbeams in silence and solitude through broken windows. Waiting for the rains. Which have come. To fall heavy, And weigh down my sodden frame. I sink.

      Aromatic Ignition   I can smell you, near, close, just so close. Blood rushes to my head and down into my lips I can smell you hair still on my pillow. Musty afterthought of the sweat of the night before. My lips can taste the salt you left on my sheets And the whispers between my legs. Soft echoes of shy moans and fluid touches. Your tongue on my thigh, Flesh on my breast. I blush at your stance Proud and protruding. Just like my need for you, And your tongue And your taste And your lips, On my tips. On my tips, Your lips.  Hanging onto the thought of your shoulders, Bearing the weight of our desire. I am a screaming wolf, Feed me, knead me, lead me. I am green, and ripe, and raw. This is your dish to serve as you please For only I can nourish you and fill your centre With thoughts of my lips, And my tips and my hips. I can feel you inside me outside me, Tame this wolf, never. Just lay with me as we bite and scratch our way through desire. And teach me, Unleash me. And bite me, Ignite me, Ignite me, And bite me.  Wet me, Don’t fret me, There’s no regret with me.

      Pleasure  In and out, Rise and dip, Fall about, Biting lip. Sweating palms, Tightening grip, Arching back, And writhing hip.  Cold words, Angry sighs. Tightening lips, And watering eyes, Folded arms, And edge of bed. Feeling rejected By the back of your head.  Pleasure.

      Falling  I am here, Falling. Soft winds blow at the door where our shadows have merged. There’s a slight chill to the air that feeds the depth of your sleep. I am breathing this stale air that we share and I am Falling.  I am still here, Weeping. Watching your chest rise and fall, curls crush against the pillow, The contour of your jaw against my forehead, resting on my temple. I am tasting the life that flows through you and I am Weeping.  I am restless, Reaching. Trying to fall under the lull of the raindrops on the window With my arms wrapped around you and the heat of your body I am breathing to the rhythm of your beat, and to your heart I am Reaching.  I am still restless, Nurturing. I feel the distance between your nightmares and my dreams, Between my present need and your future fears. I am caught between pleasure and exhaustion but  I am Nurturing.  I am falling, Bleeding. Your lips are by my cheek, your hand entwined in mine, Hide away all my fears, wipe away these tears, I want to open these pages to you from which my soul is Bleeding.  I have fallen, Forgiving. To let myself go again to a place of unknown pains and ecstasies. The yearning to be near, not to fear, just to be with you. In this space where we are full of possibility, and the universe is Forgiving.  Always falling, but we’re moving.

      So why did I create a blog? Well I've been meaning to have a space in the online virtual world for ages now to post things up. Like my academic pieces of writing, journal articles, my poetry, diaries and updates on my life, travelogs and just general thoughts and issues that are on my mind. I meet so many peopple around the world through my work, my travels etc and I loose contact so easily in the rush of life so now people can check in on this spcae and see what I'm up to.  So I'm going to start with a short story I wrote a while agao when I was ill that I'm very proud of. It would help if you listened to The Frames cd 'Set List' before reading it or listening to it as teh songs appear in the story. I wrote this after having 5 consecutive nights of no sleep and being in the most unbearable pain I have ever known whilst in hospital last July. the Short story format is not my strong point, I'm a better poet but this was a good effort I believe. Enjoy. Its teh next post.

      Unicorns and Patchwork Dolls: A journey through pain and fluidity  by  Aisling McCormack  “I will write you a letter that explains the way I’m thinking….” – Lay Me Down by The Frames 2002 [1]   “Oh I was in hospital for a bit, I’m grand now, no really. I’m on treatment but hopefully it’ll work. But I’m grand seriously, not a bother. Sure you can’t keep a good thing down.”  After two consecutive nights, I decided I had had enough. Two nights of cold sweats from the pain. The pain this time was unparalleled to the previous occasions. I was going into A&E, no hesitation do it now. Whatever muscle I’d pulled or strained I had definitely fucked it up now. Nausea spurring me on I made my way to the hospital. Sterile, puerile places full of tubes and machines, sounds of wheels and beeps. Standard greetings….personal details; what insurance do you have? Where do we send the bill? Then the tests begin, the tubes emerge and I’m hooked up to an ECG (Electro Cardiogram) and as my luck would have it there is an irregularity. More nurses and doctors stream in and out redoing the ECG, asking me if I had a heart defect before this and all I can think about is when am I getting out of here? One small ECG was to begin the most painful 14 days of my young life so far and the beginning of a journey through what can best be described now in retrospect as a journey of confusion and confirmation of a disease no one is sure I have.  I’m in so much pain as I lie in the A&E, trying not to throw up from it. A sequence of blood is taken and tubes are inserted into my arm. More x-rays and more ECG’s follow and I’m awaiting a bed. I have to have a ‘heart echo’ first. A heart echo is an ultrasound of your heart. One takes the heart for granted, it just floats there somewhere in your chest, pumping life around unnoticed, its just there. I watched it on the screen wondering if my heart knew that I could see it. I felt as if I was intruding, a voyeur of my own beating existence. Watching my blood flow, I became entranced by my own mortality. I imagine that the ultrasound of the foetus could equal this sense of wonder, so I savour the moment because I know I may never feel this childlike awe again until I hold my first born in my arms.  Blurred nights filled with pain followed. The prognosis at this stage was ‘pericarditis’, possibly. I had fluid around my heart and on my lungs. Teams of doctors proceeded to stream in and out of my ‘cell’ as I streamed in and out of a painful level of exhaustion. I couldn’t sleep. The wards reeked of illness and frustration. Frustration at the doctors that never come, the diagnosis that is never made and the privacy no one is entitled to. Like a broken violin string in my ears constantly – the pain. My flesh mocked me into submission through my desperation to sleep, but I was submitting to fluidity, semi consciousness, it would not give me rest.  More doctors, more tests, more bloods…  “So what happens when the heart just stops? Stops caring for anyone, When the hollow in your chest dries up […] But the body goes on living. The blood crawls to a slow and stops….” So What Happens When the Heart Just Stops – The Frames 2002  Welcome to the Cardiac Care unit where we provide round the clock service to those suffering from cardiac related disorders. In our five star suites we have many state of the art machines, which tell us if you are going to die. Here we keep people dying who need 24 hour monitoring and care. Whilst staying in the Unit if your feel like your about to die please do not hesitate to contact one of our friendly nurses who will assist you with your resuscitation. We hope you enjoy your stay and we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your patronage.  I spent one night in the Cardiac unit. It was, I understand, just routine to keep me monitored. I had been ill that day, my heart rate was high. I was hooked up to a monitor and was surrounded by extremely ill people. I felt like a fraud. That I wasn’t ill enough to be here. I was scared. Alone. Empty. Numb. My parents were going spare with worry but I couldn’t answer their questions, I couldn’t even answer my own questions. And I felt so alone in the world.  What’s wrong with me? When can I go home? Do I need surgery? And meanwhile behind the scenes are those doctors who don’t answer questions. All they can tell me is that a young healthy woman such as me shouldn’t have this condition (which has no name yet, the condition that dareth speaketh its name). They are baffled, I’m baffled. More tests. Jesus Christ I just need to sleep. Please God some sleep, please. When I was moved back to the ‘normal’ ward for people who are just consumed by a ‘normal’ level of sickness I searched for my refuge. Where could I go where there were no doctors, nurses, sick old people just my sleepless soul and me? I found the oratory.  In the end no matter how much we try to deny its existence or run from its truth we always turn to God when we have nowhere else to go. I cried for the pain to stop, I prayed for my parents to understand my own confusion, I prayed for answers and I pleaded for sleep. God was very close to me. I sensed his/ her helplessness. I just had to go through the motions and God would get me through to the other side, somehow. I meditated through the pain, sang through it in my mind, cried through it and tried to smile through it all. Managing consisted of one-liners for the nurses and doctors and telling some concerned friends that I was fine, “smiling whilst all the time sticking a fork into the back of my hand.”  The best doctor, comfort that I had in those sleepless nights was me, making myself laugh, being my own company. There may be some sadness in that but the irony outweighed it all and provided me with endless entertainment and amusement.  “Star, Star, Teach me how to shine, shine, Teach me so I know what’s going on in your mind. ‘Cause I don’t understand these people, Who say the hill’s too steep, Well they talk and talk forever but They just never climb….” Star, Star – The Frames 2002  Because we all climb those mountains everyday without the luxury of time to think about it. Sleepless night number four. I swayed to and fro between worlds. Sleep deprivation is a tool of torture widely used around the world. I was beginning to understand its effectiveness. It was creating a tidal world around me. I was sliding between nausea and pain, comfort and torment, ease and terror, happiness and sadness, peace and paranoia. Waves of me, waves of my soul, waves of the various ghosts I called to, waves of God, waves of concerned parents, waves of worried looks, waves of friends who cared and waves of ‘friends’ who never called. I bobbed up and down on the tips of reality. “I want my life to make amends, I want my life to make more sense…” Pavement Tune – The Frames 2002  The weekend came and went amidst a haze of visitors and flat Lucozade. But Monday brought with it an unexpected surprise. SUCCESS! If this was a movie this is the part where they insert the following sequence. It’s that scene in Dangerous liaisons where John Malcovich runs into the room with the letter from his conquered love. He runs to Glenn Close to claim his reward, running through the corridors shouting “SUCCESS!!!”. Snippet ends. I had no love to conquer, nor had I conquered anything really but I had a semi diagnosis. So perhaps the Malcovichian dramatics were spent on deaf ears. If this prose had a voiceover it would have been more successful. Anyway, back to the storyline… Fuck, I wasn’t prepared for this one. It was a dark day. I was hysterical but calmed by my weakness  or else I really knew this was coming. Daddy came up straight away. We sat in the oratory. He hugged me like Daddy’s do, held my hand like Daddy’s do but he couldn’t do the one thing Daddy’s did when you were little – make everything better, make the sickness go away. Connective tissue disease or rheumatoid arthritis. Just say it and leave. And that’s what we are paying you €150,000 plus a year for. Just drop this on me and feck off. Cheers. Have a nice day. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for you patronage!  Concentrate, this is the science bit…  A virus, possibly, triggered a malfunction in my immune system that one is genetically predisposed to. Previous attacks were, possibly, a warm up and this attack was the headliner. The synovium covering my heart, lungs etc. was inflamed. I, POSSIBLY, have an autoimmune disease.  “Let me off of this boat I'm sick of this ride the world is heading ever southward and I can't stay in here and you're lying awake away on your side the sickness  comes in waves and burns and I don't wanna die Santa Maria - The Frames 2002  Shit! Shit! Is it debilitative? Will I have it forever? Was I going to die? It sounds dramatic but this was day five of the sleepless marathon. Nothing less than death felt remotely dramatic. Tears, more tears. Jesus why now? My life is at its peak. I was beginning to come into my own space. The bulimia, the depression, the heartache, the loneliness and the five years of intermittent counselling. Now I was finally me. I was aroused by my own reflection. “Hey world come and get me!” Because one day some lucky bastard is going to wake up beside me and think, “Wow! She’s lying beside me, we are lying here together”, and life is good. Fuck it, why now? Just when I get my head sorted out my body starts attacking itself. Laugh or cry? Just do both at once.  Waves of pain, waves of exhaustion, waves of parental concern, waves of disappointment, more waves of disappointment (why weren’t you calling me? you ‘friends’ of mine, fuck the lot of you!).  Mammy make the pain stop. Kiss it better. I wanted so much for you to throw your arms around me, hold me and tell me that it’d be ok. But you couldn’t, and I understand why, I have always understood why, but that day I didn’t need to understand it. I needed a hug, I needed to be four again, I needed to be given comfort not interrogated, not labelled. I was angry, then hurt, now just disappointed. We all deal with things differently. I just need to be that small child again, craving a hug. Please hug me mammy. No I can’t make the doctors give me answers, it’s not my fault they didn’t call around today and No, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just needed a hug, to feel like no one could hurt me, enfold me in your feathers. I know you love me but this is my reality now at this moment in time. My moment in time. So raw still even after all the talking, all that ‘Jonathan’ time, but still so raw. AT this point the sleepless nights had reduced my body to a pool of exhaustion. Morphine. Morphine and sleeping tablets…finally some sleep. They told me today it wasn’t Lupus. They were to go back on their word but today it wasn’t Lupus. Treatment starts…steroids  Concentrate, this is the science bit…  Drug name: Prednisolone Deltacortril. Dosage: 30 mg. “Should be withdrawn gradually in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse.” Will I relapse?  Science bit again….  Side effects: There is a whole list to choose from, but I focus in on the ones staring at me in huge big bright flashing red lights. Guess. What do you think would worry an ex-bulimic depressive with a compulsive personality?  DEPRESSION, WEIGHT GAIN, WATER RETENTION, ANXIETY, INSOMNIA, BLOATING PARTICULARLY OF THE FACE.  Yes, there they were with a full orchestra and backing chorus.  The morphine, steroids and sleeping pills kick in. The sea becomes still, not calm because the currents rage underneath. Its misleading, you can still die from the current of the calm waters. Reality is reconnecting slowly. Pieces of the puzzle float around. The following are just a taste of the puzzle pieces:  The pain, oh God, the pain, searing pain The arms that could not comfort The love of friends The disappointment with ‘friends’ (I open my heart, I take you all in, I let you feed from me, and I am betrayed. Round and round the mulberry bush we go!) No man will ever love me like my daddy What do you do with the label’ disease’? Sleep deprivation – it uses and dimensions Old people – I shared the ward with old senile people, old incontinent people and people whose bodies had given up long before their minds were ready to stop existing. What’s the point having an active mind when you can’t even take a piss by yourself? Just let me die. But I am young and this is what's happening – my body can’t keep up with my mind. I guess it happens to us all. Golf – fascinating game really. Putting balls into holes. Precision, competition. I watched it from my hospital bed. God. When you go to summer camp you meet someone who becomes your 'bestest' friend in the camp and you tell eachother all your secrets and promise to write after the summer. I promise to keep in touch God, I really do! Life is so real to me in this moment. My mind is full of unanswered moments and my heart full of a thousand tears I tried not to cry here. There is no privacy in a hospital. You are denied freedom, denied health, denied sleep and robbed of your privacy. But the nurses are carers because they care, and they do.  And so it begins… Slowly start with the corner pieces and work you way in… I’m so many people in one. I’m a mother, lover, peacekeeper, singer, writer, counsellor, preacher, actor, friend, diplomat, teacher…I believe I could be any of these things, I so want to be all of them. My body must allow me to try at least. I wake up each day and feel each one of these people inside me flowing through my veins. And so the day begins like that, a buzzing uncertainty of who I want to be today, where will I let my life take me?  BUT…and here is the opening and concluding paragraph to my existence in this moment, in my current reality….  I still fall asleep in my own arms. To the comfort of my own caress. In the stale air of my own solitary breath. And awaken in the mist of my own sweat. “…waking up making love to a wall.” (Jewel – Spirit)  Tears again, falling down, release. Poor me. Its ok, just cry, you’ll be ok. And all the while the incessant snoring of my inmates. Shut up!  My body speaks to me. It speaks with a voice that rises from my fingers, throbbing into my shoulder, across my chest. It defies me to push past the pain. It mocks me.  “Go on, lean on me, push it, but it’ll hurt. Go on make it difficult for yourself. Just like your mother, always the martyr”.  “Feck it! Forget it! I’ll lay on my back!”  Ten days in this hospital. Ten days to be institutionalised. I managed a walk in the grounds today. I felt the sun beat down on my face. I have a sense of a life gone by, a past existence when I once before felt this self same sun in my confinement. My bedside view is the Dublin Mountains, which can inspire one in the morning as the sunrises and it fills you with sadness as it sets. There is a pattern to the gatherings on the golf green beneath the mountains. The doves begin the day, slowly joined by magpies and the pigeons. Just pottering around in exploratory circles. I have no idea what they are searching for, just as they have no inclination to seek the destination of my journey. It doesn’t matter how we get there, once we are on the green, we join the pattern, seeking the stray souls and hunting for a source of nourishment. Meanwhile I’m walking around in my own circles as  people keep asking me questions. I can feel the stress rising as I’m quizzed as to my condition, you need a label, a name but I can’t give it to you. We are a people obsessed with our need for labelling, compartmentalising. If its not labelled it becomes beyond our control. I am out of control. It is beyond my control. This is my disease, my problem, my disorder. You cannot control this. That’s not love. You have to see it for what it really is. It’s control. So easily confused with love. Just hold me in your arms like you never have and love me. Unconditionally.  I am diseased. I am a problem. I am disordered.  That’s what has always been there, hidden behind the many faces. Do I believe that now? Hell, no! I’m a “beautifully wonderful cosmic miracle”. But no one explained that to the confused little girl who went to sleep wondering why she made everyone so angry around her and prayed she’d wake up in the morning the perfect child. Thin and not so annoying to other people. The perfect doll. But Aisling’s diseased. Aisling’s a problem. Aisling’s disordered. Aisling’s broken. A patchwork doll.  There is a patchwork doll that has two sides, two faces. One side is a happy face with a flower on her cheek. The other side a sad face with a tear under one eye. For some reason I can’t remember I defaced the sad side with biro. I think it was because I didn’t like the sad face. I only wanted her to have a happy face. I never displayed the sad side, she always sat on my shelf sunny side up. Now lets not psychoanalyse this. Our energies are better spent analysing the pigeons and their circles. Just like all my toys were female. Now I have no problem with the concept of gender and the neurosis it entails. However, in the infinite wisdom that adulthood brings, I have come to think of teddies as being beyond gender. Now they are just teddies. I brought the doll to my therapy session once and the real patchwork doll tried to come along with me to most of them.  A unicorn is a noble creature. Full of pride and a knowledgeable elegance. A pure spirit of serenity and nobleness. Quick to temper in defence. Slow to hatred in assscension. It is a crime to hurt one, a sin to kill one and a curse to spill its blood. Truly mystical. magical. Astounded in its presence by its capacity to emanate love and warmth; passion and gentleness; knowledge and humility; greatness and weakness. And I am happy. Happy because life is not about major events, about earth shattering happiness. Happiness is about knowing change, accepting it and not planning its outcomes. Happiness is not tomorrow but always yesterday. Its all about coexistence and absence,  Unicorns and patchwork dolls.
