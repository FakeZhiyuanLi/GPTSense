      What the crap?  No posts for four days?  Are you all just waiting for me to make my blogging debut before you get back on the trolley?  Well, I also feel obligated to post so that people visiting this blog will not be smashed in the face with that anti-philadelphia-sports-teams post.  For those of you who don't know me (i.e. everyone but ziks), here's a  urlLink pic.   I'm the furthest right in the second row.  You may also recognize our resident anti-philadelphia-sportsian, ziks, in the front row left.  I think this should suffice for now.  I will leave you all with a Joe Paterno quote from this past week:   urlLink "What the hell do I know about downloading music?" Paterno said. "I can't download a jar of peanut butter."

      dear philly,  i remember bak to 1987, but only because of pretzel day.  wednesday was pretzel day.  it was a wonderful thing.  after school, i would frolic in a pretzel playground to the tune of 10 cents a piece.  many pretzels were had.  many. perhaps someone should have taken some pretzels down to your ice mates, the flyers.  in 87 you'll remember, the flyers were busy losing the stanley cup.  again.  they had taken a one year break from presenting someone else the cup in 1986, after their true to form performance in 1985.  that was after getting the islanders going in 1980, and sparking the canadiens in 1976.  both of those teams went on to win 4 consecutive cups.  even though the oilers didn't win 4 cups in a row, they did beat your flyers twice, so that kind of atoned for it.  then in 1997, just to prove that they hadn't forgotten their hospitality, the flyers got the red wings off their 42 year stanley cup winning snide by giving them the cup in 4 games. knowing all of that, it's good to know that your boys didn't make it to the cup this year.  see, the flames haven't won the cup in 15 years, so it would have been about time for them to cash in their philly chips.  you should send along an apology to calgary.  you've really thwarted some of her chances.  i'm sure you know better than me that that's just the tip of the iceberg with your sports teams.  if it's not the eagles losing the NFC championship game 3 years in a row (not to mention having one of the most dismal teams in the history of the league (thank you cardinals!)), then it's the phillies winning one championship in 100 years.  i really don't understand.  first of all, if you ever see boston, please kick him in the balls.  all i ever hear is griping: 'we can't win a world series.  we have our heads shoved way up our asses.  we're stupid and deserve a title.'  eat shit boston.  you've only won about 48 basketball titles, and your football squadron has somehow squeaked out 2 of the last 3 super bowls (did i mention the eagles didn't make it to those super bowls because they were busy losing championship games?).  sorry phil, i'm really not even a flyers fan anymore.  i just think it's kind of sad at this point.  and as the days get longer, my eyes do their normal turn from an ice-bound loss to a hopeful field of fortune.  this is the time of year where the jerseys come off, and the Phillies caps are dragged bak out, hoping that this year will be different.  anyway phil, not really sure where i'm headed with this.  just wanted to know what makes you so different.  why is it that miami can have a baseball team for 10 years and win the series one more time than we have since 1880whatever?  why do we spend all our time hosting other dynasties?  how come a team from carolina can roll in to your humble dwellings and rock a team that just completed a 4th and 26?  why didn't we hit the homerun in game 6 in 93 to send it to a seventh game?  why wasn't anyone shocked when any of that happened?  so if you could get bak to me, that would be great.  love, ziks  ps, also, could you send a detailed guide of what to do in the case that the phillies win the series this year.  it's been about 20 years, and we really don't know how to react to winning.  thanks  z

      i still haven't decided if this is a mistake or not.  i have two basic tenets concerning girls: 1) they're crazy 2) they do whatever they want.  i'm not a misogynist or anything.  in fact, i'm very far from that.  items 1 and 2 are just what i've observed from my 22 years.  and just so nobody thinks i'm making baseless arguments here, i had two sisters that i lived with for 12 years or so, and i currently live with a girl.  on the whole, those girls were not 1 and 2, but they certainly have their flashes.  i'm glad it's like that though.  if everyone went about making rational decisions all the time, we would lead quite the boring existence.  i also understand that guys don't always make the most informed choices; i've lived with them too.  this post isn't really about guys though.  actually, it's not about girls in the plural sense either.  it's about 1 girl who had slid off the radar but has now resurfaced as a little blip somewhere in the distance.  little blips can be the worst:  you know that something's there, and you know you don't have to do anything about it immediately, but you feel like maybe you should.  i'm currently doing something about my blip.  i saw her in the mall just last weekend.  it was a 'small world' moment if there ever was one.  i only go to that mall about once a month now since i no longer live 10 minutes from it.  once upon a time i went at least once a week, but those days are long gone.  so are the days of me talking to this girl.  the girl that for no imagineable reason i saw in the mall as i was headed towards Strawbridge's.  small world.  i know she saw me too.  there was a moment where our eyes met, and while i couldn't see mine, i know there was panic in hers.  i passed her though, kept right on going.  i felt no obligation to say anything since i feel that our demise was mostly her fault.  the tense of feel and felt are very important.  i 'felt' that way.  then i heard that earlier you had seen me when i wasn't paying attention, and that you really thought about tapping me on the shoulder.  it was no surprise to me that you didn't; you never were any good at that sort of thing.  consider this the tap.  you have my attention.  you now have a chance to explain why you decided to take up 1 and 2 after fully convincing me that that wasn't you.  there are some rules though: 1)  i'm not doing this over IM or over the phone 2)  you'll have to come to me 3)  my direction skills have improved, so if i give you directions, you'll find me.  that's it.  i know you love making decisions, so here's one for you.  it's a chance to set the record straight, because my record is pretty warped.   haven't played any poker in a few days, which means i'm still up.  go me!  oh yeah, i officially locked up the average title on thursday nights, meaning i bowled in 2 leagues and won 2 averaged titles.  not too shabby.  -ziks

      Recently I came up with a movie quote that has stumped a large number of us.  Between, Skiz, Ess Cha and myself alone, I expect almost every good movie/TV quote to fall into our field of knowledge.  The quote was simply "I'm taking this".  About a dozen people got roped into trying to figure out which comedy film it came from.  We all remembered the scene, but couldn't quite place where it had come from.  Upon searching the internet for such a basic series of words, we were bombarded with over a billion irrelevent worthless sites.  An IMDB search proved to offer every TV show and movie known to mankind that has these words EXCEPT for the one we sought.   (On a high note, I did learn that some very classy woman says "I'm taking this in the a$$!!!" in the ever popular film "She Likes it on Her Face". Obviously a classic) In the end....the search proved fruitless as weeks passed.  Enter Kenny Richards  In a random conversation yesterday I brought up the quote, not realizing that Kenny had been on travel for 2 weeks all throughout the search period.  He immediately piped up with...that's Jim Carrey in, i think "The Mask".  We brainstormed further and realized it was when he's paying for his car being impounded and he grabs an air freshner on the way out.  I then remembered that it is from "Liar Liar", and soon after all was right in the world.  So there it is Ess Cha, Skiz, and anyone else who gives a crap (probably no one). It's Jim Carrey inLiar Liar....  and I'm out like Skiz's love of men.

      First off I have to say good job Ess Cha, may your reign be long and fruitful, and by that I mean ends today.  Now that is out of the way on to more important issues.    While sitting in my cube (which is not a cube at all), a question came to mind (actually it was forced into my mind), Is no response better than a forced response?  Obviously the members of this blog think the forced response is better (see  urlLink this ).  I don't understand this logic, now instead of having no profiles we have contrived profiles.  Now before Ess Cha goes on his rant and fills in the quote we all know is coming ("Do you want cheese with that whine?"), I have one thing to say, Shut it, just shut it.  How can someone complain about my complaint, when I am only responding to his complaint (got all that?)?    Ok, enough bitching and back to random thoughts.    Possibly the most interesting tid bits of information you'll ever pick up are from hall way conversations.  Now don't get me wrong, I am not trying to listen, in fact I try not to listen (although there seems to be an inverse relationship between these) but when someone says "FIGMO" you can't help but wonder, what the hell is "FIGMO", well now I know.  Now you can't help but listen, you're engrossed in the conversation to the point where you almost blurt out "Yeah, the Mets do suck this year!"  But somehow you restrain yourself.    BTW "FIGMO" = F it got my orders.  Still bored?  Hit up  urlLink BornAttheZoo.com  and write my movie, or you can go read my profile! Yay!

      bakground:  my dad, who will henceforth be known as padre, has been bowling for many years.  he taught me how to roll, he taught my brother, my sisters, small villages ... basically any creature with an opposable thumb and an ear has learned something about bowling from padre.  unfortunately, he has never thrown a 300.  nor, to my surprise, has he ever won a league.  me and league titles go together like spic and span, but never for padre.  going into tonight, we were 1 game ahead of second place and in control of our own fate.  we had just played this team 2 weeks ago and taken 4 of 4 from them.  we decimated them.  they had every reason to want to permanently damage both our families and friends. additional bakground:  padre had been having what he might consider an 'average year'.  padre's average this year is a 208.  only to padre would this be an average year.  he had been showing signs of breaking out a few weeks before, but then just last week his neck was bothering him, and he just wasn't himself.  it was tough to watch padre not be his superhuman self, but i learned that that was all part of the show.  when padre absolutely unearthed all 10 in the first frame tonight, you could tell something was up.  i then proceeded to watch what could only be described as a herculean display of 10 pin annihilation.  ball after ball eviscerated the pocket leaving nothing behind.  there were no lucky breaks, no cheap ones, no jersey, nothing.  every time i saw his ball zip toward the pocket i had to protect my eyes to make sure that no pin shrapnel jettisoned into them.  pins on other lanes started falling, and to top it off, another local bowling alley had to cancel its league night due to unexplained pinfall.  what was i to do but try to keep up with him?  i was only playing john henry to his steel driving machine, only in this version the steel driving machine wins, and then turns john henry into a railroad tie.  padre threw the first 9 strikes in the first game, then decided that bowling was a trivial sport and went 9 spare, strike, for a 279.  i could only stand by and watch and strike.  i rolled the first 9 as well, but finished short with a 278.  our team won by about 50.  after an effort like that, you always joke and say, 'guess you'll have to get them all next game.'  then padre, the smoothest motherfu**ker in the whole joint, went out and tried to do just that.  i tried reasoning with him.  i tried showing him pictures of the families of the pins that he was mercilessly slaughtering, but there was no reaching him.  he continued to plunder the pocket to the tune of 10 strikes in a row, finishing with a 289.  i wasn't even close, posting only a 245.  at this point, we had completely wrapped up the second half championship.  we won the second game by 200 pins.  when dad and i talked about this week following the previous week of bowling we both said something like, 'we're going to have to bring it all next week.'  then padre did.  no, f that, not only did he bring it all, he asked for everyone else's and brought that.  then he just mashed the pins for about 2 and a half hours.  at the end of the night, some sort of kryptonic force caught up to him and held him to a 203, thus capping his night at 771.  i was in awe.  i have never seen anyone so locked in.  i'm pretty sure i've been that locked in, but when you're doing it, you can't see it happening.  it just is.  i rolled a 769, and while the scores may look close, it really wasn't.  the last game didn't count for anything, except a potential 800 series, so padre i think finally showed some mercy.  padre will tell people that i'm better, and if you add and divide, that may be true.  but in the clutchest week of the entire year, to come out and throw 19 of 24 possible strikes, i'd have to say that's pretty f'ing good.  damn padre.  damn

           So this is my first Blog post and after last night I have a lot to get off my chest.         As many of you know, I am an avid video gamer.  I've just spent the last few months tearing into Halo for the second time and having beaten it just a week ago I was feeling very empty and cold on the inside---"gamer's lament". I spent a few days holding my X-Box controller staring at an empty TV screen just kinda hoping something would happen.  Like maybe a new level would magically pop-up.....or maybe Halo 2 would be released 5 months early and my brother would bring it home.... or maybe some space aliens would come down from planet Nintendron and ask me to save a far of world making me an real life intergalactic hero!!!!    To my dismay, none of these things happened....no matter how hard I drank.  But then, while taking a leak a few days ago, I heard a commercial in the other room for Hitman: Contracts and how it was already out in stores.  A light shone down from above and I ran to the car (after my brother got back from work with it 7 hours later - 'grumble'). I've played the first 2 Hitman games and they rank as 2 of my all-time favorites.  Sniper rifles, explicit language and strong sexual content...This was exactly what I was looking for.    This takes us into last night, 2 days and 50 dollars later, when I finally had time to sit down and install it. Or should I say, attempt to install it.  After repeatedly installing and uninstalling the game 5 times, I began to get a little upset. It would claim to have installed, but upon running the game, nothing would happen....i mean nothing!!!! no errors, no blue screen... just a desktop and an unspoken message of "go f@ck yourself" coming from my computer.  So let's go to the Eidos technical support page, where they ask me to type in the error message i received.  Um...yeah...was there a "no message" option....no.  So I navigate the site for a while and finally find another tech support route, where they ask me to explain what component of my computer is causing the problem... hmmm....no idea, let me refer to the error message....oh wait IT DOESN'T EXIST!!!!  Now I'm not a big computer guy, but i'm not a complete idiot so i take a few guesses.  after tooling around for a half hour i randomly come across a link that says "when attempting to run the game, program kicks out to desktop - no error message"  Holy Crap!!! Signs of life...though where was this link when i did a search for "desktop" and "no error message" 45 minutes ago, apparently this was just added to the site since then...but nevermind, i'm close to the end....i think.  So I hit the link and read this....  "the following are a list of possible solutions"  - Install DirectX 9.0                    (did that already)  - Uninstall DirectX 9.0 and reinstall    (um...ok)  - Restart Computer and try again         (shouldn't this be #1)  - Reinstall game                          (way ahead of you pal)  - Uninstall game,restart comp,reinstall     (this seems silly)  - Uninstall game,reinstall DirectX 9.0,reinstall game.(ok, sure)  - Uninstall game, then reinstall  (and this is different how?)      - Uninstall DirectX and game, then restart computer,reinstall     DirectX 9.0 and game                         (Kill me)   - Empty C:Win/Temp folder                   (?????????) - Upgrade sound card drivers for DirectX    (ok, makes sense) - Upgrade video card drivers for DirectX    (again makes sense)  - Upgrade sound card     (so buy a new one? yeah,go f@ck yourself) - Upgrade video card     (why don't I just buy a whole new                           computer...you douche)  The List goes on for pages and pages....with no error message there is no way to narrow it down!!!!  After four hours I finally stumble upon an acceptable solution and after lowering the acceleration on my sound card...the game runs.  Way to go Eidos' streamlined trouble shooting methods, only took 4 hours.  So I sit down to play....very happy, very tired....and on the first mission in the game....most of the wall are SEE-THRU.  Dammit!!!!  Dammit....Dammit....Dammit....Dammit....(in real life i wasn't saying Dammit)  back to the Eidos web page....god save me  I go into the "Gameplay problems" area and navigate to "video problems" after a 15 minute runaround I find an exact description of my problem and a few links to solutions.   The first link is: "Window ME users go here"  hey!!!  I have Windows ME!!! The answer is only one click away and then I can play my precious game....please god let it be over after this.  and it was....  the answer was there....and so was the end....  "This game is not designed for Windows ME" "This site does not support Windows ME users"  and it says that where?  Not on the box...but on the website, after you're soul is destroyed.  About 10 minutes later I spoke to Skiz who informed me that Taco Bell has discontinued the Cheesy Gordita Crunch.  Thanks for the "Coup de Grace" Skiz  Sorry this was so long but imagine what the ordeal was like in person.... F@ck you Eidos!!!!

      Ok so today i didnt have to work (just a meeting) so instead i went at sat waiting for some fools at Pax River who never showed up so i sat there for 3 hours doing nothing.  Then i saw the hottest girl down here i have seen since i been here (about the only girl) and then i looked up and saw Gordon staring at her ass, like while he is talking to some other lady staring at her ass.    So anyways now im sitting in my hotel room watching some old school John Travolta dance movie cause there is nothing else on and im about to...well i just dont know.  But i do plan on avoiding Gordon at all costs.    On another note, Ess Cha i am still your king, biatch, and when i get back im gonna be rolling circles around all you fools, MUHAHAHAHAHAHA.  God help me i need to get out of here.    On yet another note i just wanna let everyone know that me and Ess Cha (i think) are going to be going out hoggin, i mean going out, on Sat night because i need to get wasted bad.    ....For Shizzle...

      i feel dirty.  and i'm not referring to my blatant overuse of ellipses.  get used to it.  no, i feel the need for a three hour shower (man, imagine the prunage) because of blogspot. I was forced to procreate without consent. To create an account I was forced to give life to a poor, unwanted, defenseless blog. I didn't want a blog. Too late.

      There's a new King in town.  Yep, I led off with 5 strikes in a row enroute to a 202 finish.  Ziks put up a decent 166 but couldn't handle my Jersey style.  Yeah, so 4 of the 5 strikes were Jerseys.  For those reading who don't know what a  Jersey Strike  is, it's when the ball crosses over the head pin and hits in the opposite pocket.  Some people also call them  Brooklyn Strikes .  We don't exactly like when that happens, but it counts.  Anyway, I SMOthered Skiz and now we will have to rename that term to the EssCha (or a variation - open to ideas).  i.e I just EssCha'd Skiz...or I just Schwartz'd Skiz...or I just EssChopped Skiz... SMOthering just sounds so good, so we may want to discuss just leaving that term alone.  It's hard enough to get one term to stick so trying to change words around might not work too well.  In related news, Smo moves to the Queen spot with 3 wins and a tie, while JAM slips down to the Jack.  In other related news, Skiz may be bowling 20 games a week this summer...whoa

      So today was the first day of class... Let's first give some background info on this class.  It's taught by a guy who works in another building and teaches for Stevens from time to time (usually at AT&T/Lucent before they went bust).  I dont consider him a professor.  His name is Bud.  The class is called Linear Systems Theory.  Yeah, I have no clue either.  Let me also start out by saying that class is from 1:30pm til 6:30pm (not 7pm as thought previously).  Yes, five hours of funtime.  Let's run thru the first day's lecture(s).  Each class consists of two lectures.  Today, the first lecture had a packet of handouts that was 12 pages + an Appendix.  The second lecture had 11 pages with 3 Appendices. 1:30pm - We wait for Bud to finally finish fiddling with the projector and the screen.  He took about 10 minutes and kept asking us if we could see the text.  Finally, after the 3rd or 4th time asking us, we all answered that we had printed out the notes and he didnt need to even have a projector running.  Moving on....finally.  1:40ish - Lecture 1 starts...  3:00pm - We're only on page 4 and it's been an hour and a half.  Let's do some quick math, we have 5 hours of class and only 20 pages to get thru.   That'd be what, 4 pages an hour, right?  Ok, so were not too far behind...for now.  3:30pm - We finally made it thru the 5th page...that's not a typo...5 pages in 2 hours.  So now we're almost halfway thru the class.  For a few minutes, Nebe and I figured he'd go into "Turbo mode" like our last professor did and skim thru the rest of the 7 pages in 20minutes.  Nope.  It was break time.  Normally, you'd think in a class this long that you'd get about 15 minutes of break, right?  Does this sound like a normal class to you?  We got offered 30minutes, to which I asked if it could be 20 instead.  20 it was...or so I thought.  4:10pm - After Bud plays 20 questions with the class on various topics including: where some of us went to school, what classes we've taken, how many we have left to take, why the sky is blue, etcetera, etcetera we  finally  start Lecture 2.  It was during this extra break time that I did get to throw in some key Lehigh sucks jokes cuz two other guys in the class besides Nebe went to Lehigh and complained about some undergrad prof they had that supposedly sucked at teaching them Z-transforms (Skiz - Z-transforms are just like Java, except it's spelled Jaza).  5:00pm - After 45 minutes of going through way too many examples on the same subject, we move halfway thru the page of deuces.  5:20pm - Page 3 got "Late 360 Shove-it to Boneless'D"  5:40pm - After realizing that he's not as prepared as he thought, Bud decides to stop the lecture early because he doesn't quite understand the mess on the next few pages.  Maybe he didnt think we'd get that far?  I dunno. IT'S OVER!  OK....so that's day 1.  We also found out that there are 6 classes and then an inclass final.  Woot.  On to post-class foolishness... So after class, I had some time to waste before I met Jackie at the train station (she was coming down to go out to dinner).  I decided to go to the gym to see if people were playin ball and to use some facilities.  I parked along the street right out front of the gym where there's a line of parallel cars and the reserved spot for the Commanding General.   I was in the last spot closest to the handicapped spots.  When I was walking out, there was a black toyota highlander truck with two women in it trying to parallel park in a spot two up from mine.  It was quite a sight.  Basically, they were almost perpendicular with the spot.  How they got that way, I have no idea.  It didn't make any sense.  They kept backing up, missing the spot, pulling forward, turning a  tiny tiny  bit and then backing up again.  Repeat.  Yes, I almost stood and watched because they missed the spot 3 times by the time I walked past.  I got in my car and noticed them turning around.  They must have seen me because they immediately cut across traffic and instead of pulling into the handicap spot to wait, they just sat immediately behind me but again, perpendicular to me.  I only had about 2 feet to move out, I did quickly for fears of J-RO flashed before my eyes.  Sorry Jen, but they were so unpredictable, I didn't want them to hit me.  By the way, did I mention that they cut across traffic and almost caused an accident?  Yeah, I heard a horn while I was pulling out.  Nice move, jackass.  So I left and they backed up across traffic again to finally pull into the end spot.  Ridiculous.  What a day...can't wait til next class.

      i can't even tell you how many times i was told not to smoke during my school career.  be it the 5th grade DARE program or my 10th grade health class, someone was always in my ear about putting out the cancer sticks. 'you'll get lung cancer.' 'i KNOW some one with emphysema, and it is a terrible disease.' and yeah, it is.  i can't refute them.  i'm the first one to say that i think it's a disgusting, smelly habit.  every time i see this girl at work light up, i give her a hard time and go through the litany of charges against smoking that i've been told 1,000 times before.  today i saw something worse than smoking though.  i saw decent, average looking, human beings at a meeting.  what was supposed to be an informational session used to get people up to speed on a project turned into a horrifying, 6 hour long confirmation of my most Office Spaceian fears:  these people exist.  when i left school, i knew things were going to be different.  our entire life we have goals and motivating factors pushing us forward.  whether it's trying to figure out how not to crap in your pants or graduating high school (or crapping in your pants while graduating high school), we're all moving towards something.  and then it stops, pretty much without warning.  it is a very cruel sort of thing.  we were told that we would need jobs, and maybe we have them and maybe we don't, but the last part was kind of glazed over.  no one mentioned what happened after work.  i have personally met old people, and not even they could offer me insight.  they say it just sort of happened.  one day they were teaching or making paper towel dispensers, and the next day some schmuck 30 years younger than them was saying, 'i'm sorry, we're moving in a new direction.'  so what happened in between?  i saw it today.  it was horrible.  these people were sitting around a table talking about this project and how it was looking for the next 5-6 years.  they were just throwing these numbers out. 'we're looking a little tight for next year, but in 2 years we should probably get some money.' what?!  what about those two years?  where are they going?  they spoke as if they'd rather just wake up in 2 years having skipped the intervening time so that they could fill out their reports and be happy people. what scared me the most was that i was the only one terrified by this.  to everyone else, it was just another item on the agenda.  a goddamn action item as they'd call it.  no where on the agenda did it say, 'this is the part where we lose track of the fact that we're alive.  from here on, we're just working automatons.'  i even looked on the bak and at the bottom.  nothing.  i don't smoke; i work.  i work 40 hour weeks.  i forfeit 24% of each week to work.  if i kept that up, and worked from 20 until 60, i would have lost 10 years of my life.  and not only will i lose those 10 years, i won't remember what happened during the other 30.  wow.  if i stopped working and started smoking, i think i could cut that down to about 7.  now i know why people smoke:  they're just training for life after work.   sorry for the down note.  on the plus side, i'm up about $5 today.  i feel like i'm starting to play with a little more of a clue.  good job me.  alright, i'm out like the trash on tuesday

      I have noticed that several people are providing extremely relevant titles, and several people are not.  To those of you who are not, I commend you.  If you are one of these "relevant" people I am sure your embarrassed so I will not draw this out.  But a poll of 190 people (and by 190 people I mean inhabitants of room 190) has shown that posting a completely irrelevant title creates interest in your post, basically forcing someone to read what you have written.  I mean when I see something like Troy sucks, not worth the cash, I already know the post.  Come on, we want titles not summaries.  So do us a favor skip to being obscure.   Paid for by the people that keep Rm 190 beautiful

      obviously i'm not the first person to post about this, and i feel bad for rehashing an unoriginal topic, but here's my take on what playing a game of poker with Slipknot would be like:  Dealer:  Action is $2 to guy with mask. Guy with mask:  AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  fold Guy next to him:  life is pain.  fold Other mask guy:  these cards are not sharp enough to cut myself.  fold scary mask dude:  i push my finger into my EYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! fold puss face man:  i hate myself Dealer:  so ... fold? puss face man:    fold small blind guy:  playing this hand will not free the world from oppression.  fold big blind large mouth mask dude:  i raise dealer:  you can't raise. you're the only bet bblmmd:  then i fold.  and so on.   i'm up about $8 or so now, which isn't bad since i've only played .5/1.00.  and i'm out like the entire atlanta braves line up.

      Ok, So when we first all heard about GMail I was sure it was an April Fools Joke. But no, Jam's was right and it's real and here to stay. I never did want an invite, but now, after seeing site like  urlLink Gmail Swap  and how much people are lusting after said accounts, I kinda want one. Hell my original reason for signing up for Blogger a month or two ago was for the off chance I might get one.   Anyhoo, what is the deal with this sort of peer pressure and why are we so susceptable to it. I mean cmon, who Bowled religiously until Ziks started us? How about the group of us joining SWG? (Which SOE Sucks btw, but thats another story) I just don't get it. I'm my own person. I don't feel I have to be like you to feel accepted. But then there I go, doing what others do...It's all kinda lame in a lame kinda way...

      I have come to the realization today that there is not only 1 bowling god, but 2.  There is a more sinister bowling god then any of us have ever dealt with.  His name is Gooter.  Gooter doesn't show his nasty little face all that often, but when he does, watch out, because there is nothing you can do but walk back to your seat and get ready for your next meeting.

      While feasting on Kwong Fat, Hews and I found out where Stew's bowling "Jazz-Hands" came from.  At first, we only found out that Stew took a musicals class in college.  Luckily, it was just a class  about  musicals.  We could have left it at that.  Nope.  Unfortunately for Stew, he took it a step further by letting us know that in high school, he was awarded  "Best Thespian"  for his Tony-award losing work in his school musicals.  Doesn't Conti have Jazz-Hands?  Hopefully they won't team up and try to start a Jazz-Hands club here at work where they try to redo The Producers or Cats or The Lion King....  On a different, yet sort of related subject, I've been giving this bowling term stuff some more thought.  It's not that I suck consistently enough that I could get a shot named after me, but more that I'm so inconsistent that I don't have some quirky shot that always happens to me when I bowl.  I mean really, who bowls a 99,  205 , 132?  A+ for consistency on that one...and by "A+" I mean "F-" I still haven't come up with anything.  I was considering "Ess Cha-oked" but I haven't been in that type of situation too many times.  Not like when the term "Hews'd" was first coined.  The only other thing I could think of was my  Versatility  shot.  No one else does it, so I don't know if it would stick.  Plus, you can't make up your own nickname.  (side note: I think I just got that line from a BK commercial I saw last night - pretty funny commercial actually)  I'll take suggestions cuz all I can think of is something like, "EssCha-tility" Anyway...feel free to comment like I know you will.

      i finally put 5 strikes in a row together tonight.  problem was, the game looked a little something like this:  80 63 7/ X X X X X 80 80  way to make a spare.  actually, in the second game, i let the f word go about as loudly as i've ever done it.  felt so good.  shot a 531, which in any other place would be a disaster, but on the fort, i'll take.  for now.   speaking of bowling, i've decided to bring the rest of the world into the fold as far as our bowling lingo goes.  i figure we've been bowling at lunch for about 6 or 7 months now, every monday and thursday.  after all this time, we've come up with a million terms to describe what happens out there, so for those who don't get to roll with us, here you go:  Stew'd:  this was probably the original.  Stew has a propensity for picking up the 7 pin and then the 10 pin, and only those two pins.  i saw stew do that twice in one game and i told him it was the most amazing thing i'd ever seen.  and just to give you some reference, i've seen the version of transformers where they say, 'shit.'  it's more amazing than that.  so a stew is when you throw two balls and get a 1 both times. Hews:  we have Shawn 'Hews' Mathews to thank for this one.  to spare hews the pain, i won't recount the lurid details of how he became known for throwing a double gutter.  unfortunately though, someone had to be saddled with that shot.  when you see a double gutter, just say you saw a hews. JAM'd:  leave the 7,9 or the 8,10?  not only did you just get boned, you also got JAM'd.  Jamie E. Johnson has been JAM'd his fair share, and one time it just became his shot.  kudos JAM, you're a split. Nebe'd:  Nebe loves throwing the ball right down the middle and leaving something in the middle.  it's one of the things that makes bowling wonderful.  and by wonderful i mean frustrating.  and by frustrating i mean i yelled the f word as loudly as i could because i freaking left a 7 pin when i really could have used a run of strikes to make my series better, but no, that just wasn't possible.   anywise, anytime you throw a ball and you leave pins in the middle, you got nebe'd.  that's just all there is to it. Jen'd:  no one gutters and then spares like jen.  it's the thing she does.  if only this trend could be reversed ... but no.  then we'd have no one to name the shot after. Conti'd:  the most recent development.  you conti when you choke down the stretch.  i'm not sure if conti or hews has the worse bowling debacle tied to his name, but it really doesn't matter. Skiz/Reverse Skiz:  7 pin/10pin.     on a side note, when you try to sell your house to someone with terrible credit who has no business buying a house, we call that Jik'd.  in fact, any sort of real estate scam is know as a jik, or just getting jik'd.  nuff said.  by the way, i'm down about $25 again.

      Another fine day of rolling has come and gone, and another crappy day of score keeping has passed.  If anyone has seen my game let me know because I think I misplaced it from the time I went to Huachuca and now.    In other news, class starts today, and it should be a zinger.  And to think I said I was done with school after college, turns out I was wrong, Uncle Sam has plenty of it lined up to kick my arse for the next couple of years, thanks Sammy Boy.    Hopefully tonight I'll be back with a full report of the great information I learned so that you can share my $2,600 class (might as well for almost $900 a credit you'd figure that this would cover multiple people).

      So, It's Saturday night, Shelly and I have gone to dinner and now she wants to see whats playing at the local CinemaPlex. So we high step it on over to the United Artists theatre. (btw - Nicest theatre ever. Huge screen, billion stadium seats, cushy cushy rocking chairs, padded armrests. Well worth the $8.50 for the experience of a nice theatre, with nice people for once)   Hmm, what to see... Mean Girls...no! 13 Going on 30?... NO! Van Helsing...eh...heard it wasnt so good, soooo no. Oh wait! What is that playing on 3 of the fricken 9 screens?   "TROY"   (I can hear the whipping noises now) It wasn't that bad, if 2.5 hours of a bare-chested Brad Pitt is not bad to you. To me, however, I saw this film the first time, when it was called "Gladiator". The story was ok, Brad Pitt-Anniston played "Achilles" (I'll give a shiny penny to whomever guesses his weakness) and Eric "Hulk" Bana plays his nemises "Hector", the big brother Trojan to wussy little "Paris" played by Orlando "Elf-boy" Bloom. The fight scenes were cool, but i think that BP only knows one move. I saw him use it at least 5 times in one fight. Lots of killing Braveheart/LOTR battle style, but really nothing new here.   I would rate it as "DVD Rental", which falls between the "See it in Theatres" and "Wait till HBO" and way above the "See it on Network Television". If you must require stars that equals *** (***1/2 if you like Brad Pitt's sweaty, bloody, naked chest).  One cool thing they did was have a pre-show that was essentially commercials for upcoming tv shows and movies, but it was better than those stupid slideshow ads. There was also a longer trailer for "The Day After Tomorrow" that I hadn't seen yet. Mmmm disaster movies, I just wanna see that one for the FX, and to see how Spiderman saves the World when Mother Nature is the Enemy.

      so i'm sitting there with nothing.  i mean, nothing.  one of my cards i think is a 5 of Diamonds, and the other card has a Bird illustration on it with a roman numeral C.  i couldn't trade these cards at an Arabian market for an american flag.  but i'm the big blind, so i'm in already.  flop comes out, everybody checks.  so i get to thinking that maybe no one else has anything, and i bet $1 on the next hand.  fold,fold,fold,fold.  i'm a winner. this happens all the time.  people in online poker are scared to bet on anything less than a sure thing, so as soon as someone throws a little action the pot's way, they're folding like london bridge.  what i love about it is that it's a .50/1.00 game.  that means, that the bets are either 50 cents or a dollar.  you can't buy anything for a dollar, besides a game of bowling at the fort.  but these people will just muck if they don't have the nuts.  so let's go over skiz's tips:  1)  if you have any semblance of anything, and people are checking, raise them. 2)  if you have the nuts, and someone is betting, check him.  number 2 is really based on number 1.  people are scared to gamble, despite the fact that they have given people they don't know access to their bank account and social security number, and they will bak away so quickly if they see you raise.  better to let them bet themselves into a corner and raise at the absolute last second.  here are some money totals so far:  bought in for $100 with a 8.9% charge for the instant deposit (-8.90) before today i was holding $73 (-$27) after today i was holding $79 (-$21)  luckily for me, i've played 125 hands, and after that many hands, they're going to throw me $25 dollars in bankroll.  so really, i'm only down the finance charge at this point, plus through another promotion, they're going to ship me 300 free clay chips.  so far, so good.   so what.  time for cards.   BANKROLL:  $120 (approximately)

      okay, so i've played a few hands of poker online.  started low at a .5/1 table, and came out ........ up $.5.  very exciting.  i won a big hand with a straight.  i figure to put in a long session tonight to see how i hold up.  i think i probably need to play about 115 more hands to get my free chips.  rolled a 705 last night en route to a 3-1 victory, putting my team in first by 1 game.  next week we bowl 2nd place in the last match of the season.  better bring out the real stuff next week. current average:  221.something  although i'm envious of JAM and his 170 at the fort.  that shot is no joke.  i mean that.  hardest shot i've ever thrown on.  that shot is like trying to hit jack morris if he were standing on top of bob gibson and throwing a bounceball that was invisible.  i'm serious.  kudos JAM.  i'll be bak on monday to try to hit it again.   i'll post again after the run of hands tonight.  gotta tell you, even over the internet, my heart still gets going when i see those cards ...

      An interesting series of events occurred today, SYS 201a is done (thank god because that sucked) and for the 4th time in 5 days I went to afternoon services (yeah I am pretty religious).  SYS is finally over and there is one great thing about SYS I'd like to say....but I'm not going to lie to you.  Bowling: I may finally be on the road to recovery.  Maybe some background would help here.  Prior to leaving for Ft. Huachuca the lanes and I had an ok relationship, but a little spat broke out and we left things unsettled.  While I was away I tried to call, but just couldn't find the words or the number for that matter, so I have been attending her services basically daily trying to repair the burnt bridges.  Today I didn't bowl a game under 130 (the last few weeks I couldn't say I didn't bowl a game under 105!), and topped out at a 173.  More importantly though I have fallen back into her good graces...  Ask CON and JRO about the mayhem later, it will probably be better than I can type it here.

      So NeTeller finally deposited this morning...Skiz, hopefully, you'll be doing better than the we did last night.  Everytime I got a decent hand (Ace/King suited, King/Jack offsuited, pocket Jacks, etc) I'd get a flop of 2clubs, 4diamonds, 9spades and lose.  Then, when I'd get 4/5 suited or 8/10 suited, I'd get a flop of 2 Kings and a Jack.  WTF is up with that?  Meanwhile, on those two mentioned flops, Ken..errr..the winner would be holding pocket 4s and pocket Jacks, respectively.  Yeah, there's luck involved...but still...I mean really, that was getting ridiculous. JAM has almost completed SYS201...unless the blog decides it's hungry and eats it.  I really don't understand why we are forced to take all this stuff.  I've pretty much forgotten all the stuff on the Firebird ACQ201 already.  PPBES?  Come on now...that's probably the most painful training in the world.  Period. Speaking of pointless training, I got CC'd (not BCC'd) on an email to my boss regarding my upcoming promotion in July 04.  The training coordinator mentioned that I still have 3 different training classes to take (PPBES, ACQ201, and SYS201).  I find it funny that as training coordinator: 1) she had no clue that PPBES is out of stock and not sending books (and even telling people not to continue it) 2) I finished ACQ201 in December 2003 and emailed her to let her know. Way to stay on top of things. Anyway...once the August hits, I'll no longer be an "Intern" not that it will change anything buy my paystub.   urlLink Poker chips , anyone?  I really think I'll wait until I see a sweet deal.  They're all over eBay and 5stardeal.com so I'm not worried about anyone running out.  The deal with Party/Empire Poker is pretty sweet, but then again, you technically are paying $100 for them.  BUT, if you win while playing your 125 hands, you're gettin em for free.  Either that, or I drop about the same amount and get an extra 150 chips.  Hmmmm...such decisions.  By the way, I have a feeling that I'm addicted to Mt Dew.  The problem is that when I get one every afternoon, I wake up immediately.  I'm sorry, but does Code Red flow directly into my blood stream?  Maybe it should.  If I get an invite to Gmail from this blog, I won't be auctioning off the accounts to the highest bidder on eBay...Prices have dropped dramatically since I last checked a few weeks ago.  urlLink eBay Gmail listings

      It seems we all keep coming back, I distinctly remember cursing blog at about this time yesterday for eating my Sys, but I guess it's like Crack...Step on one and god help your mother...or was it the mother of all invention, well good thing either works.    On another front, my motion to move to Blogging in replace of office email has now been jammed.  Based on performance studies it has become evident that the effort/time required to do such an extremely complex task (like loading this web page) is far beyond the capabilities of this network and would ultimately cause the entire network to stop.  In fact I am amazed the internet can house such a beast.

      First night of re-establishing the bankroll and playing some cards.  it's also probably the last game of poker before i throw in on some online poker. anybody remember seeing game 7 of the 1991 world series.  it was twins braves in the first of a long series of braves disappointments, save for 1995 which began the first in a series of indians disappointments.  anywise, morris was a god that evening.  morris threw 10 innings of shutout baseball.  as it is now, coaches pop a huge one when their starter goes 6 and a third and lets up 3 runs.  they had to create a stat called, 'quality starts' that says, 'if you pitch 6 innings (it may even be 5) you get a quality start.'  jack morris spits on that stat.  for jack morris, a quality start is 9 and 0 thirds with a victory.  he won more games in the 80s than any other pitcher, and he was on 3 world series winners. so there i am, like the 91 braves, like lonnie damn smith turning third and holding up thus costing them the game, and i'm trying to hit jack morris at the table tonight.  every hand was a take-a-seat morris fastball.  i kept looking at coach to see if there was going to be a bullpen move, but no.  the heat just kept coming. eventually i actually got a king.  it was kind of like lonnie smith actually.  i even raised right away with that king cause i was desperate.  bam, flop comes and i've got top pair. 'there goes lonnie smith streaking into third' bet, bet, bet. up comes fourth street.  disaster.  an 8 falls, matching up an 8 on the board.  alright, someone could be swinging the 3 8s now, and i look over and see jack morris staring me down.  suddenly the dirt around third starts to swallow me up.  timeout:  if lonnie smith makes that turn on third and comes home, i bet the braves would have won.  that game had so much tension that any little break would have totally broken the other team.  i wasn't even near minnesota at the time, and i was almost broken.  further extending that, let's say the braves win that game and the world series.  who knows how many times they would have won in the 90s.    meanwhile, jack morris has me way in the hole.  for some reason i'm still betting at this point, even though i'm fairly certain i'm going to get smashed by the three 8s.  at this point though, if i forfeit this action, i may be forfeiting the only thing i see all night.  knowing that lesser hands have won, i push some more chips in. fifth street comes, no help to anybody, bet, bet, call.  there comes the 8.  jack morris saunters off the field and gets ready to win another world title.  had we played every hand face up tonight, i would have lost every time.  at least when you can't catch anything, you can't play poorly.  so, from tonight i gathered that i didn't suck, but only because i didn't have the chance to suck.  ess cha was sitting right next to me, which sucked because i hate him.  he couldn't catch anything either, and we both went home $30 lighter.  i got no complaints though, since everything fell my way friday night and led to a $70 take.  Morris was not nearly as impressive in '92 when he was bak in the series with the toronto blue jays.  even the greats can be taken down.  just like poker.    just for a last thought, had to stop at hollywood video tonight to return something, and i was totally disgusted by what i saw.  there were two titles in the new release section:  Living the Life Livin' tha Life  in that very order, left to right.  what disgusted me is that clearly Livin' should precede Living.  are we counting ' as a letter now?  that word stops at 'n'.  i briefly contemplated telling the clerk, but then i found a video called Cheerleading Ninjas, and everything was made right.  a review of said film may follow.

      So I figured I'd recommend to anyone who has seen Mystery Science Theater 3000 to watch a show on ESPN2 called Cheap Seats.  It's quite similar to MST3k except that the shows are all old sporting events.  And by "sporting events" I mean shows like, "Super Jocks and Super Dogs" or "RollerDerby"...and we're talking old school.  Then, these two guys give commentary while they play the show...it's funny stuff.  Highly recommended from Skiz and passed along thru me.

      I decided I wanted to write about baseball news, possibly weekly, possibly as events merit.  Here goes.   Beltran traded; Houston still old  Attempting to make a run at the division crown, Houston acquired Carlos Beltran in a 3 team deal.  When I saw that headline I said, 'what?'  Houston is the following:  old, in 5th place, 7 games out of first.  So they decided to young up the place and attempt to cure conditions 2 and 3 with the addition of Beltran.  Well, good luck Houston.  Your team is still really freaking old, you're not going to be able to afford Beltran for next year, and you gave up relief pitching in the process.  This reminds me of Houston's trade for Randy Johnson several years ago that didn't amount to a) a title or 2) resiging Johnson.  tomfoolery.  my bet is that Beltran is gone by the trade deadline and that things get bak to normal in Houston: old.   Stat of the Week:   With one more homer, Jim Thome will tie Cy Williams for the most homeruns in June by a Philly.  Don't recognize Cy Williams?  That's because he set the record in 1923.  That's a homerun record that's held up for 81 years.  Either the phils are really bad, or Cy was really good.   Time for some local lipservice:  Mets:  Can't seem to stay above .500.  Hey Mets, where were you on the Beltran wagon?  I know you guys like Cameron, but bottom line, Beltran is much better offensively, and defensively he easily stacks up to Cameron.  Wait until Houston realizes they're old and he becomes available.  Phils:  Jim Thome should be the starter in the All-Star game.  Bottom line.  He leads first basemen in HRs, RBI, slugging, and OBPS.  He has had a ridiculous June.  He is a menace.  He is frequently the only Phillies highlight in a somewhat sluggish first half.  Nuff said.  By the way, glad you ran Rolen out of town.  He's not doing anything this year.  Yanks:  Swept the Mets on Sunday for a 2-1 series win.  The next month pits them against Boston twice, Detroit twice, TB twice, and Toronto twice.  Depending upon which TB shows up, this could be an easy month with the possibility of greatly adding to their 5.5 game lead.  Eventually though, I think they're going to need some pitching if they want to make a run, particularly a lefty.

      Have you ever listened to a song, and I mean really listened, not just hum the tune, but really hear the words?  Well most of the times I don't, but when older songs come on (by older I mean songs from the 60s-70s) I try.  On my way into work today I got a chance to really listen, as I had many times before, to a song mainly about nothing, but a certain piece I had heard a thousand times before grabbed my attention.  "Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio, our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you.."  Now I am well aware that this line will ultimately be interpreted as meaning 500 different things, but it got me thinking about the present day New York Yankees.  In advance let me just say that I love the NY Yankees, but it seems to me that with the way the team is "bought" these days instead of "grown" really makes it hard to care about anything but your team winning.  In the early/mid 90s things were different, we had Donnie Baseball, upcoming stars like Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte and a bullpen that got the job done (although not always before giving up a few runs and brining the winning run to the plate).  None of them were superstars yet (and by yet I mean before the season started), in fact the 1996 team that won the world series was really a rag tag bunch of guys that happened to be in the right place at the right time.  Now I am sure I will be attacked by those who say Wade Boggs, Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez, Mariano Duncan (yeah who?), etc are not rag tag players, and you'd be right, but my point is these guys were not superstars, and there were holes in their team.  I mean seriously who played left field for the Yankees that year?  It definitely wasn't the best player in Japan.  Who was their DH?  Does DS ring a bell?  Before the year started who knew what Derek Jeter was going to do?  Would Cone stay healthy?  Would Wade Boggs break a hip?  Who the hell was Scott Kamieniecki?  All unknowns...  They had one great starter in Pettitte, a bunch of Veterans that won more than they lost (but in most cases not much) and a bullpen filled with blue collar guys who could shut down the other team.  When they won the World Series it was a David vs Goliath type victory, especially being down 2-0 and losing game 3 by 6 runs in the 6th.  There was an unbelievable sense of accomplishment around that team.  They had done the impossible.    More recent Yankee teams are bought to win.  The team is filled with superstars, all within the top 10 at their position (except 2nd base this year).  We buy guys like Shef, Hideki, Giambi, Kevin Brown, Mike Mussina, Javier Lopez, Tom Gordon, and A-Rod.  We build teams filled with other teams' superstars.  This is most likely the reason why when someone is struggling it is so easy to say trade him, or to look around the league and think of all the players we could have playing there instead, especially since we know that someone in Yankee-land is thinking it too.  It is unfortunate, that there is no surprise to Yankee fans when their team wins another series, it is simply business as usual.  The ticker tape parade no longer seems anything extraodinary to anyone except the guy forced to clean it up every October.

      i may have had a breakthrough tonight  i sat down to play some .50/1.00 hold 'em tonight.  for the last several weeks, i've stuck to a very strict game plan:  only play the top few hands.  let's examine that.  in texas hold 'em, you are dealt 2 cards.  i play the following hands: AA,KK,QQ,AK,JJ,10s,9s,8s,7s,6s,5s,4s,3s,2s. that's 14 hands which can be generated 94 ways (13 pairs which occur 6 ways, and AK which occurs 16 ways) in a 52 card deck, given two cards, there are 1326 possibilities (52 C 2) that means i play about 7% of the time. 'Isn't that boring?' well, to me, no.  cause when you catch one of those hands, you're fairly confident that someone is going to get smashed, and that you're going to do the smashing.  also, i enjoy the following activities:  1) computer progamming 2) math 3) making my own t-shirts  so playing 7 of 100 hands really doesn't faze me.  anyway, tonight, something happened.  i played computer-like for a bit.  but then i analyzed the table and discovered something:  these people were playing tight, just like myself.  so i changed up and started playing aggressively.  i made moves and stole pots with nothing.  i was in when i should have been, and out when i should have been.   i stole blinds, i pushed people around, and more importantly, i won.  a lot.  i was up 20 big bets in about 20 minutes.  it was the first time i really read a situation and responded.  i left that table because i pushed the last guy all in and won.  there was no one left when i left.  it was radical.  i think i may be on to something here ...  current stats:  $180 after a $100 buy-in and a $25 gift

      I've eaten some sick things in my life... a pig brain, a dead fish on the beach, and a sheep testicle, but 2 year old Easy Mac took the cake.   Every night when I go to my cupboard looking for something to eat... a packet of Easy Mac falls to the counter and teases me with its potential cheesy goodness. But, I don't eat it because of all the Thiamin.   Last night I had to eat something quick to get to the bar in time to catch the end of the Pistons game. Pistons won... and I had to make something "easy". Some food I could "mac" on. Some Easy Mac. I was excited. I was going to eat the Easy Mac.   I opened my cupboard in anticipation waiting for it to fall down to the counter, yet tonight... it stayed put. It sat there and taunted me like a little bitch. A little bitch I would devour.   I snatched it out, emptied the crusty noodle into a bowl, splashed some water in, and nuked. As I kept my face pressed against the leaky microwave I caught a glimpse of the noodle wrapper. I saw what I thought was the serial number and started thinking to myself what a huge dork would understand what that shit actually meant. I mean honestly, how boring of a person would that have to...  BEEP!  I emptied the cheesey pack into the bowl and stirred. It wouldn't be long now. A cloud of cheese powder floated into the air with the toxicity of what I could only guess was that of asbestos. I took my first bite. It didn't taste like easy mac at all. It tasted like Satan.   I ate three more chomps wondering if maybe I just hadn't had the shit in so long my body needed to build up a tolerance. The third bite kind of sat in between my lungs. Almost like there was some sort of problem down below...   I waited for my food tube to push the easy mac down yonder and started looking at the serial number again. Maybe I could decipher it...   "EXPMAR01"   Hmmmm... before I could let the realization of my own stupidity sink in, it felt like I'd been shot in the stomach. I keeled over and stared at my trash can for a couple seconds and as quickly as it came, it went away.   I got up, threw away the easy mac, and ate a sandwich.   The next day I was at the Secretary of State renewing my licesnse plate. I'd taken my number and was sitting in the row of chairs that face the wall, when a little thimble of gas arrived to my rectum. It was a minor disconfort and I was sure nothing would come of it. I put my arm over the chair next to me, lifted my right cheek as I acted like I was looking behind me, and released.   pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffsssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  I hadn't noticed but a small black kid was curled up behind my chair, I had probably just killed half his brain cells. I soon realized that was the least of my worries. I could watch the smell move through the room as people one by one became extremely uncomfortable. I finally smelled it, it smelled like death.   My number was called. I sat motionless deciding on my next move. Would I sit and wait for the smell to leave and then get another number? Or would I give away the culprit. There was no was I was about to sit here for another hour in this room, besides it smelled like shit now.   I walked through the aisles and approached the counter. As I walked through the aisles I heard comments behind me.   "Oh for Christ's sake..."  "Damn, that boy needs a Doctor!"  That one got people laughing.  "Yes, I need to renew my plates."   "Ok sir..." she looked at me with a skeptical look, "here's a pass to leave and come back, you won't even have to wait in line. Go out that door, use the bathroom NEXTDOOR, and come back after you've made sure that won't happen again."  "Yes maam," I'd just gotten a Federal pass because of my ass.   As I walked out I saw the little black kid's eyes roll into the back of his head. He fell over and the mother exploded in agony...   "naw NAW NAAAAWWW!!! MUH BABY BOY!" she turned to look at me, "you did this, cracka!"   "No maam, Thiamin did this. Thiamin."

      Once upon a time, a young man went to the circus. He was very excited, as he lived in western Manitoba and had never seen a circus before; the kind of town where you shave and the trolley stops. Anyway, as circus days drew nigh, the young man grew ever more excited. He arrived before dawn to get the best seat in the house and sat down hours before the first trapeze act.   Finally, the trapeze artists gave an awe-inspiring performance, the elephants danced and the lion tamer tamed. At last, the clowns came out in full regalia and green hair. They rode around by the gross in a purple Volkswagen. The Volksie pulled up to center of the ring and an overweight clown with orange hair, acne and a purple nose advanced to the podium: "Will the person in section A, row Y, seat 42 please stand up?"   The young man looked at his ticket, and to his surprise, he was sitting in that very seat. The young man stood up. The clown then says, "Well-l-l-l-l-l, there's the horse's ass, now where's the rest of the horse?"   The entire crowd burst out into laughter. The young man, dumbfounded, stood for a moment, then made his way quickly through crowd and out of the tent. Returning home, he wept for days, and mourned the loss of dignity and honor.   Eventually reason overcame his grief and the young man grew determined. "I'm not going to get mad, I'm going to get even and avenge the honor of myself, my family, and this town," he exclaimed. He picked up the curriculum guide for the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) correspondence courses and started to read. Eventually  his eyes came to rest on an ad for a class in "Quick Wit Retort."   "Learn how to use those snappy comebacks to your advantage, now!"   So the young man sent in his $19.95 and soon received the course materials. In a few weeks, the young man mastered the materials and sent the final back to UNLV. Much to his surprise, a registered letter arrived from the president of UNLV. It read: "Dear Sir: We are utterly flabbergasted at your performance in Quick Wit Retort 101. We would be most gratified if you could come to UNLV to complete your degree with our fine academic institution. Here's a check to cover your expenses."   To make a long story short, the young man made straight A's in the QWR program. He was awarded numerous distinctions and when he graduated, the graduation speaker, General Colin Powell (U.S. Army, Ret.), awarded the man the Presidential Medal of Outstanding Quick Wit Retort, signed by George W Bush himself! Some days afterward, Harvard University sent a Lear jet to pick the man up for an interview.   The graduate admissions officer didn't mince words. "If you complete our masters/doctoral tenured track program in QWR, you will never have to worry about money again," said he. Needless to say, the young man promptly moved to Cambridge. In five years, the man had finished his doctorate. By this time, the young man was known throughout the world as the leading expert in Quick Wit Retort. Word had even reached western Manitoba, which, of course, made his mother very proud. Everyone from Pentagon pundits to Beltway bandits consulted the man on technical questions of QWR.   One day, while sitting at his desk reading his hometown newspaper, the young man noticed that the circus was coming to his hometown again. An evil smile crossed the young man's face. "Hobbs," cried the man to his assistant, "We must be away to Manitoba. Ready the jet!" As the plane crossed the purple mountains majesty and the fruited plains, the young man savored the moment of victory that was to be his. He arrived at the circus tent very early, making sure to get that very special seat: Section A, Row Y, seat 42.   Finally, the circus began. The trapeze artists gave an awe- inspiring performance, the elephants danced, and the lion tamer tamed. At last, the clowns came out in full regalia and green hair. They rode around by the gross in a purple Volkswagen. The Volksie pulled up to center of the ring and an overweight clown with orange hair, acne, and a purple nose advanced to the podium: "Will the person in section A, row Y, seat 42 please stand up?"   The young man glanced at his ticket. This time he was ready. The clown looks up at him and says, "Well-l-l-l-l, there's the horse's ass, now where's the rest of the horse?"   The young man rose to his feet, full of confidence. He knew from his years of training that there was only one thing he could do. He thrust out his chest and said in the loudest voice you can imagine: "FUCK YOU, CLOWN!!!!"

      Today is a sad day in blogging history.  Today is (or at least was before JiK threw up his  urlLink hell mary ) is the one week anniversary of the nothing.  Now I know that I am at risk of having a semi-relevant title (an occurence which I attempted to  urlLink strike down ) but sometimes you need to cross the line, break down the walls if you will.  The blog was living large and loving life with great hits like " urlLink JiK'd ... hard and fast ... just the way I like it. ."  Life was good.  And then there was the nothing.  A dark, empty, hollow feeling sitting in the pit of your stomach.  I plead for you not to let the nothing take you, not to slip into oblivion, but instead rise to obscurity.  Since some of my thunder has already been stolen by a recent  urlLink thievery  that will be all.

      Ahhh, Andre the Giant, we all miss you so...  Ok, since it's now been one week since the last blog post, I feel the need to sully this page with some random pointless topic. Oh, wait, I guess that'll actually be right in line with everything else here.  I recently read an article about addiction.  The funny thing was that it had nothing to do with drugs, alcohol, porn, etc.  It was about Instant Messaging.  That's right, IM'ing is now on the addictive list.  Turns out most forms of addiction manifest themselves the same way:  Affecting dopamine sensitivity in the brain.  (Dopamine = euphoric adrenaline-like naturally occurring chemical.)  Turns out pleasure is felt when the brain produces dopamine, which binds to pleasure receptors, and then goes away.  Well, just like overeating, or sex, IM'ing creates an instant jolt of dopamine. Another message, another hit.  Another message, etc.  Dopamine receptors sensitize or desensitize themselves when over or under used.  And, that pleasurable dopamine feeling is remembered, and subconsciously desired again.    The result:  certain people can actually develop a (brain chemistry caused) addiction to IM'ing.  You people who've gotten 'addicted' to chat rooms, video games (especially mind-numbing online MMRPG's and MUD'ing), etc., you all know exactly what I'm referring to.  You're brains can't say no... just need one more message... just one more level... just let me... yup, you're addicted. Now we know why people get divorced over EverQuest. Luckily, it isn't a chemical addiction, which means it shouldn't be to hard to break.    Anyway, this concludes today's lesson in Random Topics 101. I'll be available after class if you have a question.  Just don't IM me about it...

      Today was another fine day in never ever land.  There was bowling, eating, spamming, and oh yeah I did do about 20 minutes of actual work (excluding time spent reading the attention grabber "Introduction to Algorithms").    It is really amazing that the blog is still alive and that people from beyond our realm have joined in the fun (albeit to launch an assault, but I'm not pointing fingers).  Now the question I have been pondering is was this person (let's call them anonymous to protect the innocent) a random web junkie who happened to stumble into this mess, or was this a profile browser who decided to click on the site?  I am hoping for the first since that would mean our influence is far more wide spread than I had originally thought.  And a final note Yankees have the best record in baseball and KonTee and I have the best record in bowling, coincidence?  I think not!

      Dear Smarty Jones,  Welcome to the Pantheon of Philadelphia Almosts.  By the bar you'll find John Kruk and Eric Lindros discussing might-have-beens.  Near the television are Ron Hextall and Allen Iverson discussing individual greatness in the face of team collapse.  And perusing our vast library of periodicals from championship losing days are Richie Ashburn, Donovan McNabb, Pelle Lindbergh, Ron Jaworski, and Mitch Williams.  I'm sure you'll feel right at home.  Sincerely, Philadelphia

      wow.  i don't know if anyone noticed, but looks like i got served real hard.  in the comments section of the post, 'on the matter of a recent recentry,' i found a new post by Anonymous.  in it i got served like red leader at the death star.  anonymous, while i appreciate your entry to the blog and invite you to post whenever you please, i'd just ask that you not just recklessly slander me.  you say that you are familiar with the entire situation, and maybe you are, but i find that hard to believe.  had you been, you would have known that when i got the call, i was not by my phone: i was bowling. bowling is like my church, and since jesus never calls me anymore, we all know that you shouldn't bring your phone into church.  by the time i got home from bowling, it was late, and i didn't want to wake any one with a phone call that would require some attention.  that was wednesday. thursday i also attend church, but after giving to the collection plate i left a text message asking if our heroine would be available that evening to talk.  again, it was around 1115, and i didn't want to wake any normal folks who don't consider 3AM a bedtime.  we have since talked and arranged a meeting, so i think that issue is moot.  i was not screening her call.  why would i be doing that?  i asked her to call, and then she did.  i'm also afraid i don't know what you mean by this: 'this means one thing; your disgusting acts of cowardiceness are surfacing themselves, and some of us are beginning to see through...' i have not had some ongoing campaign of torturing this girl. i have not been going behind her bak to find out what she does or where she hangs out. i have not ranted and raved about her for the last year and a half to everyone i could find. (i am in no way saying that our heroine did any of these things.  as far as i know, she hasn't.  that's definitely not her style).  in fact, the only thing i have done is post this blog, which i thought took some guts, but maybe i was wrong.  i took the first step.  that's all.  my other complaint with you, anonymous, is that you call me cowardly, and yet you don't leave your name.  something about that seems inconsistent.  posting your name will not jeopardize your safety.  i will not tell your mom.  i will not tell my mom.  i will not tell my mom to tell your mom.  no moms will be involved.  we are all grown ass folks.  i am glad that you posted and took the side of our heroine.  however, by not leaving your name and presenting inaccuracies, you're not exactly lining our heroine up for the purple heart.  i believe our heroine to be a nice person, and i don't think your post does her justice.  you make it seem as though you are a minion sent to besmirch me in front of my friends.  again, not her style, but how is anyone going to know that?    thanks though, for livening up the blog.  -ziks

      as i was parked on the new jersey turnpike this evening, i began to ponder something:  if i start plowing through cars to get to 7a, will i be charged with double/triple vehicular homicide, or would it be 2/3 counts of vehicular homicide?  truly a question for the ages.  then i began to ponder another question:  what is the worst stretch of road in the united states?  here are my candidates:  1)  NJ Turnpike between 6 and 7a Almost always bakked up, even at 1130PM thursday night when you're coming home from bowling.  Nearly every turnpike accident/disaster happens in this 10 mile stretch, and don't be surprised if it takes you close to 45 minutes to navigate it  2)  Las Vegas Strip Since Las Vegas is always awake, people are always driving somewhere.  Besides Fremont St., they're almost all on the strip heading towards a parking garage or evading police.  Between people trying to run across and gambling depressed motorists swerving in and out, this has to be one of the worst stretches.  nice lights though.  3)  Schulykill 'Expressway' All you need to do for this one is attempt to go anywhere when the phillies, eagles, sixers, or flyers are in town, and you'll see why.  I love the 50 MPH signs that just mock you as you stop and go for miles and miles.  Not so bad around 1AM though.  4)  George Washington Bridge I've been to Connecticut about 5 times.  I've never been over this bridge.  I have, however, seen the people waiting to go over the bridge.  I could not see the bridge at that time.  Nuff said.   Cast your vote, and submit your own.

      maybe someone out there can help me.  why does the radio suck so hard right now?  lemme break down my typical radio experience:  Ch: 1 - Hoobastank - that crappy song we sing Ch: 2 - Tail end of Jessica Simpson - I'm stupid; Hoobastank - that crappy song we sing Ch: 3 - Usher - Yeah; Usher - Yeah Remix (ft. everyone!@1221!); Just Lil John yelling for a while Ch: 4 - Same as channel 3, but delayed 10 minutes Ch: 5 - $88 DOLLARS DOWN!! $88 DOLLARS A MONTH!!!  NO CREDIT IS BA... Ch: 6 - 4 White Kids - We're mad because we're from the middle class and have pretty sweet lives but we're mad anyway; 4 Other White Kids - We know 3 chords  and on and on.  it seems like the only time i like the radio is when they play an old song.  the other day, i heard 'i got 5 on it' on hot97, and i almost wrecked my car.  that song's like 25 years old.  how come that is the highlight of the trip?  when i'm listening to the classic station 20 years from now, am i going to hear 15 clay aiken songs and a bad boy remix to each one?    oh dear.  most of the time i'm left writing this letter to the radio:  dear radio, what is this festering pile of emissions you're transmitting?  regards, skiz   for now, radio, i am boycotting you.  i am tired of being screamed at, whined at, repeated at, ad'd at, etc.  here's hoping you find some other songs lying around to put on.

      just a short, smo-friendly post for now.  bmack, glad to see you still trying to root for the flyers.  i gave up with bobby clarke.  he is way too much man for me.  okay, when did the f*cking skychefs on f*cking airplanes decide that every f*cking person in america loves lettuce.  they gave me a 'thai chicken wrap' in which i found, lettuce, peppers, something that looked like a liver spot, a small thai man, and noodles.  seriously skychefs, did you take a poll and ask everyone if they liked food packed full of crap?  did i miss the poll?  Do you like tons of garbage, to wit lettuce, peppers, and those creepy pseudo onion things, on everything?  1)  yes, i love it! 2)  it's okay, i can eat it 3)  no, i f*cking hate it  good to be bak

      The past few days I have sat and pondered new things to place up on the blog, but came up with nothing.  Today I think I have realized why, I am just not that interesting of a person.  Now don't confuse yourself by saying "Well I am reading this post so maybe he is semi-interesting" we all know this is just not the case, I just intrigued you with a strange title and you had to find out what the hell I meant.  Looking at the blogs recent activity, or lack there of, it seems obvious that the rest of you aren't very interesting either, or at least not on paper.  Perhaps we should all talk to the DAU about setting up some sort of class to remedy this.

      so i've been thinking about poker (surprise).&nbsp; here's a pair of stories for you:  5 of us left in a 10 person sit n go tournament.&nbsp; top 3 cash.&nbsp; i'm hanging in there.&nbsp; i have 500 chips left, which is 4th place.&nbsp; i'd much rather have 2000 chips.&nbsp; so it is.  suddenly, i'm given the opportunity to get some chips.&nbsp; i get KK.&nbsp; the dude in front of me raises.&nbsp; i move my mouse over to the button that says, 'All-in' and hit it.&nbsp; i'm all in.&nbsp; there's nothing like being all in.&nbsp; it is either all done, or all coming your way at the end of this.&nbsp; there is no in between.&nbsp; unless you chop.&nbsp; but who does that.  dude to my left goes all-in.&nbsp; betting comes bak around ot the guy behind me.&nbsp; he sits.&nbsp; we sit.&nbsp; he thinks.&nbsp; we wait.&nbsp; he types in 'AJ'.&nbsp; AJ against my KK ... he's a 2 to 1 dog.&nbsp; he has 3 outs.&nbsp; i have no idea what lefty has, but 2 times out of 3,&nbsp;i beat righty.&nbsp; he calls.&nbsp; cards start coming out.&nbsp; Ace comes on the flop.&nbsp; i lose.&nbsp; so it is.  some joker says, 'good call.'&nbsp; i close my window to prevent damage to my work laptop.   hand 2:&nbsp; four cards are out: 3,2,5,4.&nbsp; two spades two clubs.&nbsp; i'm holding 3,4.&nbsp; this is bad.&nbsp; it's just me and one other guy, and there are only 4 people left in the tournament.&nbsp; he bets 800, which happens to represent my entire stack.&nbsp; i think.&nbsp; he waits.&nbsp; i have 2 pair.&nbsp; i think he has that ace.&nbsp; i know he has that ace.&nbsp; but he could be trying to muscle.&nbsp; no, he has the ace.&nbsp; i see my cursor moving towards the 'call' button.&nbsp; something clicks it.&nbsp; he turns over an ace.&nbsp; a 3 comes on 5th street.&nbsp; i rejoice.&nbsp; i end up 2nd.&nbsp; so it is.  &nbsp;  here's what i was thinking.&nbsp; did that joker who called my kings make a good call?&nbsp; did i make a good call?&nbsp; obviously, the first answer is no.&nbsp; we were both way behind without many options.&nbsp;   but then we won.   so what does that mean?   what i love about hold 'em is that the results of the entire game are established immediately.&nbsp; the cards have already determined the winner before anyone bets.&nbsp; each player then takes a turn screwing up what the cards have decided.&nbsp; countless times the winner is laid down before the flop even because it looks like crap initially.&nbsp; you put down your 9 deuce off suit because it looks like crap, but then 2 2s and a 9 flop.&nbsp; you smack yourself, and the dude next to you buys the pot before you see a 4th card.   supposedly, if you make the 'correct' decision, i.e. the decision the odds favor, consistently over a long period of time, you will end up ahead.&nbsp; so if that guy calls my AJ 3 times, he loses twice.&nbsp; but he won't call it 3 times against KK.&nbsp; he may never do it again.&nbsp; he did it once and won.   in how many other games will you hear this: 'just because you didn't win when you could have doesn't mean you did the wrong thing.'&nbsp; what?&nbsp; there is no other game like that.&nbsp; in baseball, if you have a man on third with 1 out, and you decide to swing for the fences but strike out instead, no one will tell you you did the right thing even though you didn't win.&nbsp; it is in our nature to associate the right thing with victory and the wrong thing with defeat.&nbsp; poker is so counterintuitive.&nbsp; nothing about it makes sense.&nbsp; as i said before, the winner is predetermined.&nbsp; as far as results go, there is nothing you can do to change the fact that you either have the best hand or you don't.&nbsp; somewhere though, everything goes wrong, and some people become better at telling the cards that they are the winner.&nbsp; and that is really something.   i love this game.&nbsp; see you in a week.&nbsp; i'm off to vegas.

      so brendan asked that i post about the no limit tournament i wrote about in my away message, so post i shall.  i had actually been having a bad run at the sit and go tournaments on partypoker.&nbsp; i knew it was going to be rough though, since i had so little experience, so i wasn't afraid to sink most of my winnings into tourney practice.&nbsp; i placed 4th and 5th and 6th countless times (actually, no more than 12 i guess, but still, that's a lot of 10&nbsp;dollars).&nbsp; unfortunately, 4th place isn't good enough to cash.&nbsp; so i had to bak off and play a little bit in the $5 entry fee tournaments.&nbsp; the last few days have brought much more consistent cashing, albeit with lesser returns.&nbsp; but that's okay; a return's a return.&nbsp; monday night i got into a head's up final at the $5 tournament and just got run over.&nbsp; i had no idea what i was doing.&nbsp; seriously, playing heads up is hard for me since i'm kind of tight.&nbsp; i'm looking at hands, and i'm not even considering the fact that the other guy might have even worse cards.&nbsp; so i get crushed, but afterwards i chat with the dude for about 10 minutes on how to play heads up a little better.&nbsp; this is good; one of my better poker qualities is that i have no problem telling someone i'm not good at it and would like help. so i enter another tournament, this time around 215 (which is when you start to wonder if you're addicted).&nbsp; f it, you only live once.&nbsp; i've watched a few guys bust out, i'm down a little, and then some douche starts taking forever to make a move.&nbsp; turns out that douche is actually me, and i've lost my connection.&nbsp; i scramble.&nbsp; i'm on a wireless connection, so i grab a wire and jam it in.&nbsp; no dice.&nbsp; looks like comcast has bounced on me.&nbsp; i have no idea what the tournament policy is on disconnects, so i'm thinking that $5 is gone.&nbsp; more scrambling.&nbsp; comcast comes bak.&nbsp; i've missed about 4 hands, but the game had me on auto post and auto fold.&nbsp; i have no idea what i mucked, but it doesn't matter.&nbsp; i'm bak.&nbsp; i keep playing, catch a couple cards, and eventually i'm heads up with a guy.&nbsp; i proceeded to run him over, just as the last guy had done to me.&nbsp; he's folding against my crap, and i'm loving it.&nbsp; it took a minute for it to sink in when he moved all in and i won, but it was great.&nbsp; granted, i only won $19 all told, but i feel like i've done something.&nbsp; finally.

      According to the MLB's official site these are the Top 10 reasons why it's better to be a fan of the...         Red Sox:    Yankees:     10. The Green Monster  10. American League Pennants: NYY 39, BOS 10    9. Kenmore Square vs. the Bronx,'nuff said   9. World Series titles: NYY 26, BOS 5     8. Seats that aren't 10 miles from the field   8. Last Division Title: NYY 2003, BOS 1995     7. Two words: No-mah's Bet-tah   7. Lifetime Series: NYY 1047 wins, BOS 854     6. The Sox don't need A-Rod to score runs   6. Season series titles since 2000: NYY 4, BOS 0     5. Epstein's younger (and cooler) than Cashman   5. A-Rod plays for: New York     4. Cy Youngs: Pedro 4, Mussina 0   4. Babe Ruth     3. Batting titles since 1999: Bos 4, NY 0   3. Bucky Dent     2. Teddy Ballgame   2. Aaron Boone     1. The chowder's better in Boston   1. 1918        This is probably the most horrible list ever composed.&nbsp; How can you go ahead and make a mockery of Ted Williams like that by putting chowder as the number one reason why Boston is better than NY.&nbsp; And although most of the people alive in this day and age don't know much about history, there were&nbsp;two guys by the names of Carl Yastrzemski and Cy Young that played some time for the BoSox that I heard weren't too bad either.&nbsp; How the hell can you put down Babe Ruth and completely forget about Yaz and Cy!&nbsp; Now I know you are all going to say, but when Ruth was traded that's when everything changed, no shit, that's why they have 1918 there.&nbsp; This poll had to be compiled by either a&nbsp;35 year&nbsp;single guy&nbsp;who listens to too much Joe Buck and&nbsp;Tim McCarver (who both suck by the way, good job Deion in hosing McCarver), or was an actual poll passed around elementry schools in the NY and Boston areas.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The Yankees side I can't argue too much about, but I would like to know how Aaron Boone made it up there.&nbsp; He sucked all year long, had one big hit, and instantly he is changed from goat to god....I don't think so.&nbsp; Somehow I don't understand how Boone can be put up higher than Ruth.&nbsp; Was this list the best reaons to be a Yankee fan in the past 6 months?&nbsp; No, it wasn't.&nbsp; Perhaps I missed the memo that all MLB polls should be crap, that is the only possible explanation.&nbsp; So go New England Clam Chowder....Boston's best attribute.

       Random Rant:   Can anyone tell me why so many people feel the need to protect me from myself?  I mean seriously, I don't know how many more articles  I can read about some crazed mother trying to take away my Jackie Chan Adventures because her kid tried to do a backflip out the 3rd story window of some apartment building.  What ever happened to parental responsibility instead of blaming the tube?    In other news, PHP 5.0 was released this week with some pretty big improvements over the last release (specifically changes to how objects and XML are handled) and only one small step backwards (it doesn't install).  Now I am sure the later is my fault, but when you follow the directions you expect things to work, guess I'll have to try again tonight.    Perhaps the most laughable thing happened in room 190 today when from a dead silence a loud distinct snore was heard from the back of the room.  Now knowing that it could easily have been any of the inhabitants in room 190 (except myself of course) I waited for some extra noise to pin point exactly who the guilty party was.  A few seconds later it came in an "Ooops" from T.J. and that familiar laugh of Jim's.  I would just like to say thank you T.J. you have just made my day, that is of course until I see Jeopardy's Ken Jennings get destroyed.  I hope it's not wrong to hate that guy...

      hews wanted a poker recap, so here's some recent happenings.  i decided to play some no-limit tournaments to get some no-limit experience.  i'm definitely not as good at it as limit (in which i'm no expert either), but it's a lot of fun.  you get a real surge going all in, which you certainly don't get when you call the big blind in a .5/1.00 hand.  format of the tournament is such: 1)  buy-in for $10 + $1 entry fee. b)  every one gets 800 chips iii)  1st - $50, 2nd - $30, 3rd - $20  as can be seen, 4th is just as good as 10th, which is just as good as a girl in a bug touching contest.  i think i entered about 5 tournaments before finally cashing in the 6th.  i felt like i was improving though, since i gradually moved up from 6th place finishes to 4th.  considering this is my first no-limit experience, i'll take it.  all these tournamenting though has put me down a bit, so now i'm hovering around $95 in my account.  i'm just waiting for hews to sign up for party poker and give me 50 extra bones.  that's tournament money right there.  so with one 3rd place in the bank now, i'm going bak.  all in

      Before I start this blog I have one question for the rest of this Blogdom.  Why is it that whenever you are about 5 minutes late and you think you can make it up on the road, someone decides to get into the fast lane and drive .005 mph faster then the person in the slow lane?  Then they think they are going too fast so they hit their brakes, but no one is in front of them.  The left lane should no longer be the fast lane, maybe we can rename it the piss off the rest of the people driving lane.    To be continued after WDT.....

      So, I was trying to log in here to post but it's been so long that I couldn't remember my username/password combo. So I went through my standard three or four usernames, turns out I created a blog back in 2002.  Who knew?    After playing poker for 5 hours last night, and as I sit here watching the first night of WSOP coverage, I just wanted to say... well, ask... is there anything like stacking your chips after winning a big pot?  I love that feeling.

      Watching the NY Boston game tonight I was sure the Yankees would hold the lead when it was 3-0, but when they didn't I was fine.  After all 3-3 with your closer coming in you should feel pretty good.  After NY proceeded to load the bases 3 times (I think anyway) and not score, Boston ground into the first triple play I have seen this year (sure they got Manny out twice but who is counting?), and Manny who has made Tanyon Sturtz his woman his entire career (I mean really who hits 13 for 35 with 7 homeruns and a double?  Who does that?) Tanyon does what....that's right gives up a home run.  With all but the smallest glimmer of hope gone I sat and watched the final half inning.  As Posada came up to the plate I prayed for a base hit or a walk, which I don't think is too much to ask for, instead a strike out.  Up came Clark, again just a simple base hit was all I asked for, instead a ground out to the pitcher (can you say swinging bunt).  Then up comes Big Rube, and I say Big Rube even though with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 9th when alls we needed was a fly ball Sierra struck out on a fastball that had a better chance of hitting the backstop then his bat, but still up he came.  With the strangest swing in baseball history Rube powers a ground ball through the infield for a single.  Now Cairo, with a guy on first, 2 outs and an 2 strike count, hits yet another extra base hit to chase Big Rube all the way home.  I mean Jesus another extra inning?  We already have Shef playing 3rd base what next?  Instead John Flaherty steps to the plate and shows the kiddies how to do it up.  With a single swing of the bat he deposits the ball in the left field corner to score the winning run, ball game over.    There was an interesting development during this game involving Nomar.  I like Nomar which most of you should find strange since I hate Boston.  But Nomar is a classy guy, good hitter, usually solid defender, all around top shelf player.  But where was he when the rest of the team was battling?  On the bench.  Now this may not seem surprising, and you'll probably say he just had the day off, true.  However, how can you stay on the bench when your entire team is hugging the rail, watching the game as if it were October?  Nomar stayed planted on the bench.  This was probably emphasized by the fact that Jeter dove head first into the first row of seats to save a pop ball that would have scored the go ahead run, but instead extended the tie and allowed Jeter to float off the field elated even after his face plant.  Looks like it might be the end of an era in Boston, how soon until Nomar hits the trade block?  Deal with my ramblings and spelling mistakes it's late, and I just saw possibly the best game I have ever seen.  Go Yanks!

      That past few days have been trying ones.  Bowling has gone from bad to horrible and work has decided to basically stop.  Now you'd think the work issue would be a plus but do you have any idea the sort of things you do when you have 9 hours of time on your hands?  I do.  Your day consists of WPC challenges, discussions on the shape of Shaq's bed (thank for that one Smo), a quick visit to the LPA website, an enlightening conversation about peanut stuffed pigs in comparison to peanut flavored peanut stuffed pigs (if you don't know, trust me you don't want to know), how Big 6 could possibly pitch 4783 innings on his way to 373 wins with 2502 strikeouts all in a lifetime shorter than Roger Clemens' tenure with Boston (what is he like 80 now?), and a good amount of this...blogging.  (for anyone interested the WPC puzzles were/are hard as hell, Shaq's bed is circular, yes the dude on the LPA site looks like Mo, peanut stuffed pigs aren't better than peanut flavored peanut stuffed pigs, and sorry but Roger Clemens hasn't died yet).  But the days go on...  On other fronts, www.bornatthezoo.com is active again, and by active I mean someone made a post recently, and by someone I mean me (nothing exciting, maybe soon though).  We are also now out of attorney review and are having the house inspected next Friday (JiK we finally got the disclosure form, the house isn't condemned).

      once on a trip to georgia tech, which bore no fruit in the peach state, we stopped at a wendy's.  it was the fourth of july.  we had been in the car a very long time.  long.  we pulled up to a wendy's to a) visit a bathroom and 2) get some food.  then it started.  chaos.  orders were flying through the car.  no one seemed to know what was going on.  i ended up leaning over my dad and shouting out the orders to the little, circular waitress that lived inside the drive-in box.  she must be a very small woman, but she has a very loud, distorted voice.  anyway, after about a minute of me shouting out orders, my dad was heard to remark: 'this is a disaster.' it was the most broken i've ever heard any person.  the quote still lives in my mind.  it will forever.  as i finished in 3rd in the satellite which rewarded the top 2, i was heard to remark, 'this is a disaster.'  allow me to elaborate.  arm me with harmony.  etc.  in 2nd place with three people left, sitting in the small blind, i get dealt 2 queens.  this is a good hand.  the third place guy is sitting in the big blind, so i raise him with the hope that i'll get a big lead on him, or induce a call and knock him out.  he calls.  he turns over a 5-2 of diamonds.  i rejoice briefly.  but then something catches my eye: a long, conical hat featuring stars and moons.  then i hear that cartoonish chuckle.  alack!  it's fantasia mickey.  and look, here come his dancing brooms!  there is sorcery afoot.  black magic.  wizardy.  i see isaac newton, galileo, and einstein all get up and leave the room.  their ideas are no good here.  he waves his wand once, and a broom jumps up and flops a 5 for my caller.  ah mickey, clearly you don't understand the rules of hold 'em.  he has paired one card, and is still a 4 to 1 underdog.  but then mickey took off his hat, aimed it at the table, and the turn produced a 2.  egads.  this is a disaster.  'ha ha, take that, bitch.'  mickey is a cruel, cruel mouse.  sitting next to mickey was a guy i had knocked out about 5 minutes earlier.  in his infinite wisdom he said, 'good call, i would have called too.'  at that moment i began to look for something sharp.  i wanted to scalp this man and wear him about as a coat.  it seemed like the only logical thing to do.  it would also save him from a lifetime of bad calls.  by the time i had figured out how to take his 38 waist and make it fit my 32 waist, the next hand had already been dealt.  A-K, not suited.  i'm still in, so i push everything i have to the middle of the table.  the big blind calls me with two 2s.  my tournament life has been reduced to a coin flip.  mickey is over trying to pick up some girl, so i like my chances.  the flop comes out and reveals and ace.  salvation!  my tournament continues.  then i hear that music, that dreaded, fantasia sound.  why am i shivering.  oh, it's because a 2 just came on the turn again.  sweet.  i'm eliminated, and it's time to go.  i say good bye to einstein and co., who just shrug.  i no longer believe in math, only santeria.  on a side note, apparently my dad has envisioned me becoming a pro and being a professor on the side, like chris ferguson.  needless to say, i have some sorcery to learn.

      Another morning, another shshen sho frenzy. Day after day I come into this place I like to call "work" but as lil_skiz pointed out not much work transpires. All of us in room 190, except perhaps the newest member of the play pen, are under Master Sho's wicked spell, sometimes not stopping to do even the more remedial tasks required to sustain life, like WDT.  Alas, today is a new day and Master Sho's grip only tightens. Today, however, I vow to end his tyrannical reign! No longer will room 190 be victim to his atrocities.   20 minute pause  Ok, that was probably the weakest rebellion I have ever started. Curse you Master Sho! Perhaps it is best to strike a deal...in fact yes, that is what must be done. Luckily for me deals with the Devil always work out for the best. That being said I have decided to dedicate my time here at "work" to a more novel and worthy project (no offense to Master Sho of course), namely writing a flick (which may be edited to a short series based on the amount of content I can stea....er think of). Anyone care to contribute to the creative works of Room 190 throw it up here and we'll see how things progress

       I always feel bad posting before there has even been one comment made on the post before, but some stories just need to be told. I just went on my hottest poker streak ever. It lasted about 10 minutes, but, man oh man, was it intense! Let me set the scene: I'm here at work, second to last day. I've got a wicked case of senioritis (if that's possible to have at a job). Rather than continuing the one or two projects I need to finish by 5pm tomorrow, I logged on to PokerStars as I (yes, ziks) ate my toasted poppy seed bagel with regular cream cheese. I haven't yet grown the cojones to play for actual money (plus I wouldn't do that at work, what with the interruptions and all), so I'm with the nobodies at the "Play Money" tables. I sit down at a No-Limit 5-10 table. You can bring up to $2000 of the play money you've earned to one of these tables. I bring the full amount. Then I sit down... and I'm going to cut and paste the "chat" log from the PokerStars poker table at which I sat to let you see for yourselves (keep in mind this is between 4 and 5 handed the whole time, and my username is Shazaameter):      Dealer: Shazaameter will be allowed to play after the button   Dealer: Game #593736628: ShylockStyle wins pot (20)      Dealer: Shazaameter has three of a kind, Sevens   Dealer: Game #593736772: Shazaameter wins pot (190) with three of a kind, Sevens      Dealer: Shazaameter has a straight, Eight to Queen   Dealer: Game #593737203: Shazaameter wins pot (150) with a straight, Eight to Queen      Dealer: Shazaameter has a full house, Jacks full of Kings   Dealer: Game #593737557: Shazaameter wins pot (670) with a full house, Jacks full of Kings      Dealer: Shazaameter has a flush, Ace high   Dealer: Game #593738121: Shazaameter wins pot (2510) with a flush, Ace high      Dealer: Shazaameter has two pair, Kings and Fours   Dealer: Game #593739120: Shazaameter wins pot (430) with two pair, Kings and Fours      Dealer: ShylockStyle has a pair of Fours   Dealer: Dutch338 has a pair of Fours - King kicker   Dealer: Game #593739555: Dutch338 wins pot (35) with a pair of Fours      Dealer: Shazaameter has a straight, Nine to King   Dealer: Game #593739936: Shazaameter wins side pot (240) with a straight, Nine to King   Dealer: Mickey116 has two pair, Tens and Nines   Dealer: Game #593739936: Shazaameter wins main pot (3245) with a straight, Nine to King   Mickey116: nh   Shazaameter: ty      Dealer: TFine2989 has high card King   Dealer: Shazaameter has a pair of Queens   Dealer: Game #593740857: Shazaameter wins pot (80) with a pair of Queens      Dealer: Dutch338 will be allowed to play after the button   Dealer: Burnin Touch will be allowed to play after the button   Dealer: Shazaameter has three of a kind, Aces   Dealer: Game #593741127: Shazaameter wins pot (420) with three of a kind, Aces            So, there you have it. Good way to start a day, even if it is "Play Money."

      i need to clear something up.  bagelhands are very different from bagelhammers.  lemme explain.  when hews and i stroll upstairs for a morning bagel, there is a moment of sheer terror that whisks by our earthly selves:  will there be bagels at the bagel station?  for if there are not bagels, we'll simply be jimmy and joey emptyhands, and we'll have to return to our seats without bagels.  this is a terrible start to a day.  usually it takes at least until lunch time for disappointment to set in. our saving grace is to see someone cavorting about the hallways bagelhanded.  that person has a bagel.  and unless it has been brought in from the outside or somehow cultivated within the confines of our engineering building, which i doubt could support hydroponics but could possibly be irrigated, then indeed there are bagels at the bagel station. but i got to thinking ... what if someone who has become bagelhanded forfeits their opportunity for morning hunger slaking and instead continues to be bagelhanded.  maybe they stay bagelhanded throughout the remainder of the day.  maybe two days.  at some point those bagels become stale, and stale leads to hard.  bingo.  that's when you've become bagelhammered. at that point, you're basically a superhero.  you have bagelhammers for hands.  if you're standing in line at your bank, and someone attempts to dynamite your safe deposit box and steal that picture of your cat Horace from when you were five, just start swinging.  bagelhammers will separate foe from consciousness instantly.  most deliciously too.  and since he'll be expecting the lovingly soft embrace of a standard bagel, it'll be that much more shocking when he realizes that he's been clonked with a bagelhammer, a tool that doctor claw would most definitely administer to his MAD agents were he to have enough time and bagels.  so it is of dire consequence that you take great caution when toting bagelhammers about.  keep your hands close, and your bagelhammers closer.

      a brief respite from the vegas report while i go bak to vegas.  that's right.  i'll be out there will lil skiz and the gang for a few.  in the interim ... here's what happened at burger king.  so it's lunch time at BK.  there are a lot of people.  i mean, a lot.  and when i arrive, most of them are waiting for food.  this is a bad sign.  that means that in addition to the time i'll have to wait to place my order, i'm going to have to wait that much longer for food.  it's my only choice at this point though, so i soldier on.  when i get my ticket, which is 78, i hear the guy call out order number 62.  at first i thought that this would just be a long wait, but no, now i know that this will be a very long wait.  like waiting for godot length.  actually, i have no idea how long they waited for godot.  my understanding was that he never showed.  as i'm sitting there, i'm wondering how all these people came to be at this particular burger king at this particular time.  i do this a lot.  but today is very interesting because there is a such a diverse group of people.  i'm fairly certain they are not from outer space.  i look at one of the older folks in the crowd.  he acknowledges me in that sort of, 'hey, i'm not from outer space, but i'm not sure about the rest of this crowd.  they might be.  me, i'm from arkansas, or arizona or some place like that.  i've been in jersey for about 10 years now.  it's okay.  it's not extraordinary or underordinary.  just kind of is.  in fact, i kind of wish one of these people was from outer space.  wouldn't mind hearing about it.  maybe it's the kind of place where a guy like me could retire to.  i could be done waiting in line for crappy ass burgers and sodas and start making progress in the great beyond up there.  always wanted to see neptune.  not them other ones.  just neptune.  it's the only one with any appeal to me.  it's far out there, but not too far.  not pluto far.  i think that would be too far.' suddenly i realize that this old man might be right.  i really am not certain about the rest of these people.  they may all be from outer space.  i figure the probability is high that someone is.  about 20 people here, i'm not and this other dude isn't, that leaves 18.  someone here is a superterrestrial and not fessing up.  when my order gets called, i walk up to the counter and meet the shifty eyes of the burger king lady.  she is not from outer space.  that is an earth look.  and i don't like it.  i'd much rather she be a bubbly extraterrestrial, than a grizzled earthling.  but this is the way of things.

      When you are a little kid, you always have some dream about being something when you grow up. Some of us wanted to be baseball players, bakers, president, GI Joe, or something exciting. I always wanted to be a Ghostbuster. Nobody when they are a little kid dreams about being an engineer and sitting in front of a desk all day doing nothing. And if there is a little kid like that, it is probably because he read to much Stephen King that night and had a nightmare. But that doesn't matter because here we are. Almost everyone reading this is some type of engineer or related field and probably reading this post because they are bored, a very common theme with these jobs. I mean why would you want this job anywho?? The most exciting portion of my day is either checking cnn.com for the 25th time, making sure no new deals have been posted on slickdeals.net, or making sure that some life altering email hasn't arrived in any of the three email accounts I have found ways of accessing despite my company's best efforts. This is a sad thing, because obviously if I have the time today to write this post, it means that none of these things have happened yet. And probably never will. Someone here told me, maybe engineering just isn't the thing for me then. Well how could it be for anyone? If you have a desk job as an engineer, that means that you correct mistakes and oversee other engineers who are actually building things, and not sitting at desks. We watch people do fun things, and do none of it for ourselves. This job has actually given me so much time for boredom, that I have contemplated so many other jobs so many times, that there is no way I will come back again. And that is why I invite you to join my quest to build Skiz's Glenside Lanes. Open invite right now to invest in company sure to boom. I know that older skiz has lured many of you to his place of worship on multiple occasions this year, and that you have learned the gods of this sport can be very confusing at times. But imagine owning a temple of your own to worship at. Those gods would have to be more forgiving at that point... right? So, who wants in? I'll send out more plans later perhaps, but right now I just got busy. The front page of CNN just changed, I got an email, and lunch is closing in. Busiest time of the day.

      my pants are vibrating.  something is happening.  perhaps an illness.  no, it is moles.  he is utilizing his cellular telephone device.  he is in las vegas.  i'll answer him. 'hello' seemed like the right thing to say.  sometime later after being battered with hacking knowledge (my legitimate purpose in las vegas) i return home and find my associate.  we shake hands.  it's what people do.  it's how you spread disease. seemed like the right thing to do.  armed with some winnings, one moles, and one smo, we venture into the world for some dinner.  it is about that time.  although in certain parts of the world it is breakfast time.  some people are asleep.  they would not be interested in dinner.  we were. seemed like the right time to eat.  la salsa cantina beckons us.  they offer very large glasses of alcohol.  they only asked for $17.50 in return.  we pass.  smaller quantities are purchased.  pidel brings us food.  his name is not fidel.  that is important.  his parents have decided. seemed like the right name to give.  we are coming bak, but not unscathed.  moles has purchased a fifth of whiskey.  a fifth is one fifth of one gallon.  we do not purchase a gallon.  that is a good idea.  some whiskey is consumed.  smo should give himself a fu manchu.  his face demands it.  to a lesser extent, we demand it.  it is now a good time to gamble.  we play blackjack.  moles is winning.  moles has won bak the money he spent on the fifth, which is not a gallon but still a lot.  there is some left.  we celebrate moles' victory by drinking the rest of it.  mostly. seemed like the right time to drink.  my left foot and right foot are no longer speaking.  they are having a tough time deciding who should go first.  on occasion, they both take off, and there is a forward sensation followed by a reverse correction.  we slow down.  now they wait to hear, 'mother may i?'  it is a game they play.  i have to sit down.  i sit down at a blackjack table.  a young lady deals me some cards.  i win.  she high fives me.  this continues to happen.  i have won approximately $150 at this point.  we retire to bed. seemed like the right time for bed.

      They say that in order to get better at anything in life....you have to jump right in and do it....  Now I love playing poker....it's not about money or even the satisfaction of winning.  Those are the bonuses but I love the game.   I've been playing tons of online poker, reading a few books and articles on poker strategy, and holding weekly friendly games at my house.  But I'd never played poker at a casino against a group of strangers that can see my face and read my style.   So when I walked into the poker room at Harrah's Las Vegas for the first time and bought my first rack of 100 one dollar blue chips, I all but kissed each one goodbye before I sat down.  The rest of the night was a blur of gin and tonics, constantly changing players, dealers cycling through over and over again..... the only thing that stayed fixed was me.... at table 9.... corner seat.... across from the dealers left shoulder.  This was a night of learning, I wasn't expecting to win so I wasn't planning on going up a bit and then running off with winnings.  I wanted to play a lot of hands and see a lot of different  players at the table.   Skiz and Schwartz  left at some point in the early morning, bidding me good luck, which I surely needed.  I had gone up early and kept telling myself that if I get back down to even, I'd stop and go to bed.  When we had started playing, I had already been up for 16 hours.  Flew in that morning, no sleep on the plane (damn you Denzel Washington and your great acting!!!!), roulette for a couple of hours, drinking with the group for a while, then the poker room.  As hour after hour past I kept raising my "go to bed" limit higher and higher.   Leave at +$50....leave at +$100.....  Finally, this dealer Xiu Li sits down at my table for the 10th time of the night.  She was very soft spoken and very sweet.  We had played many hands together over the night.  As she dealt the first hand out, she leaned over the table and quietly pleaded "John, go to bed. It's past noon".  Holy Crap! I had spent 13 hours at the tables.  I'd been awake for 32 hours straight and I was very drunk.  Time had flown and I had to leave.  I cashed out for $240 on my $100 buy in.  Not a bad start at all.  The second night didn't start til around midnight (granted only 12 hours later)  I had caught a quick nap for like 3 hours, then hung out with the guys all day.  Skiz suggested poker at midnight, and suddenly there I was again.  I was very hung over and destined to lose, considering the last night's good fortune.   I walked in and a handful of players immediatedly acknowledged me....calling out my various nicknames from the night before "Hey, Kid Jersey!" or "Yo, Atari!" (my previos night's T-shirt) or "It's Johnny T&T!" (my drink Tanqueray and Tonic).    I had realized that the night before I played very sociably....talking to everyone, commenting on lots of hands, making jokes about almost everything, making a lot of friends. This isn't how you play good poker at all, right?  You have to hide your emotions and play with your head.  Focus on other people and what they do.  Concentrate.  I decided to play this night serious and sober....very quiet, sit like a statue, give away nothing.  Besides I was too hung over to be as upbeat as last evening.  I dropped 100 bucks in the first hour.  Everything went wrong.  I bet the right hands, I layed down at the right moments, nothing was working.  I bought in for a second rack of 100 and lost half of it soon after.  I started to think that casino poker really wasn't my game and my luck (and that's all that last night was) may have run out.  If I play here a few more nights I'll be down a ton of money.  Maybe I don't belong here and I should keep my gameplay in my house or online in my room.  Things were pretty bleak.  Enter Joe, the dealer from China, who I called "Big Brother".  I gave him that nickname because of how well we hit it off and simply, he shares my older brother's name.  After losing a big hand at his table he looked at me and said "John, you're not yourself tonight at all.  Uptight doesn't work for you."  I laughed for a moment and thought about the comment.  He was right.  I wasn't having as much fun.  This game seemed more like work and I was failing.  I quickly re-introduced myself to the table, making a joke that Joe had just woken me up.  Then I ordered a gin and tonic saying that I was like Pop-Eye and Gin was my spinach.   The rest of the night I played like myself.  Talking all the time, laughing at the tough breaks.  It was fun as hell.  I met a few dozen new people and replayed many from the night before.  I learned everybody's name, where they were from, what they did for a living.  People from almost every state and every walk of life.  I even got a new nickname off the T-shirt I was wearing.  At 9am as I was walking up to cash out for the night, the floor boss shook my hand and said "See you tomorrow Harvard?".  I looked down at the 5 racks of chips in my arms ($500 total).   Then I looked back at the rooms where a bunch of hands shot up for a last wave goodbye.   Joe was just sitting there smiling.  "Are you kidding me?", I said, "This is where I belong."  I love playing poker....it's not about money or even the satisfaction of winning.  Those are bonuses but I love the game.

      Day 1 so i'm ahead on this table about $125. this is better than expected, but would be the only day i was actually ahead in poker. the game in vegas is a savage, discovery channel, meat tearing run at the pot where nothing is held bak and everything is played. you cannot bluff away a lion's lunch, and such is the case in the wild of las vegas. if you were not carrying the absolute best hand (which is predetermined despite what some yankees fans might tell you), then you should take a seat and see if the pack leaves any entrails. i was the one leaving the entrails on day one. i should have saved them for later days. bet, check, bet, raise, fold. 'sorry ma'am, no offense.' 'ma'am? ma'am?! do i really look that old.' the scorer records an error on the third baseman. i've thrown the ball into the grandstands. 1) this girl is not old. b) she has tickled my optic nerves i hate reeling. but here i am, reeling. i apologize several times. i mention that i am a slight man and that i've had 4 miller lites. bet, check, bet, rake in. bet, she folds. 'good lay down.' (this means, you folded when you should have folded, thus saving you money). 'you and me would never make a good lay down.' and then she winks. when ms. heriot explained the DBQ section of the AP history test to me, i never thought i would ever apply it to real life. here's a question, here are documents. use these to answer this. unfortunately, my question was about gonorrhea in the french and indian war, and the documents were scrawled on papyrus. no sense could be made of them. this DBQ was harder. Question: 'should i say something to this girl?' Document 1: Author: that girl Title: what she said to you Body: 'you and me would never make a good lay down.' Document 2: Author: that girl Title: the thing she did after her ambiguous quip Body: &lt;wink&gt; and where in one situation i parlayed my knowledge of syphillis amongst fur traders into 6 college credits, i had no such luck in this situation, and was forced to retake girls 101, girls 102, and generally fucking things up 307 (prereq is a seminar about crystal pepsi, which i passed out of). nicely done. i retired to my room. i am left to watch a documentary on giraffes. they frolic. i ponder the giraffe. he is merry. his neck is long. he can eat fruit from even a tall tree. i cannot do this. giraffes needn't take DBQs. they have many advantages. when i grow up, i will be a giraffe. but not a swan. they have long necks but are stupid.
