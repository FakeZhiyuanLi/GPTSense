						   As part of my coursework I have to cover topics based on cultural diversity and the efforts to be made to make everyone comfortable,merge all the differences at the same time help each other to relate to their culture and heritage.    Now I was just wondering about the diverse cultures we have back in India. The different religions and the different castes. The different languages and the dialects.The different physicial features and etc.. etc.. Of course the one thing which unifies all is that we are of the same race.Now, what comes into my mind is that we never had a class wherein we are taught about our diversity, how to cope up with the tamil language when you go to Chennai(it's really hard to survive if you didn't understand Tamil),how to relate yourself to the Indians from the eastern part(Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh etc..) and how should you mingle with a parent who is of different religion.(No offense on the regions or religions I mentioned please..I just wanted to make my point clear.)   Moreover we never fail to associate with our family background and culture and our language and dialects.It seems we have a natural tendency to adjust ourselves according to the situations and diverse cultures. Now my question is that if we are far more efficient in amalgamating everything and are far more efficient in merging our differences why do we still have the class and religious feuds? Why do we still have riots and curfews?

						   It seems that Americans luv to label everyone and anyone. Based on the race, based on the ethnicity, based on the place you live, based on your area of weakness; you named it and there is a word for it.But why? In no way does it make one's life easy. It just complicates the lives of people and of course attaches a sort of biased or stereotypical attitude towards it. In case your child doesn't mingle with anyone then he might be an autistic, in case he finds difficult to concentrate then he/she has ADD( attention deficit disorder). Well,if the person has problems in working on their stuff then learning disabled, if the person is unable to talk freely with others then anxiety problem.Oh God. I am fed up of coming across these labels.  As time passes by they just get embedded in the colloqiual language and are used so commonly that they become a cliche. Ulitmately the salad bowl starts looking like a trash can wherein you find all the differences in an ugly way rather than in a healthy way.Of course agreed that associating a person to a certain condition or a group surely helps in understanding the person more better but most often it only serves as a tool to create more chaos and inferior feeling. Just like the invention of atom bomb which was actually created to know the benefits of nuclear fission and fusion but is used for destructive purposes the same is with labeling.  This is nothing to do with labelling but more to do with human nature. How the humans try to ease out things and then complicate it further:). Sounds funny but true.

						   One of the eminent psychologist whose findings and theories were ignored till recently. It is quite suprising because his writings and his findings have more practical implications in today's world. Thus he was way ahead of his time.In his book "Thought and Language" he emphasize on the role culture and language plays in improving the brain connections and the functioning fo the brain. According to him "the zone of proximal development" keeps increasing as we expose the growing human to various things in the surroundings which builds the connections and thus the memory.  Well this is just a small description about him and his work. You can find more on the sites: urlLink http://tip.psychology.org/vygotsky.html   urlLink http://www.kolar.org/vygotsky/

						   Hmm, So at last getting into the virtual world and creating a space of my own.This blog of mine would be somewhat dry or may be intellectually stimulating maybe following the vygotskian principles and much to do with education and educating.  Many other issues will also be covered which might be intellectually stimulating and sleep inducing:). However as my thought process develops it will be exciting as it will mirror my thouhgts my perception towards the happennings and would also contribute to my intellectual enlightenment.

						    The summer course on reading has made me feel enthusiastic about readign again. After a very long time I have started to enjoy reading.   Well, reading was just a hobby for me and I never liked to stick to books all the time. For that matter never like to do anything at a stretch.  But somehow I am improving my reading and analysing skills through this class.  Was just wondering about my school years and the books I read. Frankly speaking,during my school years I used to spend very little time reading. But that little time was spent reading champaks( I luved the illustrations) some old chandamamas which my Mom had collected from the time we were too young to read. Other than that I luved browsing through the magazines my father bought. And of course "WISDOM" was a real good book. I luved to read it and it for sure enhanced my general knowledge and my thinking.   As I had an elder sister I did not have to worry about buying or borrowing books for the coming year.As she graduated to a higer class all her text books were mine.And during those times we had very interesting stories for our supplementary books and texts. So most of the time I used to read my text books ahead of time( well not the text but the supplementary texts which had very interesting stories by various Indian and international authors).  It was again a sort of peer pressure( or rather jealousy or maybe sibling pressure:)). My sister used to use the context of these stories which she had for her class and I used to feel j. And then as soon as I could grab them I used to read them and boast that even I knew Trojan war and Don Quixote.I wanted to be ahead of her or rather tried to oversmart her but was never successful:).   However, I am glad to have read all those books in my formative years which contributed a lot in improving my vocabulary, my creativity and my memory( I still remember them:).In fact the best part of my supplementray texts were the biographies of the authors.I now feel that those biographies had influenced me to a great extent. In fact they have developed my inquisitveness to relate a person's background to his achievements.I learnt a lot from them and had a crush on quite a few:).     We had a lot many stories written by some of the famous Indian authors and Premchand was my favourite. I really liked his stories. They almost often spoke of the struggles of the people in those times.Well, somehow I had a crush on Premchand at that point of time and liked all of his stories which I read. I also liked  "Macbeth", "As you like it" and " The merchant of Venice"  by Shakesphere. Leo Tolstoy was another favourite author of mine.  However the most favoruite books of mine were those written by ENID BLYTON. I loved to read her books. They were all fantasy stories wherein the trees could grow candies:) and the town always had some or the other festival of some sort.  The charachters were very funny and interesting.There were gnomes, pygmies and  what not. I just can't remember any now. But I used to love reading those books. Her stories always an interesting end with a moral.  Thus a part of my childhood was spent in reading some real interesting stuff. But I just can't remember as to when I stopped enjoying reading. Could be somewhere in the seventh standard when the fear of board exams were induced in me. However, it's always nice to think back and remember those times especially when I have to read similar stuff for my student. Needless to say I enjoy reading them even now and wish my text books were as interesting as the Enid Blyton and the Munshi Premchand stories:).

						   "Oh really"? The comment left me thinking and pondering over what she really meant? In fact I have a habit of writing everything in a detailed and desciptive way. Most of my papers and assignments are very lengthy and very detailed or "wordy". But what does it tell the reader about my personality?  Well,Courtney was suprised by the length of my lesson plans and when she showed it to Heather who happens to be my friend, she gave a very brief and postive(?)remark "It's a part of her personality. She tries to explain every small thing in detail", she said.I was a bit taken back. Of course was suprised that she knew me so well.But?.....  Hmm..so did she mean that I am very descriptive even when I talk?And how does it reflect on my personality?   I was in fact pondering over the same topic this morning. But I have a different explanation to give.Well,I do believe that our academics and our work refelcts our personality but to a great extent there are factors which influence us to behave in a certain way or work in a certain way( may be I am supporting Watson's behaviorism and Skinner's conditioning theory now.They seem to be emebdded in every life experience for me).Thus to completely attribute my lengthy and descriptive work to my personality would be a bias.   Well, I believe  I am more descriptive because of the type of education system I was exposed to all through these years till I landed up in the US.Through out my school and college years I was supposed to be as descriptive as possible.( Five marks answers at least two pages, 10 marks answers at least 5 pages). And after getting out of the examination hall  the focus of our discussion would naturally be on our performance and also on who took the maximum number of additionals:).It was used to compare each  other's performance and also predict their sucess in the exam.Well,no discrimination between the arts and sciences again. I was a science student and still was expected to be as descriptive as possible in my answers.   So you see It is not a part of my personality but the style of writing I had cultivated.Well,I do have  some more proof to justify my say.During my proctoring sessions I am supposed to invigilate the examinations.Even this time is spent in observations and most of the time in preparing for my assignments.   Though I did it unintentionally I was suprised when I went through the answer sheets of the biostatistics students from India and America.When both the Indian and the American students took the bio stats exam, the Indian students took more time to complete the test and were also more descriptive in their answers.Most of the Indian students used pens while the Americans used pencils. Thus after collecting their papers and sneaking and peeping through them I felt I wasn't alone.   And I have another strong reason to justify my style to the education system I am exposed.One of these days an american desi had taken the test.(It was hard to know if he was of Indian origin. He rather looked like a Latin American at some point and a tanned white American at another. But still he had some faint features of an Indian.However his name which had an Indian middle name solved the puzzle).  Well, as I had expected this guy took the test in bio statistics and used a pencil and was less descriptive.So my analogies and my analyzing skills helped me to justify my style but is there something to do with my personality? What did Heather  actually mean?   Though not a big issue I am still trying to analyze what she meant.

						   Well everything seems to be perfect today. The climate I mean. It is cool, drizzling and very cosy. Somehow am feeling very romantic and poetic. Thought of sharing some of my favourite poems. The one by Rudyard kipling is my favorite. It reminds me of Sri Krishna in " THE BHAGAVADGITA" wherein he tries to explain Arjuna the essence of a well balanced person or a "sthithapragnya". I can very well relate to the readings from  "The  GITA" to this poem by Rudyard Kipling ..... Very inspiring and enlightening.       IF        By Rudyard Kipling  If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:  If you can dream - and not make dreams your master, If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!   Kipling is said to have written the poem 'If' with Dr Leander Starr Jameson in mind, who led about five-hundred of his countrymen in a failed raid against the Boers, in southern Africa. The 'Jameson Raid' was later considered a major factor in starting the Boer War (1899-1902).  Courtesy:  urlLink www.businessballs.com/ifpoemrudyardkipling.htm   My other favourite poem is by Robert Frost. This one is known by many But I remember reading it as part of my English text. I really liked it and now feel like reading it again.     The Road Not Taken                     by Robert Frost       TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,   And sorry I could not travel both   And be one traveler, long I stood   And looked down one as far as I could   To where it bent in the undergrowth;              Then took the other, as just as fair,   And having perhaps the better claim,   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   Though as for that the passing there   Had worn them really about the same,              And both that morning equally lay   In leaves no step had trodden black.   Oh, I kept the first for another day!   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   I doubted if I should ever come back.             I shall be telling this with a sigh   Somewhere ages and ages hence:   Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—   I took the one less traveled by,   And that has made all the difference.                courtesy: urlLink http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html

						   We write,read and work on the stuff necessary to either complete our coursework or to do with our work.As we keep growing or learning and progressing through our careers and academic struggles, each one of us develops his/her own pattern of doing things.This aids or influences the way we think, the way we analyze, strategies we use for problem solving, organizing, proioritizing and planning our goals, developing our interests and fostering them etc.. etc.. through imitation and sometimes modelling them to help others.The methods of learning and the surroundings influence the individual and contribute to the  evolution of the person. Hence no one person is in any way similar to another.   But.... we do need to know the best ways to function productively in the environment we live.This means to adapt, folow and function according to the rules of the society(Darwin's theory of " The survival of the fittest" is still valid).  Education plays a major role in shaping the individual. In a way  the term "education" is a very broad one and every person differs in their perspective. However the end result is always enlightening and improving oneself.  So the methods/ strategies used to help students gain knowledge should be practical enough. They should be able to apply the knowledge and the skills to develop their analytical skills, problem solving skills, organizing and analyzing in a genrealized way( here "generalised" means able to apply one's knowledge in different situations using the same strategy).  Ok so the gist of the whole story or the gyan of the day is to have a practical approach towards the strategies used in teaching. Cos our reading and learning habits have a great influence on our lifestyles too.

						   So I am a reading clinician for the next four weeks. It's a nice way to interact with kids and help them to read. Especially the struggling readers.How I wish we had something of this kind in India. Well, yes may be very soon I can start something:). However, I often feel that the way we read or the way we are taught to read is faulty. In fact a person who is a good reader( not quantitatively  but qualitatively)is more successful in his academic pursuits than otherwise. In fact good reading strategies should be taught right from the kindergarten which enrich the child's brain with all the right literature and the thinking process. Reading surely helps build analyzing skills, problem solving skills and of course comprehension. All these factors are very much needed in every activity we are involved in.   So when we are reading, there should be a method to be followed.In fact most of the fluent readers do follow all these rules or the structure of reading. Well,for the adults or the fluent readers the SQ3R method ( Survey, Question, Read,Recite and Review method) really helps.  urlLink http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/sq3r.html  gives you an idea of this method.  Ok and now coming to the emergent readers, well the kids in their formative years have to be motivated in a better way to enjoy and love reading. This can be done by choosing the material appropriate to their interest level, their ability and also the level they need to achieve. Discussing the title and trying to predict what the story is will initiate more interest and motivate them to read. Picture walk, wherein they are made to look through the various pictures and try to frame the story based on the pictures will help them to draw some more information about the story. And then while reading there should be pauses or stops wherein the child has to stop reading and then reflect back to what they read. And then questions such as what might happen next, and questions which are inferential can elicit the information and improve their comprehension.  In a similar way the texts or the books chosen for begginning readers, transition readers and fluent readers cover similar aspects based on their level.Thus the same rules applies based on the level of the reader.

						   It's been quite some time since I blogged in and wrote something. Well,wanted to get into some serious stuff but will be writing on it after I am done with my summer class. Proffessional knowledge would be more beneficial than my experience in this situation. However, I am just enjoying some change around me. Feels like I am in India now. It's so hot. 99F and scorching heat. But the best part is the beautiful flowers and plants which bloom all over the place. They make the whole summer look so beautiful. Well, had been to the Mormontrek heritage festival.Not a great thing happening around but it was kinda interesting. Well, in case you didn't know anything about Mormons, they were the first pilgrim fathers or the Europeans who travelled in handcarts to settle at different places in the United states.  The whole last week was a busy one attending classes and working at the International center. Well, a part of the activities of the summer clinic was to introduce oneself to the whole class. And the way it was done was quite interesting and funny. Each person was told to say something about themselves and then were asked to share three artifacts which they cherished the most. It was funny for me cos sharing three or more artifacts or something about themselves would hardly give a glance into that person's personality. Any way each one brought their stuff to school and showed them to the class. The interesting thing was that almost 80-89% of the class brought the pictures of their husbands/boyfriends/girlfriends/family members,football or something to do with the ball games, books they like to read/are reading and of course the T-shirts to represent the school or the place where they work. Well, so it seemed that almost all of them had the same tastes or things they think of to share.   However I was no different but I tried to be different( this is what I always try to be). I am not a great fan of cricket or a ny ball game nor do I have a family. Well, I would luv to share the pics of my parents and my siblings but I had none. So was wondering what could I take to the class to show everyone. Well, I remembered that I had carried my hat which was gifted by this girl from Mizoram. During my visit to Delhi we became very good friends and on the last day she left a straw hat for me as a rememberance. I had carried it all over ot the US with me. Though I never used the hat often it was something I really liked, so I carried it with me. Well, I had my diary which was quite old but it is important as I share my apprehensions, my excited moments and some real important introspections and happenings in my life. In fact everything I write in it will give the reader an analysis of what was going on at different periods of time. And then what more.... hmm yes, I have the habit of collecting flowers and leaves unique to a certain place. Well I did have some which I had pressed and kept in my book so decided to take them . And then I had my T-shirt which was gifted to me for tutoring undergrad students in psychology. So here I was with more than three artifacts to share with the class:).  Of course thus tried to be unique in my own way.But do u think it really did tell something about me to the class? No way. I am more than what I tried to show to the class. Well, I feel everyone was something else than what their artifacts spoke.Of course their artifacts did represent something about them but for sure didn't give a true picture of the person. Now I can't understand as to why I am so bothered about the true identity of each and everyone.But I was just wondering as to why everyone one thinks in a similar way or for that matter why do we differ. Sounds puzzling but .....ok now if I start again then I will be talking about the cultural diversity and stuff like that. It's late in the night and I will stop here.

						    After experiencing a lot of change in me I now believe that we are what we wanted to be and we will be what we want to be.     &nbsp;   Every person has his own pattern of thoughts influenced by so many things around him. The environment, the role models&nbsp; who influence him, his experiences in life , all of them &nbsp;mold his character to a great extent.  Especially when he admires certain things and is unable to fulfill them , the&nbsp;strong desire to achieve that particualr thing enters&nbsp;the subconsicous level. As time passes by , through various experiences, or through various encounters, these feelings or cravings get strengthended, faded or modified . Without the knowledge the individual works to achieve what he wanted to and finds himself &nbsp;in the very state he once dreamt of.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I&nbsp; was very surprised&nbsp; to find&nbsp; myself in the same situation I once dreamt of. Right from my food habits, my dressing, my preferences&nbsp;, everything&nbsp;is&nbsp; almost similar to&nbsp; what I always wanted to have.&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;is &nbsp;amazing to discover&nbsp;the&nbsp; change in me, especially when you try to step five years&nbsp;behind .  &nbsp;  Our dormant thoughts are constantly in action trying to achieve waht we aspire for, what we dream for, what we desire for. The positives consequences reinforce our&nbsp; motives while the negatives can have a drastic effect on us. The person can compromise and move to another destination or it may give the person&nbsp; reseliance to achieve what he wants to.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;And the ultimatum is the result of the struggles and the processing which goes together.  &nbsp;  So it's always good to dream about something which you want to achieve, cos the moment you dream, your subconscious is activated which influences your conscious efforts to achieve your goal.And in case you fail in&nbsp; getting what you dreamt of, believe me it was not worth your effort. You deserved something better or different:).

						   Wel, most often I come across very inquisitive and eager minds who want to know a lot about India and our customs. Especially most of them questioned about the significance of bindi.To save my head I did tell them about it's significance which I read when I very young in a monthly book called Wisdom. HoweverI wanted to just check if I was right. To my amazement( or rather dissapointment?) none of my Indian friends knew the answers. So I decided to probe and find out the reason. I found this very interesting article which made me feel proud about our ancestors. They indeed had a very scientific approach for everything.   Bindi is derived from the Sanskrit word "Bindu" or a drop, it is supposed to signify the mystic third eye of a person and therefore, when properly marked, becomes the central point of the base of the creation itself. It is a symbol of auspiciousness, good fortune and festivity.  Why Bindi? The very positioning of the bindi is significant. The area between the eyebrows is the seat of latent wisdom. This area is known as the "Agna" (6th chakra) meaning "command". It is said to control various levels of concentration attained through meditation. The central point of this area is the "Bindu" wherein all experience is gathered in total concentration. Tantric tradition has it that during meditation, the "kundalini" - the latent energy that lies at the base of the spine is awakened and rises to the point of sahasrara (7th chakra) situated in the head or brain. The central point, the bindu, becomes therefore a possible outlet for this potent energy. It is believed that the red kumkum lies between the eyebrows to retain energy in the human body.  courtesy: urlLink http://www.shaadi.com/wedding/rituals/bindi/040306-bindi-history.php

						   As I was flipping through my diary and reading the contents of it, I felt like sharing this hypothesis of mine. I always thought that an equillibrium in the reactions of a person makes him more better.The Newton's third law of motion which explains about the equillibrium in the action and it's reaction can be applied to explain human behavior too.  Most often my experiences assert the point that no one is an introvert or an extrovert.Pertaining to the behavior of a person, I assume that every person can and usually acts in the opposite way which might be unusual about him. It is rather the situations or the comfort level which determine the behavior of the person. Subconsciously every person acts and also reacts to the same action in the equally opposite way. This in fact brings harmony and balances his mental level.Though the degree and the duration may again vary but every person has to be expressive and also reflective or pensive.  A person who is a very complying and obliging employee can be a bossy person at home or with a certain person. This brings about a balance and harmony in the individual. This happens to me several times. I behave in excatly contradicting way in different situations. Especially in a new situation I might be too quiet and have that innocent and "ignorance is bliss" sort of an expression while my roommates would have just the opposite interpretation of my nature.My periods of chattering have to be balanced with placid periods.  After reaching the peak of saturation and undergoing all sorts of tragedies without reacting, the person has to break into tears or react in opposite way to ventillate his emotions. This also balances his mental stature.Well, this again proves it: Every action has or should have an equal and opposite reaction.
