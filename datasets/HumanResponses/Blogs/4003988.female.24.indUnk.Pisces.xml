      The blue and yellow sweater is DONE!! yeah my 2nd completed sweater.&nbsp; Now I am starting the princess cat bed for Bella.&nbsp; I brought the sweater to work to show everyone (I will not lose this one), now everyone wants me teach them to knit.&nbsp; I have 4 people who I am showing and I gave the pattern for the top down raglan in the round to another basic knitter so I have to show her how to do some of the more extensive&nbsp; stuff.&nbsp; As soon the cat bed is done I am hoping to have found lime green and hot pink yarn to do the other cousins sweater.&nbsp; Pictures will be uploaded tonight hopefully. Depends on how my daughter behaves once we get home, she has been a handful. All attitude and refusing to listen I now know that it is not the terrible 2's as she was still sooo good at two she will be 3 in&nbsp;a month and she is really pushing her limits with me.&nbsp; Since I lost her sweater I will have to make her a new one as well.&nbsp; Thankfully I have gotten faster and can do a small sweater in about 2 weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well this weekend has brought great progress on a blue sweater I am working on for my cousins daughter.&nbsp; When I was in Maine visiting over the 4th they were there from Oregon and she saw me knitting and asked for a sweater.&nbsp; How can I resist a request like that.&nbsp; She thought my socks were good and thats good enough for me considering it was my first pair of socks and they were not all that great.&nbsp; So my cousin requested blue and yellow.&nbsp; I decided to try a top down raglan in the round from spincraft patterns.&nbsp; I was so surprised at how easy it is, I plugged in the measurements as best I could and away I went it seemed like a no brainer.&nbsp; It took a week of a little here and a little there to do the body and I did the sleeve in a day.&nbsp; Still have 1 sleeve to go so hopefully will be done shortly.&nbsp; Bought the yarn today to do the princess snowball cat bed from SnB.&nbsp; Going to start that as soon as the sleeve is done.&nbsp; Then I have to do a sweater in lime green and pink for the cousins sister as well.&nbsp; I absolutely cannot find a pink and green that I think works well in the&nbsp;same type of yarn anywhere.&nbsp; I am so in love with knitting&nbsp;I have so many future projects I&nbsp;can't wait to start.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well....this is my first blog and it took me long enough and and caused enough of a&nbsp; headache to start up.&nbsp; Now it should be done and ready to go.&nbsp; Yeah if only.......&nbsp; Well I am new to blogging and wanted a place to chronical my knitting forays.&nbsp; I will post with a list of what I have done so far.&nbsp; I just taught my self to knit in April with the help of the internet and Deb Stoller's Stich n' Bitch.&nbsp; If you would like to know more about me please read my profile, if your questions are still unanswered just ask and I will tell.&nbsp;   I have started and completed 6 projects so far.&nbsp; I am currently heartbroken I worked for a solid month on the Haiku sweater from Knitty.com for my daughter.&nbsp; Several mistakes and cusses later it was done the body the sleeves, sown, attached and ready for buttons and wear.&nbsp; I brought it to work to show a couple of knitters and between work and home that night I lost the sweater.&nbsp; I looked everywhere for it and I even went so far as to put up signs asking for info.&nbsp; A week has gone by and no luck.&nbsp; I was heartbroken over the loss of my first sweater before my Kiki could wear it or I could take a picture of it.&nbsp; If anyone was in the Princeton New Jersey area Wednesday July 14 and you saw a small grey sweater please contact me.&nbsp; Hey its worth a shot right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully tomorrow will bring a list and some pics of what I have done so far and what I am currently working on.

      Yeah I got the pictures to work thru the Picasa.  Now on the right you will see a finished projects link and a on the needles link that you can click on and see some pictures.  There aren't too many there now  My veru first knitted object that was started in April 2004 and finished in May 2004 was a aquamarine baby blanket (knit with Red heart baby clouds using lion brand diagonal baby blanket)  I started with swatches and then wanted to learn increases so I did this blanket.  I must say it came out great :-)  Then there are pictures of my first knitted socks with crazy cotton (can't get the kid to wear them long enough to take a pictures) and the finished booga bag as well is there.  I will gather the others and update them soon.  On the needles is the princess cat bed from snb for my bella.  Not a good photo then bottom is fisherman wool-ease and ivory fun fur, the border is blush heather wool ease and soft pink fun fur.  Purrrfect for a princess kitty.  I have promised myself I won't start any other projects until this damn cat bed is done.  Not too much knitting at the moment my poor little Kiki has an ear infection and has not felt too good lately.  I hope she feels better soon her 3rd birthday is in less than 2 weeks.  I can't believe she will be 3. I told hubby I am ready for another one.  He says no.  What do we do???  I guess just see what the future brings.

      Ohm....ah Berroco Zen.  Went to my LYS Saturday and got a skein of white zen.  It called to me.  They only had one skein of the white.  I bought it.  I have no idea what it is going to be yet.  I am thinking a scarf or belt for one of my SIL. But it was so pretty and shiny I could not resist.  I also got another skein of regia to make some more socks either for my heathen or my niece. The border for the cat bed is now 33 inches I need to be somewhere around 53 inches to complete it. Slowly but surely it is coming along.  I felt bad for Bella as yesterday she was curled up in a ball in the middle of the floor with nothing to lay on.  She will love this.  The last bed she slept in all the time.  But alas my daughter pulled it apart on the poor kitty so she now has nothing.  My stepdad got a couple of those mini tent displays that you see at the stores.  My daughter took one for her barbies to go camping in, and Bella took one as her own home to hide in.  They are too cute they are mini Coleman tents I love it. I might take what is left over from the bed and make a small mat for the floor of the tent.  Still working on the pictures.  I might just break out the old front page and create a page of my own with the pics on it, might be less time consuming and easier in the long run.  Right now the home internet is not working.  Verizon changed some settings and nothing is working at the moment.  They are to come tomorrow and change my ancient modem and software for me to get it all better.  Lets keep our fingers crossed.

      Last night I found the 10 1/2 circs so I am slowly getting more progress on the kitty bed.  Now I am making a list of what I need to make for gifts for family and friends for chirstmas: sister- funky scarf brother-in-law; skull cap; scarf brother- skull cap sis-in-law-bogga bag; scarf, mittens sis-in-law-bogga bag; mittens sis-in-law-bogga bag, scarf brother-in-law-? sis-in-law-bogga bag, ? brother-In-law-? neice-under the hoddie, scarf neice- backpack, hat nephew- skull cap nephew- hat and mittens, maybe socks nephew- skull cap nephew-skull cap nephew-skull cap mother-in-law-? her hubby? my mom- (snb) meema's felted tote ( it is so cute my daughter calls my mom meema) step dad- hat dad??? my hubby- skull cap, manly sweater daughter-mittens, new sweater  And that is just immediate family,  I know realistically they all will not be done by christmas but hopefully I can have at least 1 for each done in time:-) Hopefully at least the smaller easier ones.  I did the bogga bag in 2 days so everyone might get one for christmas.  We will see.  Now that I am able to work on the kitty bed again I got quite a bit done last night.  We watched welcome to Mooseport ( kinda funny but way too drawn out)  I added about 6 inches in length to it.  Now I only have about 46 inches to go.  Whoo hoo.  No more big long projcts for me this year I need to do quick small ones so I can start stocking up on gifts.  Thankfully it is fairly quick and if worse comes to worse my sis in law or mom would like that cat bed so I can use that for them as well.  Still can't figure out the damn picture thing and now the ones I took got lost by the digital fairy and I have to re take them.  Oh well keep smiling and chugging along,  I have to go with a friend tonight to see her brother and his family while they are in from Ireland they are going home tomorrow and we want to see them before they leave.  I don't mind they are great people and he is a cutie, funny and nice too boot (with an irish accent).  So it is no  hardship to go spend time with them.   I will have to stay up late and get some progress done on the kitty bed.  Off to do some work.

      Well I finally got the booga bag and I-cord done and felted.  It came out so much better than I expected.  I was scared to felt it and afraid I would ruin it since I had never felted before.  There was one spot in the yarn that was spun weird and really thin.  After the first felting it ripped in that spot and there was a hole.  I wanted to cry.  Instead I took some of the left over in the same color and stitched it closed from the inside, then I washed it again.  It doesn't look too bad.  From the outside you cannot notice it at all.  From the inside you can see it a little bit where I sewed it but all in all not too bad. I have pictures but this blogger says to use picasa to upload and insert in blog I cannot get it to work for me at all. So if anyone reads this and has tips to help me I sure would appreciate it very much.  Didn't get anything done yesterday me and the hubby went to six flags great adventure for some fun.  No time to knit.  Then to top it all off for the border of the princess cat bed for Bella I am using 10 1/2 needles, on Saturday my darling little heathen daughter decided to play with them while I was doing the dishes.  Normally not a big deal.  But she put one of them somewhere where I cannot find it at all and she can't remember where she put it.  Who can at 3.  So right now I have one 10 1/2 needle to work with on the bed, not much getting done :-) I have 10 1/2 circs just have to find them and I can use them to finish it but I don't know where I put those.  Not much luck here.  I lost my very first sweater before my daughter even got to wear it, and then I lost 3 and a half pounds of black chenille I got from eBa,y never took it out of the box, and I cannot find it to save my life, then the needle my DD lost, and now the cicrs I lost.  This doesn't bode well at all for my knitting future.  Oh well, I will have to start on the baby socks for my friends little boy that I have be wanting to make.  Cannot find a pattern that I like tho.  Hopefully soon I will figure out the damn picasa thing and be able to insert some pics.  Remember any help greatly appreciated.

      I got the booga bag done this weekend I am still working on the I cord for the straps and then I will try to felt it. and block it as well I can't wait. It came out so much prettier than I thought it would. I love it.  I signed up for the Secret Pal 3  urlLink   today and I took the question list they recommended for ferreting out information so here it is with my answers as well:        1. Are you a yarn snob (do you prefer high-end/natural fibers)? Do you avoid Red Heart and Lion Brand? Or is it all the same to you?   I do enjoy natural fibers and lush yarns but I am not averse to using acrylics either. I find for kids acrylic is much more practical than most. I’m not going to use alpaca for a sweater for my toddler.   2. Do you spin? Crochet?   Have no desire to spin. I do enjoy crocheting.   3. Do you have any allergies? (Smoke pets, fibers, perfume, etc.).   Yes but I cope with them and I still have pets and I still smoke and wear perfume. Nothing I can’t live with   4. How long have you been knitting?   Since April 2004 I just started to teach myself and I love it. I have mastered many tasks in those 5 short months.   5. Do you have an Amazon or other online wish list?   Yes Amazon   6. What's your favorite scent? (For candles, bath products etc.)   I love Vanilla and all citrus scents orange, lemon, lime, etc   7. Do you have a sweet tooth?   Not really   8. What other crafts or Do-It-Yourself things do you like to do?   I love all crafty stuff, scrapbooking, stamping, sewing, painting, etc. With my limited time my craft of choice happens to be knitting and crochet, I HATE EMBROIDERY AND CROSS STITCH   9. What kind of music do you like? Can your computer/stereo play MP3s? (If you want to make her a CD)   I am very eclectic, I love the oldies, heavy metal I love 80’s hair bands I like new pop stuff and some country, I love music in general. I have no clue if my hamster 500 PC can play mp3s probably not.   10. What's your favorite color? Or--do you have a color family/season/palette you prefer?   Any shade of purple and the blue family, pink and all things leopard print, I also like citrus colors as well bright lime yellow pink orange and   11. What is your family situation? Do you have any pets?   I have 3-year-old does that count as a pet? J Me my hubby, my terrible 3 daughter our new 3 month old kitten.   12. What are your life dreams? (really stretching it here, I know)   To be a good mommy. And maybe for me a to be a PR person for the NJ Devils  I love the Devils.    So for the Secret Pal 3 there is some information on me as well. My goal for today is to get the strap done for the bag and then felt it tonight when I get me and let it dry. Hubby and I are taking tomorrow off for an adult day of fun at Six flags Great Adventure and There are four knitting shops on the way there. I hope I can get him to stop for me :-)

      Ohhhhh. I am so happy my Noro was waiting on my porch when I got home last night. I could not wait to cast on and start the booga bag. I was soo good I held out thru dinner and Kiki's bath and then I sat and box braided all of her hair( okay so she doesn't have that much) but it was so cute the little heathen has refused to go to bed at a decent time all week and she was so tired that at 7:30 last night while I was braiding her hair she fell asleep. They're such angels when they sleep:-) Good for me thou I got to do straight thru work on it from 8:00 on. I got the base done and then picked up the nec. stitches and started the bag part as well. I am so excited My very first Noro experience and I have to say it is all I was promised. I love it I am going to order another color of the Noro in the black grey and red and do a more muted bag for more occasions as well. I love the colors of the #95 it is so pretty and they flow so nice. Should be able to get a lot done this weekend and then try my hand at my first felting experience as well. I am so excited. DH working late tonight  so good things to come with out him home bothering me ;-) Progress check later on maybe I can figure out the picasa thing and get some pics up as well.  Wish me luck.

      I am so happy I just made my first Noro Kureyon purchase. I saw the booga j bag pattern and I was just dying to make it. I found 3 skeins of #95 on eBay for $6.90 a piece so I ordered the 3 it said it needed for the bag. I paid extra for 1 day shipping I am dying to see it. I have never seen or touched noro before. I have been told once I do I will never go back. The princess cat bed for Bella is going good but very slow. The base is coming out a lot larger than I thought it would, but it is still very nice even though she is very small at this point I know she will get bigger and fit it better very soon. Last night I bought 2 skeins lion brand cotton ease in 2 shades of blue. I am going to attempt to make sock and a hat possibly a sweater for a friends little boy who is just 6 months old. I have only been knitting since April and already I have a whole large tote full of yarn. My hubby is ready to throw me and my yarn out already. That doesn't bode well for the future I know I will only get worse with my yarn love. Oh well the husband can go first right :-)
