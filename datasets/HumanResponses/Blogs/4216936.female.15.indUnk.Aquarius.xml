        Hey yall..well, yesterday i guess i overreacted...somewhat. Thanks to everyone that talked me out of running away.....even sam you snuck out late at night to come talk to me. i love u mucho. I'm still really pissed...but I guess getting a job during the school year wont be that hard.....hopefully. Jordy says if i can get a job, i'll eventually be able to get a shitty car. *sigh* yeah..it sucks. but guess what then. I have to pay for insurance. at this rate i'm not gonna get a car until im 21. *sigh* oh well. Umm..yep. thats my update really. I love you all...still ^_^always,*kelzxoxo    Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight? Have you ever cried so hard? Baby you just died  And there she goes again Another masquerade in false circumstance She'll fuck you just for the taste I just wish I could replace all the memories Of what makes my blood run cold And as your blood flows through me I say goodbye to what we had  She came and wentI gnawed through my lip Makeup smeared in her eyes Each sob's a reason to say goodbye.  Sometimes when you're holding on You'll never see the light With flowers in her hair Gazed upon with dead lovers eyes She never looked so good And I never felt so right I felt so wrong-Atreyu
