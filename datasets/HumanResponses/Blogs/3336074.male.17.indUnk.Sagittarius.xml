      Having an unexpectedly good evening is always cool. I tried to get out of the house several times today, but to no avail. In the end I just spent the night with my brother, and Christ, we had a pretty good time. We played  Super Smash Bros Melee  for hours. For some reason we had an especially awesome time at it too. We laughed so much. Afterwards I prepared myself a second dessert and watched a bit of  Scrubs  - something that I haven't done in a while. It certainly wasn't a particularly special night, but I still enjoyed it.  To sum up, I'd like to say that my brother is cool.

      Fuck. This is now take two of this post. My first one was lost to a crappy IE error.  It's only been two days since my last post... feels like longer. To be fair I did spend the majority of one of those days without a working computer. I finally got around to reformatting this thing (yay!). This means I sat at this freakin chair for way to fucking long. It also means I've gone without music for the most part of two days. This is a tragedy, since music is the only interesting thing one could have while reformatting a computer. It was a lot of fucking work (especially organizing my 800 songs), but at least it's done. Now I can go on MSN without resorting to the shitty computer downstairs.  The one bad thing was that I never did manage to install my new video card. Fuck you, you retarded motherboard!  Even though I complained about it on my site, I must say: that was a long fucking comic. I just want to go to bed after sitting here for so long. Oh well, at least I'm pleased with the way it turned out.  I'm going to go out on a limb now and talk about refer to something Emily said (good god no!). She mentioned not being able to experience any real extreme emotions. I've thought about this and realized that I couldn't be any more different. It seems like I can only ever feel really good or really shitty. If I'm not feeling either then I'm bored. It's pretty sad. There's no middle ground. If I don't feel something then I'm bored. I'm pretty sure that's why I enjoy being in relationships so much. You're always feeling  something .  Now I'm sure there are plenty of you out there who feel the same way. It isn't anything new. But I still don't think it's a very good thing. My guess is that there's balance missing in your life if you have to always be feeling something. Not being able to enjoy a stress-free environment can't be very good.  The thing is, I'm missing something, but I don't know what it is, or where to find it.     In other news, if two guys are interested in a girl, and I'm one of them, I will never be the one who gets the girl. It's a scientific fact. I would  bet  on it. I don't know what it is, but it's never failed (all two times :P)

      I went to bed at six. I really did need it. I've barely been sleeping this weekend. But then I woke up at 11... PM. Why the hell should I wake up at 11? After an hour of lying in bed, I got up and had a bagel. It had lots of butter. I tried going back to bed after that, but nothing seems to work. It's been two hours since my bagel, and still I can't sleep. Yet I know that I'm sleep deprived. What kind of a cruel joke is this?  It's been a rough weekend. I've been experiencing things that I guess are anxiety attacks. Feelings of anxiety and depression just build up until I loose control. My body stops doing what I tell it to. It can get quite violent. It's an incredibly scary thing to have happen to you.  The funny thing is though, that I don't actually feel that bad about it. Sure, I feel like shit while it's happening, but afterwards it doesn't seem like such a big thing. I know what I feel aren't really my own emotions, and I guess that makes all the difference. Sure, it would be really shitty if I actually was depressed all the time, but when I feel depressed for no real reason, it just doesn't seem as bad. I look around me at all the people who really are anxious. At everyone who feels depressed. Everyone who's having difficulty dealing with their everyday lives. And I feel like my problems are nothing in comparison. My life really isn't causing me that much grief right now, so I'm not all that worried. My heart goes out to all of those other people. I certainly know what it can be like. I've been there before. Even though, presently, I occasionally loose control of my mind and body, it's nothing like loosing control of your life.  Aside from all this, my weekend hasn't been all that bad. At times I've had a lot of fun. I've hung out with a lot of really cool people. I've also been shown more than once what truly amazing friends I have.  I can't help but worry about some of you though. Maybe if I wasn't so tired, I wouldn't even be saying this. I just want you all to know that I'm here for you. Under normal circumstances (so, excluding anxiety attacks), I have plenty of strength to lend to others. Standing by, watching people go through all sorts of pain, isn't my sort of thing. So please, if any of you need someone, don't hesitate to ask. I'm more than glad to be able to help.  Maybe no one will think anything of what I just said. Maybe you might just think I'm talking through my ass. Hell, maybe I am. But I still have to try.    Oh well, terribly sorry if this has just been one shitty post, but it's really too late to care. I'm off to get some sleep*.   *Actual sleep not included.

      I haven't been getting the best responses regarding my plans to become a pirate. People seem to think it's an unrealistic or stupid goal. I think you're all unrealistic and stupid people. At least Creggan understands me. Then again, she has aspirations of becoming a vampire elf. My goals suddenly seem downright lucid.  But I suppose you're not here to listen to me talking about pirates (they're SOOO COOL!). You're here (in theory) to listen to me whining! Because really, isn't that what blogging is  all  about?  I'm not entirely sure...  Either way, I refuse to whine. Mostly because I have nothing to whine about. Life's not too bad.  While talking to Viki today I really did realize a startling thing: I'm no where near as pessimistic as I (and other people) might believe. In fact, I can be downright optimistic*. No matter how bad things get, I can always seem to bounce back startlingly quickly... even though occasionally I might need a little prodding. I guess the thing is that once I decide that I can't do anything to help a situation, it's behind me. No dwelling. No grudges. It's not really optimism even, it's just keeping perspective about what's important.  Not that I'm saying that I don't occasionally lose this perspective. That would be totally untrue. At the moment though, I think I'm kinda good.  I also must mention that Woody Allen is a god. I'm just rereading  Without Feathers  (which is a reference to Emily Dickinson's "Hope is the thing with feathers...")(why must I add in these stupid little facts?), and it never fails to make me laugh out loud. All of his books are just genius, not to mention his movies. He is the embodiment of hilarity; a fact which I think you'd all appreciate if you went out and exposed yourself to him (and no, Pat, nobody wants to see THOSE parts of you exposed... that's not what I meant at all).   *Note: this does not imply real optimism.

      I have an awfull lot of pirate music on my computer. "Why?" you might ask. Well, I suppose I should reveal my dirty little secret.  I want to be a pirate. I really do. I love the ocean. I love sailing. I love swashbuckling. It really is my kind of lifestyle. All I want from life is a schooner and an able-bodied crew. Then I would be content.  If you wish to join my crew, please contact me at alex@thedominosonline.com Join now and you're guarentied a spot!

      I planned on phoning a bunch of people tonight. Then I realized that in the past 36 hours, I've had a little under two hours of sleep.  Sleep definitely wins this time.

      That REALLY is enough whining from me.  Really, I think we can draw two conclusions from this:  Firstly, I think I've shrunk. I walked into the store near my house and everyone seemed to be towering over me. Maybe I just forgot how short I really am. Or maybe it was discount day for tall people over at the Freshmart...  Secondly, there are only 10 types of people in the world: Those who know binary, and those who don't.    In OTHER news... I'M THE KING OF  NO  PANTS!   Voice from the back: Oh God. Why couldn't you have been the king  of  pants.

      It's gotten to the point where I've given up any pretences of having something to do. I no longer aimlessly wander around the internet. I stopped working on my computer. Instead, I've just been lying on my bed.  I can't even call anybody. Calling somebody would be a nuisance to them. And I don't want to be a nuisance. So instead I sit here, blogging away. So damn pathetic.

      I had a dream. It must have been directed by Quentin Tarantino.     It's really very sad. I've become almost obsessive compulsive about my email and blogs. I can hardly shut down my computer. I can't LEAVE my computer without checking my email and looking through all the blogs that mean anything to me.  Somehow I think it might substitute for the people I miss.  Word to the wise: It's a pretty piss-poor substitute.

      Well, It's not much of a song. It's just one of those tiny tunes from grade school. You probably know it too.   I am slowly going crazy, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, switch! Crazy going slowly am I, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, switch!   Repeat as needed. The longer you go, the crazier you seem to everyone around you.    Well, apparently my plan failed. I obviously didn't go to sleep tired enough last night, because I still had time to cry for an hour or so. Incidentally, I'm still tired.  But maybe I should explain why I'm in such a foul mood. Why not? I'll get my money's worth out of this thing.  It all started 17 years ago when... wait, no, skip ahead a bit.  Alright, last Friday, Emily broke up with me, as anyone who's reading this probably already knows. There was a lot of pain and suffering. But then on Wednesday, I woke up and felt better. I realized that it really was for the best, and that now, not only does she have her freedom, but I have mine too, so why not put it to use?   Three days of sitting at home later, and my high spirits have been effectively quashed. Not only HAVEN'T I done anything yet, but I haven't the slightest PLANS on doing anything.  For a cartoony analogy, it's like I've fallen, bounced up again, but then realized that there's nothing up there to hold me up, flailed my arms a little... then fallen again.  Oh the tragic lives of cartoon characters. Coyote, you have my deepest sympathies.

      That's because I do this every night. I don't go to sleep when I should. I read webcomics or god knows what else. And yet I can't stop. Stopping would be giving in somehow. Going to sleep is admitting that I wasted another day. Going to sleep is just another reminder of how lonely I am. At least this way I'm so tired when I finally do go to bed that I just crash. No thoughts, no pain. Just sweet sleep. Sleep that is really much more interesting than pretty much everything I've done all day.  Right up until the moment I give up to go to bed, I still hope someone will try to talk to me. Very rarely do I even recognize this desire... but it's there.  Every night I go to bed disappointed.  Then come the dreams. They serve to break up the monotony.  Last night I dreamt of having a lobotomy.    Wake up, rinse and repeat.  Goodnight.

      Okay, maybe I lied a little. But only a little. I'm not quite as clued out as  No Rain  might have you believe. I know exactly why I sleep all day. I know why I miss the rain.  It's because I'm a terribly lonely person.  Yep, it's pretty much always been that way. What can I say? Sometimes it's better than others. Sometimes I can completely deal with being alone. Sometimes I'm content in being self-sufficient.  Now is not one of those times.  Right now I need people. I'm sick of sitting in my room. I'm sick of being with myself.  And yet, I don't see anything else to do. Not many people have enough time to spend but one day a week with me... and I certainly don't know enough people to make up for this. And if I try to make an effort to make something happen... well, Viki knows what it's like. It feels like you're intruding. It's just the way these things happen. If people don't seem to want to make an effort to spend time with you, there's no way you're going to feel wanted.  And so here I am. Lonely. Unwanted. And I keep hoping someone might pick up the phone and ask if I want to do something... or even just talk... but it so very rarely happens [I must exclude Pat from this, since he usually calls me daily].  Instead, I make my own calls. And for a while things aren't bad. But then eventually everyone has something to do. Yet I never do. So they hang up, and the loneliness only gets worse.  I really want to get out of here. I really want to just have fun with people.    I'm so damn pathetic.    You know, I never started a blog in the first place since I figured it would just be a bunch of whining. Guess what? I was right.    Oh well. At least I have the blues. The blues can't leave me.

      As I sit here today, I am about to embark on a journey. A spiritual quest. Perhaps it might even reveal the MEANING OF MY LIFE.  That's right: I'm about to reformat my computer.  After a year or so of relative neglect, it is once again time to strip everything down and build it up again fro scratch. That reminds me: I really must call Eric so I can get my Windows CD's back. Without those, I would have a very short and unsuccessful job ahead of me.  Bastard doesn't answer his bloody phone...  Gah... There's so much to do! I must away.

      Okay, so I caved.   I enjoy reading these things. That much is not hard for me to admit. So I figured, why not give something back? I mean, you all must want to know what's on my mind. I've been wondering the same thing myself.  But I kid. I'm sure you can't give a flying fuck what I'm thinking.  ... Not that I care about that, since I'm blogging anyways... OUT OF SPITE FOR YOU ALL!  Oh dear.   As I'm sure you might have noticed, I've included a lot (probably too many) references to Blind Melon's  No Rain  in this blog. This is for the simple reason that it is my most favoritist song in the world. Honestly, no other song could more accurately describe my life... as sad as that might be.  So I leave you with the majority of the lyrics of this wonderful song. If ever you need to know something about the finer points of my life, just look to this song for reference. It'll all make sense then.    All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watchin' the puddles gather rain And all I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view But it's not sane, It's not sane  I just want some one to say to me I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain that there's no rain And all I can do is read a book to stay awake And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape   In conclusion: DOWNLOAD  NO RAIN !

      I dragged out two old albums today.  Strange Days  by The Doors and  Hotel California  by The Eagles. I've come to the conclusion that both of these bands rock. A lot. Now I only have about two billion more albums to go through. Next up is Heart.  God, I can't get  Touch Me  out of my head. It's not even in that Doors album, it's just a really cool song. Especially with Laurence on keyboard and Jack Black doing the vocals. Well, not especially...  Trying to figure out which stories I can put down here... Well, I went to give some blood on Friday. If I say it like that, it almost sounds like a noble dead. In fact, a doctor just ordered a bunch of blood tests for me. And I mean a bunch. The nurse taking the blood told me "I don't know how many there are here [referring to test tubes that would have to be filled with blood], but there are a hell of a lot." Well, maybe she didn't say exactly THAT. But it was in French when she said it anyways, so I may or may not have taken liberties with the translation. Yes, I am aware that I just stated the only possibilities that are... possible...  ANYways, I had biked to the hospital (in Hull) which wasn't so bad. The only bad thing came after I had to bike BACK. Except, not quite back, more up fucking Notch road... and THEN back. You try doing that while already tired from previous biking, dehydrated, and low on blood. I barely rolled into my driveway.   Long story short, I have a fear of needles.     I feel I should mention something about little punk girls.  Well, I just did.

      If it wasn't cold, dark, and raining, I would be on my bike and going somewhere far away. Sometimes I just feel crazy. But I know that if I actually do what my crazy mind comes up with, I'll just end up scaring everyone away from me. Hell, I already put forth a pretty good effort at doing just that. But still I'm holding back. I just put it aside and try to ignore it. It can't always work that way though, and things are bound to sneak up on me. I try not to be so insecure, but every once and a while I'll spend entire days just worrying.  Gah, even now I'm weighing exactly how much crazy I should let out into this blog. It just doesn't end.  Frick... I'm just going to try to sleep now. My sleep has been troubled of late and I can't see me doing any better tonight, but still I have to try.  Well, not really... I just have nothing better to do.

      Over the past few days, I've noticed a marked decrease in the frequency of my tics. I suppose it's a good thing, although now that my craziness has no where else to go, I'm finding myself more and more feeling like I'm on the verge of exploding. It's an overwhelming sensation that starts deep in my chest, and then begins to increase in pressure. I try to hold it in, but I know that I need an outlet.  So today, after feeling particularly explody, I just grabbed my bike and started peddling. I biked until I was burning and wanting to throw up. And then I biked some more. After a while I made it to Pat's house. Unfortunately he wasn't there (ye bastardde). But it's no biggy. That wasn't the point of my ride anyways. The point was just to go. And so I did.  Hm... Anything more to talk about? Probably, but I'm boring, so I'll let it go.

      Damn power outages...  Alright, my second try at this... although I didn't get too far the first time, thank God.  It's funny how a string of just a few good things can really pick you up. One minute I have some incurable genetic disorder... and now, none of that seems to matter. I'm content just living my life, which is a welcome relief. Now you might be wondering what's happened. To that I shall say: you should watch more Scrubs.  Seriously.    Well, looks like I didn't get very far THIS time either... Oh well, I'm leaving. See you later, suckers.

      Well after a combined 14 hours spent in a hospital trying to see a neurologist, I was finally given the privilege to be in his presence. After such a long wait I had kind of expected something a little more... grand. Like shakily O'Neil... or something. It wasn't like he wasn't that great... but he seemed... normal. Despite this, after giving me an exam that seemed to be almost identical to the exams every other doctor had given me, he told me that I have Chronic Motor Tic Disorder. Apparently it's a lesser known variant of Tourette's Syndrome. He also gave me a prescription to some drugs that I doubt I'll end up taking. They're suppressants that make you drowsy at the same time. So... I'm thinking no. Anyways, it's just a relief to get all this over with. Now I just need to learn how to deal with this disorder. Well, we shall see.  It's weird... I don't know if it's the countless hours in the hospitals or the overdose of  Scrubs , but I kind of feel compelled to become a doctor right now. I suppose it could be nice helping people... but at the same time I kinda hope that this feeling will pass. Being a doctor seems pretty time consuming. It's a lifestyle in it's own, and I don't know if I could handle that. Heh, once again, I guess we'll see.  I'm really at a loss right now. I have no idea what to do with myself. But nobody is going to tell me what to do. Nobody can. I need to figure it out for myself. I firmly believe that all the problems we see in our lives - all of the boredom, all of the confusion, all of the shitty people, all of the hopelessness - everything can be solved with a change in perspective. Because all of those things aren't the  real  problems. Those things will always exist, no matter where you go. The trick is to find a way of looking at things that makes it bearable. No running away, no giving up, just accepting. If you can do that, then you've got it set.  The cynic in me is dying of laughter...

      Isn't life fun? My condition only seems to be getting worse. I mentioned the man with Tourette’s… that’s the closest thing I know that I can compare what I’m going through to. I said that I feel like a freak... let me elaborate on that.  I can't stand to look in the mirror any more. When I go into the bathroom, I keep my head down. Brushing my teeth tonight, I turned around to face the wall. I’m afraid to go out in public. I’m afraid to talk to my friends. I’m afraid to let anyone see me.  Oh yes… and my internet is screwed up.  Life’s just a party.

      I can remember when I worked at the Freshmart, the only truly interesting thing there was the people. There were the people who worked there. You'd get the losers that where there for a while. Of course, once you know them, they're a wonderful lot. I certainly don't mean to say that they aren't good people when I use the term "losers". They just aren't going anywhere in life. Then there are the students, like myself, whom I can relate to. We're just there for the pitiful paychecks. Get in, get out. Our lives are all far removed.  Then there are the customers. They play a big part in how you feel at the end of the day. You get some morons, but you can also get some cool customers (yay 50's slang!). You see all types there. The drunks, the soccer moms, the elderly, the tiniest of children, people who are practically giants, gays, people who are fighting, and people who just love to talk, inconsiderate people, and caring ones. A good game to pass the time is just to imagine where these people are in life. What they'll be doing after they leave our little building and get in their cars.  I've been remembering one man in particular today. I don't know his name, but then I didn't know the names of a great deal of people who came through that store every day. I remember him because he has Tourette's. Only now can I begin to understand what that man has been through. Well, I can only guess what he's been through, but I can say what things have felt like for me.  Actually, I'm not going to go into any great lengths about that. It's just too depressing. I'll just say that I feel like a freak. It's not very cool.  Yeah... my neck hurts.

      I just remembered that: Like T deux, yo. It comes from when Pat and I went bowling a little while ago... apparently he's unable to properly put his name in the machine, because that's what the result was... with some help from me...  I saw Matchstick Men yesterday. Well, that's not quite true. I saw the first 30 minutes of Matchstick Men, and then I had to dash off. The first 30 minutes of Matchstick Men focus on this dude, Roy, who's played by Nicolas Cage. Roy has OCD: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The funny thing was, I could sympathize with him. I  do  know what it's like not to have control of how you feel about something. You know better. It's just common sense, isn't it? But you still can't help but feel and act that way.  Things only seem to be getting worse in that respect. It's weird though... it's only been a couple of weeks since this has really started up. Hell, I don't even know if they're worse... they were bad enough to begin with. I just seem to be developing more nervous movement, more often than before though... probably not a good sign.  I went and saw a doctor about it a week and a bit ago. He was an ER doc, so he wasn't able to do much. He just told me that I'd get a call from neurology... eventually. Apparently those neurology doctors are busy... go figure. He also told me to phone a hospital so I could order two different E.E.G.s for myself. It felt a little weird calling up some strange number and saying "Hello... uh... I'd like a brain scan please." They complied though, and gave me a date for the scan. A date that I THOUGHT was Friday. I woke up all early on Friday, got ready, and started driving to the hospital. Yeah... turns out it's this COMING Friday. So... I'm an idiot.  I really don't know what would be worse though: if what I'm going through is neurological, or physiological. It certainly doesn't feel like I have much control over things, so that would make it neurological... it would be a little comforting to know that there isn't anything wrong with me PSYCHOLOGICALLY... but at the same time, having something inherently wrong with your brain isn't that great a prospect either. I think this might be one of those loose/lose cases.  I'd like to think that other than all of this, I'm doing pretty well, but the truth is, it's getting so I just can't ignore this stuff. I can't just separate it and say "Well, that's only me sometimes, but mostly Im fine." Because, really, this is starting to get kind of depressing. I try not to worry about it, because it'll only have a negative impact... but it gets harder every day.   I'm finding it harder to be a gentleman every day. - The White Stripes  I love having songs pop into my head just by saying certain things. It's a pretty cool song too. It has an almost Supertrampish organ in it... and we all know that Supertramp is awesome. If you disagree or you just know Supertramp, then you should go fuck yourself, or listen to some Supertramp, respectively. I guaranty that if you take my advise to me, you'll be happier in the end.   Well that was a lot of whining. If we look at the bright side of things, I have amazing friends. It's the truth. No lie. Except for you... you're just annoying. Stop reading my blog.

      Oh the way I can dance. My moves are amazing.   Actually, I can't dance. Those are just lyrics by Hawksley Workman... Although the title might be right...  Wait, no. Let me modify that: "I should have been Ranma." That works for me.  If you don't understand what I'm talking about, just take the time to google "Ranma". It'll all come into focus.  I haven't updated in a while. That much is certain. What isn't certain is what I've actually been DOING in this time. I don't know. I recall drawing some comics. That seems to be going smoothly... But you certainly didn't come here to hear about that. I've worked on cars... dug holes... all in all not much is going on.  I suppose I have been feeling kind of oddly of late. But that really isn't any news. Thing is, right now I'm too tired to even figure out what it is I've been feeling. So really, this is just one crappy blog. I really mean that. They don't get much crappier than this. I apologize for wasting your time.

      Say you will.    Good gracious. I haven't talked to anyone in ages (well, anyone who reads my blog at least... it's funny... the people I have talked to don't even read this). See, I've been kind of busy. Yes, it finally happened: I got a job. A damn fine one too. I also got Ronan in on the action. We're manufacturing ribs for giant domes. Right now we're working on one that's going to go on a church in Wisconsin.   But that certainly isn't the best part. The best part is *ahem* the fifteen dollars an hour I'm making. Yeah, that's right Pat, I make more than you! Eat it!&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Aside from work I've been spending pretty much all my free time with Lia. I know a good deal of you will scoff at this... but it's my fucking blog so deal with it. Dear God, seems I can't be anything between happy or neurotic. I need&nbsp;a kick in the face.&nbsp;Oh well... at least I've managed to find someone as messed up as me. And she does make me incredibly happy.   Huh... I heard back from a doctor the other day. I only actually heard from him because his son's a friend of my brother, so he decided to check the results from my blood tests. Turns out I'm copper deficient... and that this is rather rare. Apparently copper deficiency can be responsible for a great deal of problems including depression and mood swings. Now he wants me to go in for an MRI... and I'm not entirely sure why. Is there a chance I have a tumor? It's possible.   The plot thickens.   &nbsp;  At work today I managed to cut myself twice and drop a huge rib on my fingers. The last cut was a real bleeder too. My hands are being forced to get all tough and callousy.   I'm manly.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Ha.

      Has it been a week  already ?  &nbsp;  Yes. Yes it has. Now stop asking stupid questions.  &nbsp;  I must say, today has kinda flown by. And yesterday too. This may or may not have something to do with my recent purchase of Spider-Man 2 (the game). Holy crap that game owns. I must also state for the record that shortly before I bought Spider-Man 2, a good friend, who will remain nameless, went out and bought HARRY POTTER. Why would Pat do this? There are no answers.  &nbsp;  This has been one sweaty day, I must say. It started out with wood piling, then moved into biking to and from downtown Ottawa... and now it's just sweaty sitting. Yummy!  &nbsp;  It's odd. Whatever it was in my head that was making me feel like exploding molten crazy over everything kinda snapped back off at some point. This is cause for much relief. Relief and puppies.  &nbsp;  Do you know what day tomorrow is? I sure do.    &nbsp;  *Note: The title of this blog in no way represents the mood of the author.

      No bruises though. That's always good. They would certainly be hard to explain.  Let's see, what's going on here? Well, apparently I have anger problems. I just never show it. And so, it builds up inside of me. Until I reach the point where I'm about to snap. Kinda like I have been recently. Haven't been too bad today actually, but for the past few days I've been pretty much constantly had a strong desire to destroy everything around me. Can't be the healthiest thing...  Well, Julia is gone... so it looks to be a lonely week for Alex. Yes, that's just how much of a loser I am.  Christ, I spend enough time alone and I start believing all the crap I tell myself.

      Good times makes for poor blogging. This is not a log of what I do. This is just a forum for my feelings. It's not surprising then that being happy kind of ruins things.   Dear blog,  Today was good.  Sincerely, Alex   Oh well.  If I can't find anything to write about in my life, at least I have dreams. The night before last I had two exeptionally vivid dreams. Most nights I won't have any recolection of what was going on in my head, so this is really a rather rare occurence. Neither of them was very plesant either...  The first one took place when we drove to a park. I say we because I know there was someone with me, but I'm afraid they didn't matter terribly since I can't remember who it was. It was just  someone . It wasn't just a little park you'd find with play structures for kids, this was a nice park. It was lake-side with plenty of trees, most notably cedar. I was wandering around this park when I spotted a form nestled under the low branches of a cedar. Approaching it, I found it was a small girl. She was maybe 5 or six, but she seemed smaller because she was obviously malnourished. After talking to her I discovered that she had been abandoned by her parents, and that she was sick. That's when a strange thing happened. I felt an overwhelming feeling of love for this girl. The kind of love a parent would feel for their child. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen. I told her that I would help her with her sickness, and when that was over, I would take her home with me.  I held her in my arms as my companion drove us to the hospital. After much confusion getting into the hospital, we finally saw a doctor. I can't remember what exactly happened at this point. I just remember finding out that she was in worse condition that I'd thought, and that she wasn't going to make it. I was heartbroken.  The second dream took place in a classroom. There was some teacher who didn't seem to be doing much teaching. Mostly people did whatever they wanted. At some point the teacher asked me if I would help him. I agreed and went with him and a few other students into a lab room. He told me that he had to prepare some compound that was rather poisonous. He showed me the procedure and then asked me to take over while he left with the other students. I did what he told me to do... until I messed up and touched the compound. It must have been rather poisonous because soon after I could feel it starting to take effect. I started feeling misserable and my tongue started to swell. It started out normal, getting bigger and bigger, until finally it completely blocked off my mouth. I couldn't breath through my mouth, I couldn't swallow, I couldn't talk. I decided I better get help, so I took off after the teacher. Oddly enough I found him walking down the street with the other students. I tried to call out to him, but I couldn't. So I began to run down the street after him. As I ran, it became harder and harder to breath. I wasn't getting enough air through my nose. I kept going until I collapsed onto the side of the road. That's where I lay, dying, until I woke up.  Try to figure those out.    Just for posterity, that title is the title of a Cheap Trick song.

I want a new season. I included that quote because it's kinda how I feel. but I'm including this one because it's just so damn much fun:     Janitor -  Why? Were you stealing tapioca and toilet paper?   J.D. -  No, of course not! I hate tapioca and I don't... use toilet paper...  I have one of those french things that shoots water up your butt.   Janitor -  A bidet [pronounced "beday"]   J.D. -  Bidet to you sir. [walks off]      So let's see... what have I been up to? Getting sugar high with Pat... getting crack high with Angelo... uh... I mean...      What a pathetic post.
