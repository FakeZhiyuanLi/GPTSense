      Michigan was cool, the only thing i didnt like about it was my cousin, Marie, she is so spoiled.....they had a carnival up there by her church, and i had asked her if she wanted to go, cause i could take her, then she said she wanted to wait for her mom, but then her mom didnt feel like goin that day so Marie didnt wanna go either, that really pissed me off......i dont mind goin up there, but if she just wasnt so spoiled.....Sunday they had a parade and Marie was on one of the floats, i had a chance to go, but i didnt want to.  so one of the floats stops because a little kid fell off and got his foot ran over....my Aunt Ruth told me to go check it out to make sure it wasnt Marie, i saw no point b/c Marie's float was 5 floats behind this one....so i check and its a little boy, but he was fine he started walkin around that same night....so about my trip, i liked it, i saw a lot of hot girls up there and one of them gave me her number!

      Well, when i think about it, im the kind of person who wants to do a lot with my friends, but sometimes, my friends dont want to do a lot with me, but no matter how hard they try, they cant hide it from me.  But hey, dont feel bad for me, as long as i have GOD and myself, no one can stop me from doing what i want to do.  and when people talk about me, it hurts of course, i wouldnt be human if it didnt hurt.  sometimes i think about what would've happened if i didnt make it when i passed out or i didnt make it through a lot of the stuff i have to go through.  some advice, dont ever think like me and dont ever think ur me!
