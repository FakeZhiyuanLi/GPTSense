       I found drivers for this cheap printer on this site :   urlLink http://203.111.45.57/bj/i250linux/  (CANON NEW ZELAND)  and downloaded the following:      bjfiltercups-2.3-0.i386.rpm     bjfilteri250-2.3-0.i386.rpm     guidei250-2.3-0.tar.gz    install rpm with YaST as usual and unpack the last package cause this is the guide! then, always in YaST, go to "hardware"(on left), "printer"(on right) and add your printer!    It WORKS WOW!!!!!    urlLink

       First of all, if you installed the SuSE personal like me, you should change the source installation!  Do this :      open YaST     from left pannel choose "software" and from right choose "change installation source"     click "add" button and choose ftp or http and fill the form using a  urlLink SuSE mirror       then disable the cd source and enable the source just added (dont enable more than one source or YaST will freeze when you will add packet choosin "install/uninstall packets")      Now we can install Gaim with his dependancies. For installing using an rpm go to  urlLink guru.linuxbe.org , download gaim and install it wit YaST!  EASY SuSE!! I love it.

       I'm still curious about what happened to my SuSE and still angry about that! Now I'm a little bit scared cause I think that if this happen when I'll have data on disk, I'll be lost! But let think over.... =D  I reinstalled also mozilla but, this time, I choosed the version without the installer and it worked on the first start... I HIGHLY reccomend it. These are the operation I've done to install firefox via terminal:  download from site ( obvious! =D) mkdir /opt/mozilla mv /home/-user-/Desktop/firefox*.tar.gz /opt/mozilla/ ungzip firefox*.tar.gz tar -xvf firefox*.tar ln -s /opt/mozilla/firefox/firefox /home/-user-/Desktop/firefox  then you can apply the icon in kde! thats all!  bye antonio

SIGH!! ='[ well ... I can do it! I launch firefox from shell so I can see messages and resolve the problem:  Xlib:connection to ":0.0" refused by server Xlib:XDM authorization key matches an existing client! (firefox-bin:13607):Gtk-WARNING ** cannot open display  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! what should I do now? let's do a google search and... bingo! here the solution!

(dont write this line on shell =D) xhost - (switch on X authorization)  next operations: language pack and flash player!  gotta go! bye...

       hello, yesterday I putted on my  ASUS L3500 laptop  the last linux  SUSE 9.1  and it was great and easy. Since now I think this is the best linux version for beginners (and I am a beginner, ofcourse =D). For long time I wanted to do this change but I was full of job and I couldnt but, at least, here I am!  I'm on my linux desktop now and I'm starting to install all application I need for work and live better on my pc.
