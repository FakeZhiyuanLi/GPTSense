      Tonight has been slightly more productive than the last...  A few days ago I was infected with some nasty spyware that no program nor my own tinkering could remove so, being paranoid about spyware, I reformatted my computer. Unfortunately, I couldn't find my copy of Windows 2000 Professional, so I had to use Windows XP Home instead. I got sick of that pretty fast. Anyway, tonight I found my CD and reformatted once more, this time putting 2000 Professional back on, so things are back to normal.  Other than that, tonight I watched a movie called "Waking the Dead" on  urlLink The Space Channel 's weekly Friday Frightmare. The movie is anything but frightening however, it had me in tears reaching for the Kleenex box. Definately worth watching. It got me thinking about my relationship with Amelia and I've come to the decision to stay with her and attempt the dinner. If things don't improve afterwards then it'll have to end, but I have to try.  Also, tonight we had a thunderstorm, the first big one of the summer. It was great, I opened my windows and turned out my lights to watch it. I love the sound of the rain and watching the lightning, though it would have been much more enjoyable had I someone to cuddle with at the time.  It's pretty late now... I've been staying up later and later each night, causing me to sleep in more and more. I'm getting into my nocturnal habit again as I usually do in the summer. I've also been neglecting MSN far too much the past couple days. I've been ignoring Kat, pretty much the only person that ever wants to talk to me, and I feel bad about that.  I guess I'll wrap this up here then.

      Well last night was a new low point...   Canada Day, the much celebrated day of the year and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. While everyone else was out with their friends, their significant others, I sat here alone. My girlfriend already had plans and it's not like any of my other few friends would ever think to invite me to hang out. Around 1:00 in the morning when a friend came online telling me about how great her night was, I had enough and went to bed, sleeping in until 2:00 PM. At least I got the house to myself, my mom was with her boyfriend the whole night.   I've spent most of today just moping around the house, being generally unproductive. Watching TV, playing games, ignoring MSN. I havn't been feeling very social lately, I've just been immersing myself in Freelancer and trying to forget about everything else. Not working as of yet.   Last night I was talking with Kat and came to the decision I was going to dump Amelia, but the more I think about it the more I have second thoughts. I'm not sure why... Perhaps because then I'll be left with nothing, perhaps there's still hope in me it'll all work out. I havn't even talked to her in two days, I have no idea how she feels.

      Another day, another post. Today will hopefully be more eventful. My mom is going to some event with her boyfriend and won't be back until tomorrow so as soon as she leaves I'll have the house to myself. A popular person would probably do something like throw a party, but of course that's not me.   Amelia and I talked yesterday for a bit... She suggested we end the relationship... I was kind of shocked. I mean if she supposedly loves me, why would she even bring something like that up? I don't know what to think anymore... This is just so frustrating. The same thing keeps happening over and over again in all my relationships, my girlfriend never has enough time for me. A day or two a week, is that too much to ask? I just want someone I can cuddle with... Someone I can care for without always missing them... But it always ends up the same.   I'm thinking of cancelling the dinner, though the plans havn't even been made yet. At earliest it would be sometime next week... That's another week during which I can't see Mia. I keep telling myself that all I have to do is wait a little longer and it'll all be okay... But I did that exact same thing before summer started and things only got worse. How long am I supposed to keep waiting?

      Well I talked to Mia, she can't go to the movies... No big surprise there. Soonest I can see her is next week sometime at the dinner. Tomorrow she's going to a Canada Day parade. She's working though, so I won't be able to see her.

      Hey there. I actually missed posting yesterday, mainly because I never thought about it. Nothing exciting happened anyway though, I played Freelancer pretty much all day.   I still havn't gone to the movies with Mia, nor heard from her at all... I asked her on Monday if we could see a movie and she said not that night, but probably tomorrow or Wednesday she could. Well now it's Wednesday... No phone call, no message on MSN, nothing. But isn't this how it always is for me? The forgotten boyfriend, brushed aside for more important things. I know she can't really help it, but will things really change after I meet her parents? Things were supposed to change when summer came. I was supposed to be able to see her almost every day, all day, but that never happened.  Lately I've stopped saying those three words, "I love you", to Mia. I realized I never meant them in the first place and only started saying them in response to when she said them to me so it wouldn't be awkward. I care about her, but how am I supposed to love someone I can never see? How can I believe she really loves me? I can't and am certainly not willing to make that kind of attachment yet the way things are. If things don't change after the dinner... Well, this is her final chance.   Anyway... Tomorrow is Canada Day I think... July 1st right? Well, Ally is visiting from Ft. Macmurray for about 15 days starting tomorrow. She's a good friend I've known for a while and it'll be nice to finally meet her. We both want to have at least one date before she has to leave, maybe more depending on how things go. It won't be anything serious of course, I'm still in a relationship with Mia, but we're close friends... it would be nice to get to cuddle...  More to come... whenever.

      Another late night. There will be quite a few of those now that it's summer, not like I have any plans.   I saw the movie and it was good, though I already knew it would be having seen it before. There was a VERY annoying kid in the row of seats behind us who talked through the whole movie despite his mother's attempts at quieting him. At any point of even minor humour in the film he'd laugh like  urlLink Elmer Fudd , it was so annoying. The kid sounded like he was 14 but he acted like a 6 year old, I wanted to stand up, turn around, and tell him off so badly. But of course, that's not the type of person I am.   When I got home I order pizza for supper. I was supposed to call Amelia but I was a bit nervous about it... I'm terribly shy on the phone so I don't like using it and was also nervous that her mom would answer. She's always the one to call me. I tried her cell rather than her house phone but got no answer and gave up with that.  I've been playing Freelancer for most of the rest of the night, and chatting with Kat of course. I talk to her so much more than anyone else, she's always there for me. Natalie came on briefly, another friend of mine in the USA, but barely long enough for us to exchange hello's. I've known her for a couple years and we're close friends, though we've kind of drifted apart lately. Kat's started to take her place, though Natalie still knows quite a bit more about me than anyone else.  That's about all for now I guess. Goodnight.

      Back again, I'm probably going to see a movie in a little bit. My mom wants to see  urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  and invited me along so I'm going. I've seen it already but it's good so I don't mind a repeat.   I've been talking to Kat most of the afternoon, now Amelia. I might be going to a movie with Mia tomorrow, she's not sure yet. I had to bug about it though...&nbsp;Makes me feel sort of like I'm annoying her. I just miss her so much I want to see her whenever I can, but it's difficult...   Anyway, my mom is home now so I better go get ready to go to the theatre.

      Not much happening today as predicted. I slept in until about 11 and as usual immediately went to the computer. I've got chores today, lots of chores... Right now I'm talking to Kat, a friend of mine in the US. We met a little while ago and tell each other pretty much everything.   Amelia came online last night before bed and we talked for a while, it was really nice. I suggested an interesting idea to her and she accepted. Being a gamer, naturally I'm doing that 90% of the time so I figured it would be fun to have her join in. I offered Freelancer to her and she's going to try it out. It'll be a great way for us to bond more, though perhaps create a little stress from friendly competition.  Back to MSN...

      Well it's nearing the end of the day and I figured I'd do a final post. I'm going to try and keep this up to date rather than neglecting it like I've done with all my other web logs.   I played some Freelancer, watched some TV, the same old stuff. Amelia called around 2'ish and we talked for a while, it was nice hearing her voice again, I really miss her. She was supposed to come online after cleaning her room, but after waiting for 7 hours I don't think that'll happen. Tomorrow will likely be much of the same. I'm looking forward to a time when I can see Amelia more often, hopefully it'll be possible after the dinner. We might be going to see a movie this week if she's allowed to go.  That's all, back to the TV and then to bed.

      *Yawn* Awake once more. My mom's home now, she had gone to church. She's doing it because her current boyfriend is religious and what not. Today's plans most likely include chatting on MSN and playing  urlLink Freelancer . Possibly time for a meal somewhere in there. Now that it's summer I don't have much reason to leave the house anymore so things get pretty boring. I'm contemplating taking up coding again.  There's no set date yet, but I'll probably be having dinner with Amelia's parents sometime in the near future. Amelia and I are sort of in a relationship... We were but I broke up with her because it looked like I wouldn't get to see her all summer. It was a rushed decision and I regret it. Her parents aren't too enthusiastic about her dating, moreso if they knew I'm over 3 years older than her, so that poses scheduling problems... Her mom suggested that if she invited me to dinner I might get her approval, and thus she'd be able to date. The problem is I have to appear at most 15, but I'm up to it.  Sometime this week, or perhaps next depending on when I feel like it, I'll be going to see  urlLink Spiderman 2 . I liked the first one, mainly for the love vs. duty theme, and the second looks much better. After that I'll probably see  urlLink I, Robot , It looks pretty cool.  Time for some gaming.

      Hmm, not a lot to put down now, just breaking it in. I'm probably going back to bed for a bit... So happy school's out, though I'd be home anyway since it's Sunday. I've been meaning to start another one of these for a while and finally decided to. More to come later.

      Today is my brother's birthday, and I'm pleased to see it's not any more eventful than mine was. No cake with candles, no gift giving session, no fancy dinner. Just like mine. Oh wait, actually I forgot the part where he's out right now partying and getting drunk with all his friends... I guess that's one thing I never got to do, lacking any friends that gave a damn.  Moving right along... Tomorrow is the dreaded BBQ. I already made it quite clear to my mom that I don't want to go and that I'll be miserable and antisocial. She's worried it might rain, well I'll have my own little storm cloud with me in any case. I hate how she always makes me go to these things, I don't know nor do I  want  to know her friends.  Today was pretty boring. Slept in until about 1 I think, had some pretty nice dreams though I forget most of them. I spent the afternoon on my computer as usual and I talked with Kat for a couple hours. Tonight got a bit more eventful. My brother bought himself an X Box so I got to try it out. I'm not a big fan of consoles though, I prefer the computer.  One of my ex's decided tonight that after a month or so of not talking to me she'd come online and start telling me about her new boyfriend, after assuring herself that my love life is in shambles. She must get kicks out of it or something, whilst making me feel even worse than I already do.   Still not sure what to do about Amelia... I keep changing my mind. I want it to work, but in the meantime I'm being an awful boyfriend. I'm afraid she's just going to dump me, but I feel like I deserve it anyway. I'm trying to make plans again with Ally... I know it's wrong, I know exactly how things will go if I see her again and it's not fair to Amelia. I just hate being alone all the time...

      Yesterday was quite eventuful... and confusing.   Ally and I made plans the day before to hang out. I got up early around 7 AM and went to meet her at noon. We came back here and things got pretty cozy... Lots of cuddling and kissing... and then at 6 we went to see Spiderman 2. Afterwards my brother drove her home, her and I cuddling in the back seat, and I got home around 11. This sounds all good but I'm still kind of in a relationship with Amelia... Ally will only be in town until the 21st so there won't be anything long term but it's still&nbsp;cheating...  Amelia and I talked a bit after I got home and she told me the dinner has been put off for another week, so once again I have to wait. I told her about how I was losing my feelings for her, having been apart so long, and she was surprised at that. She told me she still had feelings for me. I told her about the date because I felt guilty, though I didn't go into details... I'm not sure how she feels about that.   I might be seeing Ally again on Sunday... This isn't fair to Amelia, I'm not sure what to do... I want a relationship with Amelia but she keeps me waiting and in the mean time I want someone I can be with...

      Been a couple days, I know, I've been slacking.  Empire Earth has been keeping me busy the past little while, though I'm pretty much done with it now. After a few 6 hour games it's lost its appeal pretty quickly. Probably for the best, I've still been ignoring MSN more than I should be. Sorry Kat!  I talked to Amelia about 2 days ago and things seem pretty much back to normal. We solidified our plans for this week, though it's still undecided whether it will be on Thursday or Friday. After coming out of my slight bout of depression I realized I had almost let go of the one thing that still makes me happy, my relationship with Amelia, and I'm now determined more than ever to hold on to it.  Tomorrow, or to be more accurate since it's past midnight, today, my brother is flying in from Toronto. He'll be staying a week for his birthday which is on Friday. I havn't gotten him anything, I'll probably just give him cash for booze, same as last year. He's always in need of that.  Ally's in town now, she'll be here practically all month. We might go see a movie together this weekend, I might finally get to see Spiderman 2. Money will be kind of tight this week. I told Ally it would be my treat, so there goes $20 for her and myself at the movie. I'll probably give my brother $50, and I want to buy Amelia a little something for when I visit her place so there's another $20. Considering I'm living off a small allowance, that's a lot for me to spend. Oh well, my mom owes me $100 come this Friday...  I should really be going to bed now, I have to get up in 4 hours to get ready for when we go to pick up Chris from the airport. We'll be taking a white Hummer my mom rented for the day, a present for Chris though she's still undecided as to whether or not she'll let him drive it.   So yeah... Bed. Soon anyway, I'm still a bit restless. More things need doing first.

      Saturday... Just another boring day. Not much happened yesterday, just socialized online a bit and played some games. I slept in until about 2 PM, not intentionally, so of course I was up all night wide awake.  &nbsp;  I got the chance to talk to Karli a few times... She's so amazing. I'm starting to feel like she's a bit out of my league though... Me, the reclusive, antisocial computer geek, going on a date with an intelligient, beautiful, popular girl... Oh, and did I mention she's a millionaire? Her father is anyway, he owns some video company. I don't even have a job, it's a bit intimidating... Suddenly treating her to a movie isn't that special anymore. I have no idea how this'll work out, she seems like a really active, social person, which is the opposite of me. I'll give it a shot though, I really like her and just can't pass up this oppertunity. Anyway, she's probably on her way back to Edmonton now, she gets home today.  &nbsp;  No set date yet as to when we'll meet yet. I think I want to wait a bit longer, maybe a week. I just don't want it to turn out like my date with Bree a while ago... I met her, we liked each other, and within a few days we went to the movies. It ended so badly, I was really shy and barely said anything the whole time because I was too nervous around her. Not like she tried to help at all though... She brought a friend who she talked to constantly, ignoring me anyway. I hope she doesn't mind waiting a bit longer. I really like her, I just don't want to screw this up...  &nbsp;  Today promises to be as boring as every other day, moreso since Karli will probably be hanging out with her friends tonight so I won't get to talk to her. The land lords are coming by today, anytime now actually, to inspect the house. Make sure we havn't trashed the place, aren't growing marijuana plants or housing illegal immigrants, that kind of thing. So of course my mom had me cleaning the entire place in preperation...  &nbsp;  Aside from that, there's not much to say. I'm kind of sick today, I threw up a little while ago. Not pleasant at all. I'll probably take a nap or something once the land lords come and go. I guess I brought it upon myself though, drinking that awful Kahlua last night. It was about 4 AM and I was restless in bed, so I decided to pour myself a glass of my mom's booze. That stuff is so horrible, I don't know why she likes it. It got the job done though; once it started kicking in I had no problem dozing off. I didn't even wake up about 3 hours later when my mom put Maxx on my bed (the puppy). So yeah, not something I'll be doing again soon. I hate alcohol, but sometimes it helps with things... I've never actually been drunk, but I've been tipsy twice now and it's not that impressive.

      I'm pretty sure Amelia just dumped me... and I deserve it of course. She asked about my date with Ally, I had told her of it once before just not the details. She wasn't too happy with what I had to tell her... So she yelled at me, blocked me, and now I feel miserable. I'm going to keep that date with Karli and see where that goes. I just want somebody I can be with damnit...

      Not much news except the thing with Karli seems to be a bust. I was checking out the comments on her profile and apparently she has another guy waiting for her to get back so they can get together... They were both flirting back and forth a lot, suggestions of cuddling and more... I guess I shouldn't be surprised, she's 14 afterall. I'm going to call off the date.

      The spaces between posts are growing... I keep forgetting about this thing. Anyway, a bit has happened since the last one...   I met a new girl only a couple hours after that entry, her name is Karli. She made a post on the Nexus forums looking for a certain type of guy and I replied. She sent me a comment and we've been talking since. She seems to be interested in me, but I'm being cautiously optimistic... She wouldn't be the first 14 year old to break my heart. She seems okay though and I'm starting to really like her. She's visiting relatives in Seattle until Saturday, so we might meet when she gets back. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing I'd like more right now than to have someone I could cuddle with, especially someone as cute as she, just it's never that simple... I'm after a long term relationship, not a date or two, so I'm going to get to know her better first.  Aside from that there's not much that's noteworthy... the BBQ was long and boring, and so was the rest of my weekend. My brother is returning to Toronto tomorrow evening, thankfully. Dinner plans with Amelia are still up in the air, she can't decide when she'll be available. I'll give her another week...   Ally had to go back to Ft. Macmurray early, she sprained her wrist and her father wanted her back because of that or something. Kind of cruel how the best date I've ever had was with her and now fate has made it so there will be no second.  That's all...

      It's thursday evening now and I'm depressed to say that nothing new has happened since my last post almost a week ago. Eat, sleep, chat... That's been the usual lately.  I talked with Karli a few times more, though less in the last couple days. I think perhaps she's losing interest in me. Probably for the best if she is, I'm a horrible boyfriend anyway. Right now she's off on another trip.  I also talked with Amelia once or twice since the break up... She's still mad at me, as I would expect her to be. I told Ally today that I had been already dating someone during the time we spent together. She says she's not mad, and claims&nbsp;she still wants to see me again but she's just busy.  So here I am, bored and alone as usual. It seems I'm pretty much left with nothing now. I craved to be with someone so much that&nbsp;I wrecked my relationship with Amelia for a single day with Ally, and now I probably won't see either again. I guess it doesn't matter, I wasn't happy with Amelia anyway... I had much more fun that day with Ally than I had ever had with Amelia, and in that one day I spent more time with Ally than my combined time with Amelia. That's how a real relationship should be... Too bad it only lasted one day...

      Amelia and I are back together! For once, I am happy. I thought about it and figured out what I wanted, and that's her. I asked her if we could try again... and she said yes, if I'm willing to try hard enough to make this work. So tomorrow her and I are going to K-Days together! I'm so happy... I get to hold her again. One thing I really want to do tomorrow is go on the ferris wheel with her when it gets nice and dark out so we can cuddle... *sigh*

      This weekend has been good I guess, in that the entire time I've had the house to myself. Gets pretty lonely though.  I've been thinking constantly about Amelia lately...&nbsp;I'm not sure what I want anymore... I thought I wanted Amelia back, and so I tried that in a way... I told her I missed her and wished we were still together... She invited me to come along with her to K-Days tomorrow, as a friend... But then I got scared and told her nevermind. I could go, I could see her again... I want to do more than see her though. To be there as her friend, that close to her and not able to hold her hand, or kiss her lips, or put my arms around her, would kill me inside. Even if I could, even if we got back together, it would probably end up the same. I'm not even sure if I really have feelings for her or if I'm just desperate. I'm just afraid of getting hurt again, or hurting her more than I already have.  Karli has kind of left the picture. Since she left Edmonton again a few days ago I havn't heard from her. She's probably forgotten about me already. Ally won't see me again, but I don't care, I don't want to see her anymore.  So... I'm living the single life again. No girlfriend, nobody interested in me. Seems pretty bleak. Bree came on MSN yesterday looking for anyone to make out with and I actually asked her about it. Then&nbsp;I told her nevermind. Then I asked again. Yes, I'm definately desperate.&nbsp;I just want somebody to hold...

      Well it's final, there's no chance of ever getting back Amelia.  She sent me an email today in reply to the one I sent her a few days ago. She said I wasn't being honest with her by hiding that I was unhappy with our relationship and that I had led her on by pretending not to be. Well I'm a little confused here... because in my mind, someone who sticks with you when things are rough is someone who truely cares about you. Should I have cut and run at the first sign of trouble? I really cared about her so I put up with it. My mistake. But on the other hand, I couldn't put up with it enough not to cheat, so I guess I'm not that person. I guess this is just karma catching up with me.  The night's been pretty good aside from that actually. It's kind of nice to have it finalized like that, I can stop worrying. She made it clear she never wants to talk to me again. After our exchange of emails, I decided to contact an old friend, Stacey. I don't know why... I added her, then deleted her, then added her once more before getting the courage to message her. I guess I just needed to talk to a friend, and nobody else was on. Well I'm glad I messaged her, we had a nice conversation. Stacey is the second girl I've ever dated, we went out for a month before seperating. It was my decision, and now that I look back on it, it seems pretty stupid, but things are back to normal now and it's nice to have her back as a friend.  The only other thing of note is that I helped interpret for two people on an IRC channel. I can't take all the credit though, I had the help of  urlLink Babel Fish . Now I'm talking to Natalie, apparently she had a great night too.  So off I go...

      Today started out rough but got better.  The morning sucked, simple as that. After I pulled myself together I tried giving Amelia a call, unfortunately her cell was off. Then I remembered that last week she volunteered at the farm for a few days and got home Thursday night, so maybe she did the same thing this week... Which makes me wonder if she got any of my messages at all. If I can get the courage again, I'll try and give her a call tomorrow. What's the worst that can happen, she refuses to talk to me? It wouldn't be much of a change.  Besides that my evening was dull, but kind of nice. I just relaxed and watched TV, cuddled with my puppy Maxx for a while, and surfed  urlLink Nexopia . Last night I posted two new pictures to my profile ( urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ) so I've been eager to see what kind of response they'll get. Nothing big yet, but Bree decided to talk to me today after weeks of silence. Hmm, I wonder why? Heheh. I'm not interested, but it's nice to know the pictures have that effect.  Hmm, what else... Oh yeah, I trimmed my contact list yesterday. I decided I don't like knowing lots of people, so I removed all but my closest friends. I keep a pretty tight social circle... I went from 30+ to 5. Kat, Natalie, Joey, Patrick, and Amelia. Kat and Natalie are my closest friends, they live in the US. Joey lives in Floriday, we used to work on a game project together, and Patrick is a buddy of mine in BC. Depending on how things go with Amelia, that list might be getting smaller very soon.  That's about it. I should probably go to bed now, I've been trying to get my schedule somewhat back on track. The past two nights I've gone to bed after my mom leaves for work in the morning at 6:30 AM. Oh yeah, I get some cash tomorrow so I might go see a movie this weekend. I'll most likely be going alone; aside from Amelia there's nobody I want to go with.  Off to bed...

      Things just get worse and worse...  I woke up crying this morning from a dream I had about Amelia. I had dreampt that another guy had gone out with her and was bragging about how he'd used her. I just can't deal with this, I can't stop thinking about her and every time I do I start to cry... I want her back so badly, I miss her so much, but she won't even talk to me... I don't know what to do anymore. I want to call her so badly... But I sent her a final text message saying I'd stop bugging her... I don't want to become stalkerish, I just want to talk to her again so much... I think I might love her...

      Things have been especially dull and depressing lately.  Ally messaged me this morning asking for my profile name, so I re-added her to my contact list. Not like I have to worry about cheating anymore. Turns out she has a new boyfriend.  I talked to Karli today briefly before getting brushed off again. If she had any less interest in me she'd be ignoring me outright. I guess I didn't respond fast enough to her interest so she moved on, I was just her flavour of the week. She's lost any trust I once thought of giving her.  I sent Amelia a text message earlier today, no reply. I still havn't heard from her since she broke up with me over MSN. I find it kind of unfair how when I dumped her, she demanded I do it in person, yet now that our roles are reversed she won't do that for me.  So obviously things aren't going well for me... Everything keeps reminding me of Amelia and all I want to do is just cry and cry... it hurts so much losing her... For once I was actually happy and I was starting to loosen up around her, then she went and destroyed that. I thought I almost loved her.

      Girls suck.  So I had the best date I've ever had that night with Amelia at K-Days. I thought things were back to normal, and even that things might work out well after all. Apparently Karli still had interest in me. Determined not to cheat again, I told her about my relationship with Amelia, immediately losing that interest. I even deleted every girl on my contact list within a 500km radius, including Ally whom I havn't spoken to since. But what's it matter, I got the girl back right?  Two days ago Amelia dumped me. Again.  She came online so I greeted her, and got a pretty dull response. I asked if she wasn't feeling talkative, and then being affirmed I asked why. She told me she had read this journal, and copy and pasted a block of text for me to read.    "So here I am, bored and alone as usual. It seems I'm pretty much left with nothing now. I craved to be with someone so much that I wrecked my relationship with Amelia for a single day with Ally, and now I probably won't see either again. I guess it doesn't matter, I wasn't happy with Amelia anyway... I had much more fun that day with Ally than I had ever had with Amelia, and in that one day I spent more time with Ally than my combined time with Amelia. That's how a real relationship should be... Too bad it only lasted one day..."     - Thursday, July 22, 2004    Now let me explain a few things. July 22, 7 days after being dumped by Amelia, I made this post. I said that I wasn't happy with Amelia, and that I had much more fun with Ally, which up until K-Days was absolutely true. But 3 days later we got back together, the next day we had an awesome date, and suddenly I was happy again. Does that matter? No. She told me I had "led her on" and that this was my third strike, then said goodbye and blocked me. I sent her an email to which I've had no reply, she hasn't spoken to me since.

      It's been so lonely lately... I feel like I'll be stuck single again forever. I'm down to about 2 friends who talk to me - Natalie and Kat. I've given up on Karli, she went on vacation for the rest of the month, and Ally and I don't talk anymore. I got bored and decided to try and make some new friends so I browsed Nexus for a while, posting comments on some girl's profiles. No replies...
