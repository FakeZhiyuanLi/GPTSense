      So I "hemmed and hawwed" (who made up that cliche?) for a while then called up the Friesan Family. I talked with them a bit and found out where their needs were... Dude, this awesome family has 5 (yes five) children out with them on the mission field! Their biggest need is for help with the home schooling, Not something I've ever participated in before, but that's never stopped me before!    So les, how is it a mission trip if you're just homeschooling?   another really good question! There are so many people involved with missions and reaching people, and each member of a team is a "link in the chain".   les... you seem to have a problem with cliches today  yes, it's seems as though I've found something that works for the moment... I think I'll run with it for a while.   back to the answer... Wycliffe Bible translators... the name pretty much sums them up don't you think? www.wycliffe.ca  urlLink   check them out for the whole summation. So, there is a need for the Bible to be translated into MANY MANY languages... can you believe that? That TODAY there are still close to 3,000 languages groups that haven't got the word of God in their hands!!!! There are people who haven't heard God's promises to them in their mother tongue.....ever. There are languages out there that still don't have written word....period. whoa.... hard to take in. I heard one story about a project where a national said something to the effect of "God didn't come for my people, He came only for those who could speak His language". WHOA, we've GOT to get on this! People are dieing and not hearing the word of God.... can you imagine? TODAY this is happening people! So, what goes into translating a language? SO MUCH! There's the most obvious, the most visible, those who are trained in linguistics... directly in the field, working with nationals. Then there are SO many more behind them! There are the office people sorting data that's brought in, there are the teachers who train those going to the field, there are those who are surveying the needs for other languages (will one translation make do for two dialects?), there are nationals in training to take part in the work of translations, There are people running the conference centres where the other missionaries and nationals train, there are people who sort out the details of missionaries returning on furlough, there are people finding plane tickets, there are people running training centres here, there are people teaching the children of the missionaries in the field (THAT'S ME!!!!!) and then there are the financial supporters of all these people.... without any of these... if one part was missing, nothing would happen.  So, like you I get to be a link in the chain... supporting in some way, if only to give back a few minutes in the day to hard working (and overworked!) missionaries out in the field....   les, what are the people you'll be working with/for doing over in Togo?   that my dear friend I'll tell you later... I've got to run

      so, i've decided that by not having internet at home-this whole updating the blog is a little difficult. but you'll all be happy to know that i do really have a computer in my possession now, old as it may be, it's functioning and that's all that's necessary. today i called doug lindsay (one of the awesome wycliffe dudes in toronto) about looking into ticket costs for togo. lol, in writing this i just remembered that i was to email him tonight with some info... consider it done. i have to admit that i really haven't been as organized as i have been in the past. however, this time it's alot different. it's like a "create your own adventure" book. instead of everything being layed out for me, an agenda handed over, or even a list of "do's and don'ts in your preparation", i'm to figure it all out on my own. which is probably good, because i know i tend to lean pretty heavily on my supports, something like this is really going to streach me. if i was given a list i'd just plod right through it and give no thought to the workings, or even my purpose in going.   hey les, what is the purpose of this trip? you never did say.  well well, let me let you in on the details! I LOVE JESUS, I love to tell people about Jesus, I love to travel, and I love to enable people to reach their full potential.... that pretty much sums me up right there... ok, you can add in that I can be a real cranky pants at times, and... ok, well lets not go into the workings of me too much right here right now. Anyway, those are my passions, so missions are something that I've become pretty passionate about. For awhile now I've been in contact with a pretty cool family (Rose and Roy Tibbit) in Ptbo, who have been putting a bug in my ear about Wycliffe Bible Translators... not too long ago I really felt God was putting on my heart that I should be getting active again in short term projects, so I called up Rose and explained what was on my heart.  I want to be able to serve in a capacity that will enable people who are trained for a certain job... to do their job! I don't want to be a "make work project" (that's been my mantra for a few months now) I don't want to go somewhere, take the full time missionaries away from their job while they spend time training me to do a job that they could do ten times faster on their own, just to have me leave as I start to catch on... and yes, there are good intentions out there from people who want "hands on, make a difference in the field right now". But really, it's a lot of stress on the full timers, and it can take up a lot of their MUCH sought after time! Instead, I want to do the ho-hum, doldrums work that I can just pick up and run with, or anything that is tying up the missionaries keeping them from completing the most pressing tasks... filing? tutoring? licking envelopes? answering the phone? copying data?? I don't really care, as long as it frees them up to get out in the field and do what they are trained to do!!!! So, that aside, Rose laughed and said "isn't God funny?" and went on to say that she had just received an email (or maybe it was a report from a meeting?) outlining the need for someone to do just that... relieve the load... helping with homeschooling!!! Dude, I have never been a homeschooler, but I knew that I had to get into contact with that family. getting late, I'll tell you more tommorow.

      Ah, a new day. This morning I was woken by my alarm clock, I've set it back to the radio. I thought for awhile that I'd enjoy listening to a favorite CD to wake up... but there doesn't seem to be a way to change the song choice... I can only listen to the same song so many mornings in a row... flash backs of Groundhog Day greet me as I wake.... BUT I don't get any of the stations that I'd like to hear in the morning so that leaves me (mostly) foul. Back to my story. I woke up, hit the snooze button.woke up, hit the snooze button. woke up, hit the snooze button. then there was a knock at my door! funny as my room mate doesn't talk to people in the morning, then I remembered, "hey, my room mate isn't here, who's knocking on my door?" I'd forgotten that my friend Amanda has moved in for the two weeks while Sarah is away. (Hey Sarah, Amanda is staying over in the sun room while you're gone... I hope that's cool) HOW FUNNY to have a morning person in the house with me!!! She was much more awake than I was but had to share a story about a terrible dream she had (no, I won't give the details, someone might think that it was true). I hope that it wasn't the room giving her the bad dreams.... or the trains.... I only counted 3 trains last night before I fell asleep, and none of them blew their whistles. So good. I'm used to being the morning person. I plan on doing NOTHING this evening. Is that being anti-social?

      Now people are going to think that I've started a cooking business... or even a recipe site... nope, sorry to dissapoint you.. the parsley (of course) comes from a little run in with a young lady named Jaymie... Jaymie sat in the back of her mother's car one day desperatly trying to remember my name... from the back of the car I hear "umm, parsley, will you play barbies with me?" end of story...

      so I learned a new word this morning, and with it opened all new ideas of, well, really, just how amazing our world really is.&nbsp;&nbsp;     ethnomusicologist  :  &nbsp;Main Entry: eth·no·mu·si·col·o·gy  urlLink  Pronunciation: "eth-nO-"myü-zi-'kä-l&-Function: noun1 : the study of music that is outside the European art tradition&nbsp;   2 : the study of music in a sociocultural context-   eth·no·mu·si·co·log·i·cal  urlLink  /-k&-'lä-ji-k&amp;l/ adjective- eth·no·mu·si·col·o·gist  urlLink  /-'kä-l&-jist/ noun&nbsp;   &nbsp;now, how then does this word show me that we live in such an amazing world? The fact that we can specialize in some of the neatest things (in this example music and ethnicity- a study in anthro) and get payed for it!( ethnomusicologist in action  urlLink here .)&nbsp;(Not only that, but the person from this example is a christian... so throw in so thology for good measure.... whoa baby!)   ug, again I've realised that I've got entirely too much work to keep typing... grrr  &nbsp;

      Well, I think that things are coming together a little bit more for the trip....&nbsp; I say that after actually accomplishing a few needed items (ie. buying tickets) but then I get this rush of panic, because I know there's still SO much to do!  So this week, with the much appreciated help of Mike M. (fianced to Laur W.!) I got some tickets to Togo. It's a little bit of a round about way&nbsp;to get there, but it helped save a couple hundred bucks so it's well worth it. The official date of departure is  September 22nd  (PRAISE GOD! it's not Sept 11th... not that there was really anything wrong with it, but it kinda gave me the heeby-jeebies) From Toronto I'll head to Frankfurt (Germany)&nbsp;from there, Addis (Ethiopia) then backtrack to Lome (Togo). Then I'll chill in Lome for a day or so and hit the dirt to Kara where the Wycliffe/Sil centre is.  *grrr*  I just realized that I have work to do.

      On Saturday morning I went out to Norty's cage.. to play with him and squish him... The night before I had heard my neighbors screaming at the side of the house... Not in terror or anything like that, and not threateningly at eachother (which has been happening a lot lately, the other day I was on the phone with my co-worker Roy, and he could hear them swearing at eachother over the phone, he recommended calling the cops... Just for fun) Anyway, I think I figured out why they were screaming.. Their scary nasty dog (scary and nasty because he's so stupid and dirty) had been chewing on the rabbit cage! I've&nbsp;built these little privacy flaps on the front of the cage that you can close so that Norty can&nbsp; have some peace/ work as ventilation in the winter when the whole front of the cage is closed.&nbsp; Anyway, Shag-gay (you have to say it like that for the full effect... REALLY, my neighbor has this bad accent) has chewed one of the flaps, bent the hinge and put teeth marks all over it. It's splintered in a few places.&nbsp; So normally I LOVE dogs... I pretend that Nort IS one (he's not so good at the pretending) But I  kicked  Shag- GAY  in the head last week. He was trying to eat my buddy! So how do I approach my neighbor? That's the question of the day.   Wondering if I'll ever get my plane tickets. That's the question of the year!   Had a busy weekend. Worked mostly. Enjoyed an evening with the Sheffield's... Megan was home from camp, as was Ian.. They brought home a gaggle of C.H. camp employees, was a great night. Learned to blow smoke rings (I gave in to a soggy cigar). Sunday Lauren and Mike came over on their way back from a wedding. Was so good to see them! They were kept awake by the trains... LOL.  bought chocolate... Think I'll go back to the all chocolate diet that Amanda and I were perfecting.   Only have the garage roof left to shingle. Beth and I are starting early tomorrow, Alicia is helping??? And Al is away.. I think we can get it done fast though, there aren't any valleys or strange things to get in the way.   bon nuit

      Not a pet as in; my dear Norton whom I love to squish and squish ; but as in a pet peeve. I was at church this morning and we sang (as all good pentys do) the same song over and over and over. And that wasn't the thing that was doing the peeving. We were singing " urlLink Blessed Be Your Name " ~a great song by Matt Redman~ when it hit me. So, my biggest peeve (in part)&nbsp;is when worship leaders don't put any effort into the preparation of leading people into worship... HELLO! You're the lead worshipper, we are following your lead, so lead us somewhere.&nbsp; The other side of that is when they pick songs solely based on the fact that they "like the sound of the song" or rather  they like the sound of their own voices singing the song . I'm talking about the ever catchy songs about us, not about God. Aren't we supposed to be worshipping Him? Instead we end up singing songs about how we are responding to Him, or what we are going to do for Him, or what we are going to change, or even grrr...&nbsp; Now. I have to be careful here, because I know that a lot of people have never really thought about it themselves, and have entered into an amazing space in worship even though they were singing their own praises - that's ok, God can use anything, and if your heart is in the "right place", you've honestly intended to be praising Father God... Of course you will be. I think I'm meaning more us toddler/adolescent Christians who should be learning and digging a little further- we aren't babies anymore, we don't need to be so self centered.    I   could sing of Your love forever,   I  've been singing this song forever... And oh   I   feel like singing...It's foolishness   I   know.... But when the world realizes   I' m  still singing about me,   I 'LOL  be singing a new catchy song and they'll never knoooooo-oooowww....&nbsp;   *sigh*   I don't know if that made any sense. Anyway, I'm usually pretty impressed with the Matt songs, and I've been loving "blessed" a lot, I think because I heard it SO much this morning it turned on me   Every blessing you pour out I'll turn back to praise When the darkness closes in Still I will say Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your name Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your glorious name. We were still singing about what we were going to do... What ever happened to the awesome old hymns where we just sang about Jesus and His awesome power?

       So in all honesty this was a rough week. Wednesday (the 14th) marked the one year anniversary of Mom's death. It still seems strange to think about.&nbsp; I get mad that it's been so long since I've seen her ... Frustrated I guess is a better word for it- being mad can't change anything. I just miss my mom!  &nbsp;  But at the same time it's been a pretty  LAZY  week. I took last friday off to go to Wycliffe orientation, then it was my normally scheduled weekend off. Normally scheduled Monday off, I didn't feel like working on Tuesday much so I came in long enough to do my weekly paperwork, eat dinner (mmm, KFC! I didn't have any money left for groceries, so it was perfect!) (no money left because I got a speeding ticket!  *sigh*  )   &nbsp;   side note: I got a speeding ticket. I was pretty upset, because it wasn't at all fair. Right outside of Balibourough (sp?) heading north to Ptbo, there's the 50 sign then maybe 40 meters later (partway up&nbsp;the hill) there's the 80 sign. I drive through the village in 3rd gear everytime so I won't speed. I did so that same day. I pass the 50 sign, and nearing me is the 80km sign, so I start to pick up speed. I drive at 91kmph on hwy 28... That way I'm not really breaking the speed limit, who pulls someone over for doing 11 kms over the limit? And I'm not going too slow to annoy all the drivers behind me- there aren't too many places to pass there.&nbsp; So, I start to pick up speed. Then I notice that there's a cop car parked on the other side of the street  ACROSS   from the 80 kmph sign. I figure "that's a funny place to sit, right out in the open... No one's going to speed there".  THEN  the guy hangs out the window and flags me down!?!! So I pull over... Quite confused, because I wasn't speeding to my knowledge... I was AT the 80 sign when he flagged me. The officer then proceeds to give me a ticket saying I was doing 91 in a 50 zone!!!!!!!!!! WHO DOES THAT????????? Thankfully he lowered it, the cost was going to be over $300, he lowered it to $150ish. Still.... WHO DOES THAT??????!&nbsp; I was so upset... I'm getting all angry again thinking about it. I payed it. Everyone said that I should have contested it but it just made me so mad that I know I'd just stand there in front of the judge and cry... cause that's what I do with every overwhelming emotion.... cry. You get used to it eventually, don't let my crying scare you. End of side note.      &nbsp;   where was I? Oh yeah, so I went into work for 3 hours, then I decided while I was there that I'd take Thursday off, just for a break, and maybe we could get back on the roof and finish the shingles if it was a nice day. So I find a replacement for Thursday and as I write it down on the schedule I realize that I've made a mistake somewhere along the way and taken off July 14th instead of August 14.. Way to go. However, I haven't minded too much the week off.    August 14th yup, that's the next big day in my life coming up (other then Godstock on July 24th... Port Hope mem. park, be there!!!) That's the day of the house concert fundraiser party that the Sheffield's are putting on for me.... . Ninjas and Friends, you're all invited! Featuring the musical talents of Dave Smaird and Josh Martin, and the fine cuisine of Bethfield and moi. I'll post more when I know more!      &nbsp;

      Suddenly a whole new world of blogging has opened to me... I guess I'm not very observant but now I've got  CHOICE   I don't think these options were here.... Maybe I've just hit something by accident? And I don't know that I like it.&nbsp; In fact someone has stolen my font. &nbsp;   I even have a choice in the size I write in....

      Jeepers! I think that time is playing tricks on me, each chance I glance at the clock or my calendar (WHICH I have flipped over thank you very much!) I've lost a day, a week...  PRAY my friends! There's so much going on, and I want so bad to keep up, and do more and see more.... Praise: We have a Good God.. No, we have a GREAT God... nuf said.  Pray: For plane tickets... Right now things aren't as good as I'd hoped.  Praise: An AMAZING and super informative weekend of orientation with  urlLink Wycliffe  absolutely fantastic...   Pray: after that awesome time at orientation, my heart is just aching to go full time...   Praise: No one fell off the roof (yet anyway) while doing the new shingles on Dad's house  Pray: ummm, I'm kind really sore after starting the roof  Praise: The friesian's got to Kara Togo with all their luggage this week!!!!  ok, enough of the lists, I'll get around to the construction on the site so that when you visit prayer and praise will be listed at the sidebar...

      Yes, ninjas.... I love my ninjas... Have I ever told you that before? Well, it's true. What is the significance of a ninja? Well, that lies in the duty of the ninja... I'm talkin' evil-butt-kickers here... ninjas using their most powerful ability to fight evil,  stomping  on satan with powerful meaningful authentic prayer. Yesterday I was in a heated discussion over the definition of "authentic". Needless to say I'm not much of a confrontational person, I'm sure you've seen me back down before, but yesterday I was pretty much ticked. Probably one of my most annoying habits (other than the oft heard "concentration whistle") is the fact that I expect people to be able to read my mind... Sometimes difficult I know because I never follow one line of thought for long, I have to jump back and forth. Everything in the end IS connected, and I just expect that everyone has followed along for the ride. So, that said, I wanted to talk about the end product of a ministry to include "relationships" or rather -the ability to develop relationships that held meaning. So the whole argument included what a meaningful relationship was... Apparently "real relationships" didn't cut it, but "authentic relationships" did. UNTIL an hour later someone started to say that "authentic" wasn't the right word either...  *sigh* What then is "Authentic Prayer"? It's what going to kick satan's butt! Bringing concerns and praise before the throne of God, knowing that He has it all in control, and giving it to Him.... I praise God because if it wasn't for my "prayer ninjas" things would have been super rough while I was working with Watoto ( urlLink click here for more on Watoto ). But because I had people DAILY lifting me up in prayer ~ I survived! ha HA I just figured out how to make links on my page! HOW FUN! ok, that's all for now. Ninjas? Have you started your training?

      It's not as if I haven't been writing all this time. I've been writing, but saved everything as a draft, nothing seemed worthwhile~ to be posted I mean.  Dudes, Saturday night is the   house concert  ! I'm not really sure how that's crept up on me. I don't think I'm really ready, I don't have any of the printed materials I wanted, I haven't really thought much about what I want to say and share... In total I've been a procrastinator of the highest degree. It's been said that I can't really do something right unless I've had a good cry over it.  Let it be said again.  I nearly worked myself into the tizzy that it deserves today, but then I ran into a calming sort of person and got over it. Maybe I can get worked up again tomorrow.  So yes, I've gathered info to wow people with my Togolese knowledge.. LOL I've got to figure out a way to get it in order. ~ maybe make up some "stations" of information? There's some grocery shopping to do, some cooking prepwork, what do I want to share, should probably get in touch with our fine musicians of the evening, I'd like to get those prayer cards done, (ha ha ha, started!) should probably have a copy of my newsletter, need to talk to Rose and Roy about what they think people would enjoy hearing, do I need envelopes? Call Bethfields about "stuffs" needed, ie coffee pots, cutlery etc. There's a lot that goes into this eh? (Tizzy can be felt rising) Finally found some useful info online. Had to go to  urlLink Lonely planet  to get it though. Nothing else was panning out (in English anyway) Cest Ca, you're reading the words of the most English of all the Boileau's ever in history. God grant me the gift of tongues and may it be French. amen
