      I have this love hate relationship with Solitaire. You know, that funny little card game that has come with windows since the dawn of time, or the dawn of windows, those two always seem to blur for me. Anyway. I play it way to much. My second semester in a Canadian High school is boring, on an academic level at least, I get maybe one or two pieces of homework every other week, its ridiculous, in England, you get a piece of homework each class, everyother day, and there's like, six classes a day. Damn you relaxed Canadians, I love you all. So I have a lot of spare time, I waste it away by getting frustrated at solitaire, listening to music, talking to my friends and writing in the book. But always with the solitaire, it just keeps coming back, I don't even remember opening it, but I always find myself halfway through a game missing an Ace with no way to get to it, its stupid. And of course, if I'm asked to do anything out side of the pit of despair that is my room, I have to finish the game of solitaire I'm playing, and if I can't win that one, I have to keep playing till I do. I don't get much sleep.  Damn you Microsoft

      You fear what's behind the door, He's passed out on the floor, Needle in his arm, Blood on his chest. He really doesn't look his best.  Slowly coming to realize, What you saw before was just a cheap disguise, And for a second, You wouldn't mind joining him on the floor,  And imagination dies a little more.   That's an even earlier one, I'm not going to post anything in any type of chronological order for a while, until I run out of back logs. I'm just going to go through and post what I still like the look of.

      Failure to see, Inability to be, You are a guiding light for me. Dying inside, Trying to hide, How you make me feel.  Yeah, thats one from a few weeks back, front page of the book when I first got it. I find it kinda cheesy, but it flows nice, so I thought it would be nice to post.

      I mean, seriously, I have my own webspace with access to my friend's free home grown blogger, why the hell am I using this google thing?  maybe its because nobody knows this is here, and I'll just use this as an updatable spot for my work, which is mainly poetry of some sort.  It's funny, I don't even know what to call what I write, I just refer to it as the writings.  I named my earlier works "The Art of Rambling" or AoR for short, so that's where the blog title comes from.  The book I write in is just some random 300 page A4 notebook on which I have pasted a biohazard symbol, not many of my friends bother to ask what I'm writing, when I don't respond they just assume its a journal of some sort. If you know me, kudos for finding this, and I hope that what I post here gives you a lovely insight to my mind, If you don't know me, feel free to comment.

      Clearly breathing but not alive, In this poor excuse for a show tune, Seething desires behind clockwork fires, made by people who just don't care.  As the smoke is never ending, in the darkness of our minds, The light here is forever fleeting, and we can never see the skies.   If anybody ever cared, I don't title these things when I write them, I give them titles when I post. Slowly, but surly, I'm going to run out of these crappy little writings to post, and then I'll have to talk. Gladly, I don't have a life, so I can't really talk about that, but I'm sure something interesting will present itself for me to talk about.

      Even though your brain seems scarred, And kept behind ageless bars, For solitary is just to good for you. The thoughts that bounce around that cage And keep you in a constant rage, You never even stopped to wonder, where in hell you were. Though peices of your minds desire, wander alone amongst the fire, that burns around the clock through a window in your head. Waves upon your shattered dreams, Where fear lies in between the seams Where reality is begining to come undone.   That's an old one, but it's one of my favorites. Seemingly odd that nobody reads this. Well, maybe the crazy friend. I wodner if I should start linking people.

      Walking through the downtown of your brain, Looking for the store of your dreams, Where the last peice of your sanity is for sale, And you smile over the counter  As I charge it to my heart.  I walked down the highstreet,  Sign posted with your fears, A car that was our friendship just hit a baby deer, The cries are those from your childhood, I tried to help as much as I could. But the cackle of the driver eminates from the hood.  I reach my apartment, Located in your eyes, Today was a grey day, And grey days I dispise,  A sign in the window, Of the window of your smile,  Out of my mind, back in five minutes.  I'm told that one was really good. Of course, I don't believe anybody who says any of this is good. I wrote it in 5 minutes whilst talking over MSN, I don't even have a hard copy, it's just sitting there in my chatlogs.  The crazy friend who says I can sing constantly tells me I should write music and turn these things into songs.  I told you shes crazy.

      Bathe, in these flames, My thoughts, yours for keeping, Still my mind is slowly creeping, Out of my eyes, blind to the lies, That you're weaving, Slowly my mind keeps on creeping.  Eat, taste my flesh, Chew my brain, don't stop feeding, That sound is my soul, gently weeping, Close, shut my ears, Deaf to screams, I'm not hearing, Thats still just my soul, gently weeping.  Fly, turn away, You won't care, I'm still leaving. Thats just my anger, slowly seething. Run, get away, I have gone, you stopped breathing, These are my words that you're reading.  And you and I, We don't know why, It has to die,  We have to try.   So, havn't said anything for a while, life had a bit of an uppy downy type thing going for a few days back there, but I'm back on a constant level of bleh. The best of my few friends said that she liked my singing, I thought she was talking to someone else at the time. Im going to have to put a stop to that, probably over lots of cups of coffee that I have to learn to like, stupid caffine junkie canadians.

      Ah, but dear reader, the question is not who am I? but simply, who are you? You are here, reading these very words, for a reason, known only to yourself. But you must ask yourself, what lasting effect will this collection of works have on you?  Time shall tell.
