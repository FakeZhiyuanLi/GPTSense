                       Music  A band you've never heard of;  urlLink The Oranges Band . An indie rock group outta Baltimore, at least I think they're from Baltimore. Doesn't matter. They make good music and take it on the road, that is their mission in life. Quite frankly, they're worth a listen. Songs of merit include,   urlLink All the Ghosts in Your House  What Got You Off the Hook  urlLink Nextstopexjock    Anyway, here's some junk I drew. More later. I can't color anymore.

      Our first fan letter. Sent courtesy of some punkshit named Eric C. Well, not really a fan letter in the true sense of the term, rather it's a cleverly disguised fan letter which pretends to be hatemail while emulating the style in which we write blog entries. A paradox in and of itself. I am confused. Here, you read it.      Zapholk.  I hate the way when someone writes something into a website (eg: jobrugund) they use this mellow-tone speaking pattern, and then tell this story like they are everyone’s friend, then after the big introduction of who they are, and how they will change your life if you just read what they have to say, they make some comment about some current activity of absolutely no relevance. Then if they haven’t prematurely cut off their piece , they start talking about school. SCHOOL IS FOR SCHOOL. Someone they don’t like, someone they do like, something they ate. And after that they usually find someone they really dislike and rant about it for a little while. Frankly I can see how it might have some stress relieving points about it but other than that, go tell your boy-friend and stop wasting my Internet.  And all the reference to the dismembering of internal organs or mutilation of  someone’s innards is very lame now. Yes it was funny when it first happened because that’s the thing with originality. It’s good when it’s original!  Don’t be offended, it was just an observation.  myst.    Why did you want me to post this Eric? Why? You think you're better than Jorbrugund? Yeah, you think you're hot. What you've said here, it's a lame and blatantly uneducated generalization. It makes you sound like a goon, and quite frankly, that's all I want. What do you mean "Don't be offended, it was just an observation."? You insulted me. Am I supposed to disregard all offense, just because what you said was one of your MANY CLEVER OBSERVATIONS? NO. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. Every statement you make is somehow based on an observation or opinion, so that's really not going to keep me from getting irked. You know what? You're a fucking troglodyte. But don't fly into a rage over it, poopy pants. It was just an observation. Once I buy a bat, I'm going to break some of your stuff. Just for this letter. Also, wtf is Zapholk?    Kyle would like to add this;   For future reference to anyone who'd like to send us mail. First and foremost, we don't care. Secondly, if you are that concerned about the state of internet hilarity you should hang yourself. Seriously, the internet makes you stupid. If you have any ounce of anything in you, go outside and do something. Let the real losers do what we do best: nothing at all. The choice you have to read the crap we post here should be an easy one. Either look at it, enjoy it, and carry on, or don't. We aren't going to change anything because someone with an opinion decides to share it. In summary, lick goatum and die.

         Yes, I hate him too.  So the other day I was sitting at breakfast with my wife Florence and having a nice chat about such redundant things as stem cell research and poverty in "my own backyard". Not that I really gave a shit, in fact neither did she. But our marriage had long since degraded into a vapid, meaningless relationship, as indicated by the deadness in our eyes, almost glossy as they gazed into our bowls of corn bi-product snap pop flakey crap.   This was the routine day in and day out, never changing, nothing surprising ever happened. Flo was losing her short term memory though, and perhaps suffering from dementia, as occasionally she would yell at the "hooligans messing with her paperclip collection". Flo did not have a paper clip collection, so it really came down to either the old bitch was completely insane, or the hooligans had infact succeeded. Either way it was annoying and unnecessary.   We had both long since retired, and lived out our days in a small house, with a picket fence, and other bullshit we thought we needed in our younger days. We both hated kids. We both hated pets. We were both assholes. So basically we should have just killed ourselves when we met, instead of living out a dull and boring life, together.  I was pretty sure I was dying. I really hoped it would come soon. I had concidered suicide, but basically I was too much of a pussy to carry through with it. Florence was pretty much useless nowadays. I had thought about killing her several times, but then I'd have to do stuff. Whatever.   So anyways, this particular morning we were sitting around, and all of a sudden I had to go to the bathroom. It happened more frequently as I was beginning to lose most of my bowel control. Most of the time I just urinated myself. I didn't care. But this morning I was feeling particularily spunky so I hopped up and went into the bathroom.  No sooner do I get in when Flo starts screaming, "GAAAAAAH FUCK EDWARD THERE'S A BABOON ON MY FACE!!!!"  Delusional bitch.   "GAAAAAAAAH YOU JACKASS COME OUT HERE AND DO SOMETHI----"  She comes running into the bathroom (I don't bother closing the door anymore.) and... son of a bitch, there is a baboon on HER FACE!!!!  WHEN I SAW IT I ALMOST SHIT MY PANTS, BUT THEN I REALIZED I WAS ON THE TOILET SO I JUST SHIT RIGHT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!   The moral of the story is don't be a boring asshole your whole life, or you'll end up having a heartattack on the crapper. Or some other lame death. Get out and live, you lazy bastard.

      What is anger? Anger to me is simply an emotion that most comes out of stupidity. Well, in most cases. What would the world be like if anger didn't exist? I think people would be much more passive, and leniant when it came to a person wronging another. When one gets mad, I think alot of times they throw understanding and litteralism out the window. I'm not sure, but it seems guys, (not to be sexist) have the tendancy to become more unrealistic and not able to look at the situation in a two sided sense. I understand that many should take the time to slow down, and look at the whole picture. Not only for two minutes, but for a couple hours. By then i think things have come to the point where the situation has no revelence and no one really cares, if havnt already forgotten why the began to become angry in the first place. So in conclusion i guess i'm saying we should all just take some time to become alittle more passive in our habitation, but not to the point where your a fuckin push over. Cheers!

Well folks, I've fought my way across the galaxy to bring you this important news update on the war raging on in the Aniverse!

He has lead his army of toads and other assorted reptilia on a path of conquest never before fathomed.  But even in these gloomy and dark times, there shines a ray of hope. And that ray of hope's name is Bucky. Bucky "You've Got the Touch" O'Hare and his coherts of various space buccaneers travel the galaxy ridding the world of the threat of total swamp-ize-ation.     Now, don't get me wrong.

      I was thinking.... And I basically thought my way to the question, is it really selfish to only introduce new things into this blog call Jorbrugund, and not really read any of the other participants letters, or entries, or poetry. It was brought to my attention that this one individual in my life thought that I believed I was better then them. This person produced a thought in their mind that stated that I believed I was an inclined poet who believes that my poetry is of another nature, or a higher level then poetry of that individual. Now when this is brought before me and I sit here, not really feeling like reading these long entries produced and published by, I'm sure, intelligent and imaginative minds, I almost feel that the person who has brought such a thing to my attention made an almost truthful point. So I guess when you read another persons poetry, letters, entries, whether pointless or to the point, it is somehow showing them an abundance of respect and equality. Even though such a thing is so simple and sometime amusing. So from this day, I will make a point of reading every entry and find the time to make a use of it in my life... If a use of it is possible. Once again, if it is to the point. Anyway, with that, I must be going... I worth a poem awhile ago, I really don't think anyone has come to read it except for the person I possibly wrote it to and I. Enjoi.  -Take my hand and follow me to that place I long to be. Take my hand and trust my way, in that place forever stay. Follow me toward the sand; we'll run and play, hand in hand. Take my heart and hold it true; forever I'll stay close to you. Seize my words and listen well, then forever I will tell. Release your heart and feelings too, just as I will do for you. Trust your heart and follow me, to that place we long to be.

      The politics of high school puzzle me, really. Many of the particularly outdated “rules of thumb” concerning how to survive these consequential four years hardly apply anymore. One of the most daunting is how to “be” popular. What is popularity, anyway? In all honesty, I don’t think such a group exists anymore. Perhaps the physical conception of the in-crowd subsists to an extent, but overall their group is parallel to ours (Referring to my fellow writers here.) There is no elite few who “rule” the student body, as depicted on all-too-many situation comedies and poorly directed high School themed flicks.   The doorbell just rang, so I went upstairs to answer it. I only realize now that I had a comb entangled in my hair the entire time. I think I'm off topic. Back to the rant.  Of course, there are always the token dipshits who still believe in this false notion of popularity, (I can name a few on the spot, actually) but in reality, when compared to the actual definition of popularity (the quality of being widely admired or accepted or sought after [Thanks Webster.] ) show that they are indeed, quite disliked. In one cock-knee’s case, which goes above all others in my opinion, I happened to ask someone who you would think was quite closely grouped with him, told me that her and most of her friends can’t stand his ass.   Popularity is an illusion and we’re all magicians.  What spawned this outlandish overgeneralization of high school hierarchy? Ahh, just a general thought I was tinkering with while I meditated throughout my spare in the Visual arts lab.  Today during teen aid I was beguiled by the concept of having pre-marital sex with the anti-sex lady. I figured it’d be rather ironic, actually. But after laughing at the novelty of such an encounter I quickly dropped it. Because the woman was gross. Someone poked her with the ugly meter stick too many times. But that’s beside the point. What was the point again? Oh yeah, hot sauce kills infants under the age of 18 months. But at least my mom thinks I’m cool.

      I came to the conclusion today that I have no direction. Every idea I have is a product of my seriously twisted and handicapped sub-concious, and my dangerously large ego. I'm going in circles. And I'm getting dizzy. So today we will find direction.  1. No more cantalope. Cantalope is disgusting, makes me feel like blowing my pants out with streaming poop, and it's hampering my creativity.   2. Drawing. I have very minimal skills as an artist, but I realized yesterday that as long as I was drawing (i.e. looking like I was doing something constructive) my parents left me the hell alone. This is healthy, as they tend to exhibit traits or frightening annoyance, and they mainly just piss me off. Yesterday my dad yelled at me because I wasn't doing anything. Fuck off, I'm best at doing nothing.  3. Say whatever comes to mind. When I was but a child, I tended to hold my tongue 90% of the time. This lead to poor socialization skills later in life. From this day forth, I'm going to say everything I think. Red sauce and wetnaps. And screaming. I'm going to scream more. It's such a stress reliever.  4. Don't stop rocking. Throughout my days I have periods of time where there is "no rocking". Not rocking is lame. And my main goal in life is to avoid lameness at all costs, from now on it's going to be 24/7 rocking. Something might explode.  5. Punch things. I always threaten to punch things and people, but some strange concept of compassion or some other bullshit like that overcomes me, so now, if you piss me off, you'll be picking teeth out the back of your throat. Promise.  Ah, I feel rejuvalized. Hey, my sister's sleeping, I'm going to go put a pot over her head and bang it.

      Oh boy. Well, Hello, I’m Matt, the newest element to the formula that composes Jorbrugund. Now, I’m not handy with a paintbrush like Evan, I cannot exhibit the finely tuned repartee and witticism of my comrade Kyle, nor can I orchestrate my words in such an enticing manner in poetry like Phil (Fill) and Lara, but I am the jackass you hear about, so I suppose that’s worth something.. or so I gather.  I hate Christian Ethics. I really do. Its not just the Christian part, nor the ethics really bug me, its just the bible quotes. I just don’t understand, really, I don’t. Its tedious. Whatever education official who is responsible to inventing  the concept of bible quote scrutinization (if such a word exists) should be drug out onto the highway and shot between the eyes. Its just frustrating, really. No one learns from it, the quotes have little merit and only theologians have any interest in it (had these quotes not been re-used over and over). Now, it’d be another story if these verses actually required some independent thought, but instead they are merely the same regurgitated dribble we have been spoon-fed since early elementary. Hell, even if we were allowed to find our own verse and analyze it, allowing us to be more creative with it, then perhaps I’ll be more stimulated.  I’ve come to the conclusion that Christian Ethics is the root of all my malevolence, and everything I complain about can be linked back to it, one way or another. …I don’t know what I’m talking about. I like to rant, but I think I like your mom more. Cheers, Matt

       Refreshing, the confessions of a weirdo.  I want big boots, I have some but I Want them with buckles not laces, and mine are at school because Cinderella is wearing them next week. I want boots that will strike fear into the hearts of the infantile and elderly, both age groups that I like .... But still. Where does one aquaria these fear instilling boots ??? I would think a military vintage boutique, or maybe a fetish outlet.... I should look into that . I don't really like the military, but I don't think its endorsing it to wear their clothes. Maybe that's self serving doctrine, but I think its just recycling. I don't have any compassion for the violent fucks... eh? Maybe its because I think of them as such big men, I like big men and I don't.  One time a group of really big guys came into Burger King behind me, they were joking around, gross, probably came from hockey or football practice. Both good sports, rugby now theres a sport, any way; so these guys are all big. And I guess I took to long ordering my veggie burger, One of the guys just picked me up and set me down on the other side of the railing.....!!!!!! How do you respond to that, the girl at the til didn't say anything probably to scared, I didn't know what to do I just freaked out mentally and looked confused, I've never been speechless before like I was then! I think that's kind of a stupid one of my reasons for not liking the military. But there are many others, such as my love of peace.... That's another time coming.  I think G Bush is a dumbass... You should too.

          Have you ever noticed the constant bullshit spewing from the peons around you on a day to day basis? Have you ever told these certain persons to shut their fucking mouths because this WAS a clean shirt, and then kicked their face in? Have you ever thought that ignorance is anything but bliss?   No? Go to hell.  By the by, I was so pissed off today because I heard someone say that they may as well ban gay marriages, because gay couples will divorce as much as straight couples, so we're just making the divorce problem bigger. I then grabbed this person's pancreas, crushed it, and threw them down the steps.   Now I'm pissed off because I didn't get a cookie. Is it so much to ask for a cookie? Am I being greedy and ungrateful for what I have? Frankly, I don't give a shit, now give me my goddamn cookie.     Actually, I just realized I don't have any real reasons to be pissed off. I think I'm going to pursue a career like professional sperm producer. I suck ass at everything else. Have a nice night. And damnit, I will cry for you.

      For the past eleven years, I've been institutionalized in factories of education. For the most part, I've enjoyed my position here and have taken pride in the work I've accomplished, though it differs from the education I have come to realize was its intended goal. The names and numbers have always served me as the conveyor belt serves a man in the assembly line. They have perpetuated my interest and my desire to participate by simply fulfilling themselves through means of a constant presence and service. As long as the merchandise is there in front of me, it seems only logical to make use of it. And so, I've dissected the trigonometric functions and calculus theory, and I've drawn my eyes across horizontal lines of text revealing the cyclical nature of history. I've let it be wrung out by the eager hands of novelists and poets who've inspired me time and time again to cleanse my palette in anticipation for the next course.I have acquired so many products of fact over the duration of my time here, but my education can not be confined to the context of the walls of these factories.

      It was recently brought to my attention that no one knows what a marmoset is. You ignorant fucks, I'm here to enlighten you.      As you can tell, the marmoset is a monkey. And not just any kind of monkey, the type of dead-serious, don't-look-at-me-and-laugh-or-I'll-fuck-you-up-mo'-fo' kind of monkey. They are more badass than your mother, and they don't take no for an answer. In fact, they're so badass they kill children and make beds out of their entrails. Sure, they look fuzzy, but those eyes are just screaming, "touch me and I swear to god I'll rip off your arm and beat you with it". Yes, this is the marmoset. One of God's most wonderful creatures. Know this.

      I am currently at school, and I would like to say a few things before I go to class. I might not have enough time to write into the blog tonight so I though I might do it now and get it over with. Today is going fine. When I was walking to school, a butterfly came flying up to me and landed on my shoulder. I said hello like any polite, normal Saskatoon citizen would do and then proceeded to walk. The butterfly then continued to whisper in my ear. He or she, depending on the sex of such an insect, explained to me that they did not appreciate the weather at the present time and wished it were warmer. I, at that point, then invited the beautiful creature into my pants where it was warm. When the butterfly did so, the creature instantly passed on to a better place. This was very unfortunate and at this time I would appreciate if you took a moment of respect in silence as we honor that poor helpless butterfly. Good day to you all.    Poetry - Butterfly Skin   Sunlight peeking through the treetops, Shining down on bare skin, tingling with a fall breeze. Awakening with the tingling steps of grandaddy's crawling all around. Dew drops kissing peach flavored lips as Morning Glories bloom one last time. Fingers streching across bare breasts as chills of morning air arise. Standing on two dainty feet so long, so slim, so graceful. Outstreched arms reaching for the fruits Sweet juice kissing, soaking, dripping over chin and lips. Birds chirping, singing, playing nature's sun kissed song. Butterfly kisses on the cheek from summer's last generation. Oh what a romance to live a life wild, naked, and free as nature it self is lying at your feet. Mother Earth's daughter born on a Mid Summer's night dream...

       Poetry - Dreamcatcher Web   I wove a net, to catch your thoughts. To see them close and clear A lovers quarrel; that which is left unsaid All to be revealed.  In cold December, the net got tangled. And you forgot you loved me My own device  For my demise Of that which is mine only  I shed a tear, onto your head. Falling hard and strong, It eased the tensions of the knots and ties Soon the net was gone.			  And now I’m free and so as love, your thoughts fly free as well I kept the net Dreamcatcher web I hide it not to tell

      Hello, this is my first casual writing in this blog, which might I add, will soon take over the world and become the Anti-Christ. One day, I was running along the big cliff and then my mother called me in for lunch. We were having grilled cheese that day and it smelled delicious. Then when I thought everything was fine and dandy, my mother started to give me shit about skipping class because I was sick, then lying to her when she full out knew I was being truthful. This was fine because I simply explained to her how I felt in two simple words. Your Nuts. She replied by saying, nuts like a fox, thus we have the title, which at first made no sense. Secondly, I would like to take this time to say that horse flies suck, and the birds and the bees, in reality, do not have sex. Thank you.    Poetry - Experience   hello sweet sunshine please flash before my eyes i prayed for clouds today now i am sterilized UV rays Infrared Cancer causing warmth The life is coming back to me In a swarm I'm lit off sunshine But I don't hold it dear I prayed for rain today I wanted the chills near to my skin through my head I love the unusual A serpents kiss is want I suck through a straw

      DECONGESTANT - This represents a large group of sympathomimetic (stimulate the sympathetic nervous system) medications that act to constrict blood vessels in the nasal passages. The net effect is decongestion. Common medications include pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, phenylpropanolamine, oxymetazoline, and phenylephrine. It should be noted that blood vessels in the nasal passages are not the only blood vessels affected by the drug. It's use can lead to high blood pressure, and heart explosion.  Further info on decongestants  urlLink here,  and  urlLink here .  I was full of snot and I didn't know how the decongestant I was taking worked. So I found out and I thought I'd share.

      Back in the 80's I was fortunate enough to spend some time "visiting" a Red Chinese prison. They were kind enough to let me stay for a couple months, and during this time they taught me why I should not steal Opium from the Imperial Court. How gracious they were, the noble Chinese, they even welcomed me as a brother with this tattoo:     I learned many things in the long months I spent there, but one of the most interesting encounters I had was with a man simply called Boon. Boon the Human Cheetah.      I had heard several stories about the mysterious Boon, but one day I decided to approach this peculiar man and ask him a few questions...  Gunnar McGrail: Good evening, Mr. Boon. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions? Boon the Human Cheetah: Not at all, Candice. GG: Uh huh. So, I'm sure the most obvious question I could ask is, why the Human Cheetah? BTHC: Well you see, when I was but a small boy I discovered I could run fast. GG: As in, how fast? BTHC: Fast enough to make you pee yourself. GG: That's cheetah fast. I've heard you quickly gained notoriety for using your speed for tripping the elderly, children, and dogs. Is this true? BTHC: They had it coming. GG: I understand. I'm sure it must have been quite a life. BTHC: It was. But then came that fatefull day... I had been resting all day, and decided to have a nice, cold, caffeinated beverage. This beverage gave me power and energy like I had never felt. So I did the only thing I could do. I ran. And I ran faster and faster until the air pressure started making brain cells explode. The next thing I knew I was laying in the middle of an empty street in a pool of my own urine. I opened my eyes to discover I was left colourblind from the ordeal, and had lost the hearing in my left ear. GG: Well, you seem to be doing just fine after something like that. *At this point Boon had passed out, salivating profusely. After a few prods he awoke with a hollar of, "BUT THE PANTS WEREN'T FITTED AHAHAHAHA."  GG: I'm sorry, would you like to carry on? BTHC: Oh, I'm quite fine, thank you. GG: So what crime did you commit to end up in here? And more importantly, how did you get caught. BTHC: I was sleeping on the roof of a building, which is apparently illegal. They caught me. GG: Right, well, thanks for your time. It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Boon. BTHC: Boon the Human Cheetah will do, thank you.  Ah yes, the man, the myth, the legend. The following day Boon the Human Cheetah was executed by sharks.  True story.   Note: Thanks to Evan for inputted.

      I want to be married. I want to be old. I want two kids. Maybe three. I want a ranch by the sea, with horses. I want to write catchy songs and make art all day long for the rest of my life.   I feel on the verge of something    Art      Hell is tripping and falling on your face a million times. Hell is having nothing but this picture to show you guys.   Fuck.

         "I want to rub baby oil on your inner thigh."  Danny was built several years ago by Miles and Bethany, two keen science students of the University of Wisconsin. Danny was originally designed to have basic speech functions, and would be able to hold fairly straight-forward conversations. He would say things like, "My, that's a nice sweater you're wearing," or, "Gee this weather's just dandy today, isn't it?". But it was soon realized that Danny began to develop his own intelligence, and intellect far beyond that of a simple-speech robot. Soon passerbys would say "Hello Danny," expecting a kind reply, only to recieve such replies as "GO SHOVE YOUR FACE IN THE OVEN!" or "I'LL FUCK YOU WITH MY METAL FACE, ASSBAG".  Slightly distraught over this turn of events, Miles and Beth decided they should pull the plug on poor, unfortunate Danny. But upon approaching him Danny fired lazers out of his eyes, screaming, "FLEAGH BURN IN HELL HUMANS!" and with that he ventured into the desert, never to be seen again.  ...   That is, until he completes his conquest of the world... you will be assimilated. 12|1001|1000015.%100)(1010011|*

      Mans the beast On the world we feast We kill the cowards  As we grow in power One nation down  More to go  Look at us wrong Our might we'll show But we can't stop war  We need it to survive Cause with out war Mother nature will die Because with out a fight between each other will find new ways to attack our mother. So bring on war,strife and conflict Our race is a whore. We strive in conquest. Lets have world wide Genocide, planetary Suicide and when the whole damn world is dead there's your fucking peace.  I wrote that awhile ago and I thought I might put it on here for fun. I'll admit it is very unstructured and to some might be a little vulgar but in some sense, I think I like it. It's very sarcastic and for that I dedicate it to my good friend, Sean Conley. On to other business, this week has been the most stressful, and hectic week of my life. Now, I find this kind of strange because when I was at a high point in my life... Which was yesterday for those who don't know, I wrote a poem, which yes, I posted yesterday, on being worn out and sick of life, and basically being one who complains instead of going out and doing something. Now today it seems, that I am the one who is now worn out and tired. I would go to the extent of complaining by using examples but that's going to far in my opinion. So once again, when life gets you down, fight back. I'm really not exactly, positively sure on what to write next, so bare with me, and I will look into what I want to post next... Enjoi!  parachute skunk's going to hit on your mom she told me you ought to get a parachute dog I missed the bus again and my left leg is broken parachute, I don't want you on my nerf-ball team  That is a little something called Blah! So here's something else because I kinda ripped you off.... Once again, enjoi!  Stick my bony thumb up towards the road, pump the waves that bounce off my hips, turn on the smoke machine  and wait, 1.... 2...... 3......... 4........... red truck hicks,3 or 4 of them,all men, hoot and hollar at me, stop, get in, go, an engine grease covered hand slips up my thigh underneath my pleather skirt FUCKER!!!!!!!! My right hand lights a cigarette, my left hand grabs a gun "touch my new scooby doo panties and I'll fucking blow your brains out all over your daddies car" slithers out from within my chapped pink lips, another drag another hand 1.... 2...... 3.......... 4............ Push,shove,push,shove, wow looks like I got me a brand new red truck all to myself.  Forgive me please. Please... Please... Please... Give me a cheese sandwich.... Holy crap. I think someone slipped something into my drink. I'm hungry. BYE!  (SSHHH, you can see me run out of the room... Jen's a tripod!)

      Hey guys, I'm sorry that I've been really busy with school lately and stuff so I can't seem to find the time to put anything in on a daily basis, but im trying my hardest. This poem is proly the first poem where I put an actual effort into keeping on track and staying on one idea throughout the whole piece. It mostly is describing and giving advise to someone who finds that they are becoming worn down by the world around them. This may include school, friends, parents, or even maybe their relationship with God. That you may take a stand for yourself and when you are knocked down, by either your own account or another's, you may get back up on your feet and stand tall... So here it is...  The nerves inside you twitch your mind inside the gears are stripped and smashed together teeth are wearing down from biting your tongue and cheeks. Buried now beneath numbers,  illusions of sentience, you solve riddles but don't comprehend the greatest mystery of all, razors that are dull, your skin tears so easily from stress- The daily grind.  If your head is pounding pound back! If the voices inside are screaming filling you up with self-doubt, if the world is rubbing ya hard against the grain don't just sit there and take the pain, fight back! Grind hard against the weight!  So you're tired of fighting the urge to go away instead you just shut up and go to work every day-- The daily grind.  Every time you come home it's another fight you're tired all day but you can't sleep at night-- The daily grind.  Well if your head is pounding pound back! If the voices inside are screaming filling you up with self-doubt, if the world is rubbing you against the grain, don't just sit there and take the pain fight back! Grind against the weight!

      Today I have a poem for you..  I do not speak to you as I do him. Listen. Closed eyes. My heart is pure . Truthfully. Though not to Members of judgment. Do not be             One of them. Empty eyes. Foolish heart Inflamed head. I like  the branch, be not dull or  conventional. Let us get our feet wet. Let us get them wet.    Don't ask, its weird  I know, not like any others I've written.You should hear, How do you sleep by John Lennon. Its good.  I feel like...... Paper MACHE!

      One day I'll rule the world.     Everyday I see the same thing. Everyday I see the same damn thing. Crap on your face. Whatever.     This guy comes up to me and goes "hey buddy" so hit him in the knee with a baseball bat. Whatever.     Gonorrhea sucks. Whatever.     How was I supposed to know she was only 3? Whatever.     Twenty two days ago I tripped an old lady and ran away. This guy in a space suit jumped me. Whatever.     Gerry woke up this morning without hands. Whatever.     Oasis could have saved rock and roll. But they got drunk and beat the shit out of each other. I suppose that is rock and roll. How Zen. Whatever.

      My mother frantically tells me that I am under NO circumstances allowed to kill the spider  that lives beside our sink. Her plea is that he is her friend and she likes to talk to him while she brushes her teeth. I run to kill him she wails in horror I stop how can i kill an innocent friend? So, she'll talk to her parrot she'll talk to me and  she'll talk to her spider. Sometimes I wonder how I ever came from her, but at times like this, I know. Now I simply wonder if she's named him.

      I woke up and I thought it was raining. I heard rain falling on my window. I was encouraged to get out of bed at an ungodly hour by this fact. I was pining to go for a rainy walk. Now, here I am, tired and indoors. Because it is not raining. I miss the rain. I'd have woken up and walked in the rain while the sun was still rising. Maybe stopped along the way and visited someone and later, drawn pictures from my (or potentially their) livingroom window and listened to sad music.      However, it's not raining. So, I plan to mope around for the remainder of the day.   I'll post art later. I have to make brunch.

      I’m creating a comic strip for Graphic arts.. But I get distracted. I keep thinking about this dream I had.. I was driving down Warman, and then I signaled to turn east down Assiniboine and this silver SUV comes out of nowhere and crunches straight through the hood of my car like it was made of aluminum. It was strange.. the first dream I’ve ever had when I’ve actually felt something. I knew my legs were crushed in a mangled heap, yet it didn't hurt, yet. I was able to experience that single second of confusion and dull throbbing throughout all your limbs while your brain tries to sort out what just occurred.. then the pain kicks in. And I wake up. Y’know that feeling after your leg falls asleep, and you wake it up, and just before it feels like needles being injected into it, it has this sort of a inert pulse that surges through it? That’s sort of what it felt like. But I digress. If you have any ideas, give me a buzz. Heres Uncle Vicrum, the headliner of a Media studies presentation. Ps. I didn't post because Evan said so, but that I felt the want to do so. He didn't beat me either. ..

      I lost my damned portfolio. Everything I've drawn that was worth being proud of is gone. I tore the house apart looking for it and it's nowhere to be found. This means I won't feel like drawing anything until I have that little black folder in my hands. However, I'm more likely to break down and draw than find the bloody thing. I think I may have an inkling of where it is... Perhaps in the posession of one Mrs. D.   Fuck. Anyway, since I'm not posting art for a while, go listen to this song that The Zebras just spontaneously created. The quality's horrible, and there's no lyrics, but you'll get the idea. I'm quite fond of it at the moment.  urlLink Joe Jackson by The Zebras  ... That's just the working title, it has nothing to do with Joe.  And to those other people who are contributing, you're not. What gives? I miss the stories and poetry.

      Sometimes we must think of the simple things. The other night I was walking down the street and I was thinking about how many cracks I've stepped on in my journey so far. Then I started to think about the ants on the road. How many have I viciously murdered on my way home. Even though I have probably only killed few, and these ants are short lived, I still tend to wonder if they have feelings. If they mind that I have just squished their small three part bodies against the side of the road. Now, have these ants actually received eternal life and are now in heaven with God? If so, what do they eat? This causes me to come to my next question. Does God, the almighty, all powerful, and all gracious Lord, enjoy a good old peanut butter and jelly sandwich? If this is so, then I am sure the ants that I have just killed by total accident, are now eating the over-sized bread crumbs from the sandwich being eaten by the one I look to for advice and guidance. But hey, it seems some tend to believe this is shit. On some level I agree. So I will end with this... Never nail your shoes to the ground. You will be very disappointed.    I am back. It is late at night, or early in the morning... Depending on how you look at it. I've been thinking for awhile and I thought I might post this now, that I have it in my mind and its proly going to leave soon. Also the fact that if I do post two things in a row, Evan will probably still have a fuss and put them both together anyway. Not like anything is wrong with that... Enjoi. (Thought)  Life… Yeah, sometimes it sucks, Sometimes we feel like we’re being dragged through the muck, Yeah, I’ve felt like killing my self before too brother/sister….  Life… Yeah, sometimes it’s great! Sometimes it feels like everything is going our way, Yeah, I’ve felt like jumping up and down or crying with happiness before too….  Balance….. Next time you think your life sucks,  Remember it can always get better…. Next time you think you’ve never felt happier,  Remember it can always get worse….  Remember to keep it balanced, Remember to smile when it rains, Remember the sun always comes out, Remember it takes rain and sun to make a rainbow Remember it takes black and white to make a Ying Yang Remember it takes good and bad to make harmony Remember it takes happiness and despair to live a good life, No matter how unfair you think it may be, Just remember me and all I’ve told you today, Because I used to feel the same way, Until I figured out the secret Until I found my balance…..

      Hawksley Workman is a fantastic songwriter. Myself and five friends went to see him preform last night. The show was wonderful. I took pictures. Most of them turned out really badly, here's one of the better ones.    Another portion of the okay-pictures can be seen  urlLink here .  I suggest you listen to some of Hawksley Workman's music if you haven't already. Listen to as much as you can. Maybe visit his  urlLink site  as well.    ♥

      Hello casual reader, Today has been an interesting day for me, as well as for you I am sure. I have not posted anything on Jorbrugund in a very long period of time and for that, I apologize. Here is something that I had just written this morning. Its not really a poem, more so the side thought that occurs when I ponder on the realization that one day, I will have children. Or I guess in a sense this piece could be metaphorical & symbolic. Anyway, enjoi.  There is no hope in the futile endeavors of mans pursuits. Death is always in the furthest reaches of our subconscious. The search for immortality begins almost at birth. We try to find the link to a future we will never see. In the end, most accept their failure and resort to the last hope of the desperate. Children. The cycle begins again. In a world so full of useless lives, spent in vain, searching for a truer purpose,  they cast there many out. We are full, there is no more room, no more food, no more hope, we have used it all up,  yet they continue. The madness has unveiled it's self. The riots have begun. The bombs have been planted. The corruption is prevailing. Corporate lies have become the currency of man. Hate is the medium of the masses. Fear is the fortress of nations. And we hide in our electron fed virtual fantasies. Don't leave your home. Lock your doors. Close your windows. And with them, close and lock your mind. Rest safe in the knowledge that your children will see a better world. Won't they?  Personally, I hate emo. I absolutely despise that fact that you cannot get over what just happened simply because it was sooooo detrimental to your own life. Now there are two ways to look at this. Being  emo is simply getting emotionally caught up in the moment and the circumstances of one point your life and allowing those certain set of circumstances affect the next set of circumstances that are bound to come about. It is a much better world if you move on, and take the future circumstances with a clean slate. This brings only one question to mind.... How is done when scars are at hand?  The glass rose, so sacred, so fragile, but so broken, shattered among the floor, tearing my skin, my mind in memories. So sharp, So jagged, In time the wounds will heal but the scars will last forever, sharp times, scaring memories, so deep, so sharp, the blood the same color as the rose, and yet the same color of love, the bloodshed for love, The breaking of hearts, such as the glass rose breaks, tearing your skin, as the emotions are inside, The red rose, The color of love, The color of blood.  Once again, I would like to point out the recently known fact, I hate emo. And I apologize to anyone who finds this to be so. Well, I am pretty sure I am done for the day, continue reading and have a good sleep... No matter what time it is.

      I'm going on a bit of a trip. I'll be heading out west to Calgary for a while. Two or three days at the most. I'll miss my friends like hell, but it'll be alright. I'm making sure to take my sketchbook and my camera, so I have something to show when I get back. I like Calgary.   Since I don't have any personal art to show you, I'll show you someone else's.

      So to sum it all up, im tired, frustrated, confused, and plain sick of alot of stuff.It sucks to be poor. Aspecaill when you finally get money but it's tied down with duty so you can't really spend it. Anyway, I dont really feel like talking and i'm not sure if I posted this already but screw you anyways. critisism is welcomed. Also, any positive just chatty remarks would be nice too. Good-day  Where did these breasts come from? Hips, Curves, and a , Sexy silhouette, has never been me. I am now feminine, cute, crazed, odd, but somehow lovely. Women are gorgeous, lean and lovely, or, buxom and beloved, either way.... What can I say? Should I be the Cleopatra, of generation X? Or the Marilyn Monroe, of computer kids? I'll have to think about that. You love me for my, big juicy, brains. Don't you?? You know you yearn to caress my, genuine intellect, right? In that case, everything is wonderful.

         Sean is mildly disgusted.  That's all I have for you today. I've been thinking about posting some writing of mine, however mediocre. I have to find where I put all of it before I can type it out to post, though.  I figure it will make an acceptable substitue for my lack of drawings, or it will force me to draw so I don't have to post my shitty words. Tomorrow I'm going to be sick. I'll need tea. Take a sick day tomorrow. Drink some tea.   ♥

      Greetings Reader, There was no real warning, I just wanted to get your full attention. 'Kay, short story time. A homeless mans roams downtown, looking for a place to sleep. This poor, old, dirty looking man searches in need for a place of peace and rest. He randomly chooses certain places to lie, but he does not find himself in a comfortable enough environment that he is able to fall into an ever-light slumber.  Once again wondering late at night, he comes across this old, tattered bench facing the Saskatchewan riverside. The bench is tattered and old. It has markings on it of pleasant hearts, and initials made from the past occupiers. This bench had history, it was unique, and it caught the eye of the impoverished man. He looked around in anticipation, and when the man had found no one was in his presence, he lay on the bench with great care. The bench curved to his body like no other. The man had finally experienced comfort. He lay snug, staring into the night’s sky, slowly falling into a deep slumber. Days go by, as he claims the old bench as if it were his since birth. The old man finally felt what it was like to have a home again. He felt as if the bench was almost like his best friend. The man decides one that he will give something to the bench; give something back to his community. He saves whole days worth of money, made from the mercy of citizens who listen to him play the guitar on the side of the street. The man then walks to the local second hand store and buys some vibrant red paint.  Walking back to the bench he carefully, with great pleasure, paints the bench in this beautiful shade of color. The man waits for it to dry, and then observes the bench with satisfaction. Months go by, as more memories are carved into the old red bench. The man has made this place his home, his shelter, and his familiarity. ... I had an ending to this story. I swear. It's just.... I can't remember it. Oh well. In the end, a larger  homeless guy comes along, explaimed he what the other man has done with the aged bench, and steals it. Making it his home simply out of competition. All that work gone to waste. I will post later tonight. I like aligators. Cheers.

      You wake up in a plain. The wind whips through your hair and dust blows in your eyes. This place is strange to you. The clouds overhead seem to be moving fast, changing shades of grey right before your eyes. You stand up and assert yourself. You are naked. Yet the wind and sun keep you perfectly warm. You begin to walk, towards the shade of the large oaks ahead of you.   Upon your arrival, you sit down and lean against the cool bark. Closing your eyes and breathing deep, you can hear nothing but the sound of the wind blowing leaves through the fields. Wait; suddenly there is a new sound, a sound like squeaky shoes. Squeaky shoes, and the pungent smell of a musky cologne mixed with body odour. Your eyes slam open.     "Eugh... eheugh... you like safari?"  You quickly stand up and try to cover yourself. It's no use. There's nowhere to hide. Surely this man is up to no good.  "You... eugh... naked. You get safari."  Safari did he say? Surely he was a crackpot. But before you can react he grabs your hand and leaves you further into the small tree forest. Walking quickly down the faint path, he leads you to a grove. Everywhere you see animals, aliens, leprechauns, and big foots, all making sweet, sweet love.   "Eugh... safari. You happy be... in safari."  .............................................................................................................  Which brings me to my next issue. Why didn't God save the unicorns?

      At this moment.  I am a mess.  I hope things improve.    I was going to post some art, but I have nothing worth showing you, so I offer lyrics written by  urlLink Ted Leo.  Please read them carefully and listen to the song if you can.     First to Finish, Last to Start  rain falls - you know it's got to rain. the sky lifts it up and lets it down again. and it's alright - you must accept your part, being the first to finish or the last to start. and when you meet me on the ledge, we'll all be singing out again. and if you must, then jump away. i'm not afraid - we'll meet another day. flame burns - it burns its fuel away. it lights up the dark night and warms the cold cold day. but if you burn too strong you might expend your heart, being the first to finish and the last to start.      ♥   ÷ 2

         DEAR GOD DON'T FALL OVER ARN, DON'T FALL OVER!  Have you ever felt that something inside yourself was crooked? Like, just didn't fit right? Perhaps a bone in your ribcage had grown in crooked, and with every breath you take it was in danger of stabbing and puncturing your lungs? And because of this, now you never physically exert yourself, never take deep breaths, and never go to sleep... leading to a life of being an insomniac with a fear of dying by breathing to hard. Thus you begin to take physical abuse without concern, as running away would push your lungs too close to the ever present "Lung Popping Rib Bone of Death". You live alone as a hermit, wall yourself up in a cave, and eventually die shortly after your 23rd birthday?   That happened to me yesterday.     On a happier note, Gwen Stefani is the most beautiful person alive. One day I will be just as beautiful, that's what the doctor promised. And with the money from the kidneys I sold, he better keep that fucking promise. Then I'll be beautiful, and then you'll love me. You'll all love me.  Hazme el amor .  Baby this night This night’s for us And baby this night Can only be seen as yours and mine Like a blessing dear I will bet you anything  That god is watching right now So let’s stay close We’re the last on earth Let’s be in love Like we’re the last on earth And I hate to break it to you baby But we’re the last on earth  The world won’t have a chance to witness your sweet loveliness Not like I will now The whole wide world will be nothing but your beauty, dear There’s no one else down here And I can say for certain now That god wants this to be So let’s stay close like we’re the last on earth Let’s be in love Like we’re the last on earth And I made the choice for us my darling  To be the last on earth  And it’s taken all a lifetime It’s taken all a lifetime  Baby this night could be ours So just close your eyes  Hawksley Workman is the next Jesus.

      Hello. Life is good. God is Good. You could even say Good is good. What if you were to name your son Good. That would be good. God said when he finished creation that it was good. I think that the term good is used very loosely these days. I mean, who the hell came up with the word great. Naturally, in the english language, the word great overpasses the word good with no doubt. When the avarage man or woman hears the word good, he or she tends to think of the word okay, or avarage. Ex. "How was your day?" Then one replies,"good." So next time you feel the need to say good, say it with confedence, knowing that even God tells us that the word good far overpasses great in reality.  So anyway, how are you. Can I ask something of you? Who ever does not post on a regular basis, and reads my material, click on the link to you right that says 'Who we are.' and take the time to e-mail me, telling me what you think. Give me some feed back. Something? Thank you. In other business I would like to this time to cooment and wish luck to kyle martin for his halarious post that was presents earlier in the week. I loved it, halarious. I also am very fond of meatloaf and desire to try it in a sandwich. Good Job. I think I will close with a poem for now. All of you, have a good day and a good night. Enjoi.  On the steps of a walkway I sit Alone in the solitude of night Moonlight streaming from a crescent above And sadness blown upon a soft wind  Darkend pages illuminated by a streetlamp A huddled figure cries out for answers Night is the time for secrets and thruths As all is revealed under a soft, silvery glow.

      Hey guys, It's late. So I am tired, and my writing isn't that good. I apologize if I return to unstructured, horrible poetry, but for now, at this time, with this ammount of energy, it is the best I can do. Enjoi.  a dream deferred a life lost how does one who has never been love pain convinces existence of its existence forget sorrow parting is just sweet maybe the whoring wasn’t so subtle why save a body when so many have rushed to pimp the soul who knew that blood and salt water could form such indestructible links no magician’s trick to simply, subtly separate chains beget chains and those who most crave freedom suddenly find themselves begging to be bound the new software came out yesterday it’s already obsolete upgrading is impossible for sale bargain prices last year’s model slightly worse for the wear not so user friendly but unprecedented in reliability remnants for sale, remnants for sale doesn’t anybody want these remnants for sale? never again is so short lived discount rates for round trip tickets when hurt is your oldest friend why make new ones?  In conclusion, I guess that went longer then I expected it too. Seeing as I dont really understand the bottom line, or the backround message if you will, I really do not believe that the reader will understand my emotion portrayed in this piece as well. But ofcourse, some of you know me better then I even know myself. And Sometimes that is deadly.   When you know love that's all you want  Love can be so divine,  It can make you cry,  It can make you scream,  it can make you smile,  Its like an ocean either rocking you to sleep or grabbing you pulling you to the bottom,  drowning you slowly,  overwhelming you with water and emotions until you suffocate,  Love is confusing as the skies  turning blue to gray in such short time,  as short as the day and night.  Thundering among us in our security of homes,  leaping into the tears,  Dying in a drought,  Falling from above only to crash,  Crash so hard you shatter among the dust and ash,  crying sending up another storm of memories, hopes, dreams, life.  The grass so green,  the sky so blue,  and all changing,  oceans among oceans,  seas among seas searching for them  Searching for that one,  that one in which will keep my skies blue and leave my ocean beautiful,  instead of eating it apart.  Pulling things from the ground as if never alive.  With death comes life.  With life comes death.  And with both brings hurt.  Calling on those you depend on,  Falling,  but pulling back,  so hard so swift,  Love is a hurt unbearable to those keepers,  The keepers of the stars and heavens cannot even control such a thing,  In eyes so deep,  Getting lost so down deep,  As a forest getting lost in the darkness as the sunsets,  ending everything,  ending the life of the day bringing on the night life,  in which surrounds you in insecurity,  Wanting wishing for the light again like love,  Wanting that feeling so badly that only the thoughts are of that.  Dreams among dreams of that one face,  The one you know that you want to be yours always and forever,  to live the dream you felt you would never live.  The unliveable but so thinkable life.  The tears are for them,  the ocean controlled by them,  swarming above a storm, or a clear sky,  The controls are with you,  My heart is with you like the oceans and sky.  I hope this isnt too personal for your liking... And for the record i also hope that it is not taking the wrong way, or else I'm in shit. So on to other business... Names. Names are important. I have just completely a whole theory on how important and devine names can actually be. How do you name emotion? To me, some, not all, but some of my poetry is pure emotion. Some poetry that I even place on this site is simply emotion that is expressed through words. So, with that, how do you give a name, or title a poem? I find this difficult simply because the name or title of the emotion is simply already there. The name or title is the words in which compose the piece of art. Anyway, that is my biggest though for tonight. Here is one poem that i have pre-wrote and you may enjoi at your leisure.  I want to change the rules. Instead of fifteen minutes of fame, It should be fifteen minutes of love. Everyone is entitled to fifteen minutes Of pure, uncensored, unbridled love. Fifteen minutes - fifteen minutes of blindness, Overwhelmed with bliss, For fifteen minutes - For fifteen minutes nothing else matters. Love matters. If everyone got it - Everyone would get it. Just fifteen minutes - Who needs fame anyway?   G' Night reader.  PS - I supose the title lied...

         Oh Obadiah, hold me tighter, and never let me go!  Some of you may have noticed something missing from Jorbrugund the past while. Some of you have stupid faces. Regardless, I have been travelling far and wide in the search for inspirado. Last week I went on Sergei's Love Safari. Before I go any further, let me just say that no one should ever have to go on Sergei's Love Safari. Nevertheless, I take a lot in from every experience I have, good, bad, or undetermined. So thus, I have been inspired to write a romance novel. An exerpt, just for you.   "It was cold that night. Very, bitterly cold. She shivered as he held her tight. Her nipples stood at attention... so rigid they seemed like captive little soldiers being held against their will, straining to break free from the cloth prison. These were the kind of nights they treasured most. Every second felt like an eternity. His breath against the back of her neck as they walked, she smelled meatloaf sandwich. Not good meatloaf sandwich, but not bad either. Suddenly, smoothly, he takes her up in his arms. Then over his shoulder. Fireman's carry style, just the way she liked it. He then began to run, his strong legs carrying them swiftly across the beach. Stopping and dropping her body in the sand, he takes out his fisher-price shovel and begins to slowly bury her. She laughs as the sand covers her neck down to her toes. He smiles and begins to build a sandcastle. A sandcastle just for her..."   Oh yeah, that's the shit.  And on a leaving note, here's Yo-Yo Ma for you.     Mr. Ma is a world renowned musician. He plays cello like nobody's business, and he's cute to boot. I'm starting the More Ma Now movement. 5 bucks to join.

      Writers block is contagious. But as opposed to my comrade Evanzo, I appear to have the creative part of my mind crucified to the plank.  lumberjacks. Lumberjacks could kick anyones ass. None of yer’ fuckin ninjas or pirates. Over utilized if you asked me. Don’t piss off a lumberjack.. he’ll slam a treetrunk down your throat.     BAM.  By the way, the Hawksley show kicked my ass to the moon. Fo’ real, bizzle.  Is that a caged monkey?  I can't stand those fucking cliche bastards who get all "pumped" about 4/20. seriously. no one cares that you enjoy weed. go overdose and have your stomach pumped, hopefully that'll smack some sense into you. Real smokers don't care, so get over the fact that a few aphoristic assholes thought it'd be "groovy" to dedicate one day to getting high. I hate you if you're "excited" for 4/20 You're also hated if you are Sean Conley, cause you cut me deep. Nigger what? Whats up now, racist. Walk it off buddy, walk it off.  I hope its sunny tomorrow, I can't handle another cloud.

      So, Long time no write. It's a bitch ain't it. I agree with Kyle, Evan must return. There are no options but to succumb to us Evan, we want you BACK!!Bastard.  Any who in other news, I am back  my self, after a little professional hiatus.... I am still creatively stagnant but that's ok. It is not I that will suffer the brunt of my creative lacking, but you gentle reader. Yes, it is you who will gain nothing from my writings and postings and leave with an empty feeling, drained as if I have taken something from you. And I have, ha jerk, I lured you away from other wise fulfilling activities with some production, and seduced you into reading my Saturday morning ramblings! Part of me feels successful. Even if I have not succeeded in writing something worthwhile I have certainly  achieved a new level of scandal on jorbrugund. Yes, the scandal of time wasting..... wait that's shit never mind. I have only succeeded in wasting our communal time together, that's ok.  Now, now don't be sad, I'll think of something else to pollute your mind with. Later though, for now I must leave. I think it is a truly sad point where you can't even think of shit anymore.

        Yeah, I got nothing.  Except for lyrics, everyone loves lyrics.  Saint Joe he said he's never been  dressed up like a woman  Saint Joe they said your dad is gay  They said your mom  she's a whore  They said it 'til you  were raw  They said your mom  she's a bore They made her beg them for more My Aunt Mary  Aunt Mary  Aunt Mary says  they have the darkness there in their eyes  Saint Joe he said he's never been made  up like a woman  Saint Joe the time is coming when...  when Mary never will return  When Mary never will come back here...  yeah Mary never will return  O' Mary please  come home  O' my aunt Mary  Aunt Mary  Aunt Mary says they have  the darkness there in their eyes  O' my aunt Mary  Aunt Mary  Aunt Mary says they have the darkness there  They have the family disease  They have the darkness there in their minds  I can't believe how few people recognize a Mary Playground track from the way back. I thought they we're pretty mainstream, but probably two out of three people who ride in my car have no idea who they are.. but they always like it.  Thats right. I miss Evan too. Hes my sunshine on a cloudy day. COME BACK MR SUNSHINE! ..You'll be back.

         BLEEEEEEEAGH. I WANT MY EVAN BACK.  Okay, for the next while all my creative energies are going to be directed elsewhere, so Jorbrugund gets all the lame mental residue that's left over. But at least I'm going to be posting. Again. For sure.  For now, I'll just leave you with some song lyrics.  You are so beautiful To me You are so beautiful To me Can't you see  You're everything I hoped for You're everything I need You are so beautiful to me You are so beautiful to me  You are so beautiful To me Can't you see You're everything I hoped for You're every, everything I need  You are so beautiful to me  Oh Joe Cocker, how you swept us off our feet with your clever and passionate lyrics, and your cocky (pun... hahaha) swagger.

      I was think recently about the importance of choices. Choices are what shape our lives. They effect us and the people around us as well. Sometimes we do not realize how detrimental our choices can be on people. For instance, I had a talk with my friend last night for over 2 hours while we both knew we were to be home. This was a concious choice. However, we did believe that both of our parents were sound asleep and simply would not be effected. My friend's mother in this time, woke up, called my parental figure, and were worried that something had happened to us. We made the decision to stay out and talk. We however, did not look at the circumstances with the value or concern that either one of our parents might have looked at the situation with. Choices are sometimes made with an unknown concequencial conclusion. Sometimes choices will be made that hurt the loved ones around you, and sometimes in the end, because those indaviduals are just that, loved ones, and in turn, the choices that you make emotionally, spiritually, and physically destroy you if one is under a preception of self gradification. This brings you to self destruction. As a result I am grounded. I have brought this punishment upon myself. Now ofcourse, with other circumstances, these self destructing conclusions can be more violent and inflict actual pain on your life. Coming to your factual identity, and realizing this problem alos inflict painful torture for a time. Although through all of this, we must remind ourselves that it is simply for a time. That it in not prolonged our whole entire life and that it may ruin our existance. This is not possible. Suk it up, get better, and try to smile. If you can't, then walk away, and try again the next day.  I cannot speak for all who stem 'Long roads less traveled as their way, Nor question choices made by them In days long past or nights long dim by words they spoke and did not say.  Each road is long, though short it seems, And credence gives each road a name Of fantasies sun-drenched in beams Or choices turned to darkened dreams, To where each road wends just the same.  From North to South, then back again, I followed birds like all the rest Escaping nature's snowy den On roads I've seen and places been, Forsaking roads that traveled West.  This journey grows now to its end, As road reflections lined in chrome Give way to roads with greater bend And empty signs that still pretend They point the way to home sweet home.  But all roads lead to where we go And where we go is where we've been, So home is just a word we know, That space in time most propose For where we want to be again.  For even home, it seems to me, Is still a choice we all must face From day to day and endlessly, To choose if home is going to be Another road - or just a place.   I really believed that this was a beautiful poem. I hope you liked it. Ummm upcoming events, hmmm, if you go to my school and you are reading this, Sean Conley and I are starting up an improv group frdays at lunch. proceeds will go to mission or if I had it my way, aids in Africa. So please, come on out and I will make you chuckle. have fun, hope you enjoyed reading. My e-mail is 'where_am_i07@hotmail.com is there is any questions or comments.

      Hello, To start out this post I am going to simply express some lyrics to a song that really appealed to me. It really expresses how things are and I don't know, I'm emo now for some screwed up reason. Like Evan once said,"Being sad is for losers." and he's completely right. Too bad I'm a loser.  This drowning sorrow is shaking me more than it ever has before the road signs reading bitter end Leave me suspect of a crime  The city air chokes me today more than it ever has before I'm nervous to feel deserved by these street signs anymore  Are you going to be waiting up whenIi get home We'll stay up all night getting drunk and watching sunsets on our porch I'm falling for you I'm falling for you I fell for you  These empty feelings question me of who I think I've become My mind is ticking life away asking if you are the one  Are you going to be waiting up when I get home We'll stay up all night getting drunk and watching sunsets on our porch  I'm falling for you I'm falling for you I fell for you  I'm dying to explain my heart to you now I'm dying to explain my heart to you now there's so much on my mind it's tearing me apart there's so much on my mind it's tearing me apart I'm falling for you I'm falling for you I fell for you  So anyway, I was hanging out with some good friends last night and one of them, the one who was the most influential person in my entire life was expressing how he is going to dress emo because he is sick of wearing complete black. I understand how he is feeling but when I tried to picture such a thing, I couldn't. I cannot fathom what he would look like. However, it proved to me that everyone can change. Everyone can transform, and grow in different ways. Sometimes change is inevitable, and sometimes you must change simply for survival. I like change, and I like to take on new challenges. Actually, when you think about it, something will never change, and if you would like to enjoi the envirment around you, you must conform and change so you are able to fit and cope with the unchangeable. This is all theory and one second thoughts up for discussion. Anyway, here's a poem you can gnaw on.  Mother touches daughters hand- So pale she can barely stand to look into her fading eyes- and fill her head with all these lies "I know better soon, you'll feel" But these words- they aren't real. Tissues with the spattered blood, a failing life- like failing lungs Violently her body shakes and Mother pulls tight the drapes- Even if the sun shone bright The dreary room is void of light Wrapping arms around her child- Mother sits and cries a while Then She murmurs "I love you so" And child whisper "I must let go....."  Have a good day.

      Okay, so I havn't posted in awhile, don't give me shit. I can't sleep, and this is a growing problem among many teenagers today. It is once again, a late night on the old computer, creating art using a keyboard and Microsoft Word. Now these lines may not be directed to my own emotion or lively experience, but more so for either enjoyment, or simply out of empathy. You choice...  Invading stranger in my face, Grabbed a gun and joined the chase. Ran along a freezing stream, To hunt down what can't be seen. Foot prints in the mud, that's all we find, We have to catch the culprit, there's not much time. Running through the trees; tripping on the roots, Feeling the briars scratch my legs as they force their way into my boots. Panting, Sweating, Scratches bleeding, Wondering who in this race is leading. If we don't hurry, will it catch us instead? Will it cruelly torture us and leave us here dead? What is that light, that glows in the snow? It is none other than our fleeing foe. Fallen, Frozen, Stiff as death, Long ago exhaled was its last breath. In the morning, the truth will dawn, For it is us that are truly gone.  Alright, so you know that kind of awkward silence that occurs when you are in a conversation with them and you really either don't wanna be there or you don't have anything to say at all? Well I just thought of that, and it made me feel wierd. Anyway.  Quick to fly, elusive spy  That follows my footprints in the sand.  Closing space of death retake  My memories, sealed and locked away.  Blessed sky, born to fly  But never too high, lest ye never land.  Life upon a gentle windsong  A loss, fleeting, but never dismay.   End, Start.  Through the looking glass you can see Something that you long for and desire You strike the glass to get your prize Only to have it stand firm For this glass is not yours to break Your prize, in wait, on the other side Looking as lovely as before Is the glass really your prize? Or is it even there On behalf of some other will Or, even worse, is it mine Concocted by me To hold myself back I pray not  On to other news, this is infroming everyone that does not know so far that I am striving to be the Co-President of my school. This requires me to write a speech. Tough.  The smoke clears, and the battlecrys end.  Blood drips like beeds of sweat down my face.  On my knees, pain overwhelming,  there is no end to this battle of mind and soul.   Why must I be beat? Why must I be hurt?  Why must I lose my faith,  my sanity,  my life!  There is no one left.  No more sheilds, no more swords.  No more armor, no more arrows.  Just one left,  Me.   I get up,  legs wanting to drop off,  arms aching with pain,  my body is running on empty,  But, I shall not give in,  my heart races,  my soul urges,  and my mind fights.   I run.  I run and run up the hill,  up the hill of Insults,  of slander,  of rumers,  of lies.  Up the hill I fight daily,  never to see it from the top,  because i shall never win...  A man fighting the world's ways in offence is like an uphill battle.  she wallows along the written path  searching for a driven answer  life itself shall overcome the wrath  like a brief windy swirling stir   out between the leaves of wisdom  peering forward are nature’s eyes  lending her powerful hand from  into my soul her heart lies   K, I am getting alittle tired now... thats pretty much the stuff I have written in the last 2 days, but most of it was done in the last hour or two that i was on here. I thank you for reading my creative writing/ art. I really enjoi Jorbrugund, and I hope that it never dies, good night.  In the whisper of spring I walk down a road with my love by my side stroking her back with my hand nudging a smile out of her step by step one closer then the last.  In the whisper of spring we walk into the tangerine sky sunset painting the clouds time slowly stops as we move on two hearts racing in life faster and faster while we run out of sight.  In the whisper of spring our walk paces slower tugging eachother closer the grey night comes out of hiding and a chill covers our lives colder and colder until the first morning light.  - This poem was more personal, and also I would like to let that personal person know that I miss them very much.

      Look out, look out, here comes a viewer contribution, because I really don't have anything better to post. Take it away Tom.    Today there was a bunch of us sitting in the commons just enjoying the tranquillity of numerous one hit wonders being mercilessly shoved down our throats when I had a revelation of sorts [you know, the kind of revelation that everyone has had already but you don't know it yet so you feel kinda special even though you shouldn't.] Every summer has that one song that gets shoved down your throat numerous times and it's never even that good.  Maybe in 1968 they had some good music, but this is the 2004- the future- lost of our music is written by church moms and various other people too ugly to appear on a CD cover. These people work for the multi-billion dollar music corporations, then their songs are presented to us as if they were written by some swanky 'I'm still a virgin' school girl. Frankly, I'm getting sick of it.  Look, this summer we're going to have that one hit song written by homeless people, all the lyrics are going to be formulated from a merger of homeless people's signs...then, as an act of altruism, I motion that we keep only 98% of the profits and give the rest back to the people who need it most...victims of the mid 1990's Dot Com explosion. The only problem with that is that the music video can't be done by homeless people, sure the sex appeal is there...but it's missing that certain something...that's why I propose that we have Gary Coleman stand in as the singer.  Look, the guy has finesse...that and the fact that he is one bad muther [expletive deleted].  C'mon what's cooler than Gary Coleman? Once it's become a smash hit we could even license the name...I see 'Coleman' becoming a house hold brand.  First, we'll license it for a line of flashlights...NO! CAMPING SUPPLIES!  Once we have set up our corporate empire I will take it upon myself to lose most/or all of what we worked for due to a gambling addiction which I will no doubt have to feed at the nearest Chucky Cheese [Calgary International Airport] because I am technically underage and unable to gamble in a so called 'real' casino.  Look, I'm just trying state the obvious: NOBODY can prove that China makes better Green Tea than Japan. It's just not feasible.   Thank you Tom. I'll never look at Gary Coleman so demeaningly again.  I'm off to launder money, play safe kids.

      Greetings everyone. Here is a poem, I hope you enjoi.  Did they love you? Did they hold you? Or were you never good enough... Why did they make you grow up? Grow up too soon.  I could see you were still a child You were for spite, oh strange disdaining You died for love, yet knew not of the emotion  Were you scared in the closet? Was it dark? Was it cold? Was he there?  Breathe child, it's over Take your heels off and stand three feet tall. Are they happy now?  The childhood you never had is now gone, taken so soon Will you ever grow up at all? Yes breathe child, he's gone  The world saw you on television, like a lonely wife, mother of two How old are you? We love you Will you ever grow up at all?

         The Striped Ninja is the most lethal ninja. And the quietest.      How stark, and how ugly. Radiates cold, or does it steal the warmth? I cannot love you, concrete. Keep your cold, quit siphoning the warmth. You cretin of harsh surfaces, you.

      With this change of season comes a change of time. The severity of it throws my world out of balance. My world is prematurely plunged into a dark sea. The time is not right; cannot day linger a bit longer? As I cry out, and wish that time will slow, I realize: There is no stopping this invading darkness…  Hello Ladies & Gentlemen. That introductory poem is simply referring to winter. Does it not make you sad when the days begin to become shorter, and you find yourself sitting in the darkness of your room, somewhere around the time of 8:00 pm? I don't like it one bit. However, there is not much we can do about it.  Lately though, I have comprised a plan to fight this depressing happenstance. You see, the effect of nuclear weapon has recently come to my full attention. I have been taught that if a nuclear weapon had been launch, and the counter launches have occurred, that the atmosphere would be clogged, causing no sunlight to come through. Now sunlight, to me, and to many others, is essential. The temperature would drop, causing it too be something like 200 below 0. You can't live in 200 below 0.  So once again, yes I have comprised a plan. We will create our first ever, dome planet. Much like the Truman Show except that this is not going to be made into a television show. Now, we will have an artificial sun, which will look exactly as if there was a sun it, the sky. This sun will provide warmth, and sunlight to the entire community. Clouds are very easy to simulate, and animals will be brought in. So in a sense, this is like a technologically advanced, Noah's Ark, which cool looks and easy living.  Anyway, that's my post. Pick it apart.

      Hey, here is some lyrics from mellincolin. In my opinion these guys are pretty good if you have any taste for punk. If you don't, you won't like them. Simple as that.... So here you go... enjoi!  MILLENCOLIN LYRICS  "Friends 'Til The End"  First words you say in tears, complaining how I'm never near I know I'm lost sometimes cause I'm grounded in my mind it's like this all the time, first I say you're OK then I go my way and you're desperate, so desperate when you're down.   Here I stand, take my hand and I'll try to understand you right the best way I can, cause after all I am your friend.   Last words you scream to me, you don't expect too much of me cause I could give you anything if I just could be myself. It's like that all the time, first I say that you're OK then I go my way again you're so desperate but still mine.   But now the girl is working, now the girl feels fine and I'm the one who feels down, but if she'll be working until the end of time I hope she'll understand me then, the best way she can cause after all I am her friend till the end.   MILLENCOLIN LYRICS  "Twenty Two"  I'm one year older now since last time I saw you in case you wanna know, I'm about to say what I'm up to first of all I'm a sluggard movin' slow in a clumsy way some peace of mind is what I want, but that will be the day I've been going with the flow for too long now, this must end running 'round in circles, I've been so far away from myself searching for the energy and the time to make a change in my life instead of watching it pass by, get something done while I'm alive.   I'm twenty two, don't know what I'm supposed to do or how to be, to get some more out of me. I'm twenty two, so far away from all my dreams I'm twenty two, feeling blue.   I try to activate myself the best I can  so that boredom won't catch up with me, i've my daily plan wake up late, then rehearse a bit with the band, I guess it's cool? Later when I'm home again I boil a note or two then I go to bed that's what I do.   Afraid that I will be weak forever I can't stay in this shape any longer my life's just another cliche.

      Hello! Sundays suck. Nothing to do today. Lingering around like a creepo, looking for something to do. Well, I read alot, and I wrote. On loose leaf. Scary. This came to me while I was taking a nap. Sometimes emotion that you know is not immortal comes out unexpectedly and there is nothing you can do about it. Even though you know that what is happening around you does not matter, and that you should really not be feeling or acting the way you are, these emotions and actions are almost involentary. They are the unseen killers of one's life. This may, or may not have relevence in my life persay, but read the poem.   After this night I won't be alive all of my pain, Being forced to rise pouring out of my skin this hate I'm forced to fight To strong for me to hold it needs to be let free After this night I won't be alive My curiosity I'm being forced to fight this wonder trying to get out of me knowing what’s going to happen knowing its far from right After this night I won't be alive all of my hopes  being shattered tonight After this night I won't be alive the pain is now draining out through crimson and salty tears the hate exits as i scream I can't believe it got out of me this curiosity causing me to bleed all of my hopes disappear tonight that’s all I had left my mind seems so far from me After this night I won't be alive  Ha. Would it not be cool if you could just laugh things off. Like if you stepped into a cave, and at the end of this cave hung a set of armour. Not armour for any physical portion of your being, but armour for your heart, so that you could honestly my invincable and laugh everything off even though it meant the world to you. I wonder if the world and economy would work out if everyone had one of those caves. Do I want one. I don't think so. I'm not sure though.  This piece is simply about getting to know youself. I like it alot. Favorite one of the day. I am aware that my posts take up to much space at times and become a pain to read for some, so this will be my last entry for the night. Good night, and spend some time to gaze upon the moon. He misses you.  If I became my rejections,  Crumble with the foundation  Rather intertwine with my creations,  End my suffering contemplation.   If I become my idiosyncrasies,  Nit picking at all the trivial  Rather live out my surreal fantasies  From under my shell begins to peel.   Shall i merge with something,  That is significant to me.  I pretended to be nothing  When all i needed was to see.   If I'm becoming my silences  Fade into the blackness of darkness  Rather interject with my senses  Take no more, and give no less   If I am my obsessive paranoia’s  Contrasting along with over analyzing  I'd rather myself re-see my seeings  Sugar-coating all existence for my well-being.

      Hi. I haven't done anything productive for years. But I did make a cool picture in MSPaint. What a night.     It was inspired by an image by  urlLink r.u.s.t.y.  An homage, perhaps.  And here's a poem  Yull tide comes, but once a year Time for drinking all the beer Vomit on the christmas tree Fire water makes you pee  Yeah, fuck you too.

      Okay, this is frustrating. My poetry book is in my best friend, Andrew's, backpack. Yes, this is the same best friend who was made to sware, by his mother, the he would never associate, nor assotiate with anyone that associates with Philip James Harder. Because of this my friends, I cannot contact him on the phone. If I attempt this, and by a chance, Andrew's mother is home, she will simply pick up the phone, and not say anything. This is where I share a small chuckle, and curiously send a hello through to telephone line. Andrew's mother then, to be very immature might I add, hangs up on me.Usually I just laugh, and give up thinking, at least I tried.  So aside from that branch of thought, I refuse to write anything that is not in my poetry book or on here. Thus, I can only write on 'Jorbrugund'. So here is a poem...   Let the air fill my head with idealistic fantasies,  Swinging softly in my head like leaves on a tree. Carry me away into your world of unbridled beauty. Haunting melodies guiding me swiftly into insanity Chained to the sour notes is where I am to stay till death comes to pay a visit. In my dungeon I shudder as shadows dance on the wall,  Flickering like candles, Taunting and tantalizing, The pain of this insufferable torment is being numbed by the pleasures of madness,  Drifting away,  Enraptured in lunacy, No recollection of who I was or who I am, No painful memories left to be reminded of. Only this empty feeling of something left behind, Something I once could never live without, Now living so free not knowing what it was. This gaping hole will terroize my derangement ever lasting. This void? Nothing here in my world to refresh my head, Nothing to give me the feel of belonging or home.  Nothing except the nagging memory of something forgotten.  That poem sucked. Ha.

      What is honor? Sometimes, such a thing can blind you, and lead you into places where you cannot escape from. So, why not humble yourself? Be a follower, a servant. Now who will you be a servant to. Will you sign your life away to a mere human? Or happily surrender to a glorious God?! Immortal or mortal? Life or death? Joy or anguish? Hmm. Anyway, here is a poem that you may enjoi. It really isn't a poem, more so a ryme.   A rich man has the money to ransom his life But a poor man hears no threat  And the dead man is better off than the living But neither is better yet  I try to treat others like I want to be treated But often I forget  I wagered my life on goodness once It was a stupid bet  And now I owe my soul to the devil What a hefty debt  I would say that I wish I could take it back But I live without regret  I just hope that he lets me stay to see the last sunset.   K so I am tired and I am not sure why I feel such an emotion. Today was an excelent day. Happy, and excelent. Very fun. Snow angels? Do you remember snow angels?   Dancing at midnight, out in the snow, The crisp night air refreshes my soul. I reach toward the treetops, they are smiling at me,. A happy creature is what they see. My cold, bare feet upon the ground, Wish i could fly, but i am earthbound. I kick up the powder resting on the dirt. I think i'm turning blue, but it doesn't hurt. Sparkling ice crystals cling to my hair. My clothes are tattered, but i don't care. I smile as the snowflakes fall upon my arms. The magical winter seduces me with all of its charm. Icy wings sprout from my shoulders, It's the Snow Angel's power of which i am the holder. I look at my feathers, where ice-cycles dangle, A frosty complexion and my warm spirit entangle. Spinning and twirling in glittery bliss, Each snowflake on my cheek gives a small frozen kiss. My snow dusted wings stretch far toward the sky, Now i don't have to walk becasue i can fly.

      I have recently been informed how successful our little blogger actually is. With 78 posts, I guess this blog isn't so little after all.  So, it is early in the morning and I am sorry to infrom you that I did not have enough time to brush my teeth. Right as we speak I am in hand to hand combat with bad breath. Desperately trying to find a piece of gum, I must write an in class essay in next period. Very stressful. After I get through that day though, it is smooth sailing. I must say that my day will turn out to be very productive if everything gos as it's suppose to and I do not fall into the depths of temptation and slack. Later I will post some poetry and commentary. But for now all I can offer you is this. Good-day

        Evaporated  by Ben Folds  What I've kept with me and what I've thrown away And where the hell I've ended up on this glary random day Were the things I've really cared about just left along the way For being too pent up and proud  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see what I've done God, what have I done  Don't you know I'm numb, man? I can't feel a thing at all Now it's all smiles and business these days, I'm indifferent to the loss I have faith that there's a soul somewhere that's leading me around I wonder if she knows which way is up and which is down  I poured my heart out I poured my heart out It evaporated ... see?

      Hello Folks, how are you today. It is kind of early to write, and to tell you the truth I am not really in the mood, but I wrote a poem earlier this morning about me. Haven't you ever wondered what people will say to you after you are gone? After you have left this world? As I ran with this idea, I came up with this poem. It puts a positive twist on death and hopes for the best... Good-Day.  If I was gone tomorrow, would I be missed? When I am gone and my name is on St. Peter's list, I want people to go on with their lives as normal, A simple tribute will do, nothing formal. If I was gone tomorrow, would I be satisfied, Would I have accomplished something before I died? Have I made an influence in anyone I've met? Did I change someone's life before in the ground I am set? If one person is better because of me, If only for a minute a smile I did see, Then I believe that it was worth all the time I was here And I hold in my heart all my friends close and dear. If I was gone tomorrow, would people even care? Would they even notice that I was not there? I know some people would not be upset about me Those people, at my funeral I would not see. If no one was there, I would be sad, But in a way, I would be glad. I don't want anyone to be sad that I am not here, I don't want them to be sad or even shed a tear. I want to see them with a smile on their face, And not to see sadness in this case, I just want them to be happy that they knew me, And for them to know that I am finally set free. I will still be around anyhow, Even though they cannot see me now. I'll still be here to help heal hearts, Maybe now I can stop the pain before it starts. So do not be sad that I have gone away, Because in your heart, I will stay. As long as you continue to believe, There is no real reason to grieve. I'll still be around somewhere near, And you can call on me, and I'll be here.   Well have a good night and be safe. Most of all, you must remember that the Giraffes are in the Geraniums.

      God, I went back and re-read some of the previous entries. I remembered so much, and so much has changed. The nostalgia is unbearable. Things I want to relive, things I want to go back and change, things I wish were still the same... The time past is an voracious monster, it swallows up my thoughts and consumes my heart. I'm trapped there now. It's a whole other place,  stange and familiar. Strangely familiar.  I guess I'm just in a stupid, introspective mood right now. Don't mind me. Keep your own chin up, bright eyes.

      Here's news. I've gone insane.  I like this picture.     This is my day so far:    webfit doorways. long barefoot walking down a long square hall. the ceiling is low here. lions are kept in pens, also. lions and me.    I'd also like you to meet Shannon Hoon's ghost, whenever you can.
