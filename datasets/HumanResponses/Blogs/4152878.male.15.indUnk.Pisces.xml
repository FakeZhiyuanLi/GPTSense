      i recently bought 2 movies.  Ronin and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  Both are great movies and if you haven't either of them, i highly recommend them.  Ronin has Robert De Niro in it... so you'll know it's good.  I also have a newly found respect for Rocapella, and have been listening to them a lot lately.

      it's been a pretty good week.  but the best part about it is that my braces were finally removed.  I then however had to go to driver's ed, which isn't all that great

      Can’t stop addicted to the shin dig Cop top he says I’m gonna win big Choose not a life of imitation Distant cousin to the reservation Defunkt the pistol that you pay for This punk the feeling that you stay for In time I want to be your best friend Eastside love is living on the westend Knock out but boy you better come to Don’t die you know the truth is some do Go write your message on the pavement Burnin’ so bright I wonder what the wave meant White heat is screaming in the jungle Complete the motion if you stumble Go ask the dust for any answers Come back strong with 50 belly dancers  [chorus:] The world I love The tears I drop To be part of The wave can’t stop Ever wonder if it’s all for you The world I love The trains I hop To be part of The wave can’t stop Come and tell me when it’s time to  http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/red-hot-chili-peppers/114720.html

      Chorus: How long how long will I slide Separate my side I don’t I don’t believe it’s bad Slit my throat It’s all I ever I heard your voice through a photograph I thought it up it brought up the past Once you know you can never go back I’ve got to take it on the otherside  Centuries are what it meant to me A cemetery where I marry the sea Stranger things could never change my mind I’ve got to take it on the otherside Take it on the otherside Take it on Take it on  http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/red-hot-chili-peppers/114741.html

      Well, trevor and I went on his jet ski yesterday and it was a blast.  It was so wavy and windy, it was crazy... we'd whip around hitting whitecaps everywhere.  Only problem was that we got a little bit of water mixed in with the gas... so it died in the middle of the lake.  Luckily, we were able to drift into madi's dock and her brother was able to tow us back.  fun times

      I got back from Colorado this morning.  The Cavaliers won the drum corps championship... it was very cool.  they did a 007 rendition or whatever you'd call it.  it was sweet

      It's getting late into the night or should i say early in the morning?  My favorite bands at the time are the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Yellowcard.  The only  problem that i have with them both, is that if one of their songs isn't good... it really really sucks.

      I'm having a great week in Colorado.  First we went to Colorado Springs and did fun stuff there, then went to an old mining town called Leadville (it's the town of highest elevation in the U.S.).  Today we went to the first rounds of the Drum and Bugle Corps Championships.  for those of you who don't know what that is, it's the kind of stuff they did in Drumline.  i get back sunday, see ya then.
