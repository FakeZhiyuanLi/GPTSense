      the morning was kicked start with an extremely heavy rain. it was raining cats and dogs, cows and monkey, elephants and pigs. it was super heavy to the extend that i cound actually not see the block opposite mine. maybe coz i wasnt wearing specs. hahaha.. then without having breakfast, rushing through the rain, i want for my musik lesson.  lesson was quite alright. after 4 years, my teacher finally ask me if i wanted to have musik exams. strangely, i felt this sense of overwhelming happiness within me and immediately agreed to it. hahaha.. im queer ya..? well.. i dunnoe la. ha.  went to sch and perform for college day. someone told my friend and my friend told me that i sing really well and as if it were musik from heaven. ha. well, my ego and head were sufficiently capacious. hahaha.. i was trilled. ha.  had bible study today and i realise that samson was a very poetic man (well that's what i think). haha. hmm.. as usual, bible study was very provocative and i was just wondering is it true that whatever questions people asked are&nbsp;actually the preoccupations of their life..? have no idea man. maybe its true. what do you think..?   "stop having this delusion which you allude to just to elude from reality. this is only an illusion."

BUT.. when i was in the lift, i realise that i didnt bring my key. GREAT..!! so had to call my mom and she wasnt free to pick up my call.. hence had to sit at the steps of my door like a fool. &nbsp; later meet my mom to get keys from her la.. and when i was on my way there, when walking into the lift i could actually knock against the wall.. what was that..? i think i have been curse or something. so irritating. &nbsp; after i got the key, i went to meet shu wen with her friends sam and serene. i was stoning with shu wen, serene, sam.(alliteration) hahaha.. guess what, i was actually gossiping with them abt my fairfield friends. super dotz lo.. saw quite alot of people at queensway today. ya.  &nbsp; though i feel that i have been cursed and i had the worst day in my life.. but i guess there&nbsp;are definately other people out there who are much worse off then me la. hmm.. seems like im not&nbsp;that cynical after all.. hmm.. what do u think..?

      hmm. i think recently i've got a problem but dont know how on earth do u term it though. nevermind la. not very important.  anyway, today singapore just change prime minister. yup. and he is Mr Lee Hsien Loong. hmm, was watching the ceremony just now and find that he is quite of a demagogue. quite charming when he was making his speech. yup. i hope under him singapore will continue to prosper like the days under Mr Lee Kwan Yew and Mr Goh Chok Tong. yup. :)  hmm. this time the new cabinet has got females. is this like carving a new path for the position of women in this society..? as now women seems to have less privilege compared to man.  are women just mere property of man..?  well, it seem to me so though. i just hope that all this will change and please DO NOT despise women.  today got back my chinese result. didnt got what i wanted la. but at least i did better than the last time so not so bad la. my chinese result is very queer one. i got distinction for chinese oral but i merely pass for overall. this means that my written paper is very lousy. but if my written paper is lousy, why is it that i can speak chinese well..? weird. as i said, queer.  well, recently i got tangled in this web. everything is seemingly complicated but i hope that im the one in ultimate control. i call this web entanglement a game. i hope that emotions wouldnt be implicated while playing. well, this game is kinda fun and it keeps me hooked onto it and addicted. if possible, i'll introduce it to u one day. hope you'll like it as i do. :)  sigh. ambivalence.

      hai.. the more i think of myself the more cynical i think im.    im discontented with the thinness of life.    i just find that one more day we live is actually one more day nearer to our death day. so, we are practically living to die. waiting for our death day. our actual aim in life is to keep ourselves as occupied as possible before we die. so, all that we aquire when we live is actually for nothing as one day when we die, we'll not be able to bring anything with us.  what's the point..?  why do people still go on and pursue fame and wealth..? what's the point..? one day when we die, we'll not be able to bring anything. so might as well live a peaceful and happy life without worry, care, stress and sit there to wait for our death. what's the point..? even if u are rich, you'll still have to die. if u live a life without achieving anything, you'll still die. if you have to go through torture, pain and sorrow just to be rich and ultimately die, might as well live a low-key life and die. maybe you'll be happier when u live. nobody will remember how much you achieve after you die. so, what's the point..?  love..? what's  love ..?    love is nothing but a self-induced emotion.      in this world, there is no such thing as love between 2 strangers. all the so-called "love" is derive from fondness and self-induced into the so-called "love". everyone make believe that they are "in love" with the one whom they have physical attraction to. "love" is actually just a physical attraction and is only temporal unless you force yourself to renew the fondness you have. there is no such thing as love between 2 strangers. what's the point of getting married..?    what's the point of everything in life..?

      im so despondent, so dejected, so gloomy, so sad.  have u ever tried so hard just to reap nothing..? guess what, i just failed my econ test. got zero for my part a la. i dont understand why. now the more i think of it the sadder i feel. the sense of uselessness, motiveless, meaningless just overwhelm me. this pain is really overpowering that i feel entrapped in reality. how can i elude reality..?  did u realise that i have this disease..? it is called spelling deficiency: a disease in which no matter how u try, u just cannot remember the spelling of the simplest words but can remember the more difficult words like paradigm, paramount, anagnorisis.. etc. the inability to spell simple words is extremely embarrassing and it is like taking the shit out of the toilet bowl and sticking it right to ur face for others to laugh at.  how can we change the reality we are living in..? can we elude it or allude it to utopia..? if you were to trade one thing for another, what would they be..?     "if only i could turn back time, i would give up everything just to be with you again."
