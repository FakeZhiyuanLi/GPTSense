      So last weekend I went to my second Pride Parade in Toronto.  Much fun was had with only a few minor disagreeable moments.  I left Kingston early Friday morning with my friend Dan and stayed in a really great hostel along Church St.  We even had a friendly hello from a girl staying in our room the first night and who proceeded to have sex with her girlfriend while I waited for Dan to get out of the washroom (there's only so much rustling I can do!).    Anyway, the first night Dan and I checked out a Carribean band playing at the South stage and sat down to watch the crowds, that is, until a crazy fat man with no shirt decided to sit beside me and sing at the top of his lungs . . . it was time to go.  Saturday was the Dyke March which was great, but why is it always the women who shouldn't be taking their shirts off who love to so much?  Another of life's mysteries.  I did sit next to a really cute lesbian couple with a three-year-old girl who was adorable.  She kept walking out in the middle of the street to see when the March was coming, later she threw some of her mom's money in the street, very funny.    Later Dan and I met up with Amy and Alex who were joining some other girls at the women's beer garden which was very tempting but I wouldn't abandon my faggy friends!  They really need some more inclusive events.  When James met up with us the overpriced drinking began and a little later his friend Duncan joined us and more drinking was had.  That night after two more of James friends had joined us, all of us walked over to the drag stage where there were some really great drag queens doing Cher, Chicago, and various other numbers.  As a little aside, Drag Queen's are just sooooo great, they make everything more fun, end of story.  There was also a really great Hedwig and the Angry Inch band playing but we had to choose and the drag show won out.    This brings us to Sunday, if ever there was a gay holy day this is it, a million people crammed themselves into a few blocks to watch half naked, all out naked, drag queens, and various other crazy costumed people parade down Yonge St. to dance music.  Props to the gay bagpipe band and the huge peacock dress which took three guys to pull it!  Hopefully I can find someone with a scanner and put a few pictures on here someday.  The parade was about two and half hours long and we had to line up outside the guardrails an hour earlier to secure a spot to see, so people started complaining their legs were sore and decided to walk the rest of the parade and sit down somewhere.  Dan decided he didn't want to and he'd meet me later at the drag stage again, but unfortunately due to one of our party wanting to check out some very lame merchandise we were late and I couldn't find him.  This wouldn't have worried me so if he hadn't had the key to the locker where my bag was, but it turned out alright in the end when we met up at the hostel.    I arrived home at 3:00am and found my cat's food and water dish were empty and her litter packed to the hilt.  I don't know if the person taking care of her forgot but she was not a happy kitty.  After filling her dishes and some snuggling all was forgiven :)    So that's about it, but I'll leave you with a quick commentary.  The Pride Parade does seem to have lost its meaningfulness as an anniversary for the Stonewall Riots and become very very over corporatized.  That's not to say I think it shouldn't happen, we shouldn't be naive in thinking the majority still wouldn't like to pretend queer people don't exist and that reaffirmation of our community isn't important, but multiple times this weekend people asked why this event was even needed and at one point I was told the queer community doesn't even have a history to celebrate!  This is very sad and shows a terrible lack of education among queer youth, Pride week should be one time of the year that the community does take the time to educate them and give them a better hold of queer culture than just a big party. People need more than that if they're going to develop a true sense of pride to celebrate.

       urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     So I've relented and have finally entered the world of blogs.  I wish I could say this is due to some love of writing but, alas, it is born out of my laziness at writing e-mails to my friends.  I'll still attempt to write individually to all of you, but at least this way those of you I don't see often can keep up with my daily travails (because I know my life interests you so, as it should!).  I would say daily adventures but c'mon let's be honest, my life is hardly an adventure - unless you count all those car chases, explosions, and . . . oh yeah that's a movie I saw not my life, so travails it is then.

      Today has been incredibly boring. I'm talking watching paint dry kinda boring, but it's actually a good thing because it'll finally motivate me to get a move on with the whole job situation. I thought the boredom would set in much earlier than this, like June 1st, but luckily (unluckily?) it's just been a kick ass summer. Nothing much has happened since James left. Dan and I went over the Queer Social Scene constitution for AMS ratification and then proceeded to play three hours of UNO with Naila at the Goat. Tonight I'll be hanging out with Dan once again for our regularly scheduled games night (I do believe there will be some crazy aerobie action in the park!) so I thought I'd pass a little time until then by writing a mindless update for you guys (awww, can't you feel the love?).  So tomorrow I've been invited to play on Amy and Alex's baseball team which should be fun. They're last in the league so I guess I can't hurt them in the standings :) Amy has informed me there is quite the cute British grad student who she'd like me to get to know as well. I'll likely meet her tomorrow at the game.  I'm hoping baseball is one of those sports where ass patting is an acceptable form of encouragement. I just want to be a part of the team!  I'll leave you with a little quote I read today and really liked: "I'd rather have something to love than a way to impress you." I know, sappy, but important to think of.  p.s. for those of you not in Kingston or to whom I don't talk to regularly, uh hem uh hem, I do believe I need an update on your lives!

      Heeellloooo!&nbsp; I've been absent this past week due to my friend James visiting.&nbsp; We were bored one day so I sent him a train ticket so he could get his ass up here and we never looked back.&nbsp; Some highlights:  Getting drunk on wine in a movie theatre while watching the horrible movie I Robot.&nbsp; I was first hesitant to do this but I don't know how I would have gotten through it sober.&nbsp; Props to James for knocking over the bottle not once but twice after explaining to him where it was (very funny).&nbsp; Luckily the couple in front of us was totally cool and gave us permission to get drunk.  Taking the ferry over to&nbsp;Wolfe Island one afternoon and watching James try to ride&nbsp;a racing&nbsp;bike we borrowed (racing bike=not good sight seeing, oh and issues with the brake).&nbsp;  Hanging out at the CFRC radio station discussing and picking out music to play while Lauren did her show.  Attempting to play aerobie (frisbee but a ring instead of a flat disk) in the dark, you laugh but it was fun with all the confusion, truuuuust me.  James getting his tattoo!&nbsp; I made fun of him but he's tough as nails, really . . . I'm serious . . . &nbsp;really.&nbsp; He got the Hobbit dragon on his lower back.  Saw the Bourne Supremacy, a very excellent film (even if Scott does say differently, all I have to say is&nbsp;. . . Spice World, my God you went to see Spice World, so your opinions on movies mean nothing!).&nbsp; Also, almost witnessed old people start a riot when the sound in the theatre was too low.  Made a kick ass mix cd for James' birthday party which started at my place and continued at Shoeless Joe's.&nbsp; Despite no one else drinking much, James and I still got rip roaringly drunk and had a great time.&nbsp; A big thanks to James for talking with me while I lied on the floor trying to drink water and making me toast that morning.&nbsp; The next day, we went to Stooley's and had an Italian burger with fries, such good hangover food.  I'm obviously leaving out many other great times but they mainly consisted of eating incredible amounts of food, hanging out at the Goat and friends' houses, and of course more nights of boozing.&nbsp; Alright, that's all I can think of at the moment so I'll go.&nbsp; I'll update again soon, I promise . . . what you don't believe me?&nbsp; Pffft . .&nbsp;. whateva!   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So it seems there's been quite the flood in Peterborough.&nbsp; Guess I lucked out by going last week when everything was dry, although admittedly the disaster does make Peterborough a more interesting place now :)&nbsp; Seriously though, it's sad to see the damage being done to people's homes.&nbsp; I haven't heard anything about Scott yet but hopefully all is well on his end.&nbsp; My brother's house fared well and only suffered a leak in the kitchen ceiling, however he did have a difficult time getting to work.&nbsp; The above pictures are a couple he took on his way in to the Trent building he works in.&nbsp; He has to go in no matter what weather because he takes care of the animals housed there.&nbsp; At first he attempted driving, but after three different routes proved futile, he got out his bike and lifted it over his head while wading through the deeper parts of water.&nbsp;

      Warning!  Rant directly ahead, be advised.    Alright I gotta get something off my chest.  I've been slightly perturbed over these past couple months over the fact that I'm seemingly looked down upon for not being gung ho about getting a job or in fact just doing something with my life.  It seems taking a couple months to relax and simply be is not enough for people.  Somehow we live in a culture and a generation which defines our own and eachother's self-worth by what we DO.  I'm an _____, I've travelled to _____ and ______, I've met _____, I've written _____, etc.  Many times I have been asked what I DO, what I'm going to DO, what have I DONE.  When I respond that I don't have a job, have no idea what I want to do, and since graduation haven't really looked for something to do and am nonetheless enjoying myself, I'm greeted with incredulity if not silence and then some remark disguised as friendly joking, interest, or advice.  If I don't have a job right away, I should be travelling, volunteering, writing a novel, something, but waking up everyday with no agenda but to relax and enjoy myself is not enough somehow.  The latter conjures up labels of lazy, selfish, and irresponsible. But maybe I am, because all my life I've watched people fill their days with things to do, rushed, anxious, lashing out at anything that may slow them down, feeling like a failure if things don't get done, watching the clock, fearing the clock.  If this is what we deem motivated, unselfish, and responsible behaviour, I can't help but be wary of falling into that.  I want no part of it.    Always thinking two, three, four steps ahead instead of the present.  There needs to be balance, sure I think of the future and what to do with myself, what will happen, in fact I like a certain amount of predictability in my life, chaos while sometimes needed, should only be had in small doses.  But living in the former way is just as lazy, selfish, and irresponsible.  I look back on my childhood and see my mother doing everything she possibly could but never having time to play with her children or sit in the backyard.  Even when she stopped for a few moments to "relax" we could always see a million things going through her mind, she was never really THERE with us.  We felt guilty for wanting her to spend time with us, taking her away from what she had to DO.    I want to be in the present, I want to appreciate it and I give thanks every day that I have the OPPORTUNITY to do nothing for a little while.  I shouldn't be made to feel ashamed of that.  Doing seemingly nothing is important sometimes.  Personally I think some of the reason behind the reactions I get has more to do with a fear people hold of having to look in themselves for their worth as well as the fear of simply having to look IN themselves.  Filling our days and constantly planning the future are wonderful ways in which to avoid feelings and issues that we hold inside, stopping things sometimes means confronting things, a much harder thing to do.   When I'm introduced to someone I don't want them to be told what I do or have done, I want them to be told who I am, and when I'm with my friends, family, and maybe one day children, I want to be 100% there with them and for them to feel free to ask for as much of my time as they like, it's a compliment to them and I both.  Alright, I won't babble on anymore, I gotta get going.

      I'm back! Did you all miss me?  Oh no need to answer that, I know you did ;)  My week was pretty good.  My mom did her best to fatten me up and bought me a few delightful things for my apartment.  I've also found out she has a new strategy to "encourage" my search for a job.  She takes me in all sorts of stores, particularly ones with furniture, and shows me beautiful pieces I can have if I get a job.  This way she doesn't have to nag me.  I must admit this is an ingenious strategy and almost involved her dragging me off a table I fell in love with, good times.    I also briefly saw my dad.  He picked me up on his new Harley and we went for a ride along the river and stopped for a drink.  I have to say, the past couple of visits with him haven't been as stressful as I imagined they'd be and I can see more of myself in him than ever before.  Although there are still big differences, I'll give you a story that sums him up the best:  I was walking the dog that morning in the forest behind my mom's house and a partridge flew out in front of me making quite a raucous, when I told him this he recounted how only a few days before he'd come across a partridge too and it got so scared it flew right into the wall of the house across the road.  He went over to check it out (and here's where I thought he was concerned for it's health) and decided to kill it and eat it that night for dinner :)  Oh boy, I can't help but laugh, he was so pleased with it.  Last night I went over to Amy and Alex's to watch The Last Samurai.  I can't say I'm a fan of Tom Cruise but he didn't do too badly in this one, I liked it.  I also found out I can download The L Word through Kazaa, so I saw my first episode yesterday.  Having only seen one it's hard to form a solid opinion, but one thing I do know is that every woman in that show is getting way more lovin' than me.  I love watching it but man what a downer when it's over and it only reaffirms your lack of a girlfriend.  Ah well, it's a sweet pain if anything :)  It also doesn't help that I'm listening to Norah Jones as I write this too, starts makin' feel longing and crap, hold on I'll change it to something else . . . oh yeah a little Annie Lennox vs. Superman Lovers will cheer me up!  Well I guess I'll finish this by saying, I am looking really good today, these days are very rare and the fact I don't have anyone else to appreciate this, I'll just have to share that with you ;)  Smooches for all.

      I've gotten a call from the mothership and am on my way home today.  My mother rarely takes time off so I'm going to be spending the next week with her.  I'll be in Long Sault until Tuesday where I'll be eating as much free food as I possibly can and lolling about the backyard talking to my mom while she weeds :)  I've convinced her it would be fun to come and stay with me in Kingston for Tuesday and Wednesday before going to the oh so thrilling city of Peterborough to visit my judgemental homophobic brother and his wife(yay, I'm sure you can imagine my excitement).   So all in all I expect it to be a pretty good week, although I will inevitably have to go through the barrage of questions and quizzical looks of each family member over what I want to do with my life and when I'm going to be getting the ever elusive boyfriend. "But Grampa, I'm a big dyke you silly man", hmmm I don't think that would be so good for his heart.  Really though I can't say I'm a big dyke.  I'm kinda small and more androgynous, so really it would be something like "but Grampa, I'm a small androgynous woman loving woman you silly man", but somehow it just doesn't have the same ring to it.   Last night I went out with some friends to have a few drinks and check out the fireworks.  The show lasted maybe ten minutes and was so disappointingly lame but the beer made up for it :) Fireworks just make me happy, every year when I was little the family would go down to the river front and watch the fireworks (which seemed amazing but I now realize were probably lame as well for the adults).  We'd always buy those glow sticks or whatever they sell, and just being allowed to stay up past ten was somehow magical.  Funny, these days I wish I could get to sleep by ten.  Ah well, I'll stop rambling and wish you all a good week!

      In case any of you wanted to post a comment and couldn't, it's not that I don't care, I do, I really really do - I'm just an idiot and forgot to change a setting (applause).  I know soooo many of you wanted to post, I sincerely apologize and will now hang my head in shame.  So now you can post to your heart's delight my pretties!  I know, now that I've said this there will be no posts, oh well.  What's that? (crickets in the distance)

      Hello there ladies and gents.  Well once again I have gone out drinking and come back with more injuries (it's a talent really), but I'll start from the beginning.  Yesterday began by going down to Keystone's office and signing my life away for a two bedroom apartment.  So if any of you are in Kingston you have a place to stay - i.e. get your asses to Kingston to visit me - and for those of you in Kingston, you have a place to escape to if you so desire.  But I digress.  Afterward I went down to the Goat and started to work on my cover letter until I realized I had to boot it back home and make dinner before the baseball game.  It turned out though that I had the wrong time and didn't really need to rush so instead I biked down to Source For Sports where Alex works and hung out with her until we could leave for the game.    Once we got there I naturally displayed my amazing baseball talent by barely hitting the ball and screwing up on a line drive, I'll pause here for some applause . . . . alright, so this is where it starts to get interesting.  After the game (which we won by the way), most of the team went to the Grad Club to drink and be merry.  I met some kick ass new friends, especially Jeremy who's incredibly sweet and hilarious.  Well I lost count how many pitchers we went through but we got kicked out at 2am by the staff.  Alex and I continued our tradition of peeing in public by crossing the road and going in front of the court house - once you say?  Oh no, try several times, by the end of the night pretty much the whole team had peeed on or near the court house.  I don't know why we felt we were being discreet by going in front with all the spotlights on, but logic was no where to be found at that point.  So Alex is pretty shit faced and I'm feeling good, so we decide to get everyone to go down to the lake for some skinny dipping action.  Turned out it was just her, another guy, and I that actually went in the water, the three others politely watched and likely made fun of us as we were pelted with waves, but it was all good.   Sidebar:  everyone liked my new striped turtle underwear,  I was pleased.  Once the naked swimming was over, we walked Claire home (lovely lovely Claire who I can't have) and then I picked up my bike at the Grad Club and went home.  All in all, a great night.   This morning though I paid the price and was in, shall we say, an uncomfortable state as I began to feel the effects of smashing my right hand and feet against the rocks.  Oh well, yet again, it was totally worth it.

      Holy cow did I have a great weekend!  Or rather, Saturday night.  In the afternoon I first met up with Amy and Claire for tea at the Goat (yes, the Goat again).  I love just sitting there with friends relaxing.  Later we caught the ferry to go over to Wolfe Island and check out the music festival they were having.  Artists like Jill Barber, The Sadies, and Joel Plaskett were playing, from what I can remember it was very good.  We immediately headed over to the beer tent and it wasn't long before we were making asses out of ourselves, oh wait sorry, I was making an ass out of myself.   Everyone got completely plastered, here's some point form happenings:  - Melissa picking me up and running across the grassy sit down area and falling (naturally dropping me in the process) - Alex and I peeing in a children's school yard - Alex, Claire and I, going to a 19th century graveyard - Alex and I running into the lake (Alex was kind enough to put my shoes on afterward) - Peeing in the bushes directly behind the port-a-potties, oh not once my friends, that's all I'll say - Alex picking me up and falling in the parking area (again naturally dropping me in the process) - Two guys trying to pick us all up on the ferry (metaphorically speaking this time).  It took them a while but they finally realized there was no action to be had and if there was to be action, they certainly weren't allowed to watch - Skinny dipping in a pool behind a huge mansion.  One of the girls, who wasn't going to join us, lived in the basement and had the key for the gate.  Let me just say, as fun as skinny dipping can be, doing it on a cold night in a cold pool is not such a good idea.  On the other hand, I was surrounded by naked ladies . . . enough said. - Unfortunately I only ended up sleeping with a hot water bottle that night as I couldn't stop shivering - Woke up with a really bad hangover but didn't throw up miraculously!  I also discovered a huge welt on my lower back from being thrown to the ground a couple times and some mysterious bruises - Went and picked up McDonald's for myself, Amy and Alex, and watched tv for a while at their place. - And to top everything off, went and played some baseball with a few friends.  So all in all, a fabulous weekend.  I can only pray for more!

      Well I've found a job that has peeked my interest finally, unfortunately I think it's a little out of my league, but after talking with a couple friends, I've decided to throw my hat in the ring so to speak.  The worst that can happen is they have a good laugh at my expense and throw it out, in which case I'll have at least learned a bit about selling myself.  Oh yeah, by now you're probably wondering what this said job is, it's official title is part-time festival director for Reelout queer film and video festival.  It has a ton of responsibilities but it would be fabulous experience for me and probably a lot of fun.  The pay is really good too and I get the feeling (although they don't say this) that it could possibly turn into a full-time position in the future given proper funding.  The final submission date is next Friday so I have to get my ass in gear and I'm not quite sure how I'll get some references by then but I'll figure it out.   Another problem would be that I don't think I'd be able to go to Germany if I did get it.  This Germany trip is turning into a real problem.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to go and I want to see my friend but I'm not going to have any money to do anything when I get there and it's going to take away two very important job search/money making weeks in the middle of september.  I don't think there's much I can do though, it's non-refundable.  The only thing I can think of is trying to sell it and that's if Air Canada would allow me to switch names on the ticket.  I have a feeling whether I like it or not, I'll be sitting in Berlin for two weeks, and yes I know there's worse things but at this point it would be a real pain in the ass and I'd be freakin' out over everything I have to do when I get back anyway.  Bah!  But Mindy if you're reading this, don't feel bad, I'll still be happy and fun promise.  It's not like I'm going to be a bitch for those two weeks, I'll be determined for us to have a good time! :)  On another note, I caught another bat the other day.  Flew out of the kitchen as I was watching tv one night.  Luckily I was able to get it to fly out the door and I haven't seen it since.  I hope my next place doesn't have any pest problems, it'll be the first question I ask!  I go Monday at 2:30 to check a few places out with my mom.  I already have my heart set on the most expensive one before I've even seen it, but the outside looks great and it has a big rear deck (which is the roof of an extension on to the building but doesn't look too bad).  It's also supposed to be a two level unit with lots of windows around it.  There's four other places I'll be seeing as well and it'll probably come down to what my mom feels I should do.  Not that I have to do what she says but I take her opinion very seriously and without her support on something, I just don't feel I could take the risk of signing a 12 or 13 month lease.

      Well I found out this morning that while I'm not very good with wood bats, I am good with live ones.  I woke up to a bat hanging from my living room ceiling.  I tried to think of multiple ways to get it out and decided using my baseball glove should do the job, but first I got dressed after debating whether to sneak out in my pj's.  So I get this thing in my mit and go outside and place it beside the front stairs, thinking it could crawl underneath to be somewhere dark.  I go back inside and (drum roll please) . . . the door is locked.  I was so concerned about the bat, I forgot about the automatic lock on my door.  So after some swearing, the only option I had was to walk to Dan's house barefoot in the rain to get my spare key.  Thank God I got dressed!  I get there and knock until he finally gets up and then proceed back to my apartment, meanwhile holding my head high as people think I'm a crazy girl.  So that was my little adventure this morning, I just hope it wasn't an omen of how the rest of my day will go.

      So I thought the baseball game would be cancelled on Saturday due to the copious amounts of rain in Kingston but it stopped long enough for the game to go on. I was still a little hesitant but Alex ordered me to play after dropping off a brownie for her at work, there was no arguing. I hadn't played since my grade 8 baseball tournament but luckily no one on the team was overly proficient so I actually blended in quite well. I met Claire, the english chick Amy kept telling me about, but didn't get to talk to her very much. She's cute but unfortunately that situation with the other girl has gotten a little more difficult in that the other girl's come to the decision that she does want to make a go of it. So I guess that's strike two for me this year, ouch!  After the game I tagged along with Amy, Alex, Amy's sister, and sister's fiancée Jazz, for take-out from East Side Mario's. Jazz even bought me a beer while we waited for our food. Just as he was returning from the bar with the beer the waitress arrived with the food. There was only one thing we could do - down the beer as fast as possible. We then went to Amy and Alex's where we watched some home video of the wedding proposal and laughed at Amy's father's reaction which was to yell out the Clan's war cry.  The next day I had to wake up at the ungodly hour of 6:00am. Dan rented a car this past weekend to go up for Montreal's pride parade, and he was kind enough to offer me a ride as well but instead I asked him to drop me off in Long Sault to go surprise my mom and visit for the day. Turned out it was a good decision since I woke up that morning feeling awful. As soon as I arrived (and after reassuring her nothing was wrong), she had me on the couch with a pillow and a cup of tea. Luckily, it wasn't long before I felt a bit better and we walked around, saw how her flowers were doing, and had a couple glasses of wine. I also wanted her reassurance on the decision I'd come to that I was going to start apartment hunting this week. She agreed that it would be a good idea and even said she'd take a day off and join me if I could arrange the viewings all on the same day, which is great.  Today I ended up shopping with Dan since he had the car for another day. Some drinking glasses and a new Adidas shirt were purchased (I ruined my other one due to an unfortunate laundry mutilation). We also went to Le Chateau so he could buy some pants and a couple shirts. I haven't been in one of those stores for so long, it felt very strange. All the girl's clothes are so girly to the tenth power (shudder). We were supposed to go to Costco and Loblaw's for groceries but this part of the plan fell through as they were both closed, so we dropped the car off and called it a day. Other than that, I went for tea with Heather and got caught up on all her adventures and now I'm waiting for a call from Amy and Alex on whether they're interested in going for a blizzard later, mmmm brownie blizzard. You know you want one.   You still want one.
