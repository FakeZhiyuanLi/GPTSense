      Excellent (as usual) post by  urlLink Radley Balko  on  urlLink this article  concerning praise heaped upon some youths for advocating a "War on Alcohol."  A comment by yours truly is also at the link.  I depart from Radley somewhat, but only in terms of focus: All government policies (indeed, all human decisions) should be subjected to cost-benefit analysis.  Radley decimates the youths' defintion of "cost" while I prefer to emphasize the neglect of the aggregate "benefits" of alcohol.

       urlLink Dean to debate Nader.   It will be interesting to see if Kerry is even discussed at this event...or will it be just more  urlLink "Beat Bush" folderol .  Sidebar: Clearly Dean has been promised a cabinet position in a Kerry administration in exchange for his support.  I wonder which (hopefully we'll never find out!).

      Story in today's Wall Street Journal (subscription site -- sorry), describing new local laws holding supermarkets, Wal-Marts, etc., responsible for shopping carts stolen by customers, juvenile delinquents, the homeless, etc., and then abandoned.  Some towns are imposing fines, while others are passing laws requiring prevention methods, such as beepers, wheel locks, etc.  Seems to me that if I go to the local Home Depot, steal a shopping cart, use it in a way not sanctioned by Home Depot, then dispose of it in a way also not sanctioned by Home Depot, then the problem is with me, not with Home Depot.  I'm the one committing crimes and torts.  Why go after the merchant?  Simple: because they can.   urlLink Reductio  scenario: Someplace will start imposing a tax on hardware stores that sell spray paint to fund anti-grafitti programs.  (In some jurisdictions it is already illegal to sell spray paint to minors.)

       urlLink Another Very Merry Kerryism :    "Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry says if he's elected president, 1 million more students will graduate from college during his first five years in office and he will bring a special focus to boosting opportunities for low-income and minority students.  "Kerry's campaign says  nearly half the hike in graduation rates will come from population increases ..."   Let's see -- elementary and secondary public education is a disaster in this country,  urlLink especially in my own city  -- yet our higher education system is the envy of the world.  So of course which one does Kerry want to futz around with?  Maybe  urlLink Hillary's approach  is better.

      Consider  urlLink this reader post  at Overlawayered.com:    In the case of smoking, I am one of those who thinks someone smoking around me (in public, of course - they can do as they like as long as the smoke stays on their own property) is a form of assault.  Analogy - chlorine gas. A little more obvious, a little quicker, and therefore easier to condemn, but whatever crime someone who releases chlorine gas in a public place (or directly onto my property) is committing, a person who blows their smoke on me in a similar manner is committing.  The post then proceeds to destroy the asinine analogy.  My concern, however, is how flippantly and carelessly the reader tosses around the word "public" -- exactly which "public" area would that be?  I doubt there is anywhere left in America where every   truly   "public place" (i.e., government office building, courthouse, airport, military base, etc.) has not become either totally smoke-free or at least has designated smoking areas. The issue, of course, is the casual willingness to impose constraints on   private   places, especially bars, hotels and restaurants.  (And please don't bother with the whole "don't you know that  urlLink 'pub' is short for 'public house' ?" Grow up.)  You're concerned about your right to breathe smoke-free air? STAY HOME! Or go to my competitor's bar down the street (or, better yet,   my   bar down the street) that has responded to market forces and has gone smoke-free.  The "right to breathe smoke-free air" in a bar or restaurant is as fictional as the right to drink free beer or eat free food or veto the band's music.  As I have  urlLink previously  plagiarized:  urlLink Without property rights, no other rights are possible .

       urlLink Bush :  Reforming Social Security by allowing younger workers to privately invest a portion of their payroll taxes through individual accounts will be an important part of his second-term domestic agenda, President Bush told supporters this week.   urlLink Kerry :  As president, John Kerry will not raise Social Security taxes, raise the retirement age, cut benefits for people that rely on Social Security, or privatize Social Security.   He will consider making sure that high-income beneficiaries don't get more out than they pay in.    Did you notice that last part? Not only is he perfectly willing to let Social security go bankrupt -- he is even willing to guarantee that Social Security taxes never actually function like an   investment  .  In his nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Kerry reiterated that he would not privatize Social Security.  As always, your single best resource for Social Security information is  urlLink Cato .

      Bob Herbert of the New York Times  urlLink has completely lost it :  Cleveland has laid off 15 percent of its cops - 250 officers. Pittsburgh has lost a quarter of its officers, and Saginaw, Mich., a third. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has waved goodbye to 1,200 deputies, closed several jails and released some inmates early. In Houston, police officers are taking up the duties of 190 jail guards who were let go.  This is nuts. We know that low levels of crime and violence are essential if cities are to thrive. Tremendous progress - in some places, like New York   [under Republican Rudy Giuliani]  , almost miraculous progress - has been made in reducing crime since the crack-crazed, gun-blazing days of the late 80's and early 90's. To even begin rewinding the clock to that time of madness would in itself be an act of madness.  Yet that's what we're doing.  Of course,   total   government spending in those cities is   not   going down (does it ever?), so in reality what's "nuts" is not so much that they're cutting essential services, but rather that they're too concerned about spending money on other, non-essential programs.  But wait, there's more:  Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore, who co-chairs the Task Force on Homeland Security for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, told me in an interview that budgetary horror stories are coming in from police officials all over the country. There are many reasons, he said, including the recession and the weak recovery that followed, the antiterror obligations that have fallen to the police since Sept. 11, and "the cascading effect" of   enormous [oh really?] federal tax cuts at a time when the nation is at war [huh?]  . Local taxes have gone up sharply, and services have had to be cut back even as federal taxes have decreased.  "This is all compounded," Mayor O'Malley said, "by the fact that   there is just less money coming in from Washington  " for traditional crime-fighting efforts.  Here's a radical idea -- how about having federal taxes pay for federal operations, such as the military, homeland security, federal courts, etc., and have state &amp; local taxes pay for state and local operations, such as schools, police, fire departments, local courts, etc.?  Is that somehow   more   complicated than having cities worry about federal taxes and Washington worrying about local police forces?  (Compare and contrast:  urlLink my earlier post  on federal highway money.)  It's bad enough that we redistribute income from high income to low income far beyond what any reasonable definition of "safety net" would call for, but we have also created such an elaborate web of redistributive measures -- from city to farm to suburb back to city, from east to south to west to Alaska, from employee to corporation to small business owner to farmer, from young to old, from insured to uninsured, from single to married, etc., etc., etc., that even the central planners and their legions of bureaucrats can't keep track of it anymore.  I'm so glad  urlLink the era of big government is over  -- I shudder to think what it would be had it actually "continued."

      An update to  urlLink my earlier post  on the debate over al a carte cable TV:    urlLink Wired  reports that the cable industry got slammed Thursday at an FCC hearing over the subject.&nbsp; (The FCC won't make the rules in this instance, but is gathering information on behalf of Congress, which is expected to take up the issue this Fall.)   The eye of the storm was  urlLink this cable-sponsored report  by PR firm Booz Allen Hamilton concluding&nbsp; that -- surprise -- al a carte is a bad idea for consumers.&nbsp; It appears that the entire BAH analysis is premised on the assumption that al a carte cable would require new set-top boxes, an assertion that consumer groups, and FCC staffers, say is a flat-out lie:   Consumer groups insist that simple digital routers similar to those already used for home networking would be a cheaper option.&nbsp; "What we have here is a $500 solution to a $50 problem," [one consumer advocate] said.  The BAH report also takes as a given that cable network ad rates would automatically drop precipitously under an al a carte system, what one FCC staffer described as&nbsp;"a somewhat irrational result."   Perhaps the most interesting observation about this debate is that   the little guys like the idea  , but the dominant players oppose it:    Ben Golant, a senior attorney in the Media Bureau, pointed out that some start-up programmers and even some small cable operators seem to support a la carte pricing. "I'm not too convinced that voluntary a la carte or themed tiers would be bad," he said. "How is it that your study does not reflect ... the feelings of very smart and astute business people?"  How indeed...

      Earnings reporting season, my  urlLink professional raison d'etre , is draining me a bit too much to blog at full capacity, but here are some updates to earlier posts:    Regarding the UK government's waste of eight million pounds on a  urlLink "duck and cover" pamphlet  sent to every British household, the good folks at  urlLink Samizdata  report that a  urlLink parody website  concerning the program may be censored by humorless authorities.      Regarding  urlLink animal rights terrorists  scoring a victory by threatening violence and even murder, Josie Appleton at  urlLink Spiked  makes the salient point that the UK government should take some of the blame for not adequately protecting scientists and their facilities from these demented psychos and for not providing some hard data on the benefits of animal research.      Regarding blindly irrational  urlLink opposition to genetically-modified food ,  urlLink Volokh  points to  urlLink yet another study  showing no risk from GM technology. Also a  urlLink Spiked commentary  asks whether rampant "superstition" regarding GM technology is just a symptom of a much larger, and more ominous, trend toward an "anti-Enlightenment" worldview.  A must-read piece!      Regarding the debate over  urlLink the constitutionality of the Marriage Protection Act  (the one that would strip federal courts over DOMA jurisdiction),  urlLink Hit and Run  has a lengthy thread on the debate with some interesting comments. And  urlLink Volokh  reluctantly chimes in too.      Regarding my aside that  urlLink Badnarik is not an option  -- well,  urlLink neither is his running mate .

      The second-hand smoke hysteria hits  urlLink the next plateau :   Robert Zangrando claims he has been   assaulted   by cigarette smoke.   The smoke that wafted into his condominium from the cigarettes held outside by his neighbor, Nicole Kuder, was willfully blown in his direction and invaded his home, he says, which led to his additional allegations of   battery and trespass  .   In a case that is attracting some national attention, Zangrando, 71, is seeking more than $50,000 in damages from Kuder, 28, who is moving. Zangrando, who said he has emphysema, said his health was damaged during the two years she lived there.  ...  Secondhand smoke often leads to conflicts, and more than 420 lawsuits involving secondhand smoke have been filed in the last 25 years, according to research by Edward Sweda Jr., senior attorney for the Tobacco Control Resource Center at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston.  Now clearly, if I'm arguing with you in close proximity and intentionally blow smoke in your face, then yes, that's a battery. And if I intentionally dunk my cigarette in your drink, then yes, that's trespass (well, actually it's  urlLink conversion ).   But this is just plain silly.   Hat tip to  urlLink Overlawyered.com .   P.S. I don't smoke, and I love smoke-free environments. But I love  urlLink property rights  and common sense far more.

      It will be interesting to see how the campaigns deal with  urlLink this grim finding :   The overall income Americans reported to the government shrank for two consecutive years after the Internet stock market bubble burst in 2000, the first time that has effectively happened since the modern tax system was introduced during World War II, newly disclosed information from the Internal Revenue Service shows.  The total adjusted gross income on tax returns fell 5.1 percent, to just over $6 trillion in 2002, the most recent year for which data is available, from $6.35 trillion in 2000. Because of population growth, average incomes declined even more, by 5.7 percent.  Adjusted for inflation, the income of all Americans fell 9.2 percent from 2000 to 2002, according to the new I.R.S. data.  The Democrats will likely have a field day with that 9.2% number.  Of course, a careful review of the data show that the hit is being taken mostly by the wealthy, who have seen their capital gains wiped out in the Clinton-era market bubble.  So the Republicans can retort that the rich aren't really getting richer and cannot endure the higher marginal tax rates that Kerry is promising.  Also expect reasoning like this: "The expanding deficit isn't being caused by the Bush tax cuts, but rather by the lack of capital gains to tax."  Then there's this tidbit:   The stock market decline also affected the incomes of those between $1 and $5,000, which includes large numbers of children in affluent families with investments for college costs. Incomes for that group fell 7.8 percent over the two years, to $33.3 billion, as dividends fell and those who had to sell equities in the depressed market to pay tuition reaped smaller gains in 2002.  Maybe not Kerry, maybe not Edwards, but   somebody   in the Democratic Party will bemoan the decline in income among "the nation's children," conveniently leaving out the fact that it's really just the trust-fund babies.  As is so often the case, this report has enough raw data for just about everyone to find   something   to support their side of the tax debate. Hopefully the distortions will not get too out of hand (I'm not optimistic).   Update:  Bruce Bartlett parses the data far better than I do -- see  urlLink here .

      A quick John Edwards observation, courtesy of the  urlLink Washington Times :   During his career of allegedly championing the helpless, he took no pro bono cases.  Here is the  urlLink ABA Model Rule  on pro bono service.   RULE 6.1 VOLUNTARY PRO BONO PUBLICO SERVICE  Every lawyer has a professional responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to pay. A lawyer should aspire to render at least (50) hours of pro bono publico legal services per year.  As for  urlLink North Carolina , it appears that while law school students are required to satisfy a pro bono activity, admitted attorneys are not (there's not even an official   suggestion   regarding pro bono in the North Carolina ethics code).   Still, it's not like Edwards couldn't afford to take some time off:   In his 20 years as a lawyer, Edwards has a number of trophies he can boast. In at least 63 big cases, he won more than $152 million. His performance earned him an induction into the  urlLink Inner Circle of Advocates , a society of 100 of the nations best lawyers (all of whom have won at least one case with an award worth $1 million) and a mention as one of Lawyer Weekly USA's "Lawyers of the Year" in 1996. His great fortune, earned from the cases he won, and a cornucopia of professional contacts that he amassed during his career permitted him to make his unexpected jump into the political realm.  urlLink Source.  Maybe  urlLink Balko  could add this to his list of questions for Edwards.   Meanwhile, here's  urlLink Halliburton's website  regarding community service, corporate giving, etc.    UPDATE #1:  The good folks at  urlLink Overlawyered.com , whom I respect tremendously, point to a  urlLink New York Times article  that suggests that in fact Edwards "handled no  notable  pro bono cases." On the other hand, we have  urlLink freerepublic.com  pointing to  urlLink this site  which asserts "no pro bono  or civil rights  litigation."   And of course, searching  urlLink www.johnkerry.com  for "pro bono" returns a bit fat zilch.   I find it hard to believe that, had Edwards had done any pro bono work, he wouldn't have let us know by now. Still, if the  urlLink Washington Times  turns out to be wrong, I will certainly announce it here.    UPDATE #2:  Elizabeth Edwards' speech mentioned quite a litany of volunteer activities by her husband as well as his 20-year legal career of "championing" the disadvantaged.   ( Sidebar:  Can we   please   dispense with  urlLink this nonsense  that taking cases on contingency is pro bono work? See Page 8 of PDF link.)   Edwards himself talked a lot about Kerry's volunteering for Vietnam and (very) briefly about his own law career.   Since nothing was said by either Elizabeth or John Edwards about any pro bono work, I consider the matter closed.

      If the  urlLink Drudge story  regarding Kerry re-enacting his own war footage is   (a) substantially true (not just marginally true), and  (b) patently verifiable   then the election is over.    UPDATE:  Some are saying that, even if substantially true, this would not cripple Kerry, citing Clinton's draft-dodging letters and Bush's DUI revelation.&nbsp; I disagree, mainly because Clinton was not running on a "conscription platform" and Bush was not running on a "clean-and-sober platform." Indeed, both were essentially pile-on confirmations/escalations of concerns already in the public domain.   This is different.&nbsp; Kerry's "war hero" persona is at the core of his candidacy and the linchpin of his appeal to the ABB movement.&nbsp; A repudiation, or even a sizeable dilution, of that image would most likely sink him.   I'm not saying the GOP should try to exploit this -- the media will do that -- I'm just saying it will happen (again, if sufficiently substantiated).

      The  urlLink slow creep toward Hillarycare  continues:   The Bush administration announced plans on Tuesday to pay for initial comprehensive physical examinations for new Medicare beneficiaries, starting next year, and it said Medicare would also cover screening tests for cholesterol and diabetes for people already in the program.   As a result of incremental changes in the last few years, Medicare now covers a wide variety of preventive services.  ...  The "welcome to Medicare physical'' for new beneficiaries includes influenza and hepatitis B vaccines, mammograms, Pap smears and pelvic examinations and screening tests for prostate cancer, colon cancer, glaucoma and osteoporosis, among other conditions.  ...  As part of the physical examination, Medicare will also pay for an electrocardiogram; an assessment of a person's risk of depression; hearing and vision tests; and   a review of a person's ability to perform activities like bathing, dressing, eating and getting in and out of bed  .   Doctors will be expected to ask patients about their diet, their physical   and social activities  , their work history and   any use of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs   [but don't reveal too much -- see  urlLink here ]. The government will also pay doctors to provide education and counseling for any medical problems detected in the examination.  ...  In the past, the Medicare law explicitly barred payment for "routine physical checkups."  Maybe next Medicare will subsidize doctors educating seniors on how to program their VCRs, use check-in kiosks at the airport and fill out their AARP enrollment forms.   So these expansions are supposed to save money by focusing on prevention? I eagerly await the audits in years hence to prove (or maybe, just maybe,  disprove ?) that assertion.&nbsp; When did the government ever save two dollars tomorrow by spending one   extra   dollar today (especially in the realms of healthcare or senior citizen entitlements)?

      Kind of depressing to see something as dumb as this on such an outstanding blog as  urlLink Vodkapundit :   Same sex marriage? I'm for for for it. Oh, I could reach some kind of "civil union" compromise, and I'd like to see the courts stay out of it. But too many   gay marriage supporters are too self-centered   not to take it to court, and too many judges (either for or against) are too self-aggrandizing not to meddle. What it boils down to is,   someday gays will win their marriage rights. Just not by any method they should take any pride in  .  Oh those uppity gays and that pesky Constitution and those out-of-control "meddling" judges with their radical notions of judicial review and co-equal branches...they're just not going to allow us even just a little bit of discrimination over such a puny issue as marriage?&nbsp;Not one little bit?&nbsp; Can't they just chill out and wait a few more decades?&nbsp; Well, they should be&nbsp;  ashamed   of themselves!

      A reader asked a good question regarding  urlLink my previous DUI post :   "Why do we even need DUI laws?"  Well, technically we don't (which is   not   the same as saying that drunk driving would be legal). It's certainly feasible to incorporate drunk driving into other offenses, such as reckless driving, vehicular assault, reckless endangerment, etc. (Compare and contrast this " urlLink Driving While DVD-ing " story from Alaska, courtesy of  urlLink Volokh .)  Of course, the same could be said for rape -- isn't it just another form of assualt?  Why do we single out sexual assault for special treatment?  Obviously, the answer is public policy -- we have, as a citizenry (or however many collections of federalized citizenries), decided, through our democratic and legislative processes, to have penal codes that have a certain degree of refinement, specificity and depth.  We distinguish between sexual assault and ordinary assault, between murder and manslaughter, and between prophylactic "reckless driving" and DUI.  Having said that, my previous thesis was this: On the civil side (i.e., private lawsuits), the majority rule in this country is that the simple act of consuming   any alcohol whatsoever   and then driving is   per se negligence  .  What you did was unreasonable, and now you must face the consequences (i.e., damages to the injured defendant).  No different from any other tortious act.  (Radley seems to disagree on this point and believes that there should be some "reasonable" level of intoxication for driving.  Well, that's a minority view and he's certainly entitled to it.)  But anyway, to the extent that we even have BAC limits for criminal DUI convictions, the drunk driver is ahead of the game relative to civil liability.  The same holds true regarding issues such as loss of driving privileges, economic costs, etc.  The moment you get behind the wheel intoxicated, you have broken the law.  To complain about the penalties   after the fact   (the whole theme of the  urlLink WaPo article ) is, in my opinion, disingenuous and unpersuasive.  I am NOT, however, denying that there are abuses, such as some of those raised in  urlLink Balko's Cato  piece, (especially rules that blur the distinction between arrest and conviction), or that there can be unwise pre-emptive policies, such as requiring " urlLink blowmobiles ."    My   point is only this: when you drive, sober or otherwise, you are hurling a   multi-ton   slab of metal down   public   roads at potentially   fatal   speeds. You can't simply dumb down to hyper-libertarianism in such a setting.  Now about those  urlLink Rockefeller Laws ...

      For reasons still not clear to me (I intend to appoint a  urlLink Blue-Ribbon Commission  to investigate), the 1994 twenty-something-angst film " urlLink Reality Bites " (which I had never seen) made its way to the top of my Netflix queue.   One of the (far too numerous) subplots of the film is Winona Ryder's ongoing attempt to produce a serious, deep-thought, cutting-edge documentary videography of her and her friends.   Imagine the horror when she learns that the evil media giant butchers her work into an stream-of-consciousness EP music video of embarassing cuts that run completely contrary to Ryder's intent.   Oh the... the... "  IRONY  " of it all! (If you saw the movie you get the joke.)   Now compare and contrast this excerpt from today's  urlLink Wall Street Journal :   Mr. Moore ignores or misrepresents the truth, prefers innuendo to fact, edits with poetic license rather than accuracy, and strips existing news footage of its context to make events and real people say what he wants, even if they don't. As [the New Yorker's Pauline] Kael observed back then, Mr. Moore's method is no more high-minded than "the work of a slick ad exec."  ...  At one point in "Fahrenheit 9/11," someone off-camera prods a U.S. soldier into singing a favorite hip-hop song with profane lyrics. Mr. Moore then runs the soldier's voice over combat footage, to make it seem as if the soldier were insensitively singing along with the destruction. ... In another scene, U.S. soldiers make savage jokes about the awkward effects of rigor mortis on one part of the corpse of an Iraqi soldier. I do not doubt the authenticity of those pictures. But I also have no particular reason to trust it.  Apparently, for Moore, reality does indeed "bite."

       urlLink Some ideas  are so stupid as to be downright scary:   Facing what it says could be budget gaps of more than $1 billion in the coming years, the  urlLink Metropolitan Transportation Authority , the keeper of the [New York metropolitan] region's mass transit system, is exploring selling naming rights to its subway stations, bus lines, bridges and tunnels.   Transportation authority officials quietly issued a formal request for proposals this month from marketing firms that they would charge with landing sponsorship deals that could include anything from renaming historic stations to attaching corporate monikers to building projects like the long-awaited Second Avenue subway. Indeed, the authority's officials said they could easily imagine the Delta Times Square Shuttle or, say, I.B.M.'s adopting the Tarrytown station on Metro-North's Hudson rail line.   That said, some industry experts, noting that subway stations do not quite resonate in the public imagination the way baseball stadiums do, said the authority might have a hard sell on its hands.  I predict this idea will die very quickly and very quietly.

       A man who married his partner of 23 years after gay marriage was legalized in Massachusetts now is having trouble getting a new passport.   Donald Henneberger, formerly Donald Smith, recently received a letter from the National Passport Center in Portsmouth, N.H., denying his request for a name change on his passport. The center said it would not recognize a marriage license for a same-sex couple as proof of a name change.   The center addressed the letter to "Mr. Henneberger."  ...  The letter from the National Passport Center cites the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which states a marriage can only be between a man and a woman, and a spouse can only refer to a person of the opposite sex.   Donald Henneberger said he had no trouble with the Social Security Administration, another federal agency, when he requested a card in his new name.  urlLink Source .  "But can't Henneberger legally change his name? Sure -- but why should he have to (the articles says it costs $180, plus time, hassle, etc.)? Heterosexual couples don't have to do that.   Hmm...I smell due process and equal protection issues... urlLink judicial review  here we come.

      From the  urlLink New York Post :   According to a report by the Public Policy Institute, a research arm of the state Business Council, New Yorkers paid an average of $4,565 in state and local taxes per resident in 2002 — 47.5 percent above the national average of $3,149 per person in the other 49 states. In other words for the "privilege" of living in New York, it'll cost you an extra $1,496.   What's so special about New York that every one of its almost 19 million residents has to come up with an extra 1,500 bucks? Better schools? Laughable. Fiscal solvency? The highest debt load in the nation. Better garbage collection, speedier road repairs, cleaner air and water, etc., etc., than other states? No, no, no and no. And that's just New York   State  ...let's leave  urlLink New York   City   taxes  for another day.

      Oh,  urlLink those naughty Norwegians :   Angry hotel workers in Norway want to ban pay-TV pornography to stop naked porn-watching guests calling room service to lure female staff to their rooms.   A typical trick by guests, mostly businessmen, is to call the front desk for extras, such as fresh towels, to get female company, said the Norwegian Hotel and Restaurant Workers' Union, reporting a rising number of complaints.   "Most room service personnel work alone. It can be very unpleasant to get called to a room to be met by a naked man," union leader Eli Ljunggren told Reuters. She said the complaints ranged from sleazy remarks to physical assaults.   "Pornography does not belong in hotel rooms. Pay-TV should be limited to   entertainment  ," she said. Most Norwegian hotels, like many hotels around the world, have easy access to pornography channels in hotel rooms for a fee.  Humorous of course, but still -- it wouldn't take a lot of mental gymnastics to imagine some U.S. advocacy group (or labor union) demanding a ban on all hotel porn, or that hotels designate a certain number of rooms to be porn-inaccessible (even with parental locks), or that housekeeping and room service staff get security escorts (union, of course) to the rooms, etc.   And have we seen any class actions yet by housekeeping staff over second-hand smoke in hotel rooms? Probably only a matter of time.

      No deep thoughts, but I really recommend this  urlLink Weekly Standard article  on the wealth of the Gang of Four, and especially of John Kerry (he's the "tax the rich" Democrat, if you remember).   It's not often a man with a net worth in the low eight figures is made to feel destitute. But compared with the other three men atop the national tickets, Bush seems almost indigent. This year, both ends of both tickets are rolling in lucre. Taken together, their net worth comes out at more than $1.3 billion, equivalent to the gross national product of many small nations. If Bush, Dick Cheney, and the Democrats' Johns--Kerry and Edwards--got together, they could fund their own country. Meanwhile, Bush, with a mere $18 million or so, is very much the low end of this quartet, worth three times less than the two men running for the privilege and post of being vice president, who score in the neighborhood of $50 million apiece. But they all seem like pikers next to John Kerry, who, thanks to his wife, has access to something over $1 billion, making him by far the richest man ever to run on a national ticket, as well as the most self-indulgent in his lifestyle, and the most quasi-royal in his sense of himself.  I also found this review of Kerry's charitable giving intriguing:   Throughout his career as an officeholder, John Kennedy gave his salary away to various charities, and lived on his trust fund. In this respect as in so many others, John Forbes Kerry is no JFK. ...According to the Boston Globe, between 1990 and 1995 (when he married John Heinz's widow), Kerry earned a total of $724,042 and gave $4,869 to charity, or a grand total of 0.7 percent. (In the same years, William Weld, Kerry's blue-blood opponent in the Senate race of 1996, earned $1,082,875 and gave away $164,928, or 15.2 percent.) In this six-year span between his two marriages, the most Kerry ever gave to charity was $2,039 in 1994. Two years, he gave nothing at all. No wonder he and  urlLink Edwards  hit it off so well.

      Regarding today's farcical tribute to  urlLink Saint Edward of Chappaquiddick :   I'll leave the whole " urlLink eight grandparents " lampooning to others.   This is the part that really caught my eye:    The senator was born rich, but his political heart has always been with the less fortunate. Even now he is fighting for an increase in the absurdly low - $5.15 an hour - minimum wage.  Yes, he was born rich...and he'll die even more rich. Real Catholic charity there (compare and contrast:  urlLink my previous post ). (And let's not forget where the Kennedy fortune came from:  urlLink bootleg booze and stock swindles .)   Anyway, what's so noble and saintly about telling other people that   they   have to help the poor (especially in a way --  urlLink the minimum wage , that merely makes the poor as a group worse off)?   Yes, Kennedy spent a lifetime in public service -- by which I mean playing Robin Hood with other people's money, businesses, schools, etc. Yes, his political life should be studied, long and hard.   Because there are indeed lessons to be learned.   Meanwhile, I'm   still   mourning the loss of  urlLink a true Democratic titan .

      I warned about  urlLink this  before:   The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the state [of Ohio] for sticking with the same elderly [punch-card ballot] technology that bewildered   [SIC!!!]   many Americans during the 2000 presidential election. The trial, set to begin Monday, is the first in the nation, voting experts say.   The ACLU wants all punch-card ballots in the state removed before November, saying the system causes errors that lead to undercounting of minority group votes. But even a victory would be unlikely to bring change before this year's presidential election because there would be too little time to make a conversion.   "They're claiming that the state has been denying the right to vote to African-Americans," said Rich Coglianese, an attorney defending the state. "It's our position that the state has not denied the right to vote to anybody, and the evidence will never be able to show that."   urlLink And so it begins ...   One passing thought -- I thought it was the  urlLink butterfly ballot  that "bewildered" so many people. Sorry, but if you find all punch-card ballots "bewildering" then you have absolutely no business voting.

      The  urlLink Wall Street Journal  today echoes  urlLink my "Kerry's first principles" post  from a few days ago:    Democrats remain the party of government, with more spending for every perceived problem but a claim to "fiscal conservatism" because they would raise taxes to reduce the deficit. They are still the party of income redistribution, through taxing high-income wage earners, and increasingly through the promotion of lawsuits. Al Gore's 2000 theme of the "people versus the powerful" has returned in the guise of John Edwards's "two Americas." The party has become somewhat more protectionist on trade since the 1990s, and it remains firmly liberal on the culture.   If any new Big Idea lurks, it is probably national health care, though even this dares not speak its name. Mr. Kerry's proposal amounts to a huge new taxpayer obligation ($653 billion over 10 years, by the Kerry camp's own reckoning), but it is disguised in large part as a federal subsidy for business in return for covering all employees.  ...  To his credit, Mr. Kerry has said he won't cut and run from Iraq, but he says precious little else other than that he'd somehow persuade the U.N. and France to help. Good luck with that. Yes yes yes, GWB has been a vomitous disappointment on entitlements, deficit control and protectionism. And yes yes yes it is perfectly reasonable to oppose the Iraq War and to hold Bush accountable for it. But it is silly, loopy and downright dangerous to conclude that "Kerry would be no worse."   At this point I doubt I will vote for Bush, especially after FMA and also considering that I'm in New York State (where any non-Kerry vote is merely symbolic anyway). And since  urlLink Badnarik is not an option , it will probably mean just showing up at the polls, signing in and going home.

      An update to  urlLink my earlier post  on sunblock hysteria, courtesy of  urlLink Spiked :    Michael Holick, professor of medicine and physiology at Boston University School of Medicine, is still sore about being asked to resign his professorship of dermatology in May 2004. His crime? He wrote a book called The UV Advantage, which suggests that exposing yourself to sunlight without sunblock   for five or 10 minutes a day   can be a good thing, providing us with Vitamin D and helping to strengthen our bones and protect against illnesses like type II diabetes and multiple sclerosis. 'It was the "without sunblock" bit that they didn't like', he says. 'Apparently it's forbidden to tell people to go out without sunblock.'  ...  Holick offended against a contemporary religion, one which says that sunlight causes skin cancer, that tanning is the irresponsible act of reckless individuals...  ...  He was called in by Barbara Gilchrist, chair of the Department of Dermatology at Boston University School of Medicine, and told that 'your thinking is not in line with ours'. Holick groans that   the sunscreen industry is 'a major funder of the dermatology community in the US, especially the American Academy of Dermatology  ….' 'So I was asked to resign from the department', he says, though he remains at Boston as a professor of medicine and physiology.  One parting thought of things perhaps to come:   One London expert has suggested that parents who allow their children to get sunburned should be prosecuted for neglect.  We're already seeing such proposals for  urlLink parents who smoke  and  urlLink parents of obese children ...so why not add a day at the beach to the list of parental violations?&nbsp; Right up there with too much television or video games, too many movies, too much time at the mall, too much allowance, too little allowance, hazardous chores (think lawn mowers), and&nbsp;too few&nbsp;vacations in&nbsp;Orlando.

      An update to  urlLink my earlier post  on animal rights terrorists, courtesy of the U.K.'s  urlLink Guardian :   A top adviser to Britain's two most powerful animal rights protest groups caused outrage last night by claiming that the assassination of scientists working in biomedical research would save millions of animals' lives.   To the fury of groups working with animals, Jerry Vlasak, a trauma surgeon and prominent figure in the anti-vivisection movement, told The Observer: 'I think violence is part of the struggle against oppression. If something bad happens to these people [animal researchers], it will discourage others. It is inevitable that violence will be used in the struggle and that it will be effective.'   Vlasak,   who likens animal experimentation to the Nazis' treatment of the Jews  , said he stood by his claim that: 'I don't think you'd have to kill too many [researchers]. I think for five lives, 10 lives, 15 human lives, we could save a million, 2 million, 10 million non-human lives.  As I said in my previous post on the subject: The philosophical underpinnings of animal rights terrorists are just as toxic and decrepit as al Qaeda's. &nbsp;Just as Islamic terrorists are motivated not by love of Islam, but rather by hatred of the West,   animal rights terrorists are not motivated by love of animals, but rather by hatred of humans  .

      National Geographic has produced a documentary about homosexuality in animals. The list includes, well, just about every kind of critter:    But, actually, some same-sex birds do do it. So do beetles, sheep, fruit bats, dolphins, and orangutans. Zoologists are discovering that homosexual and bisexual activity is not unknown within the animal kingdom.  And what about homosexuality in humans?    So how far can we go in using animals to help us understand human homosexuality? Robin Dunbar is a professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Liverpool, England. "The bottom line is that anything that happens in other primates, and particularly other apes, is likely to have strong evolutionary continuity with what happens in humans," he said.

      Pathetic boo-hoo  urlLink article in the Washington Post  about how shocked, shocked, people are at the costs of DUI convictions:  As Virginia and other states across the country tighten laws against DUI offenses, the legal ramifications of an arrest are becoming more serious and more predictable. But the personal fallout is harder to measure.   ... Many who received a DUI conviction said its huge financial costs and burdensome restrictions upended their lives.  ... Nearly a year after her arrest, [one interviewed DUI convict] has admitted she made a mistake, yet   she still can't believe her single drink was excessive  . ... "They look at me like I'm an alcoholic," she said.   "Everyone looks at me like I'm a criminal." (SIC!!!)    Some first-time offenders said they drank too much because of an emotional crisis, then were caught driving while in that condition.    (So what?!?)   ... The typical cost of drinking and driving in Virginia ranges from $5,000 to $20,000, according to a 2003 study by the Thomas Jefferson Community Criminal Justice Board in Charlottesville, a group of law enforcement officials.  In addition to attorney and court fees, drunk drivers usually have to pay for car towing, restricted licenses and reinstatement of their regular licenses. ... Pat Bowman, a counselor at the Fairfax Alcohol Safety Action Program, often asks those in the program, most of them professionals, to list the time and the money they have spent since their arrest. It averages more than $10,000.  "It's amazing," she said. "They could have taken a cab for $50."  I might be a libertarian, but I'm not  that much  of a libertarian. If you drink, and you drive, and you get caught -- well, too bad! Stop whining.   More at the Permalink!   Oh, but Kip, you're the one always blogging about cost-benefit analysis? (An example  urlLink here .) Can't we be   too   stringent in imposing legal limits? What about all the cab fare, missed functions, lost productivity, broken marriages, etc., from basically upright citizens who had "just that one cognac and Coke" and whose BAC was "just a smidgen" above the legal limit?  Too bad. Don't drink and drive -- period. Zero tolerance, end of discussion.  Imagine the response if someone tried the same argument with drinking while pregnant.  No reasonable person would tolerate for a moment any kind of "cost-benefit analysis" to the expecting mother who is contemplating "just that one cognac and Coke."  Too bad. Don't drink while pregnant -- period. Zero tolerance, end of discussion.  The exact same analysis for the exact same reasons -- and with the exact same conclusion.  To put the analysis in strictly economic terms (which, unfortunately, both economists and lawyers have to do all the time):   Sometimes    urlLink   corner solutions      are optimal.    Zero tolerance for drunk driving is such a case.  Compare and contrast the criminal approach to drunk driving to the civil approach (i.e., suing someone for negligence).  In any tort,   liability is an absolute   -- yes or no, did you do it?  (There are a handful of slightly more complicated examples -- joint liability, vicarious liability, etc., but they don't affect my thesis here).  The majority opinion in tort law is that driving after any alcohol consumption whatsoever is  urlLink per se negligence  (i.e., patently and unconditionally unreasonable behavior).  Why should criminal law be any different?  P.S.  Don't know who Tobias Beecher is?  Click  urlLink here .    UPDATE #1:   urlLink Balko  disagrees with me.  He's wrong.

      I've had more than one friend over the years who have proven themselves, by their accidental paternity, to be what I call "typical American Catholics" (i.e., Catholic enough not to use a condom, and Catholic enough not to have an abortion, but not Catholic enough to abstain from pre-marital sex in the first place).   Just another example of a phenomenon about which I have blogged before ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ).   Another example is one of the most important -- and most ignored -- rules of American politics:   there is no such thing as the "Catholic vote."     Don't believe me? Then read  urlLink this :   The more than 65 million Catholics in the United States form by far the biggest single religious voting group. About 22 million voted in the 2000 presidential election.   The overwhelming majority -- 13 million -- voted for the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, a fierce abortion advocate.   And that's only the tip of it. The states with the highest proportion of Catholic voters are: Rhode Island, 61 percent Catholic in the latest census; Massachusetts, 49.8 percent; New Jersey, 42.6; New York, 40.4; Connecticut, 38.4; Wisconsin, 30.4, and Pennsylvania, 30 percent.   Between [sic] them, these seven states own 106 electoral votes -- and all voted decisively for the abortion agendas of Bill Clinton in 1992 and '96 and Al Gore in 2000.   (For a state that is supposedly 50 percent Catholic, Massachusetts has an extraordinary record of electing radical abortion candidates, beginning with the likes of the Kennedys and extending through to Kerry, Rep. Barney Frank and the late House Speaker, Tip O'Neill. It's hardly a surprise that the biggest scandal in the American church in the past century should erupt in Massachusetts: Nobody has been minding the store there for 50 years.)  That last paragraph might be a cheap shot, but the basic premise holds: American "Catholics" are perpetually engaging in pernicious self-contradictions. Maybe other religious sects allow "a la carte faith" -- Roman Catholicism does not. But that doesn't stop American Catholics from trying to practice their faith selectively, and in the process conveniently checking their faith at the polling booth door.   Post Script:  Question: What would happen if the Vatican threatened to defrock any American priest who gave communion to an openly pro-choice Catholic politician?

      A post over at the  urlLink Social Affairs Unit  connects  urlLink some interesting dots :   Homosexuals are being vilified in much of Africa -- by Robert Mugabe, the Anglican Church, and Islamic leaders. Yet Christie Davies argues,   Africa owes a huge debt to the Western gay community  .

      If you want more humungous reading besides the 9/11 Report, try this intriguing thread from  urlLink Washington Animal  on  urlLink the proposal to strip federal courts of jurisdiction  over  urlLink DOMA .   As with any thread on a popular blog, there's some foolishness and some fisking and   a lot   of flat out mistakes regarding constitutional law, but some very good issues and observations are also there.   My contributions:   Posted by: KipEsquire  The only vaguely feasible way I can see to skirt  urlLink Article III Section 2  is to posit that the  urlLink Fifth Amendment  (remember: Amendments trump Articles) guarantees due process of law, and that a total denial of judicial review on a subject, especially a subject that exclusively implicates an insular minority (see Stone's famous  urlLink "Footnote 4")  cannot possibly satisfy due process (I believe the test is that the law must not "offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice"). There aren't many legal doctrines as "traditional" as judicial review of constitutionality of federal statutes.    [More at the Permalink...]    Posted by: David Carroll  But doesn't the plain text of the law merely empower Congress to strip the Supreme Court of  urlLink appellate  power? Unless I misunderstand the legalese here, it looks like Congress merely has the right to prevent the Supreme Court from reviewing & overturning the decisions of lower courts. Thus each and every district court would become its own little supreme court within its jurisdiction, right?  Or do I misunderstand the language here?   Posted by: KipEsquire  David C.: You're (basically) not misreading the bill, but keep in mind that SCOTUS would have ONLY appellate jurisdiction in this realm anyway, not original jurisdiction (check back to Article III, Section 2, Clause 2). Original jurisdiction over federal questions rests only with the "lower courts" (i.e., federal district courts) and is subject to the Exceptions language at the end of Clause 2, which of course is the hot topic.   I can't see any reasonable way whatsoever to question the constitutionality of the bill if you read only Article III. You have to look for an escape hatch, which, like I mentioned above, probably lies, if anywhere, with the Fifth Amendment.   Posted by: JimPortlandOR  "If the Supreme Court of New Jersey or California were to say that DOMA is unconstitutional and New Jersey or California is therefore ordered to recognize out-of-state gay marriages, and this law had passed, there would be no appeal from that ruling."  In conflicts between states, the SCOTUS has original jurisdiction.   KipEsquire responds:  I think what Jim is hypothesizing is, e.g., a Massachusetts gay couple, legally married in Massachusetts, suing, in federal court, for marital rights in a state where gay marriage has been banned.&nbsp; Such a lawsuit is probably banned by the Eleventh Amendment anyway.&nbsp; Neither DOMA itself nor the jurisdiction bill play any role in the discussion.   The simple fact that some states rule one way on gay marriage and other states rule another way is not a conflict between states as envisaged by Article III.  urlLink New York and New Jersey suing each other over who owns Ellis Island  would be such a case.   Posted by: David Carroll  KipEsquire - I think I understand your arguments. You're saying that, since Congress has the power to ordain & establish lower courts, it has complete power to determine the scope of the judicial power of those courts. Coupled with the ability to determine appellate jurisdiction for the Supreme Court, Congress can strip the federal judiciary (but not state courts) of the ability to hear almost any type of constitutional (or other) case.   However, it seems to this non-lawyer that Article III could also be read as defining the scope of federal judicial power overall, then merely giving Congress the ability to decide in which court to vest that power, rather than the ability to restrict that power overall.   KipEsquire responds:  Yes, pretty much. Think of it this way:   Article III defines the  exact   original  jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but only the  maximum   appellate  jurisdiction.&nbsp; It leaves to Congress to decide how much, or how little, of that appellate jurisdiction to actually grant. And Congress has plenary control over the original jurisdiction of the lower federal courts.   Posted by: KipEsquire  "Is it possible for the Constitution to be unconstitutional? That is, in effect, what you are all saying. It might be possible for its provisions to be unwise, of course, but the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional."   Awesome question. Some have suggested, for example that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth, should be declared null and void since they were not properly ratified in the South after the Civil War (the newly readmitted Southern states were essentially forced at gunpoint to ratify them).   A lot of hubbub was also raised regarding the  urlLink Twenty-Seventh Amendment , which was left open for ratification (arguably improperly) for 201 years:   Getting back on topic, people seem to be picking and choosing their Article III language. It really doesn't work that way...you simply must read and accept the entire article as a whole.    UPDATE:  urlLink Volokh  (tentatively) agrees with me.  If you can digest  urlLink his colleague's link , see "Item VII, #3 -- "Congress' Power to Regulate Jurisdiction Does Not Include the Power To Regulate Rights"

      Commission Chairman Tom Kean, quoted in the  urlLink New York Times :  "We're in danger of just letting things slide," the panel's chairman, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, said in a meeting this morning with reporters. "  Time is not on our side.  " Mr. Kean and the commission vice chairman, former Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, said   Congress should begin work as soon as possible, perhaps even in a special session.   They said whoever is president in January should put the panel's recommendations at the top of the agenda. Um, why?  It's been almost three years since 9/11,  urlLink al Qaeda is on the decline , there is no specific imminent threat,  urlLink OBL is likely to be captured or killed soon , the terrorists are focusing on the weak-willed nations like  urlLink Spain  and the  urlLink Philippines , etc.  A basic principle of jurisprudence is that haste makes for bad law and bad policy (e.g.,  urlLink the PATRIOT Act ). Urgency for its own sake is neither necessary nor wise.  And by the way, there's a presidential election forthcoming.  Do you think the politicians' discussion of the Commission report will remain "nonpartisan" or even "bipartisan" between now and November 2nd?  When pigs fly.  Furthermore, let's remember that  urlLink the Commission has already announced its intention  to get in our faces   and stay there  .  Let's be honest, crying "no time to waste" plays into their plan to perpetuate their mandate even after the report has been released.  Analysis of the report and action based upon its recommendations should take place at a reasoned, moderate pace.  As the saying goes: If we do it wrong, then the terrorists win.   UPDATE:   urlLink Experts  agree with me, as does  urlLink Captain Ed .   (8/4/04)

      Still want to believe that there is no ethical or moral difference between the free, democratic, pluralistic, market-based state of Israel and the terrorist-sponsoring Palestinian leadership? Read this  urlLink New York Times  piece:   In recent days, the members of the [Palestinian] Al-Za'nin clan have seen members of the Al Aksa Martyrs Brigade, an armed [terrorist] branch of Yasir Arafat's Fatah organization, using their olive and orange groves and the roads nearby for launching sites. This morning, when the four brigade militants returned to try to set down a launcher along the road running in front of the Al-Za'nin house, the family members spoke up in anger.  ...  According to Amna Al-Za'nin, the 35-year-old aunt of the boy who was killed, members of the family including three of her nephews argued with four militants, but the militants ignored their appeals. As the argument grew more heated, she said, three of the militants started firing in the air. One though fired off several shots directly at the family.   Miss Al-Za'nin herself was struck   in the back  , an 18-year-old nephew was struck in the ear, and a 20-year-old nephew was struck in the hand. But one nephew, Hassan Al- Za'nin, 15 years old, was hit   in the back   and taken to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where he died. Doctors at the hospital said the bullet penetrated the boy's heart.   "Even if we ask them not to fire from our land, that doesn't give them permission to shoot at us," Miss Al Za'nin said in a telephone interview from her bed at Alawdah Hospital in Jabalia in the northern Gaza strip.   "It's very painful that a Palestinian bullet was directed toward a Palestinian chest."    ...  "This is part of a growing trend where residents are exasperated with gunmen," one [Israeli] official said. "We saw it in Rafah where people were angry at the militants building tunnels under their houses. And in Nablus, where   the residents weren't sorry that we were arresting the bad guys in their neighborhood  ."    Would this wholesale slaughter of an innocent, Palestinian family have occurred if  urlLink The Wall  -- a perfectly legal, reasonable and moral tool of Israeli self-defense, had been fully completed?&nbsp; Maybe, maybe not.&nbsp; But without the wall, and with Arafat in charge of his terrorist "organization," it is an absolute certainty that there will be more innocent Palestinians murdered by their own "leaders" using terrorism, allegedly on their behalf.   I have additional posts on The Wall  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

      Two items of note from Congress.   First, we have  urlLink bad politics versus bad accounting :    The House voted Tuesday to override  urlLink a rule  that would require companies to count stock options against their profits...   The House vote was 312-111, with 198 Republicans and 114 Democrats voting for the bill that would block a proposal by the rule-setting board for accounting. The board is seeking to force publicly traded companies to record as an expense all forms of share-based payments to employees, including stock options.   ...Sen. Richard Shelby...derided the House action as "political interference" in the work of independent accounting experts. "I will continue to fight any effort to pass similar legislation in the Senate," he said.   The House-passed measure...would limit required expensing of options to those owned by a corporation's top five executives. It also would allow newly public companies to delay expensing for top executives in the first three years.    I hope at some point to blog about why   option expensing is a total red herring and possibly the dumbest idea in financial analysis  . (For a primer, see  urlLink here .)   But that's not my point here.&nbsp; My point is that   Congress has no business micromanaging the FASB  . I couldn't find any numbers on how many House members have MBAs (they're all lawyers, remember?), but I guarantee you it's not many. And have you ever listened to the question-and-answer periods whenever Alan Greenspan testifies?&nbsp; Most of them couldn't pass a simple  urlLink Econ 101  exam. So these are the same people who are going to countermand the accounting experts? Bad on its face, and bad as applied.   Again,   I disagree 100% with the FASB proposal.   But I disagree 110% with Congress mucking around in an issue that few if any of them really understand. Leave it to the professionals to sort out.   Second, we have some  urlLink monopartisan gridlock :    Republicans are looking toward September to restart talks on extending three popular tax cuts as prospects for a deal this summer ended in deadlock   between the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress (SIC!!!)  .   The White House insisted that the three tax cuts, scheduled to expire at the end of this year, stay on the books for five more years. President Bush had asked Republican leaders to push a bill through Congress this week before a six week summer hiatus and the parties' presidential nominating conventions.   Lawmakers neared agreement late Tuesday to extend the three popular tax cuts for two more years. The shorter timeframe took into account worries among moderate senators, including a few Republicans, about record budget deficits.   The president rejected the two-year offer as insufficient, and tax writers pledged to restart talks when Congress reconvenes in September.  ...  The tax bill is one of several items that have seen Republicans at odds with one another over the impact of tax and spending decisions on record budget deficits.    It's one thing for gay marriage to divide the Republican party...but tax cuts?!? (And remember, this is not really about "preserving tax cuts" ...   it's about raising taxes!  )   Sort of puts a damper on the whole " urlLink Vote Gridlock ... Vote Kerry " school of thought.

      I generally try to avoid quoting the ueber-bloggers, but this snippet from  urlLink Tyler Cowen  about  urlLink Microsoft's massive return of capital to shareholders  stopped me dead in my tracks:   For the first time in history, we see a company with enough free cash to perform "fiscal policy."  I'm not entirely sure that's true...think  urlLink Standard Oil  or " urlLink What's good for General Motors... " And I'm sure Tyler meant an   American   company and   American   fiscal policy -- many, many non-U.S. companies have huge control over their local economies.&nbsp; And let's remember that the  urlLink Dutch East India Company  had its own private fleet of 40 warships.   I'm also not sure about Tyler's political thesis (i.e., that Microsoft would likey not have paid the dividends had it not been for the Bush tax cuts and is paying them now so a possible Kerry Administration won't tax them at a higher rate later) -- though this certainly is plausible. The simple truth is that Wall Street has been breathing down Microsoft's neck for years to dump the cash.   Anyway, what I find intriguing, and wonderful, about this news is how it serves as a reminder of Microsoft's successful history, despite relentless attacks,   not by competitors  , but by just about everyone else.   Microsoft has been very much the company  urlLink people love to hate  over the years -- witness today  urlLink the bemoaning of security flaws  in Windows and Internet Explorer (I myself have been just been warned that my company laptop desperately needs an XP update).   This reminds me of the joke about the guy looking under a&nbsp;lamppost for the keys he lost down the street: "Why look here if you lost them over there?" "Because this is where the light is." (Compare and contrast: Willy Sutton). I have no doubt that if  urlLink Mozilla/Firefox  were the dominant web browser, or if  urlLink OS-X  were running 98% of personal computers, then the hackers would be finding security flaws in them, too. I just don't think they're looking.   The fact that one company so changed the world and made so many people so wealthy in the process is a shining example of American capitalism at its best. Microsoft may very well go down as the greatest achievement in 20th Century capitalism.   The possible irony -- that Microsoft may not perform as well in the 21st Century that it helped launch -- is only a collateral issue.

       urlLink WTF?!?    Police questioned passengers aboard an Amtrak train that was detained at Newark Penn Station for more than an hour Thursday morning,   checking the identification of each passenger  .   Over a cell phone from a passenger on board the train, an unidentified railroad or police worker could be overheard telling passengers, "This is an unusual situation."   Dan Stessel, a spokesman for Amtrak, said there was "an active police investigation. Until it's wrapped up, we can't comment on it."  ...  The train was permitted to leave the station at 9:30 a.m. Taylor said   no explanation was given to passengers  , but an announcement was made thanking them for their patience.   Taylor said transit   police officers came down the aisle of each car, asking to see the identification of each passenger on board and checking the information with small hand-held computer devices  .   Police also searched overhead luggage compartments with a metal wand, and   at least one police dog was brought aboard the train  .     Police were not allowing anyone on or off the train, and the nearby platform was cordoned off with yellow police tape, she said.   A woman who was addressing passengers aboard the train said anyone with a medical condition who needed to get off the train should speak to authorities.   Stessel would not say if the train or its passengers were considered to be in any danger.   Some "back of the envelope" thoughts:   There are two distinct concerns: the mass detention, bag searches and use of alert dogs (Fourth Amendment issues) and the mass reviewing of IDs (a Fifth Amendment issue).   [More at the Permalink.]    The only two explanations I can see for the mass detention are  exigent circumstances  (e.g., a bomb) or a  fugitive hunt . But the police behavior is consistent with neither:     If it was a case of exigent circumstances (which would probably be sufficient to justify wanding and dog sniffing the bags), then that still doesn't explain why people were not allowed to leave (recall that the train was parked at a station). Indeed, the first thing you'd want to do is get the innocent away from the danger, right?      If it was a manhunt, then why the inspection of overhead compartments and police dogs? Wouldn't the ID sweep be sufficient? (Indeed, would the ID sweep even be necessary -- wouldn't a simple walk-through be sufficient?)      As for the mass ID review: Even after the controversial   urlLink Hiibel   decision,   there is still a constitutional right not to carry ID at all times   (a right one voluntarily waives in certain reasonable circumstances, such as commercial flying). As far as I know, there is no requirement that a passenger on a train be required to carry ID at all.   And even if there is: Let's say I'm a completely innocent passenger on that train and, when prompted, I either cannot, or refuse to, provide ID? Remember: There is no probable cause, or "Terry-stop" reasonable suspicion, to detain   me   at all, even if there may be a basis for&nbsp;detaining   the train  . Without   specific   evidence against a   specific   passenger, there is no basis for demanding ID of that passenger.&nbsp; That principle survived  Hiibel , which held that police could demand identity information (not necessarily an "official" ID),   when the police have reasonable suspicion that the suspect is wanted  . Not the case here.   Also: Details are sketchy regarding the dog searches, but one of the last unsettled areas of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a dog sniff   of a person's body  , without reasonable suspicion, constitutes an unreasonable search.&nbsp; This exact hypothetical -- passengers on a bus or train, in tight quarters, detained without individualized suspicion, not allowed to leave, being subjected to a dog going up and down the aisle in close proximity -- is exactly what constitutional experts have expressed uncertainty about.&nbsp;   It appears the police activity was local, at least initially, (although the FBI later acknowledged sending two agents after the fact).&nbsp; Whoever conducted the detention has some serious explaining to do.     UPDATE #1:  Here is what  urlLink Amtrak's website  says about ID:  Effective immediately, Amtrak is implementing several new security measures for the benefit of our passengers.&nbsp; Consequently, passengers will be required to produce valid photo identification   when purchasing tickets   or checking baggage. All passengers, 18 years or older, should be sure to carry a driver's license, passport or other photo identification   when making a purchase  .  Might just be a case of bad writing, but it says "when purchasing tickets" not "when traveling." And even if they did mean "when traveling," that still doesn't mean that passengers agree in advance to waive their Fifth Amendment rights, as clarified by  Hiibel , not to produce ID to police without individualized suspicion.     UPDATE #2:  It now appears that this whole questionable episode was the result of  urlLink a crank note :   An Amtrak passenger found a threatening note on board Thursday, and the train was detained for more than an hour as police checked passenger identifications and searched luggage racks.   The Washington-to-New York train was declared safe and allowed to continue its morning route.   Amtrak spokesman Dan Stessel said he did not know the exact contents of the note, which a passenger found attached to a mirror in the cafe car's restroom.   The passenger alerted the train crew, and police boarded at the next scheduled stop, Newark Penn Station, to perform the search, Stessel said.   "The passenger did exactly the right thing," Stessel said.   The note will analyzed at a crime laboratory, he said.  I don't disagree that the passenger did the right thing -- my problem is with   what the police did  .   How exactly does demanding ID   of every passenger  , in a constitutionally suspect manner, help in any way to determine which jackhole put up the threatening note?&nbsp; And what exactly were the "handheld devices" they were using?   Stopping the train, searching it for explosives or whatever, that's fine of course.&nbsp; Maybe even the alert dog could be considered reasonable under the circumstances (I'm skeptical).&nbsp; But I still see   a pretty flagrant constitutional violation in the ID sweep  .   It remains to be seen whether there will be any fallout from the incident.

      State-versus-industry shakedown  urlLink lawsuit du jour :  Attorneys general from eight states and New York City are stepping into the debate over global climate change, vowing to force the nation's largest power companies to cut their carbon dioxide emissions. ... The attorneys general claim greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide   could   have catastrophic effects, including increased asthma and heat-related illness, depletion of drinking water supplies, a decline in fisheries and erosion of infrastructure.  Marc Violette, a spokesman for New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, declined to comment Tuesday on details but said the lawsuit would, "for the first time, put global warming on the litigation map." "This is a precedent-setting,   first-of-its-kind lawsuit  ," he said.  Scott Segal, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Electric Reliability Coordinating Council...criticized the lawsuit for trying to hold individual companies responsible for global climate change.  "If you gave the facts of global climate change to a first-year law student, and they recommended a public nuisance case, they would get an 'F,'" Segal said. "The idea that any one company's emissions are responsible for global climate change is more political science than environmental science."  For the non-lawyers:   public nuisance  = an act that  unreasonably  interferes with the health, safety or property rights of the community. Recovery is available only if a  private  party has suffered some  unique  damage  not suffered by the public at large .  Read that carefully: --How exactly are power plants supplying power behaving "unreasonably"? --How are eight states (let's not forget NYC!) "private parties"? --How is the supposed harm they have suffered "unique"? (After all, it's allegedly "global" warming.) --How can the government (i.e., the public) possibly be suffering damage "not suffered by the public at large"?   Want more?  --"Governmental authorization" is a defense to public nuisance. In other words, if the utilities have governmental permission to do what they do, then they cannot be sued for it (at least not via a public nuisance claim). I might throw in some " urlLink unclean hands " and  urlLink equitable estoppel  arguments in there for flavor (i.e., if the states regulate these utilities, or regulated them in the past, then those same states should now be barred from crying foul (or "foul air").  --Public nuisance is a tort. An element of   any   tort claim is causation, both factual and  urlLink proximate . Last time I checked, global warming was a   theory  , and a hotly debated one at that (no pun intended). It almost certainly cannot be used, by itself, to satisfy the causation element.  --The plaintiffs insist that they are not seeking damages (yet), but rather want to compel utilities to curb their carbon dioxide emissions. Fine, then they also have the added hurdle of satisfying the "irreparable injury rule" (i.e., demonstrating that monetary damages are inadequate and that an injunction is therefore the   only   viable remedy).  The utilities should dig in their heels and fight this nonsense tooth-and-nail. And the AGs should be taken to task as to why they are wasting resources (i.e., taxpayer dollars) on   what they know is flat-out frivolous litigation  .  Stay tuned...   UPDATE #1:  Jonathan Adler at NRO's  urlLink The Corner  has a great quote from the Connecticut AG:  "Think tobacco, without the money."  Couldn't have said it better myself...   UPDATE #2:   urlLink Commons Blog  has more.

      Courtesy of  urlLink Slate :   If you're old enough to vote but young enough to know what "pimp your ride" means, P. Diddy wants to "  overwhelm you   and excite you" into voting this November. Sean Combs, the rapper turned music mogul turned non-profit founder, launched a get-out-the-youth-vote campaign today called Citizen Change, with the stated goal of "educating, motivating and empowering the more than 42 million Americans aged 18-30 that [sic] are eligible to vote on November 2nd." Will P. Diddy triumph where MTV only met with minor success? Getting youth to vote isn't easy, but   where issues fail to excite, money and merchandising might help  .  ...  Although Combs has some former Clinton aides working for him, including Carville, he insists his efforts are bipartisan and that he has already spoken to Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie about getting more Republicans involved.  ...  "We will attack all of your senses," Combs says.   That means huge "Vote or Die" signs on street corners  , a new P. Diddy album about voting out before November and a last-minute celebrity blitz in swing states in the days leading up to the election, including trips on Combs' own campaign jet.  ...  He claims that one of the main reasons for low voter turnout among America's youth is that politicians aren't addressing the issues that affect young people   ( urlLink like this one? )   in a manner accessible to Generation Y.

      In case you missed it (not getting much coverage outside the Wall Street Journal),  urlLink Cato's Social Security reform plan  has been sponsored in Congress:   Key aspects of the legislation include:    Individuals will be able to privately invest their half (6.2 percentage points) of their payroll tax through individual accounts.   Individuals who choose individual accounts will receive a recognition bond based on the benefits they have already accrued under Social Security. Workers choosing individual accounts will forgo accrual of future benefits from traditional Social Security.   The government will provide a safety net by guaranteeing a minimum Social Security benefit equal to 120% of the poverty level.   If an individual accumulates sufficient funds within their account to allow them to purchase an annuity equal to 120 percent of the poverty level, he or she will be able to opt out of the Social Security system in its entirety.   The remaining 6.2 percentage points of payroll taxes will be used to pay transition costs and to fund disability and survivors benefits.   This discussion will be offered in the context of payable Social Security benefits. That is, workers who choose to remain in the traditional Social Security system will receive a level of benefits commensurate with what Social Security can pay with existing levels of taxation. Those workers will receive the same level of benefits as workers retiring today, after adjusting for inflation, but future promised benefit increases above inflation would not occur.  I'm not one for "writing your Congressman" and I have no idea whether this bill will even get any publicity time before being banished to committee.   And of course the  urlLink Forces of Darkness  will roll out their heavy artillery of  urlLink lies ,  urlLink damn lies  and  urlLink flying pigs  to smear this intelligent and viable proposal.   Still, the Social Security crisis is just that -- A CRISIS! Without huge change, either the good kind (privatization) or the bad kind (huge tax increases, slashed benefits, and a drastically increased retirement age),  urlLink anyone under the age of 40 is affected ;  urlLink anyone under 30 is essentially totally screwed .   So consider shooting off  urlLink a quick email to your Representative .   "This means something...this is important..."

      Disturbing news from  urlLink Wired :    Private contractors revamping IRS computers committed security violations that significantly increased the possibility that private taxpayer information might be disclosed, Treasury Department inspectors say.   An investigation by the department's  urlLink inspector general for tax administration  found that employees working for contractors, or an experienced hacker, could use the contractors' computers to gain access to taxpayer data.   "Our concerns were increased when   we could not find documentation that all contractor employees had received background investigations as required  ," the report said.&nbsp;Other lapses left the IRS computer system vulnerable to viruses and hackers, investigators said.   "In summary, a contractor's employees committed numerous security violations that placed IRS equipment and taxpayer data at risk," the report found. "In some cases,   contractors blatantly circumvented IRS policies and procedures   even when security personnel identified inappropriate practices."  ...  The report comes as Congress considers giving the IRS authority to hire private contractors to collect overdue tax debts, an effort that has some lawmakers and others worried that taxpayer information won't be protected.   "They obviously do not have good systems in place to monitor the contractors today," said Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union. "This will result, for taxpayers, in very aggressive tactics by debt collectors."  ...  Unauthorized chat and instant-messaging activity left the IRS vulnerable to hackers who use those avenues to get information about an organization's internal computer architecture. Contractors' computers were vulnerable to hackers and viruses because they did not have security patches for known vulnerabilities in operating software. Some computers used by contractors were too old to support a secure operating system, and the IRS did not have enough money to replace them.  Ironic, isn't it? The very bureaucracy that takes our money can't seem to find it when it comes to having secure infrastructure.   The IRS could learn something from  urlLink the TSA .

      Worried about the seemingly ever-increasing power and corruption of America's CEO's?&nbsp; George Melloan of the Wall Street Journal (subscription site -- sorry) says guess again:    Indeed, if anyone still doubts that lawyers have moved from their control of the Congress and the statehouses to now include a mastery of corporate America, he should look again. State attorneys general have seized the tobacco industry and made it into a cartel earning rents on behalf of state treasuries. Plaintiff lawyers are milking corporations for billions with product-liability class actions. The Sarbanes-Oxley "corporate responsibility" law has arguably made the general counsels of companies more powerful than CEOs by giving the lawyers legal responsibility for minding the behavior of other executives.    Lawyer versus CEO -- maybe that's what Schumpeter meant by the " urlLink creative destruction of capitalism ."  &nbsp;  One thing is certain: In the tag-team stranglehold of ever-increasing regulation and invented liabilities (mostly, but not exclusively, product liability), the consumer/employee/stockholder (i.e., the little guy) usually ends up as collateral damage in any battle of the elites.  &nbsp;

       urlLink Michael Kinsley  echoes much of what I said in my debut post about the draft:     But replacing the volunteer Army with a draft is an odd way to address [society's] unfairness. The practical effect might be to deny a poor kid the opportunity he or she is currently taking, without creating new opportunities to replace it. Meanwhile, someone else who doesn't need or want this opportunity would be forced into it. Result: Two people doing something they don't want to do.   Another problem. Even if we need more soldiers in Iraq, we don't need as many as a universal draft would produce.&nbsp;... Draft enthusiasts have two solutions to this dilemma. One is a universal mandatory service program for young people in which military service would be just one option. This is truly the tail wagging the dog.   You start with demographic concerns about the military and end up with a vast new government bureaucracy dedicated to forcing people against their will into jobs that mostly have nothing to do with the military.    ...  If you're lucky enough to be born prosperous or well connected, you don't have to serve. The advantage of a draft lottery is that it would redistribute the luck for at least this one occasion.   The disadvantage is that it's still luck, and still unfair. Arbitrary unfairness is better than systemic unfairness.   But now you are disrupting lives and closing off opportunities in pursuit of a goal far short of actual fairness.   ...  Any kind of draft allows the government to pay less for soldiers than they would cost in the free market. It is, in essence, a tax on young people.   Or a pay cut for those who would have volunteered anyway. What kind of fairness is that?   ...A draft ensures that decision makers have a personal stake in a war. On the other hand,   a volunteer Army puts war-and-peace decisions to the test of the market: Can people be induced voluntarily to fight it?   A volunteer Army could become a mercenary force operating at the president's whim. But a draft Army, always at the ready, also encourages imperial whimsy.  When we have a government that is willing to spend money --  urlLink lots and lots and lots of money  -- on just about anything, it is not a huge mental leap to demand that it pay for the military it needs (why do people like Charlie Rangel never talk about "drafting" Boeing or Lockheed Martin -- or dare I mention  urlLink Halliburton ?).   And let's not forget that the draft is the most flagrant, contemptuous, in-your-face violation of  urlLink the Constitution  ever contemplated in modern times, no matter what "original intent" sophistry draft supporters concoct.&nbsp;&nbsp; More on this  urlLink here &nbsp;and  urlLink here .    UPDATE:   urlLink An op-ed in today's New York Times  brilliantly shatters just about every argument put forward by the advocates of involuntary servitude in the military:  &nbsp;   Renewing the draft would be a blow against the men and women in uniform, a dumbing down of the institution they serve. The United States military exists to win battles, not to test social policy. Enlarging the volunteer force would show our soldiers that Americans recognize their hardship and are willing to pay the bill to help them better protect the nation. My view of the citizen-soldier was altered, but not destroyed, in combat. We cannot all pick up the sword, nor should we be forced to - but we owe our support to those who do.  The whole piece is definitely worth reading.

      Fun blurb from the  urlLink New York Post :   What does New York get for pumping $13.5 million into the Kerry campaign? Crummy seats at the back of the convention hall.   The bulk of New York's 284-member Democratic delegation will be penned in a section off the convention floor more than 100 feet from the Fleet Center stage — well behind the choice seats given to delegates from the prized battleground states.   New Yorkers will have a nearly straight-on view of the action, but will have to peek over the heads of folks from Iowa, Oregon, Florida and Delaware to follow the action.   Kerry is battling for every vote in those states, while he has a 28-point lead over President Bush in New York.   Maybe the New York delegation would get a better location if they claimed  urlLink protester status .

       urlLink He's back ...    A veterans group, with the blessing of  urlLink ousted Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore , plans to move his Ten Commandments monument out of storage at the state judicial building this evening to take it on a national "God Bless America" tour.   The granite monument has been out of public view for nearly a year after Moore lost a court fight over its display. It will be hauled to rallies for three months by American Veterans Standing for God and Country, with the first rally to be held July 31st in Dayton, Tennessee.   Moore, who's preparing to file an appeal of  urlLink his ouster  with the U.S. Supreme Court, says   Americans "need to be reminded of our moral foundation" during the national debate over gay marriage.      Which commandment is it again that goes "Thou shalt not enjoy equal protection under the laws if thou art gay..."? Is it anywhere near the whole "love thy neighbor as thyself" part? Or maybe right after that "cast the first stone" section?

      As everyone prepares to blog about  urlLink the Philippines' caving to terrorist threats , let's not forget a related form of terrorist capitulation, as  urlLink the BBC reports :     Animal rights activists have been blamed for intimidating a building firm into pulling out of a new animal research centre contract in Oxford.   Executives at the Montpellier Group said the company's subsidiary, Walter Lilly and Co, would be withdrawing.&nbsp; A police probe earlier this year found letters claiming to be from Montpellier bosses urging shareholders to   sell or face action from activists  .   "  They are threatening, they are destroying  , they are undermining the lives of people going about their business," [Home Secretary David Blunkett] said.  ...  Consultant neurosurgeon at Oxford University Professor Tipu Aziz said: "  Animal rights terrorism is the most immediate threat to the British population   as I perceive it. ... "Until animal rights extremists are treated as terrorists they will hold hostage the future of British public health." Perhaps the most amazing part of this story is that, according to Oxford University,   "the centre would replace existing sites and would not mean an increase in animal tests."  &nbsp;But perhaps the tests would have been more efficient in a modern facility (maybe even sparing a few specimens).&nbsp; Or maybe the people using the facility would have been more comfortable and productive in their new surroundings.  &nbsp;  Details, details...  &nbsp;  Aziz' statement about the magnitude of the animal rights threat may be a bit exaggerated.&nbsp; The philosophical underpinnings of animal rights terrorists, however, are just as toxic and decrepit as al Qaeda's. &nbsp;Just as Islamic terrorists are motivated not by love of Islam, but rather by hatred of the West,   animal rights terrorists are not motivated by love of animals, but rather by hatred of humans  .  &nbsp;  More on animal rights terrorism from NRO  urlLink here .

      Competing op-eds from the New York Times and the Washington Times regarding the ICJ and Israel's self-defense wall ( urlLink about which I have blogged previously ):   First the  urlLink New York Times' PLO whine-fest :    Not surprisingly, states have accused the United States of hijacking the United Nations   (SIC!!!)   by using, or threatening to use, its veto power: support American policy, the United States seems to be saying, or risk turning the United Nations into a debate club.  ...  So what does this have to do with the International Court of Justice or Israel's wall? The court said it had jurisdiction   (SIC!!!)   in part because the United States had frustrated the Security Council's work.  ...  This sends a strong message to the United States: either refrain from obstructing the rule of law with your veto   (SIC!!!)  , or risk alienation from mainstream global opinions and forums. Compare and contrast  urlLink this Washington Times editorial :   The ICJ ruling was in response to a request for an "advisory opinion" by the U.N. General Assembly -- perhaps the most anti-Israel institution on the planet, with the exception of the PLO and its terrorist allies. The court could, and should, have refused to answer the question, both because of its obviously political nature and because the judges lacked a proper factual record. Given the fact that it was asked to rule on a critical aspect of the most difficult, controversial and longstanding international dispute the world faces, the court should have remained silent. To paraphrase French President Jacques Chirac, the court missed a good opportunity to shut up. Speaking strictly as a lawyer, WT has to win the debate:   --  Since when does a court grant itself "jurisdiction" over anything?!?   That's certainly not how American courts work. I cannot think of a greater affront to the concept of "the rule of law" than a court granting itself jurisdiction over a subject matter without some constitutional or legislative mandate. (Maybe I should create the "KipEsquire International Court of Appeals" and grant myself jurisdiction over the ICJ based on solely on my determination of its "affront to the rule of law"...)   --  Exercising a veto is not "obstructing the rule of law" -- it IS the rule of law!  &nbsp; Say what you want about the United Nations and the ICJ&nbsp;--&nbsp;they have  urlLink charters  (i.e., constitutions). The United States, unlike the ICJ, is acting within the plain scope of those charters. The rule of law prevails with us and is corrupted with the ICJ. You don't like it, fine --  urlLink then let's talk about changing it .

      The Washington Post is doing statistical and analytical backflips to convince us that  urlLink John Kerry is not really "liberal" :     National Journal's annual analysis of legislators' votes found in 2003 that Kerry and Edwards, respectively, had the first- and fourth-most-liberal voting records in the Senate.&nbsp;...   Despite the aura of scientific precision, in individual years the results can sometimes be thrown off kilter in ways that leave a distorted impression.   In a recent issue, the magazine noted that Kerry and Edwards, busy campaigning, were absent from the Senate for many of the votes   [   urlLink   like this one     ]   that went into the latest index, so only certain votes entered the formula.&nbsp;  ...  Americans for Democratic Action, or ADA, which wants senators to earn a high rating, has a more straightforward ranking system. Each year the group identifies 20 important votes and assigns five points each time a senator votes the way ADA advocates. Kerry has a lifetime average of 92. As Republicans note, this is two points higher than Democrat Walter F. Mondale's lifetime ADA average. Mondale, the 1984 presidential nominee, is regarded as the most emphatic old-style liberal offered by Democrats in recent decades.   But such numerical comparisons do not reflect the historical context in which the rankings are made. During the 1970s, when Mondale was casting Senate votes, Democrats controlled Congress. Many Democrats routinely backed dramatic expansions of government's role, such as national government-run health insurance or federal jobs programs to guarantee full employment, that go far beyond anything a Democratic nominee has supported in recent years. On the other hand, there are issues today, such as support for gay rights, that even ardent liberals of 30 years ago would not have gone near.    Let's review:  Does Kerry advocate  urlLink higher taxes ?  Does Kerry advocate  urlLink higher government spending ?  Does Kerry advocate  urlLink greater regulation ?  Does Kerry advocate  urlLink less American autonomy ?  Does Kerry advocate  urlLink federalizing traditionally local functions ?   Those are the only statistics I need.     SIDEBAR :  A far more interesting question, or course, is  urlLink whether Bush is really "conservative."      ANOTHER SIDEBAR:    urlLink Wonkette  explains why the pro-Kerry forces might be concerned over this "liberal misconception."

       urlLink Be afraid ...be very afraid...    Aides to Mr. Kerry say the campaign is taking the unusual step of setting up   a nationwide legal network   under its own umbrella, rather than relying, as in the past, on lawyers associated with state Democratic parties.  Lawyers for the campaign are gathering intelligence and preparing litigation over the ballot machines being used and the rules concerning how voters will be registered or their votes disqualified.   In some cases, the lawyers are compiling dossiers on the people involved   and their track records on enforcing voting rights.  ...    The Bush-Cheney campaign says it will have party lawyers in every state  , covering 30,000 precincts. An affiliated group, the Republican National Lawyers Association, held a two-day training session in Milwaukee over the weekend on "how to promote ballot access to all qualified voters," according to the group's Web site.   Lawyers for nonpartisan advocacy groups conducting voter registration drives are also working behind the scenes and in court to ensure that their new registrants make it onto the rolls and that their ballots are counted.  ...  [The Kerry campaign's] plans include setting up   SWAT teams of specially trained lawyers  , spokesmen and political experts to swoop into any state where a recount could be needed.  ...  This time, Kerry aides say, they are recruiting not only specialists in election law who work in small law firms or alone, but also litigators at large firms in every state who have   the resources and office space to support a long-term, large-scale and pro bono recount operation  .   urlLink Lawyers to right of them, Lawyers to left of them, Lawyers in front of them, Volleyed and thundered...

      In civics class, first you learn that there are three branches of government: legislative, executive and judicial.   Then you learn that there's sort of a "fourth branch" of government: the regulatory bureaucracy.  ...or was it the Federal Reserve?  ...or was it the independent government authorities?   Anyway, now we have yet another "fourth branch of government --   the blue-ribbon commission that won't die,   as the  urlLink New York Times  informs us:   Members of the independent Sept. 11 commission say they will mount an aggressive nationwide lobbying campaign   to pressure the White House and Congress (SIC!!!)   to overhaul the nation's intelligence agencies, an effort they say will begin this week with release of a unanimous final report criticizing virtually every element of the way the government collects and shares intelligence.   The lobbying effort would be a break with tradition, since blue-ribbon federal commissions often disband almost as soon as they have completed a final report, the members returning home from Washington and leaving the report to speak for itself.  Members of the Sept. 11 commission say they have decided that given the gravity of terrorist threats that the nation continues to face,   they cannot allow (SIC!!!)   their recommendations to be ignored...  ...  In interviews, commissioners said they were preparing a series of appearances on Capitol Hill through the summer and fall.   That effort will be matched outside Washington with speaking engagements, television and radio appearances and promotional efforts linked to a private (SIC!!!) mass-market authorized version of the report...    ...    [T]he panel's members had already begun considering a series of speaking engagements   outside Washington this summer and fall in which they would explain why the commission's recommendations needed to be adopted quickly.  ...  "We certainly hope that the recommendations become policy and that we act with all deliberate speed in making that happen. That means that the commissioners will continue to speak out. There have already been a lot of invitations for them to speak at prominent forums around the country."      The  urlLink 9-11 Commission website  states:   The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9-11 Commission), an independent, bipartisan commission created by congressional legislation and the signature of President George W. Bush in late 2002, is chartered to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks. The Commission is also mandated to provide recommendations designed to guard against future attacks.    Doesn't seem to say anything about any mandate to engage in lobbying, private speaking engagements, or the authority to enter into   private   publishing contracts.   Of course, individual members of the Commission are (or should be) free, after the commission issues it final report and disbands, to speak their minds as they see fit (although I can see an argument for not allowing them to be compensated for Commission-related speaking engagements, etc.). But the Commission,   as an official government body  , has no business whatsoever morphing itself into a lobbyist group. You did your work ( urlLink no comment on how you did it ), you issued your report. The American people thank you. Now go away.   The enabling legislation of the 9-11 Commission ( urlLink Public Law 107-306,&nbsp;116 STAT. 2383 ) either authorizes this kind of activity or it doesn't (I'm sure someone will beat me to finding out). If it does, then shame on Congress, if not, then shame on the Commission.   Meanwhile, how long do you think it will be before CNN announces "The  urlLink Richard Ben-Veniste  Show"?

      So I'm slogging through my newsfeeds, when I stumble across  urlLink this Queerday.com headline :     Martha's gay stockbroker biggest loser in fraud case    Martha Stewart and   the gay stock broker   with whom she conspired over the sale of ImClone shares each got five months behind bars today.&nbsp;... The star witness in the case was   another gay man, Bacanovic's former assistant, Douglas Faneuil  . Prosecutors maintain Bacanovic ordered Faneuil to pass along a "secret" tip to Stewart on Dec. 27, 2001, that ImClone Systems founder Sam Waksal was dumping shares in his company.       Say what?!?     Now, I am most certainly not going to deliver a big diatribe about being gay, or closeted, on Wall Street.&nbsp; Well, at least not in this post.   My point is this: I cannot find a single mainstream media source that anywhere mentions Bacanovic's or Faneuil's supposed homosexuality.&nbsp; Queerday cites back to this  urlLink 365gay.com story , and  urlLink an earlier queerday story  on Bacanovic links to this&nbsp; urlLink gay.com story , which is nothing more than a self-serving headline.   The closest I got to anything resembling real journalism was this almost-story from the  urlLink New York Blade :   Bacanovic and Faneuil’s sexuality has, at times, been the pink elephant in the media living room: noticed, but pointedly ignored. For example, a Jan. 25 cover story in the Sunday New York Times Business Section contained 2,326 words — not one of which was “gay.” Instead, Bacanovic was referred to as a “bachelor.”  Gee guys, thanks for clearing that up...your Pulitzer's in the mail.   I couldn't care less whether these two bozos are straight, closet-gay or out-gay. I do care, however, about gay journalists and periodicals being responsible in their reporting. My search engines produced dozens of (mostly gay) blogs that are stating,   as fact  , that Bacanovic and Faneuil are gay, mostly citing these gay media sources. That's not fair to Bacanovic and Faneuil, and it's not fair to us.     How can we demand that the media, the commentators, the politicians, the judges, etc., be fair and accurate about us if we're not fair and accurate ourselves?     As far as I can tell, the  urlLink New York Blade  started this thread of questionable journalism. In my opinion, they should either show their evidence or print a retraction.     UPDATE  : The "it's circular, so it's true" irresponsibility continues:  urlLink queerday.com  reiterated its assertion that Bacanovic is out-gay over the weekend. Their source:  urlLink another gay news site , which got its info from... urlLink yet another gay news site  that got its info from ... "the gay elite":    Both Faneuil and Bacanovic are openly gay. In earlier testimony, Faneuil's former supervisor admit she once reprimanded him for cursing on company e-mail and had told him to stop using company e-mail for personal messages.   (HUH?!?)     Bacanovic, 41, had a reputation in New York's gay elite   (do they have an RSS feed?)   as a high flier and had amassed a small fortune working for some of New York's wealthiest investors.  On several occasions during the trial Rosie O'Donnell showed up to show her support for   Stewart  .  And you thought that WMD intel was flawed...

In your world, you do not have to be concerned with them: all you have to do is think.  &nbsp;  If--for any number of reasons, psychological or existential--a man comes to believe that the living world is closed to him, that he has nothing to seek or to achieve, that no action is possible, then chess becomes his antidote, the means of drugging his own rebellious mind that refuses fully to believe it and to stand still.   This, Comrade, is the reason why chess has always been so popular in your country, before and since [the Soviet] regime--and why there have not been many American masters.   You see, in this country, men are still free to act.    As true today as when Ayn Rand wrote it in 1972.  &nbsp;  The article includes commentary on Fischer's behavior, which was as eccentric back then as it has been recently.&nbsp; Give the whole piece a read.  &nbsp;

      An update,  urlLink via AP , to  urlLink my previous post  on the shameful act of nine Members of Congress calling for U.N. supervision of the 2004 election.   Think the passions from the 2000 presidential election have cooled? Certainly not in the House, which voted Thursday to strike a Florida representative's words from the record after she said Republicans "stole" that closely fought contest.   The verbal battle broke out after Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., proposed a measure barring any federal official from requesting that the United Nations formally observe the U.S. elections on Nov. 2. His proposal was approved 243-161 as an amendment to a $19.4 billion foreign aid bill, with 33 Democrats joining all 210 voting Republicans in voting "yes."   Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., and several other House Democrats have made that suggestion. They argue that some black voters were disenfranchised in 2000 and problems could occur again this fall.   "We welcome America to observe the integrity of our electoral process and we do not ask, though, for the United Nations to come as monitors at our polling stations," Buyer said.   "I come from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat. We need to make sure it doesn't happen again," Brown said. "Over and over again after the election when you stole the election, you came back here and said, 'Get over it.' No, we're not going to get over it. And we want verification from the world."   At that point, Buyer demanded that Brown's words be "taken down," or removed the debate's permanent record.   The House's presiding officer, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, ruled that Brown's words violated a House rule.   "Members should not accuse other members of committing a crime such as, quote, stealing, end quote, an election," Thornberry said.   When Brown objected to his ruling, the Republican-run House voted 219-187 along party lines to strike her words.   Bravo...

      From the New York Times:   The   fast-growing (SIC!!!) movement to unionize graduate students   at the nation's private universities suffered a crushing setback yesterday when the National Labor Relations Board reversed itself and ruled that students who worked as research and teaching assistants did not have the right to unionize.   In a case involving Brown University, the labor board ruled 3 to 2 that   graduate teaching and research assistants were essentially students, not workers  , and thus should not have the right to unionize to negotiate over wages, benefits and other conditions of employment.  ...    "The previous decision in the N.Y.U. case overturned over 30 years of determinations   by the National Labor Relations Board on whether graduate students who worked as teaching and research assistants were students or employees," Mr. Steinbach said. "And it threatened the traditional relationship between colleges and their graduate student assistants."  ...  After the N.Y.U. decision, graduate teaching and research assistants at Brown, Columbia, Tufts and the University of Pennsylvania voted on whether they should unionize, but those universities appealed to the National Labor Relations Board.  ...  The board noted that   graduate students spend most of their energy and hours on their studies, rather than their work  . Stating that the National Labor Relations Act was "designed to cover economic relationships," the majority concluded: "The Board's longstanding rule that it will not assert jurisdiction over relationships that are 'primarily educational' is consistent with these principles."   Some thoughts:   This nonsense is anything but "fast-growing." The jackholes at the  urlLink United Auto Workers  were trying to unionize graduate students when I was at Cornell   fifteen years ago  .&nbsp; "Economics T.A.&nbsp;= auto worker" ... yeah right, that really makes sense.   The typical tenure of a masters candidate is 2-3 years; a doctoral student perhaps 5-7 years.&nbsp; No graduate student who ever votes to unionize will ever be around for very long.&nbsp; "Graduate student" is not a career; heck, it's not even an "occupation."&nbsp; Why should students 10, 15, or 25 years later be required to join a union based on a vote by a fleeting group of people who not only are no longer there, but who knew a priori that they wouldn't be there for long?   I spent a total of nine years as a graduate student and a professional school student.&nbsp; Everyone knows the deal:  poverty and grueling work today = tremendous success tomorrow .&nbsp; Even if you believe unions ever serve any valid purpose (I don't), simply getting a paycheck should not automatically open the door to unionization in all circumstances.&nbsp; The relentless campaign by the UAW is a naked, shameful power grab (remember:  members = dues ).   Congrats to the NLRB for overturning a horrible decision.

Red Primer for Children and Diplomats    This book is a primer, constructed in a plain fashion, with few words and many drawings. The simple format is appropriate, for the message of Red Primer for Children and Diplomats is crystal clear: Those who do not read history are condemned to repeat it.  The author (he is both artist and writer) is Victor Vashi, who was a political cartoonist for one of Budapest's leading newspapers, 8 Irai Ujsag. He is familiar with revolution. He lived through both the Nazi and Soviet occupations of Hungary.  Mr. Vashi received a thorough education in Communism, learning in the process that the classes held in different Russian prison camps were most uncomfortable. He turned down the suggestion of the Soviets that he continue his studies, "tip-toed" across the border into Austria, and eventually made his way to the United States.

       Fun, if premature, data from Vermont, courtesy of   urlLink  IGF        In 2002, 3,633 Vermont couples got married; that same year, 2,653 got divorced.   Imagine seven Vermont couples in a room; five of them will get divorced.   And some of these folks know this, because they've been divorced already; just under half of the marriages in 2002 were firsts for both bride and groom.   Contrast this with gay couples: 161 Vermont couples entered into a civil union in 2002; that same year, nine dissolved their civil unions.   Eighteen couples are in a room; for 14 of them, this is their first legalized commitment; only one of them will divorce.      Obviously two years in one atypical state does not conclusively prove anything, (just like   urlLink  this doesn't prove anything either   ) but these numbers certainly bring a smirk to one's face.   I guess gay marriage   is   a threat to traditional marriage after all -- if embarrassing the heck out of the bigots constitutes a "threat."

Hawking's own work was responsible for generating the black hole information paradox. ...this runs contrary to the laws of quantum physics, which dictate that this information can never be completely lost.     Like A Democrat -- Disregard for Duly-Enacted Laws:    The physicist argued that the extreme gravitational fields of black holes overturned these laws.     Unlike a Democrat -- Keeps His Campaign Promises:    The U-turn could cost Hawking an encyclopaedia.

Hawking and Thorne are expected to present Preskill with an encyclopaedia of his choice.

      Why hasn't  urlLink this story  jumped the pond?  Bill Clinton says that   no government could have failed to act against Iraq after the 11 September 2001 attacks in view of intelligence provided  .  ... But he said war could have been avoided if the UN had passed a resolution threatening military action.   Such a resolution would have given the inspectors more time to finish their job, he said.  ... He said that while containment of Iraq was working   the situation regarding Saddam Hussein was different after the 11 September attacks  .   "The issue was not whether he would use [weapons of mass destruction] but whether he was likely to give them away or have them stolen," he said. "That's why the world supported inspections."   Of course, Bill's remarks could just be part of the  urlLink vast Clinton-wing conspiracy  against Kerry (see also  urlLink here ).  Hat tip to  urlLink Captain's Quarters .

      Read  urlLink this  from Bruce Bawer:   I moved from the U.S. to Europe in 1998, and I’ve been drawing comparisons ever since. Living in turn in the Netherlands, where kids come out of high school able to speak four languages, where gay marriage is a non-issue, and where book-buying levels are the world’s highest, and in Norway, where a staggering percentage of people read three newspapers a day and where respect for learning is reflected even in Oslo place names (“Professor Aschehoug Square”; “Professor Birkeland Road”), I was tempted at one point to write a book lamenting Americans’ anti-intellectualism—their indifference to foreign languages, ignorance of history, indifference to academic achievement, susceptibility to vulgar religion and trash TV, and so forth. On point after point, I would argue, Europe had us beat.   Yet as my weeks in the Old World stretched into months and then years, my perceptions shifted.   Yes, many Europeans were book lovers—but which country’s literature most engaged them? Many of them revered education—but to which country’s universities did they most wish to send their children? (Answer: the same country that performs the majority of the world’s scientific research and wins most of the Nobel Prizes.)   Yes, American television was responsible for drivel like “The Ricki Lake Show”—but Europeans, I learned, watched this stuff just as eagerly as Americans did (only to turn around, of course, and mock it as a reflection of American boorishness). No, Europeans weren’t Bible-thumpers—but the Continent’s ever-growing Muslim population, I had come to realize, represented even more of a threat to pluralist democracy than fundamentalist Christians did in the U.S. And yes, more Europeans were multilingual—but then, if each of the fifty states had its own language, Americans would be multilingual, too.  I’d marveled at Norwegians’ newspaper consumption; but what did they actually read in those newspapers?  Hat tip to  urlLink Virginia Postrel .

      A hat trick of sorrowful stories from Africa:    urlLink Guinea  (independent since 1958):   Angry crowds have attacked rice trucks and looted warehouses in the West African nation of Guinea, where   a 20-year-old government that has provided little electricity, water or development   faces a critical new shortage: food.   Soaring rice prices abroad and alleged mismanagement at home -   in a lavishly green country of ample rainfall and mineral wealth   - have helped make a bag of the staple unaffordable for many.  ...  In his hometown, Diallo said, rice was selling at $36 for a 110-pound bag - in a land where most earn people less than a dollar a day. "That's never been seen, in the history of the country," he said.  ...  Trying to quell popular anger, the government demanded merchants sell the rice for $20 a bag, promising a subsidy of $5 per sack.   urlLink Kenya  (independent since 1963):   President Mwai Kibaki declared Kenya's food shortage a national disaster on Wednesday, saying some 3.3 million Kenyans need emergency food assistance because of a widespread drought.  ...  Kibaki's call for help came one day after Britain's ambassador suggested international aid could be cut off because of   a resurgence in corruption   in the East African nation.  ...  Kibaki was elected in December 2002 largely because of his promises to battle graft. Corruption had been widespread under his predecessor, Daniel arap Moi.  ...    But the European Union, United States and Japan earlier this month warned of resurgent corruption, echoing concerns by some Kenyan officials.     urlLink Sudan  (independent since 1956) &amp; Chad (independent since 1963):   Along Chad's border with Sudan, tens of thousands of villagers have slaughtered their last sheep, shared their last water and given up their own clothes to help the more than 1 million Sudanese refugees driven from their homes by fighting in Darfur. U.N. officials estimate some 100,000 Chad villagers are in as desperate need of food, water and help as the refugees.  ...  For 17 months, Arab raiders on horses and camels, backed by Sudanese airplanes and helicopter gunships, have razed hundreds of villages in Darfur in   attacks described by human rights groups as ethnic cleansing  . Up to 30,000 people have been killed, the United Nations estimates.  ...    U.N. and U.S. officials accuse President Omar el-Bashir's government of backing the militias.    ...  He also blames the remoteness of Darfur, insufficient funding and   restrictions imposed by the Sudanese government on humanitarian work in the region  .  Yes, Africa got royally screwed under European colonialism (compare and contrast the current moronic accusations of U.S. "imperialism" in Iraq and elsewhere). The continent, furthermore, like most of the Old World, is still plagued by ancient (and irrational) religious and cultural conflicts often compounded by arbitrary borders.   Nevertheless, after 40+ years of independence, plus the worldwide examples of the success of capitalism and democracy versus the failures of statism, communism and socialism, isn't it time for the nightmare to end and for Africa to at least try to function like (or strive to become) modern nations?  &nbsp;   UPDATE:  The U.N. has issued  urlLink a major report  on poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, chock full of typically U.N.-sounding recommendations:    Sub-Saharan countries need to foster macroeconomic management   [read: central planning]   and good governance, and to sharply boost agricultural production, the report said. They also need to focus on creation of institutional and social capabilities and diversify their economies, it found.  "Only along this path will sub-Saharan Africa be able not just to break out of the vicious circle of poverty, but also to move on to achieving economy-wide productivity growth," the Vienna-based agency said.  Keep it simple, guys: property rights, democracy and constrained military and police power will get you most of the way there.

       urlLink A small but important victory for due process :  On June 30, a California man being forced to pay child support for a child he had not fathered got his day in court when the Second District Court of Appeal of California overturned a paternity judgment against him.  Los Angeles County, which had imposed the judgment, knew that Manuel Navarro was not the father of the child in question because DNA testing had proved so. Yet under both federal and state child-support laws, the county was still able to demand Navarro pay child support. ... In July 1996, a court judgment established Navarro's paternity [  based solely on the mother's statement and an unanswered summons delivered by substitute service  ] and ordered $247 a month in child-support payments. ... In July 2001, Navarro filed a motion to set aside the court's judgment because a blood test proved he was not the boys' [sic] father. Although both the federal and state "challenge periods" had long passed, he argued that the mother had committed fraud by naming him.  He also claimed to have never received the original complaint or default judgment. The court denied the motion. ... In hearing Navarro's appeal, the Second District Court acknowledged that "by strict application of the law, appellant should be denied relief ...   Sometimes even more important policies than the finality of judgments are at stake  , however."  The appeals court explained, "the County ... should not enforce child-support judgments it knows to be unfounded. And in particular, it should not ask the courts to assist it in doing so. Despite the Legislature's clear directive that child-support agencies not pursue mistaken child-support actions, the County persists in asking that we do so.   We will not sully our hands by participating in an unjust, and factually unfounded, result.   We say no to the County, and we reverse."  I don't practice in California (heck, I don't practice anywhere), but I seem to recall from my bar-exam-cram memories of family law and civil procedure that, at least in New York, child support orders are   always   subject to modification based on "changed circumstances" (and showing that someone is not the father certainly qualifies). I also seem to recall that default judgments are relatively easy to get set aside and are not always subject to full faith and credit in other states' courts.  One way or the other, it seems that common sense does exist in California, at least occasionally.   urlLink Brainwash  has a post with some more paternity suit horror stories.   UPDATE:  Sleazy Los Angeles bureaucrats are trying a novel and disgraceful tactic to circumvent the ruling -- see  urlLink here .

      Cause for celebration, courtesy of  urlLink Wired :   A controversial and much-delayed proposed airline screening system may face further delays as the Transportation Security Administration restructures the system to better protect privacy and civil liberties, a senior homeland security official told Congress on Tuesday.   Adm. David Stone, acting administrator for the Transportation Security Administration, told members of the Senate Commerce Committee that the Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening System II, known as CAPPS II, "is not going forward as previously briefed." He said the rethinking was in response to a February report critical of the program, as well as the   TSA's own privacy concerns (SIC!!!)  .   "The Department of Homeland Security and the TSA feel very strongly we should not move forward on any program that in any way infringes on preserving our freedoms," Stone said. "That is first and foremost."  ... The system, as originally proposed, would require all passengers to provide extra information when booking a ticket -- information that airlines don't currently ask for, like addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth. The system would then check that information against databases of criminals and terrorists and assign each passenger a green, yellow or red score, according to perceived risk.  ...  I'm all for safe flying, but my recent travels have convinced me that armored cockpit doors and basic,   competent   security screening at the airport should solve the flaws of September 11.  And as for data mining schemes like CAPPS II, even if I trusted the TSA (HA!), I will  urlLink never ever trust the airlines  with my personal data.  Background on CAPPS II  urlLink here .

       urlLink Wired  reports on one of my pet peeve issues:   It's one of the most perplexing questions ever to face humankind: Why can't you buy just the cable channels you actually watch?  ... Several lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), already support mandated "a la carte" carriage. Under such a system, people could pick only the few channels they want rather than have to buy large "tiers" of cable programming that include 70 or 80 channels.     The cable industry argues that an a la carte system would destroy the economics of the business.   The argument goes like this:   Without carriage on broad tiers, startup and niche programming wouldn't be able to attract advertising and would quickly wither away, leaving consumers with fewer choices. In addition, as audiences fragment among all the channels,   plummeting advertising rates would force surviving networks to raise the license fees they charge cable companies. Those higher fees would in turn get passed right along to customers, increasing the price of each individual channel.    ... Consumer advocates, however, charge that the cable industry just wants to preserve its power to squash any independent networks in which it doesn't have an ownership stake.  ... Of course,   it's unclear how much power the big cable companies actually wield (SIC!!!)  .  ... In May, the House Commerce Committee requested that the FCC study the a la carte issue. Legal comments in that proceeding are due on Thursday, and the final report is expected out later this fall.   Some quick thoughts: 1.  As for the first emphasized statement -- cable is still for the most part a government-sanctioned monopoly, especially in major metropolitan areas where residential satellite is simply not an option.  He who lives by state-granted monopoly...  2.  The second and third emphasized statements are mutually exclusive.  The cable companies cannot simultaneously say that they will completely pass on any license cost increases to consumers and at the same time deny that they have market power (in economics terms, we're about  urlLink price elasticity of demand ).  Bottom line: You either have a captive audience or you don't.  If you do, then stop whining about losing some of your (government-imposed) monopoly profits.  If you don't, then stop claiming that competition won't work.  More on a la carte cable  urlLink here .

       urlLink Fun with Statistics : Academic study reveals: Ice cream production is closely correlated with the rate of forcible rape. Yes, that's right -- Professor Eugene Volokh, of the prestigious UCLA School of Law and the even more prestigious  urlLink Volokh Conspiracy  Web log, has uncovered scientific evidence that ice cream production is closely correlated with the forcible rape rate.  Professor Volokh used 2000 data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, and 2000 data from the international Dairy Foods Association's Dairy Facts publication; the correlation was 0.84, which is very high (1 would be a perfect correlation and 0 would be no correlation at all). Unfortunately, data on monthly ice cream consumption was unavailable, but ice cream production data seems likely to be a good rough proxy for ice cream consumption.   It is time, especially in this election season, that Big Dairy be asked some serious questions about this disturbing phenomenon and about its impact on the women and children of our nation. Professor Volokh (volokh at law.ucla.edu) is available for interviews and commentary on this important research finding.   Volokh then delivers the punch line. If you look at the spreadsheet, you'll find that ice cream sales are higher in the summer; so are sex crimes. Seems likely that the time of the year helps cause both phenomena, rather than one causing the other. Maybe it isn't time for the Big Dairy lawsuits just yet.   In other words, correlation does not imply causation.  Amazing how the simplest rules are so often the first forgotten.  Sidebar: Maybe this is what  urlLink Mayor Blooperberg had in mind ...

       urlLink This  makes me sick:  GAZA'S KILLING SCHOOL    Children as young as 10 are being recruited to fight for the Palestinian cause.  Sky News has gained access to a young people's camp in Gaza, where the only lesson taught is how to kill Israelis.    Sky's Middle East Correspondent Emma Hurd said the camp, at an undisclosed location, had been set up to drill children in the ways of war.             The recruits, some of whom are dwarfed by their AK-47 assault rifles, are taught how to carry out ambushes.             They are also made to do an obstacle course, crawling under barbed wire and leaping through hoops of fire while their instructors fire live bullets overhead.     Hurd witnessed one training session in which a militant, dressed as a Jewish settler complete with yarmulke skull cap, was ambushed in his car.Gunmen pulled the "settler" from his vehicle and Hurd was told if this had been real he would have been killed.             She spoke to two 10-year-old recruits.             One of them, Mustafa, said he wanted to shoot down Israeli aircraft and blow up tanks.             The camp is run by a group called the Popular Resistance Committee, which said the next generation of Palestinians needed to know how to fight the Israeli "occupation".             The boys even "graduate" at the end of their training, receiving a certificate from the camp commander.  A few thoughts: 1.  If this were happening right outside my door, I'd build  urlLink a wall  too. 2.  What is  urlLink UNICEF  doing about this?  Or any other part of the U.N., for that matter?(Rhetorical question, of course --  urlLink we know exactly what they're doing about it .)

      Consider the following, from the  urlLink New York Times Op-Ed pages :   Slot machines are fast becoming America's preferred way to tax the poor. Politicians from a growing number of states have decided that slots can help pay education costs or stave off tax increases. But it's a fool's bargain. Slot machines, as any experienced gambler can tell you, are a sucker's game. While   they are a harmless amusement for many  , their increasing accessibility is draining money away from   too many people who cannot afford it   (SIC!!!).    The check-cashing services and A.T.M.'s located next to so many slots are mute testimony to the inability of many gamblers to bet only what they can afford.   And yet the states that are relying more on gambling are playing carnival barker, urging even the poor to step right up and risk more.    Many experts have spent a lot of time making these machines entertaining and seductive.   They have earned a deserved reputation in the trade as the "crack cocaine of gambling," or, as one columnist wrote, "a tax on the easily duped." The machines are mathematically rigged to take your money and psychologically crafted to help turn you into a gambling addict (SIC!!!).  Let's take all this as true -- so what?  Just about everything the Times says about slot machines could just as easily be said about, e.g., movies.  It's a taxed activity, a disproportionate number of poor people spend a disproportion share of their income on it, studios and theaters are making the movie experience "entertaining and seductive," many theaters have ATM's to facilitate increased spending (did it ever occur to the Times that people might not want to carry lots of money around going to and from the gaming parlor?).  And, unlike a session at the slots, a moviegoer is   guaranteed   to have lost all their expenditure when it's over.  Yes, an extremely small number of people are addicted to gambling (even in Nevada, the best estimates are only 2-3% of gamblers have even a slight gambling problem).  And we know that the government profits big time from others addictions -- tobacco, alcohol, etc. -- so, again, what's the big deal with slots?  Of course, the issue is not one of economics or of policy (I actually do agree with certain aspects of the Times' editorial as to specific state policies and proposals -- especially its criticism of New York's system, where a pathetically low share of gaming revenues actually makes it to the schools that gaming is allegedly supporting).  The point is the   condescension   weaved into the piece -- slots are not a "seemly, dignified" activity to the Times editors -- they're the "wrong" sort of fun, and government should not facilitate you enjoying yourself in the "wrong" ways.  Viva Las Vegas!

      An update to  urlLink my earlier post  on John Edwards' backers, courtesy of Walter Olson in the Wall Street Journal (subscription site, sorry, but see  urlLink here ):   What scares the daylights out of his business adversaries isn't just that Mr. Edwards is a seasoned trial lawyer who decided to switch careers, in the manner of Orrin Hatch, Ernest Hollings and others. It's that from day one he's been at pains to construct a tightly organized fund-raising and electoral machine whose dominant figures, with scarcely a known exception, are wealthy plaintiff's lawyers like himself. In fact,   most of his key backers are drawn from the tiny handful of tort lawyers even more successful than he, sometimes by orders of magnitude  . Mr. Edwards is estimated to have quit with $38 million, but that's pocket change to many veterans of the tobacco and asbestos wars. ... Famously unapologetic, the Edwards campaign merely shrugged this spring when Sen. Kerry's press secretary assailed the North Carolinian's White House bid as "wholly funded by trial lawyers." More remarkable yet was how Edwards's spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri had earlier responded to similar sniping: "  We have no problem if 100% of our money came from trial lawyers.  " On the relatively few issues on which Mr. Edwards has taken a high profile in the Senate, agenda items for the trial bar (e.g., blocking limits on future post-terrorism lawsuits) have comprised a high share. There's every reason to believe that the men behind Mr. Edwards have a clear expectation of entering Washington next January as victors, and closer to the center of power than they've up to now dared to dream.  I said from the outset that this issue had legs...and now they're being stretched.

      Oh good grief,  urlLink not again ...   A proposed anti-war billboard set to be displayed in Times Square is stirring up a lawsuit.   The proposed ad shows a bomb and reads, "Democracy Is Best Taught by Example, Not by War." It was scheduled to appear on the Marriott Marquis Hotel from August 2nd through Election Day in November.   However, the company that owns the ad space, Clear Channel, has decided not to allow the billboard to be posted. Clear Channel says the design was rejected because of the bomb image.   Project Billboard, the group that created the ad, says Clear Channel asked billboard designers not only to change the picture, but to change the text as well.   On Monday, Project Billboard announced   it has filed a lawsuit   against Clear Channel for the company’s refusal to post the billboard.   NY1 has reached out to Clear Channel for comment, and have not yet heard back.  Detailed NYT article  urlLink here .  How often do we need to rehash this?  Okay, pay attention, class, repeat after me:   THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "PRIVATE CENSORSHIP"!    Clear Channel is incapable of "censoring" anything (or  urlLink anyone )!  It's their billboard, they can can agree or refuse to accept whatever advertising they want.  If you don't like it, then buy your own billboard.  It appears that the spurned plaintiffs (n.B., I was unable to find a link to their organization) are framing the action as a breach of contract claim. Fair enough, though a first-year law school student could tell you that they almost certainly cannot seek specific performance as a remedy.  Still, don't be surprised if they try to weave some sort of First Amendment claim into the complaint (perhaps some form of loosey-goosey "public forum" argument).  Stay tuned...

      Little late to the blogosphere on this one, since I only learned about it  urlLink today .   Several members of the House of Representatives have requested the United Nations to send observers to monitor the November 2 US presidential election to avoid a contentious vote like in 2000, when the outcome was decided by Florida.   Recalling the long, drawn out process in the southern state, nine lawmakers, including four blacks and one Hispanic, sent  urlLink a letter  Thursday to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan asking that the international body "ensure free and fair elections in America," according to a statement issued by Texas representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who spearheaded the effort.  "This is the first step in making sure that history does not repeat itself," she added after requesting that the UN "deploy election observers across the United States" to monitor the November, 2004 election.   As the  urlLink New York Post  points out:  The last presidential election was remarkable for several reasons — the astonishingly close margin of victory being only the most memorable.   Of more significance was the measured manner in which American tradition and respect for law resolved   a conflict that in many — if not most — other countries would have seen soldiers in the streets  .   There never was a crisis, despite the hyperventilated media commentary.   And, fever-swamp rhetoric to the contrary,   nobody stole anything in 2000  : George Bush won fair and square — even if it could easily have gone the other way without offending the basic facts.  ... Meanwhile, Annan presides over a congress comprised largely of cutthroats and footpads — representatives of nations where a peaceful transfer of power is as alien as a free election.  The United Nations can't bestir itself to stop incipient genocide in Sudan — or even to speak forcefully against it —   yet [the Representatives] think the organization has something to teach America about free elections?      The buffoons are: Corrine Brown Julia Carson Joseph Crowley Elijah Cummings Danny Davis Raul Grijalva Michael Honda Carolyn Maloney  Jerrold Nadler  P.S.  For more on how   really   to avoid a repeat of the 2000 election, see  urlLink my previous post .

      Much is being blogged about the decline and fall of the  urlLink Federal Marriage Amendment  (best overview I've seen is at  urlLink Overlawyered.com ).  Two quick additional observations:  First, with so much drivel about the " urlLink sanctity of marriage " -- how about some acknowledgement of the sanctity of the constitutional amendment process?  Historically, constitutional amendments can be partitioned into three categories:  1.  Protection of individual liberties: 1-10, 13, 14 2.  Expansion of the franchise: 12, 15, 17, 19, 23, 24, 26 3.  Structural revisions: 11, 16, 20, 22, 25, 27    Once and only once   was substantive law incorporated into the Constitution: Prohibition.  It was (obviously) a failure (sold to the American people, incidentally, based on fraudulent advertising -- most supporters assumed low-alcohol beverages would be exempt).  Have we learned nothing from that experience?  Second, opponents of gay marriage love to cite  urlLink polls  showing that, barely, the American people as a whole oppose gay marriage.  Besides the whole "Are equal rights subject to a majority vote?" response to that argument, there's also  urlLink this little tidbit :  Younger adults are evenly split over gay marriages, but older Americans are opposed by a 4-1 margin, according to a poll examining attitudes about homosexuality.  To put it not so delicately: As the older bigots die off over time, full-and-equal gay marriage, on a national scale, will become inevitable.  In the meantime, it looks like the current FMA not only won't get the required two-thirds vote, but  urlLink it may acutally be defeated outright .  So much the better...

       urlLink This totally unimportant posting on Slate  got me re-thinking about a very important issue indeed -- the  urlLink Electoral College  and whether it should be replaced with a simple popular vote.    Before   Bush v. Gore, I was unequivocally, perhaps even violently, in favor of scrapping the E.C. in favor of a simple popular vote (plurality wins, no runoff).  It just seemed so -- well, so "Duh!" -- that we, as a modern, literate, technological electorate, could handle a nationwide popular vote, couldn't we?  All we have to do is add up all the local tallies -- a few dozen guys with  urlLink HP-12c's  could do it.  Then came West Palm Beach, butterfly ballots, senior citizens claiming to have mistakenly voted for Buchanan (never bought into that one), hanging chads,  urlLink that ugly guy with the magnifying glass , not to mention millions of people proving their collective inability to decipher  urlLink a relatively straightforward Supreme Court ruling .  Was there any way we could survive  urlLink 3,141  of those nightmares?  Could the courts handle the lawsuits?  I've concluded that the best answer is probably the " urlLink District Method " used by Maine and Nebraska.  It would move us light years closer to the equivalent of a simple popular vote while minimizing the likelihood of a Florida 2000:   "Rather than giving all electoral votes to the statewide plurality winner as today, this method would only give the two statewide votes to the statewide winner and divide up the rest of the votes by giving one vote to the plurality winner in each Congressional district. This method of distribution has been used in Maine since 1972 and Nebraska since 1996,   though neither state has had different winners in different Congressional districts or statewide  . Consequently, neither state has ever spilt its electoral votes."  urlLink Source.    Of course, many less homogeneous states -- especially New York, California, Illinois and Florida -- would certainly split their votes dramatically in the upcoming election.    In 2000, 33 of the 50 states would have split their electoral votes under the District Method!    The District Method would certainly not be without controversy or concern, however:   "Using Congressional districts to determine each elector would also draw more attention to the way districts are drawn, already a hot-topic in politics today. The vast majority of districts are drawn as “safe zones” for one of the two major political parties and using them for the Presidential election would considerably raise the stakes of redistricting. Since these “safe zones” have strong partisan majorities, truly competitive districts would be rare."  urlLink Source.   Sure, but could it be any worse than Florida 2000?  Of course, it would still be possible (though   far less likely  ) for an electoral/popular split with the District Method, and I also suspect the potential of  urlLink third-party spoilers  would remain (again, with   far   lower probability) under the District Method.  Are we likely to see the E.C. scrapped or modified?  Not likely.  First, I'm not sure the District Method could be legislatively mandated at the federal level (on states' rights grounds), and the courts certainly cannot hear the issue, on  urlLink political question  grounds.  Any nationwide change would have to come through a constitutional amendment.  On a state-by-state basis, perhaps there will some movement away from all-or-nothing electoral awards.  But expect any change to be at glacier speed.  And as for 2004?  Bring it on...  P.S.  Oh, how thoughtless of me, sorry... urlLink who would have won in 2000 under the District Method ?

      A little intellectual armor to repel any  urlLink Bush-Lay nonsense , courtesy of  urlLink Debra Saunders :   To judge by punditry, the most damning fact of all is that Dubya had a nickname for Lay, "Kenny Boy." Ooooo. A nickname. That should make Bush as tight with Lay as he is with -- what? -- 20 reporters.   On the other hand,   President Clinton played golf with Kenny Boy.   And Enron gave $1.5 million to Democrats from 1990 to 2003...  ... Bush could have noted that   his Justice Department filed these charges against Lay  . Not only that, they're going after other corporate crooks. The Corporate Fraud Task Force he created has charged some 700 defendants with alleged fraud, according to Forbes magazine. The task force has been so tough that the Economist ran a piece last month, which asked, "Are bosses getting overly harsh sentences?"   More important: When Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to help him avoid filing bankruptcy (as happened in December 2001),   Kenny Boy won no favors  . When Robert Rubin -- Clinton's Treasury secretary, then head of Citigroup, an Enron creditor -- called a top Treasury official to suggest that the administration take steps to prevent Enron's credit rating from being downgraded, the official refused.  And you can rest assured that, while Bush is President, Lay won't be able to  urlLink buy a pardon .

      An update,  urlLink via the U.K.'s Telegraph  to  urlLink my earlier post  on Kerry v. Vatican:   American Catholic bishops are trying to defy secret advice from Rome that Communion should not be given to John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate.  The advice is contained in an explosive memo - clearly directed at Sen Kerry - by Cardinal Ratzinger, the Pope's doctrinal advisor, who is head of the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith -   the institutional heir to the Inquisition  . ... The tone and content of Cardinal Ratzinger's memo, which was leaked to an Italian magazine last week, leave little room for misunderstanding.   Some passages appear to have been drafted specifically with Sen Kerry in mind  . ... The leaking of Cardinal Ratzinger's memo has hugely embarrassed Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the Archbishop of Washington and head of the "domestic policy" commission of the US Catholic Bishops Conference. ... Michael Novak, a Catholic theologian, said: "Ratzinger's letter was stronger and firmer than we were led to believe. It's pretty dynamite stuff."  Only four American bishops, including Archbishop Raymond Burke of St Louis, have so far said they would refuse communion to Sen Kerry. Conservative Catholics believe the publication of the memo will boost their credibility among mainstream Catholics.  If I have to take sides, I guess I'll support Kerry and the Rome-defying bishops on this one.  The real issue, however, is   how will  urlLink Mr. "World Leaders Prefer Me"  and Mr. Vice  urlLink "Let's Make America Respected in the World Again"  react to this particular world leader  ?

      It's no secret that Europeans are overwhelmingly, and irrationally, opposed to genetically-modified foods. Here are two updates, one regarding  urlLink GM wine  and one for  urlLink GM beer .   Some excerpts:   On wine:    "It is of utmost importance that the future of our profession is not determined solely under the influence of scientists, industrialists and technocrats," the group said in a statement...  ...  "We're not persuaded that the tests will start with the maximum   (SIC!!!)   number of precautions that we consider absolutely   (SIC!!!)   necessary," said Alain Graillot, the president of the vintners association, which also includes winegrowers from California to Germany.  On Beer:    Although   research on GM foods hasn't yielded any nightmare scenarios   about damage to life and limb, Nicholas Fjord of Malmoe in southern Sweden, is not entirely convinced, either.   Despite reassurances that genetically modified products are safe, an image keeps popping up in Fjord's mind about a relative whose mother took Thalidomide   (SIC!!!)   in the 1960s because she was assured it was safe.  Better, cheaper alcohol...what a nightmare!  &nbsp; Could the real concern of European vintners be that there is an  urlLink ongoing wine glut  in the world?   More from Reason Magazine on the hysteria over genetically-modified foods  urlLink here .  &nbsp; Update:  urlLink Samizadata  reports that the wine glut may last yet another year...Salut!

      As you may have noticed, my blogging interests are overwhelmingly oriented toward domestic policy and culture.   urlLink Here's an exception :   The highest U.N. court ruled Friday that Israel's planned 425-mile-long barrier in the West Bank violates international law (SIC!!!) and urged the United Nations to take action to stop its construction.  The International Court of Justice overwhelmingly dismissed Israel's arguments that the barrier was essential for its security and said the system of walls and fences went too far in infringing on the freedom of the Palestinians.    The court also ordered Israel to pay reparations   (SIC!!!) to Palestinians harmed by the barrier and return land seized to construct the wall, which is about a quarter completed.  A few points:  1.  There is no such thing as "international law!"  There are nation states that form   treaties and alliances   amongst themselves.  Exactly what treaty did Israel violate and with whom? (Let's keep in mind that, rightly or wrongly, there is no "Nation of Palestine.")  2.  Who's paying reparations to the families of Israelis slaughtered by Palestinian suicide bombers?  3.  If this decision of the World Court is valid, then why couldn't it also order the United States to pay "reparations" to Cuba and the Philippines (not to mention Native Americans), or to "order" us to grant Puerto Rico its independence?

      From the Wall Street Journal (subscription site -- sorry):   [ urlLink Santa Fe, New Mexico ] last year earned the dubious distinction of passing perhaps the most stringent "living wage" ordinance in the country. It demands that businesses pay a minimum of $8.50 an hour, increasing to $10.50 by 2008. (The federal minimum wage is $5.15.) Unlike "living wage" rules in about 100 other cities, Santa Fe's goes beyond public contracts and applies to   any private business with more than 25 employees  . ... The laws of economics suggest that the consequences will not be what this law's proponents expect. Companies with 30 or 35 employees will lay off staff to get below 25. Others will let go of their least-skilled workers and demand more from those who remain. More than a few will leave town, or refuse to expand. The Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce says it's already heard of eight businesses canceling plans to move to, or expand in, the city.  I was an economics T.A. at Cornell for four years.  Nothing ever stirred more "there is no Santa Claus?" looks of despair among the budding young Ivy League liberals than a simple supply-demand graph showing how the minimum wage (i.e., a price floor) creates a surplus (i.e., unemployment).  Somehow, though, most of them manage to suppress those traumatic memories as they grow older.  More on the stupidity of the minimum wage  urlLink here .    UPDATE:   My timing was bad today, for just after posting I encountered  urlLink this drivel  from Slate:   Ordinarily, when we decide to transfer income to some group or another—whether it be the working poor, the unemployed, the victims of a flood, or the stockholders of American Airlines—we pay for the transfer out of general tax revenue. That has two advantages: It spreads the burden across all taxpayers, and it makes politicians accountable for their actions. It's easy to look up exactly how much the government gave American, and it's easy to look up exactly which senators voted for it.   By contrast, the minimum wage places the entire burden on one small group: the employers of low-wage workers and, to some extent, their customers. Suppose you're a small entrepreneur with, say, 10 full-time minimum-wage workers. Then a 50 cent increase in the minimum wage is going to cost you about $10,000 a year. That's no different from a $10,000 tax increase. But the politicians who imposed the burden get to claim they never raised anybody's taxes.  Translation: There are "good" ways to be a socialist, and "bad" ways to be a socialist.  Pathetic...

      or: "Keep your friends close, but keep your celebrity friends quiet..."  Last night's  urlLink celebrity Kerry love-fest :   Whoopi Goldberg delivered an X-rated rant full of sexual innuendoes against President Bush last night at a Radio City gala that raised $7.5 million for the newly minted Democratic ticket of John Kerry and John Edwards.  Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia, and boasted that she'd refused to let Team Kerry clear her material. "I Xeroxed my behind and I folded it up in an envelope and I sent it back with a big kiss mark on because we're Democrats - we're not afraid to laugh," she said. ... Latin comedian John Leguizamo said he refuses to believe there are any Hispanic Republicans, claiming that's "an oxymoron," because "Latins for Republicans - it's like roaches for Raid." ... Screen legend Paul Newman blasted the Bush tax cuts, saying, "I am a traitor to my class. I think that tax cuts to wealthy thugs like me are borderline criminal - I live very high off the hog.  Kerry's response:   Kerry thanked all the performers for "an extraordinary evening"...

       urlLink New York Times article  on everyone's favorite getaway spot -- Laos.  Seems that, now that the people there actually have some money, they want -- surprise -- better homes, specifically concrete homes (apparently that's the equivalent of penthouse living there).  But guess who wants to stop them from building new concrete homes?  Why, the United Nations, of course, in a classic "preservation before people" illogic:   The town was named a world heritage site by Unesco in 1995, a designation that makes it eligible for United Nations preservation funds. Among other things, the residents are being offered traditional-style plaster instead of the big no-no - concrete - for refurbishment.  But the requests are being met with the kind of disdain that Manhattan residents often show the  urlLink New York City Landmarks Commission  when it asks for restraint in replacing leaky period windows in Art Deco buildings. In short, there is resistance.  "When we explain that timber is part of the tradition, they don't understand, because to people here   timber is the material of the poor  ," said Emmanuel Pouille, a French architect and historian, who is the chief technical adviser to the Unesco project. "Here, concrete is a symbol of being rich. They say,   'Why can't we live like the people in the suburbs of Bangkok?  ' ''   The U.N. do-gooders counter that preservation=tourism=money, but how many of the locals live in tourist attractions?    And   don't   get me started on the Landmarks Preservation Commission...I'm sure they'll be chiming in big-time as the  urlLink Second Avenue Subway process  ramps up.

      The Wall Street Journal (subscription site -- sorry) asks a very good question of John Kerry:   John Kerry explained his views on abortion last weekend to the Telegraph Herald of Dubuque, Iowa. "I oppose abortion, personally," he said. "I don't like abortion. I believe life does begin at conception. But I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist . . . who doesn't share it." ... Mr. Kerry seems to be trying to re-assure voters that his personal religious beliefs on abortion will not influence his policy-making (an assertion borne out by his 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America). And that's fair enough. We only wish that he and many of his fellow Senate Democrats would give the same benefit of the doubt to President Bush's judicial nominees who are privately opposed to abortion but say they will uphold Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. ... The message here seems to be: Liberals will keep their private views private, but conservatives cannot be trusted to do so. If Mr. Kerry's Catholic beliefs don't disqualify him from becoming President, and they shouldn't, then the same religious beliefs of conservative judicial nominees shouldn't disqualify them from serving as federal judges.

       urlLink Civil disobedience erupts in Ireland  in the wake of a tough national smoking ban:   The owners of Fibber Magees, a pub on Eyre Square in this nightlife-rich western city [of Galway], says its business is off by two-thirds because of the smoking ban.  This week, owners Ciaran Levanzin and Ronan Lawless plunked ashtrays on upstairs tables and taped up a sign, "You are now entering a smoking area."  By text-message and telephone, frustrated smokers and others quickly spread the news of Fibber Magees' rebellion. By Tuesday night, and for the first time in months, the pub's upstairs room was packed and thick with smoke.  Lawless insists the gambit is the only way to make money. Otherwise, he says, he will be forced to close by September.  "We're damned if we do and damned if we don't," Lawless said. "We're either going to go out of business or be put out of business."   Give the Irish government credit, though ... at least it doesn't  urlLink lie through its teeth  regarding its smoking ban.  Update:  urlLink The defiant pub was forced to shut down .

      An unusually mean (even by her standards) bit of  urlLink homophobic crap  from  urlLink Maggie Gallagher , who, having found   exactly one   adult child of gay parents who opposes gay marriage, essentially declares the issue closed.   "When growing up, I always had the feeling of being something unnatural," Cassidy says. "I came out of an unnatural (SIC!!!) relationship; it was something like I shouldn't be there. On a daily basis, it was something I was conflicted with. I used to wish, honestly that Pat wasn't there."   Why does she oppose same-sex marriage? "It's not something that a seal of approval should be stamped on: We shouldn't say it is a great and wonderful thing and then you have   all these kids   (SIC!!!) who later in life will turn around and realize they've been cheated (SIC!!!). The adults choose to have that lifestyle (SIC!!!) and then have a kid. They are fulfilling their emotional needs -- they want to have a child -- and they are not taking into account how that's going to feel to the child; there's a clear difference between having same-sex parents and a mom and a dad."   So apparently, by Gallagher's standards, if I can find a   single   adult child of a mixed-race couple (or a handicapped couple, or a multicultural couple, or a couple who later divorced, or a test-tube baby) who had anything less than a perfect childhood or who was in any way "conflicted" by their parents' "unnatural" relationship, then I'm entitled to call for bans on those kinds of families?  The intellectual bankruptcy of the bigots who are fighting gay marriage is imploding so rapidly that one can hardly keep up.  If this is the best that they can do, then we are really seeing the death throes of their debate.  Gay-marriage resources at  urlLink Lambda Legal  and  urlLink Human Rights Campaign .

The law-firm employees duly denied that their employers had signaled any willingness to reimburse the donations — that would constitute a violation of federal law, after all.

       urlLink Good op-ed  by the increasingly important  urlLink Dick Morris  on campaign contributions from John Edwards' trial lawyer friends:   During his run for the top job, John Edwards relied heavily on leading trial lawyers. Twenty-two of his top 25 donors were trial attorneys. And those donations likely cloak a multitude of sins and violations of the campaign-finance laws.   Edwards' trial lawyers bundled massive contributions from their assorted law firms and client lists to float his presidential run. Bundling isn't illegal — except when the donors are straw men and women putting up money given to them by a wealthy patron.   For example, $1 million of Edwards' funds came from trial lawyers' wives — identified merely as "homemakers" in the campaign-finance filings. If the money came from their husbands, there could be a violation of law.   I suspect this will have legs.

      Wall Street Journal article (subscription only -- sorry) on having law enforcement wear disguises in order to catch more speeding motorists:   But in a more unusual approach to law enforcement, policemen are starting to don an array of disguises in order to track speeding drivers without attracting attention. Since November, officers in Wilmington, N.C., have dressed up as golfers looking for their ball at the edge of a golf course and disguised themselves as construction workers fixing street lights.  Outfitted with radar guns, they radio ahead to a partner dressed in a normal police uniform, who then tickets the offending drivers. Officers there have adopted the look of a homeless person, wearing a bandana, old Army jacket, and jeans with the knees cut out, a beat-up duffle bag at their side.  State police in Pennsylvania last month also started disguising some officers, dressing them in camouflage and deploying them to wooded areas alongside state roads. In one recent five-hour stretch, they gave out 27 speeding tickets...   As a full-time pedestrian in NYC, I have very little sympathy for motorists who run red lights, don't signal, etc.  But the motivation behind programs such as these is interesting:  1.  If the police are in uniform and in plain sight, then motorists slow down.  Good.  2.  But if they slow down, then they don't get tickets.  Good.  3.  But if they don't get tickets, then the town loses money. Oh.  Just another example of the revenue-versus-prevention paradox (see, e.g., " urlLink sin taxes ").

      Zoning stupidities are bicoastal -- a review of NYC's zoning-induced housing shortage is available  urlLink here :   ...New York's housing gap is now between 111,000 and 370,000 units. Without question, the gap is growing: The city's latest Housing and Vacancy Survey found that, from 1999 to 2002, housing production only added 43,500 new units — even as the the Census found that the city's household population grew by 137,000. ...  A good place to begin reform is New York's zoning ordinance, an impossibly complex web that has too many zones and too many rules within each zone, applied to a capricious and anachronistic zoning map. The city's planners are now engaged in piecemeal rezoning. But to encourage greater housing development, the scope of rezoning must expand and its pace must accelerate. Ideally, we should replace the entire ordinance with a code that is simpler, easier to navigate and more effectively targeted on zoning's proper purpose of protecting neighborhood character.   The constraining impact of zoning is compounded by the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) and a stringent environmental-review procedure not applicable anywhere else in the state. The reports and hearings required by these regulatory reviews not only extend project time (and cost), but often invite deadly community or special interest opposition.    New York, New York: So nice they zoned it twice...

      Don't buy property in the New Soviet Union (a.k.a.  urlLink Kings County, Washington ), where a legislative proposal would prohibit development of (i.e., confiscate) 65% of   ALL   private land, for the sake of preventing "sprawl" --    "We're trying to keep the rural area a place that isn't just McMansions and ball courts, but instead has those natural processes," said Tim Trohimovich of the group  urlLink 1000 Friends of Washington , which aims to promote  healthy communities and cities  while protecting farmland and forests.   Huh?  How can you "promote" a city if you can't build anything?  What kind of population will it have (i.e., how many, and what kind of, people will be willing to risk living there, giving the "community" right to control your property -- and controlling your property means controlling   you  ).  But of course that's the idea.  Radical environmentalists and preservationists are not motivated by love of the forest/desert/coastline/swamp/mudpit/etc.  They are motivated by hatred of people.  The near complete emasculation of the  urlLink Takings Clause  is perhaps the single biggest long-term threat to individual liberty that we face.   urlLink Without property rights, no other rights are possible.

      A disturbing  urlLink update  to  urlLink my previous post  about the right of a   non  -parent to be treated like a   non  -parent:   A child-support agency is asking the California Supreme Court to stop  urlLink a ruling  in which DNA tests voided a man's obligation to pay child support from becoming a legal precedent. ... The Los Angeles County child-support agency has asked for the appellate court ruling to be "depublished," or omitted from official records, so no other man can use it to overturn his child-support order.  Santa Ana lawyer Linda S. Ferrer, who represents Mr. Navarro, says the agency wants the ruling off the books because it stands to lose a lot of money if more men use it to get their child-support orders overturned. ... The Navarro case has broad implications because the California Court of Appeal for the 2nd District was so blunt in its ruling. ... The Navarro "opinion is not based on law, the legislative declarations on which the opinion were based were misconstrued and misapplied to the facts, and the opinion will create confusion in the trial courts," Lori Cruz, deputy director of the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department, said in the letter to California Supreme Court Justice Ronald M. George. The California Legislature, she added, already is addressing the broader issues of DNA paternity testing and its impact on child-support orders. ... [M]any child-support officials are not sympathetic to the men, contending that losing a putative father's support is likely to be detrimental to the children. "At what point should the truth about genetic parentage outweigh the consequences of leaving a child fatherless?" Paula Roberts of the Center for Law and Social Policy asked in a 2003 paper.  Think about what Los Angeles is saying in its naked arrogance: "the facts be damned, the law be damned, fair play be damned, common sense be damned -- we need the money and the kid needs a dad!"  Contrary to Los Angeles' claim, there is no "confusion" here -- if you're not the father then you shouldn't have to pay child support. How "confusing" can that be? No one seems to be "confused" when DNA evidence exonerates a wrongfully-convicted defendant, and no one is ever perverse enough to suggest that at some point the victim's need for justice outweighs the innocent convict's.  I'm not familiar with the concept of "depublishing" an opinion. Some very hasty-stitchy research suggests that it may only exist in California (legal wonks see  urlLink here ). It's very common for minor, uncontroversial decisions never to be published in the first place. At the other end of the spectrum, if a case is so unusual that it should not be used as precedent, then the opinion can be "limited to its facts" (such was the case with  Bush v. Gore ).  But it seems to me that if you don't like a decision, then appeal it or go to the legislature. Don't play memory-hole games in an effort to try to hide the truth from the next innocent non-parent, who will have to re-invent the judicial wheel to get his vindication (which is not only unfair but also inefficient, since it could clog the courts with unnecessary litigation).  The move by Los Angeles amounts to nothing more than sleazy backdoor tactics by sleazy backdoor bureaucrats trying to do sleazy backdoor things to people who are undeniably 100% innocent. And all for a buck.  Shame on them. Let's hope the California Supreme Court slaps Los Angeles down as hard as it deserves to be.

      I'm sorry, but I refuse to get excited about the fact that  urlLink felons can't vote :  On Election Day it will not matter to some 4.7 million Americans whether they are Republicans, Democrats, independents or whether they have an opinion on anything at all. Under various state laws, they are barred from voting because they have felony records. This includes not just prison inmates (48 states), parolees (33 states) and probationers (29 states) but also a large number of people -- one third of the disenfranchised in all -- who are off parole and "free." Minorities are hit particularly hard by these state laws: They deny 13 percent of African American men the vote. ... The 14th Amendment permits states to deny the vote "for participation in rebellion, or other crime." And it can be argued that prisoners should not vote; after all, the purpose of prison is to deny freedom. But with ex-cons, the argument shifts. ... Another bald fact: Many disenfranchisement laws trace to the mid-1800s, when they were crafted to bar blacks with even minor criminal records from polls. Today this poisonous legal lineage tells not only in the South, which retains the most repressive statutes, but in states such as New York, where ex-parolees theoretically get their rights back but in reality encounter local election officials who demand discharge papers that don't exist, give misleading information and find other reasons to turn them away. A class-action lawsuit in New York charges that this system bars so many voters in high-crime neighborhoods that the districts effectively have lost their voice. In Florida, where many felons are barred forever unless the governor personally decides otherwise, 8 percent of adults cannot vote -- including one in four black men. ... Voting is not a privilege; it is the basic right that defines a citizen. Those denied it are, in effect, stateless -- people without a country. This is not a partisan issue, but one of basic human rights. People who have paid their debt to society should have their rights restored.  Um, no.  It needs to be said:   the best way to empower felons is by not being one of them  . Of all the people one can have sympathy -- misplaced or otherwise -- toward, people are choosing felons?  With all due respect to  urlLink Victor Hugo , the notion that there should always be a final, definitive cut-off point for punishment, that there should always be some clearly-drawn line beyond which lies total forgiveness and forgetfulness,   simply has no basis either in the law or in common sense  . Some punishments are and should be forever, and there is nothing intrinsic to the franchise to suggest that denying felons the vote cannot be one of those lifetime punishments.  I'm an attorney -- if I commit a great enough offense to my profession, then I can be disbarred for life. Same thing for my other day job as an investment banker -- a lifetime ban from the securities industry is an all too common event on Wall Street. People lose drivers licenses and other permits for life in certain circumstances. Countries can refuse people entry for life. We even   imprison   people for life if the crime is terrible enough. So what's the big deal about denying felons the right to vote?  Voting "defines a citizen"? I thought obeying the law and respecting the rights of others defined citizenship. To deny felons the vote is to deny them their rights? Didn't the felons themselves violate somebody's rights somewhere along the way, and might not the victims be suffering for life? Can't there be some "debts to society" that can never be totally repaid?  Certainly there may be specific instances of inconsistency or inappropriateness or flat-out abuse in the application of franchise denial to felons. But as a basic legal, political and philosophical question, there is simply no rational basis to oppose denying felons the franchise.  It's definitely fair...and it's probably wise.  Whether your true motivation is partisan politics, racial activism or a genuine concern for felons qua felons, your energies are better directed elsewhere. There are people more deserving of your efforts and more in need of "empowerment."  More thoughts on the matter at  urlLink NRO .

      Sometimes he makes it  urlLink just too damn easy :  Reductio ad absurdum is a childish game. The fact that a minimum wage of $100/hour is ridiculous doesn't mean that a minimum wage of $7/hour is ridiculous. This is why God gave us brains: to make judgments about how far to take things and how to balance competing interests against each other. Insisting on a minimum level of habitability is partly an economic decision — which explains why color TVs aren't mandated — but partly a matter of both convenience and simple human decency — which explains why hot water and lack of cockroaches are. I'm really tired of reductio arguments.   urlLink Reductio ad absurdum  is not a childish game, moron --   it's a rule of logic  ! Obviously that's news to you, since you apparently don't know what the concept means. Neither your minimum wage nor habitability examples are even in the same solar system as true reductio arguments. Slippery slope arguments, perhaps -- but reductio? I'd hate to think what your Logic 101 grade was in college.  Here's a reductio ad absurdum argument, Kevster...pay attention: 1. You favor raising the minimum wage. 2. You want to help low-skilled workers. 3. Raising the minimum wage laws raises unemployment among low-skilled workers. 4. Therefore you oppose raising the minimum wage.  #1 is the opposite of #4, an impossibility. Since #3 is an axiom, you must abandon either #1 or #2. Assuming you want to hold #2 fixed, the only possible solution is to abandon #1.  Yes, Kevster, I can see why   you   are tired of reductio arguments. But they suit me just fine, thank you very much...

      The online casino industry is  urlLink fighting back  against abusive and intrusive government tactics:    The operator of a gambling news site on the Internet has asked a federal judge to declare that advertisements in U.S. media for foreign online casinos and sports betting outlets are protected by free-speech rights.  The suit, filed by Louisiana-based Casino City Inc. in Baton Rouge federal court, challenges subpoenas sent by the Justice Department to media outlets for records dealing with the purchase of ads for offshore gambling sites.  Online casinos and sports betting books are not legal in the United States, but operations in locales such as the Caribbean have sprung up widely in recent years with U.S. residents making bets through credit card transactions.  The suit by Casino City, which operates a Web site featuring news about casinos and sports books but does not offer wagering, contends that the Justice Department action has "had a chilling effect upon free speech." The government action also caused The History Channel to cancel a promotional collaboration with Casino City, CEO Michael Corfman said.  The issue is a potentially difficult one given the current state of the law. The knee-jerk reaction would be to point to   urlLink Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association v. United States  , which held that advertising bans against "  legal  " gambling violated First Amendment freedom of speech protections.  In that case, a federal law banning gambling advertisements on television and radio was held unconstitutional given that there were "too many loopholes" (Indian gaming, bingo, etc.). On the one hand, extending the reasoning from TV to the Internet should be no big deal. The problem, however, is whether   online gaming   is "legal" (or, as Clinton would say, it depends on what your definition of "legal" is).  Assuming that the online casinos and sport books are operating legally   with respect to their domicile   (e.g., Australia or the Cayman Islands), shouldn't they then be allowed to advertise in the United States, even though it is illegal?  My libertarian response is of course: why not?  Why shouldn't someone be allowed to advertise in the U.S.   for activities outside the U.S.   that, although proscribed here, are legal there? Some analogies: Can New York State ban ads for a (legal) brothel in Nevada just because prostitution is illegal in New York? Should the  New York Times  Travel section face prosecution if it accepted an ad from an Amsterdam coffeehouse? Or what if Anheuser-Busch runs a Budweiser commercial on MTV, a station watched almost exclusively by people under the legal drinking age?  Oh, but the online gambling "occurs" within the United States, one might counter? I'm not entirely sure that's accurate. If I play online blackjack for money, is the "play" occurring on my PC in Manhattan, or in a server in Sydney? Both? And what about the financial aspect -- if my credit card is billed in Bermuda, isn't that where the activity is "occurring"?  And besides, pay close attention to the posture of this litigation -- the authorities are   not   going after the online casinos themselves, but rather   the media   that might be accepting their ads. That's just like the sleazy tactic of subpoenaing an electric utility's billing records to troll for those who might be using "too much" electricity for, say, heat lamps to grow indoor marijuana.  A basic but often forgotten principle of  urlLink Fourth Amendment  jurisprudence is that the government should not be allowed,   via its subpoena power  , to go on broad "fishing expeditions" without individualized suspicion, looking for clues that might undercover some random wrongdoing somewhere.  Unfortunately that principle is not always honored, but in this case it most certainly should be.

      The good folks at  urlLink Catallarchy  point to yet  urlLink another eminent domain outrage , this time in Toledo:  The City of Toledo is giving a small auto-repair shop until midnight to vacate property at the edge of DaimlerChrysler AG's Jeep plant so one of the town's biggest employers can have more space around its sprawling facility and build a new entrance for trucks.  The land, once owned by Kim and Herman Blankenship for Kim's Auto &amp; Truck Service Inc., is being seized by the city under eminent domain and turned over to DaimlerChrysler for economic development. ... But the case has become part of a larger, growing controversy about how much power the government should have to seize private property for other private users -- especially for corporations seeking economic development aid -- and the appeal goes to the federal court on the heels of an important Michigan Supreme Court decision that favored private land owners. ... In July,  urlLink the Michigan Supreme Court reversed  its landmark 1981  Poletown  decision, in which the court allowed private property to be seized so General Motors Corp. could build a factory. ... On Aug. 4, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to allow the Blankenships to remain at the property while it considers whether to hear their appeal. But the Blankenships' attorney, Terry Lodge, filed a motion for reconsideration on Friday,   citing the Poletown [reversal] decision  . ... The City of Toledo and an appellate court in Ohio heavily quoted the  Poletown  decision in rejecting the Blankenship's appeal, which followed a 2002 jury trial the Blankenships lost. ...But the City of Toledo's attorneys say the  Poletown  reversal does not affect their case. They noted that Michigan jurists reversed  Poletown  based on specific provisions of Michigan's 1963 constitution that are not present in the Ohio constitution...  Notice the obnoxious hypocrisy on the part of the city: quote  Poletown  out the wazoo when it helps you, but then trivialize it after it's been overturned.  The fact that there are two different state constitutions at issue in these two cases could become irrelevant if the U.S. Supreme Court were to adopt the  Hathcock  reasoning as a Fifth Amendment eminent domain doctrine (which would then apply to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment).  The notion that "a greater private use" can be repackaged as "a public use" is to destroy the distinction between public and private. As I observed in another post: Who exactly will get to decide whether a "net economic benefit" is positive or negative? To whom? By what metrics? Over what geographic area? Over what period of time? A fundamental Constitutional protection devolves into the Politics of Pull and the Jurisprudence of "Size Matters."  If I understand Supreme Court procedures (and politics) correctly, then my guess is that the motion for reconsideration will be denied (there's no real basis for the Court to revisit an Ohio decision based on a new Michigan precedent). But if the " Poletown  is wrong" meme has legs, then eventually either a vertical appeal or a split among the circuits will give the Supreme Court an opportunity to nationalize  Hathcock  and restore some sanity to modern property rights.  Stay tuned...  Meanwhile, I have posts on the  Hathcock  decision overturning  Poletown   urlLink here  and  urlLink here .   SIDEBAR:  Interestingly, the Blankenships are being helped by none other than Ralph Nader, one of the worst enemies of property rights in American history. The enemy of my enemy...

       urlLink Diamond  threatened to sue me if I didn't post  urlLink this :  For the first time in Canada, a court has ordered a man to give his ex-wife monthly support payments for their dog.  Kenneth Duncan, a truck driver in Edmonton, was told to pay $200 a month in alimony towards the upkeep of Crunchy, a St. Bernard. ... Had Crunchy been a child, the monthly payment would have been $691, based on Duncan's annual salary of $84,000.  The court also ordered Duncan to make a retroactive payment of $2,000, and did not give him visiting rights.  It's the first time a Canadian court has elevated a pet above chattel status in divorce proceedings. Normally, pets are ranked with furniture and non-living household property, and given a lesser value.  But U.S. courts are increasingly ruling pets are more akin to children. American judges have begun to rule on joint custody, visitation rights and support payments.  I'm not going to think too hard about this, but it seems to me that the property settlement could have included an endowment to cover the net present value of the estimated expenses of the dog over time. Why hyperbolize (is that a word?) the issue by calling it "dog alimony"? (Even for   real   alimony, some if not all jurisdictions allow the spouses to substitute a lump sum based on the NPV of the cash flows.)  I do agree, however, with the general idea that pets should be "de-chatteled" in certain contexts, including visitation in divorces and emotional distress torts (e.g., if someone maliciously harms or kills another's pet, the civil remedies should not be limited to the "fair market value" of the animal via a trespass to chattels action).

      The "vending machines in schools" hysteria  urlLink jumps to Utah :  The Utah Department of Health wants to find out if school districts are justified in their fears that offering pupils only healthy snacks will cut into their vending-machine revenue.  It is asking some school districts to compare sales from an all-healthy fare machine to that of traditional machine snacks... ... The data concern some Utah officials. And some are turning their sights on vending machines. The state Board of Education urges schools to offer   long enough lunch times   so students won't forego long meal lines for easy-access machine snacks. ... Vending-machine revenues bring hundreds of thousands of dollars to schools trying to get by on   the lowest per-pupil spending in the nation   and efforts to regulate the sales have met strong opposition from most districts. However, some districts are acting on their own.  The Wasatch School District is the first in the state to limit vending machine and classroom sweets. It now requires 70 percent of student vending machine fare - allowed only in the junior high and high school - to be   water  , milk, 100 percent fruit juices and foods meeting district minimum nutritional standards.  Some hasty stitches:   Any vending machine law or regulation that claims to be motivated by health concerns, yet allows whole milk while banning diet soda, is a   vicious   fraud  . See generally, " urlLink Senator Pat Leahy ."     Kids have to be given   longer lunch hours   as an enticement to actually eat lunch? Is this an AP story or something out of " urlLink The Onion "?     Not to get all liberal or anything, but if Utah is so concerned about kids, maybe they shouldn't have the lowest per-pupil spending in the country.     Along the same lines, why exactly do students, while in school, have to get their   water   from a vending machine? Mormons can't drink from fountains?   The politics of the warm fuzzy feeling (a.k.a., the "'Do Something!' Doctrine") strikes again.   (Cross-linked with   urlLink  Outside the Beltway   .)

      I have  urlLink posted before  on how the best way to scrap the Electoral College is not to scrap it at all, but rather to amend it to the  urlLink District Method  of allocating electoral votes.  In that post, I said the following.  On a state-by-state basis, perhaps there will some movement away from all-or-nothing electoral awards. But expect any change to be at glacier speed.  Well, turns out  urlLink those glaciers move pretty dang fast :  A state plan to scrap the winner-take-all system of allocating electoral votes in Colorado is heading to the ballot in November. If passed, Amendment 36 would make Colorado the first state to allocate electoral votes proportionately according to the popular vote, rather than giving a winner all of the state's electoral votes.  Of course, purely proportional allocation is not entirely the same (and has more potential problems) than the District Method. But it's unquestionably better than all-or-nothing electoral voting.  It will be interesting to see how the Amendment 36 campaign plays out (i.e., the arguments made for and against it). And if it indeed passes, then we'll have to wait and see whether it has any legs.

      A follow-up, courtesy of  urlLink Wired , to  urlLink a prescient post I made  early in the blog:   RealNetworks will slash its song and album prices in half Tuesday in an attempt to lure music fans to buy its music downloads, which play on a slew of portable music players, including Apple iPods.  At 50 cents a song and $5 an album, the prices are the lowest yet offered by a mainstream digital music service. The bargain prices will last for "multiple weeks," according to Dan Sheeran, a senior vice president at RealNetworks.  Real's promotion is the latest volley by the company to pressure Apple Computer into opening up its music format to interoperate with other players. Several weeks ago, Real unveiled its Harmony technology, which allows music bought from Real to be played on more than 100 different portable players, including Apple's iPod. ... Apple said it was "stunned" by Real's Harmony product when it was announced and said it was investigating the company's actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other laws.   Question:  Can an industry actually compete itself into financial distress and even collective bankruptcy, despite huge, and to some extent inelastic, demand for its product?   Answer:  The airlines seem to be heading in that direction.  Could the MP3 (and MP3-Player) providers follow suit?  The comparison is startling: An industry comprising a few huge companies (plus a gaggle of statistically insignificant upstarts), but who provide a massively diverse product selection (routes for the airlines, songs/albums/artists for the MP3 companies). Throw in some regulatory issues for flavor (security for the airlines, intellectual property for Apple &amp; Real), have the market shaken up a bit (the decimation of corporate travel for the airlines, code-cracking for the MP3 companies) and suddenly you've got an intriguing case study.  Of course, the airlines can't, either individually or collectively, operate at a loss forever (at least not without government subsidies, but that's a whole other blog post). The current equilibrium is not stable.  Similarly, I've read that iTunes is actually a loss leader for Apple (or soon will be) and that the real (no pun intended) money lies with the iPod itself. But if Real (and eventually others) undercut iTunes at the knees (i.e., makes it even   more   of a loss leader for Apple), then the business model, both for Apple and for the entire industry, could become unstable and non-viable.  However, in the meantime, we iPod owners enjoy the benefit of cheaper music from multiple sources.  And the  Band  iPod played on...

       urlLink The topic : students in charter schools don't seem to do any better than mainstream students on standardized tests:  As it happens, I don't have any special axe to grind when it comes to charter schools — I've vaguely felt for a while that they showed some promise and were worth experimenting with — and I have mixed feelings as well about our current mania for high stakes testing. But George Bush has mixed feelings about neither of these things and has repeatedly insisted that both schools and educational programs in general should be judged on scientific evidence.  Except, apparently, when that evidence is unfavorable to his ideological worldview — which is pretty much the story for this entire administration, isn't it? They know what they want, and facts on the ground just don't change their minds.  Just one problem, Kevin --   charter schools, per se, are not a central part of Bush's education plan  .  Here's what the  urlLink Bush website  really says:  The President has also requested funding in his budgets for a Choice Incentive Fund, which would support efforts to provide parents, particularly low-income parents, of students who attend low-performing schools with opportunities to transfer their children to higher-performing   public, charter, or private schools  .  That   is     not   the same as saying "I believe unconditionally that charter schools (which are not necessarily private) are better than traditional public schools." It   is   the same as saying: break the chokehold of the teachers unions and local bureaucracies and give parents a fighting chance at a decent education for their kids.  And Kevin's "ideological worldview" (his term) apparently makes him have a problem with that.

      A while back  urlLink we all celebrated  the downfall of the  Poletown  doctrine of eminent domain in Michigan (i.e., the monstrous notion that  urlLink the Constitution's  "public use" requirement for public taking of private late could be satisfied solely on some perceived "net economic benefit to the community" rather than a bona fide public structure).  But what about  urlLink this example  of what could be called the " Reverse-Poletown Doctrine "?    The Los Angeles City Council is trying a new tactic in the escalating battle over building or banning the new jumbo-sized Wal-Mart stores. Rather than blocking superstores outright, as some council members originally proposed -- a move that Wal-Mart could challenge in court or angry bargain hunters could overturn at the ballot box -- the council passed a hairsplitting law last week.   It bars construction of retail-and-grocery superstores if a newly required analysis finds that they will harm a neighborhood economically more than help it.    Isn't this the  urlLink bearded-Spock  parallel universe equivalent of  Poletown ? Aggressive zoning generally, targeted zoning against a particular company, environmental impact statements, etc., are all bad enough. But to require a property owner to in essence "win back" his property rights  a priori  by having to prove a negative (i.e., no net economic harm) is exactly the same kind of perverse reasoning that was just soundly rejected in  Wayne County v. Hathcock , the Michigan case that overturned  Poletown . "Heads, we win -- tails, you lose."  Who exactly in Los Angeles will get to decide whether the "net economic benefit" is positive or negative? To whom? By what metrics? Over what geographic area? Over what period of time?  Wal-Mart should challenge the Los Angeles ordinance and should argue the  Poletown  refutation as an analogy. There is a limit, which we now see after  Poletown , to how far government should be allowed to say "It's your property, but only in the ways we want it to be."  More praise of  Poletown's  demise at  urlLink Hit & Run ,  urlLink Reason  and  urlLink Freespace .   UPDATE:  Read about another Poletown-style disgrace  urlLink here .

      Martin Feldstein absolutely slaughters John Kerry on Social Security in today's  urlLink Wall Street Journal  (subscription site -- sorry; will try to link to OpinionJournal when available):  Mr. Kerry has said that he would consider "making sure that high-income beneficiaries don't get more out than they pay in" as taxes during their working years.   In practice, the Kerry plan would mean cutting Social Security benefits by about 80% for those whose benefits are reduced.   ... Mr. Kerry has not said which "high income" retirees would be hit by these drastic cuts. If it is limited to the same top 3% of income earners as the $200,000-plus group that Mr. Kerry has targeted for an income tax increase, the number of individuals and the cut in total Social Security outlays would be very small. Even the 80% cut in benefits for that group would reduce total Social Security outlays by less than 5%.   A benefit cut targeted in that way would be more of a gesture against high earners than a serious attempt to reduce Social Security's fiscal shortfall.    It would, moreover, be unfair to cut the benefits by 80% for someone who earns $200,000 and not to cut the benefits of someone who makes only slightly less. What logic could there be to cutting the benefits of those who had preretirement incomes over $200,000 to $4,100 a year while still paying benefits of $22,000 a year to someone with a pre-retirement income of $190,000? ... The Kerry Web site also emphasizes that "current law revenues would be sufficient to pay 73% of scheduled benefits after trust fund exhaustion in 2042." So   is Mr. Kerry willing to accept an expected benefit cut of 27% for all future retirees  ?  If that's the plan, it would be good for younger workers to know. And those who may be in line for drastic cuts in the near term would also welcome some clarification from Mr. Kerry.  "Clarification"? How about some abject apologies and some honest discussion about privatization?  I broke the story about the Kerry "rich get no more than they put in" outrage  urlLink here  about three weeks ago. My bookie is taking bets for how long it will take for the soak-the-rich proposal to vanish from the Kerry website.  Meanwhile, I have other Social Security posts  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

      The Chicago Sun-Times has  urlLink an editorial  today bemoaning the various accidental releases by the court of the accuser's name.  Shoddy clerical mistakes, which ended up on a Court TV Web page for the world to see. There has been one faux pas after another in this case that has capsized the whole idea of victim confidentiality. In June, a full transcript of a closed-door hearing was mistakenly sent to news groups. The trial judge, Terry Ruckriegle, then had to order a ban on publication. Ruckriegle has apologized to the woman for allowing sealed court documents to be leaked. "I have learned lessons from these mistakes, and . . . we will give our best human effort not to let it happen again," he said. But his mea culpa on behalf of court staff does not make it better for the poor woman who expected a fair trial in his court.  Okay fine, courts shouldn't screw up like that, but it's interesting that the editorial completely glosses over (just one sentence concealed at the end of a stray paragraph) the fact that the accuser, who supposedly is concerned with her privacy, is not concerned enough to abstain from filing a civil lawsuit against Bryant, and in the process is making a mockery of due process in the civil litigation by requesting "Jane Doe" status. See  urlLink my previous post  on the subject.  Rape shield laws may very well have a place (I'm dubious) in the criminal context. But if the purported victim is willing to reduce her (or his) suffering to a dollar amount, then how can they simultaneously declare that their privacy is somehow sacrosanct?  The civil court court should immediately deny the accuser's petition to sue anonymously. The double-standard is an affront to the law and cannot in any way be justified.

      Today's  urlLink Drum  nonsense:   BUSH HATERS....Jonah Goldberg, in the middle of a post about Clinton haters and the people who hate them, says this:  The Bush-haters — who are just as extreme and nasty as the Clinton-haters were, and in many ways more so....  Tell you what, Jonah. As soon as the most popular liberal editorial page in the country accuses George Bush of murdering one of his aides, maybe I'll give your argument a hearing. And as soon as one of the most influential liberal interest groups in the country starts distributing hundreds of thousands of videos suggesting that George Bush ran a coke ring out of Austin, then I'll really perk up. And when Senate Democrats spend $70 million investigating the Valerie Plame affair — compared to the current $0 — and end up bringing impeachment charges against George Bush, then you'll have me. You'll really have me.  I'm sorry Kevin, but I missed the whole "Plame gives Bush a blowjob in the Oval Office" thread out of my RSS feed. Guess that whole "disgrace the office" stuff the pervert did doesn't "have" you.  Why should it?  Perhaps you and Slick Willie can be summed up by the expression "great minds think alike" (or perhaps that should be "grate minds...").

      The good folks at  urlLink Catallarchy  beat me to blogging about a curious question:  Why does Puerto Rico have an Olympic team?  Last time I checked,  urlLink Puerto Rico  was part of the United States -- specifically, it has "commonwealth status."  Same thing for  urlLink American Samoa  ("protectorate status"), and apparently (website is very old) for the  urlLink Northern Marianas Islands  ("commonwealth status"), which also have teams.  What's next -- the Guantanamo Detainee Olympic Team?   SIDEBAR:  A little googling uncovered something interesting: I knew that Puerto Ricans are United States citizens, but it turns out American Samoans are not -- instead they're United States "  nationals  ," which is somehow different.  Of course, as for the Olympics, the whole Puerto Rico thing is a publicity maneuver (think "basketball"), as is the whole ridiculous sham of allowing professionals to play at all.  But this is as good a time as any to revisit the whole loopy Puerto Rico situation. I always find it amazing how loudly (and I'm in NYC, so I mean   loudly  ), Puerto Ricans walk the walk when it comes to questions of pride and culture, and even of independence from the U.S., but they never seem to walk the walk whenever there's a referendum on the matter in the homeland (the last such referendum was in 1998).  I guess being a recipient of unspeakably massive amounts of mainland tax dollars, not to mention the ability to issue tax-advantaged municipal bonds, has its  addictions  advantages.  UPDATE:  urlLink Outside the Beltway  has some info on the IOC's reasoning. I'm not impressed. And I apologize for overlooking Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

      An update to  urlLink my earlier post  on how the current airline pension crisis may be a preview of what is coming for Social Security, courtesy of the  Wall Street Journal  (subscription site -- sorry):   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, the quasi-governmental pension insurer, said in a limited objection Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Chicago that the United Airlines parent is attempting through a private agreement with its lenders to "effect an end-run around federal-pension law." UAL, citing the agreement, has said it will no longer contribute to the plans while under bankruptcy protection, raising fears that it will abandon them. Also, Friday, the PBGC raised its estimate of the four pension plans' combined underfunding to $8.3 billion, from last year's estimate of a $7.5 billion shortfall. ... The PBGC separately Friday said that if UAL terminates the plans -- which would require the permission of the bankruptcy judge and the PBGC -- it would be on the hook for $6.4 billion. The difference between $8.3 billion and $6.4 billion represents the benefits that UAL's 120,000 workers and retirees would lose because they exceed the guarantee limits set by Congress.  The similarities with where Social Security is heading are intriguing (and depressing):  First, we see the general government fund (here the PBGC) picking up the tab when the dedicated pension fund fails -- exactly what will happen when Social Security becomes cash flow negative. (Always remember --   there is no "lockbox"  ...there are only paper promises to divert general federal revenues -- a.k.a., income taxes -- to Social Security, which was supposed to be fully funded by FICA taxes. So much for a "healthy" system.)  Second, we see, in the blink of an eye, the forecast of the future of the system changed (for the worse) by a substantial amount. One minute the airline pension shortfall is $7.5 billion, the next it's over 10% greater. Just like how the Social Security Administration (not to mention the  urlLink Forces of Darkness ) relentlessly claim, as though there is any reliability to the calculations, that it is absolutely certain that Social Security is absolutely safe for however many years, until -- presto-chango -- suddenly the outlook is no longer quite as sanguine as before.  Third, we see supposedly "safe" benefits (i.e, the $1.9 billion not guaranteed by PBGC) suddenly at risk, because there are in fact no dedicated funds to pay them -- only the hope that future inflows will continue in sufficient amounts. If not, well, too bad so sad... Meanwhile, Social Security sends every one of us a bromide report each and every year telling us how much we're "promised" and at what age, fully aware that those "guaranteed" benefits are anything but.  They tell us not to worry. I'll stop worrying when  urlLink pigs stop flying .  More on Social Security  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .   UPDATE:  The  urlLink New York Times  reports this morning that much the same is occurring in the coal mining industry:  And now comes a fresh blow for more than 3,000 unionized miners who will lose their health care and retirement benefits under a federal judge's ruling that it is not necessary for their troubled employer to honor its contract guarantees. ...[T]he bankruptcy judge, William Howard, found that he was well within existing law and might even save jobs if the mines can be sold and kept open in some fashion. Thus does bankruptcy law trump miners' supposedly guaranteed, doubtlessly hard-earned benefits.  The operative word: "supposedly."  Once the Social Security crisis matures into full bloom, the miners won't be the only ones getting the shaft.

      If nothing else good comes from the Iraq War (and much will), then at least we have  urlLink this :  President Bush has decided to bring home tens of thousands of U.S. troops from posts around the world - most of them in Europe and Asia - plus 100,000 of their family members and support personnel, U.S. officials said Saturday.  The changes will have no effect on forces in Iraq or Afghanistan. ... As part of the largest troop realignment in years, Bush will shift about 70,000 uniformed military personnel, most of them currently in Europe, the senior officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A significant proportion will come home, though it was not clear when.  U.S. armed forces stationed aboard, other than Iraq and Afghanistan, now number about 200,000, of whom 100,000 are based in Europe.  Long overdue. Have some  bratwurst  hot dogs and  Spaten  Budweiser to celebrate  And a sidebar to the world: Be careful what you wish for...you just may get it.

      The good folks at  urlLink Tongued Tied  sniffed out  urlLink this  in the New York Times:  20th Century Fox is planning a release next year for "Kingdom of Heaven," a $130 million production by the Oscar-nominated director Ridley Scott, shot in Morocco with hundreds of extras, horses and elaborate costumes. The script, by William Monahan, is based on real characters of the three-century Crusades, including Balian of Ibelin, a Crusader knight who led the defense of Jerusalem in 1187, and the Muslim leader  urlLink Saladin , who defeated him. ... The Rev. George Dennis, a Jesuit priest and a history professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, who was one of five experts provided with the script for "Kingdom of Heaven," said he was impressed by its nuance and accuracy. "Historically I found it pretty accurate," he said. "I can't think of any objections from the Christian side. And I don't think Muslims should have any objections. There's nothing offensive to anyone in there, I don't think."  But Khaled Abu el-Fadl, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies Islamic law, vehemently disagreed, calling the screenplay offensive and a replay of historic Hollywood stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims.  "I believe this movie teaches people to hate Muslims," he said. "There is a stereotype of the Muslim as constantly stupid, retarded, backward, unable to think in complex forms. It's really annoying at an intellectual level, and it really misrepresents history on many levels."  The two university scholars who read the script did not agree on its historical accuracy. Father George said that the 12th-century Crusader state was, as shown in the film, relatively tolerant, and that Saladin did in fact order his troops to give no quarter in the fighting in Jerusalem, an order he later rescinded.  But Mr. Fadl said the Crusader state was by its nature discriminatory and oppressive of other religions.  So let's review: it's okay to make movies about  urlLink English slaughtering Scots ,  urlLink English slaughtering Americans ,  urlLink English slaughtering Indians ,  urlLink Romans slaughtering Hebrews ,  urlLink Americans slaughtering each other ,  urlLink Japanese slaughtering each other ,  urlLink Germans slaughtering Russians , etc., etc., etc. ... but make what appears to be an accurate portrayal of Christians and Muslims slaughtering each other (over 800 years ago!), and lo and behold ... anti-Muslim bigotry.  Did Professor el-Fadl ever stop to think that the movie might actually teach people to   understand   Muslims, instead of   hate   them? Or is possible, just possible, that  urlLink understanding Muslims  might not help their cause for acceptance?  Just thinking out loud...

      And you thought IRS audits were scary nightmares:  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been questioning political demonstrators across the country, and in rare cases even subpoenaing them, in an aggressive effort to forestall what officials say could be violent and disruptive protests at the Republican National Convention in New York.  F.B.I. officials are urging agents to canvass their communities for information about planned disruptions aimed at the convention and other coming political events, and they say they have developed a list of people who they think may have information about possible violence. They say the inquiries, which began last month before the Democratic convention in Boston, are focused solely on possible crimes, not dissent, at major political events.  But some people contacted by the F.B.I. say they are mystified by the bureau's interest and felt harassed by questions about their political plans.  "The message I took from it," said Sarah Bardwell, 21, an intern at a Denver antiwar group who was visited by six investigators a few weeks ago, "was that they were trying to intimidate us into not going to any protests and to let us know that, 'hey, we're watching you.'" ... In an internal complaint, an F.B.I. employee charged that the bulletins improperly blurred the line between lawfully protected speech and illegal activity. But the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, in a five-page internal analysis obtained by The New York Times, disagreed. ... The opinion said: "Given the limited nature of such public monitoring, any possible 'chilling' effect caused by the bulletins would be quite minimal and substantially outweighed by the public interest in maintaining safety and order during large-scale demonstrations."  Oh really? Heck, I'm nervous just blogging about it.

      What is it about  urlLink Dahlia Lithwick  that makes her repeatedly come close to a great idea and then suddenly drop the ball?  There is probably nothing I can do or say to convince you that the words "activist judge" have no more meaning than the words "hectic smurlbats." You've heard "activist judges" so many times - from the president, from Congress, from the angry guys on the radio - that you can define it right along with me.  Together then: Liberal activist judges make law, as opposed to interpreting it. They ignore the plain meaning of texts to invent new rights. Superimposing their moral views onto their legal reasoning, they brazenly advance the cause of the fringe liberal elites in the culture wars. That certainly sounds right. Justice Antonin Scalia would say it better, of course. He'd make reference to the framers and toss in words like  kulturkampf .  The sarcasm seems well-placed so far.  Re-activist judges are able to present themselves as "strict constructionists" or "originalists" by arguing, as does Justice Clarence Thomas, that any case decided wrongly (i.e., not in accordance with the framers of the Constitution) should simply be erased, as though erasure is somehow a passive act.  Not quite.  The "strict constructionism" and "original intent" theories of statutory interpretation are, basically,   total opposites   and not two different ways of saying the same thing.  Here's a classic example of the rather stark difference between "strict constructionism" and "original intent":  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  Now, if you're a "strict constructionist," then these words say what they mean and mean what they say, and the draft is unconstitutional. End of discussion.  But if you're an "original intent" theorist, then you ask not what the words   mean  , but what they   meant  . Then you get to dance around the "strict construction" of the Thirteenth Amendment by arguing that the drafters and ratifiers were only talking about slavery., .  Now of course sometimes you simply have to do at least   some   interpretation -- what exactly is " urlLink interstate commerce " or an " urlLink unreasonable search "? Then the debate should be between: (a) the plain meaning of the text, (b) the original intent (in a modern context), or (c) the meaning as developed over time via precedent and scholarship. A very libertarian judge,  urlLink Richard Posner , describes this process as "gap-filling."  But such debates rarely align perfectly along liberal-conservative (or libertarian-statist) partitions. The simple, and perhaps cynical, answer is that you argue whichever school of interpretation helps your position, selectively choosing and ignoring source material as best suits your needs.  Lithwick is dead-on accurate when she exposes the hypocrisy of, say, Justice Scalia (or his ideologically conjoined twin, Robert Bork, who called part of the Bill of Rights an " urlLink inkblot on the Constitution ") -- such jurists cannot possibly be called "strict constructionists" with a straight face.  I've long argued that it is almost always best for libertarians to argue   true   strict constructionism, since most of the constitution   limits the actions of government   and most "interpretation," both from liberals and conservatives, tries to get around that "nuisance."  It would be unfortunate for lay libertarians to become confused by mislabeled legal theories such as "strict construction" and "original intent" applied too casually to those who oppose libertarian policies.

      A new feature here at  A Stitch in Haste : "Daily Drum Beating," where I respond to whichever  urlLink Kevin Drum nonsense  suits my fancy at the moment.   urlLink Today's entry :  FREE TRADE....Today's headline in the Los Angeles Times:   urlLink Bush, Kerry Are Worlds Apart on Trade Issues   I guess that's right. On one side we've got a guy who talks a bit of campaign trail smack about "fair trade" but has a long history of supporting free trade when it counts.

So Kerry "has a long history of supporting free trade when it counts"? Care to back that up? And when exactly   doesn't   it count? Is Drum saying Kerry gets to  lie , um,  distort the truth , um,  flip-flop , um, revise his views ( yeah, that one! ) based on changing circumstances, without any accountability?

      First there was  urlLink this :  Two NBC News staffers were arrested Wednesday at St. Louis Downtown Airport when they attempted to demonstrate whether a terrorist could rent a helicopter.  The New York producer and cameraman portrayed themselves as tourists who wanted to rent a charter helicopter to visit sites such as the Arch, airport director Bob McDaniel said.  Arleane Thomas, vice president of Fostaire Helicopters at the airport, called the police after the two NBC staffers tried to rent a helicopter using driver's licenses from two different states, and then tried to pay cash for the sessions, which cost between $750-$875 per hour.  Sauget Police officers and FBI agents responded moments after Thomas made the call and the two NBC employees were taken into custody. Officers searched their belongings and discovered a box cutter, a butane lighter, maps and a white powder which turned out to be baby powder.  Now  urlLink this :  The Sunday Mirror claims an undercover reporter was able to get a job at the main stadium without proper vetting.  The paper claims the reporter worked at the venue until the opening ceremony. It says he planted three suspicious packages within the stadium which were not detected by security sweeps. The paper says the parcels contained material for three mock bombs, including plasticine, batteries and wire. ... It also says their reporter was able to stand within 20 metres of Prime Minister Tony Blair and other dignitaries at the opening ceremony of the Games on Friday.  Now of course American laws do not apply in Athens, but the legal (and moral) theory is the same:   "Freedom of the press" does NOT entitle any journalist or media entity to break the law.    How difficult a concept should this be?  This is not new news (no pun intended). We went through this debate back in 1997 with the  urlLink Food Lion  case. Although the punitive damages award against ABC (which lied, cheated and stole its way into the supermarket chain) were later (wrongfully) overturned on appeal, the fact that ABC broke the law and that Food Lion was in fact entitled to compensation was reiterated.  As  urlLink one commentator  succinctly summarized the issue:  A trespass action is a fairly simple matter. Any unauthorized entry onto another's property constitutes trespass. Perhaps the most basic right enjoyed by owners of real property is the right of exclusive use of the realty. According to one legal treatise, the right to physically exclude others is "the most nearly absolute of the many property rights that flow from the ownership" of land. Trespass laws protect every property owner's freedom of association by denying access to unwelcome visitors.   Using false pretenses (i.e., lying) to gain access to someone else's property is trespass, and it's illegal. End of discussion.  And the two current incidents are far worse than the fact pattern in Food Lion (which was in fact engaging in some pretty outrageous and disgusting practices). No one had any reason to suspect the helicopter company in St. Louis or the Olympics security staff in Athens. ABC may have tripped and stumbled over the ethical and legal line in the Food Lion incident (I'm being generous); the journalists in the current incidents refuse to acknowledge that the line even exists.  I hope it doesn't get to the point where we have to start locking up journalists for criminal trespass, criminal fraud, filing false reports, etc. But the seemingly increasing drive by the media to create a story where none exists, or to go on fishing expeditions with no regard for privacy or property, and then to cower behind the First Amendment, is too dangerous to ignore.

      The  urlLink Washington Times  reports that the White House is rightfully mopping the floor with John Kerry over the whole September 11 "seven minutes reading to children" folderol (started, you might recall, by  urlLink Michael Moore ):  White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett took Mr. Kerry to task for questioning the president's decision to remain in a Florida classroom for five minutes after learning of the attacks. ... But last month, the senator acknowledged his own struggle to comprehend the enormity of the terrorist attacks. Mr. Kerry was attending a Democratic leadership meeting in the Capitol office of Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota when two jetliners slammed into the World Trade Center in New York.  "We watched the second plane come into the building," Mr. Kerry said on "Larry King Live." "And we shortly thereafter sat down at the table and then   we just realized nobody could think  , and then boom, right behind us, we saw the cloud of explosion at the Pentagon. "And then word came from the White House they were evacuating, and we were to evacuate," he added. "And so we immediately began the evacuation."  By that time, Mr. Bush had been responding to the attacks for more than 20 minutes and had addressed the nation.  This relates back to something I'm been wondering about regarding  urlLink the McGreevey scandal :   Just how dumb are our politicians becoming these days?    For example, given everything that has developed with  urlLink Kerry's Vietnam service , shouldn't Kerry, or his handlers, in retrospect have circled back and said "Well, gee maybe we shouldn't keep harping on Vietnam -- perhaps this and that and the other might resurface."  By the same token, didn't Kerry, or his advisors, stop and think, "Well, what was I doing at that moment and how did I react?" (or better yet, "What I am   on the record   as having said I was doing at that moment?")?  Of course campaigns are grueling, candidates tire and the cameras are always on and some quantum of spontaneity is mandatory. But good grief, how many more dumb things is Kerry going to say? (Recall: "I voted for it before I voted against it"..."foreign leaders want me"..."sensitive war," etc.)  Maybe this is why senators make such lousy presidential candidates...they're so used to prepared remarks and timed exchanges and structural decorum that an open mike is an alien concept.

       urlLink Good Grief :   Alan Keyes said Friday he would like to end the system under which the people elect U.S. senators and return to pre-1913 practice in which senators were chosen by state legislatures.  The Republican Senate candidate in Illinois, asked about past comments on the election process, said the constitutional amendment that provided for popular election of senators upset the balance between the people and the states.  "The balance is utterly destroyed when the senators are directly elected because the state government as such no longer plays any role in the deliberations at the federal level," Keyes said...  He said it was one of the reasons "there has been a steady deleterious erosion of the sovereign role of the states."  For the record, the erosion of  urlLink states rights  can be traced more directly to the disregard, ab initio, of the  urlLink Tenth Amendment  (and the  urlLink Ninth  to a lesser extent), the Civil War, the refusal of the racist South to end segregation, and of course by the massive expansion of federal revenues (and therefore federal power) via the income tax.  Put more succinctly, Keyes is off by an Amendment -- he should look to the  urlLink Sixteenth  rather than the  urlLink Seventeenth  as a target for his ire.  But anyway, couldn't the Republicans have found someone -- anyone -- better than this fool?   UPDATE:   urlLink Oxblog  has another funny Keyes snippet.

Commissioned by an Act of Congress, signed by the President, the Memorial Monument will commemorate those who suffered and perished, will honor those who successfully resisted communist tyranny, will educate current and future generations about the winning of the Cold War, and will document communism's crimes against humanity.

      Was offline most of the day interviewing a potential  houseboi  intern. All the  urlLink hyperblogging  from Thursday also left me a little drained.  So I'm too tired to fully unleash my rage at the  urlLink New York Times , or the  urlLink Washington Post , or  urlLink Drum , over their incredulous and utterly pathetic spin over the CBO tax rate report.  The report, incidentally, is available  urlLink here  (PDF only). Please do read it. It's 29 pages, but it's a government report, so the actual readable page count is only about 20. Try zooming in to page 10, Table 2, "Effective Federal Tax Rates..." Your   effective   tax rate is simply the actual tax you paid divided by your actual pre-tax income (i.e., before contributions to IRAs, 401(k) and flexible spending accounts, and before exemptions and deductions).  I won't highlight any particular numbers -- there's little need. My point is this: pick a row, any row -- a quintile row, a "Top 1%" row, anything. Then read from left to right.  What do you see?    I don't see much of anything.   Notice how little   any   of the numbers is really changing, especially on the left-hand side of the table (i.e., the actual numbers for, say 2001-2003 and the near-term estimates for 2004 through maybe 2006). (The estimates beyond that are essentially meaningless, as are   all   long-term government economic forecasts.)  And by the way, if the middle class gets a tax cut and the high-income get a bigger tax cut, that is   NOT   "taking money from the middle class to give to the wealthy."  Using these pipsqueak changes, most of which are empty estimates anyway, to justify higher taxes, on the high-income or on anyone else for that matter, is not being "fair and equitable." It's  urlLink schadenfreude .  P.S. Do you really want to do something to help middle-class taxpayers? Scrap the Satan-spawned  urlLink Alternative Minimum Tax .   UPDATE:   urlLink NRO picks up this ball  and runs with it. Good stuff...

      The  urlLink California Supreme Court has voided  the roughly 4,000 gay marriage licenses issued by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and other local officials:  The California Supreme Court on Thursday voided the nearly 4,000 same-sex marriages sanctioned in San Francisco this year and ruled unanimously that the mayor overstepped his authority by issuing licenses to gay and lesbian couples.  The court said the city illegally issued the certificates and performed the ceremonies, since state law defined marriage as a union between a man and woman.  The justices separately decided with a 5-2 vote to nullify the 3,995 marriages peformed between Feb. 12 and March 11, when the court halted the weddings. Their legality, Justice Joyce Kennard wrote, must wait until courts resolve the constitutionality of state laws that restrict marriages to opposite-sex couples.  From  urlLink the opinion :  [A]lthough the present proceeding may be viewed by some as presenting primarily a question of the substantive legal rights of same-sex couples, in actuality the legal issue before us implicates the interest of all individuals in ensuring that public officials execute their official duties in a manner that respects the limits of the authority granted to them as officeholders. In short, the legal question at issue -- the scope of the authority entrusted to our public officials -- involves the determination of a fundamental question that lies at the heart of our political system: the role of the rule of law in a society that justly prides itself on being "a government of laws, and not of men" (or women).  The decision is absolutely correct, and the court is to be saluted. This case has nothing to do with the constitutionality or legality (or the morality or the wisdom) of California's same-sex marriage ban. It was   solely   about a renegade mayor playing benevolent dictator. He needed to be slapped down, and slapped down hard. He should probably be removed from office.  How exactly was Mayor Newsom behaving any different from, say,  urlLink Roy Moore ? How dare he unilaterally say, in essence, " urlLink The public be damned! "  A mayor is an   executive  , as in "execute" the laws. Not make them, not ignore them, not declare them unconstitutional. Especially   state   laws, when he is a local official.  I can put it in slightly different terms: If you're the mayor of San Francisco, or any other local executive, and you don't like a law, or think it's unconstitutional, and for reasons of conscience are unable to faithfully execute that law and are either unable or unwilling to change it through the normal legislative and judicial processes --   then resign!    Or would that be just a little too much publicity for Mayor Newsom?

      ..." urlLink SPECIAL HOLY F-CKING SH-T" EDITION !"   In a stunning declaration, Gov. James E. McGreevey announced his resignation Thursday and acknowledged that he had an extramarital affair with another man. "My truth is that I am a gay American," he said.  "Shamefully, I engaged in adult consensual affairs with another man, which violates my bonds of matrimony," the married father of two said. "It was wrong, it was foolish, it was inexecusable."  The Democrat said his resignation would be effective Nov. 15.  McGreevey said he would step down because his secret - both his sexuality and his affair - leaves the governor's office vulnerable.  urlLink BoiFromTroi  is collecting a nice bunch of reactions.  The hastiest of hasty stitches:  1. Kip's bookie lays 10-1 odds there was a specific blackmail threat facing McGreevey.  2. This may be harsh on McGreevey, but...If you're gay and you want to be a politician, then   get out of the closet!   I despise Barney Frank, but I despise hypocrite closet gay politicians far more.  3. On the other hand, let's keep his wife and kids in mind before the vitriol starts spewing forth.  4. Comparisons are being (rightfully) made between McGreevey, who (probably) should have resigned and did, and Bill Clinton, who (definitely) should have resigned and didn't. So much for the moral superiority of heterosexuals.  5. Could  urlLink The Corner , notorious for their spontaneity, do no better than fisking McGreevey's statement "My truth is that I'm a gay American" by focusing on the "my" and turning it into a nonsensical homophobic diatribe based on a supposed moral relativism? Pathetic.  6. Speaking of pathethic, check out  urlLink this jackhole's twisted logic : since McGreevey, like so many others, caved in to the relentless pressure to "be straight" by actually getting married and trying to "cure himself" of "these desires," and failed, twice, in the process, that proves...hocus-pocus alakazam!...that's he not really gay at all. It's all a ploy to reposition himself as a gay rights advocate, which apparently outranks "governor of a major state." And of course plenty of the aforementioned "vitriol" toward Mrs. McGreevey. Didn't take long at all for the worms to emerge from the compost heaps of the bigot-blogs.  7. More idiocy  urlLink here , namely that it was all a conspiracy by gay activists seeking retribution for McGreevey's opposition to gay marriage.  8. Am I the only one wondering whether  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  will cut short his month-long vacation (from writing or from blegging?) to comment on this or on  urlLink the California ruling .  If he doesn't, then he may run the risk of marginalizing himself even more than he already has been lately.   (Cross-linked at   urlLink  Outside the Beltway   .)

      From  urlLink NRO :  Where Islamic fundamentalists attack enemy populations, women and girls suffer even more. In Sudan in 1989, a coup installed the present military dictator Omar al Bashir, who declared Sudan to be an Islamic republic and imposed sharia (Islamic law). The Arab Islamist government intensified the long-standing conflict with the south by backing raids against the Christian and animist civilian populations. The raiders killed men and animals, burned villagers, and abducted women and children. Since 1983 — when the Sudan People's Liberation Army started the warfare that preceded Bashir's coup — an estimated 2 million people have been killed and 4.5 million people have become refugees and internally displaced persons. Two hundred thousand women and children have been captured for labor and sexual slavery. Some of the victims were trafficked into slavery and sexual servitude beyond northern Sudan to Middle Eastern countries.  Next people will be saying that communism was a "noble experiment"...oh, never mind.   Update:   urlLink More ...  A bomb exploded during an Independence Day parade in India's remote northeast on Sunday, killing at least 15 people, officials said, just an hour after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged to fight terrorism. The outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom was suspected of being behind the attack in Assam state and a second one later in the area, said Assam Inspector General of Police Khagen Sharma. Dilip Saikia, a local lawmaker, said 15 people were killed in the powerful blast in the grounds of a local college in Dhemaji, where the parade was being held.   Most of the dead were school children  ...

       urlLink Drum  has a short snide post today:  NAME CHANGE?.... urlLink Toys 'R' Us is thinking of abandoning the toy business.  If they did this, what would their new name be? 'R' Us?  Of course, in the real world this sort of thing isn't at all unusual -- the recent example of  urlLink Woolworth's reinventing itself as Foot Locker  comes to mind, as does the ancient example of  urlLink Cornelius Vanderbilt switching , "mid-stream" so to speak, from shipping to railroads. See also:  urlLink Blockbuster morphing into Netflix .    This is exactly what capitalism is all about  , and exactly what liberals and other anti-capitalists are so quick to ignore: Just because a company is successful today, just because it's making money hand over fist, just because it drives out weaker competitors, doesn't in any way exempt it from the laws of competition in the future.  Any successful business became successful by providing what people wanted, the way they wanted it and at a price they were willing to pay for it. But that was yesterday -- what about today and tomorrow? If a company stagnates, if it arrogantly presumes that it now need never innovate, reduce prices or otherwise compete with current, or potential, rivals, then failure is inevitable. On the price side, we're talking pure  urlLink Adam Smith ; on the innovation side it's Schumpeterian " urlLink creative destruction ."  (Of course, this doesn't apply whenever there is some form of government-granted barrier to entry, in which case we're not talking about capitalism anyway, but rather about statist racketeering.)  There has never,   not once  , been a naturally-arising, purely private, enduring, large-scale monopoly in the history of capitalism. Not the Dutch East India Company, not Standard Oil, not AT&amp;T, not Microsoft, not Wal-Mart...  ...and definitely not Toys 'R' Us.   (Cross-linked at   urlLink  Outside the Beltway   .)

      As a relatively new blogger, I'm still repeatedly surprised at how long it takes for some newspapers to catch up to the blogosphere on their Op-Ed pages. So rather than re-update all my posts, here is a summary from the past several days:   A  urlLink New York Times commentator  agrees with me that the Electoral College needs reforming, though he has a different (and inferior) solution to  urlLink my proposed District Method . Meanwhile,  urlLink Slate prefers the popular vote ...simple plans for simple minds.

The  urlLink Washington Post  agrees with me that  urlLink the state AGs who are suing over global warming  are full of hot air (I might say "full of" something else).     urlLink Spiked  debunks a U.K. survey claiming widespread opposition to genetically-modified foods, one of my favorite topics -- see  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .   urlLink Postrel  also comments on the possibility of  urlLink genetically-modified coffee ...I can't wait!     urlLink Hit &amp; Run  disagrees with me by needlessly getting all uppity about  urlLink the monitoring of U.S. elections .     urlLink Donald Trump , a.k.a.  urlLink The Great (No-)One , says screwing your investors is a   good   thing.

      On the  urlLink threatened lawsuits  against stations that air the  urlLink anti-Kerry "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" ad :  The cease-and-desist letter includes the following:  The statements made by the phony "crewmates" and "doctor" who appear in the advertisement are also totally, demonstrably and unequivocally false,   and libelous  .  It's been a while since that I got that "A" in Advanced Torts, but is it not itself libelous for someone to accuse, falsely and with  urlLink scienter , someone else of themselves being libelous toward them in the first place?  And besides, Kerry is a public official (are the anti-Kerry vets now public figures, I wonder?), so the standard is elevated from scienter to " urlLink actual malice ."  Wonder if a countersuit might be in the works.  Overall, IMHO the Kerry camp is handling this miserably so far.  Lots more at  urlLink Instapundit .   UPDATE #1:  Good excerpt on this topic over at  urlLink Little Green Footballs .

      BoiFromTroi has  urlLink an excellent post  on yet another Kerry flip-flop:   Despite his recent campaigning to ban gay marriage in individual states on the grounds that each state has the right to discriminate against gays as it pleases, Presidential Candidate John Kerry was unequivocal in his denouncement of the Defense of Marriage Act as Unconsititutional when  urlLink writing for the Advocate in 1996 :   The misnamed and misguided Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is as unconstitutional and unnecessary as it is mean-spirited and malicious. The authors of the bill mistakenly claim that Congress has the authority to allow one state to ignore a legally recognized marriage in another. But the U.S. Constitution is unequivocal on this point: "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State."  Imagine the confusion if we didn’t have such a clause: A child-custody decision in California could be ignored by Illinois; a divorce concluded in Nevada could be rejected in New York. DOMA does violence to the spirit and letter of the Constitution by allowing the states to divide.  Unconstitutional. Unnecessary. Premature. Presumptuous.   That was the flip...see  urlLink BFT's blog  for the flop.

       urlLink Another  "it would be funny if it weren't so sad" moment:   An Amtrak conductor who is a Republican congressional candidate has been suspended without pay for suggesting his train passengers should vote against Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. ... Farr said he used the train's public address system to inform passengers they would be delayed because of Kerry's train and quipped that they should vote accordingly in November. ... Amtrak has opened an informal investigation into Farr's actions, accusing him in a letter of violating company policies by making "inappropriate and denigrating announcements" to customers that "caused embarrassment to the corporation and the loss of good will of our passengers." ... Farr said that if his political statements were distasteful to some passengers, others likely were offended that   Kerry campaign banners were draped over Amtrak property  .  A few thoughts, some semi-sarcastic:  Let's quickly dispel the notion that  urlLink Amtrak  is somehow a "private" business. It has no shareholders (except the United States Government) and receives over one billion dollars per year in government subsidies (and still managed to lose $1.2 billion in fiscal 2003). Parr is a federal employee by any reasonable current interpretation of the term, and should therefore be provided the same protections against unlawful termination that any other government worker enjoys.  Parr did not say "vote against Kerry" on the P.A. system. He provided accurate information about a delay (  this is somehow bad?)   and said "vote accordingly" (  this is somehow bad?)  . I thought we liked "get out the vote" messages --  urlLink even this one .  I can't stand the thought that Amtrak is run by the government, but given that it is, I think Parr is absolutely right -- there should be no use of Amtrak facilities for campaigning, period. I wonder whether the Kerry campaign paid any user fees to Amtrak. Anyone up for  urlLink an FEC investigation ?  I have more Amtrak nonsense  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

      Not my area of expertise, but  urlLink this  concerns and angers me:     The Colorado woman who has accused Kobe Bryant of rape today sued the NBA star in federal court, claiming that she has suffered "stress, mental pain and suffering" as a result of the attack last June at a Vail-area resort. ... The complaint, which does not detail those other alleged attacks or specify monetary damages, contends that the woman--  identified only as "Jane Doe"  --has been subjected to "public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has suffered threats against her life and physical safety." Along with her complaint,   the woman, now 20, filed a "motion to proceed anonymously" in order to protect her privacy  . Now I'm always eager to jump on the bandwagon for "victims' rights," especially in the criminal context. But when it comes to   civil litigation  , where the only goal is to reap a monetary judgment, then I'm sorry, but plaintiffs should have to reveal their identities.  If you're concerned about your privacy and if you don't want publicity, fine...then   stay out of the civil court system!   No one is forcing you to sue, so you should have to follow the same rules as anyone else.  Most previous examples of plaintiff anonymity have concerned some clearly identifiable threat of real harm or retribution, not just a "desire not to be embarrassed." We're not talking about Mafia prosecutions here, nor are we trying to protect a child, undercover agent or whistleblower. This is an adult woman   who has the option of enjoying her privacy but who instead wants money and is now demanding both  . To coin a term, she should have to "play to pay." Having your cake and eating it too has no place in a courtroom.  Here is  urlLink a thorough, though biased, article  summarizing the issues and legal precedents of suing by pseudonym. An excerpt:   For many years there has been a presumption of judicial openness and an acknowledgment that public scrutiny of the judicial process is inherent in the First Amendment. "[A] trial is a public event. What transpires in the court room is public property . . . there is no special perquisite of the judiciary which enables it, as distinguished from other institutes of democratic government, to suppress, edit, or censor events which transpire in proceedings before it." Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 374 (1947). The expectation then is that courts are public places and people who avail themselves of the courts should expect to do so publicly. Moreover, our concept of fairness suggests that if a defendant's name is made public, the plaintiff's should be as well.  Sounds right to me, as does this:    urlLink Federal Rule 10(a)  provides that "[i]n the complaint the title of the action shall include the names of all the parties." A strict judicial construction of Rule 10(a) will probably lead to dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that plaintiff has not properly commenced an action.  Given the high profile of the Bryant incident, allowing the victim to sue by pseudonym would set a very notable and notorious precedent that would doubtless be widely used -- and abused -- in the future. There is simply no reasonable basis to allow it.   UPDATE:   urlLink Here  is my response to a Chicago Sun-Times editorial on "rape shield" laws.

       urlLink An update , via  urlLink Drezner , of  urlLink my earlier post  on the sorry state of Darfur:   A top U.N. human rights investigator Friday released a scathing report that blames   the Sudanese government   for atrocities against its civilians in the Darfur region and says "millions of civilians" could die.  "It is beyond doubt that   the Government of the Sudan is responsible   for extrajudicial and summary executions of large numbers of people over the last several months in the Darfur region...  "The current humanitarian disaster unfolding in Darfur, for which the government is largely responsible, has put   millions of civilians at risk, and it is very likely that many will die in the months to come as a result of starvation and disease  ," said Jahangir, a Pakistani lawyer.  Jahangir said there was "overwhelming evidence" that   the killing was carried out "in a coordinated manner by the armed forces of the government and government-backed militias  . They appear to be carried out in a systematic manner."  And this, from  urlLink The New Republic :  While an intervention force establishing no-fly zones in the air, safe zones on the ground, and secure transit routes for aid shipments might take care of the immediate problem,   each of these alone constitutes a serious violation of Sudanese sovereignty, and together they amount to a full-on invasion of western Sudan  . Hopefully, the government of Sudan, faced with this prospect, would act quickly itself to disarm and demobilize the Janjaweed, stop government forces from participating in any more violence, and let aid through. As things stand right now, however,   Sudan's leaders have said that any attempt to use force to intervene will be met with force  . Therefore, the international community needs to be fully prepared to engage and defeat the Sudanese military.  Establishing a no-fly zone against an advanced, hostile Sudanese air force would almost certainly require offensive attacks on Sudan's airfields, aircraft, and command and control system. Pushing into Darfur to force open border crossings, drive out or disarm resistant Janjaweed, and establish safe zones around refugee camps would require a significant commitment of ground troops, probably many more than the 7,000 or so   British, French, African Union, and Australian troops   already being considered. And if concerned nations are serious about military intervention, they had better make sure they have the stomach to endure casualties in what could turn out to be a bloody fight. If not, then they had better make sure they have the stomach to stand by while, once again, hundreds of thousands of Africans are brutally extinguished by their own government.  So let's review: the United States commits 112,000 troops, of whom roughly 10,000 are dead or wounded, to effect regime change of a brutal tyrant who slaughtered his own people and the people of a neighboring nation, invaded a peaceful neighbor and launched missiles into a nearby democracy.  Meanwhile, when faced with another brutal regime that is slaughtering millions of people, the United Nations sits by and issues reports and resolutions, while the usual suspects -- the U.K., Australia, perhaps even the U.S. -- do the dirty work. (The French would most likely go, if at all, only out of a sense of responsibility for neighboring Chad, a former colony.)  And who's criticizing whom again?   UPDATE:   urlLink Some stats courtesy of the BBC  --  Top UN donor countries to Darfur: US - £38.4m Netherlands £10.8m UK - £6.2m Canada - £4.1m Australia - £3.3m  France and Spain combined (not sure what the relevance of that combo is) -- £2.5 million. Shame on them.  I already predicted the U.S., U.K., and Australia would be the leaders in Darfur assistance, so now I'll go out and drink a Heineken and a Molson to apologize to the two noble nations I failed to anticipate.

       urlLink The AP :  Retired Adm. Stansfield Turner, who was CIA chief during the Carter administration and supports Sen. John Kerry's presidential bid, said Goss' selection marked "a bad day for the CIA." Goss was chosen simply "to help George Bush win votes in Florida," he said.  Let's see: War on Terror, Iraq War, budget deficit, Medicare prescription drug benefit, Social Security reform, Supreme Court appointments, gay marriage...what's that? He appointed a Floridian for DCI? Oh to heck with all those side issues...I just have to vote for him now!  Is there no floor beneath which some Democrat partisan ass won't crawl? Any chance Mr. Turner might be expecting some position in a Kerry Administration?  In the wake of the Kafkaesque bile spewed out at the Democratic Convention by Jimmy Carter, Al Sharpton and Ted Kennedy, the posse comitatus unleashed against the SwiftVets by Kerry's lawyers, and now this, I'm truly starting to get downright nauseated every time I think of the Democratic Party and John Kerry (and to reiterate --   I AM NO REPUBLICAN!  ).

      I have a lengthy comment  urlLink here  to a brief post at The Commons blog regarding  urlLink this article  on asbestos litigation, an excruciatingly difficult subject for legal theorists to get their arms around.   urlLink The Commons  is a most excellent blog that, in this case, just didn't do quite all its homework. I endorse it nonetheless -- good stuff.  P.S. Asbestos litigation is something I know a bit about thanks to my old Torts (and Advanced Torts, and Remedies) professor, Anthony Sebok, who has some outstanding commentary on the subject  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  The original post:   "Most asbestos lawsuits in the United States are being brought by claimants who are probably not sick," according to a new study,  urlLink Nature reports . According to the study, expert witnesses in asbestos cases are vastly overstating the extent of alleged asbestos-related harms.  My comment:  The Nature article, while damning, mixes two completely unrelated issues.  Just because someone is not "sick" from asbestos exposure does not necessarily mean they have no cause of action or are not entitled to compensation. The real debate regarding asbestos litigation is whether the aggregate assets of the defendants, which are finite and inadequate to satisfy all actual and potential claims, should be pooled now for something approaching an equitable distribution to those who suffered either actual present harm   or   the risk of future harm (i.e., medical monitoring costs or even a probabilistic recovery based on their   chances   of contracting pleural thickening, asbestosis or mesothelioma in the future) -- or, as is presently the case, should the money only go to the first plaintiffs who win the race to get to the courthouse and win full recoveries, until the last of the defendants is finally bankrupt, leaving future plaintiffs with no one to sue?  Meanwhile, using questionable expert testimony is a phenomenon that potentially exists in   any   litigation. I'm sure that defense attornies are well aware of this abuse (or soon will be), and will try their best to screen out such unreliable evidence at trial.    UPDATE:   urlLink Tech Central Station  has a related article -- with related flaws. The author spends most of the article bemoaning questionable (i.e, pro-plaintiff) radiology interpretations, but then mysteriously ends with this paragraph:  I did once have a patient who certainly suffered from asbestos exposure. He handled it all of his adult life, first in the shipyards of Norway, then later in an automotive factory here in the States. He died of mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer that's known to be associated with asbestos exposure. His widow has been trying to get compensation, but so far has been unsuccessful. The lawyers say they can't prove which was responsible for his health problems -- the shipyards or the auto plant. Whatever that is, it isn't justice.  Under an aggregation fund for present  and future  claims, her patient would had found at least  some  justice. But under the current "every plaintiff for himself" paradigm, she'll see many many more patients denied compensation (i.e., justice) in the future.

Sorry, but those of you who don't work on Wall Street will never know, and could never imagine, how loudly, how uproariously, we were laughing at you over all this " urlLink The Apprentice " nonsense. We've known for years how full of it Trump is and that his show was nothing more than a diversion to deflect from this impending implosion.  Want to be a greedy capitalist?  Good for you -- join the fun!  But don't do it by  urlLink swindling your investors  (more than once) and shilling for some lowest-common-denominator reality TV show that is as bizarre as your hair.  P.S. Speaking of greedy capitalist television shows -- anyone know what ever happened to the Canadian show "Traders" that appeared briefly on Lifetime of all networks?  Anyone ever see it on DVD in Canada or elsewhere?

       urlLink Some people  are jumping to connect  urlLink this dot :  The  urlLink Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  was invited to monitor the election by the State Department. The observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. It will be the first time such a team has been present for a U.S. presidential election.  with  urlLink this dot :  A baker's dozen of congressional Democrats, among them four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there.  I humbly disagree.  Based on the info available, the OSCE seems to be coming here to   learn from   the U.S. election process, not to   oversee   it, which was the original partisan and childish call for U.N. monitoring from Representative Johnson, who is now scrambling to equate the two for the sake of her own petty publicity.  What exactly is wrong with us saying "Come and see how the experts do it..." and in the process teaching a thing or two to these countries, some of which are literally building their electoral systems from scratch?  I say bring it on, welcome and pay attention!   Update:   urlLink Outside the Beltway  has a different view -- I'm still having trouble getting riled up about it though.

      Q: What do you do when you're a petty, mentally unstable third-world dictator and your nutball policies have resulted in, among other sorrows,  urlLink a plague outbreak ?  A: You declare plague "illegal."    The new nation of Turkmenistan, one of several Central Asian republics that rose from the Soviet Union's ashes, is ruled by a 64-year-old dictator named Saparmurad A. Niyazov, a strutting, miniature Saddam Hussein who calls himself Turkmenbashi (father of the Turkmens). A man of monstrous ego and modest intellect, he has outlawed beards on men and forbidden women to wear gold teeth, a sign of status. ... The world keeps quiet about Niyazov's eccentricities, aware that his vast wealth comes from control of one of the world's largest supplies of natural gas. All of this would be amusing, more or less, if we didn't think too hard about the effects of such policies. But over the last few months, the Turkmenbashi has taken the health of his nation's 5 million people into his own hands, with potentially devastating consequences. ... Most disturbing,   he has declared all infectious diseases — cholera, AIDS and other scourges — illegal   and has forbidden any mention of them. ... According to both Gundogar, a Turkmen opposition group, and the Turkmenistan Helsinki Initiative,   a deadly plague epidemic has broken out in the Turkmenbashi's territory  . ... These outbreaks happen periodically, and with good public health systems in place they can be managed. The Soviets in their day responded quickly, though they kept news of the outbreaks from the outside world. ...But the Soviets and their hundreds of trained plague experts no longer run the show, and the Turkmens are at the mercy of the Turkmenbashi's policies. At least 10 people are known to have died of plague this summer, and some reports place the figure considerably higher.   The Turkmen government has responded, predictably, by declaring the word "plague" illegal.   It has also instituted border controls "to prevent disease from entering Turkmenistan from neighboring states."  Guess who will wind up helping this wacko and his unfortunate subjects out of this jam, with supplies, personnel and money? (Hint -- It won't be France.)  And how long do you think it will be before some Soviet apologist makes the "at least the trains ran on time" argument -- "Well, at least we never had plague under Stalin!"   urlLink Turkmenistan  is too important to ignore -- it borders both Iran and Afghanistan, has significant coastline along the Caspian Sea, and, as the article mentions, has lots of natural gas (and some oil).  Anyone up for some humanitarian-motivated regime change?  Oh, right --  urlLink never mind . Some other time perhaps.   (Cross-linked at   urlLink  Outside the Beltway   .)    UPDATE:   urlLink Ex Nihilo  has some more news out of Turkmenistan.

       urlLink The BBC reports  that kids don't seem to be too concerned with intellectual property these days:   Almost half of young adults in the UK own pirated or counterfeit goods, a survey has found.  Software watchdog, the Business Software Alliance, found that the younger adults are, the more likely they are to own and use pirated goods. ... The net, cheap CD burners and traders selling fake products were blamed for making it easy to get pirated goods. ... The survey revealed that 28% of 18-29 year-olds did not even consider copyright laws before they bought such goods.  I also found this part interesting:   The survey also showed that attitudes to buying and using counterfeit goods change depending on whose goods are being pirated.  Generally the larger the corporation, the happier people were to buy pirated versions of what it made.  I have no doubt that U.S. numbers would be similar.  Now, instead drowning in yet another diatribe about moral relativism, the breakdown of the traditional family, the decline of organized religion, or the failures of the public school system, I want to try a different tack.  We have, for multiple generations now, taught ourselves and our children that people are entitled to a certain minimum amount of comfort. You shouldn't have to go without, we're told, and the fact that you can't afford something doesn't mean you shouldn't have it.  We have for almost a century subjected ourselves to a progressive income tax system that takes from some who have in order to give to others who have not, for no other reason than because someone, somewhere, says it's a good idea. We have for almost seventy years taken (and taken and taken) from the young to give to the old for no other reason than because someone, somewhere, says it's a good idea.  We have told ourselves, decade after decade, generation after generation, that corporations are greedy, they're cold, heartless, soulless entities, that they charge us more than they have to and that they manipulate us through their advertising, and that if they get "too big," then it's perfectly okay to dislike them, even hate them, and to punish them for their success and to make them "give back" the results of their successes.  Our government, at all levels, has, through confiscatory laws and vague pleas to "the public good," shown an ever-increasing willingness to deprive us of our property, either by taking it outright or by limiting our ability to use it.  And now, all of a sudden, you're surprised that young people have no respect for property rights?  I'm not. Not at all...

      The good folks at  urlLink Catallarchy  sniffed out  urlLink this disgrace  in the Boston Globe:    We have a list of deadbeat dads. We have a registry of sex offenders, which we now post on the Internet. Coming soon: a list of Massachusetts' corporate freeloaders. ... With no fanfare and over the veto of Governor Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts Legislature last month became the first in the nation to require the Commonwealth to compile an annual list of which companies' employees and their dependents use state health benefits the most, and what it costs taxpayers. The requirement, included in the state budget, applies to employers with more than 50 workers.  American medicine is the best in the world, but paying for it is a constant game of pass the buck. Increasingly, the private sector is passing the buck to the public sector. In 2001, about 67 percent of Americans under age 65 got their healthcare coverage through their employer, according to the Center for Studying Health Care System Change. By 2003, that number had fallen dramatically to 63 percent. Meanwhile, those under 65 getting government coverage increased to 12 percent from 9 percent. ... This shouldn't be allowed to slip. In Georgia, an internal audit of who was using the state's healthcare program for kids was revealing, if embarrassing for some brand-name companies. Wal-Mart, Georgia's largest employer, had about one child in the state program for every four employees, by far the highest ratio of children covered by the state. ... Deydamia Soto is an immigrant single mom in Roslindale. Soto, 48, cleans the offices at 225 Franklin St. five nights a week for Unicco Service Co., a Newton giant with 20,000 employees and sales of $690 million. She works part time, is paid $11.20 an hour, and isn't eligible for company insurance, so she and her daughter are covered under MassHealth. ... Bottom line: If Soto can't pay, and her employer won't, that leaves the rest of us. And if we're going to pick up the tab, we have every right to know which employers are freeloading -- and just what they are costing us.  Okay, deep breath, where to begin?   urlLink Unicco , which is basically a "cleaning-lady firm," is hardly the economic titan that the article suggests: $690,000,000 in   sales   (not net income!) for 20,000 employees equates to $34,500 in revenue per employee, before cost of services sold, payroll, fixed costs -- and of course taxes, taxes and taxes. That's hardly a flood of free cash flow with which to shower   part-time employees   with handsome benefits packages.  And shouldn't we be glad that there are companies like Unicco at all, that can actually provide jobs to unskilled workers and to immigrants in the first place? And as for working part-time and not qualifying for health benefits: to borrow loosely from Milton Friedman, it's better to be employed part-time than to be unemployed full-time. Obviously it would not be right to describe the   worker   as the "freeloader" either, but it's a fair question to ask why someone who expects health insurance shouldn't in turn be expected to earn it with a full-time job.  Note also that the law applies only to firms that hire more than 50 people. If I'm a Massachusetts firm that employs 51 people today, you can rest assured that I'll be employing 49 people tomorrow. Congratulations, you just increased the unemployment rate in that segment of the labor force by 4%. (See also  urlLink here .)  By the way, like most large companies, Unicco engages in significant  urlLink charitable activities . Yeah, real "deadbeats," those Unicco guys.  Now, notice two dirty tricks in the article: First the inflammatory description of the trends: Healthcare coverage goes from 67% to 63% and it's "fallen dramatically"? Government coverage rising to 12% from 9% is a "game of passing the buck"? Not exactly the most objective terms.  Second, observe the bait-and-switch. First we're talking about a Massachusetts cleaning firm, then suddenly we're talking about Wal-Marts...in Georgia and California? Of course, we all know that  urlLink Wal-Mart is the company that people love to hate , so I suppose a passing swipe is obligatory these days.  And as for "taxpayers" footing the bill -- well, we're either going to pay as taxpayers or as customers -- what's the author's point? Of course, the implicit assumption is that   business owners   will bite the bullet -- more "soak the rich" dressed in sheep's clothing.  For government, which never creates but only redistributes or destroys, to accuse private businesses of being "deadbeats" and "freeloaders" is the most perverted form of hubris. For Massachusetts, which gave us  urlLink Ted Kennedy  and  urlLink John Kerry , and which can't even  urlLink build a road  without squandering billions, to claim moral superiority in its financial affairs and its stewardship of its people is downright Kafkaesque.  And don't get me started about  urlLink forced busing .  Does Massachusetts ever do   anything   right?   UPDATE:  Speaking about Wal-Mart, here's  urlLink some related nonsense  fresh out of California.

      The New York Times has  urlLink an update  to my previous  urlLink post  and  urlLink update , on animal rights terrorists:  "It has been an incredible year for us," said Greg Avery, a spokesman for Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, a group that wages  urlLink a continuing campaign  against Britain's largest research lab, owned by Huntingdon Life Sciences, near Cambridge. "  The animal-rights movement is bigger and stronger than it has ever been.  "  The militants' successes have alarmed investors, scientists and drug manufacturers, who warn that   Britain - a dominant force in the pharmaceutical industry- could face a serious drop in biomedical investment if the campaigns are not curtailed  . ... [GlaxoSmithKline] was spending   tens of millions of dollars   to protect workers and buildings in Britain. The company's legal counsel recently moved out of his house with his children after receiving threats, Mr. Garnier said...adding that   several unnamed companies looking to invest had decided against Britain   because of the intensity of the animal welfare campaigns. ... Everyone associated with the lab, including   cabdrivers, caterers, delivery workers and bank executives  , has become a target. ... This year, 51 suppliers cut off business relations with Huntingdon, a number that is tallied by the animal welfare groups. The attacks can also be personal.   The managing director of the lab, Brian Cass, was beaten by men with baseball bats, and the cars and homes of Huntingdon employees have been vandalized in attacks linked to animal welfare advocates.   ... Mr. Avery said his group was not responsible for any violence, and he defended its right to make life difficult for companies associated with the lab, calling them fair game.  "The companies involved are valid targets," he said. "Auschwitz would not have existed without people supplying gas, chemicals, food. Every single one of those, big or small, is a cog in that machine."  Auschwitz?  My advice to the British pharmaceutical industry:   Come to the U.S.!   We know a thing or two about combating terrorists, especially terrorists who seek nothing less than the total destruction of something they deem evil in any degree. We also know about protecting private property and preventing harassment of private citizens.  And we value, even celebrate, the contributions of high-tech industries as much as, if not more than, any other nation. We're especially fond of pharmaceutical development and other biomedical research.  And remember: The philosophical underpinnings of animal rights terrorists are just as toxic and decrepit as al Qaeda's. Just as Islamic terrorists are motivated not by love of Islam, but rather by hatred of the West,   animal rights terrorists are not motivated by love of animals, but rather by hatred of humans  .

      The  urlLink AP is reporting  that the White House has discussed with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas the possibility of his replacing Chief Justice William Rehnquist, whom many expect to announce his retirement shortly after Bush's re-election (assuming that happens):    Thomas has recovered from his bitter 1991 confirmation hearings, and is comfortable in his role on the court as a conservative iconoclast, [biographer] Foskett said. Thomas is the youngest of the justices at 56 and could remain on the court for decades.  Whether he is elevated to chief justice "all depends on Bush being re-elected," Foskett said. Thomas' promotion to the court's top job would also depend on the exit of his boss, 79-year-old Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.  Rehnquist is not expected to retire before the November presidential election, but might do so in a second Bush term. The White House has a short list of candidates for any Supreme Court vacancy, and has presumably interviewed several potential nominees to succeed Rehnquist.  White House spokeswoman Erin Healy would not comment. "There are no vacancies on the court at this time," she said.  I am not a big fan of Clarence Thomas --who is most definitely   not   a libertarian, at least not anymore. (Word of advice: when   conservatives   praise someone for being "libertarian," run for the hills.) I especially reject his preference for "original intent" interpretation over "plain language" reading of the Constitution and legislation, and also his complete renunciation, like Scalia, of substantive due process. (A good summary of his general political views can be found  urlLink here .)  This is exactly why I think it would be   good   for him to be elevated to Chief Justice.  The Chief Justice, qua Justice, has   no   extra power or influence over the Court, with one puny exception: If he is in the majority on a case, then he gets to decide who writes the opinion. Big whoop.  On the other hand, the Chief Justice has   many   more administrative and bureaucratic responsibilities than his Associate Justice colleagues:  By statute, the Chief Justice presides over the Judicial Conference (28 U.S.C. § 331), selects the director and deputy director of the Administrative Office (28 U.S.C. § 601), chairs the Board of the Federal Judicial Center (28 U.S.C. § 621(a)(1)), designates judges to serve on the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation (28 U.S.C. § 1407 (d)) and on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (50 U.S.C. § 1803 (a)), and assigns district and circuit judges to serve temporarily in circuits other than their own (28 U.S.C. §§ 291–292). These statutory duties give rise to other responsibilities: The Chief Justice serves as the federal judiciary’s ultimate advocate and spokesperson with respect to legislation affecting administration of the federal courts—a duty that has become routine since William Howard Taft served as Chief Justice (1921–1930). The Chief Justice also appoints the some 200 members of the extensive committee system of the Judicial Conference.  urlLink Source .  (And who knows...maybe we'll have another  urlLink impeachment trial .)  As the saying goes: "If you don't like someone's performance, then kick him upstairs."

       urlLink This  is cool:   Atlantis, the legendary island nation over whose existence controversy has raged for thousands of years,   was actually Ireland  , according to a new theory by a Swedish scientist.  Atlantis, the Greek philosopher Plato wrote in 360 B.C., was an island in the Atlantic Ocean where an advanced civilization developed 11,500 years ago until it was hit by a cataclysmic natural disaster and sank beneath the waves.  Geographer Ulf Erlingsson, whose book explaining his theory will be published next month, says the measurements, geography and landscape of Atlantis as described by Plato match Ireland almost exactly.  “I am amazed no one has come up with this before, it's incredible," he told Reuters. "Just like Atlantis, Ireland is 300 miles long, 200 miles wide, and widest across the middle. They both have a central plain surrounded by mountains. I've looked at geographical data from the rest of the world and of the 50 largest islands there is only one that has a plain in the middle — Ireland."  Erlingsson believes the idea that Atlantis sank came from the fate of Dogger Bank, an isolated shoal in the North Sea, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the northeastern coast of England, which sank after being hit by a huge flood wave around 6,100 B.C.  "I suspect that myth came from Ireland and it derives from Dogger Bank. I think the memory of Dogger Bank was probably preserved in Ireland for around 3,000 years and became mixed up with the story of Atlantis," he said.  Erlingsson links the boundaries of the Atlantic Empire, as outlined by Plato, with the geographic distribution of megalithic monuments in Europe and Northern Africa, matching Atlantis’ temples with well-known burial sites at Newgrange and Knowth, north of Dublin, which predate the pyramids.  His book, "Atlantis From a Geographer’s Perspective: Mapping the Fairy Land," calculates the probability Plato would have had access to geographical data about Ireland as 99.98 percent.  Previous theories about Atlantis have suggested it may have been around the Azores Islands, 900 miles (1,440 kilometers) west of the Portuguese coast, or in the Aegean Sea. Others locate it solely in Plato's imagination.  Have a  urlLink black and tan  to celebrate...

      Today's Wall Street Journal (subscription site -- sorry):   What tax deductions, breaks or loopholes might be closed to pay the cost of lowering tax rates and expanding savings incentives? One possible target: Eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes. That deduction subsidizes high-tax states -- such as New York and California -- at the expense of lower-tax states. (It may have added appeal for Republicans, because so many of the high-tax states vote Democratic.)   Ouch.  Of course such a move wouldn't help  urlLink this table  look any less vomitous.

And now  urlLink this :   A vast red and white sea of flags proudly flutters in the breeze at the Rebel County's All-Ireland Championship matches, but the [County Cork Socialist Worker’s Party] (SWP) is determined to have one of them banned.  Joe Moore, SWP Cork spokesman, said: "We know the county colours are red and white but it's unfortunate one of the flags being flown is the Confederate flag from America."  "It represents the promotion of racism and slavery but Ireland is a multi-cultural society and such symbols should not be on display." ... Mick Dolan, the board's vice-chairman, said the idea of banning a certain flag and checking them before games was completely impractical.  "It's ridiculous, the flag's just red and white," he said. "Our fans also wave the Japanese rising sun flag, the Canadian flag, the Ferrari flag, but they mean nothing except for the colours."  Hat tip to  urlLink Tongue Tied .

       urlLink This  is so wrong in so many ways:  A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify where four companies are performing open-field testing of genetically modified crops in Hawaii.  U.S. District Judge David Ezra on Wednesday said the government must reveal the locations to the environmental watchdog group Earthjustice and the Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit group that tracks food production technologies.  The groups sued the government in November, alleging that the agency has failed to properly regulate genetically engineered crops. ... The government and the biotech industry argued that   public disclosure of the sites could lead to crop vandalism and corporate espionage of trade secrets  .  "It's disappointing," said Lisa Dry, a spokeswoman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization.   If crop locations were made public, it would be "a real detriment for continuing to do business in that area."   ... Michael Rodemeyer, executive director for the independent Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology, said there are strong arguments on both sides of the disclosure issue. "Certainly there are ways to make more information available to consumers," he said. "  It's not clear that crop location information is really going to help people understand more about what these safety issues are  .  Of course it's not going to help people understand...it will just makes it easier for the eco-wingnuts to locate their targets.  I guarantee it: If the court ruling stands, then within one year of the release of the information, at least one facility will be vandalized and at least one will be shut down due to security concerns or costs.  These people are not interested in engaging in any sort of rational discourse -- they want GM foods stopped at all costs. And now they apparently have legal standing to throw a monkey wrench into any GM research program they want, at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all.

        "Hey farmer, farmer   Put away that DDT now   Give millions malaria   But leave me the birds and the bees"     urlLink This Steven Milloy piece  is an absolute must-read (actually,   every   "Junk Science" column he writes should be considered a must-read):   Dr. Edwards [who recently passed away] led the opposition to environmental extremist efforts to ban DDT in the wake of Rachel Carson's infamous 1962 book " urlLink Silent Spring ." The testimony of Dr. Edwards and others during Environmental Protection Agency hearings in 1971 on whether to ban the insecticide led to an EPA administrative law judge ruling that, "DDT is not a carcinogenic hazard to man. DDT is not a mutagenic or teratogenic hazard to man. The uses of DDT under the regulations involved here do not have a deleterious effect on freshwater fish, estuarine organisms, wild birds or other wildlife."  Inexplicably — or so it seemed — DDT was nonetheless banned by EPA administrator William Ruckleshaus. Dr. Edwards investigated and uncovered disturbing statements and troubling connections between Ruckleshaus and anti-DDT environmental extremist groups. ... Now, even the New York Times has seen the light, running a pro-DDT editorial on Dec. 23, 2002 ("Fighting Malaria with DDT), a pro-DDT op-ed column on Aug. 7, 2003 (Is there a place for DDT?") and, most recently, a pro-DDT New York Times Magazine article on April 11, 2004. ("What the World Needs Now is DDT").   Milloy chronicles the ruthless and ethically questionable behavior of certain anti-DDT activists, boh in and out of government. The article is a good reminder of just how dangerous, and sometimes sociopathic, the eco-wingnuts can be.  P.S. The  urlLink Counting Crows version  sucks even worse.

      Bruce Springsteen in the  urlLink New York Times :    These questions are at the heart of this election: who we are, what we stand for, why we fight. Personally, for the last 25 years I have always stayed one step away from partisan politics. Instead, I have been partisan about a set of ideals: economic justice, civil rights, a humane foreign policy, freedom and a decent life for all of our citizens. This year, however, for many of us the stakes have risen too high to sit this election out.  Through my work, I've always tried to ask hard questions. Why is it that the wealthiest nation in the world finds it so hard to keep its promise and faith with its weakest citizens? Why do we continue to find it so difficult to see beyond the veil of race? How do we conduct ourselves during difficult times without killing the things we hold dear? Why does the fulfillment of our promise as a people always seem to be just within grasp yet forever out of reach?  Dear Bruce:  I read your op-ed in the New York Times with interest. I have always been an enthusiastic, but not fanatical, admirer of your music. Your songs often tell powerful stories and your band was refreshingly eclectic (you might prefer "diverse").  You mention that you ask yourself "hard questions" -- I would like to ask you some questions myself:    [More at the Permalink!]     Your presidential candidate, John Kerry, has spent roughly 20 years in the Senate, yet has  urlLink few if any significant accomplishments  during that lengthy period. No major legislation, or legislative topic, is associated with his name. He also has one of the  urlLink worst attendance records  for Senate votes. Are these the leadership qualities you look for in a President?  Your candidate is emphasizing his military service during the Vietnam War.  urlLink A group of Vietnam veterans  is publicly challenging many of the claims he has made about his war record. Kerry's attorneys are attempting to quash the debate by  urlLink threatening lawsuits against media outlets  that run the veterans' ads. As a performer, do you agree with this attempt to stifle free debate and expression? If you do not, are you willing to publicly call on John Kerry to stop the threats against the media and instead counter the claims in the "court of public opinion"?  Your vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, made millions of dollars as a personal injury attorney, by winning verdicts and settlements in the tens of millions of dollars, mostly against healthcare providers. Yet in 20 years as a trial lawyer,  urlLink Edwards never took a single pro bono case . Do you consider that ethical and consistent with the leadership ideals you value in a candidate? If not, are you willing to publicly demand an explanation from Edwards?  Some of your most popular music has been about the Vietnam War, its veterans and the way they were treated after returning home. The Vietnam War was fought in large part by conscripts and was the last "War by Draft" in this country. Yet essentially every call to restore the draft and other forms of involuntary national servitude has come from  urlLink members of your party . Do you agree with this, and if not, are you willing to publicly call for the permanent dismantling of the Selective Service?  Much of your music has been set in your home state of New Jersey. Yet New Jersey is in  urlLink the bottom 10% of net tax transfers  to the federal government. In other words, New Jersey sends far more tax money to Washington than it gets back. Is this fair? If not, will you publicly call for decreased transfer payments from some states to others and let Washington pay for federal needs and states pay their own way for local expenses and projects?  You mention that as a "well-to-do guitar player" you are now in the top 1% of income earners and have benefited handsomely from the Bush tax cuts (as did all Americans who paid any income tax in the first place). Yet you bemoan your windfall, as do your Democratic brethren, Ben Affleck and Bill Clinton. May I ask you the same question that  urlLink others have asked  of them, namely: "If you don't want your taxes cut, then why not send the extra refund back to Washington to help pay down the national debt?"  You ask why the United States cannot do more for its weakest citizens. Yet we already have a  urlLink massively progressive income tax system  in place -- one where the top 1% of income earners (i.e., you) pay over 25% of all income taxes and the bottom half of all income earners pay no income tax at all. Taking from some to give to others for no other reason than to equalize the distribution of income is socialism. Exactly how much more socialist would you like the United States to become?  Another question regarding "doing more for our weakest citizens." The weakest souls in the world are the unborn -- yet your candidate favors  urlLink the most unrestricted access to abortion . How do you explain this contradiction?  Good luck with your upcoming tour.  Best wishes, KipEsquire  cc:  urlLink Gene Healy     (Cross-linked with   urlLink  Outside the Beltway   .)

      Stanley Kurtz of National Review has yet another  urlLink "death throes" piece  trying to spin the defeat of FMA.  It's a long article and I don't fisk, but here are the two key errors in his analysis:  First:   Gay marriage is an issue most people prefer to avoid.   The public may oppose gay marriage  , but what it really wants is to avoid having to talk about it. This creates a false impression of apathy. Yet when court-imposed gay marriage looks inevitable, the public's stance flips. Once people decide that gay marriage is about to be forced on them against their will, they are galvanized into action.  How many times do we need to review this? It's really not difficult, as  urlLink I have commented on before : Even if a (bare) majority of Americans oppose gay marriage, the majority of   opponents   of gay marriage are, quite frankly, older Americans. They will, over time, die off. Younger Americans increasingly support gay marriage and full gay rights. So, contrary to whatever pretzel-twisting Kurtz wants to attempt with the meaning of the current legislative urgency of the bigots (which, again, reflects recognition of their   dwindling  , not growing, base), support for gay marriage is rising, and is almost certainly "inevitable."  Second:   Looking at the recent Senate FMA debate, you can see the signs. It was next to impossible to find a Democrat willing to defend gay marriage. Instead, the Democrats claimed that DOMA would hold, and dismissed the drive for an amendment as a distraction. Most Republicans, on the other hand, argued vigorously in favor of marriage as the union of a man and a woman.  His description of Democrat behavior may well be true, but Republicans are no better, as  urlLink this recent comparison  of gay marriage and abortion as political issues clarifies:   The comparison doesn't hold in one, very important respect: Abortions are sad. Weddings are happy. Having an abortion--or having a friend or relative who has one--may make you more supportive of abortion rights, but it won't make you celebrate the idea. Abortion won't make you smile.   People support abortion rights out of fear. They support gay marriage out of love.     Conservatives are becoming increasingly unable to be honest in their positions (i.e., "I'm opposed to love"), so they have to couch their bigotry in nonsense like "protecting marriage" (from whom?), and of course " urlLink it's about the children ."  Ever more nonsense for an ever more desperate position.   Cross-posted at   urlLink  Outside the Beltway   .

      Need a reason to be angry about something? Try  urlLink this :   Picture this: a gigantic cheeseburger (with tomatoes and lettuce) slamming into two high-rise buildings, as cartoon characters run from the flaming ruins.  It's clearly a takeoff on the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center, and according to the Virginia-based  urlLink Center for Individual Freedom , the illustration appears on page 18 of a 30-page "food diary" distributed by Subway sandwich shops in Germany.  Last week, the Center for Individual Freedom launched a grassroots campaign against anti-American tray-liners at German subway stores. The tray-liners -- a promotion for the film "Super Size Me" -- showed an obese Statue of Liberty holding a burger and fries in her hands, under a headline asking, "Why are Americans so fat?" According to the Center for Individual Freedom, the headline used the word "Amis," which is considered a derogatory term for Americans.  The Center says complaints from Americans prompted German Subway shops to pull the tray-liners. But the cheeseburger-crashing-into-buildings image apparently is still out there -- distributed in German subway stores over the past few days.  The  urlLink Subway website  makes no mention of the situation, but does have this:   The SUBWAY® chain has aggressive growth plans for Germany and is constantly seeking new franchisees, who embrace the entrepreneurial spirit, to develop SUBWAY® restaurants throughout the country. Guess I'm lunching at  urlLink Blimpie  from now on.

      One very quick thought on the  urlLink Washington State trial court ruling  allowing gay marriage:    Downing concluded that barring same-sex partners from civil marriage is "not   rationally related   to any legitimate or compelling state interest."  This is important -- if the trend, established in  urlLink Lawrence v. Texas , that the "rational relation test" actually means something (it rarely has in the past), then   it will be far easier to challenge gay marriage bans going forward  .  Equal protection challenges consistently failed in past gay rights cases because the challengers typically sought (unsuccessfully) to have sexual orientation made a "suspect classification" demanding a higher level of scrutiny than "mere rationality." But now, by arguing that gay marriage bans aren't rationally related to any legitimate government interest anyway, gay marriage advocates completely change the nature of the debate and put the burden on the   state   rather than on the challenger.  Full court opinion  urlLink here .   UPDATE:   urlLink Dahlia Lithwick at Slate  trips and stumbles her way into a similar observation regarding the  urlLink Alabama sex toy ruling .

      Alabama has produced legal chaos like  urlLink Roy Moore  and  urlLink sex toy bans , so perhaps  urlLink this post  at the blog "The World Around You" isn't too surprising:  Alabama has by far the nation's longest constitution at more than 300,000 words. The constitution currently contains 751 amendments. As if that weren't exciting enough, we will have 35 more amendments on the ballot in November, which if approved would bring the total to 787.  I wonder whether Alabama lawyers specialize..."Practice Limited to Amendments 1-250" etc.  And of course I won't mention where  urlLink this movie  is set.

       urlLink A while back  I caught some flak for basically saying that Slate's  urlLink Steven Landsburg was really stupid .  Well guess what: Steven Landsburg is  urlLink   really really really   stupid :  Being detained and questioned is a burden; it's inconvenient and it's demeaning. But there's no reason that burden has to be borne entirely by the detainees. To spread the burden, all the airlines have to do is   give each detainee a $100 bill for his trouble  . If Northwest had had a policy like that on Annie Jacobsen's flight, it would have paid out $1,400 to the 14 Syrians. Assuming there were another 200 passengers on that board, they could have covered that cost with a $7 hike in ticket prices.  Talk about a solution in search of a problem...  Besides the fact that we already pay  urlLink taxes and security surcharges  up the wazoo when we fly, Landsburg's basic economic premise is, well, retarded. There is   every reason   in the world why "the burden has to be borne entirely by the detainees." They're the ones imposing the cost upon themselves in the first place!  If you attempt to fly with an unfavorable passport (e.g., Syrian) or an expired visa, or if you overlay "the profile" on yourself (e.g., by paying cash or flying one-way or having 14 people sit all over the plane rather than together in a block of seats), or if you behave suspiciously on the plane, then why on earth should the passengers   who do everything right   subsidize you? In the language of economics, there are no externalities and hence there is no logic in imposing transfer payments.  And can you imagine the  urlLink moral hazard  problem? Heck, I'd dress up like Yasser Arafat if it got me a $100 rebate off my travel cost.  Landsburg analogizes his nutball scheme to the bad old days when airlines routinely overbooked flights and had to "bribe"people to give up their seats. The comparison is meaningless: in the case of overbooking it was   the airline   that was, essentially, breaching its contract by failing to provide the purchased service. So of course it should be the airline that bears the cost of the breach. To the extent that there is any "breach" with security detention, it is by   the passenger  , not the airline (and most certainly not the other passengers). So again, it should be the detainee who pays the "cost" of his own inconvenience.  Landsburg himself acknowledges that he's really not arguing economics anyway, but rather warm fuzzy feelings:  First, who says we have to be cold-blooded all the time? When there's a conflict, why can't we sometimes be fair instead? Second of all, even if your own blood runs cold as ice, you're never going to enact a policy that runs so counter to the general public's sense of fairness.  This is   life-and-death stuff  , this is the   war on terror  . Damn right I'm going to be "cold-blooded," and I expect the government and the airlines to be just as (economically) ruthless.

      Just when you thought it couldn't get worse than  urlLink blowmobiles :  The government should require data recorders in all passenger vehicles, federal safety officials said Tuesday in a recommendation arising from the investigation of a car crash that killed 10 people and injured 63. ... "We believe very strongly that vehicles should have a black box," NTSB chairman Ellen Engleman Conners said. ... The NTSB recommended black boxes two months after the top federal auto safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said it saw no need to require them because automakers are adding them voluntarily to more models. ... Critics worry about who would get access to that information. Privacy advocate David Sobel said millions of drivers on the road now have no idea that their vehicles are collecting data.  "They certainly don't know what's being collected, how long it's being retained and who can get access to it under what circumstances," said Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ... The NTSB has the power only to investigate and recommend. Any requirements would have to be imposed by NHTSA.  Of course, as a libertarian I'm on board with the privacy concerns (which extend beyond the criminal context after a major accident to include everyday uses and abuses by insurance carriers, rental car firms, automotive finance companies, etc.). The available literature on the subject show that there is some legal debate as to who actually owns the data collected by such devices.  But the even more flagrant common sense violation is   cost  . Given that approximately 99.9% of all motor vehicles are never in a fatal or even a very serious accident, do we really need to mandate yet another cost increase to   every vehicle   just so NTSB can issue some reports?  Responsible drivers may actually   want   to have black boxes installed, to vindicate their (likely safe) driving in any future accident -- fine. But would we ever consider mandating that every vehicle in the U.S. have a permanently installed child safety seat just because it might prevent a handful of infant deaths? (Compare and contrast:  urlLink The Great School Bus Seat Belt Debate .)  And of course, the single biggest issue in highway safety has nothing to do with black boxes:  Those who believe older drivers should have to prove their driving ability cited the accident as an example of the tragedy that can result when people are too old to drive safely. The safety board could not determine whether Weller's age played a role in the accident, focusing instead on the need for stronger barriers at regularly recurring outdoor events such as street fairs and farmers markets.  The Forces of Darkness respond to that  urlLink here .   BUT WAIT...THERE'S MORE!  The NTSB also wants to engage in  urlLink similar cost-benefit obliviousness  on airliners:  The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday urged federal airline regulators to act on its longstanding recommendation to require that children younger than 2 be strapped into restraint seats on planes.  Such a rule would end the airlines' practice of allowing infants and toddlers to sit on their parents' laps. The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates aviation safety, questions whether the change will protect children.  Peggy Gilligan, the FAA's deputy assistant administrator for regulation and certification, said   only three unrestrained children died in airline crashes in the past 20 years  . If parents are required to purchase a ticket and place their child in a seat, rather than on their laps, they may opt to drive, Gilligan said.    Small children face "a substantially higher risk on highways than in aviation  ," she said.  Would almost be funny if it weren't so sad.   UPDATE:  The  urlLink Washington Times  agrees with me.

       urlLink Shame on them :  The government agency that distributes foreign aid cost taxpayers half a million dollars the past two years by repeatedly upgrading senior officials' plane tickets from coach to business class, an investigation found.  Among those at the  urlLink U.S. Agency for International Development  who took advantage of the upgrades were Administrator Andrew Natsios   and the agency's internal watchdog  , Inspector General Everett Mosley, according to two internal reports obtained by The Associated Press. ... Mosley's investigators also concluded Natsios may have run afoul of standards of conduct by failing to stop the practice "after he and members of his executive staff had been put on notice" that it was inappropriate. ... From January 2002 to February 2004, USAID "has paid a cumulative total of $494,000 for business class travel that is not properly justified based on government rule and/or regulation," investigators said. The investigators did not try to calculate the extra cost over the two decades the policy was in effect. ... A trip by Natsios and another official to Zurich, Switzerland, cost nearly $13,000; coach tickets would have cost $1,770, the reports said. ... The internal investigation also questioned whether Natsios and other officials may have violated a law that prevents retaliation against whistle-blowers when they reassigned the agency's chief of travel and transportation after she protested the upgrades.

      So is it any surprise to anyone that Democratic schutzhund  urlLink Richard Ben-Veniste  is  urlLink criticizing the President  for -- gasp! -- not entirely agreeing with the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission (whose members are now on a national tour -- see  urlLink my previous post ):  Two Sept. 11 commission members questioned President Bush's proposal for a national intelligence director, saying Tuesday that whoever holds the job should have the power to control spending and staff at all 15 U.S. spy agencies. ... Richard Ben-Veniste, the former Watergate prosecutor, said the post would be weakened by anything less than full budget authority and the ability to hire and fire.  "Providing a figurehead is not what we intended," Ben-Veniste said.  So anyone with less than absolute power is a "figurehead"? How Watergate of him...  Fortunately, other Commission members are showing a little more neutrality and honest commentary.  This partisan nobody (sorry..."ex-somebody") made a mockery of the Commission by treating an ultra-senior member of the Executive Branch like dirt. He should keep his mouth shut from here on in.  If a  urlLink special session of Congress  is what it takes to finally shut down this (ex-)Commission and the partisans like Ben-Veniste, then bring it on (despite what I previously wrote  urlLink here ). I'm tired of this moron.

      So I was reading  urlLink this Slate article  about Citiblob's terrible new advertising campaign, when I got to thinking:  I use a cash rebate card rather than a points or miles card.  And I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would choose anything different.  We have a saying on Wall Street -- cash is king. Based on my (cursory) research, the nominal values of miles card and rebate card expenditures tend to be roughly the same. In other words, there is typcially little difference between: (a) charging X dollars on a miles card for a free ticket, or (b) charging the same X dollars on a cash rebate card, which would then earn enough cash to purchase that same ticket. (This makes sense, since the cards generally are buying the miles from the airlines anyway -- the money should be roughly the same whether it goes to the airline or the cardholder). I am of course also assuming no differences among cards with respect to annual fees or finance charges -- I am focusing only on the different reward options.  Yes the miles cards tend to throw all kinds of sign-up bonus miles at you, and inundate you with special offers (e.g., use XYZ Rental Car and get extra card miles). But how is that significantly better than renting the same XYZ Rental Car via the   airline's   frequent flyer promotion (as opposed to the   card's  ), getting the miles anyway, and getting the cash rebate to boot?  Ceteris paribus, one should always prefer the durable commodity (i.e., cash) over the perishable commodity (i.e., miles). Likewise, one should prefer liquid cash over illiquid miles. And points must be even worse than miles, I would imagine.  Also, why would a perfectly rational person ever use a   debit   card, as opposed to using a credit card and paying off the entire balance each month? Choosing the latter seems unconditionally superior, since it puts a few extra pennies of float interest in your pocket and also helps your credit score.  Or did I just answer my own question with that "perfectly rational" part?

       urlLink Good grief :  Disabled high school students in Alaska will gain broad accommodations,   including the use of dictionaries and computerized spell-checkers  , on the state's standardized mandatory graduation exam under a legal settlement announced yesterday.  The agreement, which requires court approval, would conclude one of several legal challenges to the high school exit exams that have been adopted in some form by about half the states.  To avoid penalizing students with physical or learning disabilities, Alaskan officials said they would allow for a variety of accommodations during testing, like   the selective use of word processors or calculators  , as deemed appropriate by experts.   Tests may also be read aloud to some students  , and severely disabled students may be able to graduate without ever passing the exam, should their other work be deemed adequate by experts. ... Some of the accommodations are controversial, like reading out loud a test that is supposed to measure one's reading ability.  "Not everybody likes every part of the settlement," said Roger Sampson, Alaska's commissioner of education and early development. "But I think they clearly understand the benefits."  I'm sorry, I don't "clearly understand the benefits" at all. In theory, I'm all for what used to be called "mainstreaming" disabled students. But on the other hand, a high school diploma, or a passing grade on an exit exam, has to mean   something  . Seems to me there's an implicit assumption here that any student has an a priori right to pass any exam. Or at least any student who makes an effort.  Realize what the next step will likely be: a disabled student passes such an exit exam, or obtains a diploma, with whatever form of assistance he needs, then demands a job (or  urlLink a seat in medical school ), that he is clearly unsuited for because he lacks,   not the physical or mental abilities  , but rather the requisite underlying skill set (e.g., he just never learned basic geometry) because the exam, which he passed, never really tested it given the "accommodations."  What exactly would be so bad with the alternative briefly mentioned in the piece: If, for whatever reason, a disabled student can't pass a portion of an exit exam or satisfy a graduation requirement solely because of his disability,   just exempt him from that requirement   -- don't tamper with the exam. The student's transcript could reflect that (e.g., "Math 10 -- No Grade, Disability Exemption").  There would be no stigma of having a watered down exam, the educational experience would still be utilized as fully as possible, and the diploma or credential becomes factually accurate, without employers or admissions counselors having to guess what it really represents.  I believe that's how they do it for Phys.Ed. -- a student in a wheelchair simply doesn't go to gym class, but is still allowed to graduate. No big deal.  But having reading comprehension tests read aloud? Sorry, that's just plain wrong.

      Light news day today, so I'll settle for  urlLink this :   Hollywood beauty Halle Berry has slammed women who have plastic surgery.  The Catwoman star said going under the knife in an effort to look younger was "insane".  "I do think we've become obsessed with beauty and the fountain of youth and, frankly, personally I'm really saddened by the way women   mutilate   [SIC!!!] their faces today in search of that," she said.  "I see women in their thirties getting plastic surgery, pulling this up and tucking that back. "It's like a slippery slope - once you start you pull one thing one way and then you think, 'Oh my God, I've got to do the other side'.  "There is this plastic, copycat look evolving and that's frightening to me."It's really insane and I feel sad that's what   society   [SIC!!!] is doing to women."  Berry, 37, was speaking at a press conference in London to promote new movie Catwoman.  The Oscar-winning actress recently told how being beautiful had done her no favours.  "Beauty? Let me tell you something -   being thought of as 'a beautiful woman' has spared me nothing in life  . [  Oh really?  ] No heartache, no trouble. Love has been difficult. Beauty is essentially meaningless and it is always transitory," she said.      [Heck - last time I checked, life is transitory, what's your point?]      Some thoughts:  First off, plastic surgery is growing far faster among men than women. Some info  urlLink here .  Second, it's mighty easy for someone who already looks, well, like   that  , to downplay physical appearance, but would Berry be where she is today if she weighed 240 pounds, developed a bald spot or had a malformed ear? Like the saying goes: "People living in glass houses shouldn't praise mud huts."  What's so damn "insane" about people wanting to look good, anyway? Is there really all that much difference between what often is very minor surgery and, say, having every chemical known to man poured on your scalp at the hairdressers on a regular basis?  Why is it perfectly acceptable to spend money -- hell, even to obsess -- about clothes, shoes, eyeglass frames, nail polish or which razor shaves closest, but not to want to do something about hairlines, dumbo ears or spare tires? To a large extent even the cars we drive, the homes we live in, even our  urlLink pets , are often "fashion statements" that we acquire in order to make our lives more aesthetically pleasing. Why can't we want the mirror to function the same way?  And unlike a dye job or a new pair of Kenneth Coles, the results of plastic surgery are often permanent, or at least very long-lasting. And a nip-tuck of whatever form can be the jump start for pursuing other physical or mental health options for those who need them.  And please don't get me started about " urlLink addiction " -- could you please wait until   after   I have a problem before you try to fix it?  And what would Berry say about people who tattoo or pierce every imaginable part (and some   un  imaginable parts) of their bodies? Are they somehow less "insane" than a woman who gets breast enlargement (or, increasingly common, breast   reduction  ) surgery?  And how about orthodontics, laser eye surgery, mole removal, teeth whitening, laser hair removal, etc., etc., etc.? Where does "reasonable" end and "insane" begin?  And who should be making that decision -- Berry and a bureaucrat...or me and my doctor?  P.S. In case you're wondering -- the answer is "yes." ;-)

A woman who stole $4.52 worth of fuel was ordered to stand outside the gas station Friday wearing a sandwich board sign that declared: "I was caught stealing gas." ... Purnell, 18, who was caught on surveillance tape speeding away from the gas pump, walked along the convenience shop's grassy storefront as passing drivers honked horns and made catcalls.  Some passers-by considered the punishment to be a good deterrent.  "Embarrassment is the best way to deal with these things," Randy Jedlicka said.  And while we're on the subject, we need more of  urlLink this  too. Bravo to the airline, which did   exactly   the right thing -- be civilized or be gone!

      Want to see the future? Read  urlLink this New York Times piece  on the looming airline pension crisis:  [T]he federal agency that insures company pensions is facing a possible cascade of bankruptcies and pension defaults in the airline industry that some experts fear could lead to another multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout. ... The  urlLink Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  is already hobbled by debt, having picked up the pieces of more than 3,200 failed pension plans in its 30-year life. The scale of the failures has risen sharply in the last three years, but the agency has few tools at its disposal to prevent the situation from becoming worse. ...   [B]ecause pension obligations, unlike bank deposits, do not have to be paid off all at once, it is difficult to raise alarms about the threat.    "The real blowup doesn't happen right away; it happens over time," Mr. Kandarian said. "You've got to address it now, but it doesn't look like a crisis now. The crisis is always over the next hill."   The risk is that the longer the problems are avoided, the worse they can get.   ... It wasn't supposed to be this way. In 1974, Congress responded to an ugly string of pension failures in the auto industry by passing landmark legislation. From then on, any company that promised pensions to its workers would be required to   set aside enough money   to pay them. Rules were written to determine how much money was enough. To weave the retirement safety net even more tightly, Congress also created the pension insurance program.  Those protections were hailed as "the greatest development in the life of the American worker since Social Security" by Senator Jacob K. Javits, the New York Republican who died in 1986. But for many workers, those protections no longer look so secure.  "  You see that the whole thing could really be a house of cards that could come crashing down  ," Mr. Dean said.  All the same phenomena as with Social Security: so-called "guaranteed" benefits that in fact are supported by absolutely nothing except unenforceable promises (  there is no "lock box"!  ); dubious actuarial assumptions, a slow crawl deeper and deeper into crisis, culminating in massive benefit cuts, bankruptcy and, ultimately, taxpayer bailout on a mammoth scale.  If you're under 40, this is what you can look forward to without privitization. This is exactly what will happen to Social Security, for exactly the same reasons, unless major changes are adopted immediately.   UPDATE:  Apparently the  Times  editorial board doesn't read its own paper -- they're a week late and a thesis short with  urlLink this empty editorial  on the PBGC.

       urlLink Obernews  alerts us to  urlLink a stunning eminent domain victory  in Michigan:   Reversing more than two decades of land-use law, the Michigan Supreme Court late Friday overturned its own landmark 1981  Poletown  decision and sharply restricted governments such as Detroit and Wayne County from seizing private land to give to other private users.  The unanimous decision is a decisive victory for property owners who object to the government seizing their land, only to give it to another private owner to build stadiums, theaters, factories, housing subdivisions and other economic development projects the government deems worthwhile.  The decision is based on Michigan constitutional law, so its precedential value elsewhere is limited. It's significant, however, in that apparently Michigan was the most egregious ignorer of the basic  urlLink Takings Clause  rule (i.e., "you may take private land for  public use , but never for  private use by someone else "). It's also relatively rare to see any supreme court, SCOTUS or state, summarily sweep away twenty years of bad law (appellate courts tend to be very incrementalist, even in backpedaling).  Of course, the spirit of the Takings Clause has been almost completely eviscerated in modern times through what I call "  near-takings  ," such as excessive zoning, environmental regulation, the Endangered Species Act, etc., etc. etc. The most notorious examples currently are  urlLink smoking ban confiscatorians ; see also the (small-c) communists in  urlLink King County, Washington .  More on near-takings abuses  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

      Need a reminder of how bass-ackward the Vatican is? Read  urlLink this :   The Vatican on Saturday denounced feminism for trying to blur differences between men and women and threatening the institution of families based on a mother and a father. ... The concerns, raised in a 37-page document written by one of Pope John Paul II's closest aides, broke no new ground, maintaining the Roman Catholic Church's ban on women priests, for example. ... The document also took issue with a "certain type of feminist rhetoric" that   makes "demands 'for ourselves.'  " .. The Rev. Thomas Reese, a commentator on the Catholic church, said in an e-mailed statement that "although most American feminists would express their theology differently from the Vatican, on the practical level, they are on the same page (in terms of equality in education, politics, workplace)   except on abortion and women priests  ." [  Details, details...]   ... The document also expressed the Vatican's concern that   blurring of differences between sexes could pose a challenge to church teaching  ..."  Really? What a surprise...  P.S. Don't understand the title?  Read  urlLink here .
