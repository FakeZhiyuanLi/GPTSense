      i feel like i have so much to say.. and i hav finally got the chance to say it.. its like these words in my head that i need to put down.. and my first day at blogging... i cannot resist writing in some more...  i want to remind my self of the woman i was.. and to remind.. i first need to remember.. remember all that made me "ME"... or maybe i need to forget.. forget all that took away "ME" from me..  it was easier being a girl who cud trust strangers.. coz she never thought they cud possibly do anything to hurt her.. she believed that nobody had the power to hurt her.. coz she wudnt give them that power..   it was so easy to trust the first time.. knowing that if they betrayed her trust.. she wud jus move on and never look back to that particular person.. but she cud still trust others... it used to be so simple.. to walk away...   when did it get so difficult? when did the fear creep in.. and she began to feel maybe it was safer to not trust.. to be careful.. she allowed doubts to settle in.. and these doubts.. these fears took so much of space that so much was lost to fit them in...   she lost her belief in others.. in herself... she lost her confidence.. she lost the energy to deal with people.. it all seemed so much trouble.. it was so much easier to jus be by herself..  i still believe that "To LOVE is to give someone the power to hurt you. To TRUST is to know they would never use that power against you". the woman in me cud still love ... but she cudn't trust..  and her doubts were killing her.. she cud not even express it to whom she loved.. why?? why cudnt she say wat she felt?? because it wud change nothing... there cud be a 1000 reasons to justify her doubts.. but they wudnt help her... why not?? becoz she knew that the problem was simply that she was afraid to trust.. she believed that "If you trust no proof is necessary. If you don't no proof is sufficient". she, therefore, didnt want proof... she just wanted to believe.. to trust.. from within her heart.. she dotn want explanations.. nor justifications.. she wanted help and support to build that trust.. the trust that needs no explanations or justifications..  but then... the trust is within me.. and i have decided to help the woman in me to find that trust.. to believe again... believe in herself.. yes.. i will love.. and i will trust.. i will allow myself to take the risk of my heart being broken.. but i will not let it break my spirit.. i will not let it break "ME".. coz i love myself too much to let that happen..  I Believe in ME.. and in the Possibilites of My Life...

      Yes... its my life... and I alone shall choose how to live every moment of it...   I deserve the very best in life... and I alone am responsible for my happiness...   There's this little voice in me that keeps reminding me of how very special I am... especially when I allow other people to make me feel otherwise... One of my favourite quotes is "When You settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for". I know I have made mistakes in life... and one I make most often is to "Settle for less than I know I deserve". The price I have paid is to lose a very important part of me... the part that I loved best about myself.. I can feel the difference.. the emptiness.. but I know that I alone can fill that emptiness.. the missing part is still within me.. it is me.. it isnt really lost.. just hidden.. and I have decided to find it.. to nurture it.. to love it and cherish it..  I used to be a person who wasn't afraid to speak her heart.. I allowed other people to take it away from me.. I learnt to be afraid... mostly of saying what I thought.. what I felt... and what I believed... but not anymore... I have a right to be happy.. to dream.. to follow my dreams.. to expect the best.. and to fulfill my expectations... and today I make a promise to myself.. to be who I AM... every day... every moment.. and to say what I feel.. what I think...   I know its going to be difficult to let go of the fear... but today I choose to free myself of all fears..   This blog is mostly about my first step towards that freedom... the freedom to express myself for who I truly am...   This is a commitment I make to myself... and this shall be the most important commitment that I will live upto.. the commitment to love ME...

      Kinda feeling like am in the middle of being totally lost and completely found.. feeling very confused.. and yet so clear.. don't really know how to explain this feeling even to myself.. the only advice i can give myself at this moment is "wait.. time will tell.." well, not that patience is one of my virtues.. but i dont hav much of a choice right now.. its like am tellin myself.. "hey, jus learn to live in the moment" but then am also waiting for that one moment when life would be clearer.. its like my entire life is in my hand.. and yet.. there are people who affect it in certain ways.. by thier choices.. by their actions.. and those people are certainly in no hurry to make their choices.. or atleast to convey the choice.. if they hav made it.. here i am telling myself it doesnt matter wat they decide.. coz at the end of the day, i'll still be here for me.. to love me.. to hold my end thru everything.. to walk ahead.. but on the other hand.. even to allow myself to move on and walk ahead.. i first need to let go.. and to do that.. i need to know wat it is that i have to let go of.. and wat it is that i can move on with.. answers that certain other people can answer.. yes, the ultimate answers are all internal, they are all within us, the final choice is always ours.. but can i ignore all external factors.. is it all upto me.. well if i have to solve my problems at my pace then it has to be all upto me.. maybe all that i need is faith... faith in me...

        Nice Thought:    Often people try to live their lives backwards: They try to   have   more things in order to   do   more of what they want, so that they will   be   happier.  The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first   be   who you really are, then   do   what you need to do in order to   have   what you want.

      We all forget that being alive isnt all that life is about.. its so much more.. it is so precious and so valuable.. and yet so easily taken for granted.... this lovely gift called life.. that we all forget to be grateful for.. we all ask God for things we think we need to live.. or rather to live happily... (and am not even talking about matrial things) .. we ask that people love us.. others understand us.. we complain about those who hurt us, who cheat us, who betray our trust... of friends who aren't there for us when we need them... we question God for letting things happen to us.. we blame him for allwoing others to hurt us.. we cry about the wrong being done to us inspite of us having lived so right... but we forget what God gave us... he gave us this life.. and he gave us the choice to live it the way we want.. its upto us to decide if the actions of others is going to affect how we feel about ourselves.. no one was put on this earth to make us happy... it isnt another's responsibility to bring us joy.. and no one owes it us to be true to us.. or to "be there" for us.. if a friend stands by you in your hour of need... we should be thankful... but we shouldn't expect it.. or take it for granted.. we need to remember that "from the moment we are born till the moment of our last breath.. the only one who will be with us every second and  understand what we feel every minute, know us and be there for us at all times... is only us".. and hence it we who must love us most.. i alone need to believe in me... everyone in our life.. no matter how important.. and no matter how close.. will come and go... and maybe come back.. maybe not.. others may take their place.. but thru it all.. we continue to live.. how can we then let our happiness be in the hands of others.. and what gives us the right to blame someone for the pain we feel... oh yes there will be moments of hurt, and pain, there will be betrayals, there will be times we are let down by those we turn to for understanding, for help, for love.. but in those moments we need to remind ourselves that "life is more than this pain, this hurt.. life is what we want it to be.. what we make of it..." and we should simply choose to make it better.. love yourself.. always love yourself.. and believe that God loves you.. even in the pain and the hurt.. the struggles.. the loneliness... through it all... God loves us a lot.. and he will make it better.. ALWAYS and FOREVER.....
