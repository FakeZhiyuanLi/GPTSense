I guess I'm a little sore from the minor collision yesterday but not too bad. I feel glad to be home! And Hungry lol!  11-40A Mom went to work. lol Nothing is happening today!

      Well i will start out by telling with the first day that i was gone! ;)   July 18, 2004 well we left the house at about 9-30A. :(&nbsp; But we took our "good ol' time" gettin' up there.&nbsp; About all we did on the way was talk and eat. ;) and when we got in Toronto we couldn't find the RAMADA PLAZA hotel and we were lost for an hour on highway 27. lol   So we got there! Finaly! And Jeannine and Jerry Côté were already there waiting for us :( lol  They had 10 Hours to travel and we actually only had 7 ;)   But...... We gave them the doggie and they left. Although I think that Jeannine was dissapointed about the dog because she had mats :( OH well... We didn't do anything else that day but rest in our hotel room!   July 19, 2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We woke up late and got in the car! We spent 3 hours looking for breakfast! OMG you can't get eggs anywhere there!   So after that we ended up 2 blocks from the hotel eating Burger King at Noon! lol   After that I went to the mall there and got a hat that says 龍 which means dragon in Chinese. ;) I know this because it says DRAGON on the hat also. ;) (I used a translator to get that Chinese word offline because I cannot type it, but I did Check it to my hat and it is the same.)   Later on that day--- We took the car back to the Hotel and got on public transportation so that we wouldn't get lost! But we were unsuccsessfull with the not getting lost thing! We got lost downtown on foot! lol   We did though take the busses and the subway! It was so awesome because I havn't ever taken city transportation! And I hear it is a lot cheaper than New York' s Public Transport system! It was like $2.25 CAD to ride the bus, and you got transfer slips so that you didn't have to pay if you got on another bus or on the subway! ;)   That day we went to the CN Tower and Centre Island on a Fary Boat! It was so fun!  And that Night we went to a food bar to eat called&nbsp;"Town & Country." It was Great!   July 20, 2004 We got up early that day! And we took the car! We went to Casa Loma and also got lost on the way lol! But after Casa Loma we went to the TORONTO CITY ZOO and got rained out right as soon as we paid to get in! X( We lost a lot of mony on that one!   So we ended up going to the hotel. And I&nbsp;Swam in the pool from 6 to &nbsp;11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And there was so much chlorine in that pool i thought that my eyes were burning out of my head! Xl   July 21, 2004&nbsp; I got up that day to go home! lol  this is the exiting part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Food gets us into trouble now!!!  We were looking for a McDonalds because we thought that they might actually have breakfast food! lol  and we made a left hand turn onto Jane Streat from Wilson Avenue and an idiotic lady walked out in front of us! OMFG we were 10 Feet from the f'in' crosswalk! OMG and she just kept walking! We were going fast enough the if we wouldn't have slammed on the brakes we would have hit and killed her! well we slammed on the brakes and didn't hit her! OMG But we got hit!  I swear there has to be something wrong with me because everytime something bad happens I start speaking perfect English! I said "We've been Hit!" lol  The people that hit us were in a 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supream! and It didn't do much dammage to our 2001 Chevy Blazer because shear size difference! OMG yay! and there wasn't much dammage to their car but they were real nice! ;) THANK GOD!!! We called OnStar and they told us to just go report it to a collision reporting centre! OMG In America we can't move an accident! but I guess in Canada, as long as noone is hurt, you can!  BTW there were two little boys in that car! I felt so bad! one of them had a burn from the seatbelt on his neck and the other's seatbelt didn't lock and he hit the back of the driver's seat! OMFG He had a black Eye!  It made me feal so bad!   Oh well! We came home that day and ended up going through the wrong lane at the&nbsp;boarder and got sent to the US Imigration Center. lol&nbsp;Mom and Wendy had their driver's&nbsp;licences confescated&nbsp;so that we wouldn't leave and we just had to wait and then we got them back. ;)&nbsp;  I got sick about the time we reached Tridelphia and ended up throughing up by the time we reached the rest stop in St. Clairsville! OMG It hurt!   Well I am home now from that hecktic trip and I hope to be going back again soon. lol

      This is a real cool site i think just because of the colors and shapes in motion. (It looks cool) ;) I like this site because it tells about what colors mean in another culture, and I think that you could learn something from it. (Don't forget to right click and zoom in ;) (There is more to read than meats the eye ;)))

This ticks me off!  2-00P So I called Mom and she found someone (John Lucio) to milk with me, but that's still not so good! He will only maybe be able to keep me from falling behind. It is still going to be a lot of work. -------- I hate this farm and I wish I lived in town. X(  4-30P I set up AudioBlogger (For Voice Blogs) and Hello (For picture Blogs); I found that the audio number is from southern California :'( -- man this day is full of dissapointments! I guess I will use my cell phone to call it whenever I need to ;)  5-01P I got the cows in the barn to be milked and I fed them. It'll be another hour before John gets here; then I will have to milk. :'(   6-00P John Got here! He is so nice:) We milked cows and he helps a lot! I hated milking though. Dad better pay me a whole bunchu money! He said he would pay me some.  11-00P We've been done milking for a while now. I think we finished around 9-30P But I am still sore! :( OMG this day is so full of crap! Maybe if it starts out bad it can only get better. *:) So keep reading ;)  That's it. I am going to poast this and go to bed now. --- Well probably not right away but soon.
