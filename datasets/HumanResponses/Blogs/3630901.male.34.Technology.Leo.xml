      high volume on ECGI again today - 6.1M shares (avg 3.9M), up 9%.  Is this due to a pre-earnings run up for the end of the quarter, or is there M&A news?  I'm not sure, but still holding my shares.  I have standing sell orders in at $1 and $1.25.  The yahoo message board of course is going crazy with speculation.    I'm glad it's the end of the 2nd quarter of the year, for my e-trade account.  I needed at least 27 trades to keep my "power e-trade" status, where I pay $10/trade.  I had 36 trades for the quarter, and I'm more than happy to have the count reset for a new quarter.  The thing is, though, with my stocks so far down, I wonder if I'll really do any trading.  Maybe ECGI will run up faster than I expect, though.  The only problem with selling is knowing what to do with the proceeds.  In this case though, I should obviously pay down the HELOC debt.  Another alternative is to pay down the auto loan debt, but I'll be paying $280/month for the next 4 years on a 4.9% loan.  That's not too bad - comparable to my heloc rate.  Then again, it's possible that by the end of this quarter, i'll be out of the market altogether, having sold off everything to settle with L.

        Ki-lin  A mythical being of Chinese mythology, comparable with the western unicorn. Ki-lin personifies all that is good, pure, and peaceful. It lives in paradise and only visits the world at the birth of a wise philosopher.  The Ki-Lin is said to walk on earth and on water. It never drinks or eats dirty food or water. The Chinese unicorn never treads on smaller animals below its feet nor does it ever harm another living creature. The Ki-Lin is the emblem for exquisite goodness, longevity, grandeur, endless compassion and great wisdom. According to Chinese mythology, at the birth of Confucius a Ki-Lin appeared and Confucius died soon after a Ki-Lin was killed, he believed that his writings would not proceed from the omen of the death of the Unicorn.    urlLink   Which Chinese Mythological  Being  Are You?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      That's the word I was trying to think of.  Language is so cool, isn't it?  I always wished I took an epistemology course in college.  Or something about the development of language.  Then again, I probably would have had to read a lot and THINK and write papers.    I think about doing all that now, and I think, Ug.  I hate writing papers.  Introduction, 3 main points, discussion, conclusion.  And that's the basic paper.  Then there's the more advanced papers that just go on and on.  Supporting evidence.  What is it called with the footnotes ... I'll probably remember the word in another post ... where you reference works in your bibliography ... APA style.  Ah, I forget.  Too much LSD when I was younger I guess.    Now that was a good drug.  Hallucinations, staying awake all night, just visualizing cool things.  Fucking up my brain I guess.  But not addictive.  I remember going for walks in the neighborhood with friends while tripping.  So cool how the senses were so fucked up, or highly attuned, I never could be sure which.  I remember how different pockets of air smelled differently and had distinctly different temperatures.  Oh, and did I mention the hallucinations.  I was so fucking shy back then, so introverted.  I think I was probably trying to cope with all the changes going on in my life.  Between my parents divorce, their re-marriages, moving around the country, trying to make new friends.  I never was too good at that.  But no, no heroin -- I'd never try anythng addictive.  I liked oral drugs.  LSD on the tiny squares of paper.  Mushrooms once or twice.  Why can't I remember how many times?  Friends tried to get me to do marijuana first, but I had no interest in the smoke.  Oral is so much easier.  I guess LSD is bit more powerful, though.  The last trip I had though was bad ...  real bad ... where I was alone and depressed and feeling suicidal.  That was back in college when I tripped with a guy I hardly knew.  I thought were going to vegetate in his apartment all night ... instead, 30 minutes into our trip, he said, "let's go to a party!"  Just what I wanted -- to be around a bunch of strangers -- I probably would have felt even more alone there.  Or maybe my life would have changed dramatically in some distinct way.  Instead I walked back to my apartment.  Three other college people were walking across the library parking lot and made fun of me for being by myself.  Maybe they saw my dilated eyes.  Needless to say it didn't help my self esteem.  I went back to my aparment and sat in the dark listening to depeche mode's violator album.  Ah those were the days.  Back when I was still writing poetry.  Now I haven't written anything in nearly 5 years.  How can I still call myself a poet?  Will I ever hear the muse talking to me again?  Well that post went in a different direction than I expected.

      Can you imagine?  How did he stay warm enough to not freeze to death?  How desparate he must have felt trying to scratch at the ice.  How did he get there?  If he didn't die of exposure why didn't he try to walk somewhere?

      I'm angry about L saying that she thought there were problems with our marriage before we had kids, but that she thought by having kids it would fix those problems. I'm angry that she "settled" for me. I'm angry that I "settled" for her. I'm angry that when I said, "maybe we oughta get married some time," she took that as a wedding proposal and started to plan our wedding. I'm angry that I didn't do anything to stop her. I'm angry that while I was home taking care of the kids, she was out at her end of the school party last year, getting drunk and kissing some guy. I'm angry that she then proceeded to have an affair with him. I'm angry that I was oblivious to it all. I'm angry that I found out through email and when I confronted her I wasn't more direct. I'm angry that I didn't sue for divorce right then. I'm angry that I didn't kick her ass out of the house right then. I'm angry that she made a commitment to be true to me but she wasn't. I'm angry that she told me that she loved me but that she didn't the way I thought she did. I'm angry that I let myself get so attached to one person, to the relationship, to the idea of the relationship, that I blinded myself to all the problems we were having. I'm angry that while we were in counseling, after the affair, and we were ostensibly working out our problems, she decided it was okay to re-kindle the affair. I'm angry that she's having such an easy time of it dating many men. I'm angry that people don't seem to be interested in dating me. I'm angry that she's so readily jumped into the dating scene. I'm angry that this likely means she gave up on our relationship a while ago. I'm angry that I thought we could fix our relationship problems. I'm angry that my kids are going to have divorced parents. I'm angry that when she takes care of the kids, it frequently involves television. I'm angry that her fucking dog seems to have lost control of his bladder and pees on everything. I'm angry that she doesn't do an effective job cleaning up the dogs messes. I'm angry that she doesn't seem to care. I'm angry that she doesn't just hurry up and put the dog down. I'm angry that she doesn't want to fight for custody of the kids - that she'd give up custody so easily. I'm angry that she doesn't just move out of the house. I'm angry that she doesn't feel comfortable asking her parents for financial support. I'm angry that her cousin seems to think that I'm immature and may not be the best primary parent for our kids. I'm angry that her cousin was cool with me when we "happily married", but now she's turning out to be a bit two-faced. I'm angry that my ex-wife could lie so easily. I'm angry that the doctors don't know why my son has a seemingly constant skin irritation. I'm angry that the doctors have no solutions. I'm angry that the day care workers so readily point out problems with our kids. I'm angry that I seem to be the only one taking care of the house now. I'm angry that it's my sole responsibility to take care of the outside of the house -- the lawn, the weeds, the moles, the trees, the bushes, the cedar chips. I'm angry that L doesn't really do anything to take care of the house, except to pick up before the cleaning lady comes every two weeks. I'm angry that the garage is a mess. I'm angry that the previous owners left a bunch of their crap behind. I'm angry that I didn't do a more thorough inspection of the premises before purchasing the house. I'm angry that we didn't know about the gas pipeline running through the property. I'm angry that the gas company has dug up the pipeline twice in the two summers we've lived there. I'm angry that someetimes waterbugs get into the house. I'm angry that we may have termites. I'm angry that my garage door no longer works properly. I'm angry that the water softener never worked properly. I'm angry that the A/C unit the previous owners stated would cool the entire lower level does not cool the entire lower level. I'm angry that we don't have central air, that I have to install window units into vertical windows every year, and along with the a/c unit, I have to install plexiglass to block the rest of the open window. I'm angry that I don't know whether to sell the house or keep it. I'm angry that I get conflicting advice from friends and family. I'm angry that I love my kids too much to leave them. I'm angry that I can't just sell all my assets and go to a remote island for a couple years. I'm angry that I feel suicidal and/or really depressed at times. I'm angry that I'm not strong enough to go through with it. I'm angry that I have more things to say that I'm angry about but that I feel like I should end this blog entry.

      so I winked at like 50 people over the weekend.  I don't want to have to bother with email for so many people.  Personalizing each message?  Ug.  So I got two email responses so far.  I responded to them last night.  Maybe something will happen.  It was funny, after 10 winks, match started telling me that maybe I should send an email instead.  Am I ready to be in a new dating relationship?  Or dating casually, at all?  I don't know.  It's all a very new concept to me.  It's hard to imagine myself dating at all.  I see myself in a relationship -- not dating.  It's funny how some profiles say, "I love to have fun!"  No shit, who doesn't like to have fun?  It's a matter of what is fun.  For me, a bike ride or a hike is fun, a picnic on the beach can be fun.  Playing wiht my kids is fun.  I struggle with the idea of figuring out if a person is compatible with me while portraying myself in a good light, and oh yeah, having fun, too.  Maybe I'm just a pessimist, or a skeptic or a doubter.  Is physical attraction that important?  I'd like to say it isn't that it's what's inside that's important, but chemistry is important.  I don't think I'm really ready to portray myself as romantic and sexy and attractive, though.  I think I just want friendships now.  Sex would be great, too, of course.  My therapist says I shouldn't ask out my swim instructor or my yoga instructor because it will complicate those existing relationships.  Dean says fuck that - I can get a new instructor if I have to.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  With swim, it's all about trust, and I trust her now - I don't know if I could trust someone again.  My therapist thinks I need to heal before I date again.  I need to be comfortable with me.  I need my divorce to be resolved.    What I need is to get back into heroin.  Shoot up.  Hello bliss.  Goodbye world.  Hugo said I shouldn't be in such a hurry to get into another relationship.  I'm 33 now.  Let's say I live another 35 years ... why rush into sharing my life with someone else so soon.

      So the first date didn't go so well.  I waited at the restaurant for 20-25 minutes, and she didn't show up.  Some people think I didn't wait long enough, but how long am I supposed to wait?  Did she simply blow me off, or was she just running late?  I'll never know, I guess.  I left her a message at home and sent her an email - no response.  Things seemed so good via email.  Maybe I shouldn't have talked religion on our first phone conversation.    After leaving the restaurant I had gone home, and I guess L and the kids and just gotten home.  The kids were excited to see me but I was feeling very irritated (I don't know why).  L was upset that I wasn't more patient with them.  I changed into shorts and went out, not sure where to go, but feeling in the pits.  I thought about going to the beach in Milford or calling a friend or just going for a bite to eat by myself, but it all felt so depressing.  I was feeling a little suicidal.  I went to Dean's house and just dropped in.  I felt a little bad doing that, but I was really down, so I needed to see someone.  He did his best to make me feel better.  Then he said let's update your profile and update your pictures on the dating service.  So we did that -- he made it more fun, I guess.    Eventually he got tired of living the life a single guy through me and he kicked me out.  I went home, even though I should have probably wandered around or gone for a bite to eat or done something.  I don't know what.  I went home and L said, oh good your home - do you mind if I go out for a drink?  Whatever.  I just wanted to take an ambien and end the night.  I actually opened the bottle and fantasized about taking the whole bottle.  But I'm responsible now and I shouldn't have such thoughts.  Sunday we had a late breakfast with L's folks at Cracker Barrel.  It was good - I like that place, even though it doesn't lend itself to helping me with my attempts and vegetarianism.  I had poached eggs, fried catfish, buttermilk biscuits with honey, and ice water.  After breakfast I couldn't resist getting some chocolate covered malted milk balls.  Then L took the kids to the zoo, and I presumably went to look at houses.  I drove by some but then got a little bummed out and drove home.  I played computer games until around 1:30 and then decided maybe I should do some yardwork.  Just as I was getting started, L came home with the kids.  I mowed, trimmed and dug up the weeds.  At one point, I saw about a 5 foot long black snake on the rocks.  I showed it to L, as it was slithering down the rocks to under the deck.  I was a little nervous, but did a little more yardwork before taking a rest.  A real estate agent came at around 4:30 and meandered about in conversation, eventually telling us our house could sell for 400k.  After commissions and closing costs, I think we'd each get about 45k in profit.  That's not as much as I thought we'd get, and L was a little dismayed by it too.  But on the other hand, it would be that much cheaper to buy her out.  So now I feel like I'm at a crossroads again.  Maybe I should keep the house.  I bought the 05 Matrix today.  So much paperwork!  It's fun to drive but looks a little different from what I remembered -- less sleek, more boxey.  Oh well, it's just a car.  The free cell phone I was supposed to get required paperwork and won't be me for a week, and then I'll have to sign up for service.    I've also been trying to get ahold of our mediator to figure out what paperwork i have ot send back, but I haven't been able to get ahold of her.  I hope it's not too much of a problem.  I don't want to send the wrong thing.  Well, that's enough rambling for now.

      Thursday night, L said that kids had just gone to bed and had been asking for me, so I spent a little time with each before going to my room.  I had gotten a page from Jennifer at around 7pm.  She left me a voicemail at work saying sorry she missed me for my invite to a drink on Tuesday.  She said I could call her up until 10pm.  Dean had left a bunch of messages at home and at work, so I called him back first.  He got the new job, but something was amiss and he was feeling a little paranoid about the deal.  I told him not to worry about it -- what will be will be.    Email from jennifer asked what the visitation arrangement was with the kids (I had said every other weekend) -- which weekends did I have the kids?  I called her at home at 9:20 and got her voicemail.  Then I responded back in email that I was free Saturday, and was it too late to ask her out for Saturday night?    She emailed me back in the morning saying it was not too late to ask.  So we're going to dinner at Citrus in Milford, and then to fireworks in Branford.  I called her last night and we spoke for about 30 minutes, ironing out the plans and getting to know each other a little.   If it works out and we get along and we have some attraction to each other, then I have two of our next dates planned out already (maybe).  Camping trip with co-workers and friends weekend of 7/10.  Then a minor league baseball game with my kids on 7/23.  Maybe other dates in-between.  I'm probably getting ahead of myself.  I looked at her profile again, and saw a few things that would normally turn me off:  occasionally smokes, only a high school education.  We'll see.    I'm excited the L had to cancel her plans for tonight because she couldn't find a sitter for the kids.  We're going to breakfast with her parents tomorrow.  I'm doing laundry today and looking into putting our house on the market.

      My trip to Philadelphia was good, but short, and filled with a lot of traffic.  It took us about 4 1/2 hours to get there, mostly because we were sitting in traffic in New York, around the GW bridge.  Then it took us 4 hours to drive back, this time sitting in traffic around New Jersey.  Normally it should take about 3 hours each way.  I took Wednesday off instead of working a half-day as I'd originally planned.  It ended up that Mike took the whole week off, so we could have left earlier in the morning instead of at closer to 2.  He had also left me a message last Saturday to get directions to the hotel, but I never got the message.  His computer was down and he didn't have a number for the hotel, so we couldn't get directions.  So we drove back to my house to use my computer.  He drove, I navigated.  When we walked, I navigated.  He was sick but sometimes felt okay -- at least okay enough to eat steak and eggs on Thursday morning and okay enough to drink when we went to a club after the show.  Here's a rundown of our activities:  Arrive in Philadelphia, check into the hotel.  Walk to the show, stop for a quick bite at a sushi bar.  Get into the show -- my body was immediately immersed in and pounded by the bass by the band currently on-stage, Tweaker.  Mike looked at t-shirts but decided not to get a shirt right away - the lines were too short.  We walked in and took a spot near the stairs.  I saw people sitting on a radiator, and joined them.  The radiator was uncomfortable, but better than standing.  After Tweaker, they piped solo stuff from Cevin Key, with videos of nature on the screen.  Skinny Puppy eventually came on, the first four songs were from their new album, which I didn't really know or like.  Then they moved into songs from older albums, which the crowd loved, and I loved.  I already forget the playlist but it was very cool to hear them in concert.  Mike then stood in long lines for a t-shirt.  meanwhile I talked to some vegans at a booth to find out more about the vegan lifestyle.  then we walked across the street to Shampoo for an after hours show.  It was extremely crowded and loud and it's not like you could have a conversation, but there was great eye candy, watching all the goth girls.  After one drink, I was exhausted, and we took a cab back to the hotel.  after an ambien, I was asleep within 10 minutes   The next day, I woke early and journaled a little on scraps of paper.  Then I got bored and went for a walk.  When I got back, Mike said he was feeling better.  We walked to breakfast, where he got steak and eggs.  I never heard of anyone eating steak for breakfast (I guess I've lived a sheltered life).  I got a raspberry-banana smoothie and french toast with banana compote -- it was great.  Then I waited outside while mike went to the bathroom.  then we walked toward historical philadelphia.  About halfway there, Mike said let's turn back, he was feeling sick.  So we turned back, went back to the hotel, he went to the bathroom again.  Then we got the car and started driving out of the city.  I said, hey let's just stop at 526 S 5th Ave for the industrial music store.  I got a thing with remembering number I don't know way.  We got there a little before 12, and they weren't open yet.  So we went to a progressive, independent bookstore.  I looked for a book on domestic terrorism, but didn't find anything I liked.  then I found books on veganism, and bought one recommended by the girl running the store.  Mike bought some progressive magazines.  At Digital Ferret, I bought a CD with previously un-released 16 volt stuff, an Industrial Nation mag, the new Chem Lab, a DVD of Skinny Puppy videos, and a cd with that mitsubishi-commercial song, 'days go by'.    Then Mike was feeling better, so we walked to see the liberty bell.  once there, another trip to the bathroom for mike while I watched kids play soccer on the field outside.  Then we saw the liberty bell.  Pretty cool.  there was a whole exhibit outside, but we didn't spend much time there, because we were concerned about the parking meter running out of time, and we wanted to get on the road relatively soon.  Then we went to City Tavern (Est 1773) for lunch.  Great lunch, nice atmosphere.  Shouldn't have ordered dessert while mike was in the bathroom again.  On the road.  Plotted an alternate route to the GW bridge via 287.  Stuck in traffic in NJ.  That was basically it.  I would like to go back to visit again maybe for a weekend or something.

      I think it's about time I do another mind map.  I do a mind map which shows me where I am in my life.  What is my foundation for life?  What are my relationships?  What are my short and long term goals?  What is the meaning of life at this moment?  How do I embrace life?  How do I embrace my life?  How do I embrace the future and the past?  How do I live in the present?  How do I be me?  Who am I?  Sometimes it's hard to fight the desire to commit suicide.  It's so inviting.  The end of everything.  Pain.  Grief.  Suffering.  Yeah, and happiness and joy and all that bullshit, too.  What keeps me going mostly is my kids.  That and I think that while things are dark and I'm in the pit right now, things will get better some day.  Maybe I'm just deluding myself, though.  I think a better alternative to suicide is drastic change.  Another alternative is a fantastic adventure.    Adventure is just one step away.

      Think you're being a non-conformist?  Think you're somehow unique and different from everyone else?  Good luck with all that.  It's an illusion.  There is no unique, there is no different - maybe just different combinations of choices in life that form the "unique" you.  If you strive to be different, trust me, you're still conforming in some ways.  Conforming to cultural and social standards.  You can't help but be a consumer in this culture.  Some companies specifically market to the counter-culture, such that the counter-culture is a culture in itself.    For example, tattoos, body piercing, body modification of any kind is an attempt to be different.  But really people see other people who have modified their bodies, and they want to be like these other people.  Simply waving hello to someone, or nodding your head, or whatever - these are culturally accepted standards of behavior.  Imagine instead when someone says hello to you, that you respond with something random and unexpected.  People might think you're a little crazy.  But if you continue to respond to hello in this way, you are now conforming to a new code of behavior.  What does it mean to live life fully?  To enjoy life?  To enjoy living?    Whenever I go to a restaurant and order food, I am at odds with myself over different things, like the cost of the meal, what I want to eat (I never really know), what's good for me, I'm at such odds with myself that I change my mind frequently, never really happy with what I've chosen, always thinking I should have gotten something else.  Will I like what I'm getting?  Maybe it's good to eat something that I don't like, just for the experience of it.  Like eating octopus tentacles, for their chewy texture and odd feeling in the mouth.    Should I just get whatever I'm familiar with?  What if this place doesn't prepare it the way I like it though?  I find that a lot with salmon - restaurants frequently overcook it, leaving it a little too tough.  Fish can be so delicate to cook.  Maybe I should eat vegetarian, because what right do I have over the animals to eat them.  How barbaric!  Maybe I shouldn't use any animal products or any products that have been tested on animals, because it's inhumane.  But do I really want to spend my life trying to keep in mind what's been tested on animals - only consuming from certain companies that are conscious of animal rights?  Is that what my life is about?    How should I spend the time that I have on this earth?  I waste so much time.  So much.  Watching TV - movies at night, porn, masturbating.  It's very enjoyable at the time, but I don't really gain any value from it.  I play computer games - that a big time sink.  I sit at work surfing the web, blogging, reading and writing email, checking my stock quotes, reading stock message boards.  Oh yeah, and I work once in a while, too.  I haven't really worked - and I mean worked - a 40 hour week in I don't know how long.  So what the fuck am I doing at work?  I'm getting paid for sitting on my ass basically wasting my time and doing a couple of work-related tasks -- just enough to get by.  Then again, maybe my manager is out of touch with what's really going on.  It would be cool to be doing something self-expressive, something artistic with my life.  But then I might be stuck in a different rut - stuck in the rut of having no money and not being able to afford decent housing for me and my kids.  Not being able to afford nice vacations.  Not being able to afford netflix and cable tv and a broadband connection to the net.  I need broadband so I can remote into work occasionally and do real work.  Mostly I need broadband for porn.  It's sad, isn't it.  I guess I'm addicted.  So many addictions, so little time.

      ECGI is up nicely today.  If my trade had gone through at .45, I would have likely sold some at around .55.  Would have been a tidy little profit.  Instead, I'd pulled my money out to buy the car.  Oh well.  Oh yeah, it's also up on high volume - 10M shares traded today, currently up .58, trading up 20%.  Up on high volume usually means good things.  I've heard before that precedes price.  The big question is whether it closes near the high for the day, and whether the volume continues at it's current rate.  If the price and volume drop off near the end of the day, the tomorrow doesn't look as good.  In the meantime, other stocks aren't moving much, and RCO is down .02.  Green day overall so far, though.

      It was a great trip on Saturday.  It was supposed to be a 25 mile bike ride, but it turned out to be closer to 32.  A lot of fun, but at times I got fed up with the group and the close-clustering of bikes - happens frequently on group rides.  On the way back, I got ahead of the group, then waited at the top of a hill, but they never came -- waited a good 5 minutes.  Then I thought maybe I'd taken a wrong turn, or they went a different route, and should I go back and try to find them?  I was low on water and getting tired already, so I figured I'd just go on ahead.  The only problem was I wasn't exactly sure which way to go.  But I made it back alright.  I thought for sure the group would be there already, eating lunch, but I was waiting a good 5-10 minutes before they started to arrive.    Weather-wise it was nearly perfect -- overcast in the morning, but the fog burned off by late morning / noontime.  We rode from Pat's condo through Milford, Orange, and to West Haven -- all along the shoreline, mostly flat.  It was so relaxing.  She's got a condo right on the beach.  I ate lunch on the seawall, looking out on the sound.  Her mom also brought out watermelon for everyone and tuna salad for sandwiches.  I couldn't get enough watermelon, until I realized I ate too much.  Nonetheless, we soon got underway for the kayak trip for the afternoon.  I was a little unsure of myself and how steady the kayak would be, but soon enough I was comfortably paddling along.  I kept up with the group pretty well at first, but soon grew tired.  At one point two people turned and went back  ... they later reported that they saw the rest of us paddling but not going anywhere -- that must have been where we had a head wind and were going up-current -- it was quite frustrating.  Kayaking around was a lot of fun, but it was tiring, and I fell behind the rest of the group.  I wanted to just sit out on the water and relax and watch birds, but I felt I should try to catch up.  That afternoon, L told me that Ivy was at her parent's house, while Aidan stayed at home.  I got him up from his nap, played with him outside, walked down to the check the mail, and then he an L had some dinner.  I cleaned up my office, which was a pigsty, so that it would be at least half-presentable.  After dinner, Aidan came into my office and we played together, while L went down to her dungeon to do phone and email and match.  I re-discovered an Opus III CD while Aidan zoomed a lego car around.  I would have loved to play with Aidan for longer, but I had friends coming over for poker night, so I got him ready for bed.  While I was reading him a story, the first visitor arrived, and L was uncormfortable enough where she finished with Aidan while I entertained my guest.  Poker was a lot of fun, too -- guys from work and Dean played.  I was up for most of the night, but then lost near the end, as I started to get bleary eyed and had trouble concentrating (or maybe I just started losing) - down $10 for the night.  Not bad for an evening of entertainment with friends.    Father's day was a bit of a letdown in comparison to Saturday.  I worked a little in the morning, and then wasted time playing a computer game until L got home with Ivy and Aidan from breakfast with her folks at the diner.  L then wanted to clean up the house, so I took the kids outside and played with them in the tent.  I also did a little weeding on the front walk.  We then went inside, and I was feeling very irritable / antsy.  So while L watched the kids I went out for an hour.  I was going to go to the grocery store to buy a few things - and L gave me a list of things she wanted - but instead I drove around Milford, looking at potential houses.    L had dinner ready when I got home, but was upset that I hadn't gone to the store.  I didn't give an explanation.  After dinner, I played with the kids some more and L got ready for her date.  She left at some point - I didn't hear her say she was going.  I put Aidan to bed first, then I got Ivy ready and then we went outside to sleep in the tent.  I read her a few stories, and tried to lay down in the tent, buy my allergies were killing me.  So Ivy suggested we go back in.  I put her to bed, and then played on the computer for a little while, before watching six feet under.

      Did anyone else get this?  I got an invitation in the mail to go to Washington, DC, to have dinner with the president.  Sponsored by the republican party.  I'm not a republican, so I don't know why I got this piece of mail.  Oh, and if I want to go to the dinner, I just have to make a donation of $150 or more.  That food must be really good!  I wonder if they'll foot the bill for the airfare.    I'm thinking of buying Robert Reich's new book,  urlLink Reason: Why Liberals Will Win the Battle for America , to get better educated about how the republicans are duping the American voters.  The majority of American's are non-voters who generally have liberal values:  belief in separation of church and state, that taxation and wealth should be more equally distributed, and everyone should have fair access and fair opportunity.  It's funny, whenever I talk to Christians, they believe that the majority of Americans believe in a Christian God -- they may even believe that this majority includes practicing Christians -- people who attend church on a regular basis.  Personally, I think most American celebrate Jewish or Christian holidays, because that's how they were raised, and they consider themselves Christian (or Catholic) or Jewish, but they don't truly believe or they don't truly practice.  It's scary to me that Bush says he talks to God, and gets direction from God.  First off that's a little crazy, maybe it appeals to some fanatical religious people.  But mostly, it's a bit scary, that he feels he's doing what morally right and what God wants him to do.  He also talks about the military like it's his own personal army.  I'm going to send more troops to Iraq ... I'm going to send more troops to Afghanistan.  Even the Pope is against the war, but Bush seems to ignore that.  The Pope's view doesn't gibe with Bush's so Bush ignores the Pope.  Not that I put a lot of value in the pope.  It's scary that we pre-emptively attacked Iraq, and that some democrats approved giving Bush the power to declare war.  Why is congress giving up it's powers?  If Bush is president for another 4 years, the American life as we know it will completely cease to exist (it's already on the way out with things like the PATRIOT act).  Speaking of the PATRIOT act, I think it's quite clever (maybe conniving is a better word) for them to create an acronym spelling PATRIOT, when the act really has nothing to do with patriotism.  It's really about giving up individual freedoms and more government control.  And it's scary that Bush has pushed for massive tax cuts for the rich, while pushing more responsibilities onto the states.  Now the states can't handle the new financial responsibilities, and they have to make cuts in other programs -- number of teachers, teacher pay, school programs, state government workers, countless other things that I'm not aware of.  I don't know if Kerry will be any better.  But I'm definitely in the "anybody but bush" camp.  Personally, I like Kucinich (who opposed the war with Iraq), and I'd consider voting for an independent, if I thought they realistically had a chance to win in this two party system -- either someone from the Green party or the Libertarian party.

      So I didn't realize all the stuff that goes into buying a car.  The car guy called me up and asked when I could take delivery.  I thought, "cool, they're going to deliver it to my house - now that's convenient!"  That makes the 'destination charge' make sense.  But no, I go to the dealership to pick it up.  It's supposed to be there tonight, but I got Yoga tonight, watching the kids tomorrow night, saturday is the hiking/kayak trip, sunday they're closed.  So it look like monday.  Which is fine.  But in order to do the down payment, they can't take a personal check - they need a bank check.  So I deposited funds from my brokerage account, and the bank said the funds would be available after 3 business days -- Tuesday!  Well that doesn't work so well.    Then, Wednesday and Thursday next week I'll be in Philadelphia.  So what, Tuesday -- I don't know if Tuesday works for me.  I could put the down payment on the credit card - up to $3k, they said.  Maybe I'll do that, and transfer the brokerage funds somewhere else.  I also had to call the insurance company and get the new vehicle on my insurance.  Plus the dealership does credit check on me to determine what percentage I can get on the loan -- probably 4.5%.  If I'd moved faster, and bought in April, they still had the 1.9% deals going ... but then no 05.  Whaddayagonna do?  I also talked to E-trade yesterday, to extend my HELOC -- I'll close on that in about two weeks -- they bumped my limit up to $100k.  Crazy numbers, really.  But I can use that credit line to help pay off L's portion of our marital assets.  I just imagine the house will be a great investment that will really pay off in 5 years.  Much better than I could do in the stock market!  Last night's hike was good.  It was just me and another guy, Darren.  We talked a lot about relationships, work, camping, hiking, and religion.  It was exhausting and my left boot was causing me a blister again.  Maybe I'll buy new boots.  I've thought that before the divorce is finalized, I should spend money needed to fix up aspects of the house -- that's fair, right?  Fix the garage door, the trim outside the garage door, haul away all the crap the previous owners left behind (maybe rent a small dumpster for a week), get the water softener fixed, get the furnace checked out.  I've also thought about buying a dish and flatware set that I like, and maybe a new pot/pan set.  That way L can take all the old stuff.  At swimming on Tuesday, I had trouble concentrating on the lessons, because I kept trying to think of a way to ask the instructor out to dinner.  Is it too soon?  Is she really involved with someone else, or is that just something to put guys off?  It could just be a friendly dinner.  I am attracted to her, and it's also partly that I want to have a date, or appear to have a date -- I don't know why -- to affect L in some way.

       urlLink The Fight of Our Lives   sheesh.  Makes me want to move to another country, or be like  The Kid  from Box of Moonlight - "I'm off the fuckin' grid, man!"  In a way, he was living the life, but he also didn't get to have all this great STUFF that we wage slaves get.  Isn't being a consumer great?  I'm glad I have kids, because they can be trained to be little consumers now (especially by my shop-aholic ex-wife).  Or they can be crazy granola anti-tv, anti-consumerism, vegetarian cast-outs raised by their dad who's full of wacky ideas.  It's hard not to feel powerless.  Sometimes I feel that I just want to get by and eke out my existence.  I feel financially burdened, but hopefully it will just be a temporary feeling that will subside with time.  Hopefully my advisors are right when they say that my best investment will be my house.    The best thing I can do to not think about all this crap is to do what I enjoy.  Is that hedonistic?  Yesterday after work I took a swimming lesson, mowed the lawn, visited friends, and watched "Monsoon Wedding".  I had borrowed Monsoon Wedding from NetFlix, but halfway through, at chapter 11, the thing went haywire and didn't play on 3 different dvd players.  I never had these kinds of problems with VCR tapes and I still wonder how much better DVD's really are.  Maybe I just have to get a home theater system to experience the true power of DVDs.  But there I was, halfway through the movie, and what was I going to do?  Return the movie to NetFlix and wait a week to get a new copy?  No, I went to the library and borrowed it for FREE.    Yeah, so I love movies.  It's a good way to pass the time.  And I feel that that's all I'm doing lately - passing the time.  It's depressing, I guess.  Tonight I'll go hiking, and tomorrow night is yoga.  But I'm really just passing the time.  I guess it boils down to being pleasurable, possibly a chance to make new friends, and good for my health.  We do everything for a reason, right?  So what other meaning is there in my life?  Raising my children.  Becoming healthier by eating right, exercising and losing weight, so that I can be healthy and enjoy life more.    Maybe what I'm really doing is trying to cope with getting divorced and all the personal and financial hell I'm facing.

      money really is everything, isn't it?  Well, I mean it's really just an abstract concept with such real consequences in this capitalistic society, but I digress.  My upcoming divorce boils down to money.  How much are our marital assets worth?  The house, stocks, my retirement savings, her retirement savings, furniture, our "savings" account, and what money we owe on the heloc and the car.  Hopefully, at most, we split everything 50-50 and walk away from our relationship.  Then we just have to deal with the complications of custody and the kids, and I have to figure how I can pay for everything with just my salary, while she in turn pays for everything of hers with just her salary.  Housing in our area has skyrocketed, so I decided (with the advice of others, of course), that it would be best if I stayed in the house.  That will also mean less of an impact on the kids, which I think is important.  I mean, Ivy freaked out when I was simply moving furniture around in my bedroom.  Although I gotta say that the new layout is great,with the bed under the window, so I get fresh evening breezes -- only the ceiling fan is not lined up right -- I hardly feel it now -- maybe it's time for a free-standing fan.  So anyway, I have to figure out how I can keep paying my monster mortgage plus, the bills, and the new car.  And since she'll only be taking a portion of her share of the marital assets, I'll have to figure out a payment plan to ensure she gets the rest of it.  I'll use the HELOC to get more immediate access to funds needed so that she can move out.  But in the end, it's all just money.  I have to keep telling myself that.  I have to change my 401(k) contributions so that I'll get more money in my paycheck so that I can pay all the bills I have to pay.  The next question is, how should I pay for the matrix?  Should I tap the heloc (2.99% interest rate for the first 90 days!), should I sell stocks for a loss, or should I finance it through other means?

      Am I a fool?  Yes, I suppose I am.  ECGI dropped again on high volume, to as low as .44, then started to bounce back.  So what did I do?  I put in an order to buy more at .45 - not sure if it will get filled, but I think it's bottomed.  Of course, I thought the same thing when I picked up more shares last week (or was it 2 weeks ago), at .61.

      Everything is down today of course.  Fears of inflation spurs the fed to consider increasing interest rates which causes people to sell in the stock market, driving prices down.  All my stocks except EMA are down.  Some day it will all turn around and I'll be up again.  Until then I'll just keep regretting not selling when I had the chance.    I'm waiting for a positive profitable quarter and possible merger and acquisition news from ECGI.  I'm waiting for news of funding (independent of further stock dilution) and news of contracts and/or profits from RCO.  Those are my two biggest holdings.    I'm of course tempted to buy more of both RCO and ECGI, with the scant money I have left, but deep down I think may retreat further.

      I was just fantasizing about owning a new car -- I've had my 1994 tercel for, well, nearly 10 years now.  My first car was a honda civic, I think (or an accord).  I paid too much for it, and it needed repairs before it was road-ready.  I kick myself for not looking at that other guy's toyota.  Anyway, I was at the dealership over the weekend, and the salesman gave me a "fuck you" price of $200 for the trade-in.  I told him in that case I wouldn't be trading it in.    I then talked to another guy today who said that well, the first guy didn't really give it an appraisal, so it wasn't really accurate.  I told him Kelly Blue Book said $1300 trade-in value, and he said "we'll see".  I think I'll hold onto it.  I saw the 94 tercel advertised for sale in the neighborhood of $2k, so I think it's worth it to sell it privately.  Or maybe just hold onto it for whenever I need a spare car or if my parents come to visit.  It's worth more than I thought it was, and maybe I'll sell it after the divorce so I can keep the money.    I also test drove a mazda3 (5 door), and I thought about the new 2005 Ford Focus (5 door).  See, I got kids and it's a lot easier loading and unloading them for a 4 door car than a 2 door car (Tercel).  And the hatchback is good for hauling gear.  Someday I'll really go on a camping trip.  The Mazda was a little more expensive but peppier.  The focus has an mp3 player option, better financing options, and is a little less expensive than the matrix.  But I'm reluctant to buy American - Japanese just seems more reliable to me.  Anyhow the ford dealership doesn't seem to have the five door in stock, and I'm tired of waiting and shopping and second-guessing.  I want to buy now.

      I've taken a beating in the stock market, especially compared to last year when I was up $17k.  I made that money mostly by borrowing against my heloc to buy microcaps.  I hit it big with CTXS, ATYT, and BFUN.  Each of these tripled, at least.  Chris Lahiji had reviewed 12000 microcap annual reports and recommended a bunch. I chose a handful, and they really paid off.  This year, however, I'm down as much as I was up last year.  And after paying off the heloc, I borrowed against it again!  RCO was trading at around .70, and I bought more!  What the fuck was I thinking?  Averaging up?  Jesus.  Next time I think about averaging up I have to remember to sell.  Sell 50 to 80 percent of my holdings.  Take profits.  Take the fucking money off the table.  I was up about 20k unrealized earlier this year, and I got greedy, thinking I could make even more.  I was looking the wrong way, which I appear to be prone to do.  Nonetheless, I'm planning on putting myself further into debt (real debt, though), by buying a  urlLink 2005 Toyota Matrix   I think I might have a gambling problem.  But it could also be a "I don't give a shit" problem.  Where sometimes I lose a lot of money or make stupid decisions (both in present-sight and hind-sight) because I really don't care about the outcome.  Of course, I end up caring, a lot, later.  Linking the heloc with my brokerage account was probably not a good idea, even though I did make out great last year.  So anyhow, my portfolio currently consists of: RCO, ECGI, IBZT, CDED, AVR, EMA, and USTT.   They are all microcaps, and trading under a dollar.  I have too optimistic hopes, and they'll likely be dashed.  But maybe I like how my dad put it -- that my wife will take 50% of my losses if I lose money.  Maybe I should feel a little good about that.  I'd rather she share in the profits, but then again, fuck her.

      Yeah, I got netflix.  Very convenient.  Much better than paying late charges at blockbuster, easier to browse for movies, better selection than the library.  So over the weekend I just watched The Cider House Rules, which I'd seen before, remembered it was good, and decided to watch again.  It was still good the second time.  I think it got some oscars.  For some reason, those tend to be good movies.  I also watched The Closet, a hilarious french movie with english subtitles about a bore of a man about to get fired because he's so boring.  Gee, I can relate to that -- it's not because he's boring, but that he doesn't really talk to people at work.  I thought it was neat to see the office hell lifesteyle in French.  I also have Monsoon Wedding but didn't quite get around to watching that.  So I just returned the first two and should be getting two more later this week.  I'm thinking of mixing up my queue so that I get Mostly Martha and Better Luck Tomorrow next.  Oh yeah, this is my first post.  I wonder if anyone will stumble on me like I stumbled on Merthin.  I was thinking about how much I loathe my wife (soon to be ex-wife, I guess).  I don't want to get into it now, but I googled "loathe", and bumped into his blog.  I should thank him.  Maybe I'll start expressing myself every day.  I thought about writing a journal every day, but usually I do that for a day or two and then skip a few months and admonish myself for having such a weak will.

       So I'm keeping the house. I'll re-finance the mortgage. I called e-trade yesterday and after some discussion, we settled on:   re-finance original loan for $295k, 5/1 ARM (interest only), 5.375% initial rate. Also, HELOC will be reduced to max of $50k (from recently increased $100k), with a balance of roughly $40k. Payment will be $1321 interest and $376 escrowed taxes and insurance, for a total of $1697. Payment on the heloc will be roughly $180. Total is about $1900. That's not bad at all -- my current payment is about $2100. I thought for sure I'd be paying more.   But the catch is the 5/1 ARM. After 5 years, the interest rate will jump a bit. So the plan is, either re-finance or sell within 5 years. I'm sure my picture will be considerably clearer within 4 years.    The Long View   Sept 05 - Kid1 starts K, 1/2 time in daycare.  Sept 06 - Kid1 starts public school, kid2 starts K, 1/2 time in daycare.  Sept 07 - Both kids in public school   So I'll pay strictly interest for the first year, maybe the first 2 years. Then I'll be able to start making significant payments toward the principle. I'll also be able to start putting money into my retirement again, and start building the kids college funds. After a year, I will also look into making improvements to the house, with the idea that I'll stay there longer than 5 years.    Plans for the house    Put in a shed beneath the front steps   Get a jungle gym for the kids   Tear down the deck, have it re-designed with meandering pathways and rebuilt with eco-friendly materials.   Get central air conditioning   Build a patio at the side of the house, complimenting the deck   Build a room below the deck as an outdoor / 3 season patio   Build a gazebo, steps / pathways going down from patio and/or deck   Get a hot tub and a small in-ground pool in the patio   Build a treehouse or playhouse for the kids   Re-paint the outside of the house   Get better storage options for inside garage, get outside door installed to garage   Get professional landscaping   re-decorate the living room - paint the walls, get some art   re-decorate the kitchen - hardwood floor, new counters, new sink   enlarge master bath, remove walk-in closet, put in 2-person jacuzzi tub and larger windows   If nothing else, the house will be a great investment opportunity. Wow, I look at that list, and start envisioning my house in a few years and I really like what I see. Why would I want to sell?

      Hmmmm. I'll try to re-capture my fleeting thoughts.   Am I afraid of being alone? No. Not to get philosphical, but ultimately, each of us is alone. I think we're all trying to find someone to share our life experience with. So while I'm not afraid to be alone, I would prefer to be sharing my life with someone beyond just myself.   We each came to meet one another most likely not at our ideal time. I was originally focused on my situation and my history and my baggage (for lack of a better word), which I guess is natural, because I see the world from my viewpoint, primarily. But my main concern, was whether or not I was ready and whether or not I was good enough for you and a relationship with you.&nbsp;   I mean of course I'm always judging what's going on around me, seeing how it fits into my world. But I didn't originally think about whether or not you were ready for a relationship, or your situation and history, or your baggage.&nbsp; More of that stuff has come out -- how he wounded you, and how you're coping with your past (relationships, childhood, parents, friendships) -- all the things that you're dealing with, and likewise, you're trying to see how I fit into your world.   The key is for each of us to be completely honest with ourselves and with each other about everything we're feeling. And that's rarely easy to do. You were right when you said that I married young -- I definitely rushed into it -- and constantly regretted it. I'm going to be more careful this time around. That means a longer dating period.   The key for me is to look beyond my infatuation to determine whether or not we'll be good, long term, as mates. Laima was my first, real, long term relationship. I was infatuated and I rushed into marriage. Actually, I was just excited that I found someone who was actually interested in me.&nbsp; So while I'm looking beyond the infatuation, I'm also working at not losing sight of, or failing to experience those very infatuation-related feelings (because they feel great!)   I've really enjoyed our dating so far. I feel really comfortable with you and I feel like you're looking out for my best interests. I feel free. I mean we went away together for the weekend and had a great time. I was sick on Saturday and you were still accepting of me. I don't recall having those feelings with L, or particularly enjoying our dating back then.   There is some small part of me that is afraid of getting betrayed again -- of putting too much trust into another individual. But that's all about me, and nothing about you. What I mean by that is that there is nothing you can say or do that will help me with these feelings, and it has nothing to do with who you are or what you've done in your past. It's more of an issue that I need to work on.   At some point we'll stop seeing the world so much from our individual perspectives and we'll start seeing the world from our couple perspective. As a team we'll tackle problems together, we'll experience life together, we'll share our individual experiences with each other, we'll grow together.   Well, I think I've rambled on enough, and gone in enough different directions.

      S and I were sitting on a park bench talking to her mom.  Earlier, in private, I had been honest and forthcoming with her mom about S and I, my marital situation, how we were in love.  Now her mom was grilling us, or at least upset with us for rushing into things.  S looked over at me with a pained look on her face, saying that I'd ruined everything.  ---------------------------- I called S to discuss the dream with her.  She thought it was really weird because she and Mo had talked the night before about what story we should tell her siblings and her mom.  They agreed that total honesty could wait until later with regards to her mom, but her sister could be told the truth.  For example, "how long have you been divorced?"  That would be an awkward one!  S said that her family wants to meet me.

      Therapy meeting was good.  She's happy with my progress made on divorce agreements (50/50 split of assets, no alimony, shared custody, $60k "gift" is advance on divorce settlement, half of my retirement will go to L for a portion of the settlement).  While none of this is actually signed, I do have email from L to the mediator with the email conversation.  S and I are in love.  We went to a reggae fest in RI over the past weekend.  I was sick on Saturday afternoon, but I think we still had a great time.  It was the best concert I'd ever been to -- 8 hours of music, good food and drink, and of course great company.  We had our palms read, and while normally I see psychics as a bunch of hooey, this one was right on about my personality and my earlier life experiences.  So when she made some forecasts for my future, I listened attentively.   Therapy Homework / Issues   self confidence   stay open to possibility - don't rush to judgement about anything   Trust - watch out for blind trust, have reasoned trust   Stay true to myself - do what I want to do, say what I want to say, feel what I want to feel

      I don't remember many dreams, but I just woke up from this one: &nbsp;  so i just woke from this dream, where S, my brother (not sure if it was&nbsp;P or another 'brother') and I were sitting outside a house on a driveway, kind of facing this cement wall, leaning on a 45 degree angle, kind of like an aqueduct. There were wood chips covering the wall, hiding it. The sky looked ominous, like immediately before a summer thunderstorm, or immediately after. The wall stretched down to infinity, down a hill, into the ocean, but it was not all covered with the wood, just the part near the driveway. My brother was about to sweep off the wall and I asked what he was doing - the wood chips looked good. He said it would be better to sweep it off and maybe paint something on the wall. I commented to S, sometimes he's such an asshole. Then I reflect on how my brother always got the girl that I was interested in. She was my friend, dammit. We'd been friends for years, and I really felt a lot of love for her, even though she was in a relationship with my brother. I moved away from the wall, as the brother proceded to sweep it. I was on the deck / porch of a house and I asked S to come talk to me. I was about to tell her that I wished she were with me, when I woke up and realized that she is already with me.

      I was recently reading over some of the poetry I'd written around the time of my getting married, and after the marriage.  I remember feeling like I made a big mistake and that I wanted to get out.  I think I kept having those kind of thoughts for about 5 years.  When I think about that, I think that maybe a higher power was communicating through my poetry, but I ignored it.  I remember being very unhappy in the marriage.  In August 1993, I moved to connecticut In November 1993, we announced our intention to get married On 12/4/1993, I wrote Flash in the Pan, about love burning brightly at first and then fading, and me leaving.   On 2/16/1994, I wrote Lost Shoes, about searching for a new path, and temptation to get away On 10/10/1994, I wrote Union about our marriage and relationship (positive, for public consumption) On 10/15/1994, we got married.  I remember thinking that if it doesn't work out I could always get a divorce On 6/24/1995, I wrote Dark Reflections, about dwindling passions, time passing us by, dreams becoming memories On 8/12/1995, I wrote Secret Writings [Part I], about whether it's better to leave someone or to die.  On 8/24/1995, I wrote Clarity, about someone coming to me and telling me that  it's up to me  and that  it's my life .  I remember thinking about divorce then. On 9/17/1995, I wrote two - Divided and Mask.  One about how different L and I were, and one about how I had already fled the relationship. On 9/19/1995, I wrote They Slept On, how we knew of our differences but both decided to ignore them and try to keep it together.  There were other poems, too reflecting a general feeling a disquiet, between 1996 and 1999 -- but they were vaguer and I can't specifically point to them and say they were about my relationship.  Did I become comfortable, or did I feel I'd said all there was to say?  So then I think about how my poetry dwindled after that.  Like the muse had tried to tell me things, but I decided not to heed the voice.  Then in 1999, we decided to adopt.  For me, at that point, everything changed.  Somehow things were more positive (I guess).  I stopped writing poetry until 2002, writing 3, and then stopping again until I wrote two last week.  So as I look back on my marriage, and on past relationships, I think about how I pull out of a relationship, emotionally, mentally, but I don't take the steps to end it.  It's like I'm just waiting the other person out.  It's been a bit of an eye-opener for me.  Maybe I'll post these poems.  Depression = rage turned inward.  That makes perfect sense.  I wanted to get out of the relationship, didn't do anything about it, and was angry with myself for letting it go on as long as it had.

      I had tried a new template, didn't like it, and switched back to my original, I think.  The new template made font sizes too big, I felt it was nearly unreadable.  It also contained html code for links and stuff, but I really don't need that on my blog site.  Let's see, what's been going on in my world?  Geez my last real post was 7/14.    Um.  S and I are still together, still talking daily - via phone and email, still wishing we could see each other more often.  Will we go the distance?  Time will tell, but we both have a strong feeling about it.  Her therapist is much more supportive of her than mine is of me.  But maybe mine is looking out for my best interests.    Thursday night I had yoga, then worked for about 40 minutes, moving a server from one rack to another, then went on to S's house.  I had lied to L that I wasn't seeing S - I was seeing someone else.  S made me grapes, cheese, salmon, and potatoes for a late dinner.  Then we hung out in her room, talking, kissing, fooling around, and eventually sleeping.  The next morning I said that I should get back home to help get the kids up.  She was visibly upset, and I told her, "if you ask me to stay, I'll stay."  I had to repeat this before she asked.  I stayed.  While she got ready, I took the dog for a walk, and called L.  "I ended up sleeping over at Michelle's house, so I won't be around to help get the kids up this morning."  I felt so cool lying like that, like oops, I let her name slip out.  I don't know if she took the bait.  I was about 30 minutes late for work, but it was great being with S.  Friday night, L went out, taking Ivy to a rennaissance festival in Ansonia.  I was meeting with realtors discussing how much they thought they could sell the house for, and what houses I could look at over the weekend.  Then L came in, saying that her friend was waiting in the car, dumping a cranky Ivy in my lap to put to bed.  Gee, that was a little awkward, I had guests!  And the fucking realtors were taking their sweet time.  I should have told them to shut the fuck up, give me the bottom line and let me put my daughter to bed.    My whole body was aching and I had a migraine coming on - not a lot of fun.  The fucking realtors were on their way out, but were talking to me from outside, with the front door open.  Bugs were flying in, annoying me to no end.  I put Ivy to bed, and then I called Lisa, who had returned my call -- I'd asked her to go with me and the kids to the baseball game next Friday.  She was excited about the trip she'd taken to Omega Institute, where she roomed with a bitch who ignored the rules of no smoking and no alcohol, and was in emotional therapy for her week.  Lisa was much more balanced, and in for sign language.  Sounds like she had a great time.  She agreed to go to the baseball game, so I'm really happy about that.  It's really a huge relief for me.  One because I'm not a big baseball fan (that is, I never watch), and two because I was concerned about taking my two kids to the game by myself.  Lisa is so great.  Just as I was hanging up with Lisa, S was calling on my cell.  She wasn't happy that I was talking to another woman about the baseball game.  Especially since I'd admitted that I had been attracted to Lisa at one point.  You know what?  Too bad.  I invited S to the game and she'd declined.  I tried to tell S that I no longer had any interest, but this is her issue to deal with.    My body was aching horribly and my head was pounding. I felt light-headed, dizzy, nauseous, and tired.  Maybe due to the 3 hours of sleep the previous night or that fact that I was on something of a starvation diet.    Saturday I was still quite achy.  The kids played most of the morning and we left around 11 to find a park to play at.  I had called S at around 8:30, but she was still asleep.  I called S again, but her cell went to voice mail.  I didn't leave a message.  About 10 minutes later she called back.  I persuaded her to have a chance meeting with my kids -- we'd be playing at a park near her house and she'd come with her dog on a walk.  The meeting was great and it was great to see S, even if we couldn't act as if we knew each other.  The kids loved her dog.  Afterwards, maybe against her and my better judgement, we took the kids to McDonalds for lunch and to play at their play area.  S was really good with Ivy, coaxing her to eat all her lunch.  The only real contact we had was incidental.  I drove back and put the kids down for a nap.  I got them up around 5, made them some dinner (PB&J) which they didn't eat, then we took a bubble bath.  Ivy got soap in Aidan's eyes and that ended the bath for them.  I should have been paying closer attention.  My body was still aching a little, and I started feeling queasy and started having diarrhea every hour or so.  Yay.    I crashed early.  I got up, took the kids to look at houses.  2/4 inside visits.  1 was okay but no garage.  the other was crap.  Both were within 3 blocks of the beach.  It was fun, but the kids were at times difficult to manage.  Margaret (realtor) had ideas on how to help me cover the costs of keeping the house -- sublet out the basement on a weekly or daily basis -- maybe to business travelers at work.    After the houses, went home and crashed, feeling exhausted. L was home and took on the kids.  More headache, dizziness, light-headedness, exhaustion, diarrhea.  Yay.  I got up when I was paged for work.  Backup problems.  I worked on those.  After their nap, played with kids outside in the rain.  Pasta and sauce for dinner.  Then bedtime again.  Once they were in bed, I had more work to do -- update 22 NT/2000 servers with IE6SP1.  Got paged in the middle, 2 other unrelated servers needed to be rebooted.  Went into the office to finish up change conrol.  Finished by 9:45.  Called S and chatted a while.  Taped Six Feet Under.  Made the mistake of not answering the "do you think I'm fat" question correctly.  Watched last weeks SFU episode.  Called S back and told her conversation had ended awkwardly and I wanted to clear the air.  She was really happy I'd called back.  Then I watched this week's SFU episode.  Still couldn't sleep, read and sent a few emails to S.  Fell asleep around 2.  This morning I was feeling better, physically.  Sent fax to 2nd lawyer about mediation agreement and my concerns.  Do i have a leg to stand on?

      Hi, I can't come to the phone right now because I'm decapitated.  Leave a message and I'll return your call as soon as I get my head back on.  I just got a cell phone, so I think that's the message I'll use on it.  I like to throw people for a loop.

      My friend Vicki from college used to say that fortune cookie fortunes should be read with "in bed" added to the end.  Try it, it makes them a lot funnier!  I just got one today:  A new friend helps you break out of an old routine (in bed).  Ha Ha!  See, isn't that funny!

      Oh, so I referred to things in motion, at the beginning of the last post.  I've decided that even though I can afford to keep the house, I think I'll sell it, primarily because of the psychic remnants of my broken marriage, but also for financial reasons, and because I don't want to work hard constantly to maintain the house and property, and because I'd love to live near the beach.  So I'll put the house on the market, look for a new house.  I think I'll limit L to putting 20% down on her condo, with money from the HELOC.  I may need to the HELOC to place a deposit on the house I'll be buying (let's see, 100k heloc, -22k current debt, -40k to L for her condo ... leaves 38k available in HELOC .... +23k sale of stocks = $61k for my down payment).  Yeah, that will work.  I mean, it is my HELOC, not OUR HELOC.  Then when the house is sold, the money goes to pay off the heloc.  Did I ever mention that I've lost 25 pounds over the past 6 months?  I think I did it by reducing my calorie intake and by exercising more.  Someone at work complimented me on the weight loss.  I still have another 10-20 pounds I want to lose, and I know I just have to remain diligent in my efforts.  S also has some ideas to consider once I plateau.  I'm also contacting another lawyer regarding a second opinion on my mediation so far.  I'm still leaning back towards 50/50 split and no alimony.  I even think that she should cover some of the day care costs, and regardless of whether that's going to happen, she  should cover on-going child care expenses - I think 50/50 is fair -- for ongoing expenses, major expenses (dental, eye, health), and for college education.  Stuff with S that's in motion.  She decided against the baseball game with the kids, but we'll go to RI for a reggae concert together that weekend instead.  I'll try to ask Mike or Lisa or maybe even Dean? to join me for the game.  Then the week of 8/9, I have training in Norwich and will get a hotel -- I asked S to join me for each night.  That's it for now.  By moving into a less expensive place, I'll have more cash available for other weekend trips.

      I feel like things are in motion.  I feel that it's been some time since I felt this way.  I mean, things were in motion when we adopted our kids, definitely, but I've been feeling stagnant, creatively and inspirationally for some time now.  It was frustrating these past 5 years or so, not writing any poetry.  Why didn't I want to write poetry about my kids?    The poem from yesterday, which I picked a title for, "TODAY" was inspired by S, by my weekend with her, and even by conversation with her on Monday night.   I guess I need to rewind a bit, since my last real post was on Thursday last week, after the mediation and my second date with P.    While I was on the second date, I could help but think about S.  I mean, I got home from the date, and after decompressing, I called S and we talked for about 2 hours.  Just today I received an email back from P, but, well, I guess I'll call her because I can't email her back, and just let her know what's going on with me.  But I'm getting ahead of myself again.  Rather than go camping Friday night, directly after work, I decided I really wanted to see S again, so I altered my plans so that I'd go camping on Saturday instead.  So Friday late afternoon, I drove to Hamden and got my free cell phone and signed up for a calling plan.  When I got to her house, she greeted me a little put off that I was early.  I thought she leaned in and give me a sensual kiss, but later she said that I was the one who kissed her.  After the kiss, I greeted her dog, Sampson, with real fervor, petting him, and being really playful with him.  He responded really positively and seemed really happy to meet me.    S had to finish getting ready, so I sat in her room and looked at her stuff while she got ready.  I put on a Billie Holiday CD for a change of pace.  She was happily surprised to listen to something different.  I liked her eclectic collection of stuff - from her teal chest to her computer table to the knick-knacks on her bookshelf.  After she was ready, we went out to eat.  I suggested Mexican and we got in her car.  We chatted in the car, and after a while driving down one road, she started to wonder if she'd missed the restaurant.  She continued a little ways, and then turned around.  Couldn't find it, she felt a little embarrassed ... we went for pizza instead.  She got roasted red peppers on her half and I had a hawaiian pizza on my half (ham and pineapple).  The waitress was hard of hearing, and when I told her what I wanted, she said, "do you want sauce?  do you want cheese?", and I was like, of course I want that stuff, but I also want the hawaiian, and salad, too.  After the pizza arrived, the waitress asked if everything was okay, did we want anything else, and I said I'd like to order drinks.  She started to walk away.  Uh, hello?  S got a beer and I got a smirnoff ice.  After dinner, we stopped at a grocery store, because I wanted to get water for the camping trip and frozen yogurt for that night.  I wanted phish food, but got fudge brownie instead (ben & jerry's of course).  Then we went back to the house and I met her sister, Mo, who is an INTP and a vegetarian.  She was nice, friendly, and soft-spoken.  It ends up the Mexican restaurant was a little further down than we'd gone.  We went upstairs to her room to talk and kiss and lay on her bed.  After a while, we put on the DVD, Pieces of April, we continued to kiss passionately on the bed.  I told her about my feelings about sex, that for me, sex = love, sex = commitment, and commitment = exclusive.  She felt maybe it would be best if we didn't have sex until after the divorce was final.  Yeah, right!  For some reason, I lost track of what the movie was about, and it wasn't as funny as I was hoping.  We turned it off midway through and turned out the lights and continued to cuddle with each other and talk until around 1:30.  I woke again around 4:30 and we fooled around some more.  Then I got up and left around 7:30 for the camping / kayaking trip.  The drive took longer than I expected, and I started to fear that the group would leave the campsite for the canoe/kayak trip without me.  At around 9:15, I sent Rodney positive thoughts, that I was coming ... maybe he would hear me.  I got to the campground at around 9:45, skipping check-in.  They were waiting for me, and were about to head out in 5 minutes.  Whew!  by 10:30 we were on the river - John and I were in kayaks, and everyone else was sharing a canoe (6 or 7 couples).  John was a bit of a hotshot in the kayak, and I was clearly a novice, but it didn't really matter because everyone else was hung over from partying the night before.  It was slow ride down the river, a nice mix of slow patches and rapids.  No one seemed to want to make any effort to row.  By the end I was getting impatient and I went ahead of the group.  All throughout the trip, I kept thinking about S and how much I wished she was out on the river with me.  Afterwards, we got on a bus and were dropped off near our cars to drive back to the campground.  I stopped to check in for the campground, and then drove back.  Once there, I saw that most people had not come back - one couple was about to go out, and one couple was drinking beers near their tent.  I decided not to pitch my tent yet.  The campground was close to the road (noisy), I wasn't sure what I'd do with myself, I was feeling a little lonely, I missed S, and I wanted to talk to S, but there was no cell phone service.  So I decided to drive until I found cell service.  Once in the car, I was listening to Deep Forest and I was starting to feel really low and depressed and regretful about the decisions I'd made in my life.  I cried in the car as my emotions overcame me.  I felt like there was a huge connection between me an S, and for lack of a better word, that we were soulmates.  Maybe I was crying because it felt so good to be in love again.  Or maybe I was feeling like I was rushing into things and I would have another relationship end in disaster.  Or maybe I was feeling I would inevitably make a bad decision again.  I may have also been feeling very introverted where I was running away from the campground, where I was camping with a bunch of people I didn't know.  So while I was crying and looking at the beautiful vistas I was also feeling a little like driving off the vista - ending everything.  Maybe it's like my emotions were just overwhelming and I didn't like being so out of control.  But I also felt like I had felt the tears coming on and I pushed myself to cry.  To cry for a lot of things, because I typically can't cry and I wanted to encourage myself to release.  I got cell phone service and called S.  I asked what she was doing that night and whether it would be okay if I could come see her.  She said she'd love to see me.  So I drove 2.5 hours back to Cheshire to see her.  I cried some more during the drive back.  I told her about my day and my crying in the car and some of my suicidal feeling.  I felt very vulnerable with her but felt I could trust her implicitly.  We got chinese food and then sat down on the couch to watch a movie with her sister.  I was feeling really drowsy, and excused myself around 9 to get some sleep.  She came to bed around 11:30 or so, and I woke up.  Again, more talking, kissing, cuddling, and fooling around.  We went to sleep around 1:30, and this time I woke around 4:30 and asked to use her computer to do some email, and download some of my music to her computer.  When she woke up, we talked and fooled around some more.  We kind of lazed around and then went out to breakfast around 11.  After breakfast we took sampson for a walk.  I had to leave around 3 to get back home.  It was very hard to leave.  I had such a great weekend, not having to deal with my other life.

      TODAY  with no action the best intentions are laid to waste  with no goal on the horizon or no map from the heavens the ship is lost at sea  why is today not the day? there is a sense of inspiration a sense of immediacy and maybe even a sense of urgency  Simon Brighteyes 7/13/04  I felt inspired, after talking to S every day for the past 8 days.  This is the first time I've been inspired in any way, about poetry, in the past 5 years.   S and I hit it off great this weekend.  I'll write more about it, maybe tonight.  But this total honesty thing is working out like I never believed.  I can talk to S about anything, and she can talk to me about anything.  I never experienced that before with anyone.  I have another date with her tonight, after work - go see Spiderman 2 then I'll take her to Bertucci's for dinner.

      From: Mom To: me Subject:  Newsweek Article Date: Fri, 9 Jul 2004 20:40:16 -0700     Did you read this weeks issue of Newsweek?   There is an article that you should give to L to read and discuss with you.   It describes her behavior to a T.  And it puts what she is doing into perspective with other things going on in her life.   Let me know what you think of it.   Love, Mom xoxoxo ------------------------------------------------ Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 05:19:47 -0700 (PDT) From: me To: Mom Subject:  re: Newsweek Article  I don't get newsweek anymore, but a friend of mine forwarded me the link to the article, and even though at first it was initially painful, I did read it on Friday.  I was going to send you the link.  At this point, I'm not going to show her the article.  Frankly, I don't really want to discuss it with her.  I agree that lots of stuff in the article fit her exactly.  The problem is that I can't trust her again, and even if I could, she doesn't want to do anything to try to regain my trust.  In the past 8 weeks she's gone on about 15 dates.  I've gone on a few dates myself.  I was on a kayaking trip yesterday, but the camping trip turned into a wash.  I spoke to an older couple while we ate lunch, asking how long they'd been married (just 2 years).  They had each gone through divorce, and she was talking about the resiliency of kids.  That kids see their ultimate role models, their parents, and however the parents are, the kids often reflect that.  So they see that mom and dad broke up because their relationship didn't work out, but that they still stayed friendly toward each other and worked together to build good households for their children.  They'll see that mom and dad then moved on to find mates that were more suitable for them.    Just like you and Dad did.  I look at each of your re-marriages, and I see how you found the right mate the second time around.  In fact your new mate is much better than your original mate was for you.  You and H share many of the same interests and your marriage reflects your compatibility.  With Dad and M, it's the same way.  I hope the lesson learned by our children is that sometimes relationships don't work out, but it's okay to break up and try again.  I'll take more time and care selecting my next spouse, and make sure that we're more compatible, keeping a realistic view of her -- good points and bad points.  I'm not going to rush into anything, but when I date, I am not looking to just have fun (I'm not wired that way) ... I'm looking to see if we're compatible, if we have similar interests, what her past relationships were like and how they ended, and whether I think she'll be a good lifelong mate and a good parent to my children.  On the dates I've gone on so far, I've been totally honest with the women.  The first one was a very awkward date because I admitted I wasn't ready for a new relationship (this one was during the first week of our separation).  Another one knew that I just needed a friend.  Another one blew off our date.  Two more I've had 2nd dates with, even though I was sure that they would see a man who was in the middle of a divorce and probably had issues he was working on, and there was always the possibility (in their eyes) that I could go back to my spouse.  But they still wanted to see me again.    It used to hurt when L told me she was going out.  But now either I'm jaded or I've truly accepted it, because now I don't hate her anymore.  I regret not getting to know L better before we got married.  We were never totally honest with one another and over time we both continued to withhold the truth from one another, and eventually, this form of lying destroyed our marriage.  The article did describe what happened in our relationship.  Kids were introduced into the picture, and it drastically became less about us and more about the kids.  The time we spent together was primarily limited to getting the kids up in the morning or being with them in the evening, feeding them, bathing them, getting them ready for bed.  And then by the time we were alone together, she was exhausted, and I just wanted some alone time.  Her idea of quality time together seemed to be sitting on the couch watching TV shows.  The vacations we took together were almost always about me visiting friends and family.  We didn't take enough time for each other.  That is a lesson I've learned.  But I'm going to take that lesson with me into my next relationship.  Well, I've rambled on enough here.   ---------------------------------- From:  Mom To:  Me Subject:  You've Come a Long Way Baby Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 15:51:02 -0700     I can't believe how well you can verbalize what has happened and what you plan to do differently.  You are processing things much faster than I had anticipated.  The same thing happened when I tried to talk with my Mom during my divorce.  I was continually trying to catch her up on what I'd dealt with and she was someplace way back in my process.   What our conversations did help me to do, was to organize my thoughts in a pragmatic sort of way.  The emotional rawness of the experience continued to be debilitating for quite some time, however.  I distinctly remember having days when I was just hanging on, and others when I felt truly optimistic about my future.  It took me about 2-1/2 years before I felt capable of handling whatever might come my way.  Part of that was financial, because I had a tough time making it on the money I was earning and your Dad's child support payments.  I dated a number of people during that time and ran into people who were in various stages of the same recovery process.   I found that most of our married friends didn't want to take sides and some felt very threatened by our divorce--like it was catching or that I might go after their husband.  My best support system I developed by going to Young Single Parents which offered companionship without dating and a wide variety of activities for just adults and some that included kids.  I hope you have a similar organization available in your area.  I continued group therapy for a year and that helped immensely in dealing with my emotions and issues on a weekly basis.  I also had several close friends and family to bounce things off of.       Having kids forces you to cope with crap that comes up, even though having children complicates your recovery since you will have to continue a relationship with your ex for many, many years.  Kids also complicate your forming relationships with other ladies--ie don't bring your kids into your dating life until you are dating someone you really like.  Especially, don't do sleepovers with a lady friend while your kids are home until you are pretty certain this person is really important in your life.       It's also helpful when working out your custody agreement, to figure out a weekly visitation schedule as well as arrangements for holidays.  You'll need to build in a way to share the kids around holidays or simply alternate holidays to keep the schedule from getting frantic.  If you want to bounce ideas off me regarding this issue, I'll be glad to tell what worked and didn't work for us.   Thanks for keeping me up to speed on your progress.  I know however that behind your words there are still some very raw and painful feelings. I hope you can allow yourself to mourn the loss of this relationship while getting on with your life.   I love you,   Mom xoxoxo ------------------------------- Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 17:31:09 -0700 (PDT) From: Me Subject: Re: You've Come a Long Way Baby To: Mom  Mom,  Thanks for taking the time to write me back.  My therapist also feels that I've come through a lot perhaps more quickly than she expected.  I still do have raw feelings and sometimes have trouble coping.  But maybe the times are different now and divorce is more commonplace, and many adults my age have already experienced divorce either directly or with their parents.  Everyone knows someone who's divorced, so it's less of a big deal and there's less of a stigma on divorced people.  I have several friends who have been very supportive, and I've been careful not to burden any one person with too much crap (other than my therapist).  I've been keeping a web log / journal that helps me vent lots of anger and verbalize (in a way) all the feelings I'm having.    This weekend, when I was out camping, and I had some time to myself, I broke down and cried a good cry.  Despair and sadness and regret over everything that's happened.  It was good to let it out, and to find strength from it.  I am concerned about finances post-divorce, but I'm going to get a second opinion from another lawyer just to make sure I'm not getting screwed out of what my fair share should be, and what my expectations should be.  We've now moved towards a more equitable sharing of time with the kids, where I will have them two weekdays, L will have them two weekdays, and we'll switch off every other weekend -- we'll each have the kids about 50% of the time.  We also covered holidays and agreed that we would switch off with major holidays, and just keep it so whoever has the kids on the weekend of a holiday gets the kids for that weekend.  The same will go for birthdays.  We tentatively also agreed that if one of us has a birthday party, the other spouse will be invited.  Is it sad that I'm looking forward to putting this custody agreement into effect as soon as possible?  We're already saying to each other that on our particular weeknights we're allowed to just make whatever plans we want and if we're around we'll help out with the kids, but it's not required.  And this past weekend was my weekend -- next weekend is L's weekend.  But I'm looking forward to being a part-time dad, in that I'll be free to have weekend getaways with friends or a girlfriend.  This year I will have the kids for Xmas and L has agreed that I can go to California for 10 days, so that we can get visits in with you and Dad.  I'm really looking forward to that, actually.  Next year, she'll get the kids ... I can't imagine it would be for 10 straight days, so I'm sure I'll see them for xmas eve at least.  So, it was at first a little stressful thinking about how I'd only see my kids half the time.  But after this weekend, and after spending nights out, not worrying about taking care of the kids, it's something I'm actually looking forward to.  I think the kids are young enough that they will learn this soon enough to be the routine and will adapt to it fairly quickly.  I think it's also good that they're at a young enough age where they'll adapt more quickly to a step-mom or step-dad, even though that's at least 2-3 years out in the future.  Finance-wise, things will be a little tight the first couple of years, while the kids are still in day care.  But I am making a good salary, and I do have access to some savings (Dad has also offered an advance on my projected inheritance).  But once they start grade school, I believe expenses will drop dramatically.  I realize that there will be new costs associated with the kids, like with after school programs or summer camps or increased amounts of clothes.  One thing I need to do is find a support group / play group so that I can be more social with the kids.  Maybe I'll get in touch with Ivy's friends parents and arrange some play dates.  Thanks for listening.

      Date: Thu, 8 Jul 2004 11:01:22 -0400 (GMT-04:00) From: Dean To: Simon Subject: So tell me  How was your conversation with S last night. Speak man speak! ------------------------------------- Date: Thu, 8 Jul 2004 08:24:18 -0700 (PDT) From: Simon To: Dean Subject: Re: So tell me  The conversation was great again.  We started to make plans for a date on Tuesday, but I dunno, I really like her, so I'm gonna see her Friday, instead - delaying my arrival for the camping until Saturday morning.  I'm not sure how that's going to work, logistically, but I'm going to her house to watch a video and get some dinner.  I also invited her to a date on 7/23 - taking Ivy and Aidan to a Bridgeport Bluefish baseball game.   She just seems so right, but maybe I'm blinded to some things about her.    My therapist urges me to take it slow, note red flags, seek my ideal mate, and not settle for less than that.  Being completely honest with her is a great feeling, though.  L and I were clearly not completely honest with each other, and it's been that way for some time.  We both adopted the policy of "don't ask, don't tell".  I think we were both frequently dissatisfied with our relationship but didn't discuss it, maybe out of fear of hurting the other person.  I withheld my emotions and fears and regrets and stuff about money matters.  L and I were also talking about what to do for dates, and we both got a good laugh about how we never really dated - we just kind of fell into a relationship.  Our dates always consisted of a meal and a movie or a play.    But I still wonder if I really like S or if I like the idea of S.  I do feel stronger though - that I'll stand up for what I want rather than giving in to make someone else happy.  But I have to be vigilant about that. ------------------------------------- Date: Thu, 8 Jul 2004 13:58:53 -0400 (GMT-04:00) From: Dean To: Simon Subject: Re: So tell me  What about just enjoying and being in the moment?  I agree with your therapist about heeding the red flags (of which you have mentioned none), but the notion of looking for the "ideal" mate seems to be a setup for failure.  The fact is...no one is "ideal," even when one is not in an emotional/mental state such as yours.  Your state of being right now might preclude certain measuring criteria.  Think of it this way: You meet a guy named Bob.  You don't like Bob.  Bob starts telling you about his best friend Bill.  What information might you extrapolate from this?  Pythagorean Theory.  If Bob is an A-hole and Bob's best friend is Bill it might be easy to hypothesize that Bill is an A-hole as well.  While this might not be true it can be called upon logically.   You are in a state of mind right now where you are just getting to know yourself and coming out of a place where you have not liked yourself for a very long time.  Therefore...if you do not like yourself subconsciously you are always second guessing anyone you do like because if you don't like you then how can you trust that the people you like are of "good stock," much less "ideal?"  This is especially true for you right now in intimate relationships.  You have consistently picked women who have done bad things to you...betrayed you...hurt you.    How can you trust that you wont make those same mistakes again?  The fact is...you never can.  You have a certain schemata that you have built up over the years through which you filter information.  You are in the process of breaking that schemata down and rebuilding it, but in the meantime it is what you have to guide you through the world.  Many times what we expect to happen happens simply because we expect it and therefore make it happen.  My suggestion to you in this very critical time of transition and major change both inside and out is to enjoy yourself.  Enjoy the people you spend time with.  Be open to experience.  Even be open to love and falling in love.  You are just starting to remove the blinders and when the storm clears the people who you love who also love you will still be there...the others might have moved on.  Just make sure that if you push them away that you are doing so for the right reasons.  Given everything I have said the "right" reasons might seem obscured by the clouds and difficult to parse out from the minutia.  Just know that your "ideal" is an ever changing thing right now.    Be true to yourself.  Be honest with yourself and others and while your heart might be bruised and battered it is still beating in your chest and should have a say in matters as well as your brain even in it's damaged state.    OK...I have rambled (hopefully somewhat coherently).  Call me later. ------------------------------ Date: Fri, 9 Jul 2004 06:30:57 -0700 (PDT) From: Simon To: Dean Subject: Re: So tell me  Thank you very much for this mail note.  I've read it a couple of times already and I appreciate your insight and your rambling.  The date with P last night was fun, but I guess we were a little rushed at our picnic to get to yoga.  And then when yoga was over it was just kind of time to go.  It would have been more romantic if we didn't have yoga to go to, but I think she enjoyed it.  I got a nice kiss at the end.  But when I got home, all I wanted to do was talk to S.  I called her and we talked for about 45 minutes, and firmed up our date for tonight.    I liked what you said about "being open to love and falling in love".  I'm going to stop trying to figure out where I'm going and stop trying to figure out (at least this early on) what I'm feeling - I'm just going to go and I'm just going to feel.   I just have to remember to be who I am, do what I want to do, and say what I want to say.  And not be afraid that someone is not going to like me for any of those things.  I've gotten used to quelling who I am, what I want to do and saying what I want to say for fear of rocking the boat.  All this leaves me with the thought of what should I do about P.  Maybe it's easier because she's moving to the white plains area soon (1-2 weeks).  On our date we talked a little about the flags that came up for me in our last date - her telling me what to do (simple things - like I'm waiting at a stop sign, and she tells me to go right - not from directions, but that's the way that she wants to go), or her accentuating the "generation gap" that she saw but I didn't.  Should I just wait for her to call me to do something again, or should I call her and tell her that I'm seeing someone else.  She also just seems so adult, so mature.  Much more than I feel.  But maybe that's just my perception since she's older.

      Okay.  Running the spreadsheet helps me not freak out so much.  I also have to remember that the time split for how much time we have with the kids is about 50% each.  They'll be picked up by L and kept overnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays and every other weekend, Friday through Sunday.  The'll be back Sunday nights.  We also discussed holidays, briefly, at the mediation.  Elaine said we should have a schedule, but L and I were saying that we'll be flexible.  In general we'll switch off major holiday breaks - xmas and thanksgiving.  Other holidays - whatever day they fall on, who ever has the kids that day, gets the holiday.  Open to negotiation of course.  Birthdays, the same, maybe joint activities, where the other parent is invited for the festivities.  So like I said, running the spreadsheet shows hardship the first year.  Maybe I can push alimony off until the 2nd year, where it will be 1/2, and then when both kids are in public school (free), I'll pay the full amount.  The trade off for this could be she pays no child support -- or it's baked into the alimony.  But I do want a stipulation for college - where she pays 1/2 tuition, fees, and housing.    The good thing about alimony is that if L lives with someone else, the alimony is ended.  I can use the heloc loan as a negotiating tool.  I'm okay with the 55/45 split, especially since a decent chunk of the money will be covered by sale of stocks and xfer of 401k.    So if I can delay alimony, then year 1 will be difficult, but not impossible.  Then year 2 I'll start paying alimony, but day care costs will be halved.  Right?  Or will Ivy go to kindergarten and then have to do some kind of half day day care?  So is it really 3 years out before all kids are free and clear from paid day care?

      L and I met with the mediator yesterday.  We had had discussions and I had made some financial assumptions.  Neither seemed to fall my way.   I feel like I'm getting screwed.   I feel like I should talk to another lawyer, because I feel like L and I come to an informal agreement, and then the mediator throws in a wrench, changing everything.   I feel like I'm getting screwed.   Nothing is signed yet of course.  But now it looks like instead of a 50/50 split, it will be a 55/45 split, with L getting 7 years of alimony.  And I'll be paying all of day care.  Just the day care alone means that it's unlikely I'll be able to keep the house.  L was saying all she really wants is for me to help her get the condo.  Did I already say that I feel like I'm getting screwed?  Now, the only good part of alimony is that it comes off my income and goes onto L's income.  hmmmmm...... yeah, that's about the only good part of it.  So now I'm back to thinking I'm going to have to move.  Except now I'm also thinking that I'll need to get a condo, not a house, because that's all I'll be able to afford.  Plus, do I really have the time or the inclination to do all the upkeep on the house?  I don't really know.  But I don't think so.  I mean on the nights that I have the kids, I'll want to be with the kids.  And the nights that I have free, I'll want to go out.  The other thought I had, though, was that I could keep the house and simply be paying out more than I'm taking in until the kids are out of day care - 1 year = 1 kid out, 2 years = 2 kids out.  Then I'm saving tremendously on day care costs.  I'll sell my Tercel.  I need to do a graph to figure out when I'd start breaking even, and how much savings I'd eat up in the 1st year and in the 2nd year.  Because if it's breaking even after one year, and then going back to the plus side in 2 years, maybe it's worth it to keep the house.  I also didn't realize that the 401k funds could be transferred, penalty-free to L via some legal proceeding.  That's good in that I could take a $22k of her end straight out of my retirement.  Then I cash out my stocks for another $23k ... I gotta do some more spreadsheets.  I just got a call from e-trade - heloc increase approved.

      My date with P last night was nice.  She was a little late, but I almost expected that what with commuter traffic at rush hour, and coming to a place she'd never been to before.  I made salad dressing (oil, vinegar, minced shallots, honey, and dijon), to go with a salad of mediterranean greens, pear, honey roasted almonds, and gorgonzola.  I stopped at the liquor store for a bottle of red wine.  I had no idea what to get because red wine is not my favorite, but P likes it.    When she arrived I gave her a quick peck on the lips and then we got our stuff together and found a shady spot to sit.  We sat on opposite sides of the blanket and started to place food between us.  All throughout the meal I thought about how it was a physical barrier.  P brought cheese, crackers, and fresh fruit.  All of it was delicious and made for a good meal.  We talked a lot about careers, continuing education, and possible future careers.  I did not particularly like the wine, and I don't think she liked it much, either.  After we had finished eating, we had about 15 minutes to spare before needing to leave for yoga.  That wasn't much time for anything romantic.   Lessons Learned:   sit side by side and array food in front of us, choose a beverage we will both equally enjoy, don't plan an activity immediately following the picnic.  Yoga was good.  P changed in the bathroom while I changed, unabashedly, in the living room -- V was already downstairs getting ready.  It was just the three of us.  The only downside was that when we were doing meditational exercises, I started to drift off towards sleep.  After yoga, V said that there would be no tea / fruit, because she had dinner plans.  So P and I went back outside and she showed me some pictures of her bike trip to ireland.  After the pictures, we kissed - with tongue, passionately.  Did I break it off?  Could it have gone towards something more?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if she wanted more.  But I was sure that I didn't want more.  I had decided, maybe sometime during the evening, or more likely even before the date, that I really wanted S.    When I got home, L was up and we chatted a little about the date.  Then I checked my email and re-read notes from D and S.  I decided to give S a call.  I called her at home and her sister said that she was out.  My heart skipped a beat.  I called her cell phone and she picked up after a ring or two.  She was on her way home from a friends house.  We chatted for 30-45 minutes, and firmed up plans for me to come to her place for a date tonight.  I told her that I wanted to sleep over, but that if she felt uncomfortable, I could sleep on the couch.  I went to sleep thinking about her and about my camping trip that will start on Saturday, instead of Friday.    No ambien again, I woke around 4, feeling very horny.  A raging hard-on.  I just lay in bed, thinking about S, enjoying the hard-on, untouched.  I haven't masturbated since Saturday, which up until then, could be considered a long time.  After I had talked to Sue, I was no longer interested in masturbating - I wanted to save myself for when I was with her.  During our phone conversation the night before, we had danced around sex talk without overtly saying it.  She referenced her dirty mind on more than one occasion.  She had said that if I slept in her bed, she didn't know if she'd be able to keep her hands off me.  I can't remember the last time someone said that about me.  So.  I'm looking forward to tonight.  I'm not bringing any protection because I'm disease free and infertile.  If she's not, well then that introduces a problem.  Regardless, I don't want to make any assumptions ... in fact, I think sex would confuse things or make me feel like we're in love.  Because for me, sex = love.  I think it's that way with a lot of women, too.  I also believe that sex = commitment.  I also believe commitment = monogamy.  I'm not sure where "fooling around" goes.  I packed up stuff for the camping trip, deciding not to bring my stove - I figure I can boil water on someone elses stove, for my chicken teryaki meal.  And I'll bring sandwiches.  And I'll bring some hard cider and of course, water to drink.  I'm a little nervous about kayaking on the river.  I'm a little nervous about camping and being with co-workers.  I'm a little nervous about not sleeping well.  I'll probably take an ambien, just in case.

      I showed up to my therapy appointment 30 minutes early, but Mo said it was okay, she was about to sit down to eat, but we could do the session while she ate.  Then she offered me a plate - swordfish, brown rice, and asparagus.  It was all very good.  I told Mo about my recent dating activities and that I was concerned that I liked the idea of the people I was dating rather than the people themselves.  She didn't really have an answer for me on that, but that it was something I would need to stay in touch with and determine for myself.  She advised me to watch out for red flags -- to make sure that I didn't get with a woman who was controlling, and to just take note of any things about the woman that I thought were things I didn't like or things that would annoy me over time.  I think Mo wants to make sure that I don't settle for someone, just because I think that I'm not worthy of my view of the perfect woman for me.    After the session, I drove to 500 Blake Street - it was very easy to find, and just a short ride from Mo's house.  I waited just a few minutes and then S showed up.  I greeted her in the parking lot with a hug.  We went inside and got a table and some menus.  We talked a little -- I didn't really feel nervous at all -- I found her more attractive than I expected -- that her pictures didn't do her justice.  We talked and ate, and I think we were both completely honest with each other.  It was refreshing to be able to talk about anything, without fearing something.  We talked about details of some past dating relationships, her family squabbles, and some family history.  We talked freely about feelings of depression and sometimes suicide, religion, and therapy.  We have similar views on life, relationships and religion.  I just felt like we connected so well, on so many different levels.  I like how much she laughs and smiles.  They kicked us out of the dining area, sending us down to the bar, but it was a bit chilly down there.  I suggested we go outside, and we sat in my car for another hour or so, just talking.  It was getting late and I said that we should end the evening because I was getting tired.  She got out of the car and into her car, and then rolled down the window and said, hold on, I want to tell you something.  She then leaned over into my car and I leaned over and gave her a kiss.  It was a wonderful kiss and she returned it.  The only thing I didn't like is that I felt like I had cotton-mouth from talking so much.  I was probably a bit forward in asking her to go camping this weekend. I was probably also looking too far ahead when I mentioned the baseball game on 7/23 - I figured she'd be into it because she likes the Red Sox.  And it would be a good chance for her to see my kids in a casual meeting.  I drove home and couldn't stop smiling.  I went to sleep without an Ambien hoping I would sleep the whole night through.  But I woke at 3:30 - Ivy was having a nightmare and needed to be consoled.  I emailed S, and then I also realized that I forgot to do the SAP backups - so I went downstairs and VPN'd in to do that.  During the day, I received emails from M and P.  I didn't call M regarding breakfast -- I think I'll just email her and say that I've met someone.  I really like S and want to see her again already.  But I was surprised to hear back from P, and I followed through on setting up a date with her for today (Thursday) - a picnic at Boothe Memorial park in Stratford.  I'll make a salad and dressing, and buy a bottle of wine.  She's going to bring some cheese and crackers and some fruit.  After the picnic, we'll go to yoga.  S emailed me back that afternoon, including a poem that she wrote about her father when she was back in college.  Then we talked again last night - for about 2 hours.  It was probably a mistake to tell her about the date I had with P, but I didn't want to withhold the truth or lie about it.  She declined the camping trip (which is probably best).  We agreed to get together on Tuesday next week.  We both thought it was weird that we wouldn't talk for a few days after so much initial intensity.  So I decided that I'd go to her house on Friday, kind of on my way to camping.  I'm not exactly sure where it's leading -- because I'd likely stay overnight.  I don't want sex yet, and I don't think we should rush into it, because it will complicate everything.  It's weird going from getting blown off for a date and feeling so down about everything to meeting two people I felt I connected with so well in the space of a week (or 3 people if I count Lisa from Saturday).  And even after I was honest with each of them about my current life situation, they both want to see me again.  The downside with P is that she is a little older and her manner exudes it, I guess.  I remember her saying on a few occasions that we were of different generations.  She just seems more adult, for some reason.  She's also moving in a couple weeks to the White Plains, NY area, and so she'll be less accessible.  I was originally excited that she lived so close by.  The upsides with P include that I get a sense that she's very physically active -- that she enjoys bike riding - a big plus!    S has knee problems and has some difficulty and pain hiking and bike riding.  That's a bit of a downer for me.  but she communicates on the same level as me, and we have a lot of shared feelings and shared understanding.  So two more dates this week - Thursday with P and Friday with S.  I feel a little weird about the one with P.  I smile just thinking about how easily S laughs.  Of course it's possible that neither is right for me, or that I'm really not ready to be dating and/or starting a new relationship.  Lots to mull over.  Ug.   We're going to the mediator today to discuss financial stuff about the divorce.  All that stuff is still very complicated, but I'm not so worried about it any more.

      So I called S over the weekend while she was visiting her sister in RI.  When I called, she was on her way out and couldn't talk long.  So it felt short and awkward.  She emailed me on Monday when she got back into town, and asked that I call her after I put the kids to bed (so that she wouldn't wake them with the phone).  I called her at around 8:30, and we talked for about 2 hours.  I think we got along very well on the phone.  She's agreed to meet me tonight for a drink or whatever, after my therapy appointment.  That works out well for me -- the restaurant we're meeting at is within 15 minutes of Mo's house, so that works.  I came clean with S about my lack of a tattoo, because I believe in being honest.  I can't believe I put that in my profile in the first place!  And then she asked me about it in one her first emails -- I just ignored the question and removed it from my profile.  She said that she later looked at my profile and saw that I had no body art, and she felt like an ass for asking me.  But then she asked me what else I lied about in my profile.  Well, I stated that I'm divorced, but I'm really going through the proceedings now (I feel justified saying I'm divorced, because there's no chance that we're getting back together, vs. separated where there's that chance).  Also, I think Dean put in my profile that I read Da Vinci Code, when I actually haven't.  I think Dean also said that sometimes I read as many as three books at a time, but really I don't read much at all.  Maybe it's accurate.  The real answer is that I start many books and finish few.   So I'll do another post after our date.

      L found a condo that she wants to buy.  She put $2k down on Friday, and then told me that she'll need another $19k in two weeks.  I told her that since we're re-financing the heloc, there's no way I can guarantee we'll have the checks available to write to get that money for her.  I also told her they probably want a bank check, and depositing funds from the heloc will take 3 days to clear.  So then she responded that I'll need to sell my stocks so she can get the money.  To which I responded, no way.  I told her to email the mediator about her plans, but she neglected to mention the $19k.  So I replied all and mentioned it for her.  I also offered the alternative funding from her parents (temporary loan).  She was livid that I even mentioned that.  She said that there was no way she was going to ask her parents to help her.  To which I responded that there was no way I was going to sell my stocks.  She said half that money is hers.  And I said, half of it is hers once the divorce is final.  Then she said that I was trying to screw her over regarding the condo.  Like now it's my fault that we don't have the money for her to move out.  I had no idea that she was going to need so much of the down payment so soon.  How would I know that?  Isn't that money supposed to come at the closing?  Maybe not.  Regardless, she didn't get these details (or at least communicate them to me) when she made the initial offer on the condo.  That's not my fault.  My parents tell me don't do her any favors -- don't loan her money out of the heloc.  Dean thinks I should get her out of the house as soon as possible.  Since I want to work things out amicably, I tend to agree with Dean.  I just have to make sure that everything is documented that she's taking money out of our accounts in order to buy a new place.   She also had the nerve to say to me that several weeks ago she talked to me about alimony, and said that she would drop the alimony if I helped her find a condo.  We never had that conversation!  This was the first I heard it.  Frankly, I'm all for helping her find a condo.  And of course, I'm all for not paying alimony.  Nonetheless, I told her that if she sought alimony, I would hire a lawyer and go to court.  i.e. things would get messy.  She seems to be afraid of messy for some reason.  She wants to be buddies with me.  Fuck that.  Once this is over, she will be nothing to me.    This morning she also started to suggest that we solidify our visitation agreement.  So that she has a more concrete schedule.  On her days, she'll get the kids up and take care of everything, and on my days, I'll take care of everything.  That's easy for her to say - she lives in the basement, and the kids are right near me.  Like I'd ever get to sleep in!  Then she also mentioned that this guy that she's seeing, Ozzie, has a visitation agreement where he sees his son on Wednesday and Thurday and every other weekend. She said she wanted her visitation to be in line with his!  I stood my ground wiht Tuesday and Thursday.  I've already modified my life to meet that schedule. Why should I change my schedule so that she can be on the same schedule as the guy of the moment?  Plus, not seeing the kids Wednesday through Sunday would be harder, I think.    Then I also brought up how when she has the kids, they should sleep over at her place, so that I have some free time.  In general, she was in agreement with that, but she had concerns about getting the kids to school on days when she was working.  She offered that maybe she'd have the kids more during the times that she had off.    It's funny how much we're talking and discussing these important matters.  I think she was livid with me about the financing because I was taking a stand and she wasn't used to that.  She's not used to me taking a stand and staying my ground.    She also started to talk about how she wasn't sure how she'd come up with the child support payment, after her mortgage, taxes, common fees.  I just did a quick calculation on etrade.com, where her mortgage would be $930, common charges she said were $170, and taxes $3000/year = $250/month.  That's about $1350/month!  Ye gads.  Regardless of that cost, she needs to pay for half of child care, which is about $750/month.  ($175/week/kid x 2 kids x 4.3 weeks/month) = $1505/month / 2 people = $752/person.  And that's just day care!  But if she's taking the kids overnight, then it seems fair.  Because she will also need to clothe, feed, and house them.  Her finances will definitely be tight, though.  You know what she needs?  A man with a second a income ... wait a second!  So interest rates are coming down.  That's a good thing for everyone.  I suppose I need to re-finance my mortgage, and get her name off of it.  I probably ought to talk to mortgage lawyer to see how it's done.  I think I need to find the original mortgage documentation to get L off the loan, and then I'll need to re-finance.  I'm not sure how that will work, exactly.  One step at a time, I guess.  L just called saying that her realtor said not to worry about the deposit -- that it can wait until after we re-fi the heloc.  ----------------- I just ran some numbers in a loan calculator, and might suggest to L that she only does 20% down or $42k.  Her payment will go up $50/month, but she'll have another $8k cash.  I'm not sure how much our divided settlement will be, so it may be a moot point.

      It's a basic MBTI test, and maybe since I knew what I was already, I answered the questions (4) to arrive at my expected personality type.  Actually, when I've taken the MBTI in the past, my scales are usually in between INTP and INFP.  It's scary how either of these personality types fit me so accurately.  I say scary because MBTI only has 16 personality types, and it's always nice to believe that we're so much more unique individuals than that!   There are good links on these two pages describing more about the personality types and their meanings in different facets of life.  Reading about my strengths and weaknesses in relationships, for example is both re-affirming and eye-opening (somewhat contradictory, nonetheless true).  My  urlLink Bloginality  is  urlLink INTP !!!  Or maybe  My  urlLink Bloginality  is  urlLink INFP !!!

      I just finished watching the movie, "Touching The Void", which is a documentary of two friends, Simon and Joe who go on a mountain expedition in Peru, and their plans go awry, to put it mildly.  I took the movie to be a lesson in overcoming despair.  Any situation that I'll likely face in my lifetime will pale in comparison to the desparate situation that Joe experienced on the mountain.  From the comfort of my house, I can call it a metaphor for a life obstacle that can be overcome, basically by focusing on each little step that is required in order to reach the big picture.  But never really focusing on the big picture because it will be too overwhelming.  So for me, my life obstacle is rebuilding my life after divorce.

      So last night I took an Ambien, conked out around and slept soundly until my daughter woke me around 6 or 6:30.  That was fine.  She watched a little TV with me until I turned it off ... gogde it hadke to writke when Im lying down om y stomach.  I'll try to type a little more clearly.  Out of a big bag of chocolate chips, we had about 2/3 cup left.  Not much to go on.  That's about 1/3 the recipe on the back of the tollhouse package.  So, let's see ... what is 1/3 of 3/4 - that's easy, 1/4.  What is 1/3 of 2 1/4 cups flour?  That is 1/3 of 9/4 cup of flour -- again, easy, 3/4c.  Here a harder one.  A cup of butter consists of two equal sticks, 8 tbsp each.  How do I get a 1/3 of that?  Rather than take 1/3 of each stick, take 2/3 of one stick, leave the other alone.  2/3 = .66.   5/8 = .62  so I need a little more that 5tbsp of butter (I can't believe it's not butter}.  Then the hardest one -- 1/3 of 2 eggs.  Again, a diet substitue, using fake eggs (the have a more markting friendly name).  1 carton contain 2 eggs.  So I want 1/3 the carton, whch hold 1.2c of liquid - 1/6 cup.  I broke it down to the number of tablepoons, using butter as the baseline -- so I use 2 full tbsp and about 2/3 a portion of a tbsp.  I think was right.  The cookies came out great, and Ivy had a fun time make them  with me and licking the batter from the mixer, and from the bowl  While they baked I saw that Lisa had called around 9pm, but no message (caller ID).  I called her back and maybe woke here.  I aksed to join her for temple, which was meeting 8 off Park ave.  L said it would be fine while she took care of the kids.  I guess Saturday was my day.  I met Lisa at temple and went in sat next to each other.  She introduced me to serverl other poeple that she knows at the temple.  Then they read and chanted from the hymnal.  Everyone was friends, a probably wondering if I was Lisa new  boyfriend.  After that I tried to persuad her to let me into it apartmet to change, but she refused on grouds that her home was a message.  I kept pushing when I should have just let it to.  I waited outside for a few minutes, then she joined me in my car and we drove to the meeting spot in trumbull.   We hiked on the pequonnock river valley trails.  About halfway in, Debi wa tired and ready to head back.  We crossed over  the strdy brdge to the other side where it's a lot of walker and runners, and bikes casual and serious.  It's a bit less that it our trail  By the time we got to the bottom,  they realized that w'ed need to walk back daniels farm road to the lot to get our cars.  It was fun but I would have prefered to stay on the side of the road with the real trails.  Aftr the hike, Lisa and I had lunch at bloodroot.  I had vegan burger sandwich, rosemary chipe, small salad, apple raspberry juice, and an water.  After that Lisa invited me to see Fahreneit 9/11 with friends from temple.  We were a little last, and when I didnt see lisa, I was tempted to go see spiderman 2.  But then Lisa popped out and had me sit with her between some cuouples.  After the show, we all went to Circle Diner to discuss politics, the movie, and local events.  I had 1/2 phlly cheese steak  dipped in au jus.  Some onion ring.  And a great chocolate shake.  The food was surprisingly good for a diner, I thought.  Then we made our separate ways and I drove home.  I wathed a little tv and then went to bed, consiously taking no ambien.  So went to sleep and woke at 1:30.  I laid here for a minute, and popped on the TV.  I masturbated, eved though I schould control that need / desire sh that on to perform, something bad doesnt' happen.  Then I thought I'd take an amdien  I also watched more TV.  Until  taxi driver ended at 2:30 or 3.  Them I started to get dreary and I'll work a little.   >> i sense a woman at my lamp, looking down at me.  Drifing faster nw.  ver had t type afccuratels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      driffit     going to bed

Of L lying to me and hurting me over and over again.  In my dreams I'm dying all the time As I wake its kaleidoscopic mind I never meant to hurt you I never meant to lie So this is goodbye This is goodbye  Tell the truth you never wanted me Tell me  In my dreams I'm jealous all the time As I wake I'm going out of my mind Going out of my mind

      Beached by Orbital (The Beach Soundtrack) ... for me it brings back memories of my Costa Rica vacation, and it feels inspirational.  trust me... it's paradise this is where the hungry come to feed for mine is a generation that circles the globe in search of something we haven't tried before so never refuse an invitation never resist the unfamiliar never fail to be polite and never outstay your welcome just keep your mind open and suck in the experience and if it hurts... you know what?  it's probably worth it you hope and you dream, but you never believe that something is going to happen to you, not like it does in the movies and when it actually does, you expect it to feel different more visceral more real I was waiting for it to hit me hit me  I still believe in paradise but now, at least I know it's not someplace you can look for because it's not where you go it's how you feel for a moment in your life if you find that moment it lasts forever  it lasts forever

      Sometimes I feel that I have a public image to maintain, where I need to remain calm and cool, and keep my anger and frustration and sadness inside.  Sometimes I feel I should let it out, but then I think about my life and the difficulty I have had in expressing anger or sadness publicly.  I don't want anyone to be pitying me or trying to support me.  Like I feel I can do it on my own, and I don't need anybody.  But I think deep down, I really do need other people.  And I really do need to vent and to be supported.  I think one of the things that caused my marriage to stagnate was that I stopped expressing my feelings -- that I repressed a lot.  I never really blew up at L when I found out she had the affair.  Instead, I immediately went into a depressed feeling like 'why is this happening to me?'.  Even before that, with kids, as I'm sure you know, we would spend a vast majority of our energy on being with the kids, disciplining, feeding, cleaning, playing, teaching ... such that we didn't have a whole lot of energy for each other when they were finally put down to bed.  In the last couple of years (and maybe longer), there was less romance, less excitement in the marriage.  I figured this out after it was too late.  If she ever figured it out, she didn't make any effort to change either.  Regarding the truth, we each have our own perception of it of course.  My mother-in-law tells it like it is (or as she sees it), and it pretty much pisses everyone off.  I just bought a new car, and at first she said nice car, but then immediately followed up by saying, "you now the dark blue color is going to show dirt very easily - you're going to have to wash it a lot."  At that point, I had nothing nice to say, and I was trying to get the kids in the car without them running into the parking lot, so I didn't say anything.  I think it's part of my belief system that if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything.  But in a way, not saying what I'm feeling, is withholding the truth.  And in a way, that's lying.  I have mixed feelings on it because L withheld information from me all the time -- she wasn't specifically lying about where she was, but she wasn't exactly forthcoming, either.  I think it's important to be forthcoming with the people that matter the most to you.  But actions speak louder than words as they say, and I believe I'm quite the hypocrite there!    My personal coach says that a white lie is still a lie.  My step father would agree.  He had lots of names for lying, and I remember one in particular - sugar-coating.    I went on a date last night with P.  We were originally just going to go for a walk, before I went to my yoga class, but yoga was cancelled, so we were able to do dinner, walk on the beach, sit at the beach, and then dessert.  It went about 5 hours.  I'm attracted to her, but I wonder if it's P I'm attracted to, or the idea of P.  She's a little older, 37, and has never been married.  But she asked me questions, and I couldn't tell a lie - I told her the truth about why we adopted kids (my infertility), that I wasn't truly divorced yet, that I was attracted to her, that I wanted to kiss her.    It's been a long time since I went on a date.  A very long time.  In fact I don't know if I've ever really 'dated' - it's more that I fall into a relationship.  So I was at times very nervous, and when I'm nervous, I tend to smile and laugh (what is that - nervous hysteria?).  I told her I wanted to kiss her and she asked, "really?"  But I didn't kiss her.  Then a bit later in the conversation, she said, "you can kiss me if you want."  But it didn't feel right or spontaneous any more, so I didn't.  Instead I waited until the end of the evening and leaned in for a quick kiss.  To which she responded, "you're cute".  I don't know exactly how to take that.  But, I stirred when I kissed her (if you know what I mean).  I told her I had a great time and that I'd like to see her again.  She responded that she'd like to see me again, too.  I felt a little surprised by that, because I know that she felt that I was too close to the divorce to be going into another relationship.  But I don't know, maybe her clock is ticking.  Or maybe, just maybe, she really likes me.

      I mean think about it.  What would be so bad about just getting up right now, leaving this training, and going to the beach.  The only thing I can think of is the possibility of getting fired from my job.  Would that be so bad?  Sometimes when something drastic happens, it acts as a catalyst for creating a rippling effect, causing other changes.  What would happen if I lost my job?  The obvious answer is that I would get a new one, of course.  But what would I do?  More of the same?  Would I be able to immerse myself in a job doing the same thing but at a different company?  If so, what would have changed?  Another path I could go down would be:  sell the house and move someplace cheaper.  Re-train for something I really want to do.  The problem is I don't really know what I really want to do.  Counsel teens?  Graphic design?  Interior design?  Poetry?  Make music?  Cook?  Maybe get back into IT, but from a consultant perspective.  Doing odd jobs for small to medium sized companies.  Kind of like what that psychic was saying - that I'd work independently sometime in the next year.    If my cost of living was lower, then I could afford to make less money and maybe enjoy my life more.  What activities do I enjoy?  yoga, walking / hiking, camping (theoretically), biking, kayaking / canoeing, swimming (theoretically). What interests do I have?  environment, politics (limited), belief systems, volunteer work, vegetarianism, animal rights, suicide / teen hotline. I'd like to try painting.  I was thinking about buying S the book "What Color is My Parachute", but maybe that's a book I should be looking at to determine what I really want to be doing with my life.  What transferable skills do I have that I could apply somewhere else and still eke out a living?  How low can I get my monthly expenses and still enjoy my lifestyle?

      not a productive member of society?  terminate him.  Send him out into the wasteland for a year, figure out if you can find your place in society.  Otherwise we don't need you.  not a productive member of the company?  terminate him.  maybe he'll be more productive somewhere else, for someone else.  But he should stop wasting our time and our resources.  everyone seems so involved, so buried in this illusion.  why is that?  none of this is real.  none of this matters.  reviewing data that leads to improving the quality of processes.  think about it.  ten years from now, what will it have mattered that you've wasted your life as a wage slave, improving processes?  some people say they work 70 hour weeks.  what a bunch of bonehead.  i work to live or i live to work?  there is no I in team.  Yeah, but there are four I's in individuality!  this hotel room, this tv, this bed.  none of this is real.  The elevator is not real.  the car is not real.  that bus is not real.  though it would have a real effect on me (whatever 'me' is) if it were to hit me.  It might be the end of 'me'.  the job is not real, the company is not real, the work is not real.  Or at the very least, it is meaningless.  Truly.  Think about it.  What's real is relationships.  What's real is love.  What's real is creating meaning between individuals.  Experiencing.  All these wage slaves around me are so involved in the illusion.  It's just scary.    Why go to work at all?  It's not real.  It's not meaningful.  it was very tempting this morning to say fuck it all, and just go hang out at the beach.  And why not?  well I guess there would be the real consequences of possibly losing my job and then having to find another job.  I would lose the real paycheck, which allows me to pay bills and live the life I'm currently living, maintaining the lifestyle I'm living.    If I didn't have kids, I'd be sorely tempted to sell all my crap and move to an island paradise, at least for a few years.  enjoy life for a while.  forget all this business speak.  it's very hard to stay focused on the illusion, once the veil has been removed.

      So in addition to working my somewhat regular hours on Monday (10a - 4p), I also volunteered to work 10pm to 6am on a SEV1 project.  It was at times quite hard to stay awake, and I even fell asleep a couple of times, but finally 6am came.  I immediately went to bed and slept about an hour before Ivy and Aidan came in and woke me up.  I then groggily talked to them not really hearing them when they complained or said they were hungry.  I was really out of it.  I changed Aidan, and got lunches ready for the kids.  Then I did dishes from last night.  When L took the kids to school, I finished up the dishes and went to bed.  But then I wasn't tired.  I watched a little TV, talked to S on the phone, and eventually got drowsy.  I slept until around 11:30, when I heard the dog barking and someone outside - oh, Culligan was here, to fix the water softener.    $115 and an hour later, the softener appears to be fixed.  We should expect less hard water within a week.  I should expect to refill the salt sometime in the next 2-3 weeks.  Then I showered and got ready for work.  I also worked on Sunday night, doing SAP backups for about 4 hours.  And last night, part of my phone shift was also doing SAP backups (which helped to pass the time, at least).  Tonight, Wednesday, and Thursday, more SAP backups.  But I've setup my laptop now and I can do all that stuff remotely.  Since S has WLAN, I can do it from her place .... sweet!  I'm also on call this week, and I'm trying to figure out what day to take a comp day.  It's complicated by other people taking comp days, vacation days, and more phone shifts.  It looks like Thursday Steve and Rich are taking off.  And Friday, Steve's on vacation, Rich's phone shift starts at 2, John usually takes off at 2, and I got the appraisal guy coming at 2:30.  So maybe Wednesday would be a better day for a comp day.  Then I could just see S tonight and sleep over tonight, lazing about tomorrow, taking in lunch and some shopping.    I'll have to pose it to S to see what she thinks.  We could still do a date Friday night, of course.  Also, I was thining on the way to work today that really our anniversary would be on August 9th, since that's the day that we committed to each other, as opposed to our first date.   Hmmmmmm.  S is going to follow Mo's suggestions for "cleansing" her system .... since she's plateaued on weight loss.  I'd also like to follow a strict regimen for a diet.  I realize, though, that a big reason that I've plateaued is that I'm not exercising nearly enough.  I also need to work tonight, putting that fucking parallel port card in that fucking server.  I'm so sick of all the loops I have to jump through for these change controls.  I was going to see S nearly immediately after work, but now I'll be delayed at least a little while I take care of the change control.  I've pushed it to 5:15, with customer approval, and fuck you to anybody who says I can't do it then.  Work, change controls, on-call .... all that gets very complicated when I throw custody / visition with kids into the mix. I can't really be on call at the same time that I have kids sleeping at the house, because if I need to leave to go on-site, I can't because then I'd leave the kids home alone.  Rich has offered to work with me on that, but I'd prefer to have it worked out as part of my divorce agreement.

      Princeton president John Hibbens addressing the 1913 graduating class:  "[The world] commands you to take your place and fight the fight in the name of honor and of chivalry, against the powers of organized evil and commercialized vice, against poverty, disease and death which follow fast in the wake of sin and ignorance, against all the innumerable forces which are working to destroy the image of God in man, and unleash the passions of the beast."

      Life (or maybe just this past weekend) is now about how I plan to use my time with the kids.  Saturday I took the kids to the Silver Sands beach in Milford for a couple of hours.  Aidan was so cute the way he cried and screamed whenever a little bit of slimy seaweed brushed past his foot.  He was paralyzed and wouldn't take any step towards any seaweed.  In the mean time, Ivy was having a blast, laying down in the sand, in the shallow waves, just running around having a good time.  I setup a large towel as our home base.  We ate snacks and drank juice, watching as the tide came in.  I tried digging holes, but the sand was too riddled with broken seashells.  The kids didn't put up too much of a fight when it was time to go.  We went home and I made them some lunch, then put them down for a nap.  That afternoon, after their nap, I took them outside to play in our kiddie pool.  The water was way too cold at first, but soon enough, Ivy and Aidan were in there splashing each other (and me!)  I took some pictures.  Around 5, I took them in and I made dinner while they played in the living room.    On Sunday, I was rushing around trying to get ready, but there were so many things to remember, and then I saw that the sky was threatening rain, imminently.  I was worried that our day at Peter's pool would not work out.  For some foolish reason, I decided to do a huge load of laundry.  I knew I was definitely going to be late, and I thought about calling peter and just cancelling the whole thing.  I was starting to feel downright dismayed.  Then S called, and just the sound of her voice was very calming to me.  We chatted for a few minutes and then I went back inside to call peter.  He had called while I was on the cell, and I called him back.  "Let's delay an hour, to see how the weather looks."  I was amazed that he'd mirrored my thoughts.  An hour later we got in the car and left, right in the middle of a downpour.  Peter's was fun.  The kids were shy at first, but warmed up.  Aidan had a blast riding a rocking horse.  It was an amazing relief from staying home alone with the kids or thinking up stuff for them to do.  After playing for a while we took them to BK for lunch, and then to their play area.  I crawled in, too, even though adults aren't generally allowed.  I helped all the kids (Peter's and mine) find the big purple slide (but it was a bit of a letdown because it wasn't slippery enough).  Then we drove home.  I didn't lay them down for a nap because it was around 3 that we got home.  Instead I laid down on my bed, and Aidan joined me.  I napped a little while he played quietly.    S is in DE, so while it's been hard not to see her, it's not bad, because it's physically impossible.  I'm looking forward to the divorce being final, and at the very least for L to move out, so that I can slowly introduce S into the kids lives.  Also, it will be great to have S over on nights that L has the kids.    Doing all that laundry was a big relief, a real sense of accomplishment.    This Week's To Do List:   haircut / dye  culligan to fix water softener on Tuesday  bike ride or movie or see S on Tuesday night  house appraisal for re-fi on Friday at 2:30p  trim weeds  mow lawn  fix garage door, garage trim  laundry (one more load to do)  SAP backups (Monday through Thursday nights)  Yoga Thursday night  Bike ride Saturday  Hike with hiking class on Sunday at Devil's Den  Half day Thursday for lunch / shopping with S  date with S Friday night (1 month 'anniversary')  date with S Satruday night  Sunday night go to Norwich for training next week  If I actually do half of this, I'll be happy.  I also have to do a change to install a PCI parallel port card into a server, and I have to cover 1-2 war room phone calls for some trojan going around that we're helping to investigate.  I volunteered for Monday night 10p-6a or Wednesday night 10p-6a.
