        Oh God! One more day! It feels so wierd. Everything feels a little bit different. For the first time in months, I'm not listening to really sad, down-beat songs. Lol. I feel happy that all that shit is almost over. But I'm still pretty tired. Muh. What a horrible post. I'm not ready to put a junkload of energy into anything. Better to rest, I guess.

        (Speaking to Braleigh) Wow, this has been a shitty day for the both of us. I know that eventually, you'll be reading this, so I'd thought I'd write to say how sorry I am for not being more sensitive. Not only that, sorry for being so self-involved. Sorry! When I get all weepy, I get like that.     Anyway, yeah. I cried a lot today. Like, eight times... Hahaha, I think I got heat stroke, and it messed up my brain. Like, I'd be totally fine, then just all of a sudden, crying like a baby. My eyes hurt. Lol! All the things that have been bugging me for the past month just got dregged up.     (Speaking to Lauren)  It was very yucky, and I also would like to take the time to both apologize, and thank Lauren for her valiant efforts on the battlefield that is always between us when I'm spazzing. Sometimes, I think it's better to just tell her that I'm fereaking out right now, and not to take me seriously, than bottle it in and wait until it explodes. Icky Ickers.     Sheena's coming home soon. I miss her, and I miss talking to her.    Frank is chewing a toliet paper roll. And eating it. Yum    (Speaking to Ashley)Oh! Right! I also meant to thank Ashley for her amazing, indepth analyzation of my dream! holy crap! You pulled so much from that, and as I applied it to my life, I started seeing a lot of paralells! Nuts! Thanks so much! That was awesome!

        I had a very strange and scary dream last night. I'll tell you about it, because it seemed to have some sort importance, plus it was just chilling. It was in the style of a movie, very cinematic. Anyway, this is how it started out...    A woman with blond hair walks down a long, long corridor. She is wearing a flowing white dress, with both shoulders exposed. The sleeves pour out unattached down her arms until the wrist, where a slender circle of fabric grips each wrist loosely. She is wearing white high heels, and as they make their presence known, they betray the owner's nervous apprehension.    *Clack Clack Clack*. She is walking at a fast pace, as if she's worried about something. Maybe it's just my mind jumping ahead of me, but I can already see a hint of fear on her features.    *Clack Clack Clack*. You can tell she is underground. No real signs of this, other than the lack of windows or fresh air in the corridor. As for the corridor itself, the walls are made of series upon series of paneled lights, that emit a soft, gentle light into the hallway. The corridor curves slightly, as if part of a giant wheel. She keeps walking.     A quiet noise joins the clacking of her heels. It is a *click, click, click* from behind her. It doesn't seem to concern her,          yet.    The clicking has grown louder, and she has become more sure that the noise is coming from behind her. Her breath quickens as she chances a look. Still walking, she can't see anything behind her. She straightens her head and keeps walking, but faster.    She looks back again. With a sobbed breath, she realizes what the clicking noises are. With a steadily increasing pace, the paneled lights on either side of the hallway are turning off in sequence. They click as each one is extinguished. The woman, grasping an instinctual truth of the situation, begins to run, doggedly in her high heels. *ClackClickClickClackClickClickClackClack*. She cannot outrun the dying of the lights behind her. The last you can see of her face before the darkness engulfs her is panicked and terror stricken. And then, it is dark.    Time passes, and, as with most dreams, the dreamer known that something terrible has happened as well. I seem to know that she has been raped, beaten, or worse. But all I can see is the darkness, and as I approach her, I can barely make out her white dress. It is in tatters, and dark, heavy stains on the fabric glisten ominously. She is on the floor, panting. Her throat, hoarse from screaming into the darkness, seems to have closed up, and she wheezes. Suddenly, she senses me in the black fog, and snarls animalisticly. Her face is so close to mine. She has yellow eyes. And then it is over.        Brr, eh? That's about it, and I won't mention the parts about stupid Nicholus Cage in his Mercedes Benz, trying to convince Lauren and I into the car. Yuck, anyway, if you have a theory, or comment about the dream, totally share, because I have no clue want it could mean, or even if it's important.

        Eep. Just a moment ago, I caught myself thinking, "Why do people change?". Wow, what an asshole I am! Lol! I remember feeling contempt for a certain boy when he dramatically wished for his old girlfriend back, saying those exact same words. I mean, people don't change, they grow. And it's the bane of the world to try and stop someone from changing, because then, they aren't growing, they're trying to get away from you.    I realized as soon as I'd said it that I really didn't mind that people change, it's just the initial shock that gets you in the beginning.     What I'm really feeling is a little jealous, that I really haven't grown socially in a while, and still, I can't see myself being very sexual at all. Am I going to be trapped in this androgoneous state forever? Honestly, when Grace tells me about her adventures, I'm part horrified, part facinated that she is so driven by this need that I don't have. It's frusterating to feel this way. I mean, I like guys, but I don't want to go out and "fuck everyone". I just don't feel it. Other girls, when they like somebody, they like them sexually too, but me, well, yeah. I don't want to complain, but what the hell, WHEN AM I GOING TO FEEL NORMAL?

        Man, I hate studying. It's so depressing and horrible. Yuck. I hate it so much. Oh well, if I want to get a good mark, I guess I have to, right? *Sigh*, then I should probably be studying right now, instead of doing this, right? No! Wrong!     Ok, maybe I should be studying...     I have trouble studying when people are over, unless they aren't studying for the same subject. I find it hard to get back on task when someone asks me a question. Lol... Ok, I'd better get back to work. I've been contemplating writing a post about Braleigh Nelson. I think I will.

        I'm sick today, and it's father's day. What a sack of crap I am. I had to leave early because I thought I was going to puke all over everything. I also need desperately to study, but have only done 26 questions on my first Geography provincial. Fuck. I haven't felt this sick in a long time. I hope I don't have some kind of stomach ulcer, or cancer. Fuck, my head aches.     I've been super cranky lately too, partly due to the fact that I'm sick, but also because I have no money, and seem to be working a lot for free. Nothing could be more depressing than volunteer work. Lol.    Frank puked. We both must be sick. Sigh, sick as old dogs. Sick as old ladies. Sick as your mom.

        My first Post! How groin-quivering exciting!    Err, ahem, Forgive my utter lack of manners or inhibitions, it is a trait that I have lovingly developed during my last year of high school. Although it's far from complete, it's probably best that I leave it that way. I can honestly say that I can honestly say just about anything, especially on something so intimate/impersonal as an internet post.    My first post is destine to contain very little substance. I don't really want to seem like an Ashley, so I'll leave out as much of my self-depreciating rants as humanly possible.     I'm heading to Braleigh's house now, to hang out with a few friends, and hopefully not get sick, like I seem to have a knack for doing when it's time to do something fun.     Now for the big question... Who do I share these thoughts with... I would feel pretty horrible if all of a sudden, I had a hankering to rant about something, and have the subject of that hankering read it... *Long sigh* Well, I guess if you're reading this, I'll have to muffle those rants. Haha! Not that I'd rant about YOU!!!

      Beside me, the cd player in this old computer rattles the entire tower. It's working overtime playing Louis Armstrong's Greatest hits. Fuck, such a good artist. He actually is one of the coolest people in the galaxy. His voice, God... such a master.  Oh btw Lauren, the line is from "Dream a little dream of me"... You know which one I'm talking about?  Wow, it's such a pleasure to sit down and just write right now. Things have been shitty around me, but, I think I'm doing ok. The excitement of University is one of the things keeping me going.  God, I just read some of Orson Scott Card's reviews... He is so good. I wish that I could write like he can. I always say that when I'm writing something really good. Don't be surprised if I've said while reading some of your blogs, because, occasionally, I come across something so pristinely perfect, that I come back and read it again. I'm not meaning to start a competition or anything like that, but I find that when I seems like I can actually hear the voice of the author when I read their blog, it captures the imagination. Lol, run-on sentence... I'm starting to get terrified of the English provincial... I'm retaking it... God, I hope I do better. I'd better study...  So, keep writing in your blogs, so that I can keep on worshipping you. Lol.

      &nbsp; Wow! Today I moved sets for the Summerland Singers and Players. You've all seen my complete lack of muscle mass, so right from the beginning, I felt totally out of place. Because Lauren got the times confused, poor Johnny and Braleigh couldn't help out, but, it was just as well, because I would've embarrassed myself in front of them. I was actually so weak. There were some things I tried to lift, but my shoulder popped out of it's socket with the strain. Lol! What the fuck. I knew I was a weakling, but this was a humbling experience.   &nbsp; After a half n' hour passed, I kept seeing violent images of my broken body lying prone as blood seeped across the concrete. I thought I was going to die. I remember telling Lauren that I should phone someone to take the job, because I was a fraud. I kept working...   &nbsp; It was probably around the time when Lauren and I were doing hulk impressions, throwing heavy things into the dumpster, that I realized what a whiner I was being. A lot of the heavy heavy lifting could be done in two ways, with brute force, or a more careful application of strategic strength. YES! I could do strategic strength. It was pretty sweet-awesome-cool!   &nbsp; Anyway, even though I'm a big slut, I learned that I should stop being such a bitch and just DO ET! Lol! I should probably start this "Stop Brittany from being a whiny bitch" by stopping from apologizing so much for things that aren't my fault. Lol. Yes! Word up, brotha

      &nbsp; I watched the TIN DRUM! (For anyone who hasn't read the book, and wants to later, just skip this post.&nbsp;If not, then read in delight the wonders of perverted&nbsp;German writers!) &nbsp;I thought that maybe if I watched the movie, the book would make way more sense. Guess what?! PFFT!   &nbsp; I mean, it was exactly how I imagined it in places. The actor who played Oskar was just as creepy and child-like as I imagined. He was astounding. But, when he decides to perform oral sex on his first love, Maria, I nearly vomited. He looks like a three year old. It's pretty easy to forget that in the book, because you can just mentally block out the fact that a tiny, childlike horny teenager is humping 16 year-old girls. Man.   &nbsp; The best part of the entire movie HAS to be the Post Office scene with Jan Bronki and Kobeyella. God. Fuck. That was so good. If you've read the book, I would suggest just watching that part. It is so amazing. The actor who plays Jan is so friggin' good, that you die inside as he begins screaming "Agnes!" as the Germans invade the Letter Room. And when he starts laughing maniacally, holding the Queen of Hearts aloft.... Wow. Just nuts. So Fucking GOOD.   &nbsp; Holy shit! The part with the fish, and the eels crawling from the horse.... BLAH! So disgustingly good. Watching the woman who plays Agnes, you begin to wonder how much she is being paid. As Mr.Mazerath says in the&nbsp;movie, "She doesn't eat, she gobbles!". Not only that, but she throws up like eight times, sleeps with both men on screen, and probably has to endure the high-pitched screeching of Oskar more times then I care to think about.   &nbsp; If you've read the book, defiantly rent the movie. You'll find it both highly entertaining, and highly disturbing! I never actually finished the end of the book, so when I found out it ends when they board the train, leaving the grandmother behind, I was a little disappointed. But please, if you watch the movie first, you will never read the book, and will miss out on the huge amount of inner dialogue that Oskar doesn't share in the movie.   &nbsp; OH! I almost forgot! You know the part, "There once was a boy named Oskar"? They did it, and it turned out so good. But they just skipped out on the trumpet-player's story.   &nbsp; Lol, ok, I'll stop this post, but if you want to watch it with me, I think I'll have the movie for a couple more days. We can fast forward through the midget sex, if you want. Lol   AND PLEASE! If you understand the theme\anything behind this book, tell me. Because, after watching the movie, I still have no clue.

I will soon change the picture (If I can figure out how) and also try to find out how to fix the comments so they don't just show themselves like whores all the time. You know what I mean? They're just there when you open the thingy! It's too sudden, I think, to have the comments hanging out like that. I like the slight tension and excitement you get from reading a good blog, and then looking at the bottom, and "Oh, yes. How wonderful, there are some comments!" See, more pleasurable. At least, that's what I think... It might be my own opinion. If anybody knows how to fix this blunder of mine, (I tried the whole  shit, but it didn't work) please tell me.

      &nbsp;  Guess what?!  The other day, I tried to pee like a guy! It was SOOOOO Hard! I didn't have to grab my crotch or anything, I just pulled down my pants, and&nbsp;positioned myself over the toilet. But I was too afraid I would splash all over the place, so I semi-chickened out at the beginning. So, I made it easier by starting at a sitting position and then gradually getting up! When it was over, I had a glowing sense of pride, at achieving something so extrodinary. I peed like a guy! How awesome is that? And I didn't dribble on the seat or anything. If you are female, then I urge you to give it a try! If you're male, then give me the ol' thumbs up, because I have joined the illustrious ranks of  "Pee-ers who stand" Club . YES!

      &nbsp; Last night, I dreamed that I was fighting giant people in a dark place with Lauren. One of the biggest of the enemy attacked both of us, and he sliced off our left hands. It was so strange. I actually cried when I realized I couldn't use my hand anymore. I could still feel my fingers moving, but all I cold see was the bloody stump. Then, in my dream, I passed out, because of the pain. When I "woke up" in my dream, the stump was my hand again, and there was scars from stitches. But when I tried to move my hand, the tendons had been connected wrong, and different fingers moved. It was both frightening and intriguing. Yuck.

        Hey, to everyone who tried to help me through this difficult time, and gave their opinions eagerly and earnestly, Fuck you.    I thank the Good Lord that am going to (finally) make the right decision, and not because somebody told me that "Eric blah blah blah," or, "Oh MY GOD! John blah blah blah!"     It's not that I don't appreciate your (no doubt) genuine concern. Perhaps I am just upset with myself that I hurt the people I care about because I listened to the opinions of the ignorant and malicious.     No, I'm telling the truth. Why did I ever listen to everyone else on the planet (and their moms) when I should have been focusing on my own feelings, and the truth of the matter.     Bruised, mentally battered, I emerge a wiser person. So, to everyone who whispered in my ear and poisoned my judgement, Thank you.       (Note added, in response to posts. This is not about my friends, this is to all the people who never even talk to me before this, but now see it as their god-given right to slander the sound waves with their "valid" opinion.)

If you're a boy reading the post, lol, well, let's just say, think twice before asking, because I wouldn't want to destroy my "Nerdy, but nice" image. Not ready for that, just yet. Lol!

      So! I've just finished a week of work at my new job. For those of you who don't know, I am now officially a Leaf Cutter. If you are unaware of the duties of the leaf cutter, then let me introduce you to the wonderful world of "bud harvesting": I cut leaves. There's not much more to it really. Well, if there are no leaves to cut, then I weed in the orchard. Why, you ask? To harvest the new growth buds underneath, that can be used in grafting onto "root plants" to make new species of fruit tree. Oh yeah! The research station sells them for big bucks. Pretty glamorous, if I do say so myself. My favourite part of the job is harassing my coworkers.  I work with Craig Peters (who will have his own paragraph), Mike Stelutti, Emily Contrell, Jan Celler (Also a paragraph), and two field-hands, Richard and Michael (PARAGRAPH).  *Sigh* Craig, Craig, Craig. Where to begin? Well, he's the offspring of two particularity nerdy people, Mrs. and Mr. Peters. If you don't know them, be thankful. Lol, as for Craig, well, let me give an example. It took him an entire 3 1/2 mins to lay out wet newspaper. I'll be the first to admit, wet newspaper is not my favourite substance in the world. It's hard to work with because it loves to rip up. But, I think what really repulsed me was the anal-retentive display of smoothing out each wrinkle after setting the newspaper out. Forgive me for my lack of vocabulary, but, the action was so distinctly effeminate. I couldn't take it. Also, for a grand total, he taught us the benefits to playing Dungeons and Dragons, described his various characters he's working on, and different swords that he would love to have. Again, forgive my ignorance, but if you want to make your imaginary character better, then what's stopping you from just saying, "BOOM! My character just earned 100,000,000 experience points for opening that door!". I'll never understand it.  Jan Celler. His name, is not Jan, but is pronounced Yawn. He's originally from England, and before that, Germany. He's 14 years old, but is so hilarious. The first day, he was terrified of me and Lauren, but, after a thorough debate about broken bones, Jan blurted out, "Three toes!"... *Blink blink*. We realized he was adding in his own set of broken bones. Later, after I asked about his family, he said, "One brotha," Yes, he has a British accent. Occasionally, we didn't know what the fuck he said, like when he said, "Toies", for toys, and "Fitee Cen' " for Fifty Cent. Fffft, he's a good guy. With the accent, it's sometimes hard to remember that I'm a human being, and not a cougar. Lol, j/k Eric!!!  HOLY SHIT! Michael. One word, CREEP! Michael proudly pronounces that he is so inter-related in his family, that he is every race. He also says that he is both a High Wiccan Priest, and a Catholic Priest. He has tiger-stripes tattooed on his arms, and speaks in a different voice for 95% of the time when he tells his stories. He is a self-described Sex God, and has invented a new religion around that fact. But all this is not why Michael creeps the shit out of me, although it is sufficiently enough to creep anyone out. Let me paint a scene for you:  I'm sitting in a pile of cut leaves, on a box. Michael, who I barely know, slides his box up next to mine, and starts cutting. Already, I'm creeped out, by how he has invaded my personal bubble. Unsure of what to do, I keep on cutting. Right when I'm about to forget how fucking close he is to me, he speaks. "Did you try out for the Excel job?" He asks. I stiffen. Wft, I think to myself, How the fuck did he know that? I attempt to answer without letting my eyes dart around to find an escape. "Umm, yeah." I said. "Ha! I thought I recognized you! I was there too! Sitting in the corner! Do you remember?" He asks me excitedly. In the corner? Good Lord, where's Lauren, Help! Help! I thought frantically. I decided not to look into his eyes as I answered evenly, "Oh, yeah, right. I remember." At this, he nods. Even that simple movement creeped me out. "I thought I'd see you again!", he giggles. Oh God. He's gonna rape me, I think. I begin to edge away from him. There is an awkward silence, where I am trying to maneuver away, and he tries to word his next creepy comment, no doubt. Like a deer in the headlights, the sound of his voice makes my eyes meet his helplessly. He continues his monologue, unaware of my desperate attempt to escape. "You're kinda cute! Do you have a boyfriend?" he asks. In my mind, I can see myself taking the small tree clippers held in my hand and driving them into my stomach. I blink, and wish that I actually had. I realize that he is waiting for my response. "Uhh, thanks. Sorry, I do have a boyfriend." Thank you Eric! I think, relieved. "Oh, that's too bad. Darn." He says. There is an awkward silence. In this time, I stare at my work, and try to pretend that it didn't happen. WFT! I think, Who the hell says 'you're KINDA cute". That's like saying, "Wow, before the accident, you were kinda cute!". I am sooooo creeped out right now. Suddenly, curiosity grips me, and before I can stop myself, I ask, "How old are you?" His eyes shoot up, and I can tell that he is happy that I asked. "I'm 31!" He says. VOMITVOMITVOMITVOMIT!, I cry out in my head, Please, someone come over! OH GOD! He continues, "I don't look it, eh?" I try not to vomit, by my mind keeps on replaying scenes of me using the clippers to cut my jugular vein. "How old are you?" He asks. "17." I respond, to creeped out to say anything more. Finally, in the distance, I can see Lauren approaching, and the other leaf cutters following. I send her a stricken glance, and she decides to sit between me and creepy, creepy Michael.  EW! EW! EW! Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross.   Ew. Yuck. Gross. As the others sat down, Michael launched into a discussion, while I ignored him. But, when he mentioned that he was a sex god, his eyes met mine, and I think that's about the time I was so irrevesably scarred that I died inside.  Anyway, other than the creepers, work is fun. I'm glad to be working again. Tell me what you think about this Michael thing, if I was taking it way to seriously, or if I should be wearing my cervical taser to work from now on.

       So! I've just finished a week of work at my new job. For those of you who don't know, I am now officially a Leaf Cutter. If you are unaware of the duties of the leaf cutter, then let me introduce you to the wonderful world of "bud harvesting":    I cut leaves. There's not much more to it really. Well, if there are no leaves to cut, then I weed in the orchard. Why, you ask? To harvest the new growth buds underneth, that can be used in grafting onto "root plants" to make new species of fruit tree. Oh yeah! The research station sells them for big bucks. Pretty glamorous, if I do say so myself. My favourite part of the job is harrasing my coworkers.    I work with Craig Peters (who will have his own paragraph), Mike Stelutti, Emily Contrell, Jan Celler (Also a paragraph), and two field-hands, Richard and Micheal (PARAGRAPH).    *Sigh* Craig, Craig, Craig. Where to begin? Well, he's the offspring of two particularily nerdy people, Mrs. and Mr. Peters. If you don't know them, be thankful. Lol, as for Craig, well, let me give an example. It took him an entire 3 1/2 mins to lay out wet newspaper. I'll be the first to admit, wet newspaper is not my favourite substance in the world. It's hard to work with because it loves to rip up. But, I think what really repulsed me was the anal-retentive display of smoothing out each wrinkle after setting the newspaper out. Forgive me for my lack of vocabulary, but, the action was so distinctly efeminite. I couldn't take it. Also, for a grand total, he taught us the benifits to playing Dungeons and Dragons, described his various characters he's working on, and different swords that he would love to have. Again, forgive my ignorance, but if you want to make your imaginary character better, then what's stopping you from just saying, "BOOM! My character just earned 100,000,000 experience points for opening that door!". I'll never understand it.     Jan Celler. His name, is not Jan, but is pronounced Yawn. He's originally from England, and before that, Germany. He's 14 years old, but is so hilarious. The first day, he was terrified of me and Lauren, but, after a thourough debate about broken bones, Jan blurted out, "Three toes!"... *Blink blink*. We reilixed he was adding in his own set of broken bones. Later, after I asked about his family, he said, "One brotha," Yes, he has a british accent. Occaisionally, we didn't know what the fuck he said, like when he said, "Toies", for toys, and "Fitee Cen' " for Fifty Cent. Fffft, he's a good guy. With the accent, it's sometimes hard to remember that I'm a human being, and not a cougar. Lol, j/k Eric!!!    HOLY SHIT! Micheal. One word, CREEP! Micheal proudly pronounces that he is so inter-related in his family, that he is every race. He also says that he is both a High Wiccan Priest, and a Catholic Priest. He has tiger-stripes tattooed on his arms, and speaks in a different voice for 95% of the time when he tells his stories. He is a self-described Sex God, and has invented a new religion around that fact. But all this is not why Micheal creeps the shit out of me, although it is sufficiantly enough to creep anyone out. Let me paint a scene for you:    I'm sitting in a pile of cut leaves, on a box. Micheal, who I barely know, slides his box up next to mine, and starts cutting. Already, I'm creeped out, by how he has invaded my personal bubble. Unsure of what to do, I keep on cutting. Right when I'm about to forget how fucking close he is to me, he speaks.   "Did you try out for the Excel job?" He asks. I stiffen.  Wft , I think to myself,  How the fuck did he know that?  I attempt to answer without letting my eyes dart around to find an escape.   "Umm, yeah." I said.   "Ha! I thought I recognised you! I was there too! Sitting in the corner! Do you remember?" He asks me excitedly.  In the corner? Good Lord, where's Lauren, Help! Help!

"I thought I'd see you again!", he giggles.  Oh God. He's gonna rape me , I think. I begin to edge away from him. There is an akward silence, where I am trying to manuver away, and he tries to word his next creepy comment, no doubt. Like a deer in the headlights, the sound of his voice makes my eyes meet his helplessly. He continues his monolouge, unaware of my desperate attempt to escape.   "You're kinda cute! Do you have a boyfriend?" he asks. In my mind, I can see myself taking the small tree clippers held in my hand and driving them into my stomach. I blink, and wish that I actually had.

      Sometimes, I say things that make more sense as I think about it. For example, in an interesting conversation I was having with my twin, I presented a hypothesis:  "Sometimes, people flatter themselves by pretending to believe something untrue."  The benefits for this sort of behavior are: 1) You receive attention 2) You receive sympathy 3) You receive compliments as people struggle to straighten you out.  This may sound fine and dandy as an old woman, but I have come to believe that this type of behavior can become very self destructive, because, in order to establish the untruth, you have to embed the lie into your everyday life. This means, you actually have to implant it into your reality. In a sense, although you know that it isn't the truth, part of you has accepted it, in order for it to be in your 'reality'. And now, each time you confirm the lie, it wiggles a little deeper, until, when you've gotten your sympathy, your attention, your compliments, it's out of reach! It's really dug in there! The panic sets, in and your search for the truth becomes a little panicked. The people who were previously consoling you notice the change in mood, and are confused.  The more I write this out, the more it seems horrible. I think I used to do this a lot more than I do now. But I can now see the vital importance of not purposefully poisoning your own perspective, because it's the only outlook you have.   Anyway, it's just something I noticed a long time ago, when I think everyone did it more frequently. Tell me if you think there's a flaw in my hypothesis, because I'm defiantly not a great judge of character, not like some of you out there.
