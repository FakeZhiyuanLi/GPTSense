       well well well, it seems Mattoose must revise his list of trustworthiness....just a little tit-bit to leave you gagging for more my followers. On a random note demon-matt got upgraded today to the level of Lucifer, not far now until he becomes&nbsp; a fully fledged Devil. Well doneth him.&nbsp; Yesteryear saw matt retire to a pleassant little eatery delightfully decorated with the title Donnateloes, In Brighton, whereupon i did sup upon a Pizza large enough to satisfy even the most hairy chested of us...you all know who i mean! whilst in said delicious restaurant we did recive humble entertainment from that escaped lunatic otherweise known in dramatic circles as Christopher Davey. Nuff Said. Anywho i musteth away, for mym suitcase is beckoning me to fill it with joyous tat. Fair thee well my impish servants of the goated one. Matteth.

In the words of the divine creator himself...Lee...'i shall call him Matt the second'...'So shalt it be written, so shalt it be done' Well isnt that just fab? Not much else happened today. I have thought a bit more about my art topic...Surrealism...and i will be monitering my dreams for the next few weeks! Anyway Mush im off now to recuperate after what has been an interesting day....Signing off at 16.47 Scout Time. Tata mien Berhindet!

       Well today was an adventurous day in the wacky world of Matt. To begineth I started work, what a load of fun that was...anywho made Â£620 not too bad. So my children, when will you statrt pouring in and purchesing your peripherals????? Then one did arrive home, whereupon I ate&nbsp; a chinese. She was very nice, if not a bit stringy.......Aftet this brief enocunter with another culture I enbarked on a worldwind advetnure with my good pal Bruce, or Lesley as she likes to be known in certain circles... We went to drive, foiund some hidden treasure, got hissed at by an old women with a bag, then solved world peace and the aids pandemic...after that we went to mcdonals and got hot apples pies, which we tried to give one to Lee only he didnt asnwer his door...rudeth scallywag. Upon hearing this sad news I began to eat the afformentioned hot apple pie and it was good. I then came home. I fully suppoort the work of the Fontwell for Capital commitee and feel that a change of scenery from London to Fontwell could be very well what this country needs... Altho such drastic moves are not leagally binding in 48 states. Anywho my brethren i shall leave thee be for i must move on and proceed to sleep.... tatty bye spudlings

        Hey Hey, well it appears that I havent been here for a while, and consequently have neglected my duties to the Fontwell for Captial campaign and the Legend known as Lauren. Shame. I shall rectify this insubordination ASAP. Hmmmm so what have I actually been up to??? A load of bugger all if you ask me, oh yes we went to Laurens yesteryear for a video evening which turned into just chatting and we neglcted the video, which I suppose was for the better, after which we left in the Early Hours and rolled home thus. But my chums I must away for I am being dragged to the Dungeon to start my training for Eclipse...ooooohhhhh...TatyBye

        Well as you can probably tell I am vexed.  This was due to a certain little sack of wank we shall hence forth call Tossing Twat Fcuk. In case you dont know who i'm going on about then...wait for it...*cough* joe *cough*...there we go...Well he hath ruined my life long enough and I have had enough of the afformentioned slag bangle. If he so much as steps one foot into my life he shall rue the day he messed with me. I bet you didnt think I had it in me fellows. Anyway I saw spiderman 2 mit Matt today, twas good. And tommorw I am going to London to look at some galleries which im looking forward. Right I must away now, if any of you hear any gossip about me sprouting from the She-Fag's lips or any of his cronies then be a dear and let me know! Danke.

You could just here that smidge of sarcasm couldn't you? Well as Frielfer says where have you all gone??? I longed for a bit of a chat with you all after my holiday but that wasnt to be, Iv only spoken to a few of you properly. Anywho the dog with two heads and two bodys is knocking on my door and if I dont answer it now he may eat the hob goblin who also needs to speak to me. Fairwell my chummies and I bid thee good night.

       Well kiddies hasn't it been quiet on the old MSN recently? Shame becasue I WANTED TO BORE YO...shit caps lock, dam it dam it dam it...anyway...u with more boring facts about my life.  A little puzzle did but irritate me yesteryear. The said puzzle was brought to my attention to Heldric, who is one half of the troublesome duo Layla...or is it lemer...or pehaps Leilo...Lido...Lickspittle...oh i dont know wel shes part of this cliqe, anyway she mentioned there was a comment on one of my blogs, naturally this intrugued me so i trundled online to have a look, only to find it had been removed by a blog administrator! Shock Horror! The comment had been left by none other than Stringy...I quizzed this bouncy haired being but he was alusive. Was it rude? what did it say??? I must know...Whats that? Someone fell down the old mine shaft...Go ahead young man!

       Ahh I feel I must write some useless crap that no-one really gives a toss about. Here goes. Leyles and myself have decided we are going to get stringer more involved ion the goings on in Littlehamptoin so we are going to invite him out more and more! huzzaa. Anyway it has reached my attention after browsing through lauren, stirngers and helens blogs, how sad, that there is a brawl in action. Naturally i wish to get myself involved and spread infamy and bewitchment to all unfortunate enough to read my ramblings. Thus having decreed my services i feel it fair to join stringers side since helen join the ranks of Lauren. stringer i pledge my alleigience to you until such time as i feel it necesary to exchange it for a plastic goblet. That my friends ends my poinless ramblinhgs for another day. i bid u fairwell for i wish to have a bath, whereupon on my exit i shall smell bewitchingly of addidas shower gel. Hurrah. Nachos.

Actually dont answer that cos i know the utterings you may perchance to display will not be to my desiring. lol. Well even if you didnt misseth me i certainly missethed you, and bugger of all buggers i ran out of credit so couldnt text my kiddies. Shame. Right must dash theres a bowlful of washing up that is spelling out my name in soapy letters. Ciao mien.
