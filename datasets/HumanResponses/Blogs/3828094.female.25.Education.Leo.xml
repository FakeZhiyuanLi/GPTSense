      Today. Well, actually, I will start with yesterday.  Yesterday, my husband and I hosted my father-in-laws retirement party at our house.  So, I spent most of the day cleaning the house and patio.  Most of the time when we have company we just close the three bedroom doors and don't clean everything.  However, I knew that many of the family coming hadn't seen our house and may well have wanted to take a look around.  That is why, I cleaned each room.  I really think we should try to budget in a maid for once a week, or even every other week cleaning ;)   Anyway, Richard, my husband, did his share too.  He was intensely setting up to cook lots of food on three grills.  He started the grills, checked their temps and diligently checked the food throughout the day.  He cooked four pork tenderloins, 40 hot dogs, 50 hamburgers, and four pans full of chicken wings.  He was sweating his rear off and all of the food turned out really good.  Oh, we had a keg of beer and lots of soda too.  Also, some family brought a pan of macaroni and cheese, chicken and rice, pasta salad, potato salad, a sweet potato pie (which we wanted more of, a lot of people missed out on that goodness because there was only one pie), and a big cake from Publix.  I am guestimating that there were about 40 people there.  Mostly family from Richard's Dad's side of the family, some from his Mom's side, and then my Mom, her boyfriend and my brother.  If you can imagine, my mom, my brother and I were the only white people there.  Oops, no, I take that back.  His cousins wife and one of his cousins ex-girlfriends were there too.  Richard, love of my life, my husband is black, (not an issue, just FYI).  We had a lot of fun; we haven't all been together since our wedding a year ago.  I love being together with family.  I love feeling a part of such a big family.  It's awesome!  So, the party went great.  It started at 5pm and most of the people had left by 10.  Some stayed behind to help clean up; which was greatly appreciated.  We set off some fireworks left over from the 4th ate again and then I went to bed.  The husband stayed up and hung out with the neighbor a bit longer.    Now, today.  I got up, went to church  urlLink Coastal Community Church  in Port St. John (the best!).  Pastor Eric did a great sermon.  He has an awesome way of making stories from the bible come alive, make sense, and relate to things today.  He also makes me laugh.  You can hear his sermons online,  urlLink check it out .  Then, I went home got lazy on the couch and prepared myself mentally for the Round Robin.  Which is an opportunity for all of the softball teams on the housewives league to play each other for the first time.  But, unfortunately, the weather in my area of Florida did not cooperate and the games were cancelled.   That is why, I went to the youth-group church meeting at 4 instead.  I am going on a mission trip with the youth the last week of July.  Tonight I heard more info. about the trip and hung out to get to know the youth better.  I am really looking forward to the trip.  I would tell you more; like how I had to stay and help clean-up the community center and it was more than I bargained for... But, it's late and I'm tired and I think that I have rambled on long enough for today.    I'll catch you, (which so far is nobody) tomorrow. Love you guys, Goodnight

      Today is the day I take my friends three sons to the movies.  We are going to see  urlLink Garfield .  Of course that is not all that I need to do today.  My husband and I are hosting his Dad's retirement party tomorrow, so I need to clean up the house.  I've done two loads of laundry already.  I need to go to the bank, clean, stop by mom's, go to the movies, go to Sue's for homemade pizza, then a Premier meeting in Melbourne at 7pm.  I don't know what my husband is going to do for dinner.  I am too busy to think about it.  And this is supposed to be my vacation!  What am I going to do when we have a child.    I need one more jewelry show in order to earn an extra $100 in free jewelry this month.  Does anyone out there want to host a party?  With all that stuff I need to do, here I sit on the computer... Guess I'll go and get busy.

      I teach so I am off for the Summer (supposedly).  However, I choose to work Summer school 8am-11am Mon. - Fri. for the month of June.  I have also recently taken on my own business of selling jewelry for Premier Designs Inc. and I am playing softball every Tues. and Thurs.  I am happy to be busy, I think.  I am blessed and I've asked God to use this "busy-ness" to help me get myself organized.  You see, I am the type of person that if I do not have anything to do, I won't do anything.  I am a self-proclaimed procrastinator.  I keep hoping that admitting my problems will help me fix them.    Maybe I have adult ADD.    I have no problem sitting still though.  It's just that my thoughts wander...  I think about a hundred different things at once.  All of the thinking gets tiring.  I over think things and then nothing gets done.  The good thing about my now busy schedule is that there is a time that I have to be there, like an appointment.  I have to be at softball practice no thinking involved.  I have to host home shows at peoples' homes to sell jewelry, the times are set.  It seems like I need those musts in order to function.  Here are the hundred things I am thinking now; maybe if I write it, I can let it go.  My husband didn't take his blood pressure medicine this morning, should I take it to him?  He wants me to update his resume for him because he is hating his job  I was supposed to go with my friend to visit her sister today, she was supposed to call me back so that we could set a time.  But, I am on the computer so she can't get through, oh well.  While I am on the computer I should check my bank account balance and see what checks have cleared Then check my credit card accounts  I have to make phone calls to see if people have received their jewelry and if my next hostesses are ready for their parties  I offered to take a friends kids to the movies got to call her and verify day and time  Have to call Sandy to meet her so she can follow me to softball practice today at 5pm  Trash men just came I should bring in the trash can  I should do a load of laundry and a load of dishes  My Dad is 72, I really should go and spend some time with him  My brother is 15 and off for the summer I should spend some time with him too  My husband is hosting a retirement party for his dad at our house this Saturday  I have a home show on Wednesday, and Thursday (I have to miss softball practice)  Our company is having an opportunity meeting Friday evening (when will I help get ready for the retirement party?)  Sunday is the Round Robin and I have home shows next Mon. Tue. and Thur.  I am going on a mission trip with my church's youth group and I am missing the meeting that is on Sunday the same time as the Round Robin  My husband and I are trying to get pregnant.  I am excited; I have been tracking the days and maybe it we did it this month, don't know yet.  Then I'll have to quit softball probably.  I have to get organized...  I would like to paint and decorate some in my house   That's enough for now, my head is starting to spin  Thanks for listening.
