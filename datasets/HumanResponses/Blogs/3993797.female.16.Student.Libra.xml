        Todays a new day. &nbsp;  A better day. Today my family lef to go to NJ, sad but I think Dan and I are goin down for the weekend- a little weekend getaway. But, then again theres a party going on that Ki and I want to go too and we've been waiting for one all summer and the one time I have the chance theres a good possibility I won't be there. Today turned out to be a pretty great day. I called Dan around 10 and we talked and he asked me that around New years we can go down to Florida to see his aunt since she invited his family down he wanted me to come along. Sounds like a great idea to me and I would love to go. Also, Dan and I are going to rent a cabin for a weekend and spend sometime together later in august. Im really excited for that. Now, back to my day- After that he wanted to get together with me and spend the day together so I was like hell ya. But we both still had to take a shower and I had to go grocery shopping for my grandpa first, we ended up gettin together around 11:15 or so and hung out till 10. He taughted me or helped me perfect my learning how to drive a standard, which I got pretty good at, I would give myself an A for the day! ::pats my back::. Well, now I am home alone and scared and lonely, but Sean is keeping me amused and happy for now, until its time for him or I to go to bed :(. He really cracks me up! We really have good times/conversations-There never really dull or ever dull moments with us. We're just two cherry tomatos, wait we dont like tomatos, we're just two nuts in a sack! Muah, yes that is it!!    Yes. Well. I suppose I have written my daily post, so I will let you know more tomorrow as my week home alone continues ( as music plays in the background: DUN DUN DUN)   Readers Voice: Next time on Home Alone VVXIIXI, Jaimie...(Well we dont really know because its not tomorrow) ::whispering in the background to the producer:: "what am I suppose to say now, we havent even filmed tomorrows epipsode?..producer yelling back-JUST FUCKING MAKE SOMETHING UP YOU DOUCHBAGE THATS WHAT WERE PAYING YOU FOR!   ...thank and and thats all the time we have for today people.    &nbsp;  Jaim    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I Love You Dan

        Do we all have one soulmate? One person who we will spend the rest of our life with? One person who we will love unconditionally even of their faults? One person that will be by your side? One person who you fall in love with all over again each time you see them? One person who is   your everything?         It's weird that I've found love so young. Is this it? Is he the 'one'? Is he my soulmate? Is he the one I will spend the rest of my life with? He is the person I love unconditionally even of his faults. Is he the one that be by my side? He is the person I fall in love with all over again each time I see him.   He is my everything.         Is it possible to be in love at this age? Falling in love is possible at any age. Never puppy love to me. It's either  Lust  Or   Love.   I fell in love at 14 and 2 1/2 years later here I am, in love more than I was before. Falling more and more, deeper and deeper in love with him. Knowing all along he's right there with me, behind me in everything I do. Loving me for who I am.  This is love .      Love has thrown obstacles that we've only defeated, coming out stronger than when we went in. I can only hope for more defeats and a stronger relationship.   Together we are everything  .      The time  we spend is priceless .  He is priceless .   He is the  one I fall in love with over again each time I see him  . He is the  person I love unconditionally even of his faults .  He is my best friend .                                                                                 He is my everything.                                                                                                  I Love You.          Jaimie          -Dan, you aree my everything. You are the one I love and will forever. Thank you for everything you have done for me. :)     I love everything about you. You still ROCK my World :) (Even when we're down and dirty) lol. No more dirtyness, thats all for us!     Love You.          Muuuahhh.
