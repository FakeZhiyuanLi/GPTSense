      Wow.. what a crazy past couple weeks....  I bought a porsche 944 turbo then returned it, am selling my car on ebay, have been having difficult time with Teh Woman, etc, etc...  Just tiring as hell.  Its interesting, as I'm continuing to become more and more of my own person, how I find friends in unexpected places and loose them slowly with unexpected friends... it seems to happen to everyone, it just sucks though.  I just need to get out with a bunch of people and have a fun time sometime.. or something.. I haven't done that for a while.   Saw i,Robot today with Nick.. that was a good movie.  I've been like best friends with him since kindergarten, then today he was saying some stuff that kinda pissed me off.. I can't remember the last time he made me feel angry..  I dunno.  We just don't seem to have as much in common as we used to.  Anyways, thats all for now.  I'm tired and fed up with people.

      Well.. its been a couple days since I've blogged.  I've just been working on web design mostly... today I got to drive a 355 Berlinetta Coupe.. '98 and black.. it was pretty fun.. If you don't know what kind of car that is, then do a quick google and you'll find many fast things from italy ;) .  At any rate, I got my book on cocoa programming today, so hopefully I can pick that up too.  I've also been reading a great deal.. this one book "The Color of Water" by James McBride is extremely good.. its about this black boy whos mother is jewish, and just sort of a dual-biography.  Every other chapter is like from his perspective of growing up, and the others are hers.. its pretty neat.  Plus its summer reading, so its required, but its pretty good for a summer reading book.  I talked to Danielle like 5 times today.. that was cool.  I wrote her a really long email yesterday talking about a bunch of stuff.. I guess she liked it because her reply email was this:  "Wow"  =p  so anyways she and I are doing well, I'm glad to say, despite the fact she's in New York for the next couple weeks.  My mood is good in general.. except that i have some rashes breaking out on a couple places.. i think it might be poison ivey.  At any rate, I'll ttyl.

      Well, today I went to a couple of possible business.. possibilities, and have some hope for those to turn out.  Well actually, one was happy wok, but they weren't there for some reason, so I'm going to head over there momentarily to try again.  The other, however, was there and seemed interested.  I might start selling pens through this old black man who owns Mail & More at the new Kroger on mansell road.  He seemed like a real nice guy, and was probably in his late 50's to early 60's.  I showed him some of my pens and told him how much it would cost, and he said he'd think about it.  Hopefully he'll call.. As far as Happy Wok, well, I hope to make an online ordering system for them.  I won't bother with the specifics here though...  Danie's in New York visiting family and will be till the 22nd i think... and I'm leaving for Rhode Island the 23rd.  I miss her a lot.  Anyways, I hope that Morgan actually comes through this time and does the site.. I don't have time for it right now.  I guess if he doesn't hold up his bargain, I may just have to do it myself.. ah well.  Anyways, look for updates on that.  Ta ta for now.

      Alright.  Today's been interesting.. even though my previous post was from today, it was from a completely different day.  I've been so out of it cause of the perkaset, trying to keep the pain down and whatnot...  Anyways, I got some new ideas for various art projects, and coding projects too.. I'll post updates about that soon.  ttyl

      Current Events:  July 4th, Been going out with Danie for 10 months, got a powerbook, gotten into art (kinda), stuff like that.  I've also heavily gotten into business.  I currently work at a used car dealership doing the website -  urlLink Autohaus Webb  - and I get to drive around those cars some.  I've been coming up with various other ideas, such as pen making, and web design.  Now to just put them into action.  Oh yeah, and I've been reading good books (The Color of Water).  Anyways, I'm going to check out the blogger api tonight, and hopefully within the next couple days I will have created a blogging app for os x that will make it so I needn't blog through blogger.com itself, rather so that I can just type and edit and whatnot through a program on my comp.  This blog will probably be a variety of personal, technical, philosophical, business-oriented, and just plain rambling blogs, so I hope you enjoy this as much as I hope I do.

      Well, here I am unable to sleep due to rapid thoughts running rampid through my head.  I'm probably going to redesign the autohaus webb website (again) but make it very very good and am figuring out how much to charge, what to do, etc... I think I'm going to make it really cool this time.  Anyways, I had braimstorms while trying to fall alseep, so I woke up to jot down my ideas.  Schools started and thats fun.  I like all my classes and teachers except for ap calc.  I love calc, don't get me wrong, its just that the teacher, to all appearances, is boring as hell.  I hope to find some method of entertainment in that class.  My last two periods of the day are both directed study (aka do whatever I like for a grade) so thats a nice way to end the day.  uhm.. yeah.  bye
