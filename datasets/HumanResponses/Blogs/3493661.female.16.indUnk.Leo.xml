      so today wasnt that interesting. just cleaning and being the parents chore bitch. the best part was that i saw my  brycey !!! yay. it was only for maybe ten minutes at the very most but it was the best ten minutes of the day. so i definatly cant wait for tomorrow because i get to fail my english final, kick major ass at my global final, and have a picnic with  bryce , angela, maybe travis, kayla, and maybe davey. so yeah after reading  bryces  blog thingy (and talking to him about it) i do understand about the whole trusting people when alcohol is involved. and since i dont want to lose him ever im going to watch what i do more carefully.  hehehhe donald trumps hair is so damn ugly. stupid rich people.  bryce  doesnt get off work for like two or three more hours and it completly sucks ass because i really want to talk to him. it going to be a long 59 days untill i turn 16 and am able to see him whenever i want.  forever and ever

      lying here in a secret solemn silence
watching the pitch black insides of my lightly closed eyelids.
listening to the tears pour softly down my cheek.
feeling the bitter coldness creep upon me.
waiting for you to come, in the darkness of the day.
wanting your lips to touch my lips for one last gentle night's sleep.

      JIZZUS!! hehehehe anglea is so neat! so im over at her house right now. my parents are freaking out because they think i snuck out today to see bryce. which is only half true. so i cant hang out with any guys. its so messed up. i saw brycey at albertsons. (he is so cute :>) we got into this mini disagreement thingy. he said that he oesnt really now what i might do when im drunk. and i got offended (dont ask me why im just dumb lke that) but so i feel bad now. after we (angela and i) left i was talking to her about it and she said that he does have a reason to feel protective about that because of my history of being drunk. but i swear i could never ever do that to him. i love him way toooo much. for ever and ever bryce!! i find it really hard to focus on other things than bryce lately and it sucks because i never get anything done. all i do is sit around and mope because i dont get to see him. mind my just doesnt want to stop thinking about him and how good he is to me. i dont quite understand why he is so sweet, but hey im lucky to have found the PERFECT thts right i said perfect guy for me. well peace out dawgs.

      SO this is definatly one of the coolest things i've done. it's 11:51 and i dont want to sleep. So i have been thinking a lot and i have come to the conclusion that my parents are mentaly ill!! im so angry at them. I love Bryce to death but i ddont think they want us to be together. i really want to grow old with him which is really scary, but i really do. my parents just think that im some fuck up. maybe i am but when i finally get happy they tend to screw it up some how. i wish bryces family was mine. they are so awesome. i just dont get why i had to be born into this family

      Swim through these waters
My lungs collapse as I'm gasping for air
I'll breathe you in (and I'll breathe you in)
You are my oxygen alone

Through arteries untold, your skin is pale, my body's cold
Way down, deep down in my lungs
I can hear our sweet decay

So spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
Midnight skies turn scarlet red
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall into the night
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall

Everyone and everything feels like it slips away
Way down deep down in my lungs, I can hear you as you fade

So spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
Midnight skies turn scarlet red
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall into the night
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall

Wake me up from this nightmare
Wake me up, I know that i am drowning in the blood
Wake me up from this nightmare
Wake me up, I know I am drowning in the blood from a pitch black heart
Cut my throat
Spill my blood
Pitch black heart

So spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
Midnight skies turn scarlet red
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall into the night
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall

      so yesterday was a skank trio day. it was pretty fucking rad. we went to the record exchange and then went to main street and walked around. angela wanted to find someone but not much luck because there was a lot of mexicans.  and old people. we watched sex in the city untill 330 in the damn morning it was grand. now im at daveys house and were just chilling. i like davey. he makes me laugh.  hmmm... tomorrow is fathers day and my fathers leaving at noon and my mother wont be home untill 6 or so. meh i guess i could us the time alone.  i have determined im obsessed with sex in the city thanks to my lovely angela. god that show is the greatest. bryce and i had are own day. like where it was just him and i all day. it was so great i wish i could have more of those days because i love him and i love how he makes me feel. nicolle called me today and asked if i was going out with bryce and i told her yes and she hung up. what a dumb bitch. well if shes going to be that way then she can find another best friend. thats pretty sad because i have known her for eight years and shes still a dumb whore. grrr fucking girls i hate them all except kayla and angela and sarah. i love the skank trio most of all. thank you kayla and angela for being there.

      so i just figured out that i tend to nit-pick about every little god damn thing. i guess im just a big fucking screw-up. damn it. i cant do anything right. i called bryce and he said his phone died and i didnt believe him but i didnt really give a shit because im not that kind of girlfriend to freak out at that kind of shit. so i blew it off and said whatever because all i wanted to do is listen to his voice. but he flipped and thought i was pissed or something. holy god i didnt care. i just read his blog and i guess i start fight or disagreements everyday and i really dont mean to and i feel bad and i wish i could change. i still dont believe that he hasnt dumbed my sorry ass yet. its been exactly one month today and hes put up with all my shit. hes a great kid. i would rather he tell me what bugs him about me to my face, ya know. but at least he has the nerve to tell me. meh whatcha gonna do. im listening to a new cd i got. its coheed and cambria and it rocks. i love it so much but their other one is still better. i went to the mall with my aunt and a 17 year old was hitting on her. it was so funny because shes like 34 married and has two kids. i really want to grow up to be just like her. she has the perfect husband the perfect kids and the perfect life. shes just all around happy. also she collects action figures, how hardcore is that. well im out

      blah blah blah. i woke up to my grandpa preaching to my 5 year old cousin. oh joy. poor little kid he never saw it coming. so lets see i need to catch up on recent events. last saturday bryce andgela tory kayla and i went to daveys house because his parents werent home. jason was there and drunk as fuck he was. well bryce and i got into the dumbest fight and broke up but within a few minutes we got back together. it was sad. i never want to do that again. ummm. my aunt and i are going shopping today and then when the kids go to sleep sandro and karen and i are going to watch bowling for columbine. i have seen most of it but i liked it a lot. i recommend it highly. then tomorrow i get to go home! this is pretty sad because i have never known a time when i wanted to leave utah to go back to idaho so badly. i guess its because bryce angela kayla and tory are in idaho and i love them all. wow these plane tickets are really impossible to figure out so i cant tell what time im coming home. i think its around noon. i have used 180 minutes talking to bryce on my grandmas phone card. i feel kind opf bad but ill give her 10 bucks and that will give her 200 minutes. heheh im smart.

      this is sad. i havent written in this thing for a week and a half or something like that. its pretty pathetic. i feel as though ive been left out. oh well. im in utah and my grandpa is complaining because he wants to go to bed but i want to write. hmmmm. i really really really really miss bryce right now but i can only talk to him on the phone because im about 6 hours away. my aunt just had surgery to remove some lump in her throat and it turned out to be non cancerous(sp?) i had to babysit for 8 hours. without pay too. im excited to be typing again. i wish i had a computer at home. all of thursday i get to spend with bryce and NO ONE ELSE! yeah! im happy about that. i found out that this jason guy really really likes me and its sad because i love bryce and he despretly (sp?) wants to be with me. he keeps begging kayla and davey to "hook us up." poor kid. hes extremely cool but i could never leave bryce. we need to find him some one and quick! oh i got my new cell phone. the number is 353-7995 incase you need anyone needs to know. i feel bad about jason and i need ideas of how to let him down nicely. so no more drinking for katie. i have stopped for bryce. hes afraid that i might cheat on him with some drunk guy. it makes sense, ya know? and i wouldnt want to cheat on him. i got my hair cut and i love it but i want it a little shorter. bryce might be mad because its not as short as he wanted it but oh well whatcha gonna do? man this is a long ass blog. rachel and bo are back together!! ahhhhh! so much drama. he needs to stop lying! if bryce lied like that i would kill him but he doesnt and i love him for it. and angela feel happy!!! got to go. buh-bye

       so yesterday was a really great day. i went with bryce to get his new tattoo. he got an emo star right on his chest, it looks really good. he was bleeding so much during it. i told him he could squeeze my hand when it starts to hurt so he did and at one point my hand was completely white. i had no feeling in it so that was good i guess. then i came home and did nothing. so i called jacob and then i went over to his house and we waited for sarah bo and this kid named matt. (this is the big adventure part.) when they arrived we called chandler bell to see where he was. when we called he would either pick up and hang up or his skanky girlfriend britni would pick up. they told us they were at a rodeo in the idaho center. so we went there and the whole way there we kept calling him and he turned off his phone so we left nasty messages. he owes a lot of people money so matt was getting angry that he hadnt gotten his $15 back. so when we got to the idaho center we found his car instantly. so we called him and his gf picked up and said he was at home. shes so dumb. we were right in front of his car. how could he of been at home? so matt went up to the gate to explain our situation to see if maybe matt could go in at least. well she decided to give us all free tickets to go find him. so we went in. we had just started looking for him when i looked up and saw him look me right in the eyes then cover his face. so we all went up there and matt asked nicely for his money. chandler whipped out his wallet full of $20's and gave him $5. so matt got really angry and&nbsp;told him not to be and asshole. chandler couldnt stop asking how we got in here and britni looked at us with this dumb look on her face. finally he gave the money back and we left. then we went to the record exchange. we hung out there for an hour and a half. it was fun. then we went cruising (sp?) then bo got pulled over and then jake did. it sucked but luckily no one got a ticket, just warnings. we went to torys and then bryce showed up . we all just bum,med around until everyone noticed that bo was gone. he wasnt in his car or anywhere. jake and i looked for a while but then sarah, matt, and i had to go home. jake wouldnt give up until he found bo. finally bo called me and he was okay but he just kept lying to me and rachel the whole night. so i just gave up and went to bed. right as i started to sarah called and we talked for a half an hour and then i crashed. all in all it was a good day.

      well bryce and i went out yesterday. we went to the movie anchorman again and it was even better the second time. when we got to the movie theater he carried me up the stair (i dont exactly know why) when we got to our seats bryce and i were both looking down and he turned his head and smacked me right in the fucking head. we (mostly me)&nbsp;laughed for ten minutes. it was great. then when the movie got out we were walking to the car and i asked him a question. he turned his head and i was expecting him to answer me but nope he just sneezed on me. this lady that saw it just started cracking up. i think she laughed more than we did. then we went back to his house. we were&nbsp;just laying around and laughing. it was great.&nbsp; i have been having so much fun with him lately. he makes me so happy. theres no more fighting either.

      yeah!! i so ended my geometry summer school with a 78% i know its not much but thats the best grade i have gotten in math since 6th grade. oh yeah. im just waiting for bryce to get off work so we can hang out. oh yeah, were done fighting for a very long time! finaly i will stop bitching at him and we will never fight again. last night he came over after work and it was neat. my mom was home so we did the whole shamless flirting thing like what you do when youre little. it was so fun. i liked it a lot and this is why ive decided to stop making plans with other people when we have plans and stop bitching and all the other crap i do wrong. last night was fun and we were both happy with no fighting. i liked it a lot. so thats kind of made my week really really good!! its kind of like we started our relationship over. "sweeped the plate clean" or something but whatever it is i love it! i woke him up this morning at 8 so he could go to work and it was so cute. he sounded all grogy and drowsy it was cute! if only i could wake up to is voice. or him next to me would be better. i have an appt. at plan parenthood thursday. its going to be so fun j/k dawg. oh joy, and bryce gets to come. thats good that he'll be there to make me happy! yeah. ahhh i hope he gets off work so i get to see him soon!! well im sure youre all sick of hearing about bryce... bye.

      Oh well, you've got me under your spell and I don't think that I'm kidding around. I don't think I can forget you now. I once sat up on my roof and examined the planning of my town. I saw the structured grid and pavement cutting through grass and I remembered the cold of winter running up the legs of my pants. I picked the nicest lawn and imagined the two of us rolling around down along the ground. I saw myself touch your face and I noticed jets begin to race above our heads. But I pinched my arm and remembered how much you hate me. I remembered the fact that I can't see what you need and I'm too stupid to be aware of the beauty that you give this place and how shitty this town would seem without you in it. When you aren't around I let the shades fall down to shut out all the sun's light and make myself feel all right. What am I doing with my life? Remember that the only things we need sometimes are chilly nights and warmer thighs, 'cause there's nothing like being held.

      yep. i have definatly figured out that every time something goes wrong in bryce and my relationship it is all my fault. i made big plans with bryce for today and he didnt know when he was getting off work i decided to go hang out with angela and kayla. then he called me like 20 minutes later. so naturally we got into a fight because i couldnt go see him. man i hate fighting but i hate it more when its with him.&nbsp; i wish i didnt make other plans. he always thinks that i make plans with other people when its a just me and him day, that i dont want to hang out with him. its so not what that is. i really dont know why i do it. i love hanging out with bryce. i really do. its my fault and i will try to change the dumb things i do.&nbsp;

       well today is angelas birthday so HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANGELA! man its been a long time since i have written on here. ummmm today bryce and i were supose to go to horseshoe bend but something went wrong. i dont know what. most of the time when we make plans they get screwed up. hopefully i get to see him tho. man his mom found out that we have had sex. she keeps telling me that she wishes that we waited but yeah. she wants to sit down and have a conversation about it. no. i dont want to. no. i wont. i know i should but i dont want to. that is so damn embarassing. god. now im going to plan parent hood and i might start getting the shot.which i also dont know what im going to do about. we had our two month anniversary two days ago. which is neat. he started chewing a couple days after i asked him not to. which is really nasty. my brother does it and i dont kiss him anymore. bryce is lucky that i still do kiss him. just the fact that he promised that he wouldnt and he did is kind of a let down. but i got to believe the truth until i can prove otherwise. nothing really other thatn that is going on. so yea. i got to go hang with my skank trio.

      so theres this rad kid named jason in my geometry class. its fun because we just sit in the very back of the class and talk. today we got into a conversation about if someone close to me died what i would do. it got me thinking, is there more to life than what we think? do we waste life away spending time writting in our blogs, watching the tube, or other fun, but pointless activities. could there be something we could work for. like towards a greater cause or something. or are we just here just to be here? thats leads into the whole meaning of life question. then to the question of how we got here and other questions that are to remain unanswered. thats trippy shit man. its deep... far deeper than i could ever answer. hehe. thats about all that is bugging me. well that and im still trying to figure out what that stuff is that they put in strech armstrong. ya know that little doll that you can strech out and hell never rip. i had one i was little and have been stumped ever since...

      well today sucks, yesterday sucked, and tomorrows bound to suck. i hate being away from home. my dad and i were getting along and then he started being the normal asshole that he is. my mom told me shed give me $5000 if i ran away and my dad said he wouldnt pay me but he still does want me to run. i wonder what would happen if i did. theyd probibly send me to juvy. or send me to permenently live in morman land. ive been thinking a lot about the whole relgion topic. kayla says that as long as you have faith in some after life type thing then your good to go. i really would like to have something to fall back on and to believe in, ya know. i dont believe in organized religion but at the same time i would kind of like to. angela i know youre probibly having a fit reading this thinking of what happened to the old katie, but im just kind of sick of how my life is going. mainly its my parents but then theres other tiny shit that gets to me. i wonder if i find religion with bryce then my parents might let us be together...maybe. probibly not but its worth a shot i guess. my mom wants me to be morman but i think that the lds religion suck ass and is a cult but what do i know. ahhh. i need to stop because my heads starting to hurt. i just want to be home. i love you guys back in idaho. happy 4th of july.

      HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS - The Transition

Album: The Silence In Black And White (2004)


so here we are
back to the start again
trying hard to wait till morning
hey rise and shine
and open up your eyes
to give this world some color
shine on diamond eyes
seperate the space
between love and lies

and as days go by, the memories remain
i'll wait for you
and as days go by, the memories remain
i won't let go

these days remain the same
pictures fade away

please don't ever change
please don't change your mind
no matter what they say
i'll always wait

and as days go by, the memories remain
i'll wait for you
and as days go by, the memories remain
i won't let go

these days remain the same
pictures fade away

i hope you never fade
as you drip through my veins
shine on, shine on diamond eyes
shine on, shine on diamond eyes
shine on, shine on diamond eyes

and as days go by, the memories remain
i'll wait for you

as days go by i swear i'll try
(i'll wait for you) until i die, anything for you
[to fade]

      well its been an odd start to my yrip. while we were on the road we were stuck in traffic on the freeway for an hour because there was an awful wreck! soem people died. and then i find out that constitine(sp?) bryces car is broken forever! i loved that car so much. oh well. so i guess bryce and angela drank beers and watched porn together last night. hmm. that sounds odd. and it is. wow. he tells me he wont drink without me and he does, but angela says that he was stressed so i guess its okay. its kind of like i was at his house when he was gone and dring beer and watching porn with anthonie..i mean its just odd and im kind of weirded out by it. i trust both of them but i just am a little sad about it. well im done whining to whomever is reading this.

      god i suck ass. so today was so fucking great. i mean doing jack shit in summer school, falling asleep in the arms of my bryce, playing video games with friends... need i say more but then i just had to screw it up. its like something was tempting me to, taunting me, ya know. so i did i got hella fucking stressed. bryce pulled me into the other room and i broke down. it sucked. just looking into his eyes, i could see that i had screwed things up. he looked so hurt. i just couldnt stop crying and then when i finally calmed down i just looked into his eyes and saw how upset he looked and i got more stressed out. he just kind of shrugged it off like it was no big thing but i could tell that he was extremely hurt. why the hell do i always turn good things bad? its just a curse i guess. damn i hate myself. i hate the way i make bryce feel when i do shit like this. he doesnt deserve it, but he puts up with it. i dont get it. i love him so much. the last thing i want is to screw things up with the one i love. im trying hard to stop stressing so much and i guess it will all be good in due time. why cant that time come sooner? i just loved being in his arms. i felt so safe and so loved. i wish i could just lay there forever, wraped up in him!
