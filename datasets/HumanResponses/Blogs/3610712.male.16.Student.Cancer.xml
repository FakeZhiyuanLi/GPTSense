      Sarah awoke not long after I posted the last entry. I made her eggs and toast for breakfast. The rest of the day was basically watching movies and enjoying eachother's company. The movies we watched were Goldmember, Bruce Almighty, and Nothing to Lose. Sarah left me at approximately 4 pm. It was sad. I miss her. Now I must stay alive to see her again. Goodnight.

      Long night last night. Sarah has been here since about 12:40 pm yesterday. She's asleep as I type. I love her so much. I can't put into words how much she means to me. Yesterday we watched some home movies, Boondock Saints, Cast Away, and There's Something About Mary. We watched TV from about 1 o'clock in the morning to almost 6 in the morning. Now she's asleep, I woke up at 8 and just took a shower, and I can't wait for her to get up. Talk to you later, bye.

      Yesterday I went to the Flower Festival and walked around with Sarah, Lauren, and Alex. Oh yeah, and Jeff Gordon won at Infineon. Score. Bye.

      This was a long day, but my best one in a very long time. I woke up a little early on account of excitement (10 am). My Sarah came over at noon and then we left for the Flower Festival around 12:30. We walked around and walked around until 4 pm, when we came home. Sarah and I watched Detroit Rock City, Almost Famous, and Road to Perdition. After that we watched Zoolander on TBS and then we watched a documentary on sex during the Civil War. She just left, so it has indeed been a long, full day of Sarah. Many more of those are needed. That is all now. Goodbye.

      Well, well, well. I haven't written in awhile. Not much has transpired since I last made an entry, but I will try to summarize as best I can. On the 22nd, I basically did nothing, just slept and played videogames. On the 23rd, I was supposed to get my driver's license but there was a fuck up, so I had to reschedule the test for July 1st. Yesterday I slept, sat around, watched the NBA Draft (the Lakers chose Sasha Vujacic and Marcus Douthit, woohoo), then cleaned my room. Then I talked to my Sarah for awhile, after which leaving to watch a movie and go to sleep. Today my dad woke me up at noon to tell me that he was leaving for the beer garden at the Flower Festival. After being awakened, I got on the computer and chatted it up. Sarah left at 2:30 to go practice for the parade tomorrow, so I mowed the grass and then took a shower. And now I am here. That is all. Tchao.

      16. Doesn't feel much different. Granted I have my own truck in the garage now, plus I have more money in my wallet...I expected sixteen to feel different. Sixteen is the age when you're supposed to become older, not just in the quantatitive sense, but in the qualitative sense as well. Maturity sets in when you're sixteen. You become mellow and the foundation of your adulthood is laid. I have felt like that for a long time, but still, it should feel a little different. Oh well, maybe seventeen.  Last night I went to the movies with Sarah to see "Dodgeball," it was excellent, but the movie was mediocre at best. Then last night I fell asleep while watching "The Empire Strikes Back." I awoke this afternoon at 1 o'clock and then left at 1:45 to go driving with Drivemaster Bill. I drove around for about an hour and a half. Then I got home, played Playstation for a good while, then my mom and I went out to get my cake when she got home. After the celebration of adding a six after the one in place of the five, I went back to Playstation and then got on the computer. That was my sixteenth Birthday, capitan.

      I just got back from Randall's house. Eric, Randy, and I busted out the mad funk grooves for a few hours then retired. My dear Sarah showed up, and I was able to give her a great big hug. We then watched The Last Samurai, which is a very cool movie indeed. After that Sarah and I watched the Tetris masters (Randall and Zack) test their skills against eachother while eating popcorn, looking through National Geographics and discussing The Mall in Washington, D.C. After that I made an unsuccessful pilgrimage to Randy's computer in an effort to find the "I Love the 90's" promo commercial. We then watched a flash, and then I left. Goodnight.

      Mediocre day. I woke up at noon, which was too early. I watched Zoolander and tried to sleep, but then I remembered I had to take my grandma to the doctor for her Calcitonin injection. Then I got home and talked to Sarah for a bit, then the Lakers played. They lost the NBA Finals 4-1 to the Pistons. That sucks. Oh well. Then I got on the computer again and have been on ever since. Good. Adios.

      Well, went to a party last night. My lovely Sarah was there. I've missed her a lot and it was nice telling her I love her in person again. Also attending was Luke, Eric, Jay, Sarah A., and Yamina.  urlLink Altisonus  played for about an hour, then we sat around and talked and Luke, Eric, and Yamina performed satanic rituals. Then I got home at about 12:30 then got on and talked to Sarah on AIM until about 4 a.m. Then I watched Fox & Friends on Fox News until it started getting light outside, forcing me to hide under my blanky.

      The first official day of summer vacation is today. My expectations for this summer are high, and if they go correctly, I will become a much more complete individual and will begin the new school year very prepared. My confidence is high after my chat with my English teacher Mrs. Nicastro so I feel quite well in that respect. I have created this blog to keep myself busy this summer, and also to log my goings-on and such. Not a Sophomore, not yet a Junior. I bear no academic title as of this point...I am the Prophet.

      Sorry about the cease in updates...my fair computer was singled out and attacked by a virus. Yes, it's ok. I won. Over the past several days all I've done is pretty much hung out with Sarah and slept. That is all. Thank you for your patience. Dovacina.

      And here's my summary. On Saturday the 10th, I had to pick up Sarah and Master Luke on the way to Eric's house to play. We played nearly all of the Ã†nima album and quite a bit of the Undertow album. Then Sarah and I walked around for awhile and went to Cabrillo and talked. Then we returned, played some more, and left. On Sunday, Sarah came over at about noon and we watched the NASCAR race and watched a few movies. Then she went home at about 12:30 am. Good times. Auf wiedersehen.

      I really need to update this thing everyday. Damn. And now my summary. On Monday, I went to Sarah's house and we watched Big Fish. Afterwards we drove around for a long, long time. On Tuesday I sat around and slept and did random things. On Wednesday Sarah and I went to the Village Hills Little League field and talked with Mike, Eric, and Cindy. Afterwards, me and Sarah went to Mervyn's, Albertson's and Walmart to buy goodies. Yesterday, which was coincidentally Thursday, Sarah and I went to the Gaviota beach and hung out with the likes of Eric, Cindy, Jay, and his Sarah. After awhile, we grew bored, so Sarah and I fled to Goleta and went shopping. We went back to the beach and sat around for an hour and a half or so, and then returned to Lompoc. Then we watched a few movies and enjoyed eachother's company. Good. Bye bye.

      It's been awhile since I last updated, hasn't it? Kooky. And now my summary. On Friday, Eric, Randy and I played musik while Sarah kept me warm. Then we watched Gladiator and then sat around. On Saturday, Sarah and I went to Eric's to play more musik with Master Luke. Sarah and I went to Cabrillo and walked around for awhile, then came back and watched the Pepsi 400 on TV. Jeff Gordon won again...score. Then yesterday I went to Huyck Stadium to watch the fireworks with Sarah and then went back to her house to watch a movie. Good times. Goodbye.

      I did it. I got my driver's license today. Score. Hooray. Booyah. I win. You lose. After passing the test (only got five errors), I ate pizza and then drove around. My sister and I picked up Sarah and we went to Morninglory and Walmart. I bought a few CD's, a DVD and some deodorant. Then we drove by the prison and drove through the Village and I dropped off Sarah. Then we came home. Good deal. Goodbye.

      Did you? Ha! And now my summary. Shah. On Saturday, Tanzen minus me played at Erin Cook's birthday party and supposedly they were quieted by the police. Meanwhile I was doing yard work and then Sarah and I went with Ravin and Dana to Santa Maria. We ate at Applebee's and drove around a little. Then we came back and picked Luke up from the party. After that we drove around with Randy following us, and we eventually ended up at Eric's house. Sarah, Luke, and I were pretty tired, so we went to his house and spent the night. On Sunday Sarah, Eric, Luke, Randy, and I hung out at my house, at chicken, and played Playstation. Randy left and eventually Eric had to leave, so we decided to go to Eric's house. We drove over to Cindy's, then walked to Cabrillo. Luke had his camera in hand and interviewed us and such on campus. It was quite entertaining. After that we went to Starbucks and then came back to my house. Sarah, Luke, and I watched television for a long time, then fell asleep. I woke them up at 5 am and told them to go home. It was good times. Au revoir. Thank you. Goodbye.

      Wop. Yes. And now my summary. Yesterday, my beloved Sarah showed up unexpectedly, as you should know. Much to my surprise, she showed up again after her doctor's appointment! Ha! So then we hung out for awhile, cleaned up my room, etc. Then Eric, Luke, and an avocado showed up. Eric made guacamole then we played in my family room unplugged while Luke's new video camera recorded it all. It was a trip, to say the least. Then Eric had to leave at midnight, so we brought out Tony Hawk Underground and played Playstation for a good while. Eventually, Sarah fell asleep whilst constricted in my embrace and Luke pretty much passed out unexpectedly. I was left alone, so I did what every young white male does...I watched Blade. After that was over, I alerted Sarah that she should take Luke home, so she did. Consequently she went home, too. That was last night. Today I woke up at 11 am and my mommy got me Taco Bell for breakfast. Good times. Thank you. Bye.

      Why, hello there. And now my summary. Yesterday my lovely Sarah and I went to Santa Maria. Sarah needed to get some clothes for her senior pictures and I needed some clothes for school, so we went to the Mall. We shopped for about four or five hours, and then we drove home. After that, we watched "Starsky &amp; Hutch" and "13 Going on 30." It was good times. I woke up at my usual time today (11-11:30 am), and promptly got on the computer. We were supposed to go to the Lit concert at the Mid State Fair, but there's been a change of plans. Sarah was over about an hour ago...she brought me ice cream. I love her. Alrighty. Goodbye.

      What a long, good day. Ah yes. And now my summary. Last night I hung out with Sarah, then we went to the theater to see "I, Robot." 'Twas swell. Will Smith is one talented beeyitch. Then today we went to Solvang. We walked around for like five hours. We had chips and salsa and Cream Soda at the Viking Garden, ate pizza while watching Bill O'Reilly at Tower Pizza, and then ate Ã†belskiver. After that we drove to Lake Cachuma and stared blankly at the Bradbury Dam for awhile. Then we decided to drive through Los Olivos and Los Alamos, after which we decided to drive through Guadalupe. Since we were close enough, we went to Santa Maria. Sarah had a gift card for Best Buy, so we went there and she got Massive Attack's "100th Window." Good choice, according to my not-so-humble opinion. Then we drove back to Lompoc, and I went home. Excellent. Flabtabulastic. Cool. Okay. That is all. Thank you, goodbye.

      I'm back. Don't ask where I've been, because that is most likely nowhere. Except for yesterday, pretty much. Sarah got back from Lake San Antonio on Friday night, so naturally we were going to go have some fun the next day. Yesterday we went to Eric's, where we played like four Tool songs, before ending due to hunger. Then we went to Subway and Mr. Taco, followed by Cindy's house to eat. After we ate, we went back to Eric's to pick up equipment and stuff. Then I drove Luke to his hotel and he got ready for his quasi-date with Yamina. So then I drove him to Yamina's, then we drove to the beach. Sarah and I walked around while Luke and Yamina sat in one of the enclosures at the train station. After awhile, we went to Southside. Sarah and I drank Italian Cream Sodas while Luke inquired about what it takes to gig at that venue. After that, I took Yamina and Luke home. By that time it was about 9:15, so Sarah and I decided to go see "The Village." It was pretty good overall, I think. And that is all for now. Goodbye.
