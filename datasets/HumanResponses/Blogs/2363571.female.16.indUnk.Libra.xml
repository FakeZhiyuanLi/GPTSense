      More adventures...  Dropped off at Target. Walked from Target to Walgreens to Big Lot to Craftsmart then to Walmart then to Staple and back to Walmart, then started to head back to Target but saw my parents driving so I chased after them with my cousin... Then we drove to Walmart because my parents wanted to check something out. Then drove back to Target because my cousin and I had unfinished business. Visted Walmart 3 times. Target twice.  Cousing bought 1000 piece puzzle. Worked on it for rest of the day... I think there are missing pieces. :/

      I've been going to Wal*Mart and Target everyday for the past three days... When I wake up from tonight's rest, I will be going to those places again. If only I had a list of things to buy before I went shopping, I would have finished it all in one journey to the store instead of 4 separate times... Actually.. about 6 separate times. I believe it was two days ago I went to Target... then to Wal*Mart... then to Target again... and then back to Wal*Mart.   Journeying is fun. :)  Hope everyone's shopping went more smoothly.

      Every night for the past two days (so many days), I have had a sudden urge to do something. Two nights ago was the urge to write. I ended up writing 15 pages (front and back) in my journal. Yesterday, I had the urge to read. After writing a page in my journal, I ended up reading about... Hmm... 5 pages of Phantom and the Tollbooth (or something like that... sorry, bad with titles). Tonight, I had an urge to clean. I ended up cleaning my computer desk, so now I have room to write on it. The random sheets of paper sprawled across my desk started to get on my nerves... I feel a smidgen better. :) I felt like tidying up my room a bit as well... but it's almost 2 a.m. I told my cousin I'm going to do it, so... I guess I will when I decide to finally get off line. You know what? Tonight I also have an urge of typing. Thank goodness I have this lil' doohickie to type whatever, whenever.   I enjoy my online time when I actually find something to do. Hey, everyone get Yahoo IM so we can doodle together on one of the IMvirmont. Tis be fun... to the extreme. Or, download Shockwave (if needed) and play Inklink with me. Pictionary games are quite interesting. Though I really hate it when people ruin it by doing foul things. Dang fouly people.  I have bunny ears on my moniter. lol.. heh. They are cute.   Anyone have an extra hole-puncher or an extra speaker that you can plug into a CD player?  My 23-year-old cousin Meme said to me today, "Call me up so we can hang out now that you're old enough." (So that explains why we have never hung out before... Oh, she's so nice.) I never realized how young I really was before the age of 16. I know that I am still young... but I feel old. I have been refered to as an old man before.  I've been typing all  night, and my fingers are still cold. I now question whether or not typing warms your fingers up. I prefer typing than writing... Calluses be gone! Is there an ointment to make callusses disappear? Or am I going to have to be the creator of such a product?  ... dude... I wonder if anyone is going to actually read this whole thing...  Do you believe in ghosts?

      It appears that people like people more if they notice that they can propose something deep and thought-provoking. Or say something simple, yet beautiful, in two words.  Interesting.

      Is pain and expenses worth it for better looks?  Some people think that plastic surgery is wrong, but what about braces? It's expensive and people get them so their smile will look better; yet braces are accepted by all.   My mouth is in so much pain.

      Day #2 in entry.  Talking to people that you don't usually talk to is fun. For once I am glad that we had the Petriekis project because it allowed me to converse with people that I don't usually talk to. If it weren't for it, I would not have been able to get to know them. Well, I mean, I would still be able to... Just not on my own willingness because I'm too shy to just randomly talk to people about things (this contradicts me running to strangers  on bikes asking them to come over so Christie can ask them to be in a video to dance around.) That was pretty fun.   Anyway, yes. I miss the social life that I never truly had. Not complaining though, because the quiet night is peaceful as well.   My parents come back home tonight... Along with my cousin and aunt! Excited.   `'I`'miss`'my`'oldest'`'brother`'

      Sometimes I feel really motivated to just type. Sometimes there is no one online to type to, or if there is someone, I don't think they'll enjoy my constant rambling. By using this nifty blogger thing, I can type to my desire. Whoopie!...   Well, since today will be my first real entry, I should say something that's worth saying... But I don't.   I'm sorta talking to my cousin online at the same time. She was born here, but she moved to Hong Kong when she was little and begun her schooling there. Now, at the age of 16, she is coming to live at my house to continue her schooling in the U.S. I fear that it may be difficult for her because of the language... But she's a smart girl, she understands my English... Even better than when I try to speak Chinese. lol. Pathetic. I wish I had both the English tongue and the Chinese tongue... If that makes any sense.   My fingers are cold. Typing warms it up. Tee hee...

      I think my snails have passed away... Poor things... I feel bad for not feeling bad. :/ Shame on me... I was never attatched to them.... :(   I spent learning Chinese at the restaurant today (my cousin decided to come with. Yes, I still worked, but when there was nothing to do, I finished my homework and learned how to write some more characters). It was pretty fun. Then I compared my cursive with my cousin's. Hong Kong's cursive is more elaborate... It's all... -Pretty- with so many curvatures and such. Good stuff.  I have a Chinese elementary song in my head... It goes like this:  yut yee sahm, sahm yee yut, yut yee sahm saye mmm luck tzut, yee sahm saye, saye sahm yee, saye mmm luck tzut baht gou sup.  Translation: One two three, three two one, one two three four five six seven, two three four, four three two, four five six seven eight night ten.   Tee hee!  Movies that I want to watch: The Big Fish and The Perfect Score (Those are the titles right?)

      Today there was a Spanish Club outing at Macayos. The food was mighty delectable and the company was pleasant. Must say it was interestingly.... (Hmm...)... Interesting. =D Teeg, heeg.   I have several pet snails in a fish bowl. They were multiplying in my brother's fish tank and eating all of his plants. HA! Poor things.   My forehead itches. :/

      Why do I even take harder classes... when my mother tells me not to push myself?  Saturdays are no longer fun. They are dedicated to going to my parent's restaurant in Tempe. This means I wake up at 8am to go there... and come back home at 10pm. Every Saturday. And that means I cannot go to see the play that Katherine is in... Even if her school is just less than five minutes from the restaurant. I cannot.  I still need a topic for my persuasive essay. I wasted the past three days of English class doing nothing.   Something in my Life isn't currently running correctly.

      I want to get to know people... I don't just want them to be aquaintances. I don't just want to say "hi" to you when we pass. Let's hold a conversation so I can get to know you, and if you want, get to know me... The problem with that is that I can't hold conversations, since I'm bad at speaking in person. I'm a listener. If anyone has anything to say... I'm a listener...

      I didn't expect today to be as good as it really turned out to be. I went to my mother's restaurant to help out. We walked over to KFC's for lunch and one of the workers asked how to spell their name in Chinese. So then my cousin and I went back to the reastaurant to think of some pronunciations similar to how you spell his name. One of the pronounciations for the name translated to "bird doo-doo" and another one translated to "borrow doo-doo". Wow, I found that really amusing. I am so immature. heh. After that, we went back to KFC and gave him the list of pronounciations that may match his name. Afterwards, my cousin and I ventured to Big Lots where we spent in hour just aimlessly walking around and looking for an assortment of rings. I finally found a ring that I liked. Hopefully it won't get all deformed or something that would make it be added to my necklace collection of rings. Then around 7ishPM, Katherine visits me and then we call Bridgette and she comes to visit. I haven't seen Bridgette in two years, so it was awesome seeing them again. Gee willikers, they are so funny. I missed them. It's hard to keep in touch with friends who live all the way in the Tempe area. Anywho. I hope to see them again when Katherine performs at the McClintock play.

      Yay! Three day weekend!!! So excited. I get to finally organize myself. On my computer desk, it's so messy... Papers are stacked everywhere and I'm not sure where I should put them yet... And pens and pencils and markers are also sprawled across the desk... And books are everywhere, not evenly stacked to my likeings...  My room is pretty terrible also... I have papers stacked close to the wall so I won't accidently step on them to crinkle them. I have clean clothes stacked on my giant panda stuff... And my bed is unmade. And the desk with the keyboard on top of it has random junk on it... I want to redecorate my room. Repaint it, refurnish it.. Re-everything. I still have 5 Sailor Moon posters on my wall. They have been there since I was in 4th grade or so... That whole wall right there has never changed... My curtains are has food designs on them... like hotdogs and pretzels and fries and all this other junk. I want something lacy for my curtains... Just for kicks... Or should I choose something different?...... Summer Vacation-> I will get a job so I can get money to treat my parents out for lunch/dinner because I want to see how it's like, and then stuff to redesign my room. The only bad thing is that I'm not good at designing... So... Any ideas I may -steal-?

      Wow yeah. Okay. Lately I have felt more energized. Good, bad? I don't know. But I love it. Especially when playing DDR just awhile ago... I was hopping like a mad girl...  UP UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT RIGHT UP !!!! who knew my feet can tap and change directions so quickly... Yes... i can honestly say i have tripped and fell before.... but it just like a nice jumping workout.. except when you start to get a cramp on the side from too much jumping.. then.. that just sucks...   But anyway. Yes. Feeling good! Evolir, you might say... Express yourself! Stay alive! Don't get my wrong... I still love my quiet time in my room... But just being energetic is a nice change... Jump is my VERB. What is your   VERB  ?

It's cold... but not too cold that you won't get hot after  running around and giggling.   I spent some quality times with my cousins. Two of them were from LA and the other one is still the HK one. We couldn't decide what to do all day yesterday and today... We ended up just playing cards, Bonkers (this annoying boardgame), and Mah Jong.  Chinese is hard.

      I have too many aquaintances... and not many friends. Those who are friends, I question whether they still consider me a friend. I have been drifting from nearly everyone. Those who I used to speak to daily, we now only exchange 3 words or less. "How are you?" and just continue walking without waiting for the response. Or just like "Hello" or just a smile. It has gotten to the point where I'm wondering whether I should now consider myself "lonely" or just be thankful some people take time to just acknowledge my presence. I yearn for close companions. Ones where I can just freely speak my thoughts without any resent later for doing so and visa versa. As of now, there is no one (or was there ever) anyone who was close enough to me that didn't mind sharing their secrets or me sharing mine to them. When I thought I had a "best friend" we'd still keep things from eachother. I dare say that I will never want to reveal all of mine even if it's "nothing". I guess that is what prevents me from having those friendships. I guess that is what will  always  prevent me from having those friendships. But people change. And my thoughts change.   ... and life goes on. I feel for the monster in  Frankenstein .

      So, today was pretty all right. I woke up... cleaned my room... cleaned my mother's room... cleaned the family room... and then cleaned the living room... (clean meaning make everything straight and dust-free.) Then... I went to the movies with my cousin, Jen, and her bf. We saw Big Fish. I liked it. I liked it a lot. Except with they mentioned something about bunnies that wasn't very appropriate... Urg... never say anything bad about bunnies. Makes Connie sad.... :( But it was overall a good movie. Very unique. If you haven't seen it, check it out. Good stuff there.   Afterwards, my cousin, parents and I went to eat dinner at a Chinese restaurant.. I have had better...  :/ Then... soon after I arrived back at home, I cleaned my mice's cage. Stenchville. Bleh. Really sickening... but... ya gotta clean it.  Recently, I have been getting irritated easily. Irritated at people who don't even think. Irritated at those who think I don't know what taxes are. People who tell me not to volunteer and help pick up trash. I guess it's not really people... It's more like one person. She still tells me not to go for hard classes. I'm not sure if it's reverse psychology or not. I don't think it is... but it's working. Dangit. It's working. I try to hard. Sometimes I forget why. Someone help me.  I drift away from people because of relationships. Golly no, not mine. (HAHAHA, like I have any boy-girl relationships... funny.) but theirs. Oh no, "Viesha", I'm not implying yours. No, because I think we still communicate to a substantial degree. But others... others.... Go fig.   Hope y'all had a nice weekend. And do have a pleasant week.

      Another Saturday. Another day at the restaurant. The car ride there was interesting. I was reading Sylvia Plath's autobiography  The Bell Jar  (Good book so far, btw. I recommend it.) She was talking about her attempts in suicide. I flinched as I read her thoughts and her actions to kill herself... Literally flinched. I can stand seeing bloody things on tv (sometimes), but I flinch when just reading the book. The image is too clear.  At the restaurant, my mother comes up from behind and grabs my stomach fat as I'm sitting, plainly doing my homework. I get annoyed and tell her how uncomfortable that makes me feel. She laughs as if a kid and says it's to remind me that I need to lose weight. Thanks, mom. Then she walks away, still laughing. Five minutes later, she comes back with some greasy Chinese rice crispy stuff. I reject it, for I have already eaten a whole piece in the morning.... Thirty minutes later, she comes to me again with a big bowl of ice cream... I stare at the ice cream... and feel weak. I take the bowl and eat it all... Mother, how am I supposed to lose weight when you keep on feeding me all these unhealthy foods? About an hour after that, she makes me eat an orange.  Hi-point in my day... There's something like a lake behind the restaurant. Ducks like to congregate back there... and I like to join them. Today, the biggest duck, (he looks like a Roger) was quacking right outside the back door. I took a piece of bread, headed outside, and started feeding bits and pieces. Then I 'chased' it back to the lake/pond.  With still a half a slice of bread in my hand... I started feeding it to the other ducks. They aren't as big... They don't even compare in size. 'Roger' is like the ultimate duck... He kinda looks like a turkey with that redness wrinkly thing on its face. The other ducks are normal... and greedy.   On my way home... I listened to music... and only 'happy-thoughts' were scrolling through my mind. I smiled.  Back at home, I cleaned the mice's cage. The black one is still paralyzed from it's waist down. It doesn't have muscles to release its feces, so it has a large buldge of where its intestines are located. I don't know what to do. I look at the pure, white one... It looks so healthy... I wonder how the black one turned out to be like this......  Dream of bunnies.

      People are scary things... with scary minds. Rarely can you assume what linguers in their minds as they speak to you. They smile, but their smile can be deceiving... a facade for the hidden annoyance they have for you... the want to recklessly pulverize you to make you 'shut you up'. Don't worry, my mind is not clouded with hate... BUT A SPANISH STORY AND POSSIBLE ASSESSMENT PROMPT ANSWERS. Fudgen.

      Saturday. 9am-11pm. Went to work at family's place and then back home.  Sunday. Cleaned house and "hung out with parents" to Sam's Club and Price Club. 8am-6:30p.m. At home, watch t.v. with brother and ate dinner with family.  The more I read about your life, the more my life seems pointless.   It's not going so good. I messed up an interview. I have speaking-in-font-of-class-problems, still, even after my Speech Class last year. My computer won't turn on, so I'm stuck using my cousin's laptop computer. And something is wrong with the black mouse's hind legs; they won't move, so it's only crawling with its front legs. All this is no good. No good at all.

      What's wrong with me?...  ... And why are my social skills the worst yet?  There are goals in everyone's life, and mine seem to be failing. Oh... the horror...  ... Wishing to live in an illusionary world... where communication works.

      I just read several blogs about people getting drunk and vomiting.   I don't know what to say. Suddenly, it's like... vomiting is the cool thing to do. I never thought the world would have come to this. Bizzaro world.

      It's been more than a month since I posted something new. Why? Because nothing much has happened. So why am I posting now? Because I fell in love with Laina's hamster named Tiki Bushko. It's so... big and soft and fluffy and Ohhh, I just want to cuddle with it forever. All right. I'm done. Tiki is cu-yoot! :D  Finals Monday and Tuesday. I'm psyched! (haha...) Good luck, y'all.  Have fun over the summer. Stay safe. Stay clean. Stay cheery.

      Two nights ago, I had an interesting dream with so many errors I can't believe my mind didn't kick in and realize it was a dream.   The dream started out with Hongray driving me to Apollo HIgh School because I wanted to take part in an event to see who is the most superior person. Extreme mumbo jumbo. Hongman was here because he was supposed to drive me home after the Apollo event, but while he waited, he drove mom and dad to work since they had no car. I saw so many people there like Laina because she had summer school and Jenny, who had to take an hours long test. Well anyway, the event was like a race between Sasuke, Sakura (or something... maybe it was Sakura that later transformed into Laina), and myself. The three of us had to pass these tests. The first one was dodging these things and if you get hit, you lose. (Geez, the movie Dodgeball had an impact on my dream...) I think Sakura lost, but then that's when it was either her or Laina that followed me around and helped me. Well, Sasuke passed the dodging test, too, so we went to another startion where it tested our power and accuracy with this high tech bow and arrows device. I passed it, but then I couldn't see Sasuke anymore. I guess he just fled to the next event without waiting for me. The last test I remember required speed because I quickly rushed through all these apartment-like rooms and hotel restaurants while asking for a job (??), but I made out of it jobless and avoided these two bad guys dressed in black and got through all the gates. (One of the gates led to a dead end where there was a horse squished vertically.) At the end, there was this huge swamp, and I had to collect some item in the middle. There were creatures and people all over either getting the item also or preventing others from getting the item... I have no idea. Right after I made my way to the item and collected it, I lost my flip flops. The water level was a little above my neck and was really murky. In search for my flip flop, I managed to find another person's, who I assumed to be Laina's, so I just took that and then went to look for mine again. It felt so gross because I wasn't sure what I was stepping on and the water was really disgusting. After finding mine, Laina disappeared and Hongray came and went to the bathroom with me. The stalls were really short, short enough to see over them, almost like the bathrooms across from Mr.Frias' room at Thunderbird. Well, for some reason, while I was going to the bathroom, I started transforming into this hideous monster like Gaara and these guys started to stare. Using hand movements to Hongray, I directed him to punch them. When I got out of the bathroom, they were on the floor knocked out, and I was back to my regular human-self. Then when I exited the bathroom, we were all still at Apollo High School, and then I saw Sasuke-kun. I went up to him and said in a flirtatous way, "Did you pass?" And then he responded with his hott bad attitude voice and his irrisistable grin, "Of course I did. Did you'?" I was proud to say I passed also. Then I had to leave right after because Hongman pulled up in his car to drive all of us home (Laina, Hongray, me... maybe others.. No Sasuke). But we had to wait for Jenny to still finish her test, but I saw her coming a second later through a huge crowd and she told us to wait a moment. I saw her prance to where Rafi and Chris were standing and she hugged and kissed Chris. That lasted awhile as if she forgot about us waiting for her, so then I shouted to her (because she was like 10 yards away) that my brother was waiting, so she quickly came into the car... And that's when I woke up. ... Why did my brother have to come when I was talking to Sasuke?...  Here's a new contest, e-mail me your results if you decide to participate. List as many things that were wrong about this dream. Whoever lists the most will get a 2 minute and 28 seconds back massage from yours truly, me.  The poem contest has not yet ended.. because I need to collect a finished product that has to be handed to me.

      Like I typically do nowadays, I swim in my backyard by myself. You'd think it's boring, but it's nearly the most relaxing thing to do at my house besides sleeping or cozying onto the couch and watching some enjoyable television programs or movies. However, it's hard to get situated in the pool before the relaxing session begins. When I first enter my pool, I have to get all the bugs and leaves out because the first time I didn't do that, I found four bug bites later on that itched like crazy. I scratched them so much that soon grew 1 and a half to 2 inches in diameter. As of now, they are just darkened spots that are super duper smooth and plastic looking. Moving on, besides the trash that lingers in my pool, I have to deal with the bees and wasps that fly by and land in the water for a good sip. Six-legged things with wings definitely scares the bejesus out of me until I nearly drown, so that's not good. I smacked a bee with a net used to pick up trash, and it flew off never to bug me again. The wasp, however, escaped before I could smack it or drown it. It would occasionally fly by and hover next to me when I was netless, so I soon just got out of the pool after swimming a few laps and just floating. During the process of me swimming and floating, I manage to gather my thoughts and think of plans to do that would most likely blow over like all my other plans. It's nice to think about some things sometimes. Call me if you want to accompany me while I swim and we can team up and kill all those no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing bees and wasps.

      Here's something that everyone should know about me. I am gullible. I am so gullible that I'd believe you if you told me you fell in a well, drowned, and came back to life. Then you'd laugh at me. I would feel like an idiot. And then you'd feel bad for tricking me because I may have actually sympathized for you.   An update with the white mouse named MiMi: I'm glad to say it's still alive. I let it crawl all over my desk and all over me when I'm just chillin' in front of the computer. It doesn't tickle me anymore... Well... that's a lie, but I just try to ignore it. It's still a cutie.   I'm in the process of reading Huckleberry Finn. The book is so clever that it just makes me feel stupid. If I was Huck, I'd already be dead.  I have no plans everyday except for Tuesdays and Saturdays... just to let you know. I still need to see the third Harry Potter, but everyone has seen it already. 'sigh'.

      I have nothing better to do... and since you probably don't either I'm going to set up the first contest in my blog thingy. If you don't participate, I'll be REALLY FREAKING disappointed.   Okay here it goes: Write a poem of why bunnies are more superior than any other species out there.  Here are the rules: 1. The poem doesn't need to rhyme and can be free verse or any type of poem you wish (Limerick, ABC, haiku, and... other stuff).. However, it must have at least one poetic element. 2. You may not talk about how other species can be better than bunnies because that is just defeating the whole purpose of the prompt.  3. If you do break number 2, I will severely pulverize you with a fat stick. 4. If number 3 does not stop you... Then... I don't know. 5. No language.  The deadline is June 20th. If you need an extension just tell me.  The prize is I'll take you out for something off a 99 cent menu at whatever fast food place you want to go. :)  If no one does enter, not only will you get me all sad and gloomy for several weeks... but... I don't know. Just enter. :D  E-mail your entry to me at evolir@dapgraphics.com (ignore the e-mail you see under the bunny, I get too much junk mail in that and might delete your entry on accident), Instant Message me it. Snail mail me it (if there's decoration on a piece of paper you get 100+ points extra)... IM me to find out my address.  That is it. Good luck.  Oh yeah. And you may submit more than one entry. I'll be basing it to my likings, so if you know what I like, you're at an advantage. :D

      ... and so then I went to the Phoenix Zoo with my brother. I haven't been to the zoo in awhile so I was quite excited about this. I mean, c'mon, there's going to be animals that you don't see everyday. However, unfortunately, it wasn't worth it. The animals enjoy hiding away not visible to the public. None of the animals I wanted to see were there. :/ Plus, it felt like 110 degrees out there and walking for 1 and half hours trying to find something good to look at was too tiresome. I enjoyed the entrance most, where there's a bridge and there are all these turtles and huge fish in the water below. Those red eared sliders were big... According to my brother, those turtles were as big as the one we own. Psh, no way. Anyway, my brother enjoyed the gigantic daddy long legs that snuggled on the fences and and in the corner of many ceilings. Unbelieveably disgusting. Spider webs galor. I can honestly say I was frantic and grossed out. The only other good thing about the zoo were the mice or rats roaming around. Teehee... They were fluffy. Oh, and also the rabbits or jackrabbits or hares or whatever it was... But it wasn't chubby or anything, so that was disappointing. Well, off I go.

      *~*~*~*HAPPY BIRTHDAY JENNY*~*~*~*  Today was pretty great. I went to school registration which wasn't too bad, except that I had to handle my schedule and my cousins and forgot to get my bus pass schedule thing. Thanks to Jenny, Jenny's mom, Chris, DP, and T-dawg for helping me with the carryingness of the two stacks of books at one point in time. After registration, I played some Egyptian Rat Screw... or something like that... with Jenny and Chris, and I proved to have the worst luck ever. And congratulations to Jenny the Winner. Then it was stuffing my face time at Macayos. Not too bad... Not too bad at all... Back at Jen Jen's house, I looked at some pictures with Jen and then played some Madlibs until Daye-vihd's arrival with Toe-mahs (wow... we actually met, Thomas!!! ROFL...) I think T-dawg is the first person I met online that didn't go to the same school... or live in the same state... AHAHAHAH. Anyway.. Jen, Tee, DAP, and I ventured off to bowl. It was only my second time bowling... The first time was like in 6th grade... After getting 0's on my first try and an 8 on my second... I still managed to get lucky and hit some more later. It was fun. :D  urlLink    Haha... Man... 5 more to 100... I was so close... so close... lmao. All of our scores are just AMAZING. :D :D :D lol...

      Alas! The mystery of the 2nd shrimp is solved. When my brother was cleaning his fish tank, he found the shrimp in the filter... and surprisingly.. It's still alive!!!! It's still gross looking. The brown mouse has been returned ot PETsMart. It ruffed up my white mouse so now its fur is all messed up. That brown mouse was vicious. It took me several minutes to catch to put it in the carrier box because it scurried off too quickly. My last resort was grabbing it by the tail, and it bit me. My index finger bled a puddle of mud.  No wolf-cloud-eating-bunnies today, thank goodness.

      As I floated on my back in my swimming pool, I stared into the partly cloudy sky and noticed a bunny. Well... A half a bunny - its head, ears, and partial body. So I&nbsp;continued staring&nbsp;at it for awhile... Then looked away and examined another cloud. It had a shape of a frog that gradully transformed into a running pig. Har. Then I looked back at the bunny... and then saw another cloud drifting towards it... It was in a shape of a wolf.. and I just stared at it as it ate the bunny's head. Dangit you, Matthew; what are you doing summoning wolves to prey on my bunnies?!  MiMi the white mouse is injured near its ears... I think the brown mouse is attacking MiMi. I heard them squeakin' from their cage.. MiMi never usually squeaks. I quickly went to the cage to see what was happening, and they were fighting over the wheel. I think I'm going to return the brown mouse to PETsMART. I'm sorry, but MiMi isn't any happier with you like I hoped.

      ROFL. My brother got three large cockroach-lookin' wooden-textured shrimp a couple days ago. He spent the last few hours lookin' for two of the shrimp only to find one on the carpet a couple feet behind his fish tank. lmao. How did the shrimp climb out? We still don't know where the second missing shrimp is. My guess is that it somehow crawled under the sofa. lmao lmao lmao. lmao. Who knew shrimp can crawl on carpet.  I went swimming by my lonesome today for about twenty minutes. For some reason I was recollecting Sunday night in Jenny's pool with Laina and Jenny. We were just sitting there on the pool steps and I randomly "sung" Laina's "horror" tune not realizing it would scare her... Then Jenny sung out my horror tune... and Laina sung Jenny's horror tune. Bah hahahah... We all have a song that scares us.&nbsp; For some reason, that amused me.  What song scares you?

      Please call me before you come over to my house.&nbsp; According to my brother, no one is allowed to come over without calling first or mentioning to me that they are coming. He is mad at me now. Next time, I am supposed to say, "Come back when you call first," and then shut the door. Sorry. :/ Or my brother just doesn't like guys coming over spontaneously. He said if it was Laina it would be all right. He specifically said Laina's name. Wow. He knows Laina! :)   Okay he's talking to me right now. He said, "Don't EVER let guys come unannounced. If it's like Laina or girl, sure, whatever. But make sure you ask mom and me before they come. Okay? Okay, Connie?"  "Okay. Okay."   I said, "okay". So please don't do it or I'll have to result in shutting the door on you. Don't get me wrong... Visitors are fun to have when it's the appropriate time and not when you've just woken up. I just don't like dealing with my brother.  My mom didn't seem mad. She was&nbsp;kind of laughing. I guess it's because she knew this person.  &nbsp;

      Those who know me best probably figured that I'm bad at judging poems and I'd fall in love with the poem anyway as long as there is no violence against bunnies involved ... I guess that eliminates a couple entries sent in. Therefore, I guess I owe several of you guys something off the 99 cent menu of some fast food joint. Tell me when and where and I'll see if I can sneak off.&nbsp; O.o Gah hah... So tempting... sneaking off...

      Sometimes I wish that I wasn't a loyal daughter so I can run away from home... My mother makes me too mad and she doesn't even know. This anger is building up and I just want to escape, but I can't. Knowing that I can't enrages me to an even&nbsp;greater level.&nbsp; I don't even know what to do. "Confront your mother," some of you may think. My mom is stubbon and only thinks she is right. Seriously. ARGHHHH... What's worse is that no one can save me and say, "Let's hang out so you can cool off." Why? Because my mom would probably not let me go outside with you anyways, especially if you're a guy because she thinks you'll probably attack me even if I've known you more than a couple years. The only people she lets me go outside with and has somewhat no paranoia are three people... and they usually have plans with their boyfriends anyway. Dangit, someone hit me with a cement block so I stop contemplating about this. Where's a bunny when you need one...?

May I have a sip of yours? (cup of Sake) Kenshin: All right. Kaoru: I-I can't believe it. They used the same cup. Megumi: This is tasty. ::high pitched laugh:: Kaoru: ::teary eyed:: Dirty!

      Let's all take a deep breath... 1...2...3...3...2...1... All right, so my day was a complete bore. Well, sort of. I woke up at 9ish... and went to my parent's restaurant at 10a.m.ish... I was there till 9:30p.m.ish. And then went all the way to my aunt's place and arrived there at 10ish. Finally left at 10:50ish... And finally home at 11ish.  Work was typical. No bums or scary people today, thank goodness. Last time I was at work... Oh boy, freaky uncleansed guy who couldn't remember what a "drink" was called. On my spare time, I continued watching some episodes of Kenshin. Haha, it's awesome. Better than Naruto? Neh... all I can say is that it's really good and gave me a few laugh out louds. I also took a risk today... I drew a picture of Sasuke. I'm relieved that he doesn't look deformed. I'm not artistic, so it's not that great, but at least he doesn't look mutated... No me gusta my aunt's place. That was some excruciating 50 minutes of boredom. No kid. I just sat there doing nothing because I can't speak fluent Chinese so I can't communicate with them. My uncle talks too much about himself and my family and their family always touch upon the same topics over and over again. Basically, no one has anything to talk about, but everyone wants to be polite so they pull some safe topic to re-touch upon.  Now I'm back on my computer where I relieve all my... badness... to be content like a little girl with a big fluffy bunny. Gahaha. Welp, Bunny out.

      When she starts something she likes, she can't stop. I just spent my last three hours playing Gunbound. Oh geez, killing is so much fun. Err.. I mean.. blowing up bots. :) WweeeEEEeeEeee... Too bad I have bad luck and usually end up on the losing team. I take full responsibilty. I accidently killed my own teammate today. Ahahah... Oopths. Also, this fettish over Uchiha Sasuke is killing me. Punch me. Oh, punch me now. Or better yet, throw a brick at me to try to knock some sense into me. I downloaded some video clips where it shows him fighting and whoopin' his enemies, and it was amazing. If you want to drool, contact me and I will let you download the clips off me. But remember, he's mine. Kah-peesh?

      Click to enlarge the image and read what's inside the bubbles. Read up to down and right to left.  Spoiler alert, if you ever decide to check out Naruto.     urlLink     Sasuke has just taken many needles for Naruto to save Naruto's life.   urlLink     Apparently, they hate each other, but Sasuke's body moved automatically to save Naruto.   urlLink     Fortunately, the needles did not hit any critical points. (Phew. Thank goodness. I almost cried.) When he wakes up... all he says is "Sakura... you're heavy." (Sakura was on him crying... if you didn't get that...)  Sasuke is too cool.

       urlLink    When Itachi and Sasuke were younger... before Itachi decided to kill the whole Uchiha clan but leave Sasuke alive to be an avenger...  "I have lived only to kill you..."  urlLink    Top is Sasuke. Bottom is Itachi. Just look at them. Their expressions. It's... amazing.

        urlLink    Kakashi just used an illusionary technique against Sakura, which made her see Sasuke all beaten up and bloody. She fainted, and when she woke up and walked around, she saw Sasuke in the ground. (Kakashi put him there.) So, she just saw his head and thought it was severed, so she fainted again. When she woke up and found out Sasuke was all right, she hugged him in relief. I love how Sasuke exclaimed, "Stop!! Don't hug me!!!" Gave me quite a chuckle.

      Yesterday was, for the lack of better way of putting it, neat. It was really great spending time with my old buds again all at the same time. The last time it was just the four of us was like... years ago. Too bad one of us had to go soon after because of a screech and burning incident that was sorta freaky at first, but now I laugh at it... What an experience. Back at my place, we just chilled like the old times with nothing to do but were still content anyways, for me at least. Good times. Good times.  I started running again  yesterday, which means I'm not getting enough sleep. Sleeping late and waking up early, puh, makes me cranky. Luckily, it's for a short period of time. Usually blows off while I'm running.  My brother used his car to measure how much we run. He says approxamately three times around my neighborhood is a mile. I run four. Gah ha, I didn't even know that was possible for an old man like me.

      Finally... going away for summer vacation. Unfortunately... the day I come back is Sunday night... and Monday morning is the first day of school. Where did the summer go?...  Well, don't miss me when I'm gone. :p
