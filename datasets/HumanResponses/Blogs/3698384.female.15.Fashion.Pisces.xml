      Youth conference was so totally awesome. I wish that I could go back.  It was way super fun, and spiritual, and major bonding time. Chase did a bunch of push ups, Chris hates awkward silences and declares that he  is a boy (where in the world did he get that idea? jk) everytime there  is one, Chad can do an amazing impersonation of Arnold Schwartzanegger, or however you spell it. I bawled like a baby, right along side with Jenny of course. And I feel so close to everyone in the ward that  went! And, I have a new b/f...Brant Graves. He's such a sweetie. Give him  a round of applause. Jk. But seriously, he's the sweetest guy I know. So, please post something on anything on my site so I can feel special or something....ahem. Well, luv ya! Kisses, Camille

      Kay, so this has to do with my random question on my profile. When I was 5 years old, me and my best friend, Amanda, went and  scraped these dead dried up worms off of the cement and put the pieces in a plastic baggie full of water, in hopes of reconstituting them, and bringing them back to life, and then letting them loose so that  the mommy worms would be able to go back to their baby worms.  Sadly, the dried up worms never came back to life.  Shed a tear for the poor mommy-less baby worms.  Ya, that's right. Have a tissue and comment on this post kay! Kisses, Camille

      MALL!! It has got to be one of the greatest places on the entire face of this planet! It's fantastic there! So, Sierra's dad was home today...and he took us to that special place, the mall I mean, and we went shopping for a bit, but didn't buy anything on account of the fact that we're broke, oh wait, we  shared a 2 entree thing at Panda Express. But that's all we bought. So, then we went and looked at really cute clothes and got some ideas for what to buy for school. Hooray, we're gonna be in high  school! I'm so excited!! And I fell in love with the happy bunny.  It's one great animal! Then we ran into my fantastic friend, Calli Priest, and her friend  Myra. And so we all went to go see the 5:05 show of The Stepford  Wives. And that was a creepy movie. Oh well, I liked it, and it was fun hanging out with a lot of my friends!! And then after the movie Calli and Myra left, and Sierra and I went to Victoria Secret Body. Great store! And we found this fantastic,  great beyond great, heavenly lipgloss and we want to go back and  buy it when we get some money. And, gift ideas for me, I love love love love love these two scents: Endless Love and Pink. Both from  that excellent, highly recommended store. And so we decked  ourselves out at their make up tester desk thing and this lady  just kept putting more and more on us. It was so funny. But we  looked pretty spiffy. And then these guys were waving at us and a bunch of stuff after we left that great store. And it was  funny. Very very funny. But these guys were pretty cute, so I guess that it was alright. I mean, they weren't any Orlando Blooms or anything, but they were pretty cute.  And then Sierra's mom came and took us home. And we taught Aaron how to sign "Camille" in sign language, and he picked it up pretty fast, and what's cool is that Aaron recognizes me now, and he  doesn't cry anymore like he used to. He laughs and gives me a kiss. Really sweet, isn't it? Well, tomorrow Sierra is coming over here at like seven in the morning and we are going swimming and then we are going to Brittain's swim meet, so that should me a bit of fun. Well, signing off now. Comment on this for me and make me feel special! Kisses, xoxo, Camille

      So, Jordan Bird got me on this. Y'all can go beat him up after you  read all of my posts!  I figured that it would be good for everyone if I got one of these  spiffy things. Now I can let everyone in the whole wide world with  internet access know all about my weirded out life. So, y'all who are reading this probably know all about me anywayz, so  I'll just skip that introduction with the what I look like, and all about my life, and save all that stuff for maybe later. I mean, why waste it all on one blog? So, keep on going on this whole site, and I hope you likey! Kisses! Camille

       So, I said that I'd tell you how my ballet would be in my complete profile thing.&nbsp; I decided that I needed to change my random question every once in a while.   I don't have very much time, but this is how the ballet would be:   There would be "children" dancing around "water droplets" which would also be dancers, and it would have really cool costumes, and it would be one of those modern ballet pieces, the fun ones that people are loving right now, not the traditional ballet pieces that everyone thinks of when they think "ballet".    It's rather sad, the people who think like that are so uncultured, it should be a sin if someone never goes to see a ballet.&nbsp; That's like not ever eating pizza or french fries, but much more important.&nbsp; Seeing ballets can actually help you be a better person, in my opinion.&nbsp; Oh, and hint for the guys, the girls that are worth anything love seeing ballets, so if you wanna win her, take her to one (I mean, look at the MSN butterfly argument commercial).&nbsp; I would absolutly adore the guy if he took me to a ballet, it usually means that they are good guys, and that they will sit through something that they don't necessarily like, if it means that you'll be happy.&nbsp; Or, it will mean that they will take a chance and try something new.&nbsp; I love guys that will so see a ballet.&nbsp; They're usually awesome, well, at least at the time....there was one guy who isn't really...   So, g2g,   Kisses,   Camille

         So, dancing has taken over my life for the past two weeks, you all know that.&nbsp; So, yesterday I hurt my shoulder like 3 times.&nbsp; It sucked.&nbsp; And then I went to rehearsal, and hurt it again a few more times.&nbsp; So, each time that I hurt my shoulder again, it gets a little bit worse, right?&nbsp; Well, ya, it does.&nbsp; And then Dane and I decided that we needed to practice that dumb cartwheel off of his shoulder while I was wearing my huge dress that is really heavy and soooooo dangerous to dance in.&nbsp; Then, because pretty much everyone had left already, he gave me a ride home.&nbsp; Goodness, Dane is the most random person, it's so funny.&nbsp; We were listening to Christmas music in the car.&nbsp; It was sorta weird.    And then today I went back to dance, but I sat out for half of the day because my shoulder was killing me and I wanted to be partially alive for rehearsal today, you know?&nbsp; So, then I came home and iced my shoulder and then I started a report for health on euthanasia and assisted suicides.&nbsp; It was getting too heavy and making me want to cry, so I stopped for a while, but I think that after this I am gonna go take a shower and do my hair in some french braids and put it in a bun at the end, and then I think that maybe I'll put a bow around it.&nbsp; That would be festive.&nbsp; Then I get to go to dance and become all sweaty again.&nbsp; Hooray.    You know what? In 2 weeks, I've lost a total of 7 pounds, just from dancing, and I've been eating like a horse the entire time!&nbsp; If I ate healthy I'd like loose a pound a day, no exaggeration!!&nbsp; If any of you wanna loose weight, then come with me for a while, and you will, trust me.&nbsp; Holy crap, I think that if I didn't dance, I'd be freaking obese!!&nbsp; Goodness, I'd be a freakin whale!!    Well, since nobody cares about me enough to really talk to me or read this or anything, I'm gonna go get ready to go meet my REAL friends at dance.&nbsp; Ahhh, the nice thing about my ballet buddies is that they understand my dancing tramas, they never try to belittle me, they always try to build me up, and they are all the cutest, best people I know!!&nbsp; I'm so excited to go see them and not have to deal with my backstabbing, ostracizing, rude, annoying friends here in Lehi, you know who you are...you're not Sierra or Jordan or Brant or Garrett or Kim (who is also one of my wonderful ballet buddies).     You're probably named Jenny or Chase or sometimes Brittain.     Ha ha ha, you can't read it!      Camille

      Ha ha ha. I can't believe that I haven't updated this blog regularly! I've been too busy putting input on Jordan's website which is by the way...actually, I can't remember right now, and I'm too lazy to go find it.  So, today I talked to Sierra on the phone, and she is having dramas and I'm having dramas, so we both told each other our dramas, and then we started making these lists about everyone, like all of our friends, like the formally known as the 9, and ballet buddies, and all that jazz, then Sierra's e-mail died on her!! How sad huh! So, her new address is  urlLink sahara_loo@yahoo.com , so make a note of it!!  Kay, so, I'm doing a ballet performance this weekend. I am so excited, but guess what? I almost broke a poor guy's neck with this monsterous 10 lbs dress!! I have to do a shoulder sit into a cartwheel off of Dane's (my partner) shoulder, and my dress got caught on his neck and pulled him down, and he was down for a long time and then he finally got back up and couldn't move his neck, so I went down to Hogi Yogi on our break and got a bag of ice and a milkshake (they're new there, and they are soooooo good!!!!) with oreos and the hershey's shot on the top. I felt so horrible about Dane though, I still do. He didn't show up at practice yesterday, but he then called me later that night and we talked for like 2 hours, and he told me that he was at his grandpa's 90th b-day party. He said that it was uber boring.  So, I started reading this book, "The 7 Habits for Highly Effective Teens" by, Sean Covey, and I have a new fave quote, it's....     "We first make our habits and then our habits make us"  --English Poet.  Isn't that deep? Well, there are a lot more of them, I like them because the more you think about them, the more them mean!! I highly recommend the book!  Well, I have to go get ready for a fireside, so l8er!  *muah*!  Camille  &nbsp;
