      My dad was home today so he took us out to do some stuff.   I drove to the Wellington mall (I did a very good job) and we went to American Eagle. I need some shoes for back to school, so i got these white ones for thirty dollars and they are pretty cool. We ate a Chic - Fil - A. Then we went to see Spiderman 2. This is my third time, and it was still a GREAT movie. Probably my last time seeing it until it comes out on DVD but thats cool. Then we went to the Boynton Beach Mall and i picked up mine and Ryans warped tour tickets. Its official, im going and there are no conflicts about it. Brittney finally convinced her parents to let us stay almost the whole time which is GREAT! Yeah, that was basically it, except i got grounded from electronics (Im sneaking on now) So yeah... tommorow im getting a haircut. Im gonna cut it spiky again. Im worried about disappointing my mom but she says she wont be. I know better than to believe her, but if i want to continue my new quote of life "You can only go buy what you are told." And shes telling me she doesnt care... so, lyrics, and goodnight.   Story of the Year  Anthem of our Dying Day   The stars will cryThe blackest tears tonightAnd this is the moment that I live forI can smell the ocean airAnd here I amPouring my heart onto these rooftopsJust a ghost to the worldThat's exactlyExactly what I needFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayFor a second I wish the tideWould swallow every inch of this cityAs you gasp for air tonightI'd scream this song right in your faceIf you were hearI swear I wont miss a beatCause I neverNever have beforeFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayOf our dying dayOf our dying dayOf our dying!!!For a second I wish the tideWould swallow every inch of this cityAnd you gasp for air tonight!!From up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayOur dying dayOf our dying!!!

      Story of the Year - In the Shadows    Woken up to a phone call and a bang.     Ryan can go to Warped Tour. Woo. Im glad cuz i wanted to go with a guy because im already surrounded by 800 girls that im going with. (More like 5 or 6) So thats good. And as we speak his mom is on the phone with my mom cuz "They have to talk" Whatever...     Five minutes after waking up, im still in bed, and my dad is home, and he starts banging on some door. I sit up and hes calling into the bathroom to my brother and banging on the door. 15 seconds later, my brother hasnt answered, and the shower hasnt turned off. Then, my dad is like "Oh God, something happened to him." He turns and rams his shoulder into the door, breaking the side of the door, and the handle. Then my brother screams "What" and opens the door. Well, my dad went off, and you can see why. Now we have to fix the door, and my brother should have been beaten ( I would have if i was his father), but he kinda got off.     That was the most exciting moment of my day.     We are very close to getting brittneys parents to letting us stay almost the whole day at Warped. Im so excited. Getting tickets tommorow.  Nothing has happened today.    Ive decided i want to make a music video with Ryan. I was in the shower listening to Switchfoot, and i realized ive always wanted to make a video of me singing or something in the shower. But id be wearing a bathing suit,and the camera would be showing me from the waist up to give the impression that... yeah. Well, i dont know waht song im gonna pick, but if i actually get serious about it, then ill do it.     um, lyrics....    The Vines  Ride    ahhh      that's the start the middle and the end   aren't you glad the universe pretends    if I don't get this message home   once again I'm gonna head alone      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home      ride with me    ride with me    ride with me   oh yea      thought alot ignored the right to be    lie me down because we like to see    the colors through your loaded mind    fuck the world and let me raid out time      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   oohh      im not waiting alone   im not waiting alone..      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home     I was gonna choose another song, but its been too long taht i havent posted this song. Its kinda old, but its great to listen too.

      Hey,   Sorry i didnt update yesturday. I was spending the night at Alex's, which i will now summarize for you.   Yesterday:  Ryan picked me up and we headed towards the train station to catch the 11.45 train. We get there, and right after we purchase our tickets, bam, train is 45-60 minuts delayed. So we call Alex (who is picking us up) and he offers to come pick us up. THat surprisingly went fast, and an hour or so later, we were in Alex's house. I have never been there before, but it was gorgeos. It doesnt look big from the outside, but its so deep, it seemed like it went on forever. Soon Kelsey showed up, then Brittney, and finally Katie Sadow. We just sat in Alex's very nice room and chatted until we realized it was 1:15, and we wanted to see Spiderman at 1:20. So, we run downstairs and hurridly get Mrs. Pouille to drive us 30 seconds to the Abacoa movie theatre. We make it just in time to get free popcorn, and get into the theatre while the previews are still showing. Again, i saw it and it was great again. Of course, they all loved it. Then we walked home which took like 20 minutes, and we decided to snack and play CRANIUM. That was interesting... First time ever, and brittney and i came in last, but thats ok. That took like 2 hours. Then the men took over and made hamburgers and hot dogs, which wernt that bad, but had to be cooked twice because Alex cant barbeque. Lol. Then we just went in the pool and chatted until one by one all the girls left. I liked that group alot, we had a LOT of chemistry and there was never a dull moment. We all got a long really well which was really good, and we all decided that Alex's house is now THE place to crash. Weekends will actually be fun now. Take the bus to jupiter with alex, get some people together, and spend the night. Its gonna be a great year.... Anyways, ryan, alex, and i played X box for like 1 1/2 hours, then we decided to go to bed. Ryan and I ended up sleeping on the same bed. (Dont worry, as far apart as possible, and this is a King size bed. ) This is all in Alex's guest suite. Alex slept on the floor on some couch pillows. So i didnt wnat to sleep under the same comforter as ryan, so alex and i went to find a blanket but all we could find is some towel thing. That didnt work and it was freezing, so i ditched that afer about an hour, and Ryan was still awake, which i didnt nkow. So i get under the covers, im comfortable enough with myself that i can do that... and then next thing i know, i wake up to Ryan pushing my arm off of him because i roll in my sleep and at some point i rolled over nad my arm was in his face. So that was interesting... we had a good breakfast this morning, and then we got driven to the gardens mall, and met Brittney. We jsut hung out. I bought the Story of the Year Cd. which is great. My mom met up with us and we got driven home. Pretty boring afternoon. Tried to buy warped tickets, but i have to wait for brittney to buy hers first. And now im typing and listening to Story of the Year, The Vines, and Sugarcult. WEll, heres the lyrics. Goodnight.   Story of the Year  Sidewalks   the bridge is all crumbled  the water soaks into rocks  that fell at the bottom of the road  (at the end of town)  The town we lived in  The memories shaken apart  from the weeds that grow  over the   sidewalks  running away from the streets we knew  sidewalks  like the time we thought was made for you   out on the front porch  watching the cars as they go by  (eighteen blue, twenty-one gray)  looking ahead  for the first time that we could drive  out on our own  to speed away  from the....   [Chorus]   all of the days have passed us by.  all of the sun is gone away.     I love that song... its really cool but im not gonna analyze it right now. Something about change and losing the past... Well, goodnight everybody.   Tommorows forcast : nothing special

      Well everybody, i woke up to some very surprising news.     Katie told me that Ricky Williams is to retire. Wow. I was shocked. My close friends know that Ricky was like one of my biggest role models, and now hes gone. What a great way to go. 27. In perfect shape. Ready to break out. Loved by Miami. Invested 3 first round draft picks into him. Molded an entire team around him. Gone. Like that. Gone to Asia to smoke marajuana. Bye Bye Ricky. that part of my life is over... GO DOLPHINS!!!    So i did chores today. Made some more money. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. NOTHING HAPPENED TODAY!!!!! YEAH!!!!!!     Alright, im bored... Um, ALRIGHT NEW THING!!! In like 7th grade, i got this book from my grandpa titled "How to Be a Gentleman" Its pretty cool. Im going to post one quote from it on every post. Kind of as a joke. But w/e.    "A gentleman always tucks his undershirt into his underwear."    17 DAYS TILL SCHOOL STARTS    Alrigt, i love this song. Here it is. If I feel like posting later, I will.     I wonder to round feed this bitterness   It's worth it, seen any of this   Love and forgiveness   Our time is and true   I know you're full of fear   I hope I'm never like you   I wander too and feel this hate   It's empty and doesn't change a thing   Love will endure when it comes to the end   I see you're insecure   I know there's hope for you      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man      I wonder to round feed hostility   It's pointless to dwell on my anger   Love is the answer innate as it seems   I know you're full of hate   I hope I'm never the same   I wonder too and fear this pain   Imagine the magnitude of   Love that is giving the chance to prevail   I see you're full of tears   And I can sense you're here      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man      Take what you want to   Now that you got the chance to   Take it, why don't you?   Now that you got the chance to [x2]      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man        I really love this song, and you could hear me comenting on it at a later time.

      Switchfoot...    Omg, I havent posted in 2 or 3 days and i dont know what to say...    Ive just been tired. The bedtime for last night and the night befor have been around 9:30 - 10. Hey, Im tired, and i finally gave in. Im actually sneaking onto the computer now, im somehow grounded from it... wasting electricity or something. Another bogus rule that will no longer exist in a week... Anyways, highlights from the past days.    Spiderman 2 - Best movie of all time. I feel like i was entranced in it. I was part of the movie. Everytime he shook, i shook, everytime he cried, i felt like crying (even though i didnt, i think Katie did though...) For the first time since i was six, i came out of a superhero movie actually wanting to be the Superhero... lol. So I got all emotional over that, my friends say it will ware down, but i plan on seeing it two more times within the next week.     Naples - I drove to west florida today, Naples, relatives. Its so hot there, the air is weird. I guess im just an east coast kind of guy...    Warped tour - Its in a week, and i cant wait. We still have to finalize transportation issues, and figure out whether to use ticketmaster, or buy at the gate... Anyways, Daniel went today, and called randomly letting us listen to the bands, it was cool, except i could only make out the end... Sugarcult, oh they are great...     Well, i think this will be one of hte very eventful weeks of the summer. Itll be cool.  Well, im tired, ill talk later.    Ok... lyrics, lyrics... alright, Im in a D.C. mood...    Dashboard Confessional  Ghost of a Good Thing     I guess it's luck, but it's the same    Hard luck, you've been trying to tame    Maybe it's love, but it's like you said,    "Love is like a role that we play."       But, I believe in you so much    I could die for the words that you say    But, I believe in you so much    I could die from the words that you say       But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing    Haunting yourself as the real thing    It's getting away from you again    While you're chasin' ghosts       I guess it's luck, but it's the same   Hard luck, you've been trying to tame    Maybe it's love, but it's like you said,    "Love is like a role that we play."       But, I believe in you so much    I could die for the words that you say    But, I believe in you so much    I could die from the words that you say       But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing    Haunting yourself as the real thing    It's getting away from you again    While you're chasin' ghosts       Just bend the pieces til they fit    Like they were made for it    But, they weren't meant for this    No, they weren't meant for this       Just bend the pieces til they fit    Like they were made for it    But, they weren't meant for this       Chasin' the ghost of a good thing    Haunting yourself as the real thing   It's getting away, away, away, away from you again      Chasin' the ghost of a good thing   Haunting yourself as the real thing   It's getting away from you again   While you're chasin' ghosts    The rhythym of this song is very relaxing.  The whole CD is amazing, but this is definatly one of their more EMO songs. Well, im tired, and it took a while to find those lyrics so, Good night.

      The Juliana Theory    I love this band for some reason... and i get their songs stuck in my head a lot, thats one of the reasons i made that my title... that song was stuck in my head.    Waking up at noon is weird sometimes because you look outside, you see the sun halfway up, but then you think, "There is no way it is noon." And then you look at your cell phone, and it is, and the day is wasted. Also what is weird it when it is four oclock, it is late in the afternoon, but you've only been awake for four hours. Yeah.    So, I woke up at noon. Then i took a shower. Then i played basketball.  I watched tv, and reallly  did nothing the whole day.  HAd a good dinner though, Grilled Cheese with Tomatoe. YEAH!!! Then i played more basketball, and ive basically been on the phone and watching tv/computer the rest of today.    I had a big conflict with the Warped Tour today, but it looks like its a definate that im going.  Another conflict is about this whole Dreyfoos starting at 8:00 thing... check out Alex Pouilles (sp?) blog... he explains it well...   urlLink www.dreyfoos.blogspot.com    Yeah, so if it starts a half hour earlier, that means i have to wake up earlier, and have to be in Kileys (Italion Class) class that much earlier.  But, i do get out of school htat much earlier... ehhh, i dont know. Who cares? as long as im there....    So, lyrics time...  You know what, i think im going to use the song that i used in my title today cuz thats like the only song i listened to today so yeah...    The Juliana Theory  Bring It Low    So tell me is it hard to see   The possibilities   That I am not the person that I seem      I'll show you anything inside,   Will you open up your mind?   Cause I'm more like you than   You may ever know      We'll play it again   We're gonna let it go   Nobody's waiting this way   We're gonna lose it all      So baby was a shooting star   She crawled into my heart   But time revealed that she was fading out      Now choke everything you feel   And as it all conceals   and never heals   You always feel alone   We always feel alone      We'll play it again   We're gonna let it go   Nobody's waiting this way   We're gonna lose it all      You'll play it again   You're gonna let it go   You never waited this way   No, you want it all      Noone lives [x6]   We're coming again      We'll play it again   We're gonna let it go   Nobody's waiting this way   We're gonna lose it all      I'm on my way   I gotta go   I'm on my way   And I want it now

       That was a quote by Shaquille O'Neal, and even though I dont relate to it whatsover, i still think it was a very smartly said.    Shaq in Black. Today Shaq became an official member of the miami heat, i was excited. I watched two hours of coverage on his press conference, and it was really enjoyable. He has one of the biggest personalitys of anyone i've ever seen.     Surprisingly, I wasnt that bored today even with brittney not talking to me until 9:00 at night.  So i guess i dont need her. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.     So i went to Katies later on... Her little minions were over again... surprise. Her entire family could be wiped out in a horrible car accident, and they would still show up looking for free entimans pre-packaged coffee cakes. (Not that i dont eat uncontrolably from that house, but I am part of that family...)     So me, Katie and Kimmy, Katies sister went to work out at the YMCA. They got membership recently, and so we went. So cute, lifting 10 pounds... silly woman... think they can get muscles... SO CUTE... They know the gym is a place of work for the man, if they spend time at the gym, thats one less hour in the kitchen mopping, WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE! Is he kidding, is he not? Who knows?    Then Karen, Katies mom brought us for ice cream. We ate dinner. Watched sportscenter, then i went out and played Basketball with my brothers. Pretty eventful day. I liked it. Nothing on tv, but im in a pretty good mood, baring the Marlins pull one out tonight... Ok, well goodnight... Oh, here's part two of the songs that are important to a  lot of people in the world... its a long one folks.    Something Corporate   Konstantine     I can't imagine all the people that you know And the places that you go When the lights are turned down low And I don't understand all the things you've seen But I'm slipping in between You and your big dreams It's always you In my big dreams  And you tell me that it's over Wake up lying in a patch Of four leaf clovers And you're restless And I'm naked You gotta get out You can't stand to see me shakin No... Would you let me go? I didn't think so..  And you don't wanna be here in the future So you say the present's just a pleasent Interruption to the past And you don't wanna look much closer Cause you're afraid to find out all this hope You had sent into the sky By now had..crashed And it did...Because of me..  And then you bring me home Afraid to find out that you're alone And I'm sleeping in your living room We don't have much room..to live  I had these dreams In them I learned to play guitar Maybe cross the country Become a rock star And there was hope in me that I could take you there But damnit you're so young Well I don't think I care  And if I hurt you then I'm sorry Please don't think that this was easy  And then you bring me home Cause we both know what it's like to be alone And I'm dreaming in your living room We don't have much room To live  And Konstantine is walking down the stairs Doesn't she look good standing in her underwear And I was thinkin..what I was thinkin We've been drinking And it doesn't get me anywhere  My Konstantine came walking down the stairs And all that I could do was touch her long, blonde hair And I've been thinking It hurts me thinking That these nights when we were drinking No they never got us anywhere  No..  This is because I can spell konfusion with a k And I can like it It's to dying in another's arms And why I had to try it It's to Jimmy Eat World And those nights in my car When the first star you see may not be a star I'm not your star Isn't that what you said What you thought this song meant  And if this is what it takes Just to laugh with my mistakes And live with what I did to you All the hell I put you through I always catch the clock It's 11:11 And now you wanna talk It's not hard to dream You'll always be my Konstantine  My Konstantine  They'll never hurt you like I do No..They'll never hurt you like I do  No, No..No No No No No No..  This is to a girl Who got into my head With all the pretty things she did And you know You keep me up in bed  This is to a girl Who got into my head With all these fucked up things I did Hey..maybe..baby You could keep me up in bed  My Konstantine  You spin around me like a dream We played out on this movie screen And I said..  Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? I miss you  And then you'd bring me home And we go to sleep But this time not alone..no no And you'll kiss me in your living room I know..I know you'll miss me in your living room Cause these nights I think maybe that I'll miss you in my living room  We don't have much room I said does anybody need that room? Because we all need a little more room To live..  My Konstantine    That is a very long song ladies and gentleman. I've only listened to the whole thing twice, and i barely understand teh meaninng of it... im trying though. Hopefully you actually read it.

We might be having some problems transportation problems... hopefuly not, and i will be rocking out on the thirty-first.    you know what, i have NO TIME to post tonight... or im too lazy... yeah... well, today i, um, did nothing. My great grandma came over. Woo. yeah, well goodnight.      Yellowcard  Avondale     If you’re gonna rip my heart out,  could you use a knife that’s dull and rust in color.  (Once I die) there will be no way that you can cover,  that scar.  It’s hard. I know.  And if I get a little blood on you,  finally the world will know you’re guilty,  (know you're wrong)  of taking everything you’ve gotten from me  no heart, its hard. I know.  Mighty king of avondale  I just can't let this go.  Real life ain't no fairy tale  I just thought you should know.  When you’re finished with the surgery  I really hope that you will turn to me  and tell me all about the fun you had  when you were cutting up, you were cutting up.  Mighty king of avondale I just can't let this go.  Real life ain't no fairy tale I just thought you should know.  Living like a fairy tale the  mighty king of avondale it all went to his head, this royalty.  I stuck a knife into his back. Inventiveness is what I lack.  He’s always hanging up on loyalty.  Mighty king of avondale  I just can't let this go   real life ain't no fairy tale I jut thought you should know.    I love that song, my best friends dont. OH WELL> A lot of people say this is a touching song to them. Its also one of their rare songs that not a lot of people have heard of. Tommorow ill post another song like that... you'll see... you'll see...

      Ah... waking up was nice today...    The night before i built a fort on katies couches (which are really comfortable) and I fell asleep in it. It was really nice and relaxing. I fell asleep to SNL, rerun... Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey were the hosts...    So last night was cool as my mom had to babysit the Ross's, and my brothers and i got to spend the night over there. That was the first time in 5 or 6 years i have ever slept over there.     So i woke up and helped clean up the house, we wrecked it. Then i went and got some waffles, and as usual, Katie went and hung out with her kindergarden friends and went to her 12 year old boyfriends birthday party. Shes 14... I have my feelings on that whole situation, but i ahve a feeling that most people know about it...    So i just hung out and earned some more money doing chores. Then, bang, corruption in the Seifter houshold.    "MOM, CHRIS SCRATCHED UP BOTH CARS" Andrew screamed.    My little brother Chris, while cleaning hte cars as he normally does, made a big mistake. He took a MOP to the car and mopped the outside of the car... leaving scratches up to as long as my arm. Ohhhh my parents were not too happy. Somehow he got off the hook from his month long punishments, i dont know how, and my house had broken into civil war.    Mom Vs. Andrew - Mad at him because he rats on his siblings too much  Parents Vs. Chris - Scratched up their car  Mom Vs. Dad - Dad thinks mom defends children too much, doesnt discipline us enough.  Me Vs. Family - Im trying to listen to Switchfoot and all I hear is your screaming.    So now im in charge of the cars! Thats ten extra bucks a week.  Cool with me... thats a 70 + dollar weekend.    So that was interesting. My face is getting better... my scrapes. I went driving to wal-mart today. It rained and i was nervous. But im a good driver so yeah... I also read like 35 pages of guns germs and steel today. I might read more.     So im watching the ESPYS right now, and that was my day.... Goodnight...

       Hey everyone,   This post is primarily for those that go to Dreyfoos.    &nbsp;  I got my schedule early this summer by going into building 2, and finding the secretary lady that sits in that little room the the left of you right when you walk in.     &nbsp;  I asked her if I was switched to TV Pro from film cuz i was curious. She told me, and i was (thank god, I changed my mind.) Then she decided to give it to me. Anyone out there who is curious to see it, here it is.    &nbsp;  1. Italion II - Kiley   2. AP World History - West   3. TV Production - N/A   4. English II Honors - Imse   5. Algebra II - N/A   6. Debate IV - Weber   7. Chemistry I Honors - N/A    &nbsp;  This is a pretty random post... but Alex was wondering so..    &nbsp;  Characters   Alex - Good friend that goes to Dreyfoos.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Oh, for those of you looking for one of my daily posts... dont worry, nothing good happened, except i mowed the lawn, and im spending the night at Katies because my mom has to babysit her sisters... cya. Ill post some lyrics if you want though...    &nbsp;  Maroon 5   She Will Be Loved    &nbsp;  Beauty queen of only eighteen   She had some trouble with herself   He was always there to help her   She always belonged to someone else   I drove for miles and miles   And wound up at your door   I've had you so many times but somehow   I want more   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautiful   I know I tend to get so insecure   It doesn't matter anymore   It's not always rainbows and butterflies   It's compromise that moves us along   My heart is full and my door's always open   You can come anytime you want   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   And She will be loved    And She will be loved   I know where you hide   Alone in your car   Know all of the things that make you who you are   I know that goodbye means nothing at all   Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls   Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautiful   She will be loved (repeated)   Please don't try so hard to say good bye.    &nbsp;  This song just came out into a music video. I havent heard good things about it. Great song. Some say its about prostitution... who knows... The different colored lines is a quote that i really like.

         For all my two readers out there that actually read this corruption to  society, i apologize for not posting the past two days. Two days ago i  spent the day a Brittney's.   I got on the Tri- Rail @ 8 am like a normal school day (it was a trip  down memory lane) I saw simon, but we did not aknowledge each other...  too bad, so sad. Brittneys mom picked us up, and i spent twelve  wonderful hours at her house. We played DDR, Crash Bandicoot. Listened  to Music, watched T.V., and of course, ate. Our little rondevous at  publix ended with me almost crashing her moms cart all over teh ground.  "I just busted in my pants Brittney" Ha.   So i went to Brittneys to see some Shakespeare play with her, and when  we got there it was all good. We ate a bunch of KFC chicken, biscuits,  coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese, and as we were preparing  to watch the play, my worst fear struck upon us, Lightning. I had to  leave as that is the one thing i am very afraid of in life, Natural  Disasters. So i forced her to come to the car with me where i proceded  to sit in the back seat and not look out the window so i would not have  to face those bolts of terror. THen the play was canceled and i was off  to my grandfathers to spend the night.   My grandpa is very rich and lives in somewhat of a mansion. Its worth  about a million dollars, and i benefit from it only when i visit there  and enjoy what it has to offer. Pool and spa (we'll get to taht later),  huge yard, big house, including my grandpas office/extra bedroom which  is a second story on top of the garage. It is a seperate house, and  that is where i stay when i go there. So i show up at my grandpas  and no one is home, my brother has been there the past week for a camp  that is in Jupiter. So i wait there expecting them home, and hour later  they show up, thank God i found the key that lets me in the house or i  would be stuck outside. So it was just any normal night. I couldnt get  on the computer (passworded) or i would have posted then, but i couldnt.    That was Thursday.    Friday, July 16th   I woke up to my grandpa typing and talking away in teh office portion  of hte guest house/bachelor pad thing. I pretended to sleep for like  ten more minutes, but gave up and just arose. Went down to see my  brother and cousin preparing for camp. No coffee cooking, i was  disapointed, i was in the mood for some coffee but i wasnt about to  ask. There were donut holes though, which i devoured half the  box, and little muffins. Then i watched tv and read the paper as  my grandpa brought the kids to camp. When he came home i asked him if  he could give me some work to do so i could make some money. He asks me  to clean the windows. Easy enough. Except my grandpas humongous house  has see through bay doors, and like 200 windows. and one thing about my  grandpa. He is anal retentive, and a perfectionist. So i had to do it  perfect lest i risk having to do it ALL over again. Two and a half  hours later, I was thirty dollars richer and my grandpa was praising me  on what a good job i did. Now, i spend enough of my day watching  VH1 and ESPN that i could risk doing something productive and  benefiting from it again. So i asked him for more work, getting paid 10  dollars and hour, and he told me to wash his beloved Ford Explorer.  Big, big car. And he has all the right materials. So that was simple  since i had cleaned a bunch of cars in my day, and now i had ten more  dollars plus a tip to equal 50 dollars!!! not a bad payment for only 4  hours work.   Then the bad part of hte day happened. I went swimming. In the  pool i thought it would be cool and relaxing to go under and swim  around under the surface. So i close my eyes, dive under, lose track of  where I am, and boom, hit the bottom, my face is SCREWED UP! My first  reaction is " MY TEETH, ARE MY TEETH OK" My teeth that are worth a net  amount of about $1,500 + . But my teeth were ok, it was my face that  was messed up. I feel under my lip and theres not blood,and i wonder  how i could have made it out of that without a scratch. Oh gosh  bobby... I get out and go into the outside bathroom, look in the mirror  and it was like something our of a horror movie. Blood is dripped all  down my face adn its everywhere, i pick up a towel and wipe it off,  ruined towel. I jump back in the water to clean it up. No help, i hold  pressue to it with a towel and go inside to explain to my grandparetns.  Two huge scrapes on my nose, a scrape on my upper lip, and on my chin.  Neosporin, band-aids, i feel fine, but now i look like a sufferer of  lepercy.   My mom came to pick us up, and when i get home, i eat and ZONK OUT (  Zonk means to fall asleep) I sleep for 4 1/2 hours missing the marlins  game, and i love the 90's but i wake up in time to take a shower and  watch the best week ever. Thank god for reruns on ILT90's.    It is now 3:00 in the after noon saturday. I'll post again tonight to talk about today.    LFO  "Summer Girls"   Yeah...I like it when the girls stop by.. In the summer  Do you remember, Do you remember?  ...when we met..That summer??  New Kids On The block,had a bunch of hits  Chinese food makes me sick.  And I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer,for the summer  I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch,  I'd take her if I had one wish,  But she's been gone since that summer..  Since that summer  Hip Hop Marmalade spic And span,  Met you one summer and it all began  Your the best girl that I ever did see,  The great Larry Bird Jersey 33  When you take a sip you buzz like a hornet  Billy Shakespere wrote a whole bunch of sonnets  Call me Willy Whistle cause I can't speak baby  Sumthin in your eyes went and drove me crazy  Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad,  Left one day and never came back  Stayed all summer then went back home,  Macauly Culkin wasn't Home Alone  Fell deep in love,but now we ain't speakin  Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton  When I met you I said my name was Rich  You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch  New Kids On The block,had a bunch of hits  Chinese food makes me sick.  And I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer,for the summer  I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch,  I'd take her if I had one wish,  But she's been gone since that summer..  Since that summer  Cheery Pez,cold crush,rock star boogie  Used to hate school so I had to play hookie,  Always been hip to the B-boY Style  Known to act wild and make girls smile,  Love New Edition and the Candy Girl  Remind me of you because you rock my world  You come from Georgia where the peaches grow  They drink lemonade and speak real slow  You love hip hop and rock n roll  Dad took off when you were 4 years old  There was a good man named Paul Revere  I feel much better baby when you're near  You love fun dip and cherry Coke,  I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke  When I met you I said my name was Rich  You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch  Bridge In the summertime girls got it goin on,  Shake and wigle to a hip hop song  Summertime girls are the kind I like,  I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike  Bugaloo shrimp and pogo sticks  My mind takes me back there oh so quick  Let you off the hook like my man Mr. Lipit  Think about that summer and I bug,cause I miss it  Like the color purple,macaroni and cheese,  Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees  Call you up but whats the use  I like Kevin Bacon,but I hate Footloose  Came in the door said it before,I think I'm over you  but I'm really not sure  When I met you I said my name was Rich  You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch  repeat Chorus  In the summer girls come and summer girls go  Some are worth while and some are so so,  Summer girls come and summer girls go  Some are worth while and some are so so,  Summertime girls got it goin on  Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song  Summertime girls are the kind I like  I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike    Can you say " Greatest song ever written" ? I can not even give you an  analysis on this song. the message is so deep that if anyoneone other  than LFO ever EVER uncoded its true intentions, God would come down and  kill us all by sending evil ostriches that shoot fire and shit out  twinkies filled with apple sause rather than creme. LFO = Lyrics Fuckin  Owesome (the O is there instead of the A on purpose, its all a part of  the creative eccentricness that is LFO.)

      Today was pretty cool... I woke up at 8:10, rolled over to see my t.v. on ESPN, watching Cold Pizza... i roll back over, next thing i know it is quarter till 11. I decide to get up, and i go down to eat ... i guess brunch because it was a peanut butter and jelly bagel ...   So i just screwed around all day waiting for Shaquille O'Neal to become part of the Miami Heat. So he did, and then i went to Katies.. and we went in the pool.  Then i came home and played Basketball... and then i went driving, and it was pretty relaxing for the first time in a while. Then i came home and watched I love the 90's and now im typing.  ANOTHER EXCITING DAY!!!  Well everyone... thankfully tommorow im actually doing something!! some play with brittney,... BUT I GET TO SLEEP OVER MY GRANDPAS! Ill tell you tommorow... alright... im done except the lyrics...  	 Only Wanna Be With You Lyrics Hootie & The Blowfish  You and me We come from different worlds You like to laugh at me When I look at other girls  Sometimes you're crazy And you wonder why I'm such a baby Cause the Dolphins make me cry  Well there's nothing I can do I've been looking for a girl like you  You look at me You've got nothing left to say I'll only pout at you until I get my way I won't dance You won't sing I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring.  Chorus: Well there's nothing I can do I only wanna be with you You can call me your fool Only wanna be with you  Put on a little Dylan sitting on a fence I say that line is great You ask me what I meant by Said I shot a man named Gray Took his wife to Italy She inherited a million bucks And when she died it came to me I can't help it if I'm lucky  Only wanna be with you Ain't Bobby so cool Only wanna be with you  (Solo)  Yeah I'm tangled up and blue Only wanna be with you You can call me your fool Only wanna be with you  Sometimes I wonder If it will ever end You get so mad at me When I go out with my friends Sometimes you're crazy And you wonder why I'm such a baby yeah The Dolphins make me cry  Well there's nothing I can do Only wanna be with you You can call me your fool Only wanna be with you Yeah I'm tangled up in blue Only wanna be with you  Me and daniel had some argument over the meaning of this song... so i had it stuck in my head and i posted it...

      You people need to go out and watch the Assistant, starring Andy Dick. It is the funniest think I have seen in a LOOOOONG time. Its so funny... they make is so dramatic but its so random and the way he treats these people... oh god he's hilarious.   So lets jump into the day. Katies house. Swimming. Home. Babysitting. Parents come home. Go eat dinner. Pick Up Car. Go driving. All - Star Game. I love the 90's. The Assistant. Sportscenter. Typing. Day.  Ok... boring day... you dont care... lets talk about lyrics...   Hands Down Dashboard Confessional  Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep, this air is blessed, you share with me. This night is wild, so calm and dull, these hearts they race, from self control. Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  The words are hushed lets not get busted; just lay entwined here, undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear... so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and I let you in. And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it.   I think what this song is trying to say is about a guy who is with a girl. Explanation of the year. And the guy is conciencious about whether or not this girl really loves her. He obviously is in love, entranced in her, as he feels that even her simple kiss could kill him. He is still worried about whether or not she will abuse him by ripping out his heart, or she could genuinly love him. At the end, he talks about another night when he meets up with her. He jumps over hte gate, bangs on the door, shes opens it, they kiss, he was reasurred that she loved him. END SCENE.   Theres my analysis of the song that i made in 4 minutes... have a good night everybody.

      Listening to: Switchfoot  God I need a girlfriend... but i dont at the sametime... stress... yeah... but i need someone i can hug and kiss at anytime i want... and they want to too of course... yeah.. so heres my boring day..  So today, i was sitting there, doing nothing, so i went into the jacuzzi at like 8'oclock. I love going in the Spa in hte morning... The sun is rising and the sky is clear but cloudy... its just very relaxing.  Then i got out and my mom came home... and she suggested to go do something with Katie. so i called her and asked her to go see Spiderman 2 with me, and she said yea, and i was excited, and then like usual, an exciting event was again cancelled... i dont know exactly why... something to do with our car getting fixed... i dont know...  At around four, I got Proactiv in the mail... It's a line of acne products that i bought... its really good... go check it out for yourself, i dont need to explain... www.proactiv.com  Then the MLB Home Run Derby... yeah... Then  I love the ninties was on, which was good but i put too much expectation in it, it kind of let me down.   Yeah, im tired, so im gonna log off.. cya   Switchfoot More Than Fine lyrics   When I wake in the morning I want to blow into pieces. I want more than just okay, more than just okay.  When I'm up with the sunshine I want more than just a good time I want more than just okay, more than just okay.  I'm not givin' up, givin' up now. I'm not givin' up, not backing down.  More than fine, more than bent on getting by. More than fine, more than just okay.  When I'm lit with the sunrise, I want more than just the blue skies I want more than just okay, more than just okay.  More than oceans away from the dawn More than oceans away from who we are. More than oceans, more than oceans More than fine.    This is how i feel a lot of the times... i want more than i have... but not just materialistic... like, mentally... I want to achieve all these goals i have for myself in a short amount of time... but i have my whole life. This is a very cocky song... kind of like me... i kind of feel that im better than everyone sometimes, and i desere more... and i think thats what Switchfoots trying to say about themselves and their fans...

      Listening to : SoCo (Something Corporate)  Vindicated... great song... I looked the word up and i found a bunch of definitions... couldnt decide which one I liked most to fit the theme of the song and the movie (Spiderman 2) check it out yourself... http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Vindicated  Prtty cool morning... woke up to French Toast... nice... Went up and played crash and watched sunday morning sportscenter while reading the sunday paper.   Now watching the Marlins game... before there was lightning... I dont like lightning very much. I dont like any natural disasters very much probably since 2nd grade because that was my first tornado warning.. and I wasnt cool with that. Especially since like a week before i saw the movie "Twister" which is a GREAT movie... no... not really... Wow, I think im an incomplete person... becasue of the fact that a use too many caesuras... these things... .... ... .... (yes daniel, it is CAESURAS im positive)  Its 3:46... Andrews leaving today until Friday... mixed emotions about that. Whenever one of the brothers leaves ( I have two), the other two always get spoiled with things we dont normally get spoiled with becasue there are three of us. Ex. Going out to dinner more, we see something we like, we get it .... yea... spoiled but thats ok... We're not hurting anyone.  Characters Andrew - Second youngest brother ( chuckie9225.blogspot.com )  Chris - Youngest brother.    Something Corporate Ruthless This is the only lonely picture Waiting on my floor littering my shore This is the last true burning letter Given to a girl Written by a boy Living in a world Created to destroy  But if I built you a city Would you let me? Would you tear it down?  But there you go for the last time I finally know now what i should have know then But I could still be ruthless if you let me But there you go when I'm not done Waving goodbye well at least you're having fun The rising tide will not let you forget me  This is your ghose that kneels before me Razors on her tongue a body full of oxygen It won't be the last time she'll ignore me Thinning in my skin Without the strength to go Winter setting in To cover you in snow But if I build you a city Would you let me in? Would you tear it down?  But there you go for the last time I finally know now what I should have know then But I could still be ruthless if you let me But there you go when I'm not gone Waving goodbye well atleast you're having fun The rising tide will not let you forget me  I'll raise towers and climb them Rivers and walk them Oceans to drown in You won't make a sound in  But there you go for the last time I finally know now what I should have known then But I could still be ruthless if you let me But there you go when I'm not done Waving goodbye well at least you're having fun The rising tide will not let you forget me ...forget me    I love this song... I m trying to try this thing where i post a song every post...

      Listening to : TJT : The Juliana Theory  So much music, so little time. In the past two days, I have non-stop listened to Something Corporate, The Juliana Theory, Switchfoot, Sugarcult, Sum 41, and Dashboard Confessional. I am trying to listen to all the music, and its working. I am starting to recognize almost all the tunes by the first few seconds of song...  So today i woke up extra early just to do the lawn work, and I am now 15 dollars richer. So i finished that up, then i played Crash all morning, and i read like 5 pages in G, G, & S. I basically talked to Brittney all day.  When I woke up in the morning, my mom surprised me with the news that im not going to the marlins game cuz we lost a ticket, but thats ok, because it was like 110 degress out today, so i would have been really cranky if it was hot and they lost. So i stayed home, and from 2:00 to 9:00 i was home alone. I ate, and went into the Jacuzzi, and the Marlins won, and I watched reports on ESPN all day about how Shaquille O'Neal is coming to the heat!!! WOO!!!   Ladiiiiiiiieeeeeesssssss and Gentleman... YOUR MIAMI HEEEEEEEEAAAAAT!!!!!  So, I downloaded the Spiderman 2 soundtrack offline, its like the best soundtrack ever... Then my parents came home, and I am now typing again...  I want to go to Warped Tour so badly, but I havent talked about it with my mom yet. I dont think she will mind, except the fact that she doesnt like the Pompano Beach Ampitheatre very much (thats where it is.) So... yeah. Im extremely tired,a nd im gonna work on something interesting to say tommorow... maybe... if im in the mood. I want to see spiderman tommorow... ok ADD... bye.   I Dare You To Move Switchfoot  Welcome to the planet Welcome to existence Everyone's here Everyone's here Everybody's watching you now Everybody waits for you now What happens next? What happens next?  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened before  Welcome to the fallout Welcome to resistance The tension is here The tension is here Between who you are and who you could be Between how it is and how it should be  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened  Maybe redemption has stories to tell Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell Where can you run to escape from yourself? Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? Salvation is here  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  I dare you to lift yourself  Lift yourself up off the floor  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  Like today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened before    (My favorite song as of today... It may be different by tommorow... who knows...)  *~ I change my mind a little too much for a person that is afraid of change. ~ *   - Me

      Listening to *Something Corporate*  Things like this always seem to happen to me. I wake up wanting to do something fun, and of course, it gets canceled. Ex: Going surfing with Erin. WEll, this morning i woke up, excited to go driving to the Wellington Mall to meet Brittney and Becca. But, of course, my dad took the van to work, and i cant drive the focus because its a stick shift, which i cant drive. So, I get driven to the mall, and I meet those pesky girls, and they make me go to all their feminine beauty stores. And I drag them into AE and Hollister... yeah. It was just your basic trip to the mall. WE went to most of the stores, and if you want to check it out that badly, go to www.wellingtonmall.com .   At the mall, I bought the Julianas Theory Cd, Love, (the title is a line from their song Repeating, Repeating. ) I also finally got the Dashboard Confessional CD from Brittney while i gave her sugarcult and switchfoot. I also got brown, cordoroy, shorts from Hollister.  So then i came home and played Crash Bandicoot, becasue Im old school.

      *Music*  Currently listening to: Sugarcult (Just bought it.)  God I love North Palm Beach. I LOVE IT!!! I go to school there as most of you all know. I was there today on the order of my moms buisness, so my brothers and I  went to Cityplace while my mother was in a meeting at Dreyfoos. We got lunch at Cityplace, and then we got Gelato at Bacio. Then we went to barnes and noble, restoration hardware, then the taj mahol of all schools. I guess their little trip inspired them to want to try out there no matter what. THey were even picking their spots where they are going to eat lunch when they go there.   So we go home, and i go to katies. Yeah. Then i went to the mall with Andrew (My brother www.chuckie9225.blogspot.com ) and his friend christian. Yea. I bought the sugarcult CD from hollister and i had mcdonalds for dinner. I ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING TODAY... even if it isnt interesting.  Tommorow, I go to the mall wiht Brittney and Becca, who i havent seen in MONTHS. Yea. I would write something deep and thought provoking.... but im too tired. Cya.

      What a boring summer this has been...  I need to be sixteen right now. I need to get in a car, and drive away, and go to North Palm, and go to the beach, and be with my friends, and go to Dreyfoos. I NEED TO GET OUT OF BOYNTON. THe only reason i still want to live here is katie. But, i cant complain, I have a pretty good life.  So, i slept in today. YEAH. Had some cheerios for breakfast, and nobodys cares, but i shall tell you and you shall like it. Crash Bandicoot must be the best video game ever. Not only have i beating it  like 20 times, but i can play the first level with my eyes closed. Well, i can play any level with my eyes closed, BUT I CAN WIN IT WITH MY EYES CLOSED. I need a job so badly. I need to make money. I need a lot of things... So, I continued to beat brittney in bandicoot. Then i went to light some matches,a nd my mom came home and bitched at me for not cleaning the house. Im going to dreyfoos tommorow for some meeting, but my date got canceled cuz im not gonna be there lnong enought to do anything with Emily. So, here i sit waiting to go driving, which i probalby wont.  Its cloudy out. Dont you hate clouds? I only like them in the morning, but they piss me off in teh afternoon. Night clouds piss me off too. They depress me and there is no need for them except to blcok the moon from all of us to see.   Im gonna post later cuz i have no life.

      Hi  What an interesting day... Um, got woken up but i wanted to sleep in. Had to go baby sit this dumb cat.   Guns, Germs and steel is officialy the MOST BORING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I read like 50 pages today, and so far of hte 135 pages i have read, i have somewhat enjoyed 1 CHAPTER. And the idiot author writes 20 pages on a subject, then procceeds to say at the end of each chapter "Each chapter can be summorized in one paragraph." So, im not going to put full effort into this, but im going to get through it.   Wow, what a boring day. I didnt go driving, i ate a lot. I read, I watched tv. um... i went on the computer. I played badmitten, and i went into the jacuzzi. Wasnt the most thrilling day, but yeah... The marlins won. Im on the phone with Brittney and Daniel. Yeah.  Well, i dont have anything to say, but it doesnt matter cuz only 2 people read my posts... yeah.  Bye.  CHARACTERS Daniel - Best friend ever Brittney - Best friend at Dreyfoos.

      Well, guess what... no surf trip today. Erin is having some... womanly problems, and her mom is sick... so im stuck at home until another day.  Got Guns, Germs and Steel today for AP World History... Fun, Fun, Fun. The whole premise of the book isnt that bad, but the vocab is a bit much, even for the level of schooling im in. If you really want to more info on it (WHICH YOU WONT)... go to www.patty-cake.blogspot.com ... Becca has some kind of bio thing about it. Or just google it.  THe book got me thinking about something though. If we really did evolve from apes... why didnt the apes we have today evolve either... Well, i guess we'll never be able to figure out whether it is evolution or God that brought up these Homo Sapians, but oh well.   AIM isnt working cuz we got rid of AOL today. So now I'm mad. I never use AIM really... but it's nice to have. You never really appreciate what you have until you lose it as some ancient asian dude once said.   I'm watching "The Fuse" right now, some copy of MTv/ VH1 type of thing... mostly music videos, which is cool... but it wont last for long...  Boring day... I want to go to school again... Dreyfoos I miss you... I want to go driving right now. Goodbye.  CHARACTERS OF TODAY Erin: One of my best friends at Dreyfoos. Very Ditzy. Very sweet. Becca: On of my best friends at Dreyfoos. Very Ditzy. Very Sweet. VERY STUBBORN! ( I love you Becca)

      Alright, here I am. Bobby. Palm Beacher and very proud. I go to Dreyfoos, only the best place on the face of the planet, which is in West Palm. Dreyfoos is like the heaven of all educational facilities... times 10. If I keep this thing going long enough... you'll find out all about it... if you dont already go there... which you probably do since most of the important people in my life go there... yeah. Bio thing: 15 years of age. 5"7, Brown hair (Kinda faded highlights), Brownish, Greenish eyes that change colors that depend on what I wear..., um, i guess pretty good looking, roman nose (kinda big), straight teeth (thank you braces), and of the few pimples i have, they will hopefully be gone in a few days after i get that proactive stuff from the television. Um, im pretty build, i work out, and i wear mostly hollister. 8 inches... thats my foot size. um, very hairy legs for all you kinky girls out there (wow, i just sounded like a desperate petifile... so much for a joke) Bio done.   So today was the fourth of july. Yeah. Is it bad that I hate the song "Proud to be an American" ? because I HATE IT!!! Its the most annoying thing ever put into song form. Maybe its because i have never experienced anything outside of this land, but i just cant find myself getting emotional and being appreciative of this country. Like, I am grateful to live here and do whatever i want (somewhat), but there is so much bad crap said about us that it kind of rubs off on this young, liberal, generation. Yeah... maybe i need to be dropped off in some third world country to finally appreciate it to the max... but for now, im just doing what i am told.  Yeah... so my third cousins came over today, and we went in Katies pool, then my jacuzzi. I was mostly on the computer all day. WE ate food, and then they went home, and i didnt get to go driving becasue my parents were entertaining... all I want to do is drive... only eleven months till i get my license. God, im going to be all over this town. So, then i lit some sparklers cuz my mom didnt want to buy real fireworks, and then i went upstairs and i said to myself. "Well Bobby, you've already lost enought self respect, why not throw it all out the window and start a blog!" So now im writing.  Tommorow I might be going surfing for the first time ever. yea. Thursday i might go on a date with Emily. Oh, life is such an uncertainty... but it's good. Good night.

      2nd day of school, it was ok. A lot better than I expected. Italion, TV Pro, Algebra, and Chemistry. Italian, she was very nice in the morning, i hope it stays that way... We just did review. TV Pro was awesome again, we went over script format and clues. Lunch was really pleasent except all the little juveniles running around. Algebra, we still have a sub, and im like the smartest one in the class again... Chemistry sucks, its boring, i want to kill myself. Went to Starbucks with Ryan after school cuz we were taking the 4 oclock train. Hung out with Kelsey and Emily and went to Katies.  The Juliana Theory  Now I'm at Katies, spending the night for four days while my parents are in New York. Itll be cool. I finally met the Ross's friend Joe... awesome dude. Dan made some icons for everybody and they were awesome. Im really excited now, so I just wanted to make a little post so i feel good. Well, lyrics lyrics...  Something Corporate Me and the Moon  It's a good year for a murder she's praying to jesus, she's pulling the trigger there's no tears, cause he's not here she washes her hands, and she fixes the dinner but soon they'll be coming to rush her away no one's so sure if her crime had a reason reasons like seasons they constantly change and the seasons of last year like reasons have floated away away with this spilt milk away with this dirty dish water, away seventeen years, and all that he gave was a daughter "it's me and the moon," she says i got no trouble with that but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die"it's me and the moon," she says and it's over, but it just started the blood stained the carpether heart like a crystal she's lucid and departed a life left behind, she can find in her mind gone away away with these nightmares away with suburbia shake down away you marry a role and you give up your soul til you break down"it's me and the moon," she says "i got no trouble with that, but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die" "it's me and the moon," she saysbut what do you say we go for a ride? what do you say we get high? but i'm so tired of days that feel like the night "it's me and the moon," she says and i got no trouble with that, but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die i am a butterfly, i am a butterfly, i am a butterfly   I had that song stuck in my head the whole day. Great song. Kinda know whats it means, but i dont have the energy to explain. Goodnight.

      First day of school. If you are reading, you probably already know about it, and im not going to spend 20 minutes explaining something that 3 people are going to read. But it was a good day, some disapointments and stuff, but hey, everything cant be perfect.  But the county came up with a new rule involving FCAT. Every other wednsday, we go to school at 10:30 so that we can stay home and... get this... sleep in. I knew this county would roll around somehow...  Coheed and Cambria - A Favor House Atlantic  Well, My uncle buddy finally died last night, so my parents are leaving at one oclock tommorow and my brothers and I have to stay with the Ross's for 3 days. There is a hurricane coming and the Ross's and us are going to have a big HURRICANE PARTY WOO!!!!!!  Well, lyrics, goodnight.

      Well everyone, im proud to say that in less than twelve hours, I will be awaking for another wonderful year at Dreyfoos School of the Arts. Im making this an early post because im going to be early tonight.  Right now, i would like to review my summer, just in time for the new year:  - Got my learners permit. Now im practicing driving all over southern Palm Beach. Just one more year till ill be let loose. - Went to Chicago, Illinois to visit my best friend Dan. Stayed there for one week with Katie in Daniels house. We did a lot including going to the City, going to Six Flags, and even going to the dollar store.      Maroon 5 - Sweetest Goodbye  - Hung out with Brittney a total of 5 times. Thats a lot more than i thought. - Daniel returns back to Florida and stays at my house for a week. We go to the beach, Cityplace, meet Brittney, and get to see Alex Olivera for the first time in about a year. - I start my blog. July 4th 2004, a very eventful day. I burn my thumb on a sparkler, start this thing, and wake up the next morning finding out i wont be surfing for the first time ever. - Summer reading. First time I ever had to do this. I successfully read one of my favoritve books ever (The Good Earth) and the worst book i have ever read (Guns, Germs, and Steel.) -See Spiderman 2 three times. Best movie ive ever seen, cant wait for the third installment. - Start listening to a broader range of music, including Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, Story of the Year, Sugarcult, and Switchfoot. - The end of July, Ryan, Alex, Kelsey, Brittney, Katie Sadow, and I all meet up at Alex's house for a party type thing. We had a great time while seeing Spiderman 2, playing cranium, making bar-b-q (oh god...) losing my voice, and spending the night in Jupiter. - The best time ever. WARPED TOUR. We spend a total of 8 hours there seeing a variety of bands including Yellowcard, Sugarcult, Story of the Year, Coheed and Cambria, New Found Glory, and NOFX. - Time on the phone. I spent so much time on the phone this summer, it was unhealthy. But i would like to thank Brittney, Daniel, and Becca... including special guests like Katie Ross, Erin Porter, and Emily (Brittneys friend)  for making every night after 9 a blast.  Well, thats the main events of my summer in a nutshell. It was fun while it lasted, but I can not wait to start another year at the school of the Arts, making Films, speeches, and getting more stressed out then i ever have before. Well, have a good school year everyone!  Black Eyed Peas Lets Get it Started  Let's get it started in here.......

      New storyboard. I like this one much better. Hopefully Mr. Rhore (Ryan) will help me with this project. The TV Pro is supposed to be a film teacher primarily so that is really good...  Bend and not break Dashboard Confessional Storyboard and Lyrics  0:00 - 0:27 - Feet walking 0:28 - 0:41 - Feet running. show parts of face 0:42 - 0:48 - Running up stairs 0:49 - 1:02 - Continue running up stairs over to CP bridge leading to FAO Scwartz. Stop in middle. 1:03 - 1:22 - Look over bridge at girl running under bridge upset, he turns around and watches her come back out from under and watches her continue to ride. Jumps up onto railing. Shot of him seeming like he fell on the ground. 1:23 - 1:36 - Runs after her 1:37 - 1:48 - Screams in her face, she pays no attention to him at all. 1:49 - 2:04 - Shows our guy holding hands with another girl, and our girl finds them. 2:05 - 2:24 - Boy trying to grasp onto her, cant seem to do it, gets on his knees and watches her.(2:16) 2:25 - 2:37 - Girl shopping in Anthropologie, he is spying on her behind things. 2:38 - 2:51 - Girl meets up with other guy, our guy looks shocked, then starts smiling. 2:52 - 3:05 - Backflashes of him pushing her away onto the ground and screaming at her in front of people as she gets up and runs away. 3:06 - 3:20 - Back to chasing her, trying to grab ahold of her and talk to her. 3:21 - 3:31 - Shots of both of them seperatly, he is sitting on a bench obviously distressed, and she is stepping onto a trolly. Back and forth the shots go. 3:32 - 3:59 - UNDECIDED 4:00 - 4:10 - Him chasing trolly and her looking back at him, shocked looking. 4:10 - 5:03 - The trolly stops and he gets on and runs toward her in the back. He starts mouthing the words of the chorus in the song, but hes not singing, hes just yelling them at her (This part may be cut for something else due to the fact that i dont want the viewers to get the impression that I am singing.) After third "Now" she jumps on him, and starts hugging him. He smiles coyly into the camera while saying the last few nows. Undecided last few seconds.  Dashboard Confessional Bend and not Break  I pedal up these steps now Decisive and intentioned Precise a pattern specifically to yours I'm talented at breathing Especially exhaling So that my chest will rise and fall with yours  I'm careful not to wake you Fearing conversation It's better just to hold you And keep you pacified I'm talented with reason I cover all the angles I can fail before I ever try  Try to understand there's an old mistake that fools will make And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break) Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break)  I am feeling agile I can bend and not break But I can break and take it with a smile And I am so resilient I recover quickly I'll convince you soon that I am fine  Try to understand there's and old mistake that fools will make And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break) Wont you hold me now  Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you, to you  And try to understand there's and old mistake that fools will make And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away So wont you hold me now? Wont you hold me now? Now, now, now, now, now

      ONE DAY!!!  ONE FREAKING DAY UNTIL WE REACH THE HOLY GRAIL AGAIN! Its like Christmas Eve... Only Dreyfoos Eve.  This morning my parents were in a fight. I dont know why. Somethign about my dad having the day off but my mom doesnt have time to do anything with him... idk...  I got my teeth cleaned today at the dentist. Does anyone else get skeeved when they polish your teeth with that weird toothpaste. I only went for the free toothbrush.  I just primarily hung out. I want to try out for SNL someday. I went swimming in Katies pool. Anna, Katies sister, decided to take an entire bottle of tanning oil and pour it into the pool. Oil everywhere, i had to wash my face, and Fred katies dad, went fucking balistic. Anna is like 6. Next thing i know, no ones mad at her anymore and shes eating an ice cream sandwich. HOW THE FUCK DID SHE GET AWAY WITH THAT! Oh well...  So, im too tired to type. Some other stuff happened... but you dont care. Well, goodnight.  Reactor  - The Juliana Theory  Feeling the Love  - Congradulations     You're looking my way, you're looking good Needs no explaining, it's understood Electric shivers, across my skin It's like a fever, and you're my only medicine  Could I be dreaming your touching                           I'm feeling the love as it flows through the air Lighting my fire, igniting desire It's hotter than heaven in here  You show me yours, I'll show you mine Don't hurry baby, take your time Know what I'm thinking, you think the same Tear up the rulebook, and maybe we can play the game  Could I be dreaming your touching I'm feeling the love as it flows through the air Lighting my fire, igniting desire It's hotter than heaven in here  WHAT A GREAT FUCKING SONG!!! THe chorus is catchy as hell. It was featured on that AXE commerical, where the dude opens the book and the girls shirt opens... you know that one? This is an extremely underground band, Reactor, they are from a small town in Europe and have like 6 songs. I think they have like one album with 3 songs on it. But the dudes voice is cool. They sound very familiar to Maroon 5. Very familiar... Goodnight.

      Im updating now, at 8:26, because i have a feeling that my mom is gonna make me get off at 9:30 or 10 so im not taking a risk and doing it now.  Huey Lewis and the News - If this is it  I woke up surprisingly late today. 10ish... i thouhgt i was gonna be up by 7 or so to go mow the lawn., but i woke up and my parents weren't home, and when they did (they were at Publix) we didnt have blueberry pancakes like i was hoping. There was a big chunk of day where i dont remember what i did, but i do remember watching the MArlins game and mowing the lawn, resulting in a 15 dollar pay check. 20 dollars comes my way tommorow when i get paid for catsitting.  Another pointless day, which will be followed by two more pointless days before school FINALLY starts! I can not wait personally, and i know a lot of my friends cant eitehr... except Katie Sadow... cuz she is WEIRD. Is he kidding? Yes. Well, i dont have ANYTHING left to talk about... I think I want to have the halloween party this year... if my parents say yes... SORRY RYAN, im sure your parents will be disapointed to hear you cant host the second one...  Take a picture Filter   Awake on my airplane Awake on my airplane My skin is bare My skin is theirs Awake on my airplane Awake on my airplane My skin is bare My skin is theirs I feel like a newborn And I feel like a newborn Awake on my airplane Awake on my airplane I feel so real  Chorus: Could you take my picture? Cuz I wont remember Could you take my picture? Cuz I won't remember Could you take my picture? Cuz I won't remember Could you take my picture? Cuz I won't remember Yeah  I don't believe in I dont believe in In your sanctity You privacy I dont believe in I dont believe in Sanctity A hypocrisy Could everyone agree that No one should be left alone Could everyoone agree that They should not be left alone yeah And I feel like a newborn And I feel like a newborn Kicking and screaming  Chorus  Hey dad what do you think about your son now Ah hey dad what do you think about your son now  Chorus (x4)  I love that song a lot. I listened to is like 5 times today in an attempt to fill this endless void in my life called BORING. Good night everyone.

      WHY WONT IT STOP RAINING!!! IT HAS BEEN RAINING ALL WEEK AND IM SICK OF IT!!! Sorry... i like rain sometimes, but not seven afternoons in a row...  So i slept in until eleven today... i thought my dad would make me go mow the lawn early, but he never did. I told him i would do it later when it was cooler. It was just way too hot out. So i woke up and went over to babysit the Ross's cats... twenty bucks... oh so nice... Then my dad asked me if i wanted to go drive and pick up some pizza. I did, and parked extremely well! Wooo for parking.  Crying, Crying - Sugarcult  I watched the Michael Jackson movie on VH1 today. It was really good except it was completely biast to proving Jacksons innocence, and didnt talk about any of the evidence practically proving he did it. I could see that he didnt, cuz in his mind hes like a 12 year old, and twelve year olds sleep over at each others house and dont do anything bad. But he is an adult, and they have sexual tensions... and he didnt really have a wife at these times, and hes a strong Jahovas witness, so self pleasure might be ruled out, i dont know, im not a witness...So i could see him getting carried away and going after his closest resorce, little kids. The ending of the movie really sucked too.  Yeah, so later on i went and washed the cars. ANd then it started raining and i couldnt mow the lawn. Then the Marlins played, my mom made homeade brownies, and i just played some video games.  I got my train schedule today, if you want to see what the times are for the train for dreyfoos, go to my post below that i posted earlier.  I htink since i saw the Michael Jackson movie, a movie dedicated to the Jackson 5, and Michael Bashires documentary of Michael all in the past two days (VH1 is having some Jackson explosion for some reason) I am going to use my favorite MJ song, even though i dont really like him and i think he's creepy, I still like some of his music... COME ON! WHO DOESNT???  Rock with you Michael Jackson  1st Verse  Girl, close your eyes Let that rhythm get into you Don't try to fight it There ain't nothin' that you can do Relax your mind Lay back and groove with mine You got to feel the heat And we can ride the boogie Share that beat of love Chorus I wanna rock with you (all night) Dance you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock with you (all night) We're gonna rock the night away  2nd Verse Out on the floor There ain't nobody there but us Girl, when you dance There's a magic that must be love just take it slow 'Cause we got so far to go When you feel that heat And we're gonna ride the boogie Share that beat of love  Chorus I wanna rock with you (all night) Dance you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock with you (all night) We're gonna rock the night away  Bridge And when the groove is dead and gone (yeah) You know that love survives So we can rock forever, on Refrain I wanna rock with you I wanna groove with you I wanna rock with you I wanna groove with you  Chorus I wanna rock (all night) with you girl (sunlight) Rock with you, rock with you girl (yeah)    (all night) Dance the night away  Chorus I wanna rock with you (yeah) (all night) Rock you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock with you (all night) Rock the night away Feel the heat feel the beat Rock you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock - rock the night away

       Anthem of our dying day - Story of the Year   Well, it is 12:42, and im tired. I went to a Marlins game today. They won in a last at bat stance by Paul LoDuca in the ninth inning. Woo... go Marlins.  I just sat around earlier in the day, until we went to home depot. We're making some kind of patio on the side of our house. 4 days till school. Im watching olympic basketball. Im tired. Goodnight.  I know, i know, Story of the Year twice in one post... but i only listened to them and Something Corporate today, and i really wasnt paying attention when i was playing SoCo, so i was more emotionally attached to SOY... yeah, whatever.  Sidewalks Story of the Year     The bridge is all crumbled. The water soaks into rocks that fell at the bottom of the road (At the end of the town.) The town that we lived in. The memories shaken apart from the weeds that grow  Over the sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew, Sidewalks, Like the time we thought was made for you. Or  Out on the front porch, watching the cars as they go by (Eighteen blue, twenty one grey) Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive, Out on our own, To speed away  From the sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew, Sidewalks, Like the time we thought was made for you. Or  All of the days have passed us by, All of the sun is gone... away.  Sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew, Sidewalks, Like the time we thought was made for you. (Sidewalks) The bridges are crumpled, (Sidewalks) The water soaks into rocks, That fell at the bottom of the road.  I like this song so much. It doesnt really ahve to do with love, which is original, which i really like. Good music video material... original stuff... we'll see.  GOD SEND ME A SCHEDULE TOMMOROW!!!

      Music is just cool. I felt like saying that. Well, the anticipation mounts for school to begin. Still no schedule, im pissed. But, at least... the sky is blue? No, its gray... Ok, well, what happened today... Um, I get to babysit Katies cat for money. And so continue the never ending chronicles of the ADVENTURES OF BOBBY SEIFTER!!!! Today, our masked hero realizes he doesnt have any special powers, but he can make a mean grilled cheese sandwich. Ok Joan Rivers, stop with the small talk bullshit.... (Sorry, im talking to myself again)  Yeah, no  one is going to be on tour in Florida for a while, and im pissed. BUt i am also confused because Sugarcult has not been on their palm trees and powerlines tour yet... unless they count that as warped tour... They better be here, cuz im gonna be all up in dat shit... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... no.  Um, tommorow im going to a Marlins game... if i had a party popper, I wouldnt pop it. Its going to be hot, and tehy are going to be losing and im going to get mad and threaten the lives of one of the players only to be yelled at by my mom because "Good fans always support their teams not matter what." If you have a mom that knows what a double-play is,  you get scolded about stupid shit like that. Well, lyrics... um, i havent decided yet but ill think of something... Dashboard... no, Switchfoot... no,  Sugarcult... no, SoCo... no, TJT... no, YELLOWCARD! Havent posted lyrics from them in a while... ok, how about an oldy that i listened to today...  Underdog                                            I absolutely do not relate to this song, but it is catchy.  Yellowcard   One more trip down  To the lost and found  To find your heart  That the quarterback punk               Is it possible to walk to the lost and found if your heart was   Dropped on the ground                      actually ripped physically out of your chest?            One more trip down  To the lost and found  To find your heart   Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game Beat up after class                                     Do they still do that?   No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one anymore   One long walk down  Through the hallway now  You're finding out  That you don't fit in this time around  One long walk down  Through the hallway now  You feel left out   Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game  Beat up after class  No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one anymore   Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game  Beat up after class  No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one anymore  Wooooo                                                            Greatest lyric ever written with the point of a pen    Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game  Beat up after class  No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one

      Wow, i just saw Maroon 5 - She will be loved the video for like the fourth time. It gets better and better every time I see it. The story just all makes sense. The mom wants to be loved, thats all she wants, and she will be loved. (By Adam Levine.) Which is kind of odd, but cool... at least its origianal.   Sorry for stealing your post Daniel, but after seeing it again, i just had to post about it

       Under Pressure - Queen and David Bowie   So today was that dermatology appointment thing which was alot easier than i thought. DIdnt have to get naked, only my shirt. And my mole was absolutly nothing. Benighn, if you want to say. But she did suggest these pills for my pimples and some exfoliating thing that we didnt buy. Its amazing how if i rant over something like Proactive, it doesnt work and has to be returned. Well, we get our money back for it, and we get to keep the proactiv cuz they dont want it back. So now i get to keep that stuff, and im on a pill. But im not getting my hopes up because if i do, its all over and it doesnt work. That just seems to happen alot.  So, Dreyfoos pissed me off today, cuz i see a letter in the mail from them, and i get all excited cuz i think its my schedule. But its some letter of thanks because my parents donated a couple hundred bucks. I was mad and i threw it on the floor and threatened to quit dreyfoos. But i lied. Because i love dreyfoos.  Yeah, so today wasnt that bad. Another South Florida terrential downpour, but its nice sometimes. Hopefully it wont rain on the first day of school. Yeah, so tommorow is another eventless day, and on Friday, um, the Michael Jackson movie premeires on VH1 and i think im going ot a Marlins game, and then we go into the final weekend before we are launched into the new school year. Ok, well, im tired of typing, and im just rambling now, so lyrics, and goodnight.  Can't say bomb on an Airplayne            Bobby Seifter                              Waking up to an electric timer            It buzzs as you pass                      As you look it in the eye And tell it to die It doesnt listen No it doesnt listen to you                 And you live by these restrictions In a world so full of terror And you tell me what I can and can not do But your just another human No one special, no one fine But we listen to your voice That seems to be better than mine  And when your told what to do                 You feel a pressure to contradict             And as I'm cheating on my girlfriend       While stealing from a store Im screaming bomb on an airplane              You cant stop me anymore  I will loiter and I will liter And Im reading from the bible Cuz what seems like no big deal Has to be taken with procautions Cuz anything can happen But nobody knows for sure (Chorus)  So here i go, past the red light Into a fenced up area from the world And I feel so damn tempted To do what they say to not But I dont

       In the Shadows - Story of the Year   Tommorow I have a dermatologist appointment that im worried about. I dont know why. But i dont like specialized doctors. If they tell me to get naked, i wont.   Today was another boring day. Blah. Im starting ot write lyrics for no reason. And im making two storyboards a day. Im ready for school. Im ready for the communications department again. Im ready to work. Im ready to see my friends. Im ready to ride the train. Im ready to get stressed out again. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!!!! Yeah, im just posting for the heck of it.  Um, ive decided that I do not like the show "Wanna come in" I really hate it and it makes me angry. Im not going to explain because i will get angry and punch myself in my already disloacted arm. Well, i have some lyrics that i wrote today. Not anything from anyone else. Ill post songs that i wrote in other posts later on. Im not a musican. But i love music, and i like to write so i combined them. Music really is poetry in motion...  Love Song Bobby Seifter    <>Sitting in the shower Looking at myself  Looking at an image that is you <>        But you are not here  No we're more than miles apart And i think oh dear Here i go <>       No this is not a love song  Oh how could it be Cuz your not even here   Chorus No noones really here And I'm not even in love <>       And as I sit here  Wanting so bad. To be tangled up in your arms, That do not exist <>       But i want them to be here  Oh I want them so bad To feel those arms To love those arms That are around my neck   (Chorus) <>       But this has never happened.  No, this has never happened. And this will never happen Before  That is Love Song. But it isnt a love song... remember that.

Last night I set up a music video story board. I did it to the song "Carve your heart out yourself" By Dashboard Confessional. First I'll post the lyrics. Then I'll try to give a link to the actual song. Then I'll type up my Story board for you.   Carve your heart out yourself Dashboard Confessional  Carve your heart out yourself Hopelessness is your cell Since you've drawn out these lines Are you protected from trying times?  Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all Oh Lord, now, there you go with hope again Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end  Dig a ditch deep enough To keep you clear of the sun You've been burned more than once You don't think much of trust  Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all Oh Lord, now, there you go with hope again But I'll be sure your secret is safe with me Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end Treating me like I'm already gone  But I'm not, I will stay where you are always I will stay, I will stay, I will stay (all of now)  [repeat to fade out]  Sorry, cant find streamline music for you to connect to. DOWNLOAD IT OR BUY THE CD!    Storyboard  0:00 - 0:23 - Man sitting down on a chair, arms on knees looking down at floor. 0:24 - 0:30 - Man looks up into camera, gets up and starts to walk out of corner. 0:31 - 0:40 - Looks at girl in sleeping bed 0:41 - 0:52 - Boy lies on bed, and looks at girl. Camera view from high angle. 0:53 - 0:59 - Girls eyes open - look at where boy was, but hes not there. 0:59 - 1:07 - Sits up and puts hands on face. 1:08 - 1:20 - Scene change, make smooth transition, now at school, sitting in cafeteria talking with friends. 1:21 - 1:36 - Watches boy cross cafeteria out the doors as she sighs 1:37 - 1:48 - Boy looks through glass door at girl, the girl is not paying attention to him. 1:49 - 1:53 - He walks away, and she looks at where he was. 1:54 - 2:05 - Girl looks at friends, gets up and runs out of cafeteria. 2:06 - 2:11 - Girl running, face, feet... 2:12 - 2:15 - Girl catches up and grabs boy by shoulder 2:15 - 2:22 - They look into each others eyes. 2:23 - 2:44 - She turns around and visualizes other guys telling her they will stay - maybe 2 of them. 2:45 - 3:39 - UNDECIDED.   Well, that is a basic storyboard i created. My own format, my own material. Its not that good really. When you just look at the words, it seems very boring. BUt i hope to catch some good angles and camera shots that make it deeper and more visually tasty than that... ^. Again, I created that listening to the song once, only pausing where i needed to pause to catch the time marks. Im not even sure what the meaning of the song is. That up there will almost definatly be changed. Gonna make it with Ryan if he wants to. Well, I'll post later. Hopefully. Maybe.  Im in the making of another story board - another DC song, "Bend and Not Break"

      Wow, that is like my only reaction to the Warped Tour. It was the most amazing experience that ive had almost all summer (except seeing Daniel... ok, glad i said that, otherwise my head would be ripped off.)  There are so many lyrics and song titles i could use, that i just used the rock on symbol.  Alright, sorry i couldnt post last night, i fell asleep like right after i got home.  Ok, so now im going to summarize the Warped Experience for you by band and events of the day  Brittneys dad dropped us off there at 1:10. We walked like a block until we reached the ampithearte, where we were enjoyably patted down by some middle aged bald man. We got in and first we just stood there wondering what to do. All American Rejects were playing, and we went to look at the lineup, and then we went to get into the crowd to watch them. That got boring and Brittney, Ryan, and I left Emily with her boyfriend and we went to find Morgan and Becky. We met them in the actual ampithearte, and Morgans (I guess boyfriend) was there, his name was Steven, really cool kid. So then we wanted to go see Matchbook Romance, but we couldnt find them, and we walked behind the two main stages, the Brian and Teal stage. There was a lot going on. When we got back in the front of the stages, we had to wait for the Bouncing Souls to finish before Coheed and Cambria could start. I was getting really anxious cuz it was the hottest part of the day and i wanted to see Coheed quick so i could go get comfortable. So finally after lke 20 minutes, bouncing souls ended, and coheed came on. Of course, two minutes later, everyone was jumping and i was like suffocating, so i had to go cuz i thought i was gonna fall down. So we went and got water and went ot the side stage to see them perform "A favor house atlantic" and then we left. We went back into the ampitheartre and met back up with Morgan and everyone, and then we went down to eat some lunch. We saw Marcos which was cool and there was a really good band that we didnt know the name of, but i think it was Chronic Future. So we had hot dogs, and then we went to the entrance to meet Becca and Erin. Flogging Molly started playing and we could hear them and i started dancing. They werent bad, but i could only see myself listening to their cd like twice a year. We lost Becca and Erin shortly and then we went walking around the band tents. We went to Matchbook Romance, and it turned out they were in their tent! I got all of their autographs on my shoe, and they were telling me jokes. A little odd but totally cool. We then went to Coheed and Cambrias tent and inside was the lead singer. Morgan freaked otu and i got his autograph too. Then it started to pour. Everyone ran under a tree, excpet me who wanted to get wet. So then i told Ryan and Steven i wanted to go see a band in the rain. It was downpouring and we started runnig towards the teal stage. Taking Back Sunday was on and they were awesome. They finished shortly, and then the Vandels went on. They sucked. Then when NOFX was about to start, i decided i wanted the girls to see them too. So i went to go get them, and i see morgan and Becky running around panicked. THey lost Brittney. So now we run to the other guys and tell them that Becky and I will find brittney and come back. after like 15 minutes, we find Brittney and we just sint in the back and watch NOFX. Then Sugarcult came on. They were amazing. I knew almost all their songs, and it was still kinda raining so they were so proud that we were all still there rocking on. They are hopefully going to be back in a few months with Greenday. After sugarcult was Billy Talent and then Bad Religion. We went to find Morgan, Steven, and Becky, who left us, but we couldnt find them. So we waited by the lineup poster thing for an hour, watching the two bands, and like 2 minutes before story of the year started, they call us and tell us where they are. We find them and SOY starts. THEY WERE AWESOME. I was screaming and singing so loud i almost lost my voice. Anthem of our dying day, and Until the Day I die were amazing songs, and SOY were doing backflips, spinning their guitars around their necks, and jumping into the crowd to surf. Right after them was my favorite band, Yellowcard. I knew every word to every song and was jumping up and down. For like 2 songs i was in the middle of the crowd, and the rest we stood kinda in the back because of mosh pits and mud fights. Still awesome. Some guy grabbed my chest and started shaking me saying "This is a Yellowcard dude right here" He was drunk, but it was really funny. Finally, the last band was New Found Glory. They are from here, so that was pretty cool, but they were kind of disapointing. I really didnt like them, and i think that everyone was really tired so all the moshing and jumping kind of died down. The concert was over, but i was still buzzing, covered in dirt, and totally sore. We got into the car and went to McDonalds, french fries and ice cream, and then headed home. It was a great day, and i cant wait to do it the rest of my high school life and maybe more.  So that was on Saturday. Today is Monday, and my last post was on Thursday. Sorry about that, i just havent had a lot of time. Well, dont worry, nothing has happened. Ill update later tonight. Well, lyrics. and goodday for now.  Sugarcult Shes the Blade  Don't you make a move tonight You can only stagger Once shes got you in her sight You're the one shes after  Shes the blade and you're just paper You're afraid cause shes got closer You're back-steppin and back-stabbing everything in your life  She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back  One by one you count the fights Doesn't even matter That shes got you by surprise Misery's your master  Shes the blade and you're just paper You're afraid cause shes got closer Your back-steppin and shes out wrecking everything in your life  She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back  She stole everything She controlled everything  She stole everything She controlled everything  Shes the blade Shes the blade Shes the blade and you're the paper Shes the blade and you're just...  Shes the blade and you're just paper You're afraid cause shes got you closer  She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back  She stole everything She controlled everything She stole everything And controlled everything   Morgan and Steven were making out the whole time. I didnt even know they were going out until Story of the Year played.    I love this song, and i was the only one that new all the lyrics at the concert. Im special.
