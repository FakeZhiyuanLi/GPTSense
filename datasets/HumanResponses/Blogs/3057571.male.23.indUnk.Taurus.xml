      back again...all the traveling is really tiring.  It makes me appreciate the small things in life.  Like when they accidentally give you your Boss's first class ticket and stick him in coach! Thats Rich!  First Class is the best you know.  There is a definite difference in the attitude from coach.  Everyone in coach is just a little crabby for some reason.  In first class they treat you like angels, free drinks, free food, and nice wide seats.  Whatever....I travelled to D.C. this week and it was great being in the outdoors with some warmer weather for once.  I walked around the monuments and got to see some of D.C.  Should be a good weekend for fun and games.  k.e.

      Ah,  Another Bday almost under my belt.  I think birthdays are ripe for reflection.  Its so blatant the number of years you have been on this earth and to think about how one more has changed you.  I'm not one for reflection all too much.  I think in general people confuse reflecting on the past with regret.  The two are not the same but so many people these days are unhappy that they only see negative when they look back.    I've always been one for a happy and healthy life.  I think that you have to make the most of life and when your not enjoying life it's your own fault.  Obviously some can't help the situation they are in but for the most part being happy with what you have is the key to life.  Today was a great bday, I got a scavenger hunt for presents from Nats which was awesome.  Many great gifts, the best of which was a car rack and an ipod.  My bro says I sold out by getting an ipod.  Live in the now I say.  Plus he got a cell phone first so there.    Good times seem to be on the horizon as graduation and bonnaroo loom.  They are my only respite from work in this sea of madness MADNESS!!!  Who ever thought you could spend 6 hours on a phone call, talking about reports.  Another riveting day at the office...  Looking forward to a kickass weekend.  k.e.

      Wellity Wellity Wellity,  Another day passes slowly through my fingers.  Another unremarkable week as I travel to D.C. and back just in time to decompress before the weekend.  Things are good here.  Travel is making me tired but at my age what doesn't?  It's odd that I've started to call myself an "Old Man" but I defintely see the traits emerging and the comfort that lies in them.  Sleeping in but not being able to sleep past 10a.m., being sore a good deal of the time, finding myself driving slower and not in such a rush all seem to be tell tale signs of growing older.  If you ask me I would say there is no correlation to the fact that my bday falls on the 28th of next week.  On the contrary I am whole heartedly looking forward to presents, good food, good cheer and plenty of love.  What more could one ask for?  It just makes me think, everything that I have ever read about life has said in a nutshell that life is the journey so don't wait for your destination because that is not the reward.  They probably said it more eloquently but I think living happy is the goal rather than working towards something that will make you happy.  If this is the case some major changes are ahead for me.  Don't hold your breath...  k.e.

      Bienvenidos,  Ah, blogging, a public forum for inner thoughts.  Its an interesting dynamic of having so personal ideas and expressions being shared publicly.  I am guessing this is why so many people write stream of conciousness and at the same time do not write all that is on their mind.  So fearful are we of being judged by our actions that we censor ourselves.  Hey, maybe somethings are better left unsaid.  Another week in D.C.  Last weekend was good times spend with old friends.  Funny how old friends of nearly 4 years become so infrequently seen after only 8 months.  I am going to try to stay up with people but life sometimes gets in the way.  I got to see Anan tonight which was great, catching up, talking shop, the likes of good times.  A few memories of this weekend that I want to preserve not so much for you to read but hopefully to preserve some kind of memories in my fading head.  Schneider sleeping in the basement, lazy days on the dock swimming and sunning, great times at Allerton with the frisbee, Tommy hiding from cops in a tree, Pips up to his usual antics, and spooning with Nick the night away.  Good Times.  k.e.

      Another long week in D.C. sigh...Nothing like room service and rain to keep you inside the hotel.  Otherwise I'm pretty pumped about Bonnaroo.  It promises to be a rockin time.    So I'm planning on being Champaign this weekend, I'm interested in seeing who else shows up.  I know scheider will be there but I don't know about any other little rascals.    Hmmm, I hope my cold gets over soon, sucks sitting in meetings all day and feeling shitty on top of it.  k.e.

      Yesterday's High Points:  -Getting to go home from D.C. early in the week  -Seeing the Cherry Blossoms in D.C. and spring (as opposed to cold old Madison)  Traveling has its perks like eating out and seeing the country.  The overwhelming downside is being away from home and Nat’s and being tired all the time.  In the 8 months I’ve worked at Epic gone on the following trips:  -Washington D.C.-14 times -Oakland-4 times -Pasadena-1 time -Denver-1 time  20 trips in 8 months...craziness  In my travels I have seen great things that I probably would have never seen before.  Alcatraz, the golden gate bridge, national monuments, and Colorado Rockies are a few of the great things I have gotten to experience.  Traveling definitely takes its toll, it’s a tiring life…

      Just got back from seeing "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"  I highly recommend it.  The premise that memories can be erased is haunting but played off well in the movie.  I could see why some people would want to erase memories but to me the concept is foreign.  I can't comprehend losing even a minute of memories as they are what make life worth living.  Good and bad, a life without memories is no life at all.  Time for some Wine...  k.e.

      The world is really what you make of it.  I've learned this from countless experiences and a whole slew of metaphysical novels written in the 70's.  Novels that talk about the greater purpose in life and how we can achieve it.  Bygones...  I say we proclaim March the new evil month, february has nothing on March.  I've traveled 3 out of the 4 weeks in March just to sit in windowless rooms listening to topics that are abhoringly boring.  When I'm not traveling I'm trying to catch up on sleep, workout, stuff for myself but its hard when you have to work 70-80 hours a week.  I feel like I've been worn down like the dull pencil that you barely have enough left to hold onto and... Well  Jeez, a 9 oclock bedtime is sweet to me these days.  Ah well, its just another phase in life.  Let's hope I can make it out of this one with more wisdom then I entered it.  k.e.

      Me oh My if 3 day weekends don't rock,  I always took these for granted in grade school, snow days, presidents birthdays, days when the temperature was too hot or cold.  College cut down the number of days that we then got for free but we still had the summer.  Having a real job, it seems ridiculous the amount that people work.  Out of a whole year I get 12 holiday days, just 12.  Not having a summer vacation sucks.  I mean those 3 months were always a good time of relaxing and rejuventation.  One of my co-workers talks about how he has to pull all nighters and sleep at work sometimes.  Man, no job is that serious.  Real Life is hard, I guess just as hard as I make it...  Man traveling is hard, D.C. two weeks ago, last week, next week.  Life is good though, getting into summer and good weather has me up.  I am really looking forward to Bonnaroo.  If you are reading this and don't have a ticket, I probably have told you to get one, you really are missing out.  Bonnaroo is so many things to me that it represents a great time in so many ways.  Loving people, great music, fun and friends make Bonnaroo a stimulating environment.  It may sound like hippie drivel to some but don't judge if your too filled with reasons not to come.  I swear, if you come to Bonnaroo and don't have a good time I'll pay for your ticket.    I hope this message finds you in good humor and good health, talk you everyone soon.  Kitaroo!!!!

      On the road again....   D.C. is a rainy bastard right now.  I'm back in D.C. and the weather is like being inside a huge wet sock in the dryer, windy, wet, and shitty.  Man traveling is a pain sometimes.  I got sick from eating Taco Bell last night.  It's the first time the TB (taco bell or turkey bacon my fans?) has made me sick in my long career of eating Beebers, short for bean burritos. I am inclined to blame D.C. kn general as not to spoil the reputation.  I was in a conference today and was near the door during lunch.  I heard the following in a nearby office.  Keep in mind these were middle aged officeareans...  Lady: what the fuck? Guy: what's wrong? Lady: Damnit, they fuckin gave me bleu cheese dressing and I asked for honey mustard. Fuck! I can't believe it, well this just sucks, Damn I hate them.  This may not be funny now but at the moment it was hilarious.  I don't know if its an example of the drudgery of office life, the obesity trending in America, or growing rage that we can't have what we want right now!  Either way I'm done like a Whole cooked chicken stuffed with an onion and rubbed with mustard.  k.e.

      A little tired tonight.  I really like the teachings of Taoism.  Living in the moment and just being seem to fit me or at least appeal to me.  I will share this bit of wisdom from the Tao Te Ching, the handbook to Taoism...  This is the Way of Heaven...  Pacifying the agitated material soul and holding to oneness: Are you able to avoid separation? Focusing your energy on the release of tension: Can you be like an infant? In purifying your insight: Can you un-obstruct it? Loving the people and ruling the state: Can you avoid over-manipulation? In opening and closing the gate of Heaven: Can you be the female? In illuminating the whole universe: Can you be free of rationality?   k.e.

      Well sheeeyoot,  Some days you just feel fine, mighty fine.  It may be something about drinking martinis and listening to bluegrass but a fine summer day always brightens the spirits.  Being in town is suhweet.  Just hanging around on puffy clouds dancing with teddy bears.  My life has been filled with warm love and sunshine.  Days don't get much more lackadaisical.  Even at 11p.m. at night life seems to be bright.  Sometimes I just get the feeling that I can do anything.  I am facing a tough decision with my job since this traveling is slowly eating my soul like some kind of disease.  I dread facing it but at times I know everything will be alright.  Either way it's good to be alive and kicking.  I hope all my friends and family are having wonderful times in their lives and are not wasting a moment worrying or being sad sacks.  Let me know if you need help with this.  At the moment I am feeling the pull to be a lazy hippie especially strong.  Something about laying in a sunny field without a worry, swimmin huck finn style and livin off the land appeals to me.  Madison is a great town, rated #2 best town to live in by Men's Journal and countless other mags.  At times I just want to live deep in the woods and immerse myself in nature.  Some day it will happen, someday.  And when that day cometh, thou shalt be invited to visit the garden of kit.  And all shall come and flourish and live off the land.  So it was written thus...  k.e.

      Rockstar Yogurt...  So I am a bit hyped about bonnaroo if you haven't noticed.  I can see two reasons for this.  1. I know what a kick ass time it will be, free fun, mas drogas, musicas mas fina, and good over all people.  It is probably one of the funnest times I have ever had...Those of you not going, I'll send you some good concert vibes (its a hippie thing) 2  It will be a break from my job.  A pure heaven of sorts to not worry about work for a week plus.  Good times.  Life is grand otherwise.  Just living life one day at a time.  I'm home this week which is awesome, it gives me a chance to decompress.  Thats about all for now...I may see ya'll in chambana this weekend...we shall see.  k.e.

      Back again in D to the C,  It was a great day out again but as always I sat trapped in the 8-5 grind of meetings.  I made up for it though.  The hotel we stay at is on the University of Maryland campus so I spent a bit of the day touring.  It was perfect out, warm and clear, perfect for walking.  The quad and campus was beautiful.  Every building a clean brick with white columns emanating the east coast feel.  I forget how much I love to just explore and stroll peacefully.  Strolling and just taking in your surroundings is a great feeling, it makes me feel free of my worries and lets me enjoy life.  The campus reminded me a lot of Wash U in St. Louis.  The one thing that I didn't like is the campus was very congested, not a lot of room between buildings.  Well...I have more to write but I am trying to do this while watching t.v. (Aqua Teen Hunger Force) and despite my best efforts of re-writing sentences bed and t.v. are calling me.  So I bid thee adieu until morrow.  Call the drizzle if you need help...  k.e.

      Ahh,  another weekend half over as I sit up late wasting time on computers.  Life has been grand lately.  Had a bday, seen Pips over the weekend and generally had a great time just living life with Nats.  I have to say that I'm not where I thought I would be right now.  Working harder than I ever have seems oddly challenging and satisfying in a way even though I know it is slowly sucking my will to live.  So many people I work with are "Go-getters" the brightest and hard working of the bunch.  It makes life a living hell working with people who never slack off, it means I can't.  Bygones.  I know sometimes life is not the best it could be but by god I am happy to be alive and living free.  I am in debt, not happy with my job, and battling a cursed sore on my foot but huzzah happiness is a drug in itself.  I know life is so hard in so many different ways for people but living it the best I can is all I can do.  Man, we went down to ole Mifflin street for a Mad town block party today for pure craziness.  Met Pips and Mary down at a house party.  The block party was 3 blocks of house parties with 50k people crammed into the street and lawns drinking, hell it's probably still going on.  It baffles me how a regions attitudes can affect overarching attitudes.  This kind of thing would never go over in champaign.  I mean 50,000 people drinking in an insanely crowded area with cops?  People would be fighting and rioting in seconds, maybe its not bad as I think but Wisconsin seems to be made of a calmer brand of people who are more tolerant and liberal.  Sure cops were arresting people at the block party but in a calm fashion and not without due reason.  Cliche of the day: changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes.  Rock over Madison, where the mendota is so fine they named a lake after it.  k.e.

      Sunday at the Roo...  Allright all the last installment in my adventures at the Roo.  Sunday morning we all wake up wet and muddy from the night before in the Van.  The van stinks, bad.  2 days of wetness and no showers have made the boys a stinky bunch.  I however took advantage of the water spigots they've installed by giving myself a full soapdown, a greatly refreshing thing to bathe in ice cold water at 7am.  It is actually quite fun since everyone is out doing the same thing, kind of like a community watering hole.  (Exerpt from Thursday night: I forgot to mention one band worth mentioning. I forgot their name but they were 3 japanese guys who played crazy metal with silly slogans and dressed like an indian, power ranger, and something else...Medium Rare!)   So awake and with the ground still wet we hang around camp tearing down our beautiful home for the last 2 days so we are packed up and ready to leave.  I like to think of this day as THE LONGEST DAY EVER!  I started out seeing Leftover Salmon and then headed to the Bad Plus. They put on an amazing show.  Like many jazz bands they experiment with funky eclectic off beat beats. Their combination of piano, drums and bass is amazing as they have the edge of a rock band playing jazz instruments.  "Layin a Strip" and "Ironman" were just a few of the originals and covers that they pounded out.  After so much fun I took a break as the 3 days had worn me down a bit and my sunburn was still a painin me.  I shopped a little in centeroo and grabbed a seat under a grand old tree to listen to some Taj Mahal.  More break time as I knew I would be needing it for later, the long haul of David Byrne to Trey.  So in the mean time i caught SoulLive, Addison Groove Project, and Femi Kuti, all great artists that lended their unique sounds to the day at Bonnaroo.    So Cody and I (being the die hards we are) settled into a spot at the largest stage (what stage?) for some David Byrne.  Now David Byrne is a man to admire.  The lead singer for The Talking Heads his solo project are as experimental and eerily catchy as The Talking Heads he was a part of.  His stage presence was incredible as he appeared in a black jumpsuit and roused the crowd to a frenzy simply by walking backwards around the stage and hiding behind the drums section.  His collection of songs are so varied that I recommend anyone give him a try, you can find something you like.  So 2 1/2 hours later David Byrne ends and we get to move up 50 feet for a better view for Trey.    So waiting for Trey to come on and it starts pouring rain.  At first everyone is like "Wooooo, Yeaaaaah!" since it has been an obscenely hot day and the rain is nice but soon realize its not the best thing.  The rain continues to soak us and luckily a neighboring concertgoer lets us slip under his/her tarp to stay dry.  This is pure heaven compared to being rained on, the only drawback is "annoying girl" at the other edge of the tarp.  She must work to be annoying as her voice has the tinny twang.  Not only this but she uses the time that no band is playing to recite THE WHOLE MOVIE CLUELESS.  So now its around 9:00, we have been in the same place standing for 4 hours as the rain has made the ground a huge puddle that no one wants to sit in.  This is nearly unbearable as 3 days of concertgoing, standing around, sleeping little, and exhausting ourselves are forced (by our own keen need to see Trey up close) to stand until he plays his final note.   Trey Comes on!!! With a 64 piece orchestra.  Now this sounded a lot more impressive in the Bonnaroo Program.  Trey can definitely rock but after waiting for so many hours hearing a quiet, calm, subdued performance of barely recognizable phish songs is not what the crowd has been expecting.  To make matter worse annoying girl has taken it upon herself to yell "El Conductor" and "I love you Trey" at the top of her voice which is surprisingly louder than the orchestra.  At this point I consider turning around and venting on her but the Bonnaroo spirit takes over and I hold back.   Set Break, Trey has left the stage and leaves us to stand again with no chance of sitting for an hour.  Shortly after I devise a clever device of stacking my sandals and putting a newspaper on top of them so I can sit for 10 minutes and rest.  This keeps me nice and dry as the rain has stopped and the sandals elevate me (my butt at least) out of the 4 inch deep water that is surrounding everyone.  As Trey re-emerges from backstage people know that this will be a good show.  The crowd roars a dull roar and he picks up his guitar.  Trey plays the whole gamut of songs that I have grown to love.  From "push on to the day" to "night speaks to a woman" he rocks his songs like now one can.  The crowd is especially grateful as Trey has a horns section to help him play "Sultan's of Swing" and then rocks out to "Devil went down to Georgia".    This was the crowning moment of Bonnaroo and Trey put his heart into it.  Rocking crowd until they can take no more.  He finally ends at around 12:30, we have been standing for more than 7 hours in a 4 inch deep puddle of water and mud, we are wet, tired and happy.  We walk back and discuss departure plans.  All of us bent at the waist arms hanging down to stretch our backs we look like we dropped something but talk about when to leave.  We decide on tomorrow morning to avoid the lines.  Tomorrow morning comes too soon and we pack up and leave.  We now must forge rivers of mud that once were streets in our brave little minivan.  Cars around us splatter drops of mud as they spin their wheels helplessly.  We get to the end of the nearest line and begin the wait.  2 hours later we have moved, literally...5 feet.  This is driving me near insane as anyone who knows me knows I despise 2 things mistreatment of animals and traffic jams.  Half an hour later I can stands no more.  I scout out the situation.  Cars from our line and from our whole lot have only 1 exit and are not being let onto the exit road as the exit road line is not moving, at all.  I see an exit.  We get out of line and see at the far side of a neighboring lot an exit.   It is 2 extremely muddy roads and 2 sharp hills away.  So carefully I gun the engine and pick my way through the field at breakneck speeds, trusting a van with 200k miles to make it.  Luckily it does and after 2 more traffic jams we are on our way home.    Happy, dirty, and tired we leave Bonnaroo.  It was a great time and I can't wait for next year.  A place where people of all kinds come together and peacefully and joyously listen to music and share an experience for a couple of days.  Stay Tuned for Phish at Alpine Valley coming soon!  k.e.

      Saturday at Bonnaroo...  So early to bed early to rise, in Tennesee it gets to be around 100 degrees in your tent by 8 am meaning we all got up early after a long night.  Sitting around under a canopy with the breeze was a relief after the tent, though still around 85 degrees.  We sat around groggily for a couple hours trying to clear the mental fog.  To kick off the day I saw the Hackensaw Boys, Acoustic Syndicate, and Del McCoury band.  The Del McCoury band was great, a true southern bluegrass band down to their suits.    Since Cody and I had press passes we swung by the Press Tent to see Jim James (My Morning Jacket lead singer) for an acoustic set.  It was great since it was cool and air conditioned as well as being only one of about 25 people there.  After that we headed to see My Morning Jacket but being an old man of sorts I opted to lay in the shade rather than join the crowd up front.  Finishing at around 5ish we headed back to the campsite.  Dinner and the days stories were shared and rain started pounding.  Our shelter (see the pics!) held strong and we were kept fairly dry for the downpour.  This did cause us to miss Steve Winwood and the Dead becuase I was asleep in the van, not wanting to get wet.  When I was finally mustered we caught the second set of The Dead which was a great mix of solid classics and new jams.  They kept it more upbeat and the lack of crowd due to the rain made The Dead a great show compared to years past.    Wet and not to be dismayed we bounced between Primus and Ween only to settle on Robert Randolph and the Family Band.  Having seen them before they satisfied every expectation.  They put on a great, high energy show moving the crowd with their driving southern rock steel guitar beats.  When they signed off is was around 3:30 am.  Not to be stopped we headed to the Comedy tent to see 4 comedians who I totally cannot name at this time.  They were funny but what isn't at 4 in the morning.  Wet and tired we headed back to the Van for a dry sleep.  By the end of the night a couple things had happened.  Cody and I's sunburn from Friday had turned us into raging red tomatoes.  I played more of the red, burnt part hurting all over.  Cody having a previous tan browned up like a piece of old leather then commenced to peel leaving his forhead a mottled canvas of pink and brown.  The other result of the weather was mud.  More mud than I have ever seen before.  The campsites were fine because of grass and shelters but the main roads through the campsites and Centeroo were pits.  This meant that the whole time walking to and from shows (around a mile campsite to Centeroo) and the whole time watching shows you were ankle deep in Mud.  Not much you can do to get around mud but sink right in and enjoy the squish.  This led to multiple mud fights, mud wrestling, mud people, people falling in mud, splattering mud on others, and other mud related incidents.  After that I didn't think my feet would ever be clean again.  It would have ruined any other concert with any other fan base but the warm, happy feeling that was shared throughout Bonnaroo by all only embraced it and turned it into fun.  Sunday to come...  k.e.

      Home again jiggity jig!  Well, I'm back in Madison after a long deserved vacation.  It's good to be back home and it was great to see my parents and brother and get back to the home town for a bit.  Carbondale moves at a slower pace from the world around it, especially in the summer. The reality of no summer vacation and work is sinking in as my brother prepares for a summer of road trips and concerts.  I am happy that he is enjoying college life.  Now you say, how was Bonnaroo?  If you care to know read on, if not, this is your cue to stop...  Bonnaroo was awesome, again no complaints this year and the third time is a charm as Bonnaroo 2004 proved to be a great time.  We got there early Thursday during the day, My Bro, some friends and 90,000 people in a 500 acre field where stages and all sorts of contraptions were rigged for the pleasure of all.  Here is a day by day account of the times...  Thursday After setting up camp, which took reasonably long, we walked around and ended up checking out a couple bands.  We all took a nap in the movie tent since the movie "Miller's Crossing" did not hold any interest.  A long day of driving and early partying helped us to sleep for a full day.  I find out that my brother being the infinitely cool dude that he is got press passes since he writes for the Washington University Entertainment section and passed one along to me.   Friday By 8 am the heat from the sun in our tent had reached around 110 degrees making it impossible to sleep.  We all staggered out and sat in chairs under our gazebo waiting for the fog to clear.  After hearty breakfasts we started out full of hope and dreams for a great day.  The first half of the day held New Monsoon, YMSB, and Wilco, all of which rocked greatly.  The sun was relentless and despite Wilco's awesome performance I was forced to seek shade further from the stage as not to burn.  No hope, I ended up crips and peeling with the beginning stages of sun poisoning, the dreaded itching of Spring Break 2003 began to return.    In desperate need for shade and rest I returned to camp and stocked up on booze, food, smoke, and anything to ease the pain.  One thing about Bonnaroo, the heat of the day is so draining that drinking is nearly impossible, I think in my 3.5 days at Bonnaroo I drank a total of 15 beers, being a lightweight I am really no measure but heat definitely plays a factor.  It was on average 105 and sunny with little shade to be found.    Refreshed I headed back out to see String Cheese and Dave and Friends (Tim and Trey).  I have to say I was hesitant about the Dave and Friends as Bonnaroo is a pure festival and the fact that such a mainstream band was there got under my skin.  I think it was actually one of the best shows of the concert.  Dave and Trey and Tim took turns with each of their respective songs and rocked the crowd with Dave's distinctive voice and songwriting, Trey's intense solo's, and Tim's impressive acoustic work.  It was perfect.  I regret not staying for the second set.  At the break my bro and I left for the Bonnaroo parade which is a great event, after suiting up (me in my grass skirt and coconut bra and bro in a tie dye diaper) we headed to the parade meeting ground.  A half hour later we left dissappointed as the parade never came. Drat!    Bummed but ready for me we headed to Umphrey's Mcgee for the 12-3am show.  Now I had help from some fungi friends and was feeling mighty fine.  I have never been a huge Umphrey's fan but it could be that I never gave them a chance.  They rocked and we danced like two dirty carbondalians only can.  Their pounding rhythms building on one another whipped the crowd into a frenzy.  There sound was awesome, somewhere in between jam, rock, and a progressive rock sound that gives them an intense driving sound, as if they were always on the verge of a songs climax.  Anyway...Frazzled and tired we walked around Centeroo, I stopping to swing and take in the glory of Bonnaroo.    Stay tuned for my Saturday and Sunday Bonnaroo Adventures coming soon!  k.e.

      Summer!,  The winter has finally broken in the Great North!  But really, until now it has been some shitty weather.  Last week it was rain and clouds constantly.  Sunny and in the 80's is heralding in Summer here in Mad-Town.  I can't wait for the activities to start, beer at the terrace, hiking, all your great outdoor activities.  The weirdest thing to get used to is not having a summer vacation.  Being in school it was always something you looked forward to.  A breaking point where you could catch your breath until the next school year.  Now there is no breaks, besides a measely 2 vacation weeks a year I have nothing to show for vacation.  I think that fact that people are given so little time to enjoy time off is a travesty.  It shows what achievement driven, capitalistic workaholics we are.  Well...Hopefully soon I will be unemployed and poor again!    T Minus 2 days to Bonnaroo.  I think my head is going to burst with excitement.  One of the few vacations I am taking is to this 3 day, 90,000 person music festival.  I wish everyone could experience it just because it is such a huge departure from normal life.  Not to sound idealistic, and a concert is no ideal but I think the sentiments behind Bonnaroo come very close to what our society should strive to.  Drugs and Jam Bands you say?  No, here is a taste of what I mean.    At Bonnaroo you forget something, anything, all you have to do is ask the people you are camping next to and they gladly share.  People leave all belongings ungaurded in lockless tents, trusting the "dirtiest" grungy people to not steal.  Creativity is promoted and rewarded, and no one is judged for who they are or what they like, wear, or look like.  It is a community that embraces love, sharing, peace, and fun.  Sure it has faults but I think the world could learn a thing or two from the Roo.  Kitaroo

      10 hours later...   Well its been a while since I talked with everyone,&nbsp; I hope your lives are going well!&nbsp; Anyway, a couple work weeks and trips to D.C. later Natalie and I are sitting comparably in Destin, FL. patting our full bellies after a delicious Back Porch meal of seafood gumbo and blackened amberjack.&nbsp; The weather has been great so far, warm air and salty breezes have caressed the white sands.&nbsp;   I am so happy to be on vacation, being so grown up and having only 2 free weeks a year you have to spend it wisely.&nbsp; I'm surely sure that I can find enough great things to do to fill a week at the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan on coming back fully tan and burnt.&nbsp; Either way I guarantee&nbsp;that raw sand in the crotch good time.&nbsp; &nbsp;See you all at the beach, enjoy the show!  k.e.

      Groovin on Up!  Well, time passed quickly the couple days between Bonnaroo and Phish.  Learning that Phish was breaking up was a shock but understandable.  I was just glad that I had the chance to see them on their farewell tour.  The first night of phish I rushed out of work to meet Cody and Dan at Alpine Valley.  Eager to get there early I was comforted by the fact that I only had an hour drive and we had pavillion seats so worst was we squeeze in late.  It turned out I met them right on and we grooved into the venue.  People poured in to the place from all orifices.  Now I had only been to Alpine once before and it was long ago for a band (Pearl Jam) much too far from my liking to count.  Alpine Valley is your typical outside venue, almost.  Covered seats surrounded by the "lawn".  Maybe it's Wisconsin but the pavillion seemed homier and the lawn greener with the lush countryside surrounding the backdrop of the stage.    We reached out seats and were pleasantly surprised as we had close, unobstructed view of the stage.  Phish came on and rocked it well.  Playing a great mix of the old stuff, the, great stuff in the middle, and brand spankin new they tore it down.  They were a little off but their jams and musical transitions were right on.  It was a great night.  A 10 minute lyrical jam was equally freaky and cool, tripping out the straightest of arrows.  Even the frat guy in front of us who kept turning around and pumping his fist in the air was cool for a night.  Wanting to be home ASAP we ran the whole way back.  Cody and I darting playfully in the crowd and whooping it up.  Dan "the camel" loped on doggedly behind.  Tired and ready for bed we drove home.  Grateful for getting to see Phish.  The second night of Phish was equally as awesome.  It was great to have Cody and Dan up for a round of the old frolf.  We had time to prepare and made it to the show with time to spare.  Dan still not having a ticket was preoccupied with finding one.  We zoomed down the highway until we entered the line of cars to the interstate exit.  Dan crafted a "need 1 tix" sign and grimly hopeful put it in the car window.  Miles later, next to a mercedes some guys sold him a ticket for $60 bucks.  He was a happy man.  Happy and then excstatic.  As we neared the venue we saw more and more desperate people offering to buy tickets.  Offering hundred dollar bills and begging each car for a ticket.  No one had anything to offer, Dan was a lucky man.  Inside we took up residence on a patch of lawn as we had no assigned seats.    Now if you have never been to Alpine Valley it is steep.  The steepness that would invite sledders in the winter and trick tipsy people into landing on their butts.  We spreaded out happily and waited.  Phish came out, rocked it hard.  They again had amazing transitions from song to song that hyped the crowd into a frenzy.    At set break Cody and I broke for the B-rooms to relieve the pressure.  The lawn was insanely packed.  No room to move and people tighter that relatives.  This prompted us to create what we dubbed "jukin and jivin".  A half run half jumping lilting movement that propelled us through the crowd at amazing speed.  We threaded needles and split gaps, finding the hidden maze among the crowd that was constantly moving.  I don't know if it was skill or the fact that we freaked everyone out but we made great time.  Second Set Phish again rocked.  Nothing more to say.  Exhausted and ready to go we left after their last song. In the car and ready to go we contemplated our situation.  The parking attendants at these events are clear experts.  High schoolers with budding facial hair, the kid in our lot seemed to have lost his drive for order and parked us 7 cars deep with another 20 or so in front of us.  This doesn't seem a problem but HE WASN"T ALLOWING ROOM FOR ANY ROWS.  Meaning we were near the middle of 25 solid cars.  Idiot.  Back at our car we waited for a path to clear.  No sign of freedom in sight we dranks beers and walked to Shakedown.  Checking the scene we bought drinks and hung in the crowd.  Watching security trying to bust people setting off fireworks in vain.  an hour later we returned to the car to find a path cleared.  We were free!  Not quite so.  We moved out of the mass of cars to find ourselves in another line of cars waiting to exit...An hour later and we had moved around 100 feet.  Tired and wanting beds the line moved slowly until we reached the exit.  The highlight of the exit was this exchange of a girl (clearly drunk) selling gooballs:  Girl:  Gooballs for sale! Dan: Hey! Girl: You want one? Dan: Yeah! (She approaches the car dancing with a basket under her arm. Dan: I just need one. Girl: 1 for 5, 5 for 20. Dan: All I have is a 20 can you give me change. (at this point she hands Dan one and say she has no change) Me: Hey we have some ones, here you go. (Cody and I muster 5 ones and hand them to her. Girl: Cool, here you go (hands us another and dances to the car behind us.  We sit bewildered, obviously not going to care we munch happily on our sweet treats and slowly make our way home.  2 hours later we are home and crash.  It was awesome to see Phish before they break up and see my bro and get away from work.  k.e.

      We woke early a few of the days in Destin,  Walking down to the beach and taking in the morning hours of civil twilight the world was quiet. The beach empty I lay down, last nights drinks still swam in my head. The freedom of being away from it all is intoxicating. Having no obligations and living in your own world.  The morning light washed over the sea, not a beautiful sunrise but one of thousands I will experience.   k.e.
