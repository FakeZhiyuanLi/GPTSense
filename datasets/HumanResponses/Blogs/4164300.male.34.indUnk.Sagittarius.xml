       Jan Turkenburg's  urlLink  52 weeks   project ("every week in 2004 there will be a link to a page with recordings which are not available in the shop and preferably introduced by the artist him/her/themselve") is now on week 35.        " The following tracks are taken from " urlLink  ABBA voor kinderen  " (Abba for kids) from 1981, performed by a Children's choir in Leiden. The dutch lyrics are by Pieter Goemans, who has written a lot of commercial children lyrics, but these are not his best ones, just like the accompaniment and the singing isn't really outstanding, but at least they didn't let half naked little girls sing "gimme gimme gime a man after midnight", like the Mini pops. Goemans let them sing things like "Look, there's the little gnome" and "Won't you come to my birthday party?". From the liner notes we can only learn that the idea for this album came from Cees Kerkhof, the sleeve was designed by Jan van Uden and Frederico (F. Balke) made the illustrations ." and further on: " This week's record was badly damaged and three of the songs I couldn't repair acceptably. So here are two consolation tracks in the same genre, taken from the very limited release CD "Mijn oom is een dinosaurus" (My uncle is a dinosaur), which I recorded especially for two small family members ."   urlLink   ABBA Voor Kinderen     urlLink   http://www.meneerjan.schoolreference.com/35/52.35.html          / urlLink Z

       In  urlLink  The Morning News  : "America lost two great artists this week, musician  urlLink  Rick James   and actress  urlLink  Fay Wray  .

[A year passes.]    FAY :  But yes, it was wonderful. That film changed my life. It changed history.     RICK :  OK.     FAY :  And what was your song? “Superman”?     RICK :  Freak. “Super Freak.”     FAY :  Like circuses? Freaks?     RICK :  Oh! No. No no. It’s…it’s not like that at all. It was like, you know, sex.     FAY :  I see. Well. Excuse me.   ...

         This great girl was born only 5 minutes (by bike) away from where I'm sitting right now! Ok. She hasn't been home for a long time.    She is quite a woman - classy with great taste (" urlLink   Ekberg is a favourite with the slander press, rumoured affairs with Yul Brynner, Frank Sinatra, Errol Flynn and Robert Mitchum fill their columns in '52 and '53   .") and a mind and mouth of her own.

          urlLink  Don Miller   at  urlLink  balansamba.com   sais this about the site's newest featured album: " Like  urlLink  Sergio Mendes   and many others, Tamba Trio got started at Bottle's Bar on Beco das Garrafas in the Copacabana district of Rio during the early 1960's. The trio consisted of Luiz Eca, Helcio Millito, and Bebeto. Avanço is their second album, and one of my favorites. The album conists of mostly covers by  urlLink  Tom Jobim  ,  urlLink  Roberto Menescal  , and  urlLink  Marcos Valle  . There is also a great cover of  urlLink  Jorge Ben   's  famous Mas Que Nada. The vocals sound very similar to MPB4's harmonic style. Avanço provides light, jazzy renderings of some classic bossa nova tunes. Enjoy!"    urlLink   Tamba Trio - Avanço       urlLink   http://www.balansamba.com/album3.html          / urlLink Z

         Sweden IS   urlLink  big booped blondes   ,   urlLink  Ingmar Bergman    and tons of   urlLink  Smörgåsbord   .   It is also full of people (like me) who'll never even get close to one of those vixens, don't care about Ingmar Bergman and is always too drunk to appreciate a "smörgåsbord".   Some of us are pleased with just the subliminal things in life.   Here are some clips of some   urlLink  subliminal sounds    from Sweden:   urlLink  Åke Sandin    and   urlLink  Tom Zacharias    is Sweden too!

        "She's performing at a rock festival in the former Roman settlement of Avenches in Switzerland, playing to a half-full, ancient amphitheatre as a warm-up act for  urlLink  Lou Reed   and German punk diva  urlLink  Nina Hagen  . She plays a set of  urlLink  Serge  's songs, scored to Arab-influenced music. For all its eccentricity, it's a beautiful concert and one she has been touring with for a couple of years.

       urlLink  Tod Browning   ; the director of such classics as '  urlLink  Dracula  '  (1931) and '  urlLink  Freaks   ' (1932) also made some other really interesting and frightening movies.   urlLink   Here's a page     displaying some of the posters, lobby cards and film stills from some of his films. As you can tell by reading the posters one of his favorite actors must have been   urlLink  Lon      urlLink  Chaney   . Lon was "  urlLink  the man of thousand faces   ". If he had been hired for The 'Freaks' he surely could have played siamese twins or a legless freak. But Browning wanted the   urlLink  real stuff   . And real it is... SUR-REAL!

        "Almost nothing is known about the mysterious 60's record label  urlLink  Camp Records  . They released an album and 10 45 rpm records of gay parody songs, most done with effeminate voices. I believe they were issued in the early 60's, as they all appeared in an ad in the gay magazine  urlLink  Vagabond  , dated 1965. The address  on the album record jacket was PO Box 3213, Hollywood, California, and it   credited all selections to "Different Music Co, Hollywood.     ""     urlLink  Read   more,  urlLink  see   more and  listen  (a lot of  urlLink  gay   music to stream)!   All this is being brought to our attention by  JD Doyle  at  urlLink  Queer Music Heritage  .     urlLink  http://www.queermusicheritage.com/camp.html        / urlLink Z

       Well... I've changed the template for this blog a little bit. I think it looks better now.      Yesterday we talked about  urlLink  'Rowdy' Roddy Piper  . It looks like he  urlLink  acted   in quite a few films! But a big part is of course movies where he was typecasted just because of his  urlLink  wrestling fame  . And, no, he wasn't scottish. But it's easy to be mislead to think so hearing the music and seeing  urlLink  Roddy in kilt   with bagpipes  .  urlLink  This   is more like it! And don't forget to listen to the famous sampled 'bubble gum' quote at  urlLink  this page   (scroll down a tiny little bit... there... on the left. Oh, you found it!).     urlLink   http://members.tripod.com/~retro4/rodtrib.html          / urlLink Z

       Ok...If you are about 40-50 years old (and spent the late 70s and beginning of the 80s digging and dancing to the productions of  urlLink  Donna Summer  ,  urlLink  ABBA   ,  or if you were very lucky:  urlLink  E.L.O.  ) you know all about this. But for those of you uninformed this might be a turn on:  "Surely you've thumbed through a high school yearbook from the late 70's and early 80's and you've found photo after photo of women wearing feathered hair modeled after the wild, tossled, flipped-back, golden tresses of  Farrah Fawcett . Yes, it’s true that many women went into hair salons between 1976 and 1983 asking for the “Farrah” look, but is this what they actually came out with? The answer is yes for some, but for many the answer is no, no, no, no, no. You see, many actually came out with “   urlLink   The Bertinelli     ”. Haven't heard of that one, have you? Well then, what is The Bertinelli"? It's simple; you cross the Dorothy Hamill (short hair, but flat on top and center-parted) with "   urlLink   The Farrah     ".    This and much more will be spotlighted and told about the fashion of the feathered back hair at   urlLink  The Feathered Back Hair Site    (via   urlLink  grow-a-brain   )         urlLink   http://www.featheredback.com/                            / urlLink Z

       My name is Sebastian and I run a  Yahoo! Group  named    urlLink  Pop Culture Links       which partly is a directory of pop cultural links - partly a forum where I and my fellow members posts links to and discuss everything pop  cultural.     You can check out all the collected links at the group   urlLink here!   (You don't have to be a member to get your hands on them.)       This is my second try blogging. Let's see what happens...
