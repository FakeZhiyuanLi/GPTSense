						   Right now I am in Warner Robins, a town known for its Air Force base, kick hash football team and loser marching band. I am down here till Thursday afternoon with the Hunts to help Mr. Hunt run the food pantry at his church for BETA summer hours. I am going to be rolling in hours if he remembers to count them all up before he writes them on the form that I have to turn in. It was a good night. I got in town around five-ish and Mom and Mike hung around and then  finally  left. Then I decided to go to the Sunday night worship service at their church. Mrs. Hunt plays the organ by the way. I found out there were going to be a lot of youth there too because it was Youth Sunday or something. I felt  really  bad though because they were so nice to me and invited me to come play volleyball and watch  Drumline  with em and I was sort being forced to leave instead of go and hang with them. I mean not forced in anyway I just felt that I should have left and went with the Hunt's to dinner instead of staying but now I am regretting the fact that I didn't stay. (That last compound sentence made no since.) Oh well right? Maybe I will get to see them and apologize for not going. I meet this really kick hash kid named Joey who plays the guitar. Well, he seemed really cool anyways man although I didn't get to chat to much. Anyways. I meet his mom and she noticed that I was wearing my shirt that I bought from the Matchbox Twenty concert Saturday night and she walked over to me and Mr. Hunt and was  very  nice. She said something like her son, Joey, meet Rob Thomas, the lead singer of Matchbox Twenty, at a wedding and Rob drug him all around the reception saying that he was his little bro or something. I think that was the story but I might have told it wrong. A lot of hot chicks in the youth group man. One girl caught my eye and man was she fine. Nice, nice, hash. Perfect. Five stars. Perfect ten. How many times have I said the word 'hash' in this post? I know all of you marching folks know what that word means but do the rest of you know? Leave me a comment. Okay. Now, before I go. I find it sort of funny that I am typing this, about to post it, but none of you can read it because I have yet to launch my updated site. When you see this message you will know that it is nothing major, just updated, I'm using Blogger now, and it is a heck of a whole lot cleaner looking. I hope I get to see that hash again. Maybe I can get her to visit my site. 'Chicks dig a dude w/ his own domain.' I was going to use that as my quote but I had to pass. I might revisit the idea later though right dude? Cheers mate!

						    The Matchbox Twenty concert was last night and it was incredible! When it was over I found myself at a loss for words because it was so mind-blowing. The coolest thing was the fact that they were recording the concert to make a dvd! So Liz and I are going to be the first two in line to buy the dvd and we'll watch it and be like 'remember that?' and 'that was awesome!' You have no idea how incredible it was. They sang all the best songs. The best song with the lights and the screens and such was  Downfall . All of it was kick hash but that one stood out a tiny bit more than the others. I sang along to every single one of them, had the lady standing next to me cracking up because she couldn't believe that I knew all the songs by heart. The seats were awesome. The opening bands were awesome. (American Hi-Fi and Sugar Ray.) They sang my favorite song that they recorded. I bought a spiffy brown t-shirt. What a great f'n night! Oh yeah- The picture over there on the left is from Chicago not their concert last night in Atlanta. I was looking at other pictures from their other shows and all of those shows had the same set on stage but last night the set didn't really look anything like the set I saw in the pictures. Maybe it was because of the dvd but it seemed more intimate last night and more lights and more effects and stuff. Here I go again! lol

						   I just got my pictures back from band camp and the pictures stink. My finger is in half of them and the other half are just bad. I might put some of them up but don't get your hopes up to much. Everyone having a good last week of summer? I'm bored as crazy and wish I had something to do, or friends old enough to drive somewhere. My website is a year old now. The day was July eleventh or something and I just forgot about it. Where did this past year go?  Life  flies by doesn't it? Live for the moment and have no regrets guys! Everyone should slow down at least a moment during the day and take it all in; everything God has put on this Earth for use to experience daily. What a great thing He has created.

						   I am so bored. I want to go do something with some people or something. I'm sick of reading summer reading crap. Did I mention I'm bored? Just in case I didn't- I'm bored. Nobody worth talking to is online at the moment either. *yawn

						   I'm back in town after a great week at band camp. I meant to post something while I was gone but every time that I had a chance to post I was to wound up to put all my thoughts together into a post.
 
Band camp was incredible. There was no way that I could have imagined it to be as great as it was. I made a crap load of new friends, built stronger bonds with older friends, and found out that I don't need to deal with some of the stupidity from some of the people I use to call 'friends'. While I did all this I had a great time. So much to talk about but hard to put in words man but I will give it a shot...
 
The trumpet section this year kicks butt. Sectionals were awesome. Swig, the trumpet instructor, was constructive to everyone as far as I'm concerned. I wish we could have had more sectionals this year but it seemed like we spent more time on the field then any other year. That was great but the music is as important in the individual sections just as much as the over all look of the band to me.
 
The music is growing on me. I wasn't sure if I was going to even like it when we first got it but playing it for two weeks and having all of it memorized except for a couple of difficult measures it isn't as gay as I thought it was. The show is hard. It isn't impossible but it isn't easy either. I love it though because of how different it is compared to the past two year's shows. As long as Sara stands back and yells at me during the show to move over and such because I can't see behind me, it will be great. ;-) Let me continue rambling... 
The talent show was an experience. The highlight of the night has to be the golf ball Andrew sent flying into one of the over head lights in the lecture hall during the talent show. It was one of those moments that is hard to describe unless you were there to experience it. He was doing tricks with golf balls and a club and one of the last tricks he did was bounce the ball up in the air and hit it into the crowd. Well when he did that it went a little high and went straight into a glass over head light thing sending shattered glass cascading down all over Shannon and Tim about five feet away from me. I was worried about Shannon because she was pretty shaken up about it but she was okay. All the acts at the talent show were really good. There were seventeen to be exact, I think. Michelle and Bri and the other two girls that were with them were great. They did like a little skit thing to the song 'You Can't Hurry Love' and it was good. I was surprised by two of the performers- Irby and Stephan. Those two guys can sing man. Who would have guessed Irby could sing like he did!? That was great. The song that Collen sang for Ashley was awesome. The 'Intermission' that Mrs. Mann, my fourth period teacher for next school year!, put together that surprised Mr. Mac and Mr. Sanders was funny. 'I always knew my drum stick was bigger... yeah, but mine has fur.' I was rollin by then because It was so dang lame but it was still pretty funny. I could have gone without seeing Mr. Mac shoving that Fourth of July thing up his crack though. I wish I could remember everything from the talent show and who did what but I can't. Everyone was great and I hope next year's is as entertaining as this year's was. 
The luau was fun. Not much to talk about it though. We have a very attractive marching band when everyone is dressed up. lol The dance was 'off the chain.' (That quote is dedicated to the marching freshman class.) I was more sore after the dance then I was all week. It was so much fun. When everyone got in a circle and different people would get in the middle and do stuff, that was the best. Saye did the little disco thing with Jay and that was awesome. Shaun jumped in and started messing around. It was cool but bitter sweet. When they had the senior dance, that was when it got sort of depressing. It finally hit that it was our last night at band camp together as a group and it was sad. lol :fart: The food sucked. I didn't eat to much of it but from what I did eat of it I can tell you that it sucked. They are redoing the food services building and turning it into one of those high tech campus meeting places like they have at Emory for those of you who have seen Emory's food quart. Since they were redoing the food thing they didn't have any choices as to what to eat and the soda always tasted funny but it was band camp so it was all good. I have to do a shout out list now so hang tight- Michelle, Liz, Kourtney, William (watch out for the attacking Scrabble letters), Heather, Aaron, Steph, Elizabeth, I hate listing people because I always forget someone important that is really cool and I should remember but can't, the coolest group of people in the marching band, the trumpet section, Craig, Jay, Ryan, Alex, Stephan H., Stephan S., David, Sara, Jasmine, Justin, Corey, Adam, Anthony D., Shaun, Blake, and our instructor *Swyg. (*Correction for Dave! lol) And last and least, the two people that made me angry in five minute intervals Anthony W. and Starr. Let me know if I forgot anyone. I know some of the freshman and rookies I forgot to put up here because I am terrible with names so just let me know. I just took my camera to get it developed so I should have some pics of something up here soon. I know that they have some pics from camp at the  urlLink band website . You can see the dorms we stayed in the past two years  urlLink right here  as-well. That picture on the page for the dorm is a picture of where we have our luau Wednesday night. Taking pictures for me at band camp is annoying to me. Band camp is so great that trying to capture moments is hard. I could have easily stayed another week hands down if I could have done laundry and everyone stayed with me. I honeslty had nothing to complain about. It's band camp! Why complain about anything? It is a thing you only get to experience as a student, if all goes well, four times in your life and it goes by so fast. Well, I'm getting tired of being online all the time so I am leaving as soon as I finish this conversation with one of the coolest people I have  ever  meet. No joke and I don't think they know it either. Peace.

						   Move in day is tomorrow for BAND CAMP! The week we have all been waiting for has   finally   arrived. I have been talking to Kourtney and Liz, who are already there on campus because Kourtney's mom is a chaperone and Liz is a section leader, and they are all revved up. They are entering the room decorating contest thing and from the sound of it it seems like it is pretty awesome. I found out my room number from Liz who was bored so she went to look for me and I think I remember exactly where the room is. She was counting the doors and such and telling me in relation to the room I was in last year. It seems like we are surrounded by freshmen, not always a negative thing and it also seems like we are around chaperones which sort of sucks. If Sarah had anything to do with where I'm at! lol It should be gravy though. I have been driving a lot in the past two days. I drove all the way to Tanger today, down 1-55 to avoid the highway for a little while. It was pretty awesome I gotta say. I have driven just about everywhere we have gone but there are still some rocky moments like when I had to cross over two lanes of traffic to get into the turn lane to turn in somewhere. I wasn't ready for that at all, but we all survived so it wasn't to bad. I'm rambling... I haven't even started packing for camp yet to be honest. I will in the morning. Just have to throw some clothes together and my bathroom stuff and my instrument and my laptop and my reading for school and some magazines and well maybe I should pack some. There is more to pack then I thought. Oh yeah, tv too. Band camp is about having a good time,  making some new friends , playing with  LOTS OF AIR  during sectionals, well, really all the time for that matter, and just having a good time. I said having a good time twice so I am going to make it my personal mission to make sure everyone is having a good time. lol Like I said before, I am taking my computer so expect some posts through out the week. One of my plans of taking pictures during the day and uploading them at night feel  way  through so I was very disappointed about that so I am going to take a disposable camera and hope that I get some decent pics to put up on my site. It really sucks though but I guess I will just have to understand the situation (which I don't in anyway) and just go and have a kick ass time like I am going to do. Okay, enough is enough. I am talking around in circles but one more thing. I want to send out an honest thank you to the person that helped me with money while I went clothes shopping today. I bought a bunch of new digs and I can't wait to wear them. I  hate  shopping but I love spending money so go figure. On my next post I will be reporting from BAND CAMP! Cheers!

						   Pre-band camp for this season in marching band began on Monday. So far, so good. No complaints except most of the third trumpets won't play anything and when they do it isn't very loud, so, Anthony and I, well, more myself, have to blast to compensate for the rest of them but at the same time it has encouraged me to practice a bunch which is always a good thing. It's going to be interesting at band camp during sectionals but it is going to be sweet regardless of whatever might happen.  The over all mood this year seems really mellow. Maybe it's just me but it seems calm. I think the outrages number of freshman and over all rookies have something to do with that. The music is pretty different from the past two years but it is pretty easy. Memorizing it shouldn't be a problem either. I'm first chair third trumpet, something I think I forgot to mention in the first paragraph. Our section leaders kick hash. (Craig, Jay, and Ryan.) The trumpet section is kicking hash. I pissed off Sara the second day, lol, but other then that everything is falling together nicely as far as I'm concerned. We have two songs played all the way through. Nobody knows exactly how many songs we are playing this year so it might be four like usual or it might only be three this year. Time will tell. I was a little worried Monday and Tuesday when a handful of people weren't there because of a church camp but yesterday we had a full house and it was sweet, or shall I say  'Cool' ? That was gay but I don't think anyone would understand it unless they are marchers anyways. Well, I don't have much to say. Looking forward to practice again today, not so much the meeting about band camp next week though. All the stuff is probably going to be the same old same old but you never know. Cheers!

						   I aced the learner's test today, so I have my learner's license  finally ! On the first part, the driving laws section, out of twenty questions I answered eighteen questions right and on the road signs section, out of twenty question I answered nineteen questions right. So I got a 90 and a 95 which the lady at the desk that Mom is friends with because she works upstairs and knows everyone said that that was great so I was happy. Then I had to stand in the line and get my picture and stuff entered into the computer. The picture is aight I guess. Are license pictures ever good though? Mom let me drive down the street to Dottie's house to meet up with Robin and the girls since they are back in town. It was odd I must say. She said I'll get to drive more once I'm use to the size of the vehicle. Good day. Got my learner's, got more Starbucks, went to Old Navy, CompUsa, the Atlanta Bread Company, Petsmart, and Publix to go shopping for some food. Then, spent quite a long time at Dottie's place on the boat and swimming. Good times not much to talk about so later peeps!

						   So I went to Super Target and went to the Starbucks to get a venti caramel macchiato like I do every Friday night from the same ladies and I ended up staying longer then I expected. Dottie took me because big Mike is out of town and mom had to come home to work on something for work. Dottie had to get somethings so we walked around and bought some stuff and I ran into a handful of people. First, right after I got my coffee I had to take a leak and as I was walking into the bathroom I ran into Coach Kincaid. Took care of business and left and started walking around. A little later, after running into Coach numerous more times, I was looking at stuff that you put in your dorm room and Sarah walked by. I said, really loud 'Hey look it's Sarah!' I guess she didn't hear me because she kept walking. I poked my head out from the isle I was standing in and yelled 'Watch out for Coach Kincaid, Sarah!' She growled, lol, and kept walking with her infamous cell phone in her hand. I think she thinks I am obsessed with her or I'm a stacker. I'm not! Just want to be friends with everyone! heh If running into Sarah wasn't enough, we got in the checkout line and Sarah's sister was walking by and she was talking to Sarah on her cell phone. Then I turned and saw, I think it was, Sarah's mother then I turned again and spotted a girl named Christy walking out of the store. I couldn't remember her name until later so I didn't yell it out or anything. Then leaving the checkout lane I think I spotted one of the Holt twins. Then it got a little creepy seeing everyone and we left. Oh yeah, we almost ran out of gas on the way to her dropping me off at my house. We got gas so it was all good. So that's all I have to say. lol I pre-ordered the new John Mayer cd today too! Can't wait to get it! I have a countdown already counting down to the September 9 release date. I bought the 'bundle package' so I get a cool t-shirt with it when it comes. Good stuff. It was a good day. Cleaned my room, ordered the cd I was just talking about, went to Starbucks, the only thing that wasn't good was Sarah not noticing me. This is going to sound lame but why can't everyone see that I'm a cool kid worth hanging out with? lol I'll leave you with that I guess. G-day mate!

						   *Slamming my hand down on the desk due to the fact that I got kicked off line only to slam it again because it was the second time that it has happened and the second time 'Out of Area' has appeared on the caller id. Mike: Hello. 
Caller: Hi sir, this is Christina and I am calling on behalf of DishTV; how are you doing today? 
Mike: Good and how about yourself? 
Christina, formally known as 'Caller': Wonderful, thanks for asking. I have a simple question for you today sir. 
Mike: Yes? 
Christina: Do you have cable television? 
Mike: Yes I do and I am satisfied with it thank you and have a great day. 
Christina: (desperately sounding) But what if I can save you money? 
*click I just find these sort of in-depth conversations with tele-marketers trying to 'save you money' sad. Find a better job and let your number show through on the caller id for goodness sake! She was so nice up until 'the question.' Just thought I would share with you. lol

						   Where shall I begin? So much stuff to talk about. Tonight was a little depressing. The same kick hash youth at the church invited me to go with them to a place called Starcadia in Macon tonight and I was siked about it, really truly because I didn't get to go with them Sunday. Well, I was busy with stuff at the time and didn't get details like time or anything and they left before I had a chance to say goodbye. (This is sounding a little petty but I really feel bad about it. 8-)) Well, we came back to the house and I fell asleep in the chair. I awoke around quarter till six and we ate because Mrs. Hunt had to go to choir practice and then we finished around six-thirty and I  then  started worrying about the time. I thought, seven, maybe, so we drove to the church and they were already gone and then we found the time and it was six. So I was screwed and really pissed. I plan on trying to get a hold of Joey tomorrow and tell him what happened because it sucks dude! What happened Monday? Well, not much, but quite a bit. A job that should have taken a mer thirty minutes took three hours. Doing the inventory for the food pantry is a royal pain in the ass, but it is pretty fun. Strange, I know, but it is all numbers and counting boxes and rearranging stuff. Mr. Hunt had some sort of meeting that night so Mrs. Hunt treated me to dinner at the local Long John Silver's. I have never been to a Long John Silver's and I don't think I will ever go again. lol It was an experience and I will leave it at that. The idea was for her to feed me something other then turkey or chicken and when I arrived I decided to get chicken. I had one to many hush puppies and what seemed like every hour I was making a pit stop to the crappier. Then we ran, well drove to JC Penny to place an order for some curtains I believe then we went back to the house and awaited Mr. Hunts arrival. Tuesday was little bit calmer. We woke up and drove to the church to stalk the shelves to get ready for the clients to come to the food pantry to pick up their food that afternoon. That was easy. I listened to Switchfoot blasting from the cd player across the room. It was a rainy day and we didn't think that we were going to have a big crowd so we didn't make up to many sacks ahead of time. We ate Subway, my favorite place besides the Atlanta Bread Company. That was just a useless bit of information for you. Bare with me it's been a long couple of days. Heh. Arrived back at the food pantry in rain. Quickly got re-accounted (sp?) with my favorite group of works at the food panty, and then I became a floater like I always do during the two hours from two to four. When I say I was a floater I mean that I wander around, rearrange stuff in the closet, file folders, carry out stuff, (in the pouring rain which was tight) fell out of my flip-flops, wait that wasn't... um, put together a thing called SNAP bags, talked about my 'Portfolio of Poems' that I made for english class this past year and brought to show Mr. Hunt which he, in turn, took to show one of the top former english teachers in Houston County and she praised it and that felt great, found a lost Mr. Hunt lol, yeah, I was a floater for two hours man. Later that night Mr. Hunt took me to his meeting and then took me for some of the best coffee I have ever had which you can read about in the post from early this morning below. Today, was one of those days. I woke up, hopped in the shower realizing something that I will not say for the world to see but you can IM me and I might tell you, and while in the shower I became an ice cube. Someone in the house (*cough, cough, Mr. Hunt) kept turning on the water in the sinks around the house and made the water in the shower ice cold. I had shampoo in my hair and it went ice cold and I had to trip over myself to move out of the way so I wouldn't get hypothermia. That would be sweet- 'Mike Sheddan, First man to ever get hypothermia while taking a shower.' Got done, went to Kroger to pick up the bread and 'sweets' for the food pantry, brought them to the church, stored them, and then went to the Waffle House. Hate the Waffle House. Hate it, but one of the only decent things about it was that no one around us was smoking a cancer stick. Went to the house and waited till around noon to go back to the church and get in the van to go to the big kahuna food bank in Macon. Filled up the vans with food for the food pantry. I will spear you the boring details of what happened because frankly I might fall asleep if I thought about them again. Demanded to go to  urlLink Joshua Cup  again which was within walking distance of where we were in Macon. We went and I tried a drink called a Mocha Striped. It was  really  good. Drank it all on the way back to the church and then had to take a major piss but then was taken aback by one of the girls from the youth that came to help us unload the van. There were only two so I'll let you decide which one I was checking out. Talked to Joey and Ryan (for some odd ball reason I don't think that is his name) about our band and they remember playing against us because of our hot cymbal chicks. If they only knew how cocky some of them are they might have changed their mind but for the most part I have to agree with them on that one. Then the stuff in the first paragraph took place. Some time passed. Got pretty pissed I missed out on another great opportunity to get away from Mr. Hunt lol and watched some tv and here I am now. I am coming home tomorrow night and I am wishing that my 'vacation' was longer. It sucks but I am looking forward to pre-band camp a week from Monday but I wish I could just either hang out here some more or take a weekend trip somewhere or do something. Oh well. I will say, yes at this point, I wish I was driving. It sorta sucks now but that's the way things happen. How old do you have to be before you can get something pierced? I'll leave you with that question burned in your head as I finish reading the post I just typed and realized that it seems like I am on crack or something because it is simply a bunch of words jumbled together, but, cheers anyway peeps!

						   Went into Macon tonight for a meeting with Mr. Hunt and about twenty other of his Master Gardner friends. The meeting was boring and it really went down hill after someone made a comment about a shovel and the room started laughing about it, well, except me of coarse because I know nothing about gardening, nor do I want to really, nor did I find the elementary joke funny, but when I asked him if there was a coffee shop anywhere around and he stated 'yes' I then had something to look forward to after an hour conversation about roses. We went to a little coffee shop called  Joshua Cup Coffee  and it was a spiffy little place but Mr. Hunt was bouncing off the walls and I honestly didn't want to be seen with him in public because of it and also because I had made eye contact with this hot girl that was sipping on a cup of joe on the couch while we walked in. I ordered an espresso drink called a Josh Java and it was  really  good except I didn't have the chance to put anything in it, sugar or milk, because I wanted to run out the door when the guy handed me my snazzy little brown coffee cup. You can read about the mission statement and what the coffee shop is all about  urlLink here  and see why it is such a cool place. I want to buy one of their t-shirts and support a good cause. I am tired. I want to post about my many adventures that I have taken part in these past two days but I am about to fall over. The coffee is wearing off and I'm pretty bloody exhausted. But I'm still in a really good mood if you can believe it. I would get up and do something right now if I could. This was a lame excuse for a post was it not? lol

						   If I had to sum up the night in a short little thing it would be a message I sent to one of my new best friends just a second ago:
  
          
            
                 mikesheddotcom : and that's why i said i feel like i'm losing a friendship i'm not sure i had to begin with, the end, i'll be here all week with other pointless stories of self pity   
              
            
         
                
       
 
The football game was incredible last night except for that thought above raging in my head. New layout and design on the way. More then likely sometime Monday if I haven't gone crazy. lol

I feel so needed, so loved, so comfortable. I don't need to go into details because I don't think I can put them into words, but  thank you so much  to everyone for excepting me into something I was so worried that was already established and didn't have room for new people like me. I think I'm just rambling or something but I have to say these past couple of days have been life changing.
 
Oh yeah. Thanks to Amory lol a lot of people have flocked to my site to read my most of the time meaningless ramblings. Just to let those of you know that haven't seen my site, I'm a terrible speller and the only reason my spelling/grammer is half good is because of the spell checker I use on my Apple iBook G3. Shameless plug for the Macintosh Community. I hope you guys enjoy and don't be afraid to leave a comment. If I'm being a baby or blabbing or not understand something or something leave a comment and set me straight.
 
  Okay! Now I'm rambling. One last comment, could someone please tell me why I thought I needed to put up with so much useless mello-dramatic crap from 'friends' to make myself  think  I was happy. I've tried to explain to some folks what I mean by that so just clue me in if you have a reason because I'm kicking myself over it now.  
 
Now I think I'm done. I'm hungry. Do I have any homework? I'm not in the mind set to do any if I do. I think I have a playing test tomorrow too. I'll leave you with a thought I learned in sunday school this morning...
 
'Light  always  comes after darkness.' Amen. And get use to all my various thank yous. Jeff, you're the man.

						   I can not even really put my feelings into words right now. I had  the  best night man. Went to church and it was great! All the people are just awesome. I went this past Sunday and everyone was like youth is awesome you should come. So Amory and her mom, my english teacher, were gracious enough to give me a ride to church where I did my homework and ate dinner. Then youth, or 24.7 I believe it's called started. I can not even explain to you how cool this place was or the atmosphere or anything it was life changing I must say. So after youth everyone wanted me to stay for youth choir. I mean, people I didn't even know where asking me and I had to stay... so I did and it was awesome! At the same time, the same people wanted me play in orchestra, so I did and I was worried that I was stepping on some toes being it my first Wednesday night and all but everyone was so nice about it and I played, sight-read I should say, and it was awesome! So I made a bunch of new friends, built strong bonds with some folks I never thought I would, I'm in the youth choir which is performing Sunday! and in the orchestra playing my trumpet! 
Life is great!  God is great! and boy does He let you know it once you choose to except Him into your life. Thanks everyone but especially Amory and Mrs. Mann for everything you have done for me in my walk to becoming a better, more active Christian and finding Jesus Christ as my Saviour.

						   School is great. Marching band is life. Friends can be  very  confusing. Life is a gift. More to come, just on a natural high right now I suppose. Working on a re-design for my site in my spare time which has been sparse here lately but that's awesome.

						   Today was a great day. I mean, could it have been a smidge bit better? Yeap. I'll run it down bare with me as I am already becoming very bored with the not so interesting details.
 
I saw everybody worth seeing in the morning. Knocked over a few freshman I knew from marching band for the heck of it to try and loosen them up a bit. Didn't work to well. lol Went to the band room which to me is always cool. I'm a band geek what can I say. Ran into Melody and then went to first period. First is Algebra II for me with a teacher that I know from when we use to go to the same church. He's cool but the class is a little boring, people wise. Kellye sits right behind me. She's  really  cool. Good choice Shaun. Jared sits a couple chairs back and so does Bri and ReVisa. We found out that we have to pay to use a locker. I didn't have any money on me so I will get a bottom locker tomorrow. Sort of sucks but oh well.
 
Long time span goes by because I'm talking to everyone online...
 
Second period is German II. I forgot  everything  when she wanted us to write two sentences about our summer. I was taking forever but maybe I was distracted by the two Sara(h)s and Liz sitting around me. Frau Higdon has gotten really big and I think all of us are pretty much counting down the days until she leaves on maternity leave lol.
 
Symphonic band was my third period class. Same old, same old. I'm last chair second part and I know that David is going to challenge me as soon as he can. Sort of sucks because he isn't in marching band and doesn't know how much better I can play after practicing just about everyday this summer thanks to some one I won't name because they don't believe me when I say that they influenced me wanting to play better. I think I proved that I can play, well, that's what some of the trumpets have been telling me. I sit next to Dave and I have to sit on the end of the row on the outside. Going to be interesting if I get to stay there.
 
Fourth period is English, some like to call it 'advanced' but nobody in the class seems to care about that. Our teacher, Mrs. Mann, is so cool. Just the way she does things and her beliefs is just refreshing. We need more teachers like her but I wish the class would give her more respect. The summer work that I have been working on isn't due until Monday now but at least I got it done.
 
Chemistry, fifth period, is going to be very interesting. First off the teacher is from Hungry or something and you can't really understand anything she says unless you stare at her lips and that is just weird to sit and stare at a teachers lips. That is the only class I have in a trailer so I lucked out there. 
 
I'm getting bored writing all this out. Who cares? Everyone is asking each other how there day was so I just thought I would type it once but still, this is gay. lol But I got to finish it now right?...
 
Sixth period is a huge class. Honors American History and the teacher is interesting. He was an 11Alive Class Act teacher so he must be doing something right, right? lol Craig sits behind me next to his girlfriend. Liz sits behind me on the other side. Amanda sits across the room, so does Elizabeth and Rebekah. That class has alot of people worth naming but I'm to lazy at the moment to name them to be honest.
 
Lunch, for me, is awesome. I had more people that I wanted to sit with then I knew what to do with. We all pretty much sat together so it was cool. There are some people that I would love to eat lunch with but maybe next year man.
 
Over all groovy day. Tomorrow is the introduction day that I will just screw everything and say hi to everyone and crap now that I know were my classes are and junk.
 
I'm done. Off to chat with my kick hash peeps.

						   I just got back from the 'On the Bricks' concert and I got to meet, shake hands,  and  get an autograph from one of my favorite artists of all time!  Josh Kelley!  I was so excited and he sang great and Nickel Creek was there and Third Eye Blind and most importantly  Josh Kelley!  Post not checked for spelling because I'm still buzzing about the concert and my personal meeting with  Josh Kelley!  And  Josh Kelley  is going to be on 'The Late Late Show' in a few minutes! Sweet!

						   I'm so happy right now I am smiling from ear to ear. Haven't felt like this in a few days so I am trying to take advantage of it but it's hard because I'm about to fall over on the keyboard from exaction. I can only imagine how it is going to be getting home from Waycross early Sunday morning. I keep saying I will type about my week and stuff that's been going on but I don't have time right now or have time at all here lately. I love my website but believe it or not folks I do have prirorites and my website isn't number one, two, three, four, or five. Maybe number seven or so? lol Just like I've been saying, and Mrs. Janice (I hope I spelt that right) said this morning in one of the best Sunday schools ever, except Kellye wasn't there and everyone was half asleep, there is  always  light after darkness.  Always.  I still have to finish something for Reading but I am so tired. Sorry Mrs. Mann. I have it written out but it isn't typed so maybe I can make it look purdy Tuesday night. Before I say 'night read what five people online just sent me all at once:

        Now I will say 'night and thanks for sitting through another pointless post. lol They are becoming more frequent aren't they? How about this weather!? A couple of us were late getting into the Worship Center tonight before church because we didn't want to get out of the nice weather. I hope it is something like this in Waycross next week. I just thought of something, some people might not have any idea what I'm talking about when I'm talking about going to Waycross so  urlLink click here  if you want to know more. Okay, now I'm done with this post. I can't wait for school tomorrow man! Good times!

						   ...That is why they won the Emmy last Sunday for best drama series. That was an awesome premiere and I didn't even see the whole thing. Rough past couple of days but I think I can safely say that it is slowly back to normal. Whatever normal is after everything those of us effected have gone through. Just pray for everything to go back to some sense of normalcy man.

						   What an extremely stressful day today was. Marching band practice was cancelled because of the massive amounts of rain that came through and that is always depressing to me because I look forward all day to marching band. Everyone that I know of has something going on with one of their friends. It's weird, like something is in the water. Maybe it was in the rain. Maybe it was acid rain and even though it didn't rain until later today the air was very moist and there for acid was in the air. Okay, that was lame but I'm a dork like that anyways. New site is up. I hope you noticed that when you loaded it. I  love  it. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that no one really comments on the posts to much. I was thinking about that and I even thought about taking down the comment feature but then I thought about it and it isn't that bad that no one comments. I don't know how to explain it but I don't comment on people's websites either to much. It is there's and even when I do it is never negative it is always positive. Now that I got my mind off of my current situation that is driving me up the wall for a total of thirty seconds, I will say good night and thanks for sitting through another one of my pointless posts. One last thing- it's Monday night and that means I have SAT vocabulary sentences for English. Here are two of my sentences that I wrote tonight... 2. Sometimes I feel like someone casted an  anathema  on me because I worry about my best friends so much. 4. The  indolence  of the marchers caused us to have to work extra hard at practices. Now that is all for tonight. I hope I used the words correctly. I have ten sentences total but I don't feel like typing more then two because I really need a Mountain Dew before I go and try to sleep.

						   I'm not use to being home this early on Wednesday night. Tonight was great at 24.7. Not everyone was there but it was still awesome. Had a great convo with my best bud and it made my week. Life is great again in Mike's world. I bought two new cds too! Good stuff. One is called  Stay  by Jeremy Camp and the other is a self titled cd by Warren Barfield. Haven't had to chance to listen to em yet but I know I'll enjoy them when I do get a chance to listen to them. I also ordered one of my favorite artists past cds, Bebo Norman's  Big Blue Sky . Can't wait to pick it up. Well, off to talk to my peeps. Thank God for great friends...

						   Stuff is better now. My mind is so use to taking things and making them seem twenty-one times worse then they really are, or were. I'm so use to crap getting thrown in my face at every turn I was expecting the same thing on this but in reality that was not the case. I'm still praying about this and having this week off from school and having no homework or anything else to do except review German I stuff my mind tends to wonder and look what happens when it does. Did that make any sense? We shall see what tomorrow brings... I'll try and post something that will hold your attention for more then three seconds and makes since to more then me and the two other people it involves.

						   Can this situation that I have going on right now get any worse? It's bad enough that we don't have school and now this situation is making my depressed as crazy. I thought everything was going to be okay last night but today just, well, 'inhaled vigorously.' I'm trying to think about other things but I pretty much can't. I pray that I have not lost two of my best friends and if I have lost either one of them I simply don't know how I'm gonna handle it.  No worries anyone  just needed to continue my pitty-party and thought that since I hadn't posted in a few days I would post something now.

						   I'm at home right now. I'm sick with something and I have no idea what it is though I have been feeling a little better. I wish I was at school. I hate missing school. And I'm going to miss marching band too! Arg! 
Last night was just pretty awesome. The See You at the Pole Rally was last night at Union Grove High School and a band called Casting Crowns was there. They were pretty good. I love that one song called 'If We are the Body.' I went with church so everyone that I respect was there with the exception of a few not being there it was a great time. I witnessed a large number of fellow youth get saved which was incredible. Shaun, I can't even begin to try and start to say... What you did last night was simply incredible and exactly what I needed. It only caused me to cry a little until I got back on the bus and started thinking and talking to Michelle. lol God is great. What more can I say man? 
Did I mention I wish I was at school? Well I did again. I hope certain people keep there cool today without me being there to calm them down. So much is going on it's weird. All of it is good in its own way however weird that sounds. As I've learned recently, God knows what is going to happen in our lives before it happens so when it does happen you just have to know that it happened for a reason. In the end everything happens for a reason. There is a reason why I am growing closer to certain people. There is a reason why I'm being pulled away from other people that I use to be dragged down by. There is a reason why I can say I have a best friend or two or three or four now and know that they feel the same exact way. There is a reason as to why some people are going to read this and take it the wrong way and try to blame me for things with out even thinking about it first. That's just life I suppose and I now know that I have something to live for so I am ready to face what ever life has to throw at me because I'm on God's path and on His path everything happens for a reason.

						   Part of my list of homework tonight, as always on Monday nights for english, was to write sentences using my current list of SAT Prep vocabulary. I just finished them and so here a few of them are. Look up the word in bold if you don't know them right off the top of your head. They all should be used correctly in the sentence but will see when Mrs. Mann grades them...
 
4. The kid was an  enigma  to me before I got to know him like I do now, now we are best friends.
 
6. It took courage to stand infront of the four of us and express what he was feeling, holding back tears, and remaining very  articulate .
 
7. The food this year at band camp was extremely  insipid .
 
9. I find that reading my Bible (*tear still) helps to  assuage  me when I need to have a moment with God during the day.
 
All of my sentences are usually based on one of three things, marching band, church, or personal feelings. I have ten sentences total so if you want more because you find them interesting leave the number in the comments on this post and I'll put them up there asap. Night.

						   Sorry for the lack of posts here lately. I have a brand new look and I haven't posted anything to it. I've been keeping busy and loving every minute of it.
 
I had a post that I wrote out yesterday that I will post in just a sec after I tell you why the post didn't get posted yesterday. We now have cable internet at our house and it wasn't working yesterday so Mike had to get the thing for his comp and had to figure out my comp but now it all works. Thank you very much Dottie. Now I need to find a new flugel horn because I fell in love with Dottie's and now she want to see it. Anyways. lol The post from yesterday...  
          
            
                Sorry for the lack of posts this past week. I created my new site and didn't post anything cool to read. Well I have an extra second so I'll type a little something.
 
One of the reasons I haven't been able to post is because I've had a crap load of homework every night this past week. After marching band and church I have to do my homework before going to bed or it won't get done. I had homework in every class except band here lately and it's not to much fun. We spend all day at school only to come home and do more school work? lol Only two more years of public school.
 
School is great though besides worrying about my grades for some reason I am loving it. German officailly stinks. Our teacher had her baby no we have a sub that is just weird for the next twelve weeks up until the week or so before our final for the semester. I'm failing that class. No joke. I'm trying my hardest studying and all that jazz but it's just not working. It sort of funny because I think the highest average in our class is an 87. Everyone is doing bad except for three or four of us. Lets not talk about them right now though. It's going to be very interesting to see what my grades are when progress reports come out. I've been studying and doing homework and everything but I don't feel very confident with some of my grades. It's weird but nothing I can do but continue doing my best.
 
The new site. You like? Everyone I've talked to likes it. Some love it. lol Please just leave comments or something. Love reading all that junk except for the forum. I'll read it from time to time but it gets old to me after a while but as long as people are interested in it I'll keep it up.
 
First away football game yesterday. We spent more time on the bus going to and from Warner Robins then we did in the stadium. It was interesting to say the least. The bus ride to and from was very interesting. I'm not getting into any of it though do to the fact that I don't know how to word it so I won't. lol But our team lost. What a surprise. 44-0. Can someone tell me what was up with the gay fireworks they kept shooting for the heck of it? That was lame. They didn't even make any noise man!
 
We now have cable internet. Very happy about that because now I can tie up the phone line by actually talking to people while chatting with everyone at the same time but of coarse I'd only do that when I finished my homework. ;-) I don't have the cable internet connected to my comp yet because I am still trying to figure out the best way to do it.
 
I'm sure I have more to say but I'm done rambling for now. Tell later...  Hand Check!  Good stuff man but wasn't good stuff was my hair last night! LOL Don't let me forget my hat ever again!   
              
            
         
                
        To be honest I didn't even read what I wrote from yesterday so I hope it isn't anything bad or what not. lol Tonight was great. Praise God for what He has done in my life and how He has used me to create change in other's lives. I have seen the Lord working in mysterious ways lately, bringing me closer to Him, bring me closer to my true friends, blessing me with a few   best friends  that I would trust with my life , and helping shine light on situations that I was never aware of until He came into my life and showed me that there was a purpose to it all. Before I get all emotional  again  I want to leave you with a quote that one of my awesome awesome awesome friends told me a couple of days ago. Take what you will from it but just listen to it and maybe you will see where I am coming from... "I have lost a lot of friends because of the changes I have made in my life but I'm happier without them, with God, then I was with them, ignoring Him..."

						   I don't like this brisk, down right cold weather. I wish April or May would come when I woke up tomorrow or more so just the weather that comes along usually with those months. I've been sick with the flu all week. All my plans were screwed up and they even were messed up this morning when I sat up in bed and almost feel back because my head hurt so bad. So now I'm waiting on mom to go to the church service and hopefully play since I missed sunday school  again  this week. :-( What has this website turned into? Heh.

						   During the afternoon announcements 'the voice' made an announcement telling all teachers and students to come to FCA in the morning for they will be honoring the football team on their football season. Has the sponsor of FCA forgotten what FCA is all about? Yes, it is a time to gather, to have fellowship as Christians and honor  God   not  the football team. I haven't attended FCA in a few weeks because it is more of a get together and goof around time with some sort of speaker and I personally, along with a few other people, walk out of there without feeling like anything was learned. Anyway maybe it's just me that feels like FCA is being turned in the wrong direction. Maybe it's leadership or some sort of lack of student leadership but I will not be attending FCA in the morning if ever again. I would much rather gather with my friends and honor God on our own tomorrow morning then honor the football players. "FCA is not about honoring the football players it is about honoring God..." Me to Amory.

						   Take a look at today's newspaper article about  our marching band's three Grand Championships  in the Henry Daily Herald. If you can't pick up a copy of today's paper, click on the link below where you can read the same article that was in the paper for a limited time. I  think  I could have written a better article but at least we finally received some sort of county recognition. Read the article by clicking  urlLink here . The Atlanta Journal Constitution is supposedly coming out to take pictures of the band for an article about our accomplishments at the football game tonight. The game should be interesting because it is not only senior night but eighth grade night and our last football game which also means the last time we are going to march the show. Pretty depressing to me but I'm trying not to think to much right now. I should post an actual post sometime soon. Maybe. Heh.

						   The simple things in life make me so happy but then I crash on the little things that aren't so great.  Thank God that things are  better  with two of the people I love so much.  New paragraph- I wish I had the courage to just go up and talk to people. That is like my biggest thing at the moment. There have been so many times here lately that I would give anything if God would just put my mind at ease and let me just walk up to someone and talk to them or even worse a group of people and just start talking. I don't know what it is really because I don't have a problem with talking but I feel like such an outsider sometimes and I guess that is my fault because I don't just put myself out there. Now that I have made no since I am going to watch some more tv and just chill because I am so sick of studying for chemistry and history. I feel pretty good about my history final coming up but chemistry on the other hand is another story.

I'm going to ace the final I can feel it but I'm still praying that my mind can become some what at ease when I actually sit down to take it. I'm worried about chemistry too just because  no one  knows what they are doing in chemistry so it should be funny. Well that's all for now. I had a spear minute so I thought I would post something. The poem, if you want to call it that, was what I felt at the time of when I wrote it. I already got part of what I wanted for Christmas man and that was to get one of my best friends back and before I turn into the big crying baby I become when I think about certain things I'll say talk to you later guys!

						   Dirty looks and tormenting glances from the ones you care for most hurt to the absolute core of my being.
 
It happened so quickly those around me had no idea what was the matter so I put on the mask of happiness and flatter for what else could I do when you can't tell anyone what exactly is the matter?
 
Everyone has a person or two, a sort of God sent, that knows everything about you- your troubles, your triumphs, and reappearing problems from the past so what then do you do when they suddenly don't trust you and it makes you feel like you don't matter? 
 
When it seems like the world is against you and its your time to leave it you always look for that glimpse of the light and hope at the end of the tunnel but then what do you do when that light is getting further and darker away from you? 
 
The people that once figuratively held your light so high in your eyes, and you did the same in return, slowly slip away and turn away taking your light with them only looking back a few times to see you hurting and quickly turn back to talk about it and laugh.
 
This is nothing more then a simple free verse which some will take as self-pity written from someone who is honestly hurting and drowning in their enormous amount of fears and tears. 
 
It is impossible to just walk away from them so i will get down on my knees once more and I will pray.
 
Pray for some sort of forgiveness or some sort of closure that will make this somehow remotely better.
 
Oh how great it would be to have the return of the warm glances in the eyes of the ones that truly care and the looks of hope that they know you will always be there.
 
I'm running on empty and running out of words but please just hear me and read these last few words.
 
Why would I bother you so much if I truly didn't care because before you distrusted me I always said "I will always be there."
 
He sent you into my life and you have helped me through hellish times so please just please listen one more time.
 
I'm running out of time and lines on this page and my thoughts and feelings are becoming once more nothing but short twisted phrases filled with jumbled up words,
 
words that I pray will not be mistaken,
 
that I pray will not be simply once again be mistaken...

Something cool that I am going to start doing is a  Moblog . Since I have a camera phone now I can take pictures and send them to my site instantly and they will appear up here and its pretty cool. Look for that soon. Busy right now too so gotta go..

						    Masquerade  Across the Sky 
For so long I've been 
Putting all my effort into you 
My heart is bare 
I've been looking everywhere for truth 
You know... 
Exactly what you're doing to me 
But that's okay... 
'Cause I'm not playing anymore 
 
CHORUS 
I see what you're trying to hide 
It didn't take me long to realize 
You can't fool me with your disguise 
I can see right through your lying eyes 
You took your shot, pushed me around 
You're never gonna take me down 
So get out of my face... 
With your masquerade 
 
Since I've moved on 
Things are going everyway but wrong 
It's a brighter day (across the sky) 
A new life, new friends 
It's got me wondering where I've been 
I was in a haze 
I know... 
That you're still bearing down on me 
That's okay... 
'Cause I'm not running anymore 
 
CHORUS 
 
When it all comes down 
You won't have control over me 
You can shape it how you want 
But you have been revealed 
 
You took your shot, pushed me around 
You're never gonna take me down 
 
CHORUS 

- The song is awesome even tho my posting it now is a little late but I sill feel the same way. Good stuff.

						   What was... 
1. ... your first grade teacher's name?  Mrs. Davis  
2. ... your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?  Hmm.. I didn't really have one but I loved the original  Power Rangers  if that counts.  
3. ... the name of your very first best friend?  This might sound like a pity party or something but I don't really ever remember calling anyone my 'best friend.' I think my next door neighbor's grand-daughter, Katie I think was her name, when I was a little guy in Massachusetts was my 'best friend.'  
4. ... your favorite breakfast cereal?  I think it was Kix or Frosted Flakes. I've never liked milk with my cereal but I liked eating those two the most.  
5. ... your favorite thing to do after school?  I think after doing my homework I always watched the telly.

No more usless posts for one day.

"how you feeling mike?".. "whats wrong mike?".. "can you come do this and that mike?"..  i dont know .. the dang doctors dont know anything either so once again its all in your head mike.. dont argue with me mike you arent a dr mike you dont know whats going on but i know so much more bc just bc im older and have been through it.. there is a reason you dont wanna do what the dr told you to do mike but i dont know what mike.. you have always done what the dr has said mike.. always mike you do what the dr says.. but we dont know whats wrong with you mike but youll be okay if you do this this this and of coarse this till we can try and run some more tests and do this this this and this eventually and in the mean time do this this this and this cause im a doctor this is what i get paid the big bucks for.. ..

I'm sick of people asking me and acting like they're worried because  I'm  not because crap with me  always  goes away. I'm not trying to be difficult with all of this but I'm just wanting to live again. I want to go back to Six Flags... I want to drive.. all that stuff. Nothing is as bad as it usually appears in the eyes of the parents who are the first to get you checked out but at the same time hopeing nothing is wrong. I'm sick of all this so no more. People are way more worse off then little ole me so why complain or even talk about it? I'm breathing. More then some people can say. I have incredible friends..  best friends  for the first time in my life I can say that and know the love is there in return. I'm done and I don't think anything can change my mind at this point either.. Nobody get mad at this post and post anything in the comments cause there is nothing to talk about here. Period.

						   So this is what it feels like to live outside of my  little box  I   [stupid stupid me]   had created around myself? It's awesome but scary as butt at the same time to me. Hard to put into words but I don't feel like I have to or need to cause it's just.. yea. What an incredible Spring Break thus far and I pray it only gets better if that's at all possible.   I just hope I don't do something wrong and push everyone away like I tend to do so well sometimes.

						   1. Laying on your back and facing the ceiling, which side of the bed do you sleep on?  Don't really have a  side . I have a twin size bed now so I am in the middle, left, and right all at the same time. heh  
2. Do you have to have covers (blankets and/or sheets) at all costs, no matter the weather?  Nope. All depends on what the weather is like and what I'm wearing or where I am and stuff like that.  
3. Sleep nekkid or no? Why?  Some mornings I wake up butt naked which is fine for me but mom sometimes just comes in without knocking because she thinks I won't hear it cause I'm asleep. I would go to bed 'nekkid' all the time if I could. lol  
4. What's under your bed?  Since I just got a bed the only thing that is under there are my shoes cause they would be covered in clothes at the moment if they were in my closet.  
5. If you have pets, do you let them sleep with you? Why or why not?  No way. Pets are okay but stay out of my room! One reason is I have a black bed spread and don't want the hair getting on it and another reason is I just don't want them to sleep with me, or in my room at all for that matter.

						     So Blue   
Downhere 

Shallow capacity is bearing all I see, and I know 
It's disease.. it's loss.. it's death knocking at my door 
I click these thoughts to something else, 
Something more. 

I'm so blue, so blue. 

Detached harmonies, all the airways scream dissonance 
And we know of broken life.. broken homes.. 
Broken hearts and broken bones, 
Recycling the paper of a crying world's suicide note and 

We're so blue, so blue. 

See the world spinning round 
A sucking hole that souls go down 
Embrace the sorrow of today because 
Repentance finds a way 
Only His blood can heal our wounds 
Only His blood can heal our wounds 
And if repentance finds a way, what's left today to be.. 

Blue? 

A final symphony, 
The precipice too close, you're scaring me - back away! 
Sin is real.. it doesn't feel.. It always.. only always.. steals. 
Run to the cross the only joy that's real! 

All so blue. 

- I was just listening to random music this afternoon, being bored and wanting something to do, and this song came on. I  LOVE  this song and the band is pretty sweet too! We, being some folks in our youth group, meet them on the  urlLink LGLP Tour/Retreat  we went on (incredible weekend) and I got their autographs and they are great guys and great musicians. Anyway. So like I said I was bored and needed something to do so this song and  urlLink this picture  inspired me to make this new blue "summer" site. Just a little change. Everything is still the same. Now it's just  BLUE!

						   FYI: One year ago today I started posting with  urlLink Blogger  again. I've had this domain for a couple of years now but today is the anniversary of my return to Blogger. It's actually pretty cool to go back and read my rants and my outlook on life and see where I stand now. It's also pretty cool seeing other people jumping on the blog bandwagon or redoing their blog's look. To another blogging year! Yeah. Yeah. I'm lame, I know..

						   The trip to the lake with my Sunday School class was awesome! There was only me and four other people (Blake, Craig, Shannon, and Shelly) but I can honestly I haven't laughed as hard as I did from Friday around 1:30 till Sunday around 5:30 in a  very  long time. It was an honor getting to spend time with them just hanging out on the lake, not to mention getting a chance to hang out with Mamma Jason and Baby Eater Nick but one thing I learned this weekend was that Nick is  awesome . He doesn't scare me anymore either. Mrs. Jan and Mr. Denis are incredible too but there is absolutely no question in anyone's mine about that statement either.
 
I'm a little sore still from tubing for my first time on Saturday too. That was fun and getting thrown off the tube was fun too. Nick was driving the boat and let me have a fairly easy ride starting out cause it was my first time but then he let me have it and threw me off. It was awesome! And we went to the marina too! They had Regal's on display that you could walk onto and stuff and they looked pretty sweet. There was one that I loved and it only cost about twenty-one thousand dollars! lol
 
My pillow still smells like the lake house which is funny. It isn't any great smell or anything but it's a unique smell to say the least. I love the lake house as does everybody else that has gone does I think. I have so much more respect for the people that went now too. Blake was awesome as always. Talked to Craig for a good hour and that was awesome. People just don't understand how much it means to me to just sit and chat about nothing and know that they care about what we're talking about as much as I do. Shelly is not as quite as I thought she was which is awesome. Shannon continues to amaze me in everything. Those two wanted to do everything! They even went tubing! Shelly even tried water skiing! How awesome is that!? She didn't get it but at least she tried! More then I can say. Wasn't diggin the water skiing and didn't feel like trying the knee board either. Next time if the water's nice.
 
It was a great weekend and I'm blessed to have you guys in my life. Thank you Blake, Craig, Mr. Denis, Mrs. Jan, Nick, Mamma Jason, Shannon, and Shelly! And Tyler too for listening to me ramble Sunday night about everything that happened on the trip! It takes a true friend to put up with me man. Thanks bro.

						    Where The Angels Sleep  
Bebo Norman 

I don't know why I always run  
 is it fear of the fall or fear of the touch  
 And I don't know where the angels sleep  
 
 And I don't know how to really love  
 I've never stood still long enough  
 And I don't know where the angels sleep  
 
 But I am alive and standing strong  
 I'm no farther forward, just farther along  
 I hold on to my pride and dig in deep  
 It's pulling me down, and I am no closer to release  
 And I don't know where the angels sleep 
 
 I don't know how to see you now  
 The friend from before is different somehow  
 And I don't know where the angels sleep  
 
 And I don't know when I'll love again  
 But I don't trust myself to just let you in  
 And I don't know where the angels sleep  
 
 It's taken ten thousand days  
 To get stuck in my ways  
 And it offers no grace  
 I cannot stand this place  
 With love in my face  
 I walk away slowly  
 
 I don't know where the angels sleep  
 No, I don't know where the angels sleep 

-I just simply  love  this song and would give anything to play the guitar and sing this song just for me. This song and one called  The Hammer Holds  keep playing over and over in my head. I put the lyrics of that song on here first but decided to put these up instead. Maybe I'll put the other ones up too sometime.  urlLink The CD  is a couple years old but its pretty incredible. All of the songs are so meaningful and thought provoking. On this track it's just Bebo and his guitar that stand out through the song. It's awesome man..

						   The power just went out for a split second about five minutes ago!
 
That was really really weird man! Scared me half to death! I was talking to people online and all of a sudden everything went dark! It isn't storming either and it happened at Elizabeth's house too which is right down the road. Interesting. I had to reset the router too! lol
 
I'm glad I took a leak about ten minutes before it happened or I would be changing boxers right about now! lol

						   People never stop amazing me.
 
Good or bad.
 
Nothing new in that statement.
 
Yes. I have been in a  huge  funk since we have gotten back from Texas. I know this very well. Am I completely certain as to why I am? Not really. Happens to me every so often where I have practically a nervious break down and all that stuff that comes with it, thoughts, etc. This time it just happened to be during the summer when nobody can see me on a daily basis like if we were in school. Anyway, back to my original statement.
 
The complexity of how people treat people, not me persay but me too sometimes, amazes me. One of the people I would love to call one of my closest friends and actually feel the same in return just doesn't seem to understand me. It bugs me just because it's me. I asked them point blank if they felt like they knew me after all the stuff that we have been through and their answer was "not right now." Aight I can give them that but I also haven't talked to the person in numerous days and had  no  idea that I mattered that much to them or if I really do or if it was another moment to throw in a convenient comment to try and help the situation. It's always convenient to say stuff when you feel like it will make the person happy but don't bs me and say something and not  mean  it.
 
It kills me.
 
I think to much, yeah, but I think I have fair ground to speak on this sort of thing on behalf of anyone. If someone says something to you at one point and then acts a different way later I think that would make anyone a little upset.
 
All this is simply more rambling thoughts from me, yours truly, Mike as always. Post is almost over. Just a few more words.
 
I wish I could get another chance with some people. I'm sick of this box I keep finding myself trapped in but the sad thing is is that I have no idea how to get out of it. That is what I am currently working on. Getting out of my box.
 
Thank God for you. You know who you are. You could be more then one person too. Thank you for  everything .

						   Had another lame test today this one was on my brain. Called an EEG or something. The lady had to stick these electrode things all over my head and neck with this really sticky jelly stuff. I couldn't sleep more then five hours last night or eat or drink anything with sugar or caffeine which basically meant I couldn't eat or drink anything except bread and water. That took a good part of my afternoon but I went to Starbucks afterward so I guess that was alright. I'm not going to type anymore cause if I did it would get me in to trouble at the moment. Later.    CURRENT SONG:  I Want To Live - Josh Gracin  urlLink  iTunes

						   I got my pictures from the trip back. They stink. There are a few that are pretty good tho. You can look at them and know that a professional sure as heck didn't take them but at the same time you can get the over all affect of what went down I think. I was gonna make a book through iPhoto with them but they aren't nearly good enough and I can't touch them up enough to make me want to spend that much on a book. I need a digital camera so bad.. but I would much rather have a car.. hmm.. digital camera or a car?  Both!  heh

						   Where in the world could I possibly even begin to talk about our mission trip to Texas? I could make an analogy to our trip that we took to Six Flags- Fiesta Texas and relate that to the over all trip. It was a roller coaster ride with extreme emotions with at times extremely heavy rain that smacked you in the face and made you want to shut down and other times bright warm sunshine that warmed you up and gave you a reason to continue. Lame analogy but that is about how I would sum it up. 

Would I trade any of the tears.. smiles.. sore legs from long hours on the charter bus .. friendship tests.. hugs.. prayers.. down time.. thinking time.. tired eyes.. would I trade any of it in for the over all life changing experience I had on the trip.. not in a trillion years. 

 All we can do is plant the seed  and I think that is what we did exactly those ten days we were away from Stockbridge. The amount of emotional stress our youth group has been under here recently and trying to set that aside and  plant the seeds  was at times stressful, at times wonderful, and like I said before.. over all.. life changing. 

I took plenty of pictures and I am hoping that a majority of them came out pretty good but we shall see when I pick them up sometime this week. 

I went on the trip honestly not wanting to go. I prayed long and hard about all of it and I kept thinking that I couldn't let this opportunity get away from me.. and like I said I'm glad I didn't let it get away from me. I  hate  that I think as much as I do  sometimes  most of the time but I guess that is just how I am always going to be. My least favorite thing about myself I gotta say. 

Enough rambling.. sorry.. the trip was awesome! I hope I didn't screw up any of my close relationships with the people I love like I tend to do when I try and live outside of my little box and if I did have the courage to talk to me about it. I haven't felt like being online (Instant Messenger for those of you that might have been confused by that last statement) because it has been fun to see if anyone will try and have any sort of contact with me outside of being on AIM like all of the normal people around me seem to do.. and as of right now.. there hasn't been any contact with anyone except Sarah and Sara. Me thinking too much again? Probably. But is it wrong to want a  real  friendship. One were you call each other or spend time together and feel like it means something to them? Like everyone around me seems to have. I know what you're probably thinking..  why don't you just pick up the phone Mike and call them if you want to talk to them so bad.  Yeah. I've thought that same thing but it always leads me back down the pity party path and me thinking (See!? Thinking again!) that nobody wants me to bug them, etc, etc. 

I read this same sort of statement on someone's website when I got home earlier and it fit how I feel exactly seventy-five percent of the time.. 

 It's frustrating being around those friends you  love  and would give  anything  for and they find you  disposable .  

I started writing random scriptures and lyrics and quotes and stuff in a notebook while I was in Texas when I was bored or found something I felt worthy of remembering and that quote was definitely something I wrote down. 

Happy Birthday  again  Melinda! 

Oh yeah.. the title is a little inside joke sort of thing! lol Shelly you're awesome!

						   Well this will be my last actual post until we return home from Texas.. I'm excited and worried about the whole thing at the same time. To tired to go into details. I think this is going to be a  major  test for myself personally in the way I handle things, the way I think about somethings, and the way I go about doing somethings. A whole bunch of things that I need to think about but I am going to have an awesome time on the trip regardless.. please don't get me wrong. The people I am going with are beyond words especially those few of you who I would lay my life down for.. can't wait to spend more time with you guys this week! Let the fun begin and I just pray everything goes well, that our message is delivered, and people are, within our own group and everyone we come into contact with, are touched my Him just as we have been.  We should be back Saturday afternoon.. that's June 12. I should post some pictures from my camera phone through out the week and I'm taking a camera or two and I am determined to capture memories on this trip.  I'm tired and still waiting on the dryer to stop so I'm sorry if the grammar and spelling is bad. Double checked it all but to excited and wiped to care really. ;-)  Until I ramble on again..

						   Wanted to load the new site design before I left for TX so I can post Audblog posts, txt posts, and phone pixs even tho that page doesn't match this page just yet. Working on commenting stuff still but that won't take me to much longer so just bear with me for a day.  This site should look good on everyone's comp but if it doesn't send me an email.  Still working on my profile and getting reid of the kinky too.  Not really in the mood to talk so I'll keep this short and head to bed. Expect more frequent posts, shorter more frequent posts and stuff. Enjoy and tell me what you think.

						   Being as it is only the first full day of the annual event us SHS Marching Tigers call  Band Camp , the pure hatred I have for one named "Swig" is unbelievable. I'm sure since it is my last year marching because I am a senior and really not caring to much about the whole thing, I might just have to let the words that I'm thinking come out of my mouth. He isn't getting to me as much as people might think I just  hate  the man. I came to camp this year knowing that he was going to be here and I came with an open mind knowing that I had changed a lot and maybe since I had my attitude toward this ignorant individual would have changed but it hasn't at all. Sectionals stink. The way the trumpets put on a face and act like he is the greatest person in the world is repulsive.
 
Rant for now complete.
 
Greatest start to the week was this morning when we didn't get to do the Senior Stretches but were told we were going to "have our time to shine later." Also, the section that wins Moon Chicken doesn't get to hold the stupid thing at all. They are going to screw it to this board way up high on the new marching tower that has the sections name on it "for everyone to see and know."
 
Shaun's been cool. Haven't seen much of him tho but I expected that from the beginning.
 
Somethings never change, they just improve.
 
The food so far has been better then in year's past too. They finished the remodel of the Food Services building and its pretty modern looking now. More variety to chose from with our meals too so that's good.
 
Other then sectionals being a complete waste of time, our trumpet instructor being completely incompetent with being happy with anything we do, and some people just being people, everything is great! It's great having access to the internet too so big up to •E for hookin me up for the week!

						   Not being able to fall asleep really stinks sometimes. Nobody is available online and it's to late to call anybody in fear of waking them up. So, what am I doing? Sitting here in the dark listening to the newest MercyMe cd ( Undone ) I bought and reliving memories of last weekend in my head. It was such a cool weekend for me and it makes me feel great thinking about how cool it was when I'm in one of my typical states of feeling alone like the one I am in now.
 
I might update about last weekend's trip to the lake later but I wouldn't hold your breath. Not like anyone would anyway tho. I'm just bored right now and felt like posting something stupid. If I don't post anything about the past weekend all that really matters is that certain people really do love me for me and that when you let them into your heart and mind they aren't set out to hurt you. Girlie Mike comments aside, it's great getting to know people you love better and the time you spend with them is always priceless.
 
The summer is practically over which is pretty sweet cause it went by so fast but it was the best ever for me thinking back at it right now in my insomniac state of mind. My thoughts on the summer might change when I'm fully awake so stay tuned for that one. Marching band stuff starts tomorrow afternoon and I need to get started with my student council duties again so I need to take a few trips up to the school to do stuff with that not to mention figure out what the heck I need to do with BETA historian junk.
 
Oh yeah- I am going to be a Senior if I forgot to mention that one.
 
Rambling again so I'll publish this and then go and try to stare at the ceiling some more and drift to sleep..

						   Original title for this post eh?
 
Last first day of high school  ever  if all goes well. Wasn't a very good day at all but I guess that's me being "pessimistic" again. I really do try and find the good stuff in everything but sometimes it isn't that easy for me. I wanted this year to be great and I'm going to try my best to make it great but I think it's going to be harder then I thought.
 
All of my classes are very, well, different. The different types of people in all of them are just weird. It's almost like the powers that be had a meeting to sorta put us not so smart kids that are taking the smarter classes this year in the higher classes but away from the higher, smarter kids. It sorta stinks but I guess that's what I get.
 
AP Government is going to be pretty cool I think. I am all into the government and law stuff and Mr. Jones is really cool but like I said the class is eclectic to say the least. Mr. Guman is awesome. I have him for Honors Trig. That's going to be a trip for me. He went over something on the board and I didn't catch on the first time and it seemed like everybody else did so that we discouraging but we shall see "Chief." The way Mr. Sanders has us sitting in band just isn't right. Why did we audition if he isn't even going to put us in the right chairs that we  earned ? Chorus, Advanced Ensemble, whatever you choose to call it, is going to interesting to. I hate sitting around doing nothing and it seems like we are going to be doing alot of that in there after we get done rehearsing and stuff. I plan on utilizing some time in there but the people that I am close with in that class is going to make it interesting as well. AP Psychology is going to be cool I think too. Mr. McGill seems a lot cooler to me after today too. The company in that class isn't bad either but fifth period isn't my favorite period and hasn't been since freshman year. I tend to get in lots of trouble in fifth period for no apparent reason. Advanced English with Mrs. Fidler is going to be weird too. I miss Mrs. Mann and even Mr. Byrom  so  much. Mrs. Mann was the coolest and not just because I knew her outside of school, she was just an incredible person to be around. Mrs. Fidler seems to just do things differently then any other teacher I've had and that is going to take some getting use to.
 
Those are my first impressions of my classes in a nut shell.
 
My over all mood right now isn't to great. One of those feelings that something just isn't right and I hate it. But what can you do? I wish some things would change but instead of focusing on them so much I guess I just need to realize that somethings my never change.
 
Terrible first day. Way to stressed already for it to be only the first day. But I guess it's just me complaining again. Gotta love the hypocrisy sometimes. Don't read to much into that either. It can only go up from here...
