      You know, being a girl is harder than it looks. There are so many details to deal with, it's rediculous. Today I had my first appointment at the Gyno's. Not that scary...plus, i got sooo much free stuff, it's rediculous! 3 months worth of free birth control, tampons, face wash, a pack to keep it all in...i love medical samples. Marg, when you're a doctor, please get me free samples. And like, pens and stuff. Anyawy, i'm a little apprehensive about all the responsibility involved with sex...but we'll see how it goes. Oh, and here's to being done with Junior year for real for real. <3 Sam P.S. did you know Nicole Milelr desiggnd fashionable compacts for your Pill? So cool! Personalpak.com

      Wow. I've been so busy, I haven't had a chance to jot everything down...but It was the best weekend ever! Ian finally got out here, and we had such a blast. First, we came out ( i came with him...from the airport...from florida...grandfather is not looking so hot, but that's abother story) and we shopped out way out, and saw the big duck...I'll post a picture when he e-mails them. Then we hung out, and had dinner in Sag Harbor, and went to this party kind of by North Haven/Sag Harbor...it was so utterly random. We pull up, I knew one kid, Ian knew zero, and within 15 minutes we're playing enver have I ever and beer pong while Schuyler's mom hands out Coronas and suddenly this cop comes and everyone kinda moves away from teh beer and the cop's like, "hey Kids!" and it's like Schuyler's fam friend or aomething and anyway it was just WEIRD. But hysterical.    So that was friday. Saturday, Ian and my dad went and played tennis for like, 5 hours. I was bored but male bonding...cute. The weather was shit-ttyyy but we beached it anyway, just kinda looked at the clouds rolling over the ocean...his third time in the Atlantic ocean ever...hehe. Dinner at our friend's house, and then...then...we went back to the beach at dark...and...let's just say that that drink 'sex on the beach' better be amazing because its namesake...wow. Yeah.    Moving on to Sunday, we went to town, ran around, did some other boring shit, visited my restaurant and got lunch for the three of us, then like midday my mom finally came home (she was catering a party in jerz) oh and i forgot to mentiojn the whole weekend we ate tons of bread. Ian's mom baked us like 3 loaves of challah and foccacia and biscotti and all this other amazingh shit. So she came home, and we were still bored but the weather was a little nicer, so we drove to another beach, and suddenly it was so gorgeous! but we had no towels and we were fully dressed and shit. So all of a sudden (the beach only had a few people on it...) I'm like, "Fuck it" and i tossed all my clothes on the sand and jumped in! It was freezing, adn that was sooo un-sami. He did it too and we had a blast. But i Might have pnemonia.&nbsp;So then we came home showered and got all dressed up (haha) and went out to dinner with Molly and Elliot, her boyfriend, who are both really cool, and we got this big sushi boat and it was a blast. Then we went back to Elliot's. Elliot has a pool house. 'nuff said.    He had to leave Monday, like 2 ish,. it was tres sad.&nbsp;Whatever, it was an amazing weekend. He should live here more often. I am so freaking tired it' not even funny. So, I went back to work and blah-di-blah blah. I just have to add this story for Margaux's sake. there are these two girls who work in my restaurant at the pizza counter...little loacls, spanish girls, like 14 and 15 years old. So alst night they're running all around and whispering and making a big deal out of something, and I find out that they have just purchased their first pot froim the chef, Julio. (He's nuts.) One of them got like $15 worth adn teh other got $20. Anywway they're flipping out from nerves/excitement blah blah blah. The most hysterical part is, they&nbsp;have no idea how to smoke it. Whatsoever. They're running around asking people to roll it for them! So they beg me to help them, and as much as you guys know I won't touch the shit, I've lived with margaux long enough to know how to be resourceful. I asked them to get me an orange, apple, inhaler, water bottle, starbuck's gum tin...(kidding) but they're like, 'Whoa! You can do all that! Shit muthafucka!!!" They're really local. and young. it's hysterical. So at one point one of them runs up to me with a sheet of that waxy paper tehy uise in pizza boxes, to absorb oil,a nd she's like, can we use this?! I look her straight in the eye, like, "Tanya. This paper, when burned, will emit toxic fumes. Seeing as I do not like working in&nbsp;the front of the restaurant, I Dont' really want you to DIE before tomorrow!" Finally out of the goodness of my heart I drew them a margaux-esque diagram aof the water bottle contraption. good thing you trained me right, Marg. God, that was an escapade.   I guess nothing that new to report ova hya...I just miss home, and I've been thinking a lot about school and stuff. JEsus...seniors?! And my mom had a breakdown as that this was my last year really living at home. Am I supposed to be doing FOCUS work? College essays?! WHY DONT THEY GIVE US INSTRUCTION?! Somebody write back or something.

      Kristy doll, your journal entry so perfectly captures ADP that I stole the whole thing. Here is Kristy's take on ADP:  &nbsp; Tuesday, July 06, 2004  ...So just a recap on my 2 weeks in St. Louis since i had no time to fill you in while i was there... so&nbsp;here we go:  The first day i meet sam, who apparently was stalking me and knew i was the girl in the blue jacket... lol... and we hung out/ got to know each other... then we met hannah and immediately broke away from the large group... Then we go downstairs and ray comes over... and decides to form "the clique"... i knew ray would be so much fun to hang out with from the first moment we met him... he was so outgoing and loud, which was a good first impression.. so then we picked up some other randoms... including Ty... who has the all-time best accent ever &nbsp;.. especially when saying "Dont ya know"... Basically, we had such a fun time... and so many good memories.. the only sucky part was studio where no one talked and there were some disputes about the type of music that would be listened to... and classical did not win that vote.  So we definately had some fun times... like the baseball game (i guess you had to be there to see Sam and Ray being totally crazy, bowling with sandy's random commet... good one and me winning all of the bowling matches and beating everett by like a 100 points (yeah that did happen), ping pong, swimming, stealing Ty's shoes and watching sam fall, the walks back, definately the City museum, and the tours with the old guys... i guess the people there were just so awesome...  Im just now realizing how much im gonna miss the random things about ADP... sam exposing her cleavage (and getting a whole section in the slideshow for it),&nbsp; hannah's random stories, everett's singing and dancing, carlos' spanish translating/ making fun of my eye , dave and max being hilarious, the random kid.. haha..., everyone in studio getting pissed off, my cool roommates, taylor's dancing, graham's randomness, NINI, and i might just miss ray's comments about paris/ his grandmother... wow, hard to think i would miss that...  You guys really need to visit delaware/ meet me in the hampton's when i visit sam... and call/ im me all the time  Definately when you find out where you're going to college, hit me up because i might just be coming too... you never know ... wash u? virginia? miami?... i could be coming to a town near you...  And we are definately having a reunion... maybe in new york, or st. louis, maybe even the arch where we can get in the eggs again... and prepare beforehand... good times I

       Wow, crazy week. At least I wasn't waitressing... on Monday, i got to see Molly, who i missed sooo much it was crazy. It's kind of cool because even thought she and Elliot seem to be having 'issues' right this moment, they're the kind of thing that I can totally relate to. We bonded even more, if that's even possible. :) Then Monday night I got to sleep in my own bed....oh, it's been almost a month...it was delicious. and then, even more delicious, I got to see Ian tues-weds-thurs. Kickass! I shopped in my mall on Tuesday- i totally had mall withdrawl. I wanted to chill with A-sex-a but she works at EMS until hours where Ian was monopolizing me. He worke din the mornings too. Soon, lexy babe, we'll chiznill. oh, btw, Anchorman = hysterical, go see it. Hmm...oh, and we had delicious sushi. Another thing I missed in ol' St. Louie. Then Wednesday was adventure day. It was raining like CRAZY in the city, I thought we were going to drown! Just kidding. But it was raining.&nbsp;A Lot. But it was the shitty "Fooled you!" kidn that comes and goes, so when it was gorgeous out, we snagged scalped tickets to Ben/Rufus/Guster in the park,  urlLink http://www.livedaily.com/news/6452.html &nbsp;but then the skies opened up and we had to leave, which SUCKED. But it was still an adventure. I love adventures. Oh, and crazy props to random man ont he street who gave us (we were literally dripping and shivering- I 100% am getting pnemonia in a second) his umbrella, as he told Ian, to "Keep his lady dry." How sweet?! I love New Yorkers.

      It's official: I am the world's biggest flirt. I worked a 12-hour shift today at the restaurant (by the way: best part of working at restaurant = free food. My chef, Julio, amde me the most amazing dinner. And 3 cappucinos. haha. Worst part of working at restaurant = working at restaurant.) Anyway i spent those 12 hours flirting and figuring it out. I guess I'm just a flirty person...like, seriously, today I flirted with three puppies- an 8-week old rottweiler to DIE for, and some othher drop kick pups...and this little baby girl who looked like Amelie, pint-sized, and another one with huge blue eyes...and I always flirt with the tiny boys. They're so fun,a nd crayons are like candy in a restaurant. And then I flirt with the parents, you know, like, "Your baby is adorable!" And it's not even sucking up because I didn't waitress, so it's not my tip. (I bussed...it sucked.) Of course, there's the conventional flirting, i.e., Arch Boy, etc., and those jackasses 23-year olds tonight fromt eh city ("Are you taking any pizza home tonight? "Only if you're pizza!" No joke. Ew.) but I mean, flirting is just kind of... a way of living. I like to flirt with life. Forgive me, those I love, You do still have my full attention.

       The initial Explanation:  Ty = Tyler Thorsen, blonde cutie from Moorhead (haha!) Minnesota. We dubbed him "Soda," pronounced with strong Minnesotan accent, for obvious reasons. HE says "about" like "aboot" which for some reason is really cute, and he sounds like Bobby's Mom from Bobby's world (Don'tcha know now Bobby!) Anyway, pictures to follow, obviously, but he's a charmer and we hit it off like crazy.  Now the middle: (excerpted from an E-mail.)  Wait, maybe at this point i should explain about me and Ty. Okay, so, first of all, I have a boy at home who i'm totally in love with - we've been dating for over a year. (Ian, duh.) Also, Ty has a girlie at home, a recent girl, but a girl nonetheless. At any rate, we hit it off as friends at first, and then we realized that we could kind of fill in the affection that we were both missing from home, so we turned into like dummy-boy/girl-friends-at-home. ish. But then we kinda tested the boundaries of that and ended up liking each other a lot more than we were supposed to, i guess, so now we're just...awkwardly best friends? i guess? Soooo while we are not really having a long distance relationship, it still is one, just...yeah.   And the REAL story:   He slept in my bed every night. It sounds weird, but it really wasn't...we were that tight. Ian was kinda miffed, but i explained everythning. Oh, and the most physical we got was when he kissed me because he, "Couldn't help it!" No tongues, relax. The follow up...we talk almost every day, and he's a really awesome friend to have. He's debating at home whether or not to stay with his girl, because his feelings are kinda tossed up. My loyalties lie at home- SO proud I didn't do anything drastic! but He wants to come to NY in early August....hm. I guess we'll see where that goes, eh? (btw: pictures at picturetrail.com...member name is ADP04.)

      I kind of just realized how ranom that last entry is going to seem to those of you folowing along at home. At any reate, I've decided to actually try this blog shit out, so here goes nothing. What's today? July 7th? I got back from ADP - Architecture Dsicovery Program - July 3rd. What a trip. It was crazy intesnse, more so than outsiders can get the gist of, but more fun than I've had in a long time. Staying up til 4 am cutting up pieces of balsa wood may sound tedious to y'all, but duh, it's Sami heaven. The two biggest things that happened get their own entires - one was arch boy, and one is Ty. I'll post that one next. But all these crazy little odd things happened, too. Like, I got drunk at a baseball game. So un-sami, right? but fuuuun! And, that time those two guys asked me to be in their movie, and handed me a script and their e-mail addresses. And that random fat guy in the Mo Bo G (missouri botanical gardens) that took pics of me int aht fountain. Odd. And Turle, the hot frat boy with the shaved chest, who invited us to his keg party. What fun, un-samish times. Guys, i am totally ready to break out. I can't believe you did all that clubbing shit without me. Oh, and Margaux, I have shower stories, too. Let me go write the Ty entry.

      Wow! So much has happened in the past few days that I haven't even been online. Ice cream and late-night beach visits with Schuyler and co, partying at Katie's in Shelter island with Mattie (a whole lotta Mattie) and Kareem, making tons of $$$ off the August Hamptons crowd (i       Hm...so...only one short week 'til I get to head home, even if it's just for a little. Let's have some shout-outs: One for Margraux, who's probably flipping out about her impending visitor...but still hasn't called/e-mailed/me back. One for Alexa, who has a new addition to her cosmetics case collection (wink.) One for everyone else, because I'm lazy. I was so bored today that I actually did some FOCUS bullshit and filled out an application. I am dreading the essays and stuff. I'm gonna get rejected big time. BCC, here i come! Okay, more later.
