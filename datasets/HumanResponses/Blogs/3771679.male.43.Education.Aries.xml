      Mom and Dad, tell us about your first homes when you were both kids (your earliest recollections). Each of you can tell us ...  Where was your home, how big was it, did you have a furnace and an air conditioner, did you have indoor plumbing and toilet paper, did you have a phone, a TV, a refrigerator, what kind of stove, did you live on a farm or in the city, what chores did you do, did you sleep in your own bed and have your own room, how many brothers and sisters did you have at that time (name them please), and any fond memories of that first home, any special happenings (fun, scary, exciting, wierd,etc.) and anything you'd like to share, etc.? Just tell us as much as you can about your first homes.   Then, for the relatives (Mom's and Dad's immediate families), what are your perspectives with the same questions related to Mom's and Dad's first homes?

      I have been talking with Mom and Dad (Ken and Helen Bushey) in the past months about getting down in writing, on CD, or on video, stories about their childhood. As I am getting older (now 43 as of this posting), I realize that so much information known only to my folks and relatives from their generation about our family is  unknown  to my kids and even to my brothers, sisters, and me! So, I've been trying to figure out a way to get it down for posterity in the limited time I have (with family, church,  urlLink Initial Images ,  urlLink Neighborhood Christian School , staying in shape, etc.).  I thought that with the advent of the Internet and blogging, a solution has presented itself! I hope many of our relatives will also find this avenue the way to go.   What I have in mind is to pose a question about an event or time period and then have everyone respond from their perspective. With this, we'll be able to get viewpoints from all over the place and be able to compile an awesome historical perspective of our family.    (Remember ... these postings will be on the Internet and open to everyone in the world. Also, this will not be a place to air grievances, but to save those great memories we have of our families. These memories may not always be joyful ones, we want to also remember the times of sorrow from losing a loved one, or those times of anxiety when someone was sick, hurt, or going off to war. But let's not let this become a place to vent animosity you might have against another family member -- deal with the person directly on that and get the air cleared soon for both of your benefits!)  I don't see why the blog postings should be limited in scope, either. That is to say, if you and/or your family relates to the event, time period, topic, etc., then let's hear from anyone related, not just immediate family or those most directly involved. You don't have to have the last name of Bushey to post to this, but a relation to someone in our genealogy tree is necessary (if I don't know you personally, you'll need to tell me how you're related to keep your posting listed --- this will keep this blog focused on our Bushey family ongoing history).  Well, let's try to get this started and see where it goes! Look for the first topic posted after this one!  Enjoy and may God bless you!  Chris Bush√©y
