      Hi everyone  Well, Luke, you've guilt tripped me into updating you, and everyone else, as to what's going on in my life right now.  Where to start? I guess chronologically...  This sunday will mark two weeks since I bought a laptop. I've been wanting one for a long time, and I got a sweet deal on a Toshiba A65-S126 package. I got the laptop, a "free" Lexmark Z715 printer, a "free" laptop carry bag and a "free" 256 MB RAM upgrade in the deal.  The following monday, I came to work and jinxed myself. I said to my coworker: "Watch, now that I spent a good chunk of money on a laptop, something's going to happen to my car...the engine's going to blow, or something, I just know it." -- I'm not joking, I said this.  Now, on to my car, or should I say my old car. It got crunched on friday the 13th arond 8:30pm by a 2002 Ford Pick-up. I'll try to upload a pic below (when I get home from work) for those who haven't seen one yet. It's been declared a total loss. They estimated about 4000 in damages...Mel and I were/are ok. Just some sore necks and backs for a few days. We were driving on a road about to make a left hand turn. Two lane road, no traffic lights, no oncoming traffic, no stop sign, 55 mph speed limit, double yellow line down the middle. Mel slows to make the left hand turn, the car behind slows down with us, the pick up behind the car was lighting his cigarette. He looked up, realized he was going to rear-end the car in between us, and jerked his truck into the oncoming traffic lane. Well, we were still in the process of turning. He crunched the driver's side, back quarter panel, from the tire to a few inches beside the license plate on the back, and spun us around into the grass. We had no idea what happened...anyways, the picture should help with my explanation. As far as I know, he ended up with a cracked grill. Maybe a dent or two on his bumper, I didn't look at his truck after the accident.  Anyone know anyone who's selling a 98 or 99 eclipse GST or GSX?  :)  And the third bit of news I have is that I am being flown to Raleigh, North Carolina for a job interview this coming Wednesday. I fly out of rochester at 6am, and return to rochester at 10pm the same day. The company is Aeroglide Corporation. The job is for an Electrical Engineer, designing and drafting electrical control panels for their systems, as well as programming PLCs (programmable logic controllers) and some other minor EE things. I'm excited, I hope it goes well. I think I'm the favourite for the job - that's what the recruiter tells me at least. I'll keep you all updated. (This blog beats sending numerous emails!)  Well, time to get back to pretending to work...  Jon

      Hey everyone, I am off to the arctic again. I will be leaving Kingston at 0500 on Saturday August 21st, and returning on the 4th of September. This time I am going to a site called FOX Main, which is located at Hall Beach. In the map below you can see Hall Beach directly below the second U in the word Nunavut. I will try to keep in contact and let you guys know how I am doing. Apparently there is a pool table and a sauna and a workout room, so I will try to work on my hand eye coordination and get buff in the short time that I will be there. I may need that workout room, because from everything everyone is telling me, the food there is amazing and fattening, so I could be in trouble. Oh well, I hope everyone is doing well.  Talk to you all again soon

      well, here is the first posting.  I kept seeing things on the internet about blogs and not having a clue what they were  so I looked into it.   This one is through google, so it should be quality.  Anyway, it is a place that you can write thoughts, share information, links, pictures, anything.  I figured it would be cool to set this up for anyone and everyone that has lived at/stayed at 515 Johnson, as well as family, friends, significant others, et cetera to keep in contact and keep up to date and to share information and pictures, and links and all the rest of it.

      Courtney is saying "duh" right now, but I didn't know where this word came from.   To make a long story short: say "Web log" out loud. There you go, blog became a word.
