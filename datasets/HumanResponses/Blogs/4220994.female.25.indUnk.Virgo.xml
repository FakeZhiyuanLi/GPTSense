      Another day goes by, life deals out more crap and I am sick and tired of it! Well at least I am more normal then this lady: urlLink http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~author/ . Not that I am in any position to judge anybody else. But I do think that believing Garth Brooks is your past lover is a little strange. I don't think I believe in reincarnation, but who really knows what lies beyond our earthbound selves. As a matter of fact if reincarnation is true, I don't want to know it. To know that everything I have experienced, every lesson I have learned, every emotion I feel will be washed away into a new life is heartbreaking. I want to keep my memories, all the little "life moments" I have tucked away inside me. And forget me ever being excited about doing this whole life thing over again. Once is tiring enough! I do not even pretend to know what is on the "other side" but I believe it is better then here and now. Do you believe in reincarnation?

      As a nurse, I am faced with death or dying at least weekly. This closeness to death has always made me curious to what death brings. I won't get into any religous beleifs here, but I will say that the study of death (thanatology) intrigues me. I have always felt like I can  feel  death. I am on this depressing subject because of an  experience today. On the way to work I passed a very bad accident, I felt death all around me. I have felt anxious since then. Living in a small town word of mouth travels faster then the newspaper has chance to report it, and I heard that the man in one truck did die. Which has contributed to my uneasiness that I have felt since passing the accident. I often brush off the "feeling of death" and tell myself that I am nuts, but hearing that there was a death makes me uncomfortable with knowing that maybe I did  feel  it. It reminded me of that scene in The Sixth Sense, where the boy and the mom are behind traffic at a car accident and the little boy says, "mom someone died in the accident" and the mother asks him why he says that and he says "she is standing by the window". ok now that I have myself all freaked out and all of you out there telling yourselves how much of a freak I am, here is something kinda funny. My sister sent me this link for The-Link-O-the-Day:  urlLink Geroge Bush's Blog

      To continue one of my favorite aspects of my old blog...My link of the day. Most usually these are dumb links to awful websites, funny websites or just plain odd. Todays link is pretty amusing to me. If your in the market for a  used  blow up doll, then too bad you missed the auction! A friend sent this one to me.  Link-O-The_Day urlLink eBay item 5501862293 (Ends Jun-20-04 06:42:00 PDT) - Realdoll by Abyss Creations Body-5/Head-4

      After many frustrating hours of being ready to throw the laptop out of the window, I finally got my site working with CSS. I love how CSS makes everything so clean and prevents all the extra typing of tables.   Two more days and my little brother leaves for college. I can't believe he is old enough to go off to college. I know I will miss him terrible. From the time he was very little I have always mothered him and spoiled him. So now he is going to run off into the big scary world without me to protect him. It is depressing. I will cry I am sure :0)  Which brings me to my next rant. I overheard someone tell someone else, "Well my mother always told me that happiness doesn't come to you, you have to go out and find your own happiness." Now exactly what moron finds this to be great wisdom? Where exactly is this happiness lurking that one can go find it? I would like to know. As a long time sufferer of major depression I am going to be pissed if all along I could have went and found happiness lurking under a bush somewhere. What do you think, can you just go out and find happiness?? (and yes I know this is just a figure of speech, just wondered if anybody else found it as absurd as me)

      Well first it was, livejournal, then Angelfire, then Xanga, now back to blogger.  I hated livejournal, I could never quite get used to posting in it and the look was boring, Angelfire just plain sucks so don't waste your time with that. Xanga is ok if you wanna pay for it. Blogger seems to be the most user friendly and I love that i can click on my handy little google toolbar to post. Yay! I love google.
