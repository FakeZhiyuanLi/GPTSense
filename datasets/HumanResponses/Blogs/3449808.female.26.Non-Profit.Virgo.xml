      This is my very first blog entry, inspired by Bryan's brilliant Funion and Jill's brand new blog!  Not having done this before, cut me some slack...  So here I am at the Reference Desk at a small "corporate library"* in Boston. It is a peculiar place, this library.  Basically, I work with a very cool group of people who have bonded together in the most heinous of environments.  Lately things have been particularly bad with lay-offs and "reorganization" for the "building of a sustainable model".    Now I have worked at some questionable places (one of which required me to dress up like a 17th century Pilgrim), but I have never worked for a church-gone-corporate before.  It presents some interesting "challenges" and "opportunities" - and by "challenges" I mean denial and by "opportunities" I mean guilt trips.  It's a sad day indeed when you can't publicly take an aspirin without your boss shaking her head.    To lighten the mood, here are some amusing quotes that have been said to me, or near me, by fellow co-workers (and will be said by my friend Jen on her wedding night):  FIRST PLACE Boss: "Yup, rode the big black guy all weekend!" (ok, this was in response to someone asking her if she went horseback riding that weekend - thank god I caught the beginning of that conversation!)  SECOND PLACE FW: "Kate, have you ever felt like your cat was trying to have sex with you?" (there really is no context that will help this quote)  THIRD PLACE: As I am taking cough syrup in the kitchen, a fellow co-worker comes in, shakes her head and says condescendingly, "Oh Kate, you need to think ' the  thought'"  HONORABLE MENTIONS: XXXXX: "Hi, my name is XXXXXX, I was prosecuted in New Mexico for killing my daughter"  Kate: "Ummm, Hi.  Would you like to be a Friend of the Library?"  Visitor: "Are you a practitioner?  You are so wonderful to have "healed" me of the meaning of the word 'fun'!"  Kate: "Oh my gosh   look at the clouds outside, I think it is going to storm!" Boss: "Of course it is!  The Board is making a VERY important decision right now!"  Melis: " , I think I may blow off the Mass Ave bridge on the way home." Boss: "You need to hold on to an anchor.  Hold on to Kate!"  Boss: "I can't believe your baby picture Kate.  I chose the fattest one as you!"  An Email from Acting Boss: "Facilities has come to take your chairs for an event.  They will return them tomorrow.  Sorry for the incontinence"  CEO: "'Department' is from the French, of course it would be, meaning to divide."  CEO in a staff meeting following layoffs (with those that were laid off sitting in the room): "Well, we have laid off 12 full-time people.  But we will be hiring 6 more people.  So really, we have only had a net loss of six."   Fellow co-workers, please feel free to write in and add to the list...As I will be when I remember more.   *all quoted material denotes office lingo

      So I was watching Office Space last night and I have decided that I am Peter Gibbons...all that is left for me to do is bring in a drill and knock down my cubicle walls.  What a brilliant movie.  I must thank Bryan for calling it to my attention.  I know that everyone can relate to it because it pretty much describes all work environments in the corporate world, but I have to say, it does bare a shocking resemblance to the library.  Throw in some Science and Healths on the cubicles and change TPS reports to CSBD reports and you are there!  Here are some amusing quotes that have kept me laughing all day:  "It seems like you've been missing a lot of work lately"  "I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob!"   "It's not that I'm lazy. It's that I just don't care." - Peter  "You see, ever since I started working at Initech, everyday has been worse than the day before it. So that means that everyday that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life." - Peter   "When I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled, that and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired." - Peter  And Peter's answer to the interviewers' questions:  "I start the day by spacing out. . . . Yeah, I'd say that I do a total of 15 minutes of good work during the course of a week."   Bob Slydel: "The pleasure's all on this side of the table"  Peter: "Good luck with your lay-offs alright. I hope your firings go really well"     The bitterness parade is back on route.    So, I had a nice trip to Virginia with my sister and her family.  We went and visited this small village near the borders of West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.  My sister's boyfriend (who is originally from Northern Ireland) was amazed that we could drive for 11 hours and still only get to Virginia.  I was just amazed that we could drive for 11 hours with two 6 month old babies in the car!  I kept telling my sister, "don't worry - we outnumber them.  ALWAYS outnumber your children on vacations..."  Because we had the babies, we were somewhat limited in our sightseeing.  We had a nice picnic lunch at the Virginia State University Botanical Gardens.  And that same day we went to Harper's Ferry.  What a gorgeous area of the country!  Harper's Ferry is nestled right in the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers.  The town is pretty touristy, but it does remind me of a European village.    I have to say, amongst all of that beauty, we did spot one of the worst fashion victims I have ever encountered in all my years as a Fashion Police Officer.  As Sophia from the Golden Girls would say, "picture this", Harper's Ferry 2004.  It was a hot and humid day.  A portly, middle-aged man leans on the railing overlooking the rivers.  Tragically, he sports see-through, capri-length white spandex pants.  His T-shirt is tucked in.  The vivid, zebra stripes of his briefs gleam in the sunshine.  Shock and horror overwhelms the crowd.  People pose for pictures next to him in the hopes that they will catch this train wreck on a digital camera.  One of these pictures will be posted soon. :)  Anyway, so of course, probably because of the fashion horrors I witnessed, I was completely ill that evening and have still not really recovered.  But that did not stop us from catching a tour of our nation's capitol.  I had never been to DC before.  I am glad that we just took a general tour of the city because we could have been there for days just seeing the Smithsonian, never mind the monuments and parks.  The city seemed much smaller and more concentrated than I expected, but I might have felt differently had I been walking around.  I was surprised when the tour guide said that on average, 25-30 servicemen are buried in Arlington National Cemetery Monday - Friday.  What a solemn and thought-provoking place to visit.  Speaking of which, on the way home from Virginia we drove through the Gettysburg battlefield.  A lovely spot in Pennsylvania for such an horrific 72 hours of our history.    So there ends my history lesson for today children.  Aside from my sister losing the ability to count American money and Jeremy having a language barrier in Pennsylvania (the Irish-Southern language gap is extensive!), the ride home was long but uneventful.    And now I am back at work for a few days, biding my time for my next vacation which begins in 1 day.  I know, I know...poor me (beat you to it anonymous!).  Classifieds... Happy belated birthday Heather!  Thirty-four days, 1 hour and thirty-six minutes to go.  Get well Kristie!  We are thinking of you...

      BREAKING NEWS: I caught "anonymous"!  We can sleep at night now.    I have been harassed to post something today, and yet I have very little to tell you all.  The only mildly interesting thing that happened this weekend was the couple that nearly (and when I say nearly I mean it really was just a technicality that they didn't) had sex in the bar on Saturday.  It was like a train wreck - you just had to look!  They were literally eating each other at the bar while all of their friends sat the next table and watched.  And before you ask what kind of places I frequent, it was in the financial district - not "the combat zone" (as my parents refer to some of the more shady parts of Boston).  In any case, the bouncers eventually caught on and booted the couple out of the bar, along with their friend who had completely passed out on the table.  End of show - no encore.    In other news, my entire family (including all 6 nieces and nephews) will be in the same place tomorrow for the first time ever.  That shouldn't be mayhem at all - especially as 3 of them are 6 months and under.  Stay tuned for more special reports.      HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIGS!  Well done!

      Ok first of all, "anonymous",  while I appreciate you characterizing me as someone who would end up in my brother's book, I must question your idea of romance.  My gay best friend, my sister and her two 6 month-old twins (and HER boyfriend) do not qualify in my book as "romantic".  I am enjoying your bitterness towards life however.  If I didn't know any better, I would think you were a proud employee of MBELDE.  If you will excuse me, I must get back to my email, IM and coffee.

      This is the end (finally!) of the first countdown week.  I am enjoying being (as Laura calls it) "On Her Way Out The Door Kate", where I can really just say anything and not worry about the consequences.    The following is a comprehensive list of today's activities at work: Email  IM Making coffee Writing my blog Dealing with the latest Lane family drama Lunch where we discussed yesterday's layoffs Talking to Mary about how happy we are about leaving (Congrats Mary!) Checking the news (so SAD about the hostage!) Copying and pasting 4 numbers into an excel spreadsheet Email Making Tea Talking about the Red Sox and how Barry Bonds sucks (Nicole would like me to tell you that she thinks he is an ASS) Starting a list of things I do at work for my soon-to-be-sorry replacement Checking Jill's Blog Filing some paper Hot Syncing my palm pilot Shutting down my computer  Christ Jesus I can't wait for this weekend!  Not only do I resume weekly brunches with Jerry (where we reorganize our families, work and world affairs over omelets, pancakes and coffee) but on Sunday, my sister and her family arrive from England.  The last time I saw the twins they were very "wee" so I am excited to see how they have grown.  My sister and I get along very well (because we are both "very hurtful"*) and we always have a good laugh.  Yeah for amusing siblings!  Her boyfriend, Jeremy, is equally as amusing and has an interesting perspective on my family - almost a "psychological study"* I would say.  He studied through the 80s*.      *denotes family jokes which may only be amusing if you know the Lanes

      How is it only Wednesday?  I feel like this has been the longest week of my life.  Things at work are very weird.  At the moment, I have people ignoring me.  I can't decide whether that is because they are mad at me for leaving them, or because they don't actually believe I will be leaving.  No one has really come up to me to start transferring work - which will be interesting because even though I technically gave 4 weeks notice, I am on vacation for 1 of those weeks.  Time's awasting people!  I am starting to get the guilt trips from the boss about how much work I do and how hard it will be to find someone to do it all.  Thankfully, I am a master of avoiding guilt trips.  These people need to learn how to do them properly like my mother who calls every week to tell me that she saw my face on a milk carton or to ask me why I am in the witness protection program.  Anyway, of course the middle and senior management want to sit down with me to discuss why I am leaving and how what I say can help the rest of the staff.  Hmmmm....yes, because I am so sure that NONE of the 75 people that have come and gone from work in my 3 years here have EVER tried to do that before.  And of course what they had to say was taken to heart - or shredded.  Whatever. You will all be happy to know that the "mixed emotions" I had in the past two days about leaving have now been replaced by my usual bitterness.  All is right with the world again.  In any case, enough about work.  I went to see the movie Saved! last night and damn it was hilarious.  This could NOT have been a better week to see that movie. First of all, it was a movie about teenagers so I was bound to like it (even if it didn't have Pacey from Dawson's Creek in it!).  Secondly, it was about born-again Christian teens - so HOW could it NOT be funny?!  Mandy Moore (I can't believe I am saying this) was really good, as was Macaulay Culkin.  I highly recommend seeing it.  Of course, I will have to see it again just so that I can memorize the quotes from it. "Who's down with G-O-D?"

      Ok, ok already!!  I am being urged to post an update.  I did indeed quit yesterday.  It was sad.  I know that sounds strange as I have been dreaming about it for months now - but it is done now.  Of course there was a flurry of activity when I quit.  The COO had to meet with me to discuss why and to tell me that she felt things were on the verge of changing.  I am a very optimistic person - but even  I  can't wait around for that to happen!  In any case, I am so relieved that it will all be over soon so my sense of humor can return once again.  And I am sure you all are looking forward to the day when I am not complaining about work!

      Well, this certainly has been an eventful week.  Most of the week I have had the pleasure of staying in Hotel Corey, my "desperately tragic" house-sitting assignment - and by "desperately tragic" I mean OH MY GOD I could live here.  I have spent the day lounging on the deck, reading a book and petting the dog...put a margharita in my hand and I would think I was in the South Seas not Winter Hill! :)    BREAKING NEWS:  I am happy to announce that the day has finally come - I am about to be set free from my current state of employment.  Friday I was offered a job at a real academic think tank - where I might actually use my brain for a change.  I have been dreaming about giving my notice for about a year now.  And on the eve of this impending public announcement, I am finding myself a bit nervous.  The place in which I work is not exactly known for its acceptance and support.  I have these visions of rampant denial and passive aggression (of course, that is not that different from the every day work envirionment).   Needless to say, I will be reporting a play by play this week of  the events that ensue...   Congratulations Sarah and Ed on your engagement!!!

      I write while sitting in the glorious invention of air conditioning on a 90 degree day here in Boston.  The only way it could be hotter is if I were outside in 4 layers of wool pilgrim clothes baking bread (sadly I know this from experience!).  I used to love these days when I worked at Plimoth Plantation (a first-person interpretation of 1627 New England for those of you that are not from around here).  I would be SO hot that I would almost be melting...and my mother would come to visit me with a large ICED coffee, chewing ice in my face.  Ahhh, the memories.  Anyway, I decided that I had to respond to the anonymous commentary that was left on my site a few days ago re. my college reunion.  I just had to say that OF COURSE I see it through beer-goggles (M. Vassar having been a brewer for god's sake!).  And of COURSE I find the same people annoying.  But they are just a little less irritating now that we are 5 years out and have better things to worry than what susie said and what juan (poder latino) was wearing.  I could have written about the knock-down, drag-out brawl that happened on the floor of the dorm I was staying in on Saturday night, but for once I decided not to spill the goods (though plenty of other people did that night!).  So, to quote Forest, "that is all I have to say about that."  Oh, and I have had a lot of people asked about what happened to the pugs...basically they were murdered.  I came back from work after a long weekend to a folder on the server full of pictures.  They had been all over the plaza.  They went swimming in the reflecting pool, were run over by the Mapparium Mobile, served in our cafe, etc etc.  Then I came to work the next day to a severed head in a see-through plastic box.  I must say, the organizers of this hoax were geniuses...I laughed out loud (which is shocking for where I work!). So I put police tape around the box, and then I was told to remove the head etc all together because it was "disturbing the employees".  IT IS A STUFFED DOG PEOPLE.  Anyway, thus ended the only funny thing that has ever happened in the office.  The End  p.s. For those of you concerned with the destruction of personal property, the conspirators actually went out and bought another pug to destroy.  Mine came back safe and sound.  I do work for a church for heaven's sake!

      Well, I have returned from my first reunion from college.  It was completely NOT what I expected at all.  I had wondered for months how it would be - and now I can safely say that I have survived!  Not only was the campus even more beautiful than I remembered (with the help of 200 million dollars for renovations), but my fellow classmates were embued with the spirit of comraderie, letting bygones be bygones (of course copious amounts of alcohol always help!).  I was fascinated at the scene from The Mug (the campus "night club"), where suddenly, completely ignoring school day animosity and clique-i-ness, everyone was your best friend.  "OH MY GOD, HOW are you doing?  *HUG* What are you doing now?  REALLY?  WOW!  I'm going to get a drink now, I will catch up with you later!"  This display was usually followed by me asking whoever was next to me, "Who the hell is that person?"   It made me think about a lot of things.  About how even the most ANNOYING people from school (you know who you are! :)) have something in common with you.  We all chose the same school - even if not for the same reasons.  And because we were away from the stress of school and jobs, it was so easy to slip right back into the utopia of college days (minus the stress of school work of course!).  Even the people that I once called the "beautiful people" (i.e. sticks-up-their-arse) were friendly and normal - especially those that I NEVER would have said a word to in college.  In any case, I had a fantastic time seeing old friends, repairing old friendships and meeting former classmates.  When I get the pictures in, I will be sure to post some - merely to remind me of how good I had it!!! :)

      I have been horrible at blogging this week and I actually have no excuse.  I could blame the DNC (Democratic National Convention) like everyone else this week, but the secret service has not determined that my laptop is a special security event and Mayor Mumbles Menino has not closed down any roads around my bedroom (though that would explain a few things), so I can offer no explanation for my blatant disregard for your need to know about my personal life.   Thousands of people come to Boston and the residents of the city have fled!!  The streets are empty on my way to work.  Even with all of the roads from here to California closed, it has been no inconvenience for me.  And what people watching!  I feel like this convention should be called Kennedyfest 2004.  135 Kennedys are here, first to dedicate the Rose "I hated my children" Kennedy Park, and then to pay homage to Teddy "Lady Killer" Kennedy.  Not a fan of Massachusetts royal family obviously.  While I don't really like watching the convention on tv, I am enjoying reading the transcripts of the speeches (without all of the fanfare and celebrity distraction - though I did watch Kerry's speech last night Jill!!).  There have been some interesting points made.  It will be a hard choice for me in November.  I have definitely enjoyed all of the political humor that surrounds this event.  For example: www.starspangledicecream.com  And now back to the station... The following things have happened since I last wrote:  Friday: Kristie's Memorial Drinks session complete with a vodka gimlet in her honor! I am sure she was laughing her ass off at us, but it was great to get together and talk about her.  I miss her.  Saturday: Girls night in with Marilyn, Nadine, and season 3 of Dawson's Creek.  My love for Pacey continues.  He is now number 4 in my top 10 ideal men in movies and literature.  Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones Diary, Gilbert in Anne of Green Gables, and Mr. Knightley in Emma are the top 3 in case you were interested.    Sunday: Sox game with Alaine at a Somerville watering hole.  What a game!  They played against the Devil (Yankees), beating them of course.  I am kicking myself that I did not see the game the day before because there was an out and out brawl between Varitek and ARod.  God I hate the Yankees. I hate them more than the meatheads that were skeeving on us at the bar.   And now I am gearing up for another wild weekend - appropriately beginning with Jen's bachelorette party hosted by myself and Jill.  I just hope that she is prepared for the mayhem.  I fear for her *insert evil laughter*.  I will be sure to let you know how it goes and perhaps post any (in)appropriate photos for your amusement.  Classifieds: Happy Birthday Eleanor!  I miss you guys.   Congrats to any notice givers I may know.  God I wish I could be a fly on the wall. :)

      So this evening I went out for Happy Hour for the first time with my new co-workers.&nbsp; Not as lively as the last bunch, but there is still that same seed of revolution.&nbsp; It was nice to actually speak with people.&nbsp; My office is in the back of the building in a little nook of the second floor.&nbsp; No one comes in there except for my boss, who does so only twice a day.&nbsp; So this evening I met a few of the "cool" people in the office (I sound like I work in Dawson's Creek!).&nbsp; We have a few people just out of college, so for once I am not the youngest one in the office.&nbsp; They were discussing the "ways of the cube" this evening - how people have such strange conversations outside their cube and look at their computers when the walk by (etc).&nbsp; One of these girls has a cube right by the printers and copiers - just like I used to - so she hears it all.&nbsp;   Made me think of when I shared a cube at the Library with Jen (or JLo as I call her).&nbsp; We had this candy dish that we put on the island between us, which would elicit constant commentary from EVERYONE that walked by.&nbsp; It was the strangest thing.&nbsp; No matter what we put in there, people would always stop and always&nbsp;have something to say about it&nbsp;- even if it was the most inane comment (such as "ooh, animal crackers.&nbsp; Cute!").&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to keep a running log of all the comments and "suggestions".&nbsp; If it was really funny and&nbsp;Jen was on the desk, I would email her in 72 point font so she would guffaw in a public, "professional" environment (you know, in front of the 2 patrons we probably had).&nbsp; I am nice that way.&nbsp; For a while we discussed putting strange things in there, like Q-Tips or floss - but we feared the mutiny that was sure to follow our prank.&nbsp; If I learned one thing at the Library, it was to ALWAYS keep my candy dish filled.&nbsp; This is an important lesson in life.   Anyway, I digress.&nbsp; So like any job, there appears to be red tape and a billion procedural issues.&nbsp; However, it appears that the red tape is real and not metaphysical in nature, so already that is a plus.&nbsp; I am not quite sure what exactly I will be doing&nbsp;as I am split&nbsp;between three departments - all of which my boss (who is a senior manager) oversees.&nbsp; So in some ways, it is much like my last position.&nbsp; There seems to be the same kind of panic (or "history emergency" as we used to call them) at this job.&nbsp; I never could understand how there can be so many emergencies in a non-profit.&nbsp; I mean, we don't exactly perform life saving procedures here.&nbsp; No one is going to die if I don't finish my excel spreadsheet in the next 10 minutes.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, it has been like that at every non-profit I have worked for.&nbsp;&nbsp;So no news there.&nbsp; &nbsp;   It is nice to have all of this free time all of a sudden, not that I am really doing anything productive with it mind you.&nbsp; I think I am still in shock that I don't have to go to bed at 10 and wake up at 5:30 to drudge an hour to work each way.&nbsp; I do miss my 3.5 mile walk to work however.&nbsp; Now I only have a mile each way, so I only get about halfway through a cd.&nbsp; Maybe I will have to walk to work, walk home and walk back to work again to compensate. :)&nbsp; And I get to sit out in the sun every day for lunch, which is lovely.&nbsp; I actually get to read more now than I did when I had an hour commute (and I would read even more if I hadn't bought this gorgeous computer!!).   So all in all, I have no real complaints about this job yet.&nbsp; Everything I have encountered I have more than expected.&nbsp; And I have actually been pleasantly surprised by some things.&nbsp; I will have formed more of an impression after my first all staff meeting tomorrow!   CLASSIFIED:   Happy Anniversary Amelia and Richard!  Happy Birthday Nadine (belated)!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I started this entry at the beginning of what turned out to be a very difficult week.&nbsp; Here is what I was going to tell you all...&nbsp;  &nbsp;       TOP TEN THINGS I AM "GRATEFUL" FOR IN MY NEW JOB:      10. COFFEE (with caffeine!!) is brewed all day.&nbsp; I foresee a return to a former addiction.&nbsp; I don't have a problem!&nbsp; What problem??    9. No more cubicle. I actually have an office. With 6 windows. Overlooking a park.&nbsp; I am thinking of hiring someone to listen to and comment on all of my conversations however.&nbsp; Just for old times sake.    8. Staff. I will have staff.&nbsp; And a think their contract might be for more than 10 minutes and that they were not previously laid off, rehired, quit and begged to come back.    7. The ability to leave a room carrying nothing (i.e. no security badge!!).&nbsp; Thus, no one to mysterious shut it off so that you look like an idiot badging and re-badging to get back in to the office.&nbsp; (hi Brian :))    6. 18 minutes to walk to work - EIGHTEEN.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can actually walk home for lunch.     5. Normal Health Coverage...I think that they have more than 4 doctors in the plan.    4. A Boss who says, "You know, you don't have to take that work home with you. It will be here tomorrow." instead of, "I know that your grandmother is dying, but I think you should get your priorities straight and come in to work this Sunday."    3.&nbsp; Not one person has asked me to fix a piece of office equipment, get them coffee, or make punch - in fact, we have a whole kitchen staff to do the latter (and no one has asked me to "volunteer" in the kitchen yet either!).    2.&nbsp; You have to get special permission to work after 7 and on the weekends because the building closes.&nbsp; And there is no way to check your email from offsite.&nbsp;     1.&nbsp; There is a distinct lack of "key to the scriptures".&nbsp; Praise mother-father god for that.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Of course, all of this was superseded by the drama of the week.&nbsp; It is like I never left!&nbsp; Amazingly, it still makes me angry.&nbsp; I have gone from wishing I were at the library to support (and seek support from) my friends, to hoping I don't have to cross its threshold for a very long time.&nbsp; Those of you who know me, know that it takes a lot to get me to that point.&nbsp; I am a pretty patient person (as evidenced by my three years there), but&nbsp;I am also loyal to a fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad that I was not there for the "remembrance" of my friend (even though you all swear it was nice!).&nbsp; Nothing would have pissed me off more than sitting there listening to people pretend&nbsp;they loved her when they gave her nothing but grief when she was alive.&nbsp; Kristie I hope you are now sitting with Leo, wearing&nbsp;denim&nbsp; and drinking a large vodka gimlet!  &nbsp;  And in somewhat related news, I went to a funeral this weekend of my dad's cousin Alan.&nbsp; My family is not really that close with that side of the family for various and sundry reasons (that cannot be explained in a blog) so it was a little weird to be there.&nbsp; Especially since the last time any of these people saw me I was maybe 13 years old and known as "little Katie".&nbsp; Oh, and hats off to my brother for getting the service information from my 93 year old grandmother.&nbsp; We showed up at what we thought was 15 minutes before the service and no one was there.&nbsp; We looked at each other and said, "Either Alan was  really  unpopular,&nbsp;or we are&nbsp;here at the wrong time."&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours later, the service started.&nbsp; I think next time we will not ask Grammie for event information.  &nbsp;  I spent the rest of this weekend sunning myself in America's Hometown (Plymouth, MA - and yes, that is really their motto) and reading my book.&nbsp; I am currently reading  The Mists of Avalon , which is some 900 pages long.&nbsp; There is nothing I love more than a really long book - the longer the better.&nbsp; I usually feel like longer books are more thorough.&nbsp; I hate when you get to the end of the book and things are left unresolved.&nbsp; That happens too much in real life - there really is no need to experience that from a book.&nbsp; I like the way Bradley tells the King Arthur legend from a woman's perspective (I did go to a 7 sister school after all!).&nbsp; It reminds me of  The Red Tent  in that way.&nbsp; I love the King Arthur legend, partly because I have actually been to that part of England.&nbsp; All that is left in Glastonbury are ruins of a monastery and the old Tor at the top of the hill, but the misty weather and landscape is just as she describes it!&nbsp; You know, not that I have an affinity for England at all.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; :)  &nbsp;  Speaking of England, I will attempt to post a picture of Miss Sophie (one of my twin nieces) and myself.&nbsp; Reason enough to love the British Isles...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So they say that your mid-20s is the time of weddings and babies.  I have had my share of showers, bachelorette parties, trips to the maternity ward etc. this year. But I have also had to write an unprecedented number of condolence cards.  Since the beginning of January, 5 acquaintances (of varying degrees) have passed away - three within the past 10 days.  I know that you all turn to my blog more for amusement, but allow me these few sad moments...  Mimi - my grandmother.  She died in January after a long bout of Alzheimers.  She was an incredibly intelligent woman.  She didn't remember her grandchildren's names in the last year of her life, but she could recite the Chaucer (in Olde English!!) she learned at Pembroke College sixty years ago.  She was a loving grandmother and appropriately died just days before my twin nieces were born.  I miss her every day.  And every time my brother and I get together, we have poached eggs on toast for breakfast, just like Mimi served us every summer at her house.  My siblings and I may actually be the only people in the US who actually like poached eggs anymore.   Amelia's (my best friend) Grandmother - who I met several times in the seventeen years that I have known Amelia.  She waited for her grandchildren to come to Chicago one last time before she died.  She died the day that they left.  Sometimes death is that amazing...  Alan - dad's cousin-in-law.  He died on July 3rd after a long struggle with cancer.  I haven't seen him or his family for years, but my dad grew up with his cousin and was very sad for her loss.  He leaves behind three children and several grandchildren, who I will see again for the first time in at least 8 years at the Memorial Service this weekend.  Erin - college classmate.  She died July 4th weekend from a car accident.  I had several classes with Erin, who, by my calculations, is the first person from our college class to die. It's always sad to see someone so young die - especially one you saw every day for three years.  Kristie - colleague and great friend.  I can't even begin to say how sad I am that Kristie died this Monday.  She had been suffering from stomach cancer, diagnosed finally last week.  I am glad that her life wasn't drawn out through pain.  Like Bryan said, she was a very succinct person, she would have wanted to go that way too.  She was a great friend with tremendous wit and humor.  She was one of the first people to befriend me at the Library some three years ago, when Kristie, Heather and I would go out for drinks after a long day of secrets and controversy at work.  She gave me a lot of perspective and shared her wisdom with me daily.  With all of the upheavals of the past year, a group of us bonded together to make the days bearable.  Kristie was one of us.  And I know I am not alone in saying that I miss her already.  After all my bitching about finally leaving the library, I wish that I could have been there on Monday to be with everyone.  Kristie and I were constantly planning our escape.  Ironically, we both timed it for the same day.  Kristie, you were well loved among us - we are greater people for having known you.

      Ok, Ok people!!!  Stop harrassing me.  I had to update this at Heather & Adam's for fear that you all would track me down and beat me!!!  I have left the confines of the Library....WAHOO!!!  I feel like a new woman.  I had a great send-off from work thanks to the excellent planning of Jill and Heather (thank you so much ladies).  I was particularly impressed with the "flair" that you prepared for me.  And after spending ALL DAY yesterday in bed recovering from that "flair", I am ready for some new "challenges and opportunities" (give me a few more days to lose the office lingo!!).    I had the most wonderful feeling walking out of that place...I wasn't even the slightest bit sad.   It was great - I would recommend it to all.  Especially all of those people that they have hired back at exorbitant fees after laying them off 2 months ago.  Well done library, well done.  Not humiliating at all really.  So I start at my new place tomorrow and I am very excited.  I may actually use some brain cells - what is that like again?  Anyone?  It should be good.  I don't have to be at work til 9 - and I live 15 minutes away!!!  I am actually "saving time", as Jerry and I would say.  And you will all be happy to know that my new computer comes tomorrow - so you can all expect more timely postings.  SO YOU CAN STOP YELLING AT ME PEOPLE.  :)   Classifieds: Happy birthday (belatedly) to Mom and Laura!  And happy birthday tomorrow Great Chief Gas Cap.  Thanks so much for the multiple cards and parties kids!  I had a fantastic time and I will miss working with you every day - but of course, I will still participate in all projects...xxoo, KB    GO SOX!!!!!

      Anyone who knows me, knows that I am obsessed with missing persons.  Laura and I talk about it so much that we want to open up our own PI firm that just deals with missing persons and various other news items that appear non-stop in newspapers for weeks on end, and then never again so that you are left wondering what the outcome of the case was for the rest of your days.  So recently, I have been following the Lori Hacking case in Utah.  I find that case fascinating.  I mean, how stupid is he?  He calls the police to report her missing 20 minutes after he buys a new mattress.  He tells his wife and absolutely everyone he knows that they are moving to the other coast so he can go to med school when he doesn't even have a BA.  So the wife finds out that she is pregnant, calls the school to ask about family housing and the registrar says "We don't have anyone registered by that name."  Did he think that he could just come home one day in five years with a stethoscope around his neck and everyone would believe that he was a brain surgeon?  And did he not think that his wife would wonder why he was not pulling in a doctor's salary in a few years?  And furthermore, did he not think that the police would check his phone records and educational background?  Does NO ONE watch Law and Order anymore?  If you are going to be stupid enough to commit murder, at least do your research people.  And in news of a more personal nature, I joined a gym today that is right in between my home and work.  And now I am committed to this gym for 3 whole years (unless I move of course).  This is HUGE for the woman that cannot even commit to a brand of toothpaste.  Break out the champagne, Katie is growing up!  I was amused that when I gave them my birth date at the gym, they couldn't believe I was  THAT  old.  Thank you 12 year old that sold me my membership.  CLASSIFIEDS: Happy Birthday Focker!  Sorry you are so old now. Congratulations Notice Giver.

      How could I forget one of the most momentous things that happened this weekend!!!  The Red Sox traded Nomar!!!!  Not sure how I really feel about this actually.  I mean, my cat could have played better than he this year, and she doesn't get paid anything.  It will be strange to see him in another team's uniform.  But if he went to anyone, I am glad that he went to the Cubs.  I have a soft spot for a team that believes in the game as much as we do - and not merely as a money making "opportunity".  Now if we could just get over this slump that would be great...

      I think I may have fulfilled my karmic duties this weekend.  I started by co-hosting a bachelorette party for Jen on Friday night.  I think it went well.  The bride was drunk the end of the night and we had a good time embarrassing her.  We started by handcuffing a blow-up doll to her, which she had to keep with her until she completed a list of tasks (such as getting a guy's phone number, a condom from a guy, biting off a guy's shirt button etc.).  I am so sure that wasn't annoying to have to carry around all night.  We went to Dick's Last Resort, which was amusing.  They make quite a show over the bachelorettes there, so she was able to complete most of her tasks before we even left.  And as a bonus, I saw my friend Nicole and her mother (and her mother's friends) there.  Nicole is also one of the 40,000 Brides-to-be that I know.  I am sure she watched the evening's festivities with much awe and fear - as well she should because she will be just as mortified on her bachelorette night.  I am just hoping that all of this torture that I enforce on my friends does not come back to bite me on the ass some day! :)  So I didn't drink at the bachelorette party because a. it is essential for every bachelorette to have a minder and b. I had to babysit for my landlord's son Christopher on Saturday.  What a good natured child!!  He is turning one next week and is one of the happiest babies I have ever seen.  We went to the park and played on the swings with the most obnoxiously competitive children.  Now really, were we that irritating as children?  I don't remember making fun of a 1 year old because he was too little to play on the slide.  If Christopher were a few years older I would have just told him not to worry, he would be visiting those kids in jail as he fulfilled one of his pro-bono cases for his fortune 500 law firm.  Damn kids.  How you know when you are getting old: when you actually begin a sentence with the phrase "kids these days..."  And of course, one cannot ignore the move of the century.  My best friend has finally escaped my clutches...albeit only by two more blocks.  Jerry has moved even further down the street from me to a newly renovated apartment in Somerville (we do have them you know!) and has left his old can't-believe-someone-would-actually-make-that-place-into-a-condo apartment behind. Wahoo.  Break out the champagne - Jerry is moving on up!  His place is gorgeous and completely full of crap...er...I mean boxes now.  Most importantly, he is still within S&S range for weekly brunches.  And thus ends a "quiet" weekend in the life of Kate!  Let it not be said again that I am a slacker at posting...  CLASSIFIEDS: Congratulations on your marriage Heather! Much happiness to you both... Good Luck Notice Giver.  I will eagerly be awaiting a play-by-play.
