						   SAKAJEWEEEEEEEEEEEEE.  I love blogging.  I had an incredible day today, and I finally found out who was tkaing over YSL Rive Gauche from TF.  Anyways, things on the NYC horizon are going well.  I am still at Via-snore (names are changed to protect the innocent), an awful wannabe-Biogen startup company.Anyways, I ma writing this totally for me, not to share with anyone, or to prove I read Vanity Fair and have read David Sedaris---this isn't to prove I'm witty, or fabulous, or that I have accomplished all my life goals.  It is just soemhting totally self indulgent, unedited, unspell-checked work of modern art I am doing completely for me!  Anyways, work is okay.  Ever sine I decided I wanted to get out of here, things have just slided off my back so easily.  It didn't offend me when Charles didn't show up to Ryan's party like it usually would, or feel really paranoid when one of the ohter managers saw me writing this blog instead of doing my excel spreadhseet,  At this point, I can't express how much I do not give a fuck about anything that would even try to compete with my personal happiness.  Why shouldn't we all be happy?  Why shouldn't I move to NYC and try to work in fashion?  Why shouldn't I pretend to be a girl on tthe Boston Chat Line and try to get horny straight guys to my apt? What?  Hehehehhe--just joking.  Anyways, I am so totally sick of the fact people are so unhappy and choose to do nothing about it.  I don't even know where to start writing.  Brent C. actually told me about this blogger thingee.  It's so weird, he has been so much of my life here, and when i think about him, I just think about the parts of Boston i will miss, which makes me think of the things in Bsoton I won't miss---which makes me realise I am so so so so doing the right thing by moving.  I think there have been some key people in my life here, him, Dave M., Ryan B., and Greg C. all of them I met here.  it;'s so wierd, b'c most of them haveso moved on and gorwn and here I am seemingly in the same place I have always been, until now.  I think moving is one of the smartest things I could do for my sanity, if not ym pocketbook.  I consigned like 5 pairs of shoes: My orange Burberry, Gucci and Versace sneakers from Spring 2003, an ancient Comme Des GArcon messenger bag, and a Neil Barrett Motorcycle jacket of black nylon---total profit for Bren:  600 bucks.  Such a ripoff consgnment!  I paid retail for all of those excpet the Burberry sneakers, which just goes to show, you should really only buy what you love. Anyways, that's all for now.

						   Today has been so strange.  I;VA actually been pretty happy.  Nicole G. Just sent in her resignation, less than a week after Nicole T. Sent hers in.  I am so happy for them.  Today was honestly just a total waste of time.  I guess it would help to understand where I'm coming from. My name is Bren Reginald Bondoc, named after my Dad's best friend in the Philippines, and its been a rough 5 years here in Boston since I graduated the University of FL.  It's so weird.  I can't believe I am still in Boston, and I am finally moving to New York in September.  I hate the job.it;s honestly been pretty rough.  Even though I just got promoted to manager, it's been nothing but trouble---I guess i thought I'd keep this online journal of my life.  Brent Covington actually introduced me, and even thought this first psoting is reallly boring , maybe I'll start making up stuff and posting that up.  Anyways, that's all for now.
