       today didnt start off dat badly.. to begin with, yassin didnt scream into the mike when he went to announce some stuff.. n yesh.. for once, he cracked jokes which r worth laughing over.   he went "tomorrow is eat ur family day" n most went "huh??" hah! he was actually glad dat we were paying attention to wat was gg to b said.  "at least u ppl r listening to me. the day after tomorrow begins today." again we went "huh?" den we realised he was actually talking abt the movie.. shoot him. well nyways, he talked some more shit abt eat-with-ur-family-day. its tomorrow.. n he went on n abt y we shud   n bla bla bla..   did the N.E quiz.. haha.. was kinda easy but i only got certified "seniour builder".. wth.. haha..  met nabil at cck after dat.. went to mkn.. den jln2.. den convinced him to take pics together.. haha.. kinda suay.. the machine suddenly ran out of paper.. den we had to wait.. haha.. den summore no time to edit the pics.. sick! gotta hide them.. haha.. cannot show anyhow.. can die.. haha..   rif has been leaving me alone.. i dunnoe if dat's good or bad.. haha.. not dat i mind anyway.. just dat.. i dun wan him to tink dat i was leading him on.. dun wan him to tink dat i'll lose out.. like.. who knows? eh.. skali he's the one whu's just playing ard with me.. haha.. wth.. who noes rite? mayb its just his nature to claim such things easily.. haha.. uurgh.. practically watever..

       skipped skool today.. so kinda bored rite now.. dunnoe wat to du.. just woke up.. listening to all the band pieces in my media player.. the black pearl is nice..   the reason i didnt wan to go to skool today is bcoz i dun c the point in gg. like.. its not as if we study.. i go to skool n sleep, instead of completing assigned work. n i'll wake up wit red eyes n my neck will hurt like hell for a while after that.  might as well sleep in the comfort of my own room. nyways.. i hate ma. she had wanted me to attend class today coz she didnt want me to stay at home with that freako. she dun wan me to argue with him. kinda stoopid.. dat's the problem.. she wuld rather i get out of his way den telling him off. which is telling him that he can get away with anything. im so sick of giving in to him. but i nvr said or do anything. at least not yet, but mayb i will. someday. y someday n not now? coz of the big A word again.  AFRAID - im afraid to do alot of things. forget abt that asshole.. he's not worth talking abt.   sometimes, i want to go up to my frens n tell them that it's ok; that it will b ok. tell them that i understand. tell them that such things do happen after all. that they are not alone. but i nvr did. somehow it's just extra difficult. i keep telling myself that at the end of it all, i will only b giving them the wrong impression. like as if everything will go wrong if i were to tell them. im afraid they will think that i said so just for the sake of agreeing with them, to make them feel better.   sometimes, i really hate myself.. for not doing what i think i shud b doing; for not saying what i shud b saying. im just too afraid to let it out. the only thing holding me back is the fear of having to understand their reactions. kinda crappy i noe.. but really.. i just dunnoe.. or mayb i du noe.. just dat i dun wan to understand it myself.  if i du get drunk one day, n if i can remember to du one thing i've always been wanting to du, here's wat i'll do. i'll call him. tell him how i really feel. but wat if.. just wat if.. everything turns out wrong after that? wat if i dun get the reaction i hope to get? there.. again.. im afraid of wat to expect...

       as im listening to persis overture, i realise im missing sumone terribly.  someone i shudn't even b thinking of. like wat the hell..  im always tinking of ppl whom i doubt remember i even exist.  right now, i feel good inside.. but there's a scent of rejection in my room. telling me its bringing me nowhere. i loathe this feeling more than anything else.  im just thinking too much.

       i tink i have a big prob. i'm beginning to hate someone so much i dun even know when it started.  i've been hating him for as long as i can remember. i've tried, so many times before.  tried ever so hard to forget everthing. tried to believe he'll b nice from tomorrow onwards. tried telling myself there's no need for him. tried convincing myself he nvr existed.  nothing's been ok. up till now wat i dun understand is how she puts up with him. gives him face, everything he wants. she's too lazy too argue with him, fine. but she cant c how bad its affecting me.  badly.  he may b the only reason i hate life. he may b the only reason i want to put an end to it all.

FRIDAY went to skool, did malay the whole day. kinda crappy. it was boring lor. esp when ahmad's the teacher. the  skool decided to do tis shit with regards to the malay o's. some intensive preparation for mt o levels.. will stretch until  next week.. darn!  nyways, was scheduled to help out with the vegetarian society at expo.. went there only to b utterly disappointed. i felt so out of place.. so yeah.. stayed for like.. 45 mins,  giving out pamphlets n cds.. den i told them i need the  ladies, took my bag n left. feel kinda guilty but whu cares?  got bored.. was still early n didnt want to go home.  had planned to overnite at marz's anyway. so so.. called  dear fren nabil again.. he was from somewhere fixing his  horn, n luckily for me, he was gg to tamp with his cousin after dat.. so yeah.. haha.. met him n his cousin.. went to walk ard at tamp.. n guess wat? liza saw us. she sent him a msg.. something like.. "i c u're with liza. at least u can come to me n say hi" like.. its not as if nabil saw her. knowing him.. im sure he will if he had seen her. so.. as  usual, nabil got angry.. n i felt kinda bad.. wat to do.. i left soon after.. telling him dat marz's meeting me.  the truth was, i didnt wan liza to see us again. yep yep yep.  it was still early when we went off.. ard 7.. called yasir  [he's the one who edited my blog for me.. thank you!] he had just finished swimming.. so i waited.. n walked back to marz's house with him. kinda afraid to meet him at first, afraid of disappointing him. who noes? guys.. haha! everything turned out ok though.. he was easy to talk to.. so nice..   SATURDAY went home.. didnt help mum at skool as usual. changed, then went out again.. wit marz n ct.. n nabil!! haha.. dunnoe lah.. just lurrve having him ard. met at city hall. pity nabil at first.. he felt so out of place.. n being the mean me.. i suan him  all i can while i can.. yeah.. had fun..  after eating at LJS, we headed to c sun set at esplanade rooftop.  yeah.. b4 dat.. me n nabil.. we were walking towards esplanade when i saw tis girl.. haha.. dunnoe y.. but i tot she looked familiar.. so i smiled.. n she smiled back.. dat was when i realized shes the girl ive been chatting with online.. haha.. how the hell did i recognise her?? from the pics she sent.. weird how our first meeting had to be that way..  stayed till abt 10.. by then marz's bf, buk, had joined us.. den took bus back to siti's place.. me, nabil, ct n her bf. yep.. he's another heart pain.. here's wat happened.. the bus we took actually passes by siti's place.. but we were kinda late.. so we stopped at kovan n took the train to sengkang.. tis guy.. hereby referring to ct's bf.. he was shagged out i tink.. his eyes were red.. n yeah.. from the station to the bus-stop closest to ct's block, he hardly spoke.. at the stop, we flagged a taxi for tis guy while he just sat staring into empty space. ct didnt want him to take the bus.. coz it was real late oreidy.. i mean.. she was only doing the right thing. when we finally stopped a cab, tis guy looked up n said, "who says im taking the cab home?"   i was so pissed lorh.. its like.. he knew we were flagging a cab for him.. n all this while he just sat there.. n he didnt even tell us he was ok with taking the bus or anything. like wat the hell?? sometimes it really doesnt pay to tink for some ppl.  SUNDAY left ct's house early n headed to tamp.. met yasir.. hang ard for a while.. den decided to go cycling.. yep.. i troubled him a lot dat day.. he had to go to his frens place to borrow a bike.. den to the petrol station to pump air into the wheels.. den back home n took the other bike.. sigh.. come to think abt it.. i du feel bad.. for everything that day. like.. he could have spent the day watching cartoons yet i dragged him out of the house.. hmmmmm... bad bad me.  had lotsa fun though im sure he didnt. haha.. cycled to east coast den back to tamp.. like.. surprised at myself.. didnt tink i'd even b doing tis kinda tings.. oh well.. all thanks to yasir.. humph!

       hmmm..  brain kinda empty today..  had so little to say suddenly. so far, little interesting tings had happened.  usual routine. ie. went to skool.     came back.     went online.     chatted wit him only.       logged off at 4.     went to sleep.     woke up at 6.    ive said tis b4 n im gg to say it again.  sad, sad life.      right now.. as im typing this entry..  im chatting wit darsh. n yeah.. we're discussing the bubble tea shop near skool. hah!  went to mkn at 155 coffeeshop after skool  wit jon, karmen, sug, chen, bomb. i dun understand the man selling food there. its like.. he oways has something to comment. just trying to b frenly to his customers mayb?   mirc is getting "boring-er" by day. its like.. i dun understand the ppl there, esp the guys. a crappy chat wit them will b like tis - "intro?"                                          "single/attached?"                                          "pic?"                                          "wt/ht?"                                          "stats?"                                          "open?"  i wunder where all the fun ppl disappeared to. mayb they too r getting sick of tis kinda shit. i dun blame them. i mean..   just look at the main of the channel n u c ppl 1 - selling themselves            "any gals single like            sport bike or car looking            for bf"              2 - selling 2nd hand goods            "i'm selling samsung           E700A msg me if u wanna           buy~ it's a new set..."                      3 - telling everyone how helpful they can b           "any gers ere need some duit can            msg me thanks u!"    n the list can go on. im just too lazy. as usual. sian arh. double happiness starting soon.

       "money money money must b funny in the rich man's world"  how true is tis?  sian arh... different views regarding money oso can make ppl argue.. such a cruel world.. no money, no talk.. den wat? got money only, can du as u like lah huh? knnbccb!  "don't talk to me ever like that... its fucking rude.. I don't want to ever hear u talk abt money and my family like that...We earned it... ur family can too"  of couse we can. if we choose to make do with the "hack care attitude" but excuse me!! my family are thankful wit the amount of money earned by mum, dad, sis. happiness does not derive from money money n more money only. of course u can b happy with more money lah.. but there are many other more important factors to make ppl happy, u noe dat?? aargh.. 'happy only when i earn alot' --> my parents dun tink tis way. get dat? so there's no point telling me my family can b rich too.. of course we can, dat is if we wan to. but there's no point..
