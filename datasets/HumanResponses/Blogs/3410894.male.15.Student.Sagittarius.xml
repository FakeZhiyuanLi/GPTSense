          STEP 1: pacifism    You let all of them die  because you don't care  your stereo-riot is typical  and you let everyone see your despair  the world is closing in  and we can hardly hate  the other side is loosing  and you people can hardly wait              STEP 2: Admitance     closing in with blood shot eyes  cranking out your drugs  and laughing at our demise  synth beat fun times  and whores on parade  death will eat our children  we finaly will see this decade

         To be swallowed    to be dead as the rest I lie and wait for my one true love to hold my tears and comfort my disbelief  and shed another tear I will till this world is full and to slit my wrist and bleed into the world wet, and will never know  and with a suicidal tension a spring without remorse I pull the trigger and enforce silently I die never to wake again all pain be set aside and watch me drift in the wind  its like your being swallowed and watching your heart turn sour your humors gone and your wilted like a flower  being engulfed in tragedy and like a nightmare see your own murder and you have no control  over what’s been done just be unwilling sigh just like everyone else because in truth  no one cares if you die they may seem to mourn and say you were the best but in truth they’ll just fuck off their dress  and don’t tell me that you understand cause you’ll be just like the rest swallowing my misery taking on my agony to tie your own knot  and say you know cause you’ve been there and you’ve seen me shot

         Animals    Carnivores on the inside Apes on the outside Haters can’t stop hating as were all trapped in our own denial  Painless, Brainless Questions for our own incurable intelligence  Were all animals on the inside Rear our children to sin, then run and hide Were all animals on the inside Beaten blackened-red, but still kept our pride  We took over the world and propagated a god Turned our ways Look at us now were MOD  were all animals  were all A-N-I-M-A-L-S

      I say we all just run around playing with our car-toonimated guns.  Pollute ourselves and our money with brown stripes and gold stars.  We can all be Americans.  Just take your red, black, and blue for granted. Hold your goddamn head high, and fear everything the media and god tells you.  Why not trust your politicians, fellow activist's, and righteous religious revolutionaries.  When it comes to believing they must know a thing or two.  When after all, isn't your life, other peoples lives, and death, a game.  Why not just trust, that in the end, there's only pain...

       T oo anti-social for what's left of human existence but not enough of our outcast-away to be left out.  For some, they always stay the  quarter-back, plastic faced , revolvers.  But for those of us (the rest like you and me), we are left in the shadows of simple half-harmonious existence with the ones we hate, left only with our fowl words and emotion-less hate crimes.  We live waiting for our time to be smited by the revolvers, so it seems, that is our only wish.  Taste death, and drowned soundlessly...
