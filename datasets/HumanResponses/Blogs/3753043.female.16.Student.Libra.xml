       mood :  longing for goldfish that I've already eatten ;-;  last watched :  Monster (well acted, yet disturbing and cinical)  I told the people at a forum I went to for about 5 days that I would be back about 2 days ago from my trip. Apparently some spam whores fucked up the forum so now all of the threads are passworded. I honesty cannot be bothered to type in a password everytime I enter a thread. No matter how much I like that forum. Maybe I'll leave it for now and then go back after a while and be all "I've returned!" and see if they actually remember me. Fla.. doubtful, though they all seemed to like my name "flamingramen". Heehee.  Damnit, don't you just hate it when friends change? Not necessarily into something that genuinely hurts or offends you. Just conforms to anothers expecations just to make life easier in some way. It's so hard to explain. I love and hate her so much right now. She was one of my bestfriends and now it's like she's dead because when I talk to her now she's not the same. She's not real and I can see right through it, which is what hurts even more.  I know who she really is but it pisses me off to see her supressing that just so fuckheads don't feel like fuckheads.  All of my girl-friends seem to be acting weird. Sometimes some of them hate me, and then others just plain don't understand me. It's like I just can't win with them sometimes.  I shouldn't let it bother me though.  I got a caduceus pendant today from Dreamweaver and a book on Indigo Children. I did that after I left Patty's. I actually cried in front of her . I've never done that before. We were just talking about depressing ex-friend crap and suddenly I was crying. I didn't even notice it was happening for a moment, even tho I was sobbing. It was strange.  But.. I'm gunna go do somemore nothing..  ..mmhmm..

       mood : &nbsp; pissed off for no real reason   listening to :  the boy who destroyed the world - afi   meh... I feel like a pile. A pile of what? A pile of something  rather unpleasant . *glares*  ;_; I nearly threw up today. I guess I did kinda... and I kinda wanted to.. because the throwie-upie feeling keeps returning. I just want to get it over with! *angst*  I decided to consider making a webcomic... not that I'd really expect anyone to read it, mostly for my own amusement more or less. I already wrote up a rather extensive plot and made character sketches of two of my many mayhaps-future characters. I'm not going to write it out, maybe I'll just scan in what I've already written in me sketch book... I think I will. Wait, I'll go scan now.. but it will seem like not time has past for you. Strange that. Damn you and you're lack of time experience. *shakes fist* ...blerg... scanners being a picky bastard... *kills*  Well, then, that took way more time than it was worth *anguish*    urlLink character sketches   - what are those crazy scribblings you ask? They're their names. That's right. I scribbled them out. Bitches. Well, you'll find out the boy's name if you read the plot line... bah   plotline:   1   - that's right... it's got death and rape. Cry about it.    2   - Ha! I based the siblings on people I hate/have a distaste for! Yay~! *donces* The doodle at the bottom was a pathetic attempt at morbid humour and space filling. Oi.. *badger*   {I changed the names of things so that people can't say that I'm dissing actual things.. I'll just say that I don't know what they're talking about and that I invented those names and that they're just crazy fucks. Clever, no? *turns french*}   ??click for exciting prize??   - that is what happens when you doodle late at night while listening to sexy placebo songs.. well.. it's what happens to me anyways ._.   I have a feeling that if I do go thru with this thinger it'll end up being all gothy. I don't exactly want it to be like that but I'm apathetic enough to let it slide if it does. Well.. I'm done the plot line in my head.. kinda. 12 is gunna be one of them stupid petaphile-bait children and 13 is gunna be a very terrible 2 yr old. It's gunna be possessed-like.. *bug-eyed*   Anyways... Had an interesting conversation with "peat" XD Only a select few will understand that.. Hahe~! Yes... That's right.. *pelvic thrust*

       mood :  html coding mode O_O   listeing to :  'at a glace' - afi   doing :  listening to Black Sails in the Sunset, coding my new site which is on tripod *gag* cuz I gots no $$$ T-T and talking to teh Brendan #__%&nbsp; =&nbsp; ???   a little while ago my ickle brother put a metal portable coffee mug thinger in the microwave... it was funny in retrospect. But at the time it was frightening when I kept on seeing the microwave spark and then.. fire. It wasn't too bad, we could just blow it out, but the cup was ruined obviously, and I got plastic ashes on my perogies *shakes fist*.  And our word of the day is "ass-pirate" ...yea, I don't know... >_>

       mood :  that stuffed up in a hot garage felling  last watched :  Anchorman [stupid and funny.. but I guess that was intended]  I saw Anchorman last night and it was... very stupid but also quite entertaining so I guess it was okay.  But last night I was playing Prince of Persia in my room and suddenly the screen turned off even tho the tv was still on [it was weird >_ My little child brother is pestering me to get off.. Little bastard thing *shakes fist*  Oh and yes...   urlLink          urlLink Which Jhonen Vaquez character are you?  By  urlLink EmReznor .

       mood :  delited  eatting :  danone la creme (sex in yogurt form)  watching :  'Rejected' by Don Hertzfeldt ^o^  talking to :  Brendan and Erin, but Erin left cuz I was on 'brb' to long during our checkers match watching the cartoonness >_>  Okay, I swear to god that some just violently poked me in the stomach. But nothing's there! Eeeep! And then before I saw a head out of the corner of my eye looking into my room from the door way. And I thought I was my brother so I said "Shut up, Cole." Like I always do, and I almost think I heard laughter. And then when I looked down the hall, no one was there!! Jesus I'm so paranoid right now *rocks back and forth*... But in other news, Brendan just sent me them rejected cartoons by Don Hertzfledt. Bloody awesomeness! I saw it over @ Nikkis a while ago... and now I have it! Yay! *donces* I know there was other stuff I was thining about a while ago... Before I was poked in the stomach by something non-existant that is! Ha! Oh yea, well this afternoon I was talking w/ Brendan (for the first time since his Film Camp yay!) and we got onto the subject (well I just randomly brought it up is more like it) of why hot guys are gay. And I said that if Johnny Depp went gay that I would be gravely disappointed, even tho I don't stand a chance with him now. I guess we can only hope that he's a pedo, or else I might have to hunt him down and rape him and make him my sex slave.. Bwahahaha!! Heeee, no more sugar for me ^________^ But anyways, Brendan suggested that if he was gay then I could get a sex change, but then there's the akwardness of suddenly having a penis and then the bumsex... Boy howdy! But honestly.. I'm kinda lossing faith in the straight male catagory thinger... They all seem like jerks. So maybe it'll be my only hope. Or I could some how get a  urlLink gay boyfriend . Either way... the majority of straight guys piss me off with their jerkish ways. But.. meh.. I'll just cuddle my plushies for now.. Not like that you bastards. *shakes fist* I need a Johnny Depp plushie... >_>

       mood :  strangely amused  listeing to :   allergic - placebo  Dear god.. I don't want to go to sleep. Eeee~!  I got a placebo cd 'Without you I'm nothing' or something to that effect... Anyways, indeed.  Erm... *long silence due to lack of brain fuction* ...*eyes roll back into head* ... *drool* Yeeesss... Well I finally got some decent 16 gauge earrings for my third lobe... erm "holes"? Should I call them holes or piercings or.. Well yea. Bah! You know what I mean. So cry me a river and I'll build you a cannoe so that you can travel down stream and find someone who cares! o_O Lol! Damn that was fucking random.. I think that's my little singnal that Brinny needs her sleep.. Meeheeee... But yes, now they match my 14's in my 2nd holes and my 12's in my 1st's. Well.. somehow they match.. in some.... way... >_> But I need new 14's for my 2nd's cuz the ones I have now are crap. CRAP!!!  Anyways, yes, earrings and then me and duddy went to see fahrenheit (Omg! Could that word be  any  more harder to spell!? Jesus christ..) 9/11 while mummy and Colie saw Anchorman (sp??). Thus, Bush is now an  Official  (note the capatilization.. omg!) asshole cuz now I fully comprehend the extent of his asshole abilities. See, before I just hated his fucked up eyebrows and non-existant lips. But now I really know  why  to hate the bastard. And for that, I thank Micheal Moore. *give Micheal Moore a puppy* ^_^ Mehee... tomorrow I'll probably read this and be all "What the deuce!?" Lmao! Deuce! Christ, that's like the best word  ever !

Even tho it's two walls (I'm doing half my room dark purple and the other half yellow.. perhaps I shall share pictures once completed..? *sceam* (sp...?)). But she had to complete the bathroom and today was busy feeling for some reason. I wasn't really at home at all and this is the first time today I have been on the computer *feels strange* o_O.  Anyways... I was cleaning out all the crap in my email account and I came across this pic:     Dear god.. I must have laughed for 5 minutes straight... XD (yes my life is just that uneventful..) Well, I'm gunna go back to my pathetic little flash movie creativness and try to figure out how to use a button to start the movie... A mistery to us all... Or maybe only me -_-

       mood :  tired and blah  listening to :  mr. rotobo - styx [I'm  very  sleep deprived @_#]... now it's fly high (saturation mix) - ayumi hamasaki... cuz it's crazy !_!  Yea....... I changed the colours cuz it was too "Ooh looka me I'm black~~!" Or something like that... I cannot think T-T It's like my brain's there but it's all "I'm sorry, I'm not available right now" and it's all like wtf??? o_O I don't understand what I just said.. ah well. I got.. uhm.. 2-3 hours of sleep last night.. It was the most eventful sleep over ever.  First we (me and Nicole.. that it) took Cozmo and Skippy for a walk and this scarey old man was swearing at them. I think he was drunk. Then a bunch of dogs kept on running out of their yards and up to them which was  really  great x_X.  Then we got like food poisoning from the frozen yogert... or yogart?? I can't spell... T-T But then it was all like.. blah.. and then we decided to chat after watching many an anime.. I can't remember exactly what we watched... but it was good... >_>  So, yes, we were chatting and then strange guys kept on attempting at trying to convince us that we were lesbians and that we wanted to cyber (what else is new?)... needless to say we weren't either of them, so the horny little bastards lost.  But then comes the most eventful part! Cuz Derek had to go to bed so we had to get off his comp and go into the comp room to continou (how do hell do you even spell that word anyways!??) chatting with strange peoples. But then... there was a SPIDER!! And then Nikki decided to be brave and try to catch it with a cup but it was scarey and it ran scarily which made her jump and us both scream. But then she hit her knee on a bunk bed post that was behind her and gashed it open. Blood was every where, we went to the hospital and had to wait at least 15 minutes before anyone would even give Derek the papers to fill out. And this was in a the emergency section which makes me loose faith in the reliability of our medical services.  Anyways, then nurse thay wheelchaired Nikki into the medical room asked her "Why are you crying so much?" in a pretty snotty voice. She then said "There's a lady with a fractured knee in the other room you know." I mean, jesus, way to treat your patients with repect. Even if it was 3 in the morning, no reason to be such a bitch. I felt so bad for her cuz the doctor kept on prodding at the gash for like five minutes before he glued it up. Then after it dried this ditzy sounding nurse came up to Nikki and was all "Where's you wound?" cuz she needed to tape it up. I guess it would make to much sense to just look near were all of the blood was. Anyways... it was a pretty interesting and memorable experience. Anyways, nothing I'm doing right now can really top that so I'm not going to mention it.. except maybe the fact that I'm in a garage. Yes, our new comp room is our garage. It's strange...

       mood :  content  listening to : ' we die young' - alice in chains [wee]  I watched slim to no amount of tv today... which is stange considering I didn't do much. Woke up at 10:50 to the sound of what seemed like some asshole reving their car. But it just my dad pressure washing the house. Why? I don't know >_>;;. So I got up, dazed and confused and had a doughnut for breakfast [mmm, nutrition! ;)], because for some reason we had doughnuts. Then I evenually had a shower and got dressed. My mom told me that she would take me to Shoppers at 2:00 so that I could get somethings I had been meaning to. Two came and went so I went wandering in my backyard with Taf for a while and ended up lying under the pear tree with her, using her as my fuzzy pillow :3. It was nice. I almost fell asleep a few times during the twenty or so minutes I was relaxing. Then at 4 we finally left. I got my stuff and ended up getting a digital photography mag too. Cuz, well, why not? I also got this dexatrim natural stuff since I've been eatting like I pig latey :\. So hopefully that'll do some good. I want to walk to Aberdine and get something fuzzy to drink. And mebeh take pictures of the lamas :o Well, anyways, I should go because all of this sitting is making me feel jumpy and kinda twitchy... I need to go burn some energy >:D [Ha!] ..There's a small moth piledriving it's self against the screen >_>   listening to now : ' cherry lips' - garbage [yay for pretty boys :) *thumbs up*]
