      I have to say that day 4 is easier again. Last night wasn't too bad. The evenings are harder than at work in the day. I did get a bit restless, but nothing more than that. I had a frustrating wait getting home from work last night and I thought that that would make me want to smoke, but I figured that I'd be board if I had a tab or not, so I wasn't realy tempted.  It wasn't the first thing I thought of this morning! I realy feel as if I have cracked it, but find that hard to believe. I am a non smoker. I am still apprehensive about tomorow night. I'm going to the pub. I always used to smoke alot at the pub, and my drinking buddy is a heavey smoker. He knew I was stopping, but I haven't seen him since I did. If anybody does read this and is thinking about stopping smoking, The Allan Carr method realy does work, and it is realy easy. I have had one of two slight problems, but they were/are only slight. Nothing compared to the problems you face every day as a smoker. Give the bloody things up.

      Third day without the tabs. Still a subject that is dominating my thoughts. Well, that and sex. It is getting easier though. The cravings are less intence and just appear as a sort of nervous energy which must be burnt off. I think this is where the sex comes in. I am eating more. I noticed today that eating mints doesn't help. When you stop smoking, the craving first manifests itself as a constant need for something. It leaves you feeling empty, so I tried eating mints. This didn't take the feeling away, only kept them alive. There are two ways for the feelings to go away. 1. Have a tab. This will make the feeling go away instantly and return in less that 1 minute after finisheing that tab, or 2. Stop Smoking. This feeling should go away in three days or so, and it is my third day, and the feeling is there, but much weaker than before. I am eating more but I don't think it helps. I will try and continue my diet tommorow, well, the rest of today. It doesn't make the purging of the cigarettes any easier or harder, so why bother.

      This is my 5th day without a tab, and I feel great! I have had no cravings or withdrawal symptoms. I even ran a little bit when I was caught in the rain and my lungs didn't feel like they were burning! What is hard to fathom out is why it is so easy to give up? Why did I smoke for all those years when I couldn't afford it, while my health was deteriorating? It is so easy. There is nothing to give up. You just stop! I will maybe post again if I run into problems, but I can't see why I would. Allan Carr's EasyWay to Give Up Smoking. The book costs about Â£7. I have already saved Â£24 on tabs. But it is much more than that. I don't smoke, and I feel annoyingly great about it. I am free!
