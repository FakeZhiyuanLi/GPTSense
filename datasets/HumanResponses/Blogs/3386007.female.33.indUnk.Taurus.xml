        gone phishing...     We received one of  urlLink these  a couple of days ago, and as we do not bank with, or have a card with MBNA it was quite easy to spot. Even if we did bank with them the English used in the email would make you think twice before accepting it as a valid email.

        Queen beat Darkness in rock poll..................shock horror!!    Queen's hit single We Will Rock You topped a poll of music fans to find the greatest rock anthem of all time.  The Darkness - 'the UK rock sensation of 2003'* - came 19th with their single I Believe In A Thing Called Love, which came as a surprise to me as I thought it would be much lower down. In second place was Bohemian Rhapsody once again by Queen, Nirvana (smells like teen spirit) came third, Europe, the final countdown came forth and fifth was Bon Jovi, living on a prayer. Quite a lot of big hair in that list.  *  not the authors opinion

        The return of high-rise Britain?     'Work starts this week on the UK's tallest residential building - a 47 storey, 171m high glass tower in Manchester. Similar projects are planned in cities across the nation; will we all be living high-rise in years to come?'    This is the type of housing that caused major problems in the 60's and 70's in Britain. Residents felt isolated and crime rates soared.   'two-bedroom flats are already selling for £700,000'   just because they are now very expensive 'flats' does not mean that the same issues won't apply.

      'Apple users have been updating their software to close a security hole which could, in theory, expose their computers to attack.  On Friday, Apple warned of a flaw in its Safari web browser which could allow malicious code to be run on a machine without a user's permission.'  Apple's have up until now been fairly safe in terms of attacks from viruses, could this be that the virus writers have been targeting Windows machines to gain the most publicity as it would effect the most machines. With more people using Apple's they could end up being a victim of their own success. No machine regardless of it's make is completely safe when connected to the net, all we can try to do is to make our machines as safe as possible (anti-virus, firewall etc).....and hope!

      I have to admit that, although I might be in my early thirties, a mum with two young children, and an Independent reader - I was absolutely thrilled to read today that Tony Blair was hit   in the commons   with a condom filled with purple flour.  OK, so it might have been part of a protest by Fathers 4 Justice (and good on them) but it was wonderful to see.  Just it shame it didn't stain properly.  I am, by the way,   not   a Blair/Bush "hey let's nuke 'em all!" fan.  Roll on the election.  I would just love it if everyone voted for the Lib Dems at the next election - can you imagine the reaction?! Half the senior politicians in the country would pass out from shock. Labour and the Tories are so similar, and so convinced the fight is just between them - it would be nice to jerk their chains a little...  No doubt security will be increased to protect poor TB and his mates whilst 'working', and an 'enquiry' will be launched to find out what went wrong (and to spend all our cash pointlessly).  Just read the newspapers guys...  Hx.

      I've been thinking about the small collection of papers/magazines that I read regularly and what they may say about my place in the circle of life.   I read The Independent newspaper almost daily (marvellous now they have the small format).  Now does that make me independent, or does it just mean that I wish I was??   The Radio Times (so much more than a TV listings magazine) always appears without fail every Tuesday.  James is convinced that it breeds quietly behind the sofa.  And says so every time I buy a new one.  I even do the little Trackword, but only ever the quick version of the crossword as I don't watch enough soaps to get much of the main quiz right.  Is that sad?   Monthly, I get BBC Gardeners' World magazine.  OK, ok, so I like gardening.  I may not have much time in mine, but I love reading about it.  Here's a tiny yet thrilling quiz for you - I'm making a potager at the moment.  Anyone know what one is?  Most people I mention it to have no idea...   The only magazine we get by subscription is The Ecologist.  My word, but it's grim out there.  Essential reading to ensure you never support Coca Cola, the supermarkets, the government, the NHS, etc., etc. ever again.  Absolutely fascinating and a real eye-opener.  Maybe this one is for the part of me that wishes I'd been a real rebel in my youth, protesting, taking drugs, etc.   Anyone got a duller selection?!   H.x.

       Top 10 sports earners:    1. Tiger Woods $80.3m 2. Michael Schumacher $80m 3. Peyton Manning (American football) $42m 4. Michael Jordan $35m 5. Shaquille O'Neal (basketball) $31.9m 6.

Kobe Bryant (basketball) $26.1m   now I am not one of Mr Beckham's greatest fans but fair play to the bloke, he is the only Brit to make the list and one of only two who are not American (or play their sport in the US as far as I am aware).

      The Football League has changed the name of Division One to The Championship for next season.   In addition, Divisions Two and Three will be re-titled League One and League Two as part of the rebranding.   So we now have The Premiership, The Championship, League one and League two. It sounds great for all of those teams in the  fourth division  (as it once was) they are now in league two.  Madness utter madness.

       Tim Berners-Lee, the British inventor of the world wide web, has received his knighthood from the Queen.  The  " father of the web", who already has an OBE, went to Buckingham Palace to get his reward for "services to the global development of the internet".  &nbsp;  A well deserved Knighthood in a time when too many honours are given out to 'celebs' for doing nothing much in the way of anything .

       Well what have we   here  , a new editor from Blogger, how nice. Maybe it will encourage me to post a bit  more often  than I am at the moment.  &nbsp;   Shrek 2  was great by the way, I thoroughly recommend it, esp the  furb  all scene &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Don't panic about the colour's I am just using them because they are there, it won't become common place.

        have an outdoor grasscourt tennis championship in England in June?????  years without rain 1931, 1976, 1977, 1993, 1995  Years when play extended into a third week 1919, 1922, 1925, 1927, 1930, 1963, 1972, 1973, 1982, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001  June has never been a reliable summer month. "The polar front is responsible for bringing frontal systems and connected unsettled weather to the UK. In June, the ground and oceans are not warm enough to move the polar front reliably north and so allow the Azores high to stretch north over the UK, which would bring fine dry weather.  This is why on average the weather in June is not reliably sunny, dry and warm .

       Mate, it would be great to meet up for a chat and a drink, your going to have to explain that site for me!?!?!   Andrew, this is my attempt at a blog, an online journal. The idea is that I add entries as I would a conventional journal/diary. I also use it as an on-line photo album, to enable other surfer's friends(such as your good self) and family to keep up to date with my family. This would work better if I took more photos and actually upload the ones I do take. You will notice that the entries are very sporadic and mostly consist of links to other articles.....this is due to the fact that I find it very difficult to come up with interesting/amusing/relevant articles of my own!   It also allows me to link to  urlLink other sites  (for news/sport articles, other blogs etc), that I think my reader(s) will find interesting.  and that is what I keep telling myself.

      WHITE HOUSE It's another entry in the long catalog of Bushisms.

      Compact discs were sold as the durable alternative to vinyl - but anyone who opens the case of an ageing CD may be in for a nasty surprise.   Oh dear, this was not meant to be.
