      Well I must admit that I have gotten into all of the hype about this new mail account that google is offering. Called GMail, and I have seen alot of people already with account even though they are in the beta stage. People are getting invites from other people but nobody has invited me yet. When I do get a invite, I would really like to have andrew@gmail.com but I highly doubt that it will still be avaliable to use. It's always nice to want stuff isn't it?  I'd also like $1,000 :) send it to me by mail, thanks.

      I had drivers ed again today starting at 8:00 a.m. till 10:30 a.m. My mom drive me up there and I had to ride my bike home sense my dad was working and couldn't pick me up. Then when I got home, after about 30 min of sitting and watching t.v., my dad wanted me to cut the grass. So I had to do that, took me about 45 min and during that time, my friend Andy called. Went over to his house after I was done. Played some 21 and some smackdown for ps2. When I came home, my mom and I went to pick up some mcdonalds. My mom got a big mac which had a free download code for www.connection.com. Got a free music download, along with one that Andy gave to me cause he got one from his work for free. He happens to work for mcdonalds too. When I got done with that, I came online and sat around watching t.v. like I am doing right now. :) another fun day.

      Started Drivers Ed. again today. I would of already had my permit if I had not gone on vacation to Florida when I was taking the class for school in Feb. but I have to admit, the trip was worth it. On the bright side, I only have to go for 15 more days. July 1st I should have my permit if all goes well. When I got home, sense I'm now offically on summer vacation, I did what I've been wanting to do for a long time, absolutly nothing. I just sat around watching T.V. (of course nothing good was on -_-) but it was a good day. Other than that, I didn't do anything today. Planning to go to my friend Micheal's house tomorrow but he might already have plans, we'll see what happens.
