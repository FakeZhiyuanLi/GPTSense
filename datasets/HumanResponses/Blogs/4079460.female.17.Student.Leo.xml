       hmm yes, well i guess i'll just ramble on about what i can remember about my world....   the picture posted just before this? yeah, it says that it's the closest thing i can find to how my world looks. it's a blue-crystalline planet, in a state of perpetual twilight... no bright sun, at least not on my part of it. what i do remember are billions of stars, all the time, as well as four moons, different sizes and clours, and very very rarely all full at once. when they are, it's as bright as the time here just before the sun completely disappears below the horizon.... lol very bright there, compared to the usual lighting.    we live mainly underground, in large caverns and such, though the ones that like solitude tend to go more towards the surface caves. for lighting down there(though we don't need much... with slit pupiled eyes you can see so much more then regular round pupils) we have crystals, that we charge, generally i think there are certain people that are the caretakers, because these crystals give off not only light, but heat and energy (the energy part is important, because my people don't need to eat anything except energy, so the crystals are also our food-source). the main type of crystals are blue (sorry, don't remember what we call them) but there are many other type/colours of crystal. i remember a necklace i'd wear all the time, it had some importance to me, though i don't remember what. it was a deep deep blue crystal, deeper then any sapphire you could ever hope to find on earth, as the pendant part. the "chain" part was alternating green and black crystals, both deep enough to be just barely opaque, but the type that if you held it up to a bright light you could see through it.   as well, i remember storms, and flying around/in/with lightning, occasionally taking a bit of the pure energy from it.    ::sigh:: i miss it so much. i tend to try not to think about it during the day, because once i start thinking about it i want to see the stars.the stars are the only thing that help ease the yearning i feel to go home.

       well, it seems i've found another journal.... at least i'll be able to use this one for otherkin-chatter. still getting used to this sort of format though. oh well.   mm yeah, back to otherkin-chatter.... otherkin, for anyone reading this that doesn't already know, is someone that is in a human body at the moment, but has the undeniable sense of being something else, whether it be spiritually different from humans, or in a past life, or even have the genes of a non-human(such as the elves and fae and sidhe). yes i'm otherkin, specifically a draconian, spritually. yeah, i know, draconian doesn't really explain much about it. draconian, in my sense of the word, pretty much means a half-elven, half dragon-thing. i've three forms, elvish, dragoon, and drake... all three have the same platinum white-blue skin/scales(whichever apply), tail, claw/feet, and green slit pupiled eyes (though the green changes in intensity and such according to moods, energy, that sort of thing.)    the elvish, yes, has the pointed ears, as well as "elbow rays" as i call them.... just something extending out of the elbow about a foot, with webbing going from the upper arm to the side/back.    the dragoon is pretty much the same as the elvish, only the elbow rays and the lower arm bone( the one that makes that little bump at your wrist... yes that one) both extend, to create wings... gods i love my wings, i wish i had them in this life.... lol ok on to more descriptions... both the elvish and the dragoon form have the same mercury/ white-blonde hair colour.   the drake form is the farthest removed from the elvish.... it's pretty much a small dragon, only instead of having four legs and wings, there's only two hindlegs and the wings. also, i can change the size from small enough to sit on your shoulder comfortably, to large enough for a human sized creature to ride.   ok i think that's plenty for now.... maybe next post i'll say something about where i come from.... lol maybe. well if you've read this much, you either are bored out of your mind and are ready to hit the back-button, or are interested enough to read more, so hopefully i won't completly forget about this journal like i almost already did and post some more... fun fun.   diosa te bendica   Morijana
