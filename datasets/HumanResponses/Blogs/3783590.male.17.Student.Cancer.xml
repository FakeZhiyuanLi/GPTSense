       Ok... Some new updates:   Incubus Dreams  is due out  September 28, 2004, and  Cerulean Sins  will be out as a paperback in August 2004.  The  Cravings  anthology will be out in a couple of days ( June 29th to be exact). It contains chapter 11 - 13 of Incubus Dreams, as well as other works from other authors. On a personal note...   I have graduated from school and have decided to take the summer off, so I will be able to update, and create stuff for the website continuously. I'm happy about that. I've been wanting to get to that for a long time now, but never really had anytime. I'm also thinking about moving the circus log to blogspot.com where I have my personal log set up now. Take a look at my personal log and tell me what you think. Yes, I plan to fix the chat box.  Toodles,   Juliana Ayala (MG)

      Chapter One  It was an October wedding. The bride was a witch who solved preternatural crimes. The groom raised the dead and slew vampires for a living. It sounded like a Halloween joke, but it wasn't.   The groom's side wore traditional black tuxedos with orange bow ties and white shirts. The bride's side wore orange formals. You don't see Halloween orange prom dresses all that often. I'd been terrified that I was going have to shell out three hundred dollars for one of the monstrosities. But since I was on the groom's side I got to wear a tux. Larry Kirkland, groom, co-worker, and friend, had stuck to his guns. He refused to make me wear a dress, unless I wanted to wear one. Hmm, let me see. Three hundred dollars, or more, for a very orange formal that I'd burn before I'd wear again, or less than a hundred dollars to rent a tux that I could return. Wait, let me think.   I got the tux. I did have to buy a pair of black tie-up shoes. The tux shop didn't have any size seven in women's. Oh, well. Even with the seventy-dollar shoes that I would probably never wear again, I still counted myself very lucky.   As I watched the four bridesmaids in their poofy orange dresses walk down the isle of the packed church, their hair done up on their heads in ringlets, and more make-up than I'd ever seen any of them wear, I was feeling very, very lucky. They had little round bouquets of orange and white flowers with black lace and orange and black ribbons trailing down from the flowers. I just had to stand up at the front of the church with my one hand holding the wrist of the other arm. The wedding coordinator had seemed to believe that all the groomsmen would pick their noses, or something equally embarrassing, if they didn't keep their hands busy. So she'd informed them that they were to stand with their hands clasped on opposite wrist. No hands in pockets, no crossed arms, no hands clasped in front of their groins. I'd arrived late to the rehearsal, big surprise, and the wedding coordinator had seemed to believe that I would be a civilizing influence on the men, just because I happened to be a girl. It didn't take her long to figure out that I was as uncouth as the men. Frankly, I thought we all behaved ourselves really well. She just didn't seem really comfortable around men, or around me. Maybe it was the gun I was wearing.   But none of the groomsmen, myself included, had done anything for her to complain about. This was Larry's day, and none of use wanted to screw it up. Oh, and Tammy's day.   The bride entered the church on her father's arm. Her mother was already in the front pew dressed in a pale melon orange that actually looked good on her. She was beaming and crying, and, seemed to be both miserable and deliriously happy all at the same time. Mrs. Reynolds was the reason for the big church wedding. Both Larry and Tammy would have been happy with something smaller, but Tammy didn't seem to be able to say no to her mother, and Larry was just trying to get along with his future in law.   Detective Tammy Reynolds was a vision in white, complete with a veil that covered her face like a misty dream. She, too, was wearing more make-up than I'd ever seen her in, but the drama of it, suited the beaded neckline, and full, bell-like skirt. The dress looked like it could have walked down the isle on it's own, or at least stood on it's on. They'd done something with her hair so that it was smooth and completely back from her face, so that you could see just how striking she was. I'd never really noticed that Detective Tammy was beautiful.   I was standing at the end of the groomsmen, me and Larry's three brothers, so I had to crane a little to see his face. It was worth the look. He was pale enough that his freckles stood out on his skin like ink spots. His blue eyes were wide. They'd done something to his short red curls so they lay almost smooth. He looked good, if he didn't faint. He gazed at Tammy as if he'd been hit with a hammer right between the eyes. Of course, if they'd done two hours worth of make-up on Larry, he might have been a vision, too. But men don't have to worry about it. The double standard is alive and well. The woman is supposed to be beautiful on her wedding day, the groom is just supposed to stand there and not embarrass himself, or her.   I leaned back in line and tried not to embarrass anyone. I'd tied my hair back while it was still wet so that it lay flat and smooth to my head. I wasn't cutting my hair so it was the best I could do to look like a boy. There were other parts of my anatomy that didn't help the boy look either. I am curvy, and even in a tux built for a man, I was still curvy. No one complained, but the wedding coordinator had rolled her eyes when she saw me. What she said out loud was, "You need more make-up."   "None of the other groomsmen are wearing make-up," I said.   "Don't you want to look pretty?"   Since I'd thought I already looked pretty good, there was only one reply, "Not particularly."   That had been the last conversation the wedding lady and I had had. She positively avoided me, after that. I think she'd been mean on purpose, because I wasn't helping her keep the other groomsmen in line. She seemed to believe that just because we both had ovaries instead of balls that we should have joined forces. Besides, why should I worry about being pretty? It was Tammy and Larry's day, not mine. If, and that was a very big if, I ever got married, then I'd worry about it. Until then, screw it. Besides, I was already wearing more make-up than I normally did. Which for me meant any. My stepmother Judith keeps telling me that when I hit thirty I'll feel differently about all this girl stuff. I've only got three years to go until the big 3-0, so far panic has not set in.   Tammy's father placed her hand in Larry's. Tammy was three inches taller than Larry, in heels, she was more. I was standing close enough to the groom to see the look that Tammy's father gave Larry. It was not a friendly look. Tammy was three months, almost four months pregnant, and it was Larry's fault. Or rather it was Tammy and Larry's fault, but I don't think that's how her father viewed it. No, Mr. Nathan Reynolds definitely seemed to blame Larry, as if Tammy had been snatched virgin from her bed and brought back deflowered, and pregnant.   Mr. Reynolds raised Tammy's blusher on her veil to reveal all that carefully made up beauty. He kissed her solemnly on the cheek, threw one last dark look at Larry, and turned smiling and pleasant to join his wife in the front pew. The fact that he'd gone from a look that dark, to pleasant and smiling when he knew the church would see his face, bothered me. I didn't like that Larry's new father-in-law was capable of lying that well. Made me wonder what he did for a living. But I was naturally suspicious, comes from working too closely with the police for too long. Cynicism is so contagious.   We all turned towards the altar, and the familiar ceremony began. I'd been to dozens of weddings over the years, almost all Christian, almost all standard denominations, so the words were strangely familiar. Funny, how you don't think you've memorized something until you hear it, and realize you have. "Dearly, beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in Holy matrimony."   It wasn't a Catholic or Episcopalian wedding, so we didn't have to kneel, or do much of anything. We wouldn't even be getting communion during the ceremony. I have to admit my mind began to wonder a bit. I've never been a big fan of weddings. I understand they're necessary, but I was never one of those girls who fantasized about what my wedding would be like someday. I don't remember ever thinking about it until I got engaged in college, and when that fell through, I went back to not thinking about it. I'd been engaged very briefly to Richard Zeeman, junior high science teacher, and local Ulfric, Wolf-King, but he'd dumped me because I was more at home with the monsters than he was. Now, I'd pretty much settled into the idea that I would never marry. Never have those words spoken over me and my honey-bun. A tiny part of me that I'd never admit to out loud was sad about that. Not the wedding part, I think I would hate my own wedding just as much as anyone else's, but not having one single person to call my own. I'd been raised middle-class, middle America, small town, and that meant the fact that I was currently dating a minimum of three men, maybe four, depending on how you looked at it, still made me squirm with something painfully close to embarrassment. I was working on not being uncomfortable about it, but there were issues that needed to be worked out. For instance, who do you bring as your date to a wedding? The wedding was in a church complete with holy items so two of the men were out. Vampires didn't do well around holy items. Watching Jean-Claude and Asher burst into flame as they come through the door would probably have put a damper on the festivities. That left me with one official boyfriend, Micah Callahan, and one friend, who happened to be a boy, Nathaniel Graison.   They'd come to the part where the rings were exchanged, which meant the maid of honor, and the best man had something to do. The woman got to hold Tammy's huge spill of white flowers, and the man got to hand over the jewelry. It all seemed so terribly sexist. Just once I'd like to see the men have to hold flowers and the women fork over the jewelry. I'd been told once by a friend that I was too liberated for my own good. Maybe. All I knew was that if I ever did get engaged again I'd decided either both of us got an engagement ring, or neither of us did. Of course, again, that not getting married part meant that the engagement was probably off the board, too. Oh, well.   At last, they were man and wife. We all turned, the reverend presented them to the church as Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Kirkland, though I knew for a fact that Tammy was keeping her maiden name, so really it should have been Mr. Lawrence Kirkland and Ms. Tammy Reynolds.   We all fell into two lines. I got to offer my arm to Detective Jessica Arnet. She took the arm, and with her in heels, I was about five inches shorter than she was. She smiled at me. I'd noticed she was pretty about a month ago, because she was flirting with Nathaniel, but it wasn't until that moment that I realized she could be beautiful. Her dark hair was pulled completely back from her face, so that the delicate triangle of her cheeks and chin was all you saw. The make-up had widened her eyes, added color to her cheeks, and carved pouting lips out of her thin ones. I realized that the orange that made most of the bridesmaids look wan, brought out rich highlights in her skin and hair, made her eyes shine. So few people look good in orange, it's one of the reasons they use it in so many prisons, like an extra punishment. But Detective Arnet looked wonderful in it. It almost made me wish I'd let the wedding lady talk me into the extra make-up. Almost.   I must have stared, because she frowned, and only then did I start forward, and take our place in line. We filed out like good little wedding party members. We'd already endured the photographer for group shots. He'd be hunting the bride and groom for those candid moments; cutting the cake, throwing the bouquet, removing the garter. Once we got through the receiving line, I could fade into the background and no one would care.   We all stood in a line as we'd been drilled. Bride and groom at the front of the line, because, let's face it, that's who everyone is really here to see. The rest of us strung out behind them along the wall, waiting to shake hands with mostly strangers. Tammy's family were local, but I'd never met any of them. Larry's family were all out-of-towners. I knew the policemen that had been invited, other than that, it was all nod and smile, nod and smile, shake a hand, or two, nod and smile.   I must have been concentrating very hard on the people I was meeting, because it surprised me when Micah Callahan, my official date, was suddenly in front of me. He was exactly my height. Short for man or woman. His rich, brown hair was nearly as curly as mine, and today his hair fell around his shoulders, loose. He'd done that for me. He didn't like his hair loose, and I understood why. He was always delicate looking for a man, with all that hair framing him, his face was almost as delicate a triangle as Detective Arnet's. His lower lip fuller than his upper lip, which gave him a perpetual pout, and though wider than a woman's mouth, didn't really help. But the body under his black tailored suit, that helped. . Wide shoulders, slender waist and hips, a swimmer's body, though that wasn't his sport.   From the neck down you'd never mistake him for a girl. It was just the face, and the hair. He'd left the shirt open at the neck so that it framed the hollow in his throat. I could see myself reflected darkly in his sunglasses. It was actually a little dim in the hallway, so why the sunglasses? His eyes were kitty-cat eyes, leopard, to be exact. They were yellow and green all at the same time. What color predominated between the two depended on what color he wore, his mood, the lighting. Today, because of the shirt, they'd be very green, but with a hint of yellow, like dappled light in the forest.   He was a wereleopard, Nimir-Raj of the local pard, by rights he should have been able to pass for human. But if you spend too much time in animal form sometimes you don't come all the way back. He didn't want to squeak the mundanes, so he'd wear the glasses today.   His hand was very warm in mine, and that one small touch was enough, enough to bring some of the careful shielding down. The shielding that had kept me from sensing him all through the ceremony like a second heartbeat. He was Nimir-Raj, to my Nimir-Ra. Leopard King and Queen. Though my idea of the arrangement was closer to Queen and consort, partners, but I reserved presidential veto. I'm a control freak, what can I say? I was the first human Nimir-ra in the wereleopards long history. Though since I raise the dead for a living and am a legal vampire executioner, there are people who'll argue the human part. They're just jealous.   I started to pull him in against me for a hug, but he gave a small shake of his head. He was right. He was right. If just holding his hand sped my pulse like candy on my tongue, then a hug would be bad. Through a series of metaphysical accidents, I held something close to the beast that lived in Micah. That beast and Micah's beast knew each other, knew each other in the way of old lovers. That part of us that was not human knew each other better than our human halves. I still knew almost nothing about him, really. Even though we lived together. On a metaphysical level we were bound tighter than any ceremony or piece of paper could make us; in real everyday life, I was wondering what to do with him. He was the perfect partner. My other half, the missing piece. He complimented me in almost everyway. And when he was standing this close, it all seemed so right. Give me a little distance and I was beginning to wonder when the other shoe would drop and he would stop being wonderful. I'd never had a man in my life yet, that didn't spoil it somehow. Why should Micah be different?   He didn't so much kiss me, as lay the feel of his breath against my cheek. He breathed, "Until later." That one light touch made me shiver so violently that he had to steady me with a touch on my arm.   He smiled at me, that knowing smile that a man gives when he understands just how much his touch affects a woman. I didn't like that smile. It made me feel like he took his time with me for granted. The moment I thought it, I knew it wasn't true. It wasn't even fair. So why had I thought it at all? Because I am a master at screwing up my own love life. If something works too well, I've got to poke at it, prod it, until it breaks, or bites me. I was trying not to do that anymore, but old habits, especially bad ones, die-hard.   Micah moved off down the line, and Detective Arnet gave me a questioning look out of her heavily painted, but lovely eyes. She opened her mouth, as if to ask, if I were all right, but the next person in line distracted her. Nathaniel was distracting, no doubt about that.   Jessica Arnet was a few inches taller than Nathaniel's 5' 6", so she had to look down to meet that lavender gaze. No exaggeration, on the color. His eyes weren't blue, but truly a pale purple, lavender, spring lilacs. He wore a banded collar shirt that was almost the same color as his eyes, so that the lavender was even more vibrant, drowningly beautiful, those eyes.   He offered his hand, but she hugged him. Hugged him, because I think for the first time she was in a public situation where no one would think it was strange. So she hugged him, because she could.   There was a fraction of a moment's hesitation, then he hugged her back, but he turned his head so he could look at me. His eyes said clearly, help me.   She hadn't done that much yet, just a hug, where a handshake would have done, but the look in Nathaniel's eyes, were much more serious than what she'd done. As if it bothered him more than it should have. Since in his day job he's a stripper, you'd think he'd be used to women pawing him. Of course, maybe that was the point. He wasn't at work.   She stayed molded to his body, and he stayed holding, with only that mute look in his eyes to say he was unhappy. His body seemed happy and relaxed in the hug. He never showed Jessica Arnet his confused eyes.   The hug had gone on longer than was polite, and I finally realized what part of the problem was. Nathaniel was the least dominant person I'd ever met. He wanted out of the hug, but he could not be the first one to pull back. Jessica had to let him go, and she was probably waiting for him to move away, and getting all the wrong singles from the fact that he wasn't moving away. Shit. How do I end up with men in my life that have such interesting problems? Lucky, I guess.   I held out my hand towards him, and the relief on his face was clear enough that anyone down the hall would have seen it, and understood it. He kept his face turned so Jessica never saw that look. It would have hurt her feelings, and Nathaniel didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Which meant that he didn't see her shining face, all aglow with what she thought was mutual attraction. Truthfully, I'd thought Nathaniel liked her, at least a little, but his face said otherwise. To me, anyway.   Nathaniel came to my hand like a scared child that's just been saved from the neighborhood bully. I drew him into a hug, and he clung to me, pressing our bodies tighter than I would have liked in public, but I couldn't blame him, not really. He wanted the comfort of physical contact, and I think he'd figured out that Jessica Arnet had gotten the wrong idea.   I held him, as close as I could, as close as I'd wanted to hold Micah. But with Micah, it might have led to embarrassing things, but not with Nathaniel. With Nathaniel I could control myself. I wasn't in love with him. I caressed the long braid of his auburn hair that fell nearly to his ankles. I played with the braid, as if it were other more intimate things, hoping that Jessica would take the hint. I should have known that a little extra hugging wouldn't have done the job.   I drew back from the hug first, and he kept his gaze on my face. I could study his face and understand what she saw there, so handsome, so amazingly beautiful. His shoulders had broadened in the last few months, weight lifting, or just the fact that he was twenty and still filling out. He was luscious to look at, and I was almost certain he would be nearly as luscious in bed as he looked. But though he was living with me; cleaning my house, buying my groceries, running my errands, I still hadn't had intercourse with him. I was really trying to avoid that, since I didn't plan on keeping him. Someday Nathaniel would need to find a new place to live, a new life, because I wouldn't always need him the way I did now.   I was human, but just as I was the first human Nimir-Ra, the leopards had ever had, I was also the first human servant of a master vampire to acquire certain . . . abilities. With those abilities came some downsides. One of those downsides was needing to feed the arduer every twelve hours, or so. The arduer is French for flame, roughly translates to being consumed, being consumed by love. But it isn't exactly love.   I stared up into Nathaniel's wide lilac eyes, cradled his face between my hands. I did the only thing I could think of that might keep Jessica Arnet from embarrassing them both at the reception to follow. I kissed him. I kissed him, because he needed me to do it. I kissed him because it was strangely the right thing to do. I kissed him because he was my pomme de sang, my apple of blood. I kissed him because he was my food, and I hated the fact that anyone was my food. I fed off of Micah, too, but he was my partner, my boyfriend, and he was dominant enough to say no, if he wanted to. Nathaniel wanted me to take him, wanted to belong to me, and I didn't know what to do about it. Months from now the arduer would be under control and I wouldn't need a pomme de sang. What would Nathaniel do when I didn't need him anymore?   I drew back from the kiss and watched Nathaniel's face shine at me the way Jessica Arnet's face had shone at him. I wasn't in love with Nathaniel, but staring up into that happy, handsome face, I was afraid that I couldn't say the same for him. I was using him. Not for sex, but for food. He was food, just food, but even as I thought it, I knew it was partly a lie. You don't fall in love with your steak, because it can't hold you, can't press warm lips in the bend of your neck, and whisper, "Thank you," as it glides down the hallway in the charcoal gray slacks that fit it's ass like a second skin, and spill roomy over the thighs, that you happen to know are even lovelier out of the pants than in. When I turned to the next smiling person in line, I caught Detective Jessica Arnet giving me a look. It wasn't an entirely friendly look. Great, just great.

      The club was dark except for a single soft spotlight in the middle of the stage. In that soft, white light Jean-Claude stood. The light hit only his shoulders and face, the rest of him was lost to darkness. It gave the illusion that his body formed from the darkness itself, to rise to the shining paleness of his face, the gleaming white of his cravat, the tiny colored spark of the sapphire winking only when he moved. His hair looked as if the darkness had been drawn out into some dark thread and formed into curls. The only color was the drowning blue of his eyes, and the crimson smear of lipstick across his face. It wasn’t my lipstick, or at least not most of it.   His voice floated through the darkened room. “Who will taste my kiss?” Taste left a sweetness on my tongue, as if I’d licked a piece of candy. Kiss gave a ghost of lips brushing my cheek. “Who will embrace me?” Embrace made me feel faintly warm, as if I’d been given a really good hug, by someone I cared about.   Jean-Claude’s voice had always been good, but not this good. Not this good. With my partial immunity, I probably wasn’t getting all of it. I had no idea how much more the audience was getting. It took a force of will to look away from him in that shining circle of light. I made myself look out into the audience. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the dark, but when I could see, nearly every face was turned to him. They gazed up at him in the dark as if he were the rising sun and they had never seen anything so bright before. Only a handful of faces weren’t turned toward the stage. A few women were shaking their heads and looking confused. A little psychic talent of the right kind or with the right practice, and it helped. Marianne had proven to me that you didn’t have to be a necromancer to have some immunity to vampire mind tricks.   One of the few men was standing up, and the woman with him was tugging on his arm, trying to get him to sit back down. He was shaking his head adamantly. No, no he wouldn’t sit in the dark and let that voice wash over him. He didn’t understand that it wasn’t a matter of sexual orientation. It was Jean-Claude. His power was seduction and it nothing––and everything––to do with sex.   Two of the waiters were escorting a woman up on stage. She was tall and almost anorexically thin, which meant she’d been waving more money than anybody else. Jean-Claude preferred more curves on his women. As he’d pointed out to me, the beauties of his day in the French courts were today’s size 20. Most of the old vamps liked short women with curves. Most of us were lliving in so the wrong century.   The lights around the stage had been growing bright so gradually that if you’d been gazing at the stage the entire time, you might not have noticed. The light was just barely bright enough so the audience could see more of their bodies. From the waist up, you could see Jean-Claude’s pale hands sliding over the woman’s body. Nothing déclassé, but he git more out of simply touching her back, shoulder, waist, than some men got out of breast and groin. Sometimes it’s not what you touch but how you touch it.   He pressed her against the front of his body so there was no space between them, so that her thin frame seemed almost to mold itself to his body. He lifted her face up to meet his, using one pale hand to cradle her face so that he would control the kiss. His arm slid around her waist, and tightened. Tightened enough to bow her neck, and make her mouth open in a surprised little ‘o’. One of the women before this one had groped him, so he’d made sure there wasn’t enough daylight between the front of their bodies for anyone’s hands to wander too far. The women seemed to take closer frontal contact as a sign of favor. I knew it wasn’t. It was a sign of control, and damn near displeasure.   But when he bowed his head to her mouth, and locked their lips together in a kiss, there was no displeasure. He kissed her as if he were trying to breathe her down his mouth. He fed from her lips almost as of he were feeding from her neck. And in a way, he was, feeding at least.   He fed from their mouths in a way that the Dragon’s presence in my head had told me about. Except she knew how to eat the essence of the dead, and make the undead, really, truly dead. Jean-Claude was not doing that, but it was eerily similar. He was feeding, feeding the arduer, from a kiss.   “Nikoloas would never let him feed like that,” a quiet voice said from behind me. I turned to find buzz right behind me. I hadn’t heard him, or sensed him, which meant I’d been more caught up in the show than I’d realized.   “What do you mean?” I asked. “Nikoloas knew that he was feeding off the audience without ever touching them, so she forbade him to touch any of the customers.” His eyes went past me to the stage. “I think she had some clue what he could have been, and she did everything she could to make sure he didn’t come into that power.”   “She’s been dead almost three years. You make it sound like tonight is the first time you’ve seen this show.”   He looked at me. “It is.” I gave him wide eyes. “Nikoloas was dead, she couldn’t stop him.”   “But you could,” he said.   “What do you mean?”   “Do you really think three years ago you would have dated him after you saw this?   I glanced back at the stage. I watched him kissing a strange woman as if she were his deepest love, or at least deepest lust. Would I have tolerated this three years ago? No. Would I have used it as an excuse to dump his ass? Oh, yeah.   The woman swooned in his arms. Her mouth falling away from his as she seemed to half-faint, as if the kiss alone were so intense that she couldn’t stay conscious. I would have thought she was play-acting, or exaggerating, but I had to believe it, as the waiters carried her off stage, and gave her back to her friends at her table.   Jean-Claude gazed out at the audience with fresh crimson lipstick smeared across his entire lower jaw. It looked eerily like blood, and I knew him well enough to that the resemblance was not accidental. His blue eyes had bled to solid blue light, as if a summer’s dusk could burn his eyes. “Who will be next?” And it was as if he whispered along my skin, as if he were standing just behind me. The illusion was so strong that I had to fight not to turn around and look. I was supposed to be immune to this crap. If this is how I was feeling, what must all those eager faces be feeling?   I lowered my shields just enough to see Jean-Claude shining with power. This was what he was meant to be. This wasn’t just feeling the arduer. This wasn’t a substitute for a blood feed. This was an end in itself. This was something I’d never seen, not in Jean-Claude, not in anyone. It was akin to all his other abilities, but more, somehow this was more.   I turned back to Buzz. “Him feeding like this is what saved me.”   He looked puzzled, vampires under twenty years dead have so many more human facial expressions. “Saved you from what?”   “If he hadn’t fed, then I’d have had to feed for him. That’s one of the things a human is servant for. We feed when the vamps can’t. I would still be trapped backstage f*cking my metaphysical brains out.” I shook my head. “No, thank you.”   “So you’re not disappointed when he’s doing it to strangers?”   I felt my face go sort of unfriendly. “You sound disappointed that I’m not upset about this, why?” He raised his hands, making his big arms flex, I think by accident. He meant it to be a harmless gesture, but he was too muscle bound for it to look anything but impressive, or scary, depending on how you looked at it.   “It just seems like a fast turn around, That’s all.”   I sighed. “The last time Jean-Claude asked me if I could feed off the audience, I didn’t really understand what he was asking.” I smiled, but not like I was happy. “Besides, I wasn’t f*cking strangers to feed the vampiric powers then. Strangely, that’s changed my mind about a lot of things.”   He looked way too serious for my tastes.   I didn’t know what was up with Buzz, so I decided to change topics. “Primo all tucked away in the spare coffin?”   “We put him in while you were cleaning up.”   I nodded. I’d been told about it, but I’d also laid hands on the coffin, and felt Primo trapped inside, behind silver chains and a holy item. It wasn’t that I didn’t trust everybody, it was just good business to be cautious. Buzz’s odd behavior hadn’t changed my mind about that, not one little bit.   “Lisandro told me that you ordered him to babysit the coffin.”   I nodded. “Yes, I did.”   “Primo is in a cross-wrapped coffin, Anita. He’s not getting out.”   I shrugged. Lisandro was tall, dark, handsome, with the longest hair that any of the new security had. He was also the only one with a gun tucked into the small of his back under the black t-shirt. Once I spotted the gun, I pegged him for a wererat, and I’d been right. I told him if Primo started to tear out of the coffin, to kill him. Jean-Claude would probably have agreed with me, but he’d been busy on stage, so I made the call for both of us. I was happy with the call, and I didn’t like that Buzz wasn’t.   “Let’s just say I feel better going off to raise the dead, knowing that Lisandro is sitting by that coffin with silver ammo, and a willingness to shoot.”   “I’m head of security here, Anita. You should have cleared it by me.”   I sighed. “You’re right. You’re right, I should have. I’m sorry.”   He just blinked at me like a deer caught in headlights. I think he’d expected an argument. But I was tired, and late, and feeing squeegie about having had sex with Byron and Requiem.   “I’ve got to go, Buzz.”   “Your security detail is waiting at the door,” He said, and nodded towards the door in question.   Requiem was by the door in his black cloak with a fresh pair of pants that he’d borrowed from someone underneath it. The new pants were leather, so he’d probably borrowed them from another dancer. But we had a new addition, and that was the dark haired werewolf that had fallen on top of Clay and me when Primo was fighting everyone. His name was Graham, and his body had that width of shoulder and impressive swell of arm that only a semi-serious weight lifting can get you. His black hair was cut in a longish layer on top so that it fell like a silken fringe over his ears, but underneath the hair was shaved close to his head and upper neck. It seemed an odd haircut to me, but it wasn’t my hair.   His face was exotic, in the way that people can be when some ancestor didn’t come from northern or southern Europe. The straight black hair, the ever so slight up-tilt to the edge of his eyes made me bet on something much farther east.   I’d argued that I didn’t need or want guards, but just a I’d made the call about Primo and Lisandro, so Jean-Claude had given his orders before he got carried away on stage. I was to go nowhere without someone with me. He wasn’t sure the Dragon was done with us for the night, and it would be a shame if something went horribly wrong. What he hadn’t told the security detail, vampire or otherwise, was about what happened earlier in my office. That had nothing to do with the dragon and everything to do with my own metaphysical sh!t. Well. Mine, and Jean-Claude’s.   Jean-Claude had even left a list of people he thought were appropriate to the job. Byron had not been on the list, nor had Clay. It had been a damn short list, actually, basically Requiem and Graham. The last thing I wanted to do was be trapped in a car with Requiem, but I didn’t have time to argue. I’d gone from having plenty of time, to having to call my clients and tell them to hold fast in the cemetery, I really was on my way.   I was wearing Byron’s leather jacket to take the place of my bloodied suit jacket. His was the only one that came close to fitting me, and not making me look like I was wearing the upper half of a gorilla. It smelled faintly of his cologne.   Buzz’s eyes left me and went to the audience. The man who had been arguing with his date was still standing, but now so was the woman and she was starting to make a scene.   “Sorry, gotta catch that.’   “Be my guest,” I said.   Nathaniel seemed to appear from nowhere. He escorted me towards the outer door. He was smiling, and seemed terribly at ease, more so than I’d seen him in a long time, maybe ever. It seemed an odd night to be happy. “You promised to be back in time to see some of my act,” he said, smiling.   “I’ve got two clients stuck in cemeteries,” I said.   He gave me the look, that was half-pout, and half-he-knew-he’d-already won the argument.   “You promised.”   “Can’t we just f*ck at home later?” I asked.   He gave me a frown. “I’ll be furry, you don’t do furry.”   I had an idea, an awful idea. “I promised to mark your neck tonight. Oh, no, you so are not planning on me doing it in front of an audience?”   He smiled, and there was something in that smile I hadn’t seen before. Something of confidence, of security that hadn’t been there before. He’d watched me have sex with two near strangers and now he felt more secure. Go figure.   “You little exhibitionist, you,” I said, “you like the idea of me marking you for the first time in front of all these people.”   He gave an aw-gee-shucks shrug, which was all act, because his eyes were bright with the answer. “I like a lot of things, Anita.”   I tried to frown at him, but couldn’t keep it up. “You got me to promise I’d mark you, and now you’re taking advantage of it.”   ‘You’re running late,” he said, “clients waiting in the cemetery.” He looked solemn excerpt for the glint of humor in his eyes, which spoiled the effect.   I shook my head, smiling. “I’ve got to go.”   “I know,” he said.   “Would it ruin the illusion if I kissed you good-bye?”   “I’ll risk it,” he said.   I kissed him. It was chaste, a touch of lips, a little pressure, barely any body language. I drew back with a suspicious look on my face. It made him laugh, and push me towards the door. “You’re late, remember.”   I went, but I went out into the October dark, even more certain that I knew absolutely nothing about the men. Alright, to be fair, that I knew absolutely nothing about the men in my life. I glanced back to see Jean-Claude on stage with another woman, kissing her as if he were trying to find her tonsils without his hands. Most people looked disturbing or awkward when they kissed that deep, he didn’t. He made it all seem suave, erotic, and perfect. I realized I’d kissed Nathaniel good-bye, but not Jean-Claude. Didn’t want to interrupt, but didn’t want him to feel left out either. I blew him a kiss as his arms emptied of the woman. He returned the gesture with one pale hand. The lower half of his face was smeared bright red with crimson lipstick. It didn’t really look like blood, not if you had seen enough of the real deal, but it was still a less comforting image to take away into the night. One of the other men in my life was smiling at the door, looking forward to having me do foreplay in front of an audience. Sometimes the parts of my life that are weirdest to me aren’t the parts dealing with vampires and werewolves and zombies. Even vampire politics didn’t confuse me as much as my own love life

      Hey everyone,   Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about what to do. I've added a links section for you. I hope you enjoy because it took me a while to sort through the many sites and pick out some of the best ones. As you see, we have established a new domain for our web site, but are not done with the site itself. Hopefully we'll be able to add more stuff to the site in the next few weeks. Yes, I&nbsp; know there are some mistakes and they will be corrected soon (I hope).  Ok, I am off to bed.   Good Night Kids

      Hey guys! Here's the latest news from the  urlLink Laurell_Hamilton  yahoo group:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   SOS, Auction News, Dinner/Silent Auction to benefit Granite City APA      Support Our Soliders Dance in NYC and Florida ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------  Besides the dance there will be a silent auction and you know we donated  goodies for that!   Next week we're printing the SOS Gala Brochure (Wait till you see the snazzy  cover) and it will be up soon at our web site, giving details of Nov. 13.  Tickets for the day are $200 for local New Yorkers. The cost for Patriettes is  still $150 - but we may be sold out quite soon. At least reserve a ticket with  Nancy and pay later if you're definite about attending - nancy@romantictimes.com  .   We will have 25 "returned" soldiers (and "recovering") or more as our guests  during the day and more for the Dance Canteen. Due to the size of the  ballroom, we're limited to 300 for supper and sit-down functions. The Book Fair  and  Dance Party can accommodate much larger crowds. So the more the merrier for  these two events.   We're also working on a very special "Salute to the Flag" opening ceremony at  10 am and a "patriotic" candle lighting tradition. I think it will be a  powerful way to kick off our first SOS Saturday for the soldiers.   Catch it all at http://www.romantictimes.com   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   Lisa Berger Hosts Dance Night at Florida Ballroom, Nov. 11, Veterans Day   Dance Champion, Patriette, our own Terpsichore Lisa Berger will be hosting a  SOS America Benefit at a Ballroom in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area on  Thursday evening, November 11. (The next morning she flies in to us on Jet Blue  to teach swing and jitterbug at our Gala.)   Email her at dance007@bellsouth.net, if you'd like to attend and watch some  great dance exhibitions. The entrance fee is minimal. Come alone or with a  dance partner. You'll meet other Patriettes.

NEW ANTHOLOGY -------------------------------------------------------------- The original short story Laurell wrote that wasn't long enough is going to get used! Here is a note from the publisher:  The book is pubbing in January 05, if you can believe that. In Jove, same as Cravings, only this one is all-vamp.  The other authors, all writing original stories using their principle characters and/or worlds are Charlaine Harris, MaryJanice Davidson,(who is in Cravings) Angela Knight,(a Sensation author who writes vampires in a kind of fantasy Arthurian world)and Vickie Taylor, who hasn't been pubbed by Berkley yet (coming in later 2005, I believe) but who does a Paranormal series for Harlequin involving gargoyles. (Romantic Paranormal with gargoyles--that must be interesting!  )   That's it for this bit! Smiles....Darla
