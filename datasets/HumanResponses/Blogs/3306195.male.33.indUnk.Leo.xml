      There's been travel and there's been rain, so there hasn't been much going on in the garden. However, Marny put together some great container plantings for the deck. They really spruce things up and, once it stops raining, I'll take pictures of them and post them.   Within the next week, I have to set up the second vegetable bed. I already put the wood frame together, just have to clear out the grass from the site and fill it with dirt and stuff (i.e. cow poop).

      This seemed like a good day to start this blog. As I write this we are having a shed built at the end of our driveway. Today is the last day I'll have to lug all of my garden tools out of the basement every time I want to do some yard work.  Over the last month, Marny and I cleared out the site. Then I had a large pile of dirt delivered so I could even out the site and tamp it down. I finished fine tuning it this morning and now the shed is going up!  Eventually, that area will also feature a new bench/garden arbor, gravel covering the ground and container plantings. But, all of that will have to wait a little while. Next up is the vegetable garden. I'm doubling the size of last year's veggie garden and I need to start getting the new bed ready. My seedlings are starting to come up and will need to be replanted in a few weeks.   urlLink    the mess before...   urlLink    after clean up.   urlLink    the shed going up!   urlLink    All done! (Soon it will be painted white and blue, like the house)

      Before I get into this new post, here's a picture of one of the beautiful containers Marny put together two weeks ago... We'll make a gardener out of her yet!   urlLink    nice, huh?  Since we moved in, there's been a big circle of sand in the backyard that used to house a pool. Early last summer I added a big pile (4 cubic feet) of loam to it, to be used for the vegetable garden. The intent was to then spread the rest of the loam out to fill in the sand circle, plant grass and have a nice lawn.   The pile of loam sat there until THIS summer, when we decided to add another vegetable bed and I had 4 MORE cubic feet of loam delivered.   Well, this past Sunday (May 30th), Marny and I put up the new veggie bed, spread out the loam and planted grass seed! The vegetable plants will go in tomorrow (weather permitting).  Here's a picture of the new and improved back yard...   urlLink    grass (and vegetables) coming soon

      I'm feeling a little better about my To-Do list. I've got about 85% of it done (I obviously accomplished a lot since yesterday morning!), and still have all day Sunday to finish things up. Now, onto the things that have gotten done:  First of all, the shed is finished! I just put the finishing touches on it (marigolds in the window box and birdhouses hanging from each corner)   urlLink      Remember I mentioned that dilapidated storage bin/box that was falling apart and needed to be replaced? Here's a picture of what it used to look like:   urlLink      Yesterday I took a sledgehammer to it and three hours later it was broken up in bins for the trash. Unfortunately, they wouldn't take it! Regardless, I'm thrilled that it's been taken down:   urlLink    note all the remnants that the trash men would not take away. I have to lug it all to the dump myself! :(    Do you also remember the circle of sand that became the circle with piles of dirt that became the spread out dirt with grass seed? Well... it's a lawn now!   urlLink    the new lawn  Though I've still got a few things to do before my vacation is over, I'm feeling very good about what I've accomplished so far. Plus, I've learned a valuable lesson.  Things rarely take as long as you think they will.  I kept putting off the demolition of the wooden box near the driveway, dreading it and not wanting to do it. Well, it turns out that 3 hours with a sledgehammer (great for any pent up aggression you might have!) was all it took. I now know that I'm better off jumping right in and just doing it, rather than agonizing about it.   that's it for now. more to come early next week!

      Marny and I have been VERY busy in the yard and we've accomplished a lot. I'm on vacation this coming week, so even more will get done. We're putting the finishing touches on the shed tomorrow so we'll have pictures up soon.  I've made up a to-do list for my vacation (don't get me wrong, I LOVE working in the yard, so spending a whole week doing that  is  a vacation for me). Here's the list of what I hope to accomplish:  -Finish painting shed/re-attach shutters and window box  -Demolish wooden "box" near driveway (a ramshackle storage bin that needs to go!)  -clean grill and replace briquets (which are coated with grease)  -install drip watering system in vegetable garden  -trim back trees along back of yard  -Put down landscape fabric and new mulch in front beds.  -install edging around front beds  -put up new mailbox (long story involving an "unknown" car that ran over our old mailbox - we know who did it, but he won't admit it)  -have Thai dinner with lovely wife (Marny's contribution to my To-Do list!)   It seems like a long list, but once I get into a groove I can get a lot done. I'll check in at the end of the week to let you know how I did and show off some pictures.  Happy Fourth everyone!

      On Friday, Jeannette and I went to Tranquil Lake Nursery in nearby Rehobeth MA. Lots of back roads to get there, but it was well worth it! I picked up three new plants including a Yarrow, a Golden Curls Willow:   urlLink     and a Butterfly Bush. Within in ten minutes of planting the Butterfly Bush, we had our first butterfly on it!   urlLink      I finally got around to putting the lattice up around the bottom of the shed, giving it a truly finished look. Now I have to landscape around it. One thing at a time!
