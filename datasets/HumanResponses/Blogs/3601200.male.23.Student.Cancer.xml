        I first ran into Rick at   urlLink  http://www.lies.com   . He seemed like a pretty decent guy -- a bit partisan to the left, but then, most people on lies.com lean one way or another. Too far one way or another, IMHO. Rick usually has some good points oh his blog and comes across as well educated. A stark contrast to the seemingly-headstrong-17-year-old persona he embodies at lies.com. I had no problem with him.  The operative word being "had."  It was in this thread on lies.com (   urlLink  http://www.lies.com/wp/2004/07/18/why-you-should-vote-for-bush/    ) where I would kick loose the pebbles which would in turn jar a boulder that continues to chase me in quite an "Indiana Jones-esque" manner. A boulder of middle-aged fury that follows insignificant little me through this world of big news and important happenings.  I'm sure that anyone who wants to can navigate lies.com and Radically Inept in order to find the sequence of events which is (currently, as of this writing) going on. In short, I disagreed with Rick's assertion that Hitler is interchangeable with Bush, and he then started to go at me on his own site. But it doesn't end there -- I replied to this, and he then chopped that reply to little bits and put me in the context of some assaulting individual to which he was replying to defend himself.  All I can say is that Rick lost a faithful reader of his blog this week. I had a respect for him up until this point, where he proved that he's yet another person with a "with me or against me" complex and is completely disrespectful to those who don't share his views. Partially because of his background, he seems to think he is an expert of all things political, and actually says that me calling him ignorant of Hitler's atrocities is ironic because of his bio.  In short, Rick's background is that he's an American, but he particularly mentions his parents being an escaped East German and a Soldier. My mother has a doctorate in Accounting and holds seminars teaching standards to people all over the world for thousands of dollars per person per day. I help construct her training materials. That doesn't make me an expert commentator of all things in the accounting world.  Rick should more accurately place in his bio that he has no qualifications to speak on anything aside from pest control, for which he's licensed, and "public policy" in which he has a master's [degree]. He's just another schmuck with an internet connection (like the rest of us bloggers). And that's all I have to say on this subject. Unlike Rick, I won't go through the painstaking task of segmenting his writings so I can spin it against him. I'll just let people draw their own conclusions. I don't see it as such a big deal when another person, out of the 6 or so billion in the world, disagrees with my opinions.  Best wishes, Mr. Pietz.

        I've been asked by a few people now (thanks for the email) why my posts here are the length that they are.&nbsp; I hadn't really noticed that they conform to a specific size, but for the most part they do.&nbsp; It's almost kind of creepy as it was not planned this way.

        A few quotes that have one thing or another to do with Patriotism -- which&nbsp;has&nbsp;been used to piss on Americans&nbsp;for the last few years.&nbsp; Particularly in&nbsp;the "Patriot Act," which is probably the most downright stomping on of civil liberties since slavery or segregation:     &nbsp;

         urlLink http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=objectivity        urlLink http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=objective       Before I launch into my cavalcade of political rants which will probably flood this blog, I'd like to take a moment to speak of objectivity.&nbsp; By definition, humans can't be objective.&nbsp; We have too many emotions which affect our judgment.    However, this isn’t the be-all, end-all disclaimer some people would like.&nbsp; Although it is impossible to be completely objective, one should try to remain as objective as possible, particularly when writing for an audience of millions.    This means that all facts have to be taken into considerations constantly.&nbsp; Being objective to a point, then making up your mind and refusing to change your ideas based on new information isn’t objectivity.    That said, it is my solemn promise to those of you who waste your life reading this site that in all my political writings, just as in all my other writings, I will try my best to be objective.&nbsp; At every opportunity I can I will point out both the positives and negatives to any situation where I can see both, and if I miss something, please, feel free to email me or post a comment.    I’m not trying to change anyone’s mind, make money, or control the fate of the world vicariously through my readers.&nbsp; I’m not trying to tell you what’s right and what’s wrong.&nbsp; I’m trying only to entertain and occasionally educate people.&nbsp; And, just maybe, make a few friends.

        If you disliked "Hellboy", "Daredevil", "The Hulk", and any other movie whose budget seemed to pay for everything except a good writer, you'll dislike this&nbsp;craptacular crap-fest&nbsp;as well.&nbsp; However, in the name of objectivity, I'm going to cover both the good and the bad aspects.   First the good, as it's so little:   This movie really accentuates just how hard it is for Peter Parker and Spiderman to coexist.&nbsp; With so much crime fighting, Parker's life goes to shit.&nbsp; This is incredibly deep, and while it's covered in the comics quite well, such things are usually left out of "action" movies.&nbsp; As this isn't the central point of the movie, I won't really ruin it by saying that Parker actually gives up being Spiderman (for a while) and loses his powers.   Another positive aspect is the effects.&nbsp; It seems that someone finally realized that the key to effective CGI is to not make it stick out by having backgrounds that accentuate it.&nbsp; Bravo.&nbsp; They definitely raised the bar since the first movie.   Now comes the bad stuff:   The villain.&nbsp; Doctor Otto Octavius.&nbsp; True, he is kind of a nerd (most physicists are)&nbsp;and slightly overweight in the comics, but damn, Alfred Molina looks like a friggin' garbage man.&nbsp; And the trench coat?&nbsp; WHY?&nbsp; By FAR the worst cast role and worst translated villain&nbsp;in this or any other movie.   The plot.&nbsp; Aside from Parker struggling with the duality of Spiderman, this is incredibly poor.&nbsp; The duality struggle needn't even be included (you KNOW he has to go back to being Spiderman in order to save the city/world).&nbsp; But the whole "scientist's experiment fails so he has to try it again" is so damn hollow.&nbsp; WHY does he have to try it again in the exact same way, but bigger?&nbsp; It failed, that's science.&nbsp; Move on, try some variation.   Perhaps the worst&nbsp;aspect is&nbsp;the transitions.&nbsp; This movie was so obviously filmed out of sequence that it's scary.&nbsp; It clunks along like someone throwing pots and pans and cats&nbsp;down the stairs.&nbsp; The characters all go through some kind of "metamorphosis" that's supposed to be really deep and philosophical, but instead is hokey and contrived.&nbsp; Doc Oc even repents his evil ways and saves the day at the end.&nbsp; Weak.   All in all, I gave it a 1.5/5.0.&nbsp; And that's being generous.&nbsp; Hopefully, soon, the movie industry will get over its obsession with comic books.&nbsp; But it won't stop with Spiderman 2 -- oh no... Harry Osbourne found his father's Green Goblin equipment stash behind "the mirror".&nbsp; Those of you who know the comic&nbsp;know what happens next, and those of you expecting these horrible comic book movies to stop will have to suffer at LEAST another one.      Seriously, America, get some TASTE.&nbsp; Just because Ebert and Roper's review of Spiderman 2, brought to you by Spiderman 2 and Sprite, says the movie is great doesn't mean it is.&nbsp; I saw it for free, and honestly, I feel I was ripped off.&nbsp; Don't see Spiderman 2.&nbsp; Don't see Spiderman 3.&nbsp; Don't see any more comic book movies.&nbsp; Maybe then, once they've stopped making obscene amounts of money off of these crappy movies, the&nbsp;film industry will go out and hire some TALENT and make a good movie or two.

        I used to dream, once upon a time.&nbsp; When I was younger I would stare off into the ceiling during lectures in school, fantasizing.  "When I grow up, I want to be a -"  "CLARK!&nbsp; Pay attention!"  I would listen to the rest of the lecture, secure in the knowledge that when I grew up people like my teacher would&nbsp;rely on me to potentially save their lives&nbsp;for&nbsp;what I would become.&nbsp; This carried on throughout grade school.  Finally, when I was free of the horrors of grades one through five, I was able to continue my aspirations unhindered in junior high.&nbsp; Lunch would roll around, afterwards recess.&nbsp; While I played football, I'd drift off once more into my future.  "When I grow up, I want to be a -"  THUMP.&nbsp; The football would fall into my arms and I had to run for my life, lest I be tackled by any number of overweight pre-pubescent children who were more than willing to destroy my lanky, disproportionate body.  I would play the rest of the game, secure in the knowledge that when I grew up people like my&nbsp;classmates would be&nbsp;impressed by&nbsp;what I would become.&nbsp; This carried on throughout junior high.  After junior high came four years of fun; high school.&nbsp; Walking through the halls from one class to the next, I looked forward to what was to be.  "When I grow up, I want to be a -"  "Hi, Clark," said the beautiful girl with the green eyes as I passed her in the hall.&nbsp; I was completely awestruck by the opposite sex, and couldn't remember my initial train of thought.&nbsp; Such things were&nbsp;torture, however, as I never once went on a date with anyone from my school.  I would&nbsp;struggle through the days, secure in the knowledge that when I grew up people like&nbsp;the beautiful girls&nbsp;would&nbsp;want to ride&nbsp;me for&nbsp;what I would become.&nbsp; This carried on throughout&nbsp;high school.  After school, I got a job.&nbsp; I saved every penny for two years.&nbsp; It was then that my heart sank, and my dream died.&nbsp; For that day, when I walked into the doctor's office, I learned that no amount of money could buy a procedure to turn me into a fire engine.

        I was watching TV the other day when I saw a commercial for Kool-Aid.&nbsp; It seems their newest marketing gimmick is that the sugar water is cold without adding ice.&nbsp; After the commercial I was shocked – no, not because they’re potentially adding&nbsp;dangerous chemical&nbsp;to the Kool-Aid to increase the evaporation rate in order to make it “feel cooler,” but rather because of the “Kool-Aid Man” himself who distracted me so much I didn’t even notice what the commercial was about until a second viewing.   I’m going to do a bit of background here.&nbsp; You all remember the “Kool-Aid Man” right?&nbsp; Big sentient clear pitcher of red Kool-Aid, black line for a mouth and dots for eyes, propensity for busting through walls and saying, “Oh Yeah!” like&nbsp;the slightly retarded cousin&nbsp;of&nbsp;“Macho Man” Randy Savage.&nbsp; Now, think really hard, just how well do you remember him?   Well, if you’re cursed to remember every single commercial in your life as I am, you’ll quickly notice the “Kool-Aid Man” now has pants on.&nbsp; Shorts, actually.&nbsp; Khaki shorts to be exact.&nbsp; My roommate and I turned to each other after seeing this with the exact same “what the hell?” look on our faces.&nbsp; I was the first to say something after an awkward silence.   “What the shit, the “Kool-Aid Man” doesn’t have a wang, he doesn’t need pants!”&nbsp; Similar dialogue was retorted by my roommate, and we laughed about it all night (did I mention we were quite drunk?) while watching equally asinine shows and playing video games.   Today, over breakfast, we returned to the topic by proposing the “Kool-Aid Man” busting through a wall with a two-foot-long brilliant red&nbsp;phallus in his hand rather than a refreshing pitcher of Kool-Aid.&nbsp; We basically agreed that the “Kool-Aid Man” is really a “man” in name only (usually called “guy” by younger children.)&nbsp; My roommate never saw the “Kool-Aid Man” as a potential child molester until now, and I don’t think anyone in their right mind wondered why a colossal pitcher of vibrant red fruit-flavored drink didn’t have a penis.     His sexual ambiguity and innocence has been ruined by the Kool-Aid people with this move. &nbsp;Whether it’s an attempt to freshen up the image, appeal to the “x-treme” crowd, or due to pressure put on by concerned parents is unknown.&nbsp; What IS known is that a childhood icon – a CULTURAL icon – has been defaced.&nbsp; Please, Kool-Aid, bring back the stark-naked hero that is the original “Kool-Aid Man”!

        Now, as some of you who read my rants and ramblings know, I try to remain objective. You may also know that I'm a HUGE fan of the Alien and Predator movies. You might also just happen to be aware of the fact that I think there have been no more than a dozen good movies produced since 1995.

      Alien Versus Predator.  It's the movie we've all been waiting for since the 80's.  I'm sure that any fan can remember squirming in anticipation when, in Predator 2, they say the Alien skull on the trophy wall of the Predator's ship.  But no, we'd have to wait for ten years before this idea came to fruition.  And now it has.  So what do you do when a movie comes out that is the ideological child of two of the greatest action/horror franchises of all time?  An idea so strong that it has spawned web sites, comic books, video games, and a whole slew of nerds?  What you do is go see the movie.  There are wo distinct possibilities here.  Possibility one (1) is that the movie rocks.  Unequivicable awesomeness just seeps from its every moment, and this movie is responsible for the nerd population of the world dropping by three-quarters due to so many fanboys dropping like flies from pleasure-induced anuerisms.  Possibility two (2) is that the movie sucks.  And sucks bad.  So insanely bad that it makes God cry.  There is no middleground here where this movie could just be average due to the hype behind it, at least among the fans.  Most normal people probably don't know about it as it hasn't been too terribly advertised, to its credit.  Personally, I hope that it's good, although I expect it to be bad.  First off, I'm not a big action/horror buff, so action movies have to be pretty damn good to impress me.  Second, with the slew of crappy movies which have been coming out lately, ANY good movie is in short supply.  Third, I'm an AVP fan.  I know all the backstory and whatnot behind both the Aliens and Predator franchises.  Here's to hoping.  I'll post my review tomorrow night.

        First off, the title is deceiving.  I've been swamped with school, work, and moving.  This is pretty much why I haven't been writing.  Well, that and the forces of evil are directly behind me, waiting to devour my soul the moment I pause for breath.

        What follows is a test to determine whether or not you are a zombie. Please bear in mind that this test is ONLY to determine if you are a zombie, and may not assist you in determining if you are some other type of undead. Though there are few questions, this test is over 150% accurate if answered truthfully.

        Both the republicans and democrats are insistent that their horse (Bush and Kerry, respectively) is going to win the race, and by a landslide, at that. I'm going to look at a few possibilities and explain the scenarios and circumstances under which each would happen.
