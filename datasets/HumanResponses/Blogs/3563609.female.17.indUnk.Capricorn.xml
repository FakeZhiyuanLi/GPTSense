      Wow, so I haven't written in a while. I was out of town tho, so I have an excuse sorta. Well this weekend was S.T.A.R.conference in Nacadoches (as unique as its name....I say GAY). So yeah, it was at SFA...and it was actually really really fun. I roomed with Sunny and Jennifer was there and another girl from my school named Kayla who I didnt really know before but I got to know which was cool. We went to some workshop type things and learned a buncha stuff, but we also had hecka lotta fun and talk about some inside jokes! Winabago!....Theres meat on my pants!....Lumberjack...stuff!...."Hey are you listening to that?", "What? The silent movie?"....I cant walk up stairs....JCT (Jesus Christ Trail)....(perky lady at Taco Bell)"AND we have a NEW Menu!!!"....R-E-S-P-E-C-T!....yeah i cant think of any more...but it was funny...you had to be there. Anyway, yeah I dont know what else to talk about. Tonight i went and played tennis...that was interesting. I got kinda bored after like 30 minutes so then I went and swang on swings. (duno if swang is a word...but it is in MY dictionary). But yeah, fun stuff lemme tell ya. Ok time to go, theres yalls update you were so excited about! WOOO

      You know those days you wake up and you think "man, today is gonna be a blast" then it isn't and you are disappointed? Ok, well today wasnt that type of day. It was more like I didnt wake up thinking anything cuz I was too tired and it turned out being an OK day anyway. So I went to class this morning and the good thing was that we got out early...again. But the bad thing was for the time we were in class I was sleeping through the notes for the most part. I dont know what it is, I went to sleep early last night (by that i mean 12:30) and still I cant stay awake at that hour of the morning. I have issues. But after class the day got better. First I took a shower and then my friend Courtney called me and invited me to go to lunch w/ her and Ryan and Beka from church camp. I don't get to see them much so I went and we went to Fridays out by Stonebriar. You will not believe what Christina did too..I drove on the highway all by myself!! WOWIE! Haha, i know you would think that a girl who has had her license for like a year now would have already done that, but no not me. I was proud that I didnt get lost on the way either..usually I do even if the place is close. So props to me. haha. So that took a while cuz we had to sit and talk forever, so I got home and had just enough time to get ready for work and go. Work was slow, but I still made good tips concidering, so that was alright. Nothing like last night when I almost cried we were so busy and I was so confused. I'd rather be slow then that. OK, so now I'm home and tired so maybe I will go to bed.

      Alright who ever is obsessed with killing whales...and jLo...your views do not need to be expressed on my blog. Thanks! But no thanks.  Moving right along... So I have started this new thing trying to be "healthy". Its some hard crap. I haven't had caffiene in the last 3 days and I think thats why I have a headache. I also am trying not to eat fried foods and also trying to exercise when I can. This prolly won't last very long, but I think I should at least give it a try. Kayla and I are gonna go jogging tonight at Josey Ranch so I guess I'm making progress. And yes Jayson, we will be JOGGING. I also am eating breakfast (meaning a banana) every morning. I heard that it makes your metabolism speed up faster, so yeah, I'll do that. Today I was bad though and I had a piece of cake after my class. I couldn't help it, it was sitting on the counter calling my name. O well, just one minor slip up right? Haha. My next goal is to start getting a decent amount of sleep....but there are a few people, one in particular, who really can help me out with this one by making me go to bed. This doesn't apply to Thursday through Saturday nights, just on the days that I have to wake up for school in the morning. So yeah, there goes my goals for the summer sorta. I also need to get a tan, so that people don't have to wear sunglasses to look at me. HAHAHA.  Hey you know what would be a good idea? If you called me this summer and were like, lets go do something! That would be just splended. Ok bye ya'll.

      Once again I had an open note test in government today! It was sweet. Last time we had notes and partners, but I didn't really need a partner anyway, and I think i did good on this one. Two down one to go, but I have a feeling that hes just gonna let us be on our own for the third one! AHH scary.  Anyway, today has been a productive day and its only 10! Class was only about 30 mins long cuz we just got to leave when we were finished with our test, so with the extra time Kayla and I decided to go walking we walked to Sonic for breakfast, then up to Josey Ranch and walked the track, then back to the house. It was a long walk. But it felt good I guess, besides it being humid.  So now I am tired. Oh well, maybe I will take a nap. ByE

      I couldn't think of a title. So today was a day of being tired and aggrivated. It started at church where I fell asleep a few times, went to a pointless Sunday school where all that was discussed was the Chapelle show. I agree that the show is funny, but there are just some things that are better discussed in a different place then sunday school. Oh well, I was too tired to say that I had a problem with it. Then we had some luncheon thing. Then I finally got to come home to take a 3 hour nap...ahh that was nice. The worst part was having to wake up at four for work. BOOO. Work was horrible. The A.C. was broken, people were rude, and I just didnt want to deal with it when I was already feeling crappy. I came home and the best part of my day was getting to watch 2 episodes of MXC, thats most extreme challenge. That show is hilarious. It made me laugh. But yeah, over all I give the day an F for its amount of fun-ness. Hopefully tomorrow will be better!

       WARNING: This post may be a little to long for some of ya'll with short attention spans....read at your own risk!   Summer is proving to be not all that great. First of all, all I do is work. I have no time to do anything else and now that we are open til 12 I can't even do anything after work. Stuff will get better when my parents come back from England on Monday. Then I won't have to work for my mom anymore and that will give me free time in the day. Then I can also start spending the night out again..they made some weird rule that I couldn't spend the night at people's houses while I was gone, I don't see the point, but ok. The only person's house I go to is Kayla's anyway...hehe. I decided today that I really need to call some of my friends that I haven't hung out with in a while and do something with them. It just seems like I have no time. On top of all that I was supposed to go talk to the vet that I was going to during the year for Clinicals cuz I was gonna volunteer there, but I just haven't got around to it cuz I am too busy right now. Oh well, so much for a relaxing summer. I have to work from now til Sunday every night, and three of those four nights I have to work until 12. That should be an adventure. Hopefully I will have some more free time next week if I get lucky. Call me if you wanna do something with me this summer, I really will try my best to get together with you, its not that I dont wanna, its just so freaking hard to plan things. GRR.  Today I had a S.T.A.R.T. skit that we went and did at this catholic school. It was pretty cool, we did it for kids from ages 12-14 about and they were gifted and talented kids so it really surprised me at the amount of knowledge they actually were able to show. It was a fun experience and I actually am really glad that I went and that I am in the group. I know its just one more thing to add to my schedule, but its fun and i think I would have regreted it if I had passed up the opportunity. Well for now thats all. Peace out... BOY SCOUT ! haha that cracks me up.

Ok..I know that gas prices are going up and all....but really, its getting a little out of hand:     That is all for this edition of christina's awesome pictures...so for now: PEACE OUT, BOY SCOUT!

      Haha...wow, my blog has started some controversy...but thats what you get for messing with me. Haha. I'm playing. But really ya'll, get a life. By the way, I love all my friends that stuck up for me....especially my big guy friends cuz they are intimidating. Hehe. But anyway, today all I did was work and go to class. It wasn't much fun. I never really have that much fun stuff to write about, but I like pictures. I should put some more on here, but it took me forever and a day just to put 2 of them on here. Hehe. I need one of me and my Kayla (shes my BEST FRIEND in the whole wide world....and no we arent lesbians, Jayson.) But yah, maybe I will work on that now, not like I have anything better to do. Buh bye for now. Keep up the POSITIVE comments, or just neutral comments at least.    P.S. To whoever wrote the whale thing, who ever said that whales were dumb? I think they are very smart...i mean think about it....Shamu is like awesome, and that whale in Finding Nemo was all cool and helpful and stuff. So stop dissin the whales.

      I don't know exactly why people are deciding to put mean comments on here to me. First of all, no one is forcing you to read any of my posts and if my "boring life" is just too horrible for you to bear reading about, then don't bother looking at my site. And then not only do you force yourself to read something you weren't even interested in, but you go on to post a complaint on the persons site (oh, and you aren't even man enough to own up to it...you do it annonymously). Please. Last time I checked my rambling is totally not against the rules, if thats what I wanna do then I will, so how bout you get off my back and find something better to do then to look at random blogs of people you don't even know. Yeah...have a great day.   P.S. OHH....i am SOOO sorry if this post is too long for your small brain to comprehend....i never ment to make anyone feel dumb. HAH. :)

      So I only had ONE post on here and already I am getting crap about it. Matt says I write too much....so I guess I have to tone it down so people don't get bored, I understand my life is a boring thing to read about. Ok, thats all for today, don't want you to injure your eyes from staring at this too long.

      Woah, I don't even know what a blog is. That sounds like some weird kind of bug or something. Sounds kinda dirty too. This site says that it has free image hosting, I think it might be lying, but my Xanga made me mad because I accidentally deleted all of the color changes I had made to make it look pretty. So maybe instead I will try this "blog" thing out and see how it goes. Its all cool baby, I'm open to options. Hehe.  Well, I think this thing is going to be boring and I bet about 5 people will read this in all, and only one of those will do it religiously (yes I am counting myself...and yes I am the one religious person). But ahh, I don't care. You know the only reason people make all this "online journal" sites is so that they can pretend that their summer is more interesting then it is but really they are bored out of their mind.  So back to the boring stuff... Today was alright. I went to church..It started at 9:15 today for our new summer schedule, and I didn't actually go to church, I watched the kids in the nursery, then I went to Sunday school. I didn't really do anything between church and work I don't think. Oh wait, I watched Dogma on comedy central. I'd never seen it before, and it was sorta weird but it was funny. I wanna see mall rats and clerks. My goal for the summer is to see all the jay and silent bob films cuz I think they are something that everyone should experience at least once in their lives. And ppl talk about them all the time, and I wanna be cool too! Hehe. Tonight at work it was alright, but there were 3 groups of ditzy teenagers that came and they annoyed me. They needed something every 5 seconds and they were rude and they made a lot of noise, and on top of all of that they didn't even tip!! Grr. People like that make me mad. I wanna wear a button that says "I make a whole $3.75 an hour doing what I do...so maybe you should be nice for a change and give me some extra money....or I'll slap you in the face", now I realize that this would be a rather large size pin, but I think the oversizedness of it would make it all the more noticeable. I also got my new schedule this week. I am working wed, thurs, fri, sat, and sun. 4 of those days are work at 6, meaning that I have to stay until 12 to close. You don't understand how bad that sucks. But I think i'mma get someone to work for me on wed. cuz I have a class I the morning and I don't wanna be tired. Of course I say that and I have class tomorrow morning and its 1am....silly tina. But anyway, on top of my Sonic work schedule I also have my work at Sid's to cover for my mom while shes in England. I work there on Tuesday, Wednsday, Saturday, and I don't remember what other days. But it is a lot. I'm so excited about tomorrow, after my class in the morning I have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do! How awesome is that! I'll prolly go actually hang out with friends, it seems like so long since I have done that. Ok I know I am boring ya'll. Call me if you wanna do something tomorrow! Woo Woo. Bye ya'll!

      I have been informed that I should update my blog more often by Grant....so this one goes out to him. He also says that the controversy in my blog is interesting and people like it. I dont like being angry tina tho, its not as fun as normal happy tina. Oh well. Today was band, and by that I mean lots and lots of band. From 7am-3:30pm to be exact. Then I got 2 1/2 hrs of rest before work. It was hard going back to work for the first time since before i went to church camp. I didnt wanna, and then my manager (who is long winded) started talking to me about gymnastics and didnt stop til about an hour later. It was super. So i realized just now that Mr. Nuke the Whales (and Jennifer Lopez) guy is gone. I kinda miss him. I shouldnt have said some of the things I said to him becuase now he is gone and i didnt even cherish the times we had together. What the heck am I talking about??!! that guy was friggin annoying as crap. Yeah, but anywho, tomorrow is the lockin that ive been waiting for all week....yay! Its gonna be such a blast. Well, i dont have anything more to say. So until next time, keep your pants on.

      "That sounds like you use your friend Kayla as a wingwoman a lot"...first of all, how can you say "a lot"? Even if this instance was one of those examples that would be a whole one time to your knowledge, man thats a lot. Plus, how is that using her. I invited her to come along, she said yes, she had a fun time. Ask her if you want. Maybe you just dont understand what a friend is, in which case I will cut you some slack for your stupid comment. Second, we are more then friends....so yeah, i guess that one wasnt really a bad thing and I dont understand why it would be taken that way. But yeah, i dont understand why people find it nescessary to put their little comments about how i run my life on here. first of all its my choice what i do and how i handle things, secondly, if you arent even man enough to post something and say it is from you then you have no right to be putting your opinions anywhere. I dont write this blog becuase I want people to give me feedback on how I run my life. Its for my friends to read if they want, and you sure as heck better not be my friend becuase thats not how friends talk to each other. If you are the one who posted that last comment do everyone a favor and get some real friends so you dont have to make yourself feel better by putting down others.

      So today is a boring day, and sucky as well. I missed band this morning cuz I didn't wake up to my alarm, then I woke up at about 10 took a shower, ate Wendy's then went to my sectional....surprisingly the directors didnt say a thing to me about not being at morning rehearsal, but theres always tomorrow to get griped at. So I guess that was the good in my day. The rest of the day was spent sleeping mostly cuz I havent felt good and I finally got up at 8pm and took some medicine and now I am sitting around....prolly gonna go watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail cuz I havent seen it in a long time and I wanna see the Lego part that Matt thinks is so wonderful.  Well yesterday was more exciting then today so I will tell you about that. I went to band in the morning, got home at 9:30am then I got to go to Stonebriar with Jason and his cousin. I brought my friend Kayla cuz i guess Jason didnt want Robert being the odd one out, not that he woulda been anyway, but yeah. We had such a fun time tho. I wish I lived closer to McKinney, that really would make me very happy. But we have a lockin this weekend with them so I will get to see Jason again...I cant wait, it gives me something to look forward to!  My parents come home on Thursday, or maybe just one of them does. Not that it really matters. I kinda like it better when they are home, cuz I dont have to do dishes or feed the dog or make dinner for myself. So thats good. Ok I'm gonna go watch a movie cuz I am bored and I feel bad and movies make me happy. Peace out boy (or girl) scout!

I thought I should give some shout outs to all my cool friends that I miss so much: My Regulars: Courtney-yay I always love seeing you, it sucks you had to leave early, but we will get together sometime since you live close! Kristin-same thing, always great to see you, you live farther, but we should still get together! Amanda- you are so funny...."christina...I'm scared of boys!" You crack me up! Ryan- haha I will never forget all of Amanda's impressions of you "Hi my name is Ryan and I like to run around without my shirt on and hit on girls older then me....and my name is Ryan" My Small Group (G-3: Hard Hat Heros!): Sonja- YOU'RE GORGEOUS!!! I love you so much and we need to hang out in C-town. Jason- You are such an awesome person and so hilarious!! I know we will keep in touch.. Justin- You too can make me laugh so hard and you are just so much fun to be around. Bob- I'm so glad I met you this year, you are such a cool guy and you just have a lot going for you. Have a blast at Baylor and we should hang out sometime.  Kent- You are so cute! The girls are gonna love you Katie- You are adorable and so much fun, but I get to see you next year...yay! Jenne- You were a great exec and always kept us on topic! "jimminy crickets!" Jeff- You are so wonderful and such an inspiration to everyone Other Random Ppl: Woody- "It's Woody, not Woody"....Haha you are so funny and even though we didnt meet til like the last few days I know you are an awesome person and I cant wait to see you again.  Jenifer- We met cuz my little brother likes you, but you still are really cool and such an awesome girl! I hope McKinney does more stuff with my church it will be awesome! Hannah- You are so cute.   Ok its late and I cant really remember everyone so I'm so sorry if I forgot you, but just be like "hey, you didnt mention me"...and I will totally mention you!

      So I just got back from church camp right....and it was Jesus-licious....for real, it was so much fun. I met some new people and they were awesome and it was so hard to have to leave. I'd like to take time to give a shout out to my small group....the hard hat heros (triple H) for real ya'll were awesome....and you better keep in touch cuz I really wanna hear from yall. I also got to see my Courtney, Kristin, and Amanda again and I always love those times. To think, next year is our last and it went by so fast. This last week was very moving for me and I feel like I grew so much closer to God and got a lot of things that I was confused about in my life worked out. I come home with an open mind and a happy heart so I hope that stays around.  But movin' right along....band starts Monday, as well as me having to go back to my economics classes and make up the test I missed last week. I really dont feel like doing all my normal stuff such as working and it makes it even worse that I have to also wake up early to go stand in a parking lot for hours....but thats what I get for trying to be involved in school....darn overachievement. Yeah, thats all I have to say. Church kids call me if you wanna do something... I love you all and miss you so much!!!

      Yay...One person is reading my blog! Well guess what whoever you are, I will write just for you! You should feel special becuase I am taking this time out of my day to write entries for you. Haha, I'm playing, I'm sure you read it just out of pity for me, but that works too I suppose. Anyway, today I woke up at about 11am and took back my two Blockbuster videos, one of which I realized was a 2-day rental, which I rented 4 days ago. It's on my brothers card, but he knows I used it so I guess I will have to be paying for that. Grr, what is up with that, you already pay too freaking much to get the rental and then for every day it is late you have to pay like the same price you would if you had rented it again. It wasn't even that good of a movie. Ohh, last night I saw The Anchorman, that was a great movie. Actually it was really dumb, but SOOOO hilarious. "Where did you get your suits at? The Toilet Store?" Haha, for real, I haven't laughed that hard in quite a while, so that was fun. Well tonight I have to work at 4...which is kind of exciting becuase for once I don't have to close! Sweet! Maybe I can find something to actually do after work instead of just coming home, but more likely I will just be coming home. Fun stuff. Alright well I am gonna go and do something fun before I have to go to work....You should do the same, but if you dont have to go to work then continue doing something fun until you can't do anything fun anymore, that's my advice. Yea, I'll shut up now. Speaking of that, people say I talk to much, if you think I talk to much you should leave me a little message on here about it sort of a "constructive criticism" kind of thing....or not, whatever. Ok, bye!

      So I don't think anyone reads this anymore....haha, I'm writing to myself....sweet.  But anyway, I started my next Brookhaven class today...Economics and I am very confused! Like this guy with a real thick accent was trying to explain to us what the new class times were gonna be, and I got that I have to go 3 times a week, but I'm not sure much else...something about getting signitures for extra credit, and I dont know, its all very confusing to me. Oh well, what do ya do? Ya, so today was boring besides that...I'll post more interesting stuff when it happens! Bye.

      So today is the 4th of July...and guess how i get to spend it?!? WORKING! Thats right..while everyone else is eating bbq and watching pretty fireworks I will be at Sonic catering to the activity goers needs....I just can't wait. Hopefully we will stay busy tonight and I will make a decent amount of money, that would make everything a little better. I did go watch Kaboom Town last night, well I went to the Polk parking lot and you could see them from there. I don't know, there is just something I love about fireworks, they get me in a good mood and make me all sentimental and crap, whatever. And today I did get to go swimming, and I tried to get a better tan, but I have a feeling there is just something medically wrong with me where it is impossible for me to get any color to my skin. Crazy I know. But yah, thats my excitement for the day. This next week is gonna suck for many reasons....one being I start summer school (2nd semester) on Wednesday which I am not looking forward to....and then also the next two weeks are looking pretty boring and lonely for me :(. Oh well, I will live. Well I am gonna go now, Happy fourth of July and hope yours is better then mine!

      So yesterday I went to get my senior pictures done right, well the funniest thing happened, although it wasnt funny at all! Alright so the lady was taking my picture and what not and then she stopped and looked at me and shes like "Do you know who you look like?....THE OLSEN TWINS!" Oh gosh, I dont know what is up with that, but whatever. Besides that, the picture taking was fun and I really hope that they turn out good. If not I might cry....or just tear them all up! But yea, I just thought that was a funny story, and the only one I have to tell right now, so yeah there you go. Oh also, today I went to get my car inspected, or I thought I needed to, but it turns out that the tags are different then the inspection...oops. They laughed at me, but yeah, I'm ditzy, so what is expected. THE END.

      Do you know the muffin man that lives on Drury Ln? Yes, i know the muffin man who lives on Drury Ln.... When i picture the muffin man i see.... ....There is this little fat guy thats a cartoon walking down a really dark and gloomy street pushing a little cart full of muffins. He has a white mustache, rosy red cheeks, and hes bald, but just on the top, he has hair around the outside. He also has a dog, its a cartoon character too. Its brown with a little white tail and its on a leash tied to the cart. All the houses on the street are black and grey except for the muffin mans house which is just a big muffin....and as the muffin man walks down the street everything he passes turns bright and cheery and his muffins bring joy to the world. A little kid emerges from one of the houses and waves down the muffin man. He says "Muffin man, i want a blueberry muffin!" and the muffin man makes a sad face and says "sorry..all out of blueberry" so the kid is like "ok, make it banana nut" the muffin man says "that will be one dollar", so he gets his muffin and takes it home but then his little brother steals it and eats it and so he comes out and runs after the muffin man and the muffin man is like "sorry dude, you gotta get another dollar" but the kid doesnt have a dollar so he goes and knocks on his friends door and is like "can i borrow a dollar to get another muffin cuz my lil bro ate mine and that really sucks" and so the friend is nice and gives him a dollar but then he decides that he wants a muffin as well, so he follows along to the muffin man and the kid gets another banana nut muffin and the neighbor wants blueberry but the muffin man says hes out so he gets a poppy seed muffin. So the kids go back in the house and eat their muffins and live happily ever after....but thats not the end cuz thats the kids that live happily ever after, not the muffin man, and the muffin man is what the story is about, not the kids you silly geese...anywho....so the muffin man keeps walking along the road but then all the sudden his dog gets loose and runs down the street and so the muffin man leaves his cart and chases the dog. Meanwhile, a robber emerges from the bushes and steals the last double chocolate chip muffin out of the cart....the muffin man notices from a distance and starts chasing the robber. he calls the police on his handy cell phone and they come and pick up the robber in one of those big trucks that have the jail cell in the back equipped with the bars and a black and white striped suit for the robber to put on before he gets in.   Michael's Optional Ending: ...While the Muffin Man returns home to tell his wife the events of the day, his greatest rival, the Cupcake Casanova, is at his house, unbeknownst to him, bumping oven mitts with his wife. Just as the Muffin man reaches his street he sees the Cupcake Casanova pulling out of his driveway. Suspecting foul play, he oreders his dog to attack the cupcake casanova, since hes always has hot cupcakes cooling in his car and leaves his windows down. The Muffin man's dog races frantically toward the Cupcake casanova's car, but tragically gets backed over, and becomes flat as a pancake in a greased up griddle with a cow and a walrus siting on top of it. The muffin man screams at the Cupcake casanova to stop, but he continues his car's backward decent, and strikes the dog again with his front tires. Afterwards he screeches off, leaving the muffin man in despair over the death of his dog.  To easte the pain, the Muffin man steps into the house to comsume a pot brownie he secretly baked for such an occassion. How absurd-a muffin man -making a browning. Unfortunatly his wife was not given enough time to compose herself after her steamy encounter, so he finds her in the kitchen with her apron on backwards. He knows something is afoot, because she only wears it backwards when going to the restroom, because for some reason she has a strange compulsion to sit on the toilet backwards. Anyway, he looks at her with great disgust, but rather than broach the subject he decides to let it slide. Without his dog, or the trust of his sweet wife, he feels life is no longer worth living. The Muffin man decides to end his miserable life, and where there was once happiness and vibrant color wherever he went, he only saw darkness and muffins with the top bitten off (his worst nightmare is an unfinished muffin, like when some girl is on a diet and gets a huge muffin but only picks off the top of it and it looks as though a seagull has had its way with it. The Horror!!!) With great hesitation, he breaks the glass housing his emergency cyanide muffin and consumes the entire thing in one bite. His wife looks on with shock, but smiles to herself because she still has time to do the Doughnut Delivery Boy before the police arrive.   THE END.

      So today was a long and tiring day, a lot of crappy stuff happened, nothing really good at all, and then when i got all the crappy stuff over and done with now i am left in a band mood. hopefully it will go away before tomorrow. first of all we had band today. we usually have it from 7-11:30, then break for lunch then have it from 1-4. In the morning section we usually only stay outside for at most 3-3.5 hours...today it was the full 4 1/2 hours. there are pros and cons to this...now that i look back on it i am glad we did it, we learned 12 sets of our show and that was good. we are so far ahead of where we normally are at this time of the year and thats encouraging i suppose, but it was so freaking hot and yes i'm a whiner but it was just horrible. sometimes i feel like i want to quit band, but i hate being a quitter so i don't. i guess its fun sometimes. i like concert season and football games are fun..i dunno i guess i'm just in a bad mood today. after band i found out that i can just not worry about my economics class that i am gonna fail and just not turn in the grade report to the school. thats a good thing becuase i dont want a failing grade on my gpa my senior year, no thanks. but now i dont know if i can get a transcript with only my government grade on it, but i will figure that out later. i have schedule pickup tomorrow and i already know i have to get a schedule change... but anyway thats boring, i'm gonna tell you a funny story about how i fell at work. so i work at sonic if you didnt know that and i was carrying a tray full of food during a kinda busy time. i had to go to a car and give them ranch before i went to deliver the food so i did that, but when i was stepping back up on the curb i didnt do a very good job and i tripped on the curb and fell on my face and spilled a drink all in the food. on top of that, not only was i embarrassed in front of a whole bunch of ppl i didnt know, my sisters bf was there to see it and also some guys i know and they laughed, it was sad. ive gotten pretty used to falling by now tho so it wasnt all that bad, but it did suck. i didnt hurt myself tho, that was the good part. but then the story gets worse when i took the food back inside to get remade cuz it was all wet. the drink was still spilling so it spilled all over the floor inside and then another girl went to take out her order and fell on my drink spill and spilled all her food. it was like it was straight out of a movie. good times i tell ya. well thats all i have...buh bye.

      So last night was such a blast. We went to the Door in Deep Ellum, or however you spell that place, and watched a few bands. They were pretty alright and we went by the stage and they were flinging their sweat on us, it was such a blast. Then after we got to go and chill with them in their little lounge thing and talk to them. One of the guys was hott and Jennifer and Jordan were obsessed with him then they got mad when i sat next to him on the couch, it was hilarious. Then we went back to the church and played some games and stuff and that was fun too, then we watched the Gooneys, but i didnt watch much of it and the parts i watched didnt seem all that funny so i dont know what the hype about that movie is all about. I got to hang with my Jason and it was so great. But anyway, yea we stayed up all night then i came home at about 7:30 and slept and planned on waking up for church, but then my parents woke me up as they were leaving so i just went to sleep til 2, and now i'm sitting around til work. Yeah thats my fun story....i'm gonna go now! buh bye
