						   My back is killing me but it's off to work I go.  I bowled fair last night last game was a 203 which saved my average.  kalee keeps wanting to hang with the convicted felons next door I may have to kill her.  isn't it funny how bowling switched into kalee.  she is moving back ot her mother and will probably give me a couple of grand kids by next year.  what a joyous thought.

						    The bar in the pool   urlLink     urlLink     This pool alone makes me want to go back to the Bahamas me and the wife had an excellent time there but now that I am home not sure I need to go back. Things are expensive there. They charge $16.00 for a six pack of Budweiser. And that's pure insanity. I live in Florida so the Bahamas is relatively close and maybe when I am rich I can spend weekends there. My son has been caught sniffing gas over the weekend what a dumbass he is 13 and felt the need to try it. I should have kicked his little ass and made a scene but I can't control his every move and he needs to be smarter than that.

						   Sometime I think I am but that never lasts long then sometime I think my kids are and most of the time they think they are but they forget they are not the center of the universe. I guess what is important is how you behave in the eyes of the people you love. If you lie to your kids they can see it. If you always try to be fair they will eventually see that too. Self respect is crucial to developing as a young adult but how do you get a fourteen year old to understand that with so few years of life experience to go on. I have asked my kids what they want to be when they grow up and they give me answers that are not very well thought out. I myself still don't know what I Want to be when I grow up.  what is it about random thoughts that pop into your head that makes me so restless.  well mowing sucked yesterday because I have a nerve pinched in my lower back and it made every step painful  Later

						   I am just sitting here listening to jim croce and feeling alittle nostalgic.  I was thinking back to when I found jim it was one of my older brothers 8 track tapes and I was about 10 go figure.  life sure was differen't then.  my biggest crisis was if my bike had a flat.  the good old days are gone forever.  do you ever get tired of people saying "If I knew then what I know know"? I sure do.  well I am tired of typing so I am giong.
