      The Fire's bright on a cool winter night  Interned by the Summer air  &nbsp;  Flowing wind  Caresses my chin  A biting churning wind  &nbsp;  I flow along  on Heaven's song  to Eternal waves of Grace  &nbsp;  These waters flow -  wherever they go -  they carry me along.  &nbsp;  ~ 2 f

      So, for those of you who know me intimately enough to show up here, or even for those of you who don't know me intimately at all, which, is a very good thing considering, I make attempts at writing stories, so, yeah... I figured I would host them all and let you peoples look at all my works in progress  Working Title:  urlLink " Eternity "  Part one of the Eisenhower High Series:  urlLink " Kyrin "  Working Title:  urlLink " Puppet Strings "  Working Title:  urlLink " Raven and Rayne "   All of these are works in progress, most of them, prolly all of them will never be finished, all my poetry from my other site is still available for those who wish to have any of it.  New poems will be posted here.  Til Next Blue Moon, ~ |2 | f

      So yeah, since apparently I can't keep up w/ my other website and things such as that, not to mention there's not hardly enough webspace there for all my little creations I'm going to attempt to try this out.  For those of you who know me, Hi, this is going to be another attempt to try to post my work of whatever I'm doing at the moment and things like that. So yeah, for now, that's all I got. Try to mess around some more again later.  ~|2 | f

      Sprawled, Spinning down a Swirling vortex Ended by a darkened glass room Kept from Sun and day.  A room of mirrors each one a reflection of an imperfect diamond Myself  I cannot see past this mirror
