      Things upset me very easily, but only little things. Somebody could die, and I could care less, but if my friend isn't online, I'm crying in three seconds.  Yea verily, I have been reading Lauren's blog again and I need to feel better. Thus, the list was born.  Things that don't hurt me:  1) Beadwork. When I'm doing beadwork, NOTHING upsets me. Tangled thread, dropped beads, nothing. It's all part of it. I love making things that people will buy and wear or not wear, it doesn't matter. When I do a project, I don't think about time, I don't think about anything I don't want to. Nothing can upset me when I'm following a pattern and pulling the needle around. I love picking out colors and spending HOURS and HOURS choosing beads and colors and thread. It's great, I have tons of beads, but I never seem to have exactly what I need. I wish I could find better 11s.  2) A Knight's Tale. This movie cracks me up, I know all the words, literally. Anachronism rocks it. And Heath Ledger is hot.  3) Maps. I love the maps on my walls, they represent different things to me, all important. My Texas map, where I grew up and started to realize I was a person. The Ohio map from the thirties, which reminds me of the past...people used it, depended on it, and now I have it on my wall. How cool is that. My US map, which is only the east coast, because the west is on the other side. I've SEEN the west coast, I want to see the other half. My world map that my grandfather gave me reminds me of where I want to go and what I want to be. It's...I don't know. They make me happy.  I'll think of more later, I know there are more, but those are the first three that came to mind.  Jesse's detouring from Okla, possibly, so we might have lunch sometime next week. I'm hoping Thursday. Because if it's not, we're totally having grilled cheese at my house. I only have an hour for lunch from band camp, and that's not enough time to get anything more than fast food from The City. I hope it works out. I hate fuzzy plans.  I got another email from Lauren today. I LOVE getting emails from her, we talk very rarely, compared to me and my other friends.  I feel like Tara's abandoning me for everything, but she assures me it's normal and we'll still talk when she's in college. I trust her. I trust her with this. She's not just friends with me because she was bored.  You know what's delicious? Grilled cheese sandwiches with egg in them. YUM. Seriously...soooo good. I actually bought and consumed Ramen today. I hate Ramen. Ew. Also, it's incredibly salty.  I quit my job, and I went to turn in my uniform, but they offered me the COOLEST thing, I'm not being scheduled, I can just call and come in whenever the hell I feel like it. I'm totally working Sundays after school starts, and weeknights only when I want to. That's like 70 dollars every two weeks, after taxes. That's not too bad...spending money. 140 dollars a month. It's STILL more than I've ever gotten in my life, ever, excluding birthdays.  I have to call Lauren before August 18.

      So here's the story.  I'm 16. I'm 16 and stupid. I'm 16, stupid, and in Arkansas.  I have numerous blogs, only one that I ever post in. I gave most of them up a long time ago. They were for other people's benefit anyway.  I have no friends. None. OK, well, I have three, but they're online. The rest of the people I know are acquaintances. And none of them know the entire story. Lauren, Tara, and Dae. Everyone else either dislikes me or doesn't care.  More on the person I'm most likely to talk to longest. Lauren. We were best friends in fourth and fifth grade, and it was weird. We caught up earlier this summer when I sought refuge on an old screen name. And I'm sure somebody will read this, probably her, but she pisses me off. I love her, she's SO AWESOME, but she fucking pisses me off with her perfect life. I know she'll beg to differ, about all her problems, but that's what MAKES life perfect is it's imperfections. Honestly. She has this cool hobby that lets her socialize, she has FRIENDS. She has people who care about her. And she's so fucking nice. And that's why there's a problem, because I don't dislike her, not at all.  This summer, I've been thinking about things. The last few days. Tara's boyfriend, Jesse, gave me a copy of the PD and oh my god. Wow. It's making me think. That's hard to do. It's easier to shut my mind off.  We had a debate the other day, about god. I don't see anything wrong with having a god as long as I realize that it's just a creation of my mind. As long as I can doublethink, I'm OK with myself. My major flaw in our debate was that I was equating meaning with god. I tend to do that because it's been predisposed on me by society.  I work for a living, and I hate it when I'm not there. When I'm working, I LOVE my job. It's weird, nobody should, but I do. I love the people, I love mopping, I love pushing buttons on the register. Another case of doublethink.  Band camp starts tomorrow. I really should be in bed, but I can't sleep unless I talk to Dae, and I'm hoping Lauren will be online. Again with the thing, I want to talk to her all the time, but she can't afford to spend all her time online, which I totally get. But still...I hate being disposable. And I am.  I keep a journal, I've written about a thousand pages in a year, which really isn't that much, but it's getting obsessive lately. And I hate it, because I can't write fast enough, so it's not worth writing down my thoughts, because I think too fast to get them out onto the paper. That's why I like typing. It's better than last year, right after I read The DaVinci Code. I wrote backwards on EVERYTHING for like three months. I learned that it doesn't work as well if you're right-handed, so I guess something good came out of that: I can now write left-handed.  I made Dae a bracelet today. I don't want to give it to her. It's so beautiful, it's black RAW with purple irridescent beads that pop up because they're JUST too big for the holes. SO beautiful. But I'll give it to her because it's beautiful. She deserves it. She doesn't think highly enough of herself.  That's another thing that upsets me. I have these wonderful people around me, and they all refuse to recognize that they're SO FUCKING AMAZING. It hurts. That's the ultimate egotism: when you're so wonderful that you can't even fathom how wonderful you are.  What makes it a little better is that Eli feels the same way about me. I didn't know she hated me until about a week ago, but it's a huge ego rush. Honestly, I love it. And that makes me a horrible person. That bothered me this summer, that nobody was jealous of me. And now I have my wish.  I need some new music to listen to. I should write my own songs, but like I've said numerous times, poetry pisses me off because I can't write it. Crafty stuff does too. Perfect or bust, you know?  I was a funny-looking kid.

      Woo.  I just got home, that was crazy. We got out of band thirty minutes early yesterday and had free ice cream, then I went over to Ashley's and we had sandwiches. Nasty, nasty sandwiches. White bread, ham and cheese loaf, and mustard. I'm very picky when it comes to my sandwiches.  Then we went over to the house where the party was. There was another Ashley, who kept calling me "Jacquelyn". On purpose. She was the one who threw a cup of water on Jessica and busted her lip. Ashley also iced Jessica and Ashley's underwear.  Jessica, Ashley, Jenny, and I did circle drills on the porch. We marched and walked in step the whole time. We're band nerds. We offered to sleep in the camper, and Carmen Bimrose joined us when she got out of the shower. I froze to death, I have poor circulation in my feet. When I take off my glasses, I go into sleep mode even if I'm not tired, because I can't see. So I didn't sleep, but everyone THOUGHT I was. I didn't have the energy to correct them when they told each other to be quiet because I was sleeping. I shared a bed with Jenny but she wound up in the other bed, because they were talking and I was asleep. Jessie and Emily joined us around three in the morning. We stayed up literally all night. We fell silent about thirty minutes before we were awoken. The mother's house we were staying at woke us up thirty minutes late. 13 girls in one bathroom in twenty minutes.  The guy who drove the van pissed me off. He's one of those guys who likes to think he's all fun and openminded. He made stupid rules. He wouldn't let us sleep in the van. And he spoke to all the girls like we're stupid of something. "Jasmine. Jasmine. Yes, you. Get the soda, the green lemon-lime soda out of the red cooler. The red cooler in the van. Yes, Jasmine. You." And when we stopped at gas stations, he ORDERED us to "go tee-tee".  Jessica, Ashley and I spent about two hours hoeing and raking a HUGE plot of land perfectly flat. They used the dirt from our perfect area to put in another area, so there were huge tire tracks across it. Yeah, we tried so hard not to make any hoe jokes, because you know we're more mature than that, but somehow they just slipped out. The heads of the hoes kept coming off, and I kept telling Jenny not to beat her hoe up, but to treat it gently. And there weren't enough hoes to go around, so we had to trade hoes. Jenny didn't want to give up her hoe.  After lunch, Jessica and I were so tired. We went "exploring" in the house, and we hid in a bathroom for about thirty minutes, then we found a closet and got Jenny and came back. The house was built in the 1800's and burned down, then was built again, and burned down again right before it opened. It was a pregnant teen shelter. One of those "I'm going to stay with my sick aunt" places. Now it's a girls' drug and alcohal abuse shelter.  Jenny and I have so much fun together, she's my pillow sometimes, when we aren't forced to move. We both love Zoolander, and we were quoting it all day. "What is this? A center for ANTS?! It has to be at least...THREE TIMES bigger than this!" "There's more to life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking." And she does a great Stuart from MadTV. "Say that to the microphone."  Update on the sunburn: My face is still peeling, but it's red underneath, so I burned like, all my skin. It'll be a couple weeks, probably months, before I'm back to normal. I hate being red, I don't look right. I look beautiful with like, no color on my skin. It looks right on me.  My shoulders, which were really, REALLY hot on Thursday and Friday, have developed more since then. Wearing ANYTHING on them hurts like a bitch. Seriously, I think I'm going to die. In the two hours I've been home, they've started to blister. Before I took my t-shirt off, they were purple. Dark purple. And you can see broken blood vessels under the skin. My mom doesn't think it's serious. Oh, and my boobs are blistering. You have NO IDEA how uncomfortable this is.  On the way home, I heard the STUPIDEST crap. Christian talk radio is seriously misinformed, they don't make any valid arguements. They're like, "We need to stop gay marriages because God said so, and the majority obviously agrees with God." Oh, and they talked about Lauren's city. Paradise Valley. Something about a new elementary school offering tiles and somebody wanted to write "God Bless Someone" on a tile and the school wouldn't let them. The arguement against it is that since they're allowing other cultures to express things through their interpretations, they should be allowed to use the word God. Well then, I want to get a tile that says, "I eat children." Because that's how I see the world.  I'm not thinking straight. I'm tired, exhausted, dehydrated, and I have many, many more ailments. But I'm in go-mode. Early Week has got me used to working on autopilot, which is good practice for school. I've learned that I can be a fully functional human being on fifteen minutes of sleep in over 48 hours.  Oh, yeah, this morning she knocks on the camper to get us up, and I like, jump out of bed, grab my stuff, get in the house, go into this room where there are people sleeping, strip down and change clothes, go into the living room and stretch, eat breakfast...I did all this before anyone else woke up. That's how I am in the morning. I force myself to get up and go, but if I stop for any reason, that's it. I'm not getting up. I don't allow myself to think about not doing something. When I was eating, I stood and practiced pointing my toes. Ha, everyone's like, "Jasmine's such a morning person. Look at her go." The first words out of my mouth: "It is neither good nor morning, so I don't want to hear either of those words until at LEAST noon."  I WAS planning on working tomorrow, I got a call to go in today when I was gone, but I couldn't. That makes me feel unreliable. I am, but still. Anyway, I can't put anything on my shoulders, that includes work uniforms, therefore, I'm not working until next weekend. I need the money, so badly, but there's nothing I can do about that. Working isn't happening. And I called my dad and asked for 25-40 dollars to help pay for my contacts. I CAN pay for them all, but whatever he can give is more towards clothes I need. I have like, three shirts I would consider wearing, the rest have basically become workout clothes or sleep clothes. And I know I sound picky, but I'm really not being that way. And after Thursday, it's not like I can't not have contacts. I've already killed my glasses, my depth perception is WAY off from hitting myself like five times, and the worse my glasses get, the more likely I am to hit myself.  Oh, and one last comment: Lauren, you would be so proud. We played DDR, the Playstation version, and I kicked everyone's ass. My first time ever touching it. Honestly, those hours playing Flash Flash Revolution helped my timing or something. Guard helps, too. I mean, I'm sure anyone else could kill me at it, but I'm still pretty proud of myself.

      I won't be back until late Saturday, so you won't hear from me until Sunday, most likely, and even then, I'm going to try to put in some hours at teh MacDo.  I packed for the mission trip, I have NO IDEA what to bring, so I brought everything. I'm not Miss Most Prepared 2002-2003 for nothing. I did ALL my laundry. That's something that's been plaguing me all summer. Because I only wash what I need, I ALWAYS had clothes that need to be washed.  My pole is like my penis. I mean, if I had one. I'm insecure without it. I compare poles with the other girls to see who's is best weighted and nicest. We're happy because we're one of two schools with six-foot poles. I like it because it makes me part of a group. Yeah. I play with a six-foot phallus. This Intelligent Thought of the Day has been brought to you by the Jasmine is a Perv Foundation.  In other news, Lauren linked both my website and my blog in her blog. Ha, it's cool because I don't know any of her friends, so I don't have a problem with them caring about my life. Ha, Lauren's the only person I've told about my blog anyway.  My mom's home, and here I was all afraid I'd be late for practice!

      Yea verily, I shall make a list, and the list shall be discussed in order and the list shall compose of five parts. No more, no less. Five shall be the number thou shall read, and the number of reading shall be five. Six thou shall not read, nor shalt thou read four, excepting that thou then proceed to five. Six is right out. Once the number five, being the fifth number, be reached, thou shalt clickest thy Holy Button of Commenting with thy mouse, and typist thou a comment.  That was lame.  The List:  1) Ashley stayed over last night. I haven't had anybody over at my house since Phoebe in eighth grade. I just don't do it. We had fun, but I kept excluding her to check my email...nobody came to get us today, so we called Treola and her mom came for us. We squished in the truck, it wasn't terrible. But since four people needed a shower this morning, I only had time for a quick rinse. And I went with her to church last night. I've decided that a lot of Christianity is Pagan. Or the other way around, but we stand in circles to pray and we sing and stuff. Same with band, but I'll discuss that later. Anyway, when we were supposed to be silently praying with our pray partners, I pretended I was a tree and had roots and the prayers we were sending were the leaves, growing with good energy then falling and flying into the wind to the person who needed them. I'm a little heathenchild. But a bunch of people from band go. Anyway...there's another part to this story that I shall discuss later.  2) Guard camp is le suck. I only had to march for two and a half hours because of orientation, but I'm still tired. It's getting fun, though. My tan lines are evening out because of the car wash, but now I have bikini lines AND a neckline. Which means I have to find somewhere for topless sunbathing within the next week. I know tanning is bad, but if I'm going to be involuntarily dark, it's going to look right. I refuse to throw out EVERY SINGLE shirt I wear because of tanlines.  Anyway, band is very Paganish (I know I'm throwing the word around incorrectly. Shut up). I mean, think about it. We stand in circles and play music and march, which is basically dancing, and we chant. We're raising energy. We have a circle ritual that we do EVERY TIME we do a circle drill. Band is also like a cult...you don't let anybody leave without a grudge, and people are always recruiting, and yeah.  3) The Guard had a car wash today. In front of the West Fork branch of the Bank of Fayetteville. We didn't think we'd get any customers because we were having it IN West Fork, but we made WAY over 200 dollars. We can buy tops for everyone, and get half a pole apiece, and the school pays for the rest. All WE have to pay for is our pants and rifles. And we're having another car wash after school starts, we're putting signs up around the school. That's how I got my bikini line, I wore a bikini top and short shorts. Which brings me to a tangent.  Joseph Keck was my cynic buddy in English. He was the first person to accept me here and we would sit around and make fun of everybody for being stupid. When we read Julius Caesar in class, we always got the main roles and made fun of everyone for reading monotonously...Joseph got accepted into the Maths and Sciences School in Siloam, so we never get to talk. I HAVE his email, but I forgot it. Some old game with a V that's a double entendre...I'll have to google it, I guess. Anyway, I MISS Joseph. I'm pretty sure he thought I was stupid and spastic towards the end of the year, when I went psycho for a couple weeks, but I still want to talk to him. Anyway. I was standing in the parking lot of the bank dripping wet in my bikini, spinning my flag. And he drives up. To get his car washed. I didn't say anything to him, I didn't get contact information, I feel SO STUPID. I'm honestly a huge idiot. His dad is running for state rep, so Joseph gave us little propaganda cards to hand out to customers. The only thing I said to him was "Nice propaganda, Joseph." :-( I'm still kinda upset.  My sunburn hurts like a bitch.  Missy, Peggy, and Amanda Grace went for lunch at the mall. They come back two hours later. TWO HOURS. There were only four people washing cars for about an hour. And at LEAST one person had to hold the sign the whole time. Oh, and when we were leaving, Peggy and Missy volunteered to stay behind and clean up the parking lot themselves. They should have gotten there MAYBE fifteen minutes late, and even that is giving them the benefit of the doubt. Instead, they skip practice.  Maybe Joseph will come to a football game.  4) There's a mission trip Saturday with Ashley's church to help a children's shelter, dishes, yardwork, painting, stuff like that. I wouldn't go if they were spreading godly propaganda, but I'm fine going because this is great charity work. A bunch of girls from band go to church as well, some people I really enjoy. I'm not going to be a churchie, I'm a heathen and as such, I need time to worship my computer. If I started church, I'd be forced to work Saturdays and Thursdays, and I already don't have enough time off.  Anyway, here's my schedule for the next few days:  Tomorrow: Laundry Nail polish Pack Practice Guard at threeish? Home with Ashley Mission sleepover  Saturday: Up around 4 Leave at 5:30 Little Rock to help Home around nine thirty  Sunday: Work! (I have no choice, I NEED the money.)  5) I got out of an hour and a half of marching practice and sectionals because there was junior orientation. You couldn't get your schedule or anything without your parents there. I didn't know that. They never said anything. I call my mom, she refuses to come until she's eaten dinner. She shows up, barely late, I get my schedule which is exactly the same as it was when I planned it in May. I see Joe Doke, Monica's brother. They're in the same grade...I have a serious agenda relating to the secret I may or may not have mentioned. The secret I want to keep for a bit. Hm.  Anyway, I saw a bunch of people I don't really like, Treola and I are the juniors in Guard, and we were sitting one table apart, and we kept looking at each other when he mentioned the dress code because Treola ALMOST showed up in a halter top. It was all she had, but Stephanie loaned her a t-shirt.  I love being in Guard, because now it doesn't matter what happens, who doesn't like me, I have people who are forced to be around me, and that makes me feel welcomed, superficially at least. But after this week, I think the Guard is actually FRIENDS. I like these people, and I'll hopefully get to know them better. I want to. It's going to be great catty fun. Apparently Stephanie told Treola that Amanda's fat...Amanda is NOT fat, Amanda's GORGEOUS. And really, really sweet.  Yeah, the principal is delusional. He's proud because 44 percent of the juniors last year are proficient at reading. He's like, deliriously proud. And that's weird. Why? Because the numbers in TEXAS were like 83 percent last year, and I was in a fairly low school...  I'll pick this up tomorrow, because I promised five and yea verily I have finished.

      I carry a six-foot-long lightning rod, as my mother so graciously pointed out. We are storming all day, and while normally this would be cause for excitement at a day spent staring out the window (seriously), today, I would rather go to work than march. On the off chance that the sun does come out, it's already rained enough to make it hell with the bugs and mud and humidity. Mr. Taweel doesn't believe in coming in for a little rain, either, so unless there's a tornado or lightening strikes a Guard girl, we'll probably be outside.  I'll bet if it's lightning, we'll put down our poles and practice marching. Joy. And if we go inside, we can't practice in the band room. Mr. Gay replaced all the ceiling tiles we knocked holes in, damnit. I was proud. I had like three holes right in a little line! I knocked a piece of insulation out! You can't just erase my legacy! Anyway, since I'm pretty sure basketball camp is in the gym, that relegates us to the library, and last time we were there, Amanda broke a light. She totally killed it.  Ha, I know I was right, though, when I put an extra set of clothes in the Guard room, because now I don't have to be soaking wet, at least through lunch.  All my friends are starting school now, and it's depressing. It's a reminder that soon it's my turn. At least I've discovered the big secret: in order to have friends, you either have to be in band or go to church. Good thing: there are people in band I like talking to and stuff. Sad thing: there are people in band I want to smack on a daily basis. I always hate myself the day after I'm forced into a social situation. I do stupid, stupid things around people. I'm going to cut myself off...I don't want to start.  No emails. Again. I wrote Lauren yesterday, but she never replies until at least three days have passed, but the lack of reply from Dae is astonishing. Because I wrote her two days ago, she's had two chances to read and reply but she hasn't. Maybe she's been busy? I hope that's the case.  I think I'm doomed to be one of those people who's never happy. I only hope it's just with myself and not with other people. Which so far, is entirely correct. There are exactly two other people that I could never be (seriously) mad at, and when I'm around other people, I'm completely nonthreatening.  I need to start wearing more black. Or something. Because what happens is I get around people, go completely stupid and ditzy, I live very superficially, and I save all my emotions to write down...so I don't actually show any personality. Wow. I never thought of it like that, but that's exactly what I'm doing, I'm living vicariously through myself. Because of my obsessive need and want to remember what's happening in my life ten years down the road, I've stopped myself, effectively, from living.  My journal is way different from my blog anyway, here, I voice more insecurities and I tell more things, in my journal, I write exactly what happened and how I felt about it, nothing more. Because a journal is a physical object and can be read through by anybody, with a blog, only selective people even know it exsists, and I can get rid of it easily, as opposed to cutting it into pieces, burning it, and flushing the ashes.  So I should stop bringing it to school, focus less on writing it down and more on actually living it...but I still want to remember. I know SOME people hate high school, but I find it generally tolerable. I don't slack, I offer more than I should, I take on extra projects, I make cynical comments with my critic pal, who unfortunately got accepted to genius school. But while I want to deal with myself alone and live without stupid rules, since they're what I've got, I can't express dissatisfaction unless I know the best way to bring it down. I still haven't decided, though, if it's easier to get away with things as a good student. I mean, I can break MAJOR rules and nobody says anything, and I'm never anything more than reprimanded for smaller rules. Ha, I mean, I skipped art class to sit in the bathroom with my friend who was upset. I walk in during lunch and explain, and she changes the roll sheet and buzzes the office to tell them she just overlooked me, when the secretary there knew damn well what I was doing.  Wow. Tangents much?

      The band pool party was today, I had so much fun. Everyone had funky tanlines, and there was a guy orgy. They had a little volleyball, and since I can't see without my glasses, I thought they were naked. Ha, there was some lesbianism too. I thought I'd be wearing more clothes than anyone, but I was wearing the skimpiest bikini, save three girls who were incredibly skinny and boobless. And Treola. But I don't care if I'm fat.  I spent the evening with Monica, Jessica, Jenny...I joked that I wanted Monica, and she kept bringing it up, so I started like rubbing up against her and stuff, and we would say it like, really loudly, and people would go "WHAT?" And we would start over. She's like, "Yeah, I love pretending I'm a lesbian, but I'm really not." Which lets me know exactly the kind of attitude that's accepted in Arkansas. Monica says that any happiness she has is a face. I enjoy talking to her, more than she likes talking to me, I'm sure. Because I get so incredibly ditsy. I kept talking about my scrunchie. Who the hell cares about my scrunchie? *I* don't care about my scrunchie. Honestly. I don't know what it is about me and people. I'm either bitchy or so stupid. I don't want to be stupid around Monica, I want to seem intelligent, but I just can't manage it. It's especially hard when you're wearing a hot pink polka dotted bikini...anyway, I don't mind seeming stupid in front of some people, but it's hard when you want the person to respect you. And I KNOW she's not one of those "everyone has redeeming qualities" people.  I had to tape Big Brother...I love Big Brother, I'm not sure why. The people are stupid and annoying, the challenges are dumb, and it's on like every freaking night, but I still enjoy watching it.  Something more intelligent was planned for today, I had a thought that was bothering me all day until the swim party. Then I forgot it. Maybe tomorrow I'll have something better, but for now, tis merely a recording of events.  My nose peeled for the second time. Here's The Nose Chronicles:  Thursday: Nose burns Friday: Nose blisters Saturday: Nose REALLY blisters Sunday: Nose becomes crispy, all skin peels Monday: Nose is about to die, cannot be touched Tuesday: Nose becomes crispy again, peels second time

      I just spent the last hour of my life replying to Lauren's email, rather stupidly, I'll admit. I have my intelligent times when nobody's around, god damn it.  I had a nice long entry planned about various greivances, but I now have five minutes to prepare for a long, long day.  I HATE THIS TIME OF YEAR. School always makes me question everything about myself. I need to realize that I am who I am regardless of what other people think, and I KNOW that's what I need to know, but knowing the words for it doens't make it any easier to DO.

      From Tara:  I love you sweetie and I hope you have an absolutely wonderful day. You are a great girl and I love talking to you! Keep on smiling! :)  Love ya,  Tara   It's crap like that that makes me happy to have friends. I'm a complete PDA person. Not in the "tongue down my throat" variety, but just...the knowledge that somebody thinks I'm awesome.  Amendment to the previous: I respect Tara's choices, but I don't support them. That's a more accurate statement.

      I can't respect Tara anymore. I won't post our conversation here, though it's tempting. I've just...I've stopped caring when she does shit like this. It's her life. I TRIED, I failed, and trying again would mean I'd lose her as a friend. Besides, she's legal, she can do it legally, and she's going into college. But honestly. I mean, I'm not mad...just disappointed. I looked up to her as an example of what I wanted.  I'm so happy, though, still. Guard got off at noon instead of 3 like everyone else, we get to come back and practice from 6 until 8, when it's cooler. GO GUARD! I don't know what I'm doing blogging when the SMART thing to do would be to go and shower. I can't believe I'm trusting everything to a blog anyway. What if the internet dies? Plus, you can trace people online. I'm not sure if it'd be easier for my mom to find my blog or my journal, just in case, I took the city out of my profile.  I hate it when people do stupid things and you can't help, and there's no sense in losing their friendship over it, but you can't do anything. Yeah. I'll go put a letter in the mail, shower, eat lunch, and pass out. Tara forgot to call Jesse and tell him to call me about lunch, so I guess it isn't happening. Because today's the last day he can call before Thursday. I'm pissed. :-) But still happy.  My farmer's tan hasn't become any less noticeable, but that's probably because I can't compare to how it was before. My legs, however, are awesome. They went from albino to paper to pasty to normal white. I'm no longer a ghost! One more day like this and I'll have the beginning of a tan. The dermatologist in me is kicking myself.  Water hurts my face. I'm actually SCARED to shower.

      It's 6:30 in the morning, which I usually don't mind. In fact, last year, I had this weird habit of getting up at 4 to let the damn dogs out. And yet, when you've gotten inadequate sleep for the last two months, 6:30 is a very harsh mistress. I only have an hour and a half until I have to be at the school, luckily we're all of thirty seconds away so I can make a mad dash to get ready ten minutes before 8 and make it there with eight minutes to spare.  A good thing about being up this early is that I get to talk to Nadine. I love talking to her, when I make sense or don't. Something about her puts me on guard, and it's nice for a change. We don't really talk about much, she tells me about her life, I tell her about mine, we talk about various other things that I'm fairly sure don't interest her, and we're on our way. I don't feel extremely attached to her, but I like talking to her OK, and that's different.  This is probably the oddest thing to think about, but I can't decide what to wear. I have a farmer's tan, and while I probably won't wear anything other than t-shirts and long-sleeved shirts over the year, it's bothering me. I can either wear a t-shirt and roll up the sleeves, or wear a tank top, which gives me two options: slutty white cleavage tank top, or tie-dyed tank top I told myself I'd never wear again but which still resides in my closet, because I have big plans for homemade tie-dyed underwear. Yes, really.  On a completely nonrelated note, if I don't eat soon, I may pass out. That's the bad (good?) thing about the school year: I'm hungry in the mornings. When I wake up at nine or ten, my body's already gone into starvation and I won't eat until dinner because I'm not hungry. I just don't notice it. And now I feel like I'm about to DIE from hunger. I hate when I wake up starving and I can't eat fast enough...and then it kills my stomach. Anyway, I have to eat light because even though I'm coming home at noon, Nicole does hard workouts.

      "Accept the next proposition you receive"...in bed.  I have this strange vision of me waking up late tomorrow and running to Early Week in my pajamas. And I'll do it, damn it, because I'm lazy and also because I have an extra set of clothes in the guard room. Go me. Tomorrow it's full band, no longer just rookies and freshmen. Which sucks, because I can't be superior to my freshman friends anymore. :-P And also that people who are more likely to have a predisposed opinion of me. Meaning that I have to deal with people who think I'm a huge spaz. I've changed so much over the summer. Although I'll probably still harass Chris about his purse...is he even in band? I think he is...most of my friends are in band.  Good thing: I can see all the people I care to see. I really DO have fun, even if they aren't people I would consider great friends. Maybe I'll actually get invited to stuff this year. Which reminds me, I must now never let anybody who attends school with me to see this blog...  I hope Miranda didn't drop out like she said she would. I know Agneatha's getting her GED, but Miranda was so awesomely cool that it would suck if she left. Even if she thinks all feminists have saggy boobs...she won't be in choir anymore, but maybe we'll have some stuff together. We had great fun in Algebra 2, me and her and Laurie. Ooh, and I can't wait to see Lana. She's great, insulting and really sweet at the same time. It's really weird, for having no friends, I sure miss a lot of people. I have so many acquaintances, so many people I have fun with, but none of them know me. I'm the quiet girl, the loud girl, the crazy girl, the crafty girl, the smart girl...but nothing more.  This is depressing me. I must now wallow. Yay! :-)

      Disorder  Rating Paranoid: Very High Schizoid: High Schizotypal: High Antisocial: High Borderline: Moderate Histrionic: High Narcissistic: Very High Avoidant: High Dependent: High Obsessive-Compulsive: High  URL of the test:  urlLink http://www.4degreez.com/misc/personality_disorder_test.mv   The sad part is, it's true. All of it. Which is strange, because I don't like messing with people but I like being the center of attention. I want to be noticed without having to DEAL with these people.  We bought raspberry Pop Tarts the other day, they're so good! I heated them up and they weren't too bad, but I think I like this kind cold better. Like, chocolate Pop Tarts, any kind, are SO GROSS heated. They should make like, a lemon cheesecake Pop Tart, with grahm cracker pastry and lemony filling. That would be awesome.  I made another bracelet last night. It's not as nice as my other two, because the bead I was forced into using for the clasp is a light gray while the rest of it is dark. It's not TOO bad, though. I'm going to make a red and black one to use some of the cool red crystals I bought.  I have to start thinking about what I'm getting Lauren for her birthday, I know it's in October and I'll have money then, but if it's possibly, I want to make her something nice. My plan was to get some thin black wool yarn and make a really nice scarf, but then I realized she lives in Arizona. So, with the extent of my skills, she's getting a necklace. :-P Problem: I see Lauren being very picky about jewelry, if she wears any. And I mean, I know it's "the thought that counts", but I'd really rather NOT have my skills DIE.  Speaking of crafting: WestFest. I have to decide NOW if I'll take that weekend off. I have to send in the forms, arrange the tent, and MOST of all, start making scarves. While I have a fair few, I don't have enough to fill up an entire space, and on top of that, I only have one West Fork scarve. That's not NEARLY enough. It's on a first come-first serve basis, but I know I'll get a spot. It's just a matter of if I want to take that weekend off. I think I will, because I'll probably make more selling than I will working.  I'm SO glad I don't have to work many hours anymore, but I'm only getting 70 dollars every two weeks. I'll probably have to give about 20 out of each check to insurance, and like 10 to gas. So that's 40 dollars every two weeks. When I first decided to cut back, I was thinking, WOW, 70 dollars! But now it seems like so little. Not a TERRIBLE deal, but I think I'll pick up a weeknight. Which means I have to kick in more for gas, but hey. And since my first check won't be NEARLY what it was going to be since I took this weekend off and missed out on 80 dollars, I should have just enough for contacts. But I think I'll get new shoes first, and some new clothes...I'm in desperate need. I'm sick of lame t-shirts that I've been wearing since 8th grade. I haven't had new school clothes since then. Besides, I don't need my contacts until like September 6, that's our first game. I can't wear my glasses because they make me look different and I'm mortally afraid I'll knock them off my face and they'll be trampled on. Drumline stops for no man. So I can save up for them.  I finally got smart and uploaded all the CDs I own onto my computer so I don't have to actually USE them unless I use my discman for practicing outside. My burner's shot or else I'd just burn everything again. Ooh, only in different orders to make the CDs more suitable for practicing. You know, slow stretchy songs, followed by songs with easy beats for drop spins, then fast-paced routine songs, then songs to practice stuff I'm SUPPOSED to be practicing, then slow songs to warm down and stretch again.  I love getting big long emails, even if my replies are inadequate...thanks, Dae and Lauren!

      I went to the mall. I gave up on trying to get the look I want. It doesn't matter. I bought a light green striped polo with a white collar. I'll never wear it. I got my hair cut. It sucks. I wear my hair in a bun anyway. I got contacts. I'll use them for spinning, but not much else. There's no point in trying to impress anybody.  Purchases I'm actually happy about: I got my stepdad a card with a dancing lab, and it says, "I thought you might enjoy a lab dance for your birthday." I got my mom a Happy Bunny keychain that says, "Hi. Cram it". I got myself a copy of Revolutionary Girl Utena, manga, because a) I couldn't find the anime and b) why not? Lauren's got me to the dark side. I spent the last hour of my mall trip outside reading it. So cool. I have to get my stepdad a real present too. I have ten dollars.  It took me about fifteen minutes to get the contacts into my eyes, but once I got the first one in, the second one went in quickly. Then I had to take them out and start over. I go back in a week for a checkup, which is good. I have slight astigmatism in my left eye, and I can tell. They tried to make up for it by giving me a slightly stronger prescription, but I can't see as well. Everything's slightly fuzzy, and I can't really see distances. It's awesome, though, seeing what I look like without them. I haven't done it since I was seven, other than EXTREME mirror close-ups and pictures.  I made Dae a bracelet awhile ago but never got the chance to give it to her. If anybody else wants it? I can't really keep either one of them, they're upsetting me. I have a tanline from wearing it during Early Week, and I have to wear my watch over it. Anyway, maybe I'll just rip them apart and reuse the beads? Ah, I'm so proud of them. But they just...yeah. And I've decided to wait on making the necklace until I get an email back. I'm either going to do a peyote strap choker, or a RAW necklace.  I've started reading Wicked, I've still got Popular on repeat. I need to wash my face. You know, I don't even care anymore. Maybe I WON'T.  My mom assumes that because I had a small Mountain Dew during lunch that it's my new favorite drink. To be honest, I can't stand it. I thought the caffeine would help. It doesn't.

      Ever hear of the calm before the storm.  That's what that was.  I have gone through the most painful ordeal in my life. And all I can think to do is make a stupid post about it.  I need to talk to somebody, but I don't have anybody to go to.  A stranger reading this might assume I'm an angsty teen. For once, they might actually be right.

      I'm happy.  This is so odd. I was just sitting here, and I realized it.  I haven't been happy in about a month. I haven't felt anything in about a month. I've been so apathetic. Even things that "affected" me didn't affect me. I'm so content right now, I feel like a purring cat. I love little decisions, listening to the same song over and over again, and making a big drama over what to read next. I love talking to Emily Jo, I love making useless blog posts, I love being tired and full at nine-thirty. I love being to lazy to go get cake. I'm so happy with the world right now. My life is working out for me. I have nothing to complain about. I love life.  Sudden revelations are amazing.

      I had a giftcard so I bought a manga...if I don't like it, I have big plans for bitchin' wallets. :-)  Grace turned me on to Wicked. I own the book but haven't read it yet. I'm still working on the thousand books I bought in Vegas. But now I'm listening to the soundtrack. It's great, although obscenely nasal.  I hate Arkansas, there are so many books banned. Especially at Hasting's, since it's run by a Christian guy. But...yeah...there was one copy of 1984, which I haven't seen anywhere in Arkansas, I think, and it was so tempting, but I couldn't have afforded anything else. Anyway, Digital Fortress looks AWESOME, and I trust Lauren's judgement.  We went to dinner, and I ordered fried rice, and I almost died. There was enough for about six people. So I, being the fatass I am, ate like half and saved the rest for both lunch and dinner tomorrow. Ahhh, and there's cake in the microwave. Oh, yeah, apparently people think it's funny to call anorexic people fat, so I want to go up to like Monica one day and go, "Why don't you ever eat, you anorexic bitch?"  I want to paint my nails, but I'm working Sunday. It's OK to have light polish, I'm sure, but I was either going to paint them hot pink, or sharpie over what I've got now. Maybe hot pink with polka dots or stripes. But we aren't allowed to have polish at work. I'm going in from 8-3, so it'll be my first breakfast run. Sunday afternoons are slow, though. Fun! I can't work tomorrow, my contact appointment is at 11:15 tomorrow, and I'm going shopping before and after.  Ahh, this song is so addictive.

      In ACE today, we had all our assignments worked out. But Rebecca didn't have any of her top three choices. Even though she DID, because we can't count math, ALL second halfers have to do math. So instead of just accepting our choices, Ms. Roberts made us draw for World History and Art History. I'm in World and Chem, I was in Art and Chem. I WANT Art. Rebecca got Art, which was her second, but we're going to talk to Ms. Roberts. Maybe she'll let us switch? She said over the weekend that she would cement us into our assignments, but maybe she'll let us switch? Then Becca and I would both have our first choices. Matt Jones REALLY wants World, and instead, he's in Bio and Physics, so basically, he switched with Rebecca. I feel so bad for him. I wish we could just keep what we decided on. The first half has six people, so one gets cut but they won't know who until too late. So they have to split up subjects so that they'll be OK when that person drops. Ha, all the second half people get to play. Oh, and for other people's benefits: First and Second halves have nothing to do with intelligence or capability. First half is more English and history, second half is more science and math. But I'm fine in second half, because it's a lot less vocabulary.  My nails are so long. I've had my nail polish on for about a week and it hasn't chipped or anything. Everyone's making fun of me for having pink nail polish. Just because I don't want to wear pink anymore doesn't mean I can't have pink nails. I'm just sick of wearing exactly the same things. I mean, I'll wear the same things, but they have to be the DIFFERENT same things. So I'm going shopping tomorrow...  I'm getting sick of Guard and spinning. Seriously, it's getting bitchy, and I'm starting to go, "I have to SPIN today?!" At least during Early Week, we got to socialize more and change from thing to thing, we weren't always spinning. Oh, Peggy gave me her flag to sew. Evil.  In physics, we had to build the highest tower out of one sheet of paper and 30 cm of tape. One group used tripods, a lot of other groups used bases and built up out from it. Chris and I had the coolest design, we built paper arches and crossed them over each other. It was stable, but it didn't get very high. It looked AWESOME. He kept referring to ours as "artsy". Oh, and at lunch, I couldn't find Monica or Jenny, and I stood in a circle with the guy equivalent of our group and talked with them, it was awesome. Then everyone else joined us and we decided that Oprah is the newest insult. "Skank." "Bitch." "Whore." "Oprah." "OH NO YOU DIDN'T." We have great fun being...well, stupid.  Oh, and I refuse to let my secret determine how I feel all day. I was sad like ALL DAY because of it.  I need new music. Recommendations neccessary.

      I am IN LOVE with my notebook, but I wish I'd done it on two seperate notebooks instead of both on one.  The front side is just a lip collage, nothing special, but definitely better than stupid pictures of friends or something. Seriously, people. That's not creative. Anyway, the back is just plain white paper that I packing-taped over so it's like a dry erase board. I'll take a couple sets of markers. I know I could just say, WRITE on it, but it's a composition book, first, and second, I HATE WRITING ON THINGS. It never looks right when I do it, so I just don't touch it. Besides, this lets me change what it says. But it would have been way cooler to let this one go on with just the lips, and done the whiteboard thing on another one. Oh well. It's still OK.  Right now, the notebook reads: "Because I'd rather not talk about your dead exboyfriends over coffee." I love Harry and the Potters.

      Honestly, it wasn't that bad. I enjoy my classes. I like the people. I finally, finally feel accepted by the crazy people I have lunch with.  AP US with Beall rocks. Mr. Beall likes me, he makes us coffee in class as long as we bring a pound in. He said nothing flavored, because then ALL the coffee smells like raspberry or whatever for a week, but I'm bringing flavored creamer. I'm a wimp, what can I say? I wrote "a pound of coffee" on my school supplies list and my mom cracked up. She thought I was joking. She's like, "Do you want me to make you coffee in the mornings now?" Ha, no. I'm a social drinker. I can quit whenever I want.  TPC with Creekmore is going to be evil. She just got out of teaching 10 year olds. So she treats us like ten year olds. She sent us home with a note for our mommies to sign. And she's incorporating Step Up to Writing by using highlighters? Step Up to Writing is such a waste anyway. It's a middle school program that doesn't even work there. It's formulaic writing, and while it's OK to a certain extent...they just go against all bounds of common decency. It's to teach people how to write essays, very, very basically. But I'm beyond it. They're taking me back, bringing me down. Anyway, one of Ms. Creekmore's rules is: Be Innocent.  I LOVE MS. ROBERTS. She talks like a debutante from the 60's, and she likes talking about literature. Even if she is obsessed with grammar, I still like her. Good thing, because I have two classes with her. Rebecca, Rachel, and I are the three new ACE girls. I have to pick a half.  First half: Vocabulary, Shakespeare, literature, current events, US history, US government, geography. Second half: Mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, art history, world history, sports.  I want to do first half, but so does EVERYONE else. However, world history is my best subject, and I want to study art history, that sounds like a great topic to have. But all second-halfers have to be OK with math. I can do math. I can memorize formulas. I'm not motivated in math class to do well, so I don't. That's better than blaming on myself anyway. I ENJOY math, but I'm not good at it. All first-half people have to do vocabulary, which I excell at.  Physics will be a joke.  Lunch was awesome, Monica, Jenny, Chris, Joe, Jessica, Steven...we all stood in the middle of the hall. Monica wore balls today. She keeps saying it would be fun to go goth, I agree. I mean, it's something to do. She can carry it off, though. I look awesome in black, but I can't do the jewelry or...well, I think I'm just too ditzy to do it. We were badasses this morning, we had a little sermon du jour from the principal in the gym, and instead of sitting on one of the bleachers, we sat in the little foot space. When he said, "And be nice to the freshmen, you were all freshmen once", Jenny said, "Actually, I was hatched from an egg." It was great fun, we made little snarky comments for the next thirty minutes.  Mr. Ed Gay (yes, that is his real name) pulled me aside after choir and asked me if I was somebody he could trust to confide in. He asked me about some people in class and to be perfectly honest, there's only one person in the class I wouldn't sell out. I don't care about most of them and seriously dislike three of them. But I asked him about regionals. In order to take choir, here's what I'm missing out on: AP Bio, Politics and Government, AP European History, creative writing, and journalism, and I told him that. I'm not ready to give up choir yet, it's very important to me.  ACE is going to be great this year, it's quite a bit of reading and studying, but nothing none of us didn't sign up for. Joseph Keck, had he stayed, would have been in all my classes but Choir and Band. It's really quite sad, I'll miss him. I wish I had his email, I should talk to Miranda tomorrow.  I saw Miranda in the halls during lunch, she had Starbursts and was unwrapped them with her tongue. I could do that at the height of my Starburst wrapper days, but sadly, I have lost my skills.  We need a journal for English, I'm either collaging it with lips or eyes. I NORMALLY hate collage, unless it has a cohesive theme, or is beautiful. Regular "stuff I like people I know" collage is incredibly stupid unless done extremely well.  There are tons more stories, but I need to get started on my notebook.

      Tara pointed out to me (and she's right) that a major problem with me and personal relationships is that I think everyone's competition, and that other people can't like me the same as other people. That's because that's how my mind works. I've always ordered my friends, I've always kept a list. And there are ties sometimes, but I usually try to put someone ahead of everyone else. I mean, you could ask me to make a list right now and I could do it. It would be hard to decide number two and three, but other than that, I've totally got a top five. I don't want to think like this, I just DO.  My sunburn is STILL peeling, but it's doing it where I can't reach it now, in between my shoulder blades. Parts of my skin are REALLY dry and gross, I'll be doing some serious recon with my moisturizer later today.  School starts tomorrow. I've had my summer playlist on all day, I've added a couple songs to it. A lot of it is really hokey, but these are the songs that remind me of summer:  California by Phantom Planet Why Can't I by Liz Phair No Such Thing by John Mayer This Love by Maroon 5 The Boys of Summer by The Ataris Walking on the Sun by Smashmouth I Believe in a Thing Called Love by The Darkness Summer Girls by LFO Summer of '69 by Bryan Adams In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel Calling You by Blue October Stacy's Mom by Fountains of Wayne Hey Julie by Fountains of Wayne  That's summer. Any song on that entire list IS summer. There are some that are this summer in particular, but a lot of them belong to last summer, which in my mind was the perfect summer. Even though I didn't do anything, go anywhere, or change out of pajamas for two months.  And the perfunctory list of what I learned this summer:  -I can toss in Guard -I need friends -People can like other people and still like me (I'm working on this one) -HTML isn't THAT hard -I can't take on everything and still live -Sunburns hurt -I should probably trust people more than I do -I'm way cooler than I think I am -The best place to be is at home, on my computer, in my pajamas -I should be more open-minded about things, because what I never considered might make all the difference -Don't promise you won't get upset and then throw a fit -Don't get so attached to people that you get clingy (too late...) -The less you talk to someone, the more you want to -I hate updating my website, somebody please do it for me  OK, that's enough. I was starting to come up with stupid things just to lengthen the list, a sure sign it's time to quit.  And my schedule: AP American Trig/Precal (The last year of math availible at my sucky school) AP English 3 Physics (There's no AP, but I'm taking the test at the end of the year anyway. The school pays if your grades are good enough) Choir!!! Independent Study for ACE team Band (I need to make new signs for the Guard Room door, we aren't allowed to cover up the window, though. So no Guard Room sex.)  I have spaghettios calling my name, they're the kind with GROSS little hot dogs that I have to pick out, but that's not such a big deal.  Oh, and I woke up this morning and my wrists hurt so badly, I honestly think I'm getting carpal tunnel. My mom's paying for all my contacts, but I have to give her whatever money my dad sends, so I need to call and harass him for money. I feel bad, because that's WHY I'm calling him. But I do need them.  I should really start Dae's necklace. Any day now.

      A short note of discontent: my mom has decided to ruin my last day of summer by staying home sick. I'm not counting tomorrow because I'll be running around all day.  When my mom's home, lots of little things are taken from me that add up to a big annoyance.

      Some stuff I forgot to mention:  My paycheck is actually one cent higher than I thought it was. That's it, now I have to party.  DDR is a lab experiment. We are mice. It's training you to push the buttons...  That's right, I played in the mall today. I hope you people are happy, I've joined you. What's this about a "cult"?  Two days of freedom. Neither technically free. Guard tomorrow, eye appointment Wednesday, as well as shopping, provided my dad sends a check.  My stepdad's birthday is in like ten days. I figured I'd have money to buy him something, but the way things are looking for me, I'll have ten dollars. And a pair of contacts.  And oh god. My county is ranked number 4 in the ENTIRE NATION for poultry production. Can I get a "yeehah"?  Yes, that's right, I had to make an entry for the express purpose of providing my one reader with a bunch of crap that honestly, nobody should care about. Except the DDR thing which was damned funny.

      Today's top story: my sunburn.  It's completely ravished all my skin. My skin is bubble wrap, literally. I knew the blisters were lurking but I thought it would work like my nose and just start peeling. I didn't think the blisters would come to the surface, or something. That was pretty stupid. It started peeling last night in some of the areas that hadn't been BADLY burned, but today, when I got back from being all nice and sweaty at guard, my upper arms, collarbone, cleavage, shoulderblades, and upper back were all bubble wrap. The blisters have stuff inside them, I discovered that at the same time I discovered the blisters. I went to fix my bra strap and popped like three of them, I thought I'd spilled something until I went to change clothes. And the area that was peeling before the blisters is now rashy red. Nice.  I got my first paycheck today. $70.05. Not bad, considering it's for only like 15 hours. OK, you're right, McDonald's is a bunch of cheap bastards, but money's money. I thought I'd have enough to pay for my contacts and have fifty left over, but they pay you for the work you did a month ago. So I'll be getting a 70 dollar paycheck every two weeks from now on. Just working one day a week, 8 hours. My mom and stepdad are paying for half my contacts, so I can afford them with 10 dollars left over, oh joy. I need to call my dad back and confirm that he's also sending money. I can use my money on contacts and his on clothes. I forgot to call him the other day, I SHOULD do it now. But I won't. Lauren's first on my call list, and I'm waiting for HER to call ME, because she's always busy. Anyway, if I tell him I'm using his on school clothes, he'll send more. That's just how it works.  I spent a good part of my day reading Maddox. I don't know why. It's not like he has anything to say that I can't get anywhere else on the internet, AND he pretends he's a pirate. Woo. Party. We got a Delia's catolog in the mail. Actually, it was addressed to my mother, but she gave it to me so I can buy overpriced clothes online. Yay? I'm thinking about signing up for the arts and crafts portion of the county fair, all entries are due Saturday. I don't think I have anything good enough, but you never know. My crochetting sucks, but I think I could be entered in the teen category and kick some ass. Why? Because there aren't any other crochetting teens in my county would consider entering. I'm the Craft Diva and they know it.  Janet was online for all of fifteen minutes today, but it was still great to talk to her. She won't have internet full-time until SEPTEMBER 6, when she's in college. Tara's moving into her dorm today. I miss her already. We had a big fight last night. I apparently make her so mad she wants to strangle something. Over the internet. She only said fuck about a million times. I cracked up laughing, and told her that...she only got madder. It's HER problem if she lets some internet chick get to her that badly. All because I care about her enough to not want her to move. Although if I REALLY cared about her, I'd want her to do what makes her happy, even if it means we'd never talk again. I hate loops.  Oh, and the carwash Peggy got us at WALMART is cancelled. Lesson: don't trust Peggy. She hasn't come through on ANYTHING so far, and she damned annoying.  Tara just came online, didn't say anything to me, and left to watch gymnastics with somebody named Bridget. Seriously, when will people learn that I'm usually right about these sorts of things?  I will now go back to my miserable existance of waiting for phone calls that will never come, pretending I have a life, and procrastinating. (Overused punchline:"...or, I could do it later.")

       urlLink Should a Christian Play Dungeons & Dragons? : "The total absence of Jesus Christ the Lord as sovereign from D&D and almost all FRPGs is what makes them so spiritually dangerous - not talking about Hitler or having girl characters dressed provocatively."  "But any game which draws people away from a true understanding of Jesus, God, salvation and the cosmos IS soul-destroying in the truest possible sense of the word."  "The mind is the primary battleground of your spiritual destiny. It is where the devil does his best work."  "Unless the gamer is a person of strong moral fiber, it is likely they will eventually be drawn by the seductive power of magic into thinking thoughts that are entirely contrary to the thoughts of God. This is the devil's intention."  "Now this is not to say that every serious D&D gamer is going to become a Satanist or demonized. But the odds are good that they might. Please realize that to be demonized does not mean you become a slavering maniac who vomits pea soup.  Most demonized people could not be identified as such by someone without Biblical discernment. But all one has to do is watch the news or walk through the halls of any high school to realize that there are lot of demonized young people."  Oh god, I'm going to Hell.

      Ahh, one last thing for the day. I always do that, I forget to say something and then it's too late to go back and edit because it's been out there for forever.  Anyway, Jenny and I decided that we want to play Dungeons and Dragons, just to see what's with it. Jenny said Monica would play too. It's my job to figure out exactly how we'd go about playing it, since I'm the one with unlimited resources (read: internet).  Jenny's like, "I'm a nerd, but without the pocket protector...I have the braces, though!" I tried to do my nerd laugh, but I screwed it up since my throat is sore. It amuses me to no end that that's my stepdad's real laugh. He laughs like a nerd. Anyway, I told her that I have the glasses, so together, we make a whole nerd.  Sunburn news: It's still blistered, beneath the skin. You can see the bumps but they aren't surfacing. It still itches on the edges, but it's getting better. And my cleavage is about a thousand times better.  We have another carwash next Saturday at WAL-MART! I think I'll wear a different top, or POSSIBLY keep my t-shirt on. I wanted to wear a thin white shirt and wet myself down on Thursday but all my white shirts went in June's Great Drawer Purge.  I still need to start Dae's necklace. No more procrastinating!

      My desktop is pissing me off.     1) The volume icon will not disappear. I hate having it there. It's completely unneccessary and it's upsetting, because I have no need to screw with the volume.  2) The website is THERE, it can obviously find the server because I'm looking at the website as I'm posting this!  3) I hate having anything other than a plain black desktop, but I'm such a loser that unless I have my schedule clearly visible, I'll forget what I'm doing from one day to the next. But that's only because I have Early Week going on. Once school starts, I'll still schedule myself, but I'll remember it better.  4) More than one row of icons bothers me. AND I don't know what the icon's for but I think it has to do with the fact that my stepdad installed something on my computer as a birthday present and expected me to be aware of it. Or something.  I've wanted to watch Zoolander since Thursday, but I don't think I will, because I'm procrastinating. I still can't believe an entire day just went  by and I haven't done a damn thing. I also think it's sad that it's August, I'm sunburned, and I'm FREEZING in my own house. I have to wear yoga pants and Justin's hoodie to keep warm. And as if that wasn't enough, school starts Thursday, I have no clothes, no supplies, and I'm not mentally ready. Then again, I never am. Last year, I was in summer mood until February, literally. I was asking people what they did over the summer well into October. At least it helped the year go by quickly. I think I'll start a countdown of weeks until school's over. I'll make a paperclip chain and stick it in my purse. I need a new purse. The one I have is the one I made, and it's CUTE, but very impractical. There aren't any pockets and everything's just sorta dumped in there. I want Jenny's purse, it's green corduroy.  How is it possible to have a pimple on my upper lip? Honestly.

      I just spent the last hour reading Lauren's friends' blogs. I'd say that I need to get a life  but that's just not true anymore. This break from life is awesome. I say that now, but I'm sure once school starts, I'll be dying for Early Week. I mentioned in an email earlier that I like busy, as long as it's scheduled busy, but I'm starting to question that. I'm a serious planner, I hate fuzzy plans, but I'm starting to get some spontaneous. I think it's because my mom is actually letting me. Joining Guard was probably the best thing to happen to me, because there are so many last minute things that aren't optional.  I'm insanely happy I didn't work today, even thought Sundays are slow and fun. Breaktime. I'm almost dreading going back to work, because I've been away so long. At heart, I'm a lazy bum. If the manager hadn't taken away all my reasons for quitting, I would. As soon as I save enough money to add to my growing pile of possessions. I hope we don't move any time soon, I've gotten complacent. I used to be able to pack my room in four boxes, not including the two in storage, but I don't think I could do it anymore. In the six months since I moved here, I've become a complete different person. It's weird, because I crave routine and regiment, but I die if I'm in one place for too long. It keeps me from growing.  Yeah, I think the reason I don't freak out whenever we move is a) because moving is part of the yearly routine and b) my room basically stays the same. Because I DO freak out when my computer is screwed with or somebody moves something on my wall. Since my room stays constant, I can deal with moving it to another part of the town/state/country. I have a feeling we'll be moving in January. Our lease here was for six months, so I figured we'd be moving after that, but we didn't. I'm fine as long as we stay in West Fork. It may be a small town, but I'm committed now. And I refuse to drop all my activities. I already had to do it once. Anyway, my mom thinks we might be here for awhile, at least until I graduate. She doesn't like moving any more than I do. Her dad was in the Air Force.  Tara's moving. To college. Tomorrow. I don't want her to go, it's already different. I know we won't talk as much, we already don't. It's killing me. Jeff was over at her house. She said it was "a goodbye thing". I don't want to know. I don't want her to tell me. I won't freak out again, that was a one-time thing, but I'm still pretty pissed. I want her to make the right decisions but I can't really influence her.  I have no tact, by the way, as evidenced by this:  nay the obscure (9:56:50 PM): [12:51:26] Happily Damned: I only hate you because you're stupid, Nadine. A Thing for Jaz (9:58:00 PM): Hm. It means very, very little coming from me, but I don't think you're stupid. You're the only person who sees through my crap. nay the obscure (9:58:01 PM): :'-( A Thing for Jaz (9:59:13 PM): You aren't stupid. I can see why people would hate you, but that's because of noncompatible personalities.A  Thing for Jaz (9:59:40 PM): Wow, I always manage to say the wrong thing... nay the obscure (9:59:55 PM): yeah, I was thinking that... nay the obscure (9:59:56 PM): =p A Thing for Jaz (10:00:12 PM): Wait, you were thinking that I always say the wrong thing? That's funny! nay the obscure (10:00:29 PM): why is it funny. nay the obscure (10:00:36 PM): if it is TRUE!!!!????!!!??!!!?!?!?!?!?!?  I mean, I knew I had no tact, but to have another person say it...I've been trying to keep my mouth shut when I know I'm about to say something tactless, but it doesn't happen. I've been getting worse lately.  Oh, and I've been getting WAY better at controlling my public stupidity. I managed to get through a conversation with Monica without completely going crazy. I need somebody to like, follow me around and smack me when I say dumb things. I mentioned that at the pool party the other day and Monica smacks me in the head and goes, "Shut up." Monica's great.  Yesterday, Jenny says, "Can you stand up if I do this?" and kicked me in the back of the knee. I had my knees locked at the time and like, fell to my knees. I have a huge bruise now, it's hurting to sit. She apologized, and I know she didn't mean to hurt me, so we're OK. But if it happens again, that is IT. Ooh, which reminds me. Conversation I had:  Me: OK, you know what, do that again and I'm going to open up a can. Her: What? Me: A can. Her: Of what?  I've decided to wait to get my ears pierced until my second check. I called my dad and got like 40 dollars towards my contact exam. That was another amusing conversation. Anyway, that gives me about forty more to spend on clothes. I screwed around with my money last year and didn't buy stuff I needed. This year, I'm not making the same mistake.  I need to get started on Dae's rainbow necklace today. I need to mail the bracelet I made her in the first place. Damn lack of stamps.
