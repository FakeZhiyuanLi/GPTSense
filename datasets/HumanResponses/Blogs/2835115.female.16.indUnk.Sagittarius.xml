      Soreness....  Well, my friends, I went back to Tae Kwon Do.  Now I am sore....  3v!1 |\/|4rk...  Weird stuff the first night I am back.  I was also partnered with someone who can't really punch or block....  I thought about punching her, but I didn't... Guess I'm too nice. *1 hour later* Oops... forgot I was writing in this...   Yeah.... well.... I'm sleepy.  ADIOS!

      Well, I don't think I have da flu.  Seeing as I feel better.  Yes, well, I think I will be back to school tomorrow... Unless I feel like crap in the morning.  My neck hurts really bad right now.  Today was boring and uneventful.

      Is it a bad thing that I can't remember Saturday at all?  I know I wasn't drunk, because I don't drink. I can remember being online late Saturday night, but I can't remember anything before that.... Maybe my brain is shorting out.  Or maybe nothing happened.  Oh!  I went out to eat!  No... That was Friday night.  This is bugging me, but anyways... I am going to go to sleep now.  I need it, dudes and dudettes.  Well, TTFN... Gosh I haven't said that in a while....  GYA!  Going now!

      I feel like crap.... I have the flu... I was going to go shopping today, and now I am just like, I can't do anything... I have no personal servants right now either...  My dad and bro are not home.  I just hurt.  Well, that's all for now.

      I feel so unloved.... no one gave me any valentine's day anything.  On top of that there is this guy and he keeps calling me a feminen man....  I really don't like it...  Maybe it's his really uncool way of trying to flirt with me.... Dude, Kamui, if you're reading this please stop.  Let's see what else happened today?  Um... Well, I glared at a guy in my Japanese class, but I do that every time that I see him.  It's not that I don't like him, I'm just messing around with him.  He's pretty nice.  Even though he likes to laugh at me.  Well, there is still church later today so if anything exciting happens there I'll tell ya.

      I am so glad that tomorrow is Friday.  Only one more long, and boring day of school.  Then I have a 3 day weekend.  Which is really cool because a couple of my friends in Buffalo are coming for a visit.  It's been about a year since I last saw them.  I also might have to do some extra duties around the house on Monday, but that's okay with me.  It'll pay off in the end seeing as it is for money to get a Data stand up.  I don't know for sure if I am going to get paid for my work, but I am sure that I will have to work.  Oh, well, it's all good.  I had to clean the cat pan today.  It didn't smell as bad as I thought it would be though.  Yeah, smells make me throw up.... That is why I don't like to clean up after the dog.  Stupid dog.  Well, she hasn't messed in some time, and if she does soon, I'll make my bro clean it.  Why am I talking about this?  Sorry, I guess that I am rambling.  Hey, there is orange juice on the counter.  I like orange juice.  Gya!  Rambling again!  Man, there is so much on my "want" list right now.  I really need a job.  Well, since I have nothing better to do I will list off what I want.  (I really need a job.)  A new comp, an xbox, a hat, and a Data stand up.  I feel like a brat for wanting this stuff though.  That is why I have only asked for the Data stand up, because I doubt that they will buy me anything on the list.... Well, maybe the hat.... GYA!  I'm at it again!  Okay, I will now talk about my day.  Well, today started out like a normal day.  The alarm went off at 6:30, but I hit the snooze button twice finally waking at 6:44.  I then got dressed and got ready for school.  When I dot to school I sat with my normal crew.  Then I walked to art with Sarina, who also has art first period, on the way I saw some one who I was not expecting to see.  I had also had a dream about seeing them unexpectedly the night before.  Then I went through the rest of my day.  I must say that I think I did quite well on the Japanese quiz I had today.  Yea!  I really need some goof quiz scores in there.  I also found my missing Biology binder.  (Go me.)  I also got my mom very annoyed with me, but I said I was sorry and there is peace once more in my house.  And I think that is about enough out of me.  Oh, did I mention that my friends... Yes I did.  This is Anchan signing off.

      Well, it's been a few, but, ya know, you can just get so darn busy doing nothing in particular...  Where have these past few days gone?!  The most eventful thing that has happened was I missed the bus on Tuesday.  Nothing happened yesterday, and the most exciting thing today was watching two episodes of Star Trek.  Yes, I like Star Trek.  I haven't watched it in a while though.  I need to start doing that.  Watching Star Trek every night.  Oh, and my Empire is coming along quite well.  I got a leader for my Mafia today, which was a good thing.  Well, I am signing off for the night!  Adios!

      It's been 2 days.  I meant to post yester day, but I was busy, and when I wasn't busy my parents were using the computer that had internet.  Oh, well.  But this weekend was fun.  Even though I couln't go to game night at my church.  I was going to bring my ghetto NES.  The reason why I couldn't go to game night was because I had to go to my grandparent's house.  (I'm not complaining, I had fun.)  I also learned a really cool card game called Hand and Foot.  Then on Sunday I went to church, and then I went to the mall.  Then when I got home, I played Zelda.  I was going to get online, but as said earlier, I was unable.  Oh, and the person who was supposed to give me a CD didn't.  Oh, well, I'll have to steal his hat again.... even though I didn't steal it in the first place.....  OH!  Oops.... I didn't get a hat....  Gr... that's what I wanted to get at the mall!  A hat!  Oh, well, looks like I'll have to beg $15 of my parents.  My friend is now talking to me about Space Camp... Oh, and they make big fire......  Over in the army section....  And the girls won.... Well, adios mi amigos, y amigas.

      I need a hat, and not just any hat, a cool hat.  One that looks good on me.  I'm also burning a cd right now.  Oh, thanks, for letting me wear your hat (You know who you are)!  It made me feel special.  Right now I am burning a CD.  I live a boring life.  I'll write back when things get more exciting.  Ciao!

      Well, I just got home.  Today was a good day.  It's snowing again.  Japanese class wasn't all the boring... maybe it was because me ad my friend Sarina opened one of those ads for hawafena in Herbla Esence shampoo.... then it got stolen and the smart people in that class got annoyed.  I swear I only did it once! Today I also made up a friend for one of Sarina's characters.  He needed a friend.  I think I am annoying one of my friends.  She never calls anymore...  Well, this weekend is going to be fun.  On Saturay I am going to my grandparent's house, so I might not be able to post.  I also think that I have found my theme song... It's "Grace" by U2.  I love U2, they rock.

      I hope there is another snow day tomorrow.... I really hate school... If I could, I would only go to my art class, but I need credits.  *Sighs.*  Ever notice how there is nothing good on TV anymore?  I mean when I was a little kid, it seemed like there was always something on.  Now everything is so trashy.... The only good channels are Discovery, Animal Planet, TLC, and the Travel Channel.  You know, I really want to go to Hong Kong.  I know that sounds completely random, but I was watching this thing on Hong Kong the other night, and that place rocks!  Since my parents started their new business, my mom says that we are going to Hong Kong in a few years.  That'll be so cool....  Only think is that I speak English, Japanese, and a little German.  That's okay, most people in Hong Kong speak English.  ^_^  It's late here now, so this is Anchan signing out!

      Wow... Um... I've never had a blog before.  Uh, well today there was snow, so I went for a walk.  My friend said I was a freak, and I am, but I don't know why he called me that.  He won't tell me why either.  Oh, well.  I tried making a snow man, but he proceeded to break in 3 pieces.  That made me really sad.  Is it stupid that I was sad about that?  Maybe I am crazy.

      OH!  Just remeber something!  The builder is going to start on our new house in about two weeks!  Isn't that cool?  nd my parents might have a buyer lined up for our current house.  That's cool too!  The only thing is is that they will probably want to move in at around the start of next years school year and the house won't be ready until like October.... So my parents were talking about temporary housing.... It'll be weird to live in an apartment....  I haven't lived in one since I was like 5.  Okay, this time I really have nothing else to say... Well, except that my parents are obessive weirdos who alreay have the tile picked out....

      Blah, blah, blah.  Yes, I know that I don't update, but my life is so boring!  I am surprised that there are actually people who read this!  Most of the time I am playing Mah-Jong, and Go, and other various games online.  The rest of the time I am bored or going to flea markets in search of junk!  Today I found some cool junk though...  I FOUND A KIMONO!!!!  But... my parents wouldn't buy it.... it was $70, and one of the cars broke down, so there isn't alot of extra money right now.  Also, I am cheap.  I go into Famous Barr and freak out because they are so expensive.... $58 for a skirt is not reasonable!  (Silly rich people.)  Yeah.  They had some pretty good bargins in the clearance section though... but the only reason that I went there was to return a sweater that my Grandma gave me... I thought it was ugly and am glad that it was way, way, way to big for me... I bought myself another Animal shirt.  I love The Muppets.  Other than that this week is boring... School holidays bore me, but I don't like to be at school either, I miss my friends I guess.  Lalala!  Okay moving on.... Well, nothing else important is coming to mind so Caio!  Luv ya!

      Yikes... Sorry about the lack of updates.  Well, right not life just plain sucks.  We lost the house.  (Paul Bunch sucks.)  But get this:  We might build the same house, in the same neighborhood, on a bigger lake, for cheaper.  Haha!  Ironic, huh?  I still will think that Paul Bunch is a greedy pig, and will not work with the real estate company who was selling the house.  I'm pretty sure the only reason why we lost it is because of his greed.  My parents were working with a different agent which would have meant that he would have had to share the commission, so he found his own buyer so that he would get every penny himself.  (Grr him.)  Oh, well.  It just means that God has something better out there for us....  (I also get the feeling that the basement will flood, because there was a drainage ditch that used to run right through where the middle of the house now is.....)  Other than that, life's not that bad.   Ew... I don't want to go to Tae Kwon Do tonight.   Bleh...  Well, adios.

      Hi!  Sorry about the lack of updates, but my parents have been computer hogs lately.  Well.... oh... box!  It's a gift, but not for me.... oh well.  Today was fun, and uneventful.  I want to go see Starsky and Hutch.  It looks funny.  Well, that's all I have to say right now.

      Hey there.  I realize that my last post was not very explanatory.    We were joking around with each other, and I said "I wuv you."  He was only replying.  Yeah, so I'm not depressed or anything.  I just can't find my card playing buddies.  (It's lunchtime right now.)  I usually play cards at lunch.  I haven't seen Cor today though.  He might not be here... Well, I dunno.  I think that the bell is going to ring soon so I should be going.  (Don't want to be late to class.)  Oh, and I am so glad that it is Friday.  Yeaness!

      I haven't been this moody in ages.  I just told my mom to shut up.  *Sigh.*  What the heck is wrong with me today?! I'm confused/depressed. WHAT THE HECK AM I DEPRESSED OVER?!  This happens all the time... When ever I have an experience where I get really close to God I always get depressed.  Stupid demons.  I really wish that I had some paints right now.  Get rid of this stupid depression by painting it out.  (Works well.)  I've been watching Star Trek lately, and that's why I haven't gotten around to updating.  Greg loaned me a tape.  I wanna give a shot out to the peeps who actually read this, and notice when I haven't up dated in forever.  I'm starting to feel better already. Ciao4now.

      Bad day, bad day.  You ever have one of those days that are really bad?  But, then there is really nothing wrong with the day?  Maybe it's the weather...  I usually like rain though... Maybe it's just winter blues.  Maybe it's because a guy has really confused me.  I have no idea how he meant "like."  Or, well, if you want to get technical what he said was "anata ga sukidesu."  Translated from the Japanese it means "I like you."  I dunno, I dunno.  I'm confused.  I want to talk to him, but I don't want to seem like an idiot for taking it the wrong way...  >_

      *Sighs.*  I dunno how long I can keep this up... To be friends with someone who puts me down, who scoffs at my darkest secret, who probably wouldn't have been there for me in my darkest hour.  Who says I can't do art.  Who thinks that my dreams are stupid...  Which is why I haven't told her them in a while.  I really want to be an artist, but I can just hear what she would say to me...  "Anja, why don't you get a real job?"  Oh, and get this, she thinks that she is my mother.  She tells me what I can't do.  Like when I had my first kiss... She gave me crap about that... She made something so sweet seem like I had done something so evil.  *Shakes head.*  This year she's changed.  I dunno.  I think that she may be jealous of me...  I don't know why she would be though...  It's like she wants me to be like her and not be myself.  She's getting as bad as a girl who I used to know, who I used to think was my friend...  Is it really worth it?  To be friends with someone like that?  I don't know anymore.

      Gawd... Life really sucks right now...  Gr...  I am not allowed to touch the computer at home.  So all updates will have to be made at school.  Which really bites.  I can't IM any of my friends, and no one uses the phone any more!  *Cries*  Darn it!  I have gaming guild after school, and I don't really want to go!  But if I don't go they will kill me.... Man, I can't wait until they get their new computer so that I get that one.  Well... then if it dies again I'll have to pay for the fixing myself... I wonder if one of my friends will still fix it for $50?  *Cries more.*  This is horrible.  I have a C- in bio.... Okay... It's all in how I think it is right?  So... if I think that my life sucks then it will... if I don't think that it sucks, then it won't suck... So my life is good, even though there are some set backs.  ^_^ And now every one knows why I haven't been online lately.  Oh!  Another thing:  I can't check my regualr e-mail right now so talk to me when you see me, and I'll give you an adress where you can still reach me at!  (And my phone number for those of you who don't know it.)

      Well, I had a very interesting phone conversation with one of my friends last night... Things aren't going so well for him... He's so upset... He's never been a bride's maid before... He keeps dying in his video game and....... There was something else, but I can't remember it right now... Shoot... It was funny, too... Darn it... It's only because I don't have the piece of paper that I wrote the conversation down on... Rats... Oh, well.  I'll get the paper later and write down the rest of the conversation for you all if you are interested...  ^_^  Oh, and does anyone know where the abandoned insane asylum is?  We've been trying to locate it all hour, and no one can tell me where it is... Veronica is going to write down directions to it for me... I'll probably get freaked out from all the Resident Evil games I've been playing lately... They are so creepy, but fun, fun, fun!  Tee hee!

I totally spaced out that I needed to call Elizabeth last night! Darn it!  Grr, argh!  I really need to.... wait I can e-mail her from here... I think... if I have her e-mail memorized....

I also hate the Pepto Bismol comercial where they are all dancing around... Hehe!  The chick on the end messes up!  Oh!  And there is this new cartoon on CN in the morning and they ripped off Resident Evil games.  My cousin Heather, And my now cousin Jimmy and I were like that's so retarded, but then we started watching Ed, Edd, and Eddy.  It was followed by a long day of non-stop action that included manicures and pedicures, and I must say that my feet have never looked prettier.  ^_^

      Wow!  Things have been so busy!  My cousin's wedding was yesterday and it was so so so much fun!  I was a bridesmaid in it, and, well, was tricked by the other bridesmaids that the guy I was walking with (his name was Steven) was tall.  Well, I met him Thursday and he was so short!  But damn! That boy could dance.  The reception was fun, but would have been so much more fun if I had known that I could bring a date.  I even know who I would have brought.....  *Drumroll.*  I would have brought one of my best friends... Corey.  Heehee!  ^_^'

      Hey it's summer.... oh, joy.... Well the past two days have been so eventful!  I can't believe that Drew is back from Hawaii!  God knows how much I've missed him.  I haven't seen him since like 8th grade.  We used to hang out all the time.  I saw him yesterday at the theater.  he hasn't changed at bit... he even still wears the Bulldogs hat... lol... Well, I hope I get to see him more this summer.  Other than that bad things have been happening....  John is really confusing me right now... I don't know what his deal is... oh well.... I was also scared to death today.  I thought one of my really good friends was drunk... I was so scared for him, but now it's cool, it was actually someone pretending to be him.... and now I am talking to two of my friends online, and all is well.

      Hey! I am back from camp! (Actually I've been back for like 2 days!) It was much fun, but I can not disclose details here! Bwahaha! (It's only because  someone  wants to hear it from me in person!) I wanna give a shout out to my bud Evan who is kickin' it in Cali and will be back soon, coz school starts in a month. I went shopping today, much funness, but my parents kept changing their minds on where or not I could go to the movies! GYA! Oh! Crazy kick butt super news! I'm getting my computer this month! I am also getting my license very soon! My license will allow me... OOH! ADRIAN BRODY IS ON TV! *Stops acting like a crazy fangirl.* Anyways... Where was I? Oh, yes! License! My license will allow me to keep up my end of the computer deal. I have to move all 4 computers to the new house, and set them up. (No big deal really, I like to set things up.) Well, hopefully I'll be able to go to the movies tomorrow. I'll just need to get the cash from my mother unit. Well, WHEEE!!!!

       Today is a glorious day! It is the day that I have chosen as the day that I cut my hair! I'm kinda nervous about it to tell you the truth... Sure my hair whips me in the eyes when I turn around quickly, but... I haven't cut my hair this drastically in a very long time... I think I am going to do some more hunting after I post this... Just to make sure that I pick the absolute best style... Oh, and I leave for camp Friday morning. Don't worry peeps, I should be back Monday afternoon, so... I'm off to hunt! Ciao!

      Ooh!  Funny story about seeing Catwoman!  Well, I had just come out of Catwoman when I saw a kid (he looked maybe 12 or 13) go into Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle.  I thought that he was hiding from his dad because he said, "Okay, he's gone."  To his other friend (also sneaking in to the movie), so I thought nothing of it, I had more important things to do (like call my dad).  So I call my dad and I see a woman walk by and she looked pissed, at about this time my dad picked up the phone so I told him that I needed to be picked up.  After I hung up with him the angry woman came back herding a group of 4 or 5 kids and she was saying, "Out of my theater, now!" and the kids were protesting saying that they did nothing wrong.  They got themselves kicked out and it turns out that there were more of them who had already got caught and they were already sitting outside.  So they all had to use thier cell phones (yes, they had cell phones, and they were "mini preps")) to call their parents.  I can imagine that their parents were none to pleased to have to come back to the theater after they just dropped off the "minis."  The moral of the story: don't try to sneak into movies at the theater, managers are scary when they are angry.

      Hiyi!  Guess what all!  I got my computer!  Although I don't have the internet set up in there yet, that will come soon!  (so this is me blogging for perhaps the last time from my parents computer!  ^_^  I have to give mad props to my bro though, he's the one who sank the deal...  (Don't know how he did it, but he did!)  I must say, the guy has his moments.

      Hiyi!  Well, I know it's been a while since I've updated, and there are a few of you who are probably waiting on the edge of your seats for news from my world.  (Yeah, sure.)  Well, let's see here... what has been going on?  Well, Thursday I went to see Anchorman (Very funny, you should get off your butt and see it if you haven't.) Friday I did nothing of much importance, Saturday I tested for my second degree red belt (don't know if I passed yet, I'll find out Thursday), Sunday I helped out in Sunday School, and then I came home and took a nap, Monday I went and saw Catwoman (Very cool movie btw), and then I spent the night at Claire where I got a huge head ache, and then today I spent all day over there.  Now I am home and have been for about 4 hours.  Hm... yeah... that's about it.
