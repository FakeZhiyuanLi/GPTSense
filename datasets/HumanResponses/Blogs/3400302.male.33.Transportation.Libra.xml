      Another day at the office selling bicycles at an online company, working in Britain has meant for the first time I am a bit bored by life.   Not that where I work is boring.. actually it's a riot!  I came to Discount Bicycles in January after seeing the ad for a web manager for 18,000 a year, (not much in London), I thought what the hell this will be a good way to learn.  And since we're based in the Mahatma Ghandi Industrial Estate in Brixton London, it also has amazing street cred!   Discount Bicycles is run by Henry Obuabang, a stocky black guy who is commited to his company and spends all hours in the office working, playing football or shagging hs blond girlfriend.   Henry's smart, a political liberal, ex-artist although his work is ... experimental.  He is the king of scam, like selling gizmos that the ad claimed, 'avoid paying telephone charges', that were 10p telephone routers with flashing LED lights sold for £50, he made 15,000 in a month.   At DB we don't rip you off, but employing a customer service manager is not a top priority.  The other staff are equally interesting  Stock manager: Darren Obuabang, Big black dude but a sofety at heart, and always late. He sells 'second hand' bikes on the side, and can help arranage for purchase of substances from a dodgy chemist he knows.  Head Mechanic: Matteus from Poland, always on time, a good mechanic and a nice guy.  Mechanic: Fabrizio, Skateboarder from Brazil, always short of money and late for work, talks for 8 hours non-stop and smokes plenty of weed.  Mechanic: Dean, Rasta from Brixton, short and skinny with long dreds, stoned all day and deals dope, heroine and crack on the side.  I update the website and take phone calls, chat to Henry and life ticks by pleasantly enough.   I'm living in a house share on Brixton Hill, nice enough people live here and its not all that bad. The cycle to work is 10 mins half of it through Brockwell park.   Better than my start to life back in the UK when I based myself in Deal and did nothing but play golf with my brother and use internet chat programs.  Jobs as a hotel bar man, a labourer for a mate and as a paperazzi photographer paid my way but only just!  My golf is getting good though, scored 86 on a round at Deal last weekend and took 40 quid off Mike!

      Seven years based in Taiwan came to an end last year, it’s time to recount this year’s excellent adventures.  The final two years in the ROC were given to Giant Bicycles, where after a first year of unbridled ambition the second year left me frustrated and mentally exhausted. Incapable of making breakthroughs at work the year was crowned with the magnificent success of the Art Street Car Free Festival.   Six months on Art Street were my best in Taiwan. This tiny street is a hubbub of ideas and creativity and it is impossible to fail to be infected by it, welcomed to the scene by Darin and so many others, even in my miserable state it harnessed my failing reserves of positive energy to help craft this upbeat event. But it was time to leave in 2001 and now in 2003 I was ready to move on.  Leaving Taiwan people asked me what I was going to do next, for the first time in my life I had no ideas, no girlfriend, no job and no plans. Cambodia was the place for me.  Touching down in Bangkok was the rekindling of a sense of excitement.   As it was almost midnight by the time I got to Bang Lamp Pu I checked into the crumbiest hostel just off Koh Sarn Rd for 80baht, the whine of the fan overhead barely taking the sting from the hot humid dampness of the tiny scruffy room, so I went out onto ‘The Road’ for a beer and to buy a ticket for tomorrow.  On one of the many covered alleys that lead off Koh Sarn I found a travel agent with the lights still on, and even though the staff were settling down in camp beds under mosquito nets they still sold me a ticket for 7am to Siam Reap in Cambodia. Arriving back at the same establishment just a few hours of sleep later I had passport photos done of me with that fashionable just out of bed hair style and not quite so fashionable eyes half closed look.  A typical Thai tourist coach full of travellers and familiar travelling tales, got me to Cambodia, where at the border town of Poipet we were transferred onto a very full mini bus. I travelled by this means for about 20km before deciding at a town where the road forks to Siam Riep to get off and make my own way to Battambang. The adventure begins.  First how do I get to the bus station in a town with no language skills, or map? Answer, the moto drivers… one took me with my bicycle and big back pack to the bus station.  The bus station in a small Cambodian town is a hive of activity; pick up trucks wait until they fill up with customers. So when I arrived I was overwhelmed with rival pick up gangs physically pulling me onto their trucks, after the usual bargaining I finally made it onto one, only to realise I had almost no local money. Of course the local black market is at the bus station too and soon I had converted 100US into many thousand Riel.   Arriving in Battambang it was the Moto drivers that again saved the day, taking me to a hotel that was quite pleasant.  Battambang is Cambodia’s second city but has a small town feel and the French Colonial architecture still dominates, very little traffic and overall seemed a pleasant place to hang out, so I approached my moto driver to show me around.  First request, I wanted some Yabba, an amphetamine pill that you chase down foil, and a bit of heroine.   He took me to a residential area of single storey bungalows and up an alley where in the pitch black, as there were no streetlights which only line the major roads, we knocked on a door of one.  A window shutter slid open and a doped up looking youth in his late teens peered out at us. By this time a small crowd of kids and adults had also gathered at the end of the alley chatting and pointing, ideas of police blackmail or crowd mugging drifted through my mind as I waited for the moto driver to conclude his negotiations.   It turned out that yabba was almost 2 dollars a hit; double the price of Phnom Penn, and there was no heroine. I tried to negotiate but the shutter just snapped shut. So changed my order from 10 yabba to two and left it at that.  Next I asked my guide to lead me to a source of ganja, and off we went. We stopped at a shantytown that had been built against a wall by the river. We knocked at one of the shanty hits and lifted the curtain door to see it a family eating dinner, an old vacant looking bearded man, his plump wife and several very dirty kids dressed in rags, were digging into some chicken.  My moto driver said something in Khmer and the old man of the family fished under the mat and pulled out a bush of long buds that must have been at least a kilo, and offered it to me.   I gestured that it was way too much and he gave me two massive buds that were to last me the whole holiday for two dollars.  With drugs sorted and feeling a little naughty my next request to my trusted guide was for a woman. He laughed and told me he knew of many fine girls.   The moto drivers English was excellent and I discovered he was aged 20 and completing high school so he could get into university. He had a girlfriend but had never had sex, and that the girls he was taking me to see were too expensive for him.  When we arrived at a seedy brothel and the mama took me into the room lined with unattractive looking girls, I told my driver no and we went onto the next place and finally a third where only one girl looked pretty so I asked for her and was surprised that the mama san would not allow me to pay her but demanded 15 dollars up front.  Back at my hotel I tipped the driver well and went into my room, the girl demanded that the lights were off, before she stripped and only then did I discover why I had to pay in advance, one side of her body was badly disfigured with a terrible burn, for a moment I was repulsed and withdrew and she hid herself in shame. I lit up a joint to calm down and after a few minutes trying to communicate began to get turned on, slapped on a condom and did the deed.  Post ejaculation I thanked her, tipped her and off she went, I lit up another joint and drifted to sleep considering the error of my ways, assuring myslf that refusing to have sex would have been an insult and that this country's problems are too great for me to solve.  Next day a ghastly journey over bumpy dirt roads in an old overcrowded coach put in Phnom Penn, the ultimate destination for single undersexed drug crazed ex-pats.
