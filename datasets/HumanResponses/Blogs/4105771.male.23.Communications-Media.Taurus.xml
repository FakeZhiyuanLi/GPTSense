      STUPID  I can’t stop thinking about you Yet you don’t think about me I can’t stop missing you Yet you don’t miss me  One minute I felt so special And now I feel stupid I guess there’s no one to blame Or maybe blame cupid  You left me just like that Just hanging in the air And right before I sleep There is so much pain to bear  So just bear the hurt Even if it cuts like a blade Because for the 2nd time I’ve been played

      Almost Perfect  From the moment you opened the door And stepped out of your place I was in awe of your beauty That it made my heart skip a pace  I took you to my house To meet my whole family The happiness in my eyes Because of you they clearly see  We’d be holding hands While walking thru the park Stopping for 5 seconds Just to kiss in the dark  It was so beautiful So real did it seem The sad part is I woke up And it was all just a dream

      Waiting  When will the day come? When will the sun shine? When will I have someone? To truly call mine  Someone to hug Someone to kiss Someone to constantly think about Someone to miss  When will that day come? So now I don’t know what I’m going to do But deep down inside I’m hoping that it’s you

      Well last night I was watching 40 days and 40 nights... I saw 3 elements in the movie 1) abstinence 2) sex/intimacy 3) chemistry it got me thinking..... Again damnit!!!!  what stuck in my head is the third one... Chemistry.. im sure we have been in relationships or dates wherein if you think about it, you really didn't share anything in common. Isn't it so different when you have someone who actually laughs at the same things that you do? You also share the same interests? Share the same outlook in life? Wherein maybe after being intimate with that person you can even watch TV together and talk about what you're watching ( not just sleep) the way you make each other "lambing" or cuddle... The way you look in each other's eyes.. So I would have to say that sex is a beautiful thing ( esp. When done the right way and with love involved) I believe though that chemistry gives us a different kind of fulfillment, I guess it makes us feel that there really is someone made for us.....

      Well I just got back from cagayan de oro for work, I hate traveling, we always have the occasional weird seatmate in the airplane who looks straight at your face and just stares at you and is probably trying to memorize your pores, we also have the baby who cries like there's no tomorrow..... Don't get me wrong I love kids to death but damn in a plane their cries are amplified like hell! There is one good thing about traveling, it really gives you time to think... You're sitting for about an hour to an hour and a half then you can just close your eyes and think/ponder/fantasize whatever you want to do so I though about this...  when we have a loved one but that person's heart belongs to someone else.. do we really mean it when we say that we just want that person to be happy even if its not with us?  do we really mean that when all that we think about is that person? when if it were possible, you would want her to be the first and last thing you see every single day...... that whenever you hear a cheesy song you think about the two of you in your own music video?( yes it is really corny but you have to admit we all do that) do you really mean it when... just holding her hand gives you butterflies?...... when every time your lips touch for that moment in time you dont care about anything else but how much your heart is beating full of love?.... whenever you're with her you never settle for mediocrity but always try to be the best that you can ever be......  whenever you're with her you always want to have even a bit of physical contact, whether it be your knees or elbows touching or just your fingers right beside hers, knowing shes that close relaxes and makes your heart smile?   well i would have to say yes, i would mean it because even if i do feel all of the above her happiness is still my first priority.... even if my heart would be crushed and torn apart.... her smile and happiness would always be what i really want........

      MAYBE  I thought I was going to be happy I thought I was going to feel love I was about to drop on my knees and thank the lord above  with you I felt so special but now I feel its not true what did it have to happen now when I’m so crazy about you  I’m so lost in the dark I don’t know what to do I think about you so much I cant stop missing you  so there is nothing else to do only wait and see because maybe in your heart *I can still see me *there's still a place for me  (i gave you guys two endings to choose from)

      HURT  Maybe you don’t know Maybe you don’t intend to But hurt my feelings You sometimes tend to do  Sometimes you don’t intentionally pick up & sometimes you don’t reply Believe me its hurts Enough to almost make my cry  Do you think I’m too sensitive? Do you think it’s too much? I guess that’s how it is When you care about someone so much  So bear it I guess Is what I’m going to do? Because no matter how much hurt? I’m still falling for you
