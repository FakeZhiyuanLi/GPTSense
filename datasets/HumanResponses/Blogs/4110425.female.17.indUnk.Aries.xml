        (09/08/  2004)  happy nation day to all of u. yeah.. sorry dear, cant accompany u to watch the NDP together. but well, at least when ndp was showing we were toking on the phone mah. heehee.. better than nothing rite? =P basically, i think tat the fireworks during ndp wasnt as goog as the firworks on sunday. hmm.. thought the fireworks during ndp will be more impressing. sad sad. well, anyway, i was toking to him even after ndp, coz we were watching singapore idol. even after SI, we were still toking. haha.. the longest chat.      back to SI, omg! some contestants simply juz dunno their limits.  -_-"  the guy who strip! yucks.. he only wore a yellow underwear after his strip. n a indian gal who actually qualified. the judges told her to change her image n coz of a sentence 'i will have a make over but not too much coz i like what i am noew' tat she said. Too bad, she was out (goodby) even she sang very good. n a guy came all the way from shanghai n guess wat? he sang very good, best man. but he is more suitable for singing in a opera. so, he was out. think he got high hopes for himself, coz he said he will be in the top 10, once he step out of the room, he cried, hugging gurmit. well, competitions are always like this. it might be cruel to some.
