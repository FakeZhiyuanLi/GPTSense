      im just sittin here waiting for a ride to go over lauren's. today is gonna be a really short day cause i woke up at like 1 o'clock. thats probably the latest i slept all summer yet. today pretty much consisted of me saying im bored and hungry, so i ordered from the bm deli, which was pretty good. now im off to lauren's and then around 530 or somethin i have bm basketball sign ups. i dont even know why i bother. but its me, i always end up getting involved with it one way or another and if i dont sign up people will say "omg why didnt you sing up, you should have". amanda and erin are at konobles today so im basically alone, which sucks. i soo need a vacation, away from people down here, idk how much more i can take. i wish i could go back to the carribean with a few of my friends and thats it. that was awsome, id have to say that was the best vacation i ever went on. this year im going to LBI nj with erin, amanda, and erin's parents, so hopefully that will go well and ill get a good vacation out of that away from my family. i honestly wouldnt even mind if i just went to a hotel for a couple days by myself as a vacation.. well i g2g to lauren's. write later.  *LoViNg Is NoT hOw u FoRgEt, BuT HoW u FoRgIvE...

      well, i just got back from my game bout an hour ago. we won thank god. it was a pretty good game i guess. im really tired now, and kinda bored. i wish i actually had a life, and at the rate im goin it doesnt look like im getting one any time soon. im gonna try to go to bed decently early tonight so i dont end up wakein up at 12 tomorrow. the part that sucks is that tomorrow is gonna be the same as today cuz amanda and erin are goin to konobles, and im stuck at home alone, with my family once again. i dont know how much more of this i can take. thursday is pretty much an open day and friday i have basketball practice at 430 to like 545 or somethin, idk. my coach keeps telling us we need to get into shape and by the end of the summer im hopefully gonna be in shape. yeah i think its pretty safe to say my life sucks...its way to confusing. im only 14 and already my life is a nightmare. well not a nightmare but still its pretty sucky. i mean compared to how things were before things are looking up. which is a good thing for me. well i need sleep and food before i pass out at my computer desk. write later.           Cryin doesnt always mean ur sad,just           like smilin doesnt always mean ur happy...                                                - molly

      this post is probably gonna be very short or very long. one or the other. so far today is a pretty boring day. i woke up ar like 12 and now im sittin here waiting for my aunt sophie to come home with wendys for me! hopefully today woant be as boring as it seems. i cant believe im still tired. hopefully today people will call me to do something, like lastnight. i basically sat in a car and drove around all night. itsthe closest i get to driving until im 16. i feel like going out to eat. but im broke, which is not unusual for me. i wish i worked a little more then every other weekend sometimes so i could make more money and not go through it like water. right now im watching "real world", its actually pretty decent this season. well i think im gonna get somethin to drink and end this post. write later.                                             - molly <3

      im back as you probably could tell... i was extremely bored so i decided to post again. my time is messed up on this blog... i gotta fix it sometime, ill get around to it tonight hopefully. i think im getting sick. i woke up with a sore throat and i'v been coughing all day. today sucks, not only do i not feel good, everyone is inside and no1 has called me except erin today and she had to go over her friends house like an hour ago. so im basically alone, with my family, shoot me now. i already went through this a couple days ago and i stayed in the house for about 4 hours and i started freaking out at people. as you could tell i dont have patience. wow the song im listeing to brings back memories... here without you by 3 doors down, good times. isnt it sad when people change completely and not in a good way, i could cry just thinking about it. well i guess this is just a lesson on not to live in the past, and to look ahead. if only i could take my own advice... i wanna do something tonight but no one is out. oh man, i forgot i have a game tomorrow at 8... well atleast its not a double header like last week. i almost killed myself at conditioning on saturday. all we did was run,run, and run. i think the part that really killed me was when i forgot to streach and my right leg cramped when we were doin suicides and i limped across the court. as much as i wanna play varsity next year and play, i hate running constantly, and then shooting foul shots and not having 60% from the foul line. im actually tired right now, but if i go take a nap now im not gonna sleep tonight, and it hate it when that happens. i feel like watching a movie. yesterday i saw "the notebook" omg that was good. ofcourse no guy is gonna say that it was good cuz it was more of a love story. id actually like to read the book, only if i had time, and that is one thing i dont have this summer, time. im not gonna say what the movie was about cuz not everybody saw it, im just gonna leave it as "the best love story of the summer". it actually reminded me of the movie "sweet home alabama". okay, ill shut up about the movie now. im hoping someone will call me sometime soon to do something tonight. i dont think anyone knows how bad i wanna drive. hopefully my brother will still give me his durango... im just keepin me fingers crossed. i still cant believe hes getting married. og my brother of all people... ahha thats actually funny, but im still happy for him and kim. wow this is really long for one of my 1st posts. well im gonna go and find something to do. write later.

        well tonight i had basketball practice. i didnt do bad once again for a change. i dont think i ever sweat that much in my life haha. the part that sucks is that we have it again tomorrow night at 6:30, with just senior high. im gonna have no life once the season starts. jeez... the things i do for basketball. im really tired tonight. i wish i could find somethin to do cuz im bored outta my mind. now that i think about it last year around this time, i wouldnt even be home right about now ahah. i was usually playin basketball up the courts or walking around town. now my life consists of going out ocasionally, going to basketball about 3 times a week and going on the computer to talk to people. wow what a life. i guess i really should complain that much cuz i do get out sometimes. i really like this song (kanye west ft. jay-z - never let me down). too bad it doesnt refer to my life. i hope the beaver meadow league starts soon, that way i dont have to deal with this house anymore. people just drive me crazy, and its not just my family. its times like this where i just wanna say thank you so much mr. keiper for scheduling basketball practice. haha. i dont want school to start. how about today i got a letter in the mail from hafey saying that the heels of the shoes for the girls can  ONLY BE   ONE INCH !! im pissed, cuz how the hell am i gonna find a shoes with a one inch heel, seriously, commen sense. i refuse to wear flat shoes, i mean im pretty short the way it is. i dont really wanna actually show people how short i am. ugh... i just gotta keep thinking "molly your there for basketball". well im gonna go talk to people on mirc and aim. write later           If it never really was what you  seen  in me   Why did you say you  believed  in me   Its all because of you my  security    Its driving me  crazy  baby   If it  never  really was what you had for me   Why did you say that you  wanted  me,  needed  me   If it never really was what you  ment  for me   Tell me...                        - mario winans                               *never really was*

      what a night, or should i say day? lauren slept over lastnight, it was pretty fun actually. we decided to go to the movies to see sleepover, which pretty much blew, but hey atleast i got an oreo creme blast outta it. we pretty much spent the night on the computer, and then we watch comedy central which was hilarious... omg. then we attempted to play gamecube while we were on a sugar high, and we sucked. ahah. i actually got pissed off and threw the controller, and then lauren took over from there. i think the next game i wanna buy for it is some game involving huns, so i can take out my anger. all i have is water powered jet packs and a vacum that sucks up ghosts, (wow). *sigh* i have a game today at 7... anybody wanna go? and then you can watch us get killed by weatherly cuz WE SUCK! and i swear if i get put as guard again im gonna die. i think the marian game scared me for life. ever since then i dont like bringin the ball up against big scary girls (*cringes at the thought*). well im gonna get dressed or somethin, who knows. write later.

      well, i guess i dont have as much free time as i always say i do, since i havnt posted in 3 days again. lets see... wed.i went to blaise's and brooke's birthday party at mt. laurel, that was fun, i met a lot of people & i went to the guys saullo serany games with ash and then we went for a walk. yesterday, i went up ash's and we played vball and basketball with a few people that aimee had over and josh that ashley had over. then lastnight i ahd basketball practice, it wasnt too bad, we did a lot of stuff to get into shape, and my legs kill today. then right after practice i went back up ash's (actually it didnt happen in thet order, but you get the idea). today, well today is another busy day, i think goin to play bball with lauren and jon, or somethin like that. i talked to suzanne yesterday, and i think i'm gonna play the summer league after all. oh well. i mean i wanted to play, i just didnt wanna deal with the people. i guess i'll stick it out and do w/e. well im goin. write later.  itsz scary tO thiink hOw diiffErEnt yur liifE wOuld bEE iif yuh nEvEr mEt that pErsOn that chanqEd [| E v E r y t h ii n q |]                                                      - molly

      wow, i havnt posted in a while. i think im gonna recap my life for the past 3 days. lets see. on saturday, well i had work and then i went over the caputo's house for about an hour or so, that was actually fun. sunday i had my uncles yearly 4th of july party, theres not really anything interesting to say about that. yesterday, well i attempted to play mini golf i ended up wit a 64? i think on an 18 hole corse, wow im pretty pathetic. 3 year olds could play better then me. but i was pretty happy that my ball didnt go into any form of water. i think they are there to just get people pissed off when they have to get their golf club and go digging in the water for their ball and end up finding 10 different colored balls in the process. i did come in 3rd tho. but for some reason i cant remb. anything i did lastnight. i know i went over laurens house, but after that its all a blur. idk, i think i came on the computer... oh well if i spoke to anybody and said anything that was stupid or physcotic, forget it. today, i ahve another double header... and everyone is away on vacation. so im probably gonna be playin more.joy. well im goin. write later.                                                       - molly

      i got back from practice it was actually really fun. the only reason i think that was cuz we didnt really do anything except shooting drills and we went over a few new plays when your inbounding the ball (not like anyone really cares). im really bored, i wanna do somethin productive. i need to start goin to the Y again so i can get back into shape. ya know i wonder if anyone actually reads this... oh well. oh man im in a really bad mood the past two days it isnt even funny. i think i still kinda am. im not even gonna get into why i am cuz my whole life is stupid. the only thing that actually makes sense is basketball, which is making me sound like i have no life except basketball, and right about now i dont. tomorrow im making cookies for the 4th or july when i go down my uncles in drums. thats gonna be fun. oh man i wish i could drive. i cant get outta this house anymore. im so pissed off it isnt even funny, and i dont even exactly know why. well im goin upstairs to me room, to vent so i dont hurt someone. write later.

        sorry i havnt posted in a few days. the past two nites havnt been the greatest. i think its because of my father. everything i do is wrong. i feel like i cant even breathe without permission from him. i dont even know how i feel. im not really mad, im just really annoyed with my dad right now. im so close to gettin grounded, so i gotta watch what i say and what i do for a lil. i have a feeling that im gonna have no life because of what my dad is doin. i get soo pissed just thinkin about it. anyway, yest. i had my game. i had to play two games in a row cuz not all the girls for sergios showed up and melanie asked if i would play. i had 9 points, which wasnt bad. i wasnt shootin too much yest at either of my games. thats not necessarily a bad thing. my 2nd i sucked soo bad. idk wtf was up wit my calv muscles but everytime i would jump they would like pull and it would hurt really bad. there fine today but it basically fucked up how i was playin. ill do better tomorrow. i know i will. i guess those are the reasons im in the mood that im in. i shoudl probably go call roman and see what hes doin cuz i havnt talked to him in a while so im goin. write later.       - molly         *-_You Make My Life So Convenient For Me _-*     * Love You Roman*

        well its offical my life sucks. lastnite i walk in and got yelled at for about an hour about how by my father, about how i dont tell him everything im doing and stuff. basically it was all stupid stuff. theres more to the story but i cant fuckin take it anymore. well once oct. comes my brothers movin into his new house and then im allowed to go down there. oh yes and to top all of this, im not allowed in noells car until it gets fixed. oh yeah, and i dont think i mentioned that im not gettin a cell phone anymore becuase instead my parents lowered my mins on my phone! ahhhhhhhhhhh. *sigh*. my brother also found out about me and roman from romans mom! and then ofcourse he comes home and tells my aunt sophie. ugh... i dont wanna go to work tonite cuz im gonna hear about it. atleast its an escape from the freakin house. i was soo mad lastnite, you couldnt even imagine. 4 more years, then im finally 18 and i can do what  I  want. well atleast roman is home. i saw danny and chad lastnite. they say hes "dying". he has a virus from what im hearing. i should probably call him before work today. unless this talk with my dad doesnt take 4587875 hours. im so not looking forward to that. i still need a shower, oh well i dont care, ill get one before i go to work. well id say this is one of my longest posts in a while. i dont feel good and im hungry. i dont wanna eat though, cause if i do then ill get sick. im gonna go find somethin to do. write later hopefully, if im still alive after this talk with my father.            If I never see your face   If wings take you away from me   And tomorrow never happens, baby   If the world comes tumbling down   And crumbles all around us   Fate turns cruel   You're on your knees   So desperate for one truth   Know that I have loved you      7.31.04 (2 weeks, 1 day)    I Love You Roman           - molly

         well yesterday was somethin alright. from the time i woke up until the time i went out with noelle, i was gettin screamed at for the stupidest stuff, you couldnt even imagine. im not even gonna get into it, but it turned out that i wasnt allowed to sleep over noelles cuz i had a friend over when my dad was gettin ready for the wedding, i dont know, it was somethin gay like that. so instead i ate supper and then noelle picked me up and we went out. we decided to pick up justin tarone then and we drove around wit him. i saw a few people lastnight, i saw sateach, the moyers, and tresckow people haha. it turns out that noelle slept over here and we ordered pizza from papa johns at like 1130 haha. i ate like 5 pieces cuz i was pissed off at people and i was really hungry. but newayzz. today i have to go to my sisters play... enough said. my parents said they dont think im gonna make it home in time to go with noelle to the mcadoo games. i have a feeling im gonna be on my cell phone talkin to people so i dont loose my sanity. all im sayin is we better go out to eat. i wanna get good food outta this trip. this doesnt make sense to me. she never came to one of my basketball games, not one, and i have to go to this. oh well, god forbid i say anything to my parents about it, theyll have my head. well im gonna go and try to get my cd player to work so i dont have to listen to oldies on the way down to bloomsburg. write later.  - molly

        well today was a pretty good day i guess, besides the fact that i was half dead from waking up at 8 0'clock this morning. the seniors took all the freshman and that to go order our sneakers. there pretty nice, white jordans, $79, not too bad for jordans. after we ordered them we went to american eagle and a few other places then we went to red robin for lunch. that was good. when i came home i was bored, thats nothin new. then i went for a ride wit noelle and then we went to her house. which pretty much consisted of jeremy yellin at me to walk on his abck and when im walking outta the house, him grabbing my leg and not letting me leave. ahahha. im hopefully doing somethin tomorrow night. i hope ill see roman and lauren cuz their both leaving for the shore saturday :(( im gonna miss them. well i guess my night is pretty much coming to a close. so im goin to say goodnight. write later.   -tHe WoRsT Is OvEr nOw, &amp; We CaN BrEaThE aGaIn-   - seether ft. amy lee ~ broken   iLuRoman       - molly
