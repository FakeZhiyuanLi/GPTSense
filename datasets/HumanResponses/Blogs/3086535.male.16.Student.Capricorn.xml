      I was just thinking, you know what would be cool? An order in karchan. Like, a sect known as the way of peace, but not the way of peace. Someone like the SoK, the Saviors of Karchan. They could be vigilantes who want to throw down both the Knights and The evil people, set themselves up as the only power in Karchan. It would need some oldies though, some really good rp'ers and people willing to actually rp. It could be fun.

      I just judged a duel. I voted for the guy who didn't win, I guess it was two to one. *shrug* I guess each to his own opinion. You know what, the enemy of your enemy is your friend! Hahaha.

      Hmm, not much is happening here. Hanging out with Elora in Kar, but I felt like writing on here too. My great uncle died, I'm going to his funeral tomorrow. I hate to sound like an emotionless jerk, but I can't say that I am really sad. I am sad that my mom is sad, but I didn't know him, I've only met him like twice in my life. *sighs* Well, not much else is new, kar is getting pretty boring. Erm, what to do. I'll make a nice picture out of / \ things. /                  /_|\_Does that look like a star? No, well, use your imagination, make it whatever you want. *sniffles* EDIT - it moves them to the left, so, it obviously doesn't look like a star anymore. *cries*

      Jardel hefts his halberd off of his shoulder, gripping it tightly with one hand. He swings his shield around, hooking it over his back. He takes a position some feet from Kusari, taking a few practice swings at rocks and the such. As he does so he speaks to her, "You are a knight of Karchan? I hope to join your ranks soon." After warming up a bit he closes the distance between himself and Kusari, quickly coming up on her left side. He tosses the halberd forward a little, letting it slide forward in his hand until he is gripping the wooden handle near the bottom. Jardel stops about seven feet from Kusari, just out of range of swords and the like, but his eight foot halberd along with his arm length should easily be able to reach Kusari. He decides that for his first attack he will go in simply, to the point. He steps one foot forward and swings the halberd up over his head, fulling extending his hand he brings it crashing down for her shoulder, the axe blade side facing Kusari.  Kusari notices Jardel's chest muscles twitch and is alerted that he will attack. She sees the weapon swing and ducks down into a forward, seconds before what would have been a beheading. Rolling to her feet, the Silver Knight rises inches before Jardel. She raises her for arm to block out a swing of the mighty weapon before answering, "Yes, I am." In a lithe movement of her left leg, she hooks it behind Jardel. The arm blocking his arm pushes forward, using the man's weight against him to destroy his balance. She quickly raises her longsword, before thrusting down knowing that Jardel must act quickly risking either a deadly blow or allowing himself the vulnerability of a fall.  Jardel allows himself to fall backwards, knowing the longsword would do too much damage if he tried to regain his balance. He falls backwards and as he falls his hand finds his double-bladed battle-axe in the belt loop at his side. He pulls it free with one hand and continues pulling it straight across his chest as he falls, trying to deflect Kusari’s sword tip with the flat side of the blade. He pulls it a little too quickly and the top of the axe slams into the side of the sword, sending it a little to the side but still on it’s downward path into his shoulder. The sword tip digs in as soon as his body slams into the ground. Jardel groans lightly and grabs the flat of the blade with his gauntleted hand. He tugs it free of his chain and plate armor, thankful he decided to wear it. Jardel rolls to the side, not an easy task to accomplish in all that armor. He slowly stands and inspects the wood quickly, the tip having only dug in a little, more pain coming from the ringlets digging into his flesh. He takes hold of the battle-axe with both hands and moves around until his halberd is between himself and Kusari. He moves at her in a pace a little more than a quick walk. Once upon the halberd he hooks his foot under the wooden pole and gives it a hard kick upwards, sending it at Kusari as a distraction. He then rushes her, swinging the axe in a downward angle at Kusari’s thigh.   Kusari moves to dodge the halberd, her agile form slinking past it. Pain suddenly explodes in Kusari's leg before in goes numb and crushed armor slides off. Her lips mouth an assortment of colorful words but she throws herself out of the way to avoid being hit yet again. One of the area's many stones provides enough support for the lady knight to pull herself up with a bit of a limp. Sweat trickles into Kusari's face and she wipes it away, watching Jardel through wary eyes. To attack him up close would be suicide with her useless leg and give him too much of an advantage. She throws her beloved longsword out of battle before pulling the weapon favored by her race. She places an arrow on the quiver quickly, ending the pause in action. The elf draws the bow and fires, but not only once. Years of obsessive training reveal themselves as numerous arrows take flight on a collision course with Jardel and the area around him should he try and dodge. Kusari stops wielding the ivory-handled, elven longsword in her right hand.  Jardel tightens his grip as he feels his battle-axe make contact, the handle vibrating as it ripes through flesh and armor. He watches her slink off and prepares to follow when he sees her unleash a hail of arrows. He drops the battle-axe and grabs at the shield on his back. Not being able to move as quick or as flexible as the elf he pulls out the shield as the first arrow digs into the plate armor on his chest. He swings the shield into position, but not before another arm sinks into his arm. He braces the large kite shield, allowing it to take the brunt of the assault of arrows. As soon as he is sure the attack has stopped he grasps the arrow in his chest and pulls it out with a moan. The bow that launched the arrow must have been a powerful one, undoubtedly crafted by elves. The arrow passed completely through his chain and plate armor, striking into his chest. He then pulls the arrow from his arm, a likewise situation. He draws out from a scabbard at his side a short broadsword. He quickly moves to the stone Kusari hides behind, the adrenaline pumping through him the only thing keeping him going. He slams the sword against the side of the stone, shooting sparks down on to the high grass around it. He continues past her and strikes another stone nearby, producing more sparks. He does this repeatedly, the sparks all quickly eat up the dry grass, allowing flames to surround Kusari. Jardel fills the meadow with fire, strategically lighting fires around the rocks forming a circle around Kusari. He backs off to watch what will happen.  Kusari panics thinking perhaps magic, the one thing she fears, was used. She limps forward to meet fire, behind her there is fire, everywhere! Fire! Kusari grabs her sword and bow as the flames close in around her. Her mind is fogged by fear. She braces herself, running blindly towards the area where the meadow meets the river. Her body is licked by flames and the smell of burnt flesh fills the air. On the moist ground she collapses, safe from the flames. She breathes a sigh of relief, but without fear to fuel her, she has not the energy to battle...

      Destiny flutters out to the middle of the clearing, landing softly in the blades of grass. The area hasn't been keep too well, and the tiny pixie disappears among the foliage except for the tips of her wings. You see them twitch slightly, a sure sign that she is ready to begin. Destiny reaches into her sack for a sheet of paper and her trusty paintbrush. She chews delicately on the end, trying to decide on the best way to start this duel. Her eyes light up as it comes to her. Her paintbrush begins flying over the paper, hands moving as if with a mind of their own. She giggles softly as she knows this is probably most predictable for her, but it wouldn't be a duel for the little pixie without her precious. As her fingers add a few last details to perfect the drawing, she glances in Tivon's direction, hoping the serious mage appreciates her artwork. She reaches into her pouch at her waist, retrieving a tiny handful of the pixie essence that gives her the power to work her magic. Sprinkling it gently upon the artwork, she covers it entirely, then balls the paper up. She gives the ball a little heave, and you watch as it easily covers the distance to Tivon, landing a few feet infront of him. This pixie has a mighty powerful arm! As you watch ball land, it begins to unfurl back to its original flat shape. A few moments pass, and you begin to think the poor pixie's magic must have fizzled. Poor pixie. Then a sound reaches your ears. It sounds like a trumpet, but it couldn't be, as trumpets in themselves are not very dangerous items. Your eyes stay glued to the paper, knowing that this is the source of the sound. Suddenly, a pink tube rises from the white, rectangular hole. It twists this way and that, almost as if scenting the air. You shake your head in disbelief, and close your eyes. When you open them, there before you is a massive elephant. And not just any elephant, a big, pink, fluffy one! It lets out a loud trumpet, bellowing its fierceness. The elephant looks around the clearing, wondering who she has been summoned to destroy. A little voice floats on the breeze, calling out, "Tivon, serious mage." The pink beast seems to nod, eyes finding Tivon and staying glued on him. Ele begins to bounce on its bum, a sound that can only be taken for a padoderm chuckle emitting from its snout. She moves toward her target, her arse large and in charge, intent on smooshing Tivon into....a mage-like pancake....or crepe....or just really flat thing....  Tivon doesn't wait for Destiny to get into position, he begins his strategy instantly. Pulling a small, white orb from his robe he holds it up in front of himself. He looks at it lovingly and it seems that he must have a strong bond with this thing. He throws the orb at Destiny, it seems Tivon must have a strong arm as well. The orb flies through the air and unsuspectingly multiplies as it soars at her. The thousands or orbs seem to shrink as the fly, turning pixie sized. The continue right through Destiny, each one zipping through her. As they come out it can be seen that they are no longer white but have a multitude of colors swirling inside of them. They return to Tivon, passing into his body. As they do they transfer the stolen magic to his body, filling him with power. He grins knowingly, now understanding Destiny's specialty. He awaits her attack and when Ele starts to come for him he decides to put this new magic to test. Tivon Stilfles a laugh as Destiny continues to refer to him as the "serious mage", but focuses as he begins the spell. Not having any paper on hand he picks up a piece of bark from amist the garbage around the pond and draws on it with a quill he retrieved from the folds of his robes. He does not produce any pixie dust, but omany orbs flow out from his again, all still swirling with colors. One in particular moves over the bark and a powder drops from it. As it does so the colors begin to fade inside the orb. Tivon tosses the bark out in front of him and waits to see what happens. A tiny squeak sounds over the pond, but the noise that Ele is making drowns it out. Just as Ele comes close to Tivon a tiny mouse scurries up the elephant's side. As soon as Ele sees the mouse it lets out a loud toot! and takes off across the field and through the gorge. Tivon points to Destiny and the mouse, which had lept from Ele before she ran, moves towards her. As it comes into range of Destiny it can be seen that this must be what Tivon drew, it is no normal mouse. The mouse lunges at Destiny, seeming much like a tiger or wolf to the tiny pixie. In the air it opens it's mouth revealing fangs. This must be a vampiric mouse!  Destiny blinks as the tiny orbs pass through her, a rare seen expression coming to her face. A frown pulls at her tiny lips as her hands unconciously fly up to cover her tiny frame, a feeling of violation quaking her little body to its core. She trembles at the exposing, and glances down to make sure she isn't left naked. Her thoughts leave her Ele, as she tries to regain control of this situation. She glares at the theiving mage, realizing she will have to be her worse opponent now....herself. She sees her precious depart out of the corner of her eye, but her attention is trained on the fuzzy creature heading her way. As the mouse makes its leap, Destiny pushes off the ground, flittering up into the sky to get away from little creature. She shudders slightly at the sight of the vampiric rodent trying to leap and sink its vicious little fangs in her tender skin. The little pixie knows she must destroy this abomination, and reaches into her sack for a pre-drawn picture of a toothpick. Adding a bit of her sparkly dust, the paper disappears and leaves her with a pixie-size stake. Working quickly and deftly, she plunges down toward the mouse, thrusting the toothpick at its little heart. It squirms a few moments, in its last death throes, as the pixie wipes a tear from her eye. She hates to bring physical pain, or death, to such soft and cuddly creatures. She takes a deep breath to steal her nerve, knowing she may have to do it again very soon. She spins around to face Tivon, a scowl forming on her tiny features. She reaches into her sack, her eyes never leaving the mage, and retrieve a clean sheet of paper. Her hands begin to work their magic yet again, covering the sheet with a seldom used picture. As she adds the last line to her artwork, she reaches into her pouch for more of her pixie dust. Apply a liberal amount to the paper, a little POOF! is seen. As the cloud of...stuff....clears, you see the little pixie, which you know you should. What you don't expect to see, but can quite clearly, is a large mouth floating beside her. She crosses her arms over her chest as the mouth open to reveal razor-sharp, revolving, metallic teeth. It emits a sound similar to a blender, which is an item not found in this world but is used to liquify food. The crazy mouth clomps it teeth a few times, sparks flying from its deadly dentures. With a barely perceivable nod of the pixie's head, the mouth shoots forward. It's target? Tivon. It's intent? Well, that is too gruesome to describe.....  Tivon watches Destiny stake his poor little mouse and waits for her next attack. While waiting he searches around and finds a few more pieces of bark. As soon as he sees the mouth he giggles and cringes at the same time, the mouth a funny sight while still extremely dangerous. He begins to draw on his piece of bark, working quickly. He is done drawing soon, he must have drawn something simple. Another orb releases its magic on to the bark. This one Tivon throws directly at the oncoming mouth. As it flies through the air it makes the transition from a piece of bark to a metal pipe. The pipe soars into the mouth, sticking right inbetween two of the teeth. As the pipe gets more twisted and stuck in the teeth they slow down, the whole mechanism jamming. Tivon begins to furiously scribble on the next piece of bark, drawing wildly on it, he digs deep into the caverns of his imagination. Again, another orb releases it magic and Tivon tosses the orb at Destiny. Coming up right off the piece of bark a ghastly ghoul floats upward, looking like nothing more than smoke, but a figure within a cloud of smoke. It floats at Destiny with one hand stretched outward. As it moves towards her the air temperature around Destiny drops, cooling down. No one can know for sure, but the ghoul gives off the impression that it is reaching not for Destiny but for her very soul, threatening to steal it from her very body. Can anybody live without a soul? Maybe, maybe not. The ghost moves within grasp and plunges his large hand at Destiny, he moves to pass his hand right into her chest.  Destiny scowls yet again, possibly a new look for her, as she watches her opponent mimick her own movements for a second time. As she watches the mage prepare to attack her vicous mouth, she prepares for her next defense. Reaching into her pack for a new sheet, she holds her paintbrush ready. As her mouth is quickly defeated and Tivon begins a new picture, the little pixie grabs a handful of her pixie dust to use once her own picture is complete. As the bark is thrown and the transperent evil soars in her direction, the little mage can only blink at first, feeling the dropping in temperature. Her paintbrush begins to fly over the paper, almost before Destiny realizes she has begun to draw. In a matter of seconds, the picture is complete and the pixie dust is administered. The paper disappears and a man of the cloth is left in its place. The priest begins to chant words of priestly things, quickly excersing this demon. The ghoul begins to fade as the priestly fellow chants louder and faster. As the ghost reaches Destiny, it fades completely from sight, passing not into the little pixie, but into the next life. The pixie sighs, wiping sweat from her brow caused by the close-call. She graciously thanks the priest, accepting a rushed communion, before sending back to his church. She dusts her hands together, grinning slightly at the turn of events. She quirks a delicate brow in thought, wondering what would be the best next attack. You almost see the lightbulb appear over her head as an idea strikes her. She reaches into her sack, knowing she has a picture already drawn of this next creature. Her fingers fly over her artwork, finally locating the right one. Her grin grows brighter as she reaches for her magical powder. The tiny pixie grabs a pinch of the stuff, knowing little will be needs, and sprinkles it on her artwork. She quickly folds the paper into triangle shaped object and gives it a toss. The paper floats on the air, landing near Tivon, but more importantly, near the trees, garbage, and bark he has been relying so heavily upon. As it lands on the ground, the paper vanishes, leaving a very large, very mean looking dragon in its place. The dragon sneezes once, a little pixie dust caught up its nose, and fire shoots out of its snout, covering the wooded area in flame. It sneezes again, covering the garbage and bark as well. Soon the area is a light with the fire, destroying any items to be used to draw on, and making an escape route quite dangerous, if it would even be possible. The pixie flutters up above the inferno, and waves cutely to Tivon. She gives a high-pitched whistle, and the dragon turns his fiery eyes on his target. It begins to lumber toward Tivon, snorting flames from its mouth and tossing its tail back and forth to black its back. Tivon better hurry.....or he could be......flambayed.....or at least burnt-crispy....  Tivon blinks as the big dragon turns his resources into ash. Luckily, Tivon pulls a few thistle leaves from his sack. Not exactly bark or paper, but they will do. He quickly sets to drawing before the dragon turns to him. At first his mind is filled with the image of a knight, probably the best thing to kill a dragon, but before he draws one he gets a great idea. He finishes up his drawing and coats it with magic from an orb, then tosses the leaf on to the ground in front of him, then turns and backs away. His leaf poofs! and bam, there is a dragon standing there. This is no mere dragon, this happens to be a golden queen dragon. She takes off over the mountains and Destiny's dragon, a typical male, takes off into the sky wanting to impress the lady dragon. Tivon flashes a grin to Destiny and thinks over what he should draw last. Tivon grins, a great idea filling his head. Destiny's imiginary light bulb pops over Tivon's head, such a great idea it is. He draws slowly, taking his time. One of the many orbs releases its magic over the leaf before Tivon drops it. Up from it come many little pixies, all grinning and fluttering, like nice little pixies. All of them are female pixies but one. They take off and zip over to Destiny, all the girl pixies immediately begin to do her hair, put make up on her, all girly type things. The male pixie hovers a few feet away, a most studly pixie, he must be a prince or something. It seems the other pixies think Destiny a princess or something. The male pixie flutters up to Destiny and takes her hand in his, softly applying a kiss to it. He flashes her a sexy smile and says, "Come, lets go have some fun. Forget this duel, you do not wish to fight, do you?" As he speaks one of the female pixies reaches for Destiny's paintbrush, trying to inconspicuously remove it from her grip.  Destiny watches Tivon closely, almost able to see the light bulb appear. She grins to herself, knowing the joy of the great idea. She watches as the mage pulls out some leaves, and shakes her head realizing her magic is all he knows now. She can't help but smile as her male dragon is typical to his gender and departs after the pretty female. She waves quickly to him, hoping he behaves himself, then turns to her opponent. Her jaw drops as she sees the multitude of pixies heading her way. Her grin is broad and bright, having seen so few of her fellow winged creatures as of late. She allows them to primp and pamper, too happy to realize they could mean her harm. She giggles and twirls, showing them their handy-work. As the gorgeous male approaches, she is at a lost for words and thoughts. But something keeps nagging in the back of her head. She worries her bottom lip trying to remember, as her eyes stay glued to the pixie god infront of her. She extends her hand to him, blushing slightly at his words. As she is about to nod, she feels a tiny hand reaching for her other, paintbrush wielding hand. She blinks, and turns to the little pixie girl who would dare to retrieve her brush. She glowers slightly to the little imp, shaking her head disapprovingly, as pixies never steal from their own kind. The offending pixie is so ashamed to be caught in such an act, she flutters off quickly. Destiny turns to the male pixie, frowning at his intentions. The male pixie too is embarassed for what he helped to do, and gathers up his harem for a quick retreat. As they disappear from sight, Destiny turns her eyes on Tivon, flashing a brilliant grin. "Aye, thank goodness that is over. Please give me my magic back. Oh, and a good duel, if I do say so myself. *giggles*"

      Oh, I'm bored, dueling Destiny right now and it's her turn. I enjoyed the duel, thought it was rather fun. She's on her final defense, so, erm yeah. Lets see, I flipped out on my friend today, she gets me really angry. She's just so.....Argh! Makes me want to hit something. So how are you? I listened to like the whole lot of that CD by William Hung, the guy from American Idol. I found it on the web and listened to the first couple of songs. They were hilarious! *cackles* Just great. Anyway, I'm out now, I'm bouncing, got to leave you alone.

      Karchan is weird. Someone said to me, and I quote,"If Karn has the key to the room of lost souls then they aren't really lost are they, they're in that room." (not really quoted, hehe) And he's right. I know, you think I'm stupid now, it's not the physical sense. I know that, I just wanted to mess with you. If you don't know what Karn is, good. You know, from now on I am going to refer to you as 'the wall'. You see, typing right now is like talking to a wall, I just confirmed that with someone. I also confirmed that most of what I typed about the China is wrong, so ha! I love Pie. You heard me, pie. Pie, Pie, everywhere pie....Big pie, little pie, green pie, red pie. Enough about pie. What are you like, wall? I suppose you are sitting in your nice little chair, reading this...pie....Mmm, I'm sorry, did I actually type that? Woosta! Art is stupid. I have an art class and I don't like it. We were using these cool quill pens and I doodled all clase. You see, I was forced into art by an over zellous(sp) guidance teacher. She thought I should take it in place of a study hall, and so I am in art. It is quite boring and my artistic skills rival that of a three year olds'. So, enough about art. Did you know that A=1/2bh? Of course you did, you're smart. At least, I'm going to consider you smart from now on. I don't feel like explaining things to you. Well, I am going to leave you now. I know, you want me to type more, you are craving the words that are flowing from my keys, but alas! I want to go sleep. Think about that, I cherish sleep more than I do sustaining your need for my thoughts put into words. If I were you looking at me I would be frozen over from the coldness coming off me. You know what they say, It's a fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder.

      I'm posting again, even though I shouldn't. I just can't control myself. I thought this would be stupid, a feminine, girlyish thing. I'm starting to like it. If I combine the two things I just said, I'm a girl! *eeps!* What can I do? I think this is a way for me to release stress, or something like that. Really I just enjoy my thoughts for the world to see. Actually, no one will see this, I've given no one the URL. *cackles* Quite sly of me really. The real question is, how did you get here!? I give up, I don't care. You're here because you're here, nothing I can do about that. I was reading this book the other day, more like a short story really, called Twelve Angry Men. I didn't like it, is wasn't good in my opinion. What does my opinion matter, I'm not a book reviewer. I know, there is a word for them, but I'm drawing a blank. Anyway, do you know anything about 2nd century China? I'm very much into history, so I'll give you a little history lesson. (All of this I learned from a video game. It is true though, the game had an encyclopedia in the options) So, the Han dynasty, long the center of power in China, is falling apart from internal affairs. A sect known as the way of Peace arrises, threatening to throw down the imperal court. The Imperal Army answers the call to arms, such men as Cao Cao, Lui Bei, Sun Jian, and Yun Shao. These men succeed in throwing down the mystical leaders of the Yellow Turbans, (A nickname given to the way of peace warriors due to the yellow turbans they wore, duh). As they were doing this an evil man named Dong Zhuo took over the imperal court, influencing the young emperor easily. The army, under Yuan Shao, went to throw him down. At the battle of hao Lu gate, or some gate like that, they came across the man named Lu Bu. (a dorky name, yes) Who was the greatest warrior of that Era. None could defeat him, and in the end the army was forced to retreat. Lu Bu was an evil man and lived to fight. A woman convinced him that Dong Zhuo was ignoring him and Lu Bu killed him. Lu Bu then retreated to his castle with his men. Cao Cao held land in the northern part of the Great plains of china, having his own territory. Knowing Lu Bu would eventually be a problem he, along with Lui Bei, attacked Lu Bu's castle. They could not defeat his officers but eventually took the castle. You see, Lu Bu miss treated his men and they surrendered to Cao Cao, allowing him access to the castle. Lu Bu was executed, thus dies the greatest warrior of that Era. Lui Bei, along with his blood Brothers Guan Yu and Zheng Fei head back to their castle, but find they have been betrayed. Attacking Lui Bei's cousin at Cheng du, they take the land and set themselves up with land. In the mean time Sun Jian finds the imperial Seal in a well on the way home. He is attacked by pirates but succeeds in throwing them down. He is betrayed at Yu Jing but retakes his land. So the three kingdoms show themselves, Wu under Sun Jian, Wei under Cao Cao, and Shu under Lui Bei. Cao Cao moves to defeat Yuan Shao's much larger force and succeeds in doing so by taking an important supply depot. Guan Yu serves Cao Cao for some time before returning to Lui Bei. Each of the three Kingdoms fight various battles to become the supreme dynasty in China, but none ever succeed in doing so. Guan Yu is eventually captured by Sun Jian. Refusing to serve him Guan Yu is executed. Lui Bei and Zheng Fei vow to destroy Wu, but a few years later Lui Bei falls ill and dies shortly after. Lui Bei's strategist, Zhang lang (sp) is considered the smartest man of his time. He successfully helps Shu win many battles even against great odds. In the end his is extremely close to his vision of supreme victory, but falls ill and dies. Cao Cao also falls ill and dies, leaving his son in charge. Sima Yi, Cao Cao's strategist, moves into the background, trying to hide himself from the limelight. Eventually Shu and Wu's forces fall weak due to internal affairs. Sima Yi comes forward and challenges Cao Cao's grandson to a duel, the winner taking over the imperial Mandate. Sima Yi wins, and so falls the Wei dynasty. Sima Yi dies, passing his legacy to his son, Sima Yan. His son forces both the weak Shu and Wu empires to surrender thier land, Shu first, then Wu. So all three Dynasties fall, allowing Sima Yan's Jin Dynasty to become the supreme power in China. In later years it becomes known as the Romance of the three kingdoms. A whole bunch of other stuff is mentioned, how various characters from the game died and such, but I only mentioned the fall of the three kingdoms and their commanders. Quite sad really, none of them saw their kingdom come into absolute power. Not that you wanted to know any of that at all, but I felt the urge to tell someone, it is so interesting to me. I can't say how true all that is, I think I misspelled names and a little of it my be backwards, I haven't got all the history down yet and I'm going from memory, so don't quote me. That's all, my wrists hurt even more now.

      Howdy ya'll! *waves* I love you. April Fools! Muhaha. Kidding, I really do love you. You know why I can say that? Because I don't know who you are. I don't know who is looking at this. You could be crazy for all I know, but I say it knowing I will never meet you, I will never have to face you, whoever you are. So I can happily say I love you without meaning it, but you won't know I don't mean it. Is that mean? I guess it is. I'm a mean guy. You know who is meaner than me? Nicole. If you don't know Nicole you should. I made a website for her(against her permission) It's called http://www.geocities.com/nicolesthecenteroftheuniverse/ She really is the center of the Universe. That website is no good though, I've given it to a friend and he's made it all screwy, so if you see something stupid on there, it was Bill and Chris, not me. If you don't know what I'm talking about, good, you shouldn't. That is a personal joke between friends. Anyway, I'm tired of typing, my wrists hurt.

      Took a pirates test, these are the results:   You are The Cap'n!      Some men are born great, some achieve greatness and some slit the throats of any man that stands between them and the mantle of power. You never met a man you couldn't eviscerate. Not that mindless violence is the only avenue open to you - but why take an avenue when you have complete freeway access? You are the definitive Man of Action. You are James Bond in a blousy shirt and drawstring-fly pants. Your swash was buckled long ago and you have never been so sure of anything in your life as in your ability to bend everyone to your will. You will call anyone out and cut off their head if they show any sign of taking you on or backing down. You cannot be saddled with tedious underlings, but if one of your lieutenants shows an overly developed sense of ambition he may find more suitable accommodations in Davy Jones' locker. That is, of course, IF you notice him. You tend to be self absorbed - a weakness that may keep you from seeing enemies where they are and imagining them where they are not.            urlLink   What's Yer Inner Pirate?     brought to you by  urlLink The Official Talk Like A Pirate Web Site.

      Waaaaasup!? I haven't talked to myself on here in a long while, I guess I've been slacking. Man, the other day some weird stuff happened, I got all mad and stuff. First I was deleteing spam mail from my hotmail account and my mom saw me. I guess she doesn't trust me because she flipped out sorta. Its not my fault, hotmail doesnt have a spam filter, at least I dont. *shrugs* Anyway, then my one good friend Christine and I started up a conversation. A whole bunch of stuff is getting her down and she told me she's been cutting herself since August. I can't understand.......You know, I just cant figure out why. That got me all depressed. I tried to offer her encouraging thoughts, but I dont feel like I've helped enough. Hopefully she'll feel better when she comes to PA in the summer. She loves it her, hanging out over the summer. Man, I can't even type anymore.

      Yep, it's been awhile. Lets recap...I got all A's and B's on my finals and didn't even study. I'm just one of those guys that retains most knowledge. Hrm, what's new...Summertime is here, been getting up around noon everyday. I need a job though, been looking but its rough waters out there. Started playing Hollow again, good fun that is. Hmm, Going to There soon, some stupid camp thing my mom and her friends pressured me into going to. That's it, I can't even type now cuz of thinking about THERE. Peace, love and rock N roll.

      Schnee_Gott blinks and takes a second to look around the area, rubbing his eyes to make sure the green sky and purple grass are actually real and not just the affects of his lovely rum. He nods and looks over Kalid, then closes his eyes and tries to picture her naked again, giggling as he sees her in his mind. "You shan't get off easy just because of your body, lassy." he grins and lifts his rum bottle level by the neck, rum splashing all over his hands out of the open bottle. A dark brown aura begins to hover around the bottle, Schnee Gott lost in the lines of a drinking song, grinning and belching out note after note. Finally, a gigantic laser beam shoots out of the bottle, barreling directly at Kalid. Schnee Gott giggles like a school girl and thinks that should Kalid get hit by the laser beam, she will feel the affects of drinking ten fold!  Kalid snickers, the sight of the drunken human amusing her. "You think you can win in that state?" A slight grin tugs at her lips as she looks him up and down. As he speaks his slurred words fill her ears and she snarls, "You weren't supposed to see that!" Her nose curls up at the smell of the rum as it reaches her and she places her palms together, pallid fingers wrapping themselves around each other. She looks over to Schnee_Gott and suddenly sees a beam heading towards her head, quickly she tries to move out of the way, but, not fast enough it hits her. All around her the world goes fuzzy, unable to see very well Kalid moves her hands apart and a tiny emerald orb sits in the middles of them, it begins to rotate, faster and faster, growing as it does so. Clumsily she points towards the human and the ball flies towards his chest…  Schnee_Gott cackles crazily, saying, "You should be more careful!" and a spur of crazy laughs follows as his beam hits, infecting Kalid like a whole gallon of rum. He watches her staggering form, giggling at his own magic. The drunk stands tall, his race able to hold their alcohol well. He beams at Kalid, walking a few straight lines for her viewing pleasure. Upon seeing the green emerald orb shoot at him, he raises his bottle like a bat. Another drunks' song about the strength of men echo's forth from his lips, his terrible voice carrying on the wind. His rum bottle materializes over, the glass growing extremely thick. He takes up a sideways stance and swings, smacking the orb like a professional baseball player. He winks and says to Kalid, "One of my favorite drunken pass times!" as he watches the orb shoot over Kalid's head. Unluckly for her, when the ball made contact with his rum bottle, it was effected by Schnee's own special kind of magic. It explodes in the air above her, raining down upon her thousands of tiny multicolored eggs. One egg cracks open and out climbs a tax collecter, instantly growing full size as he steps from the egg. He walks to Kalid and shakes his head, an angry look on his face. "You haven't payed your taxes!" he bellows. If Kalid doesn't think quick, she'll find herself filling out paperwork until the end of time.  Kalid screams, the sight of the tax collector scaring her immensely! Quickly she draws her sword and slices at him, metal blade flying through the air and glinting in the moonlight. Her blade hits true and the tax collectors head rolls quickly across the floor. Slightly clamer now she looks over at Scnhee, sapphire orbs blazing, "I shall not be beaten by a drunk!" The effects of the human's last attack still with her she stumbles, and her eyes glaze over, a drunken grin tugs at her lips and she staggers over to schnee and hurls her blade, unskillfully at his neck....  Schnee_Gott unfurls his pair of icen wings, defying all laws of physics, the wings stretch out, spreading to a wingspan of nearly forty feet. He jumps once, his wings pounding downward in an attempt to push him into the air. He soars up, out of reach of Kalid or her sword, before looking down. He eeps! and stares at his foot, the sword stuck into his boot. "I caught it with my foot!" he tries to bend over and pull it out, but his form flips over in the air and he falls to the ground, smacking it with a thud. His wings quickly melt off, no longer of use at the moment. He stands up, not bothering to pull the sword from his boot. "My big toe!" he bellows at Kalid, a funny looking grin spreading over his lips. The words ring out, echoing throughout the sky. The purple grass shimmers for only a second, then you realize it isn't shimmering, it's exploding! The grass explodes, blowing up all the leftover eggs from earlier. Out of each egg jumps a big toe, but these be not ordinary big toes! Each one has a face and tiny limbs, a grin on their little toe faces. They rush at Kalid, ready to throw themselves at Kalid to avenge Schnee Gott's injuried toe. Kalid better be scared, big toes can leave welts!  Kalid blinks, the toes running at her, having never faced this sort of attack she doesn't know what to do! Looking down at her own feet she sees she's wearing her boots! She can stamp on them! So, one by one she stamps on the big toes, crushing each one in turn. She tramples on the toes 'til there is only one left. She bends down and picks it up, blonde hair falling over her pale face as she does so. Picking the toe up with slender fingers she holds it tight in her hand. Muttering something indistinguishable under her breath she sets it down on the ground, and it hobbles over to Schnee, roaring madly and foaming at the mouth at him it rips at him with tiny hands, and kicks him with tiny feet...  Schnee_Gott gasps! and wants to hug Kalid, only she is far away. He sends her a flying smooch before leaning down to pick up the big toe. "You were thinking about me!" he grins and rips the little arms and legs off the big toe before leaning down and pulling his boot off. He yanks the sword out with it and cuts his injuried big toe off without a second thought. He shakes his hand, pours some rum on the wound, and sticks the new big toe in place. Grinning, he says, "Now I can attack people with my rabbid toe."

Hung out with my neighbor for awhile, then someone wanted to look at our house so we had to leave while they were there, I ended up sitting in a car watching my dog for like half an hour. It was good ole' fun. I'm not doing much of anything now, talking to Anais. *shakes a fist* She's crazy. Good thing I lurve crazy. *googly eyes* Bet you weren't expecting that.  Color.  Ouch, that hurts my eyes. Psh, got a great rp going on in Karchan, but I'm not giving out any details yet. You know what they say, No Wheezing the Juice!

      I love the movie,  The Outlaw Josey Wales . It is just a great movie. I don't care what anyone else says, it is Clint Eastwood's best film. It is full of so many great one liner's, you know? Like, Josey Wales kills a bunch of guys and someone says, "Ain't we gonna bury those fellar's?" and Josey Wales says, "Buzzards gotta eat, same as worms." Another time Josey Wales is riding along side his old indian friend and he says, "It seems as soon as I get to likin' someone, they ain't around long." and the indian says back, "I noticed, when you get to dislikin' someone, they ain't around too long either." Another great time, this bounty hunter that's been following Josey comes in to the saloon and Josey Wales says, "You a bounty hunter?" and the man says back, "I've got to make a living somehow." and Josey replies, "Dieing ain't much of a living, boy." How great is that? I mean, it's just great. You've got to picture all of these as coming from Clint Eastwood though, in his great, rugged tone. My favorite line though, all time favorite, is when Josey Wales is riding his horse, and he pulls out to this little hut with an old indian man sitting on the porch. They talk for a bit, and the indian decides to join Josey. Josey says, "Have you got any food?" and the indian pulls this small transparent-orange rock like stone from his pocket and holds it to his eye as he says, "I got this piece of rock candy. It ain't for eatin' though, just for looking through." The most hilarious thing I've ever seen. Picture that coming out of this tiny old indian man. You have to see it. Go watch the movie. Now, I command you as the all powerful writer of the blog.....Please? Fine, you don't have to, I just won't like you anymore if you don't. I'm a go watch it now.

      Nevermind, Anais wasn't ignoring me. She just wasn't talking to me. I know, I don't understand it either, but she's right. Yup, she is, whether you think so or not. I stand behind her 100%. That's really all I have to say to you, so I'll be off now. Going to go pet the green Kalamazoo. As a final thought, remember that Anais is perfect in every way, and always right. If you remember that you will live long and prosper.

      I'm bored. Anais is ignoring me. That's right,  ignoring   me . I couldn't believe it myself, really. Anywho, time to appease all you crazy people that read this. Wait, no one reads it, my bad. Well, if you happen upon my own little world, go to this one instead -  urlLink Monkey blog  because it is so much cooler. Probably the only blog I ever really read on a daily basis. So, back to me. No, I'm not being all vain and stuff, it's my blog, it has to be about me, I have the right to make it about me. With that settled, back to what I was on about. Karchan is boring, so is Hollow. RL ain't too hot. I'm moving, a nice house over in Upper Milford. I'll be going to East Penn, I know some kids that go there so it won't be that weird. I'll have my own room and stuff, but we're not moving there until August 27th. Right now I'm pretty much helping everyday to keep this house looking real good, so when people want to look at it everything is decent. Mowed the lawn earlier and weedwacked. You know the problem with East Penn, I'm friends with this one kid, but I hate his other friends. I guess now I'll have to like them. Funny story, I was talking to this girl that I know likes me, and she asked me to the movies. I don't feel the same way about her, but I didn't want to say no, I'm not that mean. I sorta just danced around the issue, got on to other subjects. I know, loyal reader, you probably hate me now. I'm not that mean of a guy, really. 867-5309. Call it.

      Lets see, teeth thing went good. I gotz me teeth out, was just sitting there, gabbing with the nurses about who knows what, and then I remember waking up to being told to roll on to a recovery bed. It was cool. That was wed, and it is now Monday of the next week. I couldn't eat until Saturday, so the first thing I ate was pizza hut pizza. It was good. My teeth still hurt, and chewing is hard, but what can I do. I dueled Neraka, but I got out of it. Through a series of rp's and such, I don't have to die. Of course, we'll never know who wins. So, I'll go ahead and post it all on here for you. That's about it, have fun chortling.

      I get my wisdom teeth out tomorrow! *is scared* Tomorrow is Wed. July 7th. I get them out at 9:45. On Friday, 2 a.m. my alt gets married on Hollow. Don't really care about that, I'm turning him evil during the wedding to spice things up. My teeth. I love them. I hate needles. I get the knock out juice through a needle. Not much else new, fourth o July was alright, saw some great fireworks but didn't get to send any of my own into the air, at least not that many. Went to a friends house and watched the Dorney Park ones go off, it was cool. I'll post some more to you loyalists later, probably after my teeth come out. Oh yeah, I can't eat or drink anything after midnight tonight. Later, peeps.
