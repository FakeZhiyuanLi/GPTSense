      Wow...yet another normal day. I finished my English paper this morning. Chilled and played some games. Played with Jessica (platonically, you perv!), memorized my lines for Forum....or at least some of them. Fished for a while. Rinse. Repeat. I need to wash that. Strange tingling sensation. What exactly makes something sharp cut you? As I talk with one of my friends whose weekend consisted of going out with friends and having a good time without feeling guilty about it, I ask myself a very important question: do I want to live a boring life because I'm smart and realize that in the long run it won;t be worth it or would I rather live life to the fullest and make the most of every day, not worrying about the repercussion but instead milking the moment for every sweet drop of pleasure it's worth. Damn...I need to wash that.

      Hey everybody, hows it goin?!? Sorry I didn't get the chance to post yesterday, I was some sorta tired! Anyways, rehearsal kicked ass yesterday. That's about it for yesterday. Woohoo. Today was just as boring: I began the driving portion of my drivers' ed class today and boooooy did it suck. Not so much that I drove poorly, but more that he made me follow every damn rule in specific...I thought I was going to explode. I've been thinking about the paper we have to write for history and I think I've decided to do 'ol Willy...that's Shakespeare, dumbass. Yeah. My neck hurts. Hmm...maybe if I took some medicine for it. Juggies are cool. When ice melts in water, it makes this cool half-water, half-milk mixture. I'm still single. Yep..single.... I beat badgers with spoons.

      Hey everybody! Wow...today was the best day I've had in a loooong time...knock on wood. The first thing was my finding out that a hot girl at my school might have a thing for me. Nice. Then, I got a 95 on a geometry test that I was sure I failed. That right there is enough to make my day. You don't understand my lack of talent when it comes to geometry. I suck...no, I  more   than suck...like, I  really   suck...bad. ANYWAYS. Then we had out first rehearsal for forum today and it kicked ass...except for the fact that my solo sucked...and no one could do the dance...and one of my best friends (I told you I'd put you in here!) wasn't there...ok, so maybe it wasn't the greatest rehearsal ever, but it's better than sitting on my ass at home pondering the questions that have plagued mankind forever. Like what are those weird little spots that appear when you stare at a light for a long time....or why cheese is yellow...or who the "they" in "that's what they say" is....or what in God's name that awful smell is...damn, what  is  that?!?

      Hello, readers! (yep...all three of you) How's it goin? Good? Good. Yeah my day was actually pretty good today. Yep...I haven't been this tired in a long time. So the only thing that happened me today was an exercise in drama. The exercise consisted of a classmate and I pretending our mother was seeing a man who beat her. We decided to take matters into our own hands and cut his break lines. THing is, our mom took his car and we ended up killing her. I figured it would be difficult but....wow. When my partner walked into the room with tears in her eyes...I was stunned. I know it kind of sounds stupid, but this exercise really opened my eyes to the true power of acting. When someone is so good at what they do that they can tap into their psyche and make themselves truly feel that they killed their mother and bring forth all of the feelings and reactions that accompany it... that is truly amazing. Damn. I only hope that I can do that someday. Oh, and I was a smartass to Knives today...it felt so good. Hehe. Ciao.

      This is my most unique post yet! Why? Because I am posting from school! Woohoo... Yeah I'm in study hall and contemplating shoving a pencil in my eye out of boredom. Anyways.... I have a geometry test in two periods and I'm praying that I pass. Man I suck at geometry. Well, I should go now...see yah later. Sorry, I'm too tired to say anything funny.

      Hey Everybody, how yah doin. Well today was quite the interesting day. Earlier this year, I was asked by a teacher to enter a poem competition. A  SPANISH  poem competition, mind you. Now it didn't take me very long to figure out that I didn't want to do this competition. Problem is, I already told the lady that I'd do it. Great. So all this time, I've told her I'd do it, not because I want to, but because I pitied her and I felt like I was letting her down. So today, we got a test back and I told her that I was disappointed in my grade and that I thought I did better. The following is pretty much the dialogue between us:  me: Aw man, I could've sworn I did better than this knives: Yes, you can do better, but all you care about is  Drama  (Please note that I put that in italics because she made some damn queer motion with her body and hands to accompany her jab at my interests) me (quite offended): Actually, I spent all weekend working on a history outline. knives: Oh,  SORRRRRRRRY!  (ONCE AGAIN SAID QUITE SARCASTICALLY)  At this point, I sat my test down and walked out.  Now I finally have a reason  not  to o the damn competition. How DARE she question my priorities. Personally, her class isn't very high on my list, especially not now. Hell yeah I care more about drama than her stupid competition. Damnit...some people, huh.    Anyways I'm pissed, you don't care, my head is about to split open, and I'm tired as hell. Ciao.

      Yeah so I'm bored so I'm going to post again. I saw 50 First Dates last night. It was ok. The movie itself was funny as hell yet quite unbelievable. Spoilers Ahead. In the film, some chick (Drew Barrymore) meets some playboy (Adam Sandler...talk about some poor typecasting). Badaboom, badabing,They fall in love.  Thing is this chick has a disorder where she has no short term memory (aka, she can't remember the day before, therefore everyday forgetting Sandler). Cue Hilarity. Sandler then uses his shy wit that we all so fucking love to figure out whats going on. He finds that the people in the chick's (damnit, I'm just gonna call her A and Sandler shall be B) life have been lying to her and making her think that everyday is the day after the day she had her accident. Uh huh, that' exactly what I said. Anyways, the people work so hard at making A (remember the variable she was given?) think that it's the day after the accident that the viewer will curl their lip in disgust and feel as if they had just received a donkey punch in the kidneys. I mean come on, is this how low Hollywood has sunk to? They figure if they throw enough random shit at the viewer, maybe they won't realize that at this point the writers have run shit out of ideas. I'd give the movie a....2 out of 5 because they might as well have given me a swift kick to the testes, stolen $5 from my wallet, and sent me on my way.

      SO....where to start. This is my new BLOG (not quite sure what it stands for) . By the way, my names Rip...but you probably already knew that. So today is Monday and we're out of school for Presidents' Day WOOHOO. But then again, because of the fact that my life is pitiful and boring as hell, I'll probably be on my ass all day while my peers go out and have fun. Well I guess it's better that I stay home then go out and do something stupid, only to regret it the next day. This Sucks.

      Hey...since now I never post I've decided to try something new: I'm going to begin a story and with each new post I shall continue it...why? Because my eye hurts. Now, let us begin:         Fabian had always been an outcast. You would be too if your name were Fabian. Anywho, Fabian was a young man with a special ability: in order to cope with his problems, Fabian could pause the very weaving of space and time and undo whatever stitch the fates had sewn and alter them in whatever way he wished. Useful? Yeah, it may come in handy once or twice. Thus begins Fabian's journey.     Day one:...  This story sucks...yes, it just hit me. Sorry to waste these thirty seconds of your life. Let's try this again, shall we?    There once existed a young man named Rip. Caring, Rip tried his hardest to keep everyone happy. However, this wasn't always the easiest task. The following are true excerpts from his daily life. Schwa.    Today was a fairly good day to Rip. On a scale of 1 to 10, one being the worst, ten the best, Rip's day was about a six. A little bit better than average because he is finally on normal speaking sperms with someone he cares about very much once again. As usual, his archnemesis... The evil Count Knives (that's right) was on the prowl once again. She issued a true test of Rip's will today: she forced him down on a table, restrained him with leather straps and cackled as a pendulum slowly made its way towards his crotch and Rip Jr. This process is also often referred to as a test, but hey, my story, my words, got it?!? Sadly, my Archbishop (Mrs. Beard) is departing from the school and the time has come to issue a search far and wide across the land in order to find a worthy taskmaster. Will the interviewees survive the test? Luckily, the princess smiled at Rip today, marking the first day this week that the sun has truly shined on his castle. Next week, Rip may even learn how to use the force, who the hell knows.

      Well, my big mouth got me in trouble once again. I said some downright cruel shit to a person that meant a whole hell of a lot to me...damnit, way to go Rip. Maybe she can find it in her heart to forgive me...I hope so, because I miss her so much...Oh, and sorry I havent been updating my blog recently. Busybusy. Ciao.

       "MY ASS IS ON FIRE!!!"                Juuuusssttt kidding, Im not into the whole sodomy thing, unlike some of my classmates *cough* NASTAY *cough*. Anyways, I'm bored so I figured I'd post. True, I should be working on my history paper, but you can only talk about Shakespeare for so long until your sperm count begins to drop. Why? Beats me.                My day today? It was thuper, thank you!! Wore my Hooters shirt, didn't get chastised for it. I was elected Initiation Marshall for next year's Thespian Initiations...no idea what I'm suppose to do, but the name sure as hell sounds awesome, don't it?!?               And in girl news...I had one call me today. She was just calling to inform me of my being voted  INITIATION MARSHALL  (DUNDUNDUNNNNNNNNNNN) for next year's initiates, so she only expected the call to last like two minutes. BOOOOOOYYYYY was she wrong!! I babbled on for like 45 minutes..I was doing all the talking, note you...I felt like a schoolgirl again. I hadn't felt that way since before the operation...back when my name was Ripina, good time for hire. But I couldn't believe how I just kept going on and on. Oh well.              Once again, my big mouth got me in trouble today...surprise surprise. I said mean shit about someone who really doesn't deserve mean shit to be said about her. Ummmm... prom's this weekend. School's almost out. Paper's almost finished. My hair's on fire. Im almost a thespian. HOLY SHIT, MY HAIRS ON FIIIREEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  "AIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"

      Due to friggin ginormous amounts of response (most rather angry..yes, there were torches involved, pitchforks as well), I have decided to..umm..."amend" my post about comparing girls to bread...if you don't see yourself in one of those categories, you fall within the bread store next door, which I should have gone into in the first place, I was simply too blind to see it.

         As I sat at lunch with my friends, we began to discuss out required reading for English-  A Tale Of Two Cities . Yes, it sucks about as badly as it sounds. Now then, we all decided that in order to spice up the story a bit, it should be rewritten as a Matrix movie. HOW KICKASS WOULD THAT BE?!? Like Darnay is Neo, Lucie is Trinity, Dr. Manette is Morpheus- HOLY SHIT I THINK I JUST PINCHED A LOAF!!! THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES!!!! buutttttttt.... then I remembered that I'm a lazy procrastinator who has the attention span of a 3 year old with down syndrome. Perhaps that explains why I'm so slow to update my BLOG. Anyways... I thought it was a good idea. School's almost out- WOOHOOO!!!                Day two in my search for female sustenance has been futile. I'm still horn..errr HUNGry and stuff. Yep...not many chicks to choose from at our school. Imagine you're in a supermarket but all they sell are three kinds of bread- Untouchable, Skanky, and Bitch. Then if you're really nice to the guy behind the counter and you wink at him a little, he may show you their secret and limited stash of Perfect bread...ALL OF WHICH IS ALREADY SOLD!!!  DAMNIT!!!!       But I am talking to this one chick...but shes taken.  SURPRISE SURPRISE , NO?!? oh well...she asked me to say that she was (warning these may not be true because she tends to exaggerate): shes so pleasant, good, kind, polite, fine, hott, sexy, pretty, gorgeous, attractive, good looking, beautiful, cute, appealing, sweet, nice looking, cool, funny, fun to hang out with((even though we dont)), fashionable, arousing, so incredibly nice because she came to my play,overwhelming, grand, breathtaking, splendid, remarkable, amazing, marvelous, awe-inspiring, astounding, humbling...and kind of skanky. KIDDING, KIDDING! She's not that polite. BADOOMBANG! Once again, just kidding- he isn't  THAT  skanky. *wink*    NOW GET ME THE HELL OUTTA HERE!!!!!!

      DUE TO BOATLOADS OF REQUESTS (that boat being one of those toys you play with in the bathtub..no, not the big ones...yeah, about *motions with index finger and thumb*  that  big), I SHALL BE UPDATING MY BLOG, HERE GOES:      Forum is over. Ah, the sweet, sweet smell of normal life. Then again, this now means I have no excuse for skipping class and not doing homework.  DRAT, DAMN YOU DR.BADGUY, DAAMMMNNN YOOUUUUUUU!!!!  Oh well. I've finally gotten over the plague that was She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Her poison has been sucked from my veins and I am now back on the  International Market of Luv . W00t!  I'd like to take a brief intermission here and offer a nice round of applause for the  BOLD  button.   Now then. Where was I? Ah yes...I've grown a bit distant from my best friend. Not quite sure...I think he's playing with fire again as well (GIRLS). I hope things can go back to the way they were. Do I have a certain lucky lady in mind? Perhaps. We shall see. As far as my life outside of school goes...at this point, it has become nonexistent. My typical night now consists of watching TV, running, touching myself, talking on the computer, touching myself, reading, touching myself, then a nice rinse and repeat. Oh well. My life is boring. I suppose the next big thing to happen to me will be prom. Only 2 more weeks.   Ok, I'm done. May I be excused?

          Wow...it's been so long. This is kind of depressing actually. It's been like two months since I last posted and not much has happened. School's gotten out. I've dug myself a hole and dove into it. It is a rare occasion this summer that one can find a good time to converse with me. However, my disappearance isn't just out of choice- I have been taken hostage. My captor, however, isn't some machine gun toting extremist that captured me- it was my father. Yep, I'm a hostage in his office. I suppose it isn't that bad, though- I'm getting paid. I also get my license this month. woohoo...forgive me, I'm not as excited as most because I realize my acquisition of a license will only give my father more opportunities to tighten his grip around the balls of my summer. Oh well. Over and out.
