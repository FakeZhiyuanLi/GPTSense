      I think I know why I have been in a blah mood all week. Seems like a cold virus has worked its way into my system.  I couldnt figure out why I was SO tired. Now I know. Hopefully I can get over it before too long. I am usually not one to lie around when sick, but right now I could sleep hours. Ok enough belly aching about being siiiiiiick. I am looking forward to the weekend. I seem to miss that certain someone. But thats not really any thing new. Saturday doesn't look so great for weather, but Sunday looks pretty awesome. I want to get on my bike!! Hillsborough I guess is the destination. I do like it out there. Interesting to see if I have improved any skills. Doubt it. I seem to have the "divide and conquor" attitude when biking. Mash and bash over everything. Grrrrrrr! I don't think its agressive but more stupid than anything. NO skill, just brute strength. Yaaah all 115 lbs of me..huge brute.

      I seem to have a bit to say today. The jumbling in my brain is still an issue. Might as well type it out. I wonder how much work is too much. I gave away to my receptionist a few of the duties I had before, because the Scheduling/Tracking portion of my job was taking up more time. Today, I get another task. What was the point of getting rid of some if they keep giving me more? Burn out is inevitable.

      I think I missed my calling. I should have been a therapist. People seem to like to talk to me about their feelings or whats going on in their lives. I don't mind listening, helping or sharing advise. But I think I take on the burden of their problems sometimes. Especially if I care for them. I want to help and free them of their pain somehow. What can I do really? Just listen, I guess. Thats all most people want. To get things off of their chests. Is it my personality that makes people gravitate towards me when they are feeling the pressures of their lives? Maybe its just that simple fact..I listen. I need to come out of this doldrum. I took on the burden of someone's problem last night. But there is nothing I can do. Seriously. I did my duty as a friend. I listened, I gave my advise. That helped him a lot and he appreciated it. So why do I still feel blue about it? Empathy is a strong emotion. If only it were sympathy I felt.  Thats an easier emotion. That one rolls off your back once you are done with it. Empathy sticks with you. Ok..now who do I talk to about my blue mood? Thats another one of my problems. Lord I seem to have many. I hold emotion in. It does eat at you but I can't seem to release it. I have been getting better, but not where I should be. I think I feel intimidated by my mouth not being able to formulate logically what my mind is thinking. I KNOW what I need to say, but it always comes out wrong or backwards or not the way I want. So therefore, it stays tumbling around in my brain, making me crazy.

      Yep thats me. Did my first over the handle bar face plant last night. Well it was more of a side, hands, cheek plant. Amazing the formula that has to be in place for that. Not quite enough speed on a semi technical, slight downhill, ass not over the back wheel, "tomb stone" in middle of the trail. Glad it was mostly moss I landed on. PHEW. I somehow managed a gash in my left calf though. Didnt notice til I saw blood dripping. I think that was on another part though, not the crash and burn. Its probably a good thing I like mountain biking, because with all the war wounds, flips, crashes I have had lately, most would have hung up the jersey. Maybe because I haven't had a real scare yet. The crash I had where I got the nasty contusion on my left butt was bad. Never came so close to puking, but still, I ride. I might have to resort to full armour pretty soon.

      Its been a few days since I have posted to this thing. Probably because the only computer time I have is at work. My home computer is fried. Well its not even mine..but the one at my house.  Funny how you don't miss something until its gone. I mainly used the computer at home to play music and do banking. Oh well....the suffering continues. I suppose I should recount what I have been doing since I last posted on the 11th. A few days of it was vacation. I actually DID a vacation, not the usual running around climbing this, riding that. We vegged. It was exactly what I needed. My brain needed a break not to mention my body. Don, Bailey and I stayed at his brother's cottage on Grand Lake. Beautiful country. Gorgous cottage. We managed a trip to the Penobscot. I still love it there, although my boating skills were non existant. The total confidence thing. To which, I have none. Then again, I hadn't stuck my butt in the boat for a while. Riding my bike seems to be more fulfilling. I actually feel like I am doing something and my body benefiting from it. Feel the burn. See the mud. Reap the benefits. I almost feel embarassed to wear something that shows my legs. I wore a skirt yesterday to work. When I looked at my legs, I felt like hiding them. Bruises, scratches, scabs. Very un-attractive or so I thought. But as one co-worker put it "we don't notice things like that". Guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder and not the mtn biker. :) As I look back at what I have typed...random. All over the place. I skip from one subject to another. But I guess the thoughts are really connected....to me.

      Should I be posting every day? That seems like a lot of pressure. Especially when nothing interesting happens in my life. I suppose this is a journal of sorts. Put down anything and everything. Then we are back to the ordinary. Why would I want to put down what I had for supper and that funny thing Bailey did? I'd like to post "adventures", but those are few. They happen mostly on weekends. During the week, its pretty mundane. I did have a great ride last night. Rockwood trails were in perfect condition. Hopefully they will hold up for the race on Sunday.  I am not participating in this one, I dont think. I rode part of the marked section. Going to be pretty tough. Great course though. Lost of everything! I had a mosquito in my coffee. Nothing more alarming when you feel something in your mouth. I thought it was grinds...wish it had been.

      To some I seem to lead an extraordinary life.  Or out of the ordinary. I suppose because I don't sit on the couch or snack my way into oblivion, it would seem different to some. I wonder sometimes if I need to be doing more. But there are days I want to do less. Last night was extremely ordinary. I wonder how people could do it day in and day out. Work, eat, sleep and throw an excessive amount of TV in there somewhere. I almost went insane around 7:30. I felt I should be doing something physical. The 3 hr epic ride seemed to be forgotten. Maybe be because my body had recovered and I felt no ill effects. Am I hyperactive? Why do I feel the need to be constantly on the move? Its more than an addiction to physical fitness. Its an escape for the mind too. Does my mind need to focus on anything but what is going on in my life? Why would it have to? I am the most content that I have been in years. Or am I? Question the question. I feel happy. But happy with what. Happy with career. Happy with Don. Happy with my physical condition. Too much going on in my brain today. Not that extraordinary. I think I have drank too much coffee today.

      First posting. First page. First everything. I wish I were more creative. Sometimes I wonder if I have a creative fibre in my body. I think not. Some people are blessed with a natural creativity. Seems some families are saturated in it. I think mine was in another room when creative genes were passed out. Maybe that fact makes us unique. Not a creative gene to split between us.
