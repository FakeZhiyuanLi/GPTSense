       Course Objective   This course is designed to help students understand that high school is different from middle school and that there are certain expectations and personal responsibilities that are required to be a successful student and to graduate.  The main concepts to be covered in this course focus on goal setting, personal actions, study and critical thinking skills, organization, and basic computer applications.  This course is to serve a three-fold function: 1) to help students develop a sense of their own ability to succeed; 2) to give them a set of tools to empower then to be successful in accomplishing their personal and academic goals; 3) to give them practice in using these tools.

      What have you noticed so far about the presentation of the training? What questions do you still have about the class?  I would like some time to work with my colleagues at the EHS site so that we have a unified approach.  This is not like teaching English.   We need more time to work with materials and chat together.  I feel a bit too loose .

      What did you gain from today's training? What strategies, ideas, or lessons do you already have in mind to use in your classes? What are you most excited about? What are you most concerned about? What questions do you still have? Who are you going to turn to for support?   Additional ideas on what the curriculum is supposed to cover.  I have done much of the goal-setting strategies, computer lessons, learning styles and many other areas in my Connections class.  That I will have one hour instead of only 1/2 hour to teach the class.  That the students will hopefully be in there for a full 12 weeks instead of 4 or 8 only.  None this evening.  Rhonda--she is fabulous and very knowledgable!!  Thank you all for a very organized and thought out in-service.  Fran
