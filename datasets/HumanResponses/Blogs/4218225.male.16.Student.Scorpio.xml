      What is the point of my excistance? I can't help but feel that my life here is a mistake. Is there a purpose for my life? I question if there is. I will never make a real difference to anyone in this world. People probably wouldnt even know if I just dissappeared. I dont like this place but i stay here because my life is not my own. I sit and wait for the day that this pointless excistance of mine ends. I wonder what would my friends and family would be like if i had never excisted. To be truthfull they would probably be exactly the same as they are now. I have never realy done anything that would change a persons life and to tell the truth i dont think that I ever will. I am waiting hoping that maybe God will show me what ever purpose he must of had in creating me. Now that i think of it though who, said he had a purpose in creating me. I wish i knew why I seem to hate my own existance. Oh well life is still just barly starting for me maybe by the time it does i will understand the joke that is my life.........

      This summer has been great. I've met new friends and gotten to know a lot of people in my youth group. I am happy for alot of them as they start school tomorrow. But as I lay in bed trying to go to sleep I could not help but want to cry. The summer is over the fun will slow life will become real again. In my heart I can not help but wish life could become more surreal again. I do not want to deal with my senior year. I think about it and cringe because of the fact that Im no longer in school with the people i know. There will be no more pranks on each other, no hangin out at lunch. I will probably choose not to go to my Prom cause i see no point. I will probably not even get to see my friends graduate. I know that as this school year begins it also must end and that is somthing i do not want. I will truly be alone after highschool. I will go to college(or art instute) and probably never see any of these people again. I cant even say oh well there will be a ten year reunion cause for me there wont be. I'm so scared of not knowing what im gonna do. As i start my last year of highschool I cant even say that ive figured out who i really am. Im a stranger to myself and most others and i dont know how im gonna survive. Some would say trust in God, but ive taken this to him and ive gotten no response. I feel as if in the time that it turns out i most need someone, there is no one. Even in this though I will hide from everyone my sense of lonlyness. It is none of any of thems concern they will go on and continue life while in My heart and mind I try to run from it. I pretend to be just a big kid so that i dont have to really think about whats going to happen latter i can just live in the now. I used to look foward to the future and as i thought about things last week decisions were easy to make but now that I can see the time for those decisions to take effect I cant see myself going through with them. all of this is made worse by the fact that this time next year alot of my friends will be gone and i will have no one to turn to for any kind of comfort. But there lives must go on and so they shall while i watch from the side lines wondering if I will get over my fears.

      For the longest time ive wondered what freinds are for. I mean yeah there fun to hang out with but is that all that they are there for? Ive been in kinda of a low point of life lately and I was starting to wonder if the enemies lies would give me an easy way out of what i was going through. I was barly holding on to my hope in people and my abilites in deciding who i am. But as the light of hope seemed to start to fade from me and i started to fall something happened, the light stoped fading and I found a Hand reaching to pull me back up. At first I refused the since of grabing the hand and letting the person pull me back to reason, but they still held out there hand waiting. That hand belongs to a friend and though i still feel as if the hole i was in is trying to bring me back in i remember that a friend showed me that i didnt need to be there and that even if things seem bad that i should still hold on to whatever hope i can. In this I found out that friends are not only there to hang with but to help you through things as well. Life is hard but it is so much easier when a person has true freinds as i have found that i do.

       urlLink katie  said... Choose Hope. The fun times you've had in Highschool with all of your friends and the fun (and sometimes dumb)things we all did should not be overshadowed or void because of the negative things that have happened. Learn and grow from both of them but take with you hope and the love of your friends.(i didnt mean to delete this i was just randomly clicking stuff, KAllama) 10:57 Pm  What if Im not sure I can choose hope anymore? What if i have hit the point where the only thing that keeps me going is my faith in christ? He is the only one i still hold any faith or hope in, all else seems more and more pointless everyday. The past few days as I have thought of where ive been and where im going, i can not see any hope in either. I guess the real question i ask u is: What if i just want to take the easy road out of all of this?

      In my my mind there are to factions that always are always locked in battle for control of my mind.  One side Has my hopes of what I will become after highschool. it reminds me of how lucky I am to have the friends that I do. This side is the side of me that loves this place and the people that i know here. I love hangin out with My friends and I hope that after highschool we will keep in touch. I will come back to remember the times i have had here and to hang out with those that helped make those memorys.  The other side sees all the mistakes that I have made. It just wants to be out of highschool so that I can leave this place. It has no attachment to my friends because it does not see the point once I leave. It brings back the memorys of those that I have had feelings for, or "liked", and calls me a fool for hoping that someday somthing could come from them. I will never come back or speak to these people ever again.  I ask u, which do u think i should give into? I have made my choice with the help of a friend, jesus ,but still to those who i allow to read this which one do u think i should listen to?

      Its funny you know, when people want to know more about you and instead of just talking to you, they decied that they want to play a game like truth or dare. That game is so funny to me now because i cant help but think that when i was younger, playing that game was fun, there was nothing to hide and therefore no reason not to play. Now that im older its not as easy to share my feelings  or tuths about mebecause it might let someonein deep enough to hurt me. Im the type of person who will hold most emotions inside untill they burst out in some form or another. As i write this i long for the days when i was able to tell my true feelings to someone more than God. I know he is always there and already knows what i may be going through but, I cannot help but wish i could share with someone that is here in the flesh, someone who knows what i go through. Not being able to share with someone on my level has almost left me in a state of emotionless. i can give off the fake emotions and I do, but there is still a longing in my soul for so much more......

      As i think of years gone by i remember the good and the bad. I remeber my friends, my enemies, and those i should have been kinder to. I remeber this place where i have lived and think how beutiful it really is. But, as i remember the past i am forced to think of the choices and paths that are still ahead of me. I search for at least one thing that will draw be back here after i leave, that search has not long to go. I have my friends and family, but somehow those alone will not bring me back or maybe even keep me from ever leaving. I will search and find trusting God to lead me all the way...........
