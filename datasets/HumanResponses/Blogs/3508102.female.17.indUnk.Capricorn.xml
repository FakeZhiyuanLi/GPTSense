      I started to write again for reasons I do not know. I just feel that I need to write. I have had several diaries on several sites but I quit writing because I fell into a depression. Which I have been out of thanks to the changes made in my life. However, lately I feel like I've been fighting to stay out of my depression.  I recently changed schools (now out for the summer.) Made new friends, real friends. One in particular, the one I like more than a friend and knows but there's this complication. It all started months ago we hung out every day for like a weekend then all of a sudden he wants nothing to do with anyone, he said it was because of his leaving (won't be going to school with us next year.)And because he hardly knew me it was easiest to push me away but I won't let him. We still hang out still talk on the phone. I try to talk to him but I can't nothing will come out lately though  have been saying somethings to him. I need to talk to him. Something he said to me a while go has gotten to me. Back when he started this whole pushing people away he said that He liked me but that all he would do was hurt me. I totally forgot he said that to me but lately that's all has been on my mind. I think about him all the time. I don't understand I hardly know him yet I can't let him out of my life completely, I have tried and tried.

      Its 4:57 and I'm writing instead of sleeping... ahhhhhh insomnia what a great thing... not... anyways. Lets see...   Went to the dog track with dad but it cancled do to rain. Dad and I are getting along okay. Made me realize... oh well. Mom called on the way to he track brought tears to my eyes not sure why but it did. I didn't cry! Brownie point for me! Oh YAY!  Called Casey he didn't answer both times I called... oh well... fought the urge to call alex. I almost gave in. but then rick called me. (met him through a friend... usually we talk online...) I talked to him for a while watched a movie on witches pretty weird but cool only saw some parts then watched music videos. Funess! Read more of my book, anita seires... so far its okay not the best one. but oh well.

      My day was uneventful... woke up at noon sat in bed, watched tv and read... didn't take a shower until five... gross... oh well didn't feel like doing anything. Then dad wanted to go to the dog track... went with him. Although they cancled because of rain. The electricity went out... luckily we got out of the elevator before it went out. That would not be cool.  I'm breaking... Called alex last night. We had an akward silence I dunno I just miss... him. I never knew I could want this so much. Then... I cried. I though I was over crying over him. Damn I dont know what to do. My tough act is breaking not sure why but it is. I mean WHY did I allow myself to call.(The first time.) Maybe because I was in tears and just wanted to hear his voice. Damn I hate me. I hate him yet love him I need... gr  I dunno I need to leave talk to Jason... see if he helps... I hope so I want to talk to casey.. I might call him later.

      For some strange reason last night I snapped... I called him... I got his voice mail, he never called me back. Is it a good thing he didn't call me or bad? I don't know what to think. I don't want to care.Just because It's driving me crazy. I don't know what's worse fighting him and knowing he's some what okay. Or not knowing anything. I wonder when he's going to tenesse to visit his dad. Not sure why considering what his dad did. (I don't know much about that.) I mean really what do I do?? I dunno. I want to see him. All I want is him in my life... all I ever wanted, but then again what I want doesn't matter.  AHHHHHH!!Okay I feel somewhat better... that will last five minutes.   How can I want someone that I've known for seven months. How could I let myself feel anything. He broke the wall. Which I don't know how he did it. All know was I was sick of hiding who I was... damn I was SO FUCKING close to being happy.

      Can't sleep for once I can actually write late at night... that will be the beauty if I live by myself... I could write whenever... it's like elven... okay not that late... in fact early for many but I dunno.   Today I was got my check... only  fifty four dollars... so much for eighty... damn...  I'm in a good, despite the fact I only have one book left... I read two books in a day, although they aren't huge only like 200 pages or something like that... need the fifth, and sixth, the other book is an anita blake series... might read it tonight/this morning.   When I drove to get my check all these songs came on that reminded me of Alex, but I was smiling at all the good things... even though he treated me like shit most of the time, the begining... wow... he just fills my heart with such happiness. I want to call him so bad... I have this urge so far I've been fighting by reading... most of the time I want to call I know he's in school (Summer school so he can graduate early.) I just don't get why he means so much to me after all the shit he put me through, although I know he wouldn't have done that if I would have let him go from the begining when he asked me to. So it is my fault but my determination was underminded by his determination. Can't make someone open up or talk to you unless they want to... or you black mail... that wouldn't work on alex... haha. Just kidding. But I don't know what I would give to see his face, just to look into his eyes for a minute. even though those eyes cant trust me. I know for a minute I saw into his eyes... If only I could do that again. To have him hold me and to feel all the pain he has. I know I can't make what his father did to him. Or, his mother away at work. Or, all the pain Steph Caused him, because he truly did love her. He still does. Part of me knows he cares and loves me to, maybe not in the way I want but that doesn't matter. Because I care for him. He knows I do. (At least I think he does, he should.) I don't know what I would do or give to have him open up to me. BUT I can't make that desion, only he can it's all up to him. Part of me knows he won't call. But one can hope. And feel, even though he caused me pain, the one thing I can say he NEVER once lied to me. No matter how much he would hurt me he never lied to me. (Once I made him talk to me.) I know I pushed him to talk to me. I know he wasn't ready. Damn, Alex, I'm sorry, I needed answers. If I could call and apologize I would but I promised you I'd never call you unless you called me... what do I do??? Call him. Make an ass, dunno if it would make feel better. Probably not but. I dunno... God I wish Alex could/would read this. It would mean the world for him to know how sorry I am! I need to go to dc so I know I won't be able to call him...I just want him to know I'm sorry. Sorry for everything. Sorry I thought I could help you. Sorry I couldn't sorry for everything bad in your life. Sorry for being one of those bad things. Sorry for wanting... no needing... still do. But I'm learning... hard thing to learn...damn I'm so sorry...So very sorry.

       I haven't really done much in the past couple of days, worked friday. That was fun. Not but oh well. I need to go to the book store I have no more books. I have to go get books for when I go on the plane.  I might go today. Or I might go tomorrow or I might go both days. Considering I get paid tomorrow. My check isn't going to be a lot of money... I'm thinking eighty dollars, maybe ninety but oh well it's okay. Considering I'm going to be on three planes in a five day period I need something to do. I officially don't have anything new to read... Finished the first two books in a 11 book seires... Well got to go... Write later...  Oh yeah, it's father's day and my mom is making it a big deal, because it's the right thing to do. HAHA Considering I can't stand my dad this should be intresting we're actually somewhat getting along. BUT I still think of him as a drunk even though he hasn't dranken anything since october, when he crashed my car into a tree... OH well dinner should be intresting.

      Well I watched Ms. Congeniality (on tv). Then I read. Book is okay... not great but it's good.   Avoiding to think... what a lovely idea. I don't think. I don't snap. I don't snap. I don't call him. Or worse go to my razor...don't think I will ever do that again but you never know. I hope not... I really don't. I don't think. I dont cry. (YAY, brownine point for me!!) I don't know what I want anymore. I mean I know what I want to do with my life... only took me forever. Then I realize it's not worth it nothing is. Beacause you die.  So what's the point if everyone is going to end up dead in the first place?? The sun is going to swallow the earth... maybe in thousand upon thousands of years, but this is all going to end eventually.  Oh... well Just thinking... damn need to quit writing right now. Thinking too much. I thought maybe once I could be happy. I mean I'm happy. But, not really. I can't explain it all I know is that I want something/someone that doesn't want the same thing, or that's what he says. What I feel is always wrong... What I do is always wrong. It feels right... why doest it have to be wrong. I'll never know. But damn I'm sick of being wrong... And damn it hurts too much. AND God fucking Damnit.... oh wait there isn't a god nevermind... I'm just rambling now gunna go.

      Well I was up until... dunno what time but it was early in the morning when I fell asleep, finished the book. It was really, really good. Makes you think. Woke up at  elven-forty... I need to get sleeping straightened out. I've never really had the best sleeping. Don't like sleeping. But I need to gert under control!! But I just can't sleep. Partly because I'm a girl, and I'm having my monthly... partly because my  brain  wont  shutup  So in order to quit thinking read or watch some late night/early morning movies (However you look at it.) Then I eventually passout. But then I dream. Don't like dreaming had another weird dream. Haven't dreamt of Alex in a while... YaY!!!   In other news I can't wait until I see Jason... going to ozzfest. I don't really wanna go to the concert but I do. I dunno. Just don't want to be in crowds I guess. I dunno. I just need to calm down.  I  actually  did laundry... haven't done laundry in I don't know how long. Which means, I have clean clothes. YaY!! Drier just went off... lol!! When I started laundry my mom & dad were out side cleaning something well there was no water my dad yelled at me to stop the washer... He didn't tell me to turn it off he yelled at me. When will he realize yelling at me like I'm a child. Over something that doesn't even matter. I almost started crying... hormones don't you love them!   Going to go now. Take care of laundry...one more load to go!!

      Went to work it was okay, even though andrew was there (jerk that loves to piss me off.) Got off at eight.   Came home played cards with mom and bro...  Now about to watch Sacry Movie 3.  What's so frustrating my mind!! He won't leave my mind. It's driving me crazy. I don't know what to do. I think the only thing that would make me stop wondering/worrying/caring if I called him... Nah, I wish. Maybe I should go watch the movie and quit thinking...

      I talked to Casey last night for like a half hour. I was rifght he's been hanging out with alex/dacie (Joined at the hip... what a surprize.) I felt somewhat better after talking to him. Not much. Then I had cramps couldn't sleep because of it.  Went to the book store picked up a new book about a girl writes in her journal about her eatin disorder... so far so good. I still have two books to read. I need to go to the other book store (not even five minutes away from each other.) But I need to get paid... I get paid the 25, I leave the 27 which means I will have money when I start my airplane journey...  I'm leaving the 27 coming back home for a day going to Atlanta, driving home... duno when  but I'm driving home with my mom Oh JOY!! no.  Need a bigger purse to carry on the plane mine is way, way too small. I need to pack... that's next week... or later this week... or whatever...  Going now... write later... maybe. Probably. We shall see.

      I called Bill, the minute I heard his voice, I smiled... a real smile something I haven't done since I told him not to talk to me talked to him 17 minutes. I didn't call Alex or Casey yet... Don't know why I haven't call Casey. I need to. To make sure he's alive, or in jail. I was so close to calling Alex befored I called Bill. But I told Bill I'd call him eventually. That eventually came sooner than I thought.  I know I sound like some pathetic teenage girl cryiing over a boy, I am. But it's different... like up until I changed my life (not complete yet.) I never once really wanted to feel.  So I pushed everyone away to not feel then came Alex... I didn't want to hide anymore. So I opened up. Told him things I only to my bestfriend, Karen. I hardly knew him but I knew anything I told him he didn't tell anyone nor would he. Then he dhut down on me. I don't know what clicked in his head and he pushed me away. I was determind to fight. I still want to damn. But I know I can't fihgt for him. I promised him was it wrong of me??? I dunno the only person I can ask other than alex is bill. I don't want to drag bill into it but he's all I have other than dacie...there is no way in hell im going to try to talk to her... hell no not when it comes to Alex...

      Well today I woke up wanting to cry, (I hate being a girl.) Just when I thou ght I was done crying over Alex tears clouded my vision. (I haven't cried over him in a while.) I thought about him, yes, but never cried in a couple of days... but man I was OVERLY emotional this morning. Went shoping, that was successful for once. Bought shorts, (Never wears shorts mom is breaking me of my jean-everyday... thingy.) Whatever, bought two pairs of capris, one skquort (sp??)  I read today... go figure. Not done with the second book.  I watched Chasing Liberty, with Mandy Moore, it was an okay movie... All about falling your heart and shit...  wish I could but my heart is always wrong, or lately it has felt that way.  Got in touch with Jason, he lives in VA, we've known each other since we were in diapers so I'm going up to D.C. I thought I'd see him in July. Well, yeah, he invited me to go to the Ozzfest concert. I'll go just because I can hang out with him. I'm already somewhat nervous, haven't seen him in two years. Normally I see him every year. At least once. We email each other all that deal. But in person isn't the same. Sometimes I wish I still lived with VA, and Jason was my bestfriend. I never had a say to move, I was only three... don't think I could do much then again when my dad got the job... kinda had no choice, mom didn't want to move either. 14 years later I'm still here in this hell hole.   I really need to talk to Casey, I have yet to call him, I've been sleeping, when I  want to call him. If I'm awake tonight I'll call him. I guess.   Need help Im so close to calling Alex... just to say hi, but that would break my promise to him, to me... especially to me... I wonder if I should... damn I hate this. I gave him my whole heart because I was sick of hiding who I really was...  Don't know what hurts more... Giving up, (Like I used to) OR fighting until I have nothing left to give because I'm in so much pain. I love him... I fell in love with him in a three day period. Damnit even when I hugged him I felt his heart beat... That was all I needed to fight for him. I still want to but I can't damn I need to talk to bill even though I can't call him either... damn it I dunno... what to do.

Bought a pair of pants at Pac Sun... They're cute.. They're blue... thin capri's.  Then I came home (was supposed to go to the book store but oh well that's tomorrow) Then I went swimming for a while played cards with My bro and his friend. Now I'm here.  We got our air conditioner fixed... it wasn't really broken but needed repair.That was weird.  I woke up at 10:30 fell back asleep woke up at noon... I love sleeping in lol. I'm turning into Casey. I have yet to call him. I just dont want to call him and he be with alex... Speaking of which I still can't get him out of my mind if I'm sitting by myself I think of him. Like his face will just pop up in my mind at weird times of the day... its weird... damn I've never cared so deep about someone...it hurts when they don't feel or fight you on it too...

I don't know if I want to start writing them down... never been able to finish a story...they just drag on and on and on... I'm an okay writer...but I can't find endings... I'm not that great but hey... that's what classes are for. Crossing fingers...  Speaking of which I need to find a college, I might start in December do dual enrollment or start in the summer depends... on everything... mostly money...

      Hi, to all my faithful readers... if I have any. Let's see here. Last night/this morning I couldn't sleep so I read. When I tried to sleep thoughts came into my mind. So I read a lot. I finished my first book tonight. Then a story hit my mind. Kept thinking about that. (Sorta autobiographical because it was based on alex and this whole thing... kind of hard to explan) It was based on the future and we had gone our seperate ways I went to see him. So I slept from six somthing to ten-thirty. Mom woke me up.  I had an appointment with the "skin doctor." That was fun.   Then I went to sam's...fun... that store is huge you could get lost lol. I mean seriously lost. You could also live there. LOL!!   Then we had dinner... fun.. we had chicken, I love chicken. Then I read and listened to country music. (I listen to country when I need to be in a good mood or cheering up...it works a lot.)Lately it's been pretty much all I listen to right now. Going now...

I left to go job hunting. Have to be eighteen to work at both books stores and it pisses me off. Two different book stores and four books later I came home. I got.  "The Lunatic Cafe" and "Burnt Offerings" by:: Laurell K. Hamilton (a seires about Anita Blake, a vampire slayer, or an exicutioner.) But the books aren't in order... then I saw a different "new" seies "Daughters of the Moon" bought the first two books out of ten. I started reading, "The Lunatic Cafe it's really good so far I'm into the sixth or seventh chapter already.  Got a car a Honda CRV I don't really like hondas but this is my fav model or Hondas.

      Well I slept. Today from like 10-11 something to 1:48, dad came home earlier than expected damn... Watched tv. went to work... WAS supposed to work 5-10 I worked 5-8 which pisses me off, but I don't care anymore because I'm job hunting tomorrow... FUN... NO!! Not really but Money (unfortantly) makes the world go round and around and around.  I can't get Alex out of my mind, he's all I ever think about, supposedly it gets better with time. (I don't believe it.) It seems to be getting worse. (Although I haven't given much time into it.)  Haven't talked to Casey, I wonder if he's still alive, or not in jail (because of his father.) Maybe I should call him tonight see how he's doing... Hopefully we can hang out sometime, (SOON, hint, hint.) lol...  Had another weird dream today, although this one seemed insignificant. (Alex wasn't in it... YEAH) Which means I woke up somewhat happy but now I feel empty. I can go exremely happy to extremely depressed to feeling nothing.I Think I'm bipolar?? What do you think? Dunno, we'll see.Maybe I should just live in a pychiatry ward... then I wouldn't have to deal with half this shit...

Then I dropped off a movie off at blockbuster. Got gas. Went home. Now I'm sitting here waiting for my dad togo to wrok (he'll leave around elevenish.) Don't really get along with him.  I get to work today five-ten. Oh Joy, can't complain I need the money. I got my check lat night one-hundred and sixteen!! Okay so I'm broke lol. I need more money... More money issues! unfortantly. Not thinking about that today, I want to be in a good mood today!   I might go to the walmart buy a pair of jeans (needed badly.) Need to save most of my money for gas. Might go to the book store, buy some books. See if there's anything good in there. I could window shop in the mall. Just not going to bring money in the mall. LOL!  Or I might go sleep, sounds good. Sleep! I need sleep. Not really awake yet haven't taken my shower today... I might go crawl in my mom's bed. (I don't know what is even now when I'm 17 my mom's  bed is the best. Maybe because it's my mom's??? Dunno all I know is that I want to sleep so buh bye for now!!

      First thing first... Lightning won the stanley cup!!!  Okay, okay... well I called Alex today at tweleve-thirty asked him if I could come over to give him the note. (which I never really gave... get into that later.) He was pulling weeds lol!! He was talk to Dacie (BITCH!!) and she was complaining. THey were on the phone for about five minutes. (Seemed much longer!)So I sat there listened to the conversation not really caring about it. (I was thinking more than anything.) Then we went in and he did chores I sat there played with pig, (his dog, which looks like a rat, named piggy... what he says anyway.) Then we were listening to the radio (He killed my ear drums!! LOL) And the song The Reason came on half way through I was on the verge of tears. He changed it, but didn't know I was almost crying (He was doing laundry.)  I kept rereading the note debating if I should give it to him... then mark, his step dad came home with the Z. Alex went grocery shoping I went with him... then we were trying to figure out the code for the radio (doesn't play with out code.) but the thing kept saying "Code Wait" then I dropped the note he picked it up and wouldn't give it back... Then we went to the bowling alley fun... I had fun I was making fun of him lol every time he bowled a turkey I kept saying gobble gobble... then I f**ked up his game... for like a frame or two.) Then he went to Bills I left. Got my check...  I CANT DO IT as much as I want to let him go so he can do what he needs I can't do it I don't get it normally I don't care especially when people want to not talk to me or blow me off or whatever I DON'T CARE but now I do... AND I can't do it... I don't know why it's pissing me off...   This morning started terrible I had a weird dream I woke up crying, naturally it was about Alex I was at a park or something and he showed up and he was talking to somebody and then I saw him I went up to him and was like we need to talk well he blew me off, later came over and talked to me, someone (not sure who) interupted our conversation he left, I came and found him and grabed his wrist and pulled him and he was walking behind me and I pulled his arm around me and held it then I let go and he held on for a second let go. We were sitting on a bench and I was like what's the deal? Is it what I think it is? He nodded.  I was like okay bye I hugged him said it wasn't a real hug. Got a "real" hug. and I woke up letting go of him. Long story short I was letting him go.   When I went over there this morning I had EVERY intention of leaving as soon as I gave him the note but I stayed not sure why.... DAMN IT I NEVER DO THIS!!! I DON'T GET IT. I'm not on a different guy every week or anything why can't I let him go!!!

      I walked into the restraunt, there you were I contemplated if I should say hi, I had done this many times when I've seen you, never once did I confront you. It's been years since we said bye. Then, as always I began to wonder, why you never said hi to me. Have you seen me? If so why haven't you said hi? Then, I realized I would never enter your life unless you confronted me. It still brings tears to my eyes. Not a day goes by I don't think of you.  So what do you all think?? Kind of stupid, but oh well...

      Here's What I wrote to Alex... hopefully it won't change again.... or me writing another letter.  ~ Hey Babe! What's up? N2MHJC thinking about everything you've told me. One answer I know you can't nor won't give me, why you feel you need to protect yourself from me. I know, I most likely not ever to get the real answer but I ask you this, is it fair to you? I know you've been hurt, obviously badly, but you gotta know, I'm not the people that hurt you. I am me. I will always be there for you, but I know what you need me to do is leave, and it kills me to even think about it but if this is what I have to do to proove to you, then I will. But if you ever need anything call me! I mean it. But I can't stand there and not do anything because you won't let me. You will always be in my heart that is somethig that won't ever change! Bye... I don't expect you call, but I'm hopeful!  Love ya, ********  Ps. I'm not doing this because I need to, I'm doing it because you need me to!  So what do you all think?? Help!! should I give it to him or keep it... give me feed back!!! (PLEASE!)

      I finally somewhat talked to Casey on the phone, he bowled with Dacie (aka: bitch that ruins everything.)And Alex. I didn't ask anything because I know Casey wouldn't tell me. So Casey has been happy because he hasn't been home. He hasn't seen his dad so he's all okay.   I wrote yet another letter. It was shorter, (don't know how that happened, I wrote more stuff.) Then I just was thinking fell asleep. Two seconds from falling asleep Casey called me. Then I was up for a while then fell asleep. I didn't wake up until eleven thirty. I heard the garage door open. Had a weird dream... really weird. Then I had an idea for a story. (half autobiography half fiction.) I haven't written a story in months... maybe I should. hm...

      I called Alex last night because I really want to say more to him and give him the rock... I know it's a stupid rock but you had to be there to understand. So I'm supposed to see him Monday, I think, I'm not sure.  Went and saw Raising Helen. It was alright not the best movie, not the worst. Mom didn't like it much... oh well. Anyways, I'm going now.

      Never said really what I needed to say. I kept the rock, still sitting in my car. Saw him told him I wasn't going to call him he would have to call me then I asked him if he was going to call me me he said it depends then I asked him if he was protecting himself from me he said yes. What the hell??? What could I'm not that close to him??? Making me think I just want it to be over. DAMN IT I just want oh god!! I can't do this... on the way to the bowling alley I almost hypervenalated on the way over there I was a nervous fucking wreck not a good thing, not a good thing at all. I didn't cry in front of him, didn't cry at all. I almost did. Damn, I don't want this... but that quote keeps coming to my mind. What do I do??? Someone please tell me... I don't know what to hang on to or who can I trust or who if anyone cares... oh wait no one does fuckers!!

      Sometimes I hate my computer. I can't even read what I write because of the lock on my computer it gets frustrating...  I need to talk to Casey!! I haven't had a REAL conversation with him in a while. I wish I could hang out with him he'd make me feel better. I know he would.  I don't want to think about tonight I'm nervous. What if I can't do it. I've already gotten this far!! I hope I can pull through I just wish it was over and done with. Yet, I don't because then I can't see him anymore damn I hate this I want him!  WHY?!?   OH I cut and dyed my hair, it's the shortest its been in YEARS I like it I was a nervous wreck when she was cutting my hair I didn't just get a trim I got it cut.. my hair was to my shoulders now a little past my ears...

      Okay, I called Alex wondering when I can say bye and give him a rock... lol okay, this why it's so hard for me to give it to him.  When we went to the bowling alley (he bowls) to hang out  I thought my car was in park it wasn't so I hit the parking thingy but it shattered into little rocks then Alex was like we're going to keep it as a suviner lol!! well it got lost in my car (which is a mess) well one day it rolled out from under the seat. I know it's stupid but it's all I have of him. I'm going to give it to him.  Well, I like I said I called him asked when I can come over hoping it was then, but he wanted me to come over at four-something I have to go to work. So I'm supposed to meet him at the bowling ally. Bill is going to be there. uh-oh... So now I have to worry about all when I'm at work good thing I'm only working four hours. I need to get this over with...fuck damn. I just want to finish this get it over with. That way I can cry and get it out of my system. And shit... Fuckers. I need to do this now otherwise I won't be able to.

      Damn it... Last night I could really sleep, every time I closed my eyes I saw him. When I finally did sleep I dreamt of him. That it was the last time I vowed to see him and in my dream I asked all the questions I need to ask but probably won't. I know he's sick of my questions. But damn I need answers. What do I say to him?? What was in my dream. There was something about Savage Garden's affirmation cd. I kept saying listen to number 4, and 5 (5 is crash and burn) And I woke up wondering what his answers will be I hope he doesn't bail on me, he's known to do that. But I told him it was the last time. I hope I can keep my promise to myself, how do I do this, I know I'm going to cry in front of him. The very thought of what could of been, should of been but wasn't brings tears to my eyes we were so close why did he have to do this???  why???  Damn I don't know any more...God I wish I could talk to Casey to see him, but shits going on he has enough to deal with. Damn I hate dragging other people into my messes. Part of the reason I don't talk to Bill anymore because I know if I do talk to him (our relationship was pretty much by phone.) All I'm gunna ask him about is Alex. I don't want to do that nor would I want to put Alex through that. I never wanted to drag anyone into this. But before Alex wasn't giving me answers the one person I could go to I didn't nor couldn't trust (because of our past.) She is/was/is Alex's best friend. Which right now I want to strangle her. I won't. I'm leaving now. What do I do?? HELP!

      The Wonders---All My Only Dreams  Every night I pray, I'll have you here someday. I'll count the stars tonight, and hope with all my might. That when I close my eyes, you'll be right by my side. If I could only have one wish you'd be the boy whose lips I'd kiss All my only dreams.   And when I close my eyes, you'll be right by my side. If I could have just one request, stay with me boy I confess.  All my only dreams.  Any waking hour it seems, I only have you in my dreams So every night I pray, I'll have you here one day.  I'll count the stars tonight, and hope with all my might. That when I close my eyes, you'll be right by my side. If I could have just one request, stay with me boy I confess.  All my only dreams.  If you have ever seen the movie the wonders, this song was in the movie... My mom and I were listening to it in the car and by the end of the song I was fighting back tears. That's all I want and I can't have it. The thought of him not in my life just kills me a little more each time I think of it. Which makes NO FUCKING SENCE considering I don't even know him that well. I mean it's not like I known him all my life or anything or that he was even that close to me but I just feel I need to give him what he wants even if I love him. THe quote:: "If you love somebody you have to let them go." I thought that meant in death but as I recently learned it isn't the case. I'm just so worried about him he's killing himself from the inside, although he won't commit suicide.  He's smoking more, a lot, but I smoke but not that much only when I'm around it. And I'm worried but don't know what to do. I don't want to just give up. I don't really think I am but part of me does I want him to be okay to be like he was when we hung out. I don't get it damn. If who he's showing who he really is now who was he showing me in the begining?? I think I'll ask him when I tell him bye. Oh my goodness can't even think about that. I want to cry!!!   No I won't cut but writing down helps... I won't cut ever again!!!

      Lately I've been thinking about getting my own place in about a year or so, (I'll be 18 in January) Which seems like forever away but it's not. I'm one of those people that takes things day by day but lately I've been thinking about which school I want to go to (college for massage therapy)Also my own place. I've been trying to save money now that I h ave a job but I don't get paid that much and all my money goes to gas! I sware. I'm not working that much only two days this week I need more hours I'm going to complain today when I go to work I'm only working three hours to day and four hours tomorrow that's only 7 hours in a week. I don't get it when I started I had 7 hours a day at least but now it's not that much. I need the money I'm going to Washington D.C. Then to Atlanta for family this summer I need money but so far all my money has gone toward my car. It's not my fault my friends live on the different side of town. (Where my H.S is.)I honestly don't know what I need to do. Start looking at different schools, mom heard about this one in Clearwater that has a national licence so I could practice anywhere. (Most are state to state and if I move I would have to get recertified... scary thought.) Although my mom forgot the name of the school and lost the phone number... lol kinda funny I think. My brother wrote it down but they don't know what they did with it. oh well gotts to go.

      Well I mentioned my friend Casey in the previous entry. I refer to him as my little big brother (I'm older he's taller.) He goes to my school (Which is REALLY, REALLY small)from the minute I saw him I knew I could trust him. Although he's now Alex's bestfriend, probably the only person who alex trust right now. But I know if I ask Casey anything about Alex he won't tell me. And  vise versa. I feel kind of bad because he stuck in the middle and I don't want that for him.  Casey is going through some shit I promised not to tell anyone. His parents were fighting and he walked out saw his dad bring back his fist Casey told his dad don't hit her if you hit anyone hit me. Well his dad hit him. So hit him several places put him in the hospital. So now he's avoiding his dad. He hasn't been home in overa week. Just because his dad is there. We haven't really talk in a week but I need to see him to talk to him. I mean I know I could use the phone but I don't like using unless I have to.  God I can't believe I'm giving up on Alex he's the first person to give me hope in a long time. Then he crushed it or tried to but everything I feel for him got stronger how am I going to give him what he wants??? I have no idea considering I'm used to talking to him  every  night before I go to bed. Just so I can hear his voice.

      In response to Cutie::  I wouldn't cut just because of Alex. Nothing really happened. That's the whole point. Maybe I should start at the begining.  One weekend months ago we hung out one weekend. Went well, or I thought so. Then school started (for the week)then ago all hell broke loose he decided to push everyone away I made the desion to fight him have been fighting for him, as well against him. Which I know I hardly knew (or know him) So I don't know why I decided to fight but I did. Every time we take a step forward we take two steps back. So whatever we got to talking last night I decided to let him go.  Called Alex one last time told him I wanted to give him something (the rock) So I'm going over thursday to give it to him. I called Bill he understands. Got I feel empty the only thing I want is/was Alex's friendship and I don't have it.   As for the cutting My bestfriend of three years and I don't talk anymore. Which doesn't bother me, yet when Alex wouldn't talk to me it drove me crazy. The only person I feel I can trust is Casey. (I know I haven't wrote about him. I'm sure I will.) I'm sick of fighting my depression I haven't been this depressed since december which is only a couple of months but still, it's a long time for me. I'm sick of it. I need help but no one that I want help from will because no one cares, they say they do. They don't. That simple.

      I talked to Alex last night, I have decided to let him do what he "wants" to do. I am letting him out of my life. Yes, it's going to hurt yes, I cried, (yet again) but I'm done we did alot of talking. And I realized it's pointless to fight him. I even took him out of my phone in my cell that's how determined I am. I don't understand why. Even though he gave me every explaination in the book. I guess I'm sick of being so close to having something and it be destroyed. If he were to call me and ask me to do something I'd do it for him. But I know he won't because he can't trust me. Damn, I'm going to cry again. Every time I think of him cry. He means the world to me. Which would make sence if I knew him well. But I don't know him, not really and I don't know why. He does, everyone does but me. Gr, damn it I'm so frustrated. But I have to let him go. All I have are memories, and a fucking rock, (don't ask) thats it.  I'm thinking of giving it to him but I don't know what he'd do with it. If he'd throw it out. Or what, I even have to let bill go in order to let Alex go because I know I'd ask  Bill questions about him and I can't do that. I really can't so I have to tell Bill off. Don't want to, but have to. Damn, I want him. That's all I want why did I have to come so close yet, loose everything once again why is it every time!! At least he never lied to me more than I can say about most people!  I'm so close to cutting again... help don't want to cut... but it would ease the pain.
