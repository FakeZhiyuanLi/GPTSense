       So yeah, why not write while wasted? My grammar and spelling should still be good, that's just me, but if you could see how fast I type you'd know something was up. Strange that I get better with alcohol, but mostly I think I revert to my normal/hyper state. Writing this blog is calming me down. Really I just need sleep. Elissa had another date tonight. Some online guy over here. And Brian, her online love, is coming this weekend. The guy that was a large part of her leaving me I think. She thought I'd date before her, but then tried to have sex with random people days after breaking up (or was it the night of?). Anyway, yeah, it'll be a while before I date I imagine, but we'll see.  Maybe Lisa will come into town this weekend and I'll have a distraction from Elissa and whatever crap she's up to. Though I don't much care, her sleeping with some online love may end up bothering me. We'll have to see. Drama is just another challenge for me. I enjoy losing at things because of the challenge  and I've certainly lost a few battles with maturity in the last few weeks. Still... no huge mistakes, so I'm okay. Survive and grow stronger. Nietzsche said "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger", but some real Nietzsche fans always stick the "in war" part in front.  Anyway, the alcohol: tonight Kelly got a call from Matt inviting her over to swim with him. She invited me, Elissa, and Jamay. We went and had some drinks and fun. Matt and his friends are cool. Osama Bin Laden looks like he wants to sleep with me now, so I'm gonna go. Peace out homies.

       Poker night still goes on (though with acarying amounts of people).  I think I can live with Elissa (and Jamay) for the next year and just enjoy their company.  I guess it just depends on how much Elissa keeps being annoyed by everything I do.  I think that will fade.  I still have friends to hang out with.  Kelly, Erin and Lisa have been good company away from the apartment.  Overall, I'm doing really well for being out of a 3 year relationship.  I'm pretty much recovered, didn't do anything really stupid... time to move on.  One more year of school.  Then I will have a job, much less free time, much more money.  I hope I can stay in town and work.  At least to keep some of my friends and the life I've built.  I fear working people.  As I get older it seems the people I meet are more and more dead.  Death approaches quicker than we believe.  It begins to take root in the teens as people learn to act on more than emotions.  Tonight while dropping Kelly off we kinda made faces at and then talked to some girl in the car next to us.  It was fun and exciting.  More people should interact in random places.  Always blows me away how reclusive we are.  Me included.  Anyway, just wanted to say things aren't bad.  Right now the thing I most dread is school starting next week.  That makes this a very normal time in my life.  Thanks to all my friends (probably anyone reading this) for helping me through.

       "People had been working for so many years to make the world a safe, organized place. Nobody realized how boring it would become. With the whole world property-lined and speed-limited and zoned and taxed and regulated, with everyone tested and registered and addressed and recorded. Nobody had left much room for adventure, except maybe the kind you could buy. On a roller coaster. At a movie. Still, it would always be that kind of faux excitement. You know the dinosaurs aren't going to eat the kids. The test audiences have outvoted any chance of even a major faux disaster. And because there's no possibility of real disaster, real risk, we're left with no chance for real salvation. Real elation. Real excitement. Joy. Discovery. Invention. 	The laws that keep us safe, these same laws condemn us to boredom. 	Without access to true chaos, we'll never have true peace. 	Unless everything can get worse, it won't get any better."            -Chuck Palahnuik in Choke

             There's us at our thing. Something a little lighter for the page. I'm the one in the burnt orange. Elissa next to me, Kelly by her, Doug in the pimp hat, Jamay's side... and so on.

       There's a line I heard in a song once that I've never forgotten: If I have to be lonely, I'd rather be alone. I felt that tonight. I mean, technically, I'm sure I felt lonely because of connections others were having that I wish I had. At some level my increased loneliness was a longing for what others had and as such is just immaturity. It also means I would rather not be alone, but rather with these others. Still, the line is right in many ways. Sometimes it's better not to have that thrust into your face.  Detachment. Lisa says it's okay. I think true strength is to face the world and be strong despite the harsh truth. It's an imperfect world though. We can't have our ideals and to some extend we can hide from life until we die or get over the problem.  I am speaking too vaguely. As always. So Elissa, Kelly, Jamay, Kenny, April, and I were hanging at April's new place. They played truth or dare, swam around. My mood wasn't from what was going on so much as just the crap that happened all day (Kelly left abruptly last night and I thought I might have upset her, then I wake up to a sore neck, with not enough sleep, to find out my car window is broken, stereo stolen, and iPod lost all it's music). So yeah, a bad mood combined with hanging out with people doing stuff I'm not so much into anyway. Elissa told me today we just couldn't have mutual "best friends".  She does NOT like me at all, and as such friends can't be around both of us enough to be best friends?  Anyway, seems to me it's up to the other person how they feel about us both.  Kelly and Elissa can be best friends without it changing the fact that I still care for and respect Kelly just as much.  It would merely mean Kelly spends more time with Elissa and I should be happy for her.  Like if she had a date that went well and was falling in love.   A little easier with a date than my ex, but same idea.  This is way too sad. I am so upbeat normally. I am more aware of freedom that people have, and as such feel more confident. I'm called arrogant for it, but I feel that all peopole have such power over their lives. It's not a "me" thing. Since I feel more powerful than most, they think I feel more powerful than them. I guess. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe everyone else is right. Often they are.  I need new people in my life. I have so much positive emotion and love and everything in me, and it's killing me having nothing to do with it. It's not a good place to need others though. I need to come back to reality and be complete in and of myself. I've already put too much energy into Kelly out of my loneliness and I can see it bugging her sometimes. So much of our moods and ideas about things relates to little things we do. The constant flirting between everyone around me lately bugs the shit out of me. I've been a slight part of it too and that also bugs me. When I detach from it, I simply feel lonely. The group mentality and pressure is a bad influence. It's one of the many reasons I relate better to people one on one. Or maybe I'm just bad in groups. Sounds like I'm insecure.  I don't think I'm insecure. I think I want so badly to have friends I imagine I am close to people sometimes. I imagine things that aren't. Sometimes for me love is that feeling where you know you and another person put each other above the rest of the world. Maybe you can only love one person at a time and it's a ton more than what you feel for anyone else. I had it once. I never trusted/knew Elissa well enough to have quite that. There was always that doubt in the back of my mind that kept me from feeling truely secure and in love. I mean, there are moments where you feel all that, but the long term wasn't just that perfect trust and happiness.  I feel miserable. I need something to fix it. Understanding would be nice. Mostly I'm just telling myself it's because I'm lonely and that doesn't help. I can't go make friends right away. I can only understand that I'm where I need to be and have hope for the future. But I'm miserable, aka I don't understand and have that hope. I see that I don't really have people that notice or fill my voids and that I am not big on meeting new people. It's a goal, but not one I feel confident enough in to grasp hope and happiness yet. The patience game is best played with anticipation, not dread.

       So I wake up exhausted with my neck hurting to a phone call from the vet to go get Romeo cause he swallowed a hook.  I go out to my car and see my window broken and my stereo stolen.  Stupid me for not putting it in its case last night.  Anyway, that's my morning.  I hope I have the money to fix the window and get a new CD player.  I will try to wipe my harddrive and hope my laptop works today, but I think it's dead.  Too bad I don't have a birthday or something coming up so I can get a new laptop.  I don't think I can afford one otherwise.

       So I think there's just one problem between Elissa and I.  It was the problem in the relationship and continues to be the problem whenever I try to help.  She is a door closer, and me a door opener.  Once we shared an open house, but it wasn't like Elissa to be that way, she was just giving in for me.  After 3 years she decided to shut a door.  Any attempt by me to clean up that area was an attack and she has hated me for trying to help since.  Even before we began dating we were falling in love and becoming closer.  I relate to people by looking into them and finding out who they are.  Lisa says I see into people's spirits.  That is pretty much what I think but with a different label.  Anyway, Elissa was in love and letting physical or emotional ties bend her.  She's always let things bend her person.  She became what she thought I wanted her to be for a long time.  When she started closing off sections of herself again, and I started trying to help her open back up with the person she said she loves, it was viewed as an attack.  She became defensive and started to lie.  Suddenly the room was closed for termite inspection.  Later she told me it wasn't closed, it was removed and that was really just a back door.  The lies began shrinking what we had together.  After 3 years, as both friends and lovers, of roaming around together in that emotional house, I just didn't understand.  I tried to get in and fully love again.  I tried to get to her problems and fix them.  I was met with lies.  Now that we're broken up, I am still me, pushing away.  There's still that comfort for me between us for some reason.  But no more lies.  She's open to hating me for it now.  That book is closed and I need to stop reading it.  It's so hard when she's sitting there saying she's lonely and has nobody to talk to, then yells me head off for doing exactly what she needs.  I need to stop pushing open the doors of truth.  Because I know she won't start opening them again.

       Okay, headache and such. It's not been easy being back. I don't want to talk much about other people on here. I am open about my life, but not sure I have the right to reveal other people's. Though they're the people that read this. Anyway, I'll get to this later too. Life was not so good when I got back. Need to remember to do the foreign love word blog too. Okay, this, too, will be edited.  Lissa is more active. It seems she is all over Kelly (emotionally) because Kelly was her friend first and I am hanging out with Kelly more now. It's not even really about Kelly. That shocks me. I mean, Elissa's immaturity shows she still cares about me, but she doesn't act it at all. She merely gets mad at me for everything I do. I'm really really trying to be nice. I always mean well. She says I say cruel things though. Doesn't matter what I mean, she says I shouldn't beat her up like I do. A joke about Monday Football being a fun thing to do was one such annoyance. I don't get it. She is completely running from all her feelings. She refuses to think about things. Maybe I was the only influence in her life that led her to question things. Anyway, it's not looking good. And as much as there is some immature side that wouldn't mind her tearing herself apart, I will be living with her. Times are weird. I'm still not sleeping. But thanks Lisa for giving me something to do while not sleeping in Houston. I don't have anyone with me here, it was a nice change.  Yeah, it's later now.  Still not into editing or fixing, so this'll stay like this.  Lisa says write more about how I feel, but it seems I've reverted back into talking about others.  There's less in my again.  At least, less than I need to think through.  I have the usual controlable emotions now.  Just gotta diversify and move on with my life.  Do more productive things.  Have a greater variety of friends to lean on.  I like the friends I have and they're enough, but it's not the most stable situation ever.  We'll see what happens.  The patience game is not my forte.

       Yeah, I'm tired and outside and stuff, so this entry is just a reminder to write about this topic. This will be edited or something later. I went to Houston to get away. My relatively good mood continued. It was nice talking to Erin on the way there and back. I didn't get to see her much besides that. Lisa was great. I had a blast throwing ideas at her and really making headway into what's going on in my life. She was very kind and I had a great time at her place all weekend.  Wow, okay... it's later and I'm still too lazy to write about it.  Good sign maybe.  Writing flows well from problems and moods.  I'm not in a writing mood anymore.  This blog may die one day soon.  Or maybe I'll get internet and be more able to write.

       It was a pretty good day today.  That is strange.  Good of course.  If I could always be happy even when horrid things happen to me I would take it more as a sign of maturity or luck than bad form (unlike most people).  Still, with so much pain the last couple days, and it being so soon... I just wonder what happened.  Lack of sleep, or I'm just pretending it didn't happen?  I don't know.  Elissa is still a ghost.  Always online, not energetic, barely able to detach herself from the internet.  I wish she were happier or more outgoing, even if not towards me.  Maybe it was the fear of losing the friends and lifestyle that hurt more than the relationship.  Sounds bad to say, but it may have been true.  And getting to hang out with Kelly and see Elissa able to be around me (as well as she can be around anyone not online) was heartening I guess.  I hope my days continue in this way.  I would like to make the most of my weeks before school begins.

       Okay, well I've been living with Elissa for two years now. I'm in my final year at UT and have very little money. I found a great two bedroom apartment near school with Elissa and Jamay. It's best to get away after a break-up, but without an easy way to do that I'm gonna try to fight it out for now. Jamay and I changed rooms. We'll switch rents now that I get my own room and I'll try to be roommates with Elissa. This is will interesting to say the least.  I do always seek greater challenges. I will learn to understand myself and control my emotions better than ever. Or I will fail again. I am not often a weak person, but I hope to keep from doing anything really stupid. Whether that's getting jealous, getting feelings for Elissa again, or what, I don't know yet. It'd be interesting to move in with some other friends if anyone else needed a roommate or was moving, but I'm not sure Elissa and Jamay could afford this place on their own.  Okay, so there's some more details I figured anyone not familiar with my story should know. The breakup was like 2 days ago. The relationship lasted almost 40 months. We'll see how long recovery takes. Living with an ex is a BAD idea, but we'll see how that works too. The lease just began and lasts through next summer. I won't have a job or income until next fall (have to graduate and take the bar first). So yeah, I hope I can preserve all the friends and social stuff Elissa and I have built/enjoyed together over the last few years. It is very lonely being single.  If these blogs seem somewhat upbeat for a recent breakup (cause they are), I'm in my first good mood for days. I think it's just becuase I've not slept but a couple hours in days.

       Well, I wonder how much trouble I can get into doing this.  I will try to be careful with my words so that people understand my true intents.  I believe anyone really knowing what I feel wouldn't be insulted or feel bad.  I really do intend to help everyone in everything I do.  Okay, so my girlfriend of 3 years dumped me.  OKCupid says she's "The Sudden Departure."  I said the same thing when I met her (not in those words).  It's best to be out, but still very hard.  I was lied to for a long time and I'm trying to deal with how I could let someone treat me like that.  It's not real love when people hide themselves from you.  I don't always blame others.  In my first relationship I just didn't know what went wrong until a year later.  By then I figured I'd been starting fights because I was afraid of commitment.  I made things lousy until she broke up with me.  If I'd known that I could have gotten past it.  Now I'm much more introspective.  Also, I wondered a long time how such deep love as I had back then could go astray.  I thought true love just meant people would last forever.  I learned since then to fight to make relationships work.  So yeah, after that first relationship of a couple years, I was single a long time.  It was a slow recovery.  Then I met Elissa and thought I shouldn't date this person, but I hadn't had anyone else to date for years.  She was flirty and we finally got together despite a rough start.  So yeah, I was improved from my last relationship, but it was too much.  I was all about staying and fixing problems.  I didn't pay attention to when one should leave a relationship.  I let her do horrible things to me without ending it as I should have many times.  So now I'm going to try to be more balanced.  We'll see how that works.  Okay, well my penchant for getting off track is pretty clear now.  I wanted to open this entry by saying Elissa dumped me so I'm starting a new life, and Kelly has been an amazing inspiration to me in tough times.  I wish I had more creative people around me, but, well maybe I just wish I had her around more.  Okay, see I'm already hating saying stuff like that.  Grew up too male?  I don't know, but... yes, losing track again.  So yes, new life, inspired by muse to write.
