      Welcome to this, this  thing.   Apparently I can type things, and they will show up here.  I can also post pictures, if the need be.  Neat.  First things first, a little background.  Why did I make this?  Over the past couple months, I've always needed an outlet to write, share things I find interesting, or pretend people read this.  If you  do  happen to stumble across this, feel free to leave a comment.   What can you expect from here?  I'm bound to post anything I find interesting or amusing, or if I feel like saying stuff.  I usually try to keep up with games, technology, and  other people.   There will be no set dates as to when I post something new, or something  worthwhile  for that matter.  Why not LiveJournal?  To tell you the truth, I don't really care for LJ.  I certainly don't have anything  against  it, it's just that I have a neat little button in my browser that  just so happens  to let me post about a website, but this feature is only for BlogSpot, so there you go.  Also, this service is a lot more pleasing to the eye than LJ's monotone colors and rough edges, isn't it?

      It pretty much sucked.  Hellboy didn't kick as much ass as he should have, first of all.  Now, I haven't read the comics, but they tried to tie in a love plot, which didn't work.  Out of all the supernatural  freedom fighters,  Hellboy was practically the lamest.  Except for the evil demigod, though.  He was gay.   I think you should see this movie, but only until somewhere around the end.  You see, despiute having the most awesome villain  ever,  the movie didn't really deliver.  I'm talking, of course, about the nazi clockwork assassin.  He looked the coolest, had the best  weapons,  and was bulletproof.  If he got bored with ripping apart everyone with his handheld blades, he would just deflect bullets with is face/blades.   Awesome.   Also, he was very good at striking dramatic poses, and only when it was required, he didn't overdo it like some people.  I found a picture of him, but it didn't do him any justice.  I edited it as I saw fit:    But honestly, he is  bad ass.   He looks devilishly slick in his black trenchcoat, gas mask, and German commander's cap.  The movie would be infinately better if it was just him sneaking around and killing people.  Perhaps stopping to kill some monsters, and then some zombies, but then back to the people.  He could laugh in a German tongue at their attempts to stop them.   Best villain ever.   It just didn't revolve around him as much as that camera hog Hellboy, that is my only complaint.  I mean, if the movie was called  Nazi Clockwork Assassin,  and it was just about him kicking ass, it would get a 5/5.  But no, he get's killed near the end, and you should stop watching there.  Just turn it off.  I'll give it a 3/5, for the nazi clockwork assassin.  EDIT:  Hmm.  Turns out his name was Carl.  In other news, the original Power Stone for the Dreamcast is the best fighting game ever.
