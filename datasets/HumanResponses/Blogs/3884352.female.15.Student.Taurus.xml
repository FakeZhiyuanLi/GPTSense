      ...so after him telling me he didn't love me anymore i was completely freaking, it just happened so suddenly i had no idea, i mean he had been talking about how much i meant to him like 4 days before this whole thing. So i talked to him about it and i was like i just want you to be happy, but i do love you, and i was waiting for the right time to tell you..im so sorry i was just so worried about other things i didn't even notice, and then he started making more sense and was like im sorry i was just wanting to get it out so badly that i was confused about us that it came out wrong..and i just made the worst mistake ever..i still love you, god im stupid...so i forgave him right away cuz i loved him and didnt' wanna let go...so he was like let me just think this out...so i was like yea go ahead hun..cuz i figured he just needed to straighten himself up cuz he was upset..then the next night thinking everything was fine he goes "im confused still" and i was like wait but last night u said it was a mistake and u still loved me....he was like i dunno i was just confused...i mean he was being so unclear! everything just fucking was helpless! and then hes like but i still wanna be friends..and i was like yea thats fine...so i tried being "friends" but he like stopped talking to me and shit...i mean AHHH he was so frustrating..hes like well i thought u were mad at me i was like well yea i was pissed but i don't wanna lose u! we talk like every day for hours, ur what gives me that boost to wake up in the morning...so i still tried making and effort to talk every now and then but its like he doesn't want to..i dunno..and then his away messages are directed towards that girl...like winking smiley faces and shit, he even made point to tell me they were for her..then i found out he got head from her on the 4 of july..im like wow how wonderful not even a week after u break my heart and ur already hitting it wit that girl...and telling my friends about it! just he sent me a letter when we were close teling me how much i meant to him..and he would write me songs, and i always thought i would be the one that broke it off if anything..so thats why it just seems so weird...like i'd like to think he still has feelings for me, but i hate bringing it up or asking cuz its like i push him farther away when i do and i don't wanna lose him even more...but now i mean its like i've lost him so im just trying to find the right words to what i want to say, and i'll do it...i just need the right time..like it looks like hes going out tonight, prolly fuck around wit that girl, so i'll talk to him when he gets home...i mean he told me once that if we weren't so young he'd wanna marry me..and i kno this all sounds like it was just a corny mushy relationship..but if u were in my position and had someone u really cared about saying it to you it'd seem important...and he isn't the type to just throw that out there.  I want to move on but i can't find a guy, im so shy and hate flirting cuz i feel like i'll be rejected...all the guys that like me i don't like back it SUCKS...haha i want ot move on but all i really want is him..even tho he hurt me so much i dunno...and yea i kno people don't usually get lucky on their first love and stuff..and that teens always feel like "oh this is going to last forever" its just the way that it ended that keeps me up at night and thinkign about him all the time...it just never really ended...it was full of i dunno's...god if i was really gorgeous and skinny this would be easy..i could be like yea fuck u too..and go find some hot guy at the mall haha but nope..im like trying ot find a way to hold on to that one jackass that stumbled upon me...i wish i had told how much he meant to me when i have the chance..hmm...o well...i just wish i didn't care so much and i don't want to...but that doesn't change the fact he broke my heart...guys suck haha

        Alright..hey, im 15 from NH and theres never anything to do around here...i love my friends to death, theres mainly just 6 of us that are real close and hang out...then i have a few bestfriends that don't love my lil group of girls so we hang out on the side...haha "highschool drama". And well its finally summer and i had been looking forward to it up until the last week of june...this guy i had been really good friends wit for a year..and we'd finally started saying i love you in january cuz he realized he "loved" me during xmas break, well he started acting different. He lives in another state but i kno him thru his cousin, and i mean we were realllllly close (notice the "were" part) and we dated for a month back in march but i broke it off saying it was meaningless cuz we never get to see each other..and he understood, no hard feelings. So i was all stressed out the end of may beginning of june cuz of finals, my first time taking them, and i had told him i might act a lil distant cuz of having my head off thinking about those and he was so cute about it, hes like well i'll try and make u as happy as i can..i was like awh thanx...so finaly im done wit finals all the stress is somewhat gone, cuz i still didn't kno my grade, and i had to go away a few days after i got outa school for my brothers graduation..then right when i got hom i went away for a week wit a friend for a lil vacation..which i needed SO much...and i usually questioned my relationship wit this guy just cuz well he was such a sweetheart but i never knew if i really loved him cuz he was my first love so i wasn't used to the feeling...so during this trip my head was clear and i thought it all out and i was positive i loved this guy, and i had been wanting to tell him exactly how much he meant to me but my head was all over the place and i wanted to do it at a good time so i decided to wait...when i got back from my trip he was acting a lil different..but i figured it was just cuz he had been busy that whole week and stuff...then he told me how he had a fight wit one my friends about how much i mean to him, and how he would do anyhting for me..and i was like awhh really and hes like hell yea! and me and him usually talk till like 2 in the morning but we started kinda not having much to say..our convos were somewhat dead...then a few days later he was like alright i've lost my feelings for you...back a lil before school ended i thought u lost ur feelings for me so i silently delt wit it and lost mine for you, and i didn't bring it up...hes like and u were away so i wasn't sure exactly how u did feel towards me...then when u were wit ur friend i kinda started to like another girl..nothing serious..but mainly what i want to say is..i don't love you anymore...(okay u can go to the next post for the rest of this bullshit)
