      Hey everyone..sorry my blog kinda died. As most of you know I had a japanese student staying with me for a week. And due to lack of sleep I really havent been able to get ontop of doing this.  Well, we brought our students to the airport at 4am yesterday..I cried alot, Im gonna miss them soooo much, I am going to see them in 10 days anyway! But still, they are such awesome people. But Ive been staying up till the wee hours of the morning lately cuz my sleep schedule is really thrown off, thanks noel...lol jk...you know i love talking to you.   But i have to work tomorrow...at the bayview from 830-2, then i have a japan fundraiser from 230-430, then jake is coming over at 5. So im gonna be pretty busy tomorrow. but i really have nothing left to write...and im busy talking on msn messenger... So laterz... love espresso

      I was just watching the news and it said something like, too much caffeine can lead to that 'its on the tip of my tongue' feeling, where you cant remember certain words right off the bat... oh well, i love coffee... and i have an excuse to forget things, cuz im blonde. lol. well today was pretty kuel cuz i got to hang out with my canadian friend whom ive been tight with forever and havent seen in 2 years because of crazy situations. it was really fun. But today was a really pretty bad day after that. i dont wanna bore with details. so ya. im so bored right now, im staying with my grandparents because all the rest of my family is out of town. so ya, its really boring, but im gonna go to bed cuz i have to babysit tomorrow for like, 8 hours! ahhh.  love espresso&nbsp;

      Here's the occurences of the day...  &nbsp;This morning i went to work with my dad in sequim, everything went smooth, kinda, and i left around three. When i got home i went to my friend Bekah's house and before i left my dad told me go to bekahs then go to the bayview then go back to her house and call if any plans change.&nbsp; well i left bekahs house around 7 pm and headed towards the bayview.&nbsp; well, we drove past and it was really busy with no place to park, so i called my dads cellphone, no one answered, then i called home, noone answered, then i called my moms cellphone, no one answered, then i called my dads cellphone and left a message telling him we were gonna go eat at elevated.&nbsp; so there, i called and said what i was gonna do.&nbsp; well, i always park at swains no matter what im doing in town, cuz its a pain parking anywhere downtown.&nbsp; so bekah and i walked to elevated.&nbsp; we got jelly beans instead of eating anything.&nbsp; we started walking back up to my car when her parents walked outta the belmont.&nbsp; we talked for a little bit and said we were going back to her house, which we did.&nbsp; as soon as i walked in her door&nbsp;my dad calls me and tells me to get home right away, cuz i didnt call or something like taht, well i told him to check his voicemail and all the other caller id's at the house and my moms cellphone. well he went quiet for a minute then was all ' umm...get your butt home RIGHT NOW.' and started making up some other excuse about me being in trouble. well i headed home and then got a talking to and my parents started saying i never called and that bekahs parents were furious with me (all of which are NOT true) and stupid stuff. I got my car takin away till the 20th then along with that restricted driving privliges and crap.&nbsp; but oh well...it will all soon be over cuz im almost 17. i hate stupid ppl and they all keep breeding. oh well.&nbsp; thats my story and tune in next time for the tragic life of a runner who never was...lol.
