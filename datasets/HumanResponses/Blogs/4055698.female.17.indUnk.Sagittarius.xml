        ok so we skipped multimedia computer lecture the day before yesterday. haha.. I mean the lady lecturer is fucking boring.. How can she not noticed we were dozing off during her lectures?! We kinda imagined what if she has a boyfriend.. Damn...!! He's sure to yawn yawn yawn.. wahaha..  It was actually kinda obvious and funny how we walked out of the lecture theatre. Fad was like, "Wanna go?" We were like, "You serious?" Then she started rushing out without giving us any signal and the whole of this pathetic hopeless bunch followed her from behind.. haha.. I bet she noticed us.. But what the heck..?! We clocked in way earlier than the rest and Shane, the gorgeous guy.. signed attendance for us.. haha..  Java Programming Lab now, and i don't know shit. Ish.. i would prefer maths lecture than this shit. It's shitting me.. Working this evening but thought of telling my supervisor i got night class. I'm having major headaches every now and then, and unpredictable fevers. Aiya.. Sick sick sick..! But don't ever tell me to see a doctor because the medicine is just for show and the amount i have to pay is emptying my bank account.. haha.. not worth just for an mc..!   Meeting him today would be nice.. heh.. missing him like he's a thousand miles away..........

       8 minutes more to lecture class....  My first blog ever and I'm trying to find words to fill up the empty spaces.. I know i suck at this. heh.. Been visiting people's blog and i envy them for writing such an interesting and long entry. So i thought why not try it myself.. Who knows, i might just improve my english a little more especially when we don't have to write composition in my course. Ok, so 2 more minutes to lecture class and i better log off now before i get left behind.......

       woah.. i'm becoming so emotional nowadays.. I shed a tear listening to dayu's story about her friend who was molested by his own best friend.. yes.. it's a him!! And after that he was whacked and humiliated like some dog on the streets. I symphatised him so much! He's seeing a psychiatrist now.. and he may not be in ite bishan anymore even if he's well. Sheesh! I'm feeling for him though i don't know him. He must have been going through such depressing life for one year now.. and keeping it to himself is so so hard and hurting.. God!Dayu said he was so scared even to the slightest sounds like footsteps.. and his face looked so pale.. standing at the other corner of the room, far from everyone else.. calling only Sarah, dayu's friend to accompany him. His parents came after that and brought him to the hospital. haiz.. Everyone noticed his change in behaviour though.. but no one has any idea that he is going through a major problem. And Dayu regretted for completely ignoring him. Haiz.. It's ok dayu.. He's gonna be ok.. Lesson learn....... Take time to ask.. Take time to notice.. Take time to listen.. And of course...... treasure the people around you.... I suddenly feel so lucky having such beautiful people around me.. Thank you for caring and loving me even if i don't give anything in return..  I love you mama.. ayah..  Thank you for being there whenever i needed you.. I'm gonna make you proud one day.. Oh.....! How i love them..  I sounded like some artist thanking their fans... haha.. but seriously i really do mean whatever i said..anyways.. i was so slenge today..!! I thought i had to go to work today.. so i went to take the train to woodlands.. But everyone had to alight at yishun so i alighted.. heh.. then kebetulan shah was on the way there from school.. met him at yishun platform.. with his school uniform and all.. you still look great dear.. heh.. so we took the train again to woodlands.. So i reached Sanur Restaurant and guess what?! I checked my roster and my name wasn't there!!!! WTF! waste of money and time.. i could have slept the whole evening just now.. haha.. daya slenge! Tomorrow baru betol2 working.. Tomorrow's siti's birthday.. Sorry girl.. i can't make it.. I'll catch up to you some other time ya.. promise!! We'll do what we do best... shopping!! haha..  Hey..  Happy Anniversary baby!!!  It's been 4 months already.. So much things has happened.. I hope we can celebrate more anniversaries together..!! heh.. muackz..

          In school now.. Going to have practical test later.. sigh.. Didn't have time to study at home yesterday cause abg came over to print some stuff for his open house invitation card. Couldn't get it done though cause i didn't know how to actually print it on the perfect spot.. tried a gazillion times but of no use. He's coming over again today to finish up the thing but i don't think i'll be home cause he's picking me up and probably we'll go somewhere.. We're ok now i think.. probably it's that time of the month.. heh! Oh.. how i miss him.. heh..

        He's not helping me.. Last saturday's outing with him and his friends was the lamest and boringest day i ever had.. Felt so left out and still am. Not only that.. he even said something so hurting. I'm so trying to be cool about it.. I'm sorry for creating a scene in front of your friends. I know they would think of me as some snobbish, stuck up girl.. I'm sorry i'm your gf.. I'm sure you're sorry too. Don't take advantage of me because i'[m daya.. i can be a vixen for all i care i just don't want to show that side of me. But if you have drained out the patience in me.. I'm so sorry to have you see that side of me.... sigh..

        Dayu cried after pouring out her feelings. It's so unneccessary for munshi to say those hurting words to her. It's better for him to just keep quiet sey. Fucking hate him already! Never did appreciate what dayu got him for his birthday last sat.. ish! I hate break ups and make ups! ahaha! Shah read my blog yesterday night.. heh.. sigh! No more secrets between us i guess.. heh.. baby baby.. Invasion of privacy you know! heh.. Baby, if you're reading this.. i wanna tell you i'm sorry for betraying your trust.. I promise i'll do my best to win back your trust and make you love me more.. heh cey! And sorry for not expressing myself with you well.. You know i hate talking when i'm mad.. (Abeh tak tau..pujuk ah) haha! Can't wait to see you later before work..    So tomorow's lined up will be fun i bet.. We're invading Sentosa!! wahaha.. Hoobastank will also be performing at Sentosa tomorrow.. hmmm... what to wear eh? heh.. bikini? swimming costumes? wahaha.. let me see now........ heh..   Talked to siti yesterday..

We had dessert at Swensen's.. haha... She treated us.. Sape taknak.. heh.. But we kinda paisey ah.. She created a mini scene at Swensen's when  one of the staff spilled mayonaise all over me.. sheesh! Lucky for me i was wearing black top.. shah and i was cool about it but wadi.. haha.. if it weren't for her i don't think we could have gotten the complimentary ice cream.. Delicious!! haha.. Free of charge lah katakan.. ahaha! Anyways, hanging out with her was fun.. we took pictures and stuff. She's like my not-so-close-childhood friend.. heh.. We went separate ways after that..Sat somewhere to sort of sort things out between us.. heh.. He was serious though. ish! hate it when he's serious and upset.. buruk! heh..   But i love the way he always end things with a smile when it's time to go home....

I know you're jealous and all but baby.. i'm not fooling around with you.. trust me.. (mcm kenal jek) heh..Peace! The fireworks was spectacular man!!

       Fuck the fucking taxi driver. Not to insult taxi drivers out there or whatever.. ( hey even my dad is a full time taxi driver) but come on.. there's no need for you to fucking horn the car when here i am trying so hard to reach to the next lane. wtf!! Spoil my fucking mood early in the morning.. whatever.. 'medical guy' asked for my number yesterday. Told him about it and he's boiling mad at me yesterday night. I don't understand why it's wrong to give numbers to people.. I mean it's not like we're gonna do anything stupid oh whatever the fuck. Super lame! I bet he's gonna bring up this subject when we meet later. Reason being, he's fucking jealous..not that he don't trust me, he doesn't trust the guys.. Either way, it's still the same boy. Well, baby.. see you later.. Please don't show me the pathetic face of yours when you're mad at me.. I'd rather not see you than seeing your red face.. heh.. Read the punk guy blog just now and surprisingly he's a soft peace punk. Not a violent punk.. heh.. I don't know.. he's actually different from all the other punks..haha. Nice chatting with you punk boy. Looking forward to talking face-to-face.. heh.. And and............. I'm looking forward to this monday's outing with the girls!! Hey, it's NATIONAL DAY!! haha.. Mari kita rakyat Singapura sama-sama menuju bahagia.......haha.. miss those days....

         Fucking sleepy..!! i've got the eyebag and black dark circles under my fucking eyes lately.. So much of 'beauty sleep'. Well, what did i do ey? Obviously i didn't get much sleep. Yesterday was the only happiest day of the week. Off day! Pay day is around the corner. haha. Reimbursement of 300 bucks!! Hooray hooray.. though this month's pay is not as much cause gotta study and work at the same time.      Went to the gym after school yesterday. Feel so umcomfortable around body built guys. haha.. But they were hot! And i was 'hot' at them for making us wait around like some stupid bunch. Well, whatever! Now that i can go to the gym anytime i want, I'm gonna make muskels.. haha!      Shah picked me up with his uncle's van from school after the gym orientation session. heh. He suddenly looked so macho in van. haha.. Eating at Prata House at thomson made me so full. I just don't get it why eventhough we consumed the same amount of food, i still can't finish my portion. Not once.. there is the Pastamania.. Beach Road meal.. man! But when it comes to Mushroom Swiss Double.. just can't get enough of it.. haha..      Talked to the 'medical guy' this morning before lab. He's soo cute! Will get to see him later after lab. haha.. Positive!      So have i told you, dayu broke up with munshi? This Saturday is mun's birthday and i know exactly how she feels right now.. They were, i thought by far, the perfect couple. What happened to their 8 months of courtship? I feel so upset and sorry for her that she has to go through this shit.. And i hate munshi for doing this to dayu. I know i can't say it's mun's fault totally but he's making me hate him for hurting dayu so much.. No matter what dayu, i want you to know, eventhough i seem like i don't care.. deep down inside i actually do. I just don't know how to console you in time like this because i, too, has so much on mind right now.. Dayu..... just know that you're the best twin that a twin can ever get.... ;)

I'm not in favour of that!But work is work.. Today is like the only day in this week that i'm not working. Fuck..no time for myself this week. Got a new computer and haven't got the time to browse through the guide book.. haha.
