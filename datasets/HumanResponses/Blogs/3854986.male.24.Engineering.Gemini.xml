      Hello All;     So today it is really, really raining outside.  But at the same time, it's really quite bright.  One of those weird combinations where the wind drives rain a huge distance before it hits the ground, right into a nice sunny area.  It's like nature got up in the morning and decided it REALLY wanted water today, and then all day the sun's been taunting it, like "You call THAT rain???  How about some freekin' clouds?"     Stacey, the focus of all of my passion, and conveniently my girlfriend who returns my affections, will arrive for the week-end tomorrow.  I plan on letting her know that I have started a weblog, and thus facing the inecitable litany of truth:  Mention anything private and die.  You see, Stacey is a very private person.  Gorgeous, brilliant (I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet I'm not allowed to actually LIST her GPA, but trust me.... Wow.), witty, funny, did I mention gorgeous???  Oh, and shy, private, compasionate to a fault and absolutely without a single doubt capable of extreme levels of bitter silent fuming.  That's right, she just keeps it bottled up, in preparation for the eventual homicidal rage.  Maybe I won't tell her I've started a weblog....  not quite yet...  *WARNING*WARNING*WARNING*WARNING*WARNING*WARNING*WARNING* The following is HIGHLY technical, and may even run the risk of educating some members of the audience.  You have been warned.  IE: Stop here if you aren't interested in the Engineering part of this blog.     Today I'm working on a vibrational analysis of an open web steel joist (owsj) and concrete deck floor.  Basically, an owsj is the kind of long and flat steel tube network structure you typically see as the principal roofing members in best buy, costco, futureshop, any grocery store with industrial ceilings; basically anywhere you've got a relatively new high ceiling industrial style building.  They are also the floors that gave firemen the inspiration to start saying "Never trust a truss".  Simply put, a truss is any triangle based structural member created with efficientcy in mind.  We (ie: Structural Engineers) use these kinds of members to carry loads accross greater spans (distances between supports) without having to use really heavy beams (horizontal type members that are typically solid and relatively heavy).  You can look at it this way:  Take a ruler, and place it between two supports so that it spans the gap.  it sags, right?  If you turn it on it's side (and hold it up, I'm not expecting a magic trick here) it doesn't sag...  but it's alot deeper (total height of the section top to bottom) than it was.  If you wanted it to be stable (ie: capable of keeping itself from falling over), you'd have to make it wider or brace it.  Now, there's actually alot of wasted material in that ruler... we could cut circles out of it, and that would work... but there would still be alot of wasted material.  By cutting triangles out of it, we'd be optimizing the design.  We could cut and cut until we get to a point where there is just enough material to meet the design requirements.  We don't actually build them by cutting sections out, rather we just connect tubes together in the shape that we need them, but you get the idea.     Now, let's think about temperature for a second...  What happens when your average material gets hot?  What happens when it gets cold?  Good example:  plastics.  A typical plastic with get softer and softer the hotter it gets.  Ever seen something made out of plastic that melted because it was left on the dash of a car with the windows closed in the summer?  Well before it melts, goes through a range of soffening, where it gets weaker and weaker... and in fact the melting is just a consequence of the material getting so weak that it can no longer hold its shape against the pull of gravity.  Et voilà!  We have warped sunglasses.  Well the same thing happens with the steel in the owsj.  We do have reserve strength (for safety against unexpectedly high loads, like a wedding you hold at home or a big snowstorm in the case of a roof) but no amount of reserve strength will help forever.  And, sadely, in the case of a fire (where temperatures can reach unbelievably high levels) and industrial buildings (built specifically to be as efficient [read: low-cost] as possible) the owsj often fail in fires.  Hence we have the coloquial wisdom of the firefighting profession:  Never trust a truss.     Now, vibrations (our topic that I started with) are also a big problem with long span owsj, and I have to get back to my current issue with this one.  Till next time...

      So I've gone and created a weblog.  Time will tell if it is a monster.  I'm going to be posting a fairly detailed Bio of myself, and as such this post will be short and to the point.  This post is going to tell you why I am creating a blog...  As soon as I can figure that out.    The only reason I can find is that I am fundamentally a very social person, who has a large and well established network of friends who he has just moved away from.  That's right, I have relocated.  Although not born in, I was raised for the majority of my life (4 years and up) in our beautiful National Capital Ottawa.  Best that "our" threw some americans off for a second, but "we" can make the massive and typically erroneous assumption that everyone reading this blog will be from "our" country.  Seriously though, while still maintaining an awareness of other nations (ie: more than just North America and the four or five nations occupying it - don't get on my case here, there ARE four or FIVE, not just the three biggies Canada, Mexico and US), from time to time I may speak Canada-specific; for which I appologize to my international friends.  The talk may get a little job-specific, but I promise to be general about the technical, and/or fully explain what the hell I'm talking about in simple terms.  Maybe some of my posts will even be useful to students studying to be engineers.  Damn, there I go getting into the bio type stuff... oh well, perhaps I should go write it all out.  Until the next time...  Quinn
