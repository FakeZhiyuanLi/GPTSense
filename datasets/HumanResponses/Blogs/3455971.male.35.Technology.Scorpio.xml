      Test your IQ with the question below:   There is a mute  who wants to buy a toothbrush. By imitating the action Of brushing one's  teeth he successfully expresses himself to the shopkeeper and the purchase is  done.  Now if there is a blind man who wishes to buy a pair of sunglasses,how should he express himself?  Think about it first before scrolling  down for the  answer...   He just has to open his mouth and ask, so simple.  If you got this wrong please - do not pass go, do not breed, just go dig a  hole and hide. you are a disgrace to the earth.      I got this wrong. Other people know I got it wrong. I am soooo fucking embarrassed.

      Last nite I went to the local mall to get my weekly fix of new dvds. Spend around $100 each week. Brought Return Of The King, You Can Count On Me & 24 Hour Party People. Also brought the last Muse album, Absolution.   Anyway, I hate malls, hate shopping (apart from when it's too buy guy stuff I suppose. You know, electronic equipment, xbox games etc etc). Friend picked me up and all I did was bitch and moan about how much I hate bloody malls and people bumping into you and why the fuck did she have to park the car at the furtherest point from where we were currently at?  Wasn't till we got to the car she mentioned that she'd been told her Ma's got the worst heart prob and the docs only give her 10% chance of surviving the op to fix it. That's WITh the heart strengthening medication they've started giving her before they do it. If that doesn't work, it goes down to 5%.  I am a fucking schmuck boy. Do I know when to stick my foot in it or not!?

      Not a great way to start. Had a rather "loud" discussion (does that technically constitute an argument/fight?) with a female colleague (ok, friend, tho less so at this moment) regarding my long service with Craptus. I described my intention to negotiate for more money at the conclusion of my current contract, and should I fail to procure a better financial deal, to seek pastures greener. She replied with "that'll be the day, they won't give you more money" and then went on about how she's heard this too many times before from me. On one hand she's right, I have been here too long and I do keep coming back, if only because it's not terribly difficult work to do and I quite frankly am too lazy to go on a fresh learning curve working for somebody else.  On the other hand I only came back here this time because a good mate who took over this particular unit asked me too and I like working with him. Also he offered me a way better pay rate than I had before I last left. Lastly, despite my desire to work elsewhere organising a job from overseas where I was living at the time just was too difficult an option for me. So I came back.   Yeah, basically it fits me because I'm lazy and complacent. I've no problem admitting that. Seems like other people have tho. Too bad. Fuck em'.    Anyway, got up really early this morning. I never get up early. I go to bed late; I never get up early. However I decided "bugger it, I'll go to the gym". Joined a gym 3 weeks ago, been once. I got ready, caught the 6:15am train, got to the station, brought my regular jumbo caramel latte & 2 bits of raisin toast and proceeded to walk towards the gym.  Then I turned left.   Fuck it, I'll go at lunchtime.  Possibly.

      My new favorite song of the moment is 'Long Time Coming' by The Delays. I'll thrash it till I'm sick of it.   Just got out of a meeting about the upcoming work schedule for the project I'm working on. I'm questioning why I'm tailing off it earlier than some of the other people on it. It either means they have something else in store for me, or it's unemployment.  That's the life of a freelance contractor tho. Lack of security vs working freedom is the trade-off. Then again, define job security. I like what I do tho. Easy money. Ideally I want to work 2 thirds of the year and spend the last third doing nothing (i.e playing, vacationing, fishing...sleeping). I almost do that now, tho more randomly. I just need to establish the pattern to take me thru the rest of my life.

      After a recent staff survey at Craptus, the results of one question about the balance between home and work life were seen as a potential problem. One director decided to call a meeting of all his managers to discuss the survey and try to find a solution. The meeting was scheduled for a Saturday.  I work for these clowns.

      I'm nothing. Just a normal drone. What I'll put on here will be completely random. Like sometimes I just have these weird ideas pop into my head, or moments of inspiration, and I have nowhere to record them. Well I guess this'll be as good a place as any. Besides, I may not be able to apply myself to work, but I can write drivel all day long.   Plus you know how sometimes you come across something that you think is really stupid but no one else seems to think the same way about it but you; which in turn makes you feel like this isn't really your planet and you were accidentally left here after some offworld picnic your alien parents decided to take you on? Now I may finally find out whether it's just me or it really is the rest of the planet who's nuts.
