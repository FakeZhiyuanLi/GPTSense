      My iPod Mini, which I wholeheartedly ADORE, has started to crap out on me already. I wear it every day when I walk using the armband accessory and it has started going utterly static at points for no reason. I have to rub the control wheel to make it stop. The odd part is that the lock switch is engaged so it shouldn't be getting any input from the wheel but it does. I can tell when I touch the controls that the nature of the interference changes. Sometimes it just needs a good smack. Leads me to believe that it's got an internal short somewhere. I can't get it fixed until I get back to LA which is going to be a pain for my daily walks. I have a full sized iPod but hate carrying it on the walks. Not to mention that the cable on my earbuds won't reach so I'd have to get another pair of phones just for a few days of walking. If I wasn't so engrossed in my book I wouldn't care but I'm hooked on this one and need my daily 2 hours fix. I've beaten up on the larger iPods a lot more than this little guy so it's disheartening to see it take a dump so soon.

      I'm making as many traffic machines as I can. The latest one is  urlLink A Photo a Day . I'm taking submissions so if you are a decent photographer and want your work showcased drop me an email or leave a comment here with your email addy and site URL and I'll get back to you.

       urlLink    This is a shot I made with the v600 at the pool hall in PA that I hang out at. The background was a very dark green pool table and the lighting was from the overhead table light. I'm trying to get the hang of this camera ASAP since I have to deliver 5 solid photos for  urlLink SENT  pretty soon. You too can submit photos to the public portion of the show now. Give it a whirl! Anyway I'm getting the hang of the phone but the real trick seems to be just flood the hell out of your subject with as much light as you can muster. I still wish I still had the v710. It was niiiice.

       urlLink Cool page  Evan links to about birthdays of people with Blogger profiles. At the risk of sounding like Pirillo... can we get an RSS/Atom feed for it? I'm never gonna remember to look at that page.  Looks like Blogger is going to be setting up to take on LiveJournal with the new community features. As soon as they implement "Friends posts" pages they're gonna take over that crowd in a heartbeat. Oh yeah, and implement the ability to attach 125 different gay ass buddy icons to your posts.

      Today I consolidated 80+ mailboxes in Entourage to 4. I saw a post about something similar a few months ago where someone did something similar but I can't find it so no link lovin. I still have my inbox  and I created 3 new boxes. First is an "Action Required" box which has anything that requires some sort of action on my part to resolve. Second is a "No Action Required" box where everything that I want to archive goes. Lastly I created a "Personal Archives" mailbox that stores things that I may need to find in a hurry or things that like receipts that I will not be able to easily find without knowing the exact company. I still have about 800 emails in my inbox to sort through and mark or delete but this is a step in the right direction. I'm such a mail packrat it's hard for me to delete so much but I have almost every piece of internet email I've ever gotten, that's not spam, archived somewhere. One time I counted them after importing from archives and from 1994 to 2000 there were over 230,000 messages. That was after weeding out the fluff too. Back when we were in serious internet boom days. Too much fun. Anyway if this method works for me I'll adapt it to my Gmail account and use the labeling system for tracking since you can't create mailboxes for storage.

       This post is originally from  urlLink Runcible.com . I've decided to split my blogging into 3 separate spheres. This one for tech related BS. Runcible for things about me and my new endeavors and one that I'm not publishing the address of for more personal writing. Basically ignore the last line in the post below and we're golden.   Gmail is great so far and I'm digging it. Problem is that my daily life is so routine with mail and web and, to a very minor extent rss, that I just plain forget to check my Gmail. They should have a notification service that sends you an email when you get some email. I know it sounds redundant but for people switching a good portion of their mail over and trying to get them into a new habit it would be helpful. That or just give me an RSS/Atom feed of my inbox. I'd be happy with a feed of the last 15 subjects from my account so I can just see if there is something new. Slap some ads in the feed. I don't care. Not like anyone's getting paid for the ads anymore. I'll stop baggin on Google when they pay me for the 2 months I'm owed for. I do love the new Blogger though. I think it's by far the best iteration yet and if I could move the ads to a sidebar or SOMETHING it would be a great blogging solution. Hell it IS a great blogging solution and the price is right. For now I'm sticking with Blogware.    Listening to:  here to stay (dirty)   from the album Untouchables by  urlLink Korn

      I have a Motorola v710 that I got  as part of my participation in the SENT art show and have had absolutely zero luck with the thing. It's not activated since there is no network in place that can actually handle it yet so I can't email images off of it. Then I tried to use the memory card that comes with it (after I dropped $25 on a card reader) and I'm guessing since the phone is still in beta the software just still isn't up to snuff since it only saves corrupted JPEG's. So as bad ass as the thing is, and believe me it's pretty bad ass, it's utterly useless for the appointed task of taking photos for an art show. It's like having the hottest girlfriend in school but she won't let you get past first base.

      Danger Will Robinson! I just saw someone whip out the new Danger Hiptop (a.k.a. Sidekick) prototype and it's lookin' pretty damn sexy! It's thinner and sleeker but with the same screen action as the current Danger Hiptops. I can't wait for them to come out with the new ones. I miss mine terribly and want another one. As much as I love my Motorola v600 it's not nearly enough.

      Finally got my new Epson 2200 yesterday. My string of bad luck with Epson printers will hopefully end with this one. I always buy the low end consumer printers and have been in love with the print quality but the durability leaves a LOT to be desired. So I broke down and got this professional version. After tax and a 3 year bad-ass warranty it was about $825. I think I was paying by the pound and cubic foot. This thing is BEEFY and damn large. I can print up to 13" x 44" I believe. I'm still doing tests with it but the color adjustments are going to take a bit to get right. This always happens with printer switches though so I'm not surprised. The results so far have been excellent though so I'm not complaining. Once I get the hang of it I'm going to start prepping prints to sell online. Definitely looking forward to it.

       urlLink High-tech messages from the grave   The system I had in mind would use motion detection and a 3D scan of the dead person's head so they could follow you with their eyes and if you used facial recognition software you could actually have the deceased say hello to you when you come to visit or give them some personal messages. The fun is endless. I wonder if I have the original post somewhere. Doubt it.
