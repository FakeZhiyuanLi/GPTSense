      Well... This is my first blog post.. I figure that it could be a nice addition to my site and I need a way to speak my mind without getting grounded by my parents...  They pissed me off so bad yesterday, my parents. My little brothers won't stop telling that when I'm wit my friends I bug them and annoy them... Such bullshit... Then my step mother keeps riding me about insulting my sister when wit my friends.. when its not me.. it's my friends... and usually its when Im not with him... so im sorta pissed off right now....  Well anywayz... My life other than that is going pretty good.. I'm never stuck with nothing to do, except for morning and late at night... I've got a girlfriend now... Natasha, she's not the smartest but she's funner than most other people I know.. and she's pretty good looking..  Well im done talking.. Ttyl   Paul

      I've alaways found that you could always do alot of things.  You can always talk to your friends, your true friends, even how unintereted they are they will always give yous ome helpful advice. You can always tell your parents, you might not want to, but you can. You can always call someone ; and you can always have something to do. You can always make your own decisions.  The reason I say this, is because...   I dont know actually.. I've decided to break it off with Natasha, she's not smart enough for me. Actually, she isn't smart enough for a monkey. She kept on asking my friend for me to 'officially' ask her out... well that wasn't going to happen. I told her from day one I would never actually go out with her. But she won't stop being interested in me. But I think she's started to lose interest (starting to go for my best friend.. too bad that ain't happening either...lol)..  And mah best friend, recently found an interest in trying Pot. I told him that if I ever caught him smoking a joint, I'd take it outta his hands and break it. And he knows i wasn't joking. I'm very against drugs. Now alcohol, might be a different story, but drugs are just retarded. Don't get me wrong, I don't drink ( -____o ) .. but I condone it more than I do drugs. He says he won't start doing drugs, thank god. But somehow I think he'll try it... I hope he doesn't, but if he does, I jsut hope he doesn't do it on a regular basis.  Well, I just needed to put in a new entry outta boredom... I'll talk to you later Mr. Fake Blog Reader Guy    Paul

      I got back from my mom's house to be greeted by a couple of surprises... I have a new computer chair... lot more comfy. No more uncomfortable sitting times because of a nasty wooden chair. I have a bike now, front and rear suspension, shimano everything.... That was a surprise cost of 80$(great deal)... I owe my parents 200$ now... I have a footon for my room... Now I have a couch/bed.. lot easier when I have friends over... And... Perhaps... I'm gonna be getting the basement to myself...(quite probably sometime this week...) Which makes it so I have a big stereo(basement perk) a couch, and, wait for it...... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   A LAZYBOY!  You heard me.. the most comofrtable chair.... And having the basement also comes with more perks... Like I can have friends sleepover alot more often.. parents won't hear me... I get my own little getaway from everything, and alot more privacy, cuz no one will want to go all the way downstairs to get/talk to me...  Im at the point where I'm gonna search for another job, my job at McDonalds is pissing me off cuz they're giving everyone shit hours, because of recent hiring.  School starts in 2 weeks and 2 days... I can't wait... I miss it, well, not the concept, but the actual thing.. I miss chilling with friends and I miss sitting down non-stop for 6 hours straight, oh, what i would give to be able to sit for 6 hours straight during summer... I got the best sleep of my whole summer last night!! Fifteen fucking hours! FIFTEEN! 15! I was so tired from the all nighter the day before, after my 6 hour shift... that i fell asleep at 8pm and woke up at 10:30am... almost being late for work.. but thats something else all together... Im so re-energized!  I get paid on thursday,, cant wait.. plans.. oh plans indeed, must make more plans... but must stay in budget, yes budget indeed.. budget, budget, money... Everything take smoney.. i feel like im wasting money typing this entry... but wait! I am! We pay for the internet we use! Alot of us dont remember that... And then we pay for everything else... yes.. everything must be paid for...  Your a queer!  Uh oh, i just insulted you, you gonna sue me for emotional distress? You could probably get a couple million for that statement... Everyone underestimates the power of the penny... But.. if you had a penny for every penny you had in your life.. you'd have a hel of alot of pennys. Like millions like :D... lol... Im just rambling now.. Time to sign off...  Peace not war.

      I got the basement today.. completly set-up.. except for the TV.. Im gonna attack that in the morning. I found a new hobby, altering images... And its incredibly fun!  This girl at work, Maria... makes me angry! She gets mad at me for no reason.. I don't care much.. but I don't like people leaving mad... fucking vegetarians. Well anywayzz.. The last week has been pretty uneventful, so I skipped this blog.. Thought of writing in it, but I'm all like.. "well, it would end up being a shit entry..(now i think about it, All my entries are shit.) " Well anywayz... I wrote a new poem.. dun remember exactly when, and I dunno even if it was before the last entry and if it was mentioned.. But its called "Meanign of Life" you can find it at the poetry section at  urlLink http://clams.animeconnection.net  or at  urlLink http://clams.deviantart.com .  It's really bad compared to the ones I wrote with feeling. But meh  X_____x...  So basically, heres the low-down on my life...  I'm a 15 year old boy from Ottawa. I live in my parents basement and go to a catholic-french highschool. I excel at Math and Computers. I have more than one best friend and lots of secondary, less important friends. I don't smoke (or drink ^___- ) and I am highly against it. My parents divorced when I first started school, which I think might've caused alot of the problems I had at school up to grade 6. At grade 7, I changed schools for the 4th time to get to a place where I ddnt fit in, but I wasnt outcasted. After that, I got to high school, where I spent a year being a total slacker and watching my grades fall from a 85 to a 64 average. I was disappointed. Every once in awhile I write poetry. Its fun and keeps me outta trouble. Sometimes I get lonely.. but I dont care...gives me poem fuel. ^______^  So thats the low-down... Any questions, get my email adress off my site... http://clams.animeconnection.net
