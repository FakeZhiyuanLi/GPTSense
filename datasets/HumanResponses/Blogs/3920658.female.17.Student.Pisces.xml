      Come together! -Literally!   You heard me, folks.  August 8th  the whole world will be celebrating the One World Orgasm Day - and don't you miss out! Sure sounds a lot better than christmas, don't you think?    urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/vt/alexigloo/OWO.html    ~:~   Yesterday, biking home from Nicole where I'd seen "The little mermaid" (clearly the nastiest disney movie ever!) I saw two  hares  sitting on the road right before me. I started biking faster, because I wanted to see how close I could get - and before I knew, I was  racing  them. I imagine it's a bit like swimming with dolphins -well, except that it's not all wet and you're on a bike and... ok, so maybe not, but I imagine&nbsp;the feeling might be similar, like you're actually a part of  nature . After a couple of blocks, the hares gave up and jumped in on someones&nbsp;garden,&nbsp;and I continued home. (Me getting into the garden&nbsp;after them would look a bit strange...) Anyway, I really recommend racing with hares. If you can get  hold  of any, that is.   ~:~     "Toss me a cigarette,  I think there's one in&nbsp;my raincoat"  "We smoked the last one  An hour ago"  So I looked at the scenery,  She read her magazine;  And the moon rose over an open field.   "Kathy I'm lost" I said,  though I knew she was sleeping.  "I'm empty and aching and  I don't know why"  Counting the cars  On the New Jersey Turnpike  They've all come  To look for America     ~:~   To be on your  way , and suddenly realising you've forgotten  why  and  where  you're going. Doesn't it feel like that?   Simon and Garfunkel are my  heroes !    Kisses/ Carrie

      I just came home from the world's biggest arena shaped like a ball... And the two lovely&nbsp;gentlemen called Simon and Garfunkel that held my heart over the open fire for two and a half hour tonight. Now all I feel is bliss.   ~:~  Oh, I forgot to tell you: I'm engaged! Well, not really... But that day after all the whiskey, when I was lying in&nbsp;a sofa so far away from home,&nbsp;feeling like I could just die, my best friend My calls. Her voice made me so happy I could just fly, but I missed her so much. She told me that she had been to a party the day before and had met a girl who had gotten a "friendship-engagement" with her best friend. So My proposes to me, right there on the phone.  I love that girl, she's the best friend I've ever had. We've been looking for some nice silver rings to exchange on the big engagement-party we're planning. I love being engaged! But on the other hand, it wouldn't have been that bad if I had some guy that I could get on that well with too... But I guess I have to settle with having a good friendship relation... It's worth a great deal, that too.  ~:~  Apparently Robin, Tom's friend from up north, had added me on MSN... He cut his hair! He looks better, but I'm not sure it's a good thing if he did it just because he's so in love with Linda.He just sent me this song called "Destiny" with 7 eleven... It's so good!   I will soon fall asleep with a smile on my lips and my heart floating around on bliss. Love /Carrie

      I'm, as usual, severely confused. I'm also a bit disappointed at myself -it's been too long since I wrote something here! Well, I'm not sure you can say stuff  hasn't  happened, but I always get a feeling that when something big happens I'm only there to watch. I'm the  watcher ... Hey, wasn't that some movie about a psychopath?&nbsp;  Whatever...   ~:~   Me and some classmates went on a holiday trip to some redneck-smalltown up north... The best friend I've got in my class, Tom,&nbsp;used to live there until last year, so we&nbsp;crashed in his mum's old appartment. It was a mess. Well, not just the appartment, but the whole holiday. First,&nbsp;Tom is the only one of my "mates" I really like, he's one of my best friends, but he can really piss me off! See, he's got one of the world's worst self-esteems I've ever bumped into, so he lets this total bitch (another fabulous classmate)&nbsp;take control over him. Nowadays it can even be hard getting a word out of him, he usually lets her do all the talking since they're constantly glued to eachother. I feel a bit sorry for him, but I don't know what to do to help him take control...   Back to the story. It was Tom, the total bitch Linda, the slightly neurotic and partly annoying Mandy, and me. There we were accompanied by Tom's only friend from that town, Robin. Must be tough living in that place for 15 years with only one friend. Well, I guess being gay did't make Tom too popular. Rednecks! If I only had the money I'd go to that pride festival...   &nbsp;Of course, Linda constantly did her best in trying to bully me out, but I couldn't be bothered. She's pathetic. Apart from that, the holiday started off really nice. We explored the village, Worked on that tan on the beach, and had a picnic in the park. Cozy.   Of course,&nbsp;after a day we were&nbsp;so bored we could just die. So we did the one thing to do: Got completely shit-faced. For some reason, like always when we drink together, I get to be the sensible one. So, after talking Mandy out of trying to convince Tom to have sex with her, I became Robin's marriage counselor (does it spell like that?). Apparently he had been talking to Linda on MSN and fallen madly in love with her. What can I do? At least I talked him out of cutting off his long hair for her sake. (Ok, he would probably look better with shorter hair, but&nbsp;for her sake I wouldn't lift a finger).   ~:~   By the way, in her completely drunk but always honest state, Mandy asked me how it feels to be&nbsp; good  all the time. Usually I don't strike myself as an unusually  good  person, but when I think it through I realise that with my classmates I'm always good, honest, caring, and would never ever say I count Linda as a bitch. There is one simple reason, and it is that I feel sorry for them.   ~:~   I felt miserable the next day. Of course, being the sensible one is often my job since I'm not very easily affected by alcohol, but&nbsp;it's&nbsp;so not worth getting a hangover for.&nbsp;Besides, this wasn't the usual hangover. I was completely dead.&nbsp;How could I have&nbsp;known I was allergic to&nbsp;whiskey? Still ill, four kilos lighter,&nbsp;and carrying myself like&nbsp;Ozzy Osbourne,&nbsp;I packed&nbsp;myself into the bus to finally get home a couple of days later. Do I have to say I won't ever&nbsp;be drinking whiskey&nbsp;again?   ~:~   I relaxed with a couple of days in my summer house by the sea with my family and&nbsp;some real friends. I'm myself again, and it&nbsp;feels good.&nbsp;Today I went shopping, so stuff is very much back to normal.   ~:~   I've been trying to upload a picture of myself here, but I'ts just too complicated with all those things you have to download... Or is there an easier way? If you can help me I'd be happy! For now, I'll just describe myself, it's just much easier: I'm tall, 175 cm, with blonde hair and greyish eyes... That's probably it.   Ellen called my now, we're going nightbathing... Brr!  Got to go, seeya!

      "Strange things will happen if you let them come around and stick around..." That is probably one of my absolute favourite songs in the whole wide world. This winter I listened to it every morning on the subway on my way to school. It can lighten up any shitty swedish winter day, though the sun hasn't rised when you get up in the morning and has already gone down when you get out of school.   Today wasn't like that, though. I woke up really early, like nine... Now in the summer I have to set my alarm clock to wake up before noon, and today I had promised Ellen and Nicole to meet them at eleven. We were going into town to get some fabric, to sew a new bag for our water-pipe Mohamed (Yes, we named our water-pipe! So what?). We met about one o'clock... But we found some great fabric though, orange with the right 70's touch. Love!   Haha. Right now my brothers cellphone rang. I put on some really funky disco music and pumped up the volume... He locked himself in the bathroom. That's what brothers are for!   After our shopping tour we went to the beach. We have to take advantage of the only sunny day of July this far, so we managed to catch some of the evening sun...   On the way home from the beach on my bike, I just leaned back and let my hands off the handle. And it worked! I know, learning to bike without holding on to your handle by seventeen is... well, stupid. I had a friend, Ellinor, who tried to teach me that in fourth grade, but I just couldn't do it. I was so happy when I biked past her house today&nbsp;without holding the handle! I'm really&nbsp;still a child, but hey... If it makes me that happy it just can't be a bad thing! Right?   Now after dinner I'm sitting here listening to "Me and Bobby McGee" with Janis Joplin, waiting for Ellen, Nicole and My to come over so we can start sewing our bag. I've started working on a CD which is meant to be a collection of old summer songs... Like "That summer feeling". It's absolutely impossible to find anywhere, so I'm really annoyed. It's a great song! Has anyone of you got it? Cause I'd really like to have it, my summer CD wouldn't be complete without it! Please tell me if you happen to have it on your computer...Pleeease?   Oh, now Ellen and My came over... Bye bye  Hug

      I might be mad, setting up a blog at 03.00 AM, but it's my style. To me the night is the only time to be fully awake, the only time to think things through and doing them right. I suppose it's in the family, our house is the only one lit up at this time if I take a look at the quiet suburban street outside the window. To be fair, besides me it's only my father and one of my two little brothers living here at the moment, since my parents are divorced and my other little brother away at some friends house. But still, we're alive at this time.    Blogging:  I need to write in order to express myself, so I'm constantly writing ("like a goddess" to pick the words out of my teachers mouth), and like nothing else it helps me to sort my mind out. I also need to gain approval from others, (I suppose everybody does) but I've found out that a recurrent pattern in my life is seeking away from who and what I know to meet completely new people and the challenge of getting to know them and becoming their friend. In my eyes that's a bit odd, since I think most people tend to get involved with the same stuff as their friends, but it has given me loads of new friens and experiences, and also a better knowledge of myself.   To keep it simple, writing in order to get a grip and getting to know new people is probably what brought me into blogging. Though, in order to be able to write what ever is on my mind, I think I'd better keep the blog a secret to my friends... Not that I think they'll get mad reading my 3 a.m.-philosophic nonsense, but...well, I suppose that if this diary ever gets down to the bottom of my mind (which I've probably never even seen myself), even they might not recognize me.   Me:  Having been this honest with you all already at the beginning, I don't know if there's anything left to say that won't sound shallow... But, well: I'm 17 years old (feeling the pressure of going 18 in about six months). I'm female (you might've guessed from the name). I live in Sweden (forgive me if the English is poor!). I don't know if there's anything more to tell you at the moment, but if you just hang on you'll soon know me better!  Cheers -and good night!

      As you see, I haven't done a lot of things really worth mentioning lately. I suppose i've been too busy smoking water-pipe and moaning over the fact that school starts in less than a week. Horrible! But, if I'd keep you waiting until something ineresting turns up you'd probably have to wait forever. So, here's an update:  Yesterday me, Ellen and Nicole went to a  hippie party, arranged by   urlLink  Oneness    in a park in Stockholm. It was quite good, but kind of amateurishly arranged. The last time, when we celebrated the  urlLink  Venus transit   was so much better. Anyway, this time we watched a medium. She was a big, smiling Indian lady with a southern Swedish accent, sitting on a chair in the green grass. We sat down in front of her together with about twenty other people to watch her go into a trance. After a while she started shaking back and forth, and after a while an old womans vioce came out of her and started talking to us about the tone of our souls and the importance of being true to ourselves. Some people asked her questions, and she answered them all in a mysterious way. Quite interesting, actually.   ~:~  In the evening of August the 14th, me and Nicole challenged the pouring rain to go to a concert in another park. The audience probably didn't consist of more than ten people, all standing or sitting on the stage in order to get under the roof of the wall-less pavilion and avoid the rain. A girl who had had a little too much to drink was climbing on a giant amplifier. Nicole and I hurried in and took a seat on the floor behind the band,  urlLink  Royale madness  . They were absolutely amazeing, and the singer was...well...gourgeous.

      I was very happy today to recieve my first comment on a post! Historical! Inspired by  urlLink  Haro   and this utterly boring and rainy day, I decided to publish some test results, all from  urlLink  Quizilla  : ~:~   What kind of girl are you?       You're an every day average girl. You aren't amongst the popular crowd, but you are definatly far from being a geek. You are probably pretty, but not gorgeous. You have a fair amount of friends, but each one of them means the world to you. Keep them close and don't change yourself.    Which dysfunctional care bear are you?           What movie do you belong in?           Which of the greek Gods are you?         What color angel are you?      You're a "Blue Angel". You're a smarter one than most and are the more logical than anyone you know. You also have very strong morals that you stick to through it all and you'd stand up for whatever you believe in even if no one else agrees. You're a little bit shy around people but you love to be with lots of people anyway. You have appreciation for things like music or poetry or art. You yourself can sing fairly well but you don't like to sing in front of people. You're very thoughtful and people love how creative you are.

       urlLink     urlLink     The girls in the klick have a special place: Lately we've been goin to the big field by the public pool at night, tipping over one of the soccer goals and then lying down on it, looking at the stars, a lot. We always see shooting stars, and we always make secret wishes. Last time, we even saw a satellite. When we lie there we immediately go through the most important stuff in our lives right now, with a special kind of honesty which is hard to bring about in daylight. Two nights ago, me, Ellen and My was lying there watching stars and talking about boys. Gee, I'm really starting to sound like some naïve 14-year old back in the good old 50's, but that's about as far as I go when it comes to guys. Sadly. We were discussing that to; the strange fact that I'm never the one to have a boyfriend or even date/flirt with one. I suppose I ought to work that charm...  ~:~  My just called to say she misses me. She was so drunk I got jealous. She's away at a really good music festival I couldn't afford going to. Bad. Today I spent the day with an old friend and her old friends, bathing and playing boule. A bit nerdy but it was relaxed and fun.  ~:~  I'm starting to wonder what I should do in order to make more people to read my blog? At least I feel like nobody's reading it since I never get any comments... Am I doing something wrong, or is it just that my life is too boring? Anyway, if you're reading this please post a comment so I know cyber-space isn't entirely empty.

      It's 16.00 and I haven't even gotten out of my pyjamas. That sort of states my situation right now. Yesterday was, both Ellen and I agreed, probably the worst night of our life. At least it felt so when we were walking the kilometer home to her place at 4.30 this morning.  ~:~  Yesterday started out quite good. Ellen and I met the "booze guy" to get something to drink for the evening in the park we were planning with my calssmates and some other friends. Then we went shopping and managed to find some great stuff, like a jacket for 125 kronor (That's like 15 bucks, for all you yankees out there).  I think the bad stuff started in the little Chinese shop where we stopped to buy a lighter to light the water-pipe with. Right next to the box with cheap lighters was a basket full of those Chinese fortune cookies, and I, feeling quite lucky, suggested that we should take one to predict our destiny for the evening. "You will pass a hard test, but it will make you happier". Maybe that's where we started doubting the day.  Anyway, the evening turned out to be one big, difficult test. I will here lay down our  worst moments  in chronological order:  1. At home, 20.00. Under quite dramatic circumstances,   my dad finds out I've got a water-pipe  , and goes completely mad. We have an argument, but, full of guilt and anxiety, I manage to get away and meet Ellen in the subway station.  2. In the beautiful park by the sea, 21.00.   We meet my classmates.     A classic mistake which I manage to make like, every day. My classmates are not nice, kind, or any other feeling you might associate with being good. This time it's Linda, Tom, Bianca and Anna (Look at "About last weekend" for further details about some of these people, like Linda). Luckily there are other nice people there, like my old friend Ellinor and her friend Susie.    3. In the park, an hour later. Trying to light the coal for the water-pipe,   Our lighter melts.    How stupid is that? We have to walk around the whole park to find someone who will lend us a lighter.   4. In the park, an hour later.   The water-pipe isn't working  . The smoke is thin and the taste is gone.  5. Still in the park, a couple of hours later. We find out that   our alcohol isn't working  . Sounds stupid, but though we've been drinking all of it we're not even dizzy. Somehow Linda and Anna have managed to get drunk, though, and after taking a bath with me and Tom they go rumbling around the park.  6. Taking a walk around the park with Tom to drop off his friend at the station, 22.00.   My feet are killing me.    I discover my gourgeous turquoise glass-beaded sandals has scratched up bleeding wounds on my feet. Maybe they weren't really the right thing to walk around in. I take them off and walk barefoot the rest of the evening.   7. Still in the park, about 23.00.   We get picked up by some South-African exchange students  . We're bored, the tell us the're on their way home for some after-party. The tell us they've got alcohol. We're picked up. Then they tell us that "home" means Stockholms most notorious "ghetto"-area. We think it sounds cool. How stupid are we?  8. On the motorway, half an hour later.   We ride 10 people in the car for five with a possibly drunk driver.    Ok, so he drove very carefully, but still: One mistake, and we'd be mash.   9.   We leave Anna and Linda in the strange guys' apartment  . Ok, so the after-party wasn't good. The apartment was ugly, they didn't have enough beer, and the guys turned out to be pot-smoking, horny bastards. I had to get out, and so did Ellinor, Ellen and Susie. I got a bit worried, cause it didn't seem right to leave Linda and Anna with those guys. But what could we do? They're just as old and just as sober as we, and they definitely didn't want to leave, so we just reasoned that they should be able to take care of themselves. When we left, Linda was having a go at the joint they were passing around and Anna was snogging one of the guys. With a sting of helpless guilt we left, guided to the subway by the only "good guy" (Who claimed that having beautiful girls like us in his apartment was the best birthday present de'd ever gotten)  10. At the subway station, 02.30. Ellen discovers   she's   lost her subway card   . With about 20 minutes left until the last subway leaves the station (After that, the next one was leaving at 05.30 in the morning), we decide to run back to look for it in the apartment and in the car. We don't find it.   11. Back at the subway station, 02.50. With five minutes to go before the train for the cantral station leaves, we make it back. Then, I discover   I've lost my cellphone  . The good guy swears he's seen it in the apartment, and promises to give it to anna or Linda before they leave.  12. Stockholm Central Station, 03.00. The subway that was supposed to take us from the central station was supposed to leave at 03.08, but   the train never comes  . Neither does the one that was due 'til 03.38. Twenty minutes later we fall asleep to the sound of Bob Dylan's "You belong to me" on the night bus on our way home.  Some good stuff did happen yesterday, like when the bus-driver made a girl without bus fare sing a capella in order to ride with the bus (She WAS Alicia Keys! Amazing!), when we bathed by the beach in the park, when my father actually told me I had to decide for myself wether to go on smoking water-pipe, and when Anna called me today and told me I'd get my cellphone back tomorrow. But all that can't overshadow the fact that   yesterday   was   Crappy .        I'll get over it. // Carrie

       urlLink      urlLink    Yes, I finally put a little effort in this and uploaded a picture of me... Now, two of my earlier problems are solved: The photo, and "That summer feeling" with Jonathan Richman... Ain't tht great?  ~:~  On the other hand: I've been in touch with Robin on MSN since I met him in Tom's old home town up north, and a while ago he tells me he's coming down here in a week to live with Tom or Linda and just hang out with them. I've been speaking to both Tom and Linda since, but they haven't even mentioned it! Apparently they want Robim to themselves. Sould I ask them now, or do I wait until Robin's already here before I tell them, to embarase them more?  ~:~  This Saturdy it was the big Gay Pride Parade through town. Me and my cousin Jennifer went to the parade area and met Tom and Linda who were already there, and we decided to jump into the parade. As the parade mas starting to march we got a bit confused though: Which people were we supposed to march with? See, the parade consisted of different groups with separate banners marching together. So which group? We soon found out we belonged neither to "Disabled Gay-people", "Gay-doctors of Sweden", "Gay Scouts" or "Christian Gay Movement". Of course Linda and I should've marched with "Proud friends of homosexuals", but Tom couldn't walk alone, could he? Finally we jumped in with a group of cheery transvestites behind a huge pink bus playing disco hits.  When we were dancing around in the streets, some of the people in the parade started shouting my name. I moved forward and shouted "Yes! What?". "They're looking for you!" they replied, and pointed toward two guys standing among the huge group of cheering spectators crammed up on the sidewalks. I immediately recognized them: It was my friend Josie's brother John and her best friend Jim. They looked so baffled to see me marching in the parade I couldn't help laughing. I couldn't get to them so we just waved to eachother, and when I turned around after we'd passed them they were still staring at me. Haha, now they think I'm a lesbian... I might have to explain myself to Josie the next time we meet.  ~:~  Kisses

      Le Sud, performed either by Nino Ferrer or excellent french reagge group Zebda, has been the soundtrack of my life lately, and it's been a bit like the song: Sunny, slow and summery. Since both My and Nicole is away, it's only me and Ellen left of  urlLink  Th e Klick    in town, but we're handling it really good. We've been out biking, nightbathing, baking and tomorrow we'll go shopping. Oh, I forgot, I'm broke. Shit. During the rest of the year I live and shop with the study grant, but during the summer there's no school and no cash. It's a hard knock life...  Today was a bit more PMS:ish and not exactly as pleasant as usual, but I lived through it and even managed to get some things sorted out for my driving practise application which I'm supposed to mail tomorrow. I'm longing for the time when I'll start practising driving with my mum, i'm sure I'll learn fast. I wonder how fast I can get a license, though? My biggest dream right now is being able to buy an old  urlLink  VW-van   and go touring around Europe the next summer with my friends... Sigh, I guess I'll have to keep dreaming for a while... But if you happen to have an old but working VW-bus for sale, let me know. Right?  ~:~  Kisses!
