      ok well i couldn't think of a title. I apologize but its almost impossible to get a good title for every post about my extremely lame and sad life. sigh. Anyway i'd like to thank evryone who posted in their blogs recently. Before I had resorted to reading almost everyone's blogs the entire way through due to lack of entertainment. Please people Im me or email me at my new email adress sjd919@hotmail.com Please people I need entertainment!   Today i got my haircut. I wasn't sure i needed cut but what the heck, right? WRONG!!!. Seriously I hate it. It's not a new style or anything it's just so darn short. The few curls I had had are now gone and it's just blahh. I'm gonna try some gel or something. If im not at wednesday night u people will know why. Seriously pray for me and my hair. SJD

      Yesterday I went to church and we had our last sunday school lesson with Lincoln. It was Stu and Emmy's last sunday before college too. Yeah it was pretty sad. On a brighter note, the youth service went well. My compliments to everyone who participated and showed that they have more guts than i do. Stu was in almost everything. That guy has some serious tallent. What is up with the rain today? The "hurricane" was yesterday people!! I guess i'm depressed that i'm stuck inside again. Yep. stuck inside with 3 younger siblings(one of which has been screaming at the top of her lungs all morning. It's driving me nuts!! All of you with siblings that are older than 7 count yourselves lucky. Anyway, I have to go do nothing. Catch u later my home dogs. (ghetto is such a weird languge) SJD

      Golf is the stupidest game ever to be invented. I wonder why I like to play it so much? I just finished playing a round with my dad. I made so many stupid mistakes i was about to cry. Then I come home and I get a letter from the high school that says "Golf team tryouts are on Aug. 26. THAT'S IN TWO WEEKS AND I'M STILL SHOOTING IN THE LOW 50'S. (for those of you who know golf the 50's are pretty bad. I don't know what I'm gonna do but I have to do something and I have to do it fast.    In other more interesting news I start school on the 6th(i think). I'm really, really happy about this. NOT! I'm kinda angry right now .Ok well at least I got to vent. That helped a little.

      seriously, i'm tired of hearing arguments from people about whether a tomato is a fruit or a vegetable. I would like to settle this once and for all. A tomato is a vegetable because who would put a fruit on a hamburger? It would be like putting celery in a fruit salad. If anyone can back me up with any scientific proof that a tomato is a vegetable than please do. I think that somehow my argument would not hold up in court.

      Okay everyone. Today was one of those days that I'm not sure is worth writing about. I had to wash our 5th wheel trailer today by myself and now I am a little sore. So sad. I guess the most exciting thing that happened today was when a kid from my neighborhood thought he was being attacked by a snapping turtle while swimming in the lake today. It turns out that there was no turtle which meant that there was no reason for him to run out of the water yelling. Yeah. Today was pretty dull. I did manage to figure out that my boat's engine needs new spark plugs. I sat there wondering why it wasn't starting for like 10 min. Yup. I sure hope everyone else's days were more exciting than mine.  Joke of the day: What happens if you throw a red ball into a blue lake?  (I sure hope that tyou are intelligent to get this one cause i wasnt)  It gets wet!!    yeah it was that sort of day. I invite anyone who has something interesting to share with me to please do so. Sorry for not entertaining you. SJD

      Ok so today i was talking to my buddy stu . We were wondering what the secret service would do if an old college buddy of Bush walked up to him and gave him a friendly puch on the shoulder. Would the shoot him or what?(feel free to comment if u have the answer). Then i was wondering what would happen if an old girlfriend ran up and tackled Mr. President, not knowing he was married. Would the secret service do something about it or would they leave that to Mrs. Bush?

      First of all I'd like to thank Jenna and Christine for directing me to this site.       Okay moving on. I'm 14 and a freshman at Groton-Dunstable High School. I like to play and watch sports, except soccer, and I like to pretend that I am good at the guitar. I have more siblings than is healthy for a teenage boy and but I love them anyway. Did you know that white chocolate isn't really chocolate? The Red Sox lost yesterday to the Devil Rays. That is all I have to say. You may all get on with your sorry little lives now.(JK)                                                   *SJD
