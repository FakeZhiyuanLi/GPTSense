          -=[INTRODUCTION]=-      Oh My GOD! Finally I created an account on this blogger.com..... You know what... it takes approximately 2 months to me to decide whether i'll open a blog or not..  i think i'm beginning to realize that it's really good to have an online blog like this... ^^ it's cool to see that someone actually read on your thoughts.....  anyway, since this is my first post, i'll write a little longer... *pleased don't be bored*       -=[O-Days]=-     For those who don't know what o-days is, hmmm.. let me think of a simpler word: OSPEK! hehe... now you know it guys.... 2 Things That make o-days different from OSPEK are:     1. It's only Happened @ Bina Nusantara University, Especially the International Undergraduate Program 2. There's no physical contact (Read: VIOLENCE!)  Ok Then.... the 3 o-days have already passed... My opinion about it: Terrific! I've never had any of these kind of feeling for those kind of activities.... I mean, the main purpose of the o-days are completely achieved (Once again: To ME ^^). You know The new Campus environment, the cute and pretty seniors (This one is really makes me anxious ^^), and of course the so-called campus life....  ok.... i don't want to be a suck-up guy or somethin, but i really like my seniors... how they put their efforts in the activity... and how nice are they actually (PS: In da reality man, not in the o-days). I'm really sad because o-days are over, cos i think i haven't put all my efforts on those days to get to know the seniors..... man... i hope in the outbound, i'll get a better chance to know them better... ^^      -=[New Days of Life]=-      New Community to me equals to a new life.... that means a lot.... new environment, new friends! and that also means ADAPTATION! hmmm.. if you really-really studied biology (not all students really-really studied it you know... ^^) those caps-locked words means your capability to adjust yourself with your surroundings, and the result will affect your ability so survive for your life..... this is important! although it's not biologically thingy, buat if you couldn't survive the social life.... well, just wait and see how miserable are you after it.... For New Campus life.... just Can't wait to feel it man..... come one.... campus mean that you're now almost adult, you have your own life to live in, your decission is in your hand now! haha.... (I feel So Powerfull!)     -=[Faith Conflict]=-     In the past few weeks, there's a faith conflict in my heart..... it's about my daily life... one thing that really stuck in my mind is the fact that i aint doin' any worships to God... you know the singing thing like the protestants do? (FYI: I'm Catholic).... i can't do that! i don't mean to insult protestants for their ways of worshipping, but deep inside my heart..... my consciousness says: "It's Just Don't Fit Me!".... man... i'm kinda confused now, whether GOD accept my thoughts or not. ok, not just that... i have several thoughts that i think are really in the contrary of church's principle..... like the gay stuff.... well, i dont know what will HE do to me... But Suddenly, one good stuff appeared in my ear (sorry, i forgot the source):     "no matter what things you do, all you need to do is BELIEVE in HIM, and Put All of Your Life on HIS Hands... And From now on, you'll be saved"     wheeeewwwhhhhh... that stuff relieved me, now i'm ready to live my life like my usual life.....! AMEN!       -=[CLOSING]=-    Hey... sorry to finish this way too early..... it's already late now, and i'll have to attend the flag raising ceremony for the independence day celebration tomorrow..... talk to you later guys! ^^
