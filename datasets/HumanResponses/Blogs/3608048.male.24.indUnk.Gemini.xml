						   Let's get this thing started for real.  This is actually a kinda slow time of the year for major sports.  I get bummed at this time of year, I'm just not a regular season baseball kinda guy.  The NBA Playoffs are winding up, and the Stanley Cup has already been awarded, so now is the time when sports is in a lull.  The good thing about it though, is that I've got some softball to play and some camping to do.  Anyway, what about the Pistons spanking the Lakers?  Who saw that one coming?  I am definently NOT a Laker fan, but I was like most everyone else, ready to hand them the trophy when they made it out of the west.  The only thing though, the Pistons brought some game!  Most of the players are playing out of their minds, and that defense has the Lakers looking for somewhere to hide.  This Tayshaun Prince guy, have you ever seen a fencepost play some ball like that boy?  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Lakers steal one of the next two in Motor City, but they're looking punch-drunk right now.  I saw The Wise One, Phil Jackson, today saying that was their goal the entire time, was to just steal one game in Detroit, and go back to L.A. and finish it up at home.  That's true, they could do that, but man, that's living on the edge to rely on winning the last two at home when the Pistons are beating them by 20.  Baseball season is cranked up now, and that's great, but man, is there anything more boring that watching some of these baseball games on TV?  Don't get me wrong, baseball is a lovely game to watch, in person, but on TV it seems to drag along, and the commentators rambling about Johnny Damon's hair for a whole inning just doesn't do it for me.  Wake me up when the playoffs get here!  On another note, did a hockey team from Tampa Bay just win the Stanley Cup?  You can barely get ice in your drink during June in Tampa Bay, not to mention they play hockey there.  Wow, the times have changed.  Hockey just isn't my sport anyway.  I can stomach a little of it, but it just seems to grind on my nerves after a while.  So what else is going on these days?  R.I.P. Ronald Reagan.  I was a young man when he was President, so I don't really remember a lot about him, but he seemed like a nice enough person.  The real kicker of the whole situation was Nancy.  Man, she stood right there by his side the whole time.  That's beautiful, I guess what any man would hope for in a wife.  Even when he probably didn't even know who she was at the end, she still stood right there by his side.  WOW!  On that note, I'm gonna end it for today.  I'll try to keep this page updated often.  Let me know what you think, or give ideas about something to write about.
