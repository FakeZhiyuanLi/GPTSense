You can open all your own jars 5. When clicking through the channels you don't have to stall at every one where someone's crying 6. All your orgasms are real 7. You don't have to lug a bag of useless stuff around 8. You can go to the bathroom without a support group 9. When your work is criticised, you understand that everyone doesn't secretly hate you 10. You get extra credit for the slightest act of thoughtfulness 11. Nobody wonders if you swallow 12. You never have to clean a toilet 13. You can be showered and ready to go in 10 minutes 14. You save time and money by washing up in bulk every third week 15. Sex means never worrying about your reputation 16. Wedding plans take care of themselves 17 If someone forgets to invite you to something, it means that they forgot to invite you. It doesn't mean that they hate you, and he or she can still be your friend 18. You don't have to shave below your neck 19. None of your co-workers have the power to make you cry 20. You don't have to curl up next to a hairy backside every night 21. If you're 45 and single, nobody even notices 22. You can write your name in the snow 23. Biological clock? 24. Chocolate is just another snack 25. Flowers fix everything 26. You never have to worry about other people's feelings 27. You get to think about sex 90% of your waking hours 28. Reverse parking is easy 29. Foreplay is optional 30. Window-shopping is what you do when you buy windows 31. Robbie Williams does not exist in your universe 32. You don't have to clean your house if the meter reader's coming 33. You never feel compelled to stop a pal from getting laid. In fact you encouragethem. 34. Car mechanics tell you the truth 35. You don't give a rat's ass if no one notices your new haircut 36. You can quietly watch a game on TV with a buddy for hours without ever thinking he's mad at you. 37. You never look at the size of a baby's head and cringe 38. The whole world is your urinal 39. Hot wax never comes near your pubic area 40. One mood, all the time 41. Same work, more pay! 42. Grey hair and wrinkles add character 43. The remote control is yours and yours alone 44. No such thing as bunny-hopping half an inch above the toilet seat 45. People never glance at your chest when you're talking to them 46. You have a normal and healthy relationship with your mother 47. You can buy condoms without the shopkeeper imagining you naked 48. If you don't call your buddy when you say you will, he won't tell your other friends and they, won't try and work out what the problem is 49. Someday you'll be a dirty old man. And you're looking forward to it 50. You never have to miss a sexual opportunity because you're not in the mood 51. Dieting involves getting regular sized fries with your burger 52. Porn movies are designed specifically with your mind in mind 53. You don't have to remember everyone's birthdays and anniversaries 54. Not liking a person doesn't exclude having great sex with them 55. Your pals can be trusted never to trap you with: "so... notice anything different?" 56.

      We are Irish, Israelite, Shooter, Hair-spray and Bookman. We are the core of The boy's will travel.com. Irish is director of a company that is located close to the city of Amsterdam, he was born in Ireland but been living in Holland now for 28 years. His hobbies are visiting museums, arse fairs, ( sorry, I meant Art Fairs) music and golf. The later is the only thing he reasonably good at!! Shooter is a barman, and also a director of a company, he deals in humans. You need people for any shit job you can think of and he can find the right person for the job! Shooter is also a binge drinker and if you look close at the floor in a bar where he visited last you have a good chance to find his mobile phone, he loses one every month. Bookman works with Shooter, he is the one that has to organise all those shit jobs at ground level. If you ever see a guy reading a book while the rest of his friends are still recovering from a hangover, its the Bookman! Hair-spray is a manager of a handy man store, he is from the part of Holland where they drink beer 2 or 3 glasses at the same time. This guy drinks like no other! His hair always seems to be standing strait up in the air like he just recieved a bolt of lightning up his ass. He is Israelites main buddy, we go back a long time ;-) Israelite, what can we say about this character. Trades also in humans, oldest of the group. Hobbies, Golf, travel, woman and wine. Not necessarily in that order.Usually the first to get laid and the first to pass out after a night of heavy drinking. All of us are honorary members of RAIFBUM, an organization whose members are dedicated to making complete idiots of themselves. They are very competent and successful in this. If you ever meet any of us buy us a drink, you might have made a friend for life !
