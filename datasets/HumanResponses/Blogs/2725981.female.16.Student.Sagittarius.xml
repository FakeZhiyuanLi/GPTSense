      Toda I'm at my moms, and I will be for the remander of memorial weekend. My sisters are here too, and except for the rocky start everything seems to be going well. All is forgotten about the big fight me and Becca had, and we spent the majority of the day togeter and on good terms. We went to the Jazz Festival in Sacramento today. Its quickly becoming a tradition at my mom's house. We went the saturday before memorial day last year as well. Although I'm not a huge jazz fan, the music is decent, the food good, and the guys are hot. I get to play around on the dance floor with Kim and I even danced with my mom once or twice. It' fun because the only other people on the floor are really old, and no one knowsany real jazz swings, so everyones just playing around.  We're gunna head back tonight. Its all around town, and I think we're gunna go to a few of the hotels that have opened their ballrooms to jazz bands. I'm gunna go.

      Alright, here it goes. The drama at home. I have two younger sisters...Becca, 14, and Kim, 12. Me and Kim get together on most occasions, but it seems that Becca and I are always going against eachother.  At our house there are very specific rules. Move your feet lose your seat (unless dad tells you to do something or you go to the bathroom). You can't watch TV or talk on the phone while being in the computer. You can't use someones stuff without asking. You can't take public property into your room. No one else goes into your room without your permission.  Everyone in our family is worried about Becca. She talks on the phone constantly, she's always annoyed at you or just pissed off, she doesn't tell anyone whats going on, shes moody, she's secretive, she lies, she steals. I've been worried about her for the last year and a half, when she's really started to change. I check up on her every once in a while, look in her drawers and under her bed. Not all of it's in vain either, I've found a cigarette and a bottle of my dad's beer. I was afraid to ask her, but somehow the cigarette came up and she said that my dad's girlfriend hid it in there to see what she would do. I'm not sure I believe that one.  Tonight, she got mad because I wore a shirt I found in her room. She claimed that she was folding a load of darks, and my shirt just happened to be in there...I saw the shirt folded on the chair downstairs. She also took another shirt, which I wasn't aware of until she brought it up in the fight, which I know wasn't clean because it's a new shirt and I've been afraid to wash it because it might shrink.  She brought up a good point though, she's not allowed to go in my room, so why do I get the special treatment. I dont trust her, and truely I'm worried about her. She just strikes me as the type of person who's too stubborn to knwo when they need help, and I dont want her to need help...I want to be there for her. And she doens't talk to me, so how am I supposed to know? And I'm her big sister, I want to be able to help her if she ever needs it...going at this rate though, she'd call someones parents before she'd call me.  I found a knife sharpener under her bed. She has a knife in her room for protection, I dont know, I guess it helps her sleep at night. What am I supposed to think?  About the fight, she said she wished that I die, and that she'd be the one to kill me. I didn't let her know it...but god that really hurt me. After all, she had my stuff in her room...and all I was doing was getting it. I didn't tell dad about the beer or the cig, and I've yet to ask my dad's girlfriend about it all...but I will. Just wait.  The thing I hate about our fights, is that they never really end. It's always someone storms off, or someone hits someone...they cry, and the otherone pretty much runs away before my dad finds out. I'm a person who needs closure. I need to feel like I've accomplished something. I want to know that the fight wasn't something stupid, that something was resolved at the cost of all those tears. But thats never the case. Nothing happens and that just makes me cry more.  I have to go.

      Its sad, you know? Kids today are acting so grown up and I really think that the next generation is going to be a bunch of up-tight workaholics and drug addicts. I saw a 10 year old boy giving a cigarette to his 8 year old brother as they were walking home from school the other day. This 9th grade girl I talk to every now and then got pregnent and refuses to get an abortion. Her 'boyfriend' (an 17 year old dropout) has refused to return her phonecalls since he's got the news and she's going to have to go to some special school a few cities away so she can keep up with the work without haveing to go threw the horrors of high-school ridicule.  It seems that now the school year is winding down, everyone is getting high on friday nights. Its sad, freshman as going to get high, using their parents money to pay for it all.  And if you're not hanging out with stoners or 'doing it' with your boyfriend at the time, then you're studying for a big test or catching up on your homework. If not that, then you're working. Because everything costs money and no one seems to have a lot of it right now. What with you cell phone bill and the overages for texting everyone, the clothes you wear, the three times youve gone to the movies with your bou or your friends this month, the makeup you've bought, or the expensive lunches you've had. Its insane! I can't wait until summer, when I too *sigh* have to get a job, but at least I wont have to worry about tests or projects and I will be able to get in the pool and practise a little waterpolo with my team. It's been about 3 weeks since I've been in the pool. I cant wait...its sad, i miss practise and even more, the games.  My eyebrow piercing is heeling nicely and it's only a week or two until I can take it out. Which is perfect for polo, timing or what???      Well, I'm at my mom's house this weekend, I havent seen her in a long time and we both thought that we needed to get together.      I want to go shoppig again. I have no money. I prolly wont have money because I dont have a job. I can't get any job because I dont have a car. I dont have a car because I dont have my licence. I dont have my licence because I still have to wait until the end of July, at least. I can't babysit, because my sister holds the monopoly on that job...little sister by the way. I cant hit my mom up for money, because she doesnt have any. I can't hit my dad up, because we went shopping afew weeks ago and he spent ike $200 on me and he's paying $150 for polo and prolly $70 for lessons. Thats alot and I need a job. I already owe him like $150 and thats being modest.       I have to go, I've written quite a lot.

      Let me explain the poems, because some explaination is due. In class, when I'm especially bored, I take out a peice of paper and write down things that I hear. Phrases from the lecture, things people are talking about, things that appeal to me at the time. Sooner or later, a story appears and I simply mold it. I'll add a few words for clearification, or I will add punctuation to make it easier to read. Thats all. Most of the poems you'll read on this site are not merely my own, they belong to my friends, family, and teachers as well. Not to mention a few strangers, just for flavor. I just wanted to give credit, although the poems arn't very good in the first place.  I also wanted to update. I'll have to do that some other time, because right now I have to finish the homework I've been neglecting. God, my spelling is horrible. I really have to work on this, especially if I want to write, or be an english teacher or journalist or something. I suppose there's always spell-check.

       Aggresion and Appeasement  Half a world away, They take a pause, Untold stories, Savage and Brutal, Catacombs hide dead women, Because dead women tell no tales, While we stand, and wait, And do nothing.  But it just might be worth it, It just might be for the best.  It just might...change.

      He said, "it poses a threat" A week later, more men were enlisted We said it was reasonable. He said, "just for defence" Publically they didn't do anything, We bought it.  -March- "It's not unreasonable...just for defence" Was there a conflict? We argued no war! -March- They move in To return them to their fold, Their fatherland.  Outside the boundris, they move away. -Six Months Later- Another home, Reunite! they call.  Appeasement. -March- A new location. Words lost, meaningless. Lives lost, thrown away.  ....The War is finally here....

      well, I've decided that I need something new; For some reason the old blog just wasn't grabbing me. What better excuse than trading the old for a new one while all the site changes are going on. To be prefectly honest, I was surprized at the changes. Its weird, but not really bad. I dont know. Honestly, I'm putting off writing an essay for this HUGE World Civ. test that's going on tomorrow. I hate essays, and this is coming from someone who has always loved english...with a passion. I'm wild about reading and writing short stories, and I'm getting into poetry a little (not that I'm any good at it).  I'm bored...I really want to just leave school and go hang out somewhere with someone interesting. A coffee shop, a book store, a concert, a club, anything. Hell, I'd even go to the movies with a complete stranger, that's how bored I am. Its getting to be the end of the year, and all I want to do is stop with the homework and tests and everything and just go to the beach and live there forever. I'd build myself an unstable hut out of non-existant palm leaves and drink smoothies for breakfast. I'd sit out on the beach with no one else for miles and tan and then I'd go swimming or teach myself better surfing skills or write stories or letters or I'd write in this blog on a lap-top that I'd get between leaving school and the hut building. It would be great.  I dont want to write this essay. God, I hate this feeling. Putting somethig off sucks when you care about something related to the thing that you're putting off. Like me, I could honestly care less about this essay...or the class, for that matter...however the grades I do care about. I'm so close to a 3.5 that if I blow this, I'm throwing that away, and that was one of my goals for this school year...do well, and get a 3.5...although those are pretty much the same things.  Interestingly enough, it was the World Civ. class that led to the name of this blog. 'The Lost Generation' was the groups of artists, writers, and philosophers after World War I. They were the kids that saw no hope, they grew up with child labor, they served in the war, they came home to unemployment and then died with unbarable taxes. Nevertheless, they were creative, and still produced some of the most influental minds of our times.  You will have to excuse my spelling, I lack in that department...and I just dont care.  Anyways, the minds included Hemmingway, EE Cummings, Wolfe, Steinback, and my favorite, Fitzgerald. Thats not half of them, those are simply the ones I chose to include in my half assed essay. Almost done.

      Well, its been about a month and I haven't written about anything...and seeing as I have nothing to do right now, what better time? Summer has started, and I love it. Sleeping in, water polo, hanging out and video games. My dad has dutifully decided to put us to work, giving us a few hard tasks to complete in our backyard...which we have begun to remodel. The plan is to level our hill, and put a deck at the top, with a staircase that leads from the bottom of the hill to the deck. There will also be a small path that winds around the backyard and eventually joins the stairs. IN addition, my dad want's to build a gazibo at the staircase's entrance and a few ponds and waterfalls throughout the whole shabang. There will be a bunch of flowers and ferns and quiet possibly trees that add the color and sence of peace to everything. We're still ripping everything up and pulling it to the bin thats been parked outside our house for about a month. Its alot of damn work.  But thats not the last of it. In addition to working on landscaping, we're also working on tidying up. CLeaning out the garage and all our drawers for torn or tight clothes as well as things we haven't worn in three years to give to charity. We've also torn out the playset on the side of our house and my dad presure-washed the deck and is in the process of sealing it. We've torn out the rotting flowers and most of our pine trees, and my dad build a huge planter box and installed several trelaces around our house. We made a new tabletop in our backyard that is hooked right under our kitchen window and we're putting a mosaic on that. My dad has also spent the better part of last week fixing the pool filter, which, unbeknowest to us has been brocken before we ever owned the house and that was ten years ago.  So, although this sounds busy, none of these tasks are finished. Theres still tree and bush branches that need to be brought down from the hill, the mosaic hasn't been completed, neither the painting on the side of the planter box. The planter box has no plants in it, and none of the trelases are nursing any vines right now. The boxes of toys and clothes and sheets have not been given to charity yet, so the garage isn't clean. But we're working on it, we really are. Monday I've sworn to paint the box, and hopefully the trees will be done by Tuesday afternoon. My dad's girlfriend has taken over the mosaic and we went to a few nursery's today to look for vines. My dad has also talked to a contractor and a landscaper about the whole mess.  Other than that things have been peachy. Becca's constantly an ass, and it seems that somewhere I royally pissed her off and now shes carrying the grudge. She thinks that she owns the world, and whatever she says goes, and there's no talking her out of it unless dad comtributes his two cents in our defence. But whatever, to each their own and as long as she stays clear I think everything will go along swimmingly.  I went driving today, first time on the freeway and not half as bad as I thought it would be. I dont know what all the fuss is about. Hopefully I'll have my licence in a month, but I'm not sure...I still need to take two out of three driving lessons with an instructor and the place I took my first lesson at is just trying to rip me off. Maybe that's waht I'll do today. Hmm....

      First let me point out that our team has been practising for four days. I went to two of these practises because I needed to study for finals the other two days. Before that, I lazed about for a month, and before that was swim team. I haven't played waterpolo since February. So we were all out of shape.  Our first tournement was today. I played 18 and unders, and it was my first time with a varsity team. The cool thing about it all was I learned a few things, and finally got to see Davis play.  The first two games were bad, 0-9 in both cases. It was hard, because we were all over the place, and were slower than the other teams. I guess everyone else at the whole freaking tournement had been practising for at least a month. So our coach wasn't too mad...but we did make a few mistakes, stupid mistakes.  I didn't get to play that much which is understandable with me being the only JV player and not really knowing the ropes yet. I was the only sub, and I feel bad because our team was exhausted.  The last game was awesome. We won, 5-4 and I made a clean beautiful shot. It was lucky though, I have to be honest. At least the refs were clean, and everything went by pretty smoothly. I got pretrty sunbured tho....I'll hurt tonight.  Dinner's calling...ciao

      The year is winding down, everyone is signing yearbooks and saying their goodbyes. Parties every weekend, and seniors packing up for college. Summer jobs, summer sports, and summer trips have all been arranged and people just can't wait for their lives to begin. No one's doing the homework, no one can bring themselves to sit down with a textbook to study when it's 87* outside and it doesn't get dark until 8:30. When there's only 3 more days of school left, can you blame them??? However, the only downside? FINALS. You have to tie yourself to a chair and study to make the grade, otherwise you're not going to be able to do anything short of breathing once your parent see that you have a C- in history. (Thats not me, thats a scenario). So, I've skipped out on waterpolo, a sport I'm soooo excited started up on Monday. I only went Monday. We have a though tournement Sunday. Yay!! But I am out of shape, and I will be playing with the 18 and unders, and I will have to shape up or I'll simply be keeping our coach company while everyone else is out in the field. But finals are more important, and I think that I've done pretty well so far. I guess we'll have to see. Two more tomorrow and I'm done. Then Friday I'll just cruise threw school, and it will all be over. Like a bad dream that's lasted way, way to long. lol.  Well, like man would say; "I'm out like a fat kid in dodgeball". PEACE~

      Its been a few days since I last wrote, and I thought that I should update it before I forget about my blog completely.  Nothing really interesting has happened. We got our yearbooks wendsday, and they look really good. Had a few people sign them today, but not a lot. Most of the teachers say they'll take them away if they see the books out in class, thier gunna give us the last day of school to sign them. Speaking of the last day, it's only 5 days away, the last day is a minimum day...so I'm excited.  Summer polo starts next monday, at the Armijo pool...but whatever, Its still going to be great. (The armijo pool is small, dirty, lots of chlorine, and sort of salty tasting) I didn't know that I'd miss waterpolo so much, and it only makes me happier that I joined in the first place. Angela's worried about her goalie possition, but no fear, I'm sure she'll still be awesome...even if wayne makes her play the field.  Becca and Me have been pretty okay. There have been a few small disagreements, but nothing major...no screaming or hitting or any of that nonsence.  Strangly, I'm in a good mood. I still have to get a job, I'm sort of running out of time...which sucks ass, but whatever. I have to start caring about things...whatevers sort of my motto now...not a good sign. At least the school year's almost over, so this 'whatever' phase wont do too much damage on my grades. I forgot to sign up for SAT's...that sucks ass too, by the way.

      Let's start this one off with something happy...shall we? Soon, I hope, I'll be getting my braces off. I'm hopeing before school starts so everyone can see my pearly whites. I'm also getting my licence soon, and I really hope it's before school starts. Technically I can take the test next tuesday, however I still need to take two of my drivers training lessons and my dad has yet to schedual them. But soon...thats what I've got my fingers crossed for.  For the update, my sisters, my mom, and I all went into San Fransisco...complements of her work. We got to hang around Union Square while she was training. It was fun. I love the city...so much to see and do, and just experiance. Every day somethings different...the vendors or the people. I just love it. China Town, Union Square, Uptown, The Embarcadaro and Peir 39 and well as Italian Town...thats my favorite. The little french corner and all that. So much different culture and history all smooshed into one city. I love it.  Becca's being a control bitch. If she can't have it her way, then its no ones way. For heavens sake she threw a fit over who got to watch a movie downstairs. Starts crying, and saying that she hated me just because we wanted to watch two different movies. SHe did the same thing in SF. "I dont want to go in there." "Why can't we go where I want to go?" "I've been there a million times." "Why can't I go off by myself?" "We have different ideas in my abilities." "I dont want you to have something I have, it's not fair. If you get it, I'm going to throw mine away!" She's so selfish. Nothing is a compromise to her, unless she gets 100% waht she wants. I think I'm going to tape the definition of 'compromise' to her forhead one day. The sad thing is, I've conplied with everyhting she wanted. SHe didn't want to hang with us in the city, fine. SHe didn't want me to get the same type of necklace, fine. She wanted to watch the movie, fine. ANd she's never said thank you...never returned the favor...never even acknowlegde that I'm trying to be nice.  I need to get away from her...a vacation on vacation, what a concept. Now I'm getting bitter and cheesy, I'm going to go read a book before polo starts.

      HAPPY belated 4th of July, everyone. I hope everyone had a great time and had the chance to watch some awesome fireworks. This year, for my family, was the first that the daughters...me and my two sisters...were apart. Me and Kim spent sunday with my mom at Raley Field in Sacramento and my sister, Becca, spent it with my dad here at home. They went to a company party and then bailed to see the fireworks in our own town. The fireworks we saw were mediocre at best, but it was by far the closest I've been to the actual launch site. We left the stadium right when they started and ended up across the street from where they were being lit when the end came. God, it was loud!  It was nice though, at Raley field the philharmonic played all the different military songs, and whoever belonged to the air force or army had to stand up when they heard the song being played and everyone shouted and clapped and patted complete strangers on the back or shook their hand...it was amazing...I'm proud for those people, I definatly think they deserved it.  Here at home, it's a little dull. We've been trying to finish the mosaic and painting and getting all the branches off the hill. It's coming along, but it's just coming along to slow. My dad and his girlfriend got in this huge argument and she took all her stuff and left. She took her tile cutters for the mosaic, so that only makes things harder. Off the subject, I really hate to see her go...I know my dad can be an ass sometimes, but I really liked her.  My dad's been in a little bit of a slump lately. I dont know how bad it is really, because he never flat out says anything until he simply can't take it anymore. But he's not sleeping well, and he's going into work late...I'm not sure what this is about. He's mad at us because we have all this time to finish these projects and their just not getting done and then the house is getting a little dirty again. I dont blame him, though. After all, he has to go to work and deal with all these problems and people and then he comes home, tired and unnerved to this house thats not filthy but getting there and to these three girls who've been sitting on the couch watching TV all day.  For the record, that's not  completely true, but I can see how he draws that conclusion. Now that I've made myself feel bad, and becca's here vacuuming...I'm going to go do some laundry and then maybe work on the mosaic a little.
