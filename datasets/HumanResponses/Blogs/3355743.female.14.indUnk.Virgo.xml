      i'm sorry for the things i said, i'm sorry for all that i've done, i'm sorry to make u feel this way, i'm sorry for all that you've been thru.  Thanks for being here for me, thanks for all the times u tried, thanks for the sacrifies u made, thanks for telling me everything.  But some things can neva be changed, but time cannot turn back, but then again u tried so hard, but its of no use at all  i took things too hard, i was so negative, i dint give u a chance to try, i couldnt take the pressure.  it all just went too fast, it has just onli begun, it will not change a thing, it will not change...a...thing..

      dear diary,today i've composed a peom...based on first instincts and wadeva i'm thinking momentarily...here goes..  Wad is love, tis' but a priceless thing. but we love to err, tho we make mistakes there is no right from wrong  sadness, takes over ur life when he has gone away, u juz take a dive  into the abyss of ur heart, u may not koe wad he is thinking, nor wad his heart desires coz tho u r wif him..only he can decide... his future.......  but thy boy who has crossed my life, took it away like the wind, not knowing wad he thinks,wad he feels, i am in obliviance..  he makes me feel sumwad depressed when he mentions her name i do not koe how he still feels i'm sinking away... but out of love..i carry on each miserable day  does he not koe how i feel..nv probably but there is hope...is there? i do not wan him to regret all i haf to say is dat i'll be here wen he needs me  coz love is not but a feeling but one from the heart to bring eternal joy to my life....  dear diary..he may not be exposed to the way i feel but i just wan him to koe dat i love him wif all my heart..but i do not wan him to regret all he has done for me...i'll wait..forever..wad is love? he is the answer...
