						   I have never tried to push my religious beliefs on anyone, because God knows Im nowhere near the example of Christianity. But this is story that I think needs to be told.  ----  My Dads best friend while I was growing up was a neighbor of ours that went to the same high school as him. His name was Mike. He was a ladies man, a mans man. In my perspective as a young boy, he was the embodiment of a man. A hard worker, charismatic, everyone who ever meet him instantly fell in love with him.   As I grew older he was always there. He use to go hunting, my brother and my Dad and Mike, and Mike would sit on the tailgate of his truck and tell me these amazing stories of all the mischief he had gotten into when he was younger. We would sit and laugh all night long, back when life was simple.   Mike was a heavy smoker. Whenever you crossed paths with Mile he would always have a Mountain Dew and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. It was his persona, it added to his character.   Mikes mother had always been active in the small Church of Christ located in the heart of our small community. But for some reason Mike was never a religious man, his life style didn't suit religion.  About two years ago Mike was doing some work around his mothers house, cutting up trees with a chainsaw for fire wood. He slipped and cut his leg and it required some stitches. After a few weeks Mike went back to the hospital to have the stitches taken out, Mike never left the hospital.   Now that I think about it he most have been sick for sometime. But he wasn't the kind of guy to let you know he wasn't feeling right. After they took the stitches out Mike must have told the doctor to run some test. Mike was dying of lung cancer. And his condition went on rapid fire. He went from working in the yard to being on a hospital bed in less than a week.   He was in the ICU for probably a week before we went to see him. He was slipping in and out of a coma, so the doctors would only allow the family to go back and see him. So my Mother and my Sister and I spent the time we were there talking to his family.   After about three hours Mikes mother comes from the ICU crying. Everyone went limp, and somewhere through her sobs she managed to say "No! No! These are happy tears."  Mike had woken from a three day coma and said that he wanted to be baptized, and that he wanted my father there. They called my dad at work and within an hour he was there. Everyone else had relocated to the water therapy center, and the preacher had already been there comforting Mikes mother. So I elected to stay and wait on my father.  When my dad got of the elevator I quickly motioned for him to follow me. We raced down the halls of the hospital and made it just in time to watch them lower Mike into the water, and come out as a new man. And now that I think back, that had to be the hardest part for me. Seeing my hero, someone I had always looked up to, so weak with the disease that he couldn't even lift his own arms made me understand the mortality of man.   After the baptism they relocated Mike to a normal hospital room so more people could see him. My father and I walked beside the stretcher and talked to Mike as we made the trip to his new room. Mike was losing his voice, but he ackownledge that he knew my father and I, and I remember him smiling as we talked to him.   When we made it to the new room we all stood around his bed. Me, my father, my sister, my mother, Mikes brother, Mikes mother, and Mikes daughter, and the preacher. He all held hands in a circle and prayed. I thank God that I was graced with the honor to be a part of that moment.   Three days later Mike died. And when we got the call I sat down and started writing. Because sometimes all I can do is just write(maybe sometime I will add what I wrote into here). And I gave it to Mikes mom, just to help her in her time of sorrow.  At Mikes funeral, at the very end, the preacher read what I wrote, and credited me for writing it. There, at that moment, in the remembrance of a great man and our last good-bye, they gave -me- the final statement. That was the most honoring day of my life.

						   When I walk into the doors of small town high school I walk past the group of gothics. The outcasts, the misunderstood ones. I say hey to a few that speak to me and I walk on down the hall to my locker, where my group of friends stand each morning. As I walk I see a kid sittin in the hall against the wall. Dressed in black with long shaggy hair, a note book proped on his bent knees, and hes lost somewhere inside his words as he trasnlates them to paper. They dont understand him, they look down on him, and sometimes I feel like I should be him.

						   Is it normal to feel so alone at such a young age? I don't mean alone as being un-accepted or popular. I've always had friends, more than I care for, and I "fit in." But this place, this county, this town, it feels so... shallow.  Everyone here is content. Their content with working in a factory on an assembly line from nine to five everyday. Content with raising a few kids and sending them to the same high school they went to. Content with dying without ever seeing the world in all its glory. Content without analyzing the depts of their emotions, and pondering the questions of life.  Sometimes I feel cursed with this mind God has given me. This artistic nature to try to produce something beautiful, and understand my emotions, and think deeper than the content factory worker. Its great in some sense, because some may say that Im talented. But imagine not being able to sleep at night because the windmill in my mind never stops turning. I lie awake, sometimes on the near point of an anxiety attack, thinking about death, or loneliness, or religion, or trying to justify my anger and resent. And I dont drift off to sleep. I become so exhausted sleep over takes me. And when I finally do sleep, its always black. No dreams. I remember having five dreams my entire life.   And then I have this desire, born of flame, and burning deep down within the very essence of who I am. Its burning, burning... burning. Its my calling. And Im not sure what its direction is, but its goal is greatness.   And sometimes at night, I lie awake thinking about the road, and adventuring like the hippies of yesterday.  God, I gotta get out of here.

						   I live on small plot of land that my mothers family has owned for over four generations. And standing tall, with its roots resting deep in the ground, is an old oak tree. Its branches still blossom with its green leaves, but they hang low, crooked down by the passing of time.   Underneath it, my grandfather purposed to my grandmother. My mother found solace sitting in its limbs as a little girl. My sister would hide in it, only when me and my brother were annoying her. And my dad would grill underneath it on those hot summer days, because it offered him the best shade from the treacherous Alabama sun. Underneath that same oak tree, I wrote my first song.  And now, even as time passes, I still find my self sitting under its branches, with my guitar and a pen and pad. I feel the wind, and I hear its song. I watch subconsciously as the shadows of the branches sway over my pad. I lean back against its bark, and wonder, why can't I be that oak tree.

						   "But hold on, it gets wrose, its like the setances are the only thing that helps when it hurts, I wake up and feel alone, till I grab a pen then Im gone, to place where my mind and soul relate, where these no pain and no hate, and in my minds eye I just wanna be great, but God must not have it wrote for my fate, Im just a lost soul on a endless journy through the nite, figuring wrong from right, and throw it all in a song, the only thing that will be left of me when Im gone, and listen as the angels sing on and on."      Exert from "Why I Write" - Me

						   "My rivers ran empty, and my world is dry, Im tired of being questioned, and tired of being asked "why I try,", the hourglass is empty, and Im out of time, Im tired of lying, no Im not ok, no everythings not fine."          -Chorus from "Im Not Fine." - Me

						   Life is full of trials and tribulations, ups and downs, and at one time or another everyone has there heart broke. But its those small fractions of a moment inbetween, were everything feels so perfect, that make it worth living.

						   Sometimes I sit and stare at the sky, and the gentle sway of the treetops line my sight, and the softness of the wind embraces me. And in that same soft wind, I hear a song, and the song always remains the same.

						   Im writing this post as a response to a question that I have heard numerous times, "How does your mind work when you start writing?"  ----  Imagine seeing a long hall way, lined with hundreds of doors on each side. Each door has a  name etched on it, but some only have question marks. Some of the doors open easily, with a simple turn of the door knob. Others remain locked.  When I take a pen and hold in my hands, or when I stare at an empty word doc., my mind goes to this hallway. I stand at the center surrounded by the doors. . . and then it happens.  All of the doors open, I dont mean they gently creak open, they fling open with so much vigor its as if they have been waiting all my life to open. My hand meets the paper and I start writing.  My mind races into each room, exploring it. And I keep writing, writing, writing. I write with so much intensity I break out in a cold sweat. I enter each room, exploring it, understanding it.   Some of the question marks are erased, their name replacing what I did not understand before. Love, Hope, Fear, Ambition, Science, Religion, Death; all of these doors are there.  And as soon as it began its over and Im left on my knees in the hall way. I look down at the paper, and sometimes I cant even recognize what I wrote.
