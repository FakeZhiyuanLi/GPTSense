						    In each blankness of my mind Let the numbness of time Yet the grief of my heart Aggravates painfully Eating my very being Rotting the core of my soul  My soulmate leaves me In wait for an endless longing Hurting my mind but This body remains strong Hoping it breaks, disintegrates  Into minute particles I wish The steady wind would carry With it the pain and the suffering I so embracing  Where come to, my love You leave me counting the time In slow motions of every second As I see blindly lest Think painfully to Thee love endlessly

						   Wretched and scorn      this body dissolves         in an air full of heat            surrounding the human form  Particles fly molten in the sky     droplets of rain pouring in vain       where do your things         fall in their place           embraced, caressed, and subdued?  And she who finds it     takes it and binds it        will touch the martyr of hearts         surface the happiness            the glow of her soul             and gives her a brand new form

						    Twice I looked through blurry glass  This journey began on coastal land New cold spring air took me off  To meet the sun-filled windy skies But little did I know that I Will land to find a lover's need For such a lust so unforseen Welcomed my frightened smile Tall he stood he bore  His anticipated style  I shook inside my seemingly relaxed awry Could he have felt me cower through  My naked heated desire?  And so began our travels To test frigid cold waters  To burn our scorching pyres He took the lead and as I watched  Him gripping, staring, standing, speaking I never did imagine such A beautiful human being  Though regularly sentimental His rigid masculine form moreso His lips moved with a pout That burned my skin I fumbled about  I felt his hands define The contours of my mind  As each bewildering caress Succeeded melting my fortress No more could I protect it From my ardent fueling fires He ruled with such intensity With careful thorough steps His eyes reflected clearer skies Did I seem to surmise? For each of his inured controlled And tempered stroke  Inwardly, savagely, pleasurably Filled and completed me.

						   The pale shadow disappears at dawn Will he return again to fill the void?  As memories of rides and times  Play on one's conflicted mind  My thin nimble fingers run through The soft grass of your hair  The sensitive palm of my hand Recalls the shores   Of glassy waters I found   Within the hearth of your neck  And learn I did of men Strong therefore resonant  Their profiles hide in soft  Unclaimed corners and calming tides  Valleys of your hills through Vastness of your mountains  I trek as midst of  My weary soft body  Traversely hike to Hunt your adrift desires

						    Here's something I wrote in random. I dedicate this to you.   Let me be your music's song and sing your heart's melody. Let me be the petals of the bud that's growing in your heart. Sing I may not of your true love's hymn. And grow I must not for your garden's room. But here I, with you sing and bloom For I am and will be love's instrument to your song

						   Where there're eagles that soar on high lands occupied by inhabitable mountains iced and blue from its sparkles freezing the sky in a quiet zone.  This land of fragrant pines touch the brown earth's wondrous floor as the heavily pregnant ocean gives life to its child sending salt and wind of her waters for a redolent fertile soil.  This land, and the sky, and the seas of earth's bounty find the garden in my soul for your love has brought them to what was unknowingly surreal.  My corrupted polluted heart stopped its thunderous beat from the moment the windows on the house of my being unhurriedly, leisurely, though tensely be unlocked and found sight of you.   - originally written in February 2004

						   He catches me falling from my skies But then I am buried deep in his eyes I sink tho' in the waves and Clear waters of burning desires  As the coals of my heart Burn inflamed of these fires

						   I want to lose myself in you Or you bury yourself in me I want to exchange dreams Of endless and tireless hunts I want to sink my body deep Or you sink to touch my pit Where the waters of my well Flood the timber of your desires.  I long to explore your hidden waves Or you explore my needy tides As our heated forms collapse We break and crumble into sand I want to be washed by your waters Or you be dribbled by my flow Of ebbs and tides we shall share The waterfalls of our desires.

						   Spring nights when shorebirds sing In the still of the cold evening Short of darkness through mellow Dim and grayish blue clouds Graze the sky in flocks of new  Think heavens lie beyond Those fires of orange, red And purple hues  Yellow pale and brown Airborne birds seek home In lonely trees come when 'Tis roots of sinewy blue Come alive risen by their coos

						    I want to kiss your mouth and have my tongue explore its depth.  I want you to kiss me back, soft and feathery at first and later as the warmth traces your loins, your kisses become hurried and hungry for more.  It will be hard to choose between who gives and who receives because we both want to do the same.  So we leave it to the moment as we allow our bodies to speak in an untested foreign language of love...   -  Ylang2   Reflection lights the river Spat by wispy rays of A full luminous moon  When the somber night Hushed lovers’ wails Only to send ripples on waters Unsettling ‘tis clear portrait   But they heave to meet Both heightened bliss Cuffing their wallowing Aches with every lash Two warm bodies Collapse, heaped on a  Lone surmountable shay    We sit on this place, I call it a chaise... we make love on its limited  space, our bodies curl and intertwine, until it is transformed into one.

						    We'd both be so spent by the end of the evening that we'd hardly be able to talk.  We wouldn't need to.  We'd be conversing with our eyes.    - SB   These are my uncomplicated desires.   I want a man who has the time and patience  to explore and discover the hidden secrets of my body.      Because I am on my way to middle age,  I am terrified at the thought  of hormonal imbalances and the pull  of earth’s gravity taking its toll on my once  dense and voluptuous body.    I am afraid of losing my sensitivity  to touch that has become routine  and without inventiveness, therefore  I want a man who will love to caress and  sensitize my soft skin, a man  not afraid of going into raptures at,  not failing to mention the femininity of my being.    I want to feel the approval and adoration  of a man as he affectionately  traces my body’s physical imperfections.   And as he brings me to climax I  will hold on tight, pulling him even closer to  bite his neck and his shoulders, releasing  moans of pleasure while he watches  the afterglow of my skin as he  takes pride in his complete manhood.    I want to die and be resurrected again.

						   As you lay  You breathe Into my heart  Tepid air as you exhale  A quiet moan escapes To call your god's name Taking the pleasure  I sustain  For every longing  In your waiting You speak to me  Of your desire  The fueling fires left By lost sighs Of long ago  From passion's youth  You moan and crave And follow suit Then as I hear  You calling  For my wise And skillful mastery To singe the dire Needs obvious   To my eyes You telling  Me a wanting vice To drench your scorching pyres  By waters from My own desires And like an angry Stallion’s howl  Succumbing freely Giving in to me  Again you breathe Again you lay  I hear you softly  Heat satiating from My tendering  You so acclaim  Only to hear  you  Whisper  but her name...

						    by Steve B.   A delicate scent lingers in my memory An exotic fragrance from a tropical land Warm sand with gentle surf  Line the shores of the islands in my dream.  I am not alone, in this dream A sensual creature,  A warm and sharing lover,  Holds me.   Together we explore,  Discover and create  We remain connected  Over miles of ocean,  Forest and mountain Our grip is firm, yet gentle We smile And continue our lives

						   Climb I will those mountaintops Of cold and sharp plateaus Deep I swim the vague oceans  Of unsettling breaking currents Wade through I the dense green forests Of dark and shady woods  But love ascertained  Is life endured  And love existed Will be subsisted  In no way you will ebb like tides Nor come down from the soaring sky Not stay inside my forests fires But breathe to live and as I die this love can thus revive.

						   Your wooden desk sits The apple in red hue  Mystifying the magic Of your heart’s wont  For every child of ‘Tis earth’s finer gift  You water the roots  So bloom they shall  Each one will grow  With molded pride Because your guide  Reflects their eyes   Ripen them children  Of a bright tomorrow  With letters, numbers,  With logic and sorrows   Hand in heart faith intrinsic  Your tongue of wisdom  Your heart of virtues  Tainted with placid love   So chaste and pure You teach, you seek  Their vision, their glories And flower they shall   With blooms of greatness For once there sat a fruit Of labor of whom they call  Their beloved teacher…

						   Her shadow forms a lady slowly dances her silhouette eerily follows cold air in misty morn  She wanders on hallways in search for better songs but drawing the wispy clothing that drapes she pants, she groans with worry and strain  Hovers farther she climbs the wearing stairways those eyes alluring the daunting death's way  Nearing the graves of  ruined pure hearts she stops at bay  where crosses line  the moist humps of clay  For 'tis life to end hers was to descend sink her spirits no longer she prays and with tears streaming  there awaits her sepulchre

						   how does one feel when the sky turns to gray the threat of the pour heavy in one's soul  amidst the dark clouds a lightness of feeling it is but a drizzle don't be afraid of ripples  though a storm has its warning and one feel its coming yet the faith in the being nay darkness even of evenings  come out of the rain feel brightness with no pain life with its suffering  in tolerant vain   don't be afraid of ripples for life is but a drizzle

						   As I lay on the grass I am showered by rays Of the smiling sun Crystallizing the sky Sending nutrients to The soil drying tears Of the white winter land  With the fine grain Of sand in my heated Deserts your mirage Appears clear like glass Watering, quenching  Dousing my abandoned thirst  Opening the hidden pores Of my dusty brown skin  I am moistened bedewed And submerged by the warm Lusty mist of your storm

						    A bud I no longer am.   Once again  Petals of your flower  Open to capture  The sun in your smile  Drink the waters  Of your desire  Bloom in folly  As dew seeps through   Bear I shall fruits thee love.

						     on a moonlit night the cold draft sends shivers you wrap me with a lover's embrace i am warm in your love   - Your Flower     Satiny white sheets and Bleary hintless walls   My pale sheathing mantle neglects  The tanning rays of the summer sun    Where mornings come  Evenings feel chilly be found A weather housed between walls and closed doors  Refined, reduced to shaded borrowed places    I hardly feel  Through my cocoon self    Where lacey pure  Pillowcases give hint  Of spring to summer spell  Its bleached color still reminisce snow    Where an absence of hue  Dictates our sensitive fleeting sight With that I relate this pretentious belief  We’re cast in pale winter land   I wonder  If summer’s defiantly begun   Where cottonwood flowers  Flutter around the noon sky.   A superficial snowfall is seemingly what  This floating efflorescence suggests   Where the scorching dry sun  Creates a mirage of dissolving  Particles in aqueous ground  An oasis on the paved cemented bed     I eagerly thirst  For sheer waters of spring   Where above its concrete surface Blurry vapours rise slow  Moving in transparent waves A motion of see-through fiery glass  Where this nameless season’s beauty In you, with you, from you White as linen in pureness In your rare singular soul   I am in heat For your eager touch   Where the sun in its spectacle  Of light and vital energy  Its powerful rays capture Your handsome physical form  Where your smooth blanket of skin Drape my untanned stark form Sending sparks of the summer heat My tempered soul calmed by your winter song   I am then recast  I am in awe In a dreamlike trance Bewildered by your glow
