       Dear Viewers, thank you so much for viewing my website.Here you can't find your idol's biography except mine.There's simply just so much that i want to tell someone who are willing to lend his ears to listen to me. However,i couldn't find one. Now,i'm relying on this and only this to let it all out.     -[chatterbox_163@hotmail.com]Nurul -25th May 2004 (20:14)    I'm an average lil gal.I'm really damn talkative yol! tats y my fren, Sunarti gave me a nick,[chatterbox].People can see me hapi n smile but they dun noe wat's playing n bothering in my head! It was because, i dun tend to show them wat i felt n think! They simply judge me by my mistakes. They dun even think wat positives things i have done in the past.     Thank God that i'm a patient person! I tend to "play" things slow n juz keep goin on and on wif life. It was juz hurt!  NO WORDS COULD EXPLAIN THE PAIN I WAS SUFFERING ALL TIS WHILE.      There's alot of positives & negatives i have gone through in my life. From  FAMILY  to  SCHOOL  to  FRIENDSHIPS  to  JEALOUSY  to  RELATIONSHIPS  and  BACK TO ME . It was juz damn  complicated  wen i tink 'bout it! Ya it's true tat we're not supposed to think of our past. But i juz couldn't help it! I WANT A SOLUTION TO ALL TIS! IT MAY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SOLVED BUT IT WAS NOT!      It was true enough tat people actually judge me by my MISTAKES. Somehow,they tend to BELIEVE all nonsense from other people's mouth without investigate it at the first place! They blindly n stupidly spread to other idiots they know. Well, it was juz damn hurt man! Well, thanx 2 my kuzin for sueing one of the spreaders! (TATS HOW BAD I AM WEN THEY ARE TOO MUCH!) as for the rest, u better count urself lucky coz i dun caught u!    >>Tats life..       I may seem hapi n cheerful as if i hav notin goin on back home. Well guess wat? I DO! well, it seems tat i tend to 4get 'bout a certain ting at certain times. So i dun mainly show my feelins to ppl. Family are OK but i tink it was juz me n my head! i dun noe wat's the problems actualli..but i DO noe tat i have one back home.       In school n Friendship, i was known as the talkative or CHATTERBOX to be exact ya.      There's juz somebody down there trying to be ME n it was juz damn irritating! hmm..ppl mistaken HER as ME! all the BAD tings SHE did,WILL reflect on ME! all the positives she did will reflect on HER lar! IDIOT FUCKING ASSHOLE!I remembered one day when SHE n her GUY romancing at my void deck n my granddad n other neighbour happened 2 see it! they tot it was ME!! and there goes my GOOD NAME!! I WAS DAMN MAD!     There's more actualli. One thing tatTRULY HURT ME wen my OWN BESTFREN betrayed me. SHE said bad tings about me bhind my back but act cool infront of me! I was damn hurt wen the news spread like jam! Then one day SHE broke up wif her boyfren. HER boyfren irritates me each time askin me bout HER! So i pitied him. I told him wat he wanted to know b'coz they already broke up wat? So? I dun make them break up.. They can noe bout their ex wat? so i told him.      I dun expect it to be so serious after that conversation. The next morning in sch,my fren was in bad mood n dun even talk 2 me! hmm..i felt bad ar.. then SHE called me BETRAYER!! am i? Never ever had i done tat neither do i have the intention of doin tat! SHE DID! i endured..(wat i mean is, she betrayed me by talking bad tings bhind my back). well, i dun wan 2 talk bout the burried tressure hunt..but i wan 2 let it all out.. (sori).      there was juz so much tat i wan 2 confess.. but i tink it hurts now.. igtg.. probably next time i'll tell.. take care yol..  -21:25 (nuRuL..)                      It Hurts To Know I'm sittin down here on my chair thinking about THEM n me. Hi there i'm back.    IT HURTS TO KNOW is my theme today.          First of all, i wanna apologize to those involved in my life. You guys have gone through ups n downs with me. I'm so sorry to burden your life.          Like i said earlier on, i DO have problems in my RELATIONSHIP. DAMN! it was just hurt! Yes i've been in relationships but it didn't work out.   I'VE YET TO EXPERIENCED WHAT A TRUE LOVE IS. I'm cursed!          Loving others is a simple matter. I know. Try to do it yourself. It's hard. It felt like burning your own heart! Why must be me got trapped in this DILEMMA?         "I've known many but have to choose one, called me a bitch and make me cry, my heart cries sobly in silence, can't let it all out 'coz no ears cares" -taken from WHEN THERE"S YOU IN ME, written by myself.          I'm caught in the middle. Don't know who to blame. I'm down each time i think of them. Well, it hurts to know that your love ones actually carrying the burden b'coz of you. I felt that way 'coz i think i've made them suffered! I've tortured their hearts and feelings. I'm so cruel!                That's the past. No longer happening now. I'm sad thinking. Sitting by the window crying without tears. My heart aching each time.                 Truth hurts and love can't be trusted. If you don't understand, let this do the explanation.  >>Mimi really love this guy named Jack. In the other hand, she already had a boyfriend named Dan. Jack has a fiance but kept it from her. One day, Mimi found out the truth herself. Mimi and Jack had a big fight. The truth about Jack revealed. She was damn hurt. Dan did not know anything but felt that his love for her was cheated. Mimi decided to tell Jack the truth about her n Dan.The three of them was cheated. The truth had hurt them badly. Their love n feelings for each other can't be trusted b'coz you will never know whether it is for real or juz.....?   -end 31.5.04 (13.05)
