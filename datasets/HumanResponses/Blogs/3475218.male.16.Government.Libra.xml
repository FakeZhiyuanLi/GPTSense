      Good Evening,  Tonight I, Sandy Mackay, present you with my review of the movie "Troy".  Now although this movie received high ratings as well as two thumbs up, I have a different opinion.  Ladies and Gentleman I present to you, TROY vs. THE MAN WITH NO NAME TRILOGY.  Stars: Troy Starred:  Achillies - Brad Pitt  Paris - Orlando "Lando" Bloom  Hector - Eric Bana  Agamemndon - Brian Cox  Helen of Troy - Diane Kruger  Menelaus - Brendan Gleeson  Old Spartan Fisherman - Manuel Cauchi  Brad Pitt's Ass - Orlando "Lando" Bloom   The Man With No Name Trilogy Starred:  Clint Eastwood - The Man With No Name (occasionally referred to as Joe)  Mexicans - Mexicans  Enough said.  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Writing:  Troy:  David Benioff ripped the plot of Troy from Homer's "The Iliad".  I have read this epic poem and believe that the movie hardly does it justice.  The Man With No Name Trilogy:  A completely original idea, complete with Mexicans, guns, dames and, of course, Clint Eastwood.  You will notice that during the movie Clint E. does not talk much, as he lets his pistol talk for him.  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Acting:  Troy: As cardboard as a board made out of cards.  Man With No Name Trilogy: Clint Eastwood, need I say more?  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Length:  Troy:  approximately 2 hours and forty-five minutes.  Man With No Name Trilogy: Three Movies which can be watched at your leisure.  Troy is damn long, too damn long.  My advice to you is to read the poem, it will take less time and you will be a better person for it.  The Man With No Name Trilogy is three movies, hence you are able to split up the time.  Point, The Man With No Name Trilogy.   Comfort:  Troy: Crappy, Whitehorse Theater.  Man With No Name Trilogy: Couch.  Fold-out couch.  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Fight Scenes:  Troy: I must give a little credit here, as the fight scenes were pretty well done, although they would have been better without Brad Pitt.  Man With No Name Trilogy:  No talking, just shooting.  Point, Each side gets a half point, it's a tie.   Original Score:  Troy: A random lady singing in a foreign language while hundreds of people die.  Man With No Name Trilogy: The classic western score, I will try my best to re-incarnate it in text form.  Doodle loodle lu....Wah, wah, wah.  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.    Overall Entertainment Value:  Troy:  Too long, too much romance, too few boobs.  I half expected Johnny Depp To show up.  It was exactly the kind of gong show he would appear in.   Man With No Name Trilogy: Guns, drinking, CLINT EASTWOOD.  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Final Score:  THE MAN WITH NO NAME - 7.5   TROY - .5   This concludes my review of the movie "Troy".  I hope that those who read this save themselves seven bucks and head on down to Wal-Mart (which I traditional don't support, but will this one time) where they can purchase The Man With No Name Trilogy for twenty-three dollars.  Remember, any movie with Brad Pitt's ass, is no movie at all.  Sincerely,  Sandy Mackay

      Good Evening,  Today, as I lay bleeding in the hospital emergency room, I realized something: I don't like any of the people running for Prime Minister.  Whether it be Liberals, Conservative, NDP, the Bloq or Green Party all of them are pretty much playing the same tune.  More money for healthcare, more money for education, more money advertising scandal cover-ups.  Each party is promising the exact same thing, excluding the Bloq, because there are no real issues that Canadians are split on.  Where are the good old days of conscription and nuclear weapons?  Nowadays the biggest issue going for us is gas prices.  Canada is more united than ever because everyone wants the same thing, again excluding the separatists, and it is because of that the Conservatives and Liberals will split most of the votes, although, the NDP will have one of its best outings ever.  The final verdict: a Liberal minority government.  Which brings me to my point about the individual leaders of the parties.  Because the platforms are so closely related the election has been reduced to a couple of school kids tossing insults at each other across the playground.  That's right Paul and Steve.  Each side has said goodbye to politics and is now trying to make the voters believe that they are the better man.   It seems to me that all Martin and Harper are doing is insulting each other, can you say "Gong"?  Congratulations to Jack Layton for staying out of all this crap, you're taking the high road and, even if your ideas are a bit out there, you will still get many a vote, mostly from young Canadians.  Therefore, for the reasons stated above, I have no choice but to run for office myself.  Vote Sandy Mackay in 2004 and not only will you get a cinnamon bun with every ballot, you will also get the satisfaction of mocking the rest of those buffoons when they are beaten by a sixteen year old.  Of course, I can't just jump right into federal politics.  I'll start small, with a win in the Room 210 election.  Then, maybe school president, the mayor of Whitehorse, the Premier of the Yukon, the member of parliament of Yukon and finally Prime Minister.  Or, if all of that falls through, I'll be a senator.  Sincerely, Sandy Mackay

      Good Evening,  Well friends, as I depart on my great journey across this land I have only one regret.  My inability to update this website will weigh heavily on my mind and greatly impact the enjoyment of my summer.  I hope that I will be able to get to internet access station but, even If I do, it will not be very often.  I hope that you can forgive me for leaving you with nothing to read, except my previous post of course, but it cannot be helped.  Maybe, just maybe, you could pick up a book, that goes for you too Stephen Harper.  Today I will devote the second half of my post to ragging on Stephen Harper, mainly for accusing Paul Martin of supporting child pornography.  Come on man, learn how to run a campaign.  First off, you look like a dick for saying it and it's not going to win you or your nominations any more votes.  Secondly, the timing was terrible.  The press release was issued the day after the young girl in Toronto's murderer and rapist was found, not a good time to be talking about child pornography.  Come on Stephen, be a man.  If you can't legitimately win an election don't stoop to such low levels that even your own party members don't support you.  Situation ringing any bells Stockwell Day?  My advise to you, and any other aspiring polititions follows:  Prime Minister in 5 Easy Steps  Step 1: Grow a Beard - How can you not vote for a man with a beard, women with beards are another story however.  Step 2: Do things that make you look good - Kiss babies, pick up garbage, sing anthems at hockey games.  Step 3: Attend Mr. Sullivan's class - You might even learn something.  Step 4: Obtain your landed immigrant status - No one wants to vote for an illegal immigrant, except Vancouver.  Step 5: Once your beard is really long tell the voters that if elected you will shave it off and donate the proceeds to cancer.  Then grow it out until the next election.  There you have it, Sandy Mackay's guide to being the Prime Minister of Canada in 5 easy steps.  Damn, I am good aren't I.  Sincerely,  Sandy Mackay

      Good Evening,  Well, the exams are over for myself and many others around the world.  It is time, my friends to rejoice in the knowledge of the lack of knowledge you will receiving this summer.  With the exams finished I, Sandy Mackay, will be free to write more posts than I have been in the past.  So maybe, on one of the chilly, rainy summer days, you and your sweetheart or maybe your dad, can curl up together and read my website late into the night with only the light of the monitor to guide you.  While out tests may be just finishing, the political leaders of Canada are just getting started.  Last week both the French and English debates were held, and I must say I am throughly disgusted.  I had just settled in with my bowl of popcorn for a long night of political duels, my goal being to decide who to convince other people to vote for, when from the get go I was treated to not a debate, but I fight in the schoolyard.  I can hear half the mother's in Canada, "Steven , Paul, look I don't care who started it just go to your rooms!  Gille, what did I tell you about French separation?  That's right, no, bad, bad Gille.  And you Jack, What did I say about talking with your mouth full of moustache?"  I have three simple words to describe the night of bickering and interrupting: Tsk, Tsk, Tsk.  After witnessing the attitudes of the four main party leaders, I have been left with no choice on who to vote for.  After ruling out the right wing religious CHP and the Marijuana party, whose standard reply to ever question asked to the representative at the BYTE debate was, "We're just here to legalize pot, man",  I have decided on, THE GREEN PARTAY.  That's right, I am voting for a bike mechanic.  Hey, If a drug-dealing, truck-driving, Watson Lake-living, right wing wacko can be elected Premier, why not?    Sincerely,  Sandy Mackay

      Good Evening,  I decided that because you devoted readers spend way too much time on the internet and not enough time watching CBC I am going to include daily headlines on my site.  These can be viewed by scrolling down just a little farther.  Ahh the miracles of modern technology, where any old guy can pretend he's doing the public a favor by creating the headlines, when all it actually took was a copy here and a paste there.  Now on to the latest election news.  As many of you know,Jack Layton is the leader of the New Democratic Party.  What many of you don't know is that Canadians don't traditionally support political figures with facial hair.  Well, Jack Layton has decided to defy tradition which, as we know from social studies, socialists do best.  He has kept his moustache   and is the first political figure to do so since that memorable summer where Pierre Elliot Trudeau grew a beard.  While I support the change, I myself am growing a hefty red beard, I do not agree with his choice of moustache.  It is of the small, wimpy variety, with little to no clout.  Come on  urlLink Jack  get yourself something manly,  urlLink like this  or maybe  urlLink this one .  Yar, that's manly.  Anyway, good luck to you and your beard, may it bring you many more votes and may it kick Stephen Harper in the balls.  Sincerely,  Sandy Mackay

      Good Evening,  Today, the world commemorates the fifteenth anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen Square.  In 1989 student protestors took to the streets to fight the Chinese government.  The unarmed supporters of democracy were performing a peaceful demonstration.  Chinese forces  were sent to disperse the protestors, and when they would not leave they were shot and killed.  The Chinese government has never released official numbers, but it was believed the death toll was over 100.  One brave student stood up to the tanks and the  urlLink photograph  has embodied the spirit of the Chinese rebellions.  But, here in North America, we watch our hockey and eat our fast food, blissfully ignorant of the situation around the world.  We do not know how good we have it here.  I know I am starting to sound like Mr. Sullivan, but we were not shot at on the way to school today.  We did not have to fend off a barrage of racial insults while walking down the street.  We are not shot for standing up for what we believe in.  We are extremely lucky.  We must stand up and get involved to keep our country the way it is and improve the lives of those living in other countries.  If we don't, then the bleak picture painted by Mr. Sullivan might not be too far off.  Sincerely,  Sandy Mackay
