      Well my life has been revolving around work, I haven't done anything really. I hung out with mike and Kendall the other night which was horrid, not because of the company, but because we watched.. something something "teenage drama queen". Only to appease kendalls little sister. It was such a horrible movie.. it's hard to explain, I think the worst part was that this girl was supposed to be 15.  Anyways like I said.. nothing has been happening..  I miss coreena, ya, thats right.. I miss her, I haven't seen her in a while and it sucks.  I'm going to  Vancouver  tomorrow so I'm sooo excited to see Dinah. I  really  miss her, and we're going to do fun things.. like I'm going to Ikea with my mom. hah. Which to me, is great fun. Anyways then when I come back Dinah is going to come with us, which is great as well. yayy. I hate how I am always having to co-ordinate things around my stupid STUPID job. Although I had fun working last night with Chelsea and Justine and Ida and.... damn it..... I forget her name. But it was fun, amazingly.

      Well. I was rather upset yesterday. I can't go to Vancouver because of stupid work.     And I have been doing nothing and I sooo wanted to go to vancouver. Owell. I was so close to tears, thats how much I wanted to go.     Lets see.. my life has consisted of.. Harry Potter.. but I finished that book a couple days ago. I read it in 3 days. woo hoooo.    I have worked.. seen my dad.. hung out with my mom.. yup. That's it. I guess I should start doing  something.   meh.    I have this weird structure that surrounds my working. I hate it, and at the same time love how it gives me something to do.    I think I am becoming much to anti-social. I just want to stay in my home.. and do nothing.

      Work today was unimaginably horrible.  I was larthagic and dragged my feet, and old man told me to get my act together, and yes.. It was bad, and they had a horrible new person, I don't care if I'm mean, I hated her. Always butting in and telling me where she was going every fucking second..  Honestly I have no problem helping her when she needs it, she's new and I was the exact same way, but I swear I wasn't quite as bad.. maybe I was just blinded... wow I can't say that without breaking into song... ahem.. "BLINDED BY THE LIGHT..."    anyways. It was horrible.. I'm still sick...    I have been a hermit lately.. always a hermit... so sad. Owell. I don't care if I have no contact with the outside world, maybe I will when school starts again and I have alienated anyone who may have cared, but honestly..  I don't care anymore.  I live so very VERY close to the school, that now I can be there only during classes where I may be semi-interested in whats going on.      Well. I just had a chat with my mom, why is it that I talk about personal aspects of my life in my "blog", well I can't help it.  But I was just talking to my mom, and she was crying,  and I just never realize how sad she is about her mom, I mean they were really close and I guess it just really upsets her sometimes. She's drunk. hah. That helps.. so she was somewhat blabbering abotu how she is  always  sad about her mom.. but she hides it from serge and me so we don't have to see her upset. I was crushed.. but it's true, I never know what to do when my mom is upset, I mean.. it's rare.. because she has to be the strong one I suppose. And i'm not used to.. "comforting" her. I just never realized how she is always sad and she won't let us see it.. It really made me sad. So now I'm sad.. my mom's sad. My dad's here and he seems to be oblivious. Why? I don't know. It's just so weird. I  hate  it.    Anyways, this went from anger to sadness very quickly. But it's time for me to eat dinner.. wow I hate this.     We're going to India in April now. I think that's what set my mom off.. talking to her cousin in India on the phone. They hadn't talked since my grandma died, and they were really close. humbug. Life sucks, and is so very very unfair.

      Well well well... cleaning coreena's room was a blast. haha. I have to say, I love to organize.  That is.. how cool I truly am.  &nbsp;  Last night me and coreena watched Elephant. Which I have to say was a great film, but it was very disturbing to me. I think it was being able to see how the "killers" could do these horrible things with no remorse. And to think.. the one killer was the guy we liked the best.. untill we found out he had a fetish for killing people. But the way the film was put together was really amazing. You get to know all these people.. and they all die... poor benny.. poor clueless black benny.... trying to.. be a hero?  &nbsp;  Anyways.. my summer is care free.  Going to start a documentary with ween.. and it will be great.&nbsp; a little mockumentary?  &nbsp;  I have a piece of blue berry pie waiting for me..&nbsp;I think im going to read one of my favorite books over again.. I dont work until thursday.. Im planning on going to vancouver.. so really ... life is grand. I worked out my rift with Mike.. I bellieve... although im not entirely sure.  &nbsp;  oh yes.. I cant read or write comments because my computer is messed up. It wont open little windows and it wont let me open the dvd-rom drive. So Im going to use blogger comments to see if that works.  &nbsp;

      I came to a realization about the fact that I am in horrid shape.&nbsp; Yesterday my brother my mom and me went for a walk with Bob and Madison. My brother decided to run (up hill) with Bob to get some energy out for him, so of course Madison not wanting to be left behind starts to run.... now... Madison has a  very  long leash and it was as long as it could go.. and he was  pulling  me up this hill, while I screamed for him to stop because I couldn't handle the running... and when I say hill.. it was more of a incline... and so me and madison were trailing serge and bob and I honestly was dying. Madison is so  small  but he kicked my ass. It was a bit of a defeat. I had to sit down and rest hah. I think It's a good thing that we have gotten Bob so maybe I wont be in quite so horrible of shape.&nbsp;I mean I may be skinny.. that.. means nothing. heh... &nbsp; Today Im going to be working.. and cleaning.. my moms putting me to work after I work. it's cruel.

      Wow. I do love this new blogger. three shouts for blogger! Oh the joy of being a computer  nerd .  &nbsp;  Well today I went in the car with my mom and my brother, and we went to duncan, once again, three shouts for duncan! heh.. We drove right past the SPCA and the guilt that followed was horrible, luckily I was driving so I couldn't focus on it. I just stopped going to the spca.. I have too much sympathy and I didn't feel good about going, so I stopped.  &nbsp;  We were in duncan to buy blue berries, which I love too much for words.. almost.. almost as much as pie.. I love pie.... blueberry pie? Almost as much as coreena's cherry pie.  yes   &nbsp;  While driving.. I came to a three way stop.. almost.. unsure if I had the right of way to turn left I asked where I go, so my brother and my mom respectively&nbsp;yell&nbsp;"Go!" and "Go straight!" so.. I was rather confused and slammed on the brakes in the middle of the "intersection" causing the standard car to stall as the clutch wasn't in fast enough. So my brother was  screaming  at me and I was  screaming  at him while cars watched us, So I just went, in front of cars, could have killed us, my screaching tires as to not stall the damn thing, hahaha. It was absolutely  horrible.  But I pulled out alright as it seemed like 10 min. it was around 10 sec. I decided standard is the devil, but above all driving with my brother is the devil.  &nbsp;   Interesting   day ..  well   not   really ..  heh ..&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I had waited two weeks to get a book I really wanted from the library, I get it.. and it's the wrong book in the series, so I cant read it.. I was bummed out... bummed right out.  ahhh the trivial days of my summer...&nbsp; I truly am a nerd. And the kingfishers outside are going insane.

      I have a new blog.. I felt it was time.  I didn't plan on doing anything today, as I never do do anything (I always feel as if I have bad english.. "do do"), but I went to coreenas which was pleasent. Brit was there.. I felt fat and ate mcdonalds BURGER. never again.. it was a first. but oh never again...  Me and Coreena watched "Win a date with tad Hamilton" haha, because we truly are cool.. and it was every bit as dumb as I thought it would be. truly.. people are so stupid.. but eric from that 70's show made it good.. because he is so cool. pale skinny kid.. ahhh my type.  It ended up being a good day for me.. minus mike getting anal. ANAL. sorry.. I couldn't help it.. PUN intended. well im a gamer and i had way to much laughing today with my sore mouth.. if only coreena would stop fucking britneys dad my mouth could heal properly.  I will have an original template someday.. not now.

      Well I'm in Vancouver. It's a little odd to me because Mike is in Vancouver too for pride, so I could see him or something, or.. ya. Which is just weird. I really have to phone him,..  So yesterday me and my mom and kathy went to Ikea while Dinah worked, and then we came home, I sat on the computer.. and then we went to dinner at the chinese restaurants of old times. It reminds me of days of living in vancouver. ohh tan tan noodles where are you in ladysmith?  Today there is many things we might do, but I'm not really sure. I want to go to the vag exhibit and see Andy, I mean he goes everywhere with me I bet he'd like to see his own exhibit too. We might go see the parade, my mom wants to go to a nursury of course... But how interested I am in looking at plants is yet to be seen.  Dinah is not coming back with me due to her wanting some rest from work.  I know you'll read this dinah, and hey, this is my rest,. at your house. hah.
