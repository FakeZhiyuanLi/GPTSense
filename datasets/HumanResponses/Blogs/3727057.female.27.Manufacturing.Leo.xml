      My friends and I are godchasers.  we love god with everything we have, and when there's a powerful move of god somewhere, we chase after him, because we want more of god.  my friends are going on such a god-chasing trip in a few hours.  Here's a little background.  when the jc radicals first started, we took a trip up to Toronto, Canada to a church that was experiencing revival.  Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship.  It was an experience.  While there were some things that we were never before really exposed to, so all of us came back with different opinions of the trip.  We had a meeting with our pastor, and he explained some things to us and put our minds at ease.  It was a very good experience, one I wish i was able to do again.  but, I unfortunately can't much afford it right now.  With credit card bills, and upcoming weddings, and house bills, etc. the money i would have used can be put to a more practical use for me.  Now, i'm not saying that i don't want to go, because i really do want to have this experience with my friends, i am just unable to do so at the present time.    Lord, I pray for all my JC Radical family as they go on this journey to experience more of you.  As they drive up, lord, put a hedge of protection around the van and whoever is driving (paul, heather, andy) give them travelling mercies and a safe journey.  let them go with open minds, open hearts, to experience what you have all set up for them to experience.  you know that they are going to experience things that they have never seen before lord, i pray that they are open to new things and moves of your spirit.  let them not be closed minded, and if they have questions that they ask the JC radical leadership whom you have put into place.  i pray that they have an awesome time of fellowship in getting to know each other better.  i pray that although tempers may flare as they always do, that things are said with the right heart and the right spirit.  Bring them home safely lord, and brimming with excitement over what you have done in their lives over the weekend

      I opened up my bible this morning to Genesis chapter 6, where it tells the story of noah.  I am amazed at the amount of faith that noah had in god.  god came to noah and told him that he was going to destroy all the living creatures on the earth because it had become corrupt and filled with violence.  but because of noah being the only righteous and blameless man on the earth at the time, he and his family were spared.  god told noah to build this huge vessel...450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high!! WOW!!  now, it doesn't say in the bible how long it took noah to build the ark, (people have speculated that it had taken noah over 100 years to build it) or how old he was when god first approached him.  it does say that noah was 600 years old when the flood happened! can you imagine that?  Noah had so much faith in god, that when god told him to build the ark because he was going to destroy the earth, noah said, okay god...and he started building the ark.  and people came to noah all through that time and made fun of him for building such a huge vessel, and when noah told them that god was going to destroy the earth, the people just laughed at him..but still, noah's faith never wavered one inch..he kept on building the ark, because he knew that one day the rains would come and wipe out every living creature on the earth, save for noah, his family and whatever animals were on the ark.  after the flood was over and the waters receded, god blessed noah and his sons and told them to multiply and fill the earth.  noah lived another 350 years after the flood.  that means he was 950 years old when he died!  amazing, isn't it?  I don't know if i would be able to do what noah did.  i don't if i would have the faith that noah had to do what he did for the lord..the word does say, walk by faith, and not by sight.  dear jesus, please help me build my faith..i want to be so excited when i talk about you, and i'm not, and for that i am ashamed because you have done so much for me and i don't deserve it. but with your grace, please help me to understand all the thoughts i have, and all the feelings i have because i don't want them to distract from what you have in store for me

       Romans 5:1-11   1Therefore, since we have been made right in God's sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us. 2Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of highest privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God's glory.  3We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they are good for us--they help us learn to endure. 4And endurance develops strength of character in us, and character strengthens our confident expectation of salvation. 5And this expectation will not disappoint us. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.  6When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners. 7Now, no one is likely to die for a good person, though someone might be willing to die for a person who is especially good. 8But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners. 9And since we have been made right in God's sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God's judgment. 10For since we were restored to friendship with God by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be delivered from eternal punishment by his life. 11So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God--all because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us in making us friends of God.

      TODAY I GOT A BURDEN, AND I FELT THAT I SHOULD PRAY, FOR GOD'S SPIRIT SEEMED TO TELL ME, THAT YOU WERE HAVING A BAD DAY.  I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT THAT PROBLEM IS, BUT I SURE DO KNOW THE CURE, AND IF YOU'LL ONLY LET HIM, GOD WILL KEEP YOU SAFE AND SECURE.  IN LIFE THERE'S ALWAYS PROBLEMS, CROPPING UP TO SPOIL OUR DAY. BUT MY FRIEND, YOU KNOW THE ANSWER, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS "PRAY".  IF YOU STILL FEEL YOU'RE DEFEATED, AND YOU WANT TO RUN AND HIDE, JUST REACH OUT AND I'LL BE THERE, STANDING RIGHT THERE BY YOUR SIDE.  SO REMEMBER, WHISPER JESUS, FOR HE'S JUST A PRAYER AWAY, HE'S SO CLOSE THAT YOU CAN TOUCH HIM, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS "PRAY".
