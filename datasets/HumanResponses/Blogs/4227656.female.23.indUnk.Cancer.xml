						   So...this youth group.  It doesn't come with instructions.  Hmmm that reminds me of what new parents say about kids.  Is this the same?  Am I now a mother preparing for her newborn?  Or am I merely a caretaker and God is the father of this new baby?  Maybe I should know the answer to that question. I need to have a network of people around me already in the ministry, but so many of them are already too busy.  I understand that, but then feel left standing in a foreign land without instructions.  The instructions?  Hmm maybe the Bible, but ... then there's the age old question of how to decode some of the answers.  And also the age old problem of waiting on God. So here I am standing on the border between my old life and a totally foreign land.  I barely speak the language and barely understand the culture, but I have a passion burning so hot inside me that if I don't move it will consume me ... destroy me. I have to start a youth group.  I get to.  But ... how. I ask the question and it seems to bounce off the empty spaces around me.  They say that they are there to support me, but I don't think they really understand what it's like until they too have to step out there and try it. A name?  A theme?  What to study first?  Do I talk and sign at the same time?  Do I relate to only the Deaf?  Do I include the hearing?  Do I start a middle school plus high school group?  Do I seperate it?  What do I do when I get there? They trust me.....What an overwhelming responsibility.

						   Well, it's getting to the point that I'm beginning to feel spred too thin and can barely keep from crying when I think about all the things I need and all the things I don't have.  I still have faith and I still trust God, but I feel like the faith and the trust is beginning to fade.  It's like I've held on to the ledge for a really long time and my fingers are beginning to slip, my arms are no longer able to hold on to the promise that God will provide.  I know that I need to keep trusting and keep the faith, but it's getting harder.  I also wonder, now, just how many people out there wait years for things and keep the faith.  Where does it come from?   *sigh* I'm waiting for God to open the flood gates and provide all of the things I need.  I want my dad to see that God really does give us things that we need, that He provides in times of need and that miracles do really happen.  I think my dad's going crazy over this whole thing...worse then me.  I really would like to show my dad and help him revive his faith in God.  I wonder if I'm doing something wrong ... or not doing something that I should be doing.  When I think about it nothing comes to mind, but ... maybe I'm not thinking hard enough.  Or maybe these are the lies of the devil. Please don't you have any answers?

						   Well...I got to work today!  My dad has a friend that needed some doors painted and some yard work done.  I worked 5 hours today and will probably work about that many on Thursday.  I'm hoping it will help me out a little. Come to find out my clothes are falling apart and I'm desprate for some more, but I don't have any money.  I know that sounds like the same old same old, but it's true!  I'm trying hard to be good about not spending my money, but ... I don't know how much longer I"m going to be able to last without money.  I know I'll be poor, but I'd at least like something.  Okay so right now I'd like a lot of something, because I need it to move to Southern Cali. Pray.

						   Well, I created another online journel here at blogspot, because of Barbara!  I also like that they changed the format.  I like that you can now add comments. This is actually my second online journal, but I don't mind.  This actually has a different tone then the other one. I hope that I can actually get people reading this thing!  That's actually rather difficult to do.  I wonder why!  It's rather like an email without all the hassal of trying to get all the right addresses and stuff like that! I hope I can keep up with this. I haven't heard from the church in Riverside yet and a lot of people keep asking me about it.  All I can say is keep praying.  I know that worrying does me no good and gets me no where, but I feel like I want to start worrying more.  It's hard to keep the faith and hope alive when I see no real good solution. Waiting for miracles.
