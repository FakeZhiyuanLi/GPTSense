      so i spent most of my day battling the urge to do nothing... I LOST ! i woke up this morning and went to feed the dog and there were thousands of flying ants all over the kitchen window..looks like they were coming out of the air conditioning vent..ack... killed them they came back killed them they came back killed them I WIN! i did some laundry, drank some great coffee, walked the dog, smoked a cig or two..yeah yeah they're bad for me..so is reality tv and i don't bitch at you! i found a picture i took of part of a triptych i painted..so i posted it...probably belongs in the   urlLink museum of bad art  but what the hell eh? surfed around a bit and found out there's a plethora of well written blogs...warms my cockels to know that there really are some fairly literate people in this world...why do i always run into the ones with that look on their face ..you know the one..vacuous i guess is a good word that's about all the nothing i feel like writing now.. check back later i may be able to bore you further!

      well...i got a lot done so far today...sent off for grade transcripts to a college i went to for one semester,sent off an admission application,put some dough in the bank for my boyfreind,bought some Oxyclean to see if i can't rescue these nasty couches...my boyfreind's dog has been sleeping on them for eight years so they look like crap..oh well..any way..the biggest thing is no one seems to know where my high school transcripts are...or even if i got a GED or a high school diploma..if i have to take the GED i'm gonna scream..20 years is a long time away from school i dont remember anything!!!!!!!can you imagine...i mean how much American History do you really remember? how often as a stay at home mom do you nactually use algebra..my linguistic skills are pretty good..you could even say i'm a "cunning linguist"..sorry bad joke..i think today to do something a lil different between cleaning this disaster area and figuring out my transcript dilemma im going to relearn html and redo this page ..it is kind of boring using the pre-made templates!..im trying not to watch the news today i am having a hard time with the Abu Grhaib story.......the guys on the lower rung are gonna really get stung on this one...bye for now..be well

      well...here goes...my first time blogging..no one will even read this i'm sure..if they do they may notice i don't capitalize...or use periods...mostly because i don't feel it's necessary..i write how i speak...today was a busy day trying to figure out how much i could work without losing medicaid...you see i'm a bit on the nutty side..coocoo for cocoa puffs...and no job i've ever had will pay for the therapy or the meds nor will insurance cover it..so i have to exist on a measly 500 a month ..at least until i finish school..what am i going to be you ask?...why a social worker.. i'm going to fix broken people...who better than someone who is herself broken in a way that is almost unfixable...but it really was a beautiful day if i step out of my whiny self ..the sun was out and the sky was a cerulian blue and thank whoever...no cicadas yet!..well that's it for now..no..wait one more thing...i haven't been to school in twenty years...and i have to provide records from schools i don't even remember the names of..this is gonna be fun!!!!!!!...now i'm done...stay tuned for more mundane mediocrity!

      well...the library was a success..we got a BOX full of books..everything from spiderman comics..to a science experiment book...from lions in africa to a how to motocross..and some choose your own adventure chapter books...all i got was "the trial" by franz kafka..and "snows of kilamanjaro" by hemmingway..i never read either of these in school so i figured i'd do it now  expand my mind a bit...i do remember hemmingway was pretty dry and kafka was full of symbolism...but i need something kewl to talk about at dinner..we also caught an hour ride on the paddle boats...gawd my legs were wrecked after that...my youngest (Josh) got pissed off at me for telling him not to juggle in the house and told me it was like being in Abu Ghraib...jeez..out of a nine years olds mouth eh? we lost the dog about 2 hours ago...seems Drew my oldest tried to take him out and lost control..of course i didnt know about it till porter was gone for about an hour...and our dog is part hound so when he takes off he's gone for a LONG time so ..2 hours of driving around the block screaming "porter" out the window in a spanish neighborhood not being able to ask..."have you seen a big brown/black dog.." without trying to say it in spanish...ugh..eventually i hear him bark..yes i know my dogs bark...don't you?......i step out on the back porch and start yelling..."porter"...and 2 houses down one of the only other english tenants in the neighborhood says..are you calling a dog..he's a college student i guess..why else  would he need that clarified.....unless he knows a kid named porter?..any way i said uh...yeah... he yells back,,,he's over hre under my tree he's been here for 2 hours ..seems porter went around the tree with his leash on and got stuck..typical right?..so the kid says..i saw him earlier...but i was afraid he'd bite so i left him alone....wonder what would have happened if we never had made contact and the dog just stayed there? anywho...that's my afternoon so far..and that doesn't even get me halfway...man if we don't get a couch or a chair or a freakin big pillow soon i think im gonna throw my back out....800 square feet and four people  just doesnt work!!!!!!

      well...yesterday was mostly an inside day since it was a red zone for air quality and Josh has allergies ...we played online at  urlLink Neopets  and did some practice with our devil sticks...we had pot pies for lunch and talked about all kinds of things..they have been really concerned about the news from Iraq..especially Abu Ghraib..so i had to attempt an explanation, man it's so difficult to explain the workings of war and politics and the human condition to kids but i did my best...trying to say how scary it must be for everyone over there..including the Iraqi's..Josh simply said.."well..i wish people could just play together they wouldn't want to have a war"  ON THE HOME FRONT...we have no couch or anything in  the living room since we gave the old one away...but our new stuff ended up not being ready..so we are in beach chairs (ugh...i realize i'm older everytime i try to get up from that far on te floor!!!!!)we went and picked up the lawnmower..then we priced pools..but we can't put one in till Eric sprays the fence so i guess this weekend we may get one..today i think it's a library day..they have to read over summer..since i think its good to keep the brains working..and maybe we will swing by a.c. moore or michael's and find a crafty something we can do together..if you have any ideas...feel free!!!
