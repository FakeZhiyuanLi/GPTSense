Today learnt something... as long as you are doing the right thing stand firm... even if from the start you have the wrong attitude... change and set your mind on the attitude you should have... and lift the issue or problem up to God... ^^...    Found The Light     Thinking of the past events, Bring me guilt and teary eyes, Feel so sinful like never before. But once i confessed and share, Exposed the devil to the light, And he never been to fight back right.  Walking out of darkness, To the Glory of your grace. Found the light of life, Which is the way to eternal.  Free myself from sin, Fresh to serve him all the way. Get away from temptations, Let the devil have nothing to say

      Hey bloggie, seems like i have been backsliding for dunno how long le... really feel that i have not been doing my job of being a leader... being a leader is really not easy... i have been just taking everything for granted... never really planned for the future... everything was just last minute and was like there is always a tomolo... we will see what we can do tomolo... always this kind of thinking... never realise that i have been going towards the wrong direction all the time... guess its time to turn back... bloggie... :)...   Today... went to the festival of Praise... with the Hillsongs... the praise and worship was good... and i realise lots of things... and this verse always come into my mine... Matthew 6:33 " first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you..."... what is the all these things... all these things is the things that we worried about the things we desired to have... To me i guess may be Hammy hampy and Lust... these are the great stronghold of mine... but i guess... after today... i lift them up to God... God will handle them... do not have to worry about all the things of the world... i shall serve full time ... serve my brothers full time... give them all my time... in bringing them nearer to God each day...  Dunno what happening to me today... seems like i having PMS like that... having very bad mood... never had these feeling before... but i just know that its time... The Change of dynamic/system of the cell... something needs to be done... Philadelphia will make a come back and give the Devil a big kick in his fat ass... God... please help me...

      Dear Bloggie...  have been two days since i come into here to post something ... just wanna say how i feel about these few days ba... hrm...&nbsp;i also not really sure whats going on... things seems to get difficult... and i seems to be drawing so far away from Him... far far away... am i able to stand? i think i shouldn't ask that coz i dun have a choice... i have to stand so firm for His sake... building up his people... but i am just unable to set my own life before him... taking out of private time to serve him... i guess i am not going to blame&nbsp; the devil but its all my fault... i am the one that been doing all the dumb things... many times i thought i could just simply walk back to him... but i am already sick and tired of being crushed down to zero again and again... whats my heart doing? whats happening to my life? i really dunno...   Nowadays ... studies and projects are all coming out... i just seems so slack ... not doing everything... am i just lazy in nature? i duno... just seems to far... i am suppose to be well organise and well prepared in all the things i do with Him in my life... but i just dun seems to be following Him well... i am not walking well in the path... i am not well ... i am not running well in the race... i really wonder ... if i am not running well...&nbsp; i will be causing my whole team to fall... but how can i do that? i really dun understand what am i think... haiz... thinking lots of things.... just seems to be tired everyday... i guess i am just doing too much... many times i guess its better to stand alone... being alone quietly sometimes really is such a peace... there wun be headache... but i hate the loneliness... i dunno ... can someone bring me back? i think i have been dazing around everyday... seems to be in dream land everyday...&nbsp; hrm... got a feeling that i am getting sick real soon... having flu... having headache... gonna have a fever soon... hrm...   Am i always trying to get things done fast... theres lots of things that cannot be rushed... i think i am getting more and more insensitive... i think i have changed alot... i really start to get sick of Poly life... its tough ... really tough mental... not about Intelligence... but about Socialogy... hrm... maybe no one understand me... beside Father up there in heaven... or am i just thinking too complicated... seems to have lots of things that i have to let go... let go ... let go....   Nowadays... i just dun seems to feel my heart.. i dunno my own heart beat... i dunnno where have it flown to... haiz...

      Hey Bloggie,    hrm... tired tired tired... my mind is so mess up...&nbsp; just seems so tired from the morning till the night... nv been refreshed... just seems to be so far.... so far away.... all's my fault... i guess many times is we ourselves who bring ourselves to the way towards sin... its we ourselves who choose to do it...&nbsp; its we ourselves who are not satisfied of the Love of God... its we ourselves who dun seek God enough... its we ourselves who dun cherish the time we have for God... its we ourselves who nv realise the mistake we have done... its we ourselves who fell and always ask for forgiveness again and again but unable to climb out of it... its we ourselves who say things to God but dun mean from the Heart... its we&nbsp; ourselves who cause ourselves to come to the steps of Hell... its we ourselves who walked away from God when God wants to come near us... its we ourselves!!... its me ... its myself... i am so so so mess up!!!!!!!!!...  Sometimes really think that i deserved the punishment of Hell... though i dun wan to ... but i have sinned so much... what else can i ask for... though i know that God is always Forgiving... whats the use of letting him always forgive me... i guess i deserve everything ... far away... i have walked so far away from him... far far away... far away... very far... i have side tracked my life so much... am i able to be back again... many times i guess i really feel like back slide and walk away from what i have been doing... so that&nbsp;i wun bring people under me away... so that i wun mislead them... so that i wun cause them to stumble... and also its really so tough to be a strong christian...&nbsp; its so tough... very tough...  have i been thinking too much??far too much ?... hrm... i dunno...         "  Am i going back?..."

      Dear Bloggie...  Erm... today is another tiring day in school... and really blame myself for being real lazy sometimes... still have one whole stack of tutorial not done yet... even when i am typing this entry now... i still have two tutorial to rush... Organisational Behaviour and Business Statistics... hrm... hope i will push myself to cope better... hrm... Thank God for pulling me through... anyway... after today's school... i went over for Joey's place to do discipleship with him.... though he have been some one who give me quite some problem... but i seem him grow... its such a wonderful sight to see someone grow... grow mature... grow strong in the Lord... All Honor goes to the Lord...&nbsp; God is good!!... happy to see the brothers grow so well...  &nbsp;  Seems To Be Thinking over the issues of the problems nowadays ... dunno whats happening in me... i think most importantly is to pray i guess... set my life real strict before God... hrm....&nbsp; &nbsp;  Hey ShiJun, thanks for the comment you made... but ... i can tell you ... i have faith that God is real.... though i can't see him... but i can feel him... though i can't touch him .... i can hear him.... he speaks to me everyday and guide me along... but many times i think i just ignore him... i just have to tune myself even more sensitive to him... There is a heaven becoz there is a God... and i just believe so... keke... i duno how to explain... but i just have to say... he is just so great... nv think of ending your life... for what? think of how are you gonna lead your this life well... finish it to the end... dun give up half way.... thought of joining me in church to feel the Love ? come m'on... join me!

      Dear Bloggie, I dunno who is the one who have been reading my blog or have been gossiping about what i have been writing in here... but i definately thank those brothers and sisters who encouraged me... really thanks for all of that...  Nowadays... these days i guess God put me through so much things to teach me ... how to be clean ... how to be pure... how to lead by example... many many more... lots of thoughts have been going through my mind... Hope many of them are actually added God... coz i believe... from those thoughts ... God lead me out of where i not suppose to be...   One of them is regarding BGR... remembered once that Paul ask me.. whats your purpose of having a GF? are you able to support them? are you going to marry her now? ... recently, a week ago... this few questions come back to me again... and i remembered what Paul's answer is.... if you wan to have a Gf is becoz you wan to bring the person into your life ... to be your life partner... and of coz i wun be able to support them if i am not working ... especially when i am still schooling... and also ... since i am not prepared for a marriage ... why look for one?... i really push myself to set my mine... off BGR... and put what Paul says into my mind... wait till i am really able to support a family then i start thinking about it...   I guess people who are close to me have realise the things that have happened recently... i dunno... Devil coming against me? i dunno... just lots of things have been going on lately... and i really dunno what to do...   I am so worn out i guess... really tired everyday... i really want the brothers to grow well into a Man of God... i just wanna do all i can... now i was like trying my best to take out time for all of them... for discipleships... if any of my sheeps actually read this... i would like to say that... if you would like to lighten my job... be more discipline and listen to me... not saying that i say everything is correct... but many times i really say or ask you to do for your sake... i wan all of you to grow strong but one thing is that you need to see the need of it in your own heart...   many times i am just concern and dunno what to do... if you people out there gonna hate me.. or can't take it... i really hope you will understand what i am doing one day... or even not now but one day.... i just wish that that people will start to stand for what is right ... if i am doing wrong ... come and tell me... but i just wish that people will start going again the wrong and distorted truth...    School... Ministry... Friends... Work... Fellowship... Church... Just pray that i cope with the passion and strength of God...

       Using a magnifying glass to focus the sunlight on a leaf, it will burn... But Focus the sunlight on the hand it hurts...  Selling ice-cream during summer may help relieving heat, But selling ice-cream at winter at the time  Playing at home is to relieve stress, But playing on the road is dangerous.

      Dear Bloggie, haiz... as the days goes by ... thinking of my life... i think i am really mess up manz... dunno whats going on... my life dun seems to be what it suppose to be... having headache every now and then... seems to have done something i shouldn't have done... i dunno whats going on... seems to have something else controlling me instead of myself... i just seems to be in a daze everyday and not concentrating on anything... and just let everything pass by as a dream or a movie? ... i dunno... things just seems to be wierd...   light shining on the land, a big piece of grassland, peaceful and quiet, beautiful and fresh, dark clouds form and block the light, flowers hidden from the shine, slowly all fall and die. the scenary is never like before, animals die, leaves and flowers fall, chaotic and ugly, stink.    Light shines through the thinted glass. Stains of soil on my shirt. vigorous music floods the room. Slopes and bumps on the road. Unclear hearing. A failed mine detector. scratched compact disc. Walking towards a dead end. Short sightedness. A battery without energy.

      Dear Bloggie, Woahz!!!.. It have been so long since the last time i send in my entry here... so long so long... have been quite lazy to type so much or even keep up with myself to type everyday... maybe dun have the time or even dun make the effort to do it... then since i am doing it today... then i will write a long long one.. since shijun is reading... lolZ.... haha...  Woahz... i just have so much so much so much things to say... so much... hrm.... have been thinking about my family these few days... so much things that i really longed for... thinking about lots of things in my life... so late le... now... one person sitting in the room... typing this blog... just kinda lonely... everyone is outside... mother just reach home... kinda worried bout her... so late then reach home... thinking about my mum just simply lead me to think about my earthly father... who is now in China... i dun even know which part of China he is in... but no matter what i just pray the Father in heaven will protect him and keep him safe... it have been just such a long time since i see him... the last time i see him was just a few days after i started school in Ngee Ann Poly... now... just hope to see him soon... really missed him so much... think about it... i am just so fortunate to have such great parents on the surface of this earth.... thank God...  Last few days i have been spending quite alot of time out with my friends... talking bout last friday... the feeling can never leave me...  i just feel so warm... when i enter the gates of BBSS ... that place really give me all kinds of memories... really so warm to be in there... so touched when the juniors still come over and talk to me... they are having their National Day celebrations... i just feel so good in that land... everything is still just so familiar... the warm from the people ... is much much better than the present one... so happy to see ex school mates going back too... seeing their faces just remind me of the days we had together... so much fun, happiness, sadness and bitterness... just went through everything together... some of them have changed... just have to admit that we are all just growing every single day... changing every second... things can never be as sweet and warm as the past... but the memories will always be there... really cherish the friendships...  On sunday night, after the leaders' training... went to meet yong liang, minting and lysia... then after that yi shi... the same old familiar faces... the group that always together... though diff class in the past but just so nice to be together... we met up to watch the fireworks thats going round around the esplanade... so cool... but i din get to watch coz i was late....  but its ok... after that we have lots of talks together... chit chat... lots of fun... though not much activities... but those things are real nice... but i am guilty for making my mum worried... Sorry mum...  Yesterday, A trauma?... i dunno... maybe i will nv know... but its ok... went out early in the morning for LMS project at wisma Mac... so stupid sia... but its nice lahz.. we almost finished the whole thing... spend all the brain cells thinking of those things... can't stand it... after that me and Deb went to meet Diana and Andrew... watched Village... many people may think its shit.. or anything else... but i just somehow think it have real deep meaning... and i see the hearts of those elders in the village... they just wish to have peace in the land... and have a crime free land... have a simple life... they are thinking of the whole village of people... they just have such parent heart... so nice... Later... we went marina bay for steamboat... enjoyed eatting with them... watching the fireworks from afar which is lighted at the national stadium for the national day parade... its so nice... very beautiful sky.... the rest... i guess to be keep unknown... That night... i bring my heart back to the Lord... i will bring myself back step by step... to another stage of breakthrough...

Last few days ... or even hours ago... i am going deeply again God... now think of it... its Shit ... its just crap... why am i doing it? and with my mind so clear... just seems to be going again God purposely... ARGH!!!... haiz... but hope there's still time for me to step out of that firy hell...  Today... i shall have my declaration of War Against the  devil   He is just that tiny compared to   GOD....   i can't even see the devil... today i share declare a war again him... and fight all my way to bring people into the army of God...     If in the past, i have sin against any brothers or sisters ... i seek forgiveness ... and may God have his will done... i would wan to start refresh from this moment onwards...
