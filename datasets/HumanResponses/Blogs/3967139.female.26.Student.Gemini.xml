      I have spent most of my life in Dayton.  When asked where I lived I always added "Oregon, not Ohio."  Now I am finally in Dayton, Ohio.  It is so much bigger than my Dayton.   Things are getting better with Nat.  Now that we are getting into more busy roads she doesn't want to drive anymore.  We were in four different states yesterday, that would take significantly longer back at home.  Things are just a lot closer back here.  We also passed into Eastern Standard Time yesterday.  It's been fairly easy to adjust to the time since we have spent a few days in each time zone.

      I’m about a third of the way done with this trip. I’m only getting a little annoyed with Natalie. She can be so frustrating. I guess all little sisters can get that way. There are so many things I miss about Oregon; my friends, trees, real mountains, rain, people who know how to drive, no sales tax, someone to pump my gas, Wog &amp; Fi. I’m not even to my final destination and I already can’t wait to see the girls in October. I’m so lucky to have such wonderful supportive friends and family. I know that I couldn’t do this without them all.

      I can't believe that my great journey starts tomorrow.  I've spent most of the day packing my car, with a brief interuption to have lunch with Andy, Deren, and Becky.  I really enjoy seeing Andy.  We can go for long periods of time hardly communicating and then when we get together it's as if we just saw each other yesterday.  Unfortunately I was not able to see Jarusha and Kurt.  I hope she understands that I rarely see Andy and I will see her again in October.  I just wish that I had called sooner to clarify what was happening.  My car, which seemed so roomy just a few days ago suddenly seems so very cramped.  I'm not sure I will be able to take everything that I would like.  I already have one box packed for Mom to send after I get to school.  I hope to keep up with this as much as possible during the big trip but only time will tell.

      When I am looking forward to something I usually blow it up in my mind to something so fabulous that I am bound to be disappointed. This is especially true of the haircut I had yesterday. I just wanted the same cut I had but a little shorter, not too difficult. Or so I thought. All of the sudden the top layer of my hair is 3 inches shorter that it had started and the back didn't change, leaving a long layer that flips up. It is like a mullet gone terribly wrong. And she thinned it which I specifically asked her not to do. Fortunately my sisters will help trim the unsightly back so I wont have to wrap my head in a scarf to go outside.

      I am now unemployed.  I have one week left in the state I have spent my entire life in.  I am leaving behind my family and the best friend a person could ever imagine.  A new life awaits me in the east.  A student again.  This time I am more prepared, mature, ready; I think.  As I journey across this country accompanied by my youngest sister, I hope to see new things and reflect on the old.  It is more than a journey of geography but also of the mind and soul.  Two girls and a car travleing and learning.  There is one person who I wish were sharing this adventuring with me.  One who understands the need for the perfect "driving music" and really good donuts.  But she has new responsibilities and her own adventure to live.  It is a good one, she is a wonderful mother and talented writer.  I just hope I make it into the acknowledgements someday.
