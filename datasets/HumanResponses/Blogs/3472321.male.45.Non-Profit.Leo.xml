      I just received a call from one of the heart transplant physicians currently on suspension at the Albany Medical Center.  As previously posted, the State Health Department fined the hospital for having failed to follow established procedures for selecting candidates for heart transplants.  The guy I spoke to is one of the two key individuals involved in the selection process - but he was never interviewed by the DOH!  Figure that.

Typical of her spirit, she put up a remarkable fight, which makes it that much more difficult to cope with her loss.&nbsp; The caregivers at Angell mounted a heroic effort to save her during her stay this past week and we are deeply grateful to them for all that they did, both for her and for us.&nbsp; We thank our friends and family who have expressed their best wishes hopes for Alex and offered support through this difficult time.&nbsp; We owe a special debt of gratitude to Mignon Mullen here on the Island who took charge of caring for Alex's "sister" Chloe during our long eight days in Boston.&nbsp; Jan and I will now set about adjusting to life without Alex, although it is difficult at this moment to envision how our hearts could be mended.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that a little 6 pound dog could have such a profound effect on our lives.&nbsp; We can only hope that wherever Alex's essence now resides, she will be unencumbered by disease or malady.&nbsp; Her spirit and her heart will live on with us in our memories.       &nbsp;   Tom & Jan       &nbsp; Our thoughts are with you.

      OVER THE WEEKEND I was treated to a summer version of the Williams Family Reunion.  The usual one that I have been attending takes place just after Thanksgiving.  However, neither Jane nor I have been to Indiana in the summer for quite some time.  So, we thought we'd head out for a long weekend and visit the clan.  I've posted some pictures that I took of the trip.  Unfortunately, I took one of three of the sisters together that, somehow, got lost.  Maybe Marilyn can send me her copy and I can blog it.  Dad Williams took us around  urlLink Fair Oaks Farm , a huge dairy concern just outside Rensselaer, Indiana.  If ever anyone gets a chance to visit, they should.  At the end of the tour we were treated to ice cream and cheese made on the premises.  Out of this world!  We had a great lunch with Jane's sister Shirley and Marilyn on Saturday.  On Sunday the Harshas treated us to a delightful breakfast at their camp ground (take note, Christopher!), and then we were able to visit with Jane's two other sisters, Betty and Nancy (and her husband, Bob) after viewing Shirley's flower garden.  Ruth was under the weather, but we hope to see her in the fall.  On the way back to Albany we stopped at Fairpoint Harbor on Lake Erie, just east of Cleveland.  Unfortunately, it wasn't open the day we were there, but we were able to see the structure up close and look out over the lake.  My apologies to the Shelbys for not being able to drop down to Lafayette to visit.  Time just wouldn't allow, as I imagined it wouldn't.  Jane and I really need to book more time for these visits to the Midwest.  Our next family trip will be to Florida to visit my father and stepmother, maybe in the fall.
