      Went to my Uncc for my orientation Monday and came back yesterday. I was a little apprehensive at first because I went alone and didn't know anyone there... but as soon as I got there I liked it. Those people are cool as shit. Going to school there is gonna rock.  We all had to sit in this drug/alcohol lecture thing and listen to the assistant dean, and we were in there about ten minutes when he asked us if any of us had ever drank or smoked up... so out of the whole fucking incoming freshman class, like ten people raised their hands (myself included). After he asked, I was like 'woohoo!!' and it was kinda funny because right after i did, like five other people did too, and I think we pissed the dean off.  I met this guy from Toronto up there and we ended up having this huge convo about the Maple leafs, the Kids in the Hall (which is of course, the best tv show EVER)and toronto. He was pretty cool, but I he kinda hit on me and that wasn't.   Can't wait till Friday... I get to see the new Spiderman movie. That movie is gonna kick ASS.   "Well, If you are caught with a large amount of marijuana, the school will see to it you are prosecuted, but if you're caught with just a joint or small amount we will most likely let you get away with it."-- Uncc assistant dean   "kick it like you would a dropping baby"

      Today on AIM I noticed that all my guy friends with girlfriends put "I love you ___!!" all up in their profile.... and I don't think that these guys (namely two I can think of) have even been going out with these girls a few weeks, much less reached the 'i love you' point in their relationships. People throw that phrase around too much nowadays. How is it supposed to mean anything when you just say it to any chick you have been on a few casual dates with?   People are retarded.

      Had an interesting night yesterday.  I also had this weird dream that I cheated on my boyfriend with Quentin Tarantino. I don't know WHERE that came from.

      Made up with my boyfriend. I think I'm going to bring over some peach cobbler or pie or something as a peace offering.  I still haven't talked to Steph. I really need to though. I can't even believe how retarded our argument was the other day. My mom has gone completely insane. Everytime someone comes to visit, she always acts a little crazy trying to make the house really clean, but now that my grandfather is coming, I'm starting to wonder if she has completely lost her mind. Lately she has been screaming at me to clean the weirdest shit, and the other day I was bitched out for taking a shower when she wanted to paint. Ummm, ok, Mom. I can't wait to get out of the house tonight. I haven't seen J in like, five days. I miss him. So I will definitely be happier a little later on when I see him tonight.

      and all the assholes that live in it. I have had the WORST FRIDAY NIGHT EVER. If it gets any worse, I'll be ready to shoot myself. First I get into the stupidest argument ever with my best friend. Then I find out another so-called 'friend' has been talking some mad shit behind my back. His response when I confront him? "Don't take it personally." Oh yeah, I won't take it personally when a person I trust and confide in runs his mouth to the one person who hates me the most. I won't take it personally when he trys to use this same person as an excuse for his behavior. (This person, by the way, he always talks MAD shit about). I won't take it personally when you talk shit about me to the one person I care the most about, my boyfriend. (who, by the way I got into a fight with) Then to top it off, I fought with my mom.... and I have a bruise on my face from where that fucker Andrew hit me with a piece of chalk. Because my life doesn't suck enough already.

      I hate it how when you finally start to trust someone, they lie to you, and then make you feel like shit for something that wasn't even really your fault.

      Last night I started talking with an old friend again. We used to be good friends back when I was in high school, but right before I graduated in December we had a very volatile falling out... Anyways, I IMed her last night and apologized for all the bad shit that had happened, and I told her that I had changed alot since before I left. And then the more we got to talking, the more I realized just how true that is. I guess I didn't realize the extent of it until then.... we started talking about our boyfriends, and we both brought up how I used to be a complete cynic when it came to relationships.... then she brought up the election, and asked who I was going to vote for, and (of course) I said Kerry, and she couldn't believe that based on how republican and pro-Bush I used to be back in the day. There's other stuff too, that we didn't discuss, but I realized later on... I used to be extremely anti-smoking, and now I'm a smoker. I used to not date men who were more than a couple years older than me, and my boyfriend now is eleven years older. I used to be fairly for war under certain situations, and now I'm a pacifist. I used to hate the thought of going to Uncc, and that's where I'm going now. I used to hate democrats... and now I am one. That's kinda screwed up that only a few months after leaving high school, you can change that much. What's even more weird is from the time I was in sixth grade, to the time I graduated, I was the exact same fucking person.  In other news, I was recently informed by Steph she is going to get a tattoo. Please Don't! Tattoos look trashy on women... unless you just get a very small, tasteful one. I was considering getting a small one of a dove holding an olive leaf on my lower back or shoulder, but I don't think I am now. Just because there are way too many trashy women that have tattoos... and I don't want myself getting confused with any of those bitches. There are alot of nice women that have tattoos as well I guess, but like I said, the trashy ones greatly outnumber them. I think when I turn 18 I'm just gonna get my belly pierced. And that's if I still decide to do that in a couple months.  Six days till my two month anniversary. *blush*  I'm gonna go meet up with Steph in a little bit and workout... maybe after, I'll drop by HT and see if Gregory is still working. Or maybe I'll job hunt.

      Today was incredibly boring.  Mostly because I'm too lazy to go anywhere out of Waxhaw.    Woke up at one today... got online, ate some cereal. Then cleaned up a little, did some laundry.... cooked some.... played online some more. Then I went to get gas and chill over at Andrew's for a little. I was thinking of calling up Kristin or Steph; but then I remembered I was too lazy to drive out of town to visit anyone.    At least I have plans for the weekend.    I'm debating whether or not to go get drunk with Steph and Elizabeth.  Because if I did get drunk, I'd have to spend the night at this other girl's house who I don't know.... and that would be weird. At least to me, because I'm weird about stupid shit like that.  If it was at Steph's place I wouldn't care.  I don't really know if I want to get drunk either.  I'll probably end up going anyways.  Saturday I'm going to some show with J.... it should be cool, even though I have never heard the bands that are playing there. I should like them though. I get to spend the night with him after, which will be cool.    Wow, this post is incredibly boring.  I think I'm going to eat some dinner now and go to bed.

      I had a couple weird dreams last night.    The first dream I had, I dreamed that Kat and I got into a huge fight inside an ice cream shop, and we kept trying to punch each other while screaming the other was a whore.    The second dream I had was really, REALLY weird. I dreamed that I was wearing my mother's wedding/engagement ring.... and I was running all around my neighborhood, because this huge pack of dogs was chasing me, each trying to get the ring from me. Also during the dream, B.Scott's dog almost bit my finger off trying to eat it.   How weird is that?

      I'm so in the mood for sushi.  I have been all week. But guess what (?), I'm too poor to go out and buy some. *sniffle*    Ran into Darren today. Hung out with him for awhile, then went over to Andrew's with him and chilled. Then I went home for a little bit.... then went back over to Andrew's, and then went over to Steph's.        Him- "So can we have sex now?"  Me- "Um, let me think about it... no, that's ok. But if I change my mind, I'll call you and let you know. Oh, wait... NO I WON'T."    I love my guy friends.

      All day today, "Unmade Bed" has been stuck in my head. But then again, that might be because I have been playing it most of the day.     Brad said that profile on Libra described me very well.  I think it did too. With maybe a couple exceptions.    I finally got my laptop today. But I can't so much as open the package it came in until my dad gets home.  Kind of ironic how most of time, I can't wait to get him out of the house, and now that he finally is I can't wait for him to get back home.     I have no idea what I am going to do today.    In other news, I found out one of my guy friends will be coming back to waxhaw in about a week, so I will get to hang out with him. Which is really cool, cause I haven't hung out with him in forever.

                 Libra Sun Sign Profile  			 September 23 - October 22    		  		  		   			 			 			  			 			    			  				   				Page 1 of 3    			   			 			  				   Libra is the seventh Sign of the Zodiac, and it is at this point in the Zodiac that we start to see a shift. While the first six Signs of the Zodiac focus on the individual, the last six focus on the individual's contact with others and with the world. Librans are first and foremost focused on others and how they relate to them. We can call this the Sign of partnership with a capital 'P' because these folks do not want to be alone! For a Libran, everything is better if it's done as a pair. Librans are good when paired up, too, since they epitomize balance, harmony and a sense of fair play. While they are true team players at work, their favorite partnership is at home: marriage. Librans feel most complete when they are coupled up with their lover, forever.   It's the Scales which symbolize Libra, and just like that balancing mechanism wants to stay even, Librans want to be on an even keel. Think of the Scales of Justice and how they work at striking the right balance. Likewise, Librans are objective, just and want to do what's best for everyone. It's possible, though, that this penchant for fairness is for a different reason: Librans abhor conflict. The Scales study every possible angle in the hopes of achieving peace and harmony, so much so that others may see them as fickle and indecisive. If that's what it takes to avoid a confrontation, that's fine with the Scales. The Libra-born are keen strategists, organizing groups with poise and getting the job done (in keeping with the Cardinal Quality assigned to this Sign). Further, you can expect the Scales to be companionable, sociable folks.              Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. In ancient Roman mythology, Venus was a smooth seductress who was at her best amid pleasurable excess. Well, Librans are certainly carrying the torch for her today. The Scales are cultured, refined and love beautiful things. Most of all, they love beautiful people, which is why Librans do so well at cocktail parties or at the theater, opera or ballet. Those born under this Sign always have the right thing to say and know how to make others feel comfortable. Suave? You bet. Librans are so adept at charming conversation that they need to be mindful of overstepping their boundaries and appearing vain or gossipy (the Scales do love intrigue). When these folks are on their game, however, they are a pleasure to be with. Librans are artistic, stylish and enjoy creating a beautiful world. The converse of this is that bored Librans can become apathetic and lazy -- but they'll smile anyway.           The Element associated with Libra is Air, and that means reaching higher, specifically to the higher mind. Librans like to put their mind to good use, and enjoy communicating their thoughts to others. They like to use their smarts (and talk) to get to know others better -- yes, knowledge about people is where it's at for Librans. You can expect the Scales to make a fair argument, too, since they live by the principles of diplomacy and compromise. When this approach doesn't work, however, Librans are not above using their persuasive charms to get their way. Manipulative? Nah, Librans really are too nice for that. Plus, any end-runs that these folks use are usually to build themselves up, since the Scales can be easily deterred. Librans are polite and don't like to fight, far preferring to talk things through. Remember, these folks know how to communicate (they're Air) so they're bound to make their point. Librans don't get in a huff when faced with an opposing viewpoint. Rather, they take a deep breath and consider all the options in the spirit of cooperation.              Librans at play may not be as energized as at work, if you call socializing work (and the Scales do). That's why exercise for Librans needs to have a social component to it, such as that found at a gym. Alternatively, Librans love the outdoors, so riding and biking can also prove fun. They also love the colors of the sunset sky, that melding of ivory, pink and light blue. In the game of love, Librans are a bundle of energy, romantic and loyal to the core. The Scales need to be on the lookout for their lower backs, though, which tend to shoulder any burdens they may be carrying.           The great strength of the Libra-born is their quest for fairness, peace and harmony. That the Scales are the great diplomats of the Zodiac further helps their case. A beautiful journey this will be, thanks to the Libran's inimitable sense of style.

      Random thoughts for the day....    How can a movie with seemingly no plot and no real humor have so many fans and a cult-like following? (i.e. Napolean Dynamite)    (Granted, I haven't seen the movie, but seeing the previews and hearing my dumbass friends go on and on about it have made me ask the question. Although I bet if I did see it, it would be a "Memento" repeat, where I'm the only one I know who hates the movie, and is surrounded by idiots who love it. That whole situation kinda reminded me of that Seinfeld episode where Elaine goes to see "The English Patient", and she is like, the only person in New York City that doesn't like it.)     Another random question....    Is Jake REALLY short for Jason?    (My whole life I have only know people whose full name was Jacob to have the nickname Jake. How can Jake be a nickname for Jason? But then again, the world of nicknames is always confusing.... other questions I've thought of were, 'how could Dick be short for Richard?' and ' How could I have ever gotten the nickname Cookie?' )        Today was boring.    Got up past noon, wandered aimlessly around my house for about an hour, got dressed, took care of my neighbor's dogs..... got home, made some mac and cheese, hung out with Kat, got cigarettes, hung out with Kat some more...... went home, cleaned.... ate, watched tv, went up to arbo to hang out with Kat and Kristin and some people I don't really know.... went home, took a shower, and now I'm online.

Everything that happens has a purpose.

      It's so annoying. I think I might just wait until classes start and then try to get a job on campus... that's where I'm going to be spending most of my time anyway. Speaking of classes, I think they are starting in three weeks. I'm kinda torn between feeling very excited and feeling pissed.  True, its going to be awesome starting college, and taking a bunch of classes I'm actually interested in, and meeting lots of new people.... but I don't even know if I will have enough time for all my friends. I'm going to be busy ALL THE TIME.  School would be bad enough, but with all my after school stuff, and a job, and a boyfriend... how the hell am I supposed to fit in all my high school and charlotte buddies? :-(  I guess I'll find a way somehow, but I definitely think I'm going to cut down on all the parties and pointless hanging out. Come to think of it, I think I've already done that. I think the last party I went to was a couple months ago. Anyways... I so went off on a tangent there. Everytime I think about something and start writing about it, I end up on a COMPLETELY different subject wondering what the hell i was originally talking about.     I think I need a nap.

      Today I hung out with Brad and he told me that I looked like Jessica Alba, because I just was so cute. Awwwww.... *blush*  Smoked again today. I don't know why exactly I started smoking again, but its basically the only thing that chills me out. Besides weed, and I gave that up. Aargh. I think after I'm done with this pack I'm gonna stop smoking again. I hate smelling like a walking ashtray. Oh, well. At least I'm finally over feeling completely ill.  &nbsp;

      I think I'm having the worst day ever... I went to the doctor, found out I have not one, but two different kinds of infections, bitched out my boyfriend, then went home, got bitched out by my fam.... the drugs I got put on to kill my infection(s) are making me feel even more sick; and now I'm at Kristin's house, feeling like I'm going to pass out. Which is wonderful, because I have to drive home in a couple hours. (Grrr)

      Had a really messed up dream last night...    I was sitting out on Kat's back porch chain smoking  Reds (ahh, reminds me of the good ole days), when, lo and behold, who should walk up and join me but ___.  Now you might think at this point in my dream, that this is the point when a serious altercation would break out, and me and ___ would end up getting into it.  But surprisingly that is not the answer. So she walks up to me smoking Camels, and sits down beside me... next thing I know we are talking to each other like we're friends or something.     Me- So are those menthols?  her- No way. Menthols are for pansys.  me- Damn Straight.    So after we are done having our lovely little convo, I give her a hug, and she goes on her merry way.   I have absolutely no fucking idea why I would dream something retarded like this. Especially since in reality, we both absolutely disdain one another.

      My life sucks. &nbsp; I lost my job. My boss said he didn't think I could "handle it". But I had been handling it just fine... I got like, a fucking forty percent tip tonight... but apparently I wasn't doing a very good job. And Dave and Mary are moving the dogs, so no more paychecks from them. So now I am completely broke; with absolutely no job prospects. I quit smoking two days ago, and tonight I just felt so incredibly shitty and depressed; and I couldn't talk to the few people I really wanted to... so I smoked a cigarette, and now I feel even more shitty. I really don't think the hormones from birth control are helping any of this. &nbsp; Maybe I'll feel better tomorrow; I doubt I could feel much worse. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      What Zodiac Sign Should You Be?            A Libra! It's sooo you!  The planets are very complex. Maybe your astrologer will disagree, and maybe a few tendencies will vary, but, overall, you're a LIBRA. You are one polished and elegant individual! And as a Libra, you require romance in your life. You prize beauty in others, and the stars predict that you are quite a piece of eye-candy yourself. But beware: If an emphasis on physical appearance is taken too far, you'll be viewed as judgmental and somewhat superficial. A passion for balance and order makes your symbol a set of scales. You crave harmony and are extremely diplomatic. As an air sign, you are a great communicator and are, therefore, quite relationship-savvy. Although you have an easygoing and optimistic personality, you can be narcissistic at times. Libras are all about sophistication and are revered for their unmatched charm  *************************************************************************************************   I thought it was cool how the test said I should be the sign I actually am. Anyone who would like to take this test should go to emode.com. I think for the time being I'm addicted to this website.

      I think I'm going to finally stop smoking.  I kinda don't want to, but I'm getting on birth control and getting a stroke before I hit 20 doesn't exactly seem like a fun option to me.

      Today I was on my way to Kristin's, driving on Old Monroe Rd with Steph, when we saw a car accident happen like, ten yards away from my car. It was pretty fucked up... we ended up stopping to see if everyone was ok, and the chick that had gotten hit was completely freaking out about her car. I think since seeing that take place I have been feeling incredibly lucky that my car wasn't just a few spaces ahead; because that could just as easily have been me that got hit. And my piece of shit car isn't nearly as safe or new as that girl's car was, and her car was completely totalled regardless. I remember last year when I was at the beach and I got hit in a parking lot how my door crumpled like fucking aluminum foil when a truck hit me going about 3 mph. I think from now on I'm definitely going to be driving a little more safer.

      ...from all the driving I have done today. Well, not just driving, but sitting in a car with someone driving through four different states. I woke up at about six-thirty this morning, and I didn't get home until almost ten tonight. It's only ten-fourty now and I feel incredibly exhausted. We drove to West Virgina, then waited fucking three hours for Brad's grandfather to show up. Meanwhile Brad and I were caught in hell, this small West Virgina town where all the townspeople were the epitome of the stereotypical West Virginian. It sucked. But then we drove back south on 77, and decided to stop in Rock Hill to visit J, and that was cool. I kinda wanted Brad and J to meet each other for some reason. I think I have had enough of road trips for the week. I kinda want to watch KITH, but I have a feeling I'm just gonna fall asleep as soon as I turn it on.  Right now I'm laying in bed watching Six Feet Under. Mena Suvari is guest starring as a lesbian. She's really hot. If I was a lesbian, I would bang her.  Ok, time to pass out.

      Got into Monroe in under three hours. I'm so the shit. I drove to the beach the other day in just over three hours, but I got pulled... I was going 70 in a 55. When I saw it was a state trooper I decided not to even bother trying to get out of a ticket, those guys don't let anyone off. I was pretty chill about it though, I didn't freak out like the last time I got pulled. But then again last time the only reason I didn't get a ticket was because I freaked out. Oh, well. Went over to J's on Saturday, kicked his ass in chess, then got my ass kicked in chess... he bought me the Kids in the Hall DVD set of the first season... I think I screamed when he gave it to me, I was so happy. lol I love the Kids in the Hall. I finally learned how to work my DVD player tonight, which is awesome since I have those KITH DVDs.  I think that had to be the best gift I have gotten in a really, really long time. If not the best gift ever. My boyfriend kicks ass.  Talked to Brad tonight. Somehow he managed to convince me to go on some road trip with him tomorrow to fucking West Virgina. I still don't know how that happened. I have to get up early to go with him, and that's gonna suck. But we'll probably have fun. Plus he's gonna buy me lunch and some cigarettes for going with him... lol

      Today my guinea pig died. It was really strange; he was running around and being cute this morning, but this afternoon he acting extremely ill.. I took him to the vet tonight, and less than an hour after I brought him home he died. I miss him already. He had so much personality. Everytime someone would come upstairs he'd start squealing at them, he was so sweet and cute.... I don't even really know what killed him, the vet said she thought it might be food poisoning, but wasnt sure. I feel pretty depressed tonight. Max was like a little person to me.

      Went out today to run some errands. Decided to stop by Parkwood to harrass them about giving me back the money they owe me for my returned yearbook and parking space refund. I ended up getting them to mail me a check for the parking space, but those assholes are still giving me the run around for my yearbook. I felt like going off on them and telling them not to fuck with me, as I am obviously one crazy bitch when I get on the rag, but then I figured that probably wouldn't motivate them to return my money.

      Yesterday was horrible. I woke up, had cramps so bad I started crying, bitched out Steph for no real reason, almost got into a fucking wreck going 75 on 485, had a panic attack, freaked out at Jason for no real reason, almost made us break up because I'm an idiot... went home, fell asleep, woke up, and had another panic attack. I figured then was the time to call in my anxiety medication. I'm a fucking lunatic without it... I worry about the stupidest stuff, have completely irrational thoughts, am too irritable and argumentative, and occasionally I will even have panic attacks.... I can't believe how bad my anxiety has gotten this month. I don't know what has been triggering it, but lately its really, really been hard to take, and I keep feeling like I'm pushing away people I care about, and sabotaging my own relationships. I thought for awhile I would be ok without taking pills for it (I hate taking pills most of time) but now I really think its starting to get out of control. So tonight I'm going to start taking zoloft again for it. I was on it when I worked at McAlister's, and it worked pretty well... I was a dumbass to stop taking it. I had this really long talk with my mom this morning, she really made me feel like she was there for me. She gave me some advice about stuff, and gave me permission to spend the night at J's house (only if she and my dad aren't home though... she said that normally it wasn't "proper" but especially after I almost got into a wreck yesterday, she was just really nervous about me driving at night when she and my dad weren't at home to help me out if I needed them). So I guess that's cool, cause that means I can spend the night at J's this week. (unless he decides he doesn't want me over). I figured out what was wrong with my comp. Turns out it was really, really simple. And after I figured out what it was I felt like a moron for not noticing to begin with. I think today I'm just going to chill out with Steph and maybe some other people.... and then tomorrow hang out with J... I really think that today and tomorrow will be a hell of alot better than yesterday. Yesterday SUCKED.

      Went to a job interview (not quite sure if I got the job) and got completely lost finding my way up there. Tried to call Kat but she didn't pick up. Tried to call __, then stopped by to see him, but I think I really annoyed him by stopping by. Made plans to hang out with someone on Friday, but I have a sneaking suspicion he might try to stand me up... if he does, I'm going to be mad as hell. I mean, he probably won't; but then again he has in the past.  My grandfather came in today from Arizona... I don't think he hears a word I say when I talk to him, he's lost most of his hearing.  Went to arbo today to buy something for somebody... spent too much damn money on what I got. I need to learn to be more cheap. Or I need to learn to spend my money on myself and not on other people. I should have bought some blank cds.  Eh. I'll get over it.

      I'm freaking out right now. I was just about to go to bed, when flipped on the tv, just to kinda flip through the channels for a few minutes and see what was on, when I stumbled upon the Kids in the Hall. Yay! I haven't seen that show in FOREVER! It's definitely my all-time favorite show too. Jeez, Mark McKinney was cute back in the day. *sigh* I read somewhere online that KITH came out on DVD, but I haven't really seen it anywhere. And anyways, I don't really have the money to buy it. :( But I'm totally psyched to finally watch it again. Although it does kinda suck that I have to stay up till 2 in the morning to watch it. But its worth the sleep deprivation.

      Finished priming/painting my bathroom. It looks awesome; I did a kickass job.  Even my parents were shocked at how decent it looked. Gotta remember to wake up early tomorrow... so I can go to the doctor (yet again), and my job interview/fair thing. And so I can go work out afterward. If I don't work out, I'll probably just come home and do some yoga. It's been awhile since I've done it, I really should get back into the habit.  I feel incredibly lucky today. Not exactly sure why; except today I was thinking about my life, and the people in it, and how my life is now compared to how it could be if I had made different choices... and I feel pretty blessed.    Admirable quotes of the day--  "Did you see the stickers I got on my car the other day? They're so awesome... I'll probably get shot for having them."  "I'm suffering from booty withdrawl."

      Called Wolf Camera today, and I'm going to their job fair on Wednesday. Called the DA's office to see if maybe I could intern today, but the line was busy and I was too lazy to call again later. So instead I just ran a couple errands and went home. I can't wait to get a job. I really hope that I get hired at this job fair on Wednesday. I just want to get a job and keep it for awhile. I have almost no stability in my life; its pathetic. But maybe a long-term job would change that around for me. I really need to pay off some stuff too. Mainly my car. I'm sick of my parents hanging that over my head. What I really want to do is pay it off, take off those gay purple lights and fix my header. And then my car would be awesome. I know that alot of people probably would disagree, thinking my car could never be awesome, but as old as it is,  I still think its a cute little car. And it gets me around.  3 days till my two month anniversary. 20 days till I start at Uncc. Two months and 4 days until I turn 18.  I'm going to the beach on Saturday. I kinda want to go, and at the same time, I kinda want to stay here and chill with J until he leaves to go to the beach, and stay and party with Kat and Kristin in Charlotte. I know I'm gonna come back early, but I still haven't figured out how early. Probably Tuesday or Wednesday. I'm gonna have to drive there and back by myself though, and that sucks. I've done it before, and its so boring without anyone with you to talk to for a few hours. Last time I drove there by myself, my dad let me borrow his radar detector which was SWEET. So maybe I'll get hooked up with that again.  In other news, I (also) am rocking the Jesus bling.  I think tomorrow I'm going to intern (for real this time) and then go work out. I need to work out... I haven't been in a few weeks. And maybe I'll chill with Steph and she will hook me up with some free food again.

      Mostly from all the priming I have had to do in my bathroom. The last time I painted it, I painted it with my mom, and we sponge-painted the whole bathroom grey, green, and red... which has proved a total pain in the ass to try to cover up. Especially since the new color is going to be white. I think I also managed to get more primer on myself than on my walls...  I got some primer on my jeans and belly, which doesnt not seem to want to rub off.  Probably not the best idea, wearing little clothing while painting. I guess I just figured it would wash off skin pretty easily; but apparently I figured wrong.

      I saw you standing in the corner On the edge of a burning light I saw you standing in the corner Come to me again, in the cold, cold night You make me feel a little older, Like a full grown woman might But when you're gone I grow colder, Come to me again in the cold, cold night I see you walking by my front door I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor I don't care what other people say I'm going to love you, anyway Come to me again in the cold, cold night I can't stand it any longer I need the fuel to make my fire bright So don't fight it any longer Come to me again, in the cold, cold night And I know that you feel it too, When my skin turns into glue, You will know that its warm inside And you'll come run to me, In the cold, cold, night

      My title has no actual meaning... I just stole it out of Bob's profile today because I thought it was amusing.  I finally got my laptop today!! I'm so excited to be on it. Its awesome to finally have my own computer. For awhile there, the only way I was even able to get on a computer was due to me having to sneak on my dad's or my friends letting me on their comps.  Tonight after I ate dinner I was having a serious nicotine craving (as I always do after eating... go figure) so I sneaked out of the house and drove around for a bit smoking... all was well until a little under a mile from my house I was pulled over.... I thought I was only doing five over, but apparently they had lowered the speed limit, and dumbass that I am, I didn't realize... so turns out I was going fifteen over. And I never actually got my full license, I still have my limited (I just never felt like going to the DMV and waiting for like, five hours just to get another license when I figured I had a perfectly good one)... and according to the cop that pulled me, that's just as bad as driving without a license. I managed to persuade him not to ticket me for not having a valid license, but he said he was still gonna cite me for speeding. So as soon as he walked to his car, I started thinking about how my insurance JUST went down by almost half what it was last year, and how it was for sure, going to triple now... and how bad I was going to get bitched out by my parents... and I just started bawling. So the cop walks back up to my car, and i feel like a total moron, just crying like a fucking child, so I'm trying to cover up my face (even though its pretty obvious I'm crying).... and he turns to me and tells me not to worry, cause he changed his mind and decided to just give me a warning. Which was really cool of him. Because I can't even pay my car insurance now, and if it tripled I'm damn near sure I would really not be able to pay it. I think its really unlucky that I got pulled, considering the only reason I was even out in the first place was just to smoke a cigarette. Moral to this story, kiddies? DON'T START SMOKING! You will turn into a raving addict such as myself. I actually did quit for a week not so long ago, and during which I almost completely lost my mind. So I don't think quitting is an option at this point... but I have cut back, which is good I guess. I was smoking a pack a day, and now I smoke a pack every 3 or 4 days.  So maybe this way it'll take longer for the cancer to kill me. Hmm...  I want to spend the night at a certain boyfriend's house on thursday, but I'm not quite sure how I'm going to get to unless I concoct some bullshit story to tell my parents. Which I will probably do, but I really don't like lying to them.   God, I'm tired. Its about 3 in the morning, so I think I'm gonna sack out... I gotta a semi-busy day tomorrow. I think I might actually try to intern.

      Ugh.... It's like two in the afternoon, and I JUST woke up. lol I didn't get hardly any sleep last night; I kept waking up every twenty or thirty minutes for some odd reason. And then I had to wake up for good at five-thirty. After I left J's place and drove home, I totally crashed... but then of course I only got to sleep for a little bit before I had to get up for church. Which was weird. I got a couple strange looks when I got there. Maybe its cause I hadn't been to church in a month before this morning. But anyways... after I got home after church I slept for about three hours, so I'm not going to pass out anytime soon. Anne came by and paid me for taking care of her dogs last week. She also brought these huckleberry flavored gummy bears, and OH MY GOD they are delicious. I can't stop eating them.  I hope these things aren't fattening. But even if they are, chances are I'm still going to binge on them.
