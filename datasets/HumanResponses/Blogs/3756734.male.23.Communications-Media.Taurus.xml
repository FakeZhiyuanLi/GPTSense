      It's not very often that you get an oppurtunity to compare publications on an equal footing. Doing it comes with the risk of never achieving a parity before giving a judgement. The  urlLink Birla story  however has thrown up a unique oppurtunity, quite similar to what a few media commentators did while tracking all American publications on 12th September 2002.  However, in this case too, its impossible to compare all the newspapers but the window of oppurtunity lies in the case of magazines, though just three to be precise. Three large and well established magazines -  urlLink India Today ,  urlLink Business World  (BW) and  urlLink The Week  - had the Birlas on their cover, last weekend. While readers may have by now experiencing a fatigue factor over the Birla coverage, I was merely enjoying reading the same story across the three magazines, and trust me, they were not quite the same.  Coming up at least a week after the entire episode blew up, there was a level playing field and also a limited set of news and events for everyone to report, and so they did and but the men stood out from the boys.  Business World's coverage led by DN Mukerjea was by far the best. It had all the regular information, but it was the way it was written and the exact details which made it read like almost a thriller. And that's the way, I guess, it should be. Even small details like Lodha took out the will from a everyday-used plastic was mentioned, stuff readers will always remember along with the magazine. India Today's coverage was a poor second. Just about okay with occasional mistakes, like it quoted two parts of the same will and said that they were two different versions and will be contested. The Week's coverage, was plain and simple, pathetic... you expect a very senior journo to write this kind of the story and in this case, if it was, then its really sad. I am presuming that it a job of a young rookie.  However, another reason why BW stands out is that it did ask the validity of the Rs 5000 crore (roughly a billion dollars) figure most people are quoting. It showed, and by correct means that it should be aroound Rs 550 crore, a more realistic figure. That's something none of the magazines and not even the newspapers seem to have explained and every one was going by their won crazy estimations, a trait often common with journos when they are chasing deadlines. TVS Shenoy however  urlLink pointed this  out on rediff long time back.  And, by know, dear reader, if you claim to have got tired of reading on Birlas and will jump at anyone saying that you know enough about them, well, its time for some intersting trivia, which you may have missed. Did you know that the Birlas were not always Birlas or that opium brought in the first big bucks for the Birlas? It's time to read  urlLink ET !    Postscript: Quite expectedly  urlLink Business Today  too came up with an issue with the Birlas in cover. Though they got a week more, the story had the same amount of information and BW continues to be the best. However, again quite expectedly, BT also had a story on the other young scions in business families and the possible scenarios in those business families. However, a better story would have been on whether business families in India Inc have credible succession plans. Tough story, agreed, why didn't we do it? It requires good amount of resources, a whole lot of journos are required to get working on it to bring out the story before the issue dies down and BT has it. They should have taken the risk.

       The   urlLink  appointment    of Mythili Bhusnurmath as the Chief Editor of Financial Express (FE) has finally confirmed what many of us were suspecting. Women are making their presence felt in Indian journalism. She becomes the first chief editor of a major Indian publication who happens to be a woman. Mythili was managing the editorial pages of The Economic Times (ET), prior to joining FE and replaces Sanjaya Baru, who took over as the media adviser to the prime minister.   In India at least, newsrooms are increasingly having an equal number of women journos, and I am not talking about people in the desk. At least in Times of India group, women journalists are almost as many as men and the Mumbai Resident Editor of both ET and Times of India are women. Though many would point out that it's juts an aberration, and that most editors and bureau chiefs continue to be men, most will agree that at least among our generation, there are more women becoming journos than men and it's only a matter of time before Indian media houses becoming a truly diverse organisation. (A WACC   urlLink  study    proves the point.)   Not an easy feat by any means, considering that while we journalists talk about transperancy, corporate governance, technology implementation and all the good things companies should follow, media organisations in most cases are the last to follow. At least when it comes to gender equaltites and work place diversity, we follow what we preach.   So is it that when it comes to women in media, we in India are at a far better position than developed countries including US? Our story on   urlLink  women in technology    proved that, but unfortunately, I couldn't gather any good data to prove this particular point.   However, a couple of interesting factoids about women journos in States did come up while I was searching on the   urlLink  emergence    of women in journalism. Born in 1864,   urlLink  Elizabeth Jane Cochran    is considered to be the first woman investigative journalist. Her pen name was Nellie Bly and one of her claims to fame is that she broke Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg's record for traveling around the world in 80 days by more than a week. Older than Cochran,   urlLink  Ida Tarbell   , is also considered one of the pioneers, but she started her career late and later became a celebrity in her own right.   But there is something more interesting if you look at the character of   urlLink  Anne Royall   , who made her mark in the 18th century. I am not quite sure though, whether she can be called a journo, considering her ways and means of getting news. She actually interviewed US president John Quincy Adams sitting on his clothes as he bathed in the Potomac and refused to budge before he answered all her questions. She would tour the American South in a coach along with four slaves searching for gossip and news and published something called the "Paul Fry".   So what does all this mean? Nothing much, news organisations are quite similar to any other organisation and benefits of diversity are common all across. For now, journalism, at least broadcast journalism, is the career of choice among the women in India. Not just because Priety Zinta plays the role of a journo in the flick Lakshya or a few ads which feature journos, but a study conducted by Grey Cells, a division of ad agency Grey Worldwide, called Evesdropping actually pointed out that broadcast journo is the career of choice for the maximum number of young Indian girls (41% to be precise)!

      This entire game of one "great leader" justifying another's stupid action took a new turn today. Bill Clinton, who is already hankering for any kind of publicity for his new book,  urlLink defended  British PM Tony Blair's decision to go forward with the Iraq war. Now it seems that atleast at one point Blair too  urlLink made headlines  justifying Bill Clinton on the decision to bomb Iraq (much before the Second Gulf War) amid allegations that Clinton is doing it to divert attention from the Lewinsky scandal...  Time to pay back or some stupid gimmickry to fool the people?

      A great piece of news reached my inbox this morning. An  urlLink Economist Intelligence Unit  report states that the global economy is going to grow at 4.9% this year. That will be the highest in the last twenty years. The US economy is expected to grow at the same pace, a marvelous tasks for such a large and developed economy and so will Japan, after all most 14 years.   The last year saw an unprecedented optimism in the Indian economy. The last quarter the economy grew by 8.4%. All this comes after the gloom years since 2000 and this was the largest quaterly growth since the 1980s. Now this optimism will be shared by the entire world. We are living in a fascinating period and it throws up immense possibilities not just for the economy but for us, young professionals. We (age bracket of 19-25) now make 45% of the nation's population. Its a young nation and while professionally it means more competition, it also means that we are part of a new nation, we can rebuild our nation's future.   Its the budget day, and while there are plenty of doomsday syares, thanks to the presence of the left in the government, I trust Chidambaram and Manmohan Singh to deliver and go forward with reforms. Its going to be a unique day the newsroom at The Economic Times. Huge amount of planning has gone into the budget issue. We will be doubling our pages as well as the number of copies we will sell tomorrow and the editor sent in a letter saying that there are absolutely no scope for any mistakes.  We will be getting two to three hours we will get to analyse and interpret the Mr. Chidambaram's speech and a small mistake in interpretation and analysis can be disastrous for a company or for an entire sector. The nation looks up to ET and its going to be a fascinating day at work too.

       526 Years. That's The Age Of This Auto Design!  The popularity of Dan Brown's  urlLink Da Vinci Code , among other things, has made Leonardo Da Vinci a mystic character. Now  urlLink an institute  in Florence, Italy has recreated an automobile model designed by Da Vinci, called  urlLink Da Vinci Coupe . Designed in 1478, it was supposed to be the world's first self propelled vehicle.  urlLink New York Times  describes the vehicle as, "The vehicle is, in truth, an ungainly looking and slightly mysterious creation: a boxy, open-top three-wheeler, just under six feet long and about five feet wide, with no seating and a motor made of coiled springs in what resemble wooden tubs."     Spinning the Web   Spiderman II has opened with a  urlLink big bang  in US. To be  urlLink launched in India  on 23rd July, distributors Columbia Tristars already has huge plans to make it a big success. Soon you will find all kinds of merchandise, including Ericksson phones designed on the Spiderman theme. The movie will be dubbed in three languages - Hindi, Tamil and Telegu and a Pakistani band Strings will feature on the  urlLink soundtracks .   However, its the launch of the Indian version of the comics which is more interesting. Peter Parker of Queens, the hero under the classic Spiderman mask, will be replaced by a young Indian boy named  urlLink Pavitr Prabhakar  from Mumbai, who will leap around rickshaws and scooters in crowded Indian streets, and swing from monuments such as the Qutub Minar and the Taj Mahal. US-based Gotham Comics, run by an upcoming media mogul, Gotham Entertainment froup has acquired the rights to the cartoon in the sub-continent and will be provide an  urlLink Indian version  to the movie.    Rearranged Marraige  Another sequel and the question is  urlLink how good it is ? Nagesh Kukunoor's fifth movie Hyderabad Blues II made its debut yesterday. One more movie which tries to be a cross-over or rather falls in the "multiplex movie" genre, an amazingly predictive way of making movies which supposedly targets the  urlLink young urban audience  in the country   Don is Dead   Talking of movies, we can't help but pay tribute to Marlon "Godfather" Brando who  urlLink passed away  yesterday. The man who starred in the movie "Street Car Named Desire" and was an icon for the babyboomer generation, didn't have a very happy ending. His attorney declared his death and the cause was undisclosed. Cursed with  urlLink high debt ,  urlLink irregular food habits  and an  urlLink unhappy family life , he must not died as a very happy man.

      Dipayan Baishya, 23 Correspondent, The Economic Times    Tucked in a secluded corner at the campus of  urlLink Jawaharlal Nehru University  is a rock called “Parthasarathy Rock”. Apparently, it’s the highest natural point in Delhi and gives a spectacular view of what a writer once called “City of Djinns”. It was three week since Dipayan had joined the master’s programme in economics at the university and sitting at the rock on a breezy night, it was time for some introspection. The university had celebrity professors, had been a jumping pad for aspiring bureaucrats or for others who wanted to get the right recommendations to enroll at the Ivy League universities in United States and had an inspiring campus. At the same time, it was a world of its own - lethargic, secluded, almost like a cocoon  where few seemed to care about the paradigm shift-taking place in economy, business, international relations and society in general. Commies filled the campus and most of the faculty and the students seemed to be still doped in the ideals of socialism. Change was almost blasphemous and most preferred to bask in the soft glory of “intellectualism”.   Next morning armed with a few articles written for The Statesman and college magazines, Dipayan started to make the rounds at the offices of business publications. Journalism was probably the best way to know the world around, reasoned Dipayan, and a degree in economics from Presidency College, Calcutta, was probably a good background to convince an editor to hire him. By August 2002, he was sent as a trainee reporter to the Bombay bureau of  urlLink Business Today , the largest business fortnightly in the country.   “Learn on the job and expect no one to spoon-fed you”, was the brief from the editor and for almost two years at Business Today, Dipayan was covering almost everything that might interest a business reader. Mainly into writing features and analyzing new developments, an absence of watertight compartments (called beats in journalism) gave him an opportunity to interact with the best brains in Indian Inc and at the same time specialize in the subjects that were of interest to him.  More than anything else, his stint at Business Today was a learning experience. Starting off with writing for the trends section, Dipayan has contributed articles for every section of the magazine, including, management, personal finance and back of the book and has over a hundred articles to his credit. He has also written for a few special editions and cover stories of the magazine.   Dipayan has recently joined  urlLink The Economic Times , the second largest business daily in the world and based out of Bombay. He is part of a small editorial team that brings out Corporate Dossier, a weekly supplement on management and strategy. Apart from contributing stories, Dipayan is now busy learning layout designing and production. He is also involved in developing and writing for a couple of columns in Corporate Dossier. Occasionally, he also writes for the main paper, Brand Equity, an advertising and marketing supplement and Media – a Hong Kong-based media magazine.   Business and entrepreneurial history, contemporary history, international relations and politics are some areas, which are of interest to Dipayan. He was associated with  urlLink Centre for Civil Society  – a libertarian think tank and while at college co-founded a youth-based NGO, Right Now and developed content for schoolcircle.com. Still quite young in the profession, Dipayan is eager to learn and further develop his skills in journalism and in the field of media.

      They make you feel miserable when they knock on your car window, cling to foreigners and in general give the city a bad name. I have made it a point not to give any money to the beggars. I don't know why, but I used to think that most of them are able bodied and wondered why they didn't work. Now there seems to be an answer. A survey done by beggars in Mumbai by a Bombay-based NGO, Social Development Centre, which also runs a school for street children have thrown up the startling results.   The  urlLink survey  says that on an average beggars in Mumbai earn Rs 300 a day! Talk about poverty lines? Many journalists do not start their career at that salary. What's more startling is that there is  urlLink one beggar family  in Kahr which earns Rs 1000 a day. The survey even states that while money making is easiest on the roads between Juhu and Bandra, on tuesdays the best sopt is the Siddhivinayak, wednesdays are good at St Michael’s Church and Mahalaxmi and Thrusdays are cool at Haji Ali! Apparently there are whole cartels which fight to keep their territories!   Make sure you do not donate money to any beggars, not even those that look the most miserable. Give them food, thats what I do. If you give them money, you are not just encouraging them not to work, but sustaining a menace.   PS: When a beggar once caught a friend of mine and said "bhagwan tera dua karega" (God will bless you), he had retored, "He has blessed me enough, ask Him to bless you instead". That we thought was a smart aleck comment and we all enjoyed it. Now it seems that the joke was on him!

      Floods are good, they help poor people catch fish and eat it. Any comment like this seems not just ridiculous, to most of us its criminal. The fact that Bikar's de facto King Lalu Prasad Yadav made it,  urlLink makes it  even more outrageous. In fact anything that has come out from Lalu, starting from the introduction of  urlLink kulhars  (earthen pots) in railway canteens to his slapping of railway offcials in full glare of television cameras seems rediculous, if not pure madness.  So why does Lalu do it? More importantly, even after doing this, almost in a clearly planned way, how come does he get the people's mandate everytime. The fact is Lalu is the supreme God when it comes to making the medium the media. Consider this, in the ruarl hinterland of Bihar, where Lalu comes from and derives power from, flood is a perennial occurance. Most people take it on their stride, they have been facing it for generations. And the son of the soil, too must have faced similar situations and he knows for a fact that villagers actually find it the best time to catch fish. The luxury of eating fish in normal times is limited to the rich who own the ponds. Whatever the hardships, this may be the only boon admist the bad times.  Or for the matter, most poor Biharis are often harassed by railway officials while travelling, invariably without tickets. To see that their messiah can actually slap those railway officials is almost unbelievable and ego boosting for them. To his constituency, these are the things which make Lalu dear, or why else does he get elected every time?  It's a fact that we have arrived at a juncture where tow Indias seprately exist. One, the middle class urban and semi-urban, aspiring-to-be-developed India and the other, the rural hinterland, where farmers are untouched by saas-bahu serials, India Shining campaings and where they commit suicide because they cannot pay the debt. And it's not the lifestyle that differs, the value system, definations of good and bad, and the way opinion is formed are entirely different. For us to appreciate Lalu's antics is almost impossible, simply because we staying in cities can never appreciate the way he realtes to his rural constituency. It's not just a lesson for politicians, every media manager and communication expert should try and derive lessons from it.  This by no means justifies Lalu's statement or logic, but it is does show the reason behind such a statement and why it often makes sense, things that often eludes us. Talking of floods. The hostage crisis in Iraq which involves three Indians being held hostage seems to hog media attention. The fact that more that more than  urlLink 1000  people have died in North and East India, including  urlLink 641  in Bihar alone seems to have escaped our collective conscience. Is it becuase it's easier for the media to report on Iraq rather than cross the ravines in Bihar or across Bharmaputra?  urlLink Shekhar Gupta  has posed an interesting question of how this obsession with the Iraqi crisis can be damaging for the nation. Not just politicans should take note of this even journalists too should make note of it. In the IC 714 Khandahar hijack case, the media should be equally held responsible for the way the nation dealt with the crisis and the way we succumbed to the terrorists.

      The recent India Today survey called State of States,  ranks Indian states on various parameters. Interestingly, it once again supports the fact that smaller regions are always better governed. Though the magazine doesn't seem to appreciate this point (this time, unlike last year, they had separate rankings for big and small states), it comes out pretty clearly. Smaller states like Pondicherry, Goa and Delhi seem to perform much better than larger states. Even among the big states, its Punjab and Kerela which lead the list, where as UP and Bihar are at the very end. Utranchal, which was seprated from UP recently fares much better than the parent state. Last year, when there was a combined ranking, Goa was the topper.  This underscores the point that smaller administrative regions are better managed. Looking at an international perspetive, Singapore experienced higher rates of growth once it broke away from Malaysia. Smaller regions like Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan performed much better than mainland China. Therefore, does the solution for achieving high growth rates in India, lie in creating a thousand Singapores or at least a thousand Delhis or Gurgaons across the country?  However, the counter argument is that creation of smaller states increases government expenditure. Its true, but its more because of the fact that the current fad of carving out smaller states generates from political demands. A new state means a whole new set of politicians can become MLAs and ministers and that increases government spending. Politics shouldn't dictate such measures, its economics which should.  Another interesting perspective which the survey threw up was the good performance of the states in the North East, a regions that is often ignored. Mizoram and Sikkim top the charts in health, education and law and even with a treacherous terrain, Sikkim's 70% of households have access to tap water. No mean achievement by any means. Its the same for all the other states. And once again, the largest state Assam, lags behind in the North East. That's on all counts, including the fact that only 9% of households in Assam have access to tap water.  Note: Across the blog, you may find that I don't give the underlinks to India Today and Business Today. That has nothing to do with my opinion of the magazines, they are one of the best in India. It's simply becuase of the fact that they have lousy webmasters who update the website after atleast five days aftre the magazine appears on the stands. Moreover they are both paid websites.
