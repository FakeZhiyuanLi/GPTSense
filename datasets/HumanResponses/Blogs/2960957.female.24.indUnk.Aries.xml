      It's called  urlLink grouphug.us  and it lets random people post anything they wish to confess anonomously....some of this stuff made me laugh so hard I cried.  Here's an example:   "after eating peanuts, or peanut butter, my poo has a very distinct smell. Occasionally, I eat large quantities of peanuts, dress up nice and go to high end clothing & shoe stores. I find the snobbiest employee available and I ask them for help. While they are helping me I fart continuously, waiting for the employee to react. I have done this 37 times and at 5 different stores. I've only been asked to leave once by a girl that I had done this to 2 times before."    haaaaaaaaaahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahaaaaa!  that's awesome.

      Can I just say wooooooooomfhoooooooooooo?!  Steven Tyler rocked his little black and white checkered pants wearin, harmonica playin ass off last night.  They sounded so good, and I was completely star struck the entire time.  My throat hurts from screaming so much.  My favorite part?  hmmm..."The Other Side" when Steven came towards the area where Derek and I were sitting on this groovy little platform that stretched out past the standard stage.  Rock!  He was  totally  looking at my drunk ass pointing at him (like he needed to be pointed at).  I find myself doing that often when bands are playing at concerts and bars or what not.  Something about identifying the lead singer, or whoever is being featured, is necessary when I'm intoxicated.  It was a little awkward at the John Mayer Concert, but uh, I still felt the need to do it.  hardyhar.  I would definitely go see them live again...I had a great time and loved that I had my man with me.  I know it's cheesy, but my love for him just keeps growing...no matter how many arguments or pissy moods, it always seems to work itself out and teach us both more about each other.  I couldn't have asked for a more caring and loving person to be in my life.  It's overwhelming sometimes...I guess I'm getting a little more emotional because of him leaving in a few weeks.   *sigh*   Absence makes the heart blahblahblah.  yeah, I guess, but damn it-  enough of that.  I turned in my first draft yesterday.  My prof said it was a little shorter than the others.  What a terd.  22 pages of text bee-yahch...not to mention the 9 appendices at the end.  Who would say that?  Oh well...i better freaking graduate.  I wanna be a Master!  A Psychological Master! Just pass me...I worked my patootie off for 2 yrs.  I PROMISE I learned.  Geez Louise.    Now it's time to veg at work.  Does it bother me that I have nothing to do today?  Not so much.  I deserve a pick-your-nose Tuesday.    p.s.   I had to add this in.  Am I the only one who didn't know that there was such a thing as a  convertible  Ford Taurus?  Score.  Kind of like the sportier version of a Lincoln Town Car with t-tops.  nerd alert!  I just happened to see the Taurus on my way to work...champagne with a dark brown top.  classy?  you decide.

      I'm done! I'm done!  Le papier d'internship est fine mes amis.  Who knows if that's the correct French form, but cha know what?  It doesn't matter because I AM FINITO babee.  I'm turning in the first draft to my prof this evening and then it's Aerosmith.  Oh yeah, you read correctly...Derek and I are gonna rock n' roll tonight Steve Tyler style and Man oh man if I can't wait to see that mouth live and on stage.  It'll be  Crazy  and I'll be  Cryin'  because they're totally gonna  take me to the other side  with  Sweet Emotion .   Dream on , gurl, you just better be glad you got tickets because  you don't wanna miss a thing .    Watchoh back watchoh back....I'm a wee bit excited if you can't tell.  woohoo, and we're off.

      Whew...major part of paper finished.  I'm still around 17 pages in length, but I had to cut a bunch of poo out and add better stuff.  If these entries seem lacking in articulation and overall pep, it's totally because all of that energy is being fed to said paper.  I wanna be done, people...I'm sick of writing about writing this thing.  blech.  I'd like to order a double stack wah burger and a large order of french cries please!  Aside from that, Derek's going overseas for 2 months starting in April.  I'm sad, but I know it'll be okay.  It was kind of awkward on the phone when he told me last night.  He kept reassuring me that everything would be okay and not to worry, which is totally sweet and something I needed to hear, but at the same time I wanted his opinion on the whole experience (besides the fact that he would miss me).  Are you excited?  What do you expect?  What do you want to see when you're there?  You know, stuff like that.  When I tried asking him questions in order to get this information out of him, it's like he viewed it as me trying to change the subject or trying to make sure that he wouldn't be in harm's way.  I get it...don't worry...I'll be sad, but I'll get over it.  I think it'll be easier to do that if I can hear how excited he is about the opportunity and would elaborate on it.  He didn't understand what I wanted him to tell me.      It is pretty amazing how he was prioritizing my feelings over the details of the trip, but it's not like he's going to be gone for a year or anything.  In fact, it's gonna be kick ass girl's night most of the time while he's gone.  I'll hopefully get to hang around with my friends a little more during the weekends and take care of the stuff I don't always get to consistently (like keep my apartment clean, go shopping all day, letting the pit hair grow...haha...kidding).  Don't get me wrong...it ain't gonna be a party, but I've been independent many a time before Derek...I'll be fine.  I love him, but we don't see each other all that often anyways so it won't be that much of an adjustment.  Enough of that.  Must work on, well...you know.   *sarcastic 'yay' face*

      Did you know my birthday is exactly 13 days?  Me niether, until looking on the calendar just now.  Derek asked me what I wanted the other day for the big 24 and I asked for 8 orgasms in a row.  A girl can dream, huh?  Actually, I like the surprise thing so I think that's why I avoided giving a true and attainable answer  (Maybe the original answer is attainable, but uh, someone needs to share tips because this girl has been missing out) .  If I did have to give an answer, which I might still do since I have a couple of things in mind, I would ask for an ipod thingie so I can jam during workouts or a day at the spa gift certificate.  I would love a full day of pampering, especially since I constantly have some kind of muscle ache from working out.   Paper FYI : Still truckin...Hoping to wrap it up by tomorrow.   Workout FYI : Last session with Gary involved lots of compliments about my form!  woopiteewoo, I can follow instructions.  I also asked him something I wasn't planning on asking which was,  "So when am I going to see some muscle action on bod Sara?"   To which he replied with a lot of fitness mumbo jumbo that I had heard a million times before.   "It depends on your body type....you're already in shape so it may take longer to see results (that actually not so familiar of a tip)...muscle is denser than fat..."  blahdiggityblah.   I'm trying to keep my focus off of the frame of mind that has how I look as its number one priority.  Of course I'm concerned with overall health, but honestly, my number one goal in working out is to stick with it...FOREVER MAN!  I mean, I am soooo capable of doing this poohaha, and I'm sick of taking month or more long breaks from it which ultimately retards my results.    I'm on my way this time, buddy.  So watch out.

      17 pages so far and no writer's block to be found!  If anyone would have told me when I was in high school that I would write a 17 out of an estimated 30 page paper in a few short years, I would've laughed histerically and then gone a smoked a joint in fear/celebration of my future.  Ah ...adolescence.

      Ladies and gents, we are making progress on the paper.  I foresee the first draft done by tomorrow.  My work supervisor said he's a brutal editor and wouldn't mind reviewing it for me so I foresee that going down either tomorrow afternoon, but most likely on Thursday.  This will be helpful since he has a Ph.D. in what I only will have a Master's in.    Once initial critiques are fixed, attach and send babee!  Major weight lifted and means for celebratory drinking to begin.    With that said, I will keep this entry brief and continue my typing fever.     Pasta E Fagioli  came out wonderfully, though I realized I had bought the wrong kind of sausage (smoked links instead of uncooked itlaian-style sausage), but lo and behold it tasted fabulous.  Fibrous deliciousness for my Monday night.  JD couldn't make it for dinner because of a last minute cousin of a friend coming into town, but I enjoyed my usual company just fine (me, Maxx, and TV).  Workout with Gary tonight and then it's on my own for financial purposes.  I also want to see how well I do by myself with all of the new stuff I learned from Gary.  But, oh yes, it is now paper time.    It just occurred to me (see how my mind works...hmmm...procrastination?!) that anyone reading this might be wondering more about my internship, what I went to grad school for, and what my current job is.  I think I touched on it in an earlier entry, but I could definitely go into more detail.  It has to be later, though.  Until then, have terrrrriffic Tuesday and don't be a procrastinator like me!

      I am  very  tired and my calves are all knotted up from training fun with Gary.  I actually did the calves on my own since our time ran out before I was finished, but apparently I did them the 'right way'.  All of my bodily muscles have taken turns with their ouchiness and first time back to the gym kind of pain.  The next phase of soreness is a piece of cake, but damn if I already thought I had gotten through the first round.  I was planning on a run/walk with JD this afternoon, but I already called to cancel because I'm a big weenie.  This is the kind of calf pain that when attempting to stretch you get such a funky, twisty focused pain that it kind of makes you laugh.  Anyone understand?   Maybe I'm the only one that laughs.  Maybe I just laugh because I don't understand this unfamiliar yet intense pain.    Oh yeah...brief update.  Got some work done on the ole paper yesterday which has totally boosted my confidence in my ability to get this internship wrapped up in pretty pink paper and sent off to Masterland ASAP.  I still have a ways to go (as it always seems), but I feel more organized and ready to go.  I didn't work on it today because of lack of sleep last night (stayed out late with boyfriend and his parents who are visiting for spring break) and I had to move to another office down the hall.  Yeah...thought I had 18 year old energy so I busted out the independent furniture moving thinking, "poo on asking some dude to help the new personally trained buff Sara".  Ummm, hi, I'm tired...and lacking focus.  Other news in...JD and I are replacing healthy exercise time with healthy eating time.  I bought all the goodies to make Joelle's healthyliscious  urlLink Pasta E Fagioli  Yumdidley.  Smell ya later.  Hopefully I'll be perkier then.

      I got off the phone with my friend Michelle just a little while ago.  She's in the same graduate program as I am and is someone I've really enjoyed getting to know and hang out with.  Michelle is 30 and is a really determined person.  She is also a hard-core rocker chick and repeatedly keeps me and my friends amused on her 80's enthusiasm.  I don't want to paint a crimped hair picture, because she is definitely not stuck in the time era per se, she just has a lot of memories and knowledge from the punky-flourescent 80's...as I do from the copy-all-the-other-decades 90's.  Anyways, we were talking about the dreaded internship paper and she informed me that one of our professors told her that he would need the paper toMORROW if we wanted to graduate on time.  Hulloooo!?!?  Did you not just inform me through email last week that I could turn it in at the end of March, maybe with your preference being a week before that so you could read it during spring break?  argh!, aaaa!, and poo.  The reason for this surprise ending is that 4 other people are trying to graduate.  Two of the losers are old grad students that SHOULD've been done this time last year.  Apparently they get seniority over our friggin graduation.  I'm pissed, but I understand....I guess.  I mean why should I have to fork out another $700 dollars per credit hour to graduate in the summer when I could be done in the predicted and reasonable amount of time.  Conspiracy.  I predict that I can talk my prof into letting me get done by next week...a week  earlier  than what I thought.   *heart rate increases*  I would bust ass to get it done for tomorrow but uhhhhhh.....I only have like 7 out of 30 pages written.  I mean I probably could do it, but I want to write a good paper that I feel confident about.  Not going to happen if I slop through it in one night.  I wanna graduate dammit!  What's a girl to do?  I know, skip lunch and write the damn paper.

      Yodles.  So Gary has redeemed himself.  He kicked my ass on quads and hams yesterday and so I signed up for another session for Sat.  I'm actually going to work out on a Saturday.  Go me.  I am taking the night off from working out, though because I'm pretty stiff still and I don't want to over do it.  Friday, I'll hit it hard with the cardio.  45 minutes, 30 of which I'm going to try and run.  I think it'll be easier now that I haven't smoked this week and have been building my leg muscles.  I do need to work on my calves, though.  Next week.  Now it is paper completion time.  mkay...positive thoughts...deep breaths.    I talked to my mom this morning.  She just got a new job and had the day off since she hasn't started yet.  I miss her and my dad so much right now.  That gives me more incentive to finish my paper so they can come down in the beginning of May for graduation.  Stress be gone!  abracadabrawammiepoof!

      Need to do this before I forget stuff.   Stuff to get with Friday's check:  -tanning membership -oil change -Maxx's medicine -health food store membership/groceries -spring/summer work shirts -save $100 for trip home in May -save for rent -car insurance, utilities, and cell bills -cool socks -Garhead's training sessions  I guess the savings and paying off bill parts wouldn't be classified as stuff to get, so maybe the title isn't very applicable to what I wanted to record.  Oh well.  That is all.  p.s. what's up with me and "stuff"?  Time to start reading again.

      So last we talked, Trent was coming to town.  It was a fun weekend, a drunk weekend at that.  Since I met with trainer Gary, he told me to log my food intake for the week... and let me tell you what an awareness wake up call that was as far as alcohol was concerned.  Uh, I drank like 11 drinks throughout Sat. night which basically upped my calories two times more than the food.  good job druck ass.  Well, I kept justifying that it was a friend in town let your hair down kind of weekend so I didn't really hold back.    As of this week I am going to drastically reduce the amount of alcohol I drink and cigs I smoke.  My throat hurt by Sunday night and I had only smoked less than a pack that weekend.  I really hate that shit....soooo... no mas.  Or at least less.  A LOT less.  It was also embarassing to show Gary how much I drank.  I'm not that concerned about his opinion, but it was a semi-uncomfortable moment for me.  Luckily, he just kind of snickered about it, but I know deep down inside he's probably like  "yeah, I used to do that shit...glad I don't anymore...she'll never learn...you can't get biceps like these if your downin' the ale like that broad...man, I love my muscleyness" .  Well, maybe not, but predicting the other person's thoughts is what causes the anxiety.    After the extremely brief nutritional recap (G. didn't really make any comments except for noting that 'Thursday' was my best day.  thanks for the generous tip, I'll keep that in mind from now on), we hit the floor where I worked out my back and triceps.  Holy moses am I sore today.  I learned a lot about proper form with the back exercises Gary had me doing.  Apparently, I've never worked my back out correctly and so the session was well worth it.  I don't know if it's coming off in my post, but I'm a little bitter about my last training session.  Garhead, although very thorough and considerate in the first session, was a little aloof during the second.  Like I mentioned earlier, he did not say anything about my nutrition for the week except for  "you can drank girl"  (so from Alabama) and noting Thursday as my best day.  No mention of the right amount of calories, no hounding me about cutting back on the booze or increasing the protein.  Good thing I'm somewhat educated on this stuff, otherwise I would've thought that the documented week would've been just gravy...especially  THURSDAY .  Neato.   Garhole also kept giving shout outs on the gym floor to everyone and their dog...especially skinny big boobs who I sware is on the Hooter's billboard I pass on the way home from work everyday.  I have no problem with the girl being a hooker...hehm...I mean looker, but I do have a problem when my money is paying for schmooze time amongst the beef.  I'll forgive him.  Have to, I'm seeing him again today.  Besides a lot of it is in my control.  I'm the customer and I have to tell the man what I want.    Before changing topics I do have to throw in a funny fitness comment.  I was at a kickboxing class last night (which is the most fun one I've ever been to...real boxer with real afro as instructor) and the instructor cracked me up during abs.  We were sitting with our legs straight out and leaning slightly back and the dude said  "Man, this thing always makes me burp...just can't hold it in *focuses attention at someone else*...just can't".   No one else laughed, but I had to take an crunch break I was laughing so hard.   Alas...intestinal/potty humor tickles my fancy again.  Does anyone else get freaked out and/or annoyed when ordering inside a Wendy's and they call out every damn thing you order?  Once, I told the lady my complete order, only to hear her ask if this was dine in or take out and then ask me for my order so she could say the whole thing on the intercom system.  I had to repeat the whole damn order, with pauses between items so she could spout each of them off...this includes the small chile ..."chili"..... a side salad ..."side salad"... the low-fat honey mustard dressing ..."honey mustard, lowfat" ...and a medium diet Coke ..."Diet coke".   Annoying to even read, right?  I mean I understand and support their intentions behind this system (ensuring accuracy of order), but I still got the wrong damn size chili.  Stop freaking out the public and just push the register button.  I'm in a good, but sleepy mood.  My brain has gone through overload the last two days by trying to learn about a statistical program that is very important to my field of work (SPSS).  Bastards at my graduate school never taught it to us, but I hope they enjoyed my $25k in the last year and a half.  Way to educate, guys.  Luckily, I have a very intelligent and cool supervisor that knows this program internally and externally and is attempting to teach me some stuff so that I can apply it to a big part of one of my jobs here...data cleaning/analyses.  Chandler Bing?  huh?  Hey, I have no problem working the boring yet sometimes draining desk job in exchange for the skills building and paycheck I'm getting right now.  This is real world job number one and it is purely a resume builder.  At least that's what I keep telling myself.  I do know that it's highly unlikely I'll stay here for more than another year.  I'm all about the change, man.  I'm also trying to contribute more to my graduating on time by writing this bloody paper.  It's kind of weird spacing out when I write certain sections of the paper, I'm so used to rushing to get it done, usually the morning of.  Obviously that isn't an option in this 30 page case, but I'm not able to shake the mental pressure.  There are worse things I suppose....like the Bush-Kerry carnivore feed going on right now.  haha.  It really is more humorous than anything.   Note : Last time Sara talks politics.  The end.  Happy Tuesday.  Eat more fiber! (Note to self).

      Boy howdy my butt is on fire, but in a good way.  Alright pervo, I went to the gym last night so that's why.  I felt great lifting away and running on the treadmill while a variety of fellow fitness f...people worked out around me.  Some even stared at me.  Especially spikeyish haired 50-something lady walking next to my treadmill.  I was going to do the check and see wtf you want stare back, but I assumed she wasn't really looking at me, only gazing to the right side of the workout facility much like I was.  However, I try to spread out my gazing so as to not make others feel uncomfortable.  No biggie.    "Important relevance".  Yes, it's redundant.  Yes, someone had to point that out to me today.  So sue me...I haven't had to get all academic in a couple of months so I was trying to win everyone over with some not too advanced, but still smart sounding to the average reader vocab.  I got carried away. Whatever.  I'm still learning.    Trent is on his way and it's Weekend-Party-Balls fest 2004 (not to be confused with Beach-Beer-&-Boys 2003...more on that later).  I hope.  Whatever the amount of drinks be poured down my throat, I just hope that there's lots of laughing and happy dances.  I'll probably talk enormous amounts of shit, tell Trent more embarassing things that I regret the next day like when I shoplifted clothes as a teen, all the while sucking down cigarettes, gin and tonics, and maybe a Cosmo or 8.  Good Friday.    Hey...side note:  I got some more work done on my paper today, created a new task for me to complete and add to my "internship duties" fluffy section of the report, and haven't even craved chocolate for the day.  Who rocks the roll?  hehm. moi.

      I met with trainer Gary yesterday and I am pumped.  I did what I said I was going to do, which is lay out exactly what I want in the beginning.  Luckily, one of the first things that he said was "what can I do for you?".  After that I crapped at the mouth with random stuff about my fitness past to wanting him to explain thepoo out of everything fitness related...on and on and on.  He cracked a smile during that comment and said "I think you and I are gonna get along just great.." or something to that effect.  Gary educated me.  I honestly thought most of what I would be hearing would be repetitive since I am addicted to health and fitness mags, websites, etc., but so not the case.  The session was only supposed to be 30 minutes, but I stayed for like 45.  He even had a client waiting on him.  Thank God I didn't get blown off like I thought I would be.  We have our next appointment on Monday and that's when we'll actually get on the floor.  I did the elliptical for 30 min. after our mtg., but wasn't brave enough to hit the equipment.  I'm going to do it today, though.  He gave me a workout split that I'm going to play with today and then hopefully he'll give me more specific exercises and form tips on Mon.  I'm pleased.  I might be out $200 next paycheck for more personal training sessions, but whodf cares.  I've wanted to do something like this forever and financially, I can now.  ruff....or rawr, whatever your pleasure.  So I wanted to graduate next month, right?  I really am slacking on the writing today.  PIck it up hook, get it over with.  That's what I'm going to do now.  I can't believe I actually motivated myself to get some work done.  Ha!  Take that lazy voice in my head...take that!  On with it.  buh.

      Good productive day.  I worked on my internship paper this morning and really am trying to get the first draft done in two weeks.  hell, I used to whip up 5 pagers the morning that they were due, so why shouldn't I be able to bust out a thirty page or so report on my summer camp trip...hehm...I mean lively I-O internship in 2 weeks.  It's the last diddy before I say goodbye to my college years officially.  For now at least.    Okay, I'm addicted to reading weblogs.  I forced myself to focus on work today, but I tell you what....reading about the lives of other people, especially other people that are bright and witty, is quite amusing and therapeutic.  I wanted to skip a lot of the crappy ones and head straight for the 'good' (ones appealing to moi of course)ones, so I checked out the blogger award thingies and was struck by one of the best headliner and overall nominees...tenth-muse, you're damn site is really distracting my concentration at work, and I have to tell you...thanks.  No really.  I'm only up to April '03 and am thoroughly enjoying myself.   NOTE :  When I actually become the computer nerdo that I dream about being I'll be able to add links and stuff in a sidebar, but until then, here's  urlLink Joelle  Aside from that, fuck smoking.  That's right, ladies and gents...it's really not good for you as you may have assumed.  I know it looks cool as hell, especially when the tv losers do it, but it's a killer.  and you won't be young and resilient forever. resiliant?ient?  dunno.  Why the 'tude?  I went running yesterday, which quickly turned into walking.  ick.  It killed to only jog a mile and I had to force myself to start walking with my friend JD.  I only had 2 cigs yesterday, but out of my norm, I smoked one on the way home from work (just for kicks, rebellion, whatever) which I usually don't do because it just doesn't taste as good then.  Anyways, that could've played a major role, but... excuse de lame-o #98314.  I'll work on it.  So, woohoo...personal training session numero uno tomorrow.  Olaf (a.k.a. Gary) better lay on the fitness education thick.  I want major explanations going on.  The more specific and seemingly obscure, the better.  I kind of doubt I'll get just that, but I really really hope I don't get the opposite.  You know, the people that are just doing this part of the job (and by 'this' I mean introducing all the newbie motivated fitness peeps to the equipment and help shape their personal fitness goals eventhough they will most likely stop coming to workout after a month or so) cuz they have to.  That's not me.  Promise...I'm going to do it.   I think I can play some part in making what I want happen by letting ol' boy know that I'm ready for him to bring on all the fitness advice he's willing to share no matter how many times he's had to repeat it or I've had to listen to it.  I need some umph.  So, JD and I are going to try and start meeting at the track MWF's and I'm going to do strength training on TTR and maybe Saturdays at the gym.  Good plan.  Oh yeah, I can plan the hell out of the workout schedule, but can I do it.  Yes. duh. go.

      Monday, Monday.  I have a love-hate relationship with this day of the week.  It's either the day where I have a fresh start and am ready to start a new week refreshed or it's the day that I dread all weekend long and show up to work sluggish and out of it until around Tuesday afternoon.  I'm somewhere in between those two today.    My weekend was spent sleeping for so long that I had too much awakeness to know what to do with.  I was so alert that I couldn't even fall into a relaxing nap on Sunday afternoon or even go to bed early so I could get up at blasted 5:30am the next day.  I hate being too rested.  Then again, I dream about that state when I am majorly exhausted.  Aye me.  So hard to satisfy.  NOt always, but sometimes.    So I joined that gym on Friday.  I figured I was falling into an exercise and diet rut...slowly but surely and it was time to find the distractor and change in my plan.  I've always wanted to do this gym-personal trainer thing once I've worked out on my own for a while and it's cool that I'm doing it.  I blew off working out this weekend, justifying my appointment on Wednesday.  I hate when I do that, but that's where I am right now.  ick...writing about it makes me that much more uncomfortable.  Let's analyze shall we.  REASON 1:  Fear.  Fear of, oh I dunno, giving up, gaining tons o weight, eating unhealthy all the time, eating healthy all the time and missing yummy foods, starting yet another cycle of doing it then stopping then doing it another way then stopping, etc.  Well, that pretty much sums it up.  Hey, now I'm aware.  I can stop there, stop thinking it to death and actually ride it out and do it.  I haven't given up yet.  Let's count the ways I haven't given up. - I bought good stuff at the grocery store - I ate good for me stuff on Friday night - I signed up for a gym membership and fitness assessment appointment. - I ran twice last week. - I brought my lunch to work today.  Gurl, go on.  Who said it would be easy?  Do it to it.

      Just devoured my granny smith apple.  yumdiddley.  I'm considering joining a gym by my house.  I have been thinking about it for a while now and because this one is so close, it's more likely that I'll go.  I want to strength train again.  I love how I can run so much longer and with less pain when I do it.  I also love all of the other well known benefits: feeling stronger, developing noticeable muscle definition, improved metabolism, etc.  I got really avid about it a few summers ago during undergrad.  I followed a Muscle and Fitness magazine plan with a friend at the college rec.  That gym facility was awesome.  Huge, and easily accessible since I was on campus everyday.  There were many reasons why I committed to that program longer than any other one (2.5 months may not seem long to you, but it was a huge deal for me at the time), but the one that I know worked best for me was that it was a specific plan that outlined exactly what I needed to do.  I didn't follow the diet plan, but I drastically increased my protein intake, did not really cut down the carbs like a lot of traditional get-muscley kind of programs suggest, and I lost 5 pounds over the course of the 2 or 3 months.  I was also in a school aerobics class for 5 weeks that met 4 times per week.  I thought that it was really cool that I lost that weight gradually and mainly just by working out.  I also didn't drink all that much then.    Drinking has definitely increased the older I get and the more social I became in grad school.  I also just love wine.  Whether I'm with people or not, I just love a good glass of wine, or two, or 5.  Anyways, during the week I've really cut down because I really have no desire to drink other than boredom, but on the weekends, especially summer weekends spent at the beach, the beer, wine, and whatever else certainly does start a flowin.  Doesn't help when you're trying to count calories.  I'm working on it though.    Ok, back to the gym thing.  I think fate made it so I would see the cheap ad on some local tv channel yesterday that interviewed some of the trainers and members that use and/or work at this particular fitness center I'm interested in.  I got to see the inside and didn't realize that it was as big as it was and had as much equipment.  If I can afford it, I'magonnadoit.  It would be great to have a fitness assessment that gave me all of those great specifics that I need to see.  Measurements, weight, Body mass, etc.  That way I can see the progress.  I also want a full out personal workout plan for me that tells me how much weight to add and when.  That's been an issue for me in the past.  I know how to use most equipment properly, how many sets and reps in general, but I don't know how to build up my plan and when to start switching stuff around.  I'm ready for the edification, Olaf, Bruce, and Trish.  Teach me o' wise meaty muscled toned ones.  I want to be in your club.  You know who else's club I want to be in?  The triathlon people's club.  yep.  Wanna train for it with a local group starting in June.  I have three months to think about and prepare for this.  If I can get through three more months of working out on my own...I'm going to do it.  I will buy a bike and all of the other necessary toys that will help me to accomplish this feat.    Want to hear something that will probably embarass me, but I'm probably going to say anyways?  Neat. Two years ago I was in a sports equipment store and bought a Nike 2-piece swimsuit because I was going to start swimming laps with my friend.  Well, I blew the dust off of it a couple of days ago, put it and my new pair of running shoes on and started to play pretend.  The game where I pretend I'm a superb athlete and am wearing my triathlon getup about to complete yet another highly physical competition.  I actually could see myself being that person minus the jiggle and goofie expression I had on my face.  I can do this and I will.  Since I'm still doing the thinking about it thing, I can't say that it will be this year, but it will be soon.  It's time to start seeing what else I am capable of.  Don't y'all love discovering that kind of stuff about yourself?  I certainly do and will try hard to always be that way.

      Today I'm questioning my commitment to doing this blog poo.  Since we're not acquainted yet, let me inform you that my use of the word 'poo' has greatly increased in the past 2 years and in no way do I attempt to change that.  It's the insert for the word or phrase I can't think of at that particular time.  Everyone has one.  So, what will the theme of this be?  Better yet, what will the multiple themes be for this site?  Self-awareness is the great grandmother of it all and with that said, we'll just have to discover what else pops up.  I can guess a lot of it will have to do with reality show comments, food, weight loss/exercise crap, my boyfriend, my kids (which are not born or even fertilized yet but it doesn't stop me from already obsessing over them and how I want to raise them), my dog Maxx (hence  maxxipunk ), adjusting to a real world job after having finished my Master's degree, and who the hell knows what else.  It'll be interesting to read back over the pages of this journalmajig in the future and observe patterns in my behavior and other fun stuff that will make me more aware.  I'll explain more about this aware-kick that I'm on, probably on the ole get to know her page.  Until then, happy reading.

      I met my current boyfriend through an online dating service.  You know, I still feel kind of reluctant telling people that, but at the same time I'm trying to help the stigma fade away so I give a confident answer of truth when anyone asks how we met.  The abbreviated version of that stigma is: desperate, can't swing it in a face to face world - person.  This is so not true...may be for some, may have been a somewhat appropriate description of the past online dating world, but now it's not that uncommon in any age or social group of people.  Even if a person can't "swing it" in a face to face setting, who the fuck cares?  We all benefit from love and interaction with our preferred sex, and we all are social in different ways.  Hell, I feel like I articulate my thoughts better when I write on this thing than when I speak.  Many others feel that way as well so how cool is it that there is a safe way to meet people without all of the nervous anxiety that many times distracts us from being ourselves when talking to someone in a bar, per se.  And why should I be apprehensive about sharing where I met the best boyfriend I've ever had?  Derek gave me a case of the butterflies this buddha hasn't felt in many moons.  Here was this super cute blondie who was seemingly intelligent, proud of where he was in life, close to his family, and had good grammar and spelling.  What more could a girl ask for?  I've told Derek on more than one occasion about how his grammar was a big plus factor to my first impression of him.  Our relationship is hard for me to grasp sometimes, as I want to have a good understanding about  everything  in life, especially those things or people that I love.  We only see each other on the weekends (unless he's deployed overseas, and then it's a little longer) and we don't have a lot of riveting or lengthy conversations on the phone during the week except for the standard "how was your day?" kind of stuff.  When we are together, however, I have lots of feelings including those of the security, loving, happy, frustrated, confused, tired, restless type.  These are all part of love and relationship growth, I suppose.  I love Derek and understanding him is something that I try to constantly do because of that.  I want us to be best friends.  I want us to be happy and excited about 'things'.  'Things' that maybe we never knew we liked before or that one person introduces to the other.  We are inevitabely not always going to like the same 'things', but as long as there are some, I think that the relationship is good.  One area where we differ is expressiveness.  Scratch that, let's call it enthusiasm.  Sometimes I feel as if my head will explode into colorful confetti and cheap fireworks because I get so excited about the smallest things. Made up but plausible examples:  "Oh my gah, Derek, this chicken is  incredible .  In fact, eating at this restaurant tonight with the weather being so clear and warm and the fact that our waitress is being so friendly makes this night the best I've had in a while.  Isn't this chicken amazing?"  or a simple  "Damn, that movie was hilarious."  maybe a  "Taco Bell is all that is good and correct and fabulous in this variety of fast food chains in which we have to choose"  What is Derek's likely response to most things I find and speak of with more fervor than my friend Michelle's contempt for George Bush II?   "It's alright"   HuhWha?   Alright  is all you can say about this knock you on your ass chicken/hilariously funny movie/Taco Bell establishment?  I don't know why hearing this phrase come out of his mouth tics me off so much, but it does...or it did.  I asked him recently why he said it so much and he gave a respectable and believable answer, "I'm just not that easy to impress".  Why on earth should I be upset when the guy makes perfect sense?  It just takes a lot to impress him, so get over it if he's not like you.  One day as I was frustrating myself into oblivion with relationship woes, I tried to think of a time where Derek made a comment about something being above "alright", better than mediocre, ... impressive .  And then it dawned on me...I hear it nearly every day that we get to spend with each other.    "Baby,  you're  amazing."  Shut me up.  It makes it that much more special now knowing that I have an 'amazing' impression on the hard to impress.  I'm learning slowly and not without struggle that besides having to work at accepting people as they are or what they say or what they do, you have to find the good in that, and there is always some good, you may just have to search harder for it sometimes.    The more I let go of my preconceived ideals of "the perfect guy for me" (not that I ever had a clear definition of what that was) as well as what personality characteristics I think best compliment mine, the more I realize that I can love things about a person I never knew I could.  I've also learned that if you have the fundamental qualities in your mate, the simple but necessaries (e.g., love, forgiveness, willingness to forgive and ask for forgiveness, willingness to put the other person's feelings and needs above yours) then you're really okay.  It's the personality conflicts, the fighting over the remote, the miscommunication, the little annoyances, etc. that are the bitches to work through...but you both have to be willing to work, be it on your own (like I did here) or with your partner.  That's how I see it for me, at least.  If you're reading this, I love you Derek.

      You know what irks me?  Females who call me "sweetie" and are shorter than me and/or younger than me or within my age by 5 years.    Can. Not. Stand. That.  What else is giving me a good irk?  Last night's Extreme Makeover where the nerdy dude was required to eat large quantities of food and strength train so he could gain "good" weight.  How much do you want to bet he didn't have to do a lot of, if any, cardio?  Lucky bastard.  If all I had to do was strength train and eat every 2-3 hours, some of the food including anything I desire, I would be satisfied.  Promise.  mmhm.  Yeah, right.  I'd still be bitching and playing the mind games.  gah.  I feel bad ending this without something positive or funny.  Sorry, can't think of anything.  I wish someone would walk by and fart and then get really embarassed or something.  That would make me laugh.  You too, I would hope.

      Thank you for my pink roses, Derek.  They are gorgeous!  What a wonderful surprise and reminder that someone half way across the globe loves and cares about me.  Okay, I was reluctant to post the somewhat boring story you're about to read, but I need to get it out of my system because it's bothering me.  Like I said yesterday, I got a call on my cell phone about a delivery from a local florist (2 calls, one voicemail).  When I called back the lady who would be making the delivery, I asked if they could just take it to my apartment when I got home (Apparently they don't take into account that people who get flowers may be at work during, oh say 7:30am to 4pm and can't really be home during the day at their delivering convenience).  The lady said they stop delivering by the time I get off of work, so they would just have to take them to where I work.   Okay, two problems with that: 1--Who wants to get a nice bouquet of flowers at work and then lug the things back home so they could enjoy them there?  Not me.  2--I work in one of the umpteen bazillion buildings on a Navy base and I only know a weird, complicated way of getting to my building, which doesn't have a big address number or department sign on it.  How the heck am I supposed to tell a florist how to get to a building that I don't even know the appropriate number for?  Plus, she has to get a special visitor's pass to get into this commune (it really does feel like that...off topic, anyways...).  It all appeared to be a big hassle and then it escalated into a bigger one.  The lady couldn't find my building according to where I told her it was and ended up having some other lady call me to ask me the same damn question.  I told her the department name, didn't have a clue as to the building number, and when I went to find someone to ask, they had all left because it was 4pm.  So, now I realize that I am staying here past my specified number of work hours to receive a delivery that was supposed to bring me joy and surprise when in fact it was starting to do the opposite.    I left one detail out so far.  The lady who worked on base who was trying to help this delivery lady find out where I was was a real bitch.  She talked down to me.  Example:  "this lady has been all over the place...why don't you know where your building is?...are you a student?".  The last comment put me over the edge.  No, I'm  not  a fucking student.  I probably make more damn money than you do and sure as hell have a more impressive job than your filing ass does (totally inappropriate, but need to vent).  I know this is totally a pride thing and I'm going to assume that the only reason she asked if I was a student is because the florist knew that these flowers were supposed to be a congratulations for graduating kind of thing and told the bitch lady that.   But, really, who has EVER liked to be referred to or categorized as a student (code word for child)?  It's associated with immaturity, naivity, not adult, being subpar.  I've always despised this, even as a child and I have always made a conscious effort to treat kids, teens, etc. with respect and as much equality as is appropriate.    Anyways, after a bunch of funky directions about where I was located and waiting outside for 10 minutes, I got my flowers.  The bitch drove the delivery lady here and what was the first thing out of her mouth?  "Sara (I guess we're on a first name basis now), you really need to find out where you work, honey.  We even got the CO involved to find out where you were (OH my gah...I really give a fuck  now  lady...)".  The delivery lady was quite pleasant, just had me sign something and then she hopped back in the truck and they were on their way...except for about 40 other comments that the bitch kept throwing out.    Biggest problem I have with the whole scenario?  That I, ME, SARA...had to apologize for MY gift.  It's like the bitch wouldn't leave until I said something.  I shouldn't have to apologize for a situation that could have been resolved had the florist taken my suggestion and delivered the shit to my apartment (leave them on the doorstep for goodness' sake) or have me pick them up when I get off work.  Anyways, I let the whole thing control my emotions and decided to be pissy for the rest of the afternoon.  Pretty student of me, huh?

      Well, I'm lucky that a lot of people do, but why the recent shout out?  I just got a call from a florist (on my cell phone which is kind of weird, but whatever) trying to find out where I am so they could make a delivery.  For ME!!  Thank you in advance to this thoughtful wonderful person who is totally to blame for my goofy, happy, feel like I used to on Christmas Eve when I was little mood.  *jiggin*  Who are you? hmmmmm...you know my cell phone number, so that means it's...anyone I know.  that's right.  we'll see. we'll see.

      Every Friday I go through the same thought process about what I'm going to eat.  It dawned on me that I have similar thoughts about church.  I start off by thinking,   "you know what, I would love a good ole fresh salad for my Friday lunch"   ("or a good ole Sunday sermon"...on a Sunday)   "...I'm going to pick any fast food place I want and try one of these new fangled salads I hear about all the time, but haven't actually experienced...the new McDonald's Fiesta Salad?  Wendy's Spinach Chicken?  Arby's Asian style?..."   ("I'm going to pick any church I want...maybe even try a different denomination...Unitarian Universalist? Baptist? Catholic?...)   The thoughts continue and go from wanting to try something new and exciting to getting overwhelmed and realizing that I really don't want a friggin salad, I'm just trying to play the damn thing up so I'll eat what I deem a healthy lunch....or I don't want to get my ass up on Sunday and go to church so that I'll feel "spiritually healthy".    I have such a weirdness with these two things and it's bizarre how similar my thinking is about actually experiencing them.  I recognize salads as a common health food.  Since I was a child I associated salad with diet.  I've evolved into a "healthy eating" mentality rather than using the  diet  word, but I still find that I have this thing with salads.  I know they're good for me, and whenever I'm trying to eat healthy, I think I have to throw a salad up in the mix (no pun intended).  I also realize that I don't  have  to eat the bloody things in order to be healthy.  Same thing with going to church.  Since I was young (even to this day, thanks to Granny) I have been influenced into thinking that going to church is good for you, and you  have  to do it to be spiritually healthy.   Well, I have news people: I can eat other veggies and I can be spiritual in other ways as well.  You'd think that I hate the taste of salads or that I hate going to church.  I actually like both of these things...  It's so weird, I know.

      Has anyone ever wondered how all Target's have that distinct odor?  Is it a special wax they put on the floor, or are all of their products made of the same kind of smelly plastic?  I don't know, but if that aroma could be captured in a aerosol spray can, I think I would douse my apartment with essence-o-retail.  It's not a flowery or mountain/spring/rainy fresh fragrance, but inhaling it when I first walk into the store always puts me in a good mood.  My creative juices start flowing in that place, as well as some other juices when I realize how relatively cheap and cool the housewares are.  This is definitely a Target Friday.

      Have you ever been so immersed in such a stereotypical environment or situation that it took all you had not to laugh?  The step class I encountered this afternoon deserves to have the quotes relived.  Just to bring you up to speed, this guy that played the role of instructor came off very gracious, eloquent, committed, and feminine.  I liked him from the start.  Little did I know that it would get better.  I have never witnessed so much passion and arm tension in the warm-up deep breath than I did with this guy.  His eyes were closed and energy was exuded from the very beginning.  I felt like a dork for snickering, but you would too if you heard passionate cries of  "thuper" "it's time to get serious about fitness" "oh yeaaaaaah" "do you believe?  I believe"  What a guy.  That is exactly the kind of "motivation" (yes, I still hate the word, but will use it anyways because I want to go to bed and am too lazy to bust out dictionary.com...) I needed for my afternoon workout. His awesome techno music ended  at the exact moment that our 45 minute step routine did...that tells me the dude was prepared, has a lot of experience, and the kind of pep he displayed during the workout showed that he loved his job.  Well more than just the techno music told me that (e.g., explanation of warm up, cool down, and correct form throughout), but I thought it was pretty cool that he timed his music in accordance with the lengthy routine.    Do you ever try to impress the aerobics instructor by trying to catch on quickly or doing the movements exactly like they do them?    Who  needs attention?  Oh riiiight.  whatever, it feels good. Alright, drunkass, go to bed.

      It is done.  I have a Master's degree.  My presentation rocked.  My celebratory steak/potato/green bean/red wine dinner rocked harder.  Although, the portabella mushrooms I grilled had to be thrown out because I am still not over my mushroom eating fear.  Anyways, I feel better than ever.  I just wish I could've called up Derek to share my happiness with him.  Thank God for email and digital cameras.  I don't actually have a digital camera yet, but I plan on getting one soon.  Anyone know of any good/user friendly ones for $200 or less?

      My new goal is to start having more positive and accepting thoughts about my body.  I'm sick of never being satisfied with how I look, always obsessed about what I eat (whether good or bad), and too concerned about what others think.  I admit that I am one of the weirdos that obsesses over celebrities' bodies.  It's not an overt thing, nor am I glued to every tv show or magazine article that shows off these what I apparently think is ideal bodies,  it's something more subconscious than that.  Those Jennifer Aniston and Sarah Jessica Parker images stay in the back of my mind and I am starting to become more aware of how I have shaped their thighs and abs and shoulders into what I want to look like.  Here's the breakthrough I had today...  It's true I think some of these women represent beauty and it's also true that their bodies are thinner/leaner/more toned than the average gal in the city.  Eventhough they are what I consider beautiful, I also think slightly heavier or softer, less toned women are beautiful.  I can strive to look however I want, but damn it...I look good now.  I am not especially bony or as toned as some of these women, but I am healthy and I am on the lower end of healthy weight for my height and age.  I would rather be thin, eating more of the stuff that I want while working out regularly in peace versus thinner, more toned, working my ass off to eat the right foods and work out hard enough to sculpt my "ideal" body.  Life is too freaking short.  I am thin...enjoy it damn it.  I think somewhere there is this thought I that I need to work hard to get what I want ALL the time.  While it's true that even maintaining my size now isn't a piece of cake, it sure does allow for more flexibility than what it would take to imitate these women's body parts.  Maybe it'll happen one day, but you can bet your bottom dollar it will be out of default.  This would happen because I up my exercising for fun or change some of my food choices out of enjoyment.   FUN.  ENJOYMENT.   Get it?    However, this does not give me free reign to ice cream up every night and forget about exercising, but it does allow me to enjoy drinking a real coke every once in a while without being ridden with guilt and anxiety.  Even if I were to be hardcore with eating right and exercising, I don't think it would make that much of a visual difference, unless I decided to bodybuild (not gonna happen).  Yeah, I may be more svelt, but the cost benefits analysis tell me that I ain't willing to spend that much for a benefit that is minimally visual.

      I'm making the final touches on my Power Point presentation for tomorrow.  I have to give like an hour long show on what I did/learned from my internship to a bunch of faculty and whatever students that show up.  Sort of like a defense, but not as intimidating.  My slides look good, but I haven't run through the damn thing to make sure I'm expanding enough beyond the content of each slide.  One thing I'm grateful for that I've learned in this educational fiesta is how to nail a PP presentation.  I know how to make the slides pretty and how to  explain  the slides rather than read straight off of them like a chump.  I cannot  stand  when people do that...what is the point of giving a presentation yo?  Other than that, the only exciting thing going on is Derek is on his way to the Middle East.  He's been traveling from plane to plane since Sunday afternoon, and I finally got a chance to talk to him this morning.  He's extremely jet lagged and ready to get over there so his 90 days can start.  Can you believe that the actual deployment days don't start until after he gets there?  Balls.  I'm okay, though.  Broke out my Season 4 Sex in the City DVDs and box-o-Franzia last night.  Good times.

      Until recently I have always been a beer girl.  A cheap one at that, and I'm talking about the beer clever one.  Bud light, Keystone light (thanks to Derek), and when it's a fancy occasion...a Corona with a bunch of lime.  BUT...  Apple martinis are now my new look forward to drink.  I've never had a bad one, and I finally broke down and bought all the mixins at my new drinking Mecca...the one, the only...Richey's East.  It's beautiful in there.  All the colors, all the nicely organized liquor, wine, and beer aisles totally make my mouth water.  I rarely spend less than 20 mintues or 30 dollars each time I go, which seems to be a lot lately.  I just love it and I also love adding to my liquor collection on top of the fridge.  I don't think I would feel right unless I made an official announcement.    Attention all boozers and boozettes...I would like to announce the newest members of the Boozeland family: Midori Melanie, Apple Pucker Tucker, Grey Goose Gretta, and little Shiniqua sweet n sour.    Now, only if I could pass the stuff off as gatorade in a martini glass at work, I would be set.  What?  you think you can drink a martini, even a flavored martini in anything other than a martini glass, be it plain clear glass or one with a zig zag colored stem?  I don't think so, Tim.  That's like drinking wine out of a canteen or smoking a bowl out of a toilet paper roll lined with foil.  Not that I've ever done  either  of those things before.  TGIF, TGFAM, TGSSU.*   *Thank God It's Friday, Thank God for Apple Martinis, Thank God Sara's Shutting Up

      The fact that there is only one womens restroom where I work is a good thing and a gross thing.  It's good because you have privacy and the walls are made of lead so no one hears anything (I have a phobia).  It ain't so good when you walk in and a dookie floater is swimming around just waiting for someone like me to gag and start bitching out loud.  Flush the fucking toilet fool.    May you have back splash for 1000 years.

      How's this for contradiction: I went to Subway for lunch today and apparently they're giving out one free cookie per customer in honor of tax day.  Exsqueeze me?  Baking Powder?    Aren't y'all the same people that made millions by advertising via Jared AND all of the Atkins friendly wraps and salads and shit?  Well, how about a cookie to spoil all of that hard dieting work because, hell, it's tax day and we could  all  use a cookie to make us feel better about paying a buttload of money as a result of forgetting to actively vote and allowing these vegetable head politicians to come into office.  Something about endorsing emotional eating?  Something about once I fall of the wagon once, my face is nashing through the dirt for a good couple of weeks?  Subway, eat dirty balls.  ...but thank you for having Baked Cool Ranch Doritos.

      I hate the word  motivation .  I hate the feeling of being inarticulate.  I hate feeling like I have to over clarify on MY blog that relatively few people read, if any.  I also love to over clarify.  I also love the feeling of  fresh  motivation, but I hate when I over analyze where it comes from and attempt to store that reasoning into my head just in case I need it in the future. I also like to also repeat words when writing ...like  also .  Reading back over my blog posts I find that there are lots of repeats.. really really  is a common one.  The repetition doesn't occur one after the other, but they fall close enough together where it's noticeably amateur, or endearing as I prefer to perceive it.  Damn.  This is exactly the kind of venting I needed.  Your patience is appreciated.

      Last night was the Kid Rock concert.  Derek and I hadn't even made it to our seats before the mullet count made it to 12.  We just figured there were too many to keep track of.  That was definitely the most crowded concert I've been to in the last month, which sucked.  I think I've just lost my concert fever so I wasn't as tolerant of the normal crowd and rowdiness one can expect from a rock concert, especially a Kid Rock concert.  There were pole dancers for cryin out loud.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, it was just a little creepy when they danced to the slow songs.  They weren't that great...I could've done better.  Wait...why do I care?  Because that's what I do with anything that has to do with dancing.  I obsess and wait around until I find a dancer that I can outperform.  Granted, I haven't danced in nearly 3 years, but I  know  how to perform.    Okay I'm grossing myself out.    I'm in a shitty mood and am dreading my weekend.  I hate that I have to spread my time out with friends and boyfriend.  I just wish Derek and I had the same friends or that he actually liked mine.  Oh well, I guess this happens to a lot of couples.  I hate it.

      Have you ever met the girl who prides herself on being "a bitch"?  Well, I work with her.  The information came up when we went to go order office supplies here on base.  She was telling me some ghetto story about how she met her current boyfriend outside a club parking lot where he almost ran into her with his car.  At some point during the caustic tale she imitated the dialogue between her and her soon to be boyfriend, and made it very clear that  she  wasn't taking any crap from this guy who had the "audacity" to almost run into her "hahaha".    Way to be dude.  I'm leaving out other fabulous stories from said co-worker, but uh, it is clear that she is one of the self-proclaimed.  Apparently these kind of women get the kind of attention fix that they need in order to act this way and carry around a false sense of bravado.    urlLink Katrina Campins  from The Apprentice put into words exactly how I feel about this:  "Life is too short to be a bitch" .  It really is.  I know we all get cranky, I know that some people have been walked all over in the past and are trying to make up for it.  I also understand that the day and age that we live in is trying to counteract the historical suppression of women, but come  on .  Think before you speak and only let the catty bitch out of the box in emergency situations.   Emergency  being the operative word.  So if you know someone who is this way, stop encouraging them for goodness' sake.    Crack open a box of Franzia and relax.

      You know, there is nothing like stuffing your face with a fresh pineapple.  I bought my first whole pineapple at Sam's on Friday and have been enjoying the hell out of eating that thing all week.  It's messy and somewhat of a pain to cut, but if you're a pineapple freak like me, the juice all over your kitchen is worth it.  yumbalina.

      I was reading over some of my past entries and realized that I have a whole lotta filling in to do for anyone who is interested.  So, in no particular order...  1. Derek is now leaving for  3  months instead of 2. : ( 2. I got a portable mp3 player, season 5 of Sex and the City DVDs, and the       Bob Marley Legends CD from Derek for my b-day. 3. I am a 2nd year graduate student working on my Master's in Psychology      (Industrial-Organizational...not a shrink).  I am done with all of my course      work and am currently working at a naval base as a contractor.  This is a      real job, but the 1st 3 months counted toward my internship requirements      to obtain my degree.  If all goes well, I will graduate May 1.  After that I will      continue my current job until I crave change, which I predict will be within      one year. 4. I have been following my workout contract like a champ and cannot wait for      my pedicure reward.  I also have really been into my workouts the past 2      days. 5. I am still not used to the time change and am dragging ass.  Okay, folks.  That's all I could round up for now.    I do have one more thing to say:  I wish I could have comments and I wish I could figure out how to get that post border out of the archive list.  New blogger frustrations.  I'll figure it out eventually.  Oh yeah...sorry about the gargantuan post title.  I braved the template coding for an hour yesterday and still couldn't get that damn thing to deflate.

      I found a pic of  urlLink Carrie  from Sex and the City wearing the style of dress I was talking about.  Apparently since I am a free user on blogspot, I can't upload images.  This will soon change, but until then I have to force you to do the linky dink clicking.  Go to slide 8.  Oh yeah, obviously you have to turn 24 in order to figure out that there is a setting where you can add titles  and  set your posting clock to the  correct  time zone (central instead of pacific ...and schwoops).  neat.

       :they say it's your birthday:   Thank you, thank you...I have only just begun my 24th year on this earth and am still in a good mood.  I  could  reflect the last year, hell I could even bitch about getting old, but I don't feel like doing either of those things.  All I know is that 24 is young and it feels just as right as turning 23 did.  I love birthday day (redundancy acknowledged)!  I went shopping on my lunch break and bought the cutest birthday shirt ever.  I would attach a picture, but I can't find the brand on the internet anywhere ("unthinkable" is the brand...I think ;)).  Consequently, I will use my magical written descriptive powers.  Here goes: Did you watch season 4ish (can't remember which one) of Sex and the City?  Did you see all of the little Juicy Couture shirts/dresses SJParker was wearing while trying to hide her real life pregnancy?  Thought so...looks like that.  If you did not have the privelage of seeing season 4ish or don't ever watch the series, the shirts that I am talking about look like elastically gathered tube tops with flowing material at the bottom.  If long enough, one can wear it as a dress, but mine is definitely too short for that and will be worn as a shirt with jeans.  It's white with tasteful buttery-golden flowers and shouts  "springy! yellow! it's your birthday!" , if shirts could talk, that is.    I love it when I have these lucky kind of purchase experiences.  You know, the ones that make you feel confident because the piece looks good on, off, and the money spent is worth it.  This particular shirt was 43 bones.  It even makes me feel better knowing that I spent more than what I normally do on summer shirts.  Birthday indulgence...it's a beautiful thing.

       :schwoops:   Okay, must sweat off guilty weird feelings I have from a recent conversation with my boss.  First, I must throw out that I have had relatively NOTHING to do at work since finishing my internship paper.  My supervisor made a comment at a group lunch a couple of weeks ago about how busy he is and so I chose to leave him alone, which I'm very confident is a good decision.  I'm sure he'll dump a bunch o crap on me soon when things let up for him.  Anyways, he just came into my office, and informed me that I was giving a somewhat dangerous amount of confidential documents to some of the people I train at work.  I didn't even think about these documents turning up missing because I trust the people I train (not that they did).  Okay, yeah that's a little naive now that I read the sentence, but shit, I hate that I had to be told and sort of reprimended for something very important to the work that my department has put forth in the last year.  I also hate it that my neglect was discovered in front of 5 naval officers...one who signs my paycheck more or less.  shit. shit. shit.    Not a big deal...I'm an "intern", right?  Luckily my supervisor is rational and confronted me in a non-threatening way, but my guilt and quasi-shame makes be feel like a real chump.   I feel better now.  I just think that if I was busier and felt like I contributed more to my job, then crap mistakes like that wouldn't happen as much.  gah.

       :overnight tires:   I've been reading the  urlLink Skinny Daily Post  off and on since I found it in January.  If you are a health eduaddicted person like me then I highly recommend taking a peek at it for the posts and links.    After reading a few posts and overcoming another indulgent weekend, I am motivated to get back into the gym and start off my 24th year with a healthy start.  Well, it's not really a start considering I've been watching food and increasing exercise since the last week of January, but it is a change from my lapse last week.    For the record, I felt like crap!  I ate weird combos of junk food and got annoying back aches from sitting in my chair, watching TV from the time I got home from work to the time I went to bed.  My apartment is still wrecked and clothes have yet to be washed.  The worst part of it all was the enormous guilt I felt daily for not doing anything.  ick ick ick.    BUT...  According to Skinny Daily, it's important to focus on the positives/strengths instead of the worst things that happened.  So let's.  -that was the first week I have lapsed since starting this health kick the last week of Jan. (what is that...2 months? very good for me) -i drank my water at work -i turned in my internship paper (not really health related, but it's a positive for the week) -my body still looks the same (no waking up only to see extra belly build-up) -i ate veggies most days of the week  Okay, that was kind of hard, but it was  good  stuff and I need to remember that the whole week wasn't a waste.  Also remember... 'It's not failure unless you give up' .  Well, I surely am  not  ready to give up.  I'd have to be really depressed or extremely busy to even think about giving up and I am neither of those things.  I love how I feel when I'm health-conscious and I intend to keep at it.   With that said, I'll go with old faithful: Reward system.        So here's the contract :  I will work out with weights and do cardio (30 min) at my gym 3 days this week.  I will do cardio for 30-45 minutes for 2 days I am not doing strength training.  If I follow this plan between Monday and Saturday, I can have a pedicure this weekend.   *Bonus*: If I work out the day after the Kid Rock concert (Friday), I can buy all of the fixings to make a key lime martini (vanilla vodka, lime juice, pineapple juice).  I can so do this.

       :so now we have titles:   Fabulous Friday to all of you.  I decided not to pleasure the masses with a blog post yesterday because feeling sorry for myself really seemed like a much better option.    pms week was apparently in one of its higher concentrations.  I'll spare the selfish, ice cream overdosed details, because I am now experiencing the "it's finally a freaking better day mood change".  Whenever I get into a depressive, well more like a feeling sorry for myself with no logical justification state, I always fear that I won't be able to snap out of it for a long time.  At one point in my life I didn't snap out of it for nearly 3 months.  But, here I am, on the road back to perky-land.  I also am in the mood to get back into my workout (oops, rebelled this week) and rid my apartment of bacteria.   Announcement:   24 years sorta wise in 4 days.  24 in 4...whoodeewho.  It's one of my favorite months, people.  The month of my birthday, my boyfriend's birthday, and spring.  La lala LA!  It's just one of those refreshing months, even with the anticipated rain.  Okay, so other than my glorification of April and a sparing of pms grouchy week, I have made a decision.  I am going to tell my boyfriend what my web address is for my blog so he can read it.  I'm doing this for one purposeful reason, and one experimental reason.  The purposeful reason is that he is being deployed for 2 months and I don't know how much we'll get to communicate on the phone, and this is a chance for him to stay up to date on what is going on in my life.  The experimental reason is that I think this will give him further insight to who I am and how I think.  It is not a complete representation of who I am, just as how I behave and what I say around other people is not complete either.  However, it is interesting to have this somewhat public approach to journaling and I think depending on the nature of two people's romantic relationship, for example, and their personalities, this could be a positive supplement to the closeness that they share.    On the other hand...hehmmmm...I do understand that certain entries can be misunderstood.  That's the simple way of saying it.  That's why this is an experiment for which I am going to accept the consequences for, good or bad.  I also have the power in what I choose to write...and if you blog, you, like me, probably do not disclose everything because you have to maintain some privacy.  This blog entails maybe 1% of what happens to me, 1% of my thoughts, and maybe 3% of my personality...and those are generous estimates.    So, now that I've written about a topic that has probably been beaten to death on many blogs, I will now profess my love for Bluebell light Vanilla ice cream.   LaaaaalalaLAaAaAa  (like my vibrato?)!!   I never was a vanilla girl until the last year or so.  I always wanted to try the most complicated mixture of flavors in an ice cream growing up and I think I neglected the dreamy creaminess of vanilla over  chocamochacinnachipberrymoosebutter swirl  in a chocolate sprinkled dip cone.  Now a simple plain vanilla cone will do me just fine. yumdidley.   Oh gosh...is this symbolic for my life? I mean I  have  used the same facial moisturizer in the last 2 years and bitch anyone out if they try and get me to try another brand.  uh, hullo, the shit works good.  Naw, I still buy a different brand of bread at the store each week.  My need for change and originality still exists.  Plain vanilla I am not.  whew.

      How can I manage to get stressed out by a vacation?  I'm supposed to be going home to Dallas tomorrow all the way through Tuesday, and as usual I'm ready, but dreading it all at the same time.  There's always a checklist of must-do's I must complete (e.g., visit grandmother for breakfast with mom either Sat. or Sun., visit other grandmother so to prevent giant guilt trip to follow, do girly things with mom, go out with friends and drink into oblivion).  That shit is hard to time out.  It's especially hard to do all of the family related stuff when drunk time takes place the night before.    So, what do I want?  I want to be with my Mom.  That's it.  I want to go shopping and cook and talk and laugh with one of the most wonderful people I know and love.  I also am limited by money so I know that if I go out drinking I'll spend way more than intended and won't have anything left to do what I want to do, except for a ginormous headache.  Isn't that crappy?  I remember the days of the $10.00 beer nights.  That's all I would spend!  and I would be lit up like a Christmas tree!  Now top shelf liquor and fancy drinks have taken the place of poor bud light brew, as well as a sickening tolerance to pour more down my throat.  I'm an alcohol whore.    I know, I'm bitching about things that a lot of people don't have (fam/friends who love them...not the booze tolerance), but I'm sick of going home and always being on the move or trying to meet up with everyone.  It was okay when I was a student, but these are precious vacation days, and I will use them how I see fit.  I'll probably change my mind when I'm there, but for now...ME!

      I have looked inside myself.  I know how to pick myself up when I am down, but  dammit -  Can a girl get a break?  I'm sick of picking myself up...finding the inner-strength-in-me poop.  It worked great for many years, but I need someone to lean on for a minute --  Just someone to tell me what to do and make it sound good.  Ya know?  Sometimes I feel like I've been the one responsible for making me happy for so long that it's hard to take other people's suggestions to heart.  Is that bad?  Is that good?  It depends a lot on the person handing out the well-if-I-were-you's.  I'm exaggerating much of this whine session, btw.  Gotta vent.  Speaking of vent, it is so flipping hot in my car on the way home from work.  Flippin  hot.  Really, how is one expected to unwind when drenched in Stanza Marinade?

      I'm so ready to go home to DFW on Friday.  Work has been stressful in last 2 weeks in a good way, except for today.  I feel a little overwhelmed, but I know that I'll come out of it okay when I break ground on this never ending project of mine.    I talked on the phone with Derek today, and that definitely lifted my spirits.  I love how 10 minutes of talking with someone you care about can get you out of a mood de funk.  I need to talk or express myself or something.  It gets old living in your head for too long.  I'm not really sad or depressed, it's more of a mix of mental restlessness and physical sluggishness (am I starting to make up words?  neat ).  JD says I should read more.  I agree...I think that allows your mind to use new areas for focusing.  ooo, sidetrack for a minute...the new Wilson Phillips "Go Your Own Way" cover just came on  urlLink Launchcast Radio .  I'm so digging this song.  When I hear their sound, it relaxes me and takes me back to the days of crispy mall bangs and Malibu Musk.  I used to drown myself in that horrid perfumed body spray.  ahh, the memories.  Well, back to ground breaking.

      It's amazing how much fresh flowers, some cheap wine in appealing packaging, and fresh herbs can add to a Monday night dinner.  I'm hitting up Walmart on Mondays more often.  They had bundles of roses that were priced half off and fully stocked produce, which was not the case when I went on Saturday.    Such a pleasant evening.  I made a potato salad with hotdog links ( urlLink Everyday Italian  on  urlLink Food Network ), baked cinnamon apples, and a salad with that left over  urlLink lime-toasted cumin-cilantro vinaigrette  that I made last  urlLink Thursday .  So pleasant.  I'm finding this cooking kick to be so therapeutic and satisfying.    Join me!  Share your recipes : )

      I just got out of a presentation/discussion that summed up everything that I had been working on  urlLink last week .  All I really had to do for the hour was just sit there while my boss did the talkin'.  I wasn't responsible for interpreting the stats in lay terms, just sit, smile, and shake hands with the military men.  So why did I feel this overwhelming amount of pressure and anxiety in the middle of the presentation/discussion?  It's worth mentioning that dizziness occurred, just to give you a glimpse of the feeling.  I can justify for days why this emotional hee-haw took place, but I can't guarantee that it won't happen again.  So much of it comes from intimidation and a desire to be up-to-speed.  Although I worked my  ass  off on the stat info, I couldn't tell you what the significance or insignificance or confidence interval of blahblahbloy if you asked.  Now if someone else explained, I could go along with a basic understanding, but I only feel like I truly know something if I am approached and am able to verbalize at least a summary.  And to top all that off, I'm getting the zits. On my back, on my chin, etc.  What?  am I 15 now?  My mom used to tell me that I would stop getting freckles and zits when I grew into my twenties.  um hi, mom.  Thanks for playing.  I need some funny.  I haven't cracked up in a while.  Your donations are appreciated.

      I just wrote a long, link detailed specific entry about my cooking ventures this past week.  Damn it, I listed everything out that my friend JD and I had been making off of the  urlLink food network  with recipe links, but nooooooooooooo, this new blogger crap didn't let me navigate back after previewing so I could edit.   So, sorry y'alls, I ain't gonna do the links again, but I will list the yummy foods.   Thursday:   Sara's yummy baked honey garlic chicken tenderloins Tomato-avocado salad w/lime-toasted cumin-cilantro vinaigrette dressing Corn on the cob w/garlic butter and melted cotija cheese   Sat:   Pasta primavera   Sunday brunch:   Challah french toast Spinach-feta quiche Mixed fruit w/fresh mint and wine sauce Cafe au lait ( urlLink N.O. 's style  urlLink Community Coffee )  I totally indulged, but really all the stuff was basically healthy.  Lots of olive oil, lots of fresh fruits and veggies, no preservatives (except the cheese), lots of fresh herbs, lots o' yum.  I'm scared of my gym.  Does anyone else get that way?  I'm going back to my home workout.

      Things have finally picked up at work and this girl is exhausted.  I have made sweet, spanky love to MS Excel, SPSS, and MS Power Point in the last 2 days.  Don't tell those three I said this, but I'm almost positive that I was doing most of the work.     *smokes 3 cigarettes*   I have really enjoyed being this busy.  I think I've enjoyed it more so because I have decided that I shall don a new job title from now on.  Instead of the lame "Applications Analyst" that I'm referred to by my current company, I now prefer nothing other than:   Data Diva .  I went back and forth between that and Data Cosmetologist, Power Point Princess, XXXcel Bitch, and many others.  This is by far my fav.  Please excuse my dear aunt sally while this diva does sushi w/JD & Michelle.  Toodles.

      What is so significant about the number  887 ?  It's the amount of debt dollars I will be adding to my credit card balance because Stanley the Stanza has decided to stop radiating, alternating, and engine mounting. Boo hiss.  Nothing like setting back my paying off of debt schedule by oh say...6 months.  It's also great to know that I'm spending about the same price on the car as its lower end of the  urlLink kelly blue book  worth.    I'm not a happy camper to say the least.    This weekend was chalk full of events.  First of all, I decided to meet up with a girlfriend of one of Derek's friends that is with him in Afghanistan for a girl's night out on Saturday.  I had a great time.  I have only talked to her (Amanda) a few times and hung out with her one time before at my apartment, but we decided to do Ft. Walton big drunk style on Saturday and I like the girl.  Why don't I tell you a story to explain the events of the evening.  Once upon a time there were 2 lonely twenty-somethings who were overworked and missing their soldier men half way across the globe.  They decided to have a relaxing girl's night out of Mexican food and head sized margaritas followed by wine, cigarettes, and TV at one of the girl's boyfriend's condo.  While the night started out with lots of laid back "damn this is some bomb ass queso" and sad "I miss my boyfriend" random girly chit chat, it could not have prepared the girls for how the night would unfold.  Said twenty-somethings stopped at the local Food World following copious amounts of cheesy fried beans, tortillas, and meat intake to pick out a nice 86 gallon bottle of Merlot. They finished that.  They smoked Marlboro and Camel lights, they talked more about boyfriends, they got drunk.  They got locked out of the condo.    Huh?  Yes, they were locked between the sliding glass door of the condo leading to the porch and a locked iron gate.  Picture an averaged sized jail cell then cut it in half -- that was the extent of the space.  Did they have keys? No. Cell phones? No. Cigarettes and Booze?  Hell yes and thank the Lord.  Otherwise some serious freaking out would have resulted rather than the trying to calm oneself so as to not make the other person see the true internal hysterics doing the jig.  How were these two drunken broads saved?  By the friendly car full of pothead bros, of course.  As it turns out, one of the girls left the front door of the house unlocked, so the girls figured if they could wave someone outside down and have them come in the condo and unlock the sliding glass door from the inside, all would be well.  And it was, my friend, it was.    The doobie brothers came to the girl's rescue, didn't display any scary or intimidating behavior, and quickly jaunted off to their next destination: bowl.  To sum up the rest because that was basically the part worth writing about, the girl's get carried away by the adrenaline of the situation, take a few chocolate cake shots, and head out for a late night of clubbing.  Copious amounts of shots, mixed drinks, and beer follow.    Sunday morning consisted of a hangover headache as big as the margarita's consumed the night before and Taco Bell  urlLink Cheesy Gordita Crunch  consumption while watching The Olsen twin's E! True Hollywood Story(minus the hangover headache, all in this sentence is highly recommended,  highly ).   Then my car fucks up on the way home.  And I have to ride 45 minutes with the tow truck driver that reeks of onion b.o. $887.00 later, I realize that one exciting freak out per weekend just isn't enough.  There are rules, apparently.    THE END.

      Good morning, all.  I love sleeping in on a Saturday, even if it's just until 9am.  My day is jam packed with chores. I have to get Chez Sara, Body Sara, and Maxx, dog of Sara, shining like the top of the Chrysler Building!  And then I have to make my Broadway debut as Annie.

      So I go to the beach and it's windier than all get out.   Not  a pleasant afternoon. And?  I hate kites.  I was trying to soak up windy rays, but could not tame my tension with the buzzing that was coming from this bird shaped calico kite flying not far from my head.  I mean, really, what is so great about kites?  I hate 'em.  In fact, I don't have any happy memories flying them as a child.  I do remember having this homemade brown grocery bag that my mom made me fancy into a kite and decorate with yarn and crayola art, only to take it out on a non-windy day and run around like the dorky 9 year old I was to try and get it to go up.  Not fun memories.  There were string tangling problems, too.  So there you have it, folks.  My supposed to be spontaneous, relaxing day at the beach turned into a discrimination against the guy to my right's hobby for flying a stupid piece of nylon on a string.  Oh yeah, and he had the damn thing set up next to him where he wasn't even looking at it.  I mean, I would at least see there being a point in looking at a colorful blend of shapes in the air, but not the way he had it set up like a pet.  A  noisy  pet might I add.  Again, the point of kites?  Stupid.  Even more so if you were one of those unlucky kids that had to make them crafty-style with a brown paper bag.   P.S. Is it just me or does anyone else think that this chick is moody?

      Why am I so tired?  Jeez.  I feel like I just stayed up at a 4th grade slumber party, ran 8 miles without water, and came to work.  I think I need to get back into my workout routine, or any workout for that matter.  I never believed anyone that said exercising gives you energy until I was actually in a routine of waking up, going to work, coming home, and working out.  My college years never provided consistency as far as sleeping the same amount of hours every night and waking up/going to bed around the same time, so when I did exercise I was never aware of the "energy" benefits.  I also napped like it was nobody's business back then.  So now that I do believe the energy theory, I need to get to stair steppin'.  Holy!  This just in: They're letting us out of work four, I repeat FOUR hours early today.  Enough blogging for today.  To the beach!

      So yeah, I haven't updated in a while.  Why?  I am not going to use the "lazy" excuse because it doesn't apply this time, but I will use the "lack of inspiration" excuse.  I began blogging posts that touched on anything that was going through my mind at the time, then I tried to be creative.  Hence, pressure on a hobby.    It's hard when you put pressure on yourself.  So I won't anymore.  If I have suck posts then suck this.  With that, I will throw together a few random thoughts and experiences of mine in the last week.  - I am taking a break from drinking, until tonight. - I am eating healthy and am attempting to lose 10 lbs. (shutup if you think I should or shouldn't) until Derek comes back. - For me, orange tic-tacs are like potato chips for some: can't eat just one.  In my case, must eat the whole container's worth.  Who says orange-flavored anything should be put in the same class as mint or cinnamon breath fresheners?  It's candy, damnit, and should be in a Skittles sized package. - I started reading Nicholas Spark's "The Guardian" and am enjoying reading again in the way where I get lost in the book instead of my own random drunk monkey cognitions. - I realized that data entry is not that bad. - I realized that I like to play mind games in order to convince myself that certain areas of my life are not meaningless and boring. - I need meaning. - In everything. - Except alcohol consumption.  Alright, Trent, voila.  I'm back.

      Since I already consider Friday a part of the weekend, filling out surveys and sending them to friends replaces working.  Here's one of two I filled out today (thanks to  urlLink Joelle  for the meme.)  Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what  it says: --"based upon screening and testing, they are placed within a broad" (The  Bluejacket's Manual)  Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  --my office phone  What is the last thing you watched on TV? --Just the Ten of Us/Cops (I switched back and forth)  With the exception of the computer, what can you hear? --clock ticking  When did you last step outside? --5 minutes ago  Before you came to this website, what did you look at?  --www.tenth-muse.com  What are you wearing? --jeans, old Banana Republic tee-shirt with a rip in it (from moving C.  Brown into freshman dorm...caught it on the mini fridge), cheap wal-mart  rain coat with broken zipper, my kick ass fake snake skin shoes that are  almost dead, and one gold aggie ring.  and yes, I'm at work.  damn, i need  to go shopping.  Did you dream last night? --perhaps...can't remember.  When did you last laugh? --fake laughed about 3 hours ago; for real laughed last night (about 14 hrs.  ago) when watching 'Cops'.  What is on the walls of the room you are in? --clock, navy and air force pics of planes, an old x-ray light up box (my  office used to be a doctor's)  Seen anything weird lately? --last night I watched the 'Ferris Bueller' spin off (they were paying  tribute to the past "Friends'" tv appearances) with Jennifer Aniston.  --Not weird enough? How about a random crackhead approaching me in the dairy aisle at Winn Dixie and striking up a conversation about Charlize Theron's naked ass in the issue of 'The Enquirer' he was pushing up to my face. Maybe more scary than weird.  [note: this is not an exaggerated tale]  [note 2nd: I was not aware of the crackhead population in Pensacola.  We obviously have one.]  What do you think of this quiz? --it'll do the job.  What is the last movie you saw? --Under the Tuscan Sun  If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?  --a new car, a New York shopping spree for me and all my friends, love trip  for me and Derek, a total renovation for my parent's house, and a top of the  line digital camera.  Tell me something about you that I don't know: --I once had a fish named "Sweetie".  If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or  politics, what would you do? --uh...too hard.  next please.  Do you like to dance? --when drunk  George Bush is he a power-crazy nut case or some one who is finally doing  something that has needed to be done for years?: --blee bloo blar  Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?  --Grace  Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him? --Dude  Would you ever consider living abroad? --does that mean you think i'm fat?  bastard.

      Are there unspoken rules about blogger etiquette that I don't know about?  Should I be commenting or emailing all of the blog/journal sites that I frequent, especially when I want people to comment on my site?  I just feel weird if I don't know the person or haven't taken the time to review their archives to get a better feel for who they are.  Anyways, I have guilt and I would like to take a moment to recognize the few blogs that have impressed me and kept me glued to the monitor on more than one occasion.  If you guys ever read this or find this page somehow, thank you so much for the humor and inspiration.  I notice that the blogs that keep me interested are authored by witty, positive, grammatically correct individuals.  You all have something I can identify with as well, whether it's a thought, a life experience, or the way you develop a funny post.     UN:  I found  urlLink Ms. Shea  originally at  urlLink Lose the Buddha , her health and fitness blog.  Laughing my ass off continued way beyond seeing the title.  I more recently have been reading her jounal at  urlLink ejshea.com ... and the girl can write.  I like that I now find my internal dialogue muttering words such as "snarky, smarmy, and obfuscate".  Thank you, Erin, for challenging my vocab and for making me pull up  urlLink dictionary.com  every time I get on your website.  I don't know if I'll ever have a great purpose in emailing you except to sing your praises, and I hope that if the email doesn't ever come your way you won't be upset that I'm linking you in my sidebar.   DEUX:  I started reading  urlLink AB  (I know we've never met via internet or otherwise, but is it okay if I refer to you as "AB"?), um, last week I think.  I found her site through  urlLink Erin's , and if I'm not mistaken, I think they met through the online journaling world.  not for sure, but back to the praise.  This girl is funny.  Kick ass hair, articulately quirky (can I say that?), and talks about her little girl in ways that make me roll over in laughing histerics all the while wishing I'll be as cool a mom as her one day.  Go to  urlLink hashai.com .  do it.   TROIS:  And then there's  urlLink Joelle , who I've referred to on more than one occasion, my first blog (well, second if you include  urlLink Hollie's marathon  one up there...but that was more fitness related and is no longer updated) to be addicted to.  The woman holds her own.  She is funny, graceful, and sensitive.  I love what she has to say.  I also flipped the fuck out when I emailed her a yogurt review for her health blog,  urlLink Put Down the Donut , and she emailed me back.  I had star struck feelings, y'all.  nerd, but, whatever.  Joelle, if you read this one day, know that you had celebrity appeal to a goofy 24 year old blonde living in Florida.  So, during many random scanning-blog sessions...a single post here, a whole month archive review there, these are the 3 blogs that make me want to read the  whole  thing from start to finish.  My descriptions of these ladies do not do them justice.  Check them out for yourself and form your own opinion.  I just felt they deserved a little maxxipunk love, especially before I added them to my sidebar.

      Dave Matthews Band got on my ever-living/loving nerves as a 14-year-old or how ever old I was when Dave started making a name for himself on the pop charts in the mid-nineties.  I started listening to his words as of the year 2000 and have changed my views.  I have been to one concert (Derek, thank you), but I am in no way a major follower or sing-a-longer except for the occasional "Crash" or "Crush", which still do it for me, people.  Call it old or inexperienced or dork...i love those songs, lovED them, will love them.  I get these weird feelings, though, when an unfamiliar Dave song comes on.  Those of the wanting to fit into a college atmosphere and indi-ish appreciative variety.  I know, Dave is not indie. but, his music is distant enough from me that I drunkenly classify it as that and...  now that I realize I just said "Dave" more than once, I feel as though I never really got my insekar point across and I should just end it and maybe save it for live chitty chat with anyone that will listen.  It's always necessary to give a summary in my book, so here goes:  Dave Matthews Band music touches me, but for some or many personal (most likely ex-boyfriends of mine that liked his music) reasons I have bizarre-sentimental-detached-again, generally weird feelings when I hear one of the his or his band's songs come on.     Sober Update:   What the hell does the last sentence mean? "the his or his band's songs...?  Wait...it makes sense now. Leave out the 'the' and it works.  Fuck it, I'm still drunk.

      I really meant for the last post to touch on what I'm next going to talk about.  neat.  Here is the fabulous commentary that I felt needed to be added:  You know, American Idol is exciting because we get to recognize hints of professionalism amongst the amateur.  Yes, talent, blahbloo.  I know, but, you have to agree that there is something exciting about witnessing a seemingly professional vocal performance from an amateur, no one you or anyone you know has heard of.    Did you ever get that special cooky adrenaline at a high school talent show when the girl or boy would come out and present a voice that was vibrato-ing like no one else in 2nd period choir, and could hang with a Sarah M. or a Boys to Men? Looking back you may realize that they most likely could not have made a professional name for themself in the music industry, but damn it if they couldn't get that special rise out of you at the end-of-the-year talent show.    I think that's where Paula Abdul thinks she is at every fucking Idol competition.  I know the enticement of live music and smiley faces.  fortunately, I can proclaim the truth of talent from my cheap apartment viewing because I am removed from the live version and any other pressure of B-level judge celebrityism I am leaving out.  I think I'm due for another blog deletion session.  Bless those that are reading this entry before sober changes are made.  Love, Sara

      I know why Paula Abdul cried tonight... urlLink Fantasia Barrino  kicked ass.  I've decided (with much reluctance due to annoying interview behavior and 19 yr old Simon flirtations) that Fantasia should win the contest.    My pick should be a star.  She has touched me with her performance MultiPLe times and has passed the chill-bump test...exciting to see what will happen due to funky voting participation.  Don't know if that's the Franzia talking, but here is where the former comment comes from.  It seems as though the uproar with the bottom 3 American Idol contestants 2 weeks ago being the expected upper 3 was a total ?doinkhuhwha?.  Well, has ANYONE ever thought about the voting population?    Probably teeny.  probably boppers.  racist?  prolly (can't belIEVE I just said that word) not--only mention because of Elton John.  just the ones that have the passion and time to stay on the phone to vote.  I'll admit, I tried voting a few times, but way lost motivation/patience to stay on the phone long enough to make my vote count.  If I was 12-17 yrs...would've stayed on the phone because I cared more then.  good for teens.  I really would have.  I used to call radio stations (well, maybe twice in the 90's) and waited and waited and WAITed and redialed until I would get to make my dedication or whatever (sidenote: only made a dedication once to my 6th grade boyfriend, Brian Johnson (common name, therefore no disguise), on a country radio station.  you wanna know don't you?  "Touch Me..Turn Me On..and Burn Me Down.."  I was a Passionate 11 year old, k.)  Back to the point.  I can make an educated guess that a good majority of the AmerIdol votees are youngins with the innocent and determined perseverence to dial the number that corresponds most with their age group.  Now if that doesn't provoke comments on this blog...what the hell do I have them up for?  I already find the fault in what I just said.  Disgree...agree...don't care. write something in the comment area below and let me know what you think.

      I took a class last fall during my final coursework to get a Master's degree called Advanced Behavior Modification.  I learned a lot, I was inspired, I have now unfortunately forgotten most of what I got out of that class.  I can tell you that the main theme that struck me and one that I have mentioned in the early days of March when I began this blog is that of  awareness .  From what I remember (and I really feel and know I'm not doing the subject matter justice from what I write down here), awareness is something that goes beyond what I was typically doing before, which in sum was recognizing what my actions and thoughts were and how they either benefitted me or held me back.  From there comes constantly examining myself and of course judging myself.  The awareness that I learned about in this particular class cut the last part off of what I used to do, well, still do: judging.  There's more to it.  Don't let me be the one to explain it to you because I am lacking knowledge.  It was a Buddhist influenced course, go from there.    Today I've had a particularly crappy day.  Not an overly busy one, not one filled with frustrating  urlLink floral delivery occurances  or bad news, just a shitty thought overload day.  I had nothing in mind as far as what to put into this blog until about 2 minutes ago when I decided that as much as I used to support and advocate being "aware", I think I need an awareness break.  All I seem to be doing today is being aware of how I hate feeling the way I do right now and not really knowing why.  So what do I do?  Try to figure out why I feel this way, which actually makes it worse.  Why?  I am bringing back the judgment on myself.  and it ain't good.  Instead of just recognizing the simplicity of everything around me, I'm overwhelmed with a familiar negative thought pattern and I HATE IT.    That's all there is to say until I get off my ass and do something about the way I feel.  I hope I do it soon.  Right now I just have a headache and a case of self-pity.  I don't want to talk to anyone.  I just want to be happy.  I'm going to erase this eventually, but it had to be written because I have to do something.

      So I'm feeling a little meh lately.  And what does that always imply the next course of action will be?  Griping about it, cursing myself for being lazy or unmotivated, then getting distracted by something and finally feeling better.  Such an exciting cycle.  Feel like shit, feel elated, that wears off...lather, rinse, repeat.  And in case you're wondering, I'm not bipolar.  My mood swings aren't that extreme.  Writing about it is draining.  I really want to talk to a therapist.  I need some help reasoning some things out.  Some important decisions in my life need to be made and right now I can't do it on my own because my emotions are all over the place.  The overall goal of whatever I do?  Have a happy attitude.  And I know that constantly seeking outside sources (e.g., drinking, moving to new cities, depending on bf for happiness) to achieve that satisfaction that I long for are only part of it.  Outside sources are important, but I am the one making the choices and in control of my emotions.  Help is needed on finding the balance between the two.  I think that inner strength is supposed to lead the way and that's where I'm having trouble.  I don't want to confuse inner strength for anger or power above people, I want it to be reflected through the way that I reach out to others and enjoy life no matter what I face.  And that's damn difficult...then again, it's probably easier than it seems.  If I can just get over this nagging fear of finding a therapist who quite possibly could be a total loon or lead me into a direction that's not right for me, then I can make some more lasting progress.  If, if, if, right?

      I had a 12 hour work day yesterday.  Boy howdy, did it feel good.  I mean it was all manual labor bull shit due to a printing company error where 10,000 scantrons weren't put in the right order.  But putting those bad boys in order was only half the work.  The other effort was put into keeping a straight face and a closed mouth while my co-workers (all male, all in a ranked order) battled out who was the most efficient.  Let me tell you how exciting it is to be the only girl in a room full of males reaking of Type A.  It's pretty funny.  A little degrading, but it took my mind off of a lot of bull shit going on in my life, so I actually didn't care.  I like moving around a hell of a lot better than flattening out my ass, staring at the box all day.  So how about a couple of jokies?  Again props to my friend JD are in order for sharing these with me.    Q1: What do you call a cow with only two legs?  Q2: What do you call a cow with no legs?  do you know what it is?...huh huh huh?......  Okay...  A1: Lean beef.   bwahahahahahaha.  A2: Ground beef.  bwahahhaha*snort*hahahahaha.  too funny.  Oh come on, you love it.  They're even family friendly.

      Warning:  This post is not positive.  In fact, it's selfish whining and vague.      So, hi.  I want to be happy and I want to surround myself with people that make me feel that way.  Actually, I want to be happy regardless of who's around me.  I wish I was strong enough to blow things off that make me sad or mad, but I can't in all cases.  I just can't understand why it's so difficult for some people to be kind to others.  I feel like I've put other people's feelings ahead of mine for so long, so that they won't be offended, or rather, that they feel acceptance from me no matter what kind of statement they make because, well,  I HATE the feeling of being unaccepted.  Made fun of. Facial expressions including, but not limited to, rolling eyes, pressing eyebrows together, and the worst one...nothing at all.  I'm done with this shit.  Let's have some wine.

      You'd think that after 12 years of PMS, I would easily see it coming my way.  You'd think that I would know why the torturous head talk was occurring rather than blaming it on a depressingly profound state of mind.  Sheesh.  Lighten up.   haha.  I laugh because that's what Derek said to me during one of my "why is it that...I hate it that....I feel...but I feel...I just don't know what to do..." rants, and it totally infuriated me.  An email was later sent to him that included a list. A list!  haha. Love ya honey!  I once dated an  urlLink older guy  who at the time, had very different religious/spiritual beliefs than I did.  I actually stopped seeing him after a couple of weeks because I didn't want to risk falling for a guy that viewed things so differently.  Well, that didn't work out.  We missed each other, really liked one another, so we decided to try and work things out.  Here's the part where my organization/planning skills go overboard and begin to surface in my personal life.  I make a list.  A list of I won't do this, I won't do that, If we end up together in the future this is how it will be, etc.  Nice.  It's a wonder the guy agreed to keep seeing me after that.  Not that that list even compared to the one included in my email to Derek, but it was worth mentioning for the sake of introducing you to my problem solving skills.    I do have to make note that a list like the one made to the ex-boyfriend was made because I was doing what I thought was the right thing.  I also had little to none relationship experience at the time and I was doing the best I could.  I'm a lot better now.  Unfotunately, Pre Menstrual Syndrom is misinterpreted my brain during that blessed time as Practical Moaning by Sara.  Every thought I have is totally logical...at the time.  This post sucks, but I'm putting it up anyways as a reminder.

      Distraction is my chocolate covered orgasm.  I crave it, I hope I don't have to put much effort into getting it, and I feel totally relaxed and clear headed after it comes my way.  It's been the remedy for a depression I went through a couple of years ago, it was a big reason I had the best year of my life during my first year in grad school, and it kicks my crazy thought patterns in the ass before tucking them into bed.  It's the solution that I know works.  Most of my tangled, stressful, sometimes harsh thinking is understood by me.  In fact, I have analyzed the yahoo out of what makes me unhappy and I'll be glad to confidently say that I know why I do it and I am aware of the many different ways to fix it.  Unfortunately, before I jump on any of the fix it trucks, I have to be tricked into getting there, distracted if you will.  So what forms of distraction have come about in the past that have helped me to de-funk?  1. Moving to a new place where I didn't know where anything was or who anyone was and my mind was occupied with overcoming those things.  2. Going on a vacation with a bunch of friends that are very open, caring, and complimentary.  3. Starting grad school and wanting to excel.  4. Starting a new job and wanting to excel.  5. Exercising and wanting to look hot and feel good about my body.  That's a good starter list of stuff that has occurred during very happy, productive times in my life.  Productive being a feeling, of course.  I can only conclude that I have to be so wrapped up in something or wrapped up by an outside force where taking the easy way out is not an option.  Once I find out how to get by, so to speak, that productive, meaningful-ness is gone and I start  urlLink chasing the muthafuckin tipsy  again.  Can ya relate?  Cuz that's a good distraction, too.

      I was looking through my sitemeter tracking this afternoon and I found this:  Search Engine: google.com  Search Words: "how to hump"  You know, the person who ran this search I can only imagine is either a very curious virgin or someone who really just wants to make sure they're doing it correctly.  I mean, thank God for the internet, right?  If I had access to the internet before I was a sex goddess (shutup) I so would've been doing similar searches.  You go eager humper, you go.  I wish I could offer some tips if you ever make it back here, but unfortunately every time I have sex I still hope I'm doing it right.  Not that there is a right way...it all depends on what feels good.  Okay.  Enough  urlLink Sue Johanson  for the day.

      Derek is home.  You have no idea how good it feels to be able to type that.  I'm soooo happy.  and I so erased my original title for this post.  Just think of the chorus of the Christmas song "Frosty the Snowman" and you'll understand where I was going with it.    Now, I would love to take this moment to wish  urlLink Golightly  a super duper hip hoppity zipzap scooby dooby doo 26th birthday!  Did I just scat?  Oh well.  So, if you haven't already, go over  urlLink there  and give her a happy birthday shout.  Can I just say that I love my boyfriend.  No, I mean I looooove my boyfriend.  I'm not gonna lie, I had weird doubts and frustrations when he was away (mainly caused from limited communication), some of it from thinking about our relationship and where it was going and some of it from other stuff in my life.  Now that he's back, though I have this great peace about me.  I haven't had it much lately, especially since I've been making this transition from school girl slacker to sorta professional full timer who doesn't like her area of work...sorta.  It's okay sometimes, but not as much as I'd like it to be.  We did have a department picnic out at a really nice park on Friday.  2 kegs and everything.  The setting was kind of weird, though.  Loud clubbish music was playing and people were smoking and drinking, but there were kids and supervisors there.  Not your average company picnic.  Well, Derek is on his way over, so I must primp.  hee.  I get to primp for someone now.  FINEaFRICKINly.  And yes, I do it for myself sometimes, but this is fun too.

       urlLink Giada , you done it again girl.  I just made  urlLink Shrimp Scampi on Couscous  and it RULED.  I'm so wallowing in the glory of my chefness.  You must try this deliciousness if you have a good 2 hours handy for dinner.  It may seem long, but I actually like complicated cooking feats.  Let me take the opportunity to introduce you to one of my dearest friends and fellow lover of wine.   urlLink Golighty  (which I just found out comes from the very much appreciated Breakfast at Tiffany's), welcome!  It's a bloggy-blog world out there, it seems.  What a great way to connect with the old and the new.  So, kick some shouts out to my gurl, and maybe...just maybe we'll give you a  urlLink dance team  story.  Derek comes home on Saturday now!  Humping will commence in approximately 65 hours!  Excuse me while I try to prepare by watching Sex and the City (although I'm still not so sure about this TBS thing).

      Just got a call from  urlLink Amanda  and she said that Derek will be home on Friday.  Did y'all hear me?  FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAY!  Oh, how will I ever accomplish all there is to be irresistable in only four days?  Then again, the boy did hang out with other smelly boys in the desert for two months.  I think I can manage to exude hotness in less than a week.  I'm a little nervous about, well, you know.  I mean, there is a chance I have forgotten how to hump.  *hump-jigs in the middle of the office*  Nope.  We're still good.

      Before spilling it, I have to give props to my friend JD for coming up with the phrase that serves as my current title.  I'll give you a little background on how it was formed.    During one of our really good, comforting "man, finally someone gets what I mean" conversations (or that's how I perceived it...can't speak for him), I was going on about how once I reach a certain point of being buzzed or half drunk, I all of a sudden become let's-have-a-shot-I'm buyin' girl.  I actually reach a very relaxed and enjoyable state with the few drinks that I've had, but am so bound and determined to keep that feeling or enhance it that I slosh down way more than I can handle when I was already feeling damn near delightful. By the time I realize I've had too much, well, you know the rest.    So this isn't the light bulb moment I was getting to.  What it did lead to is a realization that my drinking patterns are a metaphor for many things in my life.  Clothes, work, what I eat, exercising, relationships, etc.  I'm constantly running after some kind of elation or peace or relaxation.  Hence, "chasing the tipsy".    Now, this isn't a novel idea and I am positive I am not the only one who displays this behavior.  It does, however, make me realize that there's something out of balance in my life.  I don't want to be chasing something that's already there anymore.  So, if I ever change my blog, that phrase will be the new name to keep me aware.  Don't steal it or I'll chase after you!  And I will not buy you a shot!

      Last night, Michelle, Rob, and JD all came over to my aqua colored apartment and ate dinner.  And drank copious amounts of alcohol.  And spoke copious amounts of shit.  It was great!  I love laid back drunken dinner night.  It kicks night out at the bar's ass every time for me.  I guess I'm just a dinner party kind of old lady.  And I like it.  There was one topic of conversation that was brought up during the evening that I would like to invite you to think about.  Music.  First of all, I'm 24 and I like all different sounds and genres and time periods of music.  I even like the current stuff and casually keep up with the newest pop and hip-hop and alternative hoohah that is today's music.  But these guys that came over?  Not so much.  They're all 30, and may listen to a few of the new songs and bands that are out now, but mainly just view the musical present as, "Man, there just haven't been any good bands that have come out in a long time".  Though their observations may prove to be true to many others, I don't necessarily think so.  I'm not the most skilled person at recognizing "good bands" -- wait, who is?  What makes a good band or sound or talent?  I think if I enjoy it, then dammit, it's good.  I digress from my original point.  Which is.  When you reach a certain age, does all the current music begin to suck to you?  Do you start to exclusively collect and listen to the CD's of your youthful memory making past?  And is a primary reason for listening to these particular songs and artists because it reminds you of the spirit and feelings of your youth...when you first had spirited feelings about music?  hrmph.  Or does the current music really just suck now?  I love it all.  Except for Jessica Simpson's 'Take My Breath Away'.  Don't even get me started on that slice of poo.

      This is a good one.  My department at work had a  urlLink birthday lunch  at a deli for 2 people that are celebrating some time this month.  The deli is small and there are 9 of us so it's a pretty tight fit at the table, especially when you have to scratch your knee and you accidentally touch the Captain's knee as well.   me :  oops, sorry about that.  him : fresh  me :  * ew ew ew...innappropriate, but he's the boss, uh, shit *  me :  only because it's your birthday.  me :   *what the flippin fuck was that, dumbass?  hullooo.  he's the boss man.  you don't talk like it's the 4th margarita at happy hour. doh.*   me :  oh gosh...just kidding...just kidding...just kidd- * that's enough Rainman...just pray that he didn't hear it in the first place *  him : huh?  * repeats what I say *  * snarky haha *   So now he either thinks I'm funny or a whore.  Whatcha gonna do?

      I just got an email from a co-worker with a spreadsheet attached to it listing out all of the people in our department's names and how much they owe her for 2 birthday lunches for other co-workers and some flowers that were sent to one of the worker's wife who just had surgery.  First complaint?  Why are you sending out an email to everyone with how much they each owe?  Couldn't you have talked to them about it one on one or sent out individual emails?  Second?  I don't know the dude's wife who had surgery, and I sure as hell shouldn't have to pay money for some obviously very expensive flowers.  Now I have to look like a chump because I'm the only one whose name had a money amount in the flowers' column.  Thanks.  Third?  No one ever split the bill when it was my birthday or anyone else's.  That's because the Captain usually picks up the check, but one of the birthdays was his so naturally he isn't expected to pay.  I understand that it wouldn't be fair to make her pay for his and some other dude's lunch, but...okay, I'm only worked up because of the flower thing and for being made to look like a heartless jackass for being the only one not to contribute to the gift.  Honestly, if I had the cash that day they were collecting money, I would have, but I didn't and I distinctly remember the same said co-worker telling me that if I wanted to chip in I could.  errrrrrrrr. Sneaky shit like that is so annoying.   *still mad*   I know the big girl way of handling it is to just pay the money and get over it, but gah...I hated the way this woman handled everything.  And here is where I'm a wimp. I should totally (and politely) tell her that I think she should tell us coworkers about what we owe in a more discreet way, but then it's obvious that I'm bitter because I'm the only one who owes something in all three columns. And the woman is hard-headed and so it probably is not worth the conversation.  She may not get words from me, but she'll get a look, by gum.  And it'll be fiesty.  errrrr.

      First of all, there's weirdness when both me and my supervisor are coming out of our respective restrooms and haven't spoken in a week (due to his crazy schedule...understandable). Bathrooms are just weird. It's also a little uncomfortable when I'm toting around my toothbrush and paste while he's asking me what I've accomplished since the last time we spoke.  Maybe I'm just paranoid.    Oh, but I forgot to mention that he asked me why I was so dressed up.  That's kind of funny, actually.  I am wearing a skirt and makeup today, but it's not like I went overborad or anything.  I'm just wearing my new threads I bought last week that are much cooler, as far as temperature goes, than my normal pants or jeans and shirt combo.  Can I just say that I hate when people ask that question.  Maybe I hate it when they ask it and I really don't have a particular place to be or person to meet, I'm just sick of looking like a college kid who rolled out of bed after 2 hours of sleep.  It's time for me to feel pretty again.  So, I let him answer his own question since I didn't know how to respond.    him : just for work?  me :  uh huh * dur doodee la...what the hell do i say...weirdness... WEIRD ness *  me :  so anyways, about that data...

      Nothing says Good Morning! like hot McDonald's coffee spilling on your thumb, your new Old Navy gray capris that recently became your new favorite pants, and your pretty pink shirt right smack dab on the nipple area so that it looks like you're lactating turkey gravy.  Nothing.  Other than that little mishap, which did make me cry for about 4.5 seconds, my morning got off to a good, fresh start.  I went run-walking at 5:45am for 30 minutes, came home/let out the dog/showered, made the best 3-point omelette (4 egg whites, handful of grape tomatoes, one laughing cow cheese wedge, and fresh chives from my  urlLink herb garden ), then scurried out the door in just enough time to be perfectly punctual to work this A.M.  I'm not even as tired as I expected to be on my first day of working out in like a month and a half.  It's time to get off of the ass.  Time to feeling better.  I'm going to try and get up every week day and either run/walk or take my dog for a long walk before work.  I have a goal now since Derek said he will be back in 2.5 to 3 weeks.  He promised, so I take it that everything has been finalized over there.  I can't believe that it's almost time for him to return.  Finally.  I'm ready to get back into my old schedule with him. (Oh yeah, my goal is to get in the best shape of my life during that time.  So realistic, I know.)   What sparked my little morning workout plan?  VH1's  urlLink Top 10 Rock Bodies .  Why VH1?  Why do you do it?  Why do you give sample exercise routines that make the public (public = me) believe that if you do these specific things you will have Brittney's ass and Jessica's hair and Sheryl Crow's desire to be active outdoors all the time?  Is this what you wanted to accomplish?  A crazy coveting data diva who's a slave to quick fixes and celebrity beauty ideals?    Thank you, that is all.

Coolest fabric  ever  on the walls.  I'm so doing that one day.  Anyways...(back to highlight #2 and an attempt at making a good paragraph transition) Speaking of walls, mine are now aqua!  I love them.  I needed a splash of new something, and by golly I got it.  It's so 24-year-old-living-in-Florida, if such a thing exists.  Did I mention the walls I painted in my apartment were aqua?  AQUA! Aquatic Mist to be exact.  I also potted an herb garden in a planter (Lemon Thyme, Rosemary, Cinnamon Basil, Italian Oregano, & Chives).  Just call me Martha?  And I'll smack you.  She gives off Stepford vibes to me now.  Just call me  urlLink Laurie ?  And I'll kiss you : ).

      I am a nerd.  A boring  hermit -nerd at that.  Since Derek has left I have bummed out physically, mentally, and socially.  Maybe if I provide a list of examples, you will understand what I mean, and then probably agree.  1- I haven't worn makeup or done my hair for work until today (that would be about a month and a half, possibly two, of de-primping) 2- I accept maybe 1/5 of any invitation I get by friends to get out of the house and do something so that I instead can: eat, watch the food network for hours at a time, and surf the net. 3- I went the longest I've ever gone without shaving *ahem* anything (2.5 weeks).  And here's the clencher...  4- The highlight of my TV viewing on Saturday night was going back and forth between TLC and the  urlLink National Spelling Bee .  GO DAVID!    These kids were pretty freaking amazing.  One kid, Akshay Buddiga, actually fainted in the middle of one his words.  Lucky for me, that's right when I tuned in to the show and I was totally addicted after that.  This is some intense shit, people.  The boy who won was so nervous towards the end when his component messed up and he had to spell 2 words in a row correctly.  He cried after he got the first one right...then I cried.  He could barely get enough breath to spit out the last word, but he did, and then he cried...then I cried.  His mom was totally relaxed and proud and cried when he cried...and I cried too (shhhh).  I told you this was good stuff.  National Spelling Bee's gotta new fan.

      Is it safe to call it being 'natural' when a pregnant woman shops in dirty socks and no shoes at the Garland Walmart?  No, no it is not.  I remember this hippee dude on my college campus during undergrad who was always barefoot.  Did y'all have that guy?  Man, I thought he was cool.  Deep.  Philosophical.   Natural .  Now, the same thoughts did not run through my noggin when I stumbled upon this Walmart appropriate shopper.    The word 'natural' in this day and age must be used very carefully.  Perhaps it should only apply to things that cannot be corrected with modern day technology -- things like farting, burping, etc.  Though they may sound gross, these pleasantries of nature cannot be easily or rather healthily stopped.  But a bitch  can  put on some flip-flops. And an arm pit can be lathered in some Ban.  And?  some eyebrows can be plucked.   You just gotta draw a line sometimes, you know?  Natural just don't fly like it used to.  Not with me anyways.

      I was sucked in once again by the power of reality TV last night.&nbsp; For the first time since I have started watching these&nbsp;types of shows (and there have been quite a few), I was brought to tears last night.&nbsp; Happy tears, mind you.&nbsp; The show is called  urlLink Amish in the City  and, like many reality series, brings together a variety of people to live in a house while be recorded.&nbsp; It's also like many reality series in that many of the characters have very strong personalities and opinions and stupidity all at the same time.&nbsp; Don't even get me started on the vegan who thinks cows come from outer space.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; You should tune in just for that stretch of comedy.   The creative twist on this show, of course, is that a young group of Amish people are thrown into the mix.&nbsp;&nbsp;The group is truly seeing and touching and experiencing life like they never have before and it's amazing to watch.&nbsp; A trip to the beach was planned for the entire group, and as expected, none of the Amish had ever been to a beach.&nbsp; Their anticipation and excitment is what made me get all teary eyed.&nbsp; One of the girls, Ruth, couldn't even sleep very well the night before they went, and when she did, she dreamed about the beach.&nbsp;   So this gets me thinking....when have I ever felt that excited about an experience?&nbsp; More specifically, when have I felt that way recently?&nbsp; This world has too many wonderful things to offer that I freely have access to.&nbsp; I've known this, but I've let it become part of the random, repetitive&nbsp;thought category in my head.&nbsp; Wouldn't they after a while?   Oh, and these kids are hot.&nbsp; The tall blonde dude's bod?&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; But his voice and teeth?&nbsp; Goodbye!

      I totally just remembered that I had a dream last night about Oprah.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know, I love me some Oprah Winfrey.&nbsp; Fat, thin, young, 50, Beloved, Brewster's Place...Oprah is a very strong role model in my life.&nbsp; Besides her general openness and honesty, I think I am most easily captivated by her&nbsp;sharpness and clarity of speech.&nbsp; She's charming, yes, but more importantly grounded.&nbsp; And I obviously have a desire to have these personality characteristics/traits or whatever, so her appeal to me is very great.   So I had a dream that she smelled bad last night.&nbsp; After all of these great ways that I feel about her, all my wacky little brain could do was come up with a dream about having stank.&nbsp; wtf.&nbsp; And we all know the woman is so far from stank that even her sweat smells of something from her infamous&nbsp; urlLink O list .&nbsp;   I would love to meet that woman or at least see her live.&nbsp; Do you think that the stank dream would be a good ice breaker for our first conversation?   &nbsp;

      Here's a&nbsp;thinker.&nbsp; When socializing amongst a&nbsp;group of people that you just met, and&nbsp;you&nbsp;plop down in&nbsp;a seat next to one of them who happens to be of your preferred sex, does it&nbsp;give that other&nbsp;person the right to run their fingers through your hair?&nbsp; With no prior discussion about you wanting them to do that?&nbsp; Ew?&nbsp; Hello, that was me last night.&nbsp; From now on I will be an impolite space-between-us seater.   Upon&nbsp;entering my freshman year at Texas A&M University, I went to  urlLink Fish Camp .&nbsp; If you're an Aggie you know that Fish Camp is a huge welcoming event that educates up and coming freshmen on the spirit and tradition of the University, and provides a week of getting to know random people that will be in the same boat as you will in the fall.&nbsp;   From what I remember, there was a nightly gathering where circles were formed and activities ensued.&nbsp; In order to get to these pow wow sessions, everyone was arranged in a boy girl sequence and led by a counselor to the meeting spot....all the while holding hands.&nbsp; I never did get that.&nbsp; Anyway, on one of the first nights, I held a guy's hand that I had never spoken with, glanced at, or felt any kind of familiarity with as was normally&nbsp; the case.&nbsp; However, it seemed as though he felt familiar enough with me to thumb caress my hand while holding it the entire time to the circle.   Why?   And that was the only creepy thing about him.&nbsp; He never stared at me while caressing, he never tried to talk to me before during or after that time period, he just wanted to fill up my palm.   Does this kind of shit happen to anyone else?&nbsp; The random low levels of being taken of advantage of?&nbsp; And if so, you're probably a lot smarter than me in that you said something to the other person.&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; In both caressing situations, I was just too damn amazed&nbsp;by the nerve&nbsp;of these pervs to say anything to them.&nbsp; But it makes for a damn good subject to blog about.

      I have a dilemma.&nbsp; It's payday&nbsp;today and it is the first time that this paycheck hasn't been spoken for by random bills or haircuts or new work clothes or whatever it is that I always have to spend it on.&nbsp; This is fabulouso, right?&nbsp;   No, damn it, it is not.&nbsp; Now I have many options of more expensive purchases swimming through my fertile imagination  (JDtm) &nbsp;and I just don't know what to do.&nbsp; Do I save the majority of it for the ever livin'/lovin' couch that I've been wanting for 6 months?&nbsp; Do I buy that digital camera that I've been wanting?&nbsp; or Do I get serious about blogging and vamp up my site with a little  urlLink blogmoxie ?&nbsp;   I have no desire to go clothes shopping.&nbsp; I've already done a  urlLink Lush  beauty product spree on Amazon, and I have enough new books from Barnes & Noble to keep me busy for a few more weeks.  Damn.&nbsp; It's hard being rich like me.&nbsp;

      I had to take my PC to the shop this weekend.&nbsp; The Cocks people told me that the reason my high speed internet wasn't working had nothing to do with them and was probably due to my new Ethernet card being struck by lightning.&nbsp; Hi, $60.&nbsp; Sheesh.&nbsp; You'd think I'd be smart enough to use a power strip for my cable access, but I didn't have an extra one lying around.&nbsp; According to the computer know-your-balls at the shop, it wouldn't have made that big of a difference anyways if it was a cheap one.&nbsp; huhr?&nbsp; that bites.&nbsp; He said a reliable&nbsp;power strip&nbsp;would run about $30 and a battery back up thingie would run about $60.&nbsp; Hi, that's an hour&nbsp;massage.&nbsp; Hell, that's groceries with&nbsp;beauty product extras.&nbsp; Oh well, I at least will try the $30 strip and hope future Pensacola storms won't kill my pathway for addiction #3 again.&nbsp;

      Another content day in the life of Sara.  Ahhh.  mmmmm.  *sigh*  As planned, I strutted through the doors of Tarjey with bubble bath on the list.  I ended up getting 2 different brands because Target is just that cheap and I am just that indecisive.  As recommended to  urlLink her  readers, I bought a lavender night time baby wash.  That stuff is so the bomb (thanks erika! If you ever read this, thanks for the product tip), but I used half of the bottle in one sitting, so I recommend getting the monster bottle if you take lots of baths.  I also found a gigantic bottle of good ole vaniller bubble bath for like...4 bucks!  And it smells so edibly delish.  Who needs Philosophy $20 crap when you can get bubbles on a budget?  Oh, and it does take after  urlLink Philosophy  products (really, I'm not pouring the haterade on the more pricey products, I'm just broke like that) in that the 3 in 1 marketing ploy applies (bubble bath, shower gel, shampoo in one).  All of the frangrances were fabu, so if you want cheap bubbles, get thee to a Target health and beauty section.  Today, I will cash in on my Victoria's Secret free panty (can I just note my absolute and utter disgust with using that vile noun to describe one's unmentionables? kthx) coup and perhaps some post-work pilates.  I haven't busted out that DVD since February, I think.  I want to see if I can work in an afternoon workout or two before I brave  urlLink The Firm  program next week.  I'm still going to commit to my morning walks, but let's face it...I will never be satisfied with just that.  I gotta work -- work it, girl.  Do my thing on. the. runway.  Okay, that was totally not me.  But whoever she is, I like her attitude!   SIU: Woke up at 5:30am and walked again.  Started my couch fund with a 10 meaty bones.  Counted WW POINTS (26 total) and was never hungry throughout the day - woot. Started reading Dr. Weil's  urlLink Eating Well for Optimum Health  which is right up my alley as far as really learning about moderation and balance.  I love today.

      I'm having such a good day.  No particular event or act of kindness has sparked my good mood, I'm just pleased.  Content days rule!  Especially after a string of meh's.  Meh this, beeyatch.  Guess what I do when I'm in a good mood?  I PLAN!  So, tonight I will indulge in another bath with a new bubble bath.  I will start my new couch fund in a pretty new container that I may or may not purchase from the cheap and trendy mecca that is Target.  I will clean some area of my apartment.    I will do these things!  And for you, I spread my happy on your crappy if you have any.  *Spreads happy* [editor notes that spreading happy can totally be misconstrued but does not care because she only feels the tingles of yay! right now.]  Woo!

      Remember how I wanted to take a  urlLink post-work nap  yesterday?  Well, it turned into a post-work go to bed way the hell early instead.  I took my bubble bath which, I've decided, will be done much more frequently in the future, and fell on my bed ready for sleepy around 5:45pm.  I woke up this morning to my alarm clock at 5:00am and guess what?  I hit the damn snooze button until 5:30am.  I've been doing this crapola since high school!  What a dork, but at least I did get up earlier than usual and went on a morning walk which is what I've been wanting to do for weeks now.  I just missed the rain that came barreling down 10 minutes after I was finished with my walk, Maxx's walk, and taking out the trash.  Waking up earlier even allowed me time to clean up my kitchen from the  urlLink stir-fry  extravaganza and drink some coffee before leaving for work.  It poured, and I do mean that literally,  the entire way to work.  Lately, I have loved the rain.  I've been hoping that it rains most days this summer where normally I'm pissed off about it because it means no beach time fun in the sun.  It relaxes me and cools things off, so as of this summer, rain is my friend.  Self-Improvement Update (SIU): Walked 30 minutes this morning, woke up early so I wasn't running around like a puppy on crack trying to get 45 minutes of morning prep time squeezed into 15 minutes, no smokie for 2 days in a row and no desire to, and 8-8's of water taken care of yesterday. woo-party!

      My office smells like Chinese food.  I made an  urlLink Asian stir-fry  last night and had leftovers for days so I decided to bring some to work.  It stanks and it makes me want to take a nap.  Well, maybe the fact that I hit my snooze buttons (2 alarm clocks and the bitch still won't get up) for an hour and a half this morning contributes more to the sleepiness.  Eventhough I went to bed at 10 or so last night, the constant waking to snooze habit I've been in drains me.  Don't tell anyone, but after lunch I took a professional nap on my professional desk at my professional job.  Oh, the scandal.  My supervisor is on vacation so apparently me thinks I am as well and have given up on putting in any kind of effort for data cosmetology.    I am craving a bubble bath and a post-work nap right now...even if sleeping in the middle of the afternoon cranks up my cranky to concentrated levels upon waking.    Self-improvement update?  No smokie yesterday, tons o water, and only eating when hungry.  woo-party!

      I think I'm making up for all the dehydration my body suffered from the alcohol abuse/just don't care mode I've been on for the last 3 or so weeks.  It's only 7 after 3 in the afternoon and I've already swallered down 84.5 o's.  Feels good.  I should do it more often, you think?

      Dear 1 y/o rugrat sitting behind me in the airplane on the way home from Corn land's parents,  If it's not too much trouble, being that there  are  two of you and only one child, would you mind correcting the behavior of the chubby child that is pulling out my hair one clump at a time, laughing about it, then finishing off the deed with some kicks to the back of the seat.  I mean, I'm all about letting the child "be" and all, but uh, some of us don't like getting poked, pulled at, laughed at, screamed at, and farted on by baby strangers.  There's got to be a line drawn, yo.    Lylas/BFF, Sara

      I got back from Indiana yesterday.  Wait, let me rephrase.  I came back from the land of corn yesterday.  That's all there is, folks.  Corn. and lots of it.  I will say that it was very pretty country, but God knows a girl can only take so much corn viewing.  Did I mention that I was going to go to the Jimmy Buffet concert?  No?  Well, I did.  Derek's parents had a big pre-party  at their house and rented a charter bus to haul 47 drunk people to and from the ampitheater.  There's not much I remember except for lots of jello shots, hats and shirts of many colors, and a guitar shaped glass that my beer was in.  Oh, and waiting in line at the portapotty for 45 minutes.  Thems was good times. I took a ton of pictures and I plan on posting them as soon as I get Wallyworld to make a CD of my film.    Other than that, I'm feeling refreshed.  A little time off from work was good for me.  I am also ready for my self improvement cycle to pick up the pace.  Since I'm a little more calm than I've been in the past few months, I'm ready to start up the old get healthy regimen.  I'll keep you updated weekly on the things I'm doing for myself and how it makes me think and feel.    My first step today will be to eat a normal amount of food that I prepare.  I've eaten so many out of whack proportions of fast food and alcohol in the past, well, longer than I really can keep track of, that it really is taking a toll on my physical and mental energy.  Amazing that I'm really observing this for the first time in my life.  Anyways, that's what I'm going to do.  For today I will not worry about calorie counting or fat content, I just want to get hungry, get full, and do that more than once throughout the day.  I also want to up my veggies, which I am practically craving at this point.  Have a great week, it's good to be back home.

      A three day weekend always feels more natural to my lifestyle than a measly two days off.  I had a great weekend.  My friend Mellissa came into town and I hung out with her, JD, and some other folk on Friday and Saturday.  The rest of the weekend was spent with, hmmmm... you guessed it!: boyfriend.  And a good rest of the weekend it was.  How about some best of moments?   Friday:   Discussions of greeting strangers/strangers greeting.  Me greeting 3 strangers on the street (as a solution to overcoming my retardo anxiety of not knowing where to look/what to do when in a stranger passerby situation) and being promptly ignored.  It's much more fun knowing that I may be scaring the citizens of Pensacola rather than unnecessarily annoying myself with social anxieties.   Sunday:   A conversation witnessed by both me and Derek at a liquor store while watching the fireworks.  Before spilling the dialogue, let me inform you that the Indian owners were standing outside during the show and closed down for the duration of it.  19ish y/o Guy walking by with 19y/oldish peeps:  (Directed at Indian owner)  "Hey man, you giving away free t-shirts?"  Indian  Owner: "No, minana." Guy: "Huhr?" Owner: *raises voice jovially* "minana!" Guy:  *totally serious* "I don't speak German, man."  That's like the most innocently hilarious live comedy I've seen a long time.  German!

      Here's a deathly combination of food? that I strongly urge you never to ingest all in one day like some  urlLink punk  I know.  1 coffee w/splenda and Walmart cream, Light buttery carbaliscious Orville R. popcorn, 1 slice of hawaiian pizza from Dominoes, 1 slice pepperoni pizza from Dominoes, 1 orange Sunkist, 1 7-up, 1 Coca-cola C2, leftover  urlLink macaroni salad , and half a container of Rainbow Sherbet.  All of this followed by one Marlboro Light ciggie is deadly, people.  I'm just lucky they didn't have to perform plastic surgery on my taste buds or amputate my colon.  Never again will I eat a 100% fat, 100%fat-free, 50% sugar/50% aspartame, 800 kagrillion % sugar combo, followed by a smokey cloud of McNasty in my mouth.

      It's Friday and I am content.  Yay for content.  I think my shiny attitude deserves a little pampering.  Perhaps a lunch break mani?  Or better yet, I think I want to purchase a  urlLink book  that I've been meaning to get for a few weeks.  Dr. Dyer, I think his name is.  You may have seen the guy on PBS, at least that's where I did.  He inspired me in a way I haven't felt in quite possibly a year or more.  His explanation of God/your source/love/whatever you wanna call it softened my heart.  I used to be very in tune to God as far as feeling a connection with a loving spirit.  The older and more educated I've gotten, the more broken that connection has been.  I'll spare you on my opinions and questions and doubts for today.  I will, however, tell you that what this  urlLink guy  had to say about feeling good and your "power of intention" convinced me enough emotionally to want to buy his book.  So that's the plan.  Next week (Wed-Sun), I go to Indiana with Derek.  Yay for Indiana?  Not so sure about that. But I love my boyfriend so I'm willing to spare my precious vacation time to drive 12 hours north to his hometown.  ***  Now, like  urlLink GL , time for some quotes and my response to them:   --"When you have the choice between being right and being kind just choose kind."  --Dr. Wayne Dyer  This one makes me shut up.  I can't argue with it.   --"Those who seem to cause you the most anguish are those who remind you of what you believe is either lacking or wanting in yourself."  --Dr. Wayne Dyer Word.    "No one can depress you. No one can make you anxious. No one can hurt your feelings. No one can make you anything other than what you allow inside."  --Dr. Wayne dyer Well they damn sure don't make it any easier.  ...I obviously have some work to do.   "doo to doo to doo, so I wait....doo to doo doo to doo doo...still waiting...It's a bunch of bull s**t"  --Golightly *relates*

      I came across a  urlLink new blog today , and I can already tell I will soon be a regular reader.  This was #94 on her 100 things list.   "There's a difference between being confident and exuding confidence, just like there's a difference between genuinely liking people and just being charming enough to convince them you do. I live somewhere within these differences."   That's a pretty profound statement and self observation that I can identify with.  I don't want to be in between anymore, though.  Scratch that, I just want to accept where I am instead of being so disapproving.  So, hopefully this quote has inspired you to go check out  urlLink Natalie .  In my usual bad blogger etiquette form, I have not made an attempt to say hello or comment, but that will change as soon as I get over my retarded fear for saying something, well, retarded.  Regardless of that, go visit for a good read.

      Orange tank top, gold chain wearing  urlLink flirter  greeted me again today without his dogs. He was wearing a fine vintage pair of 80's penny loafers (with socks. hm.) in addition to his normal ragamuffin attire. Poor dude. Maybe those are his jammies or something, but if you're going to ask a girl out (yep. He asked, I declined.) you at least need to make some attempt at impressing her.  It's just what you do.  So, The Loafer Flirt  (TM)  came out at the same time he normally does (20 seconds after I leave my apt. to take out Maxx. A little creepy thinking about it now because it's clear that he's looking for me through his apartment window.), said hello, but kept walking on by. I take Maxx around the perimeter of the pool every morning where there are lots of bushes and designated pet areas. As I passed TLF coming from the opposite direction and we said our hello's, I figured that since he was still walking that he needed to go to his car or something and maybe he's not so much of a creepy flirter after all. But guess who meets me right as I'm finishing up my circular route from the opposite direction? Yeah boy, TLF, and I knew exactly what was about to take place. Name introduction (Jack), hand shake, and "would you like to go out some time".  Me: "Um...normally I would [lie][and a bad one] but I just got out of a thing [excellent description, retard] with someone and there are some loose ends still [loose ends meaning?]. I just want to be careful [that I don't date someone with the potential to convince me that gold chains on men is acceptable], but I appreciate it [which I do]."  Woo. I am just reeling them in, folks. First, I get an  urlLink unexpected head massage , then a guy at a bar tells me how much he wants to do me (didn't tell you about that one, huh. He was winner, alright), then I respectfully get asked out by a man who sports loafers and athletic shorts at the same time. And this lucky lady isn't even trying.

      Time for a little random thought spillage, y'all. Y'ALL. That word seems really loud in my head right now...ha! random thought #1 is a sneaky little booger.  2 - I've now used the word "booger" in a public capacity 3 times today.  3 - If you try really hard you can convince yourself that Diet Mountain Dew tastes like an extra bubbly mojito.  4 - (More of a confession than a thought) I spent 30 minutes at work today trying to come up with the perfect blend of ingredients to make a Bananas Foster Daiquiri. Sounds delish, right.  5 - I spent an additional 30 minutes trying to memorize and figure out a timing schedule for the most awesome lasagna that I will make for me, JD, and Michelle tonight.  6 - Sometimes I wish I was a chef because I love cooking. Especially the way that it zones me out and has an actual outcome...similar to a chair that a carpenter would make. Not similar to an electronic database created over a 6 month period that has no flava.  7 - There are some  urlLink incredibly   urlLink talented   urlLink writers   urlLink out   urlLink there . I wish I could do it as well as they do sometimes. However, I'm just glad I'm writing. Kind of like cooking. I'm not the most well knowledged or natural at it, but it's the best therapy I've ever come to know. The more freedom I have with something the better.   update: most well knowledged.  that couldn't be right.  neat.   8 - I really need to start my 100 things about me list. I think that is what I will do now.  9 - One more thing. I was so sad that we didn't have a hurricane disaster today. With all of the warnings from co-workers, emails, and the weather channel, I was sure that a nature party would be taking place right now and I would not be at work, but at home drinking copious amounts of cheap chianti. I even cleared off my balcony and bought a ton of water so I would be prepared just in case. Poo. Prepared fer nothin. The sun is even out right now shining a big neener neener smile. As long as she stays this way throughout the weekend so I can drink my reserved chianti on the beach, all will be forgiven.

      I got this meme idea from  urlLink here .  Originally from  urlLink here .  You're supposed to strike out the sentences that don't describe you.  I don't know how to strike out my words, so I'm going to do things bass ackwards and  bold what  does  apply .  APRIL:  Active and dynamic . Decisive and haste but tends to regret.  Attractive and affectionate to oneself.   Strong mentality .  Loves attention .  Diplomatic. Consoling, friendly and solves people's problems.  Brave and fearless.  Adventurous .  Loving and caring.  Suave and generous.  Emotional.  Aggressive. Hasty.  Good memory.  Moving Motivates oneself and others. Sickness usually of the head and chest.  Sexy in a way that only their luver can see.     Sickness usually of the head and chest?  "luver"?  And yet I still participate in anything that will tell me how I am.

      I don't know if there's something in the air or if PMS is within walking distance, but damn, I cannot get enough to eat in these last 3 days.  Last night my friend Jackie made homemade tacos for dinner and I ate 4 plus drank two beers which is usually a reliable predictor for the bloated-gut-feel-like-ass bodily response.   Also?  I licked my Lean Cuisine container bone dry just now.  Nary a piece of rice or drop of watery fiesta! sauce in sight.  Granted Lean Cuisine's are what the title describes them as in size as well as nutrional values, but I usually only scoop up the remains, not slop them up like a starving child.   I'm going to cut this short and go nosh on some left over birthday cake in the admin office.  I don't even give a shit about calories and all of that stuff either.  On the other hand, I'm not going through that rebellious eat everything in sight thing either.  I'm just hongry.

      I'm at work and about to accompany a co-worker (who happens to wear a uniform) to a meeting that includes lots of other uniformly dressed individuals in about 2 hours. The "discussion" consists of a panel (of which I will be included) facing one poor little air plane flying trainee and basically telling him or her to shape up or ship out. Cool, right?  Not when you woke up 15 minutes before you had to leave for work, your dirty wild hippee hair is twisted up in a clippie, you have no makeup on, your unshaved legs are exposed in a skirt, and your eyebrows haven't been plucked in about 3 weeks. Normally this form of dress I have no problem with because I am holed up in an office away from everyone and rarely do I have contact with my co-workers. But? today I have to be the only non uniform wearing girl in a very important chew out session that I one day will be involved in as a major criticizing contributer. When was I told about this? 5 minutes ago. ahhh! is my typical reaction to most things in this job. I like a little ahhh! every now and then, but I at least want to spaz out and be pretty. Not be the girl with the chipped Sally Hansen french manicure who forgot to shave.

      A few minutes ago I was trying to think of how to categorize the variety of entries I've made in my blog. At first, two stuck out:  1 - urlLink insightful entries  where through a certain experience or range of experiences I come to a personally meaningful realization. OR  2 - urlLink Light hearted entries  that make me laugh and attempt to make others laugh.  The more that I thought about the classifications, the more I realized how these two labels can be broken down into many more categories like  urlLink complainer entries ,  urlLink boring entries ,  urlLink emotionally driven entries that are unclear at many different points ,  urlLink drunk entries ,  urlLink quizzes/meme's , etc.  But now? Lately? I don't know what to write about. I feel like I'm just living my life. No particularly exciting or depressing or disappointing feelings or events, I'm just going day to day and doing what I can to be content. Don't get me wrong, I get sad, I get lonely. But I also am enjoying little things that I see and do, which make me feel good. More importantly there is a sense of satisfaction and self worth that I'm developing. Who knew.  There's been a lot of cooking. A lot of wine. A lot of drinking and talking with friends. A lot of Blockbuster rentals. And a lot of Target time. Oh, and pedicures.  I like my life here. I'm not ready to pack it up just yet, not even six months from now which is what I originally planned. When I was with Derek, all I could think about was how I could live closer to him and what the next step was. I didn't even enjoy the fact that I live in a generous sized one bedroom apartment that has  urlLink gorgeous aqua walls  and is located in a very convenient part of town. If Derek and I were still together, there's no doubt that I would have moved to be closer to where he lives, but now that that won't be happening, I'm kind of happy that I don't have to leave my place. I can stay there for as long as I want.  My life doesn't have to be chaotic for me to enjoy it. And I mean good chaos in this sense. Things like moving to a new city, starting a new job, starting a new semester of school, having a boyfriend, getting a new dog, moving apartments, deciding where I'll be in the next year, wondering where the money to visit my family for Christmas is going to come from, etc. All of those things were parts of my life the past 6 years. Always moving, thinking ahead, having new people come into my life... Now I'm to the point where I don't  have  to invite these things into my life. I've got my job, my place, my friends, my hobbies. I'm okay with what I have. Sometimes I'm thrilled! Like who knew how wonderful it would make me feel to go out on my porch, cut off some fresh herbs from my planter that hangs on the balcony and cook them into a fancy schmancy food network dish that tastes so darn good to me alone?  Life is good. It can be peaceful.

      Usually, I can't tell if a guy is flirting with me or if he's just trying to make conversation. However, this time I am certain that my neighbor is flirting with me. And I want it to stop. ASAP. Blech. Well, it's really not that big of a deal, he's a seemingly nice guy, but at this point I wish boys would just leave me the fuck alone. I have nothing to say to them, and I want nothing physical, which at this point I am convinced is all they want anyways. No, really. I'm allowed to be bitter especially based on my past experience with guys. Derek was the only guy that wasn't "that way". Anyways, said flirter is somewhere around 30, bald (not that that's a big deal to me), commonly wearing clothing attire including bright orange tank tops and knit athletic shorts that don't leave much to the imagination, and a gold chain around his neck. NO! Not the gold herringbone for males! Ew.  So I seem to run into this guy at the same time every morning when we're both walking our dogs. He started talking to me, oh say, 3 weeks ago to make small talk about Maxx, my mini schnauzer. He mumbled something about him having the same kind of dog when he was a kid and that those kinds of dogs are really smart and blahblah. I get that a lot (attention over my dog) when I take Maxx for walks around my apt. complex so I didn't think anything of it. But I kept/keep running into him and now he seems to be pulling stuff out of his ass (all still within the dog context) so he can talk to me. Example? Today, he came out of his apartment withOUT his dogs right as I was walking by to ask how often I get my dog groomed. Really, dude. You really want to know how often I get my dog clipped because you have a Weimaraner and a Poodle? and that information is something you have to know at 6:55 in the A.M.?  Flirting! I tell you what. But I'm always very brief with this guy as in I answer any question he has then turn around and walk away without continuing the conversation. I have nothing to say so why should I? I've learned to cut it off without feeling guilty in the past few years. Except when I'm drunk, which is why I'm now sober. Except that I still drink most days of the week so nevermind.  So now I remember the main reason why I'm nice to flirters and creepy boys and any guy that shows interest in me when I don't feel the same. These guys could be crazies! And I feel bad, but a girl's gotta be careful. You turn on the ice-bitch who likes to whittle men down with sarcasm and wit, you might have a criminal situation on yer hands. The male ego, and of course there are some more controlled ones (egos) out there, is sensitive.  And a lot of guys take a more blunt reflection of their behavior in disbelief and as a blow to their character when in reality, they just wanna break off a slice.  Believe me, nothing gives me greater pleasure than staring a wanna-get-laid-flirter in the eye, flashing a big teethy grin, and using words and concepts and jokes that makes them scratch their monkey heads. Chances are they know what I'm talking about, but me not giving into their typical bullshit makes them change their dialogue. Sometimes they're turned on by this new challenge and some just go the hell away. I hate to think in such merciless terms, butchaknow what? My thoughts are a result of my past, my friend's pasts, and mofo TV.  I'm witholding the other side of this argument because it's the one that I was more inclined to support all of the other years.  That worked.  Nope.   "But he really is just being nice.  Oh come on, you don't have give into the guy, but you can be nice....not all guys are like that so you shouldn't treat them all like they're after something...etc."  And I still didn't give in, I'm just sick of being nice.  It's fake and I'm trimming that lard off of my character with every chance I get.  And I hate being led on, so I'm not going to do it.  I miss feeling safe.  I'm just going to write what I have been holding back. Derek and I broke up. Did the earlier paragraph indicate that at all?  haha.  I'm going to keep any detailed thought and emotion about what happened and how I feel about him and what was off of the blog as much as possible. But I will write some stuff. I have to. I think I feel the need to bring up the break up because I had a dream about him last night that brought back all of the old feelings. Gah. We were broken up in the dream, but I went to see him because he had gotten in some fight at a bar and anyways. It was good to see him again, even if in a dream.  Enough of that, I don't want to think about it and I don't want to put anything out there that honestly, he or anyone he knows would read. I have nothing but good things to say about the guy and that's where it will stop here today.

      Power Point? k. Excel? No problemo.  Access? *&$#@#^#(@&amp;)!*@_#! Really, how is one supposed to create a super complex, mega database with only the training of An one day course? And should the super important responsibilty be turned over to a person that uses the word "super" as her most identifiable adjective in this entry? I didn't even know what a database truly translated to until a few months ago. And that translation would be dicksmack. Sticky stank smack of schlong, oh yes.  But do you know what will happen when I do figure this poo out, because I will, because I always do? I will brag. And I will have mad skills to add to the resume. And I will be able to do the data anytime. anywhere. Oh good lord. I'm expanding on my computer ability so that I can sit and stare at the box for years to come! Let's have drinks and celebrate just that. We'll call it Box Staring 2004. No, wait. Box! Staring! 2004! One must add excessive exclamations so that everyone can transition from the bad stigma they have over this type of career area to a fine appreciation of stare art.  No, I love my job. For now. Not forever.  I really just want to be a crafty mother who makes bread and does yoga. And I won't quit trying until I get there. Come hell or high water, I will grow my own veggies and home school my kids. You will see. And hopefully you'll be doing it too because I'm going to need some cool neighbors to hang out with on the porch and drink organic Mojitos with while the kids are playing kick the can.

      I got  urlLink this  from  urlLink milk and pepsi .    THE PRISS   Deliberate Brutal Love Dreamer (DBLDf)   Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic.  Excuse me . The Priss.  Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy.  These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards.    Your exact opposite : The Playstation Random Gentle Sex Master   You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing.   ALWAYS AVOID: The Playboy, The Loverboy  CONSIDER: The Manchild   haha.  Maybe so. Oh, and btw, The Manchild description that this quiz suggests?  Bite me.

      I'm feeling the rejuvination from the weekend today.  Give me a keyboard and an Excel file, stat!  It's time to get to work.   I have a presentation to prepare that I've put off for a month.  My supervisor is expecting it to be finished either tomorrow or Wednesday.  wee!  Thank God I have the motivation to finish this thing up today.  You know, as much as I complain (mainly to myself) about this job, it really is a blessing.  I have so much flexibility, independence, and self learning with nearly every task.  How often does a fresh graduate with absolutely no professional experience get to do things how they want to?  Not often.  I've found that it's difficult for me to adjust to not being told what to do and exactly how to do it.  As much as I can hate that in life, it's what I've grown accustomed to.  It's how I've received praise and rewards for my behaviors and knowledge so I absolutely understand why it's difficult to move away from that.  However, I am adjusting.  And I'm taking it on with an increasingly positive attitude.  With that, bring on the statistical analyses I have yet to teach myself, today is going to be productive.
