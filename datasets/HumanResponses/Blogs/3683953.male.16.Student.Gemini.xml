        Well one good thing about today is that I actually woke up early for once! I woke up at 9 instead of my usual 12 or 1, so that was pretty awesome (especially since i went to bed at 3). Then I got on the internet and just started talkin to Mike and Charlie. I had very nice conversations with both of them.  Then Charlie came up with this idea that I should call him. Now see, here was the problem with that, he lives in Arizona, so that would've meant I was making a LONG-DISTANCE CALL. So i was like oh f*** it, and just called him anyway. It was pretty fun. (THE TRUTH: I was so nervous. I was pacing back and forth in my room the whole time. I think you could even hear how nervous I was by the sound of my voice. AHHH! That's the only thing that gives away my nervousness (LOL), my voice.) So that only lasted about five minutes, but it was pretty fun nonetheless.  Let's see , then I continued chatting with Mike and then Brad came online, so I talked to them both. I didn't even get enough nerve to call my cousin that lives in Cleveland, I was so scared. I mean, I haven't seen or spoken to they guy in like 6 years, so how would that look if I all of a sudden just called him one random day?    (Day turns into night) Then it got dark, and I was still bored. So then that meant more internet. YAY! Luckily there were people online to talk to. I talked to Richard for a quick second. He said his brother totalled his car, and that really sucks. But hey, at least he gets a new one, so that's not that bad. Then Mike came on, and I started talkin to him again. It was pretty cool. I've never had two conversations with him in one day. Hehe. Then.........(dun dun dunnnnn)...my mom came in my room, and told me to start lookin for plane tickets for our "supposed" vacation. And I'm all thinkin in my head " Damn! I was havin a good conversation with my friends, and then you just barge in like that. GRRRR! " Ya, considering I'm "not out" to the rents yet about my sexuality, they'd have my head on a platter if they knew that I was socializing with gay people. That's one thing they told me not to do, and I do it anyway (oh well, f*** it). My mom (especially) is the one who stresses on it the most. Here's an example: one day she just barged in my room, grabbed my cell phone, and started deleting all my friends' numbers who   she   thought were gay. That got me really mad, but of course I couldn't say anything, so you could probably imagine my reaction in my head.    Anyways, ya, plane tockets. OMG, that took forever. She made me look for tickets to Niagara Falls and New York City. She was so damn picky with everything. Ahhh! (And Mike, if you're reading this, I hope you didn't think I was ignoring you, because I wasn't trying to, it's just my mom, she.....ya. So sorry about that.) And then in the end, when I found a really good deal on both places, and had everything ready to be bought for, she didn't buy them. So that pissed me off, cuz it was like a total waste of time, because the prices change with every hour.   Oh and if you guys are wondering how I'm feeling, I still feel the same as yesterday. It's just so hard to forget about him. He's constantly in my mind and that just makes the whole situation even worse.  Song of the Day: UNWELL - MATCHBOX TWENTY

        Ok, so it's the Wednesday morning after my 16th birthday and as of right now, it is 2:54 am. Since I just started this thing, I guess I'll talk about what has happened since last Thursaday (my birthday). So my birthday was really boring, it was basically just like any other day. I didn't get any presents (as usual). Let's see, I think the last time I got a present on my birthday was when I was 6. I mean, I guess I shouldn't be complaining since I haven't got one in the past 10 yrs, but it'd just be nice to get something. Anyway, I'm used to it, so it really doesn't matter.   Friday was better. I got to talk to Joey and Corey (both of which I really enjoy talking to). Since it was my birthday the day before, Joey decided that he'd send me a picture or two so then I'd know what he'd look like. All I've got to say is that he is very very very cute. So that was pretty good. Then later on at night, I talked to Corey, whom I was really glad to talk to because I hadn't talked to him in about a month. It was good to hear that at least one person in his family (his brother) was accepting of who he was. I'm really happy for him. Then of course, we talked about shopping (dunno, how we got to it, but we got to it), and clothes and shoes and designers and stuff. It was really fun, and then funny when he started thing of designers from A to Z.   Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were all very dull. Just did a whole bunch of cleaning the house and washing the cars (ugh, who enjoys that? I sure don't. Plus, I hate dust and dirt, I can't breathe correctly after I clean). So ya, it was boring and passed by very sloooooooooooooooooow.   Then yesterday or today or whatever it is (Tuesday) was....ummm....I guess kind of blah. I spent most of it downloading music (mostly music frm the 70s, 80s, and 90s). Then I don't know what happened, but as I started watching this soap opera that I always watch, all these feelings that I   STILL   have for this one guy that I'm love with just all of a sudden came rushing back. I mean I told him that I loved him and well I didn't get the response that I wanted, so I'm guessing you can tell what happened. It felt like a river breaking down a dam. I don't know, it was just very heart wrenching and didn't feel good at all. That's what happened today, except I wasn;t even talking to him at the time so I don't know why it happened. I just wanted to runaway and be   ALONE  , but I guess I shouldnt do that since it doesn't solve anything. And as of right now, i still feel the same. I'm back to my state of confusion and of feeling lost. So basically, all I've been listening to today is Jumper - Third Eye Blind, Unwell - Matchbox Twenty, Closing Time - Matchbox Twenty, 100 Years - Five for fighting, Come On - Ben Jelen, Screming Infidelities - Dashboard Confessional, Hands Down - Dashboard Confessional, Let Him Know - Bryan Adams, Me Voila! (Here I Am) - Bryan Adams, and Losing My Religion - R.E.M. But mostly I kept it to Jumper, Let Him Know, and Me Voila!   JUMPER - THIRD EYE BLIND  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, You could cut ties with all the lie that you've been living in, And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, I would understand  The angry boy, a bit too insane, Icing over a secret pain, you know you don't belong, You're the first to fight, you're way too loud, You're the flash of light, on a burial shroud, Well everyone I know has got a reason, to say, put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in, And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, I would understand  Well he's on the table, and he's gone to code, And I do not think anyone knows, what they are doing here, And your friends have left, you've been dismissed, I never thought it would come to this, And I, I want you to know, Everyone's got to face down the demons, Maybe today, we can put the past away,   I wish you could step back from that ledge my friend, You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in, And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, I would understand  Can you put the past away? I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, I would understand...   LET HIM KNOW - BRYAN ADAMS  Another day goes by and still you wonder what happened You'd give the world for one more try But you're too shy to ask him You don't wanna ask him now I know your heart will pull you through If he means that much to you - you gotta let him know  Let him know that you love him You gotta let him know  What can I say it's up to you You gotta make up your own mind Well it's your life it's up to you  Cause you didn't believe me You still don't believe me Now you're gonna see it's all comin' true That's why I'm leavin' it up to you Yeah you gotta let him know  The news is out I guess you heard I shouldn't breathe a single word  The bottom line is nothing's gonna stop you now You gotta let him know....  I don't know if this song has any relevance but I've been singing it all day  ME VOILA! (HERE I AM) - BRYAN ADAMS  Eh eh eh Je suis là... me voilà... Jamais je ne pourrais vivre sans toi. Me voilà.., et à tes côtés. Ce soir, j'ai le droit de rêver.  Un nouveau monde, une nouvelle vie, Nos deux coeurs battent au rythme de la prairie. Un nouveau jour, de nouvelles joies, Je n'attendais que toi... Me voilà...  Eh eh eh  Me voilà!  Nous voilà, et tout commence. J'attends depuis longtemps ce jour de chance. Oui!

           Alright so I've been pretty busy this week, what with band camp and all.  Band camp was hell. It was so fucking hot, and I got sunburned all over. I guess that's what four hours in the sun in the middle of that day can do to you. I AM SO DARK! I miss my nice white color. Now I'm "rainbow bright," hehe Mike said that. I'm red, dark red, brown, dark brown, tan, white, and yellow; hehe gotta love that color spectrum. I'd put a pic of what I look like with a sunburned face but that'd just be bad.      Anyways, band camp wasn't that bad. It was pretty fun seeing all my friends again. Only bad thing was this attraction that I have for my best friend Kody, kept getting stronger and stronger. It really sucks that he isn't gay : (. (I wish he were.)  He encompasses all the traits of the perfect partner (for me), except for that one major component, he isn't gay. Gosh, when I first saw him (since school ended), I was like in awe. He looked sooooooo fuckin' hottt. His now very short hair, made him look all the more attractive. I couldn't help but stare at him a lot, I hope he didn't notice that. Here's another thing that I couldn't help but do: everytime he bent over to pick something up off the ground, I stared at his very nice, cute ass. Man, I feel so wierd. I'm not suppose to feel this way for him, oy. What am I going to do? (I don't know)

            Wow I sounded like a total dork. Did you hear me laugh at the end? All those nerves, hahahaha. Oh well at least it worked, and you can hear what I sound like.&nbsp;I don't laugh as much when I talk in person though, I promise.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah I know it's a little early for Christmas but it's just right around the corner. I know I'm late for Christmas in July but I did remember it yesterday, thanks to QVC, haha. Now i got to save money for all those wonderful presents that I'll be giving in December. Well I hope they'll be wonderful anyway, depends on how much I save. But I do love buying presents for people. I'll probably go broke again, haha. Oh well, that's what aunts and uncles are for, they give you money when they couldn't think of anything to buy you, Haha. That always refills my wallet. Haha. Ok so Merry Belated Christams in July.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grrrr. It's happening again. This happens too&nbsp; much, and I can't believe that it still happens. Why is it that I can't forget about Hrayr? Ahhh, it kills me everytime. I think I must be crazy. Either that or a damn right fool.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I see his car on the road (a blue, 2004 Honda Accord LX) I think of him and when he drove two hours just to come and meet me. Whenever I see his cell phone at the store (a dark gray Motorola flip-phone), I think about that time when we went to the movies together and just walked around for hours and hours afterwards. When I go to that same theatre to watch a movie, I remember when I was looking for him to pass by and he all of a sudden tapped me on the shoulder and said "Kevin?," with me responding with a nervous "Hrayr? Hey!" Whenever I see a movie that's set at the beach or when I'm actually at the beach, I think of that one time when I called him and we talked for about two or three hours straight just before we went to sleep. When I see something about his school (UCLA), it reminds of that tour that I so eagerly signed up for just to see him again. We were on our cell phones telling each other where we were and must've walked around the northern part of UCLA for at least 15 minutes trying to find each other before we actually met just a little bit east of Ackerman Union. And whenever I pass by the Walt Disney Concert&nbsp;Hall in Downtown LA (whick looks amazing by the way), it reminds of that time when he called me right after we met at UCLA, because that was where our bus was right when he called me.&nbsp;We were both stuck in traffic on the sidestreets so we kept each other company until the traffic sarted moving again. And if anyone knows what LA traffic is like, you know that it can take forever for a single foot of movement.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what I guess what gets me the hardest is when I can't sleep at night and the radio will&nbsp;be playing a song that triggers all these thoughts in my head about him. It gets especially worse whenever I hear  Right Here Waiting  by Richard Marx or  Everything I Do, I Do It For You  by Bryan Adams. I sit by my window or stare out my window, and I think about all those times we talked on the phone just before we would go to bed (and those we're very long long-distance calls mind you). It just kills me all the time. It makes me think,  Why? Why couldn't we be? Did I do something wrong? Why?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does this happen to me? Why can't I stop this? I must be a total fool for still thinking about him like that, but I can't help it. Oy! (Puts a pillow to his face and screams)   SONG(S) OF THE DAY:  When You Love Someone  - Bryan Adams,  On a Day Like Today  - Bryan Adams,  Love Breaks Your Heart  - Vanessa Williams,  Keep on Loving You  - REO Speedwagon,  Best That You Can Do  - Christopher Cross,  Only Time  - Enya,  Torn &nbsp;- Natalie Imbruglia,  Kiss Me  - Sixpence None the Richer,  Me Voila! -  Bryan Adams,  Unwell  - Matchbox Twenty&nbsp;

       &nbsp; I guess all good days have to come to an end. I wish that one happy day, where I felt like nothing could bring me down, could have lasted forever. Now I'm back to the same old shit as always. I wish I could just turn 18 right now so I can leave this hell that I call home (but then again most of you who are reading this that know me already know that). People say that " home is where the heart is. " If this is true, then I don't know where  my home  is because my heart isn't here at all.         "Home is where the heart is."                &nbsp;  I hate having to deal with the same shit everyday, day after day. I hate waking up everyday and realizing that yes, this place is home for now, and yes, that this place is a living hell. I hate waking up from nice, peaceful naps to my parents arguing over things, especially over money. I hate having to be the messenger in the house, having to walk back and forth between parent and parent, telling each one what the other one said. I have better things to do than that. And what I hate the most is when I get yelled at by my parents because they're so irritable when they're fighting, any little thing like a fly will get them all hot and bothered. That's why sometimes I wish that I could just lock myself in my room and never have to come out. Only problem is, I can't get a lock on my door because  they'll  probably get rid of it as soon as I put it on there. :(                                  One good thing about today though: we went to Virgin Megastore and I got   On a Day Like Today    by    Bryan Adams.    &nbsp;

      &nbsp; Ok so today was really great. This is the first time in a very long time where I can actually say that I was happy, becuase i truly was. I always have a blast talking to Mike and Brad but today was especially fun (I don't know why it was but it was). Oh wait, I think I know the answer to that question, LOL. I think it was because I was talking to Mike, Brad, Hrayr, and John all at the same time, LOL, LMAO. But more to Mike and Brad. Hrayr is in Armenia right now having fun (sniff sniff). Luckily for him, the drinking age isn't 21, so he gets to drink too. (Damn) And even more, there are cute guys in the group that he's traveling with so it's like totally UNFAIR! I haven't seen a cute guy in person for months now. No wait nevermind, that was only last week. I saw a cute guy at the mall. Haha, LOL, LMAO. And well John is always cool to talk to. I can't say enough about him.  &nbsp; Now back to Mike and Brad. As I said,&nbsp;talking to them is always a blast. Mike is so funny and so is Brad. The subject of tanning is always fun to talk about with them. I'm dark, Mike's white, and Brad probably has the colour me and Mike both want, LOL. Anyway Mike opened up, which was good, 'cause it's always good to open up to people when you got stuff on your mind. When he said that we were like family, we as in the people that visit his board everyday, it made me feel good. I don't know, I guess I always feel like I'm excluded from a lot of things and end up feeling like the outsider or the dreaded loner. Guess it felt nice to feel like I belong somewhere for once. But it is true, sometimes Mike, Brian, Eugenia, Bill, Joey, Brad, Rich, Eli, and CF and Pooch&nbsp;do feel like my family, sometimes my only family. What was cool too, was that I got Bill's cell number, so that actually lets me talk to three members of my big online family [Rich, Joey, and Bill]. &nbsp; Nous sommes un famille . I don't know if I'd be the person I am today, without them. They've helped me so much in so many different ways. It reminds me of that great show from the 80s called  Family Ties (1982-1989) . It's a great show, you should all watch it. Here's the theme song:     "I bet we've been together, for a million years   &nbsp;And I bet we'll be together for a million more.   &nbsp;Oh it's like I started dreamin' on the night we kissed   &nbsp;And I can't remember what I ever did before.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;What&nbsp; would we do baby without us?   &nbsp;What would we do baby without us?   &nbsp;And there ain't no nothin', we can't love each other through   &nbsp;What would we do baby without us?   &nbsp;Sha-na-na-naaah."   &nbsp;  &nbsp; And on that note, I never knew that I also was helping Mike. I was astonished when he told me because I never thought that I, the short, sixteen year old kid from California could help someone. But I guess there's a first for everyting, right? (Wow that was sooo cliche-ish.) But ya, as you can see, my day overall was a pretty happy one.  Je suis tres heureux.

      &nbsp; Ok so over the past couple of days, I've met some really cool people, actually just two. The first is Phillip. he lives in LA and goes to USC. So that was cool. Another thing is....he is so damn hott. He's half white and half filipino, and his case, that mix turned out just right. It was funny, I asked him if he was pinoy (filipino), and he said "Yeah! How did you know?" I was like well I'm full pinoy and your eyes are a dead giveaway. He like oh, haha. Yeah, so that was cool.  &nbsp; The other guy I met is named John. He is 25 and lives in Sacramento. John is the coolest of the two. He's kinda like me, except not like me. We share similar interests so I guess that's what made him nice to talk to. He told me that he had  Spina Bifida , which is a birth defect that causes spinal fluid to build in the brain a.k.a.  hydrocephaulus . I was shocked for like a second, he thought that I would freak but i didn't, but then I thought that doesn't make him any more different than you or me. I was glad that he did not have to be in a wheelchair though (because he's too cool to be in a wheelchair) because most people living with his birth defect are. He was also glad of that becase he was one of the lucky ones. This was the weird thing, we both said we were loners and didn't have many friends, but then we said that we've been loners since the third grade and we were just like....total shocker. (If John sounds familiar to anyone, it's because I told him to go to Brian&Mike's Place to meet and make some really cool friends.) &nbsp; Tonight was a good night because I actually got to talk to Mike again, which is always a blast for me (and probably for him too). It was funny 'cause I was like alright I'll listen to you because you are like my foster dad. Then he laughed and said that was so true because I get my love for music and my musicianship and stuff from Brian and I get my love for Bryan Adams, insomnia, and my patience for computers from him. Hahaha so that was funny and put a gigantic smile on my face. His idea of having a tv show about our lil family (like everyone there) wouldn't be half bad, i'd definitely watch it. It'd be great 'cause there'd never be a dull moment what with all the amazing people that we got there. Then we did some computer stuff so he could get his background music on his blog working. Unfortunately it didn't work, so he said that he'd try again later. Then it was good night from there.&nbsp;It was funny though (you're all probably wondering, gosh isn't anything not funny to this kid?&nbsp;Well the answer is yes, but that doesn't apply to here), here's what we said:   "Night than kiddo" "Night dad. (omg did I just say that?) Hehe" "Yup you did, haha. Good night son." "Night." "I tell your other dad too." "He's still up?" "No." "Oh ok." "He is way asleep." "oOo." "But I will whisper in his ear." "Ok. Well tell him I said good night then too." "He is holding my pillow looking for me." "I see." "He is funny." "Hei I do that too." "Haha." "Hah ya." "Ok better go this time." "Aight. Night night." "Night." "Stop him from lookin for ya." "Yup." "Cuz youre found." "Ok ok good night." "Night." "Bye." "Bye."

       &nbsp; Well I guess you can say that its been a pretty good couple of days. Online life is great but home life is a different story all together. I love my online family, hehe, I don't think I say that enough. J'amour ma famille. (Mike, Brian, Richard, Eugenia, Bill, Joey, Corey, CF, Pooch, and anyone else I forget, you're included too.) On Monday night (Tuesday morning), Bill was nice enough to keep me company. As he said, we talked up a storm. We took up the entirety of Mike's message board, hehe. I think we talked for three or four hours. Bill is Mike's friend if you all are wondering. We talked about mi vida (my life) because as always it sucks. Then we talked about Yugoslavia and stuff and then we got to talking about food which made me hungry at 11:00 at night. How did we get to that again? Oh yeah, a pop-up for a free lobster dinner at Red Lobster came up and I guess that's where it started. It was nice getting to know Bill better. Friends are always good to have, the more the merrier.    &nbsp; Let's see home life wasn't as great. I hate getting yelled at, especially for something really stupid ir for absolutely no reason. If I get yelled at for those two reasons, I will start to cry and go up to my room and just stay there and never come out. That's just me. Then I'll be cussing them out in my head. That would be how I would calm down. Because that gets me real angry for somethin so stupid. If you're gonna yell at me, make sure it's for a good reason and not for somethin stupid, because I really hate that. And you wanna know what I got yelled at for? It was for using a meat cleaver (those real big knives) to cut a roast in half instead of using a regular chopping knife. That was so stuoid and uncalled for. But whatever. I don't give a damn for that stuff.

      I'm worried about Hrayr. I'm really worried about him. I know that he said that he was fine but right now he is Lebanon, and that kinda scares me what with it being in the Middle East and all. Maybe I'm just a worry-wart but I don't know. I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to him. The loss would be too great.  (Just look at the third scrolling quote, and you'll know why it'd be too great of a loss.)  SONG OF THE DAY: Right Here Waiting - Richard Marx

      Can someone remind me why I was born again? Because for the life of me, I can't come up with an answer.

      Today wasn't a good day. I don't think my family will ever accept me for who I am. I know that I am not the son they wanted, but they just really have to get over that. So today at dinner, I don't know how the fuck it came up, but my mom started talking about my friends. She wanted to know if I was still talking to my friend Jason. Here's the reason why she asked: Jason acts in ways that would give you the impression that he isn't straight (well this is true, because he's bisexual). So when she asked me that, I answered no because he was going to college and was pretty busy. Then you know what she said? She said "Good. I don't want you to be talking to him anymore. I dont want you hanging out with gay people because being gay is contagious." The she said that it was a   fact   that if you are staright and hang out with gay people, that you will become gay yourself. I just wanted to slap her and cuss her out right there and then. She just pissed me off so much. So then I said to her, "You don't want us talking to Rodel either then? (Rodel is my only gay cousin, who I still haven't called)" Then she said "No, that's different." In my head, I was thinking it's the same thing. So ya, that really got me pissed.

      It's Wednesday morning and the time is 3:32AM. I can't sleep. Hrayr leaves for Armenia and Lebanon today. Hopefully he has a lot of fun. He deserves it. I'm gonna miss him a lot. His plane leaves at 8:00AM. I'm gonna be so lonely without him. He comes back in a month, so I guess I'm just gonna have to find something to do while he's gone. He said I could email him and he'd try to write back as much as possible. I still have to send his letter that I wrote him. I'm just so scared to send it.

       urlLink    Kerr Smith (Jack on Dawson's Creek)&nbsp; urlLink     "Jen, I'm scared...I'm scared of bein' alone...I'm scared that I'll never be somebody's everything...I'm scared that I'll never find a guy that..." (quoting Jack from last Monday's episode of Dawson's Creek)    So now it's July 5th and in the past couple of days, I've been feeling very very very depressed. I just feel like I disappoint everyone around me, especially my mom and dad. I mean, I know I'm not exactly how they wanted me to turn out to be, but you gotta be happy with what you got...right? My dad (especially) looks at me different. I know that I said that I'd be a mechanical engineer (when I was 9), but that was a long time ago and I've changed my mind. I guess he's kind of mad because he wants me to be an engineer but I'm leaning towards being a mathematician or musician. He constantly keeps saying "Do what you want to do, don't listen to anyone else," but I know he doesn't mean it. I can tell by the tone in his voice. And then other people, its just ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....  SONG OF THE DAY: BON JOVI - IT'S MY LIFE

          "I'm leavin' on a jet plane, don;t know when I'll be back again."    Yup. So I'm leaving today in a couple of hours. We're off to Toronto, Niagara Falls, and New York. Plane leaves at 10:10am, so that means we're leavin for LAX at like 5:00am. There's always a hell of a lot of traffic going there. Yeah, so I'll be gone until the 12th, that's when we get back. I'm gonna have major jet lag, oy vey!
