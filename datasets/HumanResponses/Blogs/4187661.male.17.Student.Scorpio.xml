           Today my baby went to college. That means my points go up in the cool-guy meeter. I'm currently dating a college girl fun fun fun! She had a nice room mate and will have fun whether she likes it or not! Not forcing her too, but its going to have the 6th grade dance effect. Where everyone doesn't dance the first hour and then everyone dances towards the end. I did have an "Ooops" though. I wasn't thinking when I chose my wardrobe for the day... I wore a shirt when I dropped off missy that was red and said "Im Huge in Japan". Needless to say I had to cover up the writing and turn my back to an asian kid ever couple minutes.       A little angry at the dudes. Shane is trying to hook up Dennis with some girl so they went to Fun and Stuff. Shane said Ryan was probably going to go too. I told him to call me because I could go because Missy wasn't around anymore. They never called. It wouldn't bother me too bad if they didn't bash me all the time. I've tried to hang out all the time over the summer, but they used lame excuses like "I wanna be focused at soccer practice" or told me they couldn't before they could ask. I know they all hang out without me, but this time I didn't do anything wrong. The first soccer practice that the coach went to and did something constructive I was intentionally slide-tackled from behind by my good pal Ryan Melton and the others just laughed. I think somethings going on and it pisses me off that they aren't man enough to tell me.       Football is going good. I kicked some really good ones. I need to find some freshy to train so they can have scholarships and junk. I skip practice a lot unintentionally. I always have something to do and the coaches all understand and they really do find themselves privelaged to have me kick for them. Nobody else can do it so I get certain privelages. Zontag or something is the Twinsburg kicker and he's ranked #1 in the US. I heard he broke his leg from Missy's cousin though. Stinks for him. Im up there in the 400s or so for kickers.      I think this is enough for now though. Missy should be on shortly and I will talk to her for a while. Gnight all!

           So this is a little place for my thoughts. I know I know! I don't need any more places for these. I have so many places. I have a webpage, I have this, and I have secret writing projects that I like to work on. You'd think I might want to go into writing or journalism or something! The truth is: Its so hassling to update my site all the time and Im probably going to slow down a lot on it. I've fallen so far behind so that site might stay dormant. My writing projects are all past ideas of writing about my experiences.      The first story Im writing about is a touching one about how Carie, Chris, and I were great friends in Sixth Grade and we all went our seperate ways. I am far enough to where I was stealing her away from chris! Heheheh I was an evil little kid. I don't know how I'll end it (that relationship) because the original was just too boring. I think I've written a good 20 pages into it too so I think Im taking this one serious. I just need a good ending to go for. Tell me if you guys got any ideas!      I need a place for my thoughts that aren't on some purely public site! I mean I guess this is too, but only my friends will ever visit here. Only the friends that I think will be respectful of what I say that is. I haven't chosen the select few, but if you're reading this... you're one of them!
