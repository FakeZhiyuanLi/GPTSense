       This is my first blog and I think I will start it off with my new razer. I just got a  urlLink Gillette M3 Power . It's kind of wierd it thought I would cut myself with it shaking and all. But that does not seem to be a problem. Acutally I cut myself after I turned it off because I was being stupid.   On a side note I just ordered an eXactMat from  urlLink Razer Zone   I should get it in mid July sometime.   Sunday I had my first ever paintball fight and honestly those things hurt like hell. It was fun however :)

       Ok this is just cool. Talk about retro I actually had this toy. What use to get me however is how does a little boombox turn in to a robot the size of a small building. Guess it does not really matter it. Just watch and enjoy. :)   urlLink More than meets the eye.

       Today is a sad day Ronald Reagan died at the age of 93. Even if you did not agree with his politics there is no doubt he was a good man…and in my own personal opinion a great president. My condolences go out to his family. Personally I am glad his suffering is finally over, I know that may sound cold but it’s not meant to be. The idea of loosing ones mind or knowing that you are causing your family to suffer is in many ways worse than death. Honestly it is one of my greatest fears.  Thank you Ronald all you have done.

       I want a nVidia 6800 Ultra bad! I know the ATI has some benefits over the nVidia and vice versa but I really don’t like ATI. Plus today I am going to buy Farcry for $27.99 so I will have a PS 3.0 game when I finally get the card. I hope Doom 3 comes out soon!  Update: Nevermind on the Farcry its only on 5CDs in the US not DVD to hell with that!   urlLink Radeon X800 vs. GeForce 6800

       Before X-Mas I opened a case on a memory leak in the Win64 Oracle driver and as of today they still have not fixed it. That’s over 6 months! I keep getting told they are working on it but I have yet to see a thing.

       I finally got my  urlLink BFG 6800 Ultra OC  and my  urlLink eXactMat . Both are awesome. I can run FarCry at 1600x1200 with everything on with the 6800 Ultra. Can't wait till Doom 3 tuesday. Oh yea  urlLink Best Buy  still sucks. I wish we had a Fry's in Roseville.

       Anybody who knows me understands that when it comes to my computer parts I like quality. I don’t skimp especially if it’s something that I directly interact with. With that in mind I have always had an appreciation for a good keyboard. It must have the following traits, good tactile feedback, audible feedback (click), no windows keys & be built well…..basically it has to be an old  urlLink IBM  classic 101. Many of my coworkers think I am crazy because a keyboard to them just a commodity hell you can buy cheap one for 10 bucks. This is where it gets cool, at least to a geek like me, about a month ago a friend of mine found a company on the web that still makes/referbs the classic  urlLink IBM  keyboards and he had ordered one in black. I had been wanting to get a new one because my keyboard is the only thing that is not black in my pc setup but I was not willing to give it up. So he sent me the link to a company named   urlLink Unicomp  and I saw the Pointing Stick 101. Its only noticeable flaw was that it did not come in black. I emailed the company and they told me they could custom make me one. However I ended up getting way more than I ever thought I would. The man I spoke to took the time to explain all of my options. Black keys with printed letters or grey keys with baked in letters (so they don’t wear off), removeable keycaps etc… So I chose a black shell with metallic grey letters, removable keycaps and TrackPoint II. Honestly I love the keyboard, I have been using it for the better part of a week and have adapted perfectly. The quality is awesome and it feels great. I only have a few minor suggestions for improvement to this already awesome device.   1. Put a TrackPoint IV on it. Click to Select would be really nice.  2. Make a USB version. Personally I like PS/2 better but USB is how the world is going.  3. The pass through mouse port does not handle the wheel on mice. This is only a minor annoyance when using the keyboard on a KVM. My personal setup has a USB  urlLink Razer Viper  hooked directly to the gaming pc and a  urlLink Logitech  Dual Optical & the keyboard hooked to the  urlLink Belkin  F1DS104T KVM. The  urlLink Logitech  is going through the pass-through so that’s how I noticed. This could most likely be fixed by making the keyboard USB and integrating a USB hub. But it’s a minor annoyance at most.    All in all this thing was worth every penny I spent on it and when I get the money I am going to be sending in one of my old  urlLink IBM  keyboards to get repaired by these people. That thing was a slacker it only lasted 17 years before the keys started sticking/stopped working. Plus I spilled a cup of tea on it. ;) Honestly the customer service was great and extremely helpful I wish the company well and look forward to doing business with them in the future.   Manufacture:  urlLink Unicomp, Inc   Price: $110 Interface: PS/2  Score: 4.8 out of 5

       Ok so I know I already did an  urlLink Oracle  rant but this time its  urlLink Best Buy . I preordered a  urlLink BFG Tech  Geforce 6800 Ultra and I just found out  urlLink Best Buy  sold more than they were going to get so now who knows when I will get my $500 card. That is just poor business practice. Also  urlLink Oracle  never has got me a working patch for Win64(Itanium).

       Bob had  urlLink Unicomp  customize his keyboard apparently he was sick of the QWERTY layout. Funny thing is they replaced my keyboard with this one this morning. Good thing I am not a touch typist. :D Commence with the geek humor.  By the way I took this picture myself.

       Today sucked. I woke up late for work and everything I did turned to shit. But then I got  urlLink  Doom 3   and damn is it awesome. At first I had some graphical problems but once I turned on VSYNC everything look perfect.  1600x1200 with everything on is just beautiful.  I would like to thank  urlLink  nVidia   for making the Geforce 6800 Ultra.

       Well I had to do it, I bought a  urlLink ViewSonic  VP201s 20 inch flat panel and damn is it awesome. Coupled with the  urlLink BFG  Geforce 6800 Ultra OC games look great. I don't notice any blurring at all. By the way when I spoke to  urlLink ViewSonic  tech support originally I was told that I needed to make sure my monitor was made after February 2004 or it was possible that the panel would have a 25ms response time not 16ms. Took all Sunday to buy however. First I bought one at  urlLink Fry's  and that had close to 40 dead pixels in the upper left corner. So I took it back and they had one more and it had big cluster of 8 in the center of the screen. I got my money back. By the way both of those were made in January 2004 and I did notice blur on the first one I brought home. Then I went to Roseville, California  urlLink CompUSA  got another one. Luckily this one was made in May 2004 and I can't find one dead pixel or see any blur. I can't wait to see Doom 3 on this thing. FarCry at 1600x1200 with all the options on is insane.   Happy Birthday Aunt Helen
