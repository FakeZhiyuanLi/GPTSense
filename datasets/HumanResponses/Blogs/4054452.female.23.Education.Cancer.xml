						   1. Frustrated that my summer class is not over yet 2. Frustrated that I finished my project for said summer class, but am feeling uneasy about it---but not because I don't think I did a good job, because I think I did TOO good a job, if that's possible 3. Frustrated that a friend is making a big mistake and I can't do anything about it 4. Frustrated that I'm so busy finishing up my class and planning my vacation that I amd having trouble finding time to spend with said friend who is making said mistake 5. MOSTLY frustrated that I'm tired and can't fall asleep at night or during the day to take a nap

						   So, an ex-boyfriend has a live journal that keeps him writing, and I thought that since I don't write as often as I should, maybe this would be a good idea. Forgive me if nothing is very profound. I'll probably have to work up to that level after not writing regularly for a while.   I just moved into a new apartment and I'm really enjoying it. The current roommate is a lot more compatible than the last two were, so things should be gravy for a while. The layout here is much nicer too. I think it has something to do with the fact that there are only two bedrooms instead of three, which takes away from the dormitory feeling and adds to the homey one.   Hopefully this will be a good place for me to turn over a new leaf and actually start writing.

						   So this is going to be a monster post…but I need to post about Seattle so here goes.              We flew out of Des Moines at 5 on Friday,  and arrived in Seattle at about 11:00 their time which was 1am our time. Mary and I were really tired and the flight from Cincinatti to Seattle had been rough (we sat next to old people and old people + Turbulance = crying, screaming …ie scary flight). Se we were tired and collecting our baggage, when my suitcase whizzed by me. Suddenly this guy comes up and grabs it for me. Then he comes over and asks if he can carry it for me too. We must’ve had some strange looks on our faces because he chuckled and gathered me up in his arms in a bear hug and said, “I’m Joe, by the way, Libby’s friend!” Only then did Libby and her other friend Noel show up to validate his identity.              They were extremely hyper and excited to see us, which was good because Mary’s luggage was lost. Had they not been so happy, I don’t think Mary would have taken it as well as she did. The ride to Libby’s Apartment was awesome. They were singing songs and telling jokes the whole time and Mary and I forgot how tired we were. We dropped Joe and Noel off at the base, but not before the guards searched the whole vehicle AND my luggage because there were civilians in the car. Ugh! Ah well, security I guess.   SATURDAY:             We met Andrew, Libby’s roommate, bright and early in our pajamas. He works nights, so he was just getting home at 8:30 am. First off, he goes to the refrigerator and cracks open a Coors Light! I reacted from my gut “UGH!” before I could even check myself. I apologized because I didn’t mean to be judgmental, but I had just woken up and a beer sounded like ass right then. So yeah, that’s Andrew! The boy likes to talk…more on him later.             We knew we needed to get Mary some clothes because the jeans and T-shirt she had with her were not going to cut it for a night out on the town in Seattle, so we picked up Noel and the base and met Libby’s friend Georgia at the hotel in Seattle. He then headed to the waterfront for some lunch at a seafood restaurant where they just dump the food out on the table in front of you. Not a seafood eater, I had a burger but enjoyed watching Mary, Libby, and Noel scarf down two buckets full of fish and seafood. Then we hit the shopping district and spent way too much money, and got stuck in some sort of parade on our way back to the hotel to get ready for our night out.              We headed to Pioneer square to meet up with three guy friends from Libby’s division: Mark, JD, and Asshole (can’t remember his name…but he was an asshole). We paid $12 to get into 12 clubs and had dinner at the bluesy bar called the New Orleans. We girls began the night with a shot (ugh…can’t believe I took one, I usually can’t handle them bc I gag!), and the guys were pretty nice. We made our way to about 4 or five of the clubs, and got totally smashed.              The whole night I thought JD was kind of cute and asked Libby what she thought about the fact that I wanted to kiss him. She was okay with it. BUT then drama! Asshole kissed me first! Ugh…didn’t know what to do. So I kinda stayed away from Asshole for a while, but he kept trying to dance with me and hold my hand and I wanted to hang with JD! Finally, JD DID kiss me and it was great! And we danced and held hands from then until it was time to head back to the hotel.              Asshole was really being an asshole by then, so I grabbed his hand too and told him to calm down. So I’m walking back to the hotel with JD on one side and Asshole on the other and then JD goes “man would you let go of my girl?” and Asshole goes “YOUR girl, she was my girl first!” As nice as it was to have two guys ‘fighting’ over me instead of the only one I really want not wanting me, I had to choose and I wanted JD so I chose him. Asshole ran off then to catch up with Georgia and Mary in the lead of our group for the rest of the ridiculous hike back to the hotel. He was pouting and being a jerk to Mary and Georgia the whole way. So, by way of punishment, Georgia made him (an the rest of us) walk an extra block! We got back to the hotel and I looked down at my feet to see that they were covered in blood! I had about six blisters from my new shoes, and some guy at the bar had stepped on my toe and broken half my big toenail off! OUCH! Luckily I was too drunk to really feel anything. ;)              So JD and I hooked up that night, to Asshole’s great disappointment. The jerk even came up to me in the middle of the night and asked “Hey Leah, wanna fuck?” Ick! NOT IN YOUR LIFETIME! But the whole thing was really awkward the next morning. So, I’ve had my first one night stand and it was fun ;), but I don’t think I’ll be doing that again.  SUNDAY:             The guys left and I had to dish the details to all the girls. Turns out that this one-night stand would come up several embarrassing times throughout that vacation! More on that later.              We drove Georgia back to Everett, WA where her ship is docked and took the Kingston ferry, our first ferry trip for the vacation. Then we went to a BBQ with one of Libbys co-workers “country” a black guy who looks like a young Dave Chappelle. It was very awkward because 1. we didn’t know anyone, and 2. we were the only three white girls there. The guys were all rappers and they tried to get me to sing since Libby told them I had a good voice. I was too shy to sing though, and I can’t improvise very well. I do regret that I didn’t try to sing something good for them though! Ah well. We left the bbq early and went back to Libby’s apartment and just hung out until Libby had to go to bed (she had to work the next day).  MONDAY:             Libby had to work, so Mary and I slept in (on uncomfortable air mattresses in the living room…with Andrew coming home and watching TV). Then we sat around and watched tv and talked with Andrew too long. By the time we were showered and dressed we only had an hour or so to kill until we had to pick Libby up at the base. So we checked out the mall in Silverdale (the town Libby actually lives in). Then we picked up Libby and got manicures and pedicures, went grocery shopping, cooked dinner, and watched a movie. Uneventful day. TUESDAY:             The gift that keeps on giving! We had washed our smoky bar clothes from the weekend and I guess I had the condom wrapper from my ‘fling’ in my back pocket because Andrew went to do some laundry Tuesday morning and found it in the drier.             “What the hell? Who’s shit is this, cuz I know it’s not mine!” he chuckles.             I grabbed it from him and tossed it in the trash…wanting to be nonchalant. But not 10 minutes later he brought it up again, and I had to confess. He laughed and said “at least someone in this house is getting some!” But he didn’t believe me that it was a one time thing and that I’m not that kind of girl! L  grrr. I think maybe he was just teasing me.             So, Mary and I wasted the day in Bremerton. But by this time I had developed a lovely UTI and had to call home to get mom to finagle a prescription from our family doctor. She did and I got my medicine…how inconvenient though! Ugh! We went to the “boardwalk” which is really just a concrete slab along the Puget Sound about two blocks long. It’s brand new, so they don’t have any shops there yet, but it has potential to be really neat.             Once Libby got off work, we met her at the base, and she and Joe took us on a tour of the USS Carl Vinson. It was friggin’ Awesome! That thing is huge. I’d get lost, in fact, Libby almost did showing us the ceremony room. All of a sudden she stopped on a ladder well, causing me to hit my head really hard on a pole! Ouch! Then, Joe showed us the flight deck and all the airplane equipment (the cables that they use to catch the planes, etc.) and I fell down two stairs and caught myself, pulling and/or stretching several muscles in my shoulder! We saw Libby’s birthing and her rack which she has to climb like a monkey to get to. We then understood why she wanted to get an apartment. Living on that ship when you don’t have to would suck! It was a neat experience going on an air craft carrier though, I only wish they would have allowed pictures.             Then, we went over to Sam Adams, a bar on base and had dinner with a bunch of sailors in Libby’s division, all of whom had heard about my little fling! Guess how much fun that was! JD was supposed to come, but he stood us up, guess he was a little scared to face me. Ha!  WEDNESDAY:             Libby had duty Weds night, so she wouldn’t be home, so Mary and I decided to spend the whole day in Seattle. We rode the 9am ferry from Bremerton to Seattle and slept the whole 50 mins. Then we took the trolley from the waterfront to the base of the space needle. We had a ton of fun up on the space needle. The tour guides up there are great! They have quite the sense of humor and they tell you a whole lot about the city. I felt like I learned a lot, and it helped us decide what to do with the rest of our day.             We then rode the ducks, which was hilarious! Our driver was Captain Obie Have! He played all kinds of music and told corny jokes that were funny because they were so corny, and he made fun of people on the street and on the duck. He was all excited because the Blue Angels were flying into Seattle for an airshow that weekend, and we actually saw them fly in on our tour!! It was great! We were bitter though because you don’t get the quackers for free…you have to pay $2! What a ripoff, they give ‘em out for free in Branson, MO!!!             Then we rode the trolley back to the water front and ate at Red Robin’s before heading to the aquarium, which was a huge disappointment. The tour guides at the space needle hyped it up, saying they had an octopus there (the largest octopi in the nation live in the Sound…they can get up to 16ft!)..but it’s just a puny one, and nothing else there is very impressive…including the IMAX theatre which shows the eruption of Mt. St. Helens---BIG LET DOWN! By then It was getting late and we were tired, so we headed back to Bremerton. The shuttle ride home was cool though, we took some really neat pictures of the Seattle skyline.  THURSDAY:             We picked Libby up at 7am and headed to IHOP for a disappointing breakfast. Then we went back to the apartment to pack for a two day jaunt up to Vancouver, BC. That was a long drive, and we got a hotel and were headed downtown for the evening for dinner and sightseeing. That town smelled like vomit that whole night! Ick! It was pretty neat though. The lookout tower is a cheap imitation of the Space Needle though. Drama happened that night too…my bank card didn’t work. It caused a huge panic attack and I was so worried about money that night that I didn’t have much fun. I guess it was just because I was in Canada that it didn’t work…but it was upsetting. The next day was much better.  FRIDAY:             It rained all day, so it didn’t smell anymore, thank god! We headed back downtown to Gastown, a famous historic neighborhood in Vancouver. We looked around at a bunch of shops and went something called a “Storyeum”. It was a museum, but also a theatrical show. It told the history of BC through several different sets and actors all the way from glaciers to modern day. It was really interesting and I’d never seen anything like it before. We had lunch at “The Old Spaghetti Factory” in Gastown, which I guess is pretty famous, and good food too. Then we were headed over to Chinatown, but we passed some scary homeless people and a bad part of town and so we decided to head back to the hotel and get the car and head to the Capilano Suspension bridge and tree-top adventure.             That place was friggin’ awesome! They had one big suspension bridge and then a bunch of wooded trails which lead to these tree houses. Then there are suspension bridges that hang 12ft high from cedar tree to cedar tree! We took a bunch of neat pictures, went across them twice and called home from one of the tree-houses! We got back late Friday night and headed to bed.  SATURDAY:             We packed for another 2 day jaunt to the Olympic National Forest and the coast. That was another long drive. We didn’t get to the forest until 4pm, but that was alright. It was the Hoh Rainforest, one of the older forests in the park. The had three different trails and we took the short and the intermediate one and saw some cool trees and the rapids. We also saw a herd of Elk! We could hear them rustling the trees far off, and were looking through several trees to see them. Then, we came around a bend in the trail and there was one right in front of us! We could have touched it!! IT was humongous though so we didn’t..lol. We just took lots of pictures. Then we got a little silly and pretended to be on “The Lord of the Rings” except everytime Libby said she was one of the female characters so she could get it on with one of the hotties, Mary would say she was said hottie and it ruined it! LoL. Then we headed back to our Hotel in Forks, WA and were all excited for a heated outdoor pool only to find that it was out of order! We hate you forking FORKS! So we went to  this pizzeria for dinner, but I didn’t feel well, so it turned out I paid $6 for a single bite of pizza. Ugh. We made it an early night in Forks so we could head to the beach in the morning.  SUNDAY:             We were so excited for the beach. We shaved, got swimsuits on and blasted out the Beach Boys in the car on the way. BUT when we got there, the beach was no sunny, tanning, spend all day at the beach kind of beach. It was rocky and a little cold. The rocks were neat and there were lots of little rocky islands around, but it was a bit of a let down. So we spent a little bit of time there and decided to hit the road and stop at a few wineries on the way. FUN! Good wine, good friends, good times! We bought tons of wine between the three of us and got back to Bremerton about 7.             We got our bags organized so that we would be ready to leave for the airport the next morning and headed to a Mexican restaurant for dinner before going into Seattle to pick up Joe who had been visiting his girl over the weekend. BUT WHO was standing outside the restaurant? None other than JD. I think he saw us though, because he quickly got into the cab that was sitting at the curb and the cab didn’t leave because they were waiting for JD’s friend who must’ve been in the bathroom. Scaredy Cat! Ha!             On the way to the airport to pick up Joe, the sun was setting, but through the trees I saw a huge snow capped mountain that could have been nothing but Mt. Rainier! All week long Libby had been saying that it had to be totally clear to see it, and that they only saw it a few days a year. But I kept asking about it, so they didn’t believe me Sunday night when I said I saw it. We asked Joe when we picked him up and he went, “Yeah, that probably was Mt. Rainier!” HA! I was right! We got back to the apartment LATE that night and had to get up at the butt crack of dawn to get Libby to work and us to the ferry station.  MONDAY:             Yeah, the night before was way short and we were TIRED that morning. Mt. Rainier was still there that morning, beautiful as ever! Libby got us to the ferry station, and I was sad to have to say such a quick good-bye because she had to get to work. I won’t see her now until Christmas, or maybe even New Years.              Mary and I were there like 5 minutes before the 6:20am ferry was going to leave. We didn’t HAVE to catch it, but we figured since we were there, we would. But that meant we had to practically run with our heavy bags. NOT A GOOD IDEA. My ankle decided to give out on me on the ramp to the ferry. OUCH! A nice man picked my bags up and helped me up and rolled them onto the ferry for me though. How friendly they were in Seattle! The ferry to the airport was great because Mt. Rainier was with us the whole way. It was even there when we were on the plane. What a way to bid us farewell Washington!

						   Well, I haven't been so great about keeping up here...vacation is part of why I haven't posted, but no excuses really other than that. Am working on  a large Seattle/Home post. Ah well.  You can really learn a lot about yourself by looking through your cd's. I've been doing a lot of that the past two days. In the process of uploading songs from my cd colleection to my computer, I've discovered that my favorite type of music must be "adult alternative/contemporary" (that is according to real1player of course), and my favorite band must be Blessid Union of Souls considering I have so many of their cd's and have chosen to upload so many of their songs. I've also learned that my cd collection is incredibly out of date...a lot of 1995-1999. Apparently I stopped buying cd's when I came to college. Hmmm...wonder why?
