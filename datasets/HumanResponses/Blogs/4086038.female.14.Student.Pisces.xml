      Is it wrong to fall in love with someone that i've loved before? I mean, it's hard to love someone that i've loved for so long and then I find out that he doesn't love and I have to get over him. But now it seems that it's all coming back again.  As much as I want to erase this feeling, I can't. It's hard. It's hard to pretend to be fine when you get hurt all the time. You feel really bad when he's around someone else. It's hard. It's hard to get hurt. It really is...  How will I ever erase this feeling. I want it to end. I want not to love him so that I won't punish myself like the way I did before. I want to be able to love someone else and I want that someone else to love me back.    I've been in love, a time or two. I've seen the world but not with you. I wanna fly and spread my wings. Don't wanna cry, I wanna sing. I wanna live and take a chance.  I'm not afraid to love again. I wanna fall, fall for you, AND I WANT YOU TO FALL FOR ME TOO.

      Well, maybe this is when things are finally looking up for me.  I feel a whole lot better now. I feel, like maybe, things  CAN  get back to normal. Maybe I can go back to being as happy as I was before. Maybe, I can forget everything and be me again, and be happy again. Maybe God has put me through this test to see how far I can go. For me to grow and to see that there are other things in life that I should be happy about.  I thank god for everything. For making me learn a valuable lesson... thanks.   "I don’t have everything.  And I definitely can’t have everything.  Pero astig parin kasi aliw ang buhay..."  - urlLink Chio   so true... so true...  and now, I'll go back to what can be my old life, and move on... and continue to grow. Because life is a challenge. And the challenge isn't over yet... it's just beggining...Ü

      How come days go by without anything significant happening in it? How come everything seems so... blank... so plain... so... boring? If my day today was a movie, it would be the lamest thing EVER.  I've been wanting to rant about this ever since that "incident". I mean, I seem so distant. I dunno. It seems like i've been going farther and farther away from my barkada. I feel like i'm not having fun anymore. Nothing's been the same since what happened. I am not going to brief again because just reliving the memory is hard and painful. Why has God given me this obstacle in life? Why am I going through all this pain. Why did it have to me my bestfriends, the one I trust my life with to be taken away from me? Why did it have to be the people who I love and trust so much to be the ones who are growing more distant to me? I don't know if I can still take this. There's always this deep feeling inside me... This sinking feeling. I just wish this will end. God please help me get through this.  Please...

      Argh... I feel like shit right now. I feel like vomiting but there isn't anything inside my stomach so so much for vomiting. My life is sooo... blank... I dunno... argh  I'm really glad that people DO care for me and they care for me ALOT. Just really grateful because I still have a reason to live in this crazy world.  Still feel like shit. Have to lay down and rest. Still have lots of homework... oh fuck... gotta go anyway...  PARDON MY CUSSING... JUST FEEL REALLY BAD RIGHT NOW
