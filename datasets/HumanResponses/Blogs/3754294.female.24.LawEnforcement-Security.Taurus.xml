      I borrowed this from my favorite poetry site... It is actually very hard to come up with 10 things most people don't know about you. It requires much self reflection.     1. I am a Taurus, as stubborn as they come. This is good, in that I achieve what ever I set my mind to, but bad in that I would argue with a fence post, sometimes even when I know I am wrong...   2. I have moved more times than I care to count, but I have been stationary for 4 years now (time to pull up the roots and go)   3. I am a perfectionist, everything that I do, I want it done right, and not just right but the best that I can do... Not to be confused with obsessive compulsive... My room stays a mess until the weekend!   4. I have a butterfly tattoo on my inner hip area of my right leg... My best friend in highschool (god that was 6 years ago) drew it and I colored it. His only masterpiece to be on display anywhere    5. I have had three knee surgeries, and they said I will never run again, and that I may walk with a limp. (this goes back to #1) well the more they say "can't" the harder I will push. I have only been off crutches for three days and already I have almost no limp.   6. I have loved and lost, four long years ago, and he is the one my poems are still about. I let him go... He who shall never be named... I miss him everyday.   7. My favorite pass time is going to the gun range and tearing up the black bullseye in my target... (she has a dark side!)   8. I like chick flicks when I am sad... But don't tell anyone else okay?   9. I also love the rain, sleeping in the rain is the best, I have showered naked in the rain, after a day of fishing, at 03:30 AM... On a deserted peninsula with "he who shall never be named..." That is quit possibly my fondest memory. We danced while watching the lightning out over the ocean.   10. I am deathly afraid of spiders. I freeze when I see them, I can't move, then I can't breathe... Florida has huge spiders called wood spiders, they are the worst. They chase you, I swear they are all trying to eat me. They are big enough to take the can of bug spray away.   and for a bonus...  11. I was born with my ring finger, and my bird finger stuck together on my left hand.  Yep, they were separated when I was two.  They grafted skin from my leg, (my inner thigh to be specific) and now that leg skin still grows hair... How gross is this?  I shave between those fingers, just like I shave my legs!  Disgusting!  (I feel so exposed now, no one knows this.)

      Sorry if this offends anyone, but this is my blog, and these are my thoughts!  Has anyone ever noticed that men are intimidated by women that are intelligent?  I am learning this as I go.  I really don't understand why, you would think that they would appreciate being able to hold an intellegent conversation.    For example:  A guy walks up to you in a bar, or anywhere for that matter, I mean face it your female, you have tits, (yes I said tits,) so it is inevitable that they will come.  But as soon as you open your mouth, it is like, oh well that rules her out.  Let them find out that you are more than a pretty face, blonde hair, and a nice rack, or even a not so nice rack, and wow!    Then I am told (by an older male friend) that I intimidate men, because I am so independant.  Well, since that is a downfall, let me just run out, quit my job, and become uneducated so that I can completely depend on a man for my every need.  NOT!    So let me get this straight, I dress nice for work, make enough money to support myself, am not a weepy emotional dependant woman, and have a high IQ, and these are all down falls, traits that men avoid?      I just don't get it...    These are the rational thoughts of the writer, not to be forced on innocent readers, if by chance you are offended by these thoughts, quit reading them.

      Explanation: I started thinking this poem up the first time I saw the movie, and finally 8 years later I put the Idea on paper. This is a tribute to my favorite movie, a story of the truest form of love, yet not chick flick. Mel Gibson's  BraveHeart . Please let me know what you think...      A Thistle she gave him with thorns on its stem.  A symbol of love, a tribute to him.   His loss ran deep like the strong currents tide.  It was then he knew their fate was tied.   Apart for years, his heart did not forget.  After all this time, straight to her he went.   That Thistle he dried, with thorns on its stem.  A symbol of love, to her from him.   Married in secret, their love they did hide.  Only in God did they dare to confide.   They killed her to get to him.  and this would be their gravest sin.   He led his men, his sword held high.  With all his heart he questioned why.   His strength and courage held steadfast.  Their will for freedom had a massed.   He flung his sword unto the field.  Victory for Scotland, England yield.   He fought in her memory, he knew she'd see.  He died loving her, their spirits were free.   You see she was the Thistle and he was the Thorn.  And obviously their love was forlorn.   She was the beauty and he was the strength.  And they are together forever in length.   ~H~

      I told the DJ to go have Arial intercourse with an osculating pastry… in other words, “Go take a flying F*** with a rolling donut…” probably not the most tactful way to handle it.&nbsp; He turned out, Surprise, surprise, to be an enormous arss.&nbsp;   I have yet to chip away some of the ice surrounding my heart, guess that is why they say “cold hearted B****.”&nbsp; It is better this way, I let no one in and no one hurts me.&nbsp; I feel inspiration for a poem coming on!&nbsp; If nothing else came of it, that (inspiration) in and of it self is good!&nbsp;   When one aspect of life is, for lack of a better word, off, why is it that the rest seem to follow suit?&nbsp; I think I am mildly depressed.&nbsp;   I hate fake people, why put up a façade?&nbsp; If you don’t like someone, be courteous to them, but don’t hug their neck when they are they, and talk smack when they are not.&nbsp; There is nothing I hate more than syrupy concern from someone that you know is betraying you!&nbsp;   And why is it that someone says they are there for you, good or bad, but when the slightest shadow of bad rounds the corner, suddenly there is no one backing you up?&nbsp; No one really wants to know the bad!&nbsp; They just say it because it sounds good? Again why put up a façade?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I will end with my favorite quote… because when all else fails, I find strength in words.&nbsp; &nbsp;  “Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers, but fearless in facing them, Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain, but the heart to conquer it.”  ~~Rabindranath Tagore~~

      Grrrrr..... It is funny how one day I can be going to an Evanescence concert (which was the most awesome experience ever) and loving life one day, and the very next be completely run over with financial responsabilities...  First let me start off with the positive!&nbsp; Evanescence rocked, totally!&nbsp; I enjoyed the entire evening!!!&nbsp; I was kind of upset that a new found friend withdrew at the last minute, but I understand her reasons, and wish her the best of luck in dealing with her traumas, which right now make mine seem like meer whining... (puts it in perspective)&nbsp; I want her to know that I am here if she needs someone to listen, as a shoulder if she needs to cry, she can scream, stomp, throw a hissy fit, what ever will ease her pain, I am here girl!   Kay, back to the concert... we ended up taking someone I didn't know, who in turn didn't know Evanescence, that blew my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he didn't truely appreciate her music, but I think he had a good time anyways.&nbsp; The concert was like 4 hours, my throat is still sore from screaming.&nbsp; Afterwards we went downtown Orlando to One Eyed Jacks, a bar with a live band... We, well two of us, danced, and we all drank and had a good ole time!&nbsp; Arriving home at 5 am the next morning I was loving life!&nbsp;   Well, upon waking up at noon (I took an annual leave day) I went into my&nbsp;office to catch up on some paper work.&nbsp; I have been behind since my grandmother had been in the hospital.&nbsp; In balancing mycheck book, and going through my paid bills (waiting to be filed)&nbsp; I noticed that I had no payment for one of my monthly bills, I immediately call to find out if this is so, and I now have a 40$ late fee... for a five day&nbsp;late charge...&nbsp;Again, looking at my check ledger I realize that my car insurance is being automatically deducted the day before payday (with not enough money in my account since I just paid summer and fall tuition.) I move funds from my almost nonexsistant savings account, and whew that went okay.&nbsp;   My anniversary date is listed wrong where I work, I went full time in&nbsp;July&nbsp;when I started, but they weren't sure if they were&nbsp;going to keep me where I was or&nbsp;give me a promotion.&nbsp; So they waited to move my status to full time, UNTIL OCTOBER.&nbsp; For three years now, I have been getting screwed out of like 3 months of&nbsp;raise.&nbsp; On top of this, they raised the starting pay of the position I had before I got the promotion, and they now make the same thing I do and I have been here three years, and I am&nbsp;cross trained.&nbsp; Well just between me and the internet, I am going to put out applications.&nbsp; I may wait until I graduate in&nbsp;December, but I am putting at least one in now.&nbsp; I have had it, I am tired of living pay check to pay check.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am done ranting for now, I can't stand being dependant on anyone...&nbsp; I hate not being&nbsp;monitarly&nbsp;stable, it affects every&nbsp;aspect of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always in the back of your mind, nibbling away at what&nbsp;little sanity you have left!&nbsp;   ~H~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Boy I am just full of inspiration today... My best friend, and dearest relative, has taken a bold step in gaining some confidence in himself... By no means is he a wuss or anything, he just seems to believe that his life is uneventful,&nbsp; boring, and that his problems don't Merritt by comparison.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the opposite actually... I am interested in what he has to say, what he thinks, how he feels... I would like to know his opinion on everything!&nbsp; Well I&nbsp;for one would like to know that he is not a robot... (LOL) Humans are supposed to share their problems with one another, no matter&nbsp;how&nbsp;catastrophic or&nbsp;insignificant that problem may seem... I am ready to be here for&nbsp;him, as he has&nbsp;always been here for me, if he is ready to open up!&nbsp; This for you pal!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I'm happy for him, that he's found someone, to finally share in his woes.  I'm just sorry you see, that it couldn't be me, who set his spirit free.  It's about time that he realized, you don't always have to be strong.  A listening ear, some one to hear, those things in which he fears.   He needs to confide, like others have in him, his innermost thoughts and doubts.  An outlet for pain, a play in the game, keeps one from going insane.  I'm just relieved, between you and me, that someone could pull him out.  Of the shell that he hides, when it's just a good lie, and thus he tries to deny.   I know that he's strong, as any man should be, so sharing these demons won't hurt.  A wave of relief, a strong belief, that again his spirit is free.  I am wondering why, in realizing that the world won't bite, it took him so very long.  Inspiringly, his spirit is free, and the rest will follow in creed.   He has always just been there, unwaveringly so, for everyone who needed him.  The favor is returned, no one will be burned, understand now it is his turn.  To lean on them, who hes kept from crumbling, and be held steadfast in their love.  It means the world to me, that he pursues his destiny, and that his spirit has been set free.

      I needed to vent, didn't want to bother anyone with my innermost turmoil's, and though I am strong I am still human... I wish to be over these things once and for all.&nbsp; Do they ever go away?&nbsp; Will the past, that was not my fault, haunt me forever?&nbsp; My current living situation is not helping things.&nbsp; I love my mother, and she needs my help both financially and emotionally, to help her deal with her side of the issues.&nbsp; I don't deal with things as she does...&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't know&nbsp;how anybody that has been dealt a&nbsp;second chance at happiness, can overlook all the positive things in their life, and dwell only on the negativity of the past... But that is a constant reminder to me, and it is not healthy.&nbsp;   I don't know if this constitutes a poem or not, but I do know it came from my heart.&nbsp; It doesn't&nbsp;rhyme, but it does have a certain flow.&nbsp; Again,&nbsp;I am tired of hiding from it,&nbsp;it is past time to air it out and let it heal!&nbsp; The he in these&nbsp;writings are a multitude of hes... There were three, a babysitter, a step father, and my father...&nbsp;all just icing on the cake... &nbsp;   I am a product of my surroundings.  He beat me and I am tougher.  He raped me and I value innocence.  He degraded me and I refused to believe.   She was weak, and fell into a depression  That she never quite escaped.  I watched and I am stronger.  I experienced first hand, the effects  that one persons chemical dependency  can have on an entire family.   I will not make those mistakes,  I refuse to succumb to those ultimate  WEAKNESSES   I hurt too, but I channel those pains  to bettering myself.  I could sit here feeling pity,  but I still see where that leads,  NOWHERE   I feel an empty anger  at the weakness of others.  If I can prevail why can't she?  My hell was far worse than can be imagined  I was a child, innocent, in every meaning of the word  They were supposed to protect and love me,  but I do not question why.  I do not wish that these events never transpired  They played an important role in making me who  I am.&nbsp;   I am dealt adversity, and I will win my hand.  I am&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Meaningless words appear before my cursor.&nbsp; Flowing from my fingertips, like water from a fountain, until it dries up.&nbsp; Then the cursor blinks annoyingly awaiting my pounding fingers.&nbsp; Deadlines, boring books, word requirements... I love writing but not under these circumstances.&nbsp; My words as dull as those I've been forced to read... And I hate it, I can't add flair or beauty, it must be factual.&nbsp; Long, Drawn out, Dull... Worse than snow turned gray on the side of the road, on the most bitter day of the winters cold.&nbsp; So how do I overcome writers block, when it is my mind that is blocking?&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Okay, jeeze!&nbsp; I said I was going to start dating again, but I didn't take out an ad on the evening news... Very few people have this link... Do I have a sign on my back that says hey I'm easy hit on me?&nbsp; I mean come on... I said date not F***... there must be something in the air.  I am being hit on by a married ICU nurse, with two children.&nbsp; He is trying to buy his way into my bed, offering to pay for memberships to the gym, and victoria secret sets... Just wait till my Mema is out of that hospital... I am going to tell him where he can shove it!&nbsp;   On a more positive note, I was listening to the radio the other night and on comes this song that really touched me.&nbsp; It was in a battle (I guess against another new song) so I called the radio station to vote.&nbsp;(which I NEVER do)&nbsp;The song is called,  Broken  by Seether and Amy Grant...&nbsp;and this DJ answers the phone... We got to talking and didn't get off the phone until 0130 in the morning.&nbsp; This is like 3.5 hours of conversation with a guy I have never met.&nbsp; He went on vacation for a week, but called me the next day to say good bye, and asked me to dinner... So I have set myself up for a blind date of sorts... I checked the web site for the station and he seems like a nice guy... WOW... Guess I still got game...   It has been almost eight months since I last went on a date, and I find it hard not to immediately shut him, any him for that matter, out... Why is it that I can be Friends with males, but when it comes to letting them in... Letting them get to know me, that I find it impossible to chip the ice away from my heart.&nbsp;   I would love nothing more in this world than to smile, and mean it... I don't mean the hollow smile that I show the world, I mean the one that comes from the inside... The one I can feel start in my toes, and work all the way up through my heart, to my face...   (maybe some relief of the sexual frustration would help hehehe, see there I go again making light of how I feel... It is all about image and no one wants to see the darker side of things... So you leave your baggage in the closet and act as though everything is okay... There is the reason the ice won't melt... I don't, can't, won't&nbsp;trust... With out trust no relationship will work.)&nbsp;    Please excuse the ramblings... I am trying to deal with many emotions as well as frustrations and this just seemed to flow from my finger tips...

      I will not be able to post for a while, as we rushed my Mema to the hospital on Tuesday at 4 am, and I have been there pretty much ever sense.&nbsp; Aside from work yesterday and today, I have had zero access to the internet, and even less sleep...&nbsp; I miss writing, I miss PA, I miss IM, but more than any of this I miss my Mema being okay.&nbsp; She is pretty stable as far as being in ICU goes, but she is not out of the woods yet.&nbsp;  &nbsp; As you can tell from my darker poetry, I didn't have the best of childhoods.&nbsp; I think everyone needs someone to love them, just as they are, to spoil them, to hold them special in their hearts, to try to protect them from every thing dark.&nbsp; My Mema and Papa were my safe haven, my escape from an other wise cruel world.&nbsp; He is my hero, and she the voice of reason in my head.&nbsp; Tuesday morning these roles were reversed.&nbsp; I became my Papa's pillar of strength, and became my Mema's care giver/ gaurdian.&nbsp; My mother was a mess, and I had never seen my Papa cry untill that day.&nbsp; I was unable to show weakness for fear that their worlds would crumble.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside I was sobbing to see them both so weak,&nbsp;Papa emotionally and Mema physically. &nbsp;  I am a firm believer in prayer, so If you pray please say one for us, and if not keep us in your thoughts and keep your fingers crossed!&nbsp;

      It hides among the shadows of my memories tucked back. It burrows deep among them, acting like I'm in denial.   Haunting me as time goes by, those memories of old. It creeps behind my every smile, behind every sun that sets. Daring me to be weak, so those horrors will be told.  I am strong, I am brave, and I fight it every day. Crushing power, keeping secrets silently locked away.  It waits patiently in me, weighing down my soul. I dare not confide because, I blame myself, who else? Somehow I’ll be labeled evil, tainted in someway. A war surges up inside me. Do I hate him or do I hate me?  It is the past that refuses to succumb to history. I fight it everyday, it is just a part of me.  It is my ghost. It is my past.  But is it really my fault?

      I decided to stop dating over seven months ago.  This was due to a strenuous work/ school schedule, and an imposing knee surgery.  Well, that semester has ended, work is back to normal, and I am over my knee surgery, so I have no more excuses.  And although I am content being single, I am also lonesome.  I miss certian things about being in a relationship.  Communication, trust, companionship... sex... I miss having someone to back me up, and being able to return the favor.  I miss being held at night.  I miss the kisses for no good reason.  I miss working on a car together.  I do not miss him, I miss the idea of him.  I look back, and I realize that I have felt this way for more than four long years.  I have had many relationships since then, but all have been empty.  I don't even give them a chance to get close.  I will find any reason to throw them back... It is time to move on.  I have got to let go.  I cannot let his ghost rule my life any longer.  I am not going to go jumping into anything, but I am not going to shut men out anymore.  I am sure that if "he" walked back into my life, I would stick with my decision to leave.  I made the right choice so why can't I let go???  Well, here goes.

      I am finally getting away from it all.  I need to get away, I need to give Mom some time to let it all sink in.  She took it way too personally.  She asked me "why are you doing this to me?"  like I was trying to hurt her... not that I was just taking a step in my life, and how about how I feel?   I told her a year ago that I was thinking of moving, and that if things didn't change that I was going.  I wanted to help her, I tried to help her.  I tried everything, talking about it, not talkign about it, yelling about it, crying about it.  Nothing helps.  I don't understand.  What is so wrong with our lives that she has to be drunk all the time?  I can understand not wanting to deal with the past, but it is time to get over it.  Her past was self inflicted, I didn't ask to be born... I didn't ask for them to be my parents.  Now that we have been given a second chance at being a family, all she cares about is seeing the bottom of her glass.   I have lived here four years.  That is four years longer than we had.  Now we have a good realtionship, and I love my mom.  I am going to be 25 this year, I am ready to spread my wings.  Instead of helping me, she is going to shut me out and this hurts.  She compared me to my father, in that I am abandoning her just like he abadoned us.  I am moving like 27 miles away.  I am not shutting her out of my life, I want her to help make these decisions, I want help picking out curtians, and bathroom stuff, and I know this is not going to happen...  (indulge me for a second) I see how my cousins family is reacting.  (we are romming together)  I wish my family was as good as his.  His fathers response, well we have five trucks, and plenty of hands... I know his mom will help... how cool is that.  A family that functions, a father, a mother, brothers.... Support in lifes choices.   Why is it that life is so hard?  My road seems to pretty bumpy, with rocks, huge hills, pot holes, and Charlie left a huge ditch... I think I might need to build a bridge to get across it.   My head hurts from thinking about it.  And then she has the audacity to tell me I can't take MY dog... because she loves him... MY dog, what the hell is that.  Then she says what if I quit drinking and start smoking out side, I said it would have to be done now, I can't wait till January one to get an apartment.  That is four and ahalf months... I don't see it happening.  She tells me that she is going to do it, but not today.  She was shit faced tonight, and passed out so cold she hasn't stirred in hours.  I gave her an excuse to use no moderation basically.  Everything is an excuse to drink.  She never feels good anynmore, so she never does anything in the house, she is always just sleeping on the couch, or drinking in her chair.  She said she was going to finish the beer she has, and quit when that is gone.  Why pur off to tomorrow what you can do today.  I quit smoking with three packs of cigarettes in the refridgerator... anything is possible when you set your mind to it.  She won't quit until she is ready to quit, and there is nothing that I can say or do that is going to change this.  I have come to accept it.     I have made up my mind that I am moving, it is the next chapter of my book, and that is that.  I talked to my grandparents and they approve, they want me to stay in Williston, but they understand why I am moving.  I don't see us staying in Williston.  Mom tried to say that Mema told her and that she doesn't want me moving.  Mema told me that she wouldn't stay.  SO I think she was just stabbing in the dark.     I am looking forward to Kayaking, being on the water, away from it all will make it all better.  I am not trying to burry my head in the sand, but a vacation from life would be nice.  I can't wait.  I am also looking forward to church tomorrow, I need a spiritual cleansing too!  I think He has the power to ease it off.  I have asked Him to make her better, to giver her the strength through Him to quit... I have prayed on it... but I guess He has His own plan.  I have got to get going now, got a little packing that still needs to be done, and I need to check some things on PA before I go.     TTFN I will take plenty of pictures and have lots of good stuff to post when I get back...

      I thought this one would be a long one, and we shall see.  I am not sure I feel like really getting into it yet.  My eyes still burn, and my head is pounding, my face is still all puffy, and I think there are more tears in there...   I wish this was easy.  I don't understand why this has to be a big deal, as though I am trying to hurt her by moving.  Why would anyone want to shut someone out of their lives, just because that person is trying to take the next step in their life?  Why is it that I am the perfect daughter so long as I do things the way she sees fit... I am simply trying to spread my wings, and she is trying to pluck my feathers... and it hurts.  I don't feel like writing any more right now... I will have to get into it later.  I am still letting every thing sink in.

         It calls to me, echoing in my heart Desire to be freed from the chains of society Go back, out there, to where the cycle starts Where refreshing are the sights and sounds  Cool, crisp, water slaps upon my oars, As my kayak slides across the surface Calm is the water against the shores Quite is the whispering tickle of the wind.  Peace and solace in the world of nature Sooths and pacifies this turbulent soul Thoughts of a whim in my mind mature As the wild birds sing to their mates  A happy rain dances across the surface As the sun shines through the clouds Glide through the water with a visible trace Though the ripples will soon be erased  Cool raindrops splash into the water And cover me in sparkling apparel A loving embrace as that of a mother Washing away the wear of the day  All evidence of my presence here In this world apart from mine Passes behind me as I steer And dwindles as I paddle on  The harsh relentless worries of reality Are gently lifted from my shoulders While this glittering water is surrounding me I am at peace with myself once more  The musical rhythm of the oars The pleasant burn in my muscles The beauty of the eagle that sores The picturesque perfect of this day  The sun sinks lower on the horizon Painting a sky full of vivid color Throwing in the water a million diamonds As the kayak pushes up on the shore  The sun says this day is near an end My heart says it will live forever The peacefulness has set a trend All evidence of my presence is gone Except what remains in my memory.

       My body quivers from your caress, Your warm sweet breath on my cheek. Your fingertips trace along my breasts, The pulse quickens in my chest.  You nibbled softly on my ear, Sending chills along my spine. I sighed loud enough for you to hear, Losing you is lust's worst fear.  Your hands explored my aching needs, Longing, Passion, Lust, and Sin My hungry moan sounds near a plea, I know that you will take the lead.  I beseech your body to take me, The desire has consumed. I need to feel your ecstasy, Quench my insatiable anxiety.  The eager rising of my hips to meet, Your hands upon my thighs. The moister of my essence greets, Match your strong erotic beat.  Your tumescence touches my inner core, As our enmeshed bodies turn. The pillows fall unto the floor, You leave me wanting more.  Smiling, amused, I open my eyes, Lust's worst fear comes true. You were not there to my surprise, My loneliness is my demise.  It was a dream, you were not real, I hide my disarray. There was no touch, I could not feel. The lingering ghost of you.

      Okay the closer Friday draws, the more sure I become of my decision to move out.  I am sure that this is the chapter in my little book of life.  I have considered it for a year and a half now, I have thought on it, prayed on it, weighed the pros and cons of it, and I am certian that this is what I want to do.   However, the closer Friday draws, the worse I sleep.  I keep replaying all the different ways this conversation could go.  I imagine the easy way out, in that I don't even mention the real reasons that I am moving... but that just wouldn't be honest, and dishonesty is not in my nature.  More than anything I want her to get better, and I don't think that is going to happen with out a serious change.  Maybe this will worsen it, but on the flip side, perhaps this is simply what she needs to be nudged in the right direction.  The point is, that it is tearing away at my soul.  Today is my final, and including this sentence, I have thought about that for a total of maybe three minutes.  Now those of you who know me, are asking what hospital do I need to be rushed to.  It is just not like me not to sweat my finals, or any test for that matter.   This is ruling my thought process.   Well that and my throbbing knee.  I twisted the hell out of my knee this morning.  I actually had to go home and change shoes to help ease it off!  I will live, but I am starting to wonder if my knee is ever going to heal right, you would think three surgeries would fix it...  I am applying for a part time bartending job toningt.  I hope I get it, keep your fingers crossed.  I think it will be a good way to 1) earn a little extra money to save for January 2) get me out of the house a little more and 3) a way to meet more people.  Who knows... I can't remain a cold hearted bitch forever... LOL  One of my friends called me a LIT... (lesbian in training) I didn't think it was all that funny... but you can call me anything you want, School and work are first in my life right now, in an essence I am putting me first for the first time in my life, and it takes sacrafice.  I think that it is totally worth it!!

       I have a final on Wednesday so I won't be on much till after that. Then it will be all over with, Until the 24th when the vicious cycle starts all over again and with trigonometry at that.       I think I will tell mom on Friday night. *gulp* This will give her a week to cool down, which is good. I expect yelling, and crying, and guilt trips, and ultimatum, and god knows what else. I also expect to address the drinking issue. The fact that the only reason she is a functioning alcoholic right now is (as my rock put it) because I am there to pick up the pieces, and make it look like it is functioning. It really bothers me that I can't fix this. That I can't make it better. No matter what I do, I can't help. It is something she will have to do for herself.       I have already started saving for January. I have my pet deposit already to go, and working on my security... :)       Well this is all for now. I will leave you with my favorite quote:      "To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wild flower. To hold infinity in the palm of your hand, an eternity in an hour"    William Blake~

       It weighs upon a heavy heart,    a shadow creeping from the dark,    reminiscent of the times of old,    the memories of things untold.       It haunts my every waking hour,    a captivating and hypnotic power.    An emptiness that's cold and deep,    void of trust and love complete.       Sorrow seen within mine eyes,    a glimpse of that which defies.    Alone I fight against a ghost,    the past is what I fear the most.       Until I break these chains that bind,    darkness in my heart you'll find.    Freedom on this day I seek,    from the past that's made me weep.       okay so I felt creative~

      I feel a bit silent today, as I reflect on my feelings. I had a good cry last night thanks to my rock. He just seemed to know I needed it, and drove around till it happened. I feel relieved that it is not all bottled up inside anymore, and I am able to think on things a little more clearly. I think I will tell her in two weeks, give her financial situation some time to get settled, and then talk to her about it.  I canceled my beach vacation, too expensive. I have been offered an opportunity to go to New York for a week, and am thinking of going. I have never taken a full week off from work before, nor have I ever been to New York... But the rational side of me says don't spend the money, save it for January when I move out. I dunno, perhaps I'll spend 50 bucks and get a membership to the pool, and save the vacation money for move in fees. Evil side of me says go, rational side says stay. Always an internal battle...  That is really all I feel like saying right now, I still have a lot of reflecting to do, and sometimes that is better done between me and the mirror. Uh - oh I feel a poem coming on.  I wanted to thank my rock, for gently nudging me when I needed it, and for listening when I needed it, and for becoming the shoulder (much softer than the rock) when I needed it. Everyone needs someone like that in their lives.

      So much to do, so little time! I need to study... I would love to have the time to sit down and write... I have so much to say to my blog, I need to clean house, my office (at home) is a disaster...  I have decided a couple of things: 1. I am going to rent Hidalgo on the way home and watch it tonight, and worry about everything else tomorrow. 2. I am going to take the time to write in my journal tonight... I don't care if it is the crappiest poem ever, I am going to put some thoughts on paper.  I am not sure what to do about something. I have decided to get an apartment with my cousin, best friend, like-a-brother, Larry.... As I mentioned before, I don't think my living arrangements are conducive to healing, but this is another topic. I don't want to hurt my mother, but I am twenty four, I moved in with mom 3.5 years ago to get my sh*t together. I had just come out of the relationship with "he who shall never be named" and lost my (would be) son     interrupted thought... Rant/   (his son who I had raised for 2.5 years, who called me momma, that pain is just as horrible as my biological child being still born, because I held him when he was sick, loved him always, taught him how to talk, walk and tie his shoes, how to throw a ball, and being of no actual relation, I never see him... I will always wonder... And pray that he is okay... okay I have issues with that back to what I lost...)  end rant/  my man, my home, my dog, my cat, our friends, my job (I had just injured my knee and have had three subsequent surgeries) and so on. I was at rock bottom. I needed to start over. Now for some very personal reasons, that I don't want to get into, I had not lived with my mother since I was 7... so I moved in with her (where I pay my own way) and we hit it off great. We were given a second chance at happy. Only I don't seem to make her happy. Anyways, I know that she is very happy to have me home, she is kind of clingy, which is okay. She doesn't boss me, as I am not a child, but she has her grip so tight her knuckles are white. You can't go back, I am never going to be seven again. Even now that I am home she still dwells on the past, and every time she picks up that can, or that bottle, I am reminded of it, the past I am trying to get over, there are corners of my life that I don't even allude to in my poetry. That is how deep it goes...  Point to all of this, and I swear there is one... It has bothered me for a long time, I mentioned to her a year ago that I was thinking of moving out when I graduated with my AA and moving to the town where I will be attending school with Larry. She flipped, promised to do better and then immediately forgot her promise. Then she tells me that she is depending on the money that I pay her, to get by. How can I live with myself, if this is true, and I think it is now that she changed jobs, she makes less... I am not giving her an ultimatum, I am moving out, but how do I tell her, what do I say. I am ready to stand on my own two feet again. I need to move on with my life. There is nothing but broken memories in the town that I live in. I am not running away, I am moving on! You put one foot in front of the other, and the next step will get you where you are goingb, right?  Am I a miserable daughter, abandoning her mother? Or is that mother always going to make me feel like this for trying out my wings? Is it ever going to be the right time? I hate to say it, but if it is this bad when I live with her, I hate to think what it will be when I leave.  I have sooooo much more going through me right now. I know that she lies to me. Stupid little things. Doesn't she realize that I have to love her, to have forgiven and come back? She doesn't need to lie, to make me like her better, or to cover for coming home early, I know she has a problem, and she knows I know... Don't lie to me. Me above all people she should be honest with! You have no idea how much this erks me. I have been there for her thick and thin, but then she will say the most bold faced lie, to my face.  I.E (this means example)... She told me that she went to the doctor, (on a day I knew she was at work, but hey okay, she could have had an apt. During the day) and that he found pre cancers on her female workings, and that he removed them. She didn't tell me for a week, but instead used that as an excuse to go on a week long binge (a week later.) and then said she had to get a historectomy in September... I mentioned it to her last week, and she said oh I probably won't get it done... (if this was cancer would you play games, fact being I knew she wasn't having it, because she never went to the doctor, I asked her who her doctor was and she said mine, funny, he doesn't know my mother) why make up these elaborate stories?  Now she has completely stopped doing all house work... She sweeps the kitchen everynow and then... I come home and she is either two sheets to the wind, or passed out in her chair. Great huh? But what do you do? This is my mother, and like it or not she has problems... I can deal with problems, but I can't deal with being lied to. She lies to everyone so why should I feel privlidged?  Okay... Those are just a few of the things going on in my head... in my home... And who said blondes couldn't be deep. I really don't know what to do. I feel almost guilty for wanting to try to start my life.  Thanks for reading, It helped just to get it down...

       I am so tired, and on the way to bed, I will post tomorrow, but I wanted to let yall know my good news. I just made moderator on Poetry Array... Which may not seem like a big deal, but I am completely new to the online community thing, and I really love it. I spend all of my free time there! I love to write, obviously, and PA helped to bring that back into my life.     The teacher still doesn't have our papers graded, nor our tests, so I am still biting my nails on this!!!!  I will hopefully know something on Monday.  I hate being up in the air.   I am going to bed now, more tomorrow... ;)   Good night all!

      *Bites nails* I have a test tonight... Studied some, okay for those of you who know me, I studied some, for those of you who don't some may be considered a lot... But I don't have that positive feeling I usually have before a test... Then I have my Final on the 11th.... That means I have two more classes to go over the rest of the material... I hate summer classes. Don't get me wrong, American history is not a bad subject... But we are going over a ton of material in a short time, less than 6 weeks. OUCH! *no nails left to bite, switches to lip*  I hope I get my paper back, I would feel better if I knew I had a good grade on it... (good by my standards means 90 and up) My stomach is doing it's flip flop thing as it always does when I get stressed... Having a nervous stomach is no fun...  I am going for now, I may or may not try to post more later, it depends on how upset I feel after my test... Keep your fingers crossed (while not typing, typing with crossed fingers is pretty difficult...)

      Darkness falls and swallows me no light that I can see  An endless cold resides within more bitter than an arctic wind  Empty sails on a windless sea no hope of ever sailing free  Imagined chains bind me here yet its not the end I fear  Happiness taunts my memory with pleasant thoughts I almost see  A moth's embrace is just like me drawn to false light illusions that I see  Fluttered wings leave dusty marks kisses on my soul naked I am stark  A deserts stretch my nubile pain dry and endless a vital drain  A lonely creature pull it in no one to share the gravest of all sin
