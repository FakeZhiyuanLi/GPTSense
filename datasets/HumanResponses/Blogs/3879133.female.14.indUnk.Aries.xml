      So, I'm sitting here at my computer thinking "What random topic should I bring up to talk about today ?  And then I heard it! On the radio... they played the song American Pie, and one part said...  "Even an Angel born in Hell couldn't save Satan's spell"  Well, if you truly want to know what that quote means, just think about it! I'm sure everyone has a different opinion on what it means, but if you ask me, it means that even through the bad you can find good.  My translation: "Even an evil person can't be all bad"  The day the music died... familiar words? They're also from the song American Pie.  Most people that aren't our parents don't really know what the day the music died means. Well, the day the music died is when 3 great singers died in a plain crash.  The were part of this concert thing, and they ended up canceling the rest of the shows because these guys were the main 3 singers.  I guess you learn something new everyday.  "Them good ol boys were drinkin wiskey and rye, singing this'll be the day that I die"  ... I guess even the best people can mess up though. So, if you think about it, no one is completely good, no one completely bad.  Whether you want to believe it or not, people mess up.  And believe it or not the worst of people can do some pretty good things.    Everyday people cam fimd the most interesting things in themselves

      My brother wrote this song... he doesn't know I read it lol. I found notebook in his room with drawings and songs and stuff... here's the song  I Wonder  Sometimes I wonder... If people really care about you.. Sometimes I wonder if you're actually free Sometimes I wonder if you changed you're name Would people like you better Sometimes I wonder if you're actually there  *Chorus* I walk up and down the streets Thinking about things that shouldn't be thought... All I remember is the time we fought All you do now is write dark poems All you do now is drink coffee without cream Now all you like is the color black Oh man, I want the old you back  You used to have 50,000 friends Adored the color pink You used to love everyone everything But now you are alone And on your own...  Now I... Yeah I...  I walk up and down the streets Thinking about things  That shouldn't be thought... All I remember is the time we fought All you do now is write dark poems All you do now is drink coffee with no cream Now all you like is the color black Oh man, I want the old you back  Yeah, you're so different You're someone else You're so different Love the color black I want the old you back  I walk up and down the streets thinking  About things that shouldn't be thought Do you remember the time we fought? Now all you do is write dark poems Drink coffe with no cream All you like is the color black Oh man, I want the old you back  Now al I do is sit here  And I wonder What changed you And I just wonder What happened    ~+*+_ Write a comment about what you think...

      Has someone ever done something, and you ended up getting blamed for it? Has someone ever asked you to do something for them, and then when you do it everyone gets mad at you... all because you did something nice for someone? It just doesn't make sence to me.       I mean, how long can someone take the blame for everything?  Everything always goes so wrong! I mean, my friend calls me up and asks me to tell ehr other friend something.  Well, I do it, and suddenly a few people are like "Why did you do that|? You just messed everything up!" I feel like saying, I'm not the one who messed everything up. I was doing something for a friend.       And then you have the nerveto say you never had me talk to the other person.  Hmmm... sounds kind of wierd to me... but thats life.       Drama.Love.Hate.Friendships made.Broken   One things to go by:      LiVe+LoVe+BuRn+DiE... the things that get done in a lifetime

      Today when I was out someone asked me what time it was. I lied and told them ikt was an hour and a half later then it really was, because I thought it was funny.  But then I really got to thinking, how would I feel if that was me there? I would be pretty mad at someone if they did that to me...           I could have ruined that persons whole day.  God tells us to treat our neighboors like we would like to be treated.  Well, I know God tried to make things good, but who actually treats everyone with the respect they would like?  If you find someone, tell me because I'd like to know. I mean... why are people such ass holes to people 'just because they don't like them'? Did they actually do something to you...            You could ruin someones life just by what you say.  Hakuna matatta... No worries for the rest of your life? How could you even think about never worrying about things? I mean seriously, no one is perfect. Everyone has their little mishaps and their own problems. If eveyone was perfect I think that the world would come to an end. People weren't meant to be perfect...            We are meant to have flaws.  Think about it: if no one is perfect including yourself, why do you make fun of people? Seriously, if people have problems, why do people make fun of others because they have different problems? Everyone goes through their own things. Some depression, some family issues, some  self concious issues...             No one has no problems in their life.  So, on that thought, next time you see someone, don't make fun of them. Say hi to someone you don't know. Compliment someone even if you don't like them...             The littlest things can make someones day.

      ... I don't live in the normal world. I live in a world I like to call, Kaitlyn's world.  A world where I always screw up. A world where nothing anyone does is ever right. Pretty much a world where you live a bad life until something amazing happens. Until that day when something walks into your life that changes everything. It doesn't just change the way you feel about things. But, it changes you as a whole.  One day that something walked into my life...  and I let it pass me.        I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for it  It's like you let one of the best opportunities you could ever had pass you by. It's like you're one person and in the snap of a finger you're someone totally different. It's like you believe in one thing.        But before you know it everything you believed in suddenly just stops being believable  No one knows the answer to life. But I know what I believe in. Before you can believe in anyone else, you need to believe in yourself. Sometimes you have to forget about other people, forget about their feelings, forget about anything and everything that is and isn't important to you. Because, once you know what and who you truly are. Nothing anyone else says matters.  All you have to do is  ~*+*__Believe that you can do anything
