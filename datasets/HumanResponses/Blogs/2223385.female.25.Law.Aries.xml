       well, we had a trip alright!  We got back yesterday afternoon and had a lovely dinner with craigs folks.  There were some really great moments during the last three days-- here were the highs:  surpisingly, the train ride both ways was easy, comfortable borderline fun.  Hanging out with trevor and amy was also a high.   The four of us together creates a great dynamic, and I am so glad they were there cause otherwise craig and I would have had a really bad/boring time.  Cotton candy at the carnival across the street, discount meds from canada, craigory,  watching a best friend get married, craig asking the WWII veteran if he was going to do a bomb defusing demonstration, and finally getting a king size bed that we asked for.  The lows of the trip?  having to sleep in a murphy bed friday night, craig getting mad at me for picking on his cufflinks, my poor friend (the groom) being very very ill on his wedding night, even lower low, the bride not caring that he was sick and hanging out at the bar, having an "attack" right before I had to get on the subway for 40 minutes (although  I took 8 lomotil-- so I was out of it mostly for the rest of the day).  There was one thing I haven't determined to be a high or low yet, I can't tell-- Craig catching the garter belt.  HA!!! what a freaking boce! he had to put it on the thigh of the sluttiest girl there.   So my sister and brother and niece are coming in to penn station soon, so I am going to pick them up.  good times.  My parents are also coming in today-- this afternoon.  So I am hoping that craig can get out early and convince his parents to come out with us.  Later! P.S.- I graduate tommorrow!

       so, I get on the train in less than two hours.  Believe me, I am well prepared, I have brought lots of (healthy) snacks, and some stress relief for craig and I if we need a break from studying.

       I have learned a couple of things from bar bri.  The most important thing I learned is that I don't know anything.  I suppose in theory I will have learned a few things by summer's end-- but who is to say?  So I have decided on clothing for my graduation and scott's wedding.  I ended up spending 18.00 dollars total (not including the shoes.  they don't count.  cause I said so, thats why).  I decided to be a little bit more frugal and I am going to wear a suit to my graduation that I already have (I just had to buy the shirt).  and for scotts wedding, I took the black dress I wore to craig's semi formal and I hemmed it up so that it is mid calf length and I sewed the slits together so that its more form fitting all the way down.  I must say, it looks quite cute, its a totally different look than with it floor length.  And I saved a bunch of money too (those dresses went back to bloomingdales--refund!).  all I had to buy for that outfit was a pink purse to match the pink shoes I will be sporting to dress it down a bit.  It works.   My IBS diet that I have started since this weekend has been so great to my belly.  Instead of having bowel troubles all morning for several hours-- I just feel badly when I first wake up and then I am ok.  I haven't had to get off the subway once to run for cover. . .AWESOME!!!  The only bad part is, this diet, well-- its really difficult, since I can't have any dairy- that means I can't have any cheese.  You don't really notice how many things have cheese in them until you can't eat it.  Just about every sandwhich, many pasta dishes have either cheese or cream, and a ton of snacky foods.  But hey-- if it makes me feel better--I don't care.  Especially since chocolate soy milk is so yummy.  I had dairy free mac and cheese today and it was-- well-- good enough to eat again, but nothing like the original (plus it costs twice as much).   Ok, I am off to my stress relieving jog-- I went on tuesday-- and I was so sore yesterday!!! Jogging outside instead of a treadmill makes a world of difference.  I can't even tell you! Ciao

       so I am feeling a little more at ease.  the weekend is approaching, and it will be really fun.  Craig and I are taking the train to dc to attend Scott's wedding, and we are going to hang out with amy and trevor as well.  they are so much fun together-- and then when you throw craig into the picture-- a pitcher of genny ice-- and you've got a party.  Look out gaithersburg maryland-- here we come.  Also, craig and I will have our first opportunity to go bowling together this weekend as scott has decided the first thing he wants to do after his wedding reception is-- no, not consumate the marriage-- but go bowling.  (thats my boy).  Craig, all I have to say is, I am going to whomp you with my particular talent of bowling in double digits under 60 :).  HEE!  So bar review is not as bad as my first impression led me to believe.  Im gathering my routine, and I am close to getting into a groove.  I think midway thru next week after graudation and all that hubalubub I will be a machine. This is my anticpated daily schedule-- class- jog-- study-- sleep repeat. I am going to get my hair colored this afternoon-- so please keep your fingers crossed that it will be ok.  I have great trust in my colorist michelle, but you never know when you are dealing with chemicals and hair.  Craig will be around after to take care of any crisis :)    ciao!

       I just have one question for you people out there in Lindsey's blog land.  Why is it that everyone has been so mean to me lately?  Friends, acquaintances, complete strangers.  It boggles my mind.  I haven't done anything to deserve it ( I don't think).  I guess 75% of it is that people act like that all the time and I don't usually care or I am not bothered by it.  But man-- some people.  I will give you a few examples.  Today-- I went to buy a bottle of water during a 10 minute break at bar review because I forgot mine at home.  so I go to the newsstand where they usually sell them for 1.00.  The poland springs small bottle.  so I give him a dollar and he is like dollar FIFTY.  I made a "whatever I can't believe its that expensive" face and handed him the money.  he starts asking me whether I was studying to be a lawyer, cause he saw my ID. and goes off on a rampage about how we all think price too high, but we should know. I said well, I just thought the price was high because I bought a bottle of evian for 1.50 (which is untrue, cause I paid 1.33) that is twice this size.  He, in response, yelled at me "EVERYONE KNOWS". yelled!!!  people around me were looking at me.  a girl behind me kept asking him for a water.  he ignored her, he was too busy yelling at me.   I had to just walk away or else he would have continued on and on.  I'm not really sure what everyone knows but me, but aparently-- I am out of the loop.  yesterday, some girl that I had met for the first time yesterday made a really inappropriately snarky comment to me.  we had been caught in a rain storm and my khaki colored skirt was soaked thru on the front (and see through-- which I was aware of), and the back had gotten really dirty from me running to cover. so I said, oh no, my skirt is all dirty.  She replies-- no, its fine-- I know cause I can see right thru it.  then starts laughing hysterically (along with my two friends who thought she was just hilarious).  this comment would have been fine if SHE were a friend, but I barely know the bitch.  UGH.  WHY?  I could list more and more examples but why bore you. this is what is going on in my life right now.

       you know, law school has been really tough-- I was thinking about it last night-- and it wasn't just because the four horsemen were mean to me.  I mean-- I had a professor that was trying to make me cry for an hour (MALICIOUSLY).  classes where the professor blatently favored calling onobnoxious males.  And the socratic method is a total waste of time-- thank god they don't use it much past first year.  I really can't understand why people really can't understand why people could possibly hate law school.   I mean, I am not saying law school has to suck for all people-- but there is a very small weird category of people who enjoy the set up of law school and find it rewarding.  For me, I think the whole set up is retarded.  Basing your entire career on ONE exam at the end of first year-- which is curved-- so only a cerain percentage can possibly even get in the top of the class is retarded.  Don't you think that firms really should disregard your first year grades-- and weight your upper level grades more heavily? I mean I did ok first year-- but I did really good the last two-- but the way it works out, I would have had to have gotten A;s in every class in order to reflect my true performance.  So stupid.  Well, its reassuring that I have a job though, which is more than I can say for a lot of my classmates.  Its even more reassuring that I have a job that when you account for living expenses would equal a six figure salary in NYC.  EAT THAT.  It was acutually a relief to be working in Bing-- the people at the firm are so much nicer thn any of the partners at the firms in NYC. ok, off to bar review-- day 3 :)

       Sunday sunday sunday.  Both craig and I are working-- him at the hospital-- me at home, studying stupid criminal law.  UGH.  And its so nice out too.  But hopefully he will get out soon-- and we can go to bloomingdales!  I bought two dresses yesterday-- on sale-- for graduation/scott's wedding.  both of which are super cute, and super on sale.  I tried them on for craiggy and he liked them too.  so I waslooking at them last night, and both of them have spots on them. . . what the hell? so now I have to return them today and hopefully they will have another in my size.  GRRR. Last night (or this morning, I am not sure) I had a dream where it was supposed to be like that day after tommorrow movie-- there was this big hole in the ground-- and it was going to collapse and the earth was goign to be swallowed.  It was a weird dream because all of the other people in the dream (my friends and family) were the cast of the t.v. show ER.  and another thing wierd was that there were these snakes and one had bitten me in the groin region-- wouldn't let go-- and it hurt so bad and nobody would take me to the hospital. my dreams keep getting more unrestful and scary as the days go on. sigh.

       here I am at bar review on saturday morning.  Its only day two of bar reiview and I am already way behind.  I have wireless access for some reason here this morning, so that has made criminal law reivew more bearable.  This sucks, 4 hours of notes on an area of law, then going home and studyign that subject for an additional 5-9 hours.  And this isn't something you can slack on either, cause your whole career rides on it.  But I guess this will be my job for the summer, and I will treat it as such.  Next weekend I am going to DC for one of my best friends from high school's wedding.  I can't wait!!! and another friend from high school had a baby this week!  congratulations nicole and gil!!!  6 lbs 1oz Juliet Serra Besana.  back to taking notes. . .later

       well, I did it.  I had my last final today.  It was wonderful-- being done and everything.  Then I was quickly snapped back into the real world.  I missed the first day of bar review so I have three choices as to when to make it up. . . saturday, sunday or monday. . .none of which are really desireable.  GRRR.  Whose idea was law school anyway?  I went and got all 25 pounds of my law review books, and I have been desperately shopping to find something to wear under my gown to graduation.  It hasn't been going so well.  Twice now I find something in a store-- buy it thinking it will be perfect, then as soon as I get home, I change my mind and have to return it.  UGH.  I also have to send out my invitations this weekend, preferably tommorrow.  Is there ever enough time to do anything?  I have also decided after a fretful morning that I am going to go on an IBS friendly diet.  I bought a book about it and I am going to do it.  I am sick of having attacks-- it really disrupts my life.  The good thing is that there really isn't any limit on fruits and veggies or sugar (unlike the BFL diet)-- but the bad news is that since it is low fat-- it really cuts out a lot of foods (french fries, fried eggs, bacon!!!).  But I guess it will be worth it considering how miserable I am.  Its not totally like the BFL diet-- more of a hybrid, so I figure if I continue with the workout routine and maintain a low fat IBS diet, I should be just fine.  I gotta live people.  Take care!   I am off to study !

       so, the exam gods were good to me yesterday-- the test was very fair-- and if I had been fully prepared it would have  been dare I say easy.  Lets hope the sunshine reigns tommorrow during my meical malpracice exam.  Speaking of which-- I am supposed to be studying for right now.  I have been doing ok, but so easily distracted.  so far I have tried on a few dresses with matching accessories (for the upcoming wedding next weekend), looked thru old pictures, gotten dressed in a cute skirt, put makeup on, flatironed my hair (all despite the fact that I won't be leaving my apartment today), looked at train schedules, given the cats toy mice to play with, and eaten several times.  I sure have been busy.  Who knew that if you get up early you could fit all that in? Anyway, I am excited about tommorrow being my last exam-- its going to be a busy day though-- I have to pick up an extra ticket from the dean's office, go to bar bri to pick up my 25 pounds of books, and clean my apartment.  I have also made an appointment next week to get my color done-- these roots have got to go folks-- its humiliating!  What else-- my tiffany's necklace has broken again for the third and last time-- I am goign to see if they will let me exchang that fragile chain for something a bit more sturdy.  I have to wait till craig can go with me though since he has the reciept.  It broke the DAY after I got it fixed for the second time. what the heck? alright, back to studying I go!

       I am about to leave to go take my corporations exam.  Im not exactly prepared-- I did study a little but not fully prepared.  I do have stacks of outlines and notes to help me look stuff up during the exam.  Lets just hope that the exam gods are feeling happy today-- and put some easy questions on there about stuff I actually know. Wish me luck!

       UGH! thank god finals are almost over-- Id on't even care that I don't get a break before studying for the bar.  I just don't want this stress for finals anymore.  Its been a long 2 weeks-- and I have ballooned up because I decided to take a break from BFL until finals are over because it was just too much for me.  So that is an undesirable stress I certainly don't need.  Anyway- I have an exam tommorrow at 845 am and thursday 845am.  Im doing some last minute studying for my exam tommorrow-- likely will be up pretty late.  Plus-- I haven't really put enough time into medical malpractice (my exam on thursday) so I will have to spend all my waking hours after my corporations exam in putting an outline together for that class.  UGH.  I just want relief already-- I think after tommorrow's exam it will better cause I will only have one thing to focus on.  Sigh, at ropes end.

       well, I finished my exam after having spent approx. 18 hours (of a 24 hour period) on it.  Messed up if you ask me, but I am in the its over, I am trying to forget it mode.  Currently, its about to thunderstorm, and I am excited, I love thunderstorms.  Currently I am furiously trying to teach myself corporate law.  I only have a few days to get prepared cause I have to spend the rest of my time studying medical malpractice.  UGH! can't wait till finals are over! BFL hasn't been really going so well the past few days becasue I haven't had time to do my workouts (big surprise with the shitty exam I had yesterday).  I am goign to try to go back to it tonight though and do my workouts.

       I'm going to make this short cause I don't have much time. but basically, except for the last 4 hours I got a little sleep, I will have spent 24 hours on this 24 hour exam.  This is unheard of.  Nobody does that.  Professors also do not put a maximum page limit of 30 pages either.  They also don't give 6 difficult quesitons either.  I was so stressed last night I felt like I was going to throw up for most of the evening.  SO I have until 5 pm to finish writing, edit, print and hand in my exam.  That would be 9 hours.  I better get moving. I got to give a big thank you to my boy because he was there for me last night thru all my stress.  He even made me dinner and cleaned up the mess.  He gave me kisses when I was about to burst, and he stayed awake as long as he could to keep me company, and  comforted me when the thunder scared me.  Thank you so much. . . I wish you could get the sleep you deserve honey.   wish me luck folks I need it.

       oh my sweetie is the best.  right now, he is loading the dishwasher-- earlier, he was packing up my apartment for me.  Before that, well-- I won't say exactly what he did for me-- but we reached a new high level of intimacy-- that I was hoping we wouldn't ever have to --involving his skills as a physician.  Basthically, he is great.. YYYYYYYaaaaaaaaaY craig!   So after saying those beautiful things about my love . . . . . . .today, he was getting the vacuum out of the closet, and I saw a stray modess pad-- so I picked it up quick--then I was like, it will be funny if I stick it on him.  So I did, on his arm.  Suprisingly, he didn't notice, so he is being all domestic vaccuming the floor with the pad on him.   Im laughing-- he's laughing (cause I am laughing.)  This goes on for like 15 minutes.  Finally, I feel bad and tell him, he responds with HEY! What the hell man?  (if you know craig, you can probably hear him saying that).  Oh god, that was funny, I have pictures, I will try to convince craig to post them.   back to studying, craig has been SO great at keeping me motivated!  God-- I am beaming

       I have to cleanse my sins-- publicly.  Craig was in soho on thursday, so I asked him to get me some rice pudding from  urlLink Rice to Riches   and he like the wonderful boy he is, did.  He got me a big thing of hazelnut, and himself a small one of milk chocolate.  So, he leaves friday morning, and I took the leftovers-- my hazelnut, 2 pieces of leftover pizza and the milk chocolate.  I didn't even think about it.  I was just thinking, leftovers, he willbe gone-- don't want it to spoil.  So I proceeded to eat all the rice pudding between thursday and saturday.  I told craig and he was like "all of it?" and I said yes, and he, with disappointment not hidden very well replied "oh"  I didn't realize that he expected it.  I feel SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad, I can't even tell you.  I am going to get him 4 new flavors tommorrow to make up for the milk chocolate I ripped off from him.

       So my bunny is in flight as we speak, and I just can NOT study for the life of me.  Oh well, I guess once he is arm's distance away from me-- I will try to concentrate again.   I can't wait to see him and pinch his little butt.  : ) We had a little crisis here at apt 1c.  Craiggy got me a beautiful hydrangea, in full bloom (which is weird cause I thought they had a limited blooming period during the spring) to help cheer me up and help me study.  So I have placed it near my window to get the only sunlight my apartment gets.  So sophie decides she wants to check it out today, even though its been there for days now.  She is sniffing, and then chewey gets in on the action.  Chewey tries to rip a flower off to eat so I yell at them, chewey, my good girl leaves the scene of the crime.  Sophie, the bad girl continues to try to eat it.  So I put it outside in my 'patio' (HA!)  I see a petal  on the window sill, don't think much of it.  until a few minutes later, I see sophie swallowing it.  I run over, down the hatch.  I vaguely remember hydrangea being poisonous, so I do a quick search-- indeed they are.  I am freaking out.  I don't want her to die.  I gather my senses and call the vet.  I explain what has happened, that she swallowed two quarter size petals of a hydrangea flower.  He sorta laughs a little and says, yeah, I think she will be fine.  If she vomits, bring her in, but I don't think that is enough to do any damage.  Im an obsessed with my cats idiot.  Yes, you can say it to yourself.  but better safe than sorry.  the plant is being punished and is outside still.    Can I just reiterate for the record, this shit is hard?  Man, I feel like despite all my studying,  I haven't learned a damn thing.  It stinks-- my poor peanut brain can only absorb so much!

       Well, Its been quite the week as far as catharsis goes-- and I am thankful for that.  I am also thankful for having such a sensitive hubby-- a situation that could have thrown him completely off the handle he responded with dignity, poise and understanding.  He may have been phased, I was too upset to really think, but if he was, he didn't let on.  You are absolutely the best Craig chepke.  I don't know what I would possibly do without you.    I love you more than anything (even more than a cold bed on a warm day, or a warm bed on a cold day with sophie sleeping at my head. . .you know that is saying A LOT)  So, I have spent half my waking hours today studying and the other half doing various searches on the internet.  Not very productive I know, but it helps me stay sane.  As a result, I have only finished half the studying I thought I would have had done by now.  I was going to reward myself by going to stepford wives--which I have been dying to see -- but since I didn't accomplish my goal, I am forcing myself to stay in and continue on.  Its ok, cause I am going to order in from  urlLink Republic   , and food is always a motivator.    In case you all were wondering, I have had no more run ins with striped clog girl.  thank you stalker god of safety.

       So, I was walking home from class just a short time ago, and not thinking anything about it, I "lapped" this girl wearing striped clogs and a orange skirt.  I didn't think anything of it when she was next to me again on the stairs to the subway.  (she stuck out by the aforementioned clothing).  So, I stop at the booth to dig in my bag for my metro card.  I find it and swipe in.  I walk to the 1 9 and walk along the yellow line at the edge of the track until I get to the spot I usually wait  (so that when the train lets me out I am right in front of the exit).  So who do I see at my "spot," the same girl!! So the train comes and we end up in the same car.  I sit at one end of the car, so that she doesn't think I am following her.  So, I am thinking to myself, I hope she doesn't get off at 23rd, cause she will seriously think I am following her (stay with me folks, I am getting to the good part).  So, of course, she gets off at 23rd and walks up the south stairs with me.  Ok, fine, she lives in Chelsea so do thousands of other women.  So we are walking, and she turns down 22nd-- she is walking fast-- now I am sorta embarrassed, but I have to get home.  I have what I will say to her if she says something in my mind.  Guess what?  She turns to go down the stairs to go to my building.  So I see her as I am approaching, and she is like furiously digging in her bag for her keys like I am single white female or something.  So I have my keys in hand, and am trying to pretend I don't notice her as I listen to Ben folds five on my ipod.  She says something to me, I don't hear her cause of the headphones-- so I take one headphone out and say "excuse me?" and she says, can you hold the door for me?  and I said of course, I could tell she was relieved that I wasn't' going to murder her and cook her brains to feed to the cats.   So as we are walking to our respective apartments,  she says, are you taking bar bri?  I said yes (she had a bar bri mug, so I knew she was).  She says, do you live on the first floor?  I say yes.  (I'm a little creeped out that she knew that, but not thinking much of it.) She says, I thought so cause I have seen bar review books in your apartment. I say, "excuse me?"  thinking maybe I miss heard her She says, I have seen bar review books in your apartment.  I respond, oh-- yeah.  Ok, bye see you tomorrow (hoping I won't) Ok, so my question is, How the Hell has she seen my bar review books?  They aren't in the window sill and in order to see much past the bed, you would have to be really staring into my apartment during the night (because during the day, with the way the sun shines, you can't see past the bed).   Yikes!  maybe this is single white female after all.  Please tell me if I am over reacting???

       it seems as there is a wonderful trend sweeping the chepke family.  I think its absolutely fabulous.  Dawn-- you need to make one too dammit!!  I love hearing whats going on in everybody's life, especially since I get to spend such limited amounts of time with everyone.  and for some reason, my sister thinks noone wants to hear whats going on in HER life. . . I do!!!  although I must say megan's blog is very cute. In my life, craigs leaving me next weekend, and I am sad already.  Although it will force me to spend all weekend every waking hour studying.  otherwise I am complacent and just want to lay in his arms.  sigh, to be in love.  I know it sounds completely retarded to say this, but sometimes, I even miss him when he is there.  Like yesterday craig and I went to go see a movie (saved! it was awesome, I highly recommend), and throughout the movie I was missing him, I guess its cause I couldn't talk or interact with him.  I kept staring at him.  he must have thought I was being really wierd.   Anyway--I used my gift certificates to coach on saturday and I bought a fuschia and lime hamptons tote bag with a watermelon keychain to put around the handle ( I learned that from my FMIL).  The great thing is, the inside is like plastic-- so if a cat shits in there, which won't happen, its completely washable.  Apparently some women use it for a diaper bag-- thus the waterproof lining. Anyway, its so cute-- check it out on the coach website.  The girl though I was a weirdo because I paid with a million 25$ certificates, but omg-- she was horrible-- craig was SO polite to her, but as soon as we left the store, the both of us wanted to beat her up.  So funny, cause I thought I was just being a bitch, but the girl was terrible.  As we were leaving she said to me, if you sold this you could get a lot of money, but you shouldn't sell it because its illegal.  WHY the F*&K would I sell something I JUST bought?  Craig should be a diplomat.    urlLink my new hamptons bag outside      urlLink my new hamptons bag inside      urlLink my new hamptons bag inside 2      urlLink watermelon key chain

       so, I was watching the simple life roadtrip-- I know I know-- and saw the part where paris gets thrown off the horse, and my heart started racing!! I was having flashbacks to when I got thrown off the horse twice. . . ew.  My heart is still beating really fast.  No more horses for me!  anyway, so then I started laughing cause she had all this black dirt all over her-- just like I did-- I was laughing so hard-- oh how far the mighty fall.  But then-- I stopped laughing when they showed the freaking helicopter fly in to get her to take her to the hospital.  Are you F($&^*$(# kidding me??  What a waste of taxpayer money.  I proceeded to get more angry when the poor stooge she is staying with felt guilty for her accident and spent 113.26 on her to get her and nicole stupid ass trinkets that she will never use again.  Ugh, this guy pry doesn't even make  that much in a day.  UGH!! Today wasn't so bad as far as class goes-- I learned some interesting law today.  Legally-- venereal disease is loathsome.  HA!

       once again, I am still up. . . I am exhausted.  Damn insomnia.  Marisa has been having it too.  Damn bar exam.  I wanted to update everyone on my bag situation.  So, I decided I was going to be frugal and wash the bag out instead of buying a new one (mostly because I like this bag and couldn't find one anywhere I liked more).  So I washed it, dryed it and it was perfect again-- poopie smell  is gone!!! However-- I am a RETARD.  The NEXT day, I got a chicken gyro for lunch, cause I was craving a gyro, and the wrapped it twice in tinfoil, and then put it in a paper bag-- to take home to eat.  I got tired of carrying the paper bag on my way home-- so I put it in my bigger bag (herein after referred to the shit bag)-- thinking oh-- it won't leak.  Sure enough-- I have that freaking yogurt sauce all over the inside.  UGH!   At least it doesn't smell like cheese or puke.  Just gyro!   Its pronounced JIE-ROW  not HEE-ROW rose!!

       thank you all for the love!!! I am not feeling better-- but on the bright side, I am not feeling worse!! I am just miserably tired, due to all the stress I have insomnia-- its not fun.  Tommorrow we have a double session of class-930 to 115 then 2-545ish.  UGH.  Its torts too-- the subject that, until Federal Civil Rights this semester, was the downfall of my GPA.  So I am not looking forward to it. Ok, so I am not in a bad mood-- so don't construe this in a bad way-- but I am frustrated with women in New York.  We are a fashion forward city-- so how did so many women go wrong?  I  know I am not necessarily a fashion Diva but I do my best and I try not to embarass myself.  I have come up with some don'ts for the purpose of saving other women humiliation.  I have a feeling I will be adding to this list as the summer progresses.   1) If you can pinch more than (and I am being generous here) 3 inches of fat on your stomach-- DONT wear clothes that don't cover it.  I have seen several women in the past week alone violating this.  One had a HUGE gut, and was wearing a half shirt with too tight jeans.  Another had low rise jeans-- and a tank top that did not cover but 2/3rds of her big gut.  This is a simple rule.  It has nothing to do with being comfortable with your size or shape-- it has to do with modesty and class.  2) It is NEVER appropriate to wear a black thong with white see thru tight pants.  I don't care who you are or how fly your body is, its trashy (and it also makes manhattanites think you are B&T).  Craig and I saw a middle aged woman, with a very nice body for her age wearing a black thong with white pants- I was appalled, but chalked it up to her being an idiot.  But I saw another girl around my age today wearing white pants (again, a cute figure) with a black thong.  HOW can you let your friends go out like that?    I shudder to think how many women do this that I don't see-- how does that saying go?  For every one person you see inappropriately dressed, there are 12 more?  I think thats how it goes.  Gives me the heeby jeebies.

       I think I am coming down with a cold.  I thought it was just allergies-- cause that is what craiggypants said-- but I have a really sore throat and my head feels that wierd way it does when I have a cold-- sorta like its swimming, oh and lets not forget the sniffles.  Ive had worse-- bring it on germs. But seriously, I have developed a twitch in my right eye.  I don't know if I already said this.  but its so annoying.  Maybe I am going crazy.  I hope not.  It would be too wierd a twist of irony given I plan to marry a psychiatrist.   more later-- now I have things to do. . .

       If you ever talk to craig, have him say that to you, its wicked funny-- he sounds just like the doctor on the simpsons.  But anyway, I got to spend some time with my sweet cuppin cakes this weekend and it was DEE lightful!  In an attempt to slowly empty my apartment, I sent craig home with three bags full of stuff (it would have been 4 had craig not been so picky with the DVDS :p ).  I have made some progress as far as stuff-- I made a rough sketch of this summers trip-- what states on what dates.  And I have also been investigating alternative wedding dress options such as having one custom made and also vintage wedding gowns.   I am woman-- I don't have to commit to anything!!! YAY--or sigh, because I can't seem to decide on anything :(  Anyway, I am going to make some english muffin pizzas and go back to studying. . . I am up to 50% correct on the intermediate crim law questions-- go me!

       I realized that probably the majority of readers don't know where sophie(pie) comes from.  For the large portion of my youth, I was only called sophie (a nickname given by my big sis).  I didn't know my name WASNT sophie.  Nobody called me lindsey-- just sophie.  then one day-- everyone started calling me by my given name again-- I was so confused.  If I see people I haven't seen since childhood-- they still call me sophie.  I kinda like it.  The only one close to me who still calls me that is my sissy, and even she calls me that rarely.  I guess its just that when you are a child, you have all sorts of loving nicknames from family and friends ( a few of mind included sophie, windy,  and my mom called me pumpkin)  Then one day-- when leaving childhood, people think you need to lose that cloak of love and call you by the name on your birth certificate.  Oh well-- mature, responsible lindsey it is.  Other than that-- I have been diligently studying this beautiful saturday.  With a short break for lunch with craiggy.  Now I am going to take another break-- perhaps not so short-- to go for a jog.  I need some energy-- perhaps that will do the trick.   ciao

       Im a little stressed today.   I am on my way to class and I get my bar bri  id out of my bag to put around my neck and I see something smudge on the back of it I am like, ew gross what is that thinking its spaghetti sauce or something.  So I wipe it off and then smell it-- yeah, um, not spaghetti.  It was SHIT.  Now-- the situation continues.  So, I am frantically taking things out of my bag as soon as I get inside and seated to see where this mysterious shit is coming from.  Mind you, it STINKS!!!  I will now put this in play format for the full effect.   SCENE: Two people in the row behind me are trying to decide where to sit,   Dumb Guy:  I don't want to sit over here it stinks.   Lindsey: oh its my bag that smells, but don't worry if you want to sit here, I am going to clean it so it shouldn't smell.   Dumb Girl: I don't think its your bag--  Lindsey:trust me it is, I spilled something in here.    DUmb Girl: It smells like cheese.   Lindsey: cringing.  well, I don't really know what it is.   Dumb Guy : "Did you puke in your bag?"   Lindsey: (losing her patience.  She thinks to her self, are you F*&%$# kidding me?)   no, I didn't puke in my bag.     GOD WHAT A RETARD!!!! Who pukes in their bag and then advertises it.  I can't get over how stupid people are. So, its not over yet.  During one of the breaks I am retelling the story about finding shit in my bag to a couple of friends who don't sit near me.  One interrupts to say--It was your cats right?  OK-- HELLO PEOPLE.  I know not everyone may know the REAL me-- but most people know me well enough that I WOULD NOT SHIT IN A BAG.  Especially my own bag that contains my wallet, cell phone, lunch, snacks and class notes.    I guess my frustration stems from my embarrassment and humiliation.  I spent 3 hours during lecture trying to figure out how my cats got their shit in my bag.  They are both litter trained and dont' have accidents.  and it was only a tiny dime sized amount that was on my book which was in my bag.    I can't figure it out.  Needless to say-- I am not happy with the girls right now.  Although, They seem a bit confused as to why I am upset.    I wanna be sedated.  N.B. the smell of Shit does not easily wash out-- I need a new bag

       yes its true folks.  as I was walking home yesterday from the pet store, I heard a old black man loudly comment after I passed, "DAMN, aint got no booty."  Sigh.  The life of a white girl.  not only that, but unfortunately, pancake butts run on my mom's side of the family.  (I was going to wait to break the news to craig until after the wedding, but I can't live the lie anymore).

       my poor cupcake, he is having such a rough time right now.  So if you know him please send him some love and encouragement right now.  He needs it.  I was so worried about him all day today that I felt like I was going to throw up all during lecture, I even had to leave lecture a few times to run to the bathroom.  Boy craig, if I feel this way, I can only imagine how you feel.  hang in there kiddo-- just 2 more weeks.   On another note, as yesterday's post indicated, I am severly pissed at the west side medical pavilion. (the following is only part of why I was so pissed though) I noticed on my bill that I was WAY overcharged for a bloodpressure check and when I asked them about it they give me some bullshit line about a contract with my insurance company.  I let them know as I was hanging up that I WOULD be calling to verify the veracity of that with my insurance company and if they had lied to me, I was going to turn them in for insurance fraud.  So, just as I thought, the insurance people thought it was fraudulent-- but had to wait until the claim was submitted before they could file an official complaint.  HA you jerks I thought!! It was sort of my sweet legal revenge.  So today, their office calls me and they were being SUPER nice (which is the opposite of how I have been treated in all other encounters)-- and she says that she spoke to the doctor about my last visit and there was an error in billing-- so they are reducing the charge.  I guess I scared the billing clerk enough yesterday that she thought she better speak to the doctor.    The bottom line is-- if you see a charge on your bill that seems too much-- it probably is.  Have it investigated, you don't have to be taken advantage of!!!!

       there is a little gem or a restaurant tucked away in K-town that used to serve pho-- they took it off the menu unfortunately.  But I was just screwing around to see if they had a website.  Turns out, not only do they have a website, they have a freaking cool website!  and a new location in union square near the law school that boasts a full bar and lounge area.  I will have to be hitting that up, check out if the new hip village location can live up to the tastiness of the k-town original.   urlLink Mandoo bar

        I won't get into details, but if you are a woman, and you need gynecological or obstetric services, DO NOT go to this office.  Nuff said on this point.  Anyway, even aside from the above tangent today has been a shit day.  It started out fine.  Class went great, I actually was engaged and knew a bunch of stuff.  But the day went downhill from there.  I don't want to talk about why it sucked, because I am humiliated and embarrassed.   I hope tommorrow is a better day.

       Unfortunately-- today hasn't been.  Except for the short respite of having brunch with craig and his grandfather, this has been a fairly stressful day.  I had class this morning that I had to leave early cause I couldn't stand it anymore-- 2 out of 3 hours is all I had in me on a sunday morning.  We had to say goodbye to bigguy this afternoon as he returns back to charlotte (we were sad to see the last of craigs family return back to their home. . . now we are all alone.)  Its been stressful cause craig only has 2 more weeks until his shelf exam for medicine (which is med school talk for final).  and he has a lot of work to do to prepare, and now its finally caught up with him.  Im sorry you are stressed craig, but I know you can do it!  you still have plenty of time!!!  So now, I am back home, I took a few minutes to write a few thank you cards and I must start studying.  Its hard because I know I won't be seeing craig tonight, and we always spend sundays together and get pizza :( Wah.  You cannot create experience. You must undergo it.  Albert Camus  ain't that the truth?

       On a break, short little post to make up for my boring veil discussion.  No names will be revealed to protect the innocent.  So I am over at a certain someone's apt last night.  And that someone's grandfather is visiting.  the grandfather and I are in the living room saying goodnight, and the someone is in his bedroom.  the grandfather and I start walking towards the room he is staying in, which is past the someone's room.  as we are walking by the someone's room, both the grandfather and I peek in and what do we see--- naked ass hanging all about.  The grandfather says-- in the most loving way-- what have you got your ass hanging out for?  I couldn't stop laughing!!!  My question is this-- what have you got your ass hanging out for nameless someone!?

       let me tell you, I had my cranky pants on today.  I took a shower and hopefully they won't be cranky anymore.  I have been up since 830 am this morning studying-- with a few breaks here and there, mostly to eat or talk to craiggy.  the cats have been wonderful, every once in a while they will come up on my lap while I am studying and just fall asleep for a little while, their soft furry body warm and soothing.  My new obsession is finding a reasonably priced silk tulle veil or silk tulle fabric.  It is the most expensive of all the tulles but its also the most beautiful.  I have discovered that they don't really sell it in the U.S.  only the nylon ones-- so I have been looking in the UK.  Ok, that had to be the most boring two sentences I have ever written.  Sorry.   I am going back to studying now, so later gater.

       well, today has been a relatively unproductive day today.  I took my vitamin though!!   Rose went back home and I was very sad because I didn't get to spend very much time with her on account of my bar review.  I hope she isn't mad/annoyed at/with me.  I discovered today that it is very difficult to force yourself to study on a friday afternoon.  I just want to relax, especially after a hectic week. I came home after seeing rose off, and ate lunch, did a few odds and ends that I needed to do, and then took a 2 hour nap at around 5pm.  Rough life.  It will be though if I don't get my ass in gear soon.  sometimes I wish I were one of my cats.  They have the perfect life.   The sleep around 18 hours a day, eat, play, and my personal favorite-- poop.  How much fun would that be? What else is new?  not much I guess.  class on sunday (to make up the one I missed on account of my graduation), and I have to review all day  tommorrow. yuck.  wish me luck!  tonight, granted he gets done soon enough-- I am going to visit my cupcake and bigguy, and make some brownies.  Craig has had a pretty emotional day, and I want to help the best way I know how-- sweets.  Night night folks.

So, since I have a gym membership for the month of june that I thought I could cancel, I am going to make good use of it and take some yoga/strength training classes.  I am hoping that it will help with the physical ailments I have that are stress induced.  But, not this week, rose is in town, so I haven't been able to spend much time with her cause I have been studying.  :(  Anyway, its been long enough break.  ciao

Craigs family is leaving tommorrow morning, sad because for the past week it was like they lived in ny too-- I liked it.  Though they live in NC, they are new yorkers at heart!  One quick note-- can someone please explain to me how you have a barbeque at your house and ask people to give you  money for food (instead of bringing stuff)?  In all the years I have ever had people over for food and drinks, I have never asked for money.  Thats all.

       well, its been a long long week.  But, all the stress is over (till work starts:)   The exam was very difficult, but it was not as hard as I expected and there were only a few surprises.  And I was happy that there weren't any trust questions on the exam either!  I believe I have a fair shot of passing, but I will keep my fingers crossed until November. So poor craig, he hasn't had a moments rest.  We had a little bit o drama with the moving truck so we ended up packing my shit and leaving in the wee hours of wednesday night/thursday morning depending on how you want to look at it. Not really what I wanted to do right after finishing a two day exam, but we made it and it worked out for the best cause craig didn't like driving the big truck and since we were driving between 3am and 7am, there wasn't much traffic.  So now we are in good ol newark valley. So, I woke up at 730 am this morning (VERY unusual since I haven't been getting much sleep).  My bedroom is just too hot, and sleeping with craig is like sleeping with a furnace.  So I got up, and after about 20 minutes I woke craiggy up to send him into my parents bedroom to sleep since there is an air conditioner in there.  He's still sleeping.  I hope he gets some rest Meanwhile, I've been like a mad woman trying to unpack all my stuff.  There is just SO much, its overwhelming.  My shoes and books alone take up my entire bedroom.  Oh well, I will figure some storage situation out I guess.   I bought a car yesterday.  It was so scary, I started crying in the showroom after all the paper work was filled out and I realized how much I was signing a loan for. The owner of the dealership took me into her office and was trying to make me feel better, but then I felt even more stupid for crying in front of her. I feel better now though.  Craig was smart, him and my mom went for a walk while earle and i were negotiating.  But, I guess everyone has to buy their first car sometime.  Craig and I LOVE it.  I was going to try to link photos from the Toyota website, but I'm using my mom's PC and since I've had my Mac I've become PC retarded. So you will have to look up pictures yourself.  2004 Toyota camry solara SLE!  Lunar mist color, dark stone interior.  Its a beauty.  And so fun to drive.  Craig was upset because the car is set up for satellite radio- but you have to buy the antenna and kit from the dealer, and it is going to take longer than 5 days to do that, so we won't be able to get it unless we call ahead to a dealer in some city and have them do it there.  I'm just afraid of getting ripped off.  Earle knows the people in the service center at our toyota dealership- so they don't steal too much of our money, but anywhere else- I walk in and dollar signs cha ching in their eyes.   Ok, I better get back to my cleaning/packing etc.  I might need to take a nap. If I had a half moon cookie that might get me thru, but earle kept eating mine.  I would cut the cookie in half (since I am trying to lose weight), and I would come back later for the other half, gone.  I thought diabetics were not supposed to have sugar? HEE HEE btw- my grandma's surgery went well, the doctor removed a cyst from her spine that was the size of a softball! (no wonder she was having so much pain) she should be feeling better now, they hope she will be able to come home sunday or monday.  Craig and I brought her a reese's pieces sundae from friendlys last night.  She didn't eat it-- she really must not be feeling well.

       I though I would blog one last time before cable guy comes and kills my study break methods.  I don't know what I am going to do during study breaks anymore.  I can't watch tv, use the internet, I can't even pack cause I don't have any boxes.  hmm, maybe I will doodle or something.  'craig has packed all my books except for WEDDING BOOKS-- hmm, I think I found my cure.   So, panic alternates with a sense of it'll probably be ok.  I guess that is good.  I'd hoped for less.  I have banished craig from coming over until monday.  He took this REALLY hard.  I thought he would be happy to be back in his own apartment, doing what he wants to do.  But he was upset.  I still think its the best plan though.  This way, I won't be tempted to talk to him while he's here, saturday and sunday are going to be ferocious study days.  Its my third and final review of the subjects before the bar, so I wanted to give myself all the time I can.  And he can go out and do some stuff this weekend, feel like a real new yorker again, instead of like some rat in a cage.  Don't get me wrong, craig brings a sense of security unrivelled by any kitty cat, but Im not going to be able to take him with me into the bar exam.  I love you CRAIGGY.  Monday, I plan to get up really early 630-- spend an hour waking up, review my flash cards one last time, shower and badiggity-- get a fabulous mani-pedi, have a glass of wine, go for a jog!!!! (that I am really excited about), and watch lara croft with craig that evening.  Sounds like a perfectly relaxing day, hope it goes as planned. . . Um what else, so two weeks ago or so I bought some "fat clothes"  you know what I am talking about.  Stuff that is bigger than what you normally wear-- and just a little bigger than what you wear now so that you can feel like you are so skinny your clothes don't fit??  Well, if you don't know, that why I bought them.  Just some cheap skirts and a couple of matching shirts from old navy, the cheapest place I could think of nearby.  So anyway, I had no clean underwear for a couple days cause all my clothes were dirty and I didn't have tme to do wash (ahem, rosemarie).  I finally broke down and sent them to be washed at the washers, only problem is, I always hang dry ALL my shirts, otherwise they shrink into oblivion.  So, I couldn't not send my shirts--well this morning I am putting on one of those shirts aforementioned, and its like a freaking baby tee!  I don't care though.  Only person thats going to see me is cable guy and his gut is likely bigger than mine.   I'm starting to get nervous/anxious.  I wasn't before-- I was just stressed.  You know how I can tell?  My bowels.  Damn irritable bowel syndrome!!  I have been fit as a fiddle intestinally for the past few weeks I have been studying at my apartment.  Not so much anymore.  UGH.  I have exactly 11 prescription pills remaining, I have been saving them for a few months (since I am out of refills) for the bar.  Im glad I did.   ok, on a happy note-- hate to go out so miserable. . . its about to rain.  And since I don't have to go out today, that makes me happy.  I love rainy days.  Also, the thought of being almost done makes me happy, and seeing family again FINALLY makes me happy.  Talking to friends, relaxing-- excercising-- all make me happy! yay!

       There are 3 more days (not counting today) of studying.  I am taking bar bri's advice and not studying on monday-- just reviewing.  I can't learn what I don't know in 24 hours.  I am seriously petrified at this point.  I haven't been scoring as high on the MBE as I should, and I don't know if that will improve between now and the actual bar.  Or if I will be able to compensate with good scores on the essays.  I got a sample essay I wrote in the mail yesterday.  It was graded and she gave me a 2.5 -which rounds to a 3.  I was pissed.  Cause I read her comments, and one of them was-- define the elements of conspiracy with an arrow to a sentence I had written (the defendants actions satisfy the elements of conspiracy).  If she had read a little further before being such a bitch she would have seen it say (which are ___,_____, _____).  What an asshole.  Thats at least a half a point right there.  She did that a couple of other times on my essay with other things. I think I should have had at least a 4.  I was pissed cause her grading and comments gives me NO feedback to what I am doing right/wrong because she didn't even grade it properly.  UGH.    So tommorrow evening my cable is being disconnected, so no more blog posts for awhile.  No more anything actually-- email--internet, television.  Sunday someone is coming to take my dresser.  Its going to be really weird living in half of an apartment.  But, I need to get rid of things-- Im giving away my mattress too.  Craig's taking my couch (hopefully, as long as he can find helpers to move it and it fits in the elevator in his building).  and my mirror over my couch.  I hate moving.  I like comfort and security, not dissarray and unfamiliarity.  sigh We rented a 10' truck to move my stuff home.  It was only 100 dollars more, and much more conveinent since we would only have to  make one trip.  Earle was freaking out.  Those aren't easy to drive, especially in the city.  Craigs driven it before though, so I am not worried.  I realized that everyone I talk to-- says that they are worried about failing too.  I don't know if this is because, I hang out with the wrong type of people-- or if people are really unsure of themselves, or if I am right on average with my knowledge.  I hope the latter.   Everyone should be thankful that my internet is going off tommorrow, cause I don't think I would be able to write about anything except the bar and my fears- Im already sick of it, I can't imagine that nobody else is.   Oh yeah, I waxed my one eyebrow too thin, I hope it grows back.  I didn't want to make the other one too thin cause then if it didn't grow back, I would have 2 bad ones instead of jsut one.  Although if I only get one hope-- I hope that I pass the bar, I will live with one too thin eyebrow for the rest of my life.  Actually, if I only get one hope, I hope that my grandma's surgery on monday goes well and without any complications.  I would rather fail the bar than have her in ill health.  (not that I would want to choose, but if I had to-- this is where I stand).  Send your prayers her way on monday-- and my way on tuesday/wednesday!.  Quote of the day: this one goes to all my wells girls out there.  "Those trucks are big, they aren't easy to drive you know.  ESpecially in the city." "but earle, I have driven the big red wells van!"

       I realized this morning that not only do I find comfort in show tunes, but i find comfort in habits mimicked from my grandparents.  My maternal grandparents helped raise my sister and I for a majority of our childhoods.  (my mother was a single mom and worked nights in the ER so we had to stay at my grandparents 5 days a week).  As a result, I owe a lot of my good manners and traditional upbringing to them.  I think danielle and I have a lot of skills that most people in our generation don't have.  Maybe she would disagree, but I think I know more about table manners and making a proper bed than most.  I talked a little about my grandpa the other day and his fabulous fried egg sandwiches.  This morning as I was boiling a pot of water for my tea, I realized something.  Ever since I started studying for the bar, when I wake up, I brew a whole pot of tea, and drink it throughout the day.  The first thing in the morning, I have it hot with an english  muffin, then later, iced.  I completely and whole heartedly picked this up from my grandma.  She always has, and probably always will, had hot tea with toast and jam in the morning, and a glass of iced tea by her side all day long.   Oh the comforts of youth.  Next thing you know, I will be making a big batch of chex mix in the oven and eating that for a "snack" while watching murder she wrote or my grandpa's favorite, Hee Haw.    Today's Quote of the day:  This quote is around 20 years old, and only danielle will truly appreciate it, but its in honor of my grandpa-- Let me set the scene, its winter-- danielle and I are young, 5 and 8 approximately, grandpa is in "his chair" and my grandma is sitting on a couch nearby, they are watching tv.  Danielle and I are on another couch.  One of us, I don't remember who, keeps getting up to go to the bedroom or bathroom or both.  Grandpa is frustrated.  He keeps the heat in the house very low, so he says,  "Will you quit walking around?  You're making a breeze!"  To this day my family still laughs about that.  At the time, I wasn't laughing, because it was a stern rebuke, but goodness-- grandpa, I miss you!

       So, the bar is officially one week away-- next tuesday.  As a result, my stress level is way up, my tolerance level is way down and I am less than fun to be around.  Thank god for my support network (including all you faithful commentors on my blog!  It means more than you probably think it does!).   Thank god for craig too.  Jeez, he has really been taking care of me.  Yesterday I was a bit low down (as you probably noticed from my post).  Craig soothed me while I cried, came in the bathroom to keep me company while I took a hot bath, and laid on the bed with me after I was relaxed into sleep by the above.  He must be tired from all this caretaking cause he fell asleep too, and when I couldn't stand waiting any longer I finally woke him up at 945!! This morning, in my dream, I was singing Ease on down the Road from the wiz along with some other girl who I knew in my dream but was made up.  I think my brain is trying to tell me something.  I tried to download it off of itunes, but they didn't have it!! (tsk tsk).  So, I decided that will be my anthem from here on out.   Sing it with me Y'all!  (its weird that I always come back to show tunes when I am stressed.-- day by day from godspell comes out a lot too).  Come on and  Ease on down, ease on down the road Come on, ease on down Ease on down the road Don't you carry nothing That might be a load Come on, ease on down Ease on down the road  Pick your left foot up When your right foot's down Come on legs keep movin' Don't you lose no ground You just keep on keepin' On the road that you choose Don't you give up walkin' 'Cause you gave up shoes, no  Ease on down, ease on down the road Come on, ease on down Ease on down the road Don't you carry nothing That might be a load Come on, ease on down Ease on down the road  'Cause there maybe times When you think you lost your mind And the steps you're takin' Leave you three, four steps behind But the road you're walking Might be long sometimes You just keep on steppin' And you'll just be fine, yeah  Ease on down, ease on down the road Come on, ease on down Ease on down the road Don't you carry nothing That might be a load Come on, ease on down Ease on down the road  Well there maybe times When you wish you wasn't born And you wake one morning Just to find your courage's gone But just know that feeling Only last a little while You stick with us And we'll show you how to smile, yeah  Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down Get 'em up, get 'em up ease on down

       I fell down today.  It was raining, and apparently I didn't have enough tread in my shoes.  I slipped on a subway grate, and the next thing I knew I was on my knees in the middle of the street, but still holding my umbrella I might add! (talent).  Anyway, I fall alot, this is unremarkable.  The remarkable thing was, there was a lady jaywalking the same way I was, and she yelped when I fell.  so She walked a little bit over to me, and I started telling her I slipped on the grate.  The next thing she said to me was, "you know what I find amazing?  That when you fall and are wearing pants, your pants are fine, but you take them off and your legs are all scraped up.  How does that happen?" There was no-- are you ok?  or --Did you hurt yourself?  Just her little musing about the mysteries of pants.  Wow.  I was bleeding from each knee and I don't get a are you ok?  What the hell? My bunny patched me up though, so I am ok now.  A little bit o bruised ego never hurt nobody.  Quote of the day: from the above incident, "Im just glad my skirt didn't fly up when I fell down." "In this neighborhood, I don't think anyone would notice."

       you see a lot of things in chelsea-- men in new levis made to look vintage and their tiny fitted t-shirts who can walk a catwalk better than any super model, boy butter, crazies talking to non-existent people, the occasional homeless person on fire.  But today I saw something I have never seen before.  I saw a dog walking on a leash with her owner who looked before she crossed the street.  Im not kidding, the dog looked to see if there were cars coming!! I was stunned!! Dogs are freaking smart when they wanna be.  Then there are my cats who are engaged in a WWE throw down at the moment.  Ha!  Ive seen a lot of wierd things today actually besides the above.  I saw what looked like should have been a respectable girl with a short skirt on that was so short, when she walked and it flipped up a little bit, you could see her ass.  Um, whoa!  I think she had a bathing suit on underneath, but unless you are at the beach, its much inappropriate.  I also saw a man dart of the salvation army store, scream, "F*&ing Bastard!" and look both ways. I kept walking trying to avoid trouble.  I stop to wait to cross the street and who comes running up?  Crazy salvation army guy.  He's clutching his cell phone on his hip (if I didn't konw it was his cell phone, I would have thought it was a gun), he jumps INTO traffic, places his hand on a taxis hood and says, hold on a second (as if he were a super agent on a secret mission). He then proceeds to run for several blocks where I could not see him anymore.  I wanted to follow him to see what his problem was, but I wasn't going to  jump in front of on coming traffic or run in flip flops.   People are so funny.  Craig and I had brunch at a place in chelsea called Rue de Crepes.  which craig tells me means the street of crepes.  It was a cute little place that was painted so that you felt like you were outside on a sidewalk in paris or something (but you were really inside).  There food wasn't too bad either.  They had the best fries I have had in a really long time.  And a yummy tomato basil aioli dipping sauce which I want to duplicate cause it was so good.

       yeah-- I ate too much-- although it really wasn't that much.  We ordered in tonight for a treat since we have been eating in EVERY day.  Which is hard for craig and I.  I got my favorite-- a steamed roast pork bun and turnip cakes!!! Dim sum heaven!  as a special reward, we also ordered taro bubble tea.  Yummy.  But my belly is going to A SPlode.  There is so much liquid in there.  Could be worse.  It could be my brain asploding. So time is ticking-- 10 more days of studying till the bar.  Its like christmas, except bad.  Some subjects I feel great about, some I feel like I know less now than I did last year.  but I guess thats cause Im stressed.  Im hoping that with all the positive thoughts you all will be sending me, my positive thinking and my diligent studying, I will pass the bar.  Thats that.  But keep your fingers crossed just in case.   The other day, craig and I were taking the subway home from soho-- and we got in the last car cause that would drop us off in front of the exit on 23rd.  Good thinking right?  Wrong!!!  It was the HELL TRAIN.  We were on a train straight to hell.  I swear!  Thank god we got off.  It was packed full of people, everyone was so cranky and mean and there were what seemed like thousands of screaming kids everywhere.  I was so glad that was over when we got off.  It was like craig and I own personal hell.   he not liking to be in a crowd of people in a confined place, me not liking the people being rude and us both hating the kids YELLING.  Sigh.  Life in NY can be frustrating some times.   Sorry about the lack of quotes of the day.  I spend all day indoors nowadays studying so I don't really get to interact with people anymore.  Cept craig, but even my interactions with him are limited.  Although last night, I was totally manic.  I don't know what happned, maybe a freak out from stress.  But, I was ranting about asses and eyeballs, and combining the two.  Craig is such a trooper.  He just laughed at me.  (instead of calling belevue). From this conversation the quote is derived: Quote of the day: "Im glad I am not a mad scientist cause I would be putting eyeballs on peoples asses."

       not much new going on here today-- I haven't even left the apartment.  Craig has been keeping all but necessary lights off in my apartment to help me save money on electricity, but I can't handle it cause its the only "light" I get.  Right now, craig is napping on my bed with sophie who is also passed out, and a nearby sleeping chewey.  Its so cute.  Every once in awhile I hear one of them snore a little.  Makes me giggle.  I wish I could take a picture without waking them all up.   I had a little freak out today regarding the bar.  I did a few practice questions and I did worse than I did before I did all this studying-- so I like really freaked out.  But, I felt better after I took a shower and made myself a fried egg sandwhich with miracle whip.  This may sound really gross to some.  But my grandpa used to make it for my sister and me when were younger.  He was the best at making them-- sometimes the yolk would be too hard, but he would always eat that himself and make us another one (cause we like it runny).  It made me feel better to eat it cause it made me think of him.  I  miss him a lot.  He was a wonderful man, I wish craig could have met him.  I ate two sandwhiches.  yum.  Now I am sorta calm again. I even got 76% right on crim law.  Thanks grandpa!! So craig came over today after a study he participated in.  One eye was fully dilated and the other was constricted.  It looked REALLY weird.  A little scary.  But I think its getting back to normal now.   All different parts of my body have been cracking lately, my knees (which always have), my hips, my neck, my elbow.  Is that from non-use? It hurts!  I feel like an old woman.   alright, I guess I should go back to studying.  I am doing really boring subjects so I don't want to-- wah!

       I forgot to post a quote of the day yesterday--well really, there wasn't any good ones I could remember.  So I will post one from a few days ago that didn't get included cause it got trumped by the CVS thing.  Quote of the day for Yesterday: "Honey, do you realize, that one day-- you are going to be my baby daddy?" "that sounds like I am going to fulfill a prophesy or something." "well, not everyone knows who their baby daddy is going to be."  nb.  craig always pesters me about getting these quote exactly right.  So I have to notify everyone, these quotes are edited by my memory, but I can say with faith that they are mostly right!

       I realized today that the only physical activity I have gotten this week was when I planned to go someplace on a study break.  That is horrible, luckily its only temporary.  Its just so hard for me to concieve living like this.  Waking up-- studying-taking breaks followed by more studying and then eventually going to bed.  Too bad I don't have a stationary bike with a magazine stand, I could put that in the middle of my tiny studio and just pedal and study all day long.  The closest I get is rocking in my rocking chair for 8 hours straight.  I guess that is some movement.  ha! anyway, today I bought a conservative one piece bathing suit to wear for the start of our x-country trip until I lose my bar weight.  I realized a few weeks ago that I only own bikinis-- and Im way too out of shape to put one on at this point.  Sorry craiggy!   Ive taken to giving men the finger lately.  Since I have gotten out of shape-- my boobs have gotten REAL big.  Like bigger than before or ever.  Not that they were ever small.  So they are very noticeable in anything I wear, not just low cut shirts.  As a result, I have had more men ooglers than ever in my life, and it pisses me off.  I didn't ask for these things dammit.  once I was walking by a guy and he was staring at them, and when he passed I turned around and of course he was staring at my ass at that point, I gave him the finger and he loved it, what a freak!  another time, a couple was sitting on a bench, and the man was staring at my tits while the woman was staring at him.  real nice buddy.  so as not to make a scene--I turned to look at him as I passed and gave him the finger while my hand was at my side.  he noticed.  What a dick, don't people have any shame?  your with your girl man!  So today, I got caught in a thunderstorm without an umbrella, double uh oh.  I walked past a group of construction workers, and of course one was oogling me.  but I didn't dare give him the finger- large group of men  not a good idea--I have my senses about me still luckily.  I was thinking of things I could shout to shame him-- like I am married you pig, , but since I figured a)it was a lie  and b) he wouldn't be shamed by that either.  I should have said I'm 13 you disgusting old man!  then maybe he would have been a little embarrassed.   anyway, finishing torts-- on to contracts! ciao

       Yes, its that time of night where I have to take study breaks every 30 minutes or so to stay focused, it sucks cause it takes longer to get thru things- -but what am I going to do?  Craig thinks that I am procrastinating, but when you have been reading since 930 in the morning, by 1030 at night-- your brain is sleepy.   We did take a study break today that was more extended than should be but-- it was uplifting.  We went to RK bridal to try on two possible bridesmaids dresses.  (well, I tried them on, craig just watched-- well he didn't even watch.  he snuck into the dressing room with me and had his eyes squeezed closed until I was zipped up. )  They were both great dresses-- very cute, but one was more flattering-- and we looked at the color swatches-- and we found a color we liked-- so it has been decided!  That is exciting.  We celebrated by getting cherry limeaid iccees from burger king.  They were neither cherry flavored nor lime flavored.  A little disconcerting.  Can I just add that I hate it when women who I don't know let their hair touch my skin.  It grosses me out.  I don't care if its clean or not, its just nasty to me for some reason.  I didn't realize how much I hated it until this 7 year old girl kept putting her hair on my arm (by standing to close to me) and I turned to craig and said, if this girl doesn't stop putting her hair on my arm, I am going to rip it out.  Um, WHOA.  I need to calm down or something!  We also had a slight toilet mishap which craig informs me happens all the time to other people, but this was my first time-- so I was screaming help from the bathroom.  ok, break is long enough I think. . . good night all--  Quote of the day (which has turned into dialogue of the day): "I wish I were a cat" "I know you do.  But I don't want you to be one." "why not?" "cause then I wouldn't be able to marry you."

       It seems like the real estate brokers ALWAYS bring people over: i) without notice to me ii) while I am either in my pajamas or without a bra or both and iii) thinking my apartment is a one bedroom.  Its inconsiderate and annoying.  And if this apartment was a one bedroom-- it would be THE cheapest one bedroom apartment in a doorman building in all of manhattan.  What retards-- this is their job-- don't you think they would be suspicious of a very low cost one bedroom in a doorman building (where apt prices are always higher)???    So, I am still trying to stop laughing over the cvs incident.  It was just so funny, if you are ever around craig and I in person (or on phone for that matter) we will replay it for you  dramatic reenactment style.    Yesterday, craig and I tried out a new pizza place in soho for our sunday night pizza.  We had a 10 dollar card-- so it only came out to 16 dollars including tip!!! can you believe it?  we couldn't.  Anyway, it was supposed to be foccacia like pizza (because the place was a self proclaimed foccaciaria).  Not so much.  But we had a pizza with truffle oil on it, and that made me feel important so I didn't care too much.  The waiter was very strange.  He came over to ask us if we wanted dessert, and we both said no (rice to riches was our plan), and he said they have a fabulous tiramasu.  I said, we don't drink coffee so, we don't realy care for tiramasu.  He replies, you drink coffee.  But not in a question, as a statement.  Why would I lie about that?  Jeez.  Rice to riches.  Ok, so craig said he wanted his FOUR rice puddings in installments, so I made good for half yesterday-- and they remain untouched!! He got traditional and milk chocolate.  we shared a lemon with cherries in honor of his mom yesterday at the store.  I got a hazelnut, the usual, and I have been stringent with it.  But yum.  So sunday night pizza is usually followed by Viva la Bam on MTV--- but for some reason, the last 3 weeks it hasn't been on.  So, last night we are sitting on the couch for like 30 minutes, at 845 craig looks at me and says, do you want to go to sleep?  I said yeah, do you want to go to sleep?  he says yeah.  So we went to bed at 9 PM!!!!! Out of control.  And you know how sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and look to see what time it is?  When I did, it would be like 11 or 1-- times that I usually stay up till.   Craig swears there are no tetse flies in NYC, but I think we have african sleeping sickness.    One final note before I return to the books-- yesterday and saturday I spent in townhall reviewing my answers for the MBE.  I took the nights off to relax, figuring I couldn't cram more  than 8 hours worth of information into my pea brain in one day.  Im glad, I was tired.  But I think I am retaining more. . .not everything-- sometimes not even 50% in some subjects, but I am getting there.  Suprisingly, I do the best at the hardest subject-- contracts.  That makes me feel a little proud.  If I have conquer the hard stuff first, then getting up to 50% on the easy stuff should be just mere effort.  I think I can I think I can. . . .

       Wow-- today's quote of the day was quite hilarious Quote of the day:  Craig and I walked into cvs onto this scene.  Old woman, old man (henpecked), Woman: yelling, "come closer to the walker" Man:"yes dear" Ok, so they are still going at it, and craig and I waited in a nearby aisle to listen.   Man:"What do you want me to do?  I will do what ever you want.  I will drop dead if you want me to." meanwhile, cvs cashier: "I need backup up front, I repeat, I need backup up front." The old couple continues-- with today's quote of the day. . . Woman: yelling "Its simple, if you don't want to get hit or pinched, do as you are told."

       so, the next 16 days are not going to be pleasant.  I spent 8 hours today learning how to write the new york essays.  Tommorrow and sunday I will spend 16 hours (total) going over my performance on the MBE.  Fun.  Theater seats are comfortable enough during a show, but man-- anything over 3 hours is killer on your back, legs, knees, and butt.  Oh well, sunday is the last time I have to go back to townhall.  So, I got a response to the message I posted on the jerks website.  He was so kind to post an entire blog-- not apologizing, but explaining why he had every right to post such an asshole message.  Cest la vie.  As I have learned from my elderly friends, you can't win them all.   Craig went up to aurora today to meet with the wedding guy at the aurora inn.  I haven't talked to him yet. . .but he sent me a message that said the inn is perfect.  So that is pretty exciting.  I wish I could have gone with him.   He is so cute.    Quote of the day:  said while being sleepy with craig, "I just want to SQUEEZE YOU" (I was like yelling this) "well do it then honey."  how cute is my cupcake?

       I am going to start the post with the quote of the day, once again. Quote of the day: said to me by a very old woman who stopped me on the street, "Are there any gentlemen left?"  At first I thought she was talking crazy, so I said, "gentlemen?" and she says, yes, well, this man just walked by me and nearly knocked me down.  She sort of shook her head, and smiled that I can't believe people these days smiles.  Then she told me that I looked very nice today.    But, its funny that she asked me that, becuase I was wondering that myself this past weekend.  I mean outside of the remaining few-- my craiggy included-- there are very few respectful people left in this world.  I will tell you about an experience on saturday that nearly sent me over the edge.    I had run to whole foods to get dessert for my folks.  Whole foods is an amazing organic grocery store, and because its so wonderful, there are often unruly lines.  The store has a system where there are three lines, you get in whatever one is shortest-- and they take one person from each line, in order and send them to one of their 27 cashiers.  That way, there is not possble way to pick "the wrong" line.  Quite ingenious really, they all move at the same rate.  Anyway, so one of these lines has a magazine stand at the end of it.  A young, tan, and very fit couple are leafing through magazines at the end of this line.  A very old woman was confused by this system, so she asked the man-- are you in line.  She asked in the most polite innocent way any human could.  The man, with pure contempt and venom replied "OB-viously we are in line.  Why else do you think we were standing here?  God!"  he says this as he takes a sip from his perrier.  I could have smacked him.  I didn't have the balls to say something to him, cause I was afraid of him calling me fat, given that I had 3 desserts and ice cream in my hands.  But the woman in front of him did, she said, there was no need for you to be so rude, you should respect your elders.  His response to her was to kick her with his flipflop, then put his hand up to one inch from her face as if he were going to hit her and he said whatever.  She turned around, smartly, to avoid further escalation of the situation.  I was so upset and appalled, andI still am.  The old woman turned to me, and she shook her head and said "well, that is life I guess.  You win some you lose some.  You can't win them all."  I just nodded my head with a compassionate smile and I wanted to say, I am so sorry that people treat you like that, and I am sorry I didn't stick up for you.  But I couldn't force the words out of my mouth.   That moment has stuck with me for days.  On a more comical lighthearted note, I did something to my cable, now the only channel I can get is that painting show with Bob Ross on PBS.  Weird right?  Im finding it oddly relaxing.  Everything that comes out of his mouth is so positive!!!

       I didn't get much sleep last night so I haven't been very productive today.  I took a practice exam that simulates day two of the bar yesterday at the jacob javits center along with 2 or 3 thousand other bar bri students.  Unfortunately, I self graded my exam and the national average was 105-- mine however was a measly 88.  The average passing raw score is 125.  So I was a bit upset, but the bar bri man said that its possible to pass with as low as a 90 on the MBE, and the average gain in point between yesterday in the bar is usually around 28 points.  If that is true, I should have plenty enough points to pass.  I am trying to stay positive, its hard though when I am below the average in the learning curve.  I guess it just means I will have to work harder.  I still have 18 days.    Today craig and I met with a photographer for our wedding.  I wasn't impressed with his prices, though his work was great.  but he sealed the deal when he made it quite clear that he personally did not want to shoot our wedding, he wanted one of his other "master" photographers to do it.  Screw that man-- I will find someone local to the finger lakes area that is better than you and cheaper.  And I also don't trust a business person who discourages me from sleeping on something that is SO much money.  I think my mind is made up, I hope craig's is too.    I have got a serious weight gain problem.  I can't wait until this stupid bar is over and I have time to run and play again.  And I don't spend hours in my apartment sitting and reading, tempted by the food in the kitchen.  I at least want to be able to fit into my clothes from last summer by the time I start work (so I don't have to buy new suits).  I think that is a sort of reasonable goal.  Craig and I have vowed to do lots of active stuff on our x-country trip.  Im goign to buy a soccer ball so we can play at the campgrounds.  I can't wait.  I think it will be mad fun.  Maybe I should get a basket ball too.  Although It will make me feel like a loser cause craig is so athletic and well, I am so not.    Quote of the day:  While a few friends and I were sharing our scores from yesterdays MBE-- I guess everything is relative "I got a 88, what did you get?" "I got a 81, what did you get?" "I only got 71, thats only a tiny bit better than if I were guessing!"  By the way, it is NOT shrimpS-- the plural is SHRIMP.  Nobody in new york ever says it right. . .  I dont' want linguine with shrimps, or fried shrimps, or lobster with shrimps.

       Well--I will start off this blog with an excerpt from an old friend from high schools blog:  "Allright, get this. An ole time from Nerk Valley I keep up with from time to time has sent me this link...  urlLink click this hunk of shit   WTF is that? I could seriously give a rats ass about that? Should I start take pictures of my beloved and send them all over? Seriously, give me a mother-fucking break.  Here, just in case you're not happy, I am. Thanks internet. Jesus Christ. Who fucking writes a website of a online personal to thank them anyway. I'm writing one that goes like this.  Dear lonely hearts club,  There she was, standing there, in her fuck-me pumps and a tube top, and I knew that we'd hit it off. Or at least I'd toss a shot on her face. And so I did.  Thanks a million find-a-skank!"  Sounds pretty biting and mean right? it almost sent me into tears.  That statement would have hurt coming from a stranger, let alone someone I thought was my friend.  I mean, I know I haven't talked to him in months, but--I didn't know that meant he developed a hatred for me out of nowhere.  It was totally uncalled for and mean.  I was going to put up his link to his website in case you wanted to give him a piece of your mind as well, but I decided that people who act like that don't deserve any psychic energy-- even if its negative.  I have got to learn not to waste time with people who don't care about me.  I am going to start here.  Quote of the day:  This is dedicated to you christopher. . .  "If that is the way he treats the women in his life, then no wonder his wife left him"

       So about a week ago, craig forwarded me a link from the website on which we met; they were looking for success stories.  He asked me to write in because he feels I tell our love story in a "cute" way.  Ok, so I wrote from the heart, read it to craig for approval and emailed it.  I didn't think much of it, www.nerve.com is a huge personals spanning the entire country, so I figured they must get tons of success stories all the time.  Nothing spectacular about me and craig.  So craig forwards me an email from his mom containing the following links. . .  urlLink  new york metro  ,  urlLink  gothamist  ,  urlLink  village voice  .  I connect, and sure enough, there is my email I sent in.  Not only did they not notify me, the only reason I found out about it was b/c of craig's mom (thank you by the way).  Messed up!!!   I had a sort of dissapointing to craig reaction to all this I guess.  He was thrilled that we were included so publicly.  Me, on the other hand, I was quite embarassed.  I never thought of myself of as a private person, but I guess I am.  I didn't think it would be spread around all over the place.  I thought it would be on the nerve and thats it.  I don't like other people knowing my business-- especially since they didn't edit out our names. That was sort of personal declaration of love.  Oh well, I guess there isn't much we can do now.  I just hope that it is not in the print versions of the above as well.  By the way, for those of you in the dark, craig and I met online on a website called www.nerve.com/personals.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  I know people are squeamish about online dating, but everyone I met were  quality individuals-- including craig (obviously).  But I wouldn't trust just any website-- my endorsement is limited to nerve.com-- there is a different sort of crowd on there.  Wanna know a secret?  The only reason I ended up on craig's profile is cause I did a search for people within one mile of my area code who were over 6 feet tall.  Stringent criteria right?  Craig was cute--so I even read all the way to the end of his profile.  Lucky him/me!!  Maybe some other day I will relate the joy of our first date.    Quote of the day: "Tom loves lindsey. platonically. and craig, sexually."  AND!!!!!  "It was like a dutch oven suicide"

       I am too tired to write any substance but I will say I love Twilight zone marathons!! ( I love twilight zone period-- but a marathon is the best.  did you know rod serling is from binghamton?)  Quote of the day: said at the end of the macy's fireworks display, "How come nobody is singing?" "why would anybody be singing?" "cause its the FOURTH OF JULY!!!"

       Quote of the day: (this is actually a conversation, but its my blog so I say it counts)  while looking at a photograph of a girl, "Look, she has man hands." "what are man hands?" "If you look just at her hands, you would think you were looking at a man." "Her hands look like your hands."

       So my cupcake just left, and I can't help being sad-- even though it is only for 24 hours.  I hope he has a lot of fun-- enough for both of us.   Luckily I will be busy the next 24 hours-- keep me preoccupied.  My folks are on their way down as I speak and they are actually going to spend the night !!!  Im happy about that, I needed some parental love as I prepare to face a big challenge.  I also agreed to cat sit my old 5th ave. neighbors cats, so I have to go over and do that.  Its really wierd being there again.  I lived there for two years so being there now is all out of context.  Yesterday when I was unlocking the front door, my heart was racing.  Hopefully that doesn't happen again.  I made craig meet me over there so he could see the kitten, thinking he would be so touched, but he wasn't too impressed.  This little guy is so cute, you can hold him in one hand.  :)  Oh well, I guess craig is a dog person. period.   Besides all of the above, I am doing studying of course... and I also want to stop at express, I bought two button down shirts yesterday, and while they aren't name brand-- they are in my budget-- and they fit me perfectly (meaning- they fit AND don't bulge open in the bust area).  So I want to get a couple more to wear to work since they are on sale.  some times it really sucks having boobs, I would gladly go back to my B cups I was once blessed with.    But anyway, I am on a search, and while I am in the best place in the world to do it, I am not having any luck.  I am looking for pointy high heel shoes (like I always wear) that are black patent leather.  I saw a girl wearing them with a conservative suit the other day, and it was just the right touch of sass.  The problem is, I can't find any that aren't out of my budget.  So if you eye any-- let me know!!  Later peeps, I gotta brush the birds nest out of the back of my hair, I was having horrible dreams last night, so I was tossing my head around and now its all matted.  HOT!

       I decided to add a new feature (thanks to gini's creativity-- it sparked mine!) Quote of the day!   Today's quote of the day is ridiculous!  "I like it when you pretend you're retarded"  If you can guess who said it, I will eat a teddy graham in your honor!

       Its july already, can you believe it?  The bar is less than a month away-- 24 days if you are counting (which I am apparently).  I haven't been blogging as much because I have been really super studious-- and not just pretending.  I started making flash cards. . . it is so helpful!!!  As a result, craig is learning NY law too.  He knows how to properly execute a Will in NY state.  I think that is so cute, but only because I know how to execute a will  too-- otherwise I would pry be upset.    I have been searching for the perfect pair of linen pants for craig for months now-- a few purchases and a few returns later-- I found the perfect pair.  And I must say there is nothing more attractive then a man in linen pants, the bottoms rolled up  with a pair of leather sandals on.  Craig looks so good in them-- I know I am biased, but seriously people-- he's HOT!  He's so tall and lean that he looks like a model.  I actually bought them so that when we go to the beach(es) this summer he can wear them in the evening and I can make every other girl within eyesight jealous of me :)  Craig and I had an ephiphany the other night-- as a result, we are going to eat in more-- with me doing the meal planning.  So I bought squash, spinach, chicken and potatoes for dinner the other night.  I sauteed the yellow and green squash with the spinach with olive oil and garlic-- YUM.  So we are eating dinner and everything on craigs plate is gone--except for a HUGE pile of yellow squash.  Apparently craig is not a big fan of it. . .   I hope he is feeling daring, cause I am making acorn squash for dinner tonight.  (Im a country girl. . . we love our squash!)   I just saw on itunes that there is a band called saliva. . . people, if you can't come up with a better name than that for your band, you aren't creative enough to take up space in itunes or any other music store.     Buy your mega millions people its 280 million-- which means that the value of each ticket is more than 1 dollar (what you pay for it-- taking into consideration future value).  Enough nerdance-- just buy em up-- its worth it!

       So, I forgot to relay a funny story-- we all love those.  On monday evening I had family over for a celebratory barbeque (engagement/graduation).  I also invited one of my future co-workers-- a girl I interned at HHK with last summer.  So I sent an evite out that said as the location-- schecter's house of fun.  Ok, not everyone knows my last name is different than my parents, but my family does of course, so I didn't think much of it.  (although, for the record, rachel has been to my parent's house before and knows earle schecter personally so. . .)  anyway, so everybody is at the house, we are all chowing down and then much later rachel and her husband show up.  she starts saying how they got lost on the way here, and so they pulled over and asked someone for directions to schecter's house of fun!  She thought it was a restaurant or something-- HA!!!  The lady was like, I have never heard of that, sorry.  Later on her husband put two and two together and they finally arrived.   Today, I was running some errands and I stopped in one of the two stores in binghamton that sells designer clothing (when I say designer I mean  like nicole miller, paper denim, anna sui, etc).  So In the store its just me and the sales guy.  I must be jaded by living in chelsea or something, cause I am SO afraid of gay men now.  He keeps asking me if he can help me and all sorts of little chit chat, and so I told him what I was looking for, something to wear to get pictures taken.  Ok, great, he sizes me up and down and pulls out a cute white blazer with blue grosgrain ribbon trim.  He says wear this with pearls, you will look great.  (im thinking, yeah, I will look stepford wive great. . .) I tried it on, it was cute, but it would need too much tailoring to fit right and personally, I didn't think it was worth it.  It had a matching skirt (so technically it was a suit jacket).  I had the whole suit on and he was like, its so versatile you can wear it to work. . . I said are you kidding?  We're not in the deep south. . . only southern lawyers wear light suits, and even then its seer sucker.  Ihope I wasn't too insulting. but anyway-- the point to all this was, I had picked up this beautiful nicole miller silk chiffon dress with a silk satin band around the waist, under the bust.  I tried it on first cause I fell in love with it.  I come out of the dressing room, and I look in the mirror and realize how much weight I have gained and so I shake my head and say I don't think this is right.  He says, yeah, that's not really very flattering especiall in  your hips.  It was weird, because at that moment, I realized, this was the first time a salesperson was honest with me, to the point of hurting my feelings a little.  I was so pleased though.  Sometimes we need to hear from a third party that our hips are too big for a particular article of clothing.  It also made me realize I have exactly 5 weeks to lose enough weight that my suits fit again.    as long as it doesn't rain, Im going for a jog tonight.

       I have been so busy!! my goodness people!  I have about half my stuff unpacked now, mostly the stuff I use everyday-- like clothes makeup etc.  My room is in working order and fairly organized ( although probably not up to craig's standards yet).  I probably won't be either until I get back from the trip.   So my mom took the cats to the vet today, my two girls and one of my mom's cats codi.  So poor codi-- he lost one ear before we got him (its folded over from ear mites) and one eye had to be removed about 6 months ago due to a bad infection.  Hes had a rough time.  So the vet was testing him to make sure he didn't have feline leukemia or Feline imunodeficiency virus.  Poor thing, he has the kitty version of AIDS.  He doesn't have any symptoms, which is good, but its been decided, my girls and my mom's boys have to be permanently segregated for the entire time I live in this house.  I just can't risk codi biting one of my sweethearts and giving them FIV-- I would just die.  Other than that bad news, all the kitties are in good health.  The girls didn't even need any shots.  They will be back in september to get their teeth cleaned though--- yuck!   On the way out, I had the two crates (with a kitty in each one), stacked one on top of the other, and they were on a dolly type wheely thing cause they are too heavy to carry with my back hurting the way it has been.  So I get to about 10 feet from the car BAM! chewey's crate falls off and lands on its roof.  I thought she was dead, she was ok, just very scared.  Im a bad mom. So, I dropped craig off at the bus station this afternoon to go back to new york.  I pick him up on thursday, as long as things go as planned to leave for DC.  I can't decide if time is flying or going slowly.  I have so much to do, but I am so excited to get on the road.   In preparation for all the beach visits, I went tanning today.  I only went in for 6 minutes, but I am all red-- nice!   allright time to hit the sack. . . got a lot left to do tommorrow!
