      yo, today was pretty boring considering the things I should have done today but was just too lazy.  I woke up and started filling out some apps when brett called me and wanted to see if i wanted to hit up angelo's with them, i did and it was good but they had to get back to work at 100.  I went straight home and finished filling out most of the apps and just watched tv for a pretty long while.  I called Richie but he was hanging out with Edna so I didn't turn in my apps.  I decided to go to the mall and get Brittney her sweatband so I told my mom I was gonna buy a sweatband for myself and then she gave me money for some gym shorts too.  I went to the mall and looked in a couple stores but none of them had the same wristband.  Thinking back on it I probably should've gotten her one that was similar but if I did that, I wouldn't have had enough money for the gym shorts I bought, so it was a trade off.  I got two pairs and then met my parents and Donny (my bro) at Taco Joes for dinner.  Brett was in band practice and messaged me to find out the score to the lakers game.  Of course I didn't know so I told him that I couldn't give it to him. Then Brittney messaged me.  Last night before I went to bed I messaged her saying "have fun at grad night" and this morning she messaged back and said thanks but I didn't think she would want to start getting into the whole talking thing again.  The message said "Richie told me to say hi to you".  I didn't know what to say to that so i just replied "what a great friend!" then she was just asking what i was doing and stuff and we went home and started watching the basketball game when she called me.  I picked up and she said that she was tired of messaging me and wanted to talk.  We just talked about grad night and she said that her friend Jenna had kind of blown her off to hang out with some guys or something and she had to hang out with people she didn't know too well.  Then she told me that I have to go with her next year because it would be more fun.  I started saying that I wasnt going to miss my grad night for Loma linda's but then I just didn't feel like doing the whole teasing thing so I told her I'd go to both. Whatever.  Her cell started breaking up and she said that she would call me when she got home.  I went to the gym a little bit after that to work out and brittney never called.  This kind of pisses me off, not because i really wanted to talk to her but because she basically lied to me.  stupid bitch.  oh well, im just gonna let it slide this time.  I don't know where this relationship between me and brittney is going but I'm gonna kind of ride it out.  If it progresses more then I'm gonna try to get at least one more kiss out of her ;) but if it doesn't move any further then I'm not gonna care too much.  There's millions of other girls that are better looking and a little better at controlling their mood swings than brittney.  She's just really fun to hang around and she's incredibly beautiful.  Fuck, i hope i'm not falling for her again.  Ok, she's actually really ugly and she's a bitch.  But for some reason I like her bitchiness, dammit.  Whatever, I think I like brittney again, but then again it could just be the fatigue talking.  I'll see if i still her tomorrow haha.  Well, you guys can catch the vapors as i be off and up out.

      It's Wednesday night and yesterday was the last day of school! AFter school got out I was chillin with Brandon, BRett, and Richie when Richie got a call from Edna.  She was with Brittney and they wanted us to come over to Edna's house.  Brett and Brandon had band practice so we went over there.  As we got there, Jenna was leaving so Edna and Brittney were in the driveway.  We stayed out there and talked for a long time. Richie was being kind of quiet and i was trying to make jokes and have a good time.  Brittney and Edna were asking me why I'm so negative all the time cause Jenna told them that she thought i was a negative person.  This made me think about the things I've said and it doesn't seem like I'm very negative, but I just like to tease the girls a lot.  Either way, I'm gonna watch what I say and see if I actually am negative.  If so, I'll just be a little careful and that bad little trait will go away.  Anyway, after talking for a while, Brittney and Edna wanted to get their snack on so we hit up in-n-out.  I sat in the front seat and Brittney drove, Edna and rich were in the back.  But the cool thing was that Brittney went to some christian concert thing a couple weeks ago and got some drum sticks, so I was playin along with all the songs on her dashboard.  I think I'm gonna have to go to guitar center and buy some of thems for my car.  We went back to Edna's and decided to watch a movie, so we popped in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  I hadn't seen it and I must say, its a good movie.  I especially like one quote from it :    "Cameron has never been in love - at least, nobody's ever been in love with him. If things don't change for him, he's gonna marry the first girl he lays, and she's gonna treat him like shit, because she will have given him what he has built up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existence. She won't respect him, 'cause you can't respect somebody who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work."     This quote is a good underlying theme for what I'm trying to do with Brittney and, most likely, other girls in the future.  I didn't sit next to Brittney on the couch fortunately and for some reason Richie and Edna didn't sit together either.  Their relationship is seriously fishy.  I'm starting to wonder how long Edna's going to put up with Richie's apparent disinterest in showing affection.  Oh well.  After the movie me and richie decided to go to the new LA Fitness and see if we could get a 1 week trial and brittney had to leave too.  We talked in the driveway for a few minutes and Brittney just decided to leave and walked to her truck.  Edna went over to her and gave her a hug and said goodbye and I wanted to do something different so I walked over to give her a hug too.  On the way Edna put her arms out and i gave her a hug, "wow, this is a first" she said.  In reality I think it was.  I went over to Britt's truck with my arms out and she got all excited and gave me the biggest bear hug for like 30 seconds.  I just said wow and got in the car to go to the gym.  Come to think of it, I don't recall Richie giving Edna a hug (and definitely not a kiss) goodbye, but they could've sneaked one in while I was being suffocated by Brittney's iron hug of death.  Also I was wearing one of Brittney's Famous Stars and Straps sweatbands and I kind of stretched it out so I think I might go to the mall tomorrow when I'm turning in apps and buy her a new one.  That should be a pretty cool surprise for her.  We left and went to the gym around 1100 and got a one week trial.  We only worked out for like 40 minutes but it was a good warmup after being pretty docile for the past few months.  Went home, went to bed afterwards and today richie and i went and got some apps for a summer job then rode the 50 at the wash for a while and hit the gym with Brett and Brandon.  We stayed for about 2 hours and it was really fun.  I'm actually still stronger than BRett in my shoulders which was somewhat surprising to me, but I am built bigger so that's one advantage.  Brandon was being embarrasing as usual and could barely bench 75 pounds which everyone thought was pretty funny.  Later on we met a guy named Louis who owns a couple car audio shops and drives a brand new BMW 745Li with 22" rims.  We talked to him after the gym for like 30 minutes and then we went home.

      It's a little bit later on Monday night and the one thing i never thought would happen just did.  Brittney called me.  And not only that she just called me to talk, like before when we first met and were thinking of dating each other.  This is pretty weird, i was half expecting her to be pissed at me for a week or two and we not really talk for while, but this happened!  haha, I love girls, they're the weirdest things in the world, but I love em.  I'm deciding right now to just have fun with these relationships and not take anything too seriously.  There's plenty more fish in the sea and who knows, being an "asshole" and "bitch" might just score you a girlfriend.  Maybe she likes having someone who doesn't just conform to whatever she wants. I'm gonna have fun seeing how this turns out.  But if she keeps acting like a bitch, she's gonna get more of that stuff that she loves ;). This is Trav, out.

      Today is Monday.  My friend Brandon got his PA installed yesterday so we've been driving around town playing ice cream man music and talking to people from the truck, it's pretty fun (not exactly the best way to pick up chicks though).  Also, we were bored so we rode the little 50 down at the wash with Brett's quad and BRandon's goped.  Anyway, after that we were bored so Brett just decided to call Brittney from my phone and pretend it was me.  I haven't called her in weeks and the first thing she said was "why are you calling me?" in her usual snobby, half-bitchy way.  She immediately knew it was Brett and he was just casually talking to her, asking her what she was doing and stuff.  After that we went driving with the PA and decided to go to Edna's house cause Richie was there.  They were out front talkikng and so we were all just chillin for a few minutes when my phone rang.  It was Brittney asking what i was doing.  I told her i was at Edna's and she said that she just drove by there and maybe she should stop by.  I, half-joking half-serious, said "naa, that's ok".  She proceeded to call me a jerk and i just laughed then she hung up the phone.  We left Edna's and were driving for a little while more when Brittney called again just to tell me that I was a bitch and an asshole blah blah blah.  I just laughed at her and told her that I like it when she talks to me like that.  She hung up and that was that.  A little while ago I was chatting with Edna and she was telling me how Brittney thought i was mean and stuff.  I just laughed and asked her if Brittney knew how to take a joke.  She said she didn't know but she (Edna) didn't think i was a bitch or whatever, so I don't really care.    I'm actually pretty proud of myself for doing this.  This was pretty much the first time Brittney was mad at me without me breaking down and trying to appease her.  I like to put her in her place every once in a while because of how she thinks that she's so much better than everyone likes her and stuff.  It was really fun just laughing at her when she was trying to make me turn into my old wussy self and I'm really glad to have made it to the point where I don't care if Brittney's mad at me.     I may have come off as a jerk saying this stuff but if you knew Brittney, you would know that she is truly just a snob (I wouldn't go as far as bitch) and I think she really needs to have someone let her know that she's not better than everyone else.  I treat a bitch like a bitch, a lady like a queen.  out.

      Hello, my name is Travis and this is my first time ever using blogs but it seems interesting so I'm gonna try it out.  I live near San Bernardino, CA (So Cal) and I'm a going to be a Senior at Redlands High School in this upcoming school year.  My life over the past month or two has been mostly occupied by an incredibly strange, interesting, and above all beautiful girl whom I happened to meet through a friend.  Her name is Brittney and she has sent me on an emotional roller coaster ride like nothing I've ever experienced in my life.  I'll start at the beginning.  My friend Richie had taken notice of a cheerleader at Loma Linda Academy (we go to Redlands High) and decided he wanted to meet her.  He finally got to talking to her and eventually became friends, so I was inevitably introduced to her.  I talked to her quite a bit online at first trying to help my friend's chances with her.  I really liked talking to Edna but never tried go out with her myself due to the fact that Richie liked her.  Well, eventually Edna wanted me to meet her friend Nikki (also a cheerleader) so we set up a casual meeting thing where Richie and one of Nikki's friends were gonna be there so it wasnt too awkward.  Well, Richie and I arrived at Starbucks and Nikki was there.  Unfortunately, she wasn't very attractive to me and she was pretty quiet too.  But her friend...wow.  She only stayed for about 15 minutes to talk and then she had to leave but she was incredibly beautiful and fun and talkative.  Her name was Brittney and I was pretty dissapointed that she had to leave and I was stuck with Nikki.  Me and Nikki talked for a while and never really progressed our relationship any further.  The next weekend Richie and my other friend Doug were going over to Nikki's house because Edna, Nikki, and Brittney were all hanging out there.  I went too and knew that if I acted all quiet and shy like I used to be around girls then I wasn't going to get very far with any of these girls so the whole time at Nikki's I was talking to everyone, not just clinging to Brittney, and making jokes and just felt relaxed and wasn't really trying to impress anyone.  I basically treated everyone like we've known each other for a long time.  I think we met again a few days later and I was messing with her phone and wanted her number so I sent a text message from her phone to mine.  The next week was out spring break (Brittney had hers the week before) and at the beginning of the week I went to the lake with my friend.  On the way out there I sent Brittney a text message that said something like "who is this?" and she replied like "you messaged me, who are you?". Well, she was talking to edna and found out that this "mystery number" was mine and so she called me saying that i was dumb (jokingly) and blah blah blah.  So throughout the time at the lake we were text messaging each other back and forth and one night I just decided to ask her out to lunch when I got back.  She accepted and I was happy.  I got back on Wednesday night and she was doing a project at Nikki's and asked if i wanted to come over so I did.  They finished shortly after I got there and I walked her to her car where we talked for about 20 minutes or so.  While we were talking, she told me that she had been talking to Doug quite a bit too and he asked her on a date for Saturday night before I asked her out, as you can probably tell, this didn't make me feel too good but she acted like she didn't really want to go on the date with him but didn't want to be mean or whatever so I just kind of let it go. The next day i was really tired when we went to lunch (breakfast for me) and didn't really talk much.  When we went back to the school we saw Richie and Edna in the parking lot so we were gonna go talk to them but before we got out of the car I had to talk to Brittney.  I told her that I wasn't going to put up with her dating both me and doug at the same time and she told me that she really wanted to go out with me but she already accepted doug's offer and couldn't back out now.  I wasn't happy with this but she basically told me that she wanted to be my girlfriend so I was cool.  I talked to Edna and Richie and some other peeps and then left.  Everyone was chillin at Nikki's again on Friday night so I went over there.  We were watching a movie and Doug had to leave at 10 so it was just me, brittney and nikki and maybe another person or two, i was just glad that doug was gone.  Anyway, Brittney was fighting for space on one of the couches with nikki and so i offered her a seat next to me.  She took and was leaning on me and we were holding hands and stuff.  It was fun, I was happy.  She had to leave at 1100 so I walked her to her car again and we were talking.  She mentioned how she was cold so I pulled the old "I'll warm you up" trick and we were hugging out in the front yard.  After a little while we were still hugging and she leaned back and we were looking at each other in silence.  I thought to myself 'what the hell' and kissed her.  We were kissing for a few minutes (she was a great kisser) and then we had to leave.  I was on top of the world.  Brittney was so amazing and I was going to go out with her!  Or so I thought.  The next night was doug and brittney's little date and we were all hanging out together all day until about 6 when Doug decided to take her for himself.  I was really upset and I guess it showed because Edna and Richie were telling me how I was acting kind of weird (I didn't really notice) but it turns out that it was a pretty bad date.  They just went to a fancy restaurant, Doug wasted his money, and then they came back.  Doug had to leave early again and it was basically a repeat of the night before (yes, more kissing =D).  Basically, the next few weeks went like this: I was trying to hang out with Brittney after school and stuff and she kept coming up with these bullshit excuses and from talking to Doug and Edna, found out that she was trying to decide which one to go out with.  This really pissed me off and for some reason Doug was cool with it (I guess he likes it when girls play games with him).  I gave up on trying to hang out with her so much and we talked on the phone quite a bit and saw each other on the weekends where we would flirt a lot but no more kissing =( .  We found out that Nikki was basically in love with Doug and so Brittney came up with some shit about how that made both me and him off limits for her.  I still talked to her on the phone quite a bit and saw her on a regular basis.  Then all of a sudden prom came up, Richie asked Edna, Doug asked Nikki, and I was deciding on whether to ask Brittney or not.  Then one morning Richie and I were late for school so we went to get some breakfast at baker's when Brittney messaged him and asked him to find her a date for prom.  So I was like wtf? I guess she'd rather go to prom with some stranger than go with me.  I talked to Edna and she told me that Brittney thought I was going with Alicia (one of the hottest girls at our school) for some reason and that's why she was trying to get a date through Richie.  It reeked of some BS but I wanted to go to prom so I decided to ask her.  I got her some flowers and asked her after her cheer practice one day.  She said yes and I was pretty happy about it.  This whole time I was going back and forth about whether or not Brittney liked me and whether I should try to go out with her and my mind was changing pretty much on an hourly basis.  She was driving me insane.  I had no idea if she liked me or not.  This prom thing gave me some confidence but I still wasn't sure what she wanted.  Suddenly one day, there was a huge ordeal.  Brittney invited me to the park by ourselves because she had to tell me something important.  She said that Edna still had a crush on me and actually wanted to go out with me in the beginning but settled for Richie because he was the one pursuing her and she liked him a little bit anyway. She was also asking me if i'd ever consider going out with Edna, if she and Richie broke up.  This whole time I'm thinking what the fuck kind of a question is this? and I told her that I don't like Edna and I wouldn't go out with her even if she did break up with Richie and stuff.  Anyway, we went to where Richie and Edna had been and Edna left but Richie was still there.  He was acting all pissed off and went up to Brittney like "what are you doing? Are you trying to break us up?" and told her to stop this shit that she was doing, then left.  I stayed for a couple minutes and talked to Brittney, then went home.  Richie and Doug showed up at my house later and told me about how Edna was basically crying because she thought Brittney was trying to break them up and everyone was just basically mad at Brittney.  Brittney called me on the phone crying later that night because she found out that Edna and Nikki were talking shit about her that day I was trying to help her out, but eventually Edna called her and Brittney, Edna, and Richie all met at some park and talked it out.  Richie came to my house right afterwards and I asked him what happened, he said "Me brittney and edna are all cool now" so i asked him what she said and why she was doing that and he said "I can't tell you". So, once again, I'm thinking what the fuck?  Anyway, after that ordeal brittney text messaged me and and said "so are we on for prom, or do you still think im an ify person?" so I messaged her back and said "well maybe if you told me why you were lying to everyone and stuff I wouldn't think you were an ify person".  BIG mistake.  Apparently, calling someone a liar usually makes them pretty mad.  I found this out when Edna called me and said how i was a jerk and needed ot apologize to Brittney right away and blah blah blah.  So i called her up and apologized and tried to explain my reasoning (and I'm not the type of person to just apologize for every little thing, i actually mean it) and afterwards I asked her, "so are we going to prom still?" and she says "I dont know about that anymore, i think calling me a liar was pretty rude" or some bullshit like that, so I just said fuck it and told her I'd talk to her later.  Later that week I decided I'd had just about enough of Brittney and her little games and whatnot (a lot of which I left out due to the sake of space and time) so I called her up and told her that i didn't want to go to prom with her anymore.  She seemed somewhat shocked but not too dissapointed and I just told her I'd see her later.  About 10 minutes after hanging up I get a text message that says "I was gonna save it for prom, but now it doesn't matter when I say it, I really like you".  I didn't take much heed to this message but i couldn't help but wonder what would've happened if i'd just stuck with her bullshit and took her to prom, if she actually would have asked me.  But the world doesn't run on what if's so it doesn't matter.  I talked to her the next day but she didn't say anything about prom so I just decided that she was fine with not going.  That weekend (the one before prom) I went to the lake with just my family and was pretty bored and missed my friends, I had a lot of time to think about the whole thing and suddenly felt this incredible attraction for Brittney again.  I messaged Edna and told her that I wanted to ask Brittney to prom again and if she actually did like me.  She said that she did and she really wanted to go with me so I decided I was going to ask her.  On Monday she went straight home after school and I was busy until about 9:00 when I called her and asked her if I could come up to her house to ask her something (i didn't want to do it on the phone) she said that her parents said it was too late so I decided to try again the next day. I called her and she made up some bullshit excuse about how she was going shopping all day and then had to study for a big Biology test, i knew that she was making it up and that she knew what i was going to ask her but didn't want to go, so i gave up.  I didn't talk to her at all for about a week until i was at the lake again on prom weekend and she called me about 6:30 on prom night. "What's up? what are you doing?" I told her i was driving the boat and couldn't talk.  We text messaged a couple times over the next few days but then stopped talking again.  Which brings us to two days ago. Friday.  Edna called Richie and asked him if he was hanging out with me, he said no and that Brittney was at her house and they were bored.  She asked if he wanted to come over but i guess he didn't really feel like it so he told her that he was going to my house.  He showed up and said that he talked to brittney, who was at edna's, and she was saying how she wanted me to go over to edna's with richie to hang out.  Richie told her to call me and ask her herself but she didn't want to i guess.  So Richie, Brett, Brandon, and I all just chilled at my crib for a little while when Edna called Richie again and invited him and me to go to Mimi's.  1) I didn't want to go to Mimi's and 2) I didn't want to see brittney and have this whole ordeal start up again so I said I wasn't going.  Brett and Richie ended up meeting them there and Richie told me how boring it was and that he shouldn't have gone and stuff, so I felt better.  The next day, yesterday, Saturday, I went to church, which is where we usually meet up for the day and then decide what we're doing and Brittney was there.  I decided I was going to say hi but she was just talking to Richie and never even looked at me.  Afterwards I was talking to Richie and she came up and asked him what we were doing that day.  I told her we were hittin up ChinaTown and she went on about how gross it was or something and so Richie and I started heading for the cars when brett called me and asked if he could come.  I said sure and went to pick him up when Richie called and said Brittney wanted us to go to Spaghetti Factory with them for lunch.  I decided it would be all right and we all met up and Jenna's house, then left from there.  We talked like usual and Brittney was kind of trying to flirt with me but I didn't really pay attention to it.  After that, she asked what we were all doing and I said we were gonna go swimming at brett's.  She had to do something for about an hour too and she asked "so is this goodbye? or are we gonna do something later?"  I quickly said "goodbye" and she just said all right and we left.  LAter that night, Richie was gonna go to class night and hang out with edna and brittney called me and asked me to go.  I said I'd meet em there but wasn't sure if i was going to stay.  It cost 2 bucks to get in and I didn't have any money so I headed for the car after talking for a couple minutes and brittney ran over and grabbed my arm and started pulling me so i decided to stay.  I sat next to Brittney during the show and she was leaning on me and stuff but i never acted on it.  AFter the show we were gonna go to Wendy's but it was closed so we all just kind of left without much of a goodbye.  And then today (Sunday) I just hung out with Brandon and Richie all day, we usually don't see the girls on sunday anyway.  And that's the story of me and Brittney over the past month with some details omitted.  I know this thing is lllooooonnnnggggg. But I wanted to tell that story and I'll keep this blog updated about how things with me and this strange, interesting, beautiful girl go.
