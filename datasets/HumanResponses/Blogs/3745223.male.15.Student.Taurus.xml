      Where to start? ok, get this. there is more to me then getting in and out of trouble and joking and all the stuff i mostly do with noah lol.  i can be serious, i just have trouble talking about what i think.  right now i feel pissed off because i dont want to go to my uncles wedding tomorrow.  its not that im mad at any of my family, i just dont want to have to do the whole process, you know, when i put on a suit, act all conservative, and kiss ass to a bunch of realitves who dont know a thing about me, and if i told them more then one thing theyd say i was stupid or something. or theyd think it at least.  i hate having to conform to these people. fuck that.  im not feeling that good anyway.  maybe its that i really havent had good sleep in like a week, ive been up all night at least five times since i got here, and had a total of like ten hours of sleep in the past week.  havent really been hungry either. thats another weird thing. anyway, today i didnt sleep and we went over to justins at like six in the morning and stuff.  he went back to noahs with me, noah and jake, and then i must have fell asleep for about an hour.  his mom was on him to do his chores, so me and justin left, and i went home and sat on my ass waiting for "the gang" as jake calls it to get back from bike riding. well they didnt get back till like four, and stuff. i was gonna go to the mall with sam, cari and zach, and caris aunt was gonna take us which i wasnt all into cause i heard she was real bitchy and i wasnt in the mood be around bitchy people. well sams mom ended up taking us, and seeing as how i like sams mom i was happy. jake came to.  noah was passed out at home so he wasnt there.  the mall sucked cause jake kept on leaving us for his "girlfriend" and i was so spaced out.  then we went back to sams and watched some adam sandler movie and stuff.  i kept remembering that i was going to ask cari out, and if youre reading this and havent figured that out then fuck you.  but i started to think what i had thought before, that one, i dont even know her, i just like the fact that shes like the closest thing this state has to a real alternative, and two, even if she were to go out with me what would be the point? i go back to ohio next week and theres no point in even bothering with it.  and again, if you read this and are laughing at my problems then fuck you, theres a million more websites you can go to.  its not that i dont like her or that im to pussy to ask, i just dont see the point. so anyways, its like late now and i have to go get my new suit for the wedding tomorrow so yea i better get going. i really dont plan on making long entries like this, i just had alot to say and this is my first so whatever.ktp and love always
