      I will be working on a new software project. My first real attempt. It will be a PHP dealy with mysql and probably javascript I imagine.   I have the database set up and have been able to pulldata out of the db and put it on a web page.   Currently working on getting data to the db from a web form. A little trickier, but thanks to Bastien at http://www.phpworld.com/board/read.php?f=1&i=17860&t=17860 I think I am close.

      Well, it's over. Last Sunday , July 18, 2004 was my first triathlon:  325 yard swim,  11.5 mile bike,  3.25 mile run.     My Time was 1 hour 18 minutes 16 seconds.  Not terrible. I was in the top 3/4's.      It was very fun, very intense, and much harder than I expected. Training in the gym helps, but I realized I need to train more intensly. In my training I focused on doing two things: swim then run.   I trained bike/run only twice, and it wasn't even on my bike, but a gym stationary. I thought concentrating on swim and run would compensate for my weaknesses. I just didn't realize how weak I was on the bike.     I started to realize it the week before the Tri when I biked 10  miles then ran 3.25. It was an eye opener.     It took me about 5 minutes to recover from the bike while I was running. By then it was too late to really train that way. Oh well, live and learn.   I will be training differently for next year.     The biggest surprise for me was the swim, which was in a lake as opposed to a pool.   Just a hint for anyone else doing their first time tri, train in the lake as much as possible.   Advice point number 2- really concentrate on relaxing.     This is how it happens. You get in the lake with the people in your heat. My heat consisted of 46 guys between 35-39. The horn blows then you are diving in, trying to avoid getting kicked, and trying to keep up with or pass everyone else. You also realize how murky the water is, even with gogles, and that you have to lift your head up out of the water completely to see where you are going.     By the time I go to the first bouy I realized I had been sprinting the whole way, and was out of breath, and holding my head out of the water was getting harder, and messing up my rythm. This forced me to alternate between breast stoke and freestyle, made it difficult to get my breath back, and just pissed me off.     The rest of the race went much better.   The bike was much harder than the meager training I had done for it. Switching gears and such, but ah well more taining! It was very exhilaratinig.  I was amazed at how good it felt to pass people too, and how sucky it was to get passed.  The competitive spirit is deep.       The run was my best event. 3.25 miles in 27 minutes 08 seconds. Not my best, but I was happy.  One thing I really liked about the Triathlon was the supportive attiude of the other athletes, and the spectators.  As I was finishing up the run I tried to sprint as fast as I could. I came around the second to the last bin, going up hill to the fininsh, with lots of people cheering me, and those in front of me on,  and I heard a guy, I imagine one of the guys who already finished, he sounded like a coach, a very authoritative voice, called out to me, "Way to dig 216!" Then a few seconds later I was done.     There was a fire truck spewing water high into the air so people could cool down after the race. I shambled ove to the merciful fountain, in a daze, with those word echoing in my head.  In fact I have been hearing echos of them all week.     Now, a week later almost I feel strangely empty. The goal I had been working towards for the last few months is not there anymore. There are a couple more events in my area, but they both have signifigantly longer swims; I think I will wait until next year to try them.     What a great experience though. Can't wait for next year.     If you're interested here are the numbers:    Overall place out of 333 : 175        Age group : 35- 39         Swim  325   yards: 7:40   Place: 217          Bike   11.5  Miles: 43:29  Place: 189         Run    3.25  Miles: 27:08  Place: 152          Overall Time: 1:18:16

      Furl is a really cool web service that allows you to bookmark a page and also archive a copy of it (So if the page dies, you still have a copy), and the bookmarks and archived pages are kept on the furl server. So you can bookmark something at work or at a friend's house, or wherever, then go home and still access it.  I used to go nuts because I am required to use different browsers, and would do research from both my office and my house, and would always seem to lose an important link, because I couldn't remember where it was saved. I tried a couple different soulutions but none as useful or cool as Furl. Furl is a great tool for research, and for fun, and you can see what other people are Furling at the Furl home page. It kind of makes you feel you have a finger on the pulse of the internet.   Emergent Behavior?  I have been reading about emergent and self-organizing behavior in complex systems lately and Furl seems like it is something that will lead to this, if it isn't already. Hmmm, how can we tell when a system is truly exhibiting emergent behavior? I don't know- but I get that emergent feeling quite often when I am surfing  the Furl.   There are some blog article popping up that give you tips and hints on how to extend (emerge?) the use of Furl. Here's a couple cool links:  urlLink 10 Cool Things to Do with Furl   and  urlLink  More Furl Tricks .  One thing I think is really cool about Furl is the ability to export to XML and  RSS feeds. Furl Explains how to give people the RSS feed to your Furl Archive. Mine is  urlLink http://www.furl.net/members/noondesertsky/rss.xml  .    My first Furl Hack:Furl News Ticker  A cool thing I did was to get a free RSS news Ticker from  urlLink RSSNewsTicker  and I put my own archive's RSS feed into it and Furl's "Most recently Furled" RSS feed into it, so now I have a Furl News Ticker! Pretty cool I thought.   urlLink Library Chic  has a cool article about Furl and XML. One suggestion for Furl would be to include more help on how to use xml and Furl.   Over to the left are the latest links from my Furl Archive, (no fancy xml, just Furl's javascript).   One last thing, I also really like that you can subscribe to other people's Furl archive. I have a few I follow because its cool following another's path through the wilderness for a while.  My archive is :  urlLink http://www.furl.net/members/noondesertsky   So check out Furl:   urlLink Furl - Your web page filing cabinet
