      ughh i am soo annoyed with this 1 specical person...she came to my school only a year and a half after i left she's a nice person and all but she's ebrassin to be around...becasue she came she ruined our friendship all i do is bitch at her when she's around. I bet if she still was at her old school i wouldnt be so mad cuz i wouldnt have to see her every fuckin day...she's would always be around me and my friends at lunch in class EVERYWHERE never with any1 else becasue she has annoied every1 to the point where u just want to kill her. THank god its summer :D:D but still she can still connect me with the phone..ahhh well i can always hope she'll find friends and give me space!!! ughh well im going to try and not be pissed off even other she has only been at my school for half a year!!! and i already hope she leaves (which is unlikly) or dies or ahhhh just soo mad and AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  ok im leavin before i say stuff i'll regret!! laterz!

      Do u ever wonder who u are? Sometimes i do...Who is megan d'angelo? I feel like i can change at anytime...thats not how it should be...so i sit here confused if i can change so easily than who am i really? no one has answers so i will continue to think in this light purple flowered box room untill i find myself...dunno when or how but i will...just have to...i think this unknowing is the key to a few things...like why i havnt had a boyfriend...if i dunno who i am i have nothing..nothing...

      Tomrrow Me and Katie are suppose to meet with paul, johnny and 2 random girls they know at wonderland :S. I think its going to be just a bit werid since every1 thinks paul is an idiot when me and katie both think johnny is hot lol. Watch it be like a soap opera! haha Mayb it wont be so bad johnny is a funny kid and katie gets along with every1. I just go with the flow. Well I hope this works out since i been just bitchin at paul the last few days cuz he was being stupid lol and i havnt talked to johnny in a while. Jeeez i got to stop thinkin so much...

      Why do people have to be so fuckin anooyin? Ugh paul was complaining about not havin a gf AGAIN! If he really wants one that fuckin bad why doesnt he ask some1 "dont want to be rejected" they get to know some first! If he doesnt meet people or ask anybody out what u think is going to happenn? what is happenin now for him NOTHING!!!! I asked if he wanted me to help him find one this week "no point" How is there no point!! How else u going to meet some1 is u dont get out there! I gave him advice and all he could say was "i know" "lol" "yup" He doesnt deserve a girl if he gets one. He just complains and bitches like a girl on pms i sware! UGHHH There is only so much i can do to help some1 and people dont appreciate me going out of my way to help them. People like that can fuckin die! GRRRR Alrighty well laterz
