      I didn't get to see Ryan Cabrera...... I tried to convince my mom, but she had "plans" to hang out with her sister...even though she made the plans after i had already told her, that i wanted to go to the concert. Oh well, what can i do.... its too late now. Ryan did 3 concerts down here already and i missed all 3 thnx to my mom. NO Ryan .C. NO Ryan .S.  My summer bites the wang......

       Man, i was listening to the radio this morning (that reminds me i just got my KIISFM102.7 ryan shirt) and Ryan was talking about shana(his gf) and he went and called her. he was talking about how he was going to make love to her later, i was getting so grossed out, but what can u do? i wish he was single again! I still cant get over the fact that his show got canceled! its not fair!
