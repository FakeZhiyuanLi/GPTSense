      Well, last night sure was interesting.  I was having yet another mood swing.  I wish life would start stabilizing so I (hopefully) won't have a panic attack or an emotional breakdown every other night.  Sometimes I'm fine.  Other times, every little thing gets to me.  By the end of it all, I just want to cry.  At least it's an improvement.  At least I'm not suicidal anymore.  I have my thoughts from time to time, but I haven't come close to acting on them in almost 6 months.  Maybe I am finally getting better.  That's beside the point.  Anway, I was in a cranky, self-loathing mood again last night.  Moping on the couch, I held my knees against my chest and wished the world would go away.  Then came Dan... he knew I wasn't feeling well and wanted to try to help me out.  He put his arms around me and kept talking to me, making jokes, doing his best to find out why I might be feeling down.  When it came down to it, I was just feeling overwhelmed.  Miscarriages, job changes, random other emotionally draining events...  I was also feeling pressure from my family.  I don't know whether it's me wanting to please them or just trying to please myself.  For some reason, I feel that marriage is what I miss.  I feel happy with my handfasting with Dan, but something inside wishes that we were legally married, instead.  I also want it done right.  I don't want it done out of pity or because I kept pushing.  I know I talk about it frequently, but it's always been something I've wanted for myself.  A marriage that works, a family of my own, and someone who wants to spend forever with me (not with what they want me to be).  After this came out, Dan and I talked a bit more.  Near the end of the conversation, he said that if I lost weight down to what I wanted for myself, he'd propose to me.  Not because he didn't want to marry me until I was thinner, but because he wanted me to be proud of myself for who I was; not for who I was with him.  I smiled.  My whole spirit smiled.  I felt beautiful.  I felt happy.  I felt serene.  I felt lucky to have found such a wonderful man.  So many people don't realize who Dan is inside.  He's a Scorpio, so he's always rather flirtatious and would love to have as many women as he could.  If you move that aside, you see something much more important.  People don't see that when he truly believes in something, there's no stopping him...  ... and he truly believes in me.  ~Lyrlyn~

      Too many people have LJ and others.  I wanted something a bit different.  I used to keep a journal, but kept losing it or forgetting that I even had one.  I think I own 5 or 6 of 'em now.  *sigh*  Anyway, welcome to my Paradigm Shift.  I often forget to use a clutch... so consider yourself warned!  I will post lots of random websites and other odd stuff as the whim strikes me like a baseball bat to a frog.  Let me know what you think!  ~Lyrlyn~
