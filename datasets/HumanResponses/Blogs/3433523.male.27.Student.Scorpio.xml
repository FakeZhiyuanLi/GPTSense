       Deliver Us From Evil!   It is my personal opinion that the war with Iraq was necessary to erase a group of evil from our planet. The muslim extremests demonstrated their power, and lack of value of life on September 11th, and have been doing so ever since (especially when they killed 300 and wounded about 1,400 people in the Madrid bombings).   Iraq was supporting al-Quida terror training camps, and therefore WAS linked to September 11th, and they had plenty of time to redeem thereselves (because shortly after September 11th, Goerge W. Bush, on of the most respectable men in the world, announced that we would hunt down the terrorists responsible, AND THE ONES THAT HARBORED THEM) but Iraq did not. Fortunatly though, a lot of terror supporting countries are cooperating with the U.S. in the war on terror.   As for the WMD's, I belive Iraq had them. (Not anythiing Nuclear though.) The U.S. may never find them though...and what kills me is that all the Americans over here expect our troops to find them, when they could be buried under a mountain, or at the bottom of the Tigris! Iraq probably hid them as soon as we told them that there'd be consequences if SADDAM did not.   PEOPLE, TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR COUNTRY AND SUPPORT OUR TROOPS! Instead of putting down our president and our mission for freedom, peace, democracy, and equality in the Middle East, SUPPORT IT! Do you want Spetember 11th to happen again?   And I am not dumb either. I know we have lost lives in this war...but let me clue you in on something...this is WAR! That's what happens. And when you say we shouldn't be over in Iraq helping the WORLD because we are loosing lives...then what about the 3,000 lives on September 11th? HUH????   WHAT ABOUT THEM!?!?!?!?! WHAT ABOUT THEM!?!?!?!?! WHAT ABOUT THEM!?!?!?!?!     X 1,000  And huh...I am proud to say that...you can't bash Bush not for the economy because, well, it's doing pretty good, and better as time goes on.  Now I know...there are a lot of you who don't agree with me on a lot of things, and to be frank with you people, I will let you know that yes...there are some things I don't agree with President George Bush on. But when you say we shouldn't be over in the Middle East, helping people (women, children, Christians, and good men), getting rid of evil people, and setting up a system of evil,   then I have to question your patriotism, your faith in God, and your value of life and peace and freedom.  And with that I close.
