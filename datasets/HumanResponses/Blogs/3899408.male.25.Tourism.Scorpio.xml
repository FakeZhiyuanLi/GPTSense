      I had an interview today in Waterford, WI at  urlLink Waterford Union High School .&nbsp; Went well.&nbsp; Have to wait until late this week to find out.  Heard bad news from Sheboygan Falls High School.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Guess I gotta keep looking.

      She read coming and going. The  mailbox several feet away, she  found something on second  glance that made her stop.  The woman with osteoporosis back, Darth Vader sun glasses,  pink sweatshirt, and dark (blue  or lightly faded black) sweatpants held the letter--cream colored paper-- opened only part way, a Z  dangling from her hands.  Out of the side window, at highway  speeds, the scene was in clear detail;  she showed the letter to me in her  silent way and I sped away from it.

      I interviewed today at  urlLink Sheboygan Falls High School  for an opening in their English department.&nbsp; I met with Scott Sabol and a few other members of the staff.&nbsp; Very nice little town.&nbsp; I would like to go back whether I get a job there or not.&nbsp; Lots of neat shops to look in and lots of pretty scenery.

      I just finished reading a good book.&nbsp;   urlLink The Wounded Knee Massacre From the Viewpoint of the Sioux   by James H. McGregor explains the events, attitudes, and decisions that lead to the Wounded Knee Massacre.&nbsp; A very good read; the author has a very distinctive voice that works well with the historical narrative.&nbsp; The cover of the book is also a bonus as it has art work done by  urlLink Iron Cloud .&nbsp; Printed by  urlLink Fenske  Printing, Inc. out of Rapid City, SD.&nbsp; The first printing was in 1940.&nbsp; I was reading&nbsp;a twelfth edition, 1997 reprint.&nbsp; This book explains a lot about the circumstances and events that I didn't understand before.

      We have a piece of Paha Ska's artwork.&nbsp; We have been searching for information about him for quite some time.&nbsp; Today I have found several things about him: A  urlLink poem  about him.  A listing about him on the  urlLink Keystone Area Historical Society &nbsp;website.  A picture of  urlLink him  at the Crazy Horse memorial.

      I had a good weekend with Colleen.&nbsp; Sunday morning we went for a walk around town.&nbsp; We&nbsp;lit a candle at the shrine near the Catholic church in town (neither of us is Catholic).&nbsp; Lots of people we are worried about now; it felt like a good thing to do.&nbsp; Though we did find it interesting that the shrine had two boxes with signs that read "deposit $3.00 to light a prayer&nbsp;candle."&nbsp; Faith on the honesty system.&nbsp; We joked that we could pick three people to light it for then.&nbsp; A dollar a person.&nbsp; Actually we figured that this was because Wisconsin Dells is a tourist town; and if there isn't a sign saying that you have to pay the tourists will take advantage of it.&nbsp; In the afternoon we went to my parent's house and visited.&nbsp; I finished setting up my parent's computer.&nbsp; I had to format the hard drive and reinstall windows after it refused to work properly.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Monday I mailed out some job applications and then I applied for a job at Econoprint.&nbsp; Then we went to the  urlLink Wisconsin Opry Craft and Antique Mall .&nbsp; This was alot of fun.&nbsp; I love&nbsp;looking at old stuff.&nbsp; It is fun to figure out what something is that you&nbsp;can't immediately identify.&nbsp; And usually I find out that it was something that was important for everyday life.&nbsp; Interesting how things become unimportant so quickly.&nbsp; I found an old, autographed poetry chapbook.&nbsp; Got it for $0.84.&nbsp; Now it is Tuesday and I am back at  urlLink work .

      In the morning your pain sensitizes me for the day, already a failure before breakfast. &nbsp; We are admired for the pain we deny existence.&nbsp; Believing it doesn't hurt, earns us medals. &nbsp; Push past the wall; play through the pain.&nbsp; Give voice to the  primal; scream the pain away. &nbsp; On the battlefield, on the  playing field, the dead  have more to give. Pick that man up, dust him off, and send him out again. &nbsp; You and I do this everyday; it is an old, old idea that  every step should ache. And it gets older every day. &nbsp; Push past the wall; play through the pain. Give voice to the devil; yell the pain away. &nbsp; Your brain will explode from a lifetime of pain. The flesh will decay as you lay in your grave. &nbsp; The soul is blinded by hurt. But embedded in your stone will be gold-plate medals. &nbsp; Push past the death; play through the pain. Give voice to the hurt; cry the pain away.

      There is something  between us,  the line on the beach  between the saturated  and the merely wet.  &nbsp;  Hot,  let go of your hand,  shirt in the dry sand,  dive in.  &nbsp;  You watch  from the otherside of that  line.  The tops of your toes are  still dry.  &nbsp;  Out of the water,  sand between my toes  I find you guarding that line.  &nbsp;  I hold you, I dry myself  on you.  And I laugh at you,  just merely wet.&nbsp;

      The lives of others,  a black, deep, sooty  mine.&nbsp; And as mine  &nbsp;  I take the pretty,  shiny things.&nbsp; On my  shelf they look good.  &nbsp;  In my safe, there  under that floorboard,  are the lumps of coal,  &nbsp;  deep black, sooty and  from the mines.&nbsp; Infinity  in the crevases and eternity  &nbsp;  in the layers and shades  of black, dark, ugly, soot  balls.&nbsp; The whole world  &nbsp;  in a piece of coal.&nbsp;

      Gouge the lines of a ledger book  across my back and balance out my  life in the red of ink before the  red of blood makes a tinted gesso  on your canvas.  &nbsp;  I can tell you the sum and total  before you go through the effort;  if you would get to the heart and soul  of me, there would be no reason to  emphasize my zeros.  &nbsp;  Another receipt -- my blame shifting  adds one more to the negative column.  I am a zero in the absolute sense; you  can't&nbsp;take anything away from me.  There is nothing left to give.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      About two weeks ago, driving to my parent's house, I came upon two adult sand hill cranes and their two little ones.  I had to stop and watch them.  Only about five inches tall and fuzzy, the gray little cranes already had two very different personalities.  One stuck right next to the parents and ran across the road with them.  The other one was more cautious and stayed on the opposite side, waiting for me to pass by.    The parents squawked and called for the little one on the other side of the street.  After sitting there for a few moments, it became clear that this little crane was stubborn in its fear and would not move on while my vehicle was sitting where it was.  I pulled ahead, just over the rise of the hill so I could look back and see.  Two more minutes of frantic calls from the parents and the stranded chick finally ran across the road.  Today I went past that point today and I could see the parent cranes out in the field.  Only one chick was with them.  It was about a foot tall now.  Still fuzzy but now much less gray.  The missing chick was no surprise.  Cranes have two chicks just for that reason.  But I do wonder which one survived.  Is it the cautious one or the one who was daring and crossed the road right away who is still alive?  Was one of them Cain and one of them Abel?  That happens too in cranes.   urlLink International Crane Foundation

       urlLink    Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. O, Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. &nbsp; urlLink

       Pataphysics , a French absurdist concept, is the idea of a philosophy or science dedicated to studying what lies beyond the realm of metaphysics.  It is a parody of the theory and methods of modern science and is often expressed in nonsensical language. A practitioner of pataphysics is a pataphysician. from http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/pataphysics

       urlLink      urlLink    On the way to  urlLink Colby High School  for another interview, Colleen and I were passed by the Bush-Cheney 2004 caravan.  They were on I90-94 possibly traveling to La Crosse, WI or maybe Minnesota.  You can see one of their red, white, and blue buses in this picture (center).  There were two buses and a police escort in front of them.  Yes it is a pretty bad picture but it was the best I could get as they were speeding past us at about 80-85 mph (15-20 over).  Gotta love people who are above the law.

      Another interview today; this time at the  urlLink high school  in Random Lake.  The interview went very well.  The principal said he should be getting back to me as soon as tomorrow or Friday.  I hate the waiting game.

I have more pictures on my  urlLink photos page .  Great day but now I am exhausted and feeling a little sunburn on my face.  Oh well, it was a nice day away.

      When the beats of your words and the chirps of bird song are synchronized or syncopated I see your wings -- long, sleek; each feather perfect like the raptors.  In that instant I can understand chickadean, bluejayish, or blackbirdese. Melody becomes dialogue. They know the words to the cannon of human song and they sing them all at once; a cacophony of experience in a few notes, sung plainly.

      The snow, now in puddles, reveals the human waste that was intermingled with that most white of natural phenomenon.  Beer bottles, soda cans, and blue plastic bags adorn the bodies of a winter’s worth of road kill. Our glittering offerings to a mass grave.

      Wow! It has been over a week since I entered anything here. So a quick week in review.  Wednesday  I was supposed to interview in Spring Valley at the middle/high school. I cancelled the interview, for many reasons. Too far away, little opportunity for my wife in the area, etc. The biggest reason is that something was fishy about the place. They lied about names of contact people and times for the interview. Not a good way to start.  Thursday  I went to Madison Area Technical College (MATC) in Reedsburg to apply for a teaching job.  Just one class a week but it would be in the education field. Work, work, work.  Friday  Work, work, work.  Saturday  This was our first Saturday off in quite some time so Colleen and I went to the Princeton flea market. We bought a Carter family CD, the movie Mystic River, some ceramic beads supposedly made in Africa, beef sticks, and some veggies. Then we did our weekly grocery shopping. A very nice day out.  Sunday  Drove out to my parents to drop off a birthday present for my brother. Had a quiet afternoon at home. Started rearranging our apartment. Sometimes you just need a change.  Monday  Waterford called; no good news.  However, I got a call from MATC about the job I applied for. Sounds like a done deal but I have to talk with the dean on Thursday to finalize the plans. Work, work, work.  Tuesday  I finished rearranging our apartment. Work, work, work.
