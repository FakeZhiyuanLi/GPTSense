       Spent the whole day on a T-shirt decal design for a friend. I'll post it when it's done as long as Tony promises not to right click and save the image. He keeps a file on almost everything I've drawn, it's disturbing really. If I ever disappear unexpectedly send the cops to Tony's and Jase to my house to clear out my porn.  Other news, site revamp going slowly I've almost finished doing the new click buttons.

       Slowly getting things done for site upgrade. Completely fumbled the ball with rod mantroll. Still going to do it though, just not going live with it on NYE. Currently retreated into the small chunk theory to get stuff done.  Still need job that pays good money. Yep, that's pretty high on the agenda.

       Haven't posted for few days because the phonline is screwed. It was so hot on Christmas Day that the cat actually drank from my sister's glass. Reaching and scooping up water with it's paw. The car needs it's steering balanced.  Saw Elf yesterday it was a very enjoyable film, something that kids and adults can like, unlike the horrible mess that was Looney Tunes Back in Action... erk.

       Ah, Christmas Day and I'm thinking, "Where's that new sexy site I promised the guys?" well it's so freaking hot to day that I could not lift a finger and prefered to sit in front of the telly. I'm so damn behind on Rod Mantroll.

       OH! crap..sorry - as I sit here with Stuie (he says 'Hi'...sorry, 'Hello' - hope you're happy damn Reid)...I will correct myself...*AHEM-HEM*...  Foolproof Comics after appearing in multiple newspaper articles & completely selling out of issues at Supanova 2003 + Kings Comics & Phantom Zone are forging ahead with projects guaranteed to amaze & astound - adventures in audio, issues, hands-on games, south american flavoured Pablo-testicles, greased dwarves, inflatible moose-heads with droopy antlers, a half dozen camels, gold frankensence (no mhyr), and an old chestnut...waaiit a sec...quit that Stu! 2004 will see Foolproof Comics reign supreme across the globe with books, an animated series (see back of issue #1), movie & many product/ merchandising deals!  Or comics - we'll see what our 'tight' schedule can include :)

Again, news as it breaks there. Hope its OK i mention him.

       HEY HO FOLKS! Tony Newton/ Chooky here, finially! Since Nate created the Foolproof BLOG my PC/ modem have completely died in the arse! So with no way till NOW to log on - I have missed out on a few things...but now here I am! The 3rd & final founder of Foolproof Comics - comin atcha loud & clear...or something. Also seeing as I have limited access to the net, will try & add heaps when i can, but there could well be large chunks of the BLOG without any updates from me, so heres heaps to start with:  Now, firstly thanks to Nate for scanning my piccys...so 2 were in drag, they are off to a media type firm so hell, might as well - who cares what i looked like for a day. If i scam a single job outta it all - it will have been worth it...(WASTED 30 mins of your life scanning pics of me? wow, ta so very much)  Secondly looking forward to the new site (hopefully it wont be too long before i can get my PC back up & running, hopefully to help out) - dont do games if its gunna be a difficult & lengthy process, but wallpapers are not so bad. They might not be anywhere as good as Nates but I have heaps on my site i'm quite proud of.   Thirdly the next issue 'Monkey Buisness'...if all that is really wrong is a few panels to the end, edit em. I think I have done pretty well what with my odd current anti-technology sphere active blowing almost all aspects of my PC to buggery. I look forward to seeing the whole thing done.  Yes I can log on to the blog, i only asked for the re-invite once over a week ago, used 1 of 9 to get here & the only reason i mentioned my '2 days of net access left' was it was true, if i didnt get it now I wouldnt have been able to log on at all for ages. So yes, rage-boy, i still wanna join da BLOG.  Fruit Loops? I agree with Nathan on this one - bleagh! try coco-pops next time...I have a recipe to use em in a smoothy - just like a chocolate milkshake...only...well it is. PS Jay-man, thanks for being surrogate printing man while I am currently unable to deplete other firms printing resources.  NOW with all my replys done - news for Foolproof. Turkey Squad still to be done up, will try & scan @ a KINKOS & burn to CD to do at home. For those that don't know - Turkey Squad is the cartoon our character (& mascot - i think...Nate - confirm or deny) Fool watches. 1st episode drawn by yours truly coming soonish!  Also am working on the script for the SuburbanKnights Radio Play - An Adventure In Music (hopefully to come to fruition in Feb 04 on FBi radio - 94.5FM), so news as it breaks there.  WHEW! dats all for me for a while - e-chat later - TONY

        This is a Public Service Announcement:  Eating almost an entire box of Froot Loops in one night will wreak havok with your guts. Backing up to finish the box off the next night won't help, either. Going in tonight to (hopefully) book my trip to Mexico.

       Man it's warm and I can't sleep. I should be looking at job websites but... eh.  Some unbalanced fool is waging a war of words over at Ozcomics touting that Nukes prevent wars. I'm not wading into that debate I don't have the historical knowledge to even contribute.   I've written 3 pages of plot to Rod Mantroll: Happy New Year. I hope this idea pans out. Should I announce this project now or wait till I have more material under my belt? I'll wait.  It's been 6 year since I held a full time job down. I miss regular income.

       I'm a rage-aholic, that's right I'm addicted to rage-ahol.   I was fairly harsh with my attitude towards Tony only because he was bugging for the details to join the blog but the one that said "... I only have two days of net access left...", that was the one that did it. Now that was my problem and there was no need for what I said in the reply SMS. I admit I'm a hot head and that little things can set of a rant (God what am I going to be like in my 80's?) and I do have tendacy to treat close friends shabbily... what I'm saying is that I'm sorry and I hope Tony still registers for the blog.  However, if there are no invites in your inbox this time it's your email settings.

       I know I registered for the Ozcomics Forum back in the days of sporadic and not-very-good internet usage. I'll have to either re-register of find my details. And anyone who's seen my place will attest to the fact that there's very VERY little chance of that.  I wouldn't mind the chance to play on the field of the supergeek once in a while.  Personally, I think Disney IS an STD. Sentimentally Transmitted Dross. Bring on the mouse - I'll kick his arse.

       Speaking of Tony his googlinesses is he ever gonna join us on the blog?   A while back I did a DVD cover for a local comedy show that got the axe because of it's content. Well it's back and believe it or not - because I'm surprised - it's performing at the Parramatta Riverside Theatre!   Details are at:   http://www.thebignightout.com.au   Along with the spanky illustration I did on the enterance page.  Holidays? I just want full time employment.

       I didn't know it was an either/or situation. I thought you might kill Tony  then  do it your way, anyway. There's no "I" in team, but you can rearrange it to spell "meat". 4 more days of work, then a blissful month of holidays. Work is really gearing down. There are hours of boredom punctuated by periods of mass panic.

       One of two things might happen 1) I kill Tony or 2) Disregard it and do it my way. There may be no "me" in "team" but there's an "e" and ahh... stuff it. I'll be witty on someone elses time.

       My printer must hate me. I'm using all it's precious fluids to print out pages of other peoples websites.   The magazine told me to.   It said if I was going to revamp/ overhaul my site I have to look at other sites even if they're not related to what I'm doing on my site.   I'm trying to get back to Foolproof's original MO - comics. But no I had to go and suggest things like wallpapers and games. Tony and Jase liked it. Stupid brain I hate you! On the plus side I've decided to try and do another 24 hr comic for NYE. I know that New Years will be the same ol' sluggish thing for me. So I might as well do something constructive.

       So angry!! Well not angry disgruntled. Just got an email back from a job I applied for, the job was pretty much reproduction using Corel and Illustrator, something I can do standing on my head. The response was so brief I have to assume the guy must've just glanced at and made the assumption that animation isn't detail work. Sure I can slap together an illustration in 3 hours but the preperation is where all the detail work is!   How, HOW can I not be worthy of being employed as a reproduction artist??  Listen up people! I CAN DO ANYTHING!

       Could have been worse, you could have had "Shake yer Ass" stuck in your head. Try looking your mum in the face after you've accidentally blurted that out in the kitchen. Not a bad movie - not Nick Hornby's best book in my humble opinion, but it is quite cool. The biggest difference, not to give too much away, is the complete absence of Kurt Cobain references. Ellie's a much bigger part of the book, also. Just finished David Morrell's "The Protector". Not as good as "The Fifth Profession". Now I'll be haunting the bookshops again on Thursday night.

       Tuesday was pretty quiet, forgot to do the "good cop/ bad cop" thing in the script but we (Tony & I) did tack on an epilogue to the Monkey Business story.   My sisters hired "About A boy" on Saturday and I can't get "Killing Me Softly" out of my head. However, I'll have to buy the book to see how much the film differs from the film. I doubt the changes are as big as the changes in "High Fidelity".

       The best mini spring rolls in the world can be found at Macau Chinese restaurant in St. Clair. They are also the only worthwhile things to be found in St. Clair. I'll be missing my first ever Foolproof meeting this week, because I have the memory of a rather dull goldfish and forgot that my family is getting together on Tuesday night. More pizza for you guys, and I give you permission to put crap on me for 15 minutes. On the bright side, this gives me some time at Mum & Dad's computer to do some more stuff.

       The cat is now sleeping on the bed. Borrowed my sister's digital camera to photograph some of my illustrations. Why doesn't it have an "in game" tutorial like PS2 or Gamecube?  Watched a really aweful dub of a Japanese movie called the, "Returner" I wish the DVD had been available. "Equilibrium" wasn't too bad, once you get past the first five minutes. Heavily influenced by Orwell and Nazi Germany. I give it an, "Eh."

       Hi all welcome to the first post in the Foolproof Comics bloc.

Ah yes the blog a mysterious thing passed down through the ages... Actually this is a flimsy attempt in regular content for the site.   I'm so lazy...  Nathan

       I just saw some bastard run a dog over and not stop to check on the animals condition. I stopped the car a man who lived on the street came out and carried the injured animal to the footpath. His wife called the local council to get a ranger out to pick up the animal. The little guy had a collar and the man and his family said that someone owned the dog. Earlier today on the way to work with my Dad I spotted a large dog that had been hit and died. I hope that there isn't some asshole who's deliberately running dogs down.  On a lighter note I caught up with old friends and realised that maybe I'd out grown them. I was pretty much out of the loop and their "foreign language" (it consists of quoting lines from movies like Snatch or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) made feel as if I was from another planet and hanging with a couple.

       It was a rather schmaltzy painting of one of my cats. It was sold to a private buyer. Wait for the next Dell special Jase, buy a computer at a big chain store and it's already six months old, you want something with a spring in it's step - so to speak.

       Just like Nate to get so excited about his Transformer that he forgets to mention what the work he sold was and to whom he sold it. See there? I just used "whom" in it's proper context. The search for a computer continues. Dick Smith has some good ones on sale at the moment, but I really need a flat screen. My place is so small that, if I had too deep a monitor, I'd have to sit on the balcony to use the computer.

       Saw "Underworld" on Monday an okay film that blatantly sets itself up for a sequel.  So much tight fitting vinyl and there's only 3 colours in that film: black, white and blue. Also it's really low on the gore for a vamp/ werewolf film.

       That's not an argument I'd wade into, even if I were drunk. Censorship makes me want to punch people. At Pablo's reccommendation, I saw "Equilibrium" last night. It makes me wish Batman carried guns. Got my flight information for my Mexico trip today. In a miracle of the time/space continuum, I arrive at LA airport 3 hours  before  I leave Sydney.

       I went to Dubbo and Tony went to Tamworth. Now it's time for Nate to visit a crappy country town. Parkes? Gulgong? Dunnedoo? Any suggestions? My deposit for Mexico has been paid. The search for an affordable computer continues. I haven't felt like writing in a while and I think it's because I'm supposed to have my computer by now.

       There's an interesting thread on porno comics at the  urlLink ozcomics messageboards  at the moment. It started off with the usual jocular approach to this subject, it started get interesting when the topic was being debated in depth. It's sort of evolved into a pissing contest over, "what is art?" all because some guy aired his opinion on a few creators.  The catalyst for this argument may or may not be right in his opinion but he's being ganged up on by two writers. It's a joke. So the guy doesn't like "writer X", big fucking deal. He has every right to say it and you have every right to say otherwise, but ganging up come on! In an open forum are we not allowed to ask questions? Push boundaries? Because that's what art is all about! Now I don't share the catalyst's point of view but I'm not going to hassle the shit out of the guy for saying whats on his mind.   May I also point out that the catalyst may change his opinion somewhere down the line. Or are we going to attack him then and remind him of his previous comments?  I realise I should be saying this on the forums but I think I'll shouted down.

       Interesting weekend to say the least. Anyway did a new desktop for the "stuff" section of the foolproof website. I haven't loaded it yet but when I do I'll announce it here. Who reads this Blog anyway?  Found another job I want to apply for. The ad read like it was for a cult or something. interesting anyway.

       OK, I'm back. Back at work 2 hours and already avoiding it.  Dubbo stinks. And people with necks like mine and Nate's should never wear ties. As Billy Connolly said, "It makes me look like a head transplant patient." Christmas sucked, the less said, the better. Has anybody else noticed that "Return of the King" would have been an hour shorter if everyone refrained from giving a speach before they made the slightest move?

       The interview on Monday was well a mess on my part I was so nervous that I sweated  profusely  a first for me. The art in my portfolio was not what was requested however, the interviewer was kind enough to give me a 2nd chance. So for the last 2 days I've been putting together new stuff.   The next interview I have I'm not wearing a tie.

       In so much trouble. I've forgotten how to draw the SuburbanKnights. I stopped drawing them 1/2 way through last year because I was getting sick of them. It has a kind of knock on effect because when I get my mojo back (and I will) they'll be tweaked  slightly.

       Bought the Sideswipe/ Dodge Viper Alternator at the collectors fair it was cheaper than the Subaru WRC from Kmart, so it was a bitter sweet bargin. Tim's BBQ was a hoot. Pablo got over his inital shy-ness (odd because it's Pablo) and got into the groove showing people his work.  Note to Pablo:  Don't  roll into the back of any car I'm driving as a joke again. I'm big man and I'm not adverse to cannibalism to hide a murder.

       Nate: So noted, thanks. Not much chance of it happening, but with my luck...  Anyway, I went to the Central Coast on the weekend, and all that it implies. Anyone who knows me knows I'm not Beach Guy, but after spending some time there, I have to say...I just DON'T GET IT.  The sand is too hot, the water is too cold and there are too many fat ugly people showing too much skin. Before you go, you have to smear on a foul-smelling goop, and if you miss any parts (because who can reach every part of their own body?) you wind up with bits of skin that resemble a strawberries-and-cream chuppa chup. Then the wind comes up, kicks up the sand and now you look like a cinnamon doughnut. And the sea is full of smelly weed and Things That Want To Hurt You. The whole thing is nuts.

       Speaking of being screwed over by your employer... (we weren't? Oh.) Found out this morning (1 week before my trip has to be paid off) that I will in fact be recieving NO money for my long service, and must, instead, take the time off. This, of course, leaves me almost $3000 short for my final payment. Certainly worth working here for 10 years wasn't it? So...after I take a month off to go overseas, guess what I'll be doing during the other month? I'll give you a clue...It's initials are: Finding A New Fucking Job.

       I was just reading Neil Gaiman's Blog at neilgaiman.com and he mentioned a sequel to  American Gods , which is the greatest modern novel there is. I honestly haven't anticipated a book so much. Still, I think it's two books away for him. His next is apparently   Anansi Boys   which uses a chracter from  Gods . Then another collection of short stories which will hopefully include   Monarch of  the Glen  , a story featuring Shadow.

       "The Last Boyscout" was on TV last night and it got me to thinking... Which Bruce Willis character would win in a fight? Would whathisname from "Unbreakable" be able to withstand the wiliness and skill of John Maclean ("Die Hard")? Would all the guys he played in "North" (inclusing the Easter Bunny) gang up and beat Corbin from "Fith Element"?  Personally, my money's on the guy from "Last Man Standing". He kicked butt.

The motel pool was by far the best part - ahhhh, it was OK. Since then...organising the surprise SK audio adventure which ....wait...sorry, no REAL news to go here... forgot.

Hands off Corporate Nazis! I think we all knew our Federal Govt was going to roll over like a little puppy and allow itself to get thoroughly reamed by the American Govt's herpes encrusted penis.  Yes I know... I said penis.  Speaking of rolling over, I went and bought Double Dash...

       The Black Beastie Writing Box is up and running, sitting pretty on a budget desk from K-Mart (which, frankly, took me longer to put together than the computer). And already my Game Cube is feeling neglected. Last night I awoke to a faint electronic voice from the lounge room singing "What About Me?". Cube needs a talking to. I almost watched Final Destination 2 last night. That is to say, I rented it and then read comics the whole time it was on. It got me to thinking about the premise of the first one. Does anybody really think that Death is so impatient and petty that if he misses you with a plane crash one day, he gets you with a Rube Goldberg device the next? Death is eternal! If you don't die in the crash, he just shrugs and sticks his bony finger up your butt. 10 years later, you die of prostate cancer.

Also I have discovered a perfect spot in the lounge room which will not only be a nice little place for a computer desk, but will stop Tony hitting his head on my kitchen counter every time he comes over. Which is probably a good thing. Probably.

       I'm a little tired of how cool it seems to get on the "I hate Americans" bandwagon. I'm especially tired of people's reasons. 1) Their President is an idiot. This is true, but a majority of Americans      did not   vote for him. 2) They started a war with no good reason. Actually the abovementioned idiot did that, with very little support from his citizens. Support for the war only went up after it started because people wanted to support the troops. 3) They invented reality TV. Nope, that was the Dutch. America just stole the ides. Then WE stole it from them. There are more, but time and space don't allow me to continue. If you want to go on hating Americans, that's fine. Just don't let me catch you singing along with an American song, or watching thier shows, or reading their books etc. I'm not waving the American flag, or trying to be an arse kisser. I just know that racism still counts when your target is white.

       "The Returner" is much better subbed, the psycho bad guy sounds, "badder" than his American voice over, who just comes off  as a weenie who likes pregnant pauses.

       What does "despatched locally" mean? Dell says my computer has been despatched locally. It can't be too local, or it would be here by now. If I had any patience to begin with, I'd have run out by now. And yes, "Batman" will rock. Harder than two rocks in a rocking contest, I dare say.  I started watching "The Returner" last night, before Double Dash lured me away. Not a bad movie but a veeery bad script (the English version, anyway). So far my favourite line is "Wait a minute...Is that a spaceship in disguise?" If that guy hadn't stood around wondering about it, he might still be alive.

Wait, I'm sorry. My rant is not yet over. Who's  fucking ridiculous  idea was it to mention ANY of these people during a meeting about a Superman movie?!? I mean...I've heard of some stupid shit but...Johnny Depp as Lex Luthor? What the hell? Then I read somewhere on the 'net that they don't need to do a new Superman movie because we already have 'Smallville'. Well, newsflash dickhead, 'Smallville' sucks. Lex was not bald in high school and he did NOT live in Smallville. Anyone who doesn't know that oughta keep his mouth shut on issues regarding Superman.

It's been a week since I placed my order and, so far, all they can tell me is that I've placed an order - and paid for it. This much I knew guys, thanks. I have a chair so far, but no desk. I'm considering just turning over the box it came in. It's a new interior design school I'm calling 'Hobo chic".

       Yaay! Finally on! I had to pick PabloZ because some ***JERK*** (Yes, I'm talikng to you jerkface) is called Pablo (if you are reading this - HATE YOU AND I HOPE YOU DIE!). So it was a choice between PabloZ, PabloballZ and Zublander....I think I made the right choice. In other news I got a transformer for X-mas (I'm calling it X-mas because some asshole probably took that name too - ARE YOU HAPPY ASSHOLE!?!?!). Anyway it was the first transformer I got in something like 15 years. I got the WRX guy. He's cool. In response to the previous line of chatter; Nate: Picture magazine is a fine fine publication with many articulate and intelligent individuals woking had to bring out the weekly issue. That and it has boobies. I like boobies.

       Ha ha ha what makes you think that will happen Jason?  Meanwhile...  That job I didn't get is advertising for the exact same job, exact same position.  It's insane! Hire me you doofuses!I can do the freaking job.  I actually put that in an email this morning. No wonder I've heard nothing.   The crusade continues!

       Congrats Jase! My quest for employment continues. I've emailed editors about freelance work, they're happy enough to see the stuff but I'm usually not working in a style that seems applicable to the content of their magazines. At this rate I'll be doing illustrations for Picture magazine.   I will forge on!

       OK. I just bought my Dell online. Well done, me. The last question on the order form is - and I'm serious here - "Will the product(s) be used in conjunction with weapons of mass destruction, eg: nuclear weapons, chemical or biological weapons etc.?" What unmitigated dickhead of a terrorist is going to click "Yes"?  I pity the goofball who thinks it's funny to answer that one with "Yes" just to be a smart arse.

       Jase I didn't even get the idea part just the, "I got the idea from..."  No sausage sizzle at Parra hmm. They did in Guildford and I only had to wait for 5 minutes before voting :-p

       Tony was having one of his can't-differentiate-between-an- idea -and-a- good idea  moments. I'll let him explain, because frankly I'm trying to forget it.  OK - Haven't blogged in a couple of days (but the doctor gave me some....oh never mind, I couldn't be bothered with that joke).  I had a whole rant devised about the distinct lack of sausage sizzles at voting venues this year, before we were interrupted by "the unpleasantness". Suffice it to say that after walking from my place to Rose Hill, waiting in line for 20 minutes to be told to go elsewhere, then walking to and standing in line for  over an hour  at Parramatta Town Hall, I could really have used a sausage. Just a little meat-byproduct in an intestinal casing, burnt on a dirty grille, and slapped on some bread to raise money for the kids. Too hard people?   Everyone's remembered Fletch's little shindig on Sunday right? There'll be sausages there, won't there?

       Oh, PS - I have no idea how it all started, but the Con-thing seems rather over-the-top. I agree with Jason & we Foolproofers back our Nathan on this one...at least thats what i gather from the posts & emails.   Enuff said already - lets get back to ludicrous posts about Transformers, Nintendos (by the way, I'd just like to add here it was rather quaint to watch Natey get all flustered about his N64 game 'Conkers Bad Fur Day' when the rest of us agreed it was rather amusing, but the cut scenes really sucked - the poms should stick to Python. Ahhhh) & inflatable moose-head merchandise & SK movies & taking over the woild...which I am sure we will do at some point.  Oh - I am out of the Nintendo discussions the other 3 have as all I's got is my handy-dandy PS1. Can't wait for PS3 (I will just by-pass PS2) & the PSPortable later this year. WOO!

       OK - Hi all, sorry for the delay in posting - I just dont get much e-time these days. Now, on to a few things -The SK Radio Play is steaming along nicely with confirmed air-time being 8pm-9pm Sunday April 25th - looking forward to it immensely! Have also worked out a nifty pic of the lads in circular CD-like fashion & will chuck an image on after Nathan shows me how.   I look forward to seeing our next ish as the 8 pages I have seen WAY ROCKED & Nate is a bit of a legend there. Pabs - bring on our Noisy Minor & GRU Crew piccys! Jay...er...you have a nice new PC :)   And finially - Nathan old chum...do you want the current images of the pants'less bunny (a concept short cartoon of a comic our character Fool may well read - Rabbit Vs Chicken) or the newer version I am working on with MUCH better/ simpler backgrounds? Am also doing new Turkey Squad backgrounds (that is the cartoon Fool watches) so will get em done as soon as i can. Do you want ruff bios on Turkey Squad & RvC with pics for the site?  Well that's all from Yours Truly the Chook-meister, will e-chat again later my Foolproof folks! :)

        entry: Haven't got a sense of humor, have you? This coming from a guy who's supposed to  be doing funny books. You've got some nerve calling me and my comic hack, when you obviously couldnt do any better. I've seen your comic, I've bought some crap in  my time and your book was one of them. I dont even see any memorable characters in your Suburban knights comic.Nothing that will get to the legendary status of the Simpsons or Bugs Bunny. And is that all you can come up with, just S.K? Let's see if you can come up with more comedy characters plus serious superheroes as well! So I'd be very careful if I was you, since you dont know me and haven't seen the rest of my drawings and creations! One more thing. You say I ape other artists, when you are doing the same thing with saturday morning cartoons.You can e-mail me back, or we can have a fist to face chat outside Phantom Zone (Parramatta).   Con it is now public record that you have threatened my person.   Your a tool and I'm just going to ignore you.

        "And there's that ridiculous "Fab 5" thread started by some hack who has the audacity to "use" my name ("nicky sohappy", did you spend a day on coming up with that?) amongst other australian comic guys for "quotes" in his comic. Not only is that thread the most useless thing, Alex - "Apple Head" has decided to out me as being gay. Which is a problem seeing as I'm not gay."   The guy I called a hack has his panties in a twist over this comment. I originally retracted the comment but now I'm reinstating it. Why? Because I said it and it's already out there and maybe it was a bit of an overreaction but the guy parodied my surname - something I really hate - and used this "sohappy" and other Aussie comic guys to "endorse" his comic.  Perhaps if he had asked and sent me a few sample pages I might have endorsed it. He didn't and he pissed me off.

       Here's an email from my brother Matt to our hotmail address. He's got a table at the con with some of his friends (they'll let  anyone  have a table) - they've got some very wacky things going on...  entry: I hope you guys don't mind fan mail from people you know, I guess you could take it as either encouraging or disheartening, but I know if it wasn't for Kylie, the Rock and Roll Ninja Aquarius e-mail account would be empty but for messages from my lecturers and stuff about mortgage rates. I figure, your comic costs two bucks, our comic costs two bucks, so we should just swap copies at the con, if that doesn't sound like too much of a... con. Badoom-cha. Well, I'll let you get back to work, I've got two pages to got, but I'm lowering my standards so fast that if I wait another week I'll be able to just get mum to do them. Ciao. p.s. Did you hear its going to be a Tolkien/Kung-Fu overrun event this year? I don't see too many people buying David Carradine autobiographies AND badly drawn comics about overweight manic-depressive radioactive ninjas. We might do a limited run of 3 copies this month, so we can keep telling ourselves that we could have done so much more. Okay, I better skidaddle. Matt.

       There's a brothel between my place and Parramatta shops. They've been doing renovations for the past month or so. As I was walking past last night, I saw a sign on the door, which was closed.

       "Nate's not gay. C'mon, have you seen the way he dresses? ;)"  Good point Jase, I'm a slob!   Almost finished the backgrounds in the first 8 pages. Will pencil the next 8 soon, so it looks like the comic will be ready mid-April!  Out of frame: The Villagers go: "Yay!"

       Wow. If you don't read the Blog for a few days all sorts of things happen! Nate's not gay. C'mon, have you  seen  the way he dresses? ;) Fantastic backgrounds there, though.  Saw  Once Upon a Time in Mexico  on the weekend. Not too shabby, even if it does have Enrique Iglesias in it. And I bought  1001 Movies You Should See Before You Die  (because heaven has no DVD stores). Not a bad reference tool, but it is missing some obvious inclusions:  Superman ,  Baraka ,  Shrek ,  The Truman Show  and  Dark City  among them, in my opinion. And  Meet the Parents   made  the list? Do you really  need  to see that?  Titanic ? You don't need to see that before you die, it's on a continuous loop in Hell.

       Well, the skin on my legs had grown back, so it was time to head back up the coast. But this time the Sun Gods were on my side and it was too gloomy to go to Mother Nuture's sandbox (except at night - which was cool, 'cause I got to do dangerous jumping-on-rocks-in-the-dark kinda things). And so, armed with my Sherlock Holmes book and the latest   Incredible Hulk   trade, I had a most relaxing weekend.  If Shadowbolt was on Futurama, he'd be Dr. Zoidberg.

       Created the SuburbanKnights: Monkey Business dummy book (re: mock-up) today. It clocks in at 16 pages and I'm mostly faithful to the script. I've only made one big change.   The scene in the, "Rusty Steed" I've made it so  Shadow Bolt  makes the evil monkey hijinks instead of Fool.   Poor Shadow Bolt he doesn't get enough screen time.   Note: Mock-up does not mean I've drawn the book yet!

       If so, that would make him the Bizzaro Reverse Flash, making him the 'Reverse-Reverse Flash', the two reverses completing a 360degree turn and therefore bringing us back to the original, which means you hung up on the Flash!

I say we go with the plan shorter stories more out put and less of the telling each other what to do and treating each others contribution casually.

'He was bludgeoned to death with a blunt excrement' - Sherlock Holmes - WITHOUT A CLUE... 'what do you see when you look at the stars Watson? - stars, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, or the fact our f**king tent has been stolen?' - Sherlock Holmes gag.

       I started reading the Wordsworth Classics reprints of the old Sherlock Holmes stories last night. Man, the type is   tiny  . There are 2 columns to the page, and the page is not that big. I'm not a quick reader (compulsively editing as I go doesn't help), but I was reading for maybe 2 hours and got friggin' nowhere! Still, I'm a big fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's work (note for bookstore owners - that comes under 'C' not 'D', I had trouble finding them). Holmes and Watson met the same way Tony and I did. They both needed a flat-mate, and were introduced by a mutual friend.

Well Nate is stressing & behind his own 8-ball to get the comic done on time for the con this year...again, bless his heart :) Cover is done & away to Pablo for colour printing & the 16-pages are done, just require completion, printing & a trip to Jay's woik-place to copy lots of. The foldies are at a snag point after nate cant get em done & as you read below, the words are missing - so i am off home to do em by hand & with any luck, Sandra (my lovely fiance) can copy em at her work tomorrow!  I look forward to the con & all that 2004 will bring to the continuing glory that IS Foolproof Comics!  PS - I was given details a little while ago of a joint FBi Radio/ Sydney Opera House submission/ comp/ thingy for radio plays to be done LIVE at the Opera House in Sept & we are shortlisted for inclusion with 'SK:An Adventure In Music'! News as it breaks folks!

       Well, it's coming down to crunch time for Supanova and everything that can go wrong is rearing its ugly head. The good photocopier in my office isn't working. Tony's gonna be stuck in Doonside, and if Pablo doesn't get some...er...relief, well, let's just say  I  don't want to sit next to him at the con. I goofed the transfer of the foldie word files, so they're gonna have to wait until tomorrow.

       Maybe, but I have a lovely backyard. Anyway...Y'know what's fun? Dialoguing/lettering a comic without a script. Especially when, for some reason, my computer kept booting me out of Correll. 7 of 16 pages finished, but without a script, the rest could degenerate into madness. The bad kind of madness, not the kind we usually do. Plus, I've finally written my little "Community Service Announcement" as well.

       Tony! Don't play down the radio event. Yeah the new version is a lot better.   Ugh... Today was one of those days where I would like to bundle my family into a car and push them off a cliff.  Anyway check out the cover sketch to Monkey Business.     I'll have to draw the guys behind smaller or from a worms eye view.

       Well folks...it's nearly time! Here I sit in FBI Studios ready to air the FINAL ammended SK Radio Play - 2 songs edited down, extra fx added, all seems to be a-goer! I will also be on air giving background guff & a plug for our gear at Supanova next weekend - so i will also bag a copy of that too. So, without further ado, i am off to make (hopefully) recording history! Wish me luck folks, & remember - this is my 1st time at this so if it's a bit rusty/ odd - i promise to do better next time...providing there IS a next time. I hope so, its been fun. Ciao y'all.

       Went to the city yesterday to sell copies of Belly Flop to Kings Comics, valuable lesson learned: The guy who buys the local comics for Kings is instore  during   the week. Will have to go back Monday.  I forgot to change trains and headed out to Hornsby and had to get off at Concord (nice area, quiet.) and go back to Strathfield. While waiting for the right train I decided to draw a new character I came up with, Tabby Coltrain. His surname is from Robby Coltraine  ( Cracker and From Hell)   because the character is quite big.   Anyway, a kid and his mother sat down next to me and the kid was wrapped with the Coltraine image, so I quickly drew him  a sketch and gave it to him because my train had arrived.

        'V' is not for victory  The saga of the friggin' white t-shirts continues. Tony bought some v-neck shirts for us to put designs on for the con. One each for the 4 of us. I don't know who he was thinking of, but I haven't worn a v-neck since I was 5. And Pablo can't wear one - he looks like he's smuggling chia pets. So, I took the shirts back to Lowes (with no receipt). I went to Lowes because Tony brought a Lowes $5 voucher with him and I assumed that he got it when he bought the shirts.   The shirts - I learned later - came from K-Mart. So the Lowes people were looking at me as though I were wearing a poodle on my head.  Off to K-Mart I go.

Anyhoo - dont fergit folks - the SK radio play airs Sunday 25th April 2004 at 8pm - 9pm on FBi Radio - 94.5fm. Should be cool on Anzac Day (thanks Sandra for that) Just heard a discussion Jay from Ad + my Star Wars mate Craig Bullock re: i-pods - apparently they are like raw meat to vultures for muggers because of the hugely obvious white headphones - so if you get one...colour in the damn 'phones & be careful!  Oh - by the way Nate-o...what is the link to the forum re: my pantsless bunny? i am curious. Pablo, look forward to seeing ya not this wed but NEXT unless we decide we need to get some shit done prior to the Supanova Con. Nate - DO NOT forget to bring the stapler that nite - we will need it to staple heaps of comics together. Actually - i think we WILL need to get together at least 1 or 2 days prior to next meet to get pages to Jay to copy & cover to Pablo to copy so we can compile em on the wed...that OR hand em over wed & we will NEED to get together thur/ fri BEFORE to compile - either way we will need 2 meets.   ciao fer now...

        Ha! See I'm critical of myself not just everyone else!!    I was always of the impression that you were more critical of your own work than anyone else's. With work ethic like that, you'll never get professional comics work. You're supposed to be lazy, late, and half-assed.   I've gotta say, I'm really happy with the mood at Foolproof right now (fine  now , but  earlier ...!). Pablo was a shot of double-espresso energy right when we needed it, and I don't know anyone more dedicated to improving their work than Nate, Tony and Pablo.   We've all had the stresses of life and work (or looking for work) pressing on us and at times it looked as though we'd be grounded before we flew. But I think we've gotten over some kind of hump, and we've settled in to a work mode that - hopefully - will push us onto bigger and better things.

       Well almost finished roughing out all of the pages for monkey business. With the site being taken down I'm very interested in doing some renovation with the design. Y'see I've really wanted it to be playful and fun but what I end up doing is gaudy and nasty and for some reason people like it. But in all honesty it's hack work. If I'm to keep with this I want it to be like clay until I find Foolproof's soul, it's zeitgeist.  Ha! See I'm critical of myself not just everyone else!!  So what I plan to do is 1 (as in one) page that will list updates and up coming comics etc. As other things start panning out I'll build on like the extension of a house. Pablo has put forward some slogans that have really appealed to me and Jason has some stuff that can be expanded upon.  The only constant will be the news/ updates page, everything else will be interchangeable. Stuff at the moment can get stuffed until I have  good stuff  to put up. New comics for sale can be part of news/updates. Webcomics will go up when they're completed. Tony seems to churning out comics strips, so they'll go up when they're ready.

       Saw  The Day After Tomorrow , um, yesterday (don't worry, I didn't pay for it). And, while it's not a  terrible  movie, it really is rather pointless. Apparently the moral of the story is: When the World - by which we mean America - is in trouble, they'll have to rely on Third World contries (e.g. Australia)to take them in. So isn't it ironic about the whole illegal aliens/border crossing thing? Huh, isn't it? And we should probably save the planet, too.   Meanwhile, with the USA and Europe gone, Australia will be themost powerful nation on Earth, and John Howard will rule the world. Wow, it's a much scarier movie than I thought.  Also, I read Joss Whedon's  Astonishing X-Men   #1. Some good points, some bad. I'm holding my opinion until there's another issue. Basically he's just stuck to the "X-Men Reeboot Issue 1" template that Marvel must have laminated and stuck on the wall.

I may shake may head and say, "No, no, no." but that person has every right to say what they want.   Twice I've edited the blog I don't intend to do it again.  Now on to the news:  Pablo and Tony are thinking about doing a D20 book, I've been putting together character art so I stay ahead of the game. So far I've done Clownfire, Spiny Norman and Dr. Lusar, the project won't done for a while.  For those that don't know D20 is a role play system like GURPS. D20 threw open it's doors a few years back and invited anyone to create their own addition to the D20 family.  Yes this was immature but what the fuck. Push me and I push back.

       What is with people?  Firstly, let me say, I don't like people who drive vans. If you're not in the A-Team or out solving mysteries, get a real fucking car. So...I'm driving to work today and that thing happened where I simultaneously changed lanes with the guy (in a van) behind me. No-one was cut off, he wasn't in the lane when I started my change, he didn't have to hit the brakes - we were travelling at the same speed.  Anyway, he changes lanes again to come up beside me and give me the finger. Now, "the finger" dates back to the 11th Century and I'm kinda over it's offensiveness, so no biggie there. But then the fucker THROWS SOMETHING AT MY CAR! Something small, admittedly (his brain, perhaps) but COME ON! I ignore it - I'm driving a car, and Supergrass' new song is playing, I've got enough to concentrate on - and he speeds of to get stopped at the same set of lights as me.  So, I wonder if it made you feel better, dickwad. If tossing something at my car salved your hurt widdle feelings. I got your rego number, if there'd been damage I'd be ramming the cops up your arse right now.

        urlLink OzCommunity Forums - The Challenge begins! Website Launched and Registrations Open!   THe OzComics 24 Hour Challenge is on next month Queens Birthday Long Weekend, anyway people are thinking way too much about the challenge. Seriously I haven't been worked up about things in a long time but the question about ruling pages (in challenge) it's moot. you've got a dealine 24 hours and a large chunk of it is taken up by page layout.  Admittedly you need strategy, for me I know it's a smart thing to limit the panels per page 2s, 3s and 4s. As long as it doesn't go over 5 panels you should be ok. Hell your comic can be  splash pages , it's okay.   Limit your characters. 1 to 3 characters max, you're not creating the next LOTR in 24 hours (You may be inspired too though)  face the fact that the art will not be up to code and get over it.  You can work tightly but how much is too much? Why do I say this? Because the challenge is more than a gimmick to max comic output. It's a chance to loosen up and work freely.   Those of you who work in studios that require you to work in a house style (You know who you are) - this is a break from that demand. Use it you'll be better for it. Working too tightly will suck the fun out of the challenge.  Remember work smart, not hard and that it's  24 pages in 24 hours  - there's no limit on panels.

        Jason will be happy there's a sequel to Metroid coming out - and it's multiplayer!   I don't know about that. You know my self-imposed ban on adventure games, and it was Metroid that started the whole thing. I'm just not motivated enough to finish the damn things! It sounds childish, but if it's too freakin' hard, then I dont want to do it! It's a game, it's not supposed to stress me out more than work!

        The Comics Robot debate has exploded  after Comics Australia's interview with the mystery poster, spilling into a hefty debate over the story "Blackout" which appeared in Kneepockets #2.   Update on the Icon Comics (Marvel) and Icon Comics (LF Webber):  Seems Luke is free to continue to use his imprint but it looks like Luke might have given up the ghost. A shame if he has...  I have started using cover letters that bang on about how brilliant an illustrator I am. I'm not to comfortable with the practice but if it lines up  design related jobs  then I'll continue with it.

       I love the Australian Federal Government,  they're a bunch freaking morons.  They gyp education once again in the budget and basically make it impossible for everyone to have a tertiary education. It's obvious that the politicians are focused on the here and now rather than the future.  Meanwhile everyone gets distracted because "Big Brother Uncut" is on. Nngh! Don't get me started on "reality TV"! >:-(

Why am I talking like Silverback? He's been on my mind is all I can say. I'm having a lot of fun figuring out his revenge on the SuburbanKnights. Are fried gorilla gonads a delecacy anywhere in the world? I'm going to have to dig out my old Giffen issues of JLA and JLE for Pablo. I must re-read them myself, as well.

        urlLink OzCommunity Forums - Sell me Manga, I don't get it.   The Manga debate has sparked again... Boring. All really revolves around is a lot of varying opinion and of course the occasional view that manga is superior to American mainstream or funny animal drawings. Annoying is what it is.  Don't get me wrong, I like manga, I like anime. I just don't  like  manga and anime in that way.  Yes, Ghost In The Shell is brilliant but what has it been followed by? Man Machine Interface and it's pretty ho hum. All I want to say is that anime's and manga's pool is pretty diluted too, for every FLCL there's 20 Love Hinas, for Ashen Victor there's 50 Dragonball Zs. It gets worse with the anime that gets screened on TV, apart from the mandatory bad dub it's Sailor Moon, DBZ, Yugi Oh, Pokemon etc.  We don't see the good stuff , just what's marketable and sells.(re: a lot of crap out there.)  It's no wonder we have people saying, " I don't like manga." All we've got is the endless regurgitation of bad ideas. Let's face it DBZ is a bad idea from the get go, it takes what was a charming story, an interpretation of the legend of the monkey king and reams it royally up the ass. The round friendly art was traded in for ugly, angular drawings. It takes half an episode to power up and eight episodes to finish a battle. I could now say, "what does this teach our kids?" but I'm not because it's more of a case of, "This is entertaining?"   It could be worse though, remember when the company who did the original TMNT animation bought the rights to do a new Speed Race series? Let's not and say we did.  Take an event like that and the strap it to an animated series and a trading card game...

       Ugh, CSS is a wall and I am currently beating myself senseless against it.  I can format text and get it to do what I want but when it comes to positioning - fuck - using graphics nothing or a broken image link. I need a book. I can't afford to sit online all the live long day trying to learn CSS from sites where the author eats, breathes and shits the stuff.  The language is deceptively simple but it's like trying to get a date from a gorgeous woman who is just - unattainable!  Come on CSS! Just one lousy date - I mean break!!

       Fat Stormtroopers,  Brian Michael Bendis the Musical  and an overdose of Stickfas aside, Supanova seemed to be a rousing success in general, but almost everyone I spoke to in Artist's alley seemed disappointed at AA's new location. Still, Supanova's still in it's infancy and complaining gets nothing accomplished. They didn't move the alley across the room to ensure sales would drop, and I'm sure if they'll listen to whatever feedback they get.  The 'corridor of doom' did seem a bit ill-considered, though.   As for Foolproof. Well, we sold far fewer comics than last year. But through the marvels of creative accounting, we made about twice as much money. Go figure.  So, we'll probably be back next year, all things going to plan. And I'd love a piece of the Melbourne Con that's rumoured.

       Man I'm bored. Must draw, must draw. Big debate about blogs and LJ's over at  urlLink Ozcomics forum.  It amused me yesterday but today people are being a bit level headed, except for one fellow who I think over shot the  urlLink "Rant-a-go-go" thread  and just spilled his guts.  I think blogs are useful, I get to speak and you all just read, I do hope you take what I say with a grain of salt though. I set this up as a way of communicating with Jase, Tony and Pablo. We just let you in so you know that Foolproof comics is not just me but also 3 other very talented individuals. We hope to have a tower in the city one day with a big "4" an the top of it.

        "Current fave thread: Raymondo persone reviews the Wraith."  I didn't say this on the forum, because it didn't seem constructive, but - to be honest - I didn't particularly like  The Wraith   or  the parody that got its creator all up in arms. Go figure. As for turning into a squash and living with singing furniture: That happened to me once. Stay outta my peyote stash, Soehardi.

       Saw the latest  Harry Potter  on the weekend. I don't know if it's less impressive than the last two, or if I'm just becoming bored with the whole thing. It's well made, but...I don't know. I have the feeling these things are gonna go on for ever. I can imagine Harry growing up and leaving Hogwart's, only to return as a teacher in  Welcome Back Potter . Nice to see the Ring Wraiths got work after  Lord Of The Rings  wrapped up, though. I'd been concerned that they'd been doomed to play Ghosts of Christmas Past, Grim Reapers and the like forever more. Whatever you do, don't see H.P. at the drive-in, though. Not that it makes any difference to the movie, but the second feature is  Scooby Doo 2 . I have not the words to describe what I saw. If it had played out like a feature-length episode of the cartoon, then fine. If it had been animated, it might have rated a 3. But the whole movie seemed dedicated to ramming a message of "be yourself, you're better than you think" down your throat. I know it's a kid's movie, but when parents need Scooby Doo to teach their kids life lessons, I weep for the future.

       Hey guys, I can officially say that page 2 of the GRU Crew story is done! Woo!  In reference to Ray Charles: Fuck. All of the music in the world has officially just lost a little piece of it's soul.  I completely agree with everything Jase said (Why aren't you this articulate in person? Or "Why is it that what you write is interesting yet what you say makes me want to ignore you and watch Big Brother Uncut?) from all reports Ray was an amazing man that lead an amazing life. We're all better off for having heard his music, a music with  real  highs and lows, with spirit and  soul .  Nate: you wanted to be entertained, right? How about this- Two fish are in a tank, one says to the other: "You man the gun turret, I'll drive"  Coming this Fall (what the hell kind of fucking date is that?  Fall  I hate those stupid US ads. It should read "Coming out at some random point within a fucking 3 month period because we have no fucking idea when we're going to be finished and our crack smoking producer wants to generate interest so the plebs will be subtly brainwashed into seeing the film en masse and hence generate enough revenue for him to be able to afford to snort 1kg coke off a [insert fucked up fetish here]'s [body part]" Note: This can also apply to the music industry. But I digress...) from...er...me...and Foolproof comics -                             FISH TANK  (TM)              Two fish. One armoured assault vehichle. No Prisoners.

       This years 24 hour comics challenge was a stellar event. I could only do an 8 pager because I had to work the Sunday. Bully for me it only took me 4 hours to do and I get my first pay stub in a loong while this thursday!  There are a few notable enteries, namely David Tang and Alex Major's comics (just use the link to ozcomics in the right sidebar) as well as some bratts who did a good job (pretty mediocre story though) but are totally up there own asses with tickets on themselves.  I imagine them as a really, really, nerdy borg collective.

       My flag's at half mast.  Ray Charles was a legend, and I will truly miss him. Ray was a master of R&B, Soul and Blues back went those words meant something. Back before, sometime in the late 80's/early 90's these genres merged into the lackluster, homogenised pulp passed off as R&B by people like R. Kelly and whatsisname, and that other guy. Blind since age 7, Ray Charles overcame adversities that would leave today's "R&B" stars curled in the foetal position moaning like imbeciles. He played music with a passion rarely seen today and he  always  looked like he was enjoying himself. Why are there no blind musicians any more? There were quite a few blind bluesmen, back in the day. You know why? Because semi-talented "musicians" are coddled and made palatable to the masses. No-one knows what to do with an independent spirit anymore. No-one knows how to handle someone who can - indeed HAS TO - do it all himself. Someone like Ray Charles.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, I urge you to check Ray's stuff out. I know it's passe, but the beauty of that is that you can usually pick up his albums quite cheap. R&B stood for Rhythm and Blues. The real, depression-era, grass-root blues, with a slightly more up-beat tempo. Not the "I don't have enough money for drugs because I have seven court cases pending and one of my bitches up and took my Ferrari" crap doled out today by buffoons in sideways baseball caps and more gold than Mr. T in his prime.  If you have any sense of music history, look at it this way - Without Ray Charles, there would be no Quincy Jones. Without Q, there's be no Michael Jackson. And without Mike, there'd be no R. Kelly, whatsisname or that other guy.

       Why is it so hard for my father to grasp the simple concept that when you make spaghetti, you boil the water before adding the spaghetti noodles? On that note why does he assume I'm a cooking novice, I do know how to cook.   Man I so need to move...

       My computer problems have been solved, it was those darn Trojans! Downloaded Spybot and things are going swimmingly.  I have a new casual job. I start this weekend so unfortunately I cannae participate in the 24 hour challenge.  Jase you think WSFM is crap try listening to C FM all the way back from the Central Coast it was enough to make me want to drive my car off the Mooney Mooney Bridge (The bridge so nice they named it twice.)   What could be worse than that? My sister playing Michael Buble's album (he's such a twat) and Mandy Moore's cover album.   Ugh, it's MOR and  twee...

       Posting from home today as I'm on holidays all this week. God bless the man who invented leave loading. It's like getting paid to NOT come to work.  Anyway, a couple of things were bugging me since my trip up the coast on the weekend. Actually, they have more to do with the traveling part of the trip than the coast itself.  Firstly: I think the RTA should put a moratorium on number plates proclaiming how HOT, COOL, SEXY, SXY or GR8 you think your car is. We've all seen 'em people, no-one cares any more (Special note to the guy in the Honda CR8 - GR8 CR8 says 'Great crate' to me, is that what you intended?).  Secondly: Does anything  suck  as much as WSFM?   W  e   S  uck   F  or   M  oney actually played  Kung Fu Fighting  on the weekend without the slightest trace of irony. And does  anyone  want to hear Daddy Cool ever again? And they play a station promo that has some Westie lunkhead saying "You don't even need a record or CD collection any more because you have you guys". Putting aside the hideously improper use of pronouns, does this guy mean to say that, prior to ditching his CCR, BTO, LRB and ELO CD's (plus, undoubtedly, the  Best of Queen  and the soundtracks to  Forrest Gump  and  The Big Chill )he would play, say, three songs in a row (ABBA, Fleetwood Mac and John Farnham) then stop to chat with his friends about frozen Indian Food, insurance and the newest Subway sandwich? OK, maybe he did.

       Those people with the clipboards in shopping centres seem to strike at the most inopportune times, don't they. I was choking on my lunch today, when I heard from behind me.. "How are you today, sir?" "Well, I have lettuce in my sinuses,lady. And you?"  All this to hawk a credit card. Like I need  another  credit card.

       Finally picked up Volume 1 of  Invader Zim  on DVD last night. I have to say, I was a little surprised that I had seen all 9 episodes (actually, 1 half-hour episode and 16 fifteen-minute episodes). Still, it's one of the funniest and quirkiest cartoons to ever hit TV, so there was no disappointment.  The pilot is a bit strange. Billy West voices Zim and he sounds a little like Fry from  Futurama . They hadn't quite gotten down the superior air that Zim has regarding humans either, so he's a bit wacky. Can't wait to check out the audio commentries and the Irkin subtitles.

       No poo, no porn, no French homosexuals. It's getting harder and harder to write a decent creator bio with all these rules.  I read Avangers#500 last night&nbsp;and as a long time Avengers fan, I have to say "Wow". When they said things were going to change, I thought "yeah, heard it before". But...Wow. Bendis rocks.

       There's been a lot of talk of robots lately. If we have to be robots, maybe we should be robots  in disguise . So... urlLink Which Transformer Are You?   I was Brawn. In episode 1:15 of Transformers, Brawn has Prime  throw  him at the Insecticons in order to kick their asses  mid-air . So, yeah, I can live with that.   By the way, belated birthday wishes Nate. I always remember that it's in July, but never the date. And I think you're supposed to  bathe  in the blood of virgins, not  drink  it. That's just weird. Weirdo.

         Another Year Older and Deeper in Debt...    Thanks to all the people who emailed me best wishes on my birthday. I would've posted sooner but my computer is well problematic.  My family seemed to feel bad that they didn't get me a lot of things. Which is strange because I was ok with not getting a lot, you know dinner wasn't great but it was made  from scratch &nbsp;and it's true, it is the  thought  that counts. I also got money from parents which was an added bonus, I went out today and bought  Tranformers Energon Megatron , when I brought it home my Dad looked at me as if my head had fallen off. I was thinking that he thought that I was too old for such things (ages 5 and up. I see no cap on that age bracket.) I buy toys how else am I going to stay young? Drink the blood of virgins?

       I enjoyed  I, Robot  quite a bit more than I'd anticipated. I thought it would be a lot more Asimov-y, and there are parts of me that are still asleep due to prolonged exposure to  Bicentennial Man . But it seems a little more comic book inspired, with a bit of manga thrown in. And there's a bit of subtext about slaves and slave races etc. that makes it a bit more interesting (although I'm still not sure it was entirely intentional).  Anyway there is no - repeat, NO -  Batman Begins  trailer attached, at least not at Hoyts. Just  Aliens Vs Predator , which could go either way, but since it was written by the guy who wrote  Resident Evil , I'm gonna give it a go.  Resident Evil  is a Big Mac of a movie, it's not good for me, it's not even all&nbsp;that great - but there's something about it that I&nbsp;found&nbsp;strangely satisfying.&nbsp;It held no pretentions to being anything more than it was, and I hope  AvP  sticks with thatattitude. Basically, I just want to see a whole bunch of people die.

       The script for the 2nd radio play is complete. I have no idea when it will be happening (Tony, if you'd like to enlighten us...?) but anyway, I've done my part.   Good meeting last night, the whole thing is starting to feel more serious without being...what's the word?...Oppressive? We've got stories to last us a damn long time, and I'd like to see us stick around long enough to do 'em. Not just SuburbanKnights stuff, either. It's&nbsp;exciting again.

       I'm in a dark mood... and you know most of it's my fault but I'll blame everyone else tonight. Yep, you all suck every last one of you because somehow,  someway  you're all responsible for me being unhappy. &nbsp; Now that's out of the way, I rented "School of Rock" and I got to say I liked it. Especially how the opening credits were handled and I was quite surprised to see Joan Kusack looking fairly attractive in a school marm type of way. Ms (is she married? I dunno.) Kusack usually looks&nbsp;frumpy in most films like Toys and from what I've seen in the ads,  "Raising Helen."  &nbsp; Bought "Dark Fury", on Saturday it's a 1/2 hour short that links  "Pitch Black"  to the upcoming  "Chronicles of Riddick"  (I scored a free pass to this with the Dark Fury DVD. Yay me.) it's directed by Peter Cheung who created  MTV's Aeon Flux.  There's a trailer to,  "Van Helsing: The London Assignment"  on the disk. A lot of CG by the looks of it which kinda ticks me off because it's glaringly apparent, but the character design looks like it was done by Carlos Pacheco (appologies for incorrect spelling.)

       OK, I got so excited about being an ABC warrior, I forgot to copy their little blurb:  &nbsp;  In bars frequented by colossal death robots, you're always the quiet guy at the back who no-one ever bothers. And for good reason. You've fought in several nuclear wars, could beat the sun in a staring match, and have a chin larger than many articles of furniture. Morals are not a concept you understand, but strangely enough, nobody ever questions your judgement. Usually because they're dead. Even Judge Dredd wets himself when you turn up. Grrrr.  &nbsp;  I also learned a little more about them  urlLink here . Alan Moore, Simon Bisley and Steve Dillon, oh my.  &nbsp;  Speaking of giant robots (and who else thought Tony would be C3PO?), I bought the 1st season of Transformers the other day and have been reliving my early years. I love Scatman Crothers, he got to be Jazz  and  Hong Kong Phooey. Nobody's cooler than that.  These are the things you realise after not having seen the show for 20 odd years: Prime was seemingly based on John Wayne and Wheeljack was called Wheeljack even before he had wheels. And&nbsp;all the humans are annoying (although I did remember that).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What else? The radio play nears completion....  &nbsp;  Oh, and I saw Fahrenheit 911. I'm not going to start a political argument, but I do think anyone who feels uninformed about the war in Iraq should see at least the 2nd half.  The first half covers a lot of what's in  Dude, Where's My Country?,  concerning the Bush/Bin Laden links in business matters and even a supporter of Michael Moore could see how it could be written off as hyperbole or exaggeration (it may not be either, though). But the second half concentrates on the war, and is told by the people it has effected most. Some very emotional and provocative stuff that might open the eyes of someone who might not have made a decision which way to vote yet.  It does contain some rather graphic images, though. That doesn't mean don't see it, just be prepared, is all.  &nbsp;  One last thing, in case more people that I know of read this thing: I seem to have broken something that does not belong to me and have upset someone very dear to me in the process. So, if anyone has a Ginger from  Chicken Run  pull-string wriggler (from Hungry Jack's, back when the movie was out) that they want to be rid of, I would really appreciate an email at  urlLink jason_buckley74@yahoo.com.au  . Here's a  urlLink pic of the Rocky toy , to jog your memory (I couldn't even find a Ginger picture!). It may just be my life you're saving.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

           Which Colossal Death Robot Are You?        You are Gigantor!     Born in 1963, You are possibly the original colossal death robot, being one of the patriarchs of the current crop, and definitely an advocate of old-skool enemy-bashing. Why use a clumsy particle weapon when you can create supernovas just by flexing your arms? Your one minor weakness is that you are entirely dominated by some kid with a remote contol - still, don't let it get you down. You can sink a nuclear submarine with jazz music.

       I put some of my pent-up frustration into the adaption last night and made it about 3/4 the way through. So far the bad guy and his henchmen have been introduced, Fool's done something stupid, and it's been established that Lightning Force has a small penis. All in all, I'm quite pleased. The Announcer (who should rightly be called The Narrator, but things are as they are) gets some of the best lines, but that is As It Should Be. Still have to try and beef up Shadowbolt's part but he does get some good lines in the bits he is in. He might actually get the big heroic act at the end, we'll see.

       There's plenty of silly crap in here! I think this may be the only place ever that the Treaty of Versailles can be included as silly crap. And  Safety Dance ? That's both silly  and  crap.  Work sucks so hard it's gonna cause a rift in the space/time continuum, and if the phone rings again, I'm gonna put someone's face through it.  Hoping to finish the radio play adaption tonight, but at this rate my doing anything at all relies heavily on my mood.

        Why the fuck has the Versailles Treaty been copied and pasted into the blog?!?   The  whole  Versailles Treaty wasn't posted, just the first 26 Articles which I deemed relevant to the  Versailles Treaty  vs.  Safety Dance  discussion.    "Doesn't anyone reply to SMS anymore?"  I'd rather spend my money on crack.   Anyway, you didn't actually compare anything, all you did was transcribe the articles in question. D minus.  All I did was transcribe!?! I hand wrote all of the articles out of a book, then painstakingly typed them up by hand on a mechanical typewriter and THEN typed them up for the blog. Don't you guys appreciate the effort I went to? *cry*...*sob*...*sniffle*   Unlike Pablo, I have no anti-Will Smith feelings, and, not having seen Garage Days, I don't hold it against Alex Proyas.  My Anti-Will Smith feelings stem from the fact that I  know he can act  and for some baffling reason  chooses  not to.  Gargage Days  WAS a big steaming heap of crap, no arguments there. All that said I'm still going to go see it for a reason that can be explained in two words:  Batman Trailer . Because there's no way in hell I'm seeing  Catwoman  (otherwise titled:  Minnie Mouse becomes a super hero after being attacked by cats )at the cinema.

        P.S Who's #1 now?!  Still Nate, actually.  Anyway, you didn't actually compare anything, all you did was transcribe the articles in question. D minus.  I think I figured out what my problem with  I, Robot  is. Unlike Pablo, I have no anti-Will Smith feelings, and, not having seen  Garage Days , I don't hold it against Alex Proyas. No, my problem is, as usual with me, far more obscure and petty. It's the word "robot". After years of dealing - cinematically - with Androids, Droids, Replicants and whatever-Bishop-from-Aliens-was,  robot   just doesn't hold the same weight as it used to. It always reminds me of two things: Those arm-with-a-claw-on-the-end things that build cars on assembly lines, and  Futurama . I can imagine Dr, Zoidberg in Will Smith's part, waving his claws and shouting "There's something wrong with the rob'ts"  Oh, and I'd finally gotten  Safety Dance  out of my head. Thanks for putting it right back in there.

       I hardly think it's worth competing about who writes the most in the blog, Jase. I mean, sheer verbosity can hardly be cause for celebration. According to that logic we should award those who are as longwinded as possible and demerit those who hava a talent, nay an  obligation  to be succinct.  I suppose that what I'm asking is; is it, in the end, the length of a final article or post to a blog or any form of media, mainstream or otherwise (you can write in curry on cheezles for all I care...as long as it's legible) that gives said article or post validity or 'weight'? Is  Macbeth  or  The Versailles Treaty   a greater written work than, say,  Row Row Row Your Boat  or  Safety Dance ?  For the sake of interest here are the first 26 articles of the Treaty of Versailles:   THE COVENANT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.  THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES, In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war by the prescription of open, just and honourable relations between nations by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments, and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another Agree to this Covenant of the League of Nations.   ARTICLE I.   The original Members of the League of Nations shall be those of the Signatories which are named in the Annex to this Covenant and also such of those other States named in the Annex as shall accede without reservation to this Covenant. Such accession shall be effected by a Declaration deposited with the Secretariat within two months of the coming into force of the Covenant Notice thereof shall be sent to all other Members of the League. Any fully self-governing State, Dominion, or Colony not named in the Annex may become a Member of the League if its admission is agreed to by two-thirds of the Assembly provided that it shall give effective guarantees of its sincere intention to observe its international obligations, and shall accept such regulations as may be prescribed by the League in regard to its military, naval, and air forces and armaments.Any Member of the League may, after two years' notice of its intention so to do, withdraw from the League, provided that all its international obligations and all its obligations under this Covenant shall have been fulfilled at the time of its withdrawal.   ARTICLE 2.   The action of the League under this Covenant shall be effected through the instrumentality of an Assembly and of a Council, with a permanent Secretariat.   ARTICLE 3.   The Assembly shall consist of Representatives of the Members of the League. The Assembly shall meet at stated intervals and from time to time as occasion may require at the Seat of the League or at such other place as may be decided upon.The Assembly may deal at its meetings with any matter within the sphere of action of the League or affecting the peace of the world. At meetings of the Assembly each Member of the League shall have one vote, and may not have more than three Representatives.   ARTICLE 4.   The Council shall consist of Representatives of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, together with Representatives of four other Members of the League. These four Members of the League shall be selected by the Assembly from time to time in its discretion. Until the appointment of the Representatives of the four Members of the League first selected by the Assembly, Representatives of Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Greece shall be members of the Council. With the approval of the majority of the Assembly, the Council may name additional Members of the League whose Representatives shall always be members of the Council; the Council with like approval may increase the number of Members of the League to be selected by the Assembly for representation on the Council. The Council shall meet from time to time as occasion may require, and at least once a year, at the Seat of the League, or at such other place as may be decided upon. The Council may deal at its meetings with any matter within the sphere of action of the League or affecting the peace of the world.

ARTICLE 7.   The Seat of the League is established at Geneva. The Council may at any time decide that the Seat of the League shall be established elsewhere. All positions under or in connection with the League, including he Secretariat, shall be open equally to men and women. Representatives of the Members of the League and officials of he League when engaged on the business of the League shall enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities.The buildings and other property occupied by the League or its officials or by Representatives attending its meetings sha11 be inviolable.   ARTICLE 8.   The Members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations. The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, shall formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments. Such plans shall be subject to reconsideration and revision at least every ten years. After these plans shall have been adopted by the several Governments, the limits of armaments therein fixed shall not be exceeded without the concurrence of the Council. The Members of the League agree that the manufacture by private enterprise of munitions and implements of war is open to grave objections. The Council shall advise how the evil effects attendant upon such manufacture can be prevented, due regard being had to the necessities of those Members of the League which are not able to manufacture the munitions and implements of war necessary for their safety. The Members of the League undertake to interchange full and frank information as to the scale of their armaments, their military, naval, and air programmes and the condition of such of their industries as are adaptable to war-like purposes.   ARTICLE 9.   A permanent Commission shall be constituted to advise the Council on the execution of the provisions of Articles 1 and 8 and on military, naval, and air questions generally.   ARTICLE 10.   The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.   ARTICLE 11.   Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action tnat may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council. It is also declared to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.   ARTICLE 12.   The Members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or to inquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the report by the Council. In any case under this Article the award of the arbitrators shall be made within a reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of the dispute.   ARTICLE 13.   The Members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration. Disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence of any fact which if established would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made or any such breach, are declared to be among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration. For the consideration of any such dispute the court of arbitraion to which the case is referred shall be the Court agreed on by the parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing between them. The Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award that may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.   ARTICLE 14.   The Council shall formulate and submit to the Members of the League for adoption plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice. The Court shall be competent to hear and determine any dispute of an international character which the parties thereto submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.   ARTICLE 15.   If there should arise between Members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, which is not submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 13, the Members of the League agree that they will submit the matter to the Council. Any party to the dispute may effect such submission by giving notice of the existence of the dispute to the Secretary General, who will make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and conside ation thereof. For this purpose the parties to the dispute will communicate to the Secretary General, as promptly as possible, statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers, and the Council may forthwith direct the publication thereof. The Council shall endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute, and if such efforts are successful, a statement shall be made public giving such facts and explanations regarding the dispute and the terms of settlement thereof as the Council may deem appropriate. If the dispute is not thus settled, the Council either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper in regard thereto Any Member of the League represented on the Council may make public a statement of the facts of the dispute and of its conclusions regarding the same. If a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report. If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanim~usly agreed to by the members thereof, other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice. If the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the Council, to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement. The Council may in any case under this Article refer the dispute to the Assembly. The dispute shall be so referred at the request of either party to the dispute, provided that such request be made within fourteen days after the submission of the dispute to the Council. In any case referred to the Assembly, all the provisions of this Article and of Article 12 relating to the action and powers of the Council shall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a report made by the Assembly, if concurred in by the Representatives of those Members of the League represented on the Council and of a majority of the other Members of the League, exclusive in each case of the Rpresentatives of the parties to the dispute shall have the same force as a report by the Council concurred in by all the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute.   ARTICLE 16.   Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13, or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nations and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial, or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval, or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League. The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenantbreaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League. Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the League represented thereon.   ARTICLE 17.   In the event of a dispute between a Member of the League and a State which is not a Member of the League, or between States not Members of the League, the State or States, not Members of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of Articles 12 to I6 inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council. Upon such invitation being given the Council shall immediately institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.If a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, and shall resort to war against a Member of the League, the provisions of Article 16 shall be applicable as against the State taking such action. If both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purpose of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.   ARTICLE 18.   Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty or international engagement shall be binding until so registered.   ARTICLE 19.   The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world.   ARTICLE 20.   The Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se which are inconsistent with the terms thereof, and solemnly undertake that they will not hereafter enter into any engagements inconsistent with the terms thereof. In case any Member of the League shall, before becoming a Member of the League, have undertaken any obligations inconsistent with the terms of this Covenant, it shall be the duty of such Member to take immediate steps to procure its release from such obligations.   ARTICLE 21.   Nothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international engagements, such as treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe doctrine, for securing the maintenance of peace.   ARTICLE 22.   To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant. The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf of the League. The character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions, and other similar circumstances. Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory. Other peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic, and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League. There are territories, such as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population. In every case of mandate, the Mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in reference to the territory committed to its charge. The degree of authority, control, or administration to be exercised by the Mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the Members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council. A permanent Commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annual reports of the Mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the mandates.   ARTICLE 23.   Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the Members of the League: (a) will endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women, and children, both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial relations extend, and for that purpose will establish and maintain the necessary international organisations; (b) undertake to secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control; (c) will entrust the League with the general supervision over the execution of agreements with regard to the traffic in women and children, and the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs; (d) will entrust the League with the general supervision of the trade in arms and ammunition with the countries in which the control of this traffic is necessary in the common interest; (e) will make provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit and equitable treatment for the commerce of all Members of the League. In this connection, the special necessities of the regions devastated during the war of 1914-1918 shall be borne in mind; (f) will endeavour to take steps in matters of international concern for the prevention and control of disease.   ARTICLE 24.   There shall be placed under the direction of the League all international bureaux already established by general treaties if the parties to such treaties consent. All such international bureaux and all commissions for the regulation of matters of international interest hereafter constituted shall be placed under the direction of the League. In all matters of international interest which are regulated by general conventions but which are not placed under the control of international bureaux or commissions, the Secretariat of the League shall, subject to the consent of the Council and if desired by the parties, collect and distribute all relevant information and shall render any other assistance which may be necessary or desirable. The Council may include as part of the expenses of the Secretariat the expenses of any bureau or commission which is placed under the direction of the League.   ARTICLE 25.   The Members of the League agree to encourage and promote the establishment and co-operation of duly authorised voluntary national Red Cross organisations having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease, and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.   ARTICLE 26.   Amendments to this Covenant will take effect when ratified by the Members of the League whose representatives compose the Council and by a majority of the Members of the League whose Representatives compose the Assembly. No such amendment shall bind any Member of the League which signifies its dissent therefrom, but in that case it shall cease to be a Memb,er of the League.   ANNEX.   I. ORIGINAL MEMRERS OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS SIGNATORIES OF THE TREATY OF PEACE.   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BELGIUM, BOLIVIA, BRAZIL, BRITISH EUPIRE, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, SOUTH AFRICA, NEW ZEALAND, INDIA, CHINA, CUBA, ECUADOR, FRANCE, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HEDJAZ, HONDURAS, ITALY, JAPAN, LIBERIA, NICARAGUA, PANAMA, PERU, POLAND, PORTUGAL, ROUMANIA, SERB-CROAT-SLOVENE STATE, SIAM, CZECHO-SLOVAKIA, URUGUAY   STATES INVITED TO ACCEDE TO THE COVENANT.   ARGENTINE REPUBLIC, CHILE, COLOMBIA, DENMARK, NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, PARAGUAY, PERSIA, SALVADOR, SPAIN, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND, VENEZUELA.   II. FIRST SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE LEAGUE OF NATION5.   The Honourable Sir James Eric Drummond, K.C.M.G., C.B.      Now if we compare this to the lyrics of the song by popular 1982 supergroup Men Without Hats, the sensibly titled  Safety Dance    S-s-s-s A-a-a-a F-f-f-f E-e-e-e T-t-t-t Y-y-y-y Safe, dance!  [Spoken] We can dance if we want to We can leave your friends behind 'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance Well they're no friends of mine I say, we can go where we want to A place where they will never find And we can act like we come from out of this world Leave the real one far behind And we can dance  [Sung] We can dance if we want to We can leave your friends behind 'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance Well they're no friends of mine I say, we can go where we want to A place where they will never find And we can act like we come from out of this world Leave the real one far behind And we can dance Danc¨¦e!  We can go when we want to The night is young and so am I And we can dress real neat from our hats to our feet And surprise 'em with the victory cry Say, we can act if want to If we don't nobody will And you can act real rude and totally removed And I can act like an imbecile  [Refrain] I say, we can dance, we can dance Everything out of control We can dance, we can dance We're doing it from wall to wall We can dance, we can dance Everybody look at your hands We can dance, we can dance Everybody takin' the cha-a-a-ance  Safety dance Is it safe to dance Is it safe to dance  S-s-s-s A-a-a-a F-f-f-f E-e-e-e T-t-t-t Y-y-y-y Safe, dance!  We can dance if we want to We've got all your life and mine As long as we abuse it, never gonna lose it Everything'll work out right I say, we can dance if we want to We can leave your friends behind 'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance Well they're no friends of mine  [Refrain]  Is it safe to dance, oh is it safe to dance [6x] Is it safe to dance    It's clear to see that in the case of modern social relevance alone the  Safety Dance  is the more succinct and powerful piece, delivering an equally poignant statement on a similar subject.  Therefore, I would like to conclude this brief post with the sage-like wizdom of one Homer J. Simpson:  "We can dance, We can dance, Everybody look at your pants"  P.S Who's #1 now?!

       I'll be busy packing tonight, but once on the Central Coast again (as of Friday night) I'll have plenty of time to work on adapting a story I did into what we hope will turn out to be the next SuburbanKnights radio play. So must remember to take something to write on. And something to write  with . It's times like these that I kick myself for talking myself out of buying a laptop. I'm adapting from memory due to my inability to read anything that I've written and not throw it out in dusgust. But it seems to be working out so far. Tony laughed, anyway.  If my blogs seem to get longer from this point, it's because I noticed that Nathan has written more words on the Blog than me. I know it's not a competition. Well, it's not a competition if I'm coming last. But since I'm coming  second ....

       As long as you're invisible, you can be as naked as you like. Just don't touch me.  I bought The Crystal Method's new album  Legion of Boom   (on the strength of the single  Born Too Slow )and gave it half my attention last night. I have to say it was the first CD I've bought in a while that I was mostly satisfied with. I've been very fickle with my music lately. Sometimes you get the feeling that  everything  sucks.

        Three other talented individuals? I always knew Nate had a side project. But I think our building should have a big F.  "Turn left at the Big F," people would say. "There's a nice cafe in the Big F..." "Look, some guy just jumped off the roof of the Big F!"   Pablo can be the Invisible Girl.  Over the last two weeks I've bought two games at the EB sale: Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu and Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage. I am now wary of any thing branded with a WB Interactive Entertainment Logo. Batman should be a 4 player game but it's only two player. PPG's saving grace is the mini games to unlock and the fact there's no levels but missions and you fly through and around Townsville(USA).  Anyway the games feel like there should be more to them but WBIE cut the funding.

I opened up one of the boxes from my last move... so much porn, so much stuff that I had not glanced at forever. Too much to explain away as "reference material". More to the point when the hell did I have that type disposable income???  The moral of the story? Porn, but in moderation.

       What are you talking about Tony?! 9/11 rocked my pants off! I found it immensely entertaining, and even occasionally soundly done! Phoey to you if you don't like watching dubya play golf!  I regards to the creative process I think emotion,  any emotion , is essential to delivering good work. You can't just pump out and mass produce something that's supposed to be evocative and meaningful because people just aren't gonna care, and you will dissapoint everyone because they'll see you're just in it for the money. I've gotten to know you guys pretty well and, despite my best efforts, you guys are about everything  but  the money. The radio play currently rocks, Jase and I have no doubt that when you're finished, it will rock even more.  Maintain the RAGE!

       We have a web link! YAYYY! our sometime before 2006 web-site WILL rock, i know it to be true! Apologies to Jason for having the fun lifted from his project...i know it isn't my fault or even our radio rep John, but there you go. Just thort I'd try & calm the waters a little. Hope it worked.  I agree the cliffhanger hang-up they had was annoying, but the length thing i think is sorta justified...heck MINE had to be longer too! Kick back &amp; relax...enjoy the need to dive into more of the english language we all loove to twist & turn to our own SuburbanKnightly advantage...or somesuch. I did - turned out OK.  Remember, we may not have been happy with the 1st result BUT everyone i know who heard the 1st inaugural SK Radio Play said it was easy enuff to understand &amp; enjoyed it immensely...& it wasn't just family either - i actually don't value thier opinion as much as anyone else's. I even had customers i have  zero  relation to listen in back when i was a house painter & they enjoyed it as well. So 2nd time out we can only get better.  So dont get too riled by it all Mr Buckley-san... way of the world man, way of the world. Even if it does blow a little...OK a lot.  So after having the fun SUCKED out, I hope I have been able to BLOW some back at ya! (Pablo, insert innuendo here champ)  HEY! this is the longest post i have ever written! WOO-HOO!

       It should come as no surprise to anyone who read Pablo's last post that last night's meeting had a distinct air of filth about it. It might just be me (and I think it's not - Nate back me up here), but I have no interest in how "clean"  anyone's  "playing field" is. On a related topic, this blog will now feature the best out-of-context quote from our bi-weekly Foolproof meetings. Today's quote: "I'll just have to wear a cock ring" - Pablo. And for those of you wondering how you can say a thing like that out of context...well, it really wasn't.  Other than that, we may have figured out what we want to do and how often we want to do it (eat pizza? fortnightly? No, that was the  old  mission statement), more when it's official. And a medium-sized step was taken towards the rebirth of our Foolproof website.

Anyhow, in news at hand, it appears as though the inagural (and possibly final) issue of the GRU-Crew will be ready in a mere three weeks! Yaay! Now if someone could just tell the artist to get off his ass and...  Oh crap. It's me...  Ahem. That right! My inagural work for foolproof as an artist will be coming out in four! -count 'em- four! weeks. In a mere month I go from mere voice over guy (the metaphorical 'drummer' of our band of misfits) to secondary artist (the meaphorical 'rhythm guitarist' of our heavy metal oddysey). Assuming I get it done on time.  Oh well, back to the literal drawing board. And by 'literal' I mean 'metaphorical', by 'drawing' I mean 'having dirty crazy depraved consentual sex' and by 'board' I mean 'simultaneously with multiple women of different races and sexual orientations'. Kind of like what Jase means when he says he's 'photocopying the script' or Nate when he proclaims he's 'playing with Optimus Prime', or even Tony when he says 'Lining the drywall with marshmallows'.
