       Hmm... 5 Technical Fouls eh Alex? We'll see about that, don't forget that I am the supreme ruler of this fledgling blog and I'll edit yo' ass in a second. Nah, I guess I wouldn't do that... Anyway, way to steal my idea for your post from my other blog, also you stole words from Adam Sandler's songs. Come up with your own damn stuff you freakin' communist bastard. =)  That aside, I'd like to say your eye-crust post was exceedingly stomach wrenching Robert, was that your desired effect?  Not much else to say now besides that so I'll end my first post here.   P.S. I'll be expecting a witty remark from you Alex. And take heed, the GrandMaster doesn't like to be disappointed. Bitch. =D

                Eye-crust is one beast of a bitch. Especially for me, every morning that I oversleep I have to deal with task of eye-crust extraction which takes a bit of time, taking longer if I am doing other things like posting in a blog. You have to switch from doing whatever you are doing to rubbing your eye a bit, each time scrapping a small amount off, still leaving a sizeable annoying amount. But after awhile it becomes second nature, switching from task to extraction as a weaver weaves in and out with needle, thread, and piece. When finally reaching your goal of an irritatant free eye you can go back to your work with a bit more efficienecy feeling accomplished and relieved.   I can't find a reason to eye-crust either, only that it is one of those inconsiderate things that just get in the way and make your life harder for no particular reason.

       Some people would consider me a dotard for me writing on a "blog" at three in the morning, but I have something to say to that. Fuck off. I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm horny, and I need to take a leak. Besides, I have nothing better to do. Sleep you say? Well, sleep is for pussies. All a dark, handsome stud like me needs is lots of water and Rocky Road ice cream. A few gallons of testicle-shrinking Mountain DewÂ® will also do. Well, back to the task at hand. I seek to bring this blog forth from the obscure masses and crotch-thrust it forth into the limelight. But to do that we will need discipline. So here are the ground rules. If you are not me, and you post anything obscene about your pee pee on this blog, that's a technical foul. If you have one or more breasts weighing you down, you need to stop reading immediately and go back to cooking and cleaning/having babies. If you resemble either a) Blas Diaz or b) Rebecca T., in any way, you get five, count 'em five, instant technical fouls. The penalty for having a technical foul is painful circumcision. Of course the penalty is waived if you manage to do seventeen cock push-ups. There is more to come. I will keep you updated.
