      The past few days have been somewhat normal, except for not having to get up at the crack of dawn to sit in traffic.  3 days into my vacation and I've been to the dentist twice...woo hoo NOT!  I've done alot around the house, mowed the lawn, cleaning the front hall of the house, resealed around the bathtub, and just clean the apartment.  Tomorrow I'm going to go look for material for new curtains in the kitchen then I'm going to repaint it...only it's going to be the same color..lime green with white trim!  It's weird to be actually sitting in my home office/guest room for the first time since I moved in....(chris made me clean out the junk) but at least we now have more room.  I can't wait for chris to be totally moved in, our big step towards our future.

      Why is it that people drive stupidly?  I mean come on is there a need to drive 40 in the high speed lane?  And why can anyone use a freakin turn signal when they're turning or changing lanes?  Ok I feel better now after getting that off my chest.  Today is Thursday and I hope it's better than yesterday.  Yesterday was good all except for the A/C flying out of our 3rd floor apartment window. It's now in A/C heaven if that's where they go after they commit suicide.  No one is to blame, except Chris thinks it's his fault.  The damn thing was missing the side skirt pieces and it wasn't really secure in the window, not to mention it didn't work half the time, always freezing up.  We're just glad the kid from the second floor wasn't outside playing....moral of the story screw the a/c to the window sill!
