      Once I get a webcam, I will post more pictures and what not. I have a scanner but, all my pictures are all of me when I was younger, like between of baby and like age 7.  I don't have much to do, it's not raining but I don't have much to do.   don't have that many friends to hang out with...   I HATE BEING LONELY!!!  Atleast I have all my friends or soon to be friends out here on the net I guess......   atleast I can talk to them....  Cleaning??  I gotta clean my room..  bbbbooooo..  how do you say that???  that would be messed up to actually say :)  chat with me if you are on sometime ladies and gents....   well, I guess I better get started....  what is your fav. movie??

      It is pouring right now, just me and shelby, the owner of the houses dog...  listening to John Mayer.  Work was so totally boring... I did nothing but work on like three or four computers... which is really low for me... so, I wasn't very happy about that... plus, today, it was STEAMING back in the shop today.  if you are curious, I am a computer technician.......   So, right now, home alone, just watching the rain with Shebly the dog and wishing someone was with me to run in the rain with!!!  ah well, just gotta have fun alone yet again I guess...   can't you tell I love being alone!!!    Is there a job that you would never do in this whole world, no matter how much money you got paid a year???

      it has been raining for the past couple of hours. I feel really alone too... I love to enjoy the rain with someone.   that is alright though, time will take care of that...... hopefully...   my friend dared me to run all the way across the street and up the street and then back...  I was like, is this man kidding??  I kicked off my flip flops and ran up and down the street while it was pouring and ran back tothe house.  I was drenched!!  It was fun though!!!  I hate some steak and then, I came back into my room.....  I don't know what to do with my time now, sometimes...  I just feel so alone!!!    how do you feel about the rain? would run with me in the rain?

      Here I go restless heart Another lovely misadventure in the dark All my friends who knew me when Tell me not to wander down that road again What they don't know what they can't see It's being on that road that makes me free Some say I'm running I know I'm falling back to you  The water's deep under the bridge As I pass by our old house upon the ridge All our sins have washed away Now all that's left are all the things we didn't say Oh restless heart you beat so fast While my mind is telling me that it won't last Some say I'm running I know I'm falling back to you  Against the odds I'll roll the dice I guess my heart has won despite all good advice So grab your things and come on in And get to know your children once again When does a fool stop being a fool? And since when is love obliged to any rules? Some say I'm running I know I'm falling back to you  Let's learn to give let's talk things out Let's give them someone else to talk about Some say I'm running But I know I'm falling back to you Martina Mcbride - Some Say I'm Running  well, you could consider me running.... running away from everything that is important to me. I don't think I can make a right decision... but then again, what is a right decision.  A decision that is made for yourself that seems to have the best outcome overall...  well, what happens if that outcome is not what you want but it is still the best decision?  how you may ask?? well, take for ex. a guy talking to a girl...  she has someone but she is flirting with you...  do you tell her how you feel about her and say hey, I like you and would like to kiss you.   just to get your feelings out there or do you keep your mouth shut and don't worry about it???  the best decision, I have chosen twice is not to say anything because they have someone.....  AAAAAHHHHHH, I just want to scream...   Especially my friend named Jen!  I love her to death and I couldn't picture being without her but she has told me several times in the past that there is no way we could ever date and then, the other night on the phone, she is sitting here telling me she has thought about us being together a couple of times....   what?? I don't quite understand??  Maybe it's because I am getting older and sooner or later, I am going to be what ladies want because I am the nice guy????  I don't quite understand it. Then, the is the two that got away. misty and stephanie....  man....  I can only assume that they aren't the ones I am suppose to be with ya know??  But, how do I know?? I thought I knew twice but....   ah well...  well, that was just me getting it out, thanks for listening. take care:) andrew

      Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard that pretty mouth say that dirty word And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into but she covered her mouth and her face got red and she just looked so darn cute That I couldn't Even act like I was mad Yeah I live for little moments like that  That's like just last year on my birthday She lost all track of time and burnt the cake And every smoke detector in the house was going off And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms And I tried not To let her see me laugh Yeah I live for little moments like that  I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me And I thank God that she isn't cause how boring would that be It's the little imperfections It's the sudden change of plans when she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding hands Yeah I live for little moments like that  When she's layin on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark and about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm and I want so bad to move it cause it's tingling and it's numb she looks so much like an angel that I don't wanna wake her up yeah I live for little moments when she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it Yeah I live for little moments like that  brad paisley - little moments  hey everyone, been awhile since I stopped in on here..  I have been busy at work and hanging out with my father.  He and my mother got divorced a couple of years ago and I didn't want to talk to him because of that.. I was very upset with him but I moved on a couple of months ago and I have been going to see him about once every couple of weeks.  I ain't rich!! I can't drive an hour to see him all the time!!!  :)  But, I do miss him and his family as well!! I got a lot of sun and if my little webcam worked better, I would post pictures of my tan...  everyone told me my face has been all red and was like what did you do, go to the tanning bed? I was like me, I don't think so!!! I already have a natural tan, why would I go??? they were like...  we don't know....  what do you think? can I leave? do you want me to stay.... stay she says... stay.... why... You smash my heart, you break my pride you hurt my soul, you crush my body... my mind... over and over again...  why can't I see it....   Why can't I ...  let me comfort you baby.... she exclaims as she wraps her arms around me....  same thing...  over and over and over... and over again...  comfort me... hurt me...  crush me.. lift me... break my spirit...  life me higher then before and just...  just... leave me alone!!!  walk away...  stay gone... can't I go now?? let me be...  just... just.... stop hurting me... my heart.. can't... take... it... just... stop it... can't you see...  hurt... pain... torture...  just... let.me.go.

      We're only human baby we walk on broken ground We lose our way, we come unwound  We're turnin' circles baby We're never satisfied We fall from grace, forget we can't fly But through all of the tears that we cry We'll survive  Cause when we're torn apart Shattered and scarred Love has the grace to save us We're just two tarnished hearts, But in each other's arms We become saints and angels  I love your imperfections I love your everything Your broken heart, your broken wings I love you when you hold me And when you turn away, I love you still, and i'm not afraid Cause I know you feel the same way And you'll stay  Cause when we're torn apart Shattered and scarred Love has the grace to save us We're just two tarnished hearts, But in each other's arms We become saints and angels  These feet of clay (feet of clay) They will not stray  Cause when we're torn apart Shattered and scarred Love has the grace to save us We're just two tarnished hearts, But in each other's arms We become saints and angels  sara evans - saints and angels  just got out of the shower after cutting my hair and I am feeling so much better then my last post...  today work was alright, I am trying to move to alabama or anywhere really, just trying to get a better job and get up out of this town...  I mean, Lexington is alright but I wanna get away from everything that is here ya know??? so, trying to find new jobs or something else I can do. I can program in C++ and learning perl and I have been working on computers for almost a decade now...  I just wanna get away ya know....  to get away....   help me to get free from this place I despise...   why you ask? why despise a place that loves everything about you because I have been here way too long too many memories bad memories. memories that keep haunting my daydreams... memories that haunt my night terrors...   memories that haunt my everyday life because  memories, are all around me.... memories...  memories...  need new ones forget the old ones.... memories, let them die....  R.I.P....

      So, I saw this girl that caught my eye the other day and it looked like I caught hers.  but, I didn't know what to say.  this isn't the first time this has happened, it happens a lot to me. because I dont' know what to say to them because I am so shy. Once I get to know someone, I don't have a problem talking to them it's just at first....   I guess, in the end, I don't want to be rejected or laughed at ya know??  But what can I say?  I want to come off nice and sweet and grab her heart ya know? but I don't want to be desperate or anything? Hell, I would even love for a lady to walk up to me and be like hi!  that is all she would have to say, then I could go from there but that would atleast let me know she is interested.   all well, life goes on.. I just hate being alone! talk to you all later!!

      it's been a little bit. I have been working really hard recently so I have been tired and my family has been throwing parties and what not. I have been hanging out with them and what not. Partied the last two nights.  SWEET, VERY SWEET!!!   I hope everything is going well with you all!   well, my week as a tech manager I guess ended on a good note.   even though we have been really busy and I still haven't been able to catch up with the work that I have, but that's all right. As long as I have all this work to do, I will always have a job right? I have been in a lonesome mood the last couple of days.  I hate being alone and ya know, I don't just want anyone, I want someone!  But I'm really shy so it's really hard for me to meet people!!!   So, I guess I wish sometimes a girl would walk up to me and be like hey, how are you??  and just surprise me and be interested in me ya know?  Her chase me for once!  that would be awesome!  but hey, sometimes we don't get what we want right? well, I am yawning a lot so I better get some sleep for work tomorrow. my boss comes back and I guess he will evaluate my work I guess..... well, take care! ;)

      Could you let down your hair be transparent for awhile Just a little while to see if you're human after all  Honesty is a hard attribute to find  When we all want to seem like we've got it all figured out  Well let me be the first to say that I  don't have a clue I don't have all the answers  ain't gonna' pretend like I do just trying - to find my way trying - to find my way the best that I know how  Well I haven't memorized all of the cute things to say but I'm working on it Maybe I'll master this- art form someday If I quote all the lines off the top of my head Will you believe that I fully un-derstand all these things I've read I'm just trying - to find my way trying - to find my way  lifehouse - trying  *posting songs that fit my mood at the time*  what's going on? today was alright for me, tell me about yours? I have been manager at the store I am working at, well over just the shop, and for the past two days, some lady has come in there and ran whatever I was suppose to do!!!  Did I get pissed off, oh yeah!  but, what could I say?? get out? I know I will need her help so I can't really burn the bridge if you get my drift....  so, I have just been kind of dealing with it, once she leaves, I take over the duties again and do whatever I need to do....  so, work has been BUSY to say the least.  I have been coughing a little bit more than usual, I kinda think that is after effects of the pnomenia *sp* I know I spelled it wrong...  so, I don't have to work tomorrow, which makes me happy and I even got a thirty dollar check from a rebate. are you kidding, that is awesome, it's like have free money:):)   well, I guess I better go and do something else:)  take care!

      I'm finding my way back to sanity again Though I don't really know what I'm going to do when I get there Take a breath and hold on tight Spin around one more time And gracefully fall back to the arms of Grace I am hanging on every word you say  And even if you don't want to speak tonight That's alright, alright with me 'Cause I want nothing more than to sit Outside heavens's door and listen to you breathing  Lifehouse -breathing  my day was full of stuff to do today. I have become manager for a week because my boss left on vacation.  I was absolutely swamped after about lunch time that I didn't even get to go to lunch so I just left work early....  I have a feeling this week is going to be crazy!!!  I have been playing this new game called Sacred...  it seems really cool and I love rpg's so yes, I am a gamer, just not online and not all the time...  I find time to do other things that I want to do!!!  I went walking with some friends today and we went to the park and just hung out.  today was overall!!!  a good day!  I was pleased, other then the nathan sleep I got last night!!!   nathan = nothing/none/no so, now I am hungry and I have to take my pills for the night so I can fully get over this sickness..  I almost there though, just a couple of more days of medicine and I will be done!! well take care.....:)

      Finally.  No coughing, no headaches.....    YES!!! finally off this sickness cloud....  in the past couple of days, I have done pretty much nothing, watch law and order, sleep, and more sleep.  went to work today and my boss was telling me I am taking his position for a week while he is on vacation to see how good I do..  if I do really good, I might be in order for a promotion...  YEAH ME YEAH ME!!!  I can't wait for that one. been in this job for almost three years working my @$$ off just trying to get somewhere... and finally.   Still taking medicine though and it sometimes makes me drowzy so...  better get off here before I go but let me get your alls opinion on something.....  "why is it my fault, so maybe I try to hard, but's is all because of this desire. Just wanna be liked, just wanna be funny, guess the jokes on me.   So call me Captain backfire.   another social casuatly, score one more for me.   How could I forget, momma said thanks for speaking, no filter in my head, what's a boy to do.  Guess he better find one...  I'm never speaking up again, It only hurts me"      That is so true...  everytime a guy speaks up, even if he is a nice guy, it just backfires and hurts him.....   ah well, tis one of life's many challenges for me to solve....   take care....

      Well, how is everyone doing??? I know it has been a long timeand I am a little tipsy so please forgive me if I mess up a little bit of even a lot!!!  I am happy I finally got my offer from Huntsville Alabama.  I am moving:) :)   Yeah me...  well, I am kinda happy about it.. I am glad to be getting away from everything up here and just worry about something so new that will take all my time from bull S***...  But, I just miss having someone to come with me or even just be up here for me ya know? I mean, really, I don't know what to do...  I am trying to take care of all my stuff before I leave but I know I won't nor do I want to take care of all of it...  there is some of it that I don't really want to deal with....    What I would love, is to talk to this new chick, tell her he ain't worth shit, and come with me because she is so wonderful but ya know what... it ain't meant to be if she wants to be with him so....   later taters...   I am out... moving... getting away from everything and just moving on with my life...  moving down south. happy and alone.   I guess it's just everything big thing in my life that I have done, it's been alone.  I just want someone to be there with me every step of the way and I don't get that and I don't know what to do...  I want it so bad but how??  I don't know what to do with someone...   I know the move is going to be great for me and get me away from everything...  a better job, possible better people to be around and just a better environment but...  I will miss my family, some friends..... you know who you are, and just some other things..  I guess in the end... I hate being alone even though I have been alone through every big change in my life and there have been oooohhh....  hmmmm...  five changes not counting this one......   just one person to be there through it....  ah welll  *sigh*   just gotta go with it and deal with life because, what else is there....  well everyone, will talk to you soon.  that is a lot of stuff about me personally...   take care:)

      Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots I give a holler to my sisters on welfare Tupac cares, and don't nobody else care And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot When you come around the block brothas clown a lot But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him Cause sista you don't need him And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em You know it makes me unhappy (what's that) When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman I wonder why we take from our women Why we rape our women, do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we don't we'll have a race of babies That will hate the ladies, that make the babies And since a man can't make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up  (Chorus)  Keep ya head up, oooo child things are gonna get easier ooooo child things are gonna get brighter [2x]  (Verse Two:)  Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two And I realize momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life, to raise me right And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems tha rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up You know it's funny when it rains it pours They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is it ain't no hope for tha future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup And even though you're fed up Huh, ya got to keep your head up  (Chorus)  (Verse Three:)  And uhh To all the ladies havin babies on they own I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo' You can't complain you was dealt this hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless Because there's too many things for you to deal with Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless While tears, is rollin down your cheeks Ya steady hopin things don't all down this week Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me I was given this world I didn't make it And now my son's getten older and older and cold From havin the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is drivin Benz I'm still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but please... you got to keep your head up  there is a song that all men to stand behind!!!  fuck all the men out there that treat the woman like shit.. Yeah I said it...    FUCK YA'LL...  Yeah, I didn't always treat women like queens but I never hit her, or disobeyed her or pulled stupid shit!!!  Boys.....    thank the lord for the kids!!!  Treat them right and show them a beautiful world and never lie!!!  :) take care

      Well everyone.  I have made it to Alabama and I kinda like it down here..  I have absolutely no drama and you know what, I have no idea who anyone is down here other than people I work with.  Right now I am staying in a hotel and I will sure be writing so much more then before now that I can get on the internet.  I hope everyone is doing better then I am.  I had my car broken into today.. Nothing was taken but my back windshield was broken.  Now, I am going to have to pay for that with the little money I have right now.   That is alright though, I can make it through this.  I drove down here to get away from it no matter what....  so guess what, I am doing it... I am doing it yea me yea me....   Work isn't too bad down here... there is this guy that thinks he knows everything and is going to try to tell me how to do my job and I and getting a little tee'd right now.  Eventually I know I am going to get pissed off at him but for right now, I am just getting a little teed off...  so tell me about everything that is going on with you gues.  I am doing alright.  I hope everything is going alright for you all..  take care:)
