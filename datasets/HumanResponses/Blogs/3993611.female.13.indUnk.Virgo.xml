      I got back from my Durham/Chapel Hill, North Carolina trip yesterday.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; I spent the night on Thursday at&nbsp;my Uncle Bobby's&nbsp;house.&nbsp; My brother, 2 of my&nbsp;cousins, and I watched a couple of movies that's about it.&nbsp; We were gonna go four wheeling but it started to storm.&nbsp; Friday, I went to Erwin for about an hour to go get my Grandma from my aunt's house.&nbsp; When I got back to Durham,&nbsp; Will and the same two cousin's had&nbsp;gone to&nbsp;my aunt's grave.&nbsp; So I decided to&nbsp;play&nbsp;Thomas, my 5 year old cousin, at his pond.&nbsp; Then I went back to Chapel Hill and stayed at the condo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday morning,&nbsp;my dad left to go to Uncle Bobby's house. My mom, my sister, and I have to wait til' 12:00 to leave because we had to wait for the cable guy to give us internet access.&nbsp; When we finally got to Uncle Bobby's house, we hopped into one of his golf carts, rode down to the helicopter hanger (it's like a warehouse where he used to store his helicopter).&nbsp; When we got there, we had to clean EVERYTHING in it.&nbsp; There were about ten 4-wheelers, 5 dirtbikes, 2 or 3 regular bikes, the golf carts.&nbsp; Then we swept.&nbsp; We couldn't sweep in little small sweeps, it was one continuous sweep. He didn't want dust to get on his old cars.&nbsp; After that my dad and I went with Uncle Bobby to feed his horses.&nbsp; Sounds easy, but he's got 40 horses.&nbsp; All in all though, I didn't mind helping him out.&nbsp; It wasn't that bad.&nbsp; Then after was fed the horses, we went back up the hill to his house, said goodbye, and came back home.&nbsp; I enjoyed my trip up there.&nbsp; Saturday was the only day we had to work.&nbsp; It wasn't bad at all.&nbsp; Well that's all I can think of so I'm gonna go.

       Hey,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was probably my first realization that summer's ending.&nbsp; The major event *also the only one* was registration was today.&nbsp; I got Mrs. Brinson.&nbsp; So far Jennifer is the only one I know of who is also in her homeroom.&nbsp; A lot of people seem to be in Mr. Herman's homeroom.&nbsp; I hope more people are in Mrs. Brinson's.&nbsp; That's about all I want to talk about on that topic.&nbsp; Tonight I'm going to a BBQ at the Gurley's.&nbsp; That's about all I can think of at the moment.&nbsp; I'm leaving for Durham/Chapel Hill, North Carolina tomorrow so I may not have time to write a new entry.&nbsp; If I find time I'll add one though.    &nbsp;   -Charlotte
