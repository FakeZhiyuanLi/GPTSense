      Well for some reason I couldn't get up this morning it was weird cuz I didn't go to bed all that late. Once again I went to the JCC to work out, play bball, swim etc. and it was awesome. I got there assuming I would run into Scott Boileau cuz he told me he was gonna meet me there at noon, of course he never showed up. Well it was probably better off he didn't show up cuz I ran into Leo Dehabey and chilled with him all day then I ran into Todd Jolley. When I first got to the J I benched a rep then did three sets of curls only to realize I totally didn't feel like liftin, so it became a cardio day, so me and Leo ran the treadmill then used the bikes. We then went upstairs to play some bball and got a game of 21 goin with these two black guys that had the most amazing ups I've ever seen. These guys were like 5'9 and they were dunkin and stuff, I felt so...white. Well I didn't do too bad, I scored 13, I'm gettin pretty good at bball considering I play every day. Well I was all tired and hott so we all went outside and scoped out the chicks. I swear the hottest chicks in Sylvania are members at the J, it was amazing, there were so many. Well we came home and my bro fell off of his bike and got pretty messed up, I wasnt sure how it happened but I felt bad it was like a freak accident. Well we ate dinner, then went to my bros baseball game. I saw Ashley Mcnair, and Mike Anderson there, and unfortunately, my brothers team showed Ashley's brothers team a real ass whoopin..It's ok, no hard feelings. Well now I'm home and plannin to go to the J tomorrow to hang out with Gabi..My one true love..Gabi..I love you all three of our daughter's names will be Gabi. Later Dudes

      Well today I woke up early and worked on some of my honors biology homework assignments so I feel pretty good that I'm being productive and getting stuff done. I wasn't sure what I was gonna do today but like usual, I ended up going to the JCC. Well none of my friends could go so I just ended up going with my little brother which isn't that bad. Right when I got there, I ran into Gabi, Britt, and Haley. I indirectly gave Gabi her ass whoopin in one on one so she now knows that I would destroy her lol. The J was fricken swarmed with hott chicks it was insane. They were eeeverywhere, left and right. I also talked to Chase Bano, and Candiss for a little bit so that was cool. I'm really tired right now tho cuz i was up late, once again Kristin woke me up sending me a text message at all hours of the night, but it was cool, I got to talk to Her and Kamel on the phone while they were in Alabama. Well right now, I'm eating a hot pocket...ok well now it's night and I just got back from Red Lobster, but on the way home we stopped at Handels, and no, I didnt get Reem anything, I'm really sore from lifting weights and this is my day...Peace Up

      Well...Today is my first day back from Katie's cottage and I haven't talked to my dad in person for like 4 days. I called him yesterday to wish him a Happy Father's day but big mistake...I guess he found out about something bad I did, I'm not sure what, but he's Pissed...So i just came home last night...and watched TV in my room all night and didn't say a word to him. It was really boring, the only thing I did was send text messages to Kristin and Kamel in Alabama, and Max at Camp Storer. Well anyways, Katie's cottage was alot more fun than I thought it would be considering there were three guys and one girl, we went tubing and that was pretty sweet this time around but my earrings were pissin me off, I had to tape them so they wouldn't fall out, I think their more of a hassle then their worth. All of my friends are out of town and I have nothing to do, their all gone and I'm so bored. Well I don't really plan on doin anything today, maybe go to the jcc at most, I'll just be sittin around the house. Well thats all for now...Peace up
