      To my friends, family, enemies, and the occasional dust bunny..listen up..  Well..those who know me realize that I do not always do things by the book..in some instances I run over, eat or otherwise destroy the book. (I have not figured out if that is a good or bad thing)..therefore I have (yet again) another opportunity that I want to take advantage of (for my own sanity…maybe)  My past experiences have allowed me to see and experience some wonderful things but what really means a lot to me is being able to share them with those I care about (whether you want to hear it or not).  Four years ago I drove across the country from Hollywood, Florida to Hollywood, CA (hey I wasn't doing anything constructive)..the result...5000 miles on a co-worker's daughter's car..couple of speeding tickets..and some incredible sights and experiences in places called the "Loaf and Jug"...in other words a success.  Two years ago..it was biking across the awesome country of Ireland (where else is someone nicknamed "Beerman" supposed to go)..the result..drinking my weight in the lovely black stuff they called stout..the result once again was a success  Now for the latest...I have been given an opportunity to pursue a dream of sort by combining the above two. I have been hired as a tour router for a company called CycleAmerica. Starting on June 8th, I will be flying to MN to meet with the staff and then make our way out to Seattle for the start of the tour on June 19. I will be working as a tour router and participating on a cross country bicycle tour from Seattle, Washington to Boston, MA. I will be finishing in Boston on or around August 21 and then be there for about a week seeing family and friends in the area. (Come on up...the beer's cold) I will be following the northern route of the US and into parts of Ontario Canada. I am very excited about this opportunity and hope to come back with a new attitude, wonderful experiences and some sore legs and an ass to match. The trip is a total of 63 days covering about 4200 miles through 13 states and parts of Canada. (After this..I think I will hang up my shoes for a while and practice staying on a couch)  I am experimenting with some options on keeping in touch with everyone and hopefully will do this with email but am trying a service called “blogger” which basically means postings that I can upload pics, notes, and other dirty incriminating stuff throughout my journey. You can access this via my website at www.scottkatzer.com  (there’s nothing on it so don’t get too excited) and hit the link labeled “I power Blogger”. This should take you directly to my site where you can read emails from the road. The other link on my personal web page (cycleamerica) has my actual tour route (or you can get it from the website www.cycleamerica.com) I am hoping to have pictures uploaded from each part of the trip so you can click on the part of the tour and see the pictures from that part of the trip..we’ll see how it works.  You can reply and post your emails to the blogger site as well by clicking the link at the bottom of the blog page (who thinks up these names anyway) Hopefully this works..otherwise just watch the news every once in a while and perhaps you'll see me get chased down by a moose or something. I figure this will make people happy because I get to “think” I have an audience and those who want to read it can..and those that don’t …well screw you too…just kidding. You can always email me at either Skatzer@ssr-inc.com or scott@scottkatzer.com. Hopefully there will be a tree somewhere that I can plug into. I’d love to hear from you and see what the rest of the world is doing.  My company has been great thru all this and has allowed me to keep my cell phone throughout all this (which means that they can contact me for work...hmmm)..anyway I can hopefully still be reached at 954-649-9109 should you want to call and say hi or will be in the area. Just keep in mind that I will be bicycling through towns where some of the folk may respond “A cell what now?” So…I can’t promise that the signal strength will be the greatest but at the very least I’ll have a way to retrieve messages. My last day in the office will be on Friday June 4th (and the &^%$* hitting the fan starting on June 5th)  I'll keep everyone posted before the start on what else is up. Looking forward to your smart ass comments and will talk to everyone soon. Apologize for the long email but since I am long winded..I figure it will be OK.

      OK...wouldn't you know it..years and yesrs of travelling for business has led me to concur that I and only I will get stopped, probed (without having dinner bought for me), wanded, patted down, and sometimes even treated fairly so I actually get up really early (yes..5am is really early) to assure that as I am bringing half of my life with me..I will have enough time for this wonderful industry we call airlines. Sure enough...everything is going too smoothly. I check-in in just about 10 minutes...too scary. Of course there is some guy on the ground crew doing circles on a bike (that looks similar to mine..hmm) right now on runway 9A...might slow things up a bit  Right now I have about an hour till my flight and thought I would partake in the Crown Room one last time...even 7am is too early for me for a beer (oh man...what am I saying??) There is another staff member who is also on my flight..funny how this cross country tour is filled with people from all over America and the other tour router is from Hallandale. Good guy named Keith..about 40 something...last we talked..he has no idea what is going on either...very cool...seems only appropriate..  Its way too quiet here in the airport...I am awaiting something to happen like a raspy speaking smoking woman from the airport to approach me and tell me that my bike had to be cut in 4700 little pieces to fit in a smaller box. I shouldn't complain...typically one has to pay about $80 to take a bike but in my case..they did not have a tape measure to measure the box so he let me take it free of charge...score one for charm and hiding the tape measure. It was kind of funny as he leaned to the woman next to him asking what he should do and all I got from the conversation that she has seen chains used but did not know how to use them..hmm..very interesting. I can see myself sitting in line as two guys in referee uniforms come out holding two ends of a chain and measuring the box yelling "first down!!" followed shortly by me yelling "in your face Delta dude" perhaps throwing in a tomahawk chop for good measure. Then again..I never did see what happened to my luggage...uh oh..  I surprised my cab driver by telling him of my plans to bike across the US. He thought it was very cool. He was from Hungary and his wife was German which made me think that the food in their place was probably pretty good. (or perhaps that was just because I didn't eat breakfast)..saving myself for the huge portions of peanuts on the plane.  I am reading emails from folks doing this trip. Its going to be a pretty good size group..should be about 60 riders..some as far away as England and Belgium. Youngest rider is 22 and the oldest is 74...if I am biking 4200 miles at 74 then I will be one happy camper (with hemorrhoids perhaps and Altzheimers...probably cranky...incontinent....arthritic tendencies...flatulence concerns...but happy nonetheless)  Still can't believe I am doing this...

      OK..although I am not leaving till Tuesday..I just wanted to say goodbye for any of you that I will not get the chance to see before I leave…hopefully you know what the hell I am up to because I really do not want to type all that out again.   I did find out that I can actually receive mail on this trip which is good because you will never know when I will have the need to partake in some of south Florida’s finest cuisine and will need one of you to mail me a conch fritter or something. Should you have the inclination to want to write or just simply want to practice or if you have no idea what a pen really is and want to jump on the bandwagon..I would enjoy hearing from you.  The address to write me will be as follows:  Cycle America c/o Scott Katzer (that’s me) General Delivery City, State, Zip as noted below (please do not actually type this genius..read more below) USA  Please keep in mind that the mail should be sent at least 6 days prior to the dates below to get to the appropriate site. I can only receive packages at the Cannon Falls, MN address so if you want to send me 6 packs of beer, b-day card (I turn the big 35 on this trip Aug.2) or something like an inflatable…uh….never mind…..please do..and don’t forget the ice for the beer…  6/25 – Thompson Falls, MT 59873 7/2 – Ashton, ID 83420 7/8 – Buffalo, WY 82834 7/16 – Philip, SD 57567 7/22 – Montevideo, MN 56265 7/26 – 205 4th Street North, PO Box 485, Cannon Falls, MN 55009 7/29 – Beaver Dam, WI 53916 8/4 – Richmond, MI 48062 8/13 – Starlake, NY 13690 8/19 – Fryeburg, ME 04037  I have no idea who names these towns but so be it….I will miss you all (well..OK…some of you anyway)  Take care and hopefully you won’t see me on the news doing something stupid..  Scott

      Its pouring rain here and has been for over 2 days since we first arrived. It was comforting to know that my tent has stayed somewhat dry (and I use that term loosely)  Right now I am sitting with the rest of the crew in a coffee shop called Goodbye Blue Monday Coffee Shop here in Northfield, MN (319 Division St if anyone cares to come by)..I am drinking something called the Depth Charge which after only 3 hours worth of sleep last night is making me stop blinking. We are doing driving tests for the van and are waiting our turns here. Back and forth running over curbs...an interesting day.  Yesterday we all arrived and met up at the airport. The folks here are pretty nice..mostly mid 20 age and of all diverse backgrounds. One woman, Tauna (rhymes with sauna)..thought I was a stalker at the airport as I walked up to her and simply introduced myself..she didn't know I was with the tour and thought I was following her..good way to start I suppose..scaring women as always.  I'll write more about everyone else as time permits but have to keep this short as the driving tests are coming up. Good to be hyped up on triple caffiene coffee before getting behind the wheel...woohoo.   Last night we went to the Mill St Tavern for dinner and a couple of beers (me? beer? go figure) in lovely downtown Cannon Falls, MN, population 3795..(for you SSR folks..Martin Liebold lived here..I think I went past his house..explains a lot why he left..just kidding Martin) Afterwards we went to Brewsters, a local pub with local flavor..5 pool tables..big TV showing the Laker-Piston b-ball game and local beer for about $2.00 a pint. Played pool for each others tents..I wanted to expand my new found condo into a two bedroom with wetbar and jacuzzi...no go as it started pouring that night..and all night..lightning storm lighting up the sky as each of us discovered the new found drips awaiting us in the AM as some tents filled up with water.  Gotta run..will talk soon

      Day 6 - June 25, 2004 - Biking from Kellogg, ID to Thompson Falls, MT (73 miles)  Why does it always look easier from a car? Actually it wasn't that bad till we got to the friggin hill...a 10%+ grade for about a mile elevating 4800 feet. Of course this happens right before lunch and 40 miles into the ride. I had to rest a number of times but I did make it on my own although I think I am going to spend the money and get a triple chainring where I can have just a few more granny gears in the front. As everyone pulled into the parking lot rest area at the top of the hill, folks cheered. I cussed out the mountain which didn't exactly make my legs feel any better but so be it. It felt like quite an accomplishment looking down into the valley you just climbed. Until folks starting telling me that I have much more to look forward to in terms of mountains...Oh joy..  The descent was amazing...about 6 miles straight downhill which was completed in seconds compared to going up it. Hitting 38 mph on your bicycle is quite a rush...and I was one of the slow ones. Folks are hitting over 50 mph on these descents but for a Florida boy on the flats most of the time, I will work my way up to it.  We stopped at the Little Bear Ice Cream parlor in Thompson Falls right after the ride to partake in some great shakes to counteract the gatorade wqe were consuming all day. That night at the high school was great as the staff got our own space complete with stereo and washer/dryer and internet access. We then went out to grab drinks at Boondoglers downtown and then proceeded to the bar next door. This woman came in with the most well behaved dog I have ever seen. The dog just sat there patiently waiting for whatever excitement brought itself in. Everyone left early except for Kira, James, and myself. We filled our faces with popcorn and proceeded to walk the mile or so back to the school which sounded like a good idea except we realized that our sore stiff legs did not like to walk much compounded with the fact that there are no street lights whatsoever in the area we are walking. Luckily none of us fell into the reservoir so it was a positive evening.  Day 7, June 26, 2004 - Thompson Falls to Missoula MT (90 miles)                        Missoula to Lincoln, MT (Router Day - 80 miles)  Had to route the day to Lincoln so did not get to ride today which according to my sore ass...was just fine. The route was somewhat straightforward...take Hwy 200 east about 80 miles...between all the driving..I put on about 250 miles today. The scenery was awesome...mountains everywhere. Wanted to take some side roads but unfortunately they were all gravel. This would be great for a mountainbike but not so much so for a road bike. I did find one 2 mile off the beaten path road which took you to a beautiful green field with the backdrop of the mountains off in the distance. Picture perfect. Even the nearby cows stopped to take a glance..or perhaps they were sizing me up like I was sizing them up....can definitely go for a steak tonight....Mmmmm  Back on the road got into Lincoln, MT where the Continental Divide passes thru this region. Had lunch at the PondeRose's Restaurant (322 Main St..I like how all these little towns have a "Main St") Lunch was great..I got a kick out of how they offered a special soup called Taco soup..when it came it was a bowl of chili...so now I am going to call chili..Taco soup. Looking forward to going back there tomorrow night where we can partake in some Moose Drool Ale at the Moose Joose Saloon.  On the way back, the car desperately needed gas and the only station in town had a clerk that was having problems with the pumps. That whole "on/off" thing must have fooled her. Decided to try and drive back and hit the nearest one I could find which was easier said then done. I am driving on fumes putting the car into neutral to coast down the hills to save gas and find this small town called Oviendo to pull into. One gas pump and two stores..the other is a bait and tackle shop. I just hope what I put into the car was actually gas.  We went out to dinner with the staff last night to give Paul (the guy who helped us routers) a goodbye sendoff as he is heading back to MN today. Dinner was Italian and damn good in this college town. A bunch of us went and saw Michael Moore's new movie Farenheit 9/11 which was basically a propaganda film about how the Bush administration screwed up the 9/11 incident and investigation. Was entertaining but funny how some people will believe anything they are told to them.  We are staying here for two nights as new guests will be arriving today and some are leaving. Took advantage of not having to be working till 10am by sleeping in...my first 8 hours of straight sleep and damn it felt SOOOOOO Good. We are cleaning and packing everything up again as week 2 starts today. New recruits...new stories...stay tuned

      Day 5 - June 24, 2004  - Spokane, WA to Kellogg, ID (90 miles)  		- Router Day – Kellogg, ID to Thompson Falls, MT (70 miles)  Today was a good day for some but definitely not all. My day was spent routing for tomorrow (Day 6). It started a bit rough as it took me 20 minutes to find a way to get on the freeway after I missed my turn. The route looks awesome..7 miles of bike path then onto one of the backroad highways to Thompson Pass at over 4000 ft elev. ( I am not crazy about that part…it always looks so easy coasting at 70 mph in a car) The route will leave the tiny city of Kellogg, ID where we are currently staying at the middle school sprawled out on the gym floor like homeless mall rats. We bike to Kingston and then turn toward Thompson Pass. The road winds all around the mountain and has a very steep (10%) grade climb for about 1-1/2 miles to the summit. Then about 6 miles of downhill which will be needed to throw up the lunch I will be eating.   Spent part of the day in Thompson Falls as I finished up early and got to take in the sites which took about 15 minutes. The town itself is small but quaint with local shops up and down Main Street. I ate lunch at Minnie’s Montana Café, a great “sit anywhere where it is clean” type establishment and then walked down to a great ice cream parlor down the street for a chocolate shake for the ride home (the body needs a chocolate shake to survive after a few bike rides…trust me). Saw the high school where we are staying tomorrow and just hope they leave the AC on.   I got back early for a change and found out I missed some excitement for the day. First, one of the coast to coast riders, Kevin, from Pittsburgh, PA had a spill and broke his clavicle which was taken care of at the local hospital. He is back with us but don’t know when he will ride next but I have a hunch within the week (crazy people I tell you). One of the staff, Ryan, also had a spill and has a nice road rash reminder on his forearm. Guess I miss all the fun when I am out routing. They are both doing OK and should have their boo-boos healed soon.  I am currently sitting here in the cafeteria where we had dinner and some of the other staff members (Tauna, Kira, Meryl, James) just wandered in looking for alternative places to sleep. It is so funny how we all seem to spend a majority of our time looking for that great place to sleep to simply get some privacy and perhaps not spend a night listening to other people snoring and farting. Granted..its funny when I do it though. I really feel I lucked out last night when I found a very comfy couch down in the basement of the dorm we were staying at on Gonzaga’s campus. I think it was the first night where I may (and notice I use the word “may”) have gotten 7 hours of sleep. I think I (and the rest of the staff) have been averaging about 6 hours a night. The hardest thing so far, for me at least, is to get used to becoming a morning person which unfortunately is something I am going to  have to do to remain sane on this trip. Up by 6am, eat by 6:30am, on the bike by 7am, lunch at 11am, done by 3pm, dinner at 5:30pm, staff and rider talks by 7pm, bed by 10pm. Since my past life as I like to put it (even though its only been a few weeks) has me eating dinner by 8-9pm, its quite a big change for me, especially being surrounded by a bunch of folks who seem to be morning people on a regular basis. We actually move into mountain standard time tomorrow as we enter Montana but have a hunch the people will still find an easy way to be up by 5am.  Most of the staff is sitting here in the cafeteria basically winding down from the day. Ryan is playing his guitar  which provides a bit of nice background music while some folks are reading by the light of the vending machines. The glow from the computer screen is the only thing allowing me to see the keys on the keyboard right now. James is going to crash behind the stage so will be known as the “man behind the curtain” for the evening.  Was speaking to Mark, the 74 year old from Louisiana, tonight. This guy is amazing. This is his third trip across the country..the man bikes 70 miles a day. Last year, a reporter in his hometown did a story on him and this year wants to do a follow up story. He found out about the blog on my website and mentioned it to this reporter so who knows…perhaps my words will seem famous in Jefferson Parish, LA.  Time for bed…you know..up at 6am thing…

       Day 2 – June 21, 2004 – Skykomish to Wenatchee, WA (74 miles)   All I can say about today is “What the *&%^!!!” Not that it was a bad day but the friggin mountains kicked my sore ass today. We had to bike up six straight miles and climb over 4000 feet…I suppose the good news about it is where there is an up..there is a down…so we coasted at over 30 mph downhill for about 8-10 miles. Awesome views of the mountains and nearby river as the road wound all along the Wenatchee River up until our Lunch Spot where we sat by the river and ate some kickass pasta and sandwiches. After biking 50 miles in this heat..roadkill would have been tasty. I have discovered that prolonged exposure to Gatorade simply makes everything taste like Lemon-Lime (or Orange if I am lucky). One highlight was biking the Iron Goat Trail which went directly through what felt like a rainforest and culminated in a beautiful wonderfall at the peak…a nice prelude to the major climb ahead up to Stevens Pass at 4,061 feet. It was quite a trying day for everyone as water stops were misplaced and part of the route was not labeled properly so we got some heat from the tour director that night…which lasted about 3 minutes.  We stayed at Foothills Middle School that night..quite a nice Middle school to say the least but of course they never air condition the gym so most folks stayed outside. A few of us stayed in the Auxiliiary gym which was much cooler since they had the AC on in the nearby cafeteria. (Its good to be the staff). We had some sort of Mexican food that night that could only be described as “cheesy”…later that night Mary, the tour director, presented a box of stuff to the group that was donated by a former rider…it was actually a really nice gesture..there were all kinds of things from tent stakes to sunscreen to those pesky feminine hygeine products…I took the bottle of tabasco…needed it for that cheesy dinner….although the feminine hygeine products may have assisted in the taste also..sorry…that was a sick joke….this is what happens when you are tired..   Day 3 – June 22, 2004 - Router Day (for Day 4) from Electric City WA to Spokane, WA (96 miles)    I am so glad I did not ride today…it got up to 90 something degrees and the route was over the desert AND had a really major climb. Got to play it easy or so I thought by driving 90 miles from Wenatchee to Electric City, WA where the Coulee Dam is located. It started out by noticing that two riders were riding in the opposite direction…thought only I do that when I drink…so had to turn them around and show them the proper route…then try to figure my way out of the city by locating little tiny yellow arrows on the side of the road with traffic barrelling down on you like ants on sugar. This was the first router day I had solo so was looking forward to the challenge. The route was pretty easy to follow as most of it went down Highway 2E all the way into Spokane. Not much to see except for a few po-dunk towns scattered along the way selling gas, antiques, and an occasional bar or what appears to be a bar. It actually appears more like maw and paw on their front porch with a jug of moonshine.   I had to bike part of the bike path (about 2 miles) so took my bike out of the car to do so. On my way back to the car, I almost nailed this huge smake crossing the road. Got a picture of it on the website. It almost became jerky for that evening.  The day would not have been that bad except as I am driving down Route 2W heading back to the campground, I suddenly cross a set of railroad tracks…since bicycles and railroad tracks usually don’t mix…I made a mental note…except I don’t remember crossing a set of tracks on my way to Spokane. So after pulling over and checking the map, I realized I missed my turnoff and have gone about 30 miles extra. So since there is no shortcuts here in never never land..I hightailed it back to the camp…with the rental car pushing 100mph on these back country roads (probably shouldn’t put that in print in case any of the staff folks read it)  I am riding this route tomorrow and not entirely excited as most of it is straight, nothing and no shade. One thing I do notice is the grass is so green and fields so vast that it looks like a green ocean (the pretty kind..not the kind that looks like pee). We are staying at a couple of dorms at Gonzaga University tomorrow which will be a treat. It was such a busy day as I had to ride part of a bike route we are taking and then route the rest of the way. Grabbed a quick lunch at a University watering hole called the Bulldog Tavern and feasted on a jalapeno burger that lets just say..be glad you were not in the car with me. Right now we are at the Sundeck Campground Resort where are campsite looks like a tent city. I am sitting here on a picnic table trying to finish typing quickly so I do not get eaten by the skeeters…it is just getting dark at 10pm and am having trouble seeing the keys so will say goodnight.   Day 4 - June 23, 2004 - Electric City WA to Spokane, WA (96 miles)    Its funny how when you drive a route and the bike it how everything appears much more painful. Just got done with this ride and was quite proud of myself as I felt pretty damn good the whole day. There was a 3 mile steep incline right at the beginning that kicked my ass but aside from that, it was pretty good..a bit boring as most of the area on Rt 2 is nothing but farms and desert. I had enough of grass and wheat for one day thank you. These little one horse towns are really great. Everyone wondering just what the hell you are doing. The conversations are mostly like this:  Unidentified person (will call him Bob for short): Biking huh? Me: Yes sir Bob: Where you going? Me: Today Spokane but we are on our way to Boston Bob: You gonna bike to Boston today? Me: No, we are doing it over the summer Bob: Where you going again?  It basically continues along these lines until I leave, go buy something, or Bob realizes that he doesn’t even live in this town.  Our lunch spot was in Davenport in this tiny city park just off of Route 2…one thing is for sure…I think my blood is turning into Gatorade  We are staying in the dorms tonight and its pretty good as the rooms are large and we do not have to screw around with any tents. I feel like I am back in college as the floors below are women’s floors ( I am too damn tired after my ride right now even if I wanted to do something). We are about to walk the campus and hopefully grab a beer later as I think I deserved it…I would get one even if I feel like I did not deserve it.

      Most people can challenge themselves by reading a book or perhaps taking up a new hobby. Yours truly has to undertake an ordeal that will affect every aspect of my body and then come back for more. Day 1 was quite an adventure.  The group we are with includes 13 staff and over 40 riders for the first week. About 24 or so will go the entire distance..much more than we anticipated. To make matters more interesting…thye appear to be early risers as most were out the door by 6:30am which means the staff has to be ready before that. Maybe if I spike their water bottles..hmm..  We started out the day by riding to breakfast put on by a local church. Seems like many organizations sponsors food for us for our ride. They whipped up some damn good breakfast burritos, fruit, muffins, etc. It was then off to Gasworks Park where we dipped our tires in the Pacific (at least ceremoniously). It’s a really great Park with an awesome view of the Seattle Skyline. Our ride took us through downtown Seattle and then out to the Burke-Gilman Trail for about 20 miles or so. It was all good until the two routers (Keith and myself) missed a turn and almost got lost..we will certainly here all kinds of crap from the folks here for that one. From now on, each time we make a wrong turn, the reasons will be either we are scoping out a new route for next year or searching for a prime pee (or tinkle if you like) spot.  One thing I am not going to get used to anytime soon with this trip is the friggin hills. Even the small ones seem like killers. We went up one that was a 13% incline for about a ½ mile or so. We went over 2000 feet of elevation gain. My legs feel like rubber. Remember a few stories back where I described how hills feel to ones body by grabbing your bottom lip and pulling it over your head…well…do the same thing…only tie it to the back of a moving pickup and you about feel the burn. Definitely not in Florida anymore.   We crossed through several small towns including Duvall, Sultan, and Goldbar…all of which are located at elevations higher than the amount of people that live there. Some beautiful scenery of the mountains in the distance and the farmland in front of them. So far we have passed about 6 trillion espresso shops including one in the middle of our climb. Now..call me crazy but after biking up a 13% hill would one really want a cup of coffee? Perhaps if I can put my ass in it to ease the pain then sure…otherwise..no. (Apologize to any queasy individuals for this visual)  We arrived at Skykomish School here in Skykomish WA around 2pm and everyone spread out to claim their sleeping spot. Some are staying in their tents out back while I opted for the floor of the gym. One less step to do in my opinion. Hopefully it won’t be spent listening to farting and belching all night (and that’s just me) This school is really interesting as it appears it has not changed in over 50 years. The pictures on the wall are dotted with the various classes that have passed through these halls dating back to the early 1930’s. Each class has had between 2-12 people only…so much for that prom but of course there is a coffee shop in town and one bar….makes for a fun social environment. Get her doped up on coffee and beer then trip the light fantastic…of course there is no hotel in town…so much for the fun aftermath.  A few of us went to the Skykomish River which is right down the street here for a dip in the icy river. The river was about 57 degrees so you can imagine what it did to our bodies  (can someone say..shrinkage factor?) It did wake us up…after about 15 seconds in the water it was enough but the view is awesome. Returning back to the school to take a cold shower since the boilers are not on did not seem that bad since it was probably 3-4 degrees warmer than the river.   Tomorrow is going to be a hard day as we bike up and over Stevens Pass, Elev around 5000 ft. On some of the hills today, I hit about 35 mph on the downhill…I am told on this one that it is very easy to accelerate to over 50 mph. Guess the helmet is a good thing huh?  Dinner was fantastic..these little old ladies from the local Lions Club cooked us an awesome Lasagna dinner and told us stories of the old town…they even are cooking us breakfast the next AM…nice to have a home cooked meal on this thing

      Woke up from our beautiful slumber in Wenatchee, WA at 7am and had to still drive 150 miles back to base camp at UW today...so friggin busy as Keith and I still had to double check routes, spray paint arrows (would be nice if we hit the ground and not the car for a change), and give a talk tonight about tomorrow's activities..which technically is today since its after midnight here...going to make this quick  Checked out some awesome waterfalls and also realized that a 6 mile climb is going to be a real bitch. We did arrive back in time after partaking in more oysters at Ivans (hey..we were starving)...the other riders arrived today and we are staying tonight at the Univ. of WA dorm..feel like a dejected college student...the dorms are not half bad except the city is going through a heat wave...not the best sleeping weather but it beats screwing with a tent.  Met the other riders over a pizza dinner at Roundtable Pizza...some interesting folks to say the least...one called himself "panty man" which makes me wonder...is he receiving them or wearing them? Remind me to bike  "WAY" behind him...the folks do seem nice and are from as far away as England and Austrailia mostly 40 something in age...some folks brought us presents including one man who is 76 and has biked across the US not once but THREE times...he brought us Mardi Gras beads from New Orleans.  After our tour talk which was a combination of laughter and panic (there are some very anal folks here...not just me..), the staff went out and chalked up the road...everyone was putting pep talk type verbage on the ground with some sarcasm written in like "SLippery when wet" or "Did you forget to turn the iron off?" So much for pep talk  Had a quick couple of beers with Tauna, Kira, Lisa, James, Ryan, and Alis at a local college watering hole called Flowers on the corner of NE 43rd St and University NE...great beers on tap and you can watch yourself drink them by looking at the mirrored ceiling...  It is now after midnight and I am exhausted..have to be up in about 6-1/2 hours for a short 76 mile ride...did I mention mountains? We have a 4000 ft elevation on Monday...oh joy

      Today we actually got to take the router car off the trailer and do something with it...as in drive it. We all went into Seattle and veered off in different directions as if we really knew what the hell we were doing. I did get to urinate along my first highway in Washington state which I am quite proud of. We picked up Paul, one of the routers from last year, at the airport in Seattle and we went on our way to do the first two days of routing after a quick stop at the Univ. of WA. Beautiful campus. We will be leaving their along a bike path to Gasworks Park on Sunday AM for the tire dipping ceremony in the Pacific Ocean (actually Pugeot (sp?) Sound)..then off to breakfast sponsored by a local church (hopefully my head won't explode if I walk in there) then off on a 76 mile journey to Skykomish, WA.  Keith, Paul and I started out and realized that this job is hard work especially when there are bike paths involved. To put it simply...not only do we have to tell the riders where to go but also figure out how to get big ass yellow trucks and support vans around to assist those riders while they are on the path. It took us 4 hours just to get out of the friggin city. We did get to stop at a really great Seafood joint along the coast called Ivans Salmon House (401 NE Northlake Way, Seattle) for some great Salmon...supposedly this place is famous..at least I think it is since the tour buses were stopping here.  After partaking in the local cuisine, we took off to do about 250 miles of driving today at an average of 10 mph (at least that what it felt like). We put more yellow arrows on the ground then I care to count and sparyed the inside of the rental car yellow not once but twice...good thing we have gray spray paint to cover it up.  The views are awesome which hopefully some of the pictures show but hope to capture some more while we actually do this ride so I won't go into it now because its almost midnight and I am exhausted. One place, Leavenworth, WA is like a small German village..can't wait for the beer and brats..  We left Skykomish and proceeded to Wenatchee which is the end of Day 2...we actually get to stay in a hotel tonight (no tents..living large at the Red Lion Hotel - 1225 N Wenatchee Avenue). We got into town and looked for a laundrymat but at 9pm this places closes down. We pleaded with the lady running the place to let us do a couple of loads and she finally caved in (tried to bribe her with food and drink but she let us finish anyway..she had a cool dog that she yelled at every 5 minutes because it kept going outside..perhaps if she closed the door...hmmm..thinking outside the box here in Wenatchee is a challenge for some folks). We stayed and completed our router sheets which is like writing for a 2 year old on how to follow simple directions..but I am told people still get lost. We then grabbed some chow at Bob's Classic Diner in downtown which was the only place open at 10:30pm. After some tasty steaks and salads we are now back to enjoy a mattress for perhaps the only time on this trip. The other folks are staying in a dorm on the Univ. of WA campus.   Getting up at 7am to drive back...we have to actually bike the 20 mile bike path before Sunday AM...and I am supposed to enjoy a beer when?? Seriously, this job is quite challenging and hopefully rewarding..looking forward to and AC and bed tonight..sweet dreams

      Guess what…I am driving in a van again…yes I know…totally out of the norm this week. Woke up in what felt like 40 degrees outside..actually got into the sleeping bag for a change. I won the battle with my rainfly as I think it is succumbing to my greater intellect and superb outdoor skills (and the fact that I got it drunk last night)  We left Bozeman around 8am and took our lovely home away from home…Interstate 90..out of town heading west of course. We drove past the Continental Divide at 6397 ft somewhere in the middle of Montana. We made the required gas stops every two hours like clockwork using our time wisely to partkae in the festivities of whatever gas/convieniece store we happen to be in front of. So far the only exercise we have gotten today is the 10 yard dash to the bathroom which can get quite violent thanks to a breakfast consisting of 1 liter of mountain dew and a bag of cajun beef jerky (who the hell needs coffee)  One thing about riding in a van with a bunch of folks you have only met last week is that one really gets to partake in almost every variation of music you can think of. Think of it as a melting pot of tunes of some sorts. DJ’s would have a really hard time trying to meld all of this together. So far we have gone from Folk to Blues to Classical and the day is only half over. Just got done listening to a few John Denver hits and somehow being in the mountains it fits…almost entered John Denver hell but now we have some sort of Spanish/French/Spanglish music on where it appears that the music is about sex, marijuana, and masterbation…somehow it all relates.   The scenery along the road is awesome…mountains everywhere with small ranch houses sotting the countryside. The hills are winding and rolling making the vans and trailers sway all over the place…makes typing along the road quite interesting. The CB occasionally squaks with someone from the other van or truck trying to figure out where everyone else is or simply making some crude gestures. (Yes..its usually me). We recently entered Idaho and took a few minutes of course to make comments on how everyone is a “Ho”…get it…please don’t make me explain. We are on our way to Coeur d’Alene (took 3 of us to figure out to spell it) to stop for lunch.  We completed our wonderful lunch spot where I got the chance to consume a fabulous bean and beef wih cheese grilled flatbread surprise with a wonderful thirst quenching lemon flavored beverage at the unique Bell of the Southwest area (Grilled Stuffed Burrito and Lemonade at Taco Bell), its on the road again for the last 200 miles or so of the day. As we were leaving I get stopped by a woman who is planning a protest of President Bush’s visit to the Spokane, WA area and wanted us to see if we would join them. Did I mention she was from Planned Parenthood. I mean…is it me? Do I seem to attract these people? How I wanted to provide a few select comments to tell her about all the lovely signs I had to endure on the highway for the last 500 miles…but I am sure that Cycle america would not like receiving a phone call regarding their tour router who just so happened to get arrested in Idaho for telling them where they can hang their protest signs.   Crossing into WA, I thought this would be really nice however quite the opposite. The scenery is all flat here (at least as of right now). The mountains are gone and left with flat roads where they close every other lane every other mile. At least they have free coffee at the rest stops. Just finished my driving stint in the big ol’ truck and now am the passenger with Peter at the helm. Peter is performing proudly and is persistently protecting the provisions. (Sorry..not much else to do on a 600+ mile drive)  Most of us have concluded that if we don’t get in a ride soon and stop eating along the way that our fat asses aren’t going anywhere except to the nearest restaurant or fat farm. Tomorrow is the big day as we have to unpack everything we have packed to get ready for the guests to arrive Saturday. Oh joy….unpacking…woohoo…  Went for a ride late afternoon and about killed myself on the hill stretch…spent the rest of the night checking out the awesome river and actually attempting to get some sleep…as Keith put it…we are going to bed in Eastern Daylight time and waking up in Pacific Time…not exactly a good way to be productive.

      Woke up this AM to rush to get our tents packed away before the rains came…gee…raining again…that’s something new. I thought I caught my rainfly snickering at me so I stuffed the son of a bitch into the bag before it had a chance to mock me. I have been eating so much with little exercise so realy didn’t have the desire for breakfast…perhaps it was the jambalaya last night. Went for a walk around the campground, Keith joined me for a bit, and we walked by this field of cows where they were partaking in their daily breakfast. It was all good until a couple of them starting getting frisky with each other and even I have not been on the road long enough to watch that kind of quality entertainment yet.  We walked over to the breakfast spot where Cowboy John was making pancakes for everyone. I kid you not, the KOA sign even advertises free pancakes. Cowboy John entertained us with poems and stories (clean ones no less) while we chomped down on the buttermilk beauties. The guy has been doing this a while as he was able to make bicycle shape pancakes along with ones with faces on them (he called it mount rushmore)…OK…when you come to Rapid City…you will find this as quality entertainment also.  I am now in the van with Tauna, Mary, Lisa, and Meryl…how I got picked to ride with 4 women I am not sure (nor complaining….yet…) however if the topics of conversation start going toward feminine hygeine products or how bad men suck…this passenger door will open and then aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh…..Peter Gabriel is on the CD player now and Mary is gunning for her Blondie CD to be played soon afterward….my Jimmy Buffett is getting vetoed….I think I am screwed.   Its kind of nice typing away while someone drives…we just entered Wyoming..cowboy country…scenery here is real beautiful..except for the roadkill…the wide spaces are quite amazing…we just drove through the Black Hills and will be driving through quite a bit of mountains today. Hope the yellow submarine (Penske truck) will make it.  Just got done with driving the big ol’ Penske truck with Keith…I like it…nothing like being 20 feet in the air looking down on your prey…I mean…other drivers. The truck is only able to do a maximum of 70 mph so preying on innocent victims seems to take a little longer. The truck whines as it launches upward when travelling through the mountains…8% grade doesn’t have anything on the big ol’ yellow truck.  Stopped in Sheridan, WY for a quick lunch stop….drove into the downtown area which is quite the interesting thing to do with a truck the size of a house (with car in tow). Took a corner onto Dow Street and I can see the woman in the little Ford Escort saying her last rites as the big yellow machine lurches down upon her and covers up the sun with its mammoth size…OK…a bit much but it was interesting. Keith, Mary, Jeremy and myself had lunch at Sanford’s Grub & Pub (1 E. Alger Street, Sheridan WY)..recommend the Thermostat…a Buffalo Cajun Burger with cheese and jalapeno’s (although Keith is probably wishing I didn’t have it..if you catch my drift)  The road is filled with teepees and mountains with some sightings of deer (live deer…not roadkill). There also seems to be quite a few abortion kills type signs throughout this area. “Since 1975, 85000 babies have been killed in Montana by abortion” Give me a break..its bad enough driving 100 miles between rest stops without a toilet in sight. Perhaps I’ll put up a road sign stating “Since 2003, 450 grown adults pissed in their pants due to a lack of offramps with facilities.” Abortion kills…yeah…so does allowing ones teeth to float too long”   We attempted to shoot some pictures while driving down the road so my efforts will hopefully be uploaded at some point. The blurry mass is probably my body being thrown from the Penske as I drive the truck with my feet to catch the shot…just kidding….I use my knee like everyone else.   Now I know I feel like I am in summer camp…Keith had to ask permission to pull the Penske off the road into the rest stop to..how shall we say…go tinkle. Mary asked him to hold it but to no avail….hey…you gotta go…you gotta go…the world is our toilet. So right now, we are playing catch up…If anyone reading this has a problem with that..then please reread the statement a couple of paragraphs up.  We arrived at the Sunrise Campground (Exit 309, off I-90…31842 Frontage Road, Bozeman, MT 59715) in Bozeman, MT and walked about a mile into downtown. Bozeman is actually a really cool place. We had dinner at a wonderful local pizza joint where they served Moose Drool Ale and walked back in the friggin cold and of course yours truly is wearing shorts. The owners of the campground, Mary Jo and Marty Stanek are super nice…I told them what I was doing with this whole website thing and they left me a phone line outside to plug into. Arrived back at about 10:30pm and they were still up so they invited me inside out of the cold…what great folks so I am plugging their campground. Come by and see it…they have free modem service.

      Finally after a week of painting, cleaning, labeling, as well as eating at all of the love three downtown restaurants, we are finally leaving Cannon Falls. (Although we will be back thru here…) I hope to make it back in time for the Friday night Meat Raffle at the VFW.  Broke camp about 6:30am this morning…waking up in the cool morning air and wiping down one’s tent because of all the dew is a great way to get going in the AM. Everybody’s tent is quite moist (shall we say..without a chuckle please). We packed up and met at the office downtown before taking off. Keith, Alis, Kira, Lisa, and myself took bets as to what time we were actually going to leave since the powers that be were adamant about being on time at 7:45am. I selected 8:10am as the takeoff time and was only off by 4 minutes (8:14am)….should have taken the over/under and the points…could have had $5. I think Keith may have been the winner at 8:25am but we may have to discuss that.  Anyway, I am sitting in the van typing away as there is not much else to do while driving through southern MN and SD (that’s Minnesota and South Dakota for you folks that flunked Geography). My computer is plugged into the cigarette lighter (thumbs up for technology). Definitely going to increase my knowledge of music this trip as we are going through everybody’s CD collection to come up with the correct repetoire. We have been alternating drivers every 2 hours so the time has actually gone by pretty fast and we all have some nice leg room and can stretch out on the van seats…if only the dang thing could fly.  But then again, what fun would that be…so far the trip included several stops for gas and bathroom breaks which I feel I do not need to go into details (but if you are really curious..call me…you sickos). We made it as far as lovely Kimball, SD where during our pit stop, we noticed that the trailer carrying the car is losing air in one of the tires. So our stop lasted a bit longer as the lovely BP station in town took care of us in pretty quick fashion I must say. This of course gave us ample time to explore the Doo Wah Ditty Diner and Route 66 gas station..two must-sees in this wonderful world we live in. I am thinking of changing careers as the sign in the window read “Great Attitude – Apply within”….that can only be a good thing right?  Last night we each got some per diem cash ($150) and a bag of stuff for the staff..complete with bright yellow staff T-shirts. I am wearing one now which may not have been a great idea. As I am entering the Doo Wah Ditty, I realize that these shirts stand out like a beacon screaming at folks to look at you because they think the sun is moving closer. I don’t think folks here know the color yellow and perhaps it is something they should shoot, eat, or pick out of the ground. The folks in the diner are wearing the three primary colors…plaid, brown, and grease….so leave it to the boy from Florida to waltz in and say howdy in his bright yellow Cycle America staff shirt. On my way out I picked up a brochure for the Spam Museum in Austin, MN…I have not seen this place but the fact that there is one means I live in the right country..to think there is a proprietor out there dedicating his life to preserving the natural history of processed canned meat (with that jelly stuff of course)  We arrived at the lovely KOA campground in Rapid City, SD about 6pm or so. After about 8+ hours of driving, hunger set in..or perhaps a simple need to go do something instead of watch grass grow. (Where is that Spam Museum when you need it). We set up our tents and I soon realized that my rain fly and I are not going to see eye to eye on this trip. Never before have I cussed out a material but I am going to do it on this trip.  We drove into downtown Rapid City where the buildings along Main Street look like backdrops from an old movie set. The Hotel Alex Johnson is located here from which I am told by James (excuse me..”The James”) was in the movie North by Northwest. I will have to take his word for it but I am assuming it didn’t have any belching or car chase scenes in it so I probably missed it. We had dinner at the FireHouse Brewing Company (610 Main Street, Rapid City, SD) and it was kick ass. I highly recommend the stout and jambalaya but everyone was quite pleased after an afternoon of eating peanuts and other packaged food products.  We crashed back at the campground later that night to the lovely sounds of the passing car traffic. I did see a deer last night…probably looking for my peanuts…

      So here we are once again…right now everyone is doing the laundry, shower, packing, smelling of clothing to see if it needs laundry routine. We have finally packed all of the trucks, labeled all of the bins, unconnected and reconnected the trailers at least 20 times, and positioned our bikes in the bike trailers. We will have quite the convoy pulling out at 7:45am tomorrow AM. Two 15 passenger vans and one very large Penske Truck with a car trailer. I think the other van and Penske truck are also going but are going to CO for another bike event where crazy fools like myself give up part of their summer to make veins in their neck pop because they like to challenge themselves to the fullest. Couch potatoes…please do not try this at home…  It has actually been exteremely nice weather throughout the last 2 days here which I am afraid to type this out loud as a friggin storm surge may come through tonight. Actually got in 2 bike rides..the first was yesterday along Route 85 just outside of where the storage sheds are located which is where I have been spending most of my days. Went with Keith and we did about 20 miles along this stretch…I have better whip myself into shape because these hills are going to kill me and this isn’t even close to what is coming up in the next few weeks. I was pretty dehydrated from the day of moving stuff and standing around doing a 2 hour job in just under 6 hours (that is a whole other story)…so I stopped in this bar before biking back to have them fill my water bottle. Bartender was real nice and even put ice in it for me…gotta love those midwestern folk…sitting in this small hole in the wall bar in the middle of nowhere drinking beer on a Sunday afternoon…hmmm…perhaps me and my corporate world has it all wrong.  Last night was fairly uneventful as we grabbed some dinner at the lovely Country Kitchen to attempt to get something in the form of a salad…after eating cheese and bread most of the week..some ruffage sounded pretty good. The salads were not half bad…little ketchup pretty much hides any attempt at flavor…they had a milk special where you could get a free glass of milk with certain orders…never in my life have I heard of milk specials…I can see Bessie the cow out back smoking a cigarette just waiting to squirt out some fresh milk at the instant a paying customer partakes in this wonderful special….OK..I thought it was funny.  Woke up early enough to go on another bike ride with Lisa along route 19 toward Red Wing…some very beautiful roads..lots of winding turns and hills including one downhill where I got up to 31mph…pretty interesting on a bike (I want to break at least 40 though)…I say it was beautiful until of course we have to turn around into the wind and then it becomes the ultimate painful death. To give you an understanding of a 6% incline…take your bottom lip..pull it straight forward and then lift it entirely over your head…OK..perhaps a little dramatic…  We had dinner tonight at a Chinese food restaurant near the Cannon Falls Mall (yes…even Cannon Falls has a mall)..I believe this completes the culinary cuisine here in the greater Cannon Falls Area…we had Indian, Mexican, Thai, and Chinese….and Pepto Bismol for dessert.  Sitting here for the last night in the lovely Cannon Falls campground laundry room with Keith and Lisa to avoid the mosquitos or as I like to call them attack dogs with wings..I am waiting for one to simply grab my shirt and rough me over (just don’t take my bike)..the laundry room has a lovely scent of detergent and Skin so soft bug spray…with a hint of Chinese food…oh wait…sorry…that was me.    Well, the spin cycle is about over…more to come

      Sunny…yes it was sunny all day today…no clouds…no rain…no puddles to suck out of my tent..beautiful day to say the least. Had a decent night sleep except for the big ol’ spider that woke me up this AM…Dang thing was pretty big…I think it was reading one of my magazines and trying on my clothes (perhaps had a date..).  This campgroud however more than quadrupled in population overnight…from about 30 people to at least 300…unreal…there were more kids in the pool than there was water to support them. The nearby campsites had the lovely remnants of old beer cans, drenched out fires and something that may resemble a hotdog at one point in its lifespan…  Went to our wonderful home away from home..the storage lot for our daily assignments..while most of the others had to wash trailers and the contents within them. Keith and I went with Paul, a Cycle America veteran to attempt a trial day as a router. We drove to nearby Northfield. MN where one of our actual riding days will begin sometime in July. Our destination was Pepin, WI about 74 miles away. This router job is going to be interesting as we are supposed to drive the actual cycling route and if this route goes on an actual bike path, then we are to take out our bikes and ride the route…then ride back and continue in the car. No one told me that coordination would have to be achieved with this….How do they expect me to ride, drive, paint, and partake in a beverage along the way? (Perhaps one of those beer hats…hmmm)  We drove along the route following last years tour sheets…stopping every 3-5 miles to mark the road with yellow spray paint…who knew there is a technique for spraying arrows on the ground…but there is…must have slept through the class but anyways..it got a bit interesting as in order to do this properly, it sometimes requires driving the car on the shoulder to allow you to open the drivers door and paint along the shoulder of the road…works great…if there IS a shoulder…there was one point where I had to get out and spray paint in front of this bikers house…this 300 lb biker asks what is going on…somehow telling him that I am spraying hazardous chemicals nearby his Harley to assist with a bike trip does not satisfy his curiosity…lets just say that the Ford Taurus does have some nice pickup…we stopped by a nearby Walmart to try and find a paint spray can spray gun but instead decided we needed to pimp our ride..so we bought a really cool tree frog steering wheel cover and an 8 ball attenna ornament…like I said earlier…there are times I feel like this is adult summer camp…but it will definitely bring some laughs when the people arrive and that is what its all about.  We continued this throughout the day..marking our territory like horny cats on the rampage..arriving at a high school in Pepin, WI…population less than 1000..I think the elevation is higher than the population come to think of it. The scenery along the way was quite nice as we hugged the Mississippi River for some of the route…will be nice to see it again in a month. I think Keith and I feel we got a great job position…at least we got out of washing vans…  We arrived back about 5pm to be taken out to dinner by the Cycle America company..Mexican food buffet style…great food but I am afraid to go into my tent as well as near others for fear of hot air rising if you catch my drift…so I am sitting outside here on a nearby picnic table watching onlookers look at this crazed fool typing away on a laptop at 11:30pm…perhaps I am giving back to the community by allowing a topic of conversation in the nearby campsites. After our dinner, we went to Brewsters for a few beers and some lively conversation…they have a great local brew called Shells Dark and serve it in 25 oz glasses…so after 50 oz. of beer in the ol’ belly..it was time to head back  Tonight here at the lovely campground they had a band playing in the Great Hall…along with a 50’s dance of some sorts…actually it was kind of cute seeing the little kids in their poodle skirts jumping around. Kira, Alis, Keith, and Tauna shook their stuff (along with my white boy two left feet ass) to the lovely tunes of the Nitty Gritty Band (or whatever they were called..forgive me its late…I’ll find out later). It was a nice night singing to 80’s music and attempting to dance to it as well. There were people actually dropping to the floor and throwing their legs in the air kicking them around like they were trying to get a snake out of their pants during the …oh crap..what is the name of that surfer song? The one with the drum solo in the beginning…c’mon…you know the one….told you it was late and I am tired…but I have never seen someone do this…must be a Minnesotan thing  Did my first load of wash (yes…I know you are thrilled to know this)…you definitely get an appreciation for clean under garments after a few days outdoors in a moist tent (moist from the rain..gutter brain) and now am about to upload some more pics…looking forward to leaving this upcoming Tuesday to finally get started on this thing.

      Weather forecast called for rain and a potential tornado warning and guess what...it was sunny..for about 5 hours anyway and then a downpour. Definitely not in the tropics anymore.  Today was spent driving...and driving..and driving...never before had I seen a process to pick up two rental vans and a car...Keith (Prince), Derek, Mary, and I drove to Minneapolis to pick up what has to be one of the largest Penske trucks I have seen...bigger than my condo...which isn't saying much but anyways...Derek took one of the trucks and left and Keith drove the other one on our way to get the rental car...of course Mary gets us going in circles making the bright yellow truck drive all over the road. After picking up the car, each of us in separate vehicles now, we drive back to basecamp. Mary decides to drive across 3 lanes of traffic to make a turn...us Florida boys (Keith and I)..try to react at the last minute. I have to go straight because I simply cannot get over in time...Keith pulls a move that would only be acceptable in Florida to get over. I have no idea where they went and the turnaround point on the highway is 3 miles up. So I find myself alone on Highway 52...managed to make it back OK after a few missed turns.  We get back only to turn around and head back in the exact same direction (told you it didn't make sense)..we went to REI which is a big ol' outdoor overpriced sporting goods store where we picked up things that should have been packed in our bags in the first place. We went out to dinner at a good Thai place which actually covered up the stench from Mary's sandals which was making our eyes water since we left basecamp.  The campground we are staying at has doubled in population since we got here. Looks like Minnesota folk come to campgrounds during the weekend...sitting around the fire, cooking smores, drinking beer and burping folk songs..we will see how long before someone stumbles into our tents.  Its 12:30am now..going to bed..BTW...I have some pictures uploaded which can be checked out via the pictures link on my website..keep checking back..

      I am going to try something different to see if this is a better solution so new posts will be posted under this title. I am simply going to edit it and keep a running tab with new dates etc. This may clean things up a little or not...so basically same as always except you will just keep going back to this same log and read more as time goes on...OK...enough techno talk...on with the show.  It actually did NOT rain last night and I think I managed to get a whopping 6 hours sleep last night (after the Depth charge coffee wore off)..today was spent doing fun filled people skills including painting road signs and labeling water jugs...something my college education could not prepare me for..actually the organizational layout for simple water jugs was not what I expected. Each stop color coordinated with a certain amount of water jugs specifically assigned to that task..never before have I seen such precision put into a simple water jug task...make em' drink from the puddles I say..  We went to lunch after our morning meetings at a really cool cafe..food was great...service was fair..I keep forgetting that out here in the middle of nowhere..folks don't move as fast as back in FL...it is not necessarily a bad thing of course until YOU need to move YOUR ass...  We drove the van WITH the trailer today on the highway..tell you what...having a V10 engine in a van kicks ass...wonder if my Nissan Altima can handle it...OK..I'll be honest...I'm getting bored...want to start riding NOW..  Tonight we went to dinner at an Indian restaurant called Chapati (212 Division St, Northfield MN..again..if you want to check it out)..10 of us sitting around eating spicy Indian food with curry, bread, chutney, and the like was an awesome sight. We rubbed our bellies out the door and proceeded on a walk around Northfield. We went by the river where it was just about to crest over the bank into the town due to all the rain. We sat and watched logs roll down the small waterfall and get caught in the current smashing back into the falls...the whole town was watching this...like its a made for TV movie or something...actually oohing and aahing as the log(s) rolled around in the surf...perhaps I wasn't drinking enough beer or something but it was kind of a refreshing evening.  Got back and I am here sitting in the laundry room of the campground typing away about my exciting adventure..they have a phone line in here so as I get a massage on my rear from the washer machine I can tttttttttttttt (sorry..just kicked into the spin cycle...oh baby) throw in a load of wash..how convienient. Acutally this is a good quiet area at this hour..you know..to wind down from the day of watching logs..  I haven't introduced the staff to everyone so please allow me to do so..and since I am working with these people for 3 months..I will be nice..actually these people do seem great (so far..then again..who knows what they say about me)  In no particular order (and I may screw up a few details...sue me)  Tauna - introduced her already as she thought I was a stalker..from Oregon..was just in here a little while ago as we were talking about this whole blog thing so since she is having her friends read this (Hi..her friends)..better be nice about everything Kira - from North Carolina..actually lived in Ft Lauderdale for a while around the corner from my current place (assuming it is still there) Keith - from Hallandale Beach, FL - the other router along with me. Has the first nickname of the trip which is "Prince" since he has seemed to capture the essence of the spoiled princess with the comment "Its so buggy out"..so Kira started calling him that and now it stuck Alis - our massage therapist from Seattle - will surely make some friends on this trip James - from NYC area - left at 4am this AM to fly to Ohio to drive a truck purchased by the Cycle America company back here for this tour...doesn't make sense to me either Lisa - from Cali - I think she is the youngest of the group (might be James) - we talked about our first concert at a bar last night with everyone and hers was the Warped Tour which made my 34 year old body and 75 year old liver feel older than usual Ryan - from WI Peter - from PA - both Ryan and Peter have been getting up at the crack of dawn to go riding..(they are the only ones with their bikes put together right now)..rain or otherwise..in fact Peter actually rode to MN from Pennsylvania..yes I am NOT kidding..the guy is a bike riding nut and I am sure will put most of us to shame Jeremy and Mary - our tour leaders from Cali area - just got engaged and it was very refreshing that Mary finds the whole "pull my finger" joke quite amusing...you got yourself a winner Jeremy.. Derek and Paul (can't remember their hometowns) also are helping us out with the day to day routines. Paul is taking myself and Keith to show us our routing duties on Saturday (finally)  Now you know everyone (whether you wanted to or not)..will write more soon

       July 31 2004 - Decided to route day - Plymouth to Manitowoc, WI (39 miles)     Actually managed to get a half decent night sleep for a change as I managed to find a comfy couch in an unlocked office in the high school we were staying last night. Felt so good to actually have real cushions underneath my body. Unfortunately my looking forward to a nice short ride day this morning was not to be. It has been raining all day so far. Rather than subject myself to the rain, I have decided to not make myself sick and went routing with Keith. It is a short route as we are taking the ferry over to Ludington Michigan tomorrow. One of the riders, Huck..yes..Huck, went with us. Huck's real name is Stanley and he is an English professor at the University of Vermont. He told us he got his nickname because he would always be walking around barefoot and drunk. A friend of his was reading Huckleberry Finn at the time and the name stuck. Anyway, Huck had a pretty bad fall the other day and ended up getting scraped up as well as breaking a bone in his hand. So, he came with us and we dropped him off in Manitowoc to get a cast put on it.  Not much going on so far here in Manitowoc. The drive over was nice except for the smell of manure. We did see some baby calves along the way which makes you not want to order veal anytime soon. The day has just been dreary and wet. We finished up the route early and Huck treated Keith and I to lunch at this local diner while we waited to get an oil and air filter change on the car. The air filter must have been covered up with all this soot and dirt which could only be obtained from off roading. Who could have done that?? Hmmm....I wonder....  We have some time to kill so once again I found a library but once again I cannot upload pictures. Damn governmental conspiracy I say. This town is nice as it seems to date back to the early 1900's. You would think that a place like this on Lake Michigan would have more waterfront property but I suppose that is just in Florida. Its a bit better this way but I am looking forward to the boat ride tomorrow...just hope for no rain.  Gonna run for now...more to come

       July 29, 2004 - Router Day - Waupun to Plymouth, WI (58 miles)   I was actually worried a bit this morning since this route has never been done before. I certainly did not want a repeat of a couple of days ago. I was already in a somewhat grumpy tired state since the gym we slept in last night in Baraboo, WI was about the size of a large cardboard box. Nothing like snoring in stereo at close range. I had to kick someones feet last night because of their snoring. Earplugs only do so much..then again..a pillow over their face would do even better...but I hear they have laws against that.  Waupun, WI..a town where I still have a hard time pronouncing. The high school here is really nice...and huge. This place is a maze. Folks are inside the theater (yes...theater) watching the movie Cold Mountain. I am amazed that some of these bicyclists can sit in a movie that does not involve bicycles. Perhaps there was a messenger that rode his bike across the battlefield and gets shot or something.  Started the route onto the back country roads I have grown to love and lament over so much. We will be riding into the Kettle Moraine State Forest tomorrow. This place looks nice from a car so I am hoping it is just as nice on a bike. I am looking forward to the watering hole (swimming hole...not drinking establishment) that I found for us to use as our picnic stop. Its a huge lake surrounded by picnic tables and open fields along with some trails that lead to who knows where. If it stops raining..it should be a nice ride. Of course it starts raining 15 seconds after I get my bike out of the trailer.  Tonight its about laundry which is desperately needing to be done as my bike shorts are standing on edge making me do the same. Finally got a chance to shave as well which after 6 days of growth makes me appear that go from 50 to 34. Speaking of age..its hard to believe I will be the big "35" on Monday...damn...lost that bet. I think back at the...lets just say creative instead of stupid..things I have done and think to myself...did I do that??  Well...laundry calls...

       Day 37 - July 26 2004 - Northfield, MN to Pepin, WI (73 miles)    First let me start off by apologizing to my fans for my lack of pictures but it turns out that every library in the country has a double secret password security system that prohibits vagrants like myself from uploading pictures onto the computer and internet. So I have not forgotten as I have some great shots to share..guess I will just have to bribe one of the old ladies here in WI to let me do it (or perhaps steal her teeth)   Anyway, the ride today was really nice. It was really strange to be biking through Cannon Falls again after spending a week here at the beginning of this trip. Lots of...well...lets just say memories..some good..some...could be worse...We had to bike for our breakfast so we took off and hit some back country roads until we hit Cannon Falls where we had breakfast at one of the three places in town to do so, The StoneMill restaurant. Some of the Cycle America office staff (since there headquarters is there) joined us. We then took off on a nice leisurely day (anything less than 75 miles becomes a leisurely day..scary huh?) We stopped in Red Wing MN for our picnic stop and biked around town for a bit then biked into WI where myself, Dublin Matt, Jane and Colleen posed for pictures by the welcome to WI sign. After our tourist ordeal, we rode Highway 35 along the coast of Lake Pepin. Absolutely beautiful. We stopped at a small cafe called the Bogus Creek Cafe in Stockholm, WI (population 97). This place was really nice and made awesome pie..but all I wanted was a cold beer (naturally). We rode the rolling hills into camp where we proceeded to get into a volleyball game and then a cricket game. This was a blast as it became somewhat competitive although not so much so due to some limited talents on both sides. I think we hit the tents with the balls more than made the shots we wanted. Cricket is an interesting sport which we played with a makeshift bat that Dublin Matt made from a two by four and then we used a tennis ball along with it. Surpirsingly we have some players that could most likely make the National retarded Cricket league with enough practice. It was a nice break from cycling but of course we all needed another shower before bed. Needless to say, our muscles were sore in the AM.   Day 38 - July 27 2004 - Router Day from Sparta WI to Baraboo WI (80+ miles)   This day started out so nice but turned into a friggin nightmare. Sometimes I do not know why I take this job so seriously but I do. Today I had Kira come with me so she could ride the bike path we were doing while I went on routing the rest of the course. The morning started out really nice as we had to stop so I could get a picture of Kira near the school mascot (the Trojan man) looking up his shorts...priceless.  We were routing the Sparta-Elroy Trail which is 34 miles so I dropped Kira off and then left myself to head east. THis course has never been done before and had limited information. THis was my first reason for being upset as I had requested it before. Anyway, turns out that this day was a huge rush since many roads were under construction and it took Kira at least 1-1/2 hours longer than we both thought because there were tunnels on this trail that had to be walked through. Kira got done but I had already travelled 30 miles away and had to finish up as it was now approaching 4pm. I spray painted the hell out of these County roads and then drove like a bat out of hell back to get Kira. I was so pissed off but luckily I calmed a bit when I got back. Had a long talk with Mary and then finished up the day's routing. Nothing like driving 350 miles in a day and then having to find a Piggly Wiggly as this is the only place at 7pm with a copy machine. I felt so bad about the way I talked to Mary that I went back and apologized. I am so impressed that she can just take people's crap&nbsp;and let it flow off...perhaps something I need to work on.  Luckily it all turned out good. Since I missed dinner (and lunch), I went out to eat with Kira, Dublin Matt and Keith to a really good sandwich shop and stuffed my face. I crashed so hard last night..this time I slept under the table in the gym...don't ask...it felt like I had a roof over my head.   Day 39 - July 28 2004 - Sparta to Baraboo WI (80+ miles)   First thing I want to know is who the hell comes up with the names of these places. Anyway..today's ride made up for the crap from yesterday. The Elroy-Sparta Trail went through three of the coolest tunnels I have seen to date. THese old tunnels were constructed in the late 1800's. The trail is mostly crushed limestone and the tunnels have these huge wooden doors on them that they close during the winter. The tunnels range from 1/2 to 3/4 miles long each and are pitch black inside. You have to get off your bike and walk which we did but not without making a few "Boogey-Boogey-Boogey" type scary noises throughout. Really enjoyed going across these small towns with populations less than100.   At the picnic stop, I set up an option that folks could either continue on another trail called the "400 Trail" which was about 22 miles or go up a few different county roads which would be about 29-30 miles. I chose the bike path as I already drove the road yesterday and wanted to see something new. No tunnels on this trial unfortunately but a really nice trail nonetheless. The towns you ride through were once stops on this railroad back in the late 1800's. One town, Lavalle, still had their original sign hanging by the trail. Occasionally a whiff of manure would mix in with the trees and flowers (this is after all..the Dairy state) but you hold your breath and move on.  The ride finished up through the town of Reedsburg and took some really nice back country roads around the town. We hit some climbs today and&nbsp;my poor legs almost forgot what those were. One climb had to have a grade of over 15% which means going 15 vertical feet for every 100 horizontal feet. I thought I heard my legs screaming at me...but it turns out it was me screaming at them. We both made it and just found a library here in Baraboo (boo..boo...boo). I am looking forward to getting back to a nice gym floor (what am I saying???)  &nbsp;

       July 25-26 2004 - Northfield MN (oh no..near Cannon Falls again)   At least the weather is nice and not raining like it was before. We hit a really cool English Pub last night called "The Contented Cow" which I have no idea what that has to do with the English. It sits right near the river which only about 1-1/2 months ago was overflowing over the banks. Its hard to believe we are starting on week 6 already. The beer flowed well but the body still insisted that it go to bed by 11pm.  Today started out pretty well. I found a nice dark corner to actually sleep in up in the mezzanine corridor of the gym.&nbsp;I managed a solid 7-1/2 hours of sleep before getting woken up by one of the riders whio insists on talking on his cellphone and does not realize that sound travels. Anyway since I was up, I stumbled outside to a nice day but soon realized that it was jug washing time again (I just love saying "jugs"...uh...never mind). Thankfully that did not take that much time and Keith and I went into town to grab some Shepherds pie for lunch at the same pub we went to last night. We burped our way back to the school and waited for Paul to show up to go over our routes for next week. See...the thing here is this...we have to put together routes that have not yet been routed. In other words, wing it...oh...and we have 2 days notice to do so. SO basically Keith and I figure out the best way to do this is close our eyes and just point to the map. If our finger touches a road, then that's what we use. If not, then we ask for directions.  Matt fromDublin taught me how to play cricket today and even fashioned a bat out of a piece of 2x4. We took turns pitching and hitting a tennis ball around the parking lot and bouncing a few off of the Penske. Its harder than it looks as you are combining a baseball swing with a golf like swing. I pitched a few and probablywill have a sore shoulder tomorrow but it was quite interesting...perhaps I missed my calling.   We just finished up an awesome dinner at Chapati's, an Indian restaurant here in town. The food was just as good as it was the first week we were here for training. So now I am sitting in the coffee shop across the street probably having curry come out of pores and thinking that a coffee at this time is most likely not the best thing. Hmm...caffiene and curry...good combination?   We have our tour meeting in a few minutes down the street. We have a lot of new riders this week so we are up to 54 riders for this week and we have to break them in...or perhaps just break them.  Till next time

       July 23 2004 - Watertown to Hutchinson, MN (84 miles)    &nbsp; Today the day was about one word...wind..and it was not in our favor most of the day..OK..all of the day. The route led through more cornfields than I know what to do with including a nice visit through Olivia, MN which claims itself as the "Corn Capital of the world". Tell me...How does one go about getting that claim to fame? Is there a Corn Council that studies and provides information on the corn populous in the world? Inquiring minds want to know.  I actually felt really wonderful during the ride which of course makes me nervous. If I am feeling good then I must be about to crash (not literally..but tire out). It never happened which I am quite pleased. The weather turned absolutely amazing these last two days..from 90's with humidity to 70's with none. Actually was a bit chilly this morning. Hutchinson's claim to fame was that they were noted as the mosquito capital which is not exactly the claim to fame I want for my town. Luckily the cool weather kept them away...or was it the beers?  Speaking of which, Alan (the Aussie) is leaving us tomorrow. Some folks brought him going away presents and then a bunch of us went out for beers although Alan left really early so we celebrated in prime fashion without him. Somehow, biking 80+ miles makes one crave french fries and onion rings so while partaking in that, Molly, Marrissa, Kira, Jeremy, Peter, Brian, and Meg all stuck around while Molly led us in a game of "I Never" which is sort of like Truth or Dare except one has to ask questions and see who did what. It was quite interesting learning about people. But of course...I was an angel (OK..stop laughing). Like I said...this experience is part quest and part summer camp. At least we weren't singing. Then it was back to the gym floor for bed at about 10pm.  Oh..almost forgot. I did my "stupid move of the day, part two". I was attempting to put my bike in the trailer when a gust of wind came and pushed the door into my bike which was conviently being held up by me in front of my face so now I have a nice little cut on my forehead. Just another reminder about this trip to take with me for a while.   July 24 2004 - Router Day - Northfield, MN to Pepin, WI (72 miles)   This was the route that Keith and I were trained on when we spent that glorious week in Cannon Falls, MN at the start of the trip. Therefore, it was nice to see the marks remaining on the road after all this time. Just a few touch up arrows. This is going to be a nice trip as long as the wind coorperates. We go through the town of Red Wing, MN where the Red Wing Shoe and pottery&nbsp;companies are located. On my way back from Pepin, I grabbed lunch with Paul who led us on the tour in the begginning. We got caught up and I filled him in on the current trials and tribulations of the trip. Didn't seem to surprise him one bit having gone through this ordeal, excuse me...experience, himself.   Rest of today was pretty laid back. Found some nice off road trails leading back into what else? Corn fields, of course. Should be getting back as Jeremy called me and wants to see if I can get back early...sort of told him I was on the road. (Hope he doesn't read this during this week) Oh well..  &nbsp;

       DeSmet to Watertown, SD (60 or so miles)    Last night I slept inside the closet. Before anyone starts making comments and thinks I have been spending a bit too much time looking at the animals..please allow me to explain. The gym we were staying at was not air conditioned. The only room that was air conditioned was the room we used for meals so therefore like most sane people would, I moved my bedding in there. To get some privacy, I slipped into one of two closets and shut the door. It was quite nice and cool until the breakfast ladies showed up at 5:00am. Of course, they were tip toeing around so as not to wake us right? Wrong! They moved on in like they were setting up for the pre-game show at the Super Bowl. Since my slumber was disturbed, I moved back onto the gym floor. Surprisingly I actually fell asleep until the movement of footsteps and farting woke me again at 6:30am.   If only all days could be like this one. The sun was a shining..the wind was a sleeping...the cows were a pooping...and the roads seemed to coorperate to allow us a really nice day on two wheels. Since it was a short day but the Cycle America Standards (basically meaning that your ass only has to hurt 1/2 as much), I started riding with Robert and Kira. It was a really nice ride as the roads were flat for pretty much the entire ride. The first water stop was about 15 miles out and set up at the Senior Citizen's home in Bryant, SD. It is a tradition to join these people for a bit of food and drink as we cycle on through. They have been doing this for the last 6 or 7 years. It was really nice and the older folks seemed to enjoy our visit (at least..what they could comprehend from it). Robert and I talked with this one woman only we could not really get any information out of her except that she believes in God which is a nice thing to say to someone you just met I'm sure. Kira talked with a guy who was upset that his 38 year old son has not given him grandchildren yet. The best story came from Matt (from Austrailia) whose newly made friend fell asleep midway through his story. Perhaps it just wasn't exciting enough for him. In any event, after eating a few tasty treats and eyeing a few medications, we hit the road.   After the picnic stop in the town of Hayti (we may make the evening edition newspaper), a number of us stopped at this lake around the 47 mile mark and went swimming. Granted, there was a little bit of algae in the water but there were living things in it like fish and turtles as well as some good ol' boys going fishing that afternoon so we figured we would not lose any body parts. It felt awesome so we stayed for an hour or so. A friend of Brian's (one of the riders) showed up with beer which made the afternoon even better...except for the getting back on the bike part.  We biked into the town of Watertown and immediately preceded over to Dempsey's, one of three microbreweries in the state of South Dakota. I knew it was trouble when we started ordering beer, jalapeno poppers and something with cheese in it. Three hours later..it was pretty much of the same. Good thing we only had about a mile to ride. We did find out that the owner of the bar plays the bagpipes but unfortunately we would not be able to see him play that day. Probably a good thing because I would not be surprised if a few of us got up and tried to sing along with him.  Tomorrow is the half way point for the trip. Group pictures were taken of the suckers...uh..I mean coast to coast people..quickly of course to avoid getting eaten by the dog sized mosquitos (or was that mosquito sized dogs...hmmm...too many beers). Anyway, the staff then immediately left to drive 40 miles to the 1/2 way point of tomorrow's ride to paint on the road. Last years paint job was still on the road but somehow crossing out the 3 and putting a 4 for the year 2004 was not an option. Cars kept whizzing by wondering what these 10 or so schmucks are doing on the side of the road at the Minnesota line with paint cans. Trying to act normal like you are peeing on the side of the road was not necessarily an option. The true fun came on the ride back when more 80's and 90's music was played from the CD's my dad sent me. The music was just as painful as our singing which made it quite enjoyable. How C&C Music Factory became popular..I'll never know.  Back at the ranch, it was one more quick bike ride at 9pm for a last beer at Dempsey's. Good thing I am routing tomorrow. Now its back at the school where I am just finishing up this blog, eating a couple of slices of pizza from the neighborhood pizza joint and drinking some luke warm water to wash it down with. Nothing says party central like here in good ol' Downtown Watertown.

       Day 30 - July 20, 2004 - DeSmet to Watertown, SD (59 miles) - Router Day   &nbsp;  Turned out this was a day I was glad not to ride as it rained pretty much the entire&nbsp;morning. I had a real hard time getting up this morning as the air conditioning was cranked to a meat locker level. It must have hit 50 degrees inside the Chorus room a few of us slept in. First time I actually slept "inside" of my sleeping bag. No complaints though as this evenings facilities include no AC inside a sweaty gym with two prop plane type fans blowing in the distance. This is perhaps my only gripe. Although I did not ride today but to complete 80+ miles into the wind and rain and then finish to a 85 degree gym just plain sucks. The room we just finished having our meals in is at least air conditioned so folks are sitting in here for the moment. I managed to find an internet connection for my laptop so I come to you live (at least for now). Thinking about sleeping in this room but the breakfast folks will be here at 4am to start cooking..hmm...comfort or sleep...a tough choice.  &nbsp;  Had some company today as both Alis and Keith joined me for today's route. Alis has decided enough is enough and is going home..for good. The three of us finished the route early as it was&nbsp;a short mileage day so we decided to catch a matinee movie. We picked "Anchorman" with Will Ferrell. Although it was amusing at times, I wouldn't stay up too late to see if it captures any Academy Awards. For the most part, the best part of the day was relaxing in an air conditioned theater for a couple of hours as the temperatures outside soared to over 90 degrees.  &nbsp;  The people here in South Dakota are (at least the ones we met) the most friendliest people around. They have been so helpful. As I introduced myself at the school we routed to today, they were all smiles and showed us around and were more than willing to open the entire facility up to us. People around here let you into traffic and even smile and say hi...amazing concept.  &nbsp; The drive was quite nice as it covers some remarkable backroads that appear to lead to nowhere. Then, just when you think you cannot stand to look at another cornstalk, there is a city...or more like a community of buildings that has incorporated itself into an organized governmental body. Nonetheless, I will be going through Hayti..not to be confused with the country whose people try to escape. Population of about 300 people which I have made the conclusion is big enough for a bowling alley yet not quite large enough for a Walmart. &nbsp; The drive itself, except for what has been said, was pretty much the same although we did pass the world's largest pheasant. My belief is that when this becomes the focal point of your town..leave. Move to Hayti..they have a nice park and a bowling alley. No pheasant needed. After dropping Alis off at the truck stop/greyhound bus/convienent store/hotel establishment, Keith and I hit a few backroads home including one that hugged around a lake and drew a few mud drops on the side of the car. We also came close to a few bees which were located inside those containers that I assume are used to get the honeycomb to make honey. Lets just say, I was glad our windows were up. A sting on the derrier is the last thing I need right now. It already stings from the bike seat. &nbsp; Looking forward to the short day tomorrow...which usually means a visit to a nearby lake for a swim.

       Pierre to Miller, SD (90 awful miles)  &nbsp; I can't begin to say how crappy this day was. The wind was 20 mph in our faces the entire day. Didn't matter which way we were turning, the wind made it miserable. No hills to relax on...just 90 miles of pedaling with no stopping when it came to the wind. Since this tour began, I have never really ridden a hard ride with anyone simply because I enjoy stopping and finding the stupid things out here in middle America. However, today was just relentless. Managed to ride with Matt from Austrailia and Richard from Colorado for about 25 miles till lunch. It was then that my body told me..."yeah, right...keep riding dumb ass" Since I never listened to my body before, I, of course, had to push. Believe I got incredibly dehydrated (called "bonking" in bicycle land) and was struggling for a while. Hit the 65 mile mark and caught up with a few other riders (Molly, Marrisa, Colin, Kevin, Matt (from Iowa)) and the 6 of us kept a pace line that somehow got us all the way into Miller. I never got so excited to see a high school before. As I walked into the school and dropped my stuff on the ground..all I could do was shake my head back and forth as I cannot believe I am doing this sometimes.  &nbsp; Although my body told me to go to sleep..once again I do not listen. Turns out our massage therapist, Alis, has decided to call it quits and head back to Seattle. Will miss her but totally understand where she is coming from since she is not making the money she thought she would because bicyclists are cheap bastards...and also want to save for things like beer and laundry. &nbsp; A bunch of us took her out to the Turtle Creek Saloon here in Miller, SD. This place was a great local hangout complete with free pool, foosball, and the owners bought us two pitchers of beer and a round of Jagermeister which was NOT what the doctor ordered. Of course, as with any bar, the TV's are tuned to OLN to watch the Tour de France coverage. Some folks stayed behind and watched the Tim Burton movie "Big Fish" on the VCR. I think we had more fun as the free popcorn will certainly give us indigestion.  &nbsp; Time to go find a nice air conditioned spot in this school since the main areas do not have none. Alis and I accidentally walked in on Jeremy and Mary in the Theater so I am certain to hear something in the AM. THis school does have a nice computer area as the other drunks...I mean folks from the bar managed to find their way back and end up here as well.  &nbsp; Going to lovely De Smet tomorrow..home to Little House on the Prairie...stay tuned

       Day 26 - July 17 2004 - Router day - Pierre to Miller SD (88 miles)   &nbsp;  I forgot to mention about our last hours in Interior, SD. After the day ended, we went over to one of the riders cabins to hang out for a while. I think we have started a new TV show called "When Riders get bored." We all sat in front of the cabin talking and having a couple of beers watching some of the riders get their haircut by other riders of their choosing. That was the first mistake as mohawks started turning up and then it became a challenge and a game. Peter got the worst of it as he simply wanted a trim but a potential oops from Alis made him consider otherwise. Check out the pictures and see what I mean. The only guy that looked good from his haircut was the rider, Ted. Trimmers should not be a part of this crews necessitiies. &nbsp; Today was simply a long day of driving flat roads. We are staying the weekend in Pierre (pronounced "Peer") South Dakota. You would think that the capital of South Dakota would be a bit more populated..perhaps more fun..maybe actually have a store open on the weekends. Turns out this is a Monday thru Friday kind of capital. Beer sales must soar on Friday.  &nbsp;  Anyway, this city hugs part of the Missouri River which probvided a nice backdrop for the pistachio colored holls on the banks of the river. This excitement lasted about 15 miles as the road and terrain suddenly changed to corn and wheat as far as the eye could see. Aside from a lot of Harley's going back and forth there was not much else. There was a huge field of windmills somewhere about 50 miles outside of Pierre that produced electricicyt for the surrounding areas. It was really a neat site and even a more surprising site to see the information board underneath it signed by FPL Energy as in Florida Power and Light. Our electric rates are rising because they are screwing around with cow buttocks out here in the middle of nowhere. &nbsp; Pulled into Miller, SD and was happy to see this thriving city has a pool and a 140 ft waterslide that I am sure my and some other sore rears will enjoy Monday night. This town also has a drive-in for its sole piece of entertainment but staying up to midnight to watch Garfield may not be in the cards.  &nbsp; We are staying two nights at The Learning Center gymnasium. All I care about is that this place was nicely air conditioned as the temperatures are scheduled to hit 99 today and tomorrow. Last night the staff went out to a really good Italian restaurant and then Kira, Keith and myself were going to go bowling while the others went to see the movie King Arthur. There movie turned out crappy so they say but our night was not much better since the bowling alley was closed for renovations. We ended up at "Pete-ez", a bar right down the street from where we are staying made entirely out of leftover metal siding. Since the beers were $2, we should not complain as we had the run of the place (there were 5 people in the bar...Matt fromAustralia (and Ireland), Kira, myself, and two others who mumbled and cackled their way thru the night. Could not understand what they were saying and neither did the bartender who cut them off.  &nbsp; Went back to the Center where a few riders were still up digesting their food and alcohol intake for the evening. One rider, Richard was determined to find a place open at midnight for a nightcap and got on his bike and took off. We were wondering if we would see him again but just before we could start rummaging through his clothing bag, he turns up with two 6 packs bought at the infamous "Kum &amp; Go". No..I am not making this name up. Nothing like sitting on the floor outside a gymnasium sucking back a cold one to make you reflect as to what the hell you are doing. &nbsp;  Day 27 - July 18 2004 - Free Day here in Pierre, SD   Thankfully, after the evenings festivities (or lack there of), got to sleep in till after 9am today. The staff had their own private room complete with laundry. Its like paradise around here when their is free laundry available. Like all Sunday's we have to clean water jugs, vans, and the like. I talked Mary into trying my experiment about washing the containers with a diluted Iodine solution instead of bleach so we would not have to rinse..hopefully saving time. Surprisingly she said OK so it appeared it may have saved us 10 minutes since we have to share the water hose with everyone else. Hopefully no one gets sick or my ass is in trouble.  This will be the smallest group week as 6 people have left and only 2 newcomers so we have about 48 people or so this week. Still enough to drive you crazy but few enough to still snag that corner of the gym before they get in.  Looks to be an easy day as I am going to finish here in the Library and then go for a walk (since my bike is in the back of the trailer on the way to the airport to pick up the two new cyclists) along the Missouri River path. Wonder if I remember how to walk. Hope I do not fall.  The caterer who was suppossed to feed us dinner and then breakfast the next AM cancelled so it looks like the staff has to serve the food tonight and tomorrow AM. Not sure what is on the menu but I am sure cold cereal will be there somewhere....just like college.

      July 16 2004 - Interior to Philip, SD (69 Miles) &nbsp; One of these days, my stomach is going to explode from all the food one eats before 7am. The body is not made for this. Eggs..bacon..muffins..pancakes..swallow it down with some OJ and you got yourself a nice 1500 calorie breakfast that can at least get you through till lunch.  &nbsp; Saw a couple of coyotes as we entered the Badlands. Nothing to chase but dirt. We moved faster than I would have liked but got to Wall about 10:30am. Walked around the tourist trap one more time and discovered that the 5 cent coffee they advertise is actually 21 cents if you want it to go. Blasphemy I tell you. I suppose you want me to tip you the 4 cents as well huh. Modern day capatilism at its best. &nbsp; The day ended with a not so wonderful ride along Route 14 into town. Although I personally have never felt better and simply took the ride at a speed I am typically not used to. Perhaps it was just a way to get over the boredom of watching grass grow. &nbsp; We ate dinner at the only place in town (The Steakhouse and Lounge). After dinner, we wandered over to the bar and watched the Tour de France on OLN. Tauna, Lynette, Matt and myself played a few competitive rounds of foosball and got in each others face as we each scored goals. Then it was back to watching Lance Armstrong pedal his way up mountains higher and longer than we have seen with such ease. Bastard.... &nbsp; Anyway..its 10pm and the beers a re starting to wear off so I suppose its time for bed. Good night...

      Day 25 - July 15 2004 - Interior to Philip, SD (68 miles) - router day  Coming to you live from Downtown Wall, South Dakota (yes..Wall)..its your ALL-American traveling man reporting to you the fantastic sites to be seen...and here are today's..  (add cricket chirping sounds here)  Yes..now that we are almost out of the Badlands..there is pretty much nothing but flat land to see. I did drive through the Badlands National Park today which was quite nice. Basically these hills look like mounds of sand that could wash away if someone poured a bucket of water on them. It is quite a nice site however. I did see a coyote or wolf cross the road most likely attempting to get a sheep on its way. Unfortunately, I cannot look at a coyote without thinking of good ol' Wile E Coyote from the cartoon days and just wondering where that road runner is (as well as that 600 lb anvil that is going to drop from the sky)  Drove through the bustling metropolis' of Quinn (population 44..was 67 last year) and Cottonwood (population 12). I am now here in Wall simply because I have been seeing signs for this "Wall Drug" store since Montana. It turns out that this place is similar to South of the Border in South Carolina. A huge bunch of shops all in one no name place selling more tourist crap than you know what to do with. Granted..they make some good ice cream but how many Harley stickers and Badlands pins can one have?  Spent some time in Philip, SD which is our stop for Friday. Philip is the home of the "Scotties" so I should feel right at home (I assume they are talking about the dogs..but hey..it makes me feel special). Grabbed lunch at the Steakhouse which is ingeniously names "The Steakhouse" and the lunch specials were Ham and Cheese or a stuffed pepper. Hmm...steakhouse huh? Now I am not a restaurant owner but shouldn't the name of the place dictate what is being served there?  I am about to hit the road back to Interior. The home of...well...dirt. We are staying at the KOA campground there which is centrally located 4 miles away from the highway. Got another Kamping Kabin (its the KOA so everything is spelled with a "K") It has rained the last couple of nights. Not a very long rain but the 15 minute spurts come complete with marble sized hail which shook the school a bit last night. The poor folks sleeping in tents yesterday were quite surprised.  Still trying for the pictures but every public computer I use will not allow me to hook up my camera so I am waiting ever so patiently to be able to use my laptop to do so. I know..I know...can't wait to see llamas and those 4 guys on a rock. Will get to it soon.  Gotta go find some dirt roads for my drive back..till next time.

       Day 24 - July 14 2004 - Custer to Rapid City, SD (68 miles)   I am sitting here in the Keystone Library just outside of the Mt Rushmore monument stinking up the place pretty good. Just got done with biking 50 miles and still have about 17 more but was hanging out with Matt from Austrailia and decided to check some email while we had the chance so here we are. We had to wait about 20 minutes for the library to reopen because they were on an ambulance call. It turns out that the head librarian is also the town's EMT. I suppose helping Mrs. Lipshitz and her ailing back is a bit more important than me downloading emails. That damn Lipshitz..always getting in my way. You can hear the emergency radio in tha background here at the library...I am waiting any minute for them to shut us down because they need to go on a run. They just said that golf ball size hail is falling...think I am staying indoors for a while. I do hope we make it to the school tonight.  The ride has been great so far. If anyone is ever in these parts I HIGHLY recommend driving (or biking) down the Needles Highway just outside of Custer, SD. Its such an awesome ride...the hills suck but the views are great. You are surrounded by granite rock and trees and go through these wonderful 1 lane tunnels which is great until your little bike goes up against a bus full of tourists.  On the ride, I encountered a herd of buffalo and then a herd of donkeys. The donkeys surrounded this van as the women inside were feeding them crackers. I got a few pictures and then they gave me some crackers to feed them. Yes...once again I am interacting with the animal kingdom..please do not insert any odd jokes here.  I did my stupid move of the day today. While we were coming to a tunnel I tried to get my foot out of the pedals as normal when I like to stop. This time the pedal had another thought and I went toppling over and cut my knee up a bit. I was hoping for a flesh wound with a bit more glory to it but ahve to settle for the dumbass move of the day.  Speaking of crazy people, this one rider David had his pedal break just before a major 2.5 mile climb. The bearings just split apart. Instead of waiting for the SAG vehicle he decides to pedal up anyway using the strength of only one pedal while trying to use the broken one. I have got to handle it to him as he made it.  As I am typing this, Matt just turned around and noticed that it is raining and hailing outside. Wonderful...and we still have 17 miles to go...wish this library served beer and food or something.  Anyway, walked around a bit in the town of Keystone. Its basically a tourist spot spawned by the Mt Rushmore crowd. Nothing but T-shirt shops and ice cream parlors. They did have an Alpine Slide ride but I figured they would not let me bike my way down it...so be it.  I better save this before the power goes out...guess I will wait out the storm...

       Day 23 - July 13 2004 - Router Day - Custer to Rapid City, SD   I have 16 minutes left to tell you about my day as I am in an Internet Cafe here in Custer SD checking on the world events, emails, and dirty pictures that awaits me. The day was nice as I spent driving about another 300 miles throughout the day trying to get people and vehicles all to one place.  We will be riding the Needles Highway which is a really nice 14 mile stretch of road that cuts through the Black Hills of South Dakota. The tunnels are all one lane and cut through the mountains but the best tunnel is the one that has a great view of Mount Rushmore. I went and saw those 4 guys on the hill today and it was an awesome sight. They have this pavillion leading up to the monument and every mother, father, grandmother, local bum, etc. is standing around trying to get the best shot followed quickly by going into the touristy gift shop and buying the same shot on a postcard.  The walk around the monument was nice but too many screaming kids bitching about the steps or how hot it is. It is a real shame that too many people in one spot can really spoil a national monument. It was still a nice site to see.  I drove through Keystone where they filmed the movie North by Northwest (of course I did not see it but it could be a useful tidbit of trivia)..I made it to Rapid City and had lunch at a local pub and decided to get a haircut since I look like I just came out of a forest. I found a local place in town and spent time talking to the lady who lived there her whole life. Really funny place stuck in time...ladies with their heads in those big headlamps getting their brain fried and talking about this Florida boy who is biking across country. I should have stayed as I may have gotten a good meal out of them.  Gotta go as they will log me out automatically...

      Day 22 - July 12, 2004 - Devils Tower to Newcastle, WY (75 miles)  Forgot to mention that last night, the campground showed the movie Close Encounters for the Third Kind to anyone who wanted to see it. A bunch of people showed up and simply grabbed nearby lawn chairs and watched the 40+ inch TV that was mounted in a weatherproof enclosure near the main office. They show this movie every night so folks can marvel at the fact that they are sleeping next to such a famous monument that Richard Dreyfus scratched against.  The ride today was quite hot but really awesome. The ride started with a 2 mile climb directly out of the campground which made the eggs and cereal I had for breakfast churn a bit too early. Luckily it did its trick and managed to stay down long enough to give me some energy for the morning. We turned onto Highway 14 and took it into the town of Sundance..not much going on at 8am so we turned onto Hwy 585S and took this country road all the way into Newcastle. Finished 75 miles in about 5 hours...please tell me I am not turning into one of the crazy riders.   It was pretty uneventful until just before the lunch stop, two llammas caught my attention. As I looked over in their direction, they began to run after me. They were located behind a fence of course but I could not stop laughing as these animals simply were infatuated with whatever it was I was doing. I tried talking to them and see if they could do any tricks but llamas are not very cooperative in that respect. I did take a great picture which I will upload when I can get a chance. I am wondering if they talked to the cows and deer that I have encountered on this trip and wanted to see a dumbass cyclist up close.  I arrived at the Senior Center at around 1:30pm. Yes..I said Senior Center. I left all the senior citizens back home to join a few here. Actually, they have been really great and are letting us have the run of the place. At about 3pm, a few riders and I walked to the Mill Tavern to enjoy a beverage of our choosing. This of course, led into two beverages of our choosing and then...well..you get the picture. More riders joined us and we had quite the little happy hour going till about 5:30pm. The outdoor network, OLN, was on and we watched the Tour de France on tape delay (what else is a group of cyclists going to watch...bullfighting?). I think a few of them are going back this evening to catch more of it.   I like this place because it actually has air conditioning..a real treat in these parts. The drawback is that there is a train going by here at least every 20 minutes that shakes the nearby buildings. I suppose property is cheap here.  Oh..thanks to all who has looked up info for me regarding my computer and the outlet connection. Folks from SSR are sending me the outlet that I need and I will owe them dearly. Hopefully now, I can stop using the car charger to provide power for my computer. Makes driving and typing at the same time a real pain.  Till next time

       Day 20 – July 9, 2004  - Buffalo to Gillette, WY (72 miles)   Not really much to say about this day except that it was kind of boring riding along the Interstate. Although the scenery was nice in a desert sort of way…after about 10 miles of seeing it…it was getting a bit old. Couple of nice roadkill along the way however.  We stayed at the middle school in Gillette and had dinner at the Golden Corral where I and every other rider pretty much cleaned house. After burning a ton of calories for the day we pretty much ate about 3 plates full. Burping and excusing ourselves on the way home.  That night a few riders and myself went to Godfather’s Pizza…not to eat but to have a few beers as this was the closest place around. Just can’t go back to Bud after drinking Moose Drool…not the same.   Day 21 – July 10, 2004 – Gillette to Devils Tower, WY (80 miles)                 Devils Tower to Newcastle, WY (75 miles) – router day   This was an interesting driving day as I decided that I was going to try and drive all the way to Rapid City, SD to get a new cell phone since my one week old one was stuck in some kind of car kit mode where it would not allow me to hear anything. The route was quite nice cutting through the town of Sundance where they have an old jail on display in the city then turning onto Hwy 585 which took me back into the countryside where I can watch cows hump as well as see some striped cows which was quite unusual. They have vertical white stripes in the middle of their bodies. I finished the route to Newcastle at about 10:30am so off I went. Made it to Rapid City about noon and the Verizon store looked more like a huge social event..the place was packed. I did get a new phone only to find out I don’t have service where I am anyway.  On the drive back I decided to take one of the forest roads which cut through the Black Hills National Forest on my way back to Devils Tower. The road was great..another beautiful dirt wonder. I saw a bunch of deer and antelope and of course the cows who just do not want to move out of my way when I am driving. As I am attempting to become the next spokesperson for Offroading Magazine (while driving a Taurus)…a storm starts to roll in…the storms here in the mountains totally cover the area and it gets pitch black in a matter of minutes. At 3pm it looked like 11pm and it started to rain hard while me stuck somewhere out in the forest..the cows were laughing at me…I know it…that’s OK…I feasted on their cousin that afternoon..  Just as quick as the storm rolled in…it rolled away…but not after soaking a bunch of bags. Luckily, mine did not get too wet and I am so happy that I decided to get one of the Camping cabins at the KOA. Basically just a roof over your head with an uncomfortable bed inside..but it was nice.   Dinner was at a local restaurant down the street and then everyone hurried back to partake in the Margarita party that Cycle America took care of. We had about 15 bottles of tequilla and Kira made an awesome 10+ gallon concoction that could have stopped a truck. It was really interesting to see everyone after a few of these. The evening continued with a “No” Talent Show. A few riders got up and sang, read a poem, etc. Yes..there was definitely no star search material here. I got up with another rider, Steve, and we sang a song we both wrote while at dinner earlier in the evening. Steve played guitar while we sang a version of John Denver’s Country Road song but with bicycle and other innuendos…we got Alan..the Aussie in our group who so far has gotten like 8 flats on this trip to sing a verse which made the song work. As the drinks kept flowing..others kept singing until it was starting to hurt everyone. I am afraid I could not tell you what time I went to bed but I did manage to find my cabin in the dark with only a glowstick to light the way. Thankfully, we did not have to wake up till 10am today and yours truly promptly entered the world again today at 9:30am…removed the pillow from my mouth…and seemed to feel pretty good otherwise. Some riders are still feeling like crap and are most likely washing themselves down as they proceeded to get sick that evening. I should have offered them a greasy pork sandwich…  I am being kicked off since they need the phone line here at the KOA to run credit cards through…life on the road.

       Day 17 – July 6, 2004  - Dubois to Riverton, WY (91 miles) – Router Day   While the rest sweated it out from Dubois to Riverton, I routed for tomorrow’s day. It seems to be a very nice ride as it will take us into the valley along the reservoir. We pass thru a couple of tunnels cut directly into the mountain. Best of all, is the hot springs in Thermopolis, WY. If you like the smell of sulfur and calcium (sort of like the group after a red beans and rice dinner) then you will be at home. The park is absolutely amazing. The water has to be well over 120 degrees which is great for those cold mornings but not so great when its 85 in the afternoon.  The way out was pretty uneventful as most of the road is thru the desert and not much to look at..including the speedometer which a nice Wyoming highway patrol officer had to inform me of. Nothing like a Florida boy driving a car with Minnesota plates in Wyoming that sends an officer in this neck of the woods to the skeptical farm. To make it worse, the car registration which is in the Hertz folder they gave us is NOT in the car. Luckily this did not bother him that much but it didn’t help me out with the friggin ticket he gave me. 79 in a 65…c’mon…in Florida this is normal….bastard (both me and the cop)  The drive was a fairly long one as I had to drive the 80 something miles for the first route and the 91 (plus a 15 mile option) for the second. I did have some time to explore the park as well as the lovely dirt backroads. There is a buffalo pasture which had a ton of buffalo just…well…doing buffalo stuff.   By the time I finished screwing around, I had to get back so I am sitting in the cafeteria typing away as a bunch of folks are watching a tape of stage 3 of the Tour de France. Its kind of nice to see what is going on in the rest of the world as we pedal and sweat our way in this one.  Today is Ryan’s (staff) birthday so we are going out for one…yes one…really…I can do just one…I have a long day tomorrow.  Oh before I forget, anyone reading this….I seemed to have left a piece of my computer charger at the last stop or lost it or something. If anyone knows where I can get a computer charger for a Toshiba Sattelite Pro or the outlet plug piece (like you plug into the wall) for an APC TravelPower Adapter, please let me know via email at scott@scottkatzer.com. I am going to need one desperately as the battery power will only last me so long. Thanks in advance.   Day 18 – July 7, 2004  - Riverton to Worland, WY (94 miles)    This day had to be one of the best ride days..for me anyway. It reminded me of Florida…flat and hot..which made it a bit easier on my body. This route led us through the Wind River Valley which had the mountains and landscape hug both sides of the road. The road was mostly downhill as we descended into the valley. We rode through three tunnels carved directly into the rock which was, in some areas, more than 600 million years old. The railroad line also hugged the landscape and had its tunnels adjacent to the road as well. I can see some caveman thinking…”perhaps we need a tunnel here”..right before he gets trampled by a buffalo (or a caveman on a bicycle)  I am all about seeing the country and just taking the time to ride and enjoy the scenery but today was a day for simply riding fast. The downhills got my bike up to 42 mph without pedaling which is slow to some people here (just not enough adrenaline for some people). The terrain was the thing to see on this trip however. The best part of the trip was stopping in Thermopolis, WY (I am not making this name up) and seeing the natural hot springs at the Hot Springs State Park. We stopped for a bit and rode around but since I seen this the day before, I did not stay long. I was riding most of the day with Mike, another guy from Florida..friend of Keith’s..the other router. I figured a guy from Florida has to see a hot spring since the closest thing we have is a bathtub filled with hot water.  The day was not without its excitement. While at the school, Alis was helping move some luggage with the convertible two wheeler we have and got her finger jammed between the hinge to make it into a four wheeler. This caused her to pretty much rip her nail apart on one of her fingers. So, to play it safe, I walked Alis over to the medical center which was convieniently located next door to the middle school where we were staying. She had to have her fingernail cauterized (sp?) but got some nice drugs to go with the pain. She spent the evening kicking herself (not literally..she was in pain enough) and now has a nice momento of the trip. Hopefully none of us will follow suit.  Dinner was at the Ram’s Horn Café on Main Street and was awesome. All home cooked food…ham..roast beef…spaghetti and meatballs…and the indigestion to go with it. We went back to the school and the staff hung out in the room dedicated for the staff only. We had a TV with cable and watched Groundhog day as Peter read questions from the Dr. Ruth sex game that we found in the room. Basically asked common and not so common sex questions which we found odd to be in a middle school but then again, us staff probably only answered 70% of them correctly anyway. At least it was an educational evening.   Day 19 – July 8, 2004  - Worland to Buffalo, WY (92 miles) – for the riders              Buffalo to Gillette, WY (72 miles) – router day   Last night got a bit interesting. When Keith did the routing for the Worland to Buffalo route, he noted two major construction areas that were not passible to bikers due to the fact that there was no road, at least one that was not paved. Mary decided that we needed to provide a shuttle across these points for the riders and coordinated an effort such that the riders can get shuttled and still complete their ride in a timely fashion considering this was one of the hardest rides of the tour due to the two sub-10,000 ft climbs. This involved certain staff members to get up at 4am to start planning. Since each van could only hold 12 riders, some would get shuttled while others had to wait. We found out later that some hitched a ride from folks with pickup trucks for the 10 miles or so of road. It was quite an adventure and thankfully, this was my route day because the whole thing sounded quite shall we say adventuresome for a non-morning person. Keith felt the same way and decided not to ride so the two of us routed the next day’s route.   As we entered the town of Ten Sleep (don’t ask..but it’s a neat little town), there was a cattle drive. A couple, each on a horse, and their border collie were driving their herd of about 50 or so cattle up the road. It was quite a sight as cows were mooing like crazy and occasionally jumping on one another. One cow went berserk and crashed through a wooden fence of a guys house. The cowboy went after him but I did not see what happened. I am not sure who could win…a 180 lb cowboy or a 600+ lb cow. Mmm..where’s the beef?  We drove over some of the passes and were concerned considering we could not see more than 5 feet in front of us because of the fog that rolled in. Trucks came out of nowhere and scared the hell out of us (OK..me) I almost did not see a deer that was beside the road. He probably came out to laugh at me for the incident the other day with his cousin in the woods of Teton Park.  We grabbed lunch at the Chophouse (113 S. Gillette Av) in Gillette before our drive forward onto Devils Tower as we decided to try and sqeeze two days of routing since Keith and I were together. I recommend the green chili burger..most likely from one of the cattle’s cousin. (Sorry to all my vegetarian friends)  We quickly routed the Devils Tower route and found out that is where they filmed Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Can’t wait to see it this weekend as we are there for two days. We took a really nice dirt backroad home and arrived in time to have dinner at the Occidental Hotel (10 N. Main) in downtown Buffalo. This place is amazing. It was restored to its 1908 condition and the hotel rooms are awesome. A few staff and riders are staying their tonight. I thought about it but decided that a nice hard gym floor was what I wanted. (I also had two drinks at the hotel before I came back here). Butch Cassidy, Calamity Jane (no..she is not a porn star), and The Sundance Kid all stayed here. The saloon is the best part. The wood finishes are all restored to its original condition and the walls are lined with more animals than you care to think about. It’s a must see if you are here in Buffalo. We all sat around  and had a few drinks before retiring…sort of speak.  Tomorrow’s ride is on the interstate. Yes..Interstate I-90. It is legal here for bikes to be on the interstate here in WY. Its still a pretty ride but will be quite noisy. Oh well, at least there are two trees right off the highway in case duty calls.

       Day 16 – July 5, 2004  - Jackson Hole to Dubois, WY (103 miles)   Yes..103 miles…on a bike and of course there is about 20 miles of it uphill. Today was a long long (did I mention long) day…at least it felt that way for part of the ride. We awoke rather abruptly as the temperature around Jackson Hole dropped to 41 degrees. 41 degrees…in friggin July. Since it rained (rather..hailed) last night, we all awoke to wet tents and frigid temperatures. This morning, I pretty much put on every piece of bike clothing I had in my arsenal…arm and leg warmers, booties, head and ear coverings, full fingered gloves and of course, the jacket. I felt like gumby as I tried to move in all this garb. My sleeping bag felt so warm and cozy this morning too.  This morning was a little different as we had to bike to the breakfast location 20 miles away in Teton National Park at a place called Dornan’s. It is located right outside the park entrance and has some great scenery of the Tetons as you sit in front of them to enjoy your breakfast. It was nice to actually order a meal rather than taking what is given to you. Although bisquits and gravy were probably not Lance Armstrong’s choice for a healthy breakfast..screw it…they were damn good.   The ride through the park was amazing as the mountains became the backdrop for at least 30 miles of the ride. It did warm up to about the mid 50’s around 9:30am but it was still chilly. I did have quite an interesting late morning however.  Around mile 40, right before the Jackson Dam, I realized that I passed the lodge where I believed there to be a water stop. Of course, as the router I should know this but my brain was not actually functioning to 100% that morning (or any morning for that matter). As I was contemplating going back and since I was already stopped, I decided to “see a man about a horse” if you catch my drift and moved over to the side of the road and went into the woods to do my business. As I was doing so, this deer, antlers and all, comes jumping out of the woods probably no more than 20 yards from me. He stopped as I assume most deer would in this case and just stared at me. I, of course, was pretty mesmerized myself having never seen a deer this close before and basically froze so he would not move. I then realized that it was starting to feel a little chilly down below and then realized that in the midst of the excitement, I sort of…shall we say…forgot to zip up. The deer of course did not seem to be phased by all this as he probably seen stupid humans do this all the time.  I sat there and just watched him for a few more moments. He didn’t say too much so I grabbed one of my Clif bars. He ate grass. I took a bite of my Clif bar. He ate more grass. I spit out the bite I just took of my Clif bar as I forgot to take the wrapper off. Both of us eventually got bored with one another and to avoid another dumbass move figured I was better off on the bike so off I went. I wonder what deer say to each other after encounters like that? Deer gossip…probably the worst kind.  The ride was pretty much uneventful after that except for the friggin climb from hell that lasted probably 20 miles. Although it was not a steep climb..it was long and my legs will attest to that. We were gaining so much altitude that I had to stop just to try and get a deep breath. I did finally make it to the top to the Continental Divide and Togwotnee Pass at an elevation of 9658 feet. My heart and lungs were pounding since I was pretty much 9658 feet above my hometown. I had this guy take the picture of me at the pass and it took me a few seconds just to stand upright and catch my breath. From there, it was all downhill…literally. We had about 9 solid miles of straight downhill with the only negative was that it was still cold. There was snow at the top of the mountain. After that, the wind was at our backs and it was smooth sailing pretty much into town which made for a pleasant time.   Dinner was at a local restaurant tonight and we feasted on ham, trout, red beans and rice, mashed potatoes and homemade cherry and apple pies. It was awesome to say the least. Then again, after a 103 mile ride, cardboard would seem awesome. Tomorrow I route up to Worland from Riverton which will be about a 91 mile ride..but at least my legs get a break.

      I just spent the last hour typing a long blog only to have the power knock out the connection and losing it. So since its now late and I am tired..I will have to provide the condensed version.  We are in Jackson Hole WY right now at the KOA campground and it is hailing outside (yes..hailing). James, Kira, Tauna, Lisa, Peter, and Dublin are playing cards in front of me quite competitively I might add..could be a fist fight later  Our day was spent quite nicely after using my college education to fill water jugs. We went into town and had some great Mexican food and the walked around the city. Jackson Hole is a combination trendy hotspot and quaint village. Overpriced drinks and food in a nice mountain setting.  We went out quite late last night as we celebrated Dublin's birthday at a local cowboy bar complete with country band. One of the riders, Matt from Iowa decided he need to find beer so we had the taxi driver drive us around town to find a place that would sell him beer. Two places later, he found success and we were off to bed.  Tomorrow is a long 100 mile day to Dubois..home of the mountain goat museum..and a giant jackalope. So much for the fireworks tonight...hope everyone has a drier 4th.

       Day 11 - June 30, 2004  - Townsend, MT to Ennis, MT (77 miles)   This day started out so good but turned into an amazing hell (sort of speak). Its funny how some days I can bike 50 miles + with no problem and other days 10 miles can be a struggle. The route was not so bad for the first 10 miles….all Highway 287…straight..traffic…but the scenery was nice. Then my right shifter decided to stop working and I rode 15 miles to the water stop with only two gears..high and not so high. I figured out a way to screw with it a bit and get it to work but not without some major headache. Made it to the picnic stop with no problem. Right before the stop, I caught up with a couple of riders, Victor and Cynthia, and we found a perfectly preserved deer skeleton on the side of the road. We stopped to check it out and was contemplating what happened when a big truck roared past us. We then noted how ironic it would be if years from now some other biker came along and noted not only the deer skeleton but the two idiots who got hit checking out a skeleton in the first place. We took the deer head and strapped it to the rear bag on Victor’s bike as a mascot. We named him Fred. Fred made it to the high school that night but somehow mysteriously disappeared in the morning. Hope we did not disturb the deer gods.  I must have been dreading the climb right after lunch…not sure what the grade is but it had to be at least 8% for about 2 miles. Basically the mountain was kicking my ass..but I somehow made it up to the top to see the awesome view of the Madison Valley that I saw the day before. Somehow this made it a bit better. Took off down the mountain for a nice descent getting up to about 36 mph dodging pebbles like they were boulders. Talk about a rush. The last 10 miles though literally kicked my ass but somehow I managed to finish. The wind was directly in my face and somehow those miles seemed like they would never end. I was so tired when I got to the school but had to get laundry done that day somehow. I am discovering that if you have a chance to get some laundry done that it is wise to take it as you never know when a place will be close and available. So I walked the 3 blocks with my laundry in tow to the nearby laundromat. I put my clothes in the washer and put my head down on the table I was sitting at for what I thought were a few minutes and ended up sleeping for almost 20. When I got back to the school, I passed out for almost 2 hours. Of course…I had trouble sleeping that night.  The day was somewhat uneventful except for this one rider named Ted. Ted is a unique individual and the best way to describe him is he appears to look like a homeless person. He is a nice guy but that is just his demeanor. It turns out that Ted has attempted this ride before and has paid for this trip one dollar at a time. He is definitely a trooper to say the least. Anyway, I gave my talk about the day’s route and the very first thing I said to everyone is “Highway 287 is the only road you will be on all day so NO need to get off this road”. Anyway somewhere between that morning and the evening, Ted was nowhere to be found. No calls..no sightings..nothing. We worried about him for a while until Mary, the tour director stated he has done this before. We have a lost rider hotline that riders can call if they are lost so we can check periodically in case we did not find you or if you got lost. We received a phone call about 11pm from Ted saying he was at some guys house out in the middle of the boonies..which for Montana is pretty good..anyway…Ted was found and is around for his next big adventure.   Day 12 - July 1, 2004 – Ennis, MT to West Yellowstone, MT (78 miles)                   Router Day – West Yellowstone, MT to Ashton, ID (57 miles)  This day made up for yesterday. Today we had the option to stay in a nearby hotel instead of camping out but at our cost. After several nights of sleeping on floors, listening to the various sounds of farting, coughing, and hacking, as well as the rude awaking at 5:30am by early risers….it was a no brainer. Keith and I discussed slitting the cost of the room so I was going to check it out. Alis decided she was bored with the whole baggage truck detail. Somehow using your brain power to carry a bag from outside the truck to inside the truck can only stimulate ones senses for so long. Alis and I headed out on a really nice route around Earthquake Lake onto West Yellowstone. Earthquake Lake was formed when an earthquake hit the region about 50 years ago and its absolutely amazing. We hit West Yellowstone where we stopped at the hotel and thankfully they had a reasonably priced room. So glad I booked it because it rained tonight and I am in a nice dry somewhat comfy bed for the evening. Not going to make any apologies here.  Alis and I did the routing for the day and since the day was only 57 miles, it went by fast. The route goes by the Upper and Lower Mesa Falls which are awesome to say the least. We finished up in Ashton where we are staying at the local high school (yes..on the gym floor) We are going to be the last guests as they are building a new high school down the street…for all 1100 residents. Since we finished up by noon…we figured it was time to explore so we hit some of the dirt roads off of the scenic highway. I had a blast driving down these roads at stupid speeds and covering the car in mud. We ended up down this one Forest Road that ended at a really great waterfall called Warm Springs. No..it was not warm unless you consider 50 degrees warm. There was a really cool cabin out there that this guy was staying at with his wife and grandkids for a couple of days. Its really great if you want to be away from everything. It had no electricity nor running water and the bathroom was the outhouse out back. The flyfishing he says was OK but he was enjoying it. Alis and I hiked up a bit on the falls before heading back and driving some more. On the way in and back, we passed a field of cattle..both adults and baby calves in this open filed..no fences…Alis got the bright idea that she wanted to see how close she could get. Of course..I am thinking I should have a video camera for America’s Funniest Home Video’s. We walked out on the main road and the cows scattered a bit and then some came around toward the rear of us almost closing us in. That’s all I need is to have one of you read in the local news on how some dumbasses got trampled by moving beef so we got out of there. I could not stop laughing at all the sounds they were making though…most likely mocking us.  Since we had such fun with cows..we were both craving burgers (go figure) so we grabbed lunch at this great bar and grill near Mesa Falls then headed back. I am excited that my new bike parts are here so the bike mechanics worked tonight on outfitting my bike with a new triple ring, shifters, cables, etc. I am so looking forward to using it tomorrow.  After dinner we all went to check out Old Faithful at Yellowstone. Every staff member got these guide passes which allow us to get in free which is such a great deal. Keith, Lisa, Peter and myself decided to take the router car since the vans were shuttling people over. That was our…well..I lost count…mistake. We got scolded by Mary for treating the car like its our personal car…oh well…never did get fired from a volunteer position before. We got there with perfect timing as Old Faithful erupted within 20 minutes after we got there. It was raining a bit when we got there so it wasn’t spectacular but it was nice to see..the smell on the other hand wasn’t the most pleasant. Definitely a tourist trap..took us an hour to get there….10 minutes to say ooh and aah…and another hour back. But hey..at least I got to see the Old ground explode. On our way in, we saw a moose as well as several Elk and deer. Peter came close to almost hitting one on the way out…good thing he stopped when he did.  Got back to the campground and I am definitely happy to have my bed for the evening…even if its in a glorious 5 star Super 8 Motel…but hey…its dry.   Day 13 - July 2, 2004 – West Yellowstone, MT to Ashton, ID (57 miles)   Today was an awesome day..its a shame each day can’t be only 57 miles. It started out by waking up in a nice bed for a change. The Motel 8 did its trick. My bike was outfitted with a completely new triple chain ring and shifters so life was good. I actually slept till 7am…yes…7am…it felt awesome. Took the day slow and it turned out to be the best thing I did.  We biked along route 20 for the first 20 miles. I saw two deer crossing along the highway and traffic came to a screeching halt. Yes…the deer did get the deer in the headlights look as they bolted across the highway. I caught up with two riders, Ken from CA and Meg from Boston at the first water stop and we rode together pretty much the rest of the way. We turned onto Highway 47 which is a scenic highway. It was great..hardly any traffic and a view of the Tetons in the background. We rode to the Upper and Lower Mesa Falls and had lunch. The views were spectacular. We decided to eat and then bike to the Upper Falls where you can get a much closer view. After some pictures, we did the touristy thing and went into the visitor center. People are always curious what we are doing so they stop to ask questions and usually always have the same reaction. (What??) The unfortunate thing about seeing the Upper Falls later after lunch is that we had to bike uphill for a solid mile to get out….not something a full tummy enjoys.  We rode for a bit more and caught up with a few more riders. We then stopped at the Warm River Springs where Meg wanted to go for a dip. We all stopped and walked to the water which I soon found out that “Warm” means about 50 or so degrees. We dipped our feet in a while before a few decided to try and cross the river which was amusing to say the least. A few of us actually jumped in and rode the current down including yours truly after being taunted by a few riders. I suppose as staff I should set a good example and since I am already showing them how to damage ones liver…I figured why not. The water was not actually that bad and the current was quite strong. After a few pictures were taken, we noticed a storm rolling in (and fast) so we got our stuff together and rode the last 10 miles into Ashton, ID (population about 1100 and home of pretty much nothing). Nothing like riding 10 miles in wet bike shorts to make you feel alive in the afternoon.  We are staying at the high school here in town and are most likely the last guests to stay here as a new high school is being built down the street. Its really interesting to look at these old circa 1950’s high school class pictures spread along the walls of the school. I thought I had some bad hair days. The local folks in town are in the process of making us dinner…hamburgers I think but the fixins look awesome.   The night life around here is pretty much limited to listening to the wind or if you are really ambitious..heading down to the local ice cream shop (before 9pm of course) for a malt. There are two bars in town and both look quite interesting in a matter of speaking. Wonder if I should knock a few teeth out before going in just to make me appear less like a tourist.

      Going a bit out of order as some of the writings are on my computer and I am at an internet station now so bear with me.  Today is another router day where I am driving the 68+ miles from Jackson Hole, WY to Dubois, WY which is about 100 miles. We get to bike this on Monday the 5th. Something to look forward to..throwing up.  At least I did not bike today as the hills were intense..some as much as 10% grade. People are going to be tired tonight. My drive was pretty uneventful until I drove into Teton National Park. Unbelievable beauty in this place and a great view of the Tetons. There was a bear sighting for a while but he took off when the stupid tourists started to get out of their cars.   Today's route led thru the Park and back onto Highway 26 onto Dubois. Not much to see except for the same nice scenery. As I entered Dubois, I am drawn to the large jackalope located adjacent to the Exxon station here in town. Supposedly they have some good milkshakes but will wait till Monday. I ate lunch at this place called the Wild Bunch Bar and Grill (112E. Ramshorn, Dubois). If you want some great chili and fish tacos..come here..well worth it. There tables have brandings in them from various raches around the state. It was very interesting to learn the reasons behind some of the designs. You can also by T-shirts, hot sauces, and even a walk-in cooler (they want $39,321.07 for it...I am holding solid at $39,321.00). I also found out that the valley around here is the home of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  I found a library (really nice one I might add) here in town and am about to drive the 100 miles back to Jackson. We are staying at a nearby campground for two nights for the holiday. Supposedly they have a really great 4th of July celebration. Will let you know more later.

       Day 9 - June 28, 2004  - Missoula, MT to Lincoln, MT (84 miles)   Had a great time in Missoula. Got to see my cousin Alan whom I have not seen in at least 10 years. He is 24 and just finished up college at the University of Montana. He came by where we were staying which was at the Sister Rita Mudd Activity Center in lovely downtown Missoula. Since we had an afternoon of doing maintenance stuff like filling water bottles and playing with garden hoses..I took off for part of the afternoon so Alan and I could get caught up. We grabbed some grub at a good local joint right out of town and then proceeded to his house where I met his girlfriend Erin. Erin had a late meeting that night so Alan and I grabbed a six pack of good local brew and then decided to go 4 wheeling outside of town. He has an old Scout truck which was perfect for this adventure.   We headed up a gravel road just outside of town, locked the hubs and took off. Some really cool roads in the backcountry. In fact, they are all over the place and even have maps noting most of them. We got about ½ way and noticed a truck pulled over on the side of the road. The truck was filled with freshly cut Douglas Fir, each about 2 feet in diameter and about 2 feet long. Alan was determined to take some of these home since no one was around. The truck had two flats on the passenger side, the rear tire was totally stripped from the wheel most likely due to the weight of the wood. As Alan was about to pick some pieces out of the truck, the truck owner came out of the woods. Luckily we did not come close to grabbing at the wood so we asked him if he needed help. We helped him remove the wheels and threw it in Alan’s truck and drove him down the mountain to the nearest service station. Call it our good deed of the day for almost getting caught doing something stupid. When we got back, Erin was there and I met their pet tortoise, Cecil. I never knew anyone with a pet tortoise (not turtle). What is the difference you ask? Probably about 100 lbs when its fully grown. Cute little gal…watching her crawl along the front area of the house eating everything in its path. Never knew a tortoise can eat so much…looks like a fun pet to bring with you to parties. If only you can train them to fetch or something…or at least cook you breakfast.  Later that night, Alan, myself, Erin, and most of the staff gang from Cycle America went to a local hangout named the Rhino. Great beers on tap and we had several. I had to ride tomorrow so of course I stayed out later than I should have as we left that place to hit a nearby Irish pub which still had its kitchen open. This was probably not the best of ideas as the munchie mode set in and on came the potato skins and artichoke dip…just what the body needs prior to an 84 mile ride the next AM.  After we said our goodbyes, managed to walk home with the gang and make it to bed only to be woken up once again at 5 friggin 30 in the AM. What the hell is wrong with these people? The baggage truck did not open till 6am and breakfast was not until 6:30am but somehow putting on bike shorts and getting ones crap together takes precendence over just a few more precious moments on sleep. I may kill somebody this trip…just kidding (maybe…). Since I was up..I figured to start my day and hit the riding. Mostly highway riding once out of the city until one point where there was a turnoff I found which went back into a valley. Quite a bumpy road which of course people needed to bitch about because heaven forbid they have to slow down and look at the scenery. Of course, as a router, I am always the first that has to hear about it. Guess that’s the fun part of the job they forgot to tell me about but there are a few people on this tour that are real nice and appreciate some of the things we try and show them. That, at least, makes up for some of the obsessive folks. Drinking lots of beer helps too.  Right now I am sitting in Lincoln Public School in Lincoln, MT..the school is K thru 12 which tells you how small this town is. I believe the Continetal Divide runs through here but I have not seen it yet. Just outside of town is the High Country Store which I am partaking in one pound of kickass beef jerky. Another staple of this trip…probably from some of the roadkill I passed today. At least I know I am helping clean up the highways of America. I can smell dinner cooking in the cafeteria which is located adjacent to the gym. I am not sure what the mystery meat of the day is but it smells wonderful…enough to even make me close my bag of jerky. Although the grease smell worries me a bit as this gym isn’t very well ventilated and digested greasy food can only lead to one orifice as it is slowly digested….you get the picture….African barking spiders anyone?  Turned out the mystery meat was Lasagna. Getting quite tired of Italian food. Went out to grab a few beers last night at the only two places in town. Three riders had birthdays yesterday so we watched them partake in a bottle of champagne. The woman who ran the Moose Joose Saloon was great. She let us use her phone to make calling card calls and kept topping off the champagne with OJ. I stuck with beer…I mean..how can one go wrong with a beer called Moose Drool.   Day 10 - June 29, 2004  - Lincoln, MT to Townsend, MT (93 miles) 			   Router Day – Townsend, MT to Ennis, MT (77 miles)  Woke up in the mist of a chilly morning bordering in the low 50’s. The Unabomber was from here and all I can think is that he must have frozen his ass off as well while plotting his next ordeal. Glad I was not riding today as my cockles were quite shivering walking to the car. I decided to take an off –road route to the midpoint of Highway 287 which is where most of the riding took place today. I love taking that car off roading. The path was compacted gravel suitable for vehicles..it wasn’t mudding…but close enough. I drove over Stemple Pass (elev. 6373 ft.) which is about a 20+ mile dirt road thru the forest. The car churned a bit making it up the hill but it was quite a peaceful ride. Saw several deer and numerous cattle simply out for a walk and looking at me as I was driving by. (What could they be thinking?)  Drove thru Helena on my way to Townsend where the start of the routing took place. Today was basically driving along Highway 287 all the way to Ennis (not to be confused with his cousin Penis…thanks…I have a million of ‘em). Although I am not quite fond of biking along Highways (for those back home..similar to a light traffic of A1A although no shoulder), this route was quite nice. We have a pretty major climb after about 60 miles leading to a view of the Madison Valley and Mount Jefferson that will take anyones breath away. I have graded the decent of that climb a “woohoo” factor of 4 out of 5. We shall see how tomorrow goes.   The day was pretty easy to route so had some time to explore the town of Ennis. Its quite a cute little fly fishing town with tourist shops, sportsman stores and the like. It still looks like it did about 80+ years ago with the stores lining the sides of the streets. Kept my cholesterol and gassy intake in check with a great steak sandwich with hot peppers at a local restaurant called Chutes Away. Walked around the town and checked a few emails at the local library before the library police told me I had to get off. Decided knocking off an elderly woman is not a great way to get to know the locals so I left.   I then got the bright idea to try and get a new cell phone since mine has been hanging by a thread for a week now. The closest place was in Bozeman about 45 miles away. Got the idea to cut across Highway 84 which was a big mistake as they were doing construction and we had to be escorted via a truck in a single file line at 25 mph for 12 miles. It was like watching old people eat…..pardon the metaphor. I did make it to Bozeman where the guy was all confused on how to get a FL boy a new phone in MT. It worked out after several phone calls and I am now the proud owner of a new cell phone and $300 poorer. Speaking of money, I have decided to outfit my bike with a triple ring in lieu of the double to better assist me with the hills. The cost…another $500 or so. Who said this trip was free???  Back here at the Townsend gym..I am having trouble not going out to explore the town. My body says no…my liver says yes…and my ass says….”Help me!!!” The agony of the decision….Peter just walked in with a deck of cards and Alis wants to go out…what to do? Beer it is....

       August 5 2004 - Richmond, MI to West Lorne Ontario Canada (73 miles)   It was a wee bit cold this morning but no rain. We always are thankful for no rain. Of course trying to tell people to sleep an extra 15 minutes because of no excitement in the coming city is like trying to scare ants away from a picnic by pouring sugar on the ground. So my 6:30am wake up call was made at 6:05am. So be it. I am so used to it by now it hardly affects me anymore.  The weather was really nice which made the ride nicer. Everyone was excited to take the 10 minute ferry ride into Canada. We bicycled through town into Marine City where we took the ferry over. The folks running the ferry have it made. $5 for a car and $1 for a bike and its the only ferry crossing around. The border patrol is laughable. On the American side, they are a bit stricter..or at least sounding like it. The Canadian side has two rather large women, not that they are unattractive...they just look like they can kick some ass if they wanted to. The questions are always the same...where are you from? How long are you here? Do you have any explosive or weapons with you? Personally the last question gets me..."Um..excuse me..but I am wearing bike shorts with padding in places I do not wish to talk about in mixed company..where do you think I am going to put my weapons of mass destruction?" Although I have been known to get crazy with a gatorade filled water bottle.  Canada..at least this part..was quite nice. The wind was in our face for most of the day until we hit the 56 mile mark. There was a major natural gas plant along the way which scares the hell out of me because the air was filled with the smell of natural gas and manure. One match and Canada is seceding from the continent. We found a small store where we could actually buy a coke and use American money. They would prefer it anyway and screw us on the change. The dang metric system screws us out of 0.8 oz of coke in a normally 12 oz can. They could not round it up to 400 mL from 355ml..bastards. Blame Canada....Blame Canada...  We are staying at a high school in West Lorne. Its an old school but I get a kick out of how the shower controls are all in the coach's office. One control operates 10 shower heads. Not the most energy efficient system to say the least. Took a walk down to the library to check some email and then went across the street to have some damn good pie (although not as good as yesterday's). Talked with Huck and John..a couple of riders..about music and beer. After dinner tonight, we had a swap meet sort of speak. A few of us brought in our things or shall we say...crap that we do not want to carry around anymore. Traded tent stakes for candy...really bad candy...so much for that bartering system.  More pics are up...its bed time

       August 4 2004 - Router Day - Richmond, MI to West Lorne, Ontario Canada   Need to fill in on the rest of the evening from last night. Went out with a number of riders and staff to the nearby Frankenmuth Brewpub down the street. We started at 8pm and left about midnight which should be enough said. It was nice to be the birthday boy as everyone bought me beer. I highly recommend the Hefeweizen. 4 pints and a basket of pretzel bread later, we were only down to four. Kira, Matt from Australia, Mike..a new guy from MN, and myself. We should have left then but of course stupidity set in and we got about 20 yards before walking into another place..this one quite the cool dive...and had another....two...We walked..or rather..staggered back to the middle school we were staying at and hopefully did not wake up anyone. Next thing I know it was 7am and the gym was empty except for me...pulling the earplugs out of my ears wondering where everyone went.  It was raining this morning and did not look pretty so Keith decided to join me for the route today. It really sucks routing in the rain because the yellow paint runs everywhere and seems to attach itself to interior car parts rather than the pavement. We drove into Canada today. We took a car ferry from Marine City, MI over the St. Clair River into Canada. We made it past the customs office and got stamped, eh? We then proceeded down some nice roads that truthfully reminded me of South Dakota...long and straight. We did see a coyote (or perhaps a rather large dog) cross our path but other than that the trip was uneventful. We stopped into the town of West Lorne (population 1000) where we will be staying. The highlight of the trip was finding a coin laundry to wash my britches while I wrote up the route. We stopped at the only restaurant in town where they featured a chicken sandwich special that sounded rather good verbally but turned out to be a chicken puck with cheese (reminded me of college actually) except that I did not have to pay $6.00 for it. Then again I probably paid $20 because of the way they worked the exchange rate there. Their theory is that they deduct 25% of the dollar amount but not the change so a $10.50 meal would be $7.50 for the $10 portion and then an additional 50 cents for the original change making it $8.00. Somehow they are making out...that's all I know.  On the way back into the US..Keith gets a warning from the US border patrol as to not be on the cell phone while passing thru customs due to the freedom of information act. Somehow us being a smart ass is not good for someone to hear on the other end of the telephone. They let us in anyway. We went back thru town remarking the route because of the rain and then went an additional 10 miles into Armada MI to a pie store called Achatz Handmade Pie company (the one we went was at 75700 North Avenue in Armada). Since we told the riders about this place, the owner gave Keith and I free pieces of pie. All I can say is that this is by far the best pie you can ever have. They have a website at  urlLink www.achatzpies.com  and they ship. Trust me...its fantastic. Better than s.. uh .....OK...maybe not but damn good. A nice way to end a day...along with the tacos, burgers, and pizza we had for dinner tonight. Please poke me because I am done.

       August 2-3, 2004 - Mt. Pleasant to Frankenmuth, MI (88 miles)     Well the big birthday finally came. Seemed so distant but as of now I am officially 35 years of age and smelling up the downtown Frankenmuth Library after an exhausting 88 mile ride. The ride itself was fairly uneventful except for this carved statue about 4 miles out. Turns out someone carved a man holding a paint can (its located in front of a paint store) with his hand. The only problem with this concept is that he has only one arm and the arm is protruding from... shall we say...his nether region (that's crotch for you people who need to get to the point). I must say that if there is indeed a man who can hold a full 5 gallon paint can with his...uh...."tallywacker"...that he should be made president or something...or at least have a folk song written about him.  THe ride today took us through some small towns where some folks may not like out of towners. Yesterday, during my routing for today's ride. I entered the town of Shepherd and put down a few arrows on the roda near a turn. This pickup truck with two good ol' boys saw what I was doing from across the street and made a U-turn to follow me out of town. There truck had a yellow light as well as signage indicating it was a city vehicle. They did not attempt to stop me but did follow me...rather..tail me out of town. This is supposed to be an adventure but the last thing I need is Bubba and company taking me out back to be shot or worse....somehow the theme from the movie Deliverance entered my head at this time.  We are now in the town of Frankenmuth which is a quaint little village totally decorated like a German village. Everything is about brats and beer..two very good things. Its a bit tacky as I rode past the largest Xmas store but its a fun change from the large open spaces of nothing. Looking forward to going out later and having one to celebrate the big "3-5".  Better go check on my bike as I left it outside...the last thing I want to see is some dude in Liederhosen running off with my bike.
