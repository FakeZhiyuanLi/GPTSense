      i went to sleep early yesterday so i wouldnt get up late today. that was successful. i have yet to do much of anything. got the crack in my ghetto car's windshield fixed... hopefully. i did it the white trash way. this guy on the side of a long road in a motor home fixed it for $60. haha. yeehaw. now i have to go turn in my applications and call in to see if i work... i need to work dammit.  i talked to two of my VA boys earlier! that made my day so much better. i love them so much. aj's mom just called me back and thought she had missed a call from her brother in TX, that was sorta funny. she remembers me. sweet.  having talked to them, i got things sorted out and the culprit's name was revealed to me. RUMORS ARE BAD, AND THEY HURT PEOPLE. not just the people they're about either. but how shallow a person to spread a rumor about your "best friend". whatever. i dont have time for that crap anywho. people will grow up and get a life someday i reckon, if not, God help them.  July 4th is this weekend... i wonder what im going to end up doing...

      well i have to say, Warped Tour ROCKED. Everyone kicked ass, and i crowd surfed! Hell yeah. It was awesome. Granted they dropped me once and i hit my head... but thats alright. Im kinda sore from the 8 hours of physical activity that i pushed myself to participate in. Unfortunately i only heard one of Thursday's songs cuz i almost passed out... it was so hot. Texas for ya...  On the way there i was listening to a cd i made quite a few months ago, and realized all the songs i love are the songs that remind me of someone i hate to be reminded of. Not the person actually, but the situation we're currently in. Or the situation it seems we'll never leave, rather. Funny how cliches sometimes fit your life. "love hurts" dammit.  Aside from that, im looking for another job. Unfortunately im in Beaumont and left my applications at my dads in Nederland. Looks like i'll be dropping them off tomorrow instead of today. Lets hope that goes well.

      so yesterday i slept all day. i usually hate putting a day to such waste. but i still hadnt gotten much sleep. i went to work last night and it was so weird. ive been out of town, but i feel like ive been away from life for a long time. reality is still trying to make its way back into my head. i dont know why it hasnt yet. maybe i dont want it to. all i can think about is what i want my life to be like, and i try not to think of what it is.  desperate to go back, i find myself almost recklessly trying to download all of the songs that mark the week that i visited in VA. if it werent so far...  i hate secrets. and even more so, i hate rumors. especially the rumors that some believe are just secrets that somehow got out. if you dont think its something i would do... do you think i'd do it? im not that unpredictable am i?  so dont let the little things get in the way. dont let the little things in life get you down. if you dont look at the overall picture, you miss the point. and you dont want to miss the point.

      so now i have something that i'll post online for nobody to read. or for them to read and be disgusted by my pessimism. yes you all know how i can be. i know how i can be. and it makes me sick. the most nauseating part of it all is i manage to screw things up, and usually dont see what i did wrong. but after my visit to virginia, im beginning to think maybe im not the person i think i am. i know the good things i do. i know how much i love everyone and the things i do for them and the lengths ive gone. those are the things that make me feel good about myself. but its never enough. and when i finally say, "thats it, i cant do any more. its too much."  thats when i become the bad guy in the black mask. this i dont understand, and im beginning to think that maybe it is just me, and its not everyone else. everyone thinks theyre the good ones in bad situations. maybe i am like everyone else. all i know is that i dont want to be here, and im not wanted where i want to be. so im so stuck. i need to leave. i need to be gone from everything and everyone. i need sleep. i havent slept but maybe 16 hours since i woke up at 9 tuesday morning. even then i didnt get much sleep while i was up there. i realize this is extremely long for my first "entry". i have a lot on my mind. and even more to say. but i'll space it out. or just take a break. im going to go away.

      "i wake up next to you, start the day off right."  such a beautiful thing for a person to say, it brings a tear to my eye.  i love  mom left yesterday morning to bring the kiddos to FL. so ive had the house to myself for a while. its nice. but im still bored as always. at least im not being stressed out by other unmentioned occupants. nah... its not that bad. but the peace and quiet is quite nice. i also get to park in the garage when she's gone. and that's convenient. my car is always blazing hot when i get in it. i will have this luxury once more when she goes to pick the kids up from FL in a week. im gunna miss them. i already do. i love my little girl and my baby boy. such sweethearts.  i got horrendous bug bites on my feet sometime throughout the course of last nights activities. and they itch like a bitch. mercy me.  nothing else has really been going on. minus the things i havent mentioned.  ; )  and we will keep it that way. i love being happy.

        or am i dreaming?      &nbsp;  oh man. i cant handle being this happy. i cant contain myself. i dont know what to do! all i know to do is smile, but if i smile i'll have the stupid cheese on my face all day. then people will start to wonder. i woke up happy this morning, and that's all anyone needs to know.  while i can hardly handle my happiness, i love feeling like im about to bust. i love having the urge to run around and hug everyone. what&nbsp;i do not love is that the one person i want to hug and give my love to is not available. stupid timing.   yesterday i went to the eye doctor. they dilated my eyes. that was... well, for a few hours i couldnt see up close, and the sun killed my eyes. soon after i got home jacob calls me and needs me to drive to nederland to let him in my dads apt. because he locked himself out. (genius)&nbsp; so i do, and then i wait for my dad to get home so i can talk to him about getting new handles on my car doors. (the night before someone had gotten into my car. stupid people didnt take anything worth money, they only took the change that was sitting in my passenger seat and my lighter. oh, and they took the two hats i had in there and threw them in the yard across the street from my neighbor. wtf? would someone please tell me what the point of that was?)&nbsp; then i went to my dads baseball game in Groves. i love baseball. fun stuff. so i came home around 11:30, went to walgreens for my mom and came home. then aaron called me around 1 and said to meet him and angela at taco bell, then came to find out it wasnt open. so i waited for him to call me back with a new plan. so i ended up goin to his house for an hour. that was nice. = )  another thing that sucks, that i hardly care about right now because im in such a good mood, but i really do care about overall because it could screw a lot of things up is this school schedule thing. i went to running start monday and found out i lost three of my credits, so when i went back yesterday to find out if i could fix it, the stupid ass. principal is not computer literate so he couldnt access my files, and now i have to wait on attendance to get back on monday to see if i can fix this shit. ughhhhhh. i will cry if this doesnt get corrected.   today i have to make some calls to get my car fixed. aside from that, i dont have anything to do. how lovely. i am going to try to do something with tara so i can gush out all my good feelings to her. i have to do it to someone, or i will burst.

      &nbsp; today was good and bad. i had an awesome time with tara and her cousin and his friend. we picked up jeff on the way too lol. hooray for the taco bell parking lot smoking spree. we went to running start for school. that alone was sucky, but then i find out i lost 3 of my credits from last year due to absences. what bullshit. they didnt notify me or anything. so now i have to go bawl my eyes out to the assistant principal tomorrow. which i probably literally will, the joys of pms.   our work meeting got moved to tonight. so thats all im going to be doing im sure, unless i hear from aaron. which, the chance is slim as always. we hung out last night, but i really dont talk to him often. and when we hang out, its always us and some other people. which is ok, but i miss my aaron time. lol. i miss having a best friend around, and i dont have one handy. i miss my cj... damn fucking pms. im all upset. ive felt like crap all day.  wow, i love how my 5 year old brother orders me around. as if i dont hear it enough from other people.   i really feel like crying right now, but i dont want to have to re-do my eyeliner again. plus, there's no point. i'll save the tears for the next time i get sad, since hopefully then i'll have valid reason to cry. more than likely that'll be the case.

      &nbsp; its such a shame that everything has ended up like it has.  i hung out with tara yesterday. that made me happy. she and lindsey came over after they went to the mall. it was nice to see lindsey too. she's so cute. after she left tara and i went to the mall for me to get more flipflops since mercy ate my other ones a long time ago, and i also bought a really cute tank top. yay for me. after that we went up to Carino's and saw michael, and for me, all the other guys lol. that was a lot of fun again. i think i laughed the hardest when tara started singing "im leaving on a jet plane". yeah, good times right there. she tried to spend the night with me, but that didnt go over well at all... so much for that.   i went to bed pretty early. 11:15 i'd say. woke up to 3 IMs, from 3 really important people in my life. though the IMs themselves werent of much importance. tara wanted me to work for her... but i didnt wake up early enough. the other two were from aaron and sean. my vices. aarons IM was simply ".." while seans was more touching and significant. the turmoil will never end. but thats alright. i try to see it as something good and not let my heart be hurt every time i think about it. because it  is  good. and im glad for it.  i called and talked to eddie last night. he was busy though. so he said to call him today, which i might, but not likely. im about to shower and go to a company cook-out of my dads, then back to nederland so he can fix my busted car. lol. well, at least parts of it. good stuff.

       *sigh of relief that was never expected to come*     &nbsp;  my seanlynn just talked to me. i cried. in fact, im probably not done crying yet. just for now while i eat my chocolate-covered donut. so now 50% of the&nbsp;distress in my life is fixed and better. yeah, im definitely going to cry again. jeezus i miss him. i know, that i can be with someone and be perfectly happy but still wish that&nbsp;he and i could be together. its a sort of "highschool sweetheart" situation&nbsp;i guess.&nbsp;a situation i dont want closure from. i'll be happy living the rest of my life in love with him. (not to sound like a nut case or anything. you know what i mean.)   news here in boremont... there is none. imagine that! worked last night. i was supposed to work 2-6&nbsp; but our water got cut off and i had to go pay the bill. and then they wouldnt have turned the water back on in time for me to shower and get ready for work, so i had tara go in for me. i was pissed that i couldnt work. but THEN, on my way home from paying the bill, lauren called and gave me her 6-10 shift. yay. im still not getting more than 4 hours a week, but at least im working some.   school in 2 weeks and 3 days. what a disturbing realization. someone should be shot.   &nbsp;  "hand in mine, into your icy blues, and then i'd say to you 'we could take to the highway.'  with this trunk of ammuntion too, i'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets.  ...and i would drive onto the end with you."  - MCR

      hah, i just got on an old screenname and read the profile... i used to be harshly depressed. which some may say i still am. but it was BAD. i sounded so pathetic. ::embarrassed::&nbsp; yucky.   tonight... i went to bucky's for a little. woohoo on that one. then i left around 9:30 and came home. that was a bummer. stupid michael wouldnt come to bmt to hang out with me. and he claims that he loves me! pshT. fucker. but then joel called me back and he got home early, so i went over there and chilled till 12:30. man i havent seen those guys in months. i miss them. paul is my sweetheart and joel is so talented it makes me want to cry. he's amazing. and now he's started playing piano, which is a weak spot of mine. its so beautiful. so now that we've finally gotten together, hopefully we'll do it more often. too bad school starts in 3 friggin weeks. something tragic needs to happen to postpone this traumatic experience, but only to where we still get out at the same time at the end of the year. haha. yeah right.   hopefully mason will have a better day tomorrow. my mom had to stay home from work today to take care of him. he still isnt eating, but he's not dehydrated. so thats good. he needs to get better quick, i cant take the squealing noise he makes when he's upset or wants something. (he does this because he tries not to speak because of his throat)&nbsp; its so unnerving. not to mention when piper throws in her high-pitched scream of death.&nbsp; wow.   i feel so unaccomplished, still. i do absolutely nothing with my life. nothing. im surprised i even have enough to write about on here. probably because it involves other people, not so much myself. i turned in my application at Carino's today. found out i missed getting hired. if only i woulda brought the appl. back within that week. dammit! oh well. hopefully i'll get a job there soon. i "have a good chance" since i have no life and all i'll be doing is going to school until 1. lol. all i wanna do is work anyway. so thats alright.   a lot of things, which i really consider nothing, keep my mind occupied a lot of the day. i think about things that really dont hold much substance in the course of life. but seeing how thats all my life entails, its hard to think of other things. i dont think i made any sense there...   "i just want you to know who i am."  - the Goo  (if you dont know who that  really  is... heh, wow.)

        for someone who would love you for you?       &nbsp; man, last night was a blast. tara and i went out to eat at Carino's. Michael was working, and he basically hung out with us the whole time. it was so much fun. i miss tara. and i miss michael. i love them both with a passion. i wish tara could hang out with me... thats so sad. almost ridiculous, actually. but whatever. people will be people, and i will be the scapegoat when there is no other. anyway, all the other Carino guys were working too. it was good to see them all. im going to put my application in today. last night Eli was introducing me to the manager David and he was like, "i know who she is. she didnt turn in her application."&nbsp; haha. so im going to do that today. i'll make sure to give it to David himself. lol &nbsp; this morning mason was having a really hard time with how he was feeling... so my mom stayed home. which i doubt i'll be able to leave because she "needs help".&nbsp; we'll see. i hope mason gets better soon. im sure he will, but this isnt soon enough. its been 6 days now. my little boy... &nbsp; its official, aaron is a jerk. love the kid to death, but he is a terrible, terrible person. haha. ask no questions.  &nbsp; well so she'll stop bitching, im off to clean the bathroom. what a wonderful day i have ahead of me. &nbsp;

      not much going on today. its 12:20 and mason's still in bed. poor thing doesnt feel well, still.&nbsp; piper's up and chirpy, as usual. she's so cute. wow, i've been up for a while, because it feels like it should be later. i wish it was.  &nbsp; i need to go out and look for another job again. i really dont want to though. i have an application to put in at carino's. so i suppose i'll do that. hostess jessie. bleh. we'll see. what i REALLY dont want is for the school to get me a job. because more than likely it'll be a sucky one. bleh x 10 haha MsPibb02: i need another job&nbsp; = ( RiDEtheL1GHTN1NG: lol apply at carino's MsPibb02: hah yeah i have the application sittin in my car.  RiDEtheL1GHTN1NG: and youre a nigger so you should get the job easy &nbsp; oh yes. michael speaks the truth on all matters. &nbsp; i wonder if eddie and aj are still gunna come see me. they'd better! they have a week after aj gets outta summer school before i have to go back to school. thats plenty of time. jessie will kick some ass if they back out. hmph. i love my boys.  &nbsp; i had a friend ask me last night how life was, and without hesitation i responded "life is... slow and complicated."&nbsp; which is exactly how i feel. nothing gets accomplished. things just... fade away. that doesnt seem right. the last feeling of accomplishment that i had was when i straightened the panty table at work. and even then i didnt really feel accomplished. i could just say i did because its such an avoided task. pathetic.&nbsp;life is so empty. i know what im missing. im just so worn out, i dont want to do anything that takes a lot of work and thinking. especially if its spiritual. ughh. &nbsp; problems problems problems. &nbsp; "i am flawed, but i am cleaning up so well." - dashboard &nbsp; &nbsp;

      once again, i am the bad one. and there's no being convinced otherwise. i can live with that. someday people will realize that its not always the fault of an outside influence that makes things happen. we are human.  &nbsp; though it probably usually is my fault.&nbsp; here we go again. &nbsp; yesterday i spent the whole day at the lake. well, after noon anyway. i got up at 7:20, took a shower, my dad came and got me around 8:15. yeah, he was late. so we drove to Sam...Rayburn(?) up in the northern part of Jasper. it was so nice. beautiful day, so much fun. im glad Holly was there. i didnt think i'd spend much time with her, but i did. mostly because i was the only one that would ride with her in the tube. that was fun. i have "carpet burn" on my left elbow, my legs got cut up from the tube, though they dont hurt... and i semi-twisted my ankle. (in other words, it hurts when i walk but im not sure why) and my face is burrrrned. it'll be gone by tonight though. so i had a good time! rodney damn near killed me and holly on the tube. he was ruthless. i only fell off once, and that was because i let go and leaned out. lol. holly fell out the first time we rode, and i didnt. i dont see how. it was insane. but the time i "fell out", that was the worst. it was so rough and he was doing all kinds of crazy stuff. we were airborne most of the time. not to mention it was a long ride because we were going to the middle&nbsp;of the lake to swim.&nbsp; oh wait, i got that confused. but it doesnt matter, so im not gunna fix it. &nbsp; today...  &nbsp; another wasted day. maybe i'll get to spend some time with someone though. &nbsp; i love the people that i love. they make me happy.

      so today was depressing. dont really know why. i just went on a paranoid frenzie and freaked myself out. ironically there was a joke made at the end of the night on the subject matter that i was spazing out about. i didnt like that so much. i wish i could make it known, my valid worrisom paranoia... i just might, tomorrow.  &nbsp;  i hate not being able to control my feelings. especially when i cant control them, and i dont understand where they come from, or why. not knowing "why" in any matter will be the death of me.  &nbsp;  there is something else i want to talk about, but im not going to. all of these things make me sad. i dont want to be fucking sad anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dammit.  &nbsp;  to hell with this. im going to bed. this didnt make me feel much better.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "though i never never never ever wanted this to be."  -CKY

      i just got done talking to an old friend, bobbi. she's such a sweetie. its always nice to "hear a familiar voice". im glad she's been doing good. it made me think of everyone else in virginia. i got super depressed last night. not exactly sure why. i was feeling pretty lonely. i really miss everyone. i miss how things used to be in my life, minus a few downfalls. i dont have another job yet, but im thinking... if i save up enough money i'll be able to fly up for winter break. thats far enough away. we'll see. i wish i could just drive up. but so much for having a reliable car.  &nbsp;  didnt do a thing last night. i ate and ate all day and all night. i made myself miserable. almost on purpose. i woke up this morning and wanted to puke. i thought i was going to. this morning, im not in that much of a better mood. only because its quiet in the house and im bored. with nothing to save me from my boredom. something's wrong with aaron, and i have to wait for him to call me back to find out what that is. i hope he's alright. he felt like crap last night and he sounded terrible on the phone this morning. he's my buddy.  &nbsp;  my dad called a few minutes ago and said he's going to the lake tomorrow. that would be good fun. so in a little, or when i go to work tonight, im gunna see how the hours are running, because im on call tomorrow. hopefully they'll be perfect on hours and wont be able to call anyone in. i havent been to the lake or anything of the likes in a long time. i want tara to come with me. i miss her. ive only talked to her once in the past few weeks, as far as a whole conversation is concerned anyway. we'll see.  &nbsp;  mason and my mom are still asleep. its 12:43 in the afternoon. i hope mason is better today than he was yesterday. my little trooper. i love him. i think im going to go clean out my car and then take a shower. do something with my day.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   "i want you to know that i miss you, i miss you so."

       yesterday wasnt too bad. i basically babysat until 11 o'clock at night though. and that sucked. especially since i had some fun to have and i was tardy. didnt like that all too much. i went and hung out, had a good time. except aaron left early cuz he's a loser. that didnt suck too bad though. i still had fun. poor josh called to make sure i got home ok and while he's playing the good samaritan by doing that, he's also cleaning up throwup from two other people. what a saint.   &nbsp; mason got his tonsils out this morning. poor thing. he's such a trooper. he's been sleeping since they got home around 12 or so. my mom said he was very brave. and i'll bet he was. i love that kid. i miss him already, and he's only been out for a day lol. soon enough i'll wish he was knocked out on drugs again. too bad i dont have them at my disposal. aaron and kenneth have been over here hangin out. they went and got mason some toys. so sweet. aaron's good with the kids when he's not acting too much like one. and kenneth's a cool kid. they'd better come back soon, because im bored and not allowed to leave.  &nbsp; hopefully as the night comes around, which yay it's already 5, i'll shower and then go out. she'd better not keep me here for the night too. that'll make me angry. it's driving me insane being home all day every day, again. and then getting yelled at because the house isnt up to par on being neat. its so tiring doing the same thing all the time. i dont mind cleaning up, etc. but when that's all you do, you tend to not want to do it. *sigh* &nbsp; i called ashley the other day... didnt get a call back. i wasnt completely discouraged, but it happens most of the time when i call. its ok. distance sucks. &nbsp; now im off to clean the kitchen again. and bring my mom some pizza and a coke. she just called me from her bedroom.

      another wasted day. (yesterday) and yet again another one today. i wish i could do more with my life. i sit all day, and do nothing. i cant even go out and look for a job anymore. by the time my mom gets home its 7 or so... by then im tired anyway.  so mason gets his tonsils out tomorrow. i hope that goes well. =(  poor baby. i need to get my wisdom teeth out. yay. i remember when jacob had his out. it was a pathetic sight. in stephanie's blog she mentioned how he looked like a chipmunk, but she failed to mention (probably because she wasnt there for it, but) how he would run to the bathroom with blood dripping out of his mouth, while i follow behind with a rag cleaning up the floor. he was in serious pain. i hate having pain in my mouth. i hate having people dig around in my mouth, so i definitely am not looking forward to the adventure of having someone cut my teeth out of my gums. who the hell decided we should have our wisdom teeth removed anyway!? stupid ass. they, apparently, had enough room in their mouth for theirs.   i sorted things out with someone last night. its sort of an "again" situation. but not really. i think things are as good as they are going to get as things stand right now. i feel bad that i was a catalyst to the situation that spurred the failing of a relationship. but im not sure that the outcome would have been much different, for had i not come along, certain things wouldnt have been realized within the nameless. so maybe it's for the best, and her relationships will go smoother from now on. i really do wish her the best. i think now that she's seen these things about herself, things will go much better for her. i really hope so. i have an indescribable caring feeling for her. i dont know where it comes from, or why. but i do. and i have no problem with that.  today holds nothing for me. complete and utter nothingness. its almost sad how i can sit here and think about what the day might hold, and i cant think of one damned thing.

      so this morning at the brilliant hour of 4:45 the phone rings. (i have the house phone in my room in case the call i was waiting on wasnt to my cell phone.) anywho, i dont answer it because its a blocked call.  then  my cell phone rings with a private call. holy crap. i answer it, and just as the last blocked call that i answered on my house phone (at frickin 9:30 in the morning, mind you) its someone moaning and breathing deep like they're... well you know. so i hung up. THEN THEY CALLED AGAIN. so i picked up and was like "stop fucking calling me!" and well, they didnt call back this morning. i hate that i somehow managed to meet a big sicko that has my home and cellphone numbers. i know its not one of my friends. i think i might know who it is. what a freak.  worked last night. that was painful. my back and my knees just cant handle walking around a lot... sounds weak i know, but i cant help it! sure when its time for  my  massage someone has to go home! bleh. well, i dont work again till possibly friday anyhow. even then, im only on call. how ridiculous.  i miss tara. she's been with lindsey all the time now since lindsey doesnt have a boyfriend anymore. that doesnt seem fair. i know they've been best friends for years while i was gone, but i was still a best friend... or so i thought. just kinda hurts. not to mention that i have a terrible history with people in general. specifically those that were once close to me. it hurts, but not NEAR as much as it would had it happened about a year earlier. im used to feeling like this. but i just didnt expect it, i guess. not with tara. i know i havent called her to hang out either, but she's been with lindsey all the time and she doesnt invite me, because i know lindsey doesnt like me. so i figured if maybe there's a day that she's not with lindsey, she'll call and want to hang out. but probably not. plus, i have a feeling tara isnt into hanging out and doing things we used to anymore. knowing there's manipulation and persuasion involved, tara probably thinks poorly of me now also.  every time im on here i think of stephanie. probably because she was the first person i knew to have a blog, but also because i know she feels how i feel quite often. and i love and miss her. and i wish she was here for me to talk to. what a beautiful soul.

      My Day: woke up, hung out with aaron and TJ while babysitting. which turned into me babysitting three boys (5, 17, and 21) and one girl (3). the youngest two of the four being my siblings of course.  i just finished doing the dishes, vacuuming, and making brownies. yum!  more than likely i wont be eating any of them. seeing how all of the mentioned above plus my brother and my mother will be around here sometime or another tonight. and i have to go to work in 30 minutes! damn.   fortunately i could somehow "talk" my brother into babysitting for a whoppin hour so i could make it to work in time. i dont see why he is so against doing something for someone other than himself unless he gets money out of it. its an hour, what does he want, a whole dollar? he hasnt seen the kids but once in like a week in a half, if not longer. im glad aaron and TJ are gunna come back and watch the kids. they'll be nice to them and play with them. hopefully jacob'll get over himself after half the time he's here and do the same.  i miss my va homies. i would call more often, but i guess i just assume (through experience) that i wont catch anyone. hell with it, i'll call anyway. i love them.  welp, im off now to get ready for work. WORK!!! im glad lauren calls me when she needs someone to cover for her. i need the hours.

      havent been up to much at all. sitting here trying to think of what i've done in the past few days, i cant really remember. probably because its the same thing every day. not that im complaining completely. i have a good time. i dont know. it always seems like its one or the other. (cant have it all)  wow. school starts way too soon. how depressing. not to mention i dont have another job yet. crap.  adding onto my latest entry... dont always assume you know what im talking about. i have a lot of similar situations in my life, and you'd be arrogant to think you are safe in considering yourself correct in your assumptions. like i said... im vague. for a reason, i think.  not up to much today either. mom's not working so i dont have to babysit. but what else is there to do? i took a shower. that counts for something, right?

      made myself eggs for breakfast. yum. i feel so accomplished.   crazy crazy stuff goin on. i hate not having control. or not so much that im not in control, just that when i voice that i dont believe something is going to occur as far as myself is concerned, and then it does, i feel badly or two-faced or whathaveyou. hmm, i duno.  notice im fairly vague in what i say. dont analyze. im not trying to put my whole life out there for everyone to read. i keep the details to myself so i can still feel like i have a personal life. i like to talk. i dont like to tell.  what to do, what to do. everything always has terrible timing. timing is key, and timing in my life SUCKS. because then i have to think about things and act upon impulse or desire and "work things out" only because the timing and order of events. damn the inevitability of things.  i want to say, that i hope im not hurting anyone. certain aspects of my life somehow seem to interfere with other people's lives, and i dont mean for that to happen. truth be told, i dont put myself in every type of situation that i end up in. and neither does anyone else. give the benefit of the doubt. its the least you can do.  anywho... ive been hanging out a lot lately. its nice. i like having friends. they make me happy. to just sit around and enjoy each other's company... i couldnt ask for more. then again, i wish that some people were there, that arent. all i have left to say is "oh well". i try. i know i try.

      MsPibb02: i was like half asleep and, i wanted food and something to drink before i went to bed, but i didnt get anything. and then icecream popped into my head as i was falling asleep. so here i am, eating  icecream. not a bad idea huh?  so, there was the marking period of the end of my night. basically. at this moment while im making my post im talking to the all-wonderful michael. and thats always fun. i love michael. all the time.   hung out tonight, im gunna miss amaad. its a shame we didnt get together sooner. i guess i've been somewhat anti-social, as far as hangin with new people here since i moved, in a sense. i think im becoming more outgoing. i like it. its fun.  my apologies for the squiggliness (ha, there's my made-up word for the night Amaad. it beats "unawesome") of my thoughts. there is reason for that... good reason.  today the lesser became the better, while the better became the somewhat lesser.    ironic what can all can change in one day.  i like having someone that likes you for "no reason" at all, as far as you see it. but they give you reasons upon reasons. and to know that they  believe  they have  valid  reason... thats what feels good.  its nice.   haha.

      yesterday as i was walking up to my dads apartment, i passed one of those huge black and yellow bees. it was struggling with all it had to get off of its back. i think someone sprayed it the day before because i thought it was dead. as i walked passed i felt sympathy for the poor bug. none of Gods creatures deserve to go through such unnecessary torture. as i was passing it again, i'd decided that on my way back up from getting things out of my dads truck, i would simply flip it onto its legs and hope that it would be well enough to take it from there. on my way back up i saw that it had already somehow managed to do the task itself, and i felt bad that i hadnt helped it soon enough.  i dont really know what i relate this story to, but its just one of those little things that made me think. you could look at it from many angles and apply it as necessary.  well now that i've given my unexplainable blabber, last night i didnt do anything. i was supposed to go to the beach with michael, but he didnt end up going till around 10 or 11 and by then it would have been late and pretty dangerous to drive. so i decided to just go watch fireworks with jayme and then go to lumberton. neither of which i did. we just chilled at jaymes place for a while... it was ok with me. i was tired. its not like i cant participate in the "celebrating activities" any other night.  im back at my moms for the summer so it seems. she needs me. hearing this motivated tear shed after i got off the phone. it was sudden and even shocking to me. but i guess it upsets me more than i thought.    heh...

      im so ready to go! hopefully michael and them are still doin the Galveston thing. because if they are, im there! i havent done anything for the 4th in years... hopefully this goes well. if not, ive got backup. so thats good. not that i look at my options as "backup", but you know.  so i went and saw Dodgeball. hugely disappointed... it was corny more than anything. a few giggle parts, but aside from that, its just another movie that got talked up a lot.   again, im only working one day a week for the next 3 weeks. they've hired wayy too many people. i resent that after being told i'd get more than 4-8 hours a week when the summer picked up. i have yet to get more than 8 hours a week. job please?  havent talked to my "friend" since that night, but i did talk to... someone else. and thats still that... we'll see how this thing goes.   do you ever feel like your life resembles a dripping faucet? you sit and watch the droplets of h20 form, see how long it takes for it to fall, and then see if it drips again, or if it's going to decide to stop...  i miss my VA homies, i hope everyone is doing fine. im gunna make a few calls the next time im at my moms. i did the other day. so much love.

      wow. last night rocked. i hung out with  my michael  for the first time in months. i miss him terribly. we hung out with some people he works with, and they're all majorly awesome. i met this guy... he claims he's a dork, but he's just like me in so many ways. i guess that makes sense. hah.  then to come home and see that the "friend" that randomly decides not to talk to me anymore - called me. so i called back, (to see what the hell he wanted) and we talked until 3 something this morning. impeccable timing. i dont like anything he had to say. because i know im going to hang out with him again. possibly. and he thinks its going to be like it was when he decided to leave, and its not going to be. please dont let it be...  hopefully the cool guy will call me today and we'll go see Dodgeball like we had planned. granted he was a little... under the influence of a certain substance, but he was still making sense. haha. its the best to make plans with people you dont know when you're intoxicated or what have you, anyway. funny how we made these plans before we even really started talking. awesome.   babysitting again today. working close. oh the hours im rolling in! frickin... hopefully a good night.  = )  we shall see.

      i love good music. keeps me alive.  so yesterday was a good day. minus about an hour, which is when i discovered its not safe to drive fast on the interstate while crying. or while being just plain hysterical. i was hurting pretty harshly.   cigarettes are bad.  one of the places i applied yesterday is hiring for part time, so i was told. i have to wait till later though to talk to the hiring manager. i hope that goes well. things are so weird right now. with all thats going on between myself and various people... and the fact that im actually trying to make plans for my life and decided what im going to do for me... i guess im just not used to there being room for things to change in my life or for it to be allowed that i make decisions for myself as far as what i want in life. its so strange.

      so, i havent been to school all week. i started getting sick monday, and by the end of the night i felt like a ball of shit. so i didnt go to school yesterday, and just to play it safe i didnt go today. which im feeling better, and am now wishing i would have gone. but i'd rather get better quicker and have missed one more day of school than be sicker for another week and possibly miss more school that i have already. plus, i dont want to feel the slightest bit sickly on saturday. DAVE MATTHEWS BABY!  though it is quite boring, being at home alone all day. my oh-so-concerned mother left with nothing but a demand that i do all the laundry by the time she gets home. of course this was after she woke me up at 7:30 to make the kids lunch and get them dressed and ready for school. i love having an irresponsible parent.  i'm realizing that for once, i think i'm content with who i am. i havent been longing to be someone else, or so much like someone else in a while. i havent wished to have someone elses life, looks, or talents. not to say there arent things in my life i wouldnt change. (well, really, the only thing i would change right now would be for tara's parents to let us hang out, and then to fix all of this school crap) but i feel happy. now i only get upset over stupid things. like if i dont get to see aaron at all for one whole day, or if he doesnt call me after hours of being preoccupied to let me know what he's up to. that and the fact that my mother still doesnt do much around the house and always leaves it to me to do things. nothing significant though.  rarely will boredom drive me to do the things i am told to do. which even today is not the case. but i am going to go ahead and do the laundry. i dont feel like getting bitched at today. i dont have the energy for that and then work at 6.

      i have a mosquito bite on the inside of the bridge of my foot. and it itches like hell. i can hardly walk on it sometimes because it hurts. aside from that and school, nothing else sucks right now.  except i didnt get home until 2 last night because we were at the emergency clinic with Mercy. yesterday her ribs started swelling, then it went to her stomach. she was huge. so when me and aaron got home last night we all decided she needed to go to the vet right then. good thing. the dr. said if we waited till this morning, her stomach may have, i forget the word, but... all but exploaded. her stomach was the size of a football, almost. so now she's at her normal vet today, and she's gotta stay there all day. i stayed home from school in case someone needed to pick her up or something, cuz mom's at work. last night i thought i was close to losing my baby. thats the worst feeling ever. anyway. this happened because she ate a tampon (somewhat funny) and it got stuck, blocking the passage from her stomach to her intestines. she's such a tough girl though. she didnt act like she was in pain or anything. boy, does she fit into this family or what?  so DMB this saturday!!!!!  tara's rents arent really letting her go. that sucks. but im really excited about who i did get to go with me. im glad i thought of it. casey moved to houston not too long ago and was supposed to come down this weekend, but didnt. then it clicked, that she could go with me! so my mom told linda to ask her (linda is my moms best friend, casey is her daughter) and she said she'd love to go and that i can stay the night with her saturday night rather than driving home at midnight. its gunna be an awesome time. so so excited.  well the deal was, if i stayed home from school, i had to clean up the house. and its 12:47 right now, i got up at a quarter to 12, and havent done anything yet. i'd better get.

      i havent posted in a while. havent really cared to. i actually dont care to right now, but i figured i would for those who dont care. i normally post to get things off my chest and give myself a therapy session. but lately i've been doing really good. im happy every day. so i dont feel the need to get on here.  i've wanted to avoid posting this because i feel bad that what i swore to one person wouldnt happen, did. but its ok, because apparently they werent meant to be together, and it's been long enough anyway... my point is, aaron and i are together. i guess we have been for a few weeks, but we actually just talked about it the other night. i've spent every night with him since friday, minus sunday night. finally he stayed the night over here last night, and gave me a break from having to go to his house lol. i love it that my mom loves him. she told him that this morning. haha. i was still half asleep so i dont really remember why she said that. she's leaving tonight to pick the kids up from FL so when he was leaving this morning she was telling him to take care of me and make sure i do blahblah, and he goes, "well i dont know about that, but i'll take care of her."  then she was all, "i love you aaron. = )"   its funny/cute.  i got my hair cut the other day. its cute. but i wish i could get it to fix like debra did when she cut it. ohwell. i'll work with it. i thought aaron would shoot me and tell me it was too short. but he keeps telling me he likes it. so thats good.  well, i think that tara and i are officially not hanging out anymore. her parents dont like me in the least and refuse to allow their daughter to grace me with her presence. that makes me cry. tara is my best friend and i love her so much. i know i have aaron as well, but it is nice to have a female friend. i dont like to have many, but i like this one, and i want to keep her. *sigh* i guess we'll see whats going to happen. either way i doubt i'll ever show my face around their home again. this is just too harsh.  i'd keep going about what's been up for the past week but its all pointless anyway and im sure not one person gives a rats ass. so im gunna go.
