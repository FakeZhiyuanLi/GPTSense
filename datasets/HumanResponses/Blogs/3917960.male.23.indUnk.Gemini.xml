       urlLink Chicago Sun-Times - Entertainment : "Although the plot survives sporadically, the movie is mostly about the rapport between Stiller and Wilson, who carry on a running disagreement about style while agreeing on most other issues, such as the importance of partying with sexy cheerleaders as part of their investigation."

      Welcome (again) to Seqential Crap.&nbsp; I have my own domain and server host now.&nbsp; It's like&nbsp;a real, live website!&nbsp; I will continue to put up my comics and other interesting tidbits for all to see.&nbsp; Maybe I'll even do it on a regular basis.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp;   Anyways, watch for some changes to the site in the near future and check back&nbsp;regularly for new and exciting comics.&nbsp;   Also,  urlLink Von's Video & Comics &nbsp;has a website in the works.&nbsp;  urlLink Tom &nbsp;and I (mostly Tom) have been working on it for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; We are hoping to have it completed before school starts, and to also have the blessing of John, the owner.&nbsp; Hopefully he will be impressed enough to pay for hosting; supposedly the Von's stores already have domain names with no websites, but who knows.&nbsp;

        This is my entry for Round 18 of  urlLink Strip Fight .&nbsp; The criteria was that each person had to write a three or four panel script using the phrase "Let's hope that doesn't stick".&nbsp; In return, everyone would get a script written by someone else (and you didn't find out by whom, until&nbsp;the strips&nbsp;were posted), and&nbsp;have to draw it.&nbsp; The script I got was rather dull; no character&nbsp;or setting description, and the dialog (as you can see) is a little weird.&nbsp; I tried my best to produce something interesting from&nbsp;the script and I hope you like it.&nbsp; The script I wrote&nbsp;was okay; a run-of-the-mill joke about&nbsp;a nickname, but turned out to be&nbsp;pretty funny (in my opinion) because the artist&nbsp;did a weird thing with the art.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll just have to check out the Strip Fight website to see what I mean.&nbsp;

       urlLink     A simple strip I did because I thought the idea of Jesus having a kid (in the modern times no less), and then that kid being bitter and angry, was funny. Maybe it's not.&nbsp;

       urlLink   &nbsp;  This is my entry for  urlLink Stripfight  Round 17. It's not that funny, but I think I did a decent job on the art.&nbsp; I think the third panel is the best;&nbsp;I was surpised I could draw that much emotion in a person's body.&nbsp; Also, I like the&nbsp;Secret Service guy reaching&nbsp;through the doorway.&nbsp;

      I wrote this for  urlLink Warren Ellis'  Fast Fiction Friday contest-type-thing&nbsp; (Rules for said contest-type-thing can be found  urlLink here ).&nbsp; Mine was not posted, but at least I tried.&nbsp; I guess he had over 500 hundred entries and was only expecting 50 or so.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;know why&nbsp;he would think that; he said himself that over 2,000 people&nbsp;read his livejournal and he gets&nbsp;around 4,000 unique hits on his website everyday.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I only saw a couple of posted ones that I personally liked, but it was all up to Mr. Ellis &nbsp;and from what I know of him, he's a weird guy.&nbsp; Anyways...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We took that dog out back and beat him somethin’ fierce.&nbsp; I don’t know  what  got into&nbsp;that thing.&nbsp; He was just a growlin’ and a barkin’ up a storm.&nbsp; You should’ve  seen  it; I opened that door and ol’ Molly was just a bawlin’.&nbsp; I mean just  bawlin ’.&nbsp; I couldn’t believe it.&nbsp; We had that dog for years and nothin’ like that had  ever  happened.&nbsp; Except for that one time, though.&nbsp; But that doesn’t count; that ‘coon was gettin’ all up in the trash and makin’ such a mess.&nbsp; Molly, though, she was probably just sittin’ there like she always does; rockin’ back and forth in daddy’s old chair, mindin’ her own business.&nbsp; I  swear , it’s like the devil himself got up into that dog.&nbsp; When we, that is me and my brother, finally got that ol’ dog out of the house it was like tryin’ to keep a train from runnin’ you over.&nbsp; My brother got the old broken ax (it’s head had fallen off last winter) and he set to workin’ on that dog like I’d  never  seen before.&nbsp; That ol’ dog, he’ll be alright.&nbsp; Molly, though, she sure is gonna miss her leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink     This is a short strip I did in the back of  urlLink Tom's  car on the way to a Wilco concert in Dekalb, IL. I like the way it looks, except for Patti; she looks evil and (she's gonna kill me, I bet) kinda ugly. That's what I get for drawing in the back of a moving car.  Check out a  urlLink review  of said Wilco show.  Patti is very beautiful in real life, by the way.&nbsp;

       urlLink     This is the first strip I ever did. It hung inside Von's Comics for a while, along with  urlLink Tom McHenry's  strip, "Batman: The Lonliest Christmas". His was much funnier. Also, this strip was supposed to come much later after I had the "Stan: Corporate Duck" series going. It was supposed to be about a duck working in a huge corporation, being hunted during duck hunting season, rising to the top as CEO, and then eventually being arrested and convicted of insider trading. Maybe someday I'll actually do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink     The latest  urlLink Strip Fight's  requirements were to use pictures or punctuation marks instead of actual words in the word/thought-balloons. I had a number of ideas for this week, but this was the only one that actually fleshed out. Oh, and if you can't figure out what is in the watch's word-balloon, it's supposed to be a tick.

      So I went to my first comic convention.  It was really fun, except at the end, when  urlLink Tom's  car got towed  and  had a flat tire.  I talked to  urlLink James Kochalka  and  urlLink Craig Thompson , and had them both sign my copy of  Top Shelf Conversations .  Also, picked up a copy of  Carnet de Voyage  by Craig Thompson and James Kochalka's hip-hop cd,  Punky Brewskies .  Then at the  urlLink Chicago Comics / urlLink Quimby's  booth I picked up a french graphic novel for a buck.  I think the best buy of the day was picking up the entire Cowboy Bebop series on DVD for only $35.  Tom and Dan were not so lucky, they both picked up some anime, but after watching them for about five minutes we realized the subtitles are shit.  It's always a gamble when buying Hong Kong bootlegs.  I'm going to try to sell them on eBay so they don't lose their money.  Here are some pictures from the convention itself:             Here is one of the many Hong Kong bootlegs that Dan bought.  There were so many booths with these.  I can't figure out how they don't get into trouble selling them.    I took a picture of this Ted Dibiase figure because of  urlLink this comic  by Tom.                A crappy picture of the Incredible Hulk himself,  urlLink Lou Ferrigno .    This was a pretty cool, and creepy, costume.  The mouth moved and everything.    Ah yes, the fine cusine available to us at Wiard World 2004.  Also available were hot dogs, sloppy joes, pizza, and nachos.       Fuckin' geeks.

       urlLink     Here is my entry for the latest  urlLink Strip Fight . The theme was "Where are you?", to be used in whatever way imaginable.  If you can't figure it out, I was going for a "Where's Waldo"-type thing.  This is also my first color strip. I need to learn how to use Photoshop more, because this was a pain. I don't think I'll be doing color strips that often. I like working in black and white a little more anyway. I wouldn't mind using gray scale in my strips, but like I said, I need to learn how to use Photoshop.

       urlLink     Here's a little diddy I found in my sketchbook and inked the other day in the laundr-o-mat.  Notice that it's called "Mallard: Corporate Duck" and not "Stan: Corporate Duck".  I decided on changing it to "Stan" at one point so it wouldn't get confused with " urlLink Mallard Fillmore ".  Oh yeah, and I can't draw guns very well.

       urlLink     Here is my submission for the latest  urlLink Strip Fight . I started out doing something completely different; I was going to do a seven panel strip based around a withering apple. Because of time restraints, though, I only got two panels done. So I came up with this silly little strip and put it down in my sketchbook.
