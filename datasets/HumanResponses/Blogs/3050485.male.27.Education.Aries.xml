       Friday, March 26, 2004 I woke up quite late. I am still feeling a bit grumpy with the weather. Boy is it hot.  My girlfriend called me up early in the morning. I could not recall what she said except that she is going to march for the graduation. That is cool for at least one of us is able to finish graduate studies. I wish I could say the same for myself.  Often, I find myself wishing I were in other places, in other time, in a parallel world where things are better.  I know that I have to do something with my thesis-- and fast. I say that to myself to the ninth time. By grace of God, I know I will finish that thing probably just out of sheer persistence. I must otherwise I am in a deep fix.  Thus, I ate breakfast late. Health is something I should put more investment in. Admittedly that is not one of my strong suit. I am a slob. Well, a good one at that. I love books but I cannot seem to have all the time and the energy to read my collections. I think by now I have already thousands of books. My collection probably costs hundreds of thousands of pesos. Still, I am always short of money. Pauper, yet well feed, that is me, a walking irony, just like some of my books.  My neck also hurts. What else hurts? I could think of many sore muscles in my body. Indeed the mind is willing but the body is weak.

      I am writing this while I am naked. Although I just took a bath, the temperature sure feels like hell.  Summer time in the Philippines is when everything comes to a standstill or at least in a slow motion mode. After all the school is off and students have already gone home. This the the season when scorching heat of the sun inflicts its brunt on everyone, many are either feeling sleepy or just plain out of energy. I am no exception. The best that I could do to make the heat bearable is to focus the fan to me and take baths as often as possible. I just wish I had an air con, however wishful thinking that may sound for I could never afford one.  Anyway a lot has happened these past few months. It is funny that I want to recollect my thoughts and the events that have transpired in my life while I am in my naked glory. Not that I look good, no siree, unless you are one of those whose fetish is to see Shrek naked, it is just that I don’t get to do this-- in fact I haven’t done this at all.  While writing this I wonder if my neighbors could see me. Just to be in the safe side, I turned off the lights. They may accused me that by parading in my entire glory I lost my sanity or is doing some satanical ritual or worse reduced myself to a pervert. At this point, I don't care what they think.  I am here because it is hot and I want to write. Period.  Awhile ago I was watching the television, and I was incensed what our current congressman said in his interview. He claimed, or he made it sound, that he was the one responsible for the many infrastructure projects in our area. For me that sounded delusional. Lest he forget, the money spent on such projects came from the people, in fact the only thing a conressman could do is allocate the people’s money, serve as a conduit and nothing more. It doesn’t take a genius to do that. The spoil system is Philippine's politics. I don’t see any reason why he should boast of such as an achievement.  While it is already hot in the Philippines, the election further ticks me off. The set of candidates we have both for local and national election are miserable, sorry excuses for human beings, if they are at all humans. Most do not know what they are running for, what they want to do, and what made them run in the first place, except, obviously, to gain power. Who cannot feel cynical about this whole charade? I cannot stomach it and dare say I refuse to accept it. I mean I can be naked while writing this but I feel extremely violated, even humiliated whenever I hear these candidates speak to toil themselves to high heavens. All words that come out of their mouths are filth, lies and deception devised for us to believe them, taking us as fools, morons, stupids, dregs. Why, I ask is it that our congressmen are obsessed with infrastructure projects when their real jobs are in legislature?   Kickbacks, anyone?  The patronage politics has led us nowhere, and it seems that this is the very carrot that they offer the voter this coming election. It is a painful reality that makes me shiver, a cold fact that jolts me out of my comfort zone and throws me into deep panic.  Election is when all that stinks is gleamed over for the unimpeachable truth that it is all a play, an illusion, when all of us are taken for a ride, and, lo and behold, we thoroughly enjoy the experience, not knowing any better, not knowing the difference of a good leadership from a bad and deceitful one. It is surreal, and by golly, it makes me feeling sick.  Elections in this country is something I hate if only for the reason that I have to agonize over its poison reality that it cannot be changed with a make believe magical wand, and that truly, no change, at least the good ones, seems imminent. The old system persists. It is a sad, sad world. There is no magical silver bullet to address this problem and sometimes finding a solution to what plagues this country is overwhelmingly futile.  Now, I know that I am sweating and naked, well, these too are also out of the ordinary. I stare at my monitor, hoping that in the end I made sense, I pray that at least I appear sensible. Never mind that my congressman is deluded, or that election in this country is a poor excuse to claim itself a democracy. Finding myself naked and alone in this room are just two of those few things I can afford to do out of sheer lunacy, say even, as my own sign of protest against these seriously dirty traditional politicians whose existence we could happily do with out.  I say in closing that the weather is hot-- but the politics in this country sure stinks like hell.

      yes!!! ok, i didnt exactly ace the persons exam but at least i feel that i was able to salvage some crucial points. i had to re-write my answers many times. the questions were difficult and tricky. good thing i am a teacher, i sensed where the dean was coming from, i suspected sneakiness, so, there was no other option but to stretch my gray area and to analyze fully the questions.   some pointers here are proper. publication is essential for a law to be effective no matter what. the executive order 200 that amended art. 2 of the civil code became only effective in 1988. rights are also, in general, subject to waiver as long as it is not contrary to laws, public order, public policy, morals and good custom. in that question, i thought it proper it is within his right anyway his father already died and the waiver is not against those grounds cited. future waiver is prohibited but the right was already ripe... etc, etc.... in sum, the exam was an intellectual exercise, at least different from that statcon exam ( by the  way latin is a dead language) which left me reeling with those statutory principles(harharhar).   now to make fun of the statcon exam...  i say that atty.culling should liberally construe the answers and the instructions in favor of the students. the general rule as stated in the first part of the exam is to put  ALL  answers in the booklet. at the latter part of the questionnaire, answers should be written at that very questionnaire. talking about ambiguity. asnwers should also be written at separate pages, but what about those true and false part. waste, waste, waste of paper. point is, the instructions are ambiguous. in article 3 of the civil code it states that "ignorance of the law excuses no one"  but tempered with the concepts of mistake of fact( exempting?) and mistake in the interpretation of the law( mitigating). statutory construction is fun, my golly, it makes me deliriously insane.   another thing, the teachers seem to like this for i dont know what reason. they said that they would give some objective items, but lo and behold, almost all was essay questions. as to the coverage, the dean said only until article 34 of the civil code, but why include article 36? it is abuse of rights( art 19,20, 21). i wonder if i file a case againts these teachers the case is justiciable? see what this stupid law school is doing to my mind.   and did i ever mention the grammar. forget it, i refuse to incriminate myself. :P  noel, how many dinners do you owe me now? i am not talking about libis here, just good food man.  i miss joy. we were together in sseayp. she married a korean so she is now in korea. yesterday was nanay's bday( my national leader). i sent her a text. she should get married by now. i was also not able to go to cavite yesterday to visit the new batch because of the exam. well, hopefully next week i could go with them.  i enjoyed my jog around amoranto stadium last night. i am planning to buy a ball so that i could play basketball in there. jogging unstress my system. it is fun, cheap, and healthy. food intake is a bugging problem. sigh. at least i am going somewhere, as to where, well, as they say only God knows.    laws are for the stupid people. people are stupid. that should make us all happy.  Ah, the humanity.

      last night i was stuck in traffic for two hours. literally my butt was in pain. i saw two people who get into a heated argument because of a traffic altercation. i hate it when people flare up or become unreasonable. i arrived at the house almost 10:00 pm. feeling all weary, i tried reading my civil law books in vain. i fell asleep at 11:40 pm.  my life today centers around marriage. well this is the content of exam. i will read more after this blog spot doodle.   i feel distressed when i see young people smoking. isn't there a law that prohibits selling cigarretes to minor? it seems  though that this law is ineffective for apparently no one cares. according to this law cigarette vendors should be situated at least 200 meters away from the university/school. obviously this law is also in reality non-existent. i ask what are laws for if not properly observed or implemented.   dura  lex sed lex my foot!     unlike in singapore where laws are strictly implemented, here in the Philippines there is wanton disregard for the law. when i was in singapore last year i was conscious of not violating any law for the fines were exorbitant. imagine paying $500 dollars for littering.  in the philippines we treat the entire street as a vast trashcan. throw your refuse at will. anyway one could never find trashcans. this is the price of uncurbed democracy.  anyway smoking for the youth really ought to be properly regulated. also when i was walking home i saw children sniffing rugby. where is the dswd? those children are the future of our land, and look where they are now. indeed the situation is quite pitiful. i feel bad knowing that the lives of these children are wasted. why is it that we, more often than not, simply ignore them, treat these children as mere vagrants and nuisance, just dirty and burdensome dregs of society. maybe they are, i thought to myself, and one reason is probably because we allow the situation to persist. we are oblivious. we treat these people as if they are invincible. but the poor, the dirty and the marginalized are constant fixture in our society and something must be done to help alleviate their problem. hallow words do not amount to anything.    "something must be done", and i say that to myself convinced that at the moment what i say are mere words lacking in action.

      curses!!!  i mean ok i didnt do as well with my freaking statcon subject. shame is on me for refusing to memorize the dead language--latin terms--costing me, i hope not, and god forbids, 20 darn points for this exam.  just some thoughts. why is it that erasures are forbidden and by golly the instructions the teacher gave was-- of all irony--ambiguous. the questionnaire said all answer must be in the booklet but later on he said that we should instead encircle our answers and write it on the questionnaire. well, teachers are human too, i should know, i used to be one. is this karma? hehehe. anyway, suffice to say i enjoyed again answering the essay questions. i am not sure though with the question concerning the franchise and the tax law. i put in my answer that the franchise is controlling. although what was said in the franshise law was 20% while the tax code asked for 20% gross sale, i think effort to harmonize the two would result to double taxation. oh i am torturing myself with this.   tomorrow is civil code day. i hope to do better in this subject. tonight i am going to stay late reading. at least i only have two more subjects to go, after that i could enjoy myself once more.  drew asked for a picture to be submitted tomorrow for sseayp tour guides. he just texted me yesterday. i am pressed for time and i need some break.i am thinking if i cant submit the picture to forego the opportunity to serve as tour guide for this year. i promised myself to attend the ship reception dinner though. i miss sashimi and miso soup. i miss the unlimited ice creams and sake. i miss saying ohayu. and maybe this time i would really go to grand bath naked and frolick with all those uncircumsized PYs.

      legal writing is normally bad writing. reading cases makes my head spin. most legal decisions are just awful, save of course decisions penned by isagani cruz. why is that? i guess the intent is to mystify the law, make it sound esoteric so that normal people would end up with a numbing head ache, and thus leave all the legal deciphering to lawyers. honestly, why not call a spade a spade directly without resorting to inefficient and ineffectual legalese? why not say white when the color is white, and not anymore slip to mumbo jumbo bullshit that really is just specious and stupid. i wish they cut all the crap, make it all simple, in that way more could appreciate the law.   i remember one said that in law school if you cannot dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bullshit. maybe there is a need to speak straight yet with substance. in that way we could do away with statutory construction.

      i have an upset stomach. this is cool. for lacking any of other words to say i guess i am reduced to an imbicile.... which is not the first time. tonight, i will start reading the civil code. i am not really that concern too much with statutory construction, not because it is hard, but because, well, i dont have time to worry for it anymore. some of the cases in statcon seem easy to understand( save the radiola case which took me 4 times of reading before i finally got what all the fuss was all about) it is just that it seems that atty. culling  further muddles the issues when in discussion. he is good, by all means he is, it is just that does he intentionally make it appear more difficult? remember this is an opinion of a slave( err, a student) so this is not of any importance at all. i invoke my freedom of speech with this one if people are raising their eyebrows. i console myself with a sight that at least i am learning, even if this is the hard way.  To toil for the sake of learning is the price i must pay.

      i miss my girlfriend. i miss bicol and i miss the four pillars urlLink  .   of course, i also miss my jealous bed.   gad, this education comes at a heavy price. i gave up too many things for this. i gave up a chance to go to italy, least i would be absent for more than two weeks this august. i gave up the comfort and the unhectic lifestyle of bicol. i gave up my car and my motorcyle, my spacious and luxurious room(hehehe). is it worth it? i have no idea. anyway, i just want to vent some angst.

      the exam yesterday was quite a surprise. one need not study the provisions or cases, one simply should know a bit of literature and philosophy, plus, of course, a flair for writing. fortunately, i think at least i have a knack for those.  i wrote 14 pages in single space for my answer. it was a treatise i know. but then the question in the exams were themselves long and literary(sic). in short, it was an essay, an exposition of one's view, a polemic of sorts, which, honestly i enjoyed because i did not memorize. well, it is now done and over with so i have to study for my other subjects.  what grade will i get, que sera sera.  i am now again in the library. i decided to come here because the sight of my bed is too inviting to resist. at least here, i hope i am right in this, i could resist closing my eyes. anyway i just have to make the most of out of it and do my best.  funny that the question in poli centered around a certain character whose name was quixote. maybe gorospe has a running battle against his "own percieved" windmills. i wonder who is his appointed amuse?   :) interesting.

      stupid. that is what i call myself at the moment.  i thought that today, monday, the uniform for the day is blue. so it was to my surprise when i arrived in the library that i noticed that most were wearing white. my god, i wore the wrong color for monday. considering that we were told during orientation that there would be 10 point deduction for improper uniform, there was nothing for me to do but to rush back to my room in roxas and quickly changed.  right now, i am back in the library. i guess stupid is what i really i should call myself today. my fingers are crossed that i would have a better luck for my exams later.  ciao

      today is our day of reckoning. i did not memorize for the exams. honestly i don't like memorizing. anyway i hope at least i don't flunk, better yet, to be more optimistic about it, that i would do well.  so it is political law for today. what more? hmmm.... i think it is time to get off from the internet and do  some honest to goodness reading. procrastination is my middle name.  : )

      Adriene,  I love your essays and I could easily relate to most of your experiences,especially those that have hints of angst. Keep it up. I love reading your works so much I make it a point to access your website whenever I have the chance.   Another thing, I would like to dispel your idea that no one misses you. Yeng and I do miss you, big time. As I have said, I haven’t seen anyone yet who could compete with your infectious smile, those wide grin that makes your eyes almost invisible. Even until now, in my memory, I could still picture how you smile. Call me biased, well, admittedly I am, but next to the Petronas Towers, your smiles should be declared as another national treasure. Truth is, I remember Malaysia fondly not so much with its nice sceneries, yes those too were quite impressive, but more than anything, it is the warmth and the friendship that you, Raymond, and the rest of the MPYs extended to us which made Malaysia quite dear to our hearts.So, much are we separated with distance, for what it is worth, we miss you.   Youalways  have friends here in the Philippines, and we would love to have you back anytime--but hopefully in the soonest time possible.Take good care of yourself. And I heard that you are celebrating your birthday. Hmm. That makes both of us Aries. :)Cheers,Chris
