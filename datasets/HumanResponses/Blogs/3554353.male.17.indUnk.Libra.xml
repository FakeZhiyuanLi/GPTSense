      went for throwing training today... trained with daniel and leon... daniel wuu an ex-canoeist... i think he's a pretty nice guy... a motivator, and someone who inspires... early part of training was throwing as usual... my throws are not improving as they should be as much as i hope that they will... later part was weights training,where daniel actually taught me some of the exercises that he does... i think they are pretty useful... and it was one of the few times i actually did free weights... yeah think free weights are pretty good for building strength... shall try to do more during this hols and make myself better... this is the 1st time i actually enjoy training more... like someone there to talk cock and training just feels better... haha... and daniel said something about determination... it's all in the mind... that's very true... u need to be focused and work gradually towards your target... i really respect him as a good senior and friend... leon's a nice guy too... such a pity he's not doing discus this year... but yeah... will train hard with them and not let mr quek down who has been such an excellent and nice house and cca and PE teacher... have to start studying soon.... Argh.....

      it's not about revenge it's not abt vengance... it's a form of punishment when under certain circumtances the law cannot handle... went to watch the punisher with my primary sch friend david... haven seen him for 1/2 a year already... so was really glad to meet up with him again... he came over my house to stay overnight on sunday in the end and we talked a lot... he's still pretty much the same... in terms of mindset and lifestyle... but i think i have changed... i am different... many things have since happened to me during this period half year... it surprises me that i have changed that much... maybe i should just follow what he says....... Be the old me...

      Hihi... this is the new blog i have created... FOD so sian liao... haha so came over to do this blog... will go do it up later... Triple S is finally over!!! haiz... from the start i forsee the problems of the project... those pple were just not very cooperative but still like yiling said we have pulled thru! the camp was initially a very disorganised one... with only 26 intellectually diabled participants turning up well 20 participants did not turn up while some befrienders also pulled out from the start... i was quite disappointed i guess... money is not easy to get and think of the surpluses of food and t-shirts... the whole project cost us about 2900 bucks... must thank james, kelly and bernard's father for being so generous in sponsoring us a fair bit of this project.. yeah the 1st day i was still feeling quite worried abt money and stuff... but eventually still managed to solve it... i must really say that the befrienders did their part and they really tried their best in interacting and befriending the participants even though some was a bit slack at some point in time... but i guess that was due to the lack of participants and not entirely their fault... so i was a bit pissed when yin hua and biquan kept telling me how the befrienders were not doing anything... the befrienders as i have said did try their best... especially pple from 04S11 like bengz, daryl, kaifen, weifang, steph... and pple frm 04S14 pearlyn yuhui jiahui and those from S13... too much to name man... and of course my own fellow house reps chiitarng, fu qiang, lydia zhaoxiu, peiying, huili, ek kiat,jianhong etc... and of course others like mervyn andy pei hua bernard junlin dominic jiansheng yiling shawn lee kelly zhudong who has really been a great help to me throughout this project... i think the rockclimbing part on the 2nd day was when the participants really enjoyed themselves all the pple attempting to pull the participants up... was really touched when i myself was climbing the rockwall and both participants and befrienders were cheering me on... i could really feel the warmth from the participants... in the end we rounded off the whole camp with the presentation of the triple s t-shirt to the participants and befrienders.... Life is not just about CIP hours and enrichment points... it's more than that... words cannot discribe my gratitude for all those who have helped out in this camp... i just want to say a big THANK YOU

      wah.... time really do fly it's already friday and tmr's gonna be a wkend.... that means my mock exams prelims and A levels are getting ever so nearer..... ahhh...... though i can't hope for it to end soon...... i wld have to turn mugger for the next few weeks... hahaha..... &nbsp; so what happen in this 5 days of sch? actually i dun remember very clearly except for yesterday and today.. i only remember myself not getting to go home b4 sun set almost everyday other than on wed when i left immediately after training and after reaching home having dinner and bathing i was almost knocked out immediately... and i went to sch early almost everyday.... hhaha i only remembered doing a pubstunt on tuesday? yeah and someone asked me if "IT" was fake..... no loh "IT" is real k!!!!!!! hahahha if u dunnoe wat "IT" is.... is my chest... hahhaha &nbsp; so yesterday was actually a more interesting day for me... cos i ended early at 1.20!!!! so cool right? and i just asked mervyn if he wanted to go sakae so i can use eating to forget everything and anything..... haha and in the end james and kat went too... and we ate damn lots of sushi and james said he felt like going again next week cos he's addicted to it... haha... stupid james challenge me and merv to play the no. game&nbsp;and to eat&nbsp;wasabi if we lost 2 consecutive&nbsp;rounds&nbsp;while kat went back to sch for squash elections only for them to put her aeroplane.... hahah.... in the end stupid james ended up having to eat 3 rounds of wasabi due to the telepathy as james call it&nbsp;between me and merv hahah... in the end kat wanted to watch windstruck..... but nowhere in orchard shows it anymore... so no choice but to call it off and me merv and kat went to fareast to eat ice-cream... haha and we talked abt lots and lots of cock there... funny sia.....  &nbsp; and today? quite an eventful day lah..... saw mr lee scolding davina my junior in the morning for not tucking in her shirt... so i thought mr lee was being quite fierce and i just made a comment hoping that it would make things better so had this to say in chinese "she's still young so she doesn't noe... dun scold her lah..." haha and i was told to shut up... so i just walk away loh... it's not his fault at all cos it's my fault... i noe that it's a serious matter and as student leaders we shld be setting a gd example... i guess i interupt at the wrong time so he wanted to see me during break... in the end i really learnt a valuable lesson from him... he told me a lot and made me see a lot of things that i was all so unsure of in the past... well well... but my maths teacher was damn pissed with me for skipping her lesson... but when u are in the middle of that kind of conversation, u can't really bring urself to stop it so suddenly... so it's nobody's fault and i dun blame anyone...... &nbsp; then had tranining in the afternoon and had this short chat with merv and shaun... well well... i am such&nbsp;a lousy ass.... nvm... hahha gonna go for now... feeling tired... ohh happy bdae to liangfa!

       yeah... i am dead... i just need someone to help bury me... life has taken its toll on me... haha....   hse reps kat, qitang, gabriel, fuqiang and shiqin came over to my house yesterday to watch the finals of EURO2004 between Greece and Portugal... Greece? did i make a mistake? with almost half their entire squad playing in the Greek league where have all the superstars from the italian Serie A, the spainish la liga and the English Premier league gone? haha... they are all dead and buried too... haha... greece is the team that would have cost all the punters their hard-earned money... i backed greece... though solely for the fun of it... and i won... while most of my friends lost... owells.... this just goes to tell u that ultimately no one gains... except for singapore pools and the bookies... so guys... kick that habit!!!  ahh... enough of that kaobeing on the EUROs... this must be the year of the underdogs... who else would have expected porto to lift the champions league? and Greece? ....unbelievable... ohh... the hse reps came over to my hse at around 10pm... while qitang came earlier... haha and we played SEGA!!! haha yeah... u haven seen wrongly... we played bare kunckles 2 or some would know it as street of rage... haha that's like 10 years ago... but i sure had fond memories of all these childhood stuff... qitang's feeling damn sian now... as i am too... but never mind!!! u just have got to realise that ur life centres around "URSELF".... not being self-centred here... but obviously society has changed so much that u no longer have much of a choice...   then it was mahjong time for the taitais and the uncles... haha... being brought up in a traditional chinese family... mahjong is no stranger to me... the funny thing was the seat facing the living room TV seemed to be the lucky seat that night... haha cos qitang and later kat would have made a serious windfall if we had been dealing with real cash... haha...  finally the euros... i watched for the 1st half and i couldn't take it anymore... so i fell asleep... but woke up close to the end of the match feeling feverish... ohh... bad bad feeling.... haven been down with fever ever since sarawak last year…. pop 2 panadol and went to sleep in the living room… cos didn’t want to wake the others already in my room… woke up at 7.20 haha… then kat and I prepared breakfast… made up of ham egg bread and bacon… and then it was off to sch… today is youth day… yet we still had to go all the way back… just for a stupid council investiture that i dun even feel i belong… but yeah my ignis juniors are v nice lah… and the others are also not bad… it’s not their fault that we had to merge… so yah… shldn’t unfairly put the blame on them… so we went for the rehearsal loh… initially supposed to have ignis JTS… but it was canceled in the end… dun really blame them lah… they all so busy… but after this guess they would be more busy than ever… so haha it’s so diff to arrange a time and go 4 a outing to formally get to noe our juniors… haha dun worry lah juniors… we won’t exploit u guys… a simple small gathering will do yeah? could do without the JTS anyway… haha…  then in the afternoon derek me kat jianhong rash peiying fuqiang russell went to heeren marche… lignum pple was also there… then kat encourage me to go home cos she thought my fever was really serious… decided to heed her advice in the end… thanks kat J and all others there for being concerned…  so here i am typing this long entry which my com hanged for around 5 or 6 times… bloody com… think it’s due to a bloody virus that i can’t detect… yeah am running a temperature of 38.7 degrees… think i am really dying soon… feel so weak now…. can’t go on anymore……

      hahha... as the title suggests... i guess u noe what i mean..... haha.... how sian can it get.. listen, listen and listen.. do u ever think they are telling u the truth.. u only noe what pple want u to noe.... that means that u only get part of it... and u nv ever get an accurate perspective so what's right and what's not.... it becomes worse when u put so much trust in them only to realise that u've been doing everything in vain.... so why in hell do u want to look for me? cos i make u feel better by covering up the truth due to my ignorance? haha.... ignore the crap i am writing here... i dun understand u... and i dun understand myself.... so dun bother interpreting.... cos u nv get anywhere by speculating.... how far do u think u can get by being nice to other pple? nowhere... do u even get back 50%? no man... u dun get anything cos they think u're a moron.... so what can u do? the best and easiest way is to walk away alone.... u are not escaping frm the problem.... u are saying this to the problem.. look there's no way i can handle u and the best i can do is to leave u alone while i can't stop u frm pestering me u can't stop me frm leaving u alone..... by the way "u" does not refer to any specific person or any grp of pple... so dun bother guessing.... and b4 u start asking whether i am ok.... "I am OK" yeah... haha i believe that in order to make urself complete there got to be a few components... u urself make up one of that component and others like ur friends and family make up the other components.... i nv had much problems with my own component cos it has always been small... but my other components that makes a large part of me seem to be failing me as i fall deeper and deeper.... i am searching for some kind of sanctuary... and there is this component that has never been filled and is hard to fill... no one else other than that someone whom u feel a special attachment to can fill... that is assuming that the person feel the same way.... well well... enough is enough.... all i can do is to try my best to think less and look at it from a straightforward view.... ignorance is gd sometimes... even if u do noe.. u can always pretend not to noe..... it's a form of self-protection... as long as no pain is inflicted on anyone in that process....

      heyhey.... poor bloggy... haven write for damn long man... well well not that i dun wanna write lah but it's hard to condense feelings that have been within u for so long into 1 blog entry... haha.... shall just write lah.. if not so sian right... haha oh well... i am sick and tired of being in my jc class and of having to face pple in the class that i dun wanna face... it's not like i really have something against them.... it's just the way they behave.... fair enuff they might not like me a lot... but that's their problem not mine... so when i get affected... it becomes my problem... hahhaa crap... yeah like dun u ever get enuff of pple not going for pe lessons? imagine in a class as small as 19pple when it's not even enough to form 2 11 aside soccer teams..... u haf 7-8 regular ponners and that leaves abt 10 pple left.... and guess wat? only 5 pple did PE yesterday... cool right? MY FOOT! haha.. dunnoe what the hell is wrong with them man... if they really detest pe so much they shld just apply to the sch to put PE out of our class's timetable so that i can go join other classes for PE and not haf to waste time doing nothing..... what can u do with 5pple? MONKEY? u think u primary sch ah? SIAO!!! and that's not all... that's just part of my bushuangness of them... but it's not their problem this time... maybe it's my fault lah.... but anyway shall not make too much of an elaboration... see no pt in doing that anyway... just to say that attitude plays a big part... and up to now.. i dun feel no attachment to my class at all.... and how are u supposed to do well in this kind of environment? hahaha.. recently friends of mine also seem exceptionally sian... mostly because of studies and human relationships and wat else can pple of our age be sian abt? hahah... i dunnoe how bad things can get for anybody and i noe i can't do much to change anything for anybody but this is what i have to say... just be urself and be happy! if u did wat u can and get 4Fs even if u tried really really hard.... that's reality... then deal with it and move on... easier said than done i noe.. but i can't help it anymore... even i myself is trying to train myself into a machine that shows no emotion to nothing.... not that u really have no emotions.. but u let these emotions affect u less... wellwell... read it as crap if u want to... haha.... i must say that i haf been real slack recently.... lydia is right... u must get ur priorities right.... to ct and cliff... all i can say is take care and try ur best... dun haf to give a shit abt me.... cos i am quoted frm somebody"just a pile of shit standing in front of other piles of shit asking them not to shit on me" hahaha..... i noe by now u wld have had enuff of my nonsense so i shall stop writing here and end off by emphasing this pt that most things done are irreversible..... so dun do it if u are not absolutely sure if u wld be satisfied of the result... yeah......
