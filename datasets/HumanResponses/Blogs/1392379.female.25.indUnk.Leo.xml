       Back from Las Vegas.....I had an excellent time.    Lots of......fun...walking....eating....drinking...    We drove to Vegas, only about a 4 hour trip. We drove up through the Hoover Dam...beautiful.   We stayed at the   urlLink  Imperial Palace   , which is an OK Hotel, It was mid strip in the middle of everything & the   urlLink  tram    stopped at our hotel so we were pretty in the mix of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;We visited most of the casinos. Ate a lot, we did the buffet thing while in Vegas.   urlLink  Sam's Firelight   &nbsp;buffet did we enjoy. I had an excellent time in Vegas.   July 28th  Today is MY Birthday...! Happy birthday to me...and all the other Leo's out there.

       Happy Monday!     &nbsp;   Back at work... &amp; for some odd reason lovin it. Did I miss work this weekend?  &nbsp;  My weekend consisted of Level 2 Bingo @ Gila River Casino. This was my first Bingo experience. For $27&nbsp;I played all night long. For about 3.5 hours. Didn't win... Not this time anyways,&nbsp;However it was quite amusing. First we were the&nbsp;youngest crowd in the bingo hall. I am sure people were wondering why 25 years olds were playing bingo on a Friday night.... Then there are these most adorable little.. itty bitty old&nbsp;ladies with their gazillion bingo cards (I don't know how they do it, I had trouble keeping up with my 3) &amp; their trinkets...I mean loads of trinkets &amp; dotters. I enjoyed my self. That night.  &nbsp;  Saturday&nbsp;we looked for a good digital camera for my birthday. I want an inexpensive, compact, &amp; good quality camera. I am leaning toward a  urlLink  PhotoSmart 735xi   , just cause that's all I own, HP. I'm still looking though.          &nbsp;Sunday...Ahh Sunday. Shopping...just a few items. Then lunch @ Rainforest Cafe. We had the Awesome Appetizer Adventure; Chimi Cha-Cha's, Blue crab delight, Crispy Caribe tenders &amp; Coastal Calamari. All was good.           A mildy uneventful weekend, but fun nonetheless.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
