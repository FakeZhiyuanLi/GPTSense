       Last night I was sitting at our local pub with a some friends, we meet them up there almost every other night for drinks.  Sure we are on a pitcher team for the free keg, but there's so much more to it.  It's not the beer or the pub that keeps us coming back, its our friends.  We all gather around a table, small or big, and we talk, and talk and talk.  Time flys by and by the end of the night you not only feel better because of the beer, but because of what was talked about.  We talk about anything and everything from politics to religion to our gripes about work.    That was the conversation last night, as a matter of fact.  It was a great night last night, its one of those times where you get wrapped up in what your talking about that the concept of time is completely gone.  It is just a great group of people to be around.  I wouldn't trade them for the world.    I am one of those people that likes to keep my real feelings inside, but the minute I disagree with something that you feel or say you better believe that I am going to tell you!  But this group of friends they help me, they inspire me, and they encourage me.  I open up to them like I haven't done to anyone in a while.    There is one friend in particular that I want to mention.  Gwen, she hasn't been a part of my life for long but the time that she has been there she has opened me more than anyone I have ever known.  Her knowledge, wisdom, and kindness is amazing.  Every word she says comes from her heart, she tells you the gods honest truth and that's what I like about her.  There isn't any dancing around the truth, which I know I have been guilty of.  But she has in a way become my mentor/best friend/motivator.  She has had a huge impact on my life probably huger than she will ever know.  But I want to take this time to thank her for being there as a friend.  So anyways, the whole point of this blog is to show that its okay to let your guard down for a little while.  Let people in that you trust.  And once someone lets their guard down just once, step in carefully and tread lightly.  Because you want to come back.    Oh and Anna, my dear beloved kindest sister, I love you!  Thank you for helping me through some tough days at work and also in life.  Thank you for opening your heart and mind for me, it means a lot.    Love you all!

       How did I ever get so lucky?  I was one of those middle children that become the wild child to get attention.  The only problem was that I never got into trouble therefore I never got the attention that I needed.  Luck always interfered with how my life went.  All the bad decisions that I made always seemed to work out.    Even when I started making the right decisions the luck was still there.  This luck is still with me today but I have realized that it is there and I have the tendency to sit back and let it do it's job.    This luck has brought so many good things to my life, one of the biggest is my fiancee, Tim.  Tim is this man that sat next to me in a class that I was attending for the second semester because I had failed it once before.  The first words he spoke to me were a joke, it was joke that is used everyday, but for some reason it was funny when he said it.    He has helped me more than he will ever know.  He has helped me move on from all the bad decisions I made, he taught me to love again, and love life.    Many may think that this so called "luck" is more than just that.  Many may think of it as God, or a higher being.  But for me, it doesn't even matter, because whoever or whatever it is, I know that I am on the right track and this person or thing has been with me throughout my whole life.  I know that it will continue to be with me because no matter the bad luck or the good, I still pray and thank it for everything it has done for me.

       Is it possible to give someone too much freedom?…is the question that came up last night.  Very interesting to me because it came from someone who likes to have control.  Someone who has trust issues but still wants to marry.  Someone who is soon become an in law, so I have to be nice.  When he asked us, I was flabbergasted.  I couldn’t grasp what he meant by freedom, which he so clearly thinks that is possible.  He is talking about how much freedom he should let his partner have.  The thought that immediately pops into my mind is “what right does he to control her freedom.”  For me, I would never ever think about that because my partner is who he is and he is going to do whatever he wants.  For example: mooning troy on Saturday, three times.  I know its all-good fun but is probably something he shouldn’t have done.  If we were allowed to have control over someone’s freedom, that person’s life is going to change and obviously not the way that they would prefer.  I know that my partner enjoys life, friends, and laughter.  Who am I to take away that freedom from him?  So, before I get off subject, it seemed obvious that this question of freedom is based off issues of cheating and trust.  So, he sees it as something that he needs to have control of, but in all actuality if you see control as a solution of your trust issues, you’re headed directly towards problems.    The ever so controversial verse Ephesians 5:22, is something that I am struggling with.  I am trying my hardest to get some sort of grasp on it; I have read it repeatedly today, so I am going to take a small stab at it.  So many people have issues with the word submit, so I thought I needed to look beyond that word.  But, in all actuality, it is that word that has led me to this thought.  “Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.”  So I think well how does one submit to the lord?  Not that I have a lot of experience in this but I see it as accepting him into your life, accepting his word, and believing in him.  Am I wrong or am I getting somewhere with this passage?  I am open to all thoughts, anything to help me understand not only this small part but also the whole thing.  Ephesians 5:22-33.  So anyways, this passage was brought up again last night, and used in a very different way.  It was because of this passage that he was going to be able to control his partner’s freedom.  I wish this upon no one, and I am so thankful that my soon to be husband doesn’t see this passage as a control method.  Yeah, I am going to end it at that.  I look forward to your comments!

       Cry if I want to, you would to if it happened to you….Just kidding, I know that was corny but I am not allowing myself to erase it.    I know this is my second entry today but I have been thinking about meeting family that I never knew I had on Sunday.  The history of this is that my mom was adopted when she was young into the Gilligan family.  She was the only girl out of four, she was the only adopted one, and the boys always picked on her.  I will not go into great detail but they were down right evil.  When my mom grew up, was married, and moved on, she decided to look for her real mother.  She oddly found her is Omaha which was only four hours away.  I don’t really know the process on which it happened but at least seven or eight years later, she finally meets her brother.  Her one and only true brother.  They look exactly alike.  Just shocking when you look at them, so anyways, they have started to develop a relationship together.  He and his wife, one of his daughters, and their foreign exchange student came this last Sunday.  Its one of those really awkward moments when your really excited to meet a cousin, uncle and aunt that are actual cousin, uncle and aunt by blood, but you have absolutely no idea what to say to them.  You know you should have tons to say and ask, but nothing comes to mind.  Don’t get me wrong I loved meeting them and being around them it was just that it was awkward.  I know that with time and meeting them more, the awkwardness will eventually disappear.  But I guess I felt bad for feeling weird because they are technically family.

        Something hit me last night, like a ton of bricks.  Family is always going to be difficult, but its how you work through those difficulties that count.  No family is easy, not everyone gets along, and everyone is selfish.  It isn’t until they, hopefully, grow up, and appreciate who they are and their families that they stop being selfish.  It takes a true person to stand by and help them reach to that point.  You have to be strong, supportive, understanding, and unfortunately sometimes pushed aside.  Its when they realize that you keep coming back that they will look at and thank you for all that you have done.   So stick in there as much as you can, things will clear up and you will be happy that you didn’t push them away.  Also, last night I reached my breaking point with this whole not being able to sleep thing.  It has become so frustrating or better yet, infuriating.  People keep asking why?  Why?  Why?  And I think…wow what a great question…I have absolutely no freaking idea why.  Are you stressed?  Well yes, but I don’t think its any different than other times I have been stressed.  Are you sad?  Did someone hurt you?  I am not sad and no one hurt me recently.  Are you nervous?  Excited?  I am a little nervous about church, and way excited for the wedding.  But it’s definitely not something that I think about all the time.  I just don’t know how I can be absolutely exhausted and so ready for bed and get in there and lay there for hours upon hours.  I count forward, I count backwards, I visualize jumping sheep, I meditate and relax every bone in my body……nothing.  I am open for suggestions, actually I am asking for them.  I need to get out of this habit; it is wreaking havoc in my life.  Oh and everyone who caught me last night, thanks for being there for me.  It’s so great to know that I have people like you in my life.

       This weekend was packed full of activities as well as emotion.  Saturday was a shower that I among others was throwing for my friend Katrina.  Her wedding is in December, I am so happy for her and Josh.  They really have become good friends over the years and even though they live more than ten hours away, I still consider them to be among my good friends.    Also, on Saturday, I had wedding that was out in the middle of nowhere.  Tim was a part of the wedding party so I was attending by myself until the Wilson’s so graciously offered to have me sit with them.  The Wilson’s is a couple that have been married for 25 years…or so…just an all around fun couple to be around.  They totally made me feel comfortable and welcome.  It really meant a lot to me.    The wedding was absolutely beautiful.  I tried my hardest to not cry as Julie walked down the isle, that moment always gets to me.  Then to watch as they combined and swore their lives together was amazing.    Then on Sunday we had my last little sister graduate from high school.  She is about six years younger than I, but looked so grown up and beautiful that she no longer was little.  She is now a woman about to embark on the most exciting part of her life.  I am so excited and happy for her.  Sure, it made me feel really old, but she has her whole life ahead of her and there is no one to hold her back from that.  She is going to go far and I wish her nothing but the best.    She had two showers, one for the hometown and one for where she is living right now.  Obviously more people showed up for the hometown one since that is where all her true and childhood friends are.  It had a great turn out, where as the one that she had for where she is living now was not very good.  I could tell that she was upset by it; my only consolation for her was to take a look around at the people that were there.  Everyone was family, friends, and having a great time.  Be thankful for having those close friends and family whom you mean a lot to.  Those are the people that care for you and you care for.  The others that just didn’t show up are not the ones that should make you cry, it’s the loving and supporting ones that surrounded you on your special day.  We love you so much and we hope that you achieve everything you could ever want in your life.  If there is anything that Tim and I can do to help you, let us know.    Tim and I had three friends ride down with us to the graduation.  It really meant a lot to my family and Lynn.  I don't know if they told you, but having you guys there to help and support Lynn was amazing.  Thanks for being true friends willing to dedicate your Sunday to be with my family and Lynn.     It was an all around great weekend, especially when I was able to meet an uncle, aunt and cousin that i had never met before.  But thats for another time.

       This weekend was great!  Just all around good for many reasons.  One of the first foremost was a hand reaching out to Tim.  It was his brother that he has tried so many times to get close to and vice versa.  He called on Monday morning inviting Tim and I over for lunch, he was grilling out.  He was so nice, made everything, and went all out.  I sat and talked to his girlfriend from Houston.  It really helped me get to know her a lot more and in many ways respect her.  Tim, his brother, and dad sat out by the grill hanging out, talking and have a great time.  It was a good bonding experience for both of us!  But the peak of the afternoon was Joe telling Tim that they should do this every weekend he is in town.  I don’t know about Tim but both Heather and I looked at each other and smiled because we knew that this was going to be a good starting point for both of them.    Another good thing about this weekend was going to church.  Both Tim and I were a little nervous about it.  We weren’t really sure what to expect or how I would react.  We arrive and soon after so does Josh.  Josh being the nice guy that he is, got up for church even though he was out till three the night before, because he wanted to be there for Tim and I (I am assuming).  There was a bunch of singing, which I expected.  I am not much of a singer, so I choose not to participate.  A little afraid of people around be being offended because I am not.  But soon enough it ends and the message begins.  The message was a little abnormal for me, but don’t think of abnormal as bad!  It was good because instead of it being something that I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, I could instead use what he was saying in my own life.  The message was about giving more of yourself, at least from what I got out of it.  I thought through out the message that this is something I have wanted to do and this just affirms that it is something that I need to do.    One of the amazing things that taught me a lot about how much I have grown in the past couple of months, was Tim’s ex-girlfriend, Christa was there.  I didn’t know, I had never seen her before, but most importantly, I didn’t care.  Tim told me later on that she was there and even walked right by us and said “hi” to Ben and Josh.  She was part of the reason I really didn’t want to go to the church.  The fear of being inadequate was looming over my head, but that stems from so many things.  Part of the reason that I no longer cared what she thought or what she looked like was because I feel like I am finally accepted.  I was standing there with her ex, Josh, Ben and Ross.  All people that I kind of felt like they thought I was inadequate but over the past few months have shown me that they have accepted me.  It has helped me grow in so many ways, for that I thank you.

       It has been over a week since my last entry, not much has been going on.  I did attend church this last Sunday, and it was quite interesting.  I say interesting because they intertwined and compared the church with Shrek the movie.  Yes, they even played clips of the movie during the service.  Basically saying that people, like onions and ogres, have many different layers.  And like ogre’s, no one likes to be judged by appearance.  I can honestly say that I have never been to a service where the message was one that I could learn a moral lesson from, from my past experience I remember the messages being full of “church language” that honestly never made sense and still doesn’t.  But, with the service on Sunday, it was something I, as well as others, could apply to our everyday lives, its just getting people to do it that is the hard part.  This leads into my little observance:  I have always been a people watcher, Tim knows this all too well and at times has to tell me to stop and pay attention to what he is saying.  With that being said, on Sunday I observed something that I found very interesting.  I have to admit that I had one bad feeling at church, sitting directly in front of us was a group of girls, all skinny and beautiful.  One seat away is a brunette girl; she is a beautiful girl with just a little more weight than the others.  Not one of the girls from the group say a thing to her, none of them invite her to move over one seat and be a part of the group, instead they kind of ignore that she is sitting anywhere near them.  I am sure that all of this is part of the junior high – high school mentality of being popular or not.  But, I kept hoping through out the message that maybe one of the girls would get it and notice that she is sitting directly one seat away and obviously wants to be included and not judged because of the way that she looks.  I couldn’t help but wonder if the focus of the church is to attract the younger crowd (as many of us have been talking about), which is great, but I wonder if they are even learning and understanding the messages.  Just a thought and observance I had take it, or leave it, I guess.  J   So, we have been talking about The Cave lately, which is a church group for college and young adults.  They have been struggling with attendance and thinking about changing the structure of it completely.  I have been thinking about it over night, and from what it sounds like is that you want to do something that has never been done here in cedar falls or waterloo.  This is great, but risky.  I don’t really know much about church groups, I tend to shy away from them for fear of being sucked in and spit out because I don’t know how I will react and same with them.  So I guess my question is how do you create an environment where people, like me, will feel comfortable enough to come and want to come back?  I definitely don’t have the answer, but the reason that I have come back to the church service on Sundays is because I feel like I have made connections with the pastor and he always acknowledges and makes time to thank us for coming.  I probably wouldn’t come back if I didn’t know a couple of people there and the pastor made no effort to know who I was, and I definitely wouldn’t come back if I didn’t like or feel comfortable with the messages.  So, I leave you with the challenge, I have faith that you have the ability to make this into your ideal group, and I wish you the best of luck.  If there is anything that I can do to help, please feel free to ask.

       Okay so as many already know, these past couple of weeks have been pretty hard on tim and i, and i choose not to talk about it because i don't want to overstep on anyone.  So I am only going to talk about the good things happening in my life, believe it or not there are some!  It may have taken me about a week to see them but i can now clearly see them (notice: title).    First one being, today was great!  I came to work, i was the first one again the morning, which is really odd, but thats besides the point.  I was looking at my email and feeling a little overwhelmed, when all the sudden i remembered that tim and were supposed to go and get our marriage liscence!  This for me, for some unknown reason, was very exciting, partially because i got to leave work, and also because i knew it was a sign that the marriage was coming soon.  Even the lady who helped us looked up and said "congratulations."  At that moment i was so happy, all the money worries went away, and all i thought about was tim and i.  Its amazing how blurry things can become in a short amount of time.

       Hello again!  Its been quite a long time since my last entry, not that many of you are regular checkers.  Wow, these past weeks have been really crazy, not only at work but also at home.  Planning a wedding is at times very stressful, but there are always those moments when someone or something reminds you of why you are doing this to yourself. It is very easy to get lost in all the mumbo jumbo of things but when I look to my side and see my wonderfully handsome fiancee who hasn't left me during these times of stress that gets me through those moments of insanity.  Gotta love him!  So you may be wondering what the heck I have been up to or you just figure that I have been soo busy with wedding stuff, but believe it or not, I actually have not been doing strictly wedding things.  I had a wonderful vacation over the fourth of July, I flew out to Boston to meet up with two of my lovely sisters.  It was my third time flying, but my first time flying alone.  Actually it was the first time I had done anything alone in quite some time.  Everything went smoothly and I actually enjoyed it, I sat and read, slept, and met people that I probably would never had talked to if I hadn't gone alone.    Boston is an amazing city, with some amazing people, at least the one's I met.  Of course you all know Sara is a pretty amazing person so just imagine her friends.  We walked (what seemed like) everywhere there, I got to see Harvard, the prudential, the harbor, the public library, the big dick (a bridge for those of you who don't know), Anna almost being killed by a cyclist, Sara make out with an amazing man, Laura almost get us kicked out of a bar, a woman who was in love with tuna rolls, Anna try to get counseling from a counselor at a bar, the smallest apartment in the whole world, some of the most beautiful parks (okay I will admit that I thought they were beautiful mainly because there was shade and they offered benches to sit on), Anna pee in public on possibly one of the busiest roads, Paul reveres house, Anna beat Sara at arm wrestling, and least but not last I got to drink with the Italian Mafia.  It was an amazing experience, I loved every second of it, well besides the dreadful four flights of stairs.    My sisters though, they are great.  It doesn't matter if everyone is in a pissy mood, we can always sit down have a beer and find something to laugh about.  Sometimes it is just a laugh but most of the time it is a hard core *oh my god I can't breathe* laugh.  Its those laughs that get me through life and I wouldn't change it for the world.  I miss my sisters terribly already, but I am definitely looking forward to seeing them in September.  Thank you Sara so much for taking me in and getting my mind off of the wedding, it has helped tremendously, oh and for those of you that don't know, sara's real name is spelled with an H, but I spell it without because I know it pisses her off.  Don't worry she does the same for me.  :) And Anna thanks for coming along and not being pissed because we didn't shop much, oh and also all the great laughs, mind, with you not at you, I promise!  Love you guys so much!  I can't wait for our next getaway!
