      1. What was your first Halloween costume?     I can't remember. I earliest I can remember was when I was in the 4th grade. That's     sad huh? Well, I was a pirate with a bandana on my head and patch on my eye. It      cute though.  2. What was your best costume and why?     I haven't had one yet but I've always wanted to dress up as a hippie with two big      afro puffs, bell-bottom jeans, and platform boots.  3. Did you ever play a trick on someone who didn't give you a treat?     Never  4. Do you have any Halloween traditions? (ie: Family pumpkin carving, special dinner before trick or treating, etc.)     Nope. Just dressing up and going out. Nothing special.  5. Share your favorite scary story...real or legend!     Still thinking...

      HAPPY HALLOWEEN!  1. Do you usually dress up for Halloween?     Sometimes  2. Do you attend any Halloween costume parties or contests?     No! I would if I knew of any.  3. How much, if any, Halloween decorations do you put up in your house or yard?     Very little. Just the couple of ghosts and pumpkins       my son has made at childcare. I'm sure my home will      be filled with holiday decorations in the coming      years.  4. Do you pass out tricks or treats? If yes, do many trick or treaters stop by your house?     I do. This is my first house so I'll find out soon. Lived     in an apartment and before that with parents. Plenty     of children went trick or treating in that area.  5. What is your favorite Halloween/scary movie?     Halloween movie: Charlie Brown's Halloween.        Scary Movie: Scream

      I love planning. My friend is graduating with a BA in Psychology so these are my ideas.  Theme: Graduate  Games: Karoke, Dirty Minds, and Spy  Dress up: green, yellow, or career goal. No costume, donate $ to wishing well.  Decorations: cap & gowns, diplomas w/ poem, streamers, green and yellow balloons, briefcases, and confetti  Keepsake Box: everyone needs to bring something related to psychology for saving  Collage: everyone should gather old school pictures

      Well, I was born in Houston, Texas just like my mommy. Lived there for about a year and a half then moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, my father's home town. By the time I was four I was a California girl at heart. I moved to the bay area around three and half and I stayed until about two years ago.   urlLink Googlism: jillian is a dream come true

      I become driven from many things. Among them are art, literature, film, music, photography, poverty, life, science, friends, family, and children. There is one special little fellow who especially motivates me to strive for the very best so that he can do the same. Jordan Rah-Nohn Spears, the love of my life.   urlLink Googlism: jillian is all about life

      1. What is your favorite day of the year and why?      My favorite day of the year is  Valentines Day . I guess you can      say that I'm a  ROMANTIC . I love being pampered with love and     affection, not to mention gifts.  2. Do you get caught up with the holiday spirit? Why/why not?     Sometimes. Depends on the holiday and the weather believe it or not. I love looking    at Christmas lights and making snowmen (have to go to Lake Tahoe for that). I enjoy     dressing up for Halloween and trick-or-treating. Who doesn't love eating Thanksgiving     dinner although my family will probably try something different this year and have a    seafood feast instead of the traditional "takes-giving" dinner. Easter egg hunt are      always fun. I should stop now, I guess I get into the holiday spirit for ever holiday.  3. Who is overrated?      Everyone with the power to make a difference but not making the effort. Popular     people in Hollywood especially. Holidaywise: Thanksgiving Turkey.

      Why do I feel as though I can't so anything with my degree except wipe my ass? I come across people everyday who have no college degree but are ballin'. I mean they are living in homes that are shown on cribs and driving luxury cars. This goes to show that college does not = success.   People working in collection offices are making more money than me and all the do is sit on their asses with high school diplomas threatening to report customers to creditors if they don't pay their bill within a week.   Don't get me wrong, I love my job and I'm very thankful that I had an opportunity to complete  urlLink college  but I'm struggling. I'm happy for those who didn't spend many years of their life studying a bunch of garbage that they will probably never see again except for leisure, but damn, I feel like my job is important and in demand so why am I neglected financially for my attributions to this  urlLink psych hospital?   Sorry, just venting. Maybe I should be questioning why my son's childcare is so expensive when he's only there for three hours a day. That's another conversation altogether.

      1. What vehicle do you drive?     Toyota, Camry  2. How long have you had it?     Three years  3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?     The radio  4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?     The plastic protector on the bottom of the front bumper. It scrapes against everything.     The car sits really low. I guess that's why they placed a protective piece of plastic       there.  5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?     Volkswagen, Beetle

      Jillian Camille Ruth  My mother was a soap opera-holic. My little brother and I both won the names of characters from  Ryan's Hope . Mine is Jillian, his Ryen with an  e  instead of an  a , duh.  Camille was my maternal grandfather's name. They were expecting a boy and I would be named after him.   Ruth, obviously my father's last name. It probably didn't start off as Ruth being that his family is Creole but after generation upon generation changes we've established "Ruth" as the final entity.     urlLink Gogglism: jillian is the daughter of paul and christina barben or "romeo and juliet"

      1. How many people and pets live in your home?     2 adults, 1 baby, no pets.  2. Do you rent, own or live at home?     My boyfriend owns. It is living at home, it's our home.  3. How many rooms are in your house?     3 bedrooms, 1 living room, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, and very     small dining area. There's a two car garage and backyard w/     a deck and shed.  4. Is there enough room in your house to comfortably        accommodate overnight guests?     Yes if they don't mind being in a room full of toys and books.  5. How close do your neighbors live? Do you know them well      and are they welcome in your home?     My neighbors live right next door. I guess a couple of feet,      the average length. I don't know them very well and I don't      think I'd get to know them well enough to invite them in my     home unless there was a good reason. Actually I don't like      to invite anyone until my home. I am OCD like a motha... My     friends are lucky when they get a chance to enter.

          Why do I love this new reality show on tv about Tommy Hilfiger's daughter and her best friend? I think Alley is an imtelligent air head. Actually, I don't even know if she should be considered an airhead. She's very eccentric and is passionate about life although she seems confused about where she wants to take hers.   Jaime is alright but Alley is my girl. She seems like she's has to be an adult as a child and it's finally starting to catch up with her. Jaime's mom is cool. I like her a lot.

      1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?     I like to shop when I have money. I don't spend lots of time      trying on clothes and trying to decide so it's not a hassle. I     can't stand shopping with other people though because I'm      a very impatient person and I like working on my own time.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?     Clothes for my son from the Nautica shop.      3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?     Online is always easier but in the store you can actually see     how the product will look on you so it's more beneficial.  4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?     I did. My father would send me $20 a month. My mom would     dish it out prn style. As needed.  5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?     Tickets to Portland. Although I got to spend time with my       boyfriends family, it was one of the worst trips I've ever       taken. In life.

      1. Who do you feel pity for, and why?     Poverty because although I'm not wealthy by any means, I     don't think any child deserves to suffer.  2. Who do many others feel sorry for, but you don't and why?     Animals. I can't stand to see a dog being better groomed      and  well dressed when there are people starving right      around the corner from where you buy you dog food. There      was once an incidence in California where a family put up a      million dollars to find out who tied their dog to the back of     their truck and drug it. WTF. That's just insane to me. Do     you know how people that million dollars could've feed,     clothed, or housed. I'm not saying that I'm for animal cruelty     but damn it, if a dog getting dragged can save the life of     just one child, I'm for that.  3. What is the worst thing you have ever done to somebody?      Laughed when they fell, cheated, talked behind their back. I     guess the list can go on and on but nothing worth fighting     over.

      1. How do you usually spend your Thanksgiving Day?     I usually eat dinner with my immediate family. Sometimes we go to other family      members house after we eat at home first. This year will be my first year away from     my mother. I even got to spend part of my Thanksgiving last year with her even       though  we were in Texas and she stayed with her mother while I stayed with my       father.  2. Do you have the traditional turkey dinner or something else?     We eat a traditional dinner although this year we planned on having a seafood feast.     Unfortunately, but not disappointed, we are flying down to Portland to spend      Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's aunt. I'm pretty sure we will be having a traditional      meal there.  3. What is your favorite Thanksgiving Day food?     Dressing, and mac n' cheese. Sock-It-To-Me-Cake for desert.  4. Do you stuff yourself or eat in moderation?     I eat as I normally would.  5. The day after Thanksgiving is suppose to be "the biggest shopping day of the year",      do you go shopping on that day?     I never have before but we hear that there's a great mall in Seattle so we will be     driving 3 hours to shop. I'm going to have soooo much fun. Yeah right! UI'm broke, but     I will get to see my first best fried Rikki.

List five things you do that help you relax.     Sleep, travel, listen to music, watch tv, and draw.

      When I was in high school my best friend would watch  urlLink ER  and talk about how interesting the show was while I was thinking how uninteresting she was. Well... I'm addicted now. I've been watching repeats Mon-Fri 10-11 am and 11-12 noon since Jordan was born and I feel like I know these characters personally. I've seen every season probably about two times now. I even wake up at 7am to watch it because I have the DISH satellite and everything comes on 3 hours early than it's regular time. I know this is crazy but I didn't realize I was a junkie until last night. I wanted to know who was leaving the show so bad that I watched my co-worker teeny-weeny portable tv. Watching tv is not what makes me the junkie. The way I watched the tv wsa what makes me a junkie. First of all, half of my body was outside the other half in because it was freezing. I had to hold the tv tilted and I still could barely see the picture. But the important thing is that I can hear what was going on. Gosh I love that show.

What is the fastest you have ever driven?     I'd say about 85 mph, never more than 90.  5. How many people you have crammed into a vehicle at one     time?     I don't cram. I like to be comfortable and I have a baby so     there's not much cramming with his big car seat in the back.

      So I've been having this headache for about a week now and I can't figure out why. At first I thought it was the start of a head cold because I had been wearing my hair wet and was beginning to get a sore throat. I'm over that now but the headache is still here.   I then determined that it was because my son beats on me with his toys and his big head. His grandmother always says that he'll beat the stew meat out of someone but come one, let's be real. He's not causing my headaches. Well maybe he is but we all know he's not that strong.  I grit my teeth when I'm cold. That could be it. I'm always cold. I work with a bunch of people who think we're in Brazil and keep the AC on when it's below 50 outside.  Well, I've come to the conclusion that it's from sleep deprivation. I just can't seem to catch up on sleep. When I compensate one day I make up for it the next. Good Night!   urlLink Googlism: jillian is a registered space clearing & clutter clearing consultant

      1. How does your room reflect your personality?     Right now my room is bare and unorganized because I'm     still in the process of decorating which is pretty pathetic      since I've been there since July. This is sooo not      representative of my personality. I'm what some people      consider OCD but really, I'm just into organization. I guess      at this point in my life I'm not really organized because I'm     looking for a new job (I'm sick of the swing shift, I'd much      rather be at home with my family in the evenings). I'm also     working towards a graduate degree in Forensic Science.      I got rid of all my bedroom furniture except the bed since it      was fairly new. I love it. It's made of bamboo. The theme I      currently have is calm. Lots of pastel colors: light blue,      lavender, and beige. Pretty relaxing, huh? Well, this is      something else that is opposite of me. I'm not calm , I'm      extremely impatient. I'm not calm either.       I'll tell you how the room I'm working towards represents     me at a later date.  2. Think back a few years. How was your room like then?     I was living at home with my parents at that time. Gosh I      loved that room. I had a huge closet, my own bathroom,      and a waterbed. Lucky me, right? I thought it was a cool       room for a college student. It was colorful and lively. I      guess it represented my party animal phase. This was     around the time I was initiated into my sorority and I was     very social then.  3. What's your favorite thing to do when it's raining out?      Watch a good movie.

      1. How long have you had your blog?     Since the beginning of October.  2. Do you post on a daily basis?     I try to but when I miss a day I make up for it. I'm getting      more into now that I've figured out how to program the     page.  3. Do you have a list of daily reads? If yes, do you visit       them daily?     No, my daily read is my e-mail which I do check every day     and more than once on occasions.  4. What is the longest period of time you have gone     without  posting an entry?     About eleven days.  5. Do you have more than one blog?     Maybe. That's for me to know and you to never find out.      Just  kidding. I do but they are all linked to this main blog.

      1. With the New Year fast approaching, have you set forth some resolutions or goals for 2004? Of course I have but I'm debating whether or not I want to share them with anyone. I guess the following are safe: [1] lose my stomach, [2] get a daytime job, [3] learn how to cook (at my own pace), [4] potty train my little man, and [5] gain a more positive attitude towards others (otherwise worded: stop acting  "Hollier Than Thou."   2. What are your plans for New Year's Eve? Party, party, and party some more.

      For the next year, would you rather:   1. Give up sweet foods (anything naturally or artificially sweet) OR gain 40 pounds because you didn't?     Give up sweet foods. I'm in the process of refurbishing my body.  2. Taste nothing but the flavor of oranges OR only wear the color orange (all the way down to your underwear)?      The flavors of oranges isn't bad. That's my choice.  3. Shout obscenities at every person who pisses you off (so loud that anybody within earshot turns to look) OR punch one person a month who pisses you off?      Punch one person a month. I need some practice.  3. Cry uncontrollably whenever you get a bill (at a store or restaurant) OR fart noticeably every time you laugh?    Cry from bills. Farting is so uncosher.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

      1. Is your Christmas shopping complete? If no, how much is left to do?     Yes. Well I guess no. My boyfriend needs to by his parents a cordless phone from me.  2. If someone not on your Christmas shopping list buys you a present, do you feel like you have to buy one for them?    Depends on who the person is and how much money I have. My best friend bought     both my boyfriend I sweaters for Christmas last year and my son a toy.  I didn't but     her or her boyfriend but I did buy her daughter an outfit. In my opinion, you do what    you can when you can.  3. What is your favorite Christmas special or holiday movie?     I did like the Osborne's Christmas Special on MTV this year.  4. Tell us about one of your favorite Christmas memories.  5. Tell us about a holiday mishap.

      1. Do you have a favorite Christmas carol? If so, what is it and why is it your favorite?  Carol of Bells  because I heard it performed by a children's gospel choir in the bay area and the voices moved me. The lead was little bitty thing and her voice was beautiful. It moved me.

      1. Change one thing about your hair.     Layer and streak. Oh, that's two. Oh well.    2. Change one thing about your sense of humor.     Laugh about funny things rather than anything.  3. Change the way you treat your parents.     Everything's good with my mom. Spend more time with my dad which is kinda hard      since he's in Texas. He's getting old. Oh, and send gifts out on time instead of     waiting until I see him which is only once a year.  4. Change the way you eat.     Balanced meals instead of fast food.  5. Change the way you manage your finances.     Balance check book, save a set amount each pay period.

      1. What are 3 bad things that happened to you this year?     I gained weight (but lost it thankfully), I became overdrawn with my bank, I lost one of my mother's day gift (diamond earrings).  2. How do you express yourself best?     Verbally. Unfortunately I blurt things out sometimes with out think of the wording first. Maybe it's not a bad thing to people who are not sensitive.  3. What do you think of life after death?      I can't wait to see what it's like. I'm sure I'll be something more productive. I was probably royalty in my past life according to some in consider my aura.

      There comes a time in every woman's life when she has to take a close look at herself. Not at her circumstance, not at what she did, not how unfair life is or not at whom made you do it. She has to just look at herself in all her glory and imperfection.   For many women this is a scary thing because often times they don't want to know the truth about themselves. Virtuous women know what I mean.   As women, we have a tendency to water one another down. Maybe it makes us feel good or look better than the next woman. Or maybe we just don't know how to tell that woman how we admire her. In reality we really need to look at ourselves and the pain we project towards other women.   Have you ever admired a woman who has been through changes in her life? Or have you made up in your mind that she is just messed up. Before you make this mistake, take a closer look. A woman who has endured the most unusual life is someone of wisdom, someone who has been chosen by God to go through things that have made her stronger.   Think of all the great women in the bible, Mary Magdalene, Ruth and Naomi, the woman with an issue of blood flow, and Esther, to name a few.  Mary was a prostitute, a very uneasy woman. But by the time Jesus was done with her, she was His closest follower. Esther was unfortunate in marrying an abusive man. By the time God was done with her, she had married one of the wealthiest men in the land.   Have you ever admired the strength of a single mother? Or have you made up your mind that it's too bad she had children on her own. A single mother knows no bounds when it comes to her children. She is strong and durable. Single mothers are strong, not because she has to be, but because it comes naturally for her to protect the extensions of her very being. Her love for her children is like that of fuel to a car. Most mothers keep their tanks full because they understand that if it runs low you could jeopardize the car and have problems in the long run.  Other women only fill it when it is needed. Their cars usually break down.   Have you ever wondered why some women are not approachable? Or have you made up your mind that she is just mean. A quiet woman is a smart woman.  She is valuable. She doesn't go off half-cocked and she won't be the one to argue with you over nothing. She just may even let you go on  "setting her straight" and politely back out without a fight. She doesn't let many in her world. After all, she has probably been through the fire and had to rebuild. So why let just anyone in? This is usually the woman that only has "small talk" and knows her place, which is away from all the unnecessary things in life.   Have you ever wondered why that woman is so loud? Well, hey she has a lot to say. These are usually our younger women who have to learn refrain. They are eager and unsettled. They do before they think, and they do not think before they talk. They just go.   Have you ever wondered about that woman who appears to have everything, yet is still very unhappy? Well, she doesn't have everything. She doesn't have personal validation. This is something that cannot be bought. This is something developed over many mistakes and challenges that have taught lessons of the unbearable.   Women are so quick to beat the next one down instead of trying to hold her up. Before you wonder, "What's up with her?" ask yourself, "What's up with me?" Why do I beat down another woman to build myself up? That woman could be my mother, sister, aunt, in-law, stepmother, niece, grandmother, great-grandmother, neighbor, friend, co-worker, etc. That woman could just be me.  Women are the carriers of life, not the channels of death. Let's build and encourage each other, as did Ruth and Naomi.   Encourage and Love, Forgive and Forget, and trust that the woman that receives this will be touched in some way.   May peace and love be upon you.

      Take My Son  A wealthy man and his son loved to collect rare works of art. They had everything in their collection, from Picasso to Raphael. They would often sit to gather and admire the great works of art. When the Vietnam conflict broke out, the son went to war.  He was very courageous and died in battle while rescuing another soldier. The father was notified and grieved deeply for his only son. About a month later, just before Christmas, there was a knock at the door.  A young man stood at the door with a large package in his hands.  He said, "Sir, you don't know me, but I am the soldier for  whom your son gave his life.  He saved many lives that day, and he was carrying me to safety when a bullet struck him in the heart and he died instantly. He often talked about you, and your love for art."  The young man held out this package.  "I know this isn't much.  I'm not really a great artist, but I think your son would have wanted you to have this." The father opened the package.  It was a portrait of his son, painted by the young man.  He stared in awe at the way the soldier had captured the personality of his son in the painting.  The father was so drawn to the eyes that his own eyes welled up with tears.  He thanked the young man and offered to pay him for the picture.  "Oh, no sir, I could never repay what your son did for me.  It's a gift." The father hung the portrait over his mantle.  Every time visitors came to his home he took them to see the portrait of his son before he showed them any of the other great works he had collected. The man died a few months later.  There was to be a great auction of his paintings.  Many influential people gathered, excited over seeing the great paintings and having an opportunity to purchase one for their collection. On the platform sat the painting of the son.  The auctioneer pounded his gavel.  "We will start the bidding with this picture of the son. Who will bid for this picture?" There was silence. Then a voice in the back of the room shouted, "We want to see the famous paintings.  Skip this one." But the auctioneer persisted.  "Will somebody bid for this painting. Who will start the bidding?  $100, $200?" Another voice angrily.  "We didn't come to see this painting. We came to see the Van Goghs, the Rembrandt's.  Get on with the real bids!" But still the auctioneer continued.  "The son!  The son! Who'll take the son?" Finally, a voice came from the very back of the room.  It was the longtime gardener of the man and his son.  "I'll give $10 for the painting." Being a poor man, it was all he could afford. "We have $10, who will bid $20?" "Give it to him for $10.  Let's see the masters." "$10 is the bid, won't someone bid $20?" The crowd was becoming angry.  They didn't want the picture of the son. They wanted the more worthy investments for their collections. The auctioneer pounded the gavel.  "Going once, twice, SOLD for $10.00!" A man sitting on the second row shouted, "Now let's get on with the collection!" The auctioneer laid down his gavel.  "I'm sorry, the auction is over." "What about the paintings?" "I am sorry.  W hen I was called to conduct this auction, I was told of a secret stipulation in the will.  I was not allowed to reveal that stipulation until this time.  Only the painting of the son would be auctioned.  Whoever bought that painting would inherit the entire estate, including the paintings.  Moral of the story???  The man who took the son gets everything!" God gave His son 2,000 years ago to die on the cross.  Much like the auctioneer, His message today is:  "The son, the son, who'll take the son?" Because, you see, whoever takes the Son gets everything. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, WHO SO EVER BELIEVETH IN HIM, SHALL HAVE ETERNAL LIFE...THAT'S LOVE

      1. How many Christmas parties will you be attending between now and Christmas?     I haven't been inviting to any yet but I'll be at all of them.  2. Have you started Christmas shopping yet? If so, have you finished, or when do you expect to finish?     I've started. I am far from finishing. Hopefully I'll be done this weekend. I'm a slow      what can I say.  3. Who is your favorite person to shop for?     Me. Just kidding. My son. He's easy. He can't say what he doesn't like and his toys and     clothes are still cheap.  4. Have you decorated your house yet? (inside or outside)     Hopefully that'll be done this weekend too.  5. When did/do you put up your Christmas tree?     Whenever I get time. Later this year because of Jordan. He's very time consuming.

      The graduation party is off. After all of my hard work. I bought the decorations, the invitations, the eating supplies, and I even reserved the facility. Unforunately Morjama is waiting until next semester to walk because she waited until the last minute to submit her documents which was a bad idea. It's too late to have her name printed in the program.   I'm not mad. Now I have time to plan better and save more money. Instead, we are going to rent a stretch navigator and go out to eat in SF then club hoppin. I'm excited beacuase I haven't been out in forever (well, without my man) and the last time I did, the club was bootsy.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

          I'm sooooo excited...and I just cain't hid it. I got tickets to the Erykah Badu concert in Oakland. Sacramento is so bootsy. Do they ever have anything going on? Well, I can't say that, she did come her I just missed because they didn't advertise her show until the day of so I have the right to call Sac bootsy. Maybe she wanted in that way to keep the knuckle heads away but com'on, her concert was in a club in South Sac. Oh well, who cares now. I'm going to see her for Valentine's Day!

      Okay, amybe not a blast but all went well except for a couple of untasteful dishes. I don't feel bad that I can't cook now that I truely know that my soon to be mother-in-law can't cook either. I don't see why my man does so much complaining about me not cooking. It's not like he grew up eating exceptional meals nightly. His mother doesn't even cook. He's not missing out on anything so what's the big deal???  I really do need to get serious though. I have a growing little man who needs a good cooked meal (and well balanced) at that so that he can be strong and healthy. Mommy will try Jordan. Don't worry, I'll learn to cook before you can tell the difference.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

      My co-workers have issues. I work in a psychiatric facility and I think the employees are as looney as the patients. I like  Thunder Thighs  a lot but the man is having an identity crisis and he is 41 years old. Isn't he a little too old for this? I thought that type of thing usually happens during junior high school (or college years for late bloomers).  This guy comes in with the most ridiculous things on his mind but his thigh, or rather his weight issue is by far the one that should be his least concern so we call him thunder thighs behind his back. Is that mean? Of course it is but it's still funny. Here are some of his funniest thoughts but let me give you a brief description of him. He's about 6'2" slender white guy. He dresses like a pretty boy with lots of chains and bracelets. He has blond hair that he "feathers" with some type of pomade balm (it makes his hair look greasy). He's got a Master's Degree in Social Work or maybe Marriage/Family Therapy license, regardless he's always trying to do therapy rather than what he's paid for so he takes about 2 hours per assessment which is outrageous. He only works 4 days a pay period because he and his two brothers (he's a middle child by the way) have an inheritance from their grandparents.  Coments by  Thunder Thighs : "Jillian, does my hair look okay like this?"  --The only thing different was the side the part was on. He likes it parted on one side during the summer and the other during the winter. "They say that turning 31 is harder than turning 30 and 41 is harder than 40. I was depressed all day yesturday." --He turned 41 "Jillian, do I look fat in these pants?" --My usual answer is no but when I sat I thought about why a man is asking about his weight I joked and said "yes." He then told me "I'm thinking about having liposuction, my dietician told me that is the only way to loose my midsection because it's hereditary."

      So my best friend, friends from college, and sorors decide that we want to form a book club so that we can have something other than the drama in our lives to discuss on our monthly girls-day-outs. Why can't I find the reading material? It's not at the library nor any of the local books stores. Okay, we want specific books about and by Black authors. Well I won't say only Black but people of color. Sacramento is a big city. There are Black people hear. Where are the books for Black authors? Do Black people not read in Sacramento?   I had to order the book. It'll be at Barnes and Noble is about  a week and half. I hope I get my book finished on time.

      1. Given the chance, would you like to live in outer space? Explain.     No way. Visit? Probably but why would I want to live outer space when I'm perfectly fine in space?  2. Are prenuptials a good idea, or pessmistic?     I'm torn. It depends on the situation although I do feel like they're pessimistic. If you are a millionaire, what do you have to lose? If you love the person enough to vow to spend the rest of your life with them, why would you not want to help them if the marriage were ever to fail, millionaire or not?  3.

      Would you rather:  1. Always taste bacon everytime you burp OR have your farts smell like roses?      I would rather have by gas smell like roses as long is it didn't come along with a sound.  2. Be known to the people in your neighborhood as "the peeping tom" OR "the dumpster diver"?     Definitely "The Peeping Tom" 3. Suddenly be attracted to the sex opposite what you are currently attracted to now OR suddenly want to be the sex opposite what you currently are?     I'd rather be a man than same sex oriented.  4. Kill a puppy with your bare hands and win $100,000 OR pay somebody else $75,000 to kill the puppy and you only win $25,000?     I'd be happy with an extra $25,000. I wouldn't touch an animal with my bare hands.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

      1. If you could go anywhere in the world with your spouse (lover, significant other, whathaveyou) for one week, all expenses paid vacation - where would you two run off?  Egypt or Italy.  2. Let's say you are going on the same vacation, all expenses paid for one week, but this time by yourself - do you go to the same place or would you want to go somewhere else and where? I'd go to same the places alone as I would with a lover.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

      I am so upset right now. I had about 20 book on my Barnes and Noble wish list that I really, truely planned on reading and when I checked today to see which book I should read first there were only two books on my wish list. I can't believe this happened. These are books that were recommended but I have no way of finding them again. I remember partial titles and authors which is getting me all of nowhere. I can't believe I walked around with a bunch of post-it's in my purse causing junk, which I dispise, and finally recorded it somewhere but to my great suprise, it's not there. Life can be soooo disappointing sometimes. Okay, that's a little too drastic but I guess I'll be searching and searching until I recognize the familiar titles.

      I really need to get a daytime job. I miss all the good shows that come on UPN at 8 p.m. I miss watching music videos. I miss all the decorative shows that come on at dinner time. But most of all I miss ER. Okay, so I get to see the repeats in the morning. Most of time I miss them because I'm still asleep thanks to the Dish Network. When I am awake at 7 a.m. I usually turn to Jo Jo's Circus or the Wiggles for my son to watch. Another problem with that is that missing two days is like missinf half a season. It comes on twice a day back to back. Plus I've seen all the repeat episodes. I'd like to keep up with Mekhi Pfifer and Carter and Abby's relationship. Gosh I miss TV.

      1. Do you prefer today's world or would you prefer the more simplistic past?     I love today's world, I just wish I had more money so that I could fully enjoy it.  2. What does Valentine's Day mean to you?     Unfortunately it's just another day. A way for retailers to make money. A way for      singles to feel bad about being single and couples feel bad that they've wasted sooo      much money pleasing their boy/girlfriend or not spending enough.   3. What types of books do you like best?      I enjoy novels about and by people of color. I can usually relate much better to what's     going on.

      Okay, I like my boyfriend little brother a lot but enough is enough. He's a kid with an expensive lifestyle. Okay, so he's not a kid anymore. He turned 21 on the 2nd of December but he's still being supported by his parents so he's still a kid to me.  He's been staying with us and he doesn't do anything but lay around the house all day, lay up with his girlfriends (by the way, he has manyof them), and party all night. On christmas day this fool told me he was going to mop the kitchen floor since he didn't help with the celebration. Why did I have to mop floor. And I just did this last Saturday because I got tired of waiting on him.   He keeps MY cordless phone in his room even though he has a cell phone and when he's not there I can't even answer the phone because my guest bedroom now looks like Theo Huxtables. And when the phone needs to be charged he doesn't even put it back on the charger. When I'm on MY cordless phone he sits in my face until I get off so that he can use it. He even got his calls forwarded to our home phone from his cell phone. See why I call him a kid? These are things I did in junior high and maybe high school to my mother. Not the people who are letting me stay with them because I don't want to be at home with my parents so I can have some freedom.  So anyway, I'm wondering why my house has been taking so long to warm up. About a week later I notice that this fools' window is open. Do you not realize that it's winter and I have a baby in the house? Are you going to contribute to the electric bill? I din't think so.  The killer was when I noticed that he's been using my son's baby bath and lotion. I know I may be taken this overboard but damn. You use your dad's credit card up to 3 G's a month so make it $3005 and get your own damn lotion and shower gel. Mind you, there's about three different kinds of soap in the downstairs shower anyway. Why dod you want to smell like a baby? I told you he was a kid still.  I know that I'm very particular and I complain about everything. I mean everything. If you see me on my knees getting stains out of the off-white carpet and I take my shoes off everytime I enter the house why don't you do it to 1) out of respect and 2) because you know I going to bitch about the minute I see you in the house with them on? The only person who should not be taking their shoes off when they enter the house is Jordan because I don't let him walk outside yet, especially since it's cold and wet out.   After all this, why does my man get mad when I tell him to check his little brother? If you laid they law to him in the beginning you wouldn't have to check right now. Your the big brother and the honeymoon's over!!!  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

What is the biggest/best present or surprise you received during the during the holidays?     I actually didn't receive anything that I would go crazy for so I guess I'd say my sons music classes.  3. How did you ring in the New Year?     At home watching a repeat of Carson Daly's Bash.  4. New Year's resolutions... do you make & break them, make them & stick to your guns or don't even bother?     Make & brake them unfortunately although I'm trying real hard this time.  5.

      Why did I leave work early, search the web my entire short shift, and get already for partying and didn't even go anywhere. My man got sick, mind you he's drama, so there was no way we were going out. My friends were all party poopers. "It's not safe", "There's a lot of crazy's out there", and "I'm just not in the mood this year."  What a drag. I stayed at home watching a re-run of the Carson Daly Bash since I have the stupid Dish Network and everything comes on 3 hours earlier than it's scheduled time.   I called myself getting tipsy but that didn't even work. Sad to say by my New Year's Eve was a drag.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

      What one thing are you most looking forward to . . .  1. ...today?     Getting in my warm bed.  2. ...over the next week?     Taking down the christmas tree, getting my house back intact, my boyfriend brother      going back to Alabama because his junky-and disorderliness is driving me crazy,      observing how Jordan adjusts to his new childcare, and straightening my hair.  3. ...this year?     Getting married, a better job, and potty training Jordan.  4. ...over the next five years?      After marriage and a better job (preferably a career) I'll probably be content. I       would love to travel and maybe have another little bambino. MAYBE!!!  5. ...for the rest of your life?     True happiness if such a thing exists.

      *pouts with arms crossed*  I'm so boring. I rely on meme's since nothing interesting ever happens in my life. I guess I'll answer these questions since I've been holding on to them for a couple of weeks now.   1. What is the middle name of the first person you slept with?  I only count my current man and his middle name is Keriguey. Don't ask me how to pronounce it because I don't know how and I'm sure I spelled it wrong too. All I can tell you is that it's an African name. I don't know who he is but he did something important for our people on the other side of the world.   2. What kind and color underwear are you wearing?  Bikini cut, pink, floral, see through. Who comes up with these questions anyway?   3. What is the song you want played at your funeral?  I've never really thought about and don't plan to anytime soon.   4. What would your last meal be before getting executed?  Seafood. Shrimp in particular. Lobster and crab stuffed mushrooms. Stuffed baked potatoe. Walnut and cranberry chicken salad. Clam chowder. And for desert, a strawberry filled crepe made with chocolate batter covered in chocolate and caramel syrup and topped with whipped cream and almonds. Is it that obvious that I spend entirely too much time at the local Red Lobster? I sound like a pig.   5. Tupac or Biggie?  Tupac. Damn, he's so sexy.   6. If you had to pick one person on earth who should die, who would it be?  Anyone who stands in my way. I'm just kidding. I haven't come across anyone who fits the catgory yet. Hopefully I won't.   7. The person whose problems you would never want to hear again?  I don't think such a person exists. I'm so nosey I'd probably be in your business even if you didn't want me there. I live off of drama. That's sad huh? Oh well! I like giving advice too. Or maybe I just like hearing myself sound in control.   8. What is the thing most important to you (physically) about the preferred sex?  Height   9. Do you secretly hate some of your friends but are too nice to reject them?  Well, since you asked. There is this one chick in particulare, she's actually a really nice person but she is annoying most of the time so you don't get to see that side of her. She's one of those groupie chicks. She likes to be in the lime light. Wants to be known. Wants to be down with Black men which means she does whatever it takes. She's the type that will fuck her way to the top and then be like fuck niggah.   So anyways, she would always call me bragging about all these balla's she was fucking with, or should I just say fucking? Oh, and when I say balla's I mean like Laker's team members and professional football players. Oh, and did I mention that she's a LIAR? Okay. She's so not attractive but let her tell it, all the men think she's so exotic looking. Bitch, do you know that just means you look like a fucking slut?  Well, to make a long stroy short, she moved out of town. We talk every once in a while but I'm so happy to get away from her because she had no other friends. She fucked all their Black men and when someone did kick it with her they set her ass up. She was quite the fashion expert. Anyway, I prayed for her and in turn, she lightened up her phone bill. I don't know if it was because I kept catching her in lies or because I told her that she was a tamp but either way, I got her out of my hair. Yay!!!   10. If you could have any super power what would it be?  To read people's minds and morph where ever I want to be at that moment.   11. How many drinks does it take to get you drunk?  I don't know, I rarely drink but it take s about three to get me tipsy. Is that alot.   12. Favorite Outkast lyric?   Right now all I know by heart is: throw your hands in the air, and wave them like you just don't care, and if you like fish and grits and all the pimp shit, everybody let me hear you say "oh yeah". I don't even know the title of the song.   13. Hair color you most like someone your dating to have?  Brown   14. If you had to be blind or deaf?  Deaf, I'd still be able to communicate but most importantly, I'd be able to see who I'm communicating with.   15. Do you have any psychiatric problems?  If I did do you think I'd be bragging about them on blogger? Others think I;m crazy though. Just kidding. I'k somewhat of a narcissit and OCD up the ying-yang.   16. Least favorite month?  October. I have to change that now though because my son was born in that month.   17. First movie you can remember seeing as a kid?  I don't know the name of it but I can clearly recall going with my step-father to the movie theater. I had to be about five. I cried too. It was about a run away dog.   18.Favorite person in the whole world?  Jordan.   19. When's the last time you went on a date?  The day before Valentine's Day.   20. Do you like violent or dirty movies?  Neither. I prefer drama and romantic comedy's. I know, I'm into chick flicks.   21. Fall or Spring?   Fall.   22. Person you most wish you hadn't made out with?  Everybody before Rah-Nohn. Oh, except for one who will remain nameless.   23. If you aer straight, what person of the same-sex would you be with?  Lucy Lui.   24. Where do you want to live when you are old and brittle?  England or Brazil.   25. Who is the person you can count on most?  My dad and Rah-Nohn.   26. If you could date any celebrity, past or present, time and age are not factors?  Maxwell. So, so, sexy. And the beautiful voice of his. I'm not feeling the tight pants though.   27. What's a word you'd use to describe your life?  Grok   28. What did you dream last night?  I can't remember but children character's were involved. And no I'm not a pervert, I just spend a lot of time watching children shows with my son.   29. Favorite Bands?  No doubt, The Roots, Black Eyed Peas, and Linkin Park. Do Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill count? They have bands.

      My co-work told me that I grok today because I get so engrossed in planning such as my sons first birthday party, my best friend's graduation party, and now my wedding.   Apparently, grok means to be so completely emmersed in a subject that you have to know everything about it which can become harmful if you don't have an eternity to learn it empathetically.  It was written by Robert Heinlein in  Stranger in a Strange Land.

      One day someone asked me "Do you think you are all that?" I thought about it and I simply replied,  Yes I do!  I am a woman of virtue. I am a wife, mother, a daughter, and/or a sister  Do I think I am all that? Yes I do!  I am a spiritually focused woman. Always faithful in prayer, patient in affliction, and joyful in hope.  Do I think I am all that? Yes I do!  I am a child of God filled with precious wisdom, nuggets of truth, diamonds of love, and shimmering words of life. I exist for the purpose of being used by God as a tool, as a witness, and as a blessing to other women.  Do I think I am all that? Yes I do!  I could have been doing something else with my life, but God showed me that He is greater than he that is in this world.  So now women of God when someone poses the question to you "Do you think that you are all that?" Simply reply with confident assurance Yes I do!

      1. Should the media be responsible for how they affect children? Partly but I wish these dumb ass parents would step up to the plate and say they don't talk to their children. If you show your child the difference between reality and fantasy this would not be an ongoing debate but since idiots are allowed to birth, lets just censor everything. Just kidding. But life wil go on. "Parental Advisement" at the beginning of shows and commercial breaks will have to doing for now.  2. What is your strongest power surge? Don't know. I really have never thought about it and honestly I don't care. That's bad huh? I really need to get more adept with the world around be. I seem to believe that everything revolves around me and my interests.  3. What supernatural power would you want the most?  To hear other peoples thoughts and ex-ray vision. That would make life a lot easier. Oh, and can I be like the Halliwell sisters on  urlLink Charmed  and be able to morph to different locations? I think it's called astro-projection. This was Prew's charm before she was killed off.

      One thing I can never understand is why another women wants to look me from head to toe. If you see something you like, compliment me, otherwise...keep on steppin.  There's this white woman that I work with. She's always in the faces of the Black men here. I don't care. I don't want them but have a little respect for your husband, who also works here might I add.  Everyone here knows that this particular co-worker of men has slept with most of the Black men who have come through here and those who continue to be employed but can your husband be so naive to have some as his groomsmen? By the way, the husband is a Sex-I-Can. That's what I like to call Mexican men for undisclosed reasons. Did I mention that I'm not racist? Okay maybe a little but there is absolutely no one in this world who doesn't see color lines.  Back to the story. There's no way she can be in competition with because I'm just too tight. I mean I was voted the most beautiful woman at Sutter amongst both my male and female co-workers. Don't ask me why they felt the need to take a poll but the important things is, I won. Not only do I look good, but I also have the perfect twist of confidence and silliness that makes a man tell me that "[He] wants a wife who possesses the same qualities as [me]. That will make [his] life more meaningful." By the way, I do work at a psychiatric hospital.  Okay, really, the story. As I walk by her to admit a child she looks me up and down so I turn back and give her my "I know I'm tight but damn...stop staring look". She then looks up at my face and smiles like she was trying to tell me hi. This is a constant thing with her because when I'm around those Black men aren't trying to take her to the parking lot and show her the meaning of "Mandingo". They're all in myself with their pathetic question. They know they do not want to hear about my son or my fiance to that matter but I find it so funny they she's always two feet away trying to hear the latest update of my life. You are over thirty years old woman. Get a damn life. I know it's hard to see a Black women being hoovered over by Black men but get over it. That's life. Get your shit together and maybe people will interesting in something more than sex from you. Wait a minute. I take that back. You'll never compare to me in a million years but I'll pray for you to have something meaningful happen in your life so you'll stop begging for attention from Black men. You have you two Black children and your Sex-I-Can husband so cope with it.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : more co-worker kiss ass as usual. [ watching ] : my co-worker kiss as usual in disgust.

         Cute picture though!  Don't get me wrong, I thought her first album was cool. I haven't heard her latest aside from the singles. "Rain On Me" is okay. I love the video, mostly Larenz Tate with his short ass. The concept was insightful. She's cute. Okay, enough of the positive stuff.  Why in the hell is she so wack. Her singing is horrible. She can't dance worth a shit. Her designer is not doing a good job. Her performances are hideous. She talks like she needs a speech pathologist. I think that's enough. Oh, why in the hell did she make a song with bootsier Ja Rule singing about loving to be fu**ed. She needs to be loving herself instead.   She's a beautiful young woman. Not very talented in the music business although her sales are doing very well but she bores me to death and makes me angry because I know she's intelligent if she managed to get an academic scholarship to Princeton. She seems as though she trying to be to cool. Just be yourself.

          Jazzy Fatnastees . I loved their first album but I can't find it anywhere. They are supposed to be dropping their third album in the beginning of the new year and I haven't even heard their second one yet.  Believe it or not, one of their songs was played in "Deep Cover."

       Saturday: I went to meet with my wedding photographer. He's a handsome old man. And he's funny too. I work with his wife and she cried broke for me so he agreed to give us a discount. He told Rah-Nohn that he's giving it to us because I'm so cute and he'd better watch out. I thought that was so funny. One thing I did find odd though, was that he asked us what we liked about being Black most. Things that make you go hmmmmm.   Well, he told us that he would have it no other way and that he loves the creativity that comes out of Black culture. It is so intriguing to see people who hate us so much imitate everything we do.  I also went to try on some wedding dresses. Why did the dress I like most make me look like a butterball turkey on film. I'm so angry. I'm starting my search all over again. I know Mahein is going to be so upset with me. I have come to see her like a zillion times and I still haven't made up my mind and times running out.  Do I have the worst baby in Sacramento? Jordan threw a dinosaur at my mom and it landing on her plate in her guacamole. I was so embarrassed. And I really need to stop laughing when he misbehaves, even if it is funny because he just wants to be a little clown afterwards.  He did the same thing at  urlLink the Cheesecake Factory  later that night. We went to celebrate Randi's B-Day (sister-in-law-to-be). I feel so bad. Why did we lose the gift certificate we bought her from Nordstrom's? Not only did she do nothing for her birthday but eat out with us and her mom, she didn't even get the satisfaction of opening a gift.   Sunday:  I did absolutely nothing. I hate shopping with Rah-Nohn so he decided to have family day alone. Jordan and I stayed in the house all day. We ordered pizza and watched tv. It suprised me when he sat through   urlLink Finding Nemo  . Okay, so he didn't watch every minute of it but he watched more than what's expected from a 16 month old child. He's getting sick and cutting two wisdom teeth at the same time so he was a little cranky but we got through it.   This little buzzard woke up at about four o'clock in the morning and played until he fell back asleep. He can really drive me crazy sometimes but I love him all the same.

      1. How far would you or have you travelled to see a concert? I've travelled pretty far but for the right person I'd go out of state. I really want to go to the Essence Festival in New Orleans. That's four states away. I don't know how many miles.  2. What is the best concert you've seen? Maxwell, Erykah Badu, and Luther Vandross. Oh, and Lauryn Hill.  3. What is the worst concert you've seen? I can't remember the name of the group but they sang that stupid song "68 and I owe you one."  4. Have you met a performer after a concert? Yes. Sean Carter-Jay Z. He was very pleasant. Not real cocky. Well mannered.  5. What singer would you like to meet most? Beyonce. Erykah Badu.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : jazz music.

      1. Give us your thoughts on valentine's day ... over-hyped, commercial holiday, or a nice day to share with a 'sweetie?' V-Day is a nice day to share with my man although it is extremely over-rated and expensive.  2. Do you have a valentine this year? if so, who is it? if not, who would your perfect valentine be? I do have a Valentine this year. His name is Rah-Nohn. My soon to be husband who is the perfect Valentine.  3. This year, my secretary and i do not have valentines, so we're going to get dinner and go hang out at a gay bar together. A friend of mine asked and said, "Oh, lonely hearts club, huh?" That offended me, because we're not lonely ... we just don't have a MAN, plus we have each other to hang out with! Do you feel sorry for people who do not have a Valentine today? Of course not. What for? It's not the end of the world. Some people prefer to be single.  4. My ex-husband is coming over today to do the things around the house he promised to. He also called to ask if he could bring me lunch. Guilt is a WONDERFUL motivator! Tell us about something romantic you did because you felt guilty. I never act on guilt. That may be selfish but oh well. Most of the things I do are things that please me.  5. Do you have any plans for valentine's day? If you don't, tell us about your perfect valentine's day fantasy. I went to see Erykah Badu and Floetry perform on Friday. As far as the actual day, I didn't have a babysitter. Rah-Nohn and I went out for brunch then Sunday we took Jordan to the Nature Center here in Sacramento so that he could have a treat too.  6. I'm going out to the mall today (after i get my chores done, of course), and shopping for a red dress or a red corset-type bustier to wear out tonight. tell us about the hottest vday outfit you can think of for a man/woman (your choice!). and 'birthday suit' doesn't count, people!   ;) What you said sounds good. I'm lovving the coreset style top right now. My wedding dress is even going to be made that way.  7. My friend invited me to TWO weddings today. my friend has her 11th wedding anniversary today. do you think it's a good idea or a bad idea to get married or propose on such a day? Well speaking from a self-centered persons point of view I think that weddings and anniversaries on V-Day is not a good choice because I'd rather be out with my man being pampered than celebrating someone else's special day. I need total attention. All eyes on me. Not the bride, groom, or anniversaryer if that's a word.  8. There is a lot of debate and discussion about same-sex marriages. San francisco recently married a lesbian couple who have been together for FIFTY-ONE YEARS. Do you think that gays and lesbians should be able to share their love and marry just like heteros? Be as safe or as controversial in your answer as you like ... this question isn't supposed to bring you flames on your site. I'd just like to know what other bloggers think! I could care less. Same sex marriages won't make or brake me. It's just like another stranger getting married. I don't know you nor do I care to.

      1. Your family and friends find out that you have downloaded (from the internet) instructions on how to make a bomb OR midget fetish porn?  Definitely a bomb if I can say that without the FBI tracking me down and interrogating me.  2. Make your living emptying other people's garbage OR giving sumo wrestlers massages? Giving Sumo Wrestlers massages. I can always require them to bathe first. I don't do garbage. Not even my own.  3. Run naked through your grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary OR through your best friend's wedding?  I wouldn't rather not do either but if I had to chose it would be my grandparents 50th anniversary party because my grandfather has been dead since before I was born so it's very likely that no one will be there except my grandmother and I.  4. Find a tree that will only grow in Chicago that grows money, but only grows Chilean Pesos OR only grows Icelandic Kronur? Chilean Pesos. I'm sure it's easier for me to get to Chile than Iceland. Plus I'd rather go to Chile anyway. I can be amongst some other people of color.

      Erykah Badu is the Bomb. She is very talented and I really enjoyed her concert. She had two dancers and participated in some of the dance routines. It was mostly modern, jazzm and African moves. She was on the ground, had her legs in the air, and she managed jumped and spin in the air. I was very impressed because she looks about 6 months pregnant.   I've been hearing some wack things, things that I hope are just rumors but I guess we won't find out until she's ready to reveal. The story goes that the baby is by D.O.C. He's the one with that song "Let's Get It Funky" in like 1989. He rapped with NWA if I remember correctly. I will be very disgusted if this is the truth.  I heard that a month ago common announced that he and Erykah parted in Sway's "Wake-Up Show". I never listen to it so I don't if it's true or not. I'm going to do some research on the topic tomorrow.  Back to the concert. Floetry opened. I'm really not into them but I think that the singer has a beautiful voice. I may go out and buy their CD's just because I love her voice. She's not like the rest of these beautiful faces, tight bodies, but vocal talent (Ashanti). That was mean but oh well. She made me believe what she was saying was the truth. She made me feel what she felt. And her side kick was a good hype-man. I know that's not her job but I'm really not digging rap right now with all the wack people out (Chingy).  Yeah the music will make me get out my seat and dance but his lyrics have no substance. I need to listen to someone who's going to teach me something or make me think (NAS). I'm getting off track again.  Floetry's equipment was screwed up in the beginning. I guess the two mics were clashing when next to each other so the two members had to share on mic for an entire song which was pretty difficult when it went from rap verse ti hook and back again. The ytook a moment, prayed, and finally the stage workers got it together. They look much smaller in person. Either they've been working out or it's true what they say about tv adding on the pounds. I was kinda of mad that they were only allowed to sing four songs. I think it took more time to set up and take down there equipment than they actually spent performing. Oh well, E. Badu definately made up for it.  Erykah Badu looked beautiful. She had her hair in micro-braids and they were way past her behind. Her whole band and herself were dressed in none other than Afroc-centric attire. The costumes were very simple but did stand out with the colors in the background.  She had a story to go along with different songs and she categorized her songs and realy interpreted them for me. Okay maybe not me personally but a lot of her stuff finally not only sound good to my ears but made since in my mid too. She's definately a 5% and she has a foul mouth but it's cool. She's seems to be very excited about the new baby.   She scatched on the turn-table not only with her hands but her elbow, her chin, and behind her back. She played some of her own instruments too. Damn, this girl is talented. I've always enjoyed her music but I didn't know she could sing the way she did. I'm convinced now that she's one of the best performers I've seen in a while. Among other I thought were fantastic were Lauryn Hill, Maxwell, and Luther Vandross.  My only disappointment was that she didn't sing "Love Of My Life", "Bag Lady", and "Grenn Eyes". I was soooo disturbed by that. She basically covered everything from every album otherwise.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : Sade, she's making me sleepy.

      I don't have to be at work until 3 p.m. so why in hell was I stuck in traffic from every which way that was possible. The street was crowded due to construction which is understandable but why was the freeway jam packed? After I exited to take (what I thought was a short cut) I was stuck in for about twenty-five minutes. Just for six lights. It was so bad. The streets were gridlocked. What is the deal with that? Both sides of the street were ridiculous and even the side streets were bad. Is the world getting more crowded or did I just have a bad day?

      1. On Sunday afternoon, I like to just...  go to church, take Jordan to park, eat dinner, then relax.   2. I'm behind someone at a traffic light, the light turns green and they just sit there, I... honk or go around them and make sure I look at them like their stupid as I pass by.   3. My immediate reaction to someone making a nasty remark to me is... to make them feel stupid by either ignoring them, saying something equally as nasty but intelligently, or thanking them for their insight while correcting them about their remark.  It just depends on who the remark is coming from.  4. If I had to live in a state/country where it was cold most of the year, I would... be very unhappy unless of course it was London.  I could probably deal with giving a high standard of living.  5. When the weather outside is hot and humid, I prefer to... go swimming or engage in some type of water recreation.   6. My favorite 'comfy' clothes to wear around the house is... pajamas.   7. If given a deadline at work/school to finish a project, I usually... complete before or on time.   8. If someone gave me a pet for my birthday, I would... probably give it to someone else. I can't deal with animals.  A baby is enough work.  9. As far as watching the clock on weekends, I... don't.   10. I usually wash my car about every... year. Just kidding.  No really. I rarely wash my car.

       Saturday:  Jordan and I went to my mom's house. The three of us went to a couple of places to check out some wedding accessories. Jordan turned a basket of stamps upside down and as my mom and I picked them up he continued to pull them out. We decided to go home after this episode. I went home after a couple of hours because my mom dissed us to go gambling at Cache Creek Casino.   Sunday:  Went to church. It was nice. The church had a special lunch for visitors and door prizes were given out. Of course I didn't win. Took Jordan to a B-Day party at Chuck E Cheese's. I'm really beginning to feel like Sac is not the place for me. All the Black people are bootsey. They're on some gang banging shit which is totally ridiculous to me. Don't we want to ever prosper as a race. We should be loving each other rather than competing. Especially win you've already lost before you began. My family will never be defeated. We're to strong for that. And or shit is on point.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : Jazz  [ watching ] : [ reading ] : [ random ] :

Relocate to a foreign country.  3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor?

      1. If you were to commit suicide, how would you do it? First of all I wouldn't commit suicide but since  IF  is the key word, I'd take the easy route. I'd pop some pills. Get high, relax, then fade into an eternal sleep.  2. What is your best stress reliever? Screaming although sometimes I get really bad and slam doors in the house and kick the walls. That's really bad, huh?  3. How do you feel about jokes bashing the opposite sex?  I love them. It's all fun. People who take offense need to realize that it's just a joke.

      Would you rather:  1. Find out from your significant other that he is cheating on you by: you walking in on them OR he telling you about it?  I'd rather hear it from the horses mouth. I don't want to be traumatized.  2. Take a 20% pay cut at work OR get a promotion and a 20% pay increase, but your first new task is to fire three of your co-workers?  I'd take the extra money any day. I don't like my co-workers that much and there are plenty of jobs in my field out there. Actually, there's a shortage of nurses so they should have no problem finding a new gig. Plus, I'm sure they can me without a second thought.  3. Be responsible for a car accident that causes your best friend to become paralyzed OR be involved in a sex scandal with a famous politician? A sex scandel by far is the best option. Who cares if a crooked politician is revealed when it comes to the welfare of my best friend?   4. When you lie to someone: drool uncontrollably OR burp loudly?     Burp out loud. I do it every seldomly anyway. Just kidding. But for real,  I'd rather burp than drool.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : The Beattles. They've been playing this crap all night.

      I stayed up until about 3 a.m. intrigued with this book. From the start it seemed like a trashy romance novel. Actually there was a lot of trash in the book but there were so many hidden lessons. Lots of little scenarios that made me think. I can't wait to get into the sequel. Mary B. Morrison seems like a lot of her thoughts are coming from personal experiences which is what I like. If I'm learning or listening to you speak, I hope you have some type of expertise in the topic because otherwise you're not doing anything for me.    Along the same lines but kinda off the subject.  How many books do I have to read to become a 5% er and what do the books have to entail? I'm really trying to go there but are there any mentors out there? If so, help...Please help.

      Why am I soooo mad right now? Not meant to be a question. I know the answer and you're about to know too.  First of all, I'm not into the radio all the much. I mean, when I was on my way to work this morning Kanye West's  "Through the Wire"  was on two stations at the same time. I'm so sick of that song so I was thinking about how much I didspise the fact that they play the same song every five songs. Does that make sense. Anyway, they have on wish wednesday's in the afternoon when I get off work and I was thinking of calling and wishing that they play some real talent throughout the day. Can I hear some E.Badu, Musiq Soulchild, Van Hunt, NAS. Save that wack ass non-talent for another day. Why do they get so much air time when they don't even have any real talent except that they found someone to fund their wack shit and pay the radio stations to play them heavy rotation?  The radio stations make people love a song because they hype it up and then play it ALL the damn time. Then we get sick of it. People like the artists above just seem to skip the whole radio promotion and go straight on tour. Why bother with the BS right? You're still selling records, making money, and doing what you love without all the drama, rumors, and paparazzi.  I really get sick of hearing about bling-blingin and ching-chingin, sex, and drugs. REALLY!  That's the first reason I'm mad. Secondly, Usher's on the Doug Banks morning show. When do I ever get to catch a good interview? Why do I have to be at work? So, I'm thinking I'll just log onto 103.5 the bomb and listen to the interview. Guess what, their damn webpage is down. WTF??? This is suppose to be a business and your webpage is down? Urgh!  Guess what else. I come to work every morning at 7 am. There are four desks in my office and two in the next room which is connected to this office. I sit at the same desk everyday. It's my desk. Everyone with my position on every shift and everyday of the week sits at this desk. This is the Intake Specialist desk. Why in hell does this fat ass nurse sit at my desk every morning and she knows I'm coming in? We all start our shift at 7am and end our shift at 3:30 pm. It is so far beyond me why this chick sits at my desk every morning. And the chair is always warm. That grosses me out. I think I've mentioned a couple of times that I'm prejudice against fat and ugly people. I know that's wrong but this is even more reason for me to be upset. Stay out of my Fucking desk. Kepp your fucking coffee off mydesk. I dispise coffee and I dispise you fat ass. For more reasons than one. I hope she can read minds. My emotion shows all over my face. Unless your blind it's very evident that I can't stand her.  And lastly. I'm mad because my co-worker took his mini radio home. He drives people crazy with all his extra stuff. I'm sure I've mentioned him before. You know, "thunder thighs". Well anyway he has the office cluttered with his fan, small waterfall, bookcase full of books, and his radio use to be here along with CD's and tapes. Oh, and a discman and walkman. He was kinda old school.  Where the hell is his radio? I'm missing the Usher interview and I'm so upset. This is my main reason for being upset.

      I told myself I'd keep coming back and I'm really trying to stick with it. This is truly therapy for me.   I wrote a lot of emotions yesterday. I still feel them and I probably always will but just at a lesser degree at time. Like today for instance, I'm accepting the fact the mother doesn't plan on helping me with this wedding whatsoever. But I know she'll get my hopes again just to disappoint me all over again. So I've decided to stay clear of her for a couple of days although I'd really like to avoid her for a couple of months. Maybe then she'd get it. Honestly, I don't think she'd ever get. I'm finally begin to realize where I get my selfish ways from although she likes to blame it on the Ruth family (my father's ancestors). No, it's from you momma. Except it. I do. I'm sure this is a trait that will stick with me although I'm working on it. One things for SURE though, I will NEVER put my son through such bullshit. NEVER will I make him feel unwanted, defeated, or even unhappy if I can help it. Okay, I'm going on a tangent again. Next subject.  Why are flowers so expensive? Better yet, why are wedding flowers so expensive. I'm being charged well over $200 for my bouquet. Just me, no flower girls included. No bridesmaids included. Just me. Costco sells two dozen roses for $12.99 so why am I spending over $200 for mine? Because it's for my wedding that's why. Suck it up Jillian. Stop being cheap.  I've finally chosen a bridesmaid dress. Now I have to go through the whole hassle of finding shoes to go with them. Nine West has a bridal line out now. Some cute stuff but not a large variety. They even have five different pair that can be dyed to match the wedding colors. Cute huh? Remeber prom when everyone were buying those cheap dyeables to match their dresses. Same concept just a lot more expensive. I don't know if I feel comfortable asking these girls to $80 on some shoes dyed pink that they'll never wear again. I already feel bad that the bridesmaid dress was $170 something. It's cute though but if they're not going to prom anytime soon it'll probably go to waste too. I'm seriously thinking of donating my old prom and bridesmaids dresses to some local group homes so that they can have the opportunity to look as beautiful as I did on my prom night. They're not too out of style right? I only graduated seven years ago. Damn I'm old.  Until next time...   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : my co-workers personal fan blow the rest of us until we freeze.

      I know I keep telling myself and you that I'm going to start doing the online journaling thing but sometimes I just can't get into it. I think today is the start of my writing streak again.  First of all, a couple of things are really bothering me. My friend who claims to be one of my best friends is bugging the hell out of me. Me and some of my bridesmaids go looking for dresses Saturday and there happens to be bridal fair in Nordstrom's at the Galleria. Why is this breezy asking hella questions to pertain to her wedding? I'm no hater. Handle what you need to handle. But do it on your own damn time. She was acting hella stand off-ish with the other girls. She kept leaving the group and instead of joining in conversations she's look in a magazine. And she bounced out the car after we got back to my house and didn't say bye to anyone. WTF? I think she's mad that I'm having not only her as my maid of honor but two maids of honor. Really, I thought she's be married before me so she would have been the matron. Regardless of who carries what position why was she acting so bothered? I can go on and on about her but I'll save that for another day because there's a couple of more topics I want to touch on before I leave work. My purpose here is, did I do something wrong because I do feel bad in a way. Maybe things will be a little more clearer once you get all the background info. Like I said, LATER. Maybe tomorrow I'll spill my guts.  I am so mad at my mother right now. I probably shouldn't be saying that but I am and I know it's a natural thing for daughters to be upset with their mothers and for mothers to be upset with their daughters. Overall I'm a good kid. Actually, I'm a great kid. Okay so I have a child. I have a BA. I take care of myself. I rarely ask you for anything and when I do i t's because I really need it. For instance, Jordan was sick and couldn't be at school. Is it too much to ask you to keep him for a couple of hours? I didn't think so. She wasn't tripping about that so I'm glad about that because I get really sensitive when it comes to my son but you know Im getting married and you haven't done a damn thing to help me. All I wanted was so invitations from you. And you keep suggesting that I have your husband walk me down the aisle. For what? All the two of you have done is cause be grief and heart ache. You fucked up my credit. Made me take out a bunch of loans for a cheap ass state unviersity. And have not contributed whatsoever to my well being as an adult. That bugs the hell out of me. How can you just not help me??? Am I wrong for feeling this hatred right now? I've put up with so much bullshit and yeah everything is ookay now. We are on good terms. But what about everything that happened in the past. Children never forget. Neither do adults. I will never treat my son the way I was treated and I'm really mad now because you're not even trying to fix the shit. How can you not have the money to help. What the fuck is $500 when his parents are about to dish out over $5000. Better yet, what the fuck is $72 for some cheap ass invitations that I've been waiting on for about three months. I'm very disgusted with this whole situation right now bu t no matter what I'm still going to come out on top. You wanted to see me fail and need you but guess what. It's not going to happen because I'll never be a failure. NEVER. Regardless of how hard you tried. You know who you are and if you don't you need to come out of denial. You're just unhappy with yourself. Because your self worth is low you wanted me to feel like mine would be too. No not me. I'm self-confident for that bullshit. I'm gone be alright regardless.  Okay, I think I just went on a nasty tangent that was greatly needed but a little inappropriate. I like to be real though.   I went totally off the topic of where I wanted this entry to go so maybe I'll try again tomorrow.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : my annoying ass co-worker annoy everybody around. [ watching ] : my life evolve. [ reading ] : nothing. [ random ] : With that said, I feel whole again.

      Would you rather:  1. walk to school OR carry your lunch? (that goes out to my moma who used to ask me that when i was little). Carry a lunch. I'm a princess, I don't walk and if someone wants to make my lunch I'm all for it.   2. drink green beer and throw up for the next hour OR drink green beer and pass out and wake up in an unknown place?  I'll throw up. I did it everyday for about three months when I was pregnant with Jordan.  3. catch a leprechaun and he give you his pot of gold but the police think you stole the gold and you go to prison OR have to run away from a leprechaun that's evil like the one in the movie? Get the pot of gold. I can pay for Johnny Cochran to get me off the hook and I'm sure I'll have more money left over than what I started with.   4. call in "sick" to work so you can go celebrate st. patrick's day with your friends OR go to work and your boss takes you all out to party? Go to work. I can get paid to have fun. Plus, I normally don't celebrate St. Patty's day with friends.

      1. Do you like your name? Yes.  2. Are you named after anyone? Some soap opera star that played on  Ryan's Hope . My middle name is after my paternal grandfather.  3. Do you have a nickname? If yes, what is it? None officially although people thinks it's okay to call me Jill. I really hate that.  4. If you could change your name, what would you change it to? Maybe Alexandria or Nya. I like my name how it is though.  5. What is the most interesting name of your friends or someone you know? Morjama. Emericiana. Clover. Actually, a lot of my friends have interesting enough but I'm sure that'll do.

No.  4. Do you occasionally pout, throw tantrums or cry to get what you want? Of course. What girl doesn't?  5. How long has it been since you've done childlike things (for example: ride a bike, play marbles, jump rope, build a sand castle)? I'd say about three or four years when I began working in an office rather than on the child and adolescent  unit.

       Would you rather:   1. In a bullfight, be raped by the bull while the whole stadium just sits and watches OR be gored in the nads (general groin area), but people try to help you?  The 2nd option of course. Who wants to be raped by anyone or thing?  2. Give your kidney to your mother OR your father, assuming both parents need it now and you're the only match?  The one who asks first. Just kidding. How can I choose?  3. Be able to blow bubbles in shapes of animals using only your mouth OR be able to squirt water from your tear ducts?  Blow bubbles...definately.  4. Eat only crackers for the next 6 months OR eat just one plate full of live, assorted bugs? Crackers will do.

      1. Is there a such thing as stupid questions? Of course. I think when your dealing with a topic you have no knowledge of it's okay to ask things that will familiarize you with the subject but there are many questions that fit into the "Stupid Question" category, such as: --Are you mad at me? If you've done something to me that makes you ask that question then you already know I'm mad. --Am I in troulble? Coming from your child who just got suspended from school. --And I'm sure you catch my drift.  2. Should teen magazines maintain a neutral view on most subjects? No, teens need challenges and articles that stimulate their minds and make them develop their own opinions is helpful for finding out who they are as individuals.  3. Who should become President in 2004?  Someone who will actaully make a difference. In other words, someone who will use our tax dollars to educate our children. Someone who will fix the defecit so that we can all be employed and able to support our families. Someone who can mind they're own business. Someone who focuses their attention on the problems of US citizens rather than illegal residents and immigrants. Someone who leaves innocent people alone. Someone who makes peace not war. Someone who cares about the betterment of the society rather than person gains. Someone who knows what the hell they're doing. And most importantly, someone who can speak proper English. Is that too much to ask for.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : Gloria Estefan [ watching ] : nothing. [ reading ] : blog stuff at the moment.

      I work in a locked facility which was really a hassle when I first started because you have to use a key to get through every set of doors. Luckily we only have two keys to work with.  Why do people on the other side of the door think they can just wait until I lock the door? There's a little window that you peek through and see someone on the other side so instead of them taking out there key and opening the door they sit there and wait for someone else to. Why do they feel like the have a sense of entitlement?   I feel entitled too but when I get to the door I'm not going to just stand there and wait for someone to open the door for me. Lazy people.  That's my gripe for the day. Otherwise, I'm so happy to be working in the day.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : some good R & B oldies. [ watching ] : nothing.

      How can you laugh and be disgusted at the same time?  I'm driving and I keep hearing this noise but I'm just thinking it's someone's radio. After about a minute a turn around and this kid blows a kiss at me. That was the highlight of my day. I laughed so hard tears rolled from my eyes  but at the same time I wanted to throw up from disgustion (if that's a word).   This creature was so gross looking. I'm not trying to be mean but he looked like a burnt piece of toast with too much butter. He had a horrible case of acne and I could actually see the plaque on his teeth. Oh, and did I mention that he was one of four passengers in a beat up red Hyaundai. The kind that Rodney King was driving when he was attacked by the police.     I think they were a little irritated that I laughed in their face (okay, from my window) but I definately didn't try to hide it. They followed me for about five mintues yelling out things they thought would make me pull over. Who did they think I was? I would never pull over on the side of the road so they can "get at" me nor would I waste my time talking to someone who approaches me in such a matter. Silly kids.  By they way. He really wasn't a kid but his behavior was so kid-like so I had to refer to him as one.

      I love day shift. It's not the people. It's not the job. It's not the facility. It's the time. Of course I was excitied to switch shifts with my counterpart but my day has went by soooo extremely fast. I'm almost off and it feels like I've only been at work for an hour.   I feel like a normal person again. I get to cook dinner, watch all the good tv shows, and most importantly, bathe and put my baby to sleep at night. This looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship.   I'm still looking for another job though. Sutter just can't afford to pay me what I want. I love the people but I am getting no personal growth here.  And why do all these fat ass people shit in out office? If you have to do more than a little you need to walk your ass to the gym where no one will smell it (nor will the see you), or to the staff lounge. You need to exercise anyway. This fat ass woman was in the bathroom for like 30 mins then came out trying to joke around. You nasty beast, I don't want you touch me, walk by me, talk to me, matter of fact, don't even look me after you just got done shitting make everyone else's nose burn. Would you have a little pride. Just because your big doesn't mean that you have to lose all self-respect.   I'm not trying to be mean but fat people disgust. Especially when they shit in an office where 6 other people work at. Be nice to your co-workers. Spare the air damn it.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : Chaka Khan. I forget the name of the song. [ watching ] : nothing. [ reading ] : nothing.

      Why is  urlLink J.O.Y  the only person interested in me? Am I that boring???  of course mine are wedding questions:   1. what songs have u picked out?  I'm lagging. I'm thinking of "Never Felt This Way About Love" by Brian Mcknight for the Bride's March. Alicia Keys also did a rendition of it on her first CD. I want a live singer though. No radios. Maybe "A Ribbon in the Sky" for the bridal party to walk down the aisle to. Also with a soloist. There are a couple of other classic love songs I like by various artists. She, I'll Be, A Whole New World, At Last, Sweetest Taboo. Everything is still in debate though.  As far as the reception goes, I want it to be like a club in there so I'm going with current hits as well as some old school.   2. how many bridesmaids do u have?  Six bridesmaids and two maids of honor.   3. what are your colors?  Blush and Bashful. Just kidding. Do you remember that from "Steel Magnolia's"? Those were the colors of Julia Roberts wedding. We are using pink and cream. I was thinking of using my sorority colors but I felt like I'd be doing too much.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : oldies.

      I've come to the realization that I don't like anyone upon first meeting them. There are so many people that I thought I couldn't stand but once I got to know them (or should I say they started talking to me) I begin to like them.  I never approach anyone first. Never! Unless of course I HAVE to and I would only have to if it were work related.  I don't know why I'm so stand-offis but I really will not even ackowledge someone's presence if I don't know them unless they speak to me or their in my way.  Is that odd or just shallow?

We're very confident and often times called stuck up (which we're not) but we are considered "high maintainance" which is a stupid label to me but all in all, I'm the "OG" because I've been this way for years.

      I confess that my friend and I have been plotting on my man's best friend's wife. Mean huh? Well, it's a long story but she definately deserves it.  We were thinking about going paintballing. Really. And if Rah-Nohn comes he's going to invite "not-a-man" (bestfriend) and phoney-baloney (wife). So my friend (lips) wants to gun her down. I'm down with that, especially since I heard it hurts. I'd much rather just ignore her or better yet, kill her with kindness but make her feel stupid while doing it. She's not the smartest cookie out there. I know it's sounds pathetic but hey, I like to have fun with other people's feelings. Just kidding.  I also confess that I've been spending time at work looking for a new job. I'm sure everybody does but I don't care who knows or who sees. I've even been faxing my resume out to other agencies.

      Would you be able to do these things yourself or have someone do it for you?  1. Fix a flat tire. No and even if I knew how I'd still have someone else do it.  2.

      So, I have this friend. She's in the wedding. We rarely talk but we're still close like we talk eveyday when we get on the phone or hang out.  She saw my ex. The one right before my fiance. That relationship was crazy and the brake up was craier. Maybe when I have more time and I'm in the mood I'll give y ou a soap opera re-cap but anyway...Emerciana sees him in the mall.  First thing that comes out of her mouth is:  Merc: You know Jillian is getting married right?  Red: (he has red hair and freckles, don't ask why I thought he was so handsome) Yeah, I heard. (I'm trying to figure out how he knows because I haven't told many people. Especially in the ring.)  Merc: Are you going? (WTF was she thinking asking that question? She knows about the drama).  Red: Nah...I would be one of those people who stands up and objects.  What was I thinking dating him. I mean, I was head over heels in love with this man. Holding on to something that wasn't there until I met me soulmate. I think I was more infatuated with his status, character, and looks to see what was really going on. And his family was such a great support system.   But damnit, I'm so happy that it's over and I've got Rah-Nohn, whose family is also great. I always find guys whose parents love me. I think that turns me on to them even more. Hmmm. I thought that was interesting that he said that but when he had me he didn't realize who great I was.  So, for all the men out there not showing your woman her worth...Get it together homeboi because she won't wait forever and believe me. There's someone ten times better than you and you'll be feeling real dumb when you're telling your boys that you can have her whenever you want her she's with the next dude not even paying you any mind.  I think I learned a lot from that relationship and will always have love for him but hey, it was time to move on and I'm happy I was able to unlike one woman I saw on a talk show who has still recovering after ten years. No lie, I think it was Oprah.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : Louie Armstrong. I don't know the name of the song though. [ watching ] : nothing. [ reading ] : nothing.

      One of my good friends from high school told me that she had gained weight since the last time I saw her but her weight gain was nothing I had prepared for. She just went to get fitted for her dress and was told that the top portion of her body is a size 8 but her hips are 14. WTF is that about? So she had to buy the bigger dress obviously but she'll probably end up paying a tom in alterations. I feel bad because I ordered my dress from another salon and if I had order from there she would just have to pay one flat fee for all the alterations but since I didn't, she SOL.  Should I help her with the alteration fees?   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : something by Marvin Gaye. The one that Aaliyah re-made on her second album. [ watching ] : nothing. [ reading ] : nothing.

      I confess that: 1) I was late for work because I had to make a pit stop on the way. 2) I spend more time on the internet than I do actually working while I'm at work. 3) I tried to pick a fight with Rah-Nohn but he was actually pleasant throughout the whole conversation. I was impressed and I learned a lot more about him and his perception of me in that thirty minute conversation. 4) My son is really bad. His dad was laying on the floor and walked up to him and kicked him in the eye, not cool huh? 5) I let Jordan get away with too much and then wonder why he feels so entitled at the age of 18 months. 6) I love blogging although I use to make fun of people who spent hours on the internet chatting with people they did know.

      Well, I missed yogo again. Jordan got sick. I don't mean just a little cough here and there but to the point where he needed a breathing treatment with Albuterol. Dr. McCrimons is telling me that it's a cold. I'm like, "Do you hear him whezzing when he breaths?" I'm so disgusted with him. Why are prescribing asthma medicine if he doesn't have asthma? To answer my question since he won't, doctors don't like to diagnose children under four with asthma because in actuality it could be some other lung condition. Either way, it's a problem and I expect for it to be resolved.   In the midst of the doctors appointment and going to pick up the medication, I missed a luncheon given in my honor along with another employee with the director of the hospital and my manager. I guess they just wanted to ackowledge my excellence for dealing with those stupid nursing policies. I was kinda upset because I've never been awarded for anything. I mean NOTHING and this was my chance. Oh well, like my manager told me: "They'll be other times." Oh really? "WHEN???" I wanted to say but whatever, my son is more important than free lunch at a fancy restaurant in the Pavilion Plaza at Mace's. I'm over it. Really!  Why couldn't Jordan wait one more day before getting sick? Just kidding. No I'm not but like I said earlier. Whatever.

      Okay this woman wants to kill herself. She said that she's going to drive to Lake Tahoe (which is only about two hours from here) and get lost in the snow.   My questions are: 1) How are you going to kill yourself, getting lost is no the same as death and  2) What snow? It's been in the 70's and 80's for the past couple of weeks.  I think she's a borderline just screaming for attention.

      I hear that it's very intriguing and relaxing but I can't get over the fact that it's going to be in 110 degree weather. I'm trying to mentally prepare since it would be impossible to physically prepare. I'd be wasting my time even thinking about it.  Well, I guess I can drink some water and stretch but otherwise, I'm doomed. I hear that you can loose up to five pounds each session but I'm sure it's all water if you lose that much in 90 mins.  Weight is not the problem though, my tummy is. If I can just loose that and tone my legs I'd be a happy camper. Luckily my wedding dress doesn't show an inch. I just want to make sure I look good for the honeymoon. I'd loved to wear a bikini and not worry about what's showing and what's not.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : oldies as usual.

My nose has been stuffed now for about two months but I still managed to smell his shit. Urgh.

      1. Would you prefer to live in an urban, suburban, or rural area; and why? Urban would be my first choice because I want to be where the action is. I'd love to be in a loft in a big city partying every night of the week except Sunday so that I can prepare for the next week. I can see myself in Manhattan. I'd be at the fashion shows, Broadway plays, celebrity parties, and the list go on.    But ideally, I'd prefer the suburbs now since my life has taken a change. I need an acre or more for my son to play, swim, and practice whatever it is he needs to practice.    2. If a fountain of youth did exist, would you drink from it? I would if I could keep the little knowledge that I do have. It would definitely only be for the physical attributes.  3. What do you want your dying words to be?

      I've been feeling a little discouraged lately. I don't know if it's because I'm broke, unsure of what I'm going to do myself regarding career choices, or just tired. Every little thing has been irritating me. I don't think I'm blowing things out of proportion but I guess I can tone it down a bit.  I've been searching the internet a lot lately and I'm seeing so many places that I'd love to visit. So many things I'd love for my son to be involved in. So many people that are intriguing me. Why am I just learning about  urlLink Kola Boof  and she's motivated me to do a little investigating, which I must say I love doing--mainly because I like learning new things but mostly because I'm nosey.  There's so much knowledge out there and just not enough time to learn it all. That's an excuse. I can do, learn, teach anything I put my mind to. Have I mentioned yet that I'm plan-a-holic. Well it's gotten so bad lately that I've even planned ways that my son will spend his summer. Aside from all the fun things like road trips, camp, and waterslides he will have a lesson plan created by me to keep up his education.   I think each day will be based on a theme. Places and era's of those places, people and their contribution to others, animals, inventions, and plants/flowers. He will have an asignment, all age appropriate that he will need to complete for me to review. I think that this will not only broaden his horizons but teach him basic study tactics and writing abilities. Not that I'm going to test him but I do plan on have a discussion about his discoveries. I plan on incorporating art and music into these topics. Am I doing to much? I said it would all be age appropriate but I think knowledge is the key to success. And learning doesn't end with last class of the day or the end of the semester. It's an ongoing thing and I may even give him some light scale assignments during the school year on the weekends. I plan on taking my child to see some of the things he learn. For instance, if he's studying the Harlem Renaissance, I want to take him to museums and actual sights that he's reading about.  I hope I'm not doing too much and he appreciates my efforts. These are things I wish my family could've done with and for me. Jordan doesn't know how lucky he is to have a mother like me. At least he doesn't know yet.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : music in the background of my random thuoghts on way to improve who I am as a person. [ watching ] : work pile up on my desk. [ reading ] : nursing policies pretty soon. [ random ] : My day is getting better already. I guess this blog has come in handy.

      Kaiser is referring us a male eating disorder patient coming in from Canada. WTF? I know we're good but isn't there psych hospitals out there? I know our eating disorder program is suppose to be good but I don't know if I'd be sending my 16 year son to Cali for eating problems.  *Update* Apparently there are two brothers who've been all over the news. I don't watch the news so I have n o idea who my co-workers are speaking of so this should be interesting. I wonder if the news reporters will be here upon the admission. I guess that's illegal being that he's a minor huh?  Can you tell that I'm bored today?

Though you're not as hollow as the soulless ones, you're filled with unnecessary hatred and scorn.  Virtues: You have none, honestly. All you want is a friend to torture and harass with you! Admittedly, it sounds fun, but honest to god, you need a hobby. Your favorite pasttimes include: bumping into inanimate objects without apologizing, poking little girls in the tum-tum, and putting plastic snakes in the neighbor's driveway. I'm sorry, but you suck at harassing. Take a tip from me: verbal harassment is teh r0x0rz.  Aspirations: Hitman? Satan?  Quirks: Happy people. You just don't like them, do you?  Factors: What happened in your troubled past? I mean, was your father a llama or is it just one of those things where you were the bad child and your sweet little sister was the only one who came out right (*cough, Ali, cough*)? That's okay. I understand.  Future: Counseling seems like the best bet for you. Enjoy the sweet, sacred times you'll have on medication.

      Today's question was: If you could change one thing in your life to make it more positive what would it be?  I could name a ton of things but probably the most important would be to develop a better relationship with the Lord. That doesn't mean going to church every Sunday or joining the choir. What it means to me is learning more and spending more of me time worshipping one on one.   Do get me wrong. I believe in God, the Bible, and that prayer helps. I just feel like I'm not doing everything I can. In other words, I wish I were a better Christian.

      I had the most awful dream a person can have in the month of April. I dreamt that neither me or my soon-to-be received our tax return. And on top of that we woed. Not a lot, just about $500 but $500 that can be spent in a split second. Something the both of us are really looking forward to. Not only do we want a great honeymoon but Jordan has to top last years B-Day party. Just kidding but I do want his day to be special since the wedding is the month before and he'll probably be lacking our undivided attention as we near the big day.  So we have this duplex. We lived there for about 10 months rent free and didn't save a dime. In fact we splurged most of the time because we knew we only a had a couple of bills. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Boy do I wish I had taken advantage of those 10 months. I could be a millionnaire right about now. Okay not quite but we were still able to buy a house. We've been there for almost a year have are sooooo lazy that the duplex is just sitting there empty with a couple of out things that we obviously didn't need because we haven't taken the time out to go get them. Anyways, the mortgage is being taken care of by the rent of the other tenant. Do you know how much money we could of made had we rented it out for this year of vacancy??? I don't feel like doing the calculations but I'm sure I could've had my brand spankin new Benz by now. Anywho, we've committed to going in and painting the ways back white this Friday. My step-dad is keeping the little one and we're going to get done.   Me with my artistic self wallpapered the babies room and painted it blue. Typical for a boy right? I also stenciled jungle animals to match his John Lenon nursery set. It's really cute. I should take pictures for my portfolio before I destroy the creation. I guess I should've done that when the furniture was still in the room. The living room had a base wall of red. It was nice. It had the crackle effect. Well actually I just used a sponge roller so it came out nice. Again, I should've took pictures because Rah-Nohn refuses to let me paint the new place. Our room was plain, lavender walls with white feathers stenciled.   Okay, now my point. I'm looking for a money maker in this vacant duplex. I was thinking of a group home for SED children/adolescents but that too great a liability and requires too much high end staff (SW, psychiatrist, and counselors). I was also thinking of a halfway house for recovering drug addicts or newly released inmates. Not sure that's a great idea either. Battered woman's shelter sounds the best but still major issues. I'd need 24-hour security which I don't mind but I'm scared that some husbands/boyfriends will find out and our cover will be blown. The duplex is in a great location for this though. I don't know how the neighbors will feel though.  Any suggestions of what to use this space for and any additional information would be nice.

      I can't believe I've been blog rolled even though I still haven't gotten any comments. I really need to get in the hang of post my thoughts but I'm so much better at responding to other people's post. Why is that?  I mean I e-mail people all day long. I get asked all the time do I take breaths in between thoughts because I never shut up. I mean NEVER! My man tells me all the time that I get on his nerves because I talk to much. Oh, he doesn't like me attitude very well either but he's still here so it must not be too bad.  I'm just a little too opinionated at times which is not always a bad thing. It isn't a good thing all the time either. I tend to hurt people's feelings with my comments but I'm like "we're grown, deal or get dealt." Is dealt a word? Oh well, you catch my drift right? I love to hear the naked truth. Tell me what you think. I'll re-assess it and I'm sure my interpretation will be totally different but tell me what your thinking. Am I making any sense? I never do, do I?  I just ramble on and on and on about nothing in particular. Maybe that's why I'm not getting any comments. Oh well, I'll live. I enjoy posting on others anyways.

      So I guess I really did it this time. I want people to perform at my expectations and I'm not being realistic is what my fiancee tells me all the time. WTF?? I don't ask for too much. Nothing is enough for me. Do you know who I am?  So what I asked to photographer to use a fish eye lens, diagonally angled-shots, black and white with a colored bouquet and so on and so forth. he's a professional photographer and he's been in the business for 20+ years. That's his job. He should have the ability to do this stuff.  So what if I'm getting a good deal. I still want my wedding photo album to be magnificent.  I guess I did over do it because he told me that he'll give me my deposit back so that I can find someone who can handle all of my requests.  To make a long story short, Rah-Nohn called to photographer, cleared everything up, and we took our engagement pictures on Saturday. I consider them family portraits because 1) Jordan was included, 2) I didn't have my ring, and 3) I dressed very, very casually because I knew that wouldn't be what I expected. I still don't know that yet. We'll get the pictures in about a week but from what I've seen of his work thus far, I'm expecting it to be on the order of a JC Penny's without the graphic effects. I wish I had known this before I went with my co-worker's husband. I don't want any animosity in the workplace plus, their old, very nice, and Black. Yes, race does matter to me.  I'm thinking that we'll go have some more pictures taken just dressed up, with my ring, and another photographer this time. I'm not really very upset because this is our first time taking family pictures. Rah-Nohn was a little jealous because I got some shots with Jordan alone and he didn't. Jordan was acting up by their turn. Ahha!!! Just kidding, they can take some together for Easter.  My make-up was on point. I think I want to use Buffy for the wedding too. She's kinda expensive but I can always be ghetto and go into Nordstrom's and have her do it for free. No, I would never do that. That's just plain tacky. She works for smashbox. I've never heard of it but she did an excellent job. *Pictures to follow*   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : I'm blocking everything around me out. [ watching ] : nothing. [ reading ] : nothing.

      Okay, am I the only one who forgot to set my clock back?  Well, maybe I didn't. Maybe I just wanted an excuse for an extra hour of sleep. No, I remembered that the time was changing I just figured I wouldn't have to set my clock up an hour because the sunlight would wake me up.  How stupid was that? Really, I was just too lazy to get up and set the clock once I was already in bed. Plus, I leave that for Rah-Nohn to do. I guess that's something I should seriously reconsider because he waslate today too. Not as late as me but late.

      First of all, I need more money and I need to be doing something I enjoy.  I have too much time on my hands. All I do at work is surf the web. And I can't even be nosey anymore because all more sources are on a listserve I no longer receive. Urgh!!!  Don't get me wrong, it does get busy at times. We do have an influx of calls very often but if we don't have beds there's nothing we can do here and lately when been full along with every other facility in the area. Do other states have as many mental health clients as California?  So I'm really considering nursing. There's a really good program at Samuel Merrit College for a Master's in Nurse Case Management or Nurse Anestesoligist for non-nursing BA's. Why not go for it right. Case management is something I was interested in and still considering briefly. Well, it's a two year program and since it's a private college I'll end up owing $64,000 by the time I graduate. That's too much money for me to handle I refuse to be forever indebted. I know what your thinking. I'd be making over $64,000 a year. That's all fine and dandy but I just refuse to be in that much debt regardless of fast I can pay it off after I graduate.  So, I'm going to have to settle for the RN program at the local JC. Makes me kid of depressed that I'm not upgrading but I have to do what I have to do so I won't be broke for the rest of my life. Plus, I will still be able to stay within the scope of psychiatry and remain at my current employer and in the same department hopefully.  My ultimate goal is to become an interior designer and work for the rich and the famous so that I can become rich and famous myself. I don't necessarily care about being rich and famous myself but I would like my name out there and I would also like to be wealthy enough for my son no have no worries. I want to be able to afford basketball shoes if he decides he want to play basketball, and karate lessons if he decides he want to learn the discipline of karate. I want to be able to buy him a car when he gets his license and more than anything I want to be able to afford college for him because I refuse to let him experience the stress and anxiety I had to undergo while I was in college because my parents weren't smart enough or too selfish to set money aside for my well being.  Maybe I'll see interior design in my near future maybe not. Regardless, I want to be able to provide for my son the best way that I can.     		 Ambiance: [ listening to ] :  commercials on the radio.

      There wasn't very much traffic today. So why the heck did this man wait until the last minute to squeeze his big car in front of me to merge onto HWY 50? Me being the jerk that I am, I waited until it was damn near too late then let him in. And to prove my irritation I got into the next lane so that I could pass him up and stare him down in disgust. I obviously forgot what freeway I was on because the lane I got into was going towards SF. Boy did I feel stupid. I had to drive about two miles to the next exit then get back on the freeway. Silly me thinking I know where I'm going had to do the same exact thing as Mr. Last Minute. I was in a turning lane. I got over in front of a truck got back on the freeway and though about how stupid I felt.  I've already been joked for April Fool's Day and I really did feel like a fool. A fellow blogger told us that she was ending it all. Everyone left this sadening comments and she couldn't even keep it going for an entire day. I hope I get no more jokes. It doesn't feel good to be a fool. I feel sorry for people who feel this way on a regular. It must suck to be them.

      I'd really rather work on Monday so that I won't have to give up a day. Especially since I don't have any and I plan on taking a honeymoon after the wedding. We really need to start planning it though.  So I plan on cleaning tonight. I mean really getting down and dirty. Actually, tonight I'll probably do a preliminary clean-up then extensively clean and shampoo the carpet Saturday since Jordie will be with my mom.   I'm kinda hesitant about leaving him there all day though because the last three times I let him stay the night he came home with flea bites. Or maybe even I spider bites. Whichever, they were not cute and the itch the hell out of him. And my poor baby has scars from the bites. See why I can't stand animals? My mom has these two funky dogs that my little brother never walks or bathes and Jordan loves them. I mean loves them. If no one is willing to take him out there to play with them he'll just stand at the screen door playing with him.   But I gotta get this house cleaned or I won't invite anyone over for this BBQ scheduled for Sunday. I'd rather do without it anyway because a couple of my friends are going to the Manteca waterslides and that's a hella of a lot better than inviting folks over to tear and dirty up your house.   Of course Rah-Nohn told his cousins that he had to help unpack that it was on and he doesn't want to cancel plans. That irritates the hell out of me. BBQ for everyone can get expensive. I say we invite everybody to the waterslides. It's only $15. I'm such an indecisive person so I'm use to changing plans at the last minute. He, on the other hand has to be prepared for whatever's coming. Urghh!!  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : my fat ass co-worker who I can't stand run her trap. Damn, does she ever shut up?

      Thanks to KBMB again.  If there was one thing you could change about yourself as a woman what would it be?  Menstrual cycles without a doubt. I'd prefer child birth over periods anyday.  I had an epidural and didn't feel a thing. And even if I did, it's not something that occurs monthly.

      I'm in heaven right now. My blogspot is cute. My comments box is finally up. And I fix the time and kept the date in Spanish. You should be hearing a lot from me now. In fact, you'll probably get sick of me.  For some reason I'm prejudice against fat and ugly. Now, I don't think my blog was ugly at all but it was unattractive to me which is why I spent most of my time on other people's site. I know it sounds crazy but I'm ready to start being opinionated on my own site.   This doesn't mean that I won't be poking my nose in other people's business but'll I'll definately be spending some time on my own site for a change.  Now all I need to do is working on getting that ugly tag removed and learn how to do some tricks.

      Blogger did us cheapies and to designing skillers a favor. They finally came up with some templates for the rest of us. Yippee.   I thought it was cool to have my date in another language simply for a change and I'm so slow, I didn't realize the time would change too. It's about four hours ahead of where I am now.  But obviously there's some draw backs. I can't figure out how to get my comments box up. Any help is greatly appreciated.   Oh, duh! How're you going to notify me? E-mail me. jillianr79@hotmail.com.

      According to  urlLink KBMB da' bomb  (northern Cali radio station), what is the one thing your significant other does that makes you mad?  He doesn't clean up after himself and after being prompted, he still does do it correctly. To my standards at least and in my mind, my standards are the only standards that matter.

      So Saturday my friend had a b-day party at Chuck E. Cheese for her two year old. We've been knowing about this party for at least a month. We already arranged for Jordan to go to his grandmother's house after the party since it was in the bay area so we could clubbing that night so this woman knew he had plans. Why does this womoan call that morning telling Rah-Nohn that he needed to help his cousin from Texas move in. Okay, fine but we had plans so he'll have to help later. He tells her this. The woman is dramatic. She starts saying that he only comes to visit when he wants money and how none of her kids ever help her. Well, why the hell are you not on the phone telling Rah-Shaun the same thing. So she starts talking about how she's paying for the wedding a blah, blah, blah. I hate when people throw things in my face (Rah-Nohn's) to try to control you. He's your son. You should be helping (funding) the wedding because you want to, not so that you can get what you want out of us (um...him becaus I don't fall for her games). At this point I'm like whatever, GO!!! So after the party I'm like I need to go to the mall to get something for tonight are you guys done? Yeah but I need to take them to get some food. I'm hungry too, we didn't eat pizza so we'll come. After we spend forever trying to please them with a retaurant I'm like okay I gotta get something for tonight. By the way, this is the follow-up to his b-day celebration and Morjama's graduation for Friday. We're all going out.   This fool is like I have to help them unpack. WTF??? Who helped us unpack. Hell no. We gotta go to the mall. So he asks them if they need anything else. They want to go to the liquor store. Fine! It's right around the corner from their new crib. Why is his mom like, no, they can't go to that store. Thugs hang out there and they don't need to be there. Let's take them to the grocery store. It's like damn near seven by this time. I'm heated by now. it's not like they are never going to stop at that liquor store. It's right around the corner from their house. I mean, they have to pass by it to get in and out of their neighborhood because there's only one way in and out. (Side note: Why is there only on wntrance and exit into hoods?)  I should have just took Jorda with me to the mall but the stroller was in his uncles car and there's no way I'd be able to try on clothes without that little boy sneaking out the bottom of the door. Why didn't I just drop him off then go shopping??? Anywho, we went to the outdoor mall in Emeryville. We arrived around 8 p.m. and every store was close except Banana Republic and Old Navy. Why the hell wasn't Gap open? They're owned by the same company so what sense did that make? I guess it doesn't matter because I really don't like any of them for myself. So, I didn't find anything to wear. Rah-Nohn and Rah-Shaun both found shirts.   I'm stressed out by this point because me and my friend have this rule. See, we are fakers. Don't ask me why, but we make plans all the time and if one of us doesn't come through it's cool. Really, no heart feelings. We have an understanding. But the rule is, we NEVER, EVER, EVER fake on the big things. This was considered a big thing. I was feeling so bad that I even tried Ross. Needless to say I went in a walked right out. There's no way I can shop in all the disorganization.  Now Rah-Nohn's little (older sister in like 5'2 and 100 lbs give or take three. The girls wears a 0 okay. I tried my luck anyways though. Moreso for Morjama because Rah-Nohn could've still went out without me. He had his brothers. Well, amazingly I fit into the XS BeBe dress so I was ready to go. Took a shower but didn't have a shower cap. Why was my hair a big poof by the time I was done? What did I do? Flat iron my hair with a flat iron that barely worked because I broke mine. Could anything else have went wrong?   Morjama faked on me. Nuff said.

      Friday my best friend in the whole wide world finally graduated from Sac State. It's about damn time. It only took you seven years. That's faster than Rah-Nohn. So why did we go out to eat at the Macorni Grill with all of her family. And believe me, her tribe is deep. She's from Sierra Leone and they gets down and dirty with the liquor. I mean those Africans can drink. Since I'm not a drinker Rah-Nohn had enough for both me and him, the baby too. So her dad stands up to give a little speach. When he finishes Rah-Nohn (mind you, this fool has only been around her family once) starts chiming on the one glass with a butter knife talking about "speech, speech, speech. So why does her family join in?   She and I are like the same person. We have a phobia of speaking in front of crowds. Large, small, family, friends, whatever, whoever. If it's more than a little I get nervous. So she ends up threatening to kill Rah-Nohn and delivered a good thank you speech considering she was put on the spot.   She thanked everyone for backing her, supporting her, and funding her. She must have been a little tipsy herself because she went on to say that now that she has her degree she was going to start taking care of the elders. Uh, did you forget somebody. I've been there to help your ass type and write papers/oral presentation, make up believeable excuses for you professors and on occasion get you phoney doctors notes, and been there for you morally, went out with you and your nerdy study groups. I guess the list could go on an on so I'll just say that Jordan's savings account number will be forwarded to your employers so that they can take a precentage out of your check to deposited into his trust fund each pay period.

      So the guys were dirty. The girls were smelling, hood-rat looking chicks. They all thought they could dance. Like I said before, I've never seen a guy get juiced off Beyonce. Okay, I have but not stand up and start dancing and singing "Naughty Girl". That was too funny.  Rah-Nohn goes to "Bada-Bing" quite frequently and he said that the same dirty shoed guys are there all the time. They think they're Bloods. Yeah, niggas still try to gang bang in Sac so when you hear West Coast music they ain't lying, unfortunately.  So Rah-Nohn went outside and this one fool asked me if I was there with someone. I'm thinking in my mind, ummm, I did walk in with someone. Sit down with someone. Had drinks with someone. And converse with that same someone for the last 30 mins (and the club/big bar is like the size of my living so I know he saw us) so uh, yeah, I'm hear with someone. He's like "Oh yea? Where he at?" I pointed right behind him and he was was like "Oh, blood...Blah, blah, blah...while hugging on Rah-Nohn. Then showed him how to do the Blood shake. Rah-Nohn told him he wasn't a Blood and he was like "It's alright, I'll teach you anyway." WTF???  You know MF's have to get jumped into gangs. They have to murder people to get in. They have to basically be willing to give up all rationality to be in a gang so for you to just show a GDI your shake proved to me that Sac dudes are fake, phoney, and bootsey all in one.  I pledged, and believe me, it was hard but it was no where near what gang bangers have to go through and I'll be damned if I tell someone to throw up the pinkie. I mean, you have to go through what I've gone through. Walk in my shoes and the women who paved the way shoes before you get that privelige so why the hell was this fool teaching Rah-Nohn the Blood hand shake?   You see why I want to get the hell out of Sac? It's so wack and I'm so ready to be alround some educated Black folks.

      I have a routine. I go to work. I pick up Jordan from childcare. And then I go home. Sometimes we go to the park. Sometimes we go to the ritzy mall where nothing but white people hang out. And sometimes we play outside. But, for the most part, I have a very uneventful life so I have to comment on my week.   Well, to touch on  urlLink s.R's  topic a couple of days ago about pick up lines, I was in the mall Monday. Why did this guy come up to me and my son. He was holding a little (big) girl who looked at least 4 or 5 years old. He asked me if I wouold take her to the bathroom. I was so astonished at the question that all I could do was open my mouth in shock. He was like, "she can use it herself, I just don't want her to go in by herself." I'm thinking, so you'd prefer me, a perfect stranger, with my own little boy running around rampant to take her in. You don't even know me. So I told him to take her into the men's bathroom so he could see what was going on. He said it was nasty in there and he didn't want to. I picked up my son and walked a way. He tried to follow but luckily this lady overheard our conversation and told him there was a family bathroom (unisex that is) for anyone with kids less than 10 feet away. We were right near the food court. I kina felt bad for a minute because the little girl was looking so pathetic like she knew this fool didn't know how to take her to the bathroom but when I looked back and saw them still standing around looking stupid I realized that her look was in total disgust because she knew the fool (who just so happened to have long hair and a perm) was using her to pick up chicks. I think using a child is worst than any pick up line. Especially asking someone to take her into the public bathroom. I work with a bunch of crazies so if he knew what I knew, he'd come up with something a little more practical, like: "Hey baby, you married?" That's the usual.    Nothing major on Tuesday. Just Jordan's music class at Gymboree. My son is so musically inclined and I'm just sick of getting stared at by these white stay-at-home moms. Yea, I work. Yea, Jordan's dad is still around. Yea, I have a fat rock on my finger. And yea, we're Black and we can afford and love Gymboree. Get over it. Stop staring at us like we an extinct species. The are just amazed at how talented my little man is. He play the drums on beat, he doesn't have to be re-directed 10 times to pay attention, and he can dance. Why is that so shocking? Okay, this is not funny but it's still going under my "Funniest week in a long time" title. When Jordan does anything, intentional or accidental they look at him like he's just committed some major crime. These big ass white kids (he's in an advanced class for his age) cry and act like he's just chipped their tooth but let them do something it's like, Okay chase, you're getting too excited. No bitch! Your son just hit my baby and no he's not crying. And no there's no heart feelings. That's what kids do. For the record. White children are evil. Outside of childcare Jordan has no friends so he's always eager to play. They run from him. Take his instruments (he does too though) and try to brush him off. He's never like that with them but you know what. I think kids can get jealous just like adults can. I'm not going to lie, my son is the teacher's pet. They love him because he's so talented. Well, I think so anyway. And obviously the teachers do too because they're always in his face but he's probably a little above average in comparison to ethnic children. Why the hell do those white kids just sit there so uneffected by the sounds? I don't get it. It's just natural to nod your head when you hear rhythms right? Well, obviously not for these kids but to get to the point of all this blabbery. I'm sick of the dirty looks. I know parents are competitve but lets just face it, you child lost the race as soon as I found out about Gymboree and next session he'll be in art so I hope they're prepared.  Last night. We went to this club...um bar with a dance floor called bada bing. That was the funniest shit I have every been to. Well, almost funniest. I don't know if I've mentioned how bootsey Sacramento is but the still try to gang bang out here. Why was it a bunch of want-a-be bloods at the bar last night? And they looked young at that. I thought the legal drinking age was 21 but maybe I'm wrong. I mean, I don't drink. The only reason I went to this place is because my co-worker had her graduation shin-dig there. So, I have never seen a bunch of men dance together before. NEVER. These dudes were doing moves I had never seen before. And on top of that they thought they looked good. They were dancing in the mirror. Raising their shirts up to show their scrongey assed chests and tatoos. And freaking fat women. No offense but there were only a hand full of people there and all the cute people wouldn't even look in their direction. Well, I take that back, we were all looking so that we can get a good laugh. I mean it was hilarious. I know I haven't been out in a while but I feel like I've been in prison for 30 years to life after seeing the dance moves go on up in there. The big Somain thought she was Missy Elliot with a sweatsuit on. All they guys had on red. Everybody there was dirty, except for me and my man of course. And a couple of other people we met up there. I mean, dirty white sneakers. Who the hell wears dirty, scuffed up, white sneakers? And I swear (if I'm lying I'm flying) this ghetto ass Black chick had on some white flip-flops that looked Black as tar. Then the fish fry looking heffa tried to get hifey with me. I had to check her and her friend/sister/cousin/whatever she was. Not with my words but with my looks and action. I've been told that I have evil eyes plenty of times but that's nothing compared to the stare I gave them. I told them to test me. Matter-of-fact, I dared them to test me (all with my eyes of course) and they did. I had to puch both of them. Please don't try to come dance next to me and bump into me on purpose. First of all, I don't like being close to dirty or ugly people. Secondly, I'm very territorial about me space so please don't invade. You'll get pushed right back to your dirty side of the bar with the rest of the dirty locals like you did everytime. I'm a woman always but I'm not afraid to get down if you test me.   My hands hurt and this can go on and on. I'll finish at another date. This is enough writing for a month considering I rarely blod in my own journal. Until next time...

       urlLink     What Color is Your Brain?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     At work or in school: I work best by myself. I like to focus on my ideas until my desire for understanding is satisfied. I am easily bored if the subject holds no interest to me. Sometimes, it is hard for me to set priorities because so many things are of interest. With friends: I may seem reserved. Although my thoughts and feelings run deep, I am uneasy with frequent displays of emotion. I enjoy people who are interesting and of high integrity. With family: I am probably seen as a loner because I like a lot of private time to think. Sometimes, I find family activities boring and have difficulty following family rules that don't make sense to me. I show love by spending time with my family and sharing ideas and interests.

       What Would You Do?  Everyone has different reactions to different situations. So, what would you do if you came upon the following...  1. A person obviously struggling to keep their head above water in a pool or lake.  Jump in to help them.   2. You find a $100 bill on the floor in a store.  Pick it up and use it.   3. A dog or cat with a broken leash wandering aimlessly in your neighborhood.  Ignore it or tell a neighbor. I'm scared of animals.   4. A person you don't know knocks on your door in the middle of the night claiming they have an emergency situation and want to use your telephone.  Call 9-1-1.   5. You see a car veer off the road and into the ditch.  I'd probably stop to see if I could help while calling 9-1-1.     urlLink

      I had a fantabulous Mother's Day. I went to Forbes Island with Rah-Nohn and his family. It's a beautiful restaurant. It wasn't too expensive and suprisingly, the food taste better than I expected.  My son broke mine and his grandmother's rose. He's so ruff. He just kept slpping against the table that the rose just end up falling off the stem.   Two downfalls that really didn't effect the day were the motion sickness I had. I actually vomitted. Why was I the only one who got sick? I guess you know what that means. No cruise for my honeymoon. I feel so bad because Rah-Nohn really wanted to go on a cruise. I didn't. Honestly though. I don't think I'll get sick on a huge cruise ship. This restaurant was really small. There were to group rooms that holds roughly 25 people each. Then there are two rooms under water. One room is a romantic setting with candlelights and three tables. The other had the bar and held about 15 people. Like I said, small restaurant.   We had to take a feery to get there which was only about a two minute ride so I wasn't expecting to get sick. I'm getting whoosing just thinking about.  I got a ton of clothes from my mother-in-law-to-be. Rah-Nohn and Jordan got me a camel colored suede jacket (too cute) and a cell phone. I'm finally mobile again.   Second downfall. We came up short for the bill. It all worked out but it's always hard to keep tabs when you have a large group trying to pay for a bill. It never fells. The bill always comes up short.  All in all, it was a great day.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : what else? Oldies. [ watching ] : my wedding invite list grow. [ reading ] : my e-mails.

      Since I've been making my job the time to get all my personal endeavors handled I feel like I don't have time to do things that need to be done here in the admissions office. I have this stupid elearning course to complete by tomorrow and I have so many people that I need to e-mail and some more applications to fill out before the deadlines approach.  Hey, I obviously need a new job if I have all this free time to roam around in the blog world. I feel like I'm capable of so much but I'm not using my brain here anymore. I know this job like I know how to drive. After driving for so long you figure how to maneuver it all situations (i.e. rains, traffic, while eating, and on the phone). I'm able to do my job and a million other things at a time so I feel like dead weight now.  I'm also getting worried that I'm spending so much time surfing. I mean, I get irritated when the phone rings here or when a patient comes in. Rather than admitting someone I want to be here. I think that's crazy. I need help and I think a new job is the first step. I'm just too damn bored here.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : my co-worker bicker about nonsense and yes it's the fat-ass who doesn't like to work.

      I NEVER drink. Okay very, very, rarely. Maybe twice a year but ever since our Memorial Day BBQ I've been hooked on these Smirnoff sour apple drinks. Not really hooked but I have had about five since the BBQ which is a lot considering I only drink twice within a 12-month time frame.   So last night I had me a bottle (and usually I don't drink the whole thing) but I did last night as I watched Season 1 of America's Next Top Model. I use to get so disgusted when I'd see people take a sip of an alcoholic beverage and then act like they were tipsy. Not anymore. No lie, I'm there after like three sips. And I drank the whole thing. Nothing crazy happened but I had some interesting dreams and since I'm starting to get addicted to my horoscope (which by the way, I said I would never be) I'm going to jot down some thoughts.  I don't remember which came first but I was a contestant on America's Top Model. I love Tyra by the way. And for some reason I had to put on a bathing suit for a shot and all the good ones were taken because I was late. Okay, it's coming back to me. The other dream came first so back up.  I was twisted. Driving while getting twisted which is very bad and I was supposed to be meeting up with my cousin at a restaurant. The weird thing is I've been trying to catch up with this girl FOREVER literally. We're the same age, live in Cali (aside from all other family), and never talk (okay seldomly) and rarely see each other. Her mother died my freshman year of college but met at the restaurant too (creepy). So because I'm twisted why do I run her over? She didn't die or anything but she was ill. Nothing major, no broken bones just bruises. She went to the hospital. I went in the restaurant and ate. Crazy huh?   So I'm late to the photo shoot. All the good swim suits are taken. I find one and go to put it on. No problems. Then another one of the contestants waves her celle at me. Apparently I have a call. I take (outside of course) and when I come back in I get chewed out obviously. And that's all I can remember. I thought this was very odd.

      Why was I so upset at Rah-Nohn? So what I talked on my cellphone for like two hours as if it were my home phone. Rah-Nohn used the night before so he should have put it back on the charger. And why did he have to go to work to fill out his questionnaire anyway?  So I drop him off. Drive to my mom's. Pick him up on the way home and while I'm on the phone cracking jokes about my pledging days the phone dies. Okay, no problem. You always have a little juicel eft after it satys off for a couple of minutes. My camphone is so stupid. It goes through this unnecessary, long, drawn out process before you even get to the main menu which meant that I had to use that extra juice, that really isn't there, just to get the phone one. Well, I was never able to use it. So I park in front of his building and honk the horn. He should here me right. He's the only one in there and it's like 10 pm on Sunday night so there should be no problem. Well, he never comes out.  I keep honking then I see the retarded looking security guard coming. I probably shouldn't call him retarded because I think he was. No lie. So I drive off just to make him think something was really up. Mean huh? Well, I was irritated because I knew at some point I was going to have to use a payphone, so I wanted to irritate someone else. I can be a real b-word some times.   So I drive down the street to the payphone. I don't have any change on me so I'm searching through the car. I get a bunch of nickels, dirty nickels at that, and realize that now the payphone costs 50 cents. WTF? What happened to a quarter? Luckilyu I had a couple of dimes. So why did the phone I was trying to use not work? I'm pissed because I keep trying and the oreo on the other phone is just talking about using the internet. I'm thinking what his stanking ass get off the line? I have an emergency and I have a sleep baby in the car. He gets off after I walk back to my car, runs in the gas staion to get some change, then gets his ass back on the phone talking about can I have your e-mail address. Mind you, he saw me walking towards the phone.   So I'm mad by now, not only do I have to result to using a damn pay phone, I have to wait for this oreo smoking a cigarette to get off his social call. So I stand right next to him (okay, close enough that he's not blowing smoke in my face) and I stare him down to let him know that he needs to get off. Finally, he's like "I'm about to e-mail you, are you able to get on the inet?"   I tell Rah-Nohn to bring his ass outside. The security guard is waiting for me so I drive to the other side just to make him mad. He comes to that side so I go back to where I started. He follows me again. In the process, Rah-Nohn is chasing me too. I thought that was hilarious. Why did the damn security guard card Rah-Nohn? So Rah-Nohn showed him his card too. He apologized and then told Rah-Nohn that he was a paranoid security guard. What an idiot. He could barely walk straight so how the hell did he think he would catch someone? Well, he damn near caught me and did card Rah-Nohn so maybe he can catch someone but damn, get a life. Well, that's his job but security guards get so underpayed. I'da been asleep in my car.  So, moral of the story...It's all Rah-Nohn's fault. Maybe I can blame Morjama too, she kept me on the phone asking questions. The bad thing about is I kept hearing these beeping sounds and told her that she needed to get rid of her low budget phone. I'm the one with a low budget phone. That's funny. I'm calling Saythala today and making her give me a new camphone.   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : same ole garbage my co-workers listen to everyday. Okay, it's not always garbage but the song now is.

      I applied for a Procurement Specialist position for the billing office of Sutter Community Hospitals. I went to BeBe and bought two suits, one pin strip (black and white)the other cream. I was preparing my speech and questions. Getting my references together. And even thinking about sending out thank you notes for the interviewers. Sutter always has panel interviews. Why did I get an e-mail the other day to notify me of the position being filled? I was so pissed. I thought my interview was Tuesday but it was Friday. Friday of the prior week. I am such an idiot. I really need a planner but I never use them anyway. Never even enter my schedule. Now if I had a palm pilot I'd use that...maybe but it's cute so maybe I'll ask someone to get me that for my b-day. It's in August so anybody who wants to be nice and contribute to a worthy cause can chip in.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : my co-worker talk about a comdeian joking about blow jobs.

The firend was driving while the couple was in the back. The boy kept push her head down and she'd stay down for a couple seconds then pop her head back up and he'd say somethin. Looked like she was pleading to me but he'd just push her head right back down. Yea, I'm nosy. I slowed down to see if what I was seeing was really what I was seeing. What is this world coming to ?

      So , I went clubbin for the first time in many months. It was cool. A little too many "others" but my D was throwing the party so I had a good time. The usual hip-hop/R & B upstairs and a live jazz band down. The music was on point but the singer was awful. And she was signing other people's shit. I don't know what they deal was with that but the atmosphere was cool. As well as the ambiance. Who woulda thought Jitney's we be so respectable being that it's on Kearney and Broadway surrounded by all the Asian strip clubs.  Why did I know all the Black people there. I swear I can never go somewhere without the crew from V-town being there? I guess everybody is connected to Demetrius and we're all cheap. Knowing the promoter is always a good thing. I knew people there from SFSU, from high school, from sorority, and from just around. That was a trip.  So why was my ex there? I'm talking dude right before the soon-to-be-hubby. The "one" (at least I thought so at the time). I tried my damnest not to look at him but hey, how can I not when he's staring me down?   So this dude comes up to me when Rah-Nohn goes to the bar asking how you been, so you're getting married this year, and how's the baby? Nigga what? All I could say is um hmmm. I know that sounds crazy but whatever, I wanted him out of my face. Then this fool has nerve to shake my hand and rub my arm.   This is what happens when you come from a small little area. Everybody knows you business. I don't even associate with any of his friends so how the hell does he know that I'm getting married? I mean yea, he did keep glancing at my ring but really, to throw in this year. Oh, and did I forget the congratulations, I'm happy for you, really.  He just wanted to see if he was still in there. And I was looking damn good so I couldn't help but to keep looking at myself in the mirror and who did I notice staring at me? Yea. He still wants me. We were still good friends for a while, even while I was pregnant but it just became too problematic.   I guess that's why I had two dreams about him last week. I was going to see him. Mind you, I haven't seen this fool for almost two years.     Ambiance: [ listening to ] : Rain Drops Falling On My Dreads (oops, I mean Head). I'm way too into Jordan's Gymboree music class.

      Okay, so I'm a day late. So what. Always a day late because I don't have time to get on the internet at home. I'm always to busy with Jordan.   What's one thing you're thankful that you can use everyday?  Well, aside from soap, water, and toothpaste I am extremely thankful for my flat iron. And it's not just any flat iron. It's a Helen of Troy flat iron. It's the only one that'll get my hair straight. I don't have a perm so if I don't straighten my hair it looks like a big mess to me. And when I say big, I'm talking Kelis big. So, thank Helen of Troy for getting the job done.

      I love Lauryn Hill. I love her latest CD, MTV unplugged and I've been listening to it over and over again trying to figure out if it's the same music for each song.

I need to figure out what kind of shoes I need to wear, if I want a veil or tiara or both, and how I'm going to wear my hair. They'll probably kick me out because I plan on doing all this stuuf there and with their help.

      If you could acquire only one special talent what would it be?  Well, I really wish I could sing. I mean, REALLY sing. You know, like my twin Beyonce (ha, she's so gorgeous and so is her body), or Lauryn Hill, or Erykah Badu. I know those are three different extremes in vocal talent but I love those ladies any one of those voices will do. Don't get me wrong, I just want to be able to hum around the house, sing a lullaby to my son, or serenade my man. Hell, I'd be happy if I could just hold a tune like J.Lo. I'm not trying to be rich or become a star. (Well, maybe I am but not with a singing career). But, since there's absolutely nothing I can do about my voice I'll choose something else. Something that I can work on.  I wish I were more artistic and creative. I mean, I'm so whimsical so why can't I ever bring anything to light?   Ambiance: [ listening to ] : the same ole crap I listen to everyday. I'm not complaining though because my supervisor spoils us.

      --That I'm irritated today. I just love the way my supervisors keep using me to train     people. I'd much rather be surfing the web than showing people what to do in this    damn data system. Especially when it's people I don't know because I usually don't    like people that I don't know. I know that sounds crazy but I'm crazy like that.  --That I am not keeping my word to myself, or my viewers which isn't very many. I am    supposed to be writing in this thing daily and real stuff not this looked over BS. I    promise it's coming. I'm still trying to get use to and comfortable telling my    feeling, thoughts, and business.  --That I'm a BIG baby most of the time and when I don't get my way I make you suffer    greatly.  --That I have insecurities and I mask them most of the time.  --That I think I'm the bomb and I expect everyone else to think so as well.  --That I have pretty hard standards, and not just on many but people in general but    the rules don't apply to everyone. Oh no, me and my friends are excluded.  --That I'm hard on people, especially when I don't know them and/or don't like them    which is the same thing to me, sometimes.

      So the other day, Friday to be exact, I was talking about horoscopes. I wanted mine to come true. Then yesterday I mentioned that my horoscope is always a couple of days off. Well, yesterday I got a call from Suuter Connect to come in for an interview. I'm half way excited but I don't even remember what the job was for needless to say I didn't even save the job description.   Anywho, wish me luck. The interview is next Tuesday. I'm going to purchuse myself a new business suit, probably from Bebe and even though I don't plan on being in Cali for long after my wedding a couple of extra dollars in my pocket and some good work experience won't be bad.

      I'm so sad right now. I can't even begin to imagine what it would feel like to lose my son. When I got the call I was in denial. Actually, I still am. My line sister, my soror, my friend just lost her son. That's such a horrible thing. We are so much alike. Both Virgos, both ambitious, both loving creatures.   So Dianne calls and says, "Are you busy sands?" She never calls me that way. She's usually chipper, always asks how I'm doing, then asks if I'm busy. I can tell in her voice that something was wrong but I was expecting it to be about my other line sister. There were four of us that crossed. I said, "Why? What's up?" Not a usual line for me either. Just weird. Last night was just different. She said, "Porcher's son died..." I was screaming "WHAT? NO!" and a bunch of other things in my mind. I still can't believe it.  I was there for his first hospitalization. For his surgery. For his mother when she needed me. I just talked to him a couple of weeks ago. He was fine...well, as fine as can be expected. He was potty trained to a certain extent. He was laughing, playing, having fun, getting in trouble.  So the odds were a 90% survival rate after age 3. He turned 3 Feb 16th. What went wrong? He has a disorder called Herschman's and I'm sure I spelled that wrong. It's when you're intestines don't break down the food so digetion is extremely interrupted.   So Dianne and I call Procher. Of course she doesn't answer. This is typical of her. She's a very private person. VERY! I mean this girl moved to SC and didn't tell anyone. NOBODY. She'd send me random e-mails but no info on where she was or what she was doing. Just enough to know that she's a live and well. A picture of Devin here and there but for the  most part she was incognito.   So Dianne leaves a message. I was scared to talk. Don't ask me why. Probably because I have a son I know what I'd being going through if anything happened to my son. So Dianne and I get off. I don't know what to do at this point. I mean I know she's not home and I wanted the because I wanted to send flowers to the chapel. By the way, the funeral is today at 2 p.m. So I tell her to call me when she gets a chance. I tell her that I know her and anytime is good. "I'm always there for you", I tell her.  So I start thinking, how can I get a hold of her. I know Devin's father's name but can't spell it for the life of me. I have access to all patient records within the Sutter Community Hospitals so I'm thinking how I'm going to get his family's number. I almost called a co-worker to find the info for me right then and there. I know I sound like a stalker but hey. That's my sands. I want to make sure she's okay.   I try calling information to get her grandma's phone number. Um, so they can't find that information from the address. Who, knew? Not me. I search the phone books for any signs of the last name. No luck. I finally make myself stop. I was so tired already. I had a couple of phone calls to make and it was already after 10 p.m. which means it was 1 a.m. in Charleston. So I eventually get ready for bed. Who calls, Porcher. I was super duper shocked because I didn't expect to hear from her for about three months.  So sad. Poor baby died in his sleep. She was about to change his diaper. She turned around to get it. Turned back around and he was gone. She told me she had been crying for days. The hospital couldn't resisitate him. She was up trying to finish the programs. I hope she calls me soon. I know she's the type to keep things bottled up inside which isn't always a good thing.   I wouldn't say that I'm having a bad day but I haven't smiled, laughed, or really even spoke to anyone yet. I am happy that Dianne sent some Oriental Lillies. They are so beautiful. She's always on the ball of things. I thought I was but she handled everything and put all our names on the card. Ivy, # 1, 4, and 5.  Will things ever be the same? I don't even think I'll feel comfortble talking about Jordan to her. How can I share happy thoughts about my child knowing she's in pain because her's is no longer here?  And people think I'm crazy for giving my son EVERYTHING and more. Life is not promised so why not enjoy yourself while you're here? At least I know that if anything happened to Jordan he'll go happily. So what if he's spoiled, so what if he has it all, so what if he grows up and doesn't appreciate any of it. As long as he knows he's loved that's all that matters to me. I don't want my child to suffer. EVER. I know that's a crazy thing to say but that's the way I feel.

      So I got to work late. Had a lot of work to do since it's the beginning of the month and I'm just getting around to the blog world. I'm kinda upset because I told myself I'd do all the weekly activities and I'm already not abiding. So....tomorrow, weekend re-caps, meme's, and mp3 monday's.

       THE MAYONNAISE JAR AND A CUP OF COFFEE    When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar...and the coffee... A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with an unanimous "yes." The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed. "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, " I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things-your God, family, your children, your health, your friends, and your favorite passions-things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, and your car. The sand is everything else-the small stuff. "If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal." Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand. One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented. The professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend." Please share this with someone you care about. Have a blessed day!!    Thanks  urlLink Rhachelle !   Ambiance:  [ listening to ] : my co-workers complain about the psychiatrists within our hospital.

      My supervisor is back. His boyfriend has like 48 hours to live but he seems to be in a much better mood than he was in before he left. I'm glad he had time to get everything situated as far as funeral arrangements, insurance policies, and closure&nbsp;are concerned. Now with that said, I'm hella cold. Why did he come back and start regulating the air condition. This is another reason why fat people irk me.  Don't get me wrong, he's by no means as big as the fat ass but he's big and this air is driving me class. He offered to let me leave early and I'm seriously considering it simply because I'm up in here freezing. Plus I have a billion things to get done.   print out the rest of the names on the envelopes so I can mail out the wedding invitations. I know, I know. I'm hella late. What can I say? I operate on CPT. No one is going to RSVP anyway.  change the cake order. The flavors need to go in a different order and I found a picture of a cake that I absoultely love. If I had found it on the inet I would post it but you'll see the pictures once after the wedding.  grocery shop. I need to cook some food. Who do I think I am eating out every night? Not only am I a mother but I'm about to be a wife. It's time to start cooking, or at least learning how to right?  cleaning is always good. I doubt I'll get to that though.   and what I really, truly would love to do is go to sleep. I'm so tired. I haven't been able to catch up on my sleep since last week. Vegas didn't help.   &nbsp; Ambiance:  [ listening to ] : phones ringing off the hook. I can't think clearly right now. [ watching ] : work build up on me desk. Maybe I'm not leaving early.

      VEGAS! What can I say? Too much to do. So little time.   Don't you just love your friends? I know I love my friends. Upon meeting up at the airport I was presented with a veil that I was suppose to wear the ENTIRE weekend. That didn't fly well with me although I did wear it the first night, and to our benefit I'd like to add.      Highlights:        Olympic Garden ,&nbsp;a strip club. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. I think the majority of the strippers were gay to be honest. There's just something about a man prancing around ( yes, they were prancing )&nbsp;a stage in a thong that makes my stomach quessy.&nbsp;   Oxygen.  15 mins of flavored oxygen plus a back massage for only $10. Who could beat that price? I was breathing the scent of lavender and passion fruit for at least three hours after my oxygen treatment.    Rum Jungle.  I love that club. So what they played all the good music while we were waiting in line (hip-hop and reggae dance hall). So what we had to dance to disco and techno majority of our time spent there. It was still fun and the ol' school finally kicked in.   Paris . We spent majority of Saturday shopping. Unfortunately I didn't buy anything but I saw a lot of great sales. BCBG had about 5&nbsp;70% off racks.   Gambling . I only lost $20, give or take a couple of dollars.   Baby on a Hummer.  Why did these ghetto women put they're baby on a rental car and took a picture of him. Mind you, it was 2 o'clock in the morning. What they hell was a baby doing out at 2 o'clock in the morning anyway?   Daryls' legs . I don't know if I was twisted or what but this guys legs were hilarious. He had on shorts( and was sagging hella hard), high top sneakers, and socks. When I busted out laughing he came up to me and carried on the longest conversation with me in the history of conversations. And it was about drinking, something I have no clue how to discuss. I think the conversation felt so long because I was dying to have someone else look and tell me if they thought his legs were as funny as I thought they were. Morjama thought so.     Things I wanted to do but didn't (all the important stuff):     rides  henna tatoo  belly button piercing  spa treatment  gamble more (but with someone else's money)  get a little more twisted  stay in a suite  take more pictures in front of different sites  see some shows  I'll be back with more later.

       Memory Lane   If you're over the age of 21 you will enjoy&nbsp;this...   When I was a kid adults used to bore me to tears with their tedious diatribes about how hard things were when they were growing up; what with walking twenty-five miles to school every morning uphill both ways through year 'round blizzards carrying their younger siblings on their backs to their one-room schoolhouse where they maintained a straight-A average despite their full-time after-school job at the local textile mill where they worked for 35 cents an hour just to help keep their family from starving to death!! And I remember promising myself that when I grew up there was no way in hell I was going to lay a bunch of crap like that on kids about how hard I had it and how easy they've got it.  But.... Now that I've reached the ripe old age of twenty-five, I can't help but look around and notice the youth of today. You've got it so fuckin' easy. I&nbsp; mean, compared to my childhood, you live in a goddamned Utopia. And I hate to say it but you kids today you don't know how good you've got it. I&nbsp; mean, when I was a kid we didn't have The Internet--when we wanted to know something, we had to go to the goddamned library and look it up ourselves. And there was no email. We had to actually write somebody a letter--with a pen. And then you had to walk all the way across the street and put it in the fuckin' mailbox and it would take a week to get there. And there were no MP3s or Napsters. You wanted to steal music, you had to go to the goddamned record store and shoplift it yourself. Or we had to wait around all day to tape it off the radio and the DJ'd usually talk over the begining and fuck it all up. You want to hear about hardship?   You couldn't just download porn. You had&nbsp; to bribe some homeless dude to buy you a copy of "Hustler" at the 7-11. It&nbsp; was either that or jackoff to the lingerie section of the JC Penney catalogue. Those were your options. We didn't have fancy shit like Call Waiting. If you were on the phone and somebody else called they got a busy signal. And we didn't have fancy Caller ID Boxes either. When the the phone rang, you had no idea who it was it could be your boss, your mom, a collections agent, your drug dealer, you didn't know... You just had to pick it up and take your chances, mister. And we didn't have any fancy Sony Playstation videogames with high-resolution 3-D graphics. We had the Atari 2600. With games like "Space Invaders" and "Asteroids" and the graphics sucked ass. Your guy was a little square. You had to use your imagination. And there were no multiple levels or screens, it was just one screen forever. And you could never win, the game just kept getting harder and faster until you died. Just like LIFE.   When you went to the movie theatre there no such thing as stadium seating.&nbsp; All the seats were the same height. A tall guy sat in front of you, you were screwed. And sure, we had cable television, but back then that was only like 20 channels and there was no onscreen menu. You had to use a little book called a TV Guide to find out what was on. And there was no Cartoon Network. You could only get cartoons on Saturday&nbsp; morning... ....D'ya hear what the fuck I'm saying? We had to wait ALL WEEK, you spoiled little bastards. That's exactly what I'm talking about. You kids today have got it too easy. You're spoiled, I swear to God. You guys wouldn't last five minutes back in 1984.

      Today is the day that my infamous bachelorette party starts.&nbsp; I guess I haven't did very much talking about it but it's here and I can't wait. This week has been the most horrible week that I can remember in a long time and it's all over. Well, after a couple of more errands that is.   I've been late to work every single day this week except yesterday. I've gotten little to no sleep. I think I have insomnia. It's like that night before the first day of middle school. You're just up. You're dead tired but there's too much anxiety inside to actually go to sleep. So what's causing the anxiety you ask? I'm trying to figure that out myself. I don't know if I'm stressed because I'm broke, because the wedding is drawing nearer and things still aren't intact, because I'm getting ready for this bachelorette party, or just because Jordan's been very active lately. Whatever it is it's beating me up.   BUT, not as bad as Vegas will. This was all suppose to be a big suprise but somebody spilled the beans. But really, how far would we have gotten without me figuring out what was going on? It would have been bomb though if they could of pulled it off until the airport.   So I have friends from all realms of my life coming. Friends from jr high and high school, sorors, college buddies, and family. This will definately be an experience. How many people can say that they're friends took them to Vegas to celebrate their last days, weeks, months (in my case) of being a single woman? *raising my hand,&nbsp;slouching down a little because everyone's staring at me*   So the plan? I have no idea. Why tell me about the trip but don't give me any details about the events? I want to know how to dress for each occassion. I'm bringing enough gear to change three times a day. It's that a little overboard? Oh well. It's going to be in the triple digits out there so who wants to be stuck in the same smelling, wet, outfit ALL day long? And my hair...I have no clue what I'm going to do with it.&nbsp;I don't do braids and it's too much to just wear down in that heat. I guess I'll have a wet back ponytail as usual. I look so plain with my hair in a ponytail but hey, who do I have to impress? My man is going to be at home babysitting Jordan daydreaming about me. Yea right. He's already planned to drop Jordan off tonight and hit the streets. What is it about partying in Chico that people love so much? Maybe it's just Rah-Nohn. Plus, I hear there's a delta convention going on so I'm going to have to deal with a bunch of greek madness. Hopefully I won't see anyone I know.   Things still on my to-do list (and all between 3 -&nbsp;7 p.m.):    pedicure  find some sandals and dress shoes (for da club)  clean the kitchen  shower and shave  pack   I hope I complete my tasks. I'm going to be in Vegas with a bunch of half fits. You know, a cute dress but no shoes to match, some bomb capris but no shirt. And I should really invest in some normal pajama's. Damn, do I need to bring a bathing suit? Okay, this is starting to boggle my head now.   &nbsp;  I'll be back with details and pictures. &nbsp;

      Why did she just tell me to remember to fill the paper trays and coffee machine. First I ignored her because I ALWAYS complete my job before I leave, even if that requires me to stay after for a couple extra minutes. Then I thought about what she said. Fill the coffee machine? WTF??? I looked at her in utter disgust because FAT people disgust me as you already know.  My reply, I don't fill the coffee machine. I don't drink coffee. And why would even say something like that to me when you know I don't drink coffee. This woman drives me crazy. If there's one thing I HATE about this job, she's IT. I take that back, I shouldn't hate any of God's creatures. But she's as close as it gets to HATE.  Ambiance:  [ listening to ] : Pretty Woman. [ watching ] : this fat ass&nbsp;in disgust. [ reading ] : my e-mails. [ random ] : I'm soooo hungry but I'm soooo broke.

      Jordan was so congested last night. I mean to the point where he couldn't even breath out of his&nbsp; nose so needless to say, we were ALL uncomfortable. We tried dimetapp, the humidifier, and actually sitting in a steamy bathroom but all to no avail. So finally Rah-nohn goes to the pharmacy around 4 am. I don't know why I didnt think of this on my own because you know, I know everything. Well the pharmacist suggested Saline solution. Duh? I knew that. Like I said, I know everything and we even had some at home. Oh well, now we have a back up. I squirted him a couple of times. This is obviously something you can't over dose on. I left a message for my supervisor because it was obvious to me by that time he wouldn't be able to go to school if he couldn't breath out of his nose.   Well, he woke laughing. He was feeling so much better and I am so happy. His nose was draining like crazy so I got and begin getting ready. There's no way I can go a work day without getting on the internet. Just kidding, kinda. As you will see yesterday I can't afford to take anytime off and I'm trying to save some PTO for the honeymoon that I may or may not be able to afford.  While in the shower my sup called and told me to stay home, they could manage without me but it's always a pleasure. I told her I was coming in and to sit tight. When I got to work she had a breakfast burrito waiting for me at my desk. How am I ever going to leave her???  I'll tell you how. More money. Ha!  &nbsp;

       urlLink Monday Madness    &nbsp;  1. Do you prefer to be out in the sun or in the shade?   It depends on how&nbsp;hot it is. A tan is always good but I burn easily and I tend to not use sunscreen.    2. Regarding the walls in your house, do you prefer neutral colors or bright colors?   &nbsp;Depends on the room. Cureently, everything is white but I want to change one wall to red and the rest to a creamish-brown color. I know it doesn't sound very appealing but believe me, it will look fantabulous with my furniture. Jordan's walls are little blue at the bottom portion and white above the wallpaper border. I want lavender in my bedroom. All colors are good for me. White is just too bland.    3. When hanging pictures on your walls, do you like things symmetric or asymmetric?   Depends on the wall and what effect I'm going for. Can you tell that I'm very indecisive yet? But really, it has nothing to do with being indecisive, it's all about attitude.    4. How about where you'd like to live; country or city?   Ideally: New York or a foreign country like Italy or Brazil. Funny huh? I've never been but from the pictures and culture I'm in love. Realistically: Dallas/Ft Worth area because 1) it's cheap and 2) both Rah-Nohn and I have family there.    5. Your blog; Blogger, Blogdrive, Blog-City, or another one altogether?   &nbsp;Blogger.    6. Email; Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, or other?   Hotmail for personal and gmail for the-vine listserve.    7. Air conditioning or just a fan when it's hot at night?   Either or is fine as long as it does the job. I KEEP the ceiling fan on at all times in my room. Hot or cold.    8. Dinner; seafood or steak ?  Both although seafood is my favorite.    9. Your all-time favorite music media; CD's, cassette tapes, or vinyl (or 8-tracks)?   CD's, they're so much easier.    10. When learning a new software program, do you find it easier to follow a book or an online tutorial?   Online tutorial even though I usually figure it out on my own.   Ambiance:  [ listening to ] : oldies.  [ watching ] : time past and I still haven't completed my projects for the day. Personal projects for my wedding that is.  [ reading ] : nothing.  [ random ] : I can't wait to go to sleep.

      So yesterday before the electricity went out I was in a good mood. I was excited because my mom just bought a timeshare I can have a fantabulous honeymoon. Well, that dream is shattered. I really want to go to Italy or Greece. i don't even know if it's safe for Americans over there of Black people for that matter but the countries just look so beautiful according to the pictures that I've seen. And doesn't Venice sound romantic? I though so too. Rah-Nohn is still on this Caribbean kick and rightfully so. The weather will be much nicer and we can see a lot in a little time whereas needing at least 10 days in the ancient world. Why would I spend all that moeny on a plane ticket for my time to be so limited that I'm not able to see every nook and cranny? Plus, there's no way I'm leaving my baby for 10 days. The longest I've been away from him is a weekend so 5 days is pushing in my opinion. &nbsp; But Venice is like the perfect locatin. Italy is only the size of Arizona and Venice is located centrally so I could be in Tuscany, Rome, and Milan in a matter of hours. And I hear the currency exchange over there is great. Well... &nbsp; Stupid me, I pay Jordan's childcare in cash and I've never even thought about getting a receipt. I mean, he's been going there since January and I've never had any problems. Until now. They lost my $400 cash and are trying to make me pay it back. Well, they're not TRYING to make me pay, they ARE making me pay it. So not only do I have to pay $800/month but now I have to pay an extra $400. I was seriously thinking about taking him out and finding another place but his father doesn't think $400 is a high price to pay for Jordan's happiness. I agree but I KNOW I paid so why am I being penalized. Oh, stupid me, I never asked for a receipt. But it's not like I'm one of those parents with a million excuses. I always pay on time. When I forget to bring wipes and diapers I pick up Jordan, go to Target the bring back the wipes. Even when he was only going part-time and I know he wasn't going through 180 wipes a month but whatever. I complied. &nbsp; I told them I'd pay $200 and leave it alone. They weer like no go. So I told them I'd pay them $25 a pay period. That's just pathetic. I'm paying the debt off when I get paid Friday which means that I'm going to be broke in Vegas because I also have to get my car repaired. &nbsp; So after hearing the bad news about the money I went to go home and I couldn't turn the key in my car. Something is wrong with the ignition. It's like a million degrees in Sacramento so in the midst of me trying to turn the key Jordan is sweating bullets. I take out the stroller and lock the keys in the car. I was so disgusted. Luckily I live right around the corner so I begin strolling Jordan home. Why does he see a park a hops out of the stroller. Children are dare evils aren't they? So I finally get home and realize that I don't have my keys. Duh? And by this time I have to use the bathroom really bad. Luckily (nd I don't approve of this at all) Rah-Nohn had left the back door open. We got in. My friend let us use her AAA but now I have to put my car in the shop again and rent another car. When will the bills end?  &nbsp; I just got my car out the shop a couple of weeks mind you. I'm so frustrated about this whole ideal. The childcare incident particularly. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Why the f--- did I just write a long a-- post, a&nbsp; meaning a-- post, a creative, fun, and intriguing a-- post and the power cut out just as I was finishing!?! I'm so pissed. I want to cuss out my co-workers and these stupid a-- people who keep calling with dumb a-- questions. My response to everything coming my way is "I don't know anyone excepting new outpatients" and "Call 9-1-1"  (BITCH!) in my mind of course. &nbsp; Okay, from this entry you'd probably think I was ready to kill someone but honestly, I'm laughing. Laughing to keep myself from killing someone of course.  &nbsp; This is a tragedy. I'll be back with a condensed version of what I wrote earlier.  Ambiance:  [ listening to ] : my co-worker complain about each other behind their backs. Why does everyone feel like they can trust me? Little old Black Jewish Princess is what they call me. Is that an insult? I don't even know what the crap means but I wear the crown with pride. Silly me. [ watching ] : work pile and pile as I chit chat with friends and play on the inet. [ reading ] : e-mails up the ying-yang. Ha! [ random ] : More to come soon. Really! I'm promise, by the end of this day. Maybe...I'm hyper for some reason.

      I'm not missing this one. No way, no how. I refuse. I'm going absolutely nowehere with Sutter. I feel stuck, I mean like I just took two blunts to the face. I'm so stagnant here. I've mastered this position which means it's definately time to move on. The position I'm applying for doesn't pay much more than what I make now but I'll have a lot more responsibility and if I mastere this one within the month that I know I will at least I have something more to put on my resume.  Wish me luck. I'm really going to need it. Did I ever mention that I have a phobia of speaking in front of people? Well, I do. Especially when it comes to jobs interviews. And don't let me get stuck in a panel interview. I practice, I rehearse, I take notes, but I still get all choked up in the interview. I'm talking, I forgot everything I've rehearsed and I actually fumble in the interview and let them see my sweat. So not good but I have to nail this interview today because I'm going crazy here. I'm on the web more than I am the phones which is not good since majority of my job is acting as liaison between the business office and insurance companies.    Ambiance: [ listening to ] : my co-worker's ramble about people, jobs, and time off.

      FINE This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and youneed to shut up.  FIVE MINUTES If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour. Five minutes is only fiveminutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to watch the game beforehelping around the house.  NOTHING This is the calm before the storm.This means "something," and you should beon your toes. Arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually end in "Fine"  GO AHEAD This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it.  LOUD SIGH This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement oftenmisunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot andwonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over"Nothing"  THAT'S OKAY This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man."That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard before decidinghow and when you will pay for your mistake.  THANKS A woman is thanking you. Do not question it or faint. Just say "You'rewelcome."

      last weekend i did a promotion with farnsworth bentley and courvousier.  (i know i spelled that wrong. so what, i don't feel like looking up the spelling.)  did you guys know he had his own drink? i didn't but i rarely drink. so. we had to escort him to a club to promote the alcohol obviously but ehy did we have to carry umbrellas too. it was hilarious. i was embarrassed. the club was empty. the vip was on point. bentley was cool. his girlfriend was nicer. yes girlfriend. he's not gay. she's the girl from white chicks. i didn't see the movie so i don't know which one. oh, and he looks better in person. why did we have to wear these hideous outfits? i looked like a cocktail waitress. i'll post the pictures this weekend. let me give you the details now.  my friend to me to e-mail the promoter for something totally different. a midori promo for saturday. she e-mailed back asking if i could ride around oakland with bentley in his limo to promote his new drink. ummmmm, i have a real job. SORRY! so she wanted me to do the club thing. cool. it was from 8 to 2. don't ask me why. i only actually worked for 2 1/2 hours and it was so easy. why not get paid for sitting around looking cute (well, i looked like a fool but hey, they were paying me to think i was looking cute.)  i get to the hotel and girls are just chillin. i mean eating stankin ass sandwhiches with onions. WTF? and they were hella ghetto. i mean when we were in the limo with bentley and his assistant they were like can you turn the station, stop torturing us. bold huh? so we get dressed, get our make-up done, and wait. finally, we got to his hotel which by the way was not tight. i mean, the room may have been but nothing in oakland is nice.  so we're waiting on this fool for like a hour. apparently, the club contact was like it's not enough people her yet. the ghetto chicks are telling the limo driver that they are hungry and bentley needs to get this thing moving along. he finally agrees to buy us a pizza but we end up leaving before it go there.  so bentley's like greeting everyone and people have attitudes. i'm not one to be a groupie so i'm in my own convo. the singer for my wedding is in the car so she's singing the song to me and other people are sleep. whatever. we get there but why we weren't practicing out grand entrance while were at the hotel waiting for the crowd to get "thicker" is beyond me. we don't know what the fuck we're doing a neither does bentley. people were laughing. nobody was in the club. apparently it was poppin early but we took so long that people thought it was a lie and left.  now the vip was cool. they had two girls doing massages in their fancy shancy chairs. they also had two girls doing maicures. so our job was to go out a pick the "Perfect Gentleman" in the crowd. WTF??? what since does that make for a courvoisier  (i couldn't help myself, i had to corredct it.)   promo with farnsworth bentley? now another night it would have been cool.  when the guys came back we placed robes and pimp hats on them then took a picture of them along with bentley. he autographed them. what a bore. people weren't even trying to sneak into the vip, oh except for this african guy. it was hilarious. i saw him sneak in but i was like whatever, they're not paying me to be security. he ended up taking like 5 pictures with bentley. he was even jumping in other people's pictures like we use to do in high school. finally, my girl told him to leave because she wasn't taking anymore pictures of him.  he thanked us. i brought my tired butt home. went to work at like 10 am then went on a job interview that i thought went well. i haven't heard anything back yet. i'm calling them today. it's driving me crazy.  the position seems like it'll be cool. this is the first interview i didn't panic in. i didn't have time to obsess over possible questions and answers so i was super duper nervous but i felt the most comfortable with panel than i ever have in any interview so i was sure i got it. they said they'd be making their selection by the beginning of this week. i'm bummed. i know they're hiring at least 7 people but every one passed their logic test. what a poor excuse for a weeding out process.  the only downfall to the position is that there's a mandatory 5 week training and a exiting exam. that's not a problem, it's open book open notes, how hard can that be? the problem is, i'll have to work the day friday before and monday after my wedding weekend. that also means no honeymoon. well, i should say a delayed honeymoon. i guess it's not that big a deal once i think about it though because i'd be getting a $4 raise. keep your fingers crossed. i'm calling around lunchtime.     Ambiance:   [ listening to ] :  U Got Nerve by Aaliyah  [ watching ] :  time go by s-l-o-w-l-y. we won't be having any admits today. i want to go home so bad and clean. why can't they keep nurses in this damn facility?

      So Wednesday, the same day my horoscope was right on target something strange happened to me at the mall. I was waiting for Jordan's chicken and fries at the A & W bar when a Latina came up to me and asked for the time. I told her then she asked if she could give me her card. Sure, why not? She then tells me that she's a psychic reader and would like to have a session with me. Ummm, so I told her that it was against my religion. If I change my mind, call her. Whatever. Then she told me that she sees a lot of good things in my very near future? I know I shouldn't be taking this to heart but I have a job interview today. A panel interview which makes it all the more worst. Could this be what she was talking about? I mean, granted I get the job I'll be at a $4/hour raise. Wish me luck everyone.

      My horoscope is right on target today. I know most people don't believe in them, it's a sin, it's never right, and all that jazz but guess what...too bad.

You might not be totally familiar with the type of work involved, but today your mind is sharp and so you'll probably pick it up quickly. The only downside: You could well work harder than you need to, and therefore there's a danger of tiring yourself out. Take care of yourself.

      So Jordan will be staying with Rah-Nohn's mom while we're on our honeymoon and guess what she told us. Well, her and Jordan are planning a trip to the Dominican Republic while we're honeymooing. Can you believe that? My baby will be out of the country too. I wish I were as lucky as him. My first trip out of the country was when he was 11 months. And he came along by the way. I thinks it's good for him though. I just hope I can continue on trips out the country when he's old enough to remember and able to learn about the cultures we're exposed to.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] :  I'm Crazy For You , Madonna.

      Saturday I spent the entire day tying some lose ends for my wedding. I still have a tone of things to do. Maybe two tons but I'd say things are starting to fall into place slowly. I still have to have a bridal shower. *sidenote* I went to my mom's this weekend and totally forgot to bring my pictures to download to my photolog. Maybe next weekend. Plus, my little brother wouldn't even give me two minutes to check my e-mail.  So, the weather started cooling off this weekend which wasn't a bad thing since it had been in the triple digits but why is it cold today??? I may have to find a church to have my wedding in and that would be horrible since I've been dreaming of this beautiful garden wedding ALLL MY LIFE. First I was worried that it'd be to hot and now this. I can't wait for this day to come. So what I have six weeks. If it's like this on my wedding day it'll be a travesty. Wish me luck. And chant for the sun to shine. I did this once. Well, it was a raining and I went to school looking a hot mess. Okay, my hair was just back in an ugly bun. (This is junior high by the way) I sat in class the whole period chanting: "I wish it would rain, I wish it would poor" I remember this day in detail. Where the class was located, who the teacher was and the subject she was teaching. I even remember the people in the class. I may not know all their names but I'm visualizing their faces right now as I type. They all thought I was crazy but when the rain started falling the thought I was Indian (Native American). It was the funniest thing I'd every witnessed because I don't know why it happened. I saw this on a episode of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyete. Who'da thought?  My point? It better not be glooming and cold on my wedding day.  Ambiance: [ listening to ] : The First Cut is the Deepest by Sheryl Crow. [ watching ] :  work pile on my desk.
