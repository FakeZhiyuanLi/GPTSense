						   So anyways This summer is gonna be a blast! At like the very end of last summer, I got to go to San Antonio, Texas and I went to Fiesta Texas Six Flags. That was great cuz it was also a water park so we went there and had fun. Well, this summer, I get to go back! Not to mention oklahoma,NORWAY,and colorado.  The plan for my summer is as following: 1. We leave for this awesome retreat thing on sunday. 2. Come back and like two days later we head for the states 3. Stop in San Antonio for a couple of days and go to six flags 4. Then head to oklahoma where Im gonna shop my butt off!!.. haha 5. Catch a plane to NORWAY 6. Come back to the states and visit all these churches in  Colorado and im gonna see these friends that I havent seen since I was like 9. 7. Then come home in like august. So yeah, thats my plan for this awesome summer! Now you see my reasoning?? Aight, well, this blog has been all about me, so after you read this, post and tell me how you're summer is going or how it is gonna go.. haha. Aight, catch ya'll later!! Grace
