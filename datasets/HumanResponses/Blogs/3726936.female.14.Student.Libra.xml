      *beforehand* I was watching a horror movie called Salem's Lot. I don't know why...I'm not good with scary movies. They...erm  scare me . I went up to bed and started freaking out because I was so afraid. I was sweating and shaking and generally freaking out because of this dumb movie.  My mind kept flashing to this image the movie had shown, with a long-dead boy tearing apart his mother's stomach-flesh and licking up the blood. It was awful. Anyhow, I started to pray and ask the Lord for peace like I always do when I'm in trouble, and I fell asleep soon after, feeling safe and unafraid.   *while sleeping* I dreamt I was in my church building, Bread of Life Assemblies of God. I could see that it was a very dark summer night outside. The pale walls had lare open spaces in them, like large windows without glass in them. Demons were fling towards the windows, and trying to get into the church. All the church members were there, and so they stood in front of the windows, holding Bibles and rebuking the demons in the name of the Lord. Every time this happened the demons would be thrown back. One strong demon managed to get into the church. We (the church members) all spread out and stood to watch. My pastor was standing on a high platform in one corner, and held an enormous fiery sword. Another man stood at the opposite corner, and I know that he was familiar but I couldn't quite see his face. He also held a sword. A bit later, I began to fight this demon with my own fire-sword. At the very end of the dream, I forced the demon nearly to the door of the church, and then struck it down. Then I crushed its skull in with my heel, and it died.   *what I am convinced that it means* I know, first of all, that it is a spiritual dream. It fits with many different scriptures of the Bible.  First, the rebuking of demons. It says in countless places in the Bible (but esp. James 4:11, i think) that if we rebuke Satan or his fallen angels that he will flee, for we are given power over him in Jesus Christ's name.  Second, the fiery swords. In the Bible when it describes the various ways to protect and fight against Satan (pertaining to "armor" against evil) it says that the Word of God represents a sword, and with it we can defeat Satan.  Lastly, and most importantly, the crushing of the demon's head. In Genesis 3, when the Lord curses the serpent for tricking Eve into eating the forbidden fruit, He says to Eve: "...and you will have much pain in childbirth, and I will make your offspring enemies of each other. And the serpent shall strike your child's heel, and they shall crush his head."   Well, can't get much clearer than that. The only thing is, how does it all fit together? How should I interpret the main message of this dream?

      My name is Catherine. I am fourteen years old, and I was born in New Zealand. When i was five, my family moved to North Carolina. Then when I was seven, we moved again, this time to New York.  I am a self-appointed author. I have written two full-length novels and I'm currently working on my third and fourth together. These first three are all part of the same series. I write mainly fantasy. I may post my novels here in the future. I do my writing on my laptop, which is an out-dated model my dad's company bought for him in the mid-1990's.  blech . however, it recently crashed, and though I was able to get it running again, it is on it's last legs. I will replace it very soon with money paid to me for good exam grades. DUDE I'M GETTING A DELL!  I adore horses. They are my life :). I ride once every two weeks at a small privately owned stable. I do not have my own horse, and instead ride a paint gelding named Okie. I ride English, and hope to one day have a career involving horses --- maybe breeding. My favorite breed of horse is Arabian, but for a beginner rider like me, I am more suited to the temperament of a Quarter Horse. One day I may lease one of the latter.

       Before    Before summer birds have flown away and cool clean light forsakes the day  before body’s warmth  is stolen away and pale moon-glow has met its fate  before…  before roses shed their blood-hue red and the trees are disgraced their grandeur fled  before wind has cooled  to frozen breath vivd autumn melts to hueless death  before…  now turn toward Heaven away from the pain and sense, spellbound, the voice of the rain!  now to starlight’s gleam return your eyes to soft cold glint, and the light in their skies   before…  before the oceans burn away the Earth and death and life acquire worth  before pure light  has lost its glow and water scorches yet fire flows  before…  before forests turn  to vibrant embers and all weep as  the Earth remembers  before Heaven cries out and angels can’t fly before the rain  and the rivers die…    Before…   tell me how ya like it!
