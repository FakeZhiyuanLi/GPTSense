      Tonight I headed home on the bus and started to reflect on things, after a pretty good evening with one of my friends. I don't know what it is about the bus or the skytrain, but I always start to think about things when I am on either one of them. The same thing occurs when i go for long walks.   Tonight I pondered how depressed I have been lately and how people who are depressed must feel sad and have a lot of emotional pain. I remember someone saying that people with great sadness or suffering feel compelled to express themselves. For example, many comedians have had a lot of suffering and pain in their past and turn that pain outwards in a expression hummor (ie. comedy). Similarly, in the theatre, there are the two symbolic masks representing joy and sadness. Perhaps to understand joy, one needs to experience sadness. Similarly, to understand sadness one needs to experience joy. One part is not complete without the other and vice-a-versa.  In reflecting on this pain and hummor paradigm, I came across a memory that struck me as rather odd at first. In the movie entitled "Face-Off" with Nickolas Cage and John Travolta, there is a scene where Nick's character has a moment that speaks to this paradigm. Nick plays a drug dealer who's face is stole by a cop played by John Travolta. John's character uses the face to play Nick's character to trick Nick's character's brother to reveal the location of a bomb. Now Nick's character then steals John travolta's character's face and pretends to be John travolta's character. While very confusing and  twisted, it allows for a beautiful scene. In this scene, Nick is playing John travolta's character but he looks like Nick's character and is hanging out with Nick's character's friends. Now you can imagine the pain and suffering that John Travolta's character who looks like Nick's character is feeling. John Travolta's character had a son who was killed by Nick's character in an attempt to kill John Travolta's character.  The scene that I am refering to occurs in the following way. Nick is playing John Travolta's character who looks like Nick's character. During this scene, he is at an apartment and laughing it up with Nick's character's evil friends. He then has this momentary break in playing his enemy's character and almost loses his emotional control in thinking about the loss of his son. He is laughing at one point and then almost crying for an instant. Then he manages to turn that pain around and starts laughing hysterical in joy over his enemy's evil deeds. This moment within the film is so beautiful and spoke to this hummor/pain paradigm. I must give credit to the writers of this movie for understanding this psychological paradigm and to Nick for playing it out so well.

      I thought I would reflect on a short documentary type show I was watching on cable the other night. I believe it was called Frontline or some 'objective' sounding title. It told the story of a kid called Kip. If you want the whole sad story, just search on the internet "Kip Kinkel".    The story told about Kip, a teenager with depressive and violent tendencies who ends up going off the deep end. It had a host of interviews with friends, associates, teachers, and so on who "talked" about Kipp. They said that kip was depressed, fascinated by knifes and gun, viewed pornography, stole things, and listend to marlyn mason. Let me point out a major point here that needs to be said and was not said in the documentary. Just because a teenager has these qualities does not mean he/she will go off the deep end. Anyone of these factors in of themselves, or combination of, is not! an indication of a psychotic killer teenager. It is true that psychotic teens that kill do have these qualities, but just because a teenager has these qualities does not mean he/she will kill. The best predictor of future violent behaviour is past violence behaviour!   This kid had mental issues that almost anyone with a brain could see, yet his family and teachers were ignorrant to them. For example, he was depressed and a loner with poor social skills. In the interviews, most people said how sad it was but no one really intervened. The kid wrote things in essay questions that clearly signaled this kid had mental issues. He wrote about how love was evil and that it can only lead to death and destruction. Similarly, he wrote how he wished the voices in his head would go away. The kid was eventually sent to a psychologist who helped the kid work through some of his issues and was put on Prozac for the depression. However, the kid lied about his feelings to the Psychologist and stop going after he felt a little better. Shortly thereafter, the kid stop taking the medication and his parents went along with this?   Further evidence of the lack of parenting is demonstrated from the following. While the aformentioned issues were going on, so was the on-going battle over guns. Kip loved guns and constantly pestered his father and mother to get a gun. Eventually, the parents broke down and got him one, then another, and another! Friends said the parents gave in arguing the forbidden fruit argument: if you say you can't have it, they will want it even more and find a way to get it. This argument is flawed because the kid could not have got a hold of a lot of the guns he had without the parents help. However, he was able to buy one black-market gun, but was caught with it shortly afterwards. Therefore, the only guns the kid had and used were bought legally by his parents.   What the hell was going through the minds of the parents? You don't give a teenager guns when he has violent tendencies, has depression and loves guns (bar none!). The only reason this kid got the guns was because the parents were ignornant and simply relented to the kid's wishes. In essence, poor parenting leads to problem kids. It's the old saying "If you put only shit in, you will only get shit out." It was amazing how the story painted the parents as inept and therefore not responsible for the actions of their son. In fact, the documentary painted almost everyone in the community as inept and not responsbile for the outcome. This was acomplished by negating everyone's responsibility for the outcome except that of the Kid. What about the responsibility of the parents?, the community?, the police?, and the teachers?  It is true the principal actor in any case of violence is responsible, to varying degrees, for their actions. However, society always seems to point the finger at the criminal and say he's responsible and he desires punishment. In doing so, society acts if criminals grow up and develop in a petrie dishes and were no in way affected by society. Criminals are people and they have faults like the rest of us. By labelling people as criminals, it makes it easy for society to separate themselves from the people that commit crimes. In distancing ourselves from "them", we also are able to distances ourselfs from the crimes and horrible acts they commit. People do not want to believe that they are of the same nature as the people who commit crimes. However, in in truth most able-body people of sound minds are able to kill, rape, and torture others.   After-thought:  If your wondering why I am writting about this story, it's because it really pissed me off for so many reasons, which I outlined above. However, there was this one video clip from one of the classmates talking about how Kip Kinkel killed his parents and then "probably" wanted to kill himself afterwards. She thought he didn't kill himself because "he was like a little kid and he just could not do it". I my mind that is like saying he was a "pussy" and didn't have the balls to blow his brains out. I think that comment speaks to the mind set of some americans.

      Oh, it left like a wife who has been cheated on. It was the kind of day where everything happens in fast foward, nothing valuable has been accomplished, and you just feel used.   We all have these kinds of days i suppose, well unless your filthy rich and never worked a day in your life. For the rest of us, it's up and off to work for another day of mediocrity. However, today I did not have to work and therefore I qued all the celebration that involves. Neverthless, I had to go into the central office to get a new pair of dress pants, since the old ones split (not the first time). You think this was my fauly, but alas no! I can not take the credit, much as I would like too. Yet, the "wonderful" human resources manager "Mia" thought so.   I guess she was feeling whitty today and would make light of the situation. Inquiring as to whether the result occured do to Michael Jackson moves or someother gymnastical feat of unsavory humilation. Caught off guard to her wonderful banter, I simply reply in the negative and thought nothing more of it. You should note, I had to wait 25 minutes for her to finish with some other female guard ( most likely chitty chatting) before she dealt with me. I left the office sortly thereafter, after signing some stupid release form. Of course, it was raining even harder than before and I proceeded to the skytrain to sail back home. While on the way home, I thought what a b.i.t.ch. and if only I had the brain power, at that moment, to verbally cut her down.   What ashame, I thought, after relecting on one or two good zingers. For example, "Gee, with such a sharp tongue, you must have difficulty pleasing your boyfriend". Of course, that would be an improper remark, but damn sweet no less. For my reader, I hope you catch the 'air' of a sexual double entendre. I also thought of another zinger to slay the dragon with. "Geez Mia, you shouldn't agitate things even with a gentle tug as it could explode in your face". Neverthless witty, I would probably be set in my place and jeopardized my job in "going off" on her... lol ok ok no more sexual innuendoes. I will admit she's pleasing on the eyes, as several people have noted.  So in a nutshell, that was the highlight of my day off. Perhaps tommorow will bring new opportunities and wonderful riches...

      I can not stand it when people are stupid and or do very stupid things when they know better. Some people say that money makes the world go around. However, I believe that stupidity is what really makes the economy run. Think about it for a moment and consider this example.   John Dumbass gets into a car accident by being stupid and not paying attention to the road ahead. As a result, he hurts himself and the driver of the car in front of him. Both him and the driver have to go to the hospital and get treated. Also, the vehicles they drive have to be repaired. Now consider all the transactions of goods and money that have to take place to fix John Dumb-ass's stupidity.   Lets consider the transactions involved in getting the vehicles repaired. First, the insurance companies become involved and claims must be filed and money distributed accordingly. Perhaps lawyers, judges, and the courts get involved because of various legal issues. Once settled, only then do the vehicles get repaired. There are the car mechanics who look at the damage and estimate the cost and parts required and then they ulitmately fix the cars. Consider that the parts for the vehicles that must be ordered to fix them. Those parts were manufactured by assembly line persons. Similarly, the material for those parts had to be extracted from the ground and transported by courier to the factory and then to the warehouse. Those parts are then transported from a warehouse to the repair centre and ultimately installed. Now lets consider the transactions involved to fix the people hurt in the accident.  The cost and transactions involved in healing the two drivers injured in the accident probably are greater than those to fix the vehicles. First, the two persons are rushed to the hospital by ambulance by two paramedics. The paramedic's vehicle and medical supplies to move and treat the people had to be made out of materials extracted, molded, formed, and assembled by many workers. Similarly, the gas to run the ambulance had to be extracted, refined, transported, and sold. Think about all the work and money that went into the production of the gasoline. Next, consider the doctors and nurses who work at the hospital and how much they get paid an hour. Now, consider all the medical supplies and equipment used to treat the two injured people. All that equipment had to be produced and transported to the hospital. Finally, consider the costs of the electricity and heating gas used in the hospital for the benefit of the two injured drivers..  Now, consider all the above work and trasactions that went on just because of one accident. Also, consider all the other variables that were not factored in for the sake of the brievity of this entry. One has to wonder what was the sole cause that set all this work and tranactions in motion....   John Dumbass's STUPIDITY!!

      In life it is curious how thousands of moments come and go and we think nothing of them. However, every now and then a moment occurs that is worth infinitely more than all the rest. Within this moment, time is almost frozen and yet restless to disappear into emptiness. It is the kind of emptiness that one cannot see, feel, touch, or begin to fathom. We are then lured into answering questions of where did that moment go and the larger question of where does time go? To begin to answer these questions is to be deceived and is like trying to find the wind. Likewise, we are always trying to find time and some how stop it, but always failing in the endeavor.  This desire to stop time is intensified infinitely when those rare precious moments occur. Each one has a beginning and an end, yet we are so vaguely aware of when it started and so afraid of it ending. Perhaps this is the reason we desire to stop time. Each of these breath-taking moments in time is like a match that is ignited, burns so brightly for a fleeting moment, and then turns to black and ash. With the spark of the match it begins and the world is alive with color and intensity. With each passing second it burns brighter and brighter and we feel alive. In this moment, we are so aware of the flame and its intensity; yet, so afraid that the darkness will come too soon. As the moment passes, so grows the darkness.   In many ways time is like the darkness, as neither has any form or presence. Both of them are the absence of something or the presence of nothing. Perhaps both darkness and time are only illusions that only exist in are minds. Therefore, it is impossible to take physically a hold of them, seize them, or own them. As such, we cannot be their keepers as there is nothing of value in keeping time or darkness. However, darkness has meaning and therefore value, when it takes on a form in the presence of light. Perhaps, the same can be said of time. Only in the moments where there is light does time have meaning.  When one defines light in the physical sense, we define it as electromagnetic radiation that can produce a visual sensation. However, light has several meanings in the English language. Light is otherwise defined as a particular perspective or a mental understanding of an enlightening nature. Only In this sense of the word, does the analogy that time is defined by light take on new meaning. It is in those rare enlightening moments in our lives that we stop for a moment and truly take notice of time. Such moments of enlightenment are akin to the burning match for they are only temporary, yet so beautiful and important as they leave us breathless and awakened. However, just as quickly as the light from the match dims, so fade those rare moments in time. What remains are fleeting memories of something that was and then wasn't. Just like the wind, time comes and goes and no one knowing were it went.

      1. Im an easy going kinda guy; just don't piss me off too much or I will blow up in your face.  2. I just realized that most of my mp3 songs feature either the piano or the guitar, or both of them together.   3. Yes, I download music for free and I don't care because music distributors  (Sony, Warren Bros, etc..) make way! to much money at the artist's expense. Only a few cents from each cd sold goes to pay the artist. The remaining 10-15 dollars goes into the distributor's pocket.  4. I love high-tech gadets that have a purpose and make life easier or more interesting. I.e I don't need my shaving razor to play music or my toilet to sing to me..  5. I don't necessarily believe in a god but it would sure be easy to do so. It would explain some very strange shit that goes on. However, there are never any easy answers to life's complex problems.  6. Lately, I have been living by a minimalist philosophy. I seem to want to throw out stuff that I don't really use. Perhaps it's just that i don't like to have a lot of stuff in my apartment in case i have to move again. However, I think it is more than that, as I derive pleasure from getting rid of crap.  7. I believe that the environment is an important aspect of our lifes and deserves to be treated with respect. As such, the world needs to find alternative power sources that do not pollute. I believe solutions to this problem will involve high-tech gadets not yet thought of, but are very simple in nature.  8. I believe that animals deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect that we treat our fellow human beings with. Anyone caught killing an animal without justification should be punished swiftly and severly.  9. I believe that no one owes anyone anything in this universe to start with.  10. I believe that you should never push your religion on anyone. I also believe that you do not brainwash people into believing your bullshit religion because you think your justified because god told you so.  11. I belive that people who are rude, pretencious, or over-bearing need to have their ass's kicked really f-cking hard. No one has the right to treat another person like sh-t.  12. I believe that swearing is not neccessarily a bad thing. If people swear for the sake of it and not to make a point, then the value of swearing is lost. However, people who say you cannot swear are infringing on your right to freedom of expression and this should not be tolerated. There is a time and a place to swear and sometimes the word f-ck really! gets the point across.  13. I believe that being literate is on of the most basic skills that is critical to succeeding in life. Being able to express one's self clearly and understand what other are saying goes to the heart of what it is to be human.   14. The development of nuclear weapons occured before we as human beings are ready for them. As such, I truely believe that unless humanity has a moral awakening of a grand portion, we are doomed to destroy ourselves.   15. I believe that capitalism is doomed to fail at some point in the future and that it is slowly eroding the moral fabric of our society. Captalism strives to place a value on everything and therefore eventually everything can be bought and sold for a price. As such, anyone can profit (exploit) anything of value for there own personal gain.

      "here we go to the south side, weapons in hand, lets go for a ride!" (Moby, 200?)  I say damn right lets go for a ride. There are days when going for a ride seems like a really good idea. There is something very appealing in having a glock semi-automatic handgun loaded and in your hand ready to blow some rich fuckermother away. Lord I swear, the world is a miserable place because the few and powerful are completely evil and therefore deserve 5oz's of lead in the head. The workers of the world are literally exploited by the weathly through low paying jobs. It is amazing how people are so easily pacified into accepting low paying jobs where they deal with other people's shit on a daily basis. The corporate world abuses it's power and uses the workers to make a profit.   I say enough is enough as it is time to take back what the "corporate" has taken for granted. Let the workers of the world unite in a bloody bath of slaughter, robbing and piledging the wealth from the rich coporate structure. However, such a battle would be lost and many would die. The corporate structure controls the government and the government controls the military. In essence, the military is not there to protect the people from foreign threats but to protect the wealth and power of the rich. In order to succeed in overcomming the force of the military, one has to engage the minds of military personnel in the struggle.   Hence: "the battle is not won with weapons but ideas"  Alas, life is not as easy as the fantasy... never the less, lets go for a ride. Let the revolution of ideas begin....

      Imagine you exist in a place of utter and complete bliss beyond any humanly concieved notions of uptopia. A place that embodies the true essence of heaven; where one exists in a purely transcended state of mind, body, and spirit. A uptopia where every breath, sound, touch, smell, and sight elicits pure physical rapture. Where your every thought is as vast and complex as the universe, yet seemly so simple. Where all of life's questions have been answered and no doubts and fears remain. Where one's spirit is infused with a profound understanding of life and is embolded by a constant embrace of love and joy.
