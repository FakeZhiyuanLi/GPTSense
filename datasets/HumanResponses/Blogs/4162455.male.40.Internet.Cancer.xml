       We will have a 20 player game at my house this Friday night @ 8:00pm.  We may have a new player from Poker Meetup.  Let me know by email  urlLink jia@akaak.com  before Friday how many you will bring so we can make sure we have enough tables. So far we are estimating approx 20 but can break out a 3rd table if we get more.

       We did not have our normal Friday night game due to Charlie but the next day I headed on over to Derby and joined the 170 player tournament.  I finished 4th and here the notes I emailed Jeff W. >>>  "Now to the 4th place finish notes. It all started with my lucky "Quake" jersey. I wore this jersey when I finished in the money in 12th place so I deced to wear the same last Sat. : ) Basically I was at break even chips when they broke up my first table. I played 1 hand (AJ) on the button with a min raise and the big blind called and we checked to the river and I won it with A high. The reason I remember this hand is because that's the only hand I played early other than the forced blinds : ) Basically I threw all of the dominated hands Ax and medium hands like KTs or QTs and even KQ and KJ even in late position. I remembered I folded AQ in early position because I felt there was a raise to come and sure enough a guy went all in with JJ and won that. Anyways.the way I won was basically only playing level 1 hands and playing them with an all-in raise. In the 6 hours that I played, I got 2 pocket Aces, 2 pocket Kings, 3 or 4 Big Slicks, and that's about it... I won all the show downs with the 5 or 6 all ins that I initiated so I did get great cards that day which helped. I also got a great straight draw on the river late in the tournament with an A2s vs AQ to keep me alive. My 2 mistakes of the tournament were : 1) limping in on the button with QTs and getting an All-in raise by the most aggressive guy in the tournament to my left which I promptly folded 1/3 of my chips - stupid move - from now on I will not play a hand that I am not ready to go all in with. 2) the last play of the tournament in which I was on the big blind with a Q2 with 9500 chips left after the big blind of 4000. No raise from the little blind (2nd most aggressive of the final 4 but a very skillfull player which I learned after this trap). This guy would go all-in at any sign of weakness just like the guy to my left. After the flop of Qxx I check with my weak kicker to the river which produced a 2 for my 2 pair. Now I looked at the board and saw a possible strait for him if he had the J... He made a great bet of 4000 and said "i bet the minimum" and trapped me. I didn't think he had the J so I went all in and knew I was in trouble when he immediately called me as I was reaching for my chips. If I folded then I believe I would have made it to 3rd or more as the blind would put the other player all in. All in all it was a great tournament and I learned alot and will try to repeat soon. I think the key is to wait for the level 1 cards to play and play them strong and hopefully they will hold up. The best hand of the tournament for me was getting AA on the big blind and having a mid position player go all in with KK ! I won that matchup as well as AK vs AJ which got me enough chips to make it to the money. I'm estimating that 3000-5000 chips should be enough for you to sit on to make it to the money."

       Some of our league members are playing the biggest NL Hold'em in Tampa Bay today - the 12:00pm 200 player No Limit Hold'em tournament at Derby Lanes in St. Pete. ( urlLink http://www.derbylane.com  727-812-3339.  Everyweek this tournament sells out at the open because they allow you to pre-register Friday starting at noon.  Most players purchase their seat the day before.  If you show up Saturday without a seat ticket, make sure you be at the Plaza door at 11:00am and get in line before they open the door at 11:30am.  As soon as you get in, run straight to the escalator, not the elevator on the right (much slower), and take a right and then a left to the next escalator.  Then go thru the glass doors and go to the left and get in line in front of the counter in front of the poker room.  Since 3 weeks ago, this tournament has sold out every Saturday.  The 1st place prize is $2,000.  I know a player who finished 4th a few weeks ago and it paid $650.  I finished 12th once and it paid $137.

       We had a good game Friday night at Dale's. A total of 19 players showed up. Gene, a new player, won the top prize of $100. Bad beat #1 : Jeff C.'s pocket queens vs. John's pocket aces - All In Action - Jeff gets a queen on the flop to take out John. Bad beat #2 : Casey had AK and the flop gave him trip kings... Casey then goes all in and was called by Bobbie who had a pocket pair... Bobbie hits trips and takes Casey out with a full house.
