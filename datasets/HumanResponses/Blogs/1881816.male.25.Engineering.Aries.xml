       I keep hearing politicians talking about taxes and tax cuts to the different income brackets.  The one thing I never hear is what defines someone as upper, middle and lower income brackets.  As a matter of opinion I was curious because this could sway my vote for the next president.  I wanted to know who was looking out for me and my money.  So, I did some research on the numbers.....  The published number by the  urlLink US Census Bureau  for the median household income for 2002 (the most recent published year) was $42,409.  The mean (average) income for 2002 was $57,852.  We have to look at both of these numbers to see what this really means.  Let's start with a couple definitions from the  urlLink Census Bureau .   Mean (Average) income.  Mean (average) income is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group. The means for households, families, and unrelated individuals are based on all households, families, and unrelated individuals, respectively. The means (averages) for people are based on people 15 years old and over with income.   Median income.  Median income is the amount which divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having incomes above the median, half having incomes below the median. The medians for households, families, and unrelated individuals are based on all households, families, and unrelated individuals, respectively. The medians for people are based on people 15 years old and over with income.  The mean (average) income can be misleading.  We take all the income for everyone in the US and divide it by the total number of people.  This includes the incomes of people like Bill Gate, Donald Trump and others that skew the mean income.  The number to really look at is the median income.  That is what the guy smack dab in the middle would make.  So, your average joe 6 pack would make about $42,000 US dollars per year.  If you are interested in looking at the numbers yourself you can check them out yourself at the US Census Bureau  urlLink here .  Lets look at the tax brackets.  There are several brackets depending on what you earn.  I could not find them for 2002 but the 2003 brackets (coutrsey of  urlLink Fairmark Press ) are....  $0 to $7,000 is 10% $7,000 to 28,400 is 15% $28,400 to 68,800 is 25% $68,800 to 143,500 is 28% $143,500 to 311,950 is 33% $311,950 and up is 35%  Now this is where opinion comes into play on the upper, middle and lower income brackets.  They say lower but what bracket do they mean?  There are more than 3 of them.  The mean and median incomes both fall in the 25% tax bracket.  So, I would assume this to be "middle class" and at least the middle tax bracket.  So, would that make the 10% and 15% brackets to be the lower income bracket.  That is $28,400 per year and under.  So, when they talk about the lower tax bracket I would assume this is what they mean.  I would also take from this that the "upper middle class" is the 28% bracket and the 33% and 35% bracket are the "upper class" or upper bracket.  Now I know where I fit and how these tax incentives, cuts, and hikes apply to me.  Hope you do too.

       I am stuck home sick today.  I don't feel so hot.  Now, I am bored and wondering what to do.    The few things running though my head are watch tv or read a book.  Anyone out there have any better ideas?

       I would have to say that Detroit is one of the best sports towns out there.  We have all the major US sports.  The Red Wings (hockey), Lions (football), Pistons (NBA basketball), Tigers (baseball), Shock (WNBA) basketball, Michigan State University and University of Micigan.  Between these teams the only one to not be constantly sold out is the Tigers.  To get tickets to just about any other game is difficult and can cost you and arm and a leg.  Lets talk sucess in the past 10 years. - The Red Wings have 3 Stanley Cups and 2 Presidents Trophies. - Pistons have set several NBA records this season and one again have made it to the conference finals. - Shock are the WNBA Champions.  They have the coach of the year to boot. - MSU mens basketball was and NCAA Champion and has won many conference chamionships. - U of M was a football NCAA Champion and is amazing at many of it's sports.  Detroit is known for being overweight these days being the reigning nations champion there.  It is cold half the year and I mean cold.  So, we spend hours and hours watching sports and checking espn.com for the up to date scores and stats.  If only the boss new.  As far as the fans go the Lions fans are the perfect example of that.  They have been below .500 every year for the past several years.  Yet, every game is sold out.  And the fans are out there with faces painted rooting the team on to the bitter end.  Every year after the draft and trades there is hope for the Lions in the eyes of the city.  But, this year it isn't just hope; it's reality ;-)  Detroit is really a sports town.  One of the best sports towns.  We have all the drama of a soap (just looka the cujo and hasek goalie delima that drove us nuts for the year), the glory of a championship (the wings for example), and the hope behind a rebuilding (Lions and Tigers).  We have all the parts for all the kinds of fans.  Go Pistons!!!!!!!!!!!  Crush those Pacers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       I grew up going to church.  It was soooo boring.  The way church was for me growing up was my parents style.  The music was lame, the limited use of technology, the message coming across.  Times are changing though.  Many in the church are waking up and seeing that times have changed.  In part because there has been such a big drop off in attendance from those in the 20's and under.  Churches are staring to make major changes in the way they do things.  One of the new things to the net is church on the net.  It is a virtual church.  They have preachers, references, you can interact with other church goers and more.  This church is over in England where there is a lot happening in post modern ministry.  The site is run by  urlLink Ship of Fools .  You can link to it right from their homepage.  There have been problems with the online church.  It seems that there have been a lot of americans that have been causing trouble in there.  Some of the features had to be restricted because of it.  It's a really cool place to go and 6pm EST Sunday night there are online services.  Now, if I want to go to church it's just a mouse click away.

       I recieved a forward yesterday.  It was a little older and many people may have seen it before but it really talked about some things we Americans along with many others take for granted.  It's really something to read and think about....   An open letter to America from one  European Americans kept Europeans free  to disagree   From: James Black, Wychwood Park,  Cheshire, England    Dear America,   You quirky mix of 280 million misfits that  have somehow blended into the strongest nation in the world, I write to  offer you four apologies and two vows.  1) I, James Black, a European passport holder  whose parents are Scottish,whose wife is English, and whose four children  are free to be whatever they may want to be (directly because of the  sacrifice of your nation), am ashamed for pointing out to a colleague  while visiting your country a few days ago that Winston Churchill was  wrong when he said the biggest difference between Britain and the United  States was the fact we both spoke the same language -- and instead,  telling him that the real difference between our peoples was actually  about 100 pounds per person.  2) I, who work as a journalist with the Daily  Mail, one of Britain's national newspapers, and (directly because of the  sacrifice of your nation) is able to say exactly what he wants whenever he  wants without fear of death or imprisonment, would also like to apologise  for saying to the same colleague that many of the Americans I met were far  less sophisticated and worldly than Europeans.  3) I, James Black, a man born free of social  or physical shackles and chains, who is able to travel around the world  and visit other countries and who (directly because of the sacrifice of  your nation) is able to converse, discuss, even argue with people from  other nations, would like to apologise for mocking your president and your  political system.  Your president may not be the sharpest knife  in the cutlery set, but I now understand he and the good people of the  United States operate not just from a high intellectual stance, but also  from the heart -- a heart that knows the difference between good and evil.  And importantly, your president was smart enough to have picked the best  to sit with him at the world table.  4) I, whose friends, family and colleagues are  allowed to set up home, take a job, even run for politician, in any part  of the European Union (directly because of the sacrifice of your nation)  without being rounded up because of their religion or shot on the spot for  their place of birth would finally like to apologise for the biggest  mistake the people of my continent have ever made -- their total lack of  respect for the greatest friend they will ever have -- the United States  of America.  My anger at some of my fellow Europeans is  more than palpable. I hear the self-centered, cowardly, and just plain  annoying words thrown out by old-minded -- old world -- so-called leaders  of the Free World.  I may have made fun of America and Americans,  but deep down I know this is only friendly banter between the greatest of  friends -- and friends who should give their all to each other when called  upon to do so. So I, whose grandfather fought in both World Wars and had  the good humour to suggest the Americans were late for both events, but  the sense to point out they ensured victory when they finally did show up,  make my first vow:  1) I will never forget or dishonour the  amazing and courageous sacrifice of the people of the United States in  coming to the aid of the world over the past ten decades. The men and  women who left peace and prosperity in a land of plenty to face bullet and  shrapnel on the beaches of Normandy and around the World.  2) I will honour the debt my small island  nation owes for your unswerving devotion to aiding our continued freedom.  Your help when we stood small and alone against the plague of Nazi  aggression. Your assistance in making us strong when the battle was  finished and the peace began, and your protection from a colder enemy in  the decades that followed. I have stood, and I will stand again, with my  own family, in places such as the cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer, an  eternal resting place for over 10,000 teen and twenty-something Americans  who gave over ALL their future so that I and my children could have a  future today, and I will again pledge my eternal gratitude.  3) I, James Black, a man who simply wants his  children to live in a future where all good and constructive things are  possible, a future where we can discover, invent, enjoy, without fear of  fanatics or madmen or the weapons and pain they may wreak, pledge my  assistance to the United States in its fight against evil. This pledge is  not some brainwashed verse, but based on the honourable history and proven  friendship the United States has with Europe. Further, it is based on the  fact that the people and leaders of the United States have the foresight  to see the world, even life itself, is futile without someone to love,  things to build and create, and things to look forward to -- and none of  these things are possible in a world awash with nuclear, chemical and  biological arms controlled by those who despise the life we  lead.  I am one person, but there are millions like  me who thank the USA and wish your nation and your people all the best  over the next few months -- and will be there by your side when the times  get tough.  Yours with all my gratitude,  James Black, Wychwood Park, Cheshire,  England  P.S.: It is said that today is the tomorrow we  worried about yesterday. You should be proud as a nation that you have  something to do with the fact it didn't turn out so badly after all -- nor  should it again.

       While I was traveling last week I was talking to a buddy of mine and his girlfriend asked one of those questions one should never ask.  They shouldn't ask because they won't like the answer one bit.  So, we came up with a few rules that women should know, never ask about and just accept.    1) Men will masturbate even when they are getting laid (possibly more often)  2) They will imagine themselves with her friends while doing #1  3) Men will look at other women.  It has nothing to do is his girl or if the other woman is better looking.  It will just happen.  None of these mean a man will cheat or is even more inclined.  Every straight man does this.  Even if they don't admit it.  I'm sure there will be more to come.  Most likely after a long night at the bar.  On a side note... Congrats to the Pistons for tearing LA a new one.  I never thought Phil Jackson deserved to be the winingest pro coach of all time.  And the Pistons Rock!!!!!

       Prognostics is actually a pretty simple concept in principal.  It's the implementation that becomes the hard part.  When a failure happens to something like a transmission there are signs first.  If, say, a gear were going to break then before the break there would be a change in, say, vibration.  This could start happening hours or even days before the break.  The vibration would be a sympton of a tiny crack in the gear that would slowly expand until the break.  The idea is to detect these "small" or "incipient" faults, in this case the crack, and know what this means to the gear.  Here is a little chart to show when this happens...      Prognostics              Diagnostics  "small" or "incipient" fault&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure     |____________________|_________  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time   If you know that the vibration means a break is going to occur then you have detected the transmission failure before it fails.  The next part is knowing how long until it fails.  Knowing enough about the transmission and how the vibration is that is being caused my the crack the time can be plotted until the break.  The hard part is putting all of this together on something.  Knowing where to mount the sensors and what the different signals mean to a level of detail to predict when the failure will happen consistantly and accurately.  But, it has been done, some universities teach about it, the DoD has invested in it and it is being done all over the world.

       Imagine you are driving down the road, your transmission breaks and you are stuck dead in the road.  You're frustrated, plans are all messed up and have to get a tow truck to take it to a repair shop.  Not fun and a definite pain.  Now, Imagine that a few hours before your transmission broke you got a warning saying that it was going to break in a few hours.  You would then drive it to a repair shop and make other arrangements for your day.  You wouldn't have to get a tow truck or be stuck dead by the road.  The idea is not to diagnose the problem after it happens but to predict the failure before it happens.  Technology like this is being developed and it's called Prognostics.  A simple useful definition would be:  Prognostics - Actual material condition assessment which includes predicting and determining the useful life and performance life remaining of components by modeling fault progression (courtesy of the Joint Strike Fighter Program)  Now that diagnostics has become so advanced and processing power is up so that large math equations take no time to solve on embedded applications; prognostics technology is taking off.  The idea is to monitor the physical condition of a system.  Then when changes occur you know how those changes affect the remaining life of a component.  For this you can (not easily but possibly very accurately) predict how much life there is left in the component.  A simple example of this is on some newer cars.  On some cars there is an indicator to tell how much useful life there is in your oil.  This is many times displayed as a percentage.  The idea is that instead of changing it every 3000 miles you do it based on the condition of the oil.  What if your oil was still good after 3000 miles?  Then changing it would be a waste of time, oil and money for the user.  Someone who speeds a lot vs someone who is a conservative driver will have different oil conditions for the same amout of miles.  If your oil is still good after 3000 miles why change?  Why not wait until the oil is no longer in good condition.  Prognostics is a new technology frontier where many different technologies work together.   More to come....lots more.

       On Friday night I introduced my buddy to this girl.  They hit it off really well.  We stayed at the bar for over 4 hours and they even made date plans for the following Monday.  At the end of the night he walked her to the car and even got a good night kiss.  The next day it went all wrong.....  In the middle of the day on Saturday she called him to say she had a great time.  While he was talking to her he got another call.  He quickly talked to the other person and came back.  But, he told this new girl that the woman he had just talked to was an ex-booty call that was just sex and now they are friends but nothing else. (Way to much info the day after you meet a girl)  My girl put the move this way.  It turned him looking like a steak dinner with the works on a nice plate to looking like a steak that had been thrown on a trash can lid.  Looks good if your still hungry.  Then, she had plans with one of her girl friends for the day on Saturday.  He tried talking her into canceling on her girlfriend and moving up seeing her to that day.  Asking a girl she just met to cancel on one of her girls is a no-no.  And finially, He called her like 4 times the day after he met her.  That is over doing it.  He got overzelous and scared her off.  3 Strikes and Your Out.  In a matter of a few hours he managed to go from being golden with her to her not wanting to talk to him again.  I even tried to tell him what not to do.  Everything I told him not to do he did.  Ah well, another one bites the dust

       I am sitting here with a bit of a hangover this morning wonding how can I nip this thing so I can have the energy for another night of madness.  It's been awhile since I had one but, that's how it can go when your at the bar and all the friends are egging each other on.  So, here are some good links I found about how to get rid of the hangover....   urlLink So You Wanna Cure A Hangover?  - All around information  urlLink Hangover.net  - Need I say more  urlLink From The UK   Also, those pills as seen on TV don't really work.  If you read the label they say to drink a glass of water after every 2 beers or so.  If you drink the water you are stopping the dehydration effect.

       After reading yesterday about how Microsoft just recieved a patent for double clicking your mouse I got a little pissed.  How can something that has been out for so long with all the prior art get a patent approved?  I also know that the US Patent Office has been approving patents with prior art for some time especially in the area of software.  It seems that there needs to be some big reform there.  They either have out dated policies, are under staffed, are inappropriately staffed or some combination of all of these.  These patents on software with prior art seem to mostly (at least from what I have seen) been by big corperations who have the money and power to use it to squash the little guy.  Microsoft even has gone so far as to say they will use this patent portfolio to make money.  So, they patent things with prior art then go after other companies (easily the small ones) and make money on it.  That is CRAP!!!!!  I even just went back to the article I read about Microsoft and the double click patent and the story has been removed for some reason.  A day after I read it.  I believe we need to contact our congress people (have to stay PC) and senators and let them know we need the reform.  Public outcry can get reactions.  There is a petition online that deals with software patents.  I don't know if I agree with the course of the petition.  It may be asking too much but it's a place to start.  It's the  urlLink Petition Against Software Patents .  I encourage everyone to sign it.  We need reform.  Patents weren't designed to be tied up in the legal system.  They were designed to protect those who created.  Not for lawyers to make a lot of money getting in place and fighting.  Or to have the big guy squash the little guy.

       Jenn who is the first comment to my blog from yesterday said..   I feel that anyone who needs to meet girls or court girls according to a list of rules has no game to start with and shouldn't even be dating for the sheer fact that they must have social issues.   She and I also exchanged many other emails yesterday about this.  She doesn't think someone should follow a list of rules.  But....  If a guy calls too much she wouldn't give him the time (reason for 2 day rule)  If a guy isn't confident with her he doesn't stand a chance  If a guy has bad hygiene then she wouldn't give him the time of day  She is in to fashion a bit and if a guy notices something like cute shoes it's big points  She says that if guys follow these rules it's bad.  But she expects guys to do all these things anyway.  So, if you just do them or if you follow the rules but don't say then it's the same result.  What she likes.  I think the biggest plus for the rules is well....they worked on Jenn.  You do those things and follow any "rules" to force yourself to not call to often and notice the little psychological things that give that little extra edge when you first start dating.  If they didn't work they wouldn't have lasted as long as they have and have such a following.  I have followed them and they work.  As far as the anonymous comment from yesterday.  Well, the idea isn't to let her trample you but to get in her head.  Jenn is now blogging.  Check her out at  urlLink jenniferparadise.blogspot.com   Oh, and that is her real God given name.  Lucky girl.

       Over the last 7 years I have worked either for an internet service provider or now as an engineer.  One thing I have noticed is how many of the guys (self proclaimed nerds) I have worked with can't seem to get many women.  I come from a slightly different background than most engineers/IT guys.  I was in a fraternity (don't hold that against me), sports, wild social scene and have never had to many problems with women.  There are many reasons that guys have trouble with women but with a few changes it is pretty easy to get on the right road.  And no, the changes have nothing to do with personality.  1) The first thing when you meet a woman is how you look.  Most women notice clothes.  There are many different styles of fashion, so for clothes, as long as they go together should pretty much be fine (For years I always consulted either my sister or a neighbor girl on my outfits.  I have no fashion sense of my own.)  Also, make sure you dress well.  Those faded, now stone washed, jeans that are ten years old with a t-shirt or polo shirt you would wear to work won't usually cut the mustard.  2) Hygiene.  Make sure you brush your teeth, shower, smell good (not like you have been gaming for 2 days and havn't moved from your seat).  This will make for a much better first impression.  Women notice how men smell.  If you smell good women will associate you with a good smell and they will remember that.  3) Confidence.  This is one of the hardest things.  Women always seem like they may want the bad guy.  This isn't true.  The bad guy has confidence and that is what they really like.  It is something that should never be forgotten.  Confidence.  4) When your talking with a woman keep much of the topic on her.  That will make her feel important and when you repeat things back you show that you were paying attention.  Being good at conversation is a very important thing.  It's one of those topics every woman either brags about to her friends or complains about to her friends.  Now, for a few date tips:  1) Do for her.  By this I mean to open the door for her (including the car door), help her with her coat and be sure that when you sit down that she sits first.  Also, when walking on stairs you are on the bottom side and when walking down the street you are on the street side.  2) If your at dinner then you take the seat facing the wall.  This will curb you from looking around and keep your attention on the lady of the evening.  3) If you give her compliments then keep them to a few and tell her things like you like her outfit or point out something nice about her shoes.  4) Talk to her.  Good conversation is what will keep her around.  Ever wonder why there is the term 'Personality Guy' and not 'Personality Girl'.  It's because looks aren't as important to women and they key in on personality.  A couple notes:  1) The 2 Day Rule.  There used to be the 3 day rule when calling a woman but now it's 2 days.  After a date, wait 2 days to call.  After you get a number wait 2 days to call.  Then you call every 2 days unless it gets serious or there is some other special reason.  Plan every 2 days to call though.  2) If you meet her at a bar don't stay by her side all night.  Talk to her for a little bit then go back to her friends.  This way you don't overwhelm her and leave her wanting more.  Just remember to say goodbye before you leave.  3) Confidence.  Once again be confident.  It is so important I am saying again.  Even if your not normally confident be confident with her.  Fake it if you have to.  I have a friend who is 25, overweight and heavily balding.  He always knows how to dress (and it's not GQ) and what to say.  He can walk into a bar and within 10 minutes have women bringing their friends over to talk to him.  There is nothing special about him.  He just puts in that little extra effort.  Beyond these basic steps there are a million other things you can do that fit each person different and things to look for with women.  I would suggest picking up a mens magazine (and playboy or penthouse don't count).  My recommendation is  urlLink Mens Health .  It seems to give the best all around advice.

       I found this interesting.  A forward I got the other day.  The reson is that so many Democrats want Bush to apologize for going to Iraq and going after Waepons of Mass Destruction.  What about all those in congress who told him to go there?  What about those that before we went told him to go there?  Should they also get up and do the same as they expect from GW Bush?  Heck, yeah.    Just because Bush was the one with the authority and power to make it happen doesn't mean he is the only one that would have gone in there for the same reasons given the same choice he was given.  Should those who backed and pushed him to go get up there and say the same things they expect Bush to say?  Heck, yeah.    For someone to first support and push Bush to go in there and then condem him for his actions is just wrong.  You can admit you were wrong and that we shouldn't have done that but to put all the blame on the person that had the power and followed through with the deed you wanted and then tearing them a new one for it later is in bad character and taste.    "Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing." --Abraham Lincoln    "[WE] urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI), Tom Daschle (D-SD), John Kerry( D - MA), and others Oct. 9,1998     "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002    "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9,2002     "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members.. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002       "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime .... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction .... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real" - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003

       So, my last few days have been really interesting. I found out my now exgirlfriend was a liar and a cheater. Here's my story and it's a good. I got the last laugh.    Elizabeth Cernava of Michigan, USA (just to warn any future guys who may come accross this) and I went out for 9 months. It was great until the last 2 months. The first of these to months she told me she had to work a lot and was acting really stressed. The second month we went down hill until we broke up a week and a half ago. Then she tried to win me back until I found out the truth about her. Here it is....    When I started dating her she had a guy. I am pretty sure she was exclusive with both of us for some time. Then she ended it with the other guy. Over the next few months, which seemed to be the best time period of the relationship with her and I, she was actually cheating on me with flings here and there (I actually found out names and dates of stuff happening). Then, 2 months ago she met a new guy. Then a month ago she moved in with him.    After we broke up I noticed something was weird when she was trying to get back with me. She was trying pretty hard to. Pulling out all the stops. So, I did the dirt digging and found out all that stuff about her. Including who the new guy was, where he lived and his phone number. He lives 3 miles from my parents. We went through the same school system.    So, after I changed the locks and turned of the cell she was using (yes, my dumb ass let her have a cell) I called him up. I laid it all out. Told him everything. And, told him how to confirm it himself.    Last night, I got some interesting calls concluding with one from her. He kicked her out last night. Go other guy. My last laugh. She is furious with me. I had to give him the warning I never had. He deserved that. Before she trapped him or took his money.    The skinny on Liz is that she has done this many times before with many guys. She owes many people money that adds up to tens of thousands of dollars. She lives a lie and tailors it to each guy to get him. She is great at "spinning tails" as one of my informants told me. She targets guys with money. Uses them for their money to buy her things and then bolts after a few months. There are many guys in her path.     She told the other guy and I things like she had a masters degree when she doesn't even have a bachelors degree. That she had just sold a place and was building a new place when no one will even lend her the money to buy anything. All lies. Lies upon lies.    I ended up getting the last laugh. She has no phone and got kicked out of the place where she lived (and lost her sugar daddy). She had to crawl back to her mom. Her lies were revealed to all.    So, guys if you meet her don't fall for it. She has been around a lot and cheated a lot. The list of men she has slept with is huge. She cheats and lies all the time. Heed this warning. She may seem like a smooth talker. She may be hot and can say the right thing. She is a dirty whore and an incredible liar.

       So, are music sales bouncing back?  Well, at least some areas are.   urlLink Check it out .  So, where should I complain that it's country that rising and not pop.  Toby Keith or Britney Spears.  Go Toby.  At least you have something to say.  Although Britney is so much better to look at.  I also realized that this is a sign that the economy is really getting back on track.  People have more disposable income to buy more.  So, I decided to track down some numbers on the economy.  Here they are:  "At least 2.4 million jobs have been created since the president took office, 2 million of those in 2003. The gains more than offset the losses."  "The 5.6 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in two years and below the average of the 1980s (7.3 percent) and '90s (5.8 percent)..."  And there is a lot more.  Guess we are not that bad off economically.  Hey, I got a raise this year.  Wooohooo.  Some articles with info:   urlLink This one has conservative undertones but has lots of straight up facts    urlLink For some numbers, not just for the U.S. and it looks good    More people have jobs and where I work is constantly hiring for now.  So, we're not so bad off and things are getting better.

       If John Kerry becomes the US President there will be many jobs lost.  Some people might say this is madness and I am crazy for such a thing.  Well, here is what I know.  The economy isn't tied to a paticular president or political party.  We give too much credit of the economic state to president.  Some does need to go to him but most doesn't.  Every 10 years (approximately) there is a recession or depression.  The last one was during Bush Srs time about 10 years before his son, before that it was Carter who had one and it was about 10 years before that.  On this track you can go back every 10 years and the Great Depression even falls in this trend. This means that Kerry in office does not mean more new jobs than Bush being in office.  Next there comes the military contractor sector.  There are many new military programs going on right now.  Currently the military is greater than 2/3 logistics.  This is a large footprint to maintain.  These new military programs are aimed at brining technology up, decreasing the size of the force needed and shrinking the logistics footprint by a large amount.  These programs will save a lot of long term money for the US Military.  But, Kerry is a democrat.  And put simply that in almost all cases means a shrink in short term military spending.  That means that many of these programs will be canceled and tens of thousands of people laid off.  So, Kerry in office does not mean more jobs.  It probubaly means I would get laid off.
