       Weeeeee. Throat dying in pits of flaming death.  Maths coursework, the single most irritating endevour on the planet is over. SCREAM WITH JOY OH MASSES!  Anyone who has not had to suffer the pain of Statistics Coursework will be unaware of the shear boredom, endless writing and calculations that the coursework causes. I managed to fill 14 solid pages of writing in three hours (we have to copy it all out under exam conditions) Plus a load of painstakingly drawn graphs. My life is now complete.   Worms World Party  Incidentally, I nicked the CD of this brilliant game of a friend yesterday. It is pretty much Worms 2 but with some extras. I had forgotten how much fun those games are. Go play it. Dig out your copy of worms, worms2, worms armaggedon or WWP. Sooooo much fun!

       AAAAARGH, Another IT lesson.  I personally believe that the person who thought up school orchestra rehearsals should be shot. Multiple times. In the foot. After this treatment he/she should be strangled with a cello string. Life is too short for three hour long orchestra rehearsals. I have no time!  Plus, I seem to be afflicted with the same virus that has attacked Seb. It's not very nice to say the least. Fucking illness

       Minor update, have managed to extract the urls of my friend's blogs off them. Go check out: 1. The Half-Life mod I'm mapping for 2. That's Seb's blog. Previously aptly known as "The Juggernaut" 3. That's Wannabe neurotic teenager Rob's blog. He is the head of the Omega Project. 4. The Flatfish Interlegs Service. A very Unusual ISP founded by Me, Seb and Rob. Dom Out.

       Errm, hello people. I set this blog up because of peer pressure *sob*, now i've got to think of things to write :).  At present I am in a school IT lesson. - There's no one for me to talk to as most of my freinds are either in different classes or lying half-dead on a sofa, dribbeling onto the fabric. meh - at least I'm, not. Yet. Unfortunatly (for me) I had finished all the stupid little ECDL tests last term. This achievement was awarded with... ermm... I can't describe it. Perhaps it is written AAARRRRRRRR, and spoken loudly and raspingly. You probably don't get the picture. Oh well.  In fact, daring to do somthing as terrifyingly techie as use the internet is likely to get myself shot in my currant surroundings.  Ah, as I thought, somone's noticed - bye.

       Ah, return - Sorry, sorry sorry for the continued lack of anything on this website, I got attacked with coursework. Oh yeah, then I forgot.  Anyhoo, i'm on holiday now - what fun - and its time to revise. Thats what comes of having mocks on the first day of school next term.  One rather nice thing I must relate is my experience with the Dell customer support pages:  Downloads: Drivers: Inspiron 8200: Ati Mobility 9000: Last updated... (wait for it... wait for it...) January. Last year. OOOH!!!!! Wunderfulllll - Moomy, can I have a dell for christmas???!? Regardless, the drivers I had were crap. They supported stuff but crashed straight away. The drivers before them could only support pong.  So I sent an email to the technical support people. "Our commitment is to reply within 4 hours". Yeah, my arse. It is now 2 months since I sent 2 emails (one week between the two) 4 hours my large, sweating buttocks.  Anyway, it turned out that they were still updateing the drivers for my card, (M9), but only for the Inspiron 8500/8600. When I got them off a freind who has an 8500, it said "INF driver file not found" - in english, this means "FUCK OFF, WE DON'T WANT YOU TO UPGRADE YOUR DRIVERS. HAHAHAHA". What to do? Ah, yes. Force the drivers down the proverbial throat of Windows.   I wont go into the gorey details, but 10 scalpal blades & a lot of blood later I removed my hand from the wound and found my new "incompatible" drivers work absolutly perfectly. Great!

       Apologies for the previous lack of postage. I have been working/playingWWP/dying.  Most of my affliction has left. But in a final effort to ruin my life it left a horrible throat behind. Not mine, someone else's. WHAT DID IT DO WITH MY THROAT????????   HELP ME.  Too much cousework. Too, too much.  I am sure that I will end up dying at 18 after having kamakaze bombed my school. The whole thing. That would be impressive ( its big ) (one nuke should do it - I won't get a second chanse after all )

       Incedible, truly, it is amazing. The only thing that stimulates me to come and actually update this thing is illness. (see below) now i'm ill again, at home again, dying again. Work is still fun, getting a little interesting, i.e. music coursework. I am totally incapable of composing; really. My GCSE mocks went well, I won't say how well, apart from french. my worst, a shittie C. I'm so depressed, but then who the hell would actually want to go to france anyway - not me, I cannot stand the language (although some parts of France are ok). Regardless of this my favorite city is Prague, for several reasons. Oh God, i'm rambling! save me!

       It is very interesting my my opinion that the existence of this webblog disappears from my mind soon after I post. It only returns under certain circumstances (as stated below) including double music lessons. Because I am incapable of actually composing anything they are a source of extreme boredom.   Maths coursework is over at least, thats somthing...

       I'm not ill!!??! WHAT IS THIS? I'm posing and I'm not ill.  Revision is the currant bain of my life, there's always one isn't there... 3 hours a day may not sound like much, and to be honest it isn't really, it just seams like it when you really can't be fucked. (apologies to those with weak temprements - the swearing was totally nessesary however)  Go check out the Omega Project site. Nothing's changed - at all. :(. So in fact, don't bother checking the Omega project site: On that note, I really ought to finish and release a map at some point, Most of my creations in VHE are crap, however I am capable of producing some nice stuff when pressed, however - I never finish  anything . Never mind.    When My GSCEs are Over I may post again, maybe even befre they start, who knows? the world is truly, at its core, unpredictable.

       Well, I'm in greece now, which is unusual. I'm not noramally in Greece, so it's unusual for me. &nbsp; Blogger appears to have gone insane in my absence, adding multiple pointless formatting options.

       I'm still not actually in Greece, I'm now at my grandparent's house, making the most of his  slightly  faster connection (I know, not fair is it).  I had no idea until today that anyone other than my close friends even knew about this rather pointless webpage, but there you are... It seems I was wrong. Go see  urlLink Eirene - R.a.v.i's blog . He's somewhat more philosophical in his blogging than I, spending time with less inane ranting and more pondering of the darkest secrets of the universe. Or, at least, something like that.   Since I now realize that someone is reading this, I'll have to make a special effort, which becomes difficult given the expected 2 weeks of isolation from civilization (it's not that bad, really).  My new phone came today. I can now say that I have tried most of the major phone producing companies, and Sony Ericsson looks to be ahead of the game, simply because that is the latest one to grace my pocket. It's a T... erm... 610. A T610, whatever that means. A reasonably priced, and yet featureful phone with  Bluetooth . Bluetooth is required because it will mean I can finally use some of the more useful features of my palmtop. Yay, yet another piece of electronics I have to carry around, but this should mean I can blog from wherever I am!  In fact, the necessity for one to carry around multiple pieces of complex electronics is one of the most irritating things I have come across. Apart from small screaming children and Dolly Partridge, of course. The fact that my palmtop is totally useless as a communications device without a suitably enabled phone, and my laptop totally useless without a suitably enabled human is a source of extreme irritation. Ah well, should have got one of those O2 PDAs then, you know, the ones that act as phones as well. Note to self - "Get bigger pockets".  I haven't done any proper programming for a few weeks, this is getting worrying, and always happens. I find some rather pointless and yet interesting project to work on, and work feverishly at that, but choose to do so at a particularly important time in my schooling. Holidays, the perfect time to pursue such interests just don't seem to come into it. I mean at some point to test the theory of my IT head, that the best code is written at about 1am.  Go learn  C++ , you know you want to. At some point expect a large ramble about why I think it is the best language under the  Golden Orb , also including, for one time only, a massive go at VB!   And, whatever you do, don't waste time downloading Opera, go for  urlLink Firefox  instead. See below for reasons why!  -- Dom Out

       Hello again, I'm bored. You may have guessed. If you didn't already know that by the time you read the first line, then you're stupid - go away.  The main point of this post isn't to banish idiots from my already underviewed weblog, no, it is to sing the praises of  urlLink gMail . gMail is a scary thing indeed, if you think so, go and read  urlLink this . Whilst much of it is true, I haven't come across the dodjy advertising yet, but then, I don't talk about that sort of stuff. To be honest, not many of my emails are interesting enough to be of any interest to anyone except me, if you follow. Therefore, I don't really care about some computer program reading my emails and choosing adverts for me, in a way, it's quite useful. I was talking about palmtops/clies with a friend, and got an advert for a direct comparison, something I was interested in for a while. The adverts aren't intrusive either, they just sit at the side, all text, no flashing lights.  Right, now I've got over the bad bits... The good things... 1. gMail is  fast . Really fast. I'm running dialup 56k - it's horrible, believe me. Anyway, gMail loads almost instantly, and all. 2. gMail is  clean . I know, that doesn't mean much, but it looks good, and doesn't take up more space than required with fancy graphics. 3. gMail is  big . I mean, you get a gigabyte. A  GIGABYTE . I mean, that's more than my old computer. Wow! 4. gMail is  free . Yes, I know, so is hotmail, but that is bloated, fat, and smelly. You get big flashing picture adverts etc.  There is more, but I'm tired. Goodnight. I promise to post from Greece! -- Dom Out

       Quite good really Radiohead.  Right, in order to stem the floods of anger descending upon me from my friend (or at least, my acquaintance)  urlLink Amphion , I add the following:     "I, Dom Main, reserve all right to steal the idea of a post shunning all browsers except that of my choice, from the above person. Admittedly, the layout/content of the following are somewhat similar to Amphion's, but that is because this is intended as a counter-attack. Oh, and Opera is  poo ."  Just one thing... Use  urlLink Firefox  for browsing the internet, Instead of Internet Explorer.  1. Firefox is much  faster  - pages load in a fraction of the time. 2.  Tabbed Browsing  - allows you to have multiple pages open at once without having multiple copies of Firefox - surprisingly useful! 3.  Download Manager  - Just helps you organize downloads, auto-downloading options allow you to download certain file types (of your choice) to a specific place automatically. You can even hide the download manager completely, and be informed by a polite little box in the corner that you're downloads have all finished. 4.  Popup Blocker  - easy and built in. 5. It looks  nice  - not all that important - but Firefox looks nicer that IE. 6.  Searching  - small search box on right - easy searching. 7. Most of the space is devoted to the  webpage . After all, you don't want other things obscuring the view! 8. Firefox  loads faster , it's a nice small browser, not bloated and smelly like IE.  Firefox is admittedly still on version 0.9.2 or something - so it isn't quite finished, but I have been using it since version 0.6, and haven't come across any bugs yet - the countdown to release 1 is just interface changes and feature-adding.  Those silly enough to use Opera will probably be comparing the above list with Opera's many features. However, Opera just doesn't offer the same level of compatibility as the Mozilla/Firefox breed - ActiveX, though just a nasty Microsoft thing, is not supported in Opera. Plus I don't personally find opera as stable or as intuitive an interface as Firefox.  If you want more features - i.e. power user/web designer, use  urlLink Mozilla . Mozilla isn't so much a browser as an  Internet Suite  - it has a truly excellent mail client, IRC client, download manager, popup blocker and HTML editor. Of course, these features aside, it is a fast, secure and stable internet browser as well.  If (this is almost it, I promise) you don't want a web client rolled in with your browser (i.e. Mozilla). But still don't want to use Outlook (with good reason), head over to Mozilla.org's other masterpiece,  urlLink Thunderbird . It's an Outlook-style email client with a difference. It's fast, stable and secure. With built in (very good) spam blocking, fully customisable interface and abundance of features, Thunderbird is the perfect companion to Firefox.   All three of these Mozilla.org products are fully extendible thanks to the brilliant  extensions  concept, which allows amateur (and professional, if they like :) developers to extend and adapt the software to they're own needs. -- Anyway - off to Greece tomorrow! So don't expect postage for a while. -- Dom out

       How is everyone? I'm tired - or perhaps, I'm perfectly normal, since tiredness is my usual feeling to be perfectly honest. Even though I promised to update this damned thing every day, or at least as often as possible, It's hard for me to come up with something to say - especially when tired. So... Music! At the moment, I'm listening to "The Velvet Underground" - not a band I'd really taken any notice of until a friend spent a long time ranting about them to me, after which I felt it my duty to listen to at least one of tracks. Actually, I was suprised - they are quite good. I recommend a brief trip to the shops for all of you. Album title - "Andy Warhol" (Don't ask why, I don't know).  Ah well, that's about all I have to say at the moment - I'm off to Greece on Friday - so I won't be around until the 25th, though there is one computer I can use in the first week, so I'll try and update then! Anyway... Till tomorrow.

       The above "Welcome" was not for you. It was for me. I'm so horribly sad I have to welcome myself to my own blog. That's how long it has been.  The main topic of most of my posts so far has, indeed, been the fact that I never update this damn thing. Why? Because that is the main, in fact, the only thing that ever happens here - a lack of updates. This isn't such a bad thing though; why the hell would anyone want to read about my pointless endeavors? My pathetic attempts at comedy? My problems? Or those of my cat, who so recently disappeared. SEE? ARGH!  Well, what have I been up to? GCSEs finished, but that's no great news, it happens to thousands of people every year - why should I be so special? In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't actually finished, but were lurking around street corners to get me. Next year its Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Ad-Maths. Argh. I'm going to die!  DIE!   Does anyone actually like statistics? I know I don't. Neither do my teachers. Except one. The statistics one, what a suprise. He deserves cleansing by fire in my humble opinion. The other day we were doing probability. Now, you may say... "Probability? Easy! Simple! No Problem!" Well... you'd be wrong. This probability was EVIL - Spawned from the sweaty depths of satan's underwear (and I don't mean his socks). Who ever heard of " 'A " meaning "Not A" and "A U D" meaning "A or D"? The "U" is supposed to stand for "Union"... Doesn't that mean both? ARGH! This was the easier bit. If I could explain the weird bits... That would mean I could understand them. Which I couldn't.  Finally, I would like to make a solemn promise to update this thing regularly. I have put nasty little reminders everywhere on my laptop, and set blogger to my other homepage - little chance of escape, I think.  P.S. I have a new email! - "dcmain(at)gmail.com" - so use that under the unlikely circumstance of actually wanting to contact me.

       Yesterday, I had a rant about Dell. See below if you don't like them, if you do like them, then may God help you. Today, since I have at least 2 other company-based moans to exact in the future, I will talk about something  nice . Cats. Cats are very nice indeed. There are many reasons to like cats, and, in fact, many reasons to dislike them. It just depends on who you are, how you react, and what sort of cat you have. I recommend to everyone a particularly brilliant book by the brilliant Mr. Pratchett (and artist) called "The Unadulterated Cat". It's about real cattiness, how only cats which express certain characteristics are  Real  cats. Other ones are just balls of fur.  I shall quote a little from the book, and hope I don't get lynched by an army of lawers in the morning: "For example, if you put an unReal cat down in front of a row of bowls of catfood, it will obediently choose the one made by the sponsors of the ad even if the others haven't got slump oil on them. A Real cat, on the other hand, will head for the most expensive regardless, pull it out onto the studio floor, eat it with guilty pleasure, try some of the others, trip up the cameraman and then get stuck behind the newsreaders' podium. Where it will be sick. And then, when its owners buy several large tins of the wretched stuff, it'll refuse to touch it ever again."  Get the idea? Now, I'm sure you would all agree that cats must come in varying degrees of Realness, therefore, whilst your pride and joy with fur may exhibit some of the characteristics outlined in the above book, it may not necessarily look like something that has been kicked in the face several times.  In my house at the present is one cat. That isn't because we have 423 of them, and the others are outside but because we only have one cat. I know he's inside because he is doing something to a table-leg behind me. We used to have 3. One was ancient, older than me, called Domino (and NO! I was not named after the cat). The other was called Cahn (or Kahn, we never really decided). My cat. A really, really cool tabby/tortoiseshell cross thing, he was cool. However, with the demise of the two above, which I won't go into, we are left with my sister's cat. Midnight. And yes, the poor animal was called "Midnight" regardless of gender. I feel somewhat sorry for it, however it is an annoying little sod, with teeth that would do a vampire proud. I  would  put a picture up, but it would scare people. Midnight is doubly scary because about a year ago, he ran into a twig, getting it stuck in his eye. So one eye is a different color to the other one. Since we only have one cat, and it's a crap cat, both my mother and I are most interested in an offer made by one of mum's friends of a little tabby kitten. I think we should get him. My dad always ends up feeding/clearing up the shit, so he doesn't like the idea much. My sister, who claims to be a super cat lover, doesn't like the idea either. This isnt because she has gone off them, but because she thinks that it will upset her beloved Midnight. What a load of bollocks.  I think it's slightly scary that one can buy cats on eBay, but there you go. All our cats come fresh from farms, or random people who have a female cat, don't want kittens and don't consider the possibilities offered by many modern vets. You know what I mean.  Tell everyone about  your  cats! In the comments below!  No abuse!  P.S. If you don't like cats, go away. P.P.S I had a  haircut ! -- Dom Out

       Right. I'm tired, and have a headache. So, in an effort to make it a whole lot worse, I'm going to go nasty. Really  nasty , and have a good rant at one of my least favourite companies. In fact, most of the list below (in yesterday's post) is comprised of companies I don't like *cough* EA *cough* Microsoft *cough*.   Dell , one of the largest computer hardware producing companies in the world. There are few who do not know of the mighty Dell, few who have never had any dealings with said company, and few who, after the aforementioned dealings, are actually satisfied with the service received. Wow, that sentence just killed a few neurones. Anyway, Dell. The pros... (I begin with the pros because I don't want to seem biased. I  am  biased, so there is little point, however I'm going to do it anyway. You don't like it? Sod you.)  Good Stuff:      Ah, shit... there must be something.     OK. They are big. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean they are good, but it does mean that they are somewhat unlikely to take your credit details and bugger off to Siberia. In other words, you are probably safe ordering from them, you can send the crap back, after all.     You get to choose which bits you want, even in laptops. That  is  good, however the system is not perfect.     Exhausted by the mental strain of attempting to think of good stuff... I give up.    Bad Stuff: (Get ready, it's a biggie)       Prices  - Not insanely high, but not exactly good value for money either.      Support  - Crap. Total Crap. Really. I mean it. Want support? Ask a dustbin. Or a toilet, perhaps.     They do this odd thing... They modify your hardware, (graphics card, more particularly) and make it a "Dell" version. That means that no drivers other than those issued by the  bad-boy  programmers at Dell will install for your graphics card or other similarly affected chipsets. This means that as soon as Dell decide to stop updating, (they did that with my laptop in Jan. 2002, I bought it in December of said month) I lose driver updates. What made me even more angry (can it be true?!?) was that they  were  updating the drivers for my friend's laptop (the 9000 series (I had an 8200)) who had  exactly  the same card (ATI Radeon 9000). So, I spent a furious hour extracting (and I don't mean extracting as in Zip file extracting, I mean surgical removal here) the sys and inf files from said friend's laptop, I forced the drivers into the proverbial stomach of Windows (see a really old post, actually).     They made this thing dubbed the "Inhibitor chip" which did some nasty things incuding slowing your computer as a whole down a notch, increasing over time, (I don't know much about this... anyone who does, email me, and I'll edit). Anyway, it is evil.     They support  urlLink TCPA.  I can't be bothered to explain, I really can't. I might in a new post, at some point.     Their website, see "real life stories" below.     There is other stuff, but I be tired (it's 10:35 now, and I need to... well, I'm not going to go to bed for ages, but I need to do something else)    Real Life Stories: This will be updated in the near future, as will the above, however I have one little snippit of joy for you all:  I was just walking along the street, when, entirely unprevokocated, I was attacked... Ah, sorry, that's the script to the ClaimsDirect advert... OK, here we are...  The Dell website was being difficult, and I was annoyed about the whole driver issue outlined above, so I sent an email to their complaints department. About 24 hours later, the site blocked me. I couldn't access the Dell website. Other people on other computers could, but whenever the site realised it was me (by entering the service tag on my laptop, or using my laptop to connect) I received a variety of errors. Hmmmm... Draw your own conclusions.  I never received a reply to either the complaint (which was polite and clearly well worded) or the support request I had filed about a month before. Suprrrraaaaase.  Time to go, more tomorrow...  -- Dom Out

       Well, hello everyone. It's nice to be back anyway. As you can guess, by now I have, in fact, returned from Greece. That was about 2 weeks ago, but there you are.  It's quite hard to get back into the habit of updating this thing. But I shall make the effort. Over my holiday I came up with numerous things to talk about, and attemted to remember said things. And failed. Failed miserably.  At some point, really soon now... I'll post on the following:      C++     Dell     EA     Microsoft     Linux     Game Physics     My Futile Existence     Cats    And anything else I think of. So that's just over a week, if I post each day. Starting tomorrow.  In the mean time, go get Dev-C++ from Bloodshed software. Then get some tutorials.  -- Dom Out
