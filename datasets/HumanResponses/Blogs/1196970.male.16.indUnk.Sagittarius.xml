      Well apparently today is the block party. Joy above joys, how much fun is  that  going to be? You could almost piss in your pants just thinking about it. Kind of like watching a baby crawl around on the floor towards a dead spider and you just  know  that when it gets there, it's going to pop the spider into its mouth so there's that pent-up excitement; yeah well this block party's something like that, minus babies and spiders.

      What the hell... what kind of fucked-up and conceited self-defense mechanism is this? Whenever person A realizes they may be wrong on something (i.e. a dead phone means it was a telemarketer's auto-dial machine but there was no operator available to "take the call") they automatically get pissy and declare that you "don't understand". Fuck you! And it's always about small things too, like how our cordless phone should  ALWAYS  be on its charger even though it has a battery life thats longer than our cell phone. Fuck off, eat shit, and die.

      Woke up rather late today. Lunch kinda sucked, McDonald's isn't the best lunch, especially when everything's a bit stale from being in the car for too long. But that's beside the point. But there  is  no point, so it can't truly be beside something that isn't there, now can it? Kind of like how going to Hell is more fun when riding a SUV, but in a sedan, it's quite disk-shaped. No?

      Momentous occasions are fun. I mean, who  doesn't  like to see someone go something horribly stupid and yet horribly dangerous at the same time?  Par exemple , when someone decides to go cow tipping while on speed. And in flipflops. Yes, something like that. They'll be glad to know they made a momentous occasion after they've recovered enough to comprehend you, that is, if they recover at all.

Well within the limits of the law, at least. How funny. Whatever.  Damned technology... you would think that something that can process millions of pieces of information simultaneously should be able to remember that you don't like it when it screws up all your window sizes and when it insists that you only have two speakers and then proceeds to making horrible screeching noises out of the back two because, well apparently, they're not supposed to be there.

      Something really unexpected happened. I'm over at another one of these fucked-up boring as hell crazy Asian parties and someone walks up and gives me the new Harry Potter book. Well it wasn't just  someone  per se but it was still weird. I knew the people (and they're really nice) but why the hell did he stay up until midnight yesterday to buy iit in the first place? Well I spent the subsequent six hours at the fucking "party" ( heavy  emphasis on the  " " ) reading, so I'm almost done. Muahahaha.

After I killed it, she even attempted to put "Angel" (by the way, our hamster is also named "Angel", as is her teddy bear and a multitude of other miscellaneous items) outside so her family could "see to her".  Then there's the fucking computer program that messes up on installing itself and then refuses to simply fix the error, citing "a lack of copyright controls". Whoever the hell mkes up this copyright stuff needs to be shot. Several times, preferably.  There was more, but I don't seem to have the words to describe some of the other utterly ludicrous things people do... but then again, it's not that difficult to think up of some for ourself...

      Ever hear the fable about the king and the invisible clothes?  Well if not:  Once upon a time (as always), there was a kingdom (ruled by a king). One day, these men come into the kingdom, saying they can fashion the most marvelous clothes, clothes that only the wise can see. Enchanted by the notion, the king immediately orders the men to fashion some clothes for him. The men set off to work, sewing and stitching what appears to be thin air. However, the king (not wanting to look stupid) ooohs and ahhhs along with the men as they explain to him the wondrous embroidery on the clothes. When they're finally finished, the king asks the men to help him put it on (as he still can't see it) and calls for a parade around the town to show off his new finery. Everyone that watches the parade only sees a naked, aging man walking down the street, but they (not wanting to look stupid) oooh and ahhh along with their neighbors as they pretend to admire the clothes. Eventually, the king passes a small boy, who exclaims flatly to his mother, "Mom, the king's naked." and that's when he realizes that he was scammed.  Anyways, the moral of the story is...  Those clothes are literature.

       Finalement , back home. Home is nice, some of the time, I suppose. It kind of sucks that you can't simply assume everyone speaks French here though.  Quebec was nice, mostly. It's simply mindblowing how annoyingly closeminded my parents can be though. They get pissed because they chose to eat at the hotel restaurant (tip: you don't eat as restaurants where there's only a single waiter) and from then on, they refuse to eat anythign but Chinese food. Add to that the fact that there aren't any decent Chinese restaurants in Quebec City and you get really pissy assholes that bitch and complain incessantly about every single meal we have.  Minus the fact that I never got to eat at one of those nice little restaurants that should serve amazing food, Quebec city was alright. They have a nice art museum, especially since the museum itself is a work of art (it  was  a prison). Oh yes, and after visiting the museum, there was that stone hamster incident, which really sucked.  You see, we had to bring along this other, unbelievably frustrating, family. Two little whiny children that cry and whine for ice cream  every single time  we pass a street vendor and whine and moan about walking before we've even crossed the street outside the hotel. And then one of the stupid little fucks wants to buy a damned  rock  painted by some local artist to look like a hamster (20$ Canadian, too... what the hell) and the bastard loses the rock somewhere in the park outside the museum. For the uneducated, the museum is in the middle of a park; the park used to be a battlefield; battlefields are usually very large.  And so, the little boy curls up into a fetal position and starts bawling his eyes out, even though his parents are still in the museum. I really don't give a shit, he can cry as much as he wants. He seems to notice no one's paying him any attention, so he stops crying for a bit. But then, his parents walk out of the museum and, as expected, he starts screeching. Someone shoot him, please.   Next three hours are spent being forced to comb over an acre's worth of land, searching for a rock-shaped and -colored like a hamster...

      I like this weather, it's nice. Not too hot for anyone, and much too cold for some. So nice... but still sunny-esque. Isn't it amazing? But that's besides the point...  Life is so evil, all those little unexpected quirks and the such. Nothing ever goes exactly how you plan it, and more often than not there's a little something just lurking in a dark corner waiting to bite you in the ass.  I n   t h e   a s s . Someone very wise said that life is an experience, something that... well I don't remember the rest. A crappy experience, that's what it is.  And although I may sound pissed, I'm actually rather happy at the moment, just feel like... pondering... about life. Ponder,  songer . Fall is coming. Fall is nice. Fall ing  isn't, but Fall is.

      You know, I think I've read over my essay so many times, yet I keep finding all these little stylistic errors. So goddamn annoying, why I decided to put a comma here but not there.  Anyways, for the uneducated, below is my stream of consciousness piece for English.  Made some other stylistic changes too, but the column on the side that handles the "links" never seems to be wide enough. Argh, I'll fix it yet.  In the exact words of someone not-so-wise, enjoi.

The stupid fucks made it a full day instead of a half day, which gave all the teachers oodles of extra time to assign essays that are due tomorrow and dozens of math problems for homework. Not to mention that I don't know anyone in my math class and half the people that make class more bearable aren't in any of my classes anymore. Oh yeah, the whole modular classrooms are located outside the school, by way of the gym and several one-way corridors isn't really helping either.  Fuck off.

And then of course, everyone comes back within an hour to complain about how so-and-so thinks that point number  X  is invalid and shouldn't be used. Yeah, well so-and-so can kiss my ass.

Who the hell cares anymore, the only reason we cared in the first place (and by "we" I don't mean myself, I'm cold and callous and didn't give a rat's ass about it in the first place) is because she's rich and white. The dumb bitch didn't even seem to fight back...  "Here little girl, I have some candy for you in my car if you come with me."  "Sure Mr. Man, let's go. I like candy, especially when Daddy fills a Mercedes with lollipops and gives it to me for my 10th birthday. Mr. Man, can  you  fill cars with candy?"  "No... but I have a Tootsie Roll..."  No scratch marks on the abductor, no attempts by abducted to escape. Stupid white Americans.  And now onto the second rant...  This whole NHS (National Honor Society) thing is crap. Who cares? Academic pretentions are all crap. They make it sound all fucking speshal-speshal but really, its just a cult. You have to help all the losers after school by "tutoring" them and maybe they'll join the cult too someday. And of course, if you don't wear that speshal-speshal NHS pin on "induction night" then you're expelled. Yes, cult, m'dear.  'Tis all, folks.

      Nothing else to do, and I don't believe I've done a real update of this in a while, so here goes.  Parents at another annoying Chinese...  box social , shall we say. I'm just happy they're not nagging at me for one thing or another. PSAT's were today, that was crappy. What the hell is "standard written English"? There shouldn't be such a thing - it's a language, it's malleable; just because some dumbfuck who thinks they're the English God or something says that that question mark back there should go  inside  the quotation marks doesn't mean I have to do it. Fuck him. Or her. Or it. Yes fuck it. Fuck it all. Not sure how I got to  that , just ranting I suppose. OK done now, onto another topic.  In a tich, AOL Instant Messenger on.   Oh yes, what a piece of shit  that  is. Not only is their website an aesthetic atrocity, you're forced to download only to latest completely and utterly commercialized, bloated-with-ads version there is. It's not like there were any improvements between v. 1 and v. 2 798 345 or whatever the hell it's on now. Maybe the addition of smilies... ooh ahh... fuck it.  Gee I sound really pessimistic. Happy thoughts... happy thoughts...  So anyways there's that song about the bunny that hops through the forest, bopping all the animals on their heads. Is it "Little Bunny FOO FOO" or "FROO FROO"? The first is what "they" say it is ("they" should die), but the second sounds better. Does it matter? No, not really, but it's one of those questions of life that make this world interesting.  Yeah, that's about long enough, I don't think I've ever typed so fast ever before without making too many errors. Hip-hip-huurray. Cyanide-filled pinatas for  everyone .

      What a deal! A two-in-one post, just like those speshal speshal magazines with their " Weddings  Double Issue" and crap. Except part A is in no way related to part B.  The best stress relief? Cook. Or, rather, chop away at something until it turns into an undefinable pulp. Just imagine that something to be a finger or whatever of someone. Or maybe not someone, if that's not your style. But then that's not my problem.  There's no plural "you" in English. And that sucks. Firstly because we're demoted to using the phrase "you guys" or the even more horrible "y'all" and secondly because it sounds really awkward to say "and now, you plural die" or "and now, y'all gotta die".  In retrospect the two  are  related, but in a very weird way...

The person you expected to be...  unpleasant  may actually turn out as a much deeper person whereas the friend you thought you had is much more interested in the clothes you wear, the gum you have, the people you hang around... What fucking superficial, judgemental bitches.  At times, I think I'm too nice, too trusting. But it's all in good fun, or so its expected to be. So then what happens if its not? Frustrations boil over and I end up not talking to people for a day, a week, a month? Is that even a logical approach? I'm  not  bipolar  and I  don't  get depressed. I'm talking to myself again...  A logical approach. A logical approach would be to stop trying so fucking hard to please some stupid shithead that cares more about who you're wearing than who you are.

      End of vaykayshun. Damn. Depressed. And we had an entire week too. And we have stuff due tomorrow. Oh well I'll survive.  So it was alright I guess. Filled with people. People are annoying. So anyways for some reason my keyboard isn't typing particularly well so I'll stop for now.  I haven't updated in a while. I feel obligated.  Nostalgia is a powerful force, I realized that just recently. And it sucks. Die.

The conspiracy first started during Battle of New Orleans in Jakarta. They have been responsible for many events throughout history, including Bob's Second Birthday.  Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere. They can be identified by blinking.  They want to fuck the Knights of Columbus and imprison resisters in New York City using geese.

      Fallen oak leaves are as ugly as hell. Well, as compared to that red maple next to the bus stop.  I don't see why our essays should be graded by someone whose attention span can't even make it to the end of a paragraph, much less an essay.  Standard written English was a term coined by the uncreative.  I'm surrounded by idiots.  All the incompetent teachers seem to congragate around me.  If I had a digital camera, I would take a picture of the aforementioned red maple, but then again it's a bit too late. But that might make it a better picture.  When one gets an essay returned, it's rather disturbing that in the four days it's been away, it's suddenly acquired the smell of cigarettes. And that smell has presisted for many weeks.  Short. Succint.  Parfait   As a closing note: People have interesting life stories, if one takes to time to listen. School only gives one the opportunity to learn not from the teacher, but from the people.  Or at least that's how it ought to be.

      The next big thing: pomengranates.  If you haven't had one yet, go out and try one. Now. If you look hard enough, you might be able to find some for sale at a local supermarket. Otherwise, you'll have to try some international foods market etc. etc. They were plentiful a bit ago, but either Americans are stupid or the growing season is short.  I like pomengranates.

      Ok, so there hasn't been a real update in a long time. And fresh meat is coming by sometime soon to look at this, so I suppose I should write something meaningful. (Yes, you people know who you are...)  So, there's a lot of work to do, but if you take it all in stride, everything is supposed to end up all peachy. At least that's what the hope is... Nevertheless, things always seem to work out if you manage your time well, and no need to stay up until midnight either.  Today is Monday. What does that mean, you might ask? Today is naturally bad, even if it's not really that bad. But was it really that bad, you ask? No, not really. But it was still bad, because it's Monday. Monday. Wasn't there some stupid evangelist named that?  Evangelists are annoying. That, and they can be so damned pretentious. What the hell makes you think you're right? For all you know, you could've been some flop of an experiment by the citizens of Madagascar to breed a super-intelligent warrior for their schemes of world domination. I'm aware none of you know of the evil plans of the Madagascar-ians, but that's alright. You know now, and knowledge is power. So anyways, maybe they fucked up in the breeding process and they ended up with an incredibly stupid, stubborn, and gullible chunk of flesh that is supposed human. What do they do with it? Well, of course, they dump their trash in the same place every other country drops its stupid masses... America.  Oh yes, and fuck you if you think it's being ethnocentric to say "America" when you so obviously mean "The United States of America". Well if I so obviously mean it, then you so obviously know what I'm talking about, so go get eaten by some cannibals in the South Pacific.  Anyways, Mr. Stupid/Stubborn/Gullible gets dropped in New York. We're assuming, because I think flights from Madagascar ( Are  there flights from Madagascar?) should be cheaper going to New York. And I so obviously mean New York City, yet no one seems to bitch about  that . Anyways, he's destitute and homeless, so he gets taken in by... oh la la... some Catholic charity. Simmer on low heat for eight months and you have a new evangelical preacher that has plans of being either institutionalized or incarcerated for murder in three years, give or take. Three years,    mark my words   , three years.

      For a lack of productive things to do, I've resigned myself to posting here. Lack of things to do. But then again this isn't exactly spectacularly exciting.  Intellectual copyrights are a pain, you realize that? Only humans would come up with stuff like this; but then again only humans would attempt to pass off or simply take another's work as their own.  The Digital Millenium Copyright Act is rather... crap. It's prohibitive and nearly  carte-blanche . It would be nice to own one's own sovereign nation - other than the ovious benefits you can drink, gamble, fill your swimming pool with heroin... Moreover (such a cool word), you could kill people at leisure... well maybe.

      So now back to where I was before I was so rudely interrupted...  It's almost like a swimming pool filled with warm pie. Apple, preferably, but without that much cinnamon. And without the sexual connotations. Or maybe fudge, if pie isn't your thing.  But what exactly is someone's "thing", you ask? Or, well, I ask. I'm asking...  Oh yeah and I couldn't get a place on the Model United Nations thing. I'm disappointed, I suppose, but not necessarily angry. It  was  mostly my fault for attempting to join last-minute, damn procrastination.  So anyways that's enough sentimentality/pie for a day.  P.S. The new  it  word for English class is  precocious .

      Ok, my parents have fucking lost it. Who the hell asks for the boniest fish in the supermarket? And of course they decide to buy a dozen Cornish game hens (aka micro-chickens). Then they take one and go apeshit on it, chop it into thirty pieces (bone and all), and "stiry-fry." Let's see how quickly I can make everyone choke on a small piece of bone covered in what looks like shit. And as for the fish, we spent eight long agonizing days attempting to eat it. The first couple days we could make passable attempts, but after that the bone got so fragmented it was like trying to eat a pincushion. Albeit a pincushion in a really nice sauce. And yes you should be feeling sorry for me. And yes I'm thankful for your sorry-ness.

      Long time, no update. I'm aware, and currently working on a major super-duper extra-fantastic completely filled with cool-ness update. But until then, this will suffice. By the way, I have a valid excuse: I was doing both the Yale Model United Nations and Close-Up: WASHINGTON DC.  How were they, you ask? About the same, really. The former had more freedoms, as you could eat everything on your own time (in other words, no hotel food...) and there was actually free time. The latter? They babied you, but the people were better (as opposed to being around 1000 private prep school bitches). The food was horrible (and we all know my life revolves around food), especially on Capitol Hill. Our government cannot work effectively on a diet of "daily specials" that differ only in the color of ingredients.  As such, I call for an immediate resolution that our government kidnaps Alain Ducasse for the express purpose of feeding our Congress-people. Or, we let them all starve and our government descends into anarchy. Both are perfectly acceptable. For the non-food-obsessed, Alain Ducasse is quite possibly the most famous chef in the world.  But in reality, some of those Close-Up people were pretty pretentious also. And Dave,   NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF STUPID PEOPLE IN LARGE GROUPS   NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF STUPID PEOPLE IN LARGE GROUPS   By the way, it's by "Unknown".

      Not to get into details, someone I knew vaguely committed suicide. I'm still not sure how to react, it seems too surreal. It also seemed such an unnatural move. Why? But frankly, isn't that the question everyone asks when confronted with death?  I guess whatever precipitated such a move as that must have been horrible, obviously much more monumental than my own problems. And, however callous this may make me sound, everyone needs to know someone who has committed suicide. It makes you think twice about doing the same thing yourself. Everyone toys with the notion at one point or another, but when you see how it can adversely affect thousands of people, even people you didn't know well, you have to stop and think.

Weird, or any of its synonyms, would be a great way to describe the past 48 hours. Or 36, even. Who cares, just the past indefinite period of time starting with Sunday-ish and ending right around now. So many major assignments, but that really wasn't the biggest event. Some tension from having to present a seminar, but also from life in general. There was an unexpected moment of kindness, which did do a great deal to brighten my spirits. Thank you, although you do not read this. But you know, sometimes one just has to be optimistic.   C'est la vie , take it or leave it. Leaving it generally involves a tall building, poison of some sort, or a gun. Taking it brings sorrow, happiness, disappointment, humiliation, and laughter. It's a difficult choice, since you never know whether a life defined as a prolonged period of pain is truly worth living for. Not that I'm advocating suicide by any means. Just the deranged wonderings of a battered spirit. No, too melodramatic. Just some musings by a spirit. Better.  As for the portion that some of you  may  understand:  Thank you. Not just the obvious ones, but even the people I may never talk to again. In some ways, this is a gracious exit (not from life itself, just from a series of events). And Julie,  je t'adore . And thank you, not just because you guys have always been there. Well, always as in the sense of "as long as we've known each other". But thank you for whatever unnamed feeling it is that people can sometimes convey to each other. That, and a newfound appreciation for Pink Floyd.  And as for a certain person I hope never to talk to again. Thank you in any case. And I suppose I'm sorry. Not that you'll read this, but for whatever reason, I needed to get this out.  I seem to be waxing really sentimental. Oh well...   Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there with open arms and open eyes.  - Incubus

      They ought to be on the plane back from Denmark right now. Must suck for them, leaving Daneland for... well...  this  place. Not that there's a reason we have a Danish exchange program to begin with, no one speaks Danish. I'm assuming that's a language. Oh well, the best we can hope for is that they step off the plane at least mostly sober.

      Aw, how sad. According to  Time , "[t]hose slim, wine-drinking, chain-smoking Europeans are laughing at us [Americans]."  But then there's that gross low-carbohydrate thing going around, making it now fashionable to eat a pizza composed of nothing but mozzarella, sauce, and toppings. So when you drop over dead from a "major cardiac event", I'll laugh. Yes, I'll laugh just as hard as those quasi-sober but very thin (and isn't that what really matters?) Europeans.

      Well I got Mozilla working. There are imperfections, but the mail client is improved over Opera's. In any case, either is better than Internet Explorer. Surfing the Internet through the reflection on the back of a spoon is better than Internet Explorer.  But besides that, nothing eventful. Mike and Company is playing  urlLink NationStates , some political country simulator. Intriguing enough, I suppose. No espionage, war, or nuclear holocaust, however; what a pity.  In other news: according to reliable sources I have "mastered the art of saying nothing".  Damn, that's mighty exciting.  In yet other news, there was an awfully humiliating event that happened today. Well, two. In the first, a certain person who shall remain unnamed decided to chuck a plastic bottle of orange juice at me. For no reason. The second, I decided to bop the bookbag of a person who I though was a different person. So the person, who obviously was not the person I was looking for, turned around and gave me the classic "Oh my god have you fucking lost it? Who the hell are you? Go screw yourself." look. That was embarrassing. But Alex and I had a good laugh about it afterwards.  And then there's prom, which is in two weeks. Damn, it's edging ever closer. And I still need a tuxedo. And we still need to make the trance soundtrack for the limo. For no purpose but to be able to step out of a limo (which has fiber optics and strobe lights, by the way) playing techno music and act like Eurotrash.  La vie est belle .

       Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day  You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.  Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town  Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.   Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.  You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.  And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.  No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.   So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking  Racing around to come up behind you again.  The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,  Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.   Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.  Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines  Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way  The time is gone, the song is over,  Thought I'd something more to say.    Home, home again  I like to be here when I can  And when I come home cold and tired  It's good to warm my bones beside the fire  Far away across the field  The tolling of the iron bell  Calls the faithful to their knees  To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

      So my sister went over to an  acquaintance 's house yesterday and somehow they decided to give her the whole Jesus make-over. So she decided to spend today bitching and moaning about how we don't have a Bible and about how we need to go to church. And as a souvenir from yesterday's indoctrination, there's this little plastic cross. And you know what? The damned thing only fits into its base one way - upright, presumably to keep any heretics from defiling it. What the hell, bastards.

      "Speaking at the launch of the report, Amnesty's Secretary General Irene Khan said the abuses in Abu Ghraib jail should have surprised no-one, since it was the logical consequence of the relentless pursuit of global security and the so-called war on terror."   urlLink Amnesty International    On a different, but definitely not lighter, note, I detest Christian fundamentalists. Even if you are homophobic, that gives you no right to erect a monument commemorating the day Matthew Shepard died and was "sent to hell". That crosses religious lines; death is held, maybe not in high regard, but at least with a great deal of respect. The entire fucking world isn't Christian. Live with it.  It's the same concept with the war in Iraq. Sure, I don't agree with it, but it's still a horrible breach of ethics to jeer at the soldiers. You don't have to cheer them on, but it's more than just impolite to insult them. At the very least, stand respectfully silent, or ever walk away.  Here's irony for you. If it just happened that there was a "god" or higher power and he (she? it?) screwed over fundamentalists because they violated universal standards of human decency. Sure, they may have adhered to the finer points of the doctrine, but that's like putting a bullet in someone's head and staying behind a bit to wipe up the blood on the linoleum.

Because the United States was not founded on the principles of religious equality and a separation of church and state but is in fact a "democratic" puppet government with not the communists but god himself behind it all?  Back to the picture. Don't they look like intelligent people? Wouldn't it suck to find yourself being viewed in contempt by millions of people worldwide, to have make an absolute ass out of yourself in the international media, to give the French yet another reason to say "I told you so; look at the stupid  Americans ."?

      "Mr. Cattelan's art has provoked hands-on reactions before. When his 'Ninth Hour,' a wax effigy of Pope John Paul II felled by a meteorite, went on view at a museum in Warsaw in 2001, two men damaged the work by trying to put the figure on its feet.  The new work was sponsored by a private art foundation and produced immediate debate in Italian newspapers and, after its destruction, at the tree itself, where a seemingly permanent crowd of people gathered.  This vandalism echoed a case in Sweden early this year. While attending an opening at a museum in Stockholm in January, Zvi Mazel, Israel's ambassador to Sweden, damaged an artwork that he felt glorified Palestinian suicide bombers. The work was created by Dror Feiler, an expatriate Israeli artist living in Sweden, and his Swedish wife, Gunilla Skold Feiler. News accounts said it consisted of a large basin of red fluid on which a small boat floated with a photograph of a smiling woman, Hanadi Jaradat, a suicide bomber who killed 21 people in Haifa last Oct. 4. The ambassador's action was commended by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who told his cabinet that he had called Mr. Mazel and told him 'that the government stands behind him on this issue.'  Impulsive destruction that is sanctioned by a nation's leaders is different from the work of an inebriated, possibly celebrity-seeking individual like Mr. de Benetetto. But both acts seem motivated by a one-dimensional reaction and a  distorted sense of entitlement that is especially surprising in the case of Mr. Mazel, a professional diplomat . Most surprising is attackers' simple refusal to entertain paradox, to see art as a coalescence of gray areas, ambiguities and multiple interpretations. Art's job is to provoke thought in ways that are difficult to resolve and uncomfortable; it's a relatively neutral place to experience the unresolvable issues that dominate real life, to practice a kind of abstract flexibility that might move us toward resolution in real life."

      Everyone's been on edge a bit, maybe because prom is in such a short time; but whatever the reason, it appears that everyone's being ground into a fine powder. So when a friend made the simple comment "You have good friends.", it occured to me that I really do. I know sometimes it seems as if I take you (a collective you) for granted, but that is only because I'm comfortable enough around you to do as much. And truly, I do love you all and I  am  thankful you're there - I'm conscious of the fact that there's generally someone I can rely on, confide in, talk to, just a short walk or telephone call away.  And I'm sorry if my humor leaves anyone bruised or reeling - I don't mean it. It's just my attempt to enliven the journey that is life, to force some of you to see the less-than-rosy side of things, however irrational it may be. But people are irrational, that is definitely a fact. There are things about someone you may never know, and some things you may find out given time, and only time. So in conclusion, I admit I have some amazing people as friends, and I hope you'll all remain as such.  Merci .

      Robert and Schön Passmore took their children to Disney World last fall and left bitterly disappointed. As Christians who reject evolutionary theory, the family scoffed at the park's dinosaur attractions, which date the apatosaurus, brachiosaurus and the like to prehistoric times.  "My kids kept recognizing flaws in the presentation," said Mrs. Passmore, of Jackson, Ala. "You know — the whole `millions of years ago dinosaurs ruled the earth' thing."  So this week, the Passmores sought out a lower-profile Florida attraction: Dinosaur Adventure Land, a creationist theme park and museum here that beckons children to "find out the truth about dinosaurs" with games that roll science and religion into one big funfest with the message that Genesis, not science, tells the real story of the creation.  - The New York Times  Fucking Americans.

       A mong all life forms, man alone has aspirations to mutate into something higher. Ancient myths -- be they Greek or Inuit -- swarm with demigods who are smarter, swifter, wiser and a lot better-looking than the dreamers who dreamed them. After Darwin published ''Origin of Species,'' and primeval skulls with prognathous jaws and small brainpans came to be identified as ancestors of man, the idea took hold that Homo sapiens was just one evolutionary stage toward an even brainier superhuman. In the century since Darwin brought forth his theory, even our closest relatives, the great apes, would be appalled by how the products of our highest civilization can behave with such savagery, and only the congenitally ignorant would argue that man has made any progress at all toward becoming a more intelligent, more compassionate animal.  - The New York Times  Well said.

      Taking the train, you see stuff. The stuff no one cares about. Like the backs of buildings. For even if the front facade is awe-inspiring, the back is allowed to have peeling paint and dingy garbage containers in plain sight. Because no one - no one of import, at least - ever sees the back, so why should it matter? It's like you're traveling beneath the skin of civilization. But not only the stores, the houses also. No one in their right mind would allow their multi-million dollar estate to abut the  train tracks , not without a thick stand of trees at the very least. And then it's only with the wind's cooperation that you might - might - get a brief glimpse of the people who live in the Main Line.  The Main Line. The Main Line  of the Pennsylvania Railroad , the path taken by the very first proponents of "white flight".   Anyways, that aside, I saw a neat advertisement today, sponsored by  urlLink BarnesWatch .

      So today was the very first day of freedom, and we celebrated by going once again to Philadelphia. Except this time there were  fourteen of us. Thankfully, no drama really occurred, although it could have. And for that, I'm thankful. In all, it was fun; I enjoyed it immensely, although I doubt I'll ever have the patience to organise another outing quite this large.  The sectionalism wasn't as bad as it could have been, but even so I may have to start organising things by cliche. But that's giving in. And giving in is bad.  Anyways,  I miss Greg, in a way.

      I updated the sidebar.  Note that the artists in the sidebar are just a few of my choice. They kind of go together but are by no means all that I listen to. Hell, there's no rock in there, which is a pity. But it has to stay that way for stylistic purposes.

      Still in that creepy, light-hearted mood since who-knows-when. Must be something in the water, because I doubt both "the first thing" and getting an iPod can keep someone bemused for this long. I bet you they're lacing the drinking water with something. No, that wouldn't affect me, as I drink mostly orange and cranberry juice. Perhaps it's something in the air?  Or maybe it  is  the residual effect from those first two things which accounts for a third of the giddiness and the fact that school is almost over which accounts for the rest. It's logical and doesn't require any conspiracy theories. Good, we'll leave it at that.  I'm in such a good mood I think I'll keep writing. On what subject I hardly know, but if I continue writing I'm sure something interesting will present itself. You know, jump out of a dark corner of my mind, dressed in drag, and scream "Voila! I present myself!" at the top of its lungs.  Europe. I would like to go one of these days, do one of those three-month sojourns with a couple friends. That ought to be nice. Too bad airfare is 800$ or so at the cheapest (and that's to London, not  pah-ree ) with a Eurail pass at about the same price. Then there's shelter and food to worry about, although that isn't as hard to do. Who knows, it could be interesting.  Enough musing about plans that may never coalesce. I want something tangible and exciting to happen. Right now. Not literally, but something soon.  I think I hit upon the source of that nagging feeling. I need something exciting to happen. Not necessarily to me, just to happen. But what the hell constitutes exciting? Maybe it's just the sudden death of my social life as finals approach. Not that I care, although everyone else seems to. I need to get some totally apathetic people together this weekend and go do something. Something exciting, of course. Not super-exciting, involving fast cars, alcohol, sex, and death, but amusing nonetheless. I'm sure that at this moment I'm so interaction-hungry a sedate evening at Starbucks would pass as "exciting".  Sounds like a plan.

      Well I got my iPod, with an iTrip and remote and all that good stuff. I'm amazed, the radio transmitter really does work. And well. Well, well enough to listen to on the main stereo system without noticeable static. And that's good enough for me.  Anyways, I'm happy. And only from this thing, because that other thing kind of wore off. Sad, I know. But whatever; it's not like anything would have come out of that other thing anyways.

      That's what today was. It started out as shit, but because of a lot of big and small things, it got infinitely better.  This morning sucked, frankly. I was ready to shoot someone, anyone, by the time I stepped off the bus this morning. Not only was it crowded as always, but the only convenient seat was next to our bus' resident hick. You know, the NASCAR-cap, hunting-clothes, American-flag type. The fucker doesn't even pretend to see me as I ask him - nicely, mind you - to move over.  Dammit people, this is the  Main Line : we're all supposed to be in nice cars and nice clothes and at the very least above whatever IQ is needed for the basic bodily functions. The plain and unfortunate truth is that money can buy a lot of intangible things. Happiness, yes, to a point. Love, from Russia, I'm sure. Intelligence, I used to think so. Since when did we have to deal with rednecks?  And then, when I sit down in my seat, I sneeze. One of those gross, icky sneezes. Ugh. But as I'm getting off the bus, Erin, with her impeccable timing, is also getting off hers. Damn it was a relief to see a face I know and love. That in itself was enough to reset the day-counter back to zero from the negative-whatever it was on the bus. And then there was Vanessa and her photo. We all know what I'm talking about, no? And if you don't, well I'm not at liberty to explain. All you have to know was,  that  made my day.  Oh yeah, somewhere along the way I got an award for French for something. I guess that makes a small plus to my day-counter.  The other big thing today was Julie's remark, which I swore was made only as a gesture - you know, one of those phrases that pops out of your mouth, without your even realizing it, which is designed to do little more than allay the fear and worries and frustrations of the other individual. She said something along the lines of, "Oh come on, you can do better than that.". And I would have left it at that, a gesture, a meaningless phrase, if it hadn't been reiterated again. Thanks, guys, even if you're all simply conspiring to find that exact thing to say at exactly the right time - even if they're all naught but gestures - you still managed to make me feel better. Good enough that I'm not sitting on my bed brooding and miserable. Thanks, again.  Oh, and I got an iPod. Well come on, this  is  the Main Line, and in many ways (or  every  way?) , I  am  the antithesis to NASCAR-hunter-NRA-patriot-boy over there, but I'm damned proud of that. If I ever end up like that moron, someone shoot me. You can use the shotgun I'll have tucked away in my nightstand or whatever and load it with my special NASCAR-branded shells I had been saving for killing that big-ass male deer (I'm sure there's a more proper term for those, something I'll know if I ever do become a hick). Shoot at the hippocampus area, preferably. It's really fucking hard to miss if you're aiming pretty dead-center. Much thanks.  Done venting and gloating and venting and gloating.

      Professor Florida said that so far the greatest cities of East Asia were falling short of these criteria. "It is important to have the institutions, but you also need vibrant street culture and an open culture, not only openness toward ethnic diversity, but also diversity in sexual orientation and freedom of expression," he said. "Asia certainly needs a city like this, and Shanghai could be the one. Certainly the city that figures it out first will have some tremendous advantages." - The New York Times  A rare post from Governor's School, considering the severe lack of free time.

      Proofread and annotated. [Annotations are in brackets.]   30 June 2004  Culture is an elusive concept. It transcends all - race, location, and numerous other barriers. It’s pervasive, yet invisible; you make it seem almost like some hidden enemy or danger, lurking everywhere and everpresent, a constant threat. But what is culture?  What is culture? The collective consciousness of a people: the value, traditions, history, and perspective of a community - in the nebulous sense of the word - and the underlying reasoning for the above. The “why” of culture is important - possibly of more value than merely the descriptors of the culture. [I have no idea how I jumped from defining culture to some crap about “why”. However, why culture exists is probably pretty significant.] It is the foundation that has determined the current state of a culture today and where it will go - or where it can go. [Cultures are not in stasis, they revolve around change, or an aversion to it. Change is never always good, nor ever always bad. But one thing it is always - it happens, and there’s little you can do to stop it.] One must realise that change is something human beings are highly adverse to and it requires an often-intimate understanding of not only the position taken by an opposing culture but the experiences which have acted in conjunction to mould those positions. Who was it that said something about it being easier to condemn than understand?  Cultures are like diamonds: they’re valuable, multi-faceted, and seemingly illuminated by an inner radiance. But neither necessarily shines in their own right - they take input and meld it - transform it - into something brilliant. But unlike diamonds, there are innumerable cultures and co-cultures - every one of us is party to countless cultures at any given time. Also, diamonds are forever; cultures are not. Everyone joins and leaves given cultures on a whim or maybe out of some requirement or need.  [A perfect example of a transient culture is Governor’s School. Sure, we’re all here by choice, but we can’t leave the culture once we’ve joined. And in retrospect, the dynamic does change greatly over time. Time here is compressed, so the changes are even more noticeable. From the first, rather awkward, day to now, when we’re all more settled-in, one can see our society being changed - and changing - its members.]  Being placed in a foreign culture is interesting. Particularly is the culture is pronouncedly different than one’s own. [But isn’t every culture very different in some aspect than one’s own?] One feels lost at best, maybe even a bit intoxicated by the assault of strange and unusual stimuli. When I was visiting China in the summer of 2000, I was placed in exactly that position. But I’m Chinese, I said; and, I speak - if nothing more - fluent Chinese! How is it possible one can speak effortlessly to the populous yet remain a total foreigner, that one needs more than just words to relate? But we do; because culture isn’t confined to merely utterances of the mouth, it is expressed in the clothes one wears, the attitude one holds, the forms of interaction that occur which go beyond speech to encompass such aspects of communication as body language. But there I was, forlorn and confined, shunned as a waiguoren - an “outsider”. It sucked, knowing that I was essentially paying my way through life with greenbacks. Traveling to Québec was fun too; and I felt more at home there than in even the most Western parts of Beijing or Hong Kong. American money is just as useful in either place.  Yes there were stumblings in my attempts at “learning the culture”, but I thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. A wise friend one said that, “Even if you stumble, you’ve still made progress. And who can argue against progress?” [And another wise saying that went something like “It is only by being torn out of that which is comfortable to you, being forced to look at your life from a distance, that you see yourself.”]   2 July 2004  There used to be a class entitled “The Theory of Knowledge” that was offered at my school. Probably they had the whole ontology-epistemology, subjective-objective-intersubjective thing going. It must have been a wondrous class though, being able to spend an hour every day discussing what is, what out to be, why it is - or ought to be, and the underlying principles of that knowledge.  What does lying count as[, in this realm of thought]? I mean, if one believes strongly enough, [some lies can be as good as the truth.] And if enough people [believe in this collective lie]?   And thus religion was born. Just kidding…  But I see how the methods through which knowledge is acquired relates to culture. What is culture? [Defining it a second time…] In the very end, it’s knowledge. That knowledge may take on physical form in the traditions of a culture, but it can also remain solely in the sphere of memory. If a culture is suppressed vehemently enough, it often recedes into the thoughts of those who cherish it, to be brought forth again when it is safe.  Language is essential to humanity. Of course it can limit us, but that is better than the alternative. [I don’t think I knew what the alternative was when I was writing this. The alternative would be a dearth of communication, a total inability for knowledge to be passed one. Sure, one can acquire knowledge, but one’s personal - firsthand - knowledge makes up only a small portion of one’s “experiences”; it is by passing on knowledge between in across generations that culture is generated.] Knowledge is transferred by way of language. And every language has the ability to enrich the human experience. Every language is the product of a people’s experiences and travails; an audible tapestry that flows and morphs with time just as its speakers do. Language is instilled with the essence of a culture, even supposedly nonsense languages carry the weight of humanity, whether in a sense of childhood when speaking Pig Latin or community in using “’net lingo”.    god, this journal isn’t going anywhere.   3 July 2004    Starting anew, and hopefully this time it’ll be more coherent. And more profound. [Profoundness is a good thing?!]  Words are not universal. That is a given. But even if they don’t all manage to convey the same meaning, [there are universals:]human experiences - at their basest level - are essentially the same. I won’t use the love example, and thus end up on very dangerous ground, but attraction, curiosity, and repulsion are essentially constants. And - to be a bit daring - “love” is just a strong attraction. Anyone who thinks that love - “true” love - is irresistible, undying, and indestructible is merely deluding themselves. So I’m deluding myself.  Imagery is also nearly universal. Even badly translated works of literature originally rich in description are still moving. Pictures, as well, are worth a thousand words. Clichés may be bad, but they’re true. A good picture conveys something beyond the realm of speech, something that reaches into the very essence of humanity, to the foundations of what it means to be human. A strong image distills language, association, and emotion into the most basic components, whatever it is that all humans have within themselves, what they use to identify what it means to be alive, and experiencing culture, and human.    I know, I’m waxing both philosophical and romantic, so I’ll stop.  Loss is another basic human emotion. Its derivative is sadness. Anger is one too. And the derivations of that: frustration, envy ,and spite.  Back to language. If Sapir and Wharf are correct, it either totally or partially dictates our perception. What about those born deaf? What do they use to dictate how they perceive the world around them, if anything?  I think that some extent the hypothesis is true, but even for those lacking hearing, there are still ways to convey meaning without language. I mean, they still form the same connections with one item and another, but they do not perceive the world in exactly the same way.  They also are deprived of the “cultural” value of language. But those are also just associations of partially-related or totally-unrelated object, entities, concepts, emotions with a given thing. “Thing” is a nice short word. And I’m out of ideas.   	7 July 2004  So we need more “good stuff”. Okay, let’s take a stab at it, shall we? With lots of analysis. Lots and lots and lots. [I know, it’s all crap. Forgive me.]  Analyse oneself. That always provides some form of production return. Let’s see… someone in class said something about “hiding something about yourself”, so that’s the logical starting place.    I’m gay.  That’s a relief; I wrote it - in pen no less - and it’s done. No, not really. Through the whole of human history (homo)sexuality has been a touchy topic. Okay, so now we analyse.  You know there isn’t much to analyse. I’m frustrated often, but far from being depressed - or suicidal. Governor’s School isn’t particularly helping either: I’m putting the entirety of a typical (or atypical) teenager’s personal issues and a pressing need for a good hug coupled with a long - long - face-to-face talk on hold for five weeks. And here isn’t really the best place - nor the most comfortable place - to work through - yes, “through” is a good preposition here [since you have to work through your problems, not around them] - my insecurities and curiosities and whatever else there is hiding somewhere in my subconscious. I want to go home.  And sure more and more people are finding out [here at Governor’s School] and I haven’t felt any enmity - distilled, diluted, or otherwise - so far but I’m in need of someplace to vent. I have no idea why it’s in my journal, but there’s no other place. I apologise; skip this paragraph if you wish. I hate being here. I’ve never met another gay guy in real life before - well, one where it was known that we both were gay, much less kissed anyone. And I’m stuck here. Stuck. Trapped. My friends finally know, and this summer was supposed to be one to remember, yet I’m fucking here, or all places. Not that I despise Governor’s School by any means, just that the “opportunity cost” of being here is high. [And economic jargon begins its inevitable integration into my speech.] And there’s almost no way in all of hell I’d let - or want - something to happen here. I hate this; I need to stop; I’m lonely and unhappy and homesick. There, I said it. I’m fucking alone in the whole fucking world, or so it seems, and it fucking sucks.    [I have my blue moments, as I’m sure everyone does. That was one of them.]    I need to call Julie for a self-esteem boost; write more later. [I love you, Julie.]  Ethnocentrism and stereotyping are both bad. How do you avoid either? “Have an open mind” is the clichéd answer. What else? Embrace everything and anything, yet do not make generalisations. Essentially I’m trying to counteract both at the same time, but it’s inevitable one will tip one way or the other. But why do stereotypes persist? To be blunt, because they’re true. Generally true. Ethnocentrism? Well, for that there’s hardly an excuse, even a callous one. So I suppose it’s better to be slightly stereotypical instead of ethnocentric. [I still hold that opinion.]  Wait; there’s an epistemological question here: why - or may “how” is better - do we - or I - know that both ethnocentrism and stereotyping are bad? Ethnocentrism effectively allows one the right to trample all over someone else’s culture - and their associated values, traditions, and ideals. And that’s a bad thing; just trust me, it is. But what about stereotyping? It demeans people, I suppose. Well I more than just “suppose” - suppositions are flippant, but you get the idea. I think that this topic is getting boring, so I motion to advance to the next one.  Diversity. Is a term thrown around excessively by, well, everyone. [What else is it?] Yes, I do think it’s nice, but you can’t that so many things of great import and compress them into a single word. [I guess I was trying to say that the word “diversity” is burdened with too many meanings, variants, facets.] Yes having a diverse group of acquaintances - not necessarily friends - can open one’s eyes, but that doesn’t work if they’re all hopelessly ignorant. But, having a more or less homogeneous group of acquaintances who are all open-minded and well-read can still confer part of the benefits reaped by living in the midst of a diverse society. Not all, mind you, but plenty. [Which is why I adore my friends. Not only are they a diverse bunch, they’re intelligent and supremely fun to be around. I love you guys.]  I think this is by far the longest entry. [My entries are not separated, unfortunately. The date divisions are just that - date divisions. In fact, one entry was written over midnight and so crosses a date division.] And my letter “a’s” are looking more and more like my “o’s”. That’s not a good thing. I’ll write more later.   8 July 2004    I feel terrible writing during a class, but if he has to repeat that concept another time I’m going to shoot myself.  So, I need lots of analysis in this journal. And some way to lengthen this by another four pages, at least. [Handwritten, on college ruled paper.]  We’ve already gone over the basic emotions, but I’m in a mood to talk more. Attraction, repulsion, and loss are good ones. Or rather, love, hate, and loss. Or rather, hate, because I’m not in a particularly warm and fuzzy mood.  Why do humans “hate” anything to begin with? Especially between cultures; conflicts often appear when cultures meet and have occurred as far back as the first civilisations. And the reasons? Misunderstanding, or even a simply refusal to understand? And with its advent, religion. Dun dun dun… Sheer ignorance or all-consuming righteousness - generally on behalf of an “advanced” Western civilization and its linked religion - usually leads to the collapse, of even the annihilation, of the “other side”. Cases in point - Africa and the Americas. Just because one feels that oneself is “better” than someone else does not mean that one has the right to impose one’s IdealsValuesReligionPerspective on someone else. And once again we hit the wall of stereotyping and ethnocentrism. [And what a common wall it is. Can we ever get beyond the wall? I doubt it.]    My thoughts were interrupted and so now I have no idea what I was going for. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry. Sorry for fucking everything. Every fucking atom in the cosmos. Because it’s all my fucking fault, that everyone hates me. People suck. They suck, plain and simple. My gaydar sucks, which only makes things infinitely more frustrating.    Don’t psychoanalyse, just read. I’m not suicidal.    And once again I forget the end to which I was heading. Fuck you all.    [Another blue moment. Don’t know where the hell that one came from, though.]   9 July 2004  I’m just going to end up writing in this every day. Well I need it: it’s a nice place to vent. Oh, and it’s rather nice to put down all my thoughts on paper.  I think I’m stuck in a rut. And a depressing rut at that. I spent well over an hour on a conference call with five friends. The content doesn’t matter, but it can be seen as a case of “intercultural communication”.  [So the five other people aren’t really friends. In fact, some probably hate each other. But they’re willing to sit there and help me hash through my insecurities and problems. And I love them for it. There was a lot more written here but it was nonsensical and dragged on forever.] Do you think different cliques in a high school each count as their own culture? Probably, especially if each group is well-insulated and things of itself as better than everyone else. Ethnocentrism? Or maybe just blinding ignorance and self-interest. But whatever the case, it happens; not to the magnitude of this hypothetical example [What hypothetical example? I think I lost my train of thought and went rambling again.], but it does happen. In some way, it’s almost like taking the world and shrinking it to a small population or a thousand or so. Not as diverse, and often much more liberal [Actually, a couple weeks of Governor’s School has proven to me there are young Bush supporters. My heart goes out to them, the poor bastards never had a chance.], than the world as a whole; but, in some creepy way, the social interactions align in pretty interesting patterns. And the student council, being - surprisingly - not just a popularity contest, is the body that arbitrates and facilitates interaction. [I think somewhere along the way it morphed from a “hypothetical” example to my school.]    I really ought to go back to listening to “international political economy”   11 July 2004    There is not way in hell this is going to be fifteen pages. And typed. I apologise profusely. [Oh, the irony.]  So I went shopping - for clothes - today. Clothes are tied in to culture, aren’t they? [And who cares if they’re not? I like clothes.] Every culture or subculture - co-culture for all the politically correct people out there - has added its own flair or input on the basic components of apparel. Especially in wealthy developed countries (i.e. the United States), one’s manner of dress does so much to project one’s identity. Or not necessarily a true identity, as one can also use clothes to mask one’s own identity. [Clothes often reinforce stereotypes.] Sure, taste is entirely a subjective thing, but within a given group it is still somewhat codified to ensure some degree of homogeneity. Because everyone wishes to belong to one or many cultures, and clothes are an easy way of doing so.  Clothes convey social status with a mere glance. They can also convey one’s interests or beliefs, although less frequently. Adamant Bush supporters don’t wear t-shirts likening Bush to a monkey just as the rich and famous don’t wear just “ordinary” clothes. Non-verbal communication at its finest.  “The meeting of cultures creates disparities in societal norms”. [Somebody said in class.] Well of course, seeing as how cultures are a composite of the values and experiences of a given group of people. And by “given group”, I assume the members of the group are relatively homogeneous, not just a random clumping of people utterly unlike each other in any way. So of course their societal norms - and extension of ethics - are not going to mesh perfectly.  “Without the correct feedback, it is human to doubt oneself.” Is it ever. I’m close to being one of the most insecure people ever, almost completely unfunctional without at least a friend beside me at all times. Pathetic, yes, but I seem to have trouble relating actual, received feedback with the outcomes I’ve already mapped in my head. And yes, I do map outcomes in my head. [I’m not sure where this came from either. Writing longhand causes weird thought patterns. Or not necessarily weird, different. And being different isn’t a bad thing, they say.]  Feedback is so crucial to a successful conversation in any medium. Beyond the fact that feedback is essentially what makes up a conversation - a verbal response, a typed response, etc. - other, more subtle, forms of feedback are also important. For example, sometimes you really don’t want to talk to a certain person. So you send subtle signs - non-verbal signs - to tell them you’re bored shitless and would appreciate it greatly if they would kindly hurl themselves off a cliff. Generally one can make the conversation as awkward as possible by trying to remain as silent as possible, both in person and on the Internet. I feel bad implying I ignore people on purpose, but whatever.    Okay, I really don’t want to write any more.   12 July 2004  [This last entry was added for no reason whatsoever. No; in retrospect it was probably added to increase the journal’s length. Feel free to ignore it.]  Communication without feedback. Feedback without communication. Neither is possible since communication is essentially the interplay of feedback in both the verbal and non-verbal components. That sentence made no sense. I was thinking of chiaroscuro, but that has nothing to do with intercultural communications. And how can you have feedback occur without the occurrence of communication? Not really possible since feedback almost always results in communication.  Gestures. You know, those really pointless actions demanded by Society. “How d’you do?” and all that bullshit. It’s all been pounded into us since the age of zero so that there are entire conversations without an iota of feeling. But that can still count as communication, given a definition of communication where the feedback does not need any form of vested interest, just an exchange of symbols. And the meaning behind the symbols is… being nice, genial, amiable.  What crap.    Okay, ta ta.   15 July 2004    So I’m writing again. I don’t know why, or about what, but I’m writing.  I had such a good topic, but I forgot it. Dammit. So I’ll write about music. Music conveys feelings. [What is that? The seventeenth time I’ve said that?] Especially wistfulness. I’ve been rather passive lately. The “shopping high” wore off, so I’m back to my lonely, carping self. And I’m listening to sappy music. Or maybe because I’ve been listening to heart-wrenching music, I’m once again back to sad-Nan.    “There are lots of fish in the sea,” Julie says. Lots and lots of fish. Write more later. I think I offended a friend tonight. [It must have been near midnight when I wrote this, because this entry spans a date marker.] A really close friend. And really badly. I feel like shit, like I need someone - or something - to talk to. I hate this, why does everyone take everything I say with such gravity? Or rather, some people take me at my word while others never think I’m being serious. [Neither is a good thing, dammit.]  I’m really fucking sorry; what else can I say? And you. You’re her boyfriend - her best friend. How can you just blow it off? How dare you just blow it off?   16 July 2004    How DARE you show no emotion whatsoever while I’m sitting here, in anguish, losing fucking sleep over it? WHAT THE HELL?!    “I; I have become, comfortably numb”, the music says. No, I haven’t. I made a careless slip and now Kaitlin hates me.  This isn’t intercultural communication, it’s basic communication. The human experience in all its wonder and evil, happiness and heart-wrenching misery; all melded together in one pitiful and insignificant life. One. Such a pathetic number in and of itself.  Does life ever become so unbearable that you - ? I suppose it can. Maybe not indefinitely, but it can. And for that one infitesmal moment, it can seem as if the tradeoff is worth it. And that’s what scares me. As if? What if it is worth it?     Shine on you crazy diamond.    What is a life worth? I don’t; maybe it’s all relative. [I believe I meant to say “I don’t know.”.] How can such a simple question not have a simple answer? [Lots of simple questions have complex answers, or no answers at all.] How can this most basic - as basic as the sun, moon, stars - of questions still require a relativist answer? Is nothing universal in its being;  is nothing sacred?  [I’m not completely sure why I associated universals with sacredness.]     And you run and you run to catch up with the sun       but it’s sinking; racing around to come up behind you again.       The sun is the same in a relative way but you’re older:       shorter of breath and one day closer to death.    	     Adieu.  I forgot to cap a brand new bottle of white-out and I put it in my bookbag. No relation whatsoever to anything, it just sucks. A lot. And this gross new formulation doesn’t come off very easily. [Or at all, seeing as how my notebooks still remain splattered with what appears to be white paint.] And it feels icky on my fingers. Why can’t they just stick with the old brush [as opposed to a new, foam one] and the old, crappy formula? Change can too be bad. Such as this case. The brush just sucks and it’s supposed to be correction fluid, not permanent paint. Oh, and it still smells terrible. So really, there wasn’t improvement. In fact, the white-out company appears to be retrogressing.  Things you believe you can’t have are as good as things you can’t have. And that sucks, [but you can’t change your mind to believe you can have something if you’ve already decided it’s unattainable, no matter how hard you try.] The mind is a truly wondrous thing [in its ability to fuck you over]; it’s almost as good as real life. Maybe better.  I think the one and only purpose in life is to find satisfaction. Or, in even more blunt terms, happiness. In some way, any way. I need some happiness in my life. What else can someone want? I suppose everyone obtains satisfaction in a different way: wealth, power, spite, altruism. But in the end, it is the same goals. Humans don’t share very much in common with each other, but this they do share. The same ones at least. [No idea where this was headed or how it got here, sorry.]   18 July 2004    I don’t know what I’m supposed to write, but I’ll write something anyways.  Mobile communication. The next big thing. Not only cell phones, or even the super cell phones that can check e-mail and send video or whatnot. But internet access from alongside every major highway and in every major city. That is the next big thing. Even now, with wireless hotspots as the newest “in” thing, people are beginning to like - and become accustomed to - the technology.  Ohh, big point. When someone becomes accustomed to something, they begin to expect it. And that’s not a good thing. Westerners are accustomed to too many things. And so they expect the world to be handed to them on a silver platter.    Dinner.    Back from dinner and ICONS. Oh, I was having so much fun, my head could explode. Positively explode.  We - as Americans - feel like we’re entitled to too much. Like it’s our fucking birthright. [Hell, the land we live on isn’t even our birthright.] But why? Is society propagating our lifestyle? Probably. Can we change it? I don’t know, can we? If we all gave up something - Hummer, golf courses, rare wood furniture - wouldn’t we all be better off? The first “we” is Americans; the second, the world. To satisfy the United Nations’ daily water requirement for all six-something billion people on this planet, it would take 2.5 billion gallons of acceptably clean water a day. The worlds’ golf courses use 2.8 billion gallons of water a day. What an epitome of the bourgeois spirit - an activity that requires an enormous expenditure of water and land seemingly to make sure that the planet would be deprived of limited resources.  How can you get across a foreign concept to someone totally and utterly opposed to your viewpoint - largely out of breeding? Indoctrination is a powerful tool. Is it possible to defeat it, however? Not from within, I don’t think. But there are no outside forces powerful enough. So is the answer no? Is there not some method one can use to get one’s point across? Even if the other party provides no feedback whatsoever, is it possible to transcend bias and prejudice - and all the collected experiences that came before - and provide sufficient reasoning for a good argument?  It’d take more than words. Words don’t have enough power. Words cannot, in themselves, convey every nuance of human emotion. The symbol component may have once held power, but the meaning has been too degraded, too diluted, too limited to hold much power anymore.    And for that I’m sorry.   21 July 2004  In global citizenship today we were talking about weblogs. I have one. This is going on it. Because at first I thought about continuing these journals beyond Governor’s School but then I realised there are more effective places to put down my thoughts. Digitsed information lasts longer than paper. Especially when something is written in water-soluble pen. [In fact, I’m destroying the original copied of my journals after I’m done with Governor’s School; this will be all that remains.]  The internet is an amazing thing. I keep a public record of my thoughts on it. It’s the most sophisticated method of communication every devised by humans. It evolves and improves constantly; it hold no allegiance to any entity; it can create and destroy lives - both real and digital; it goes beyond what anyone in Renaissance Florence could have possibly imagined; or even people at the end of World War II. It now defines a significant part of the developed world - or at least the culture and methods of communication in the developed world - and it seems likely that the internet will only grow in power and efficiency.  Instant messaging is an interesting method of communication. But not a novel idea, really. It’s like walkie talkies in words. Or really fast telegrams. Sure, it’s more cost-efficient - and more efficient period - but it’s not an enormous jump between sending e-mails to sending really short e-mails in real-time.  It gives you time to think. Much like all writing. You generally tread more carefully since non-verbal communication is absent; things can be easily misconstrued or taken literally when one doesn’t mean it. Instant messaging can also get one into a lot of bad situations - it’s too damn easy to lie or dissemble, or to be so neurotic as to believe the other party is lying. You come to realise the inflection of one’s voice makes up an enormous amount of communication.  New topic. What makes sex such an irreconcilable item between men and women? Beyond the biological factors, I mean. [Is there much beyond those, though?] The cultural factors. That men are often rewarded or commended for asserting their sexuality in a way that their dominance - supposed dominance, I should say - over women is obvious. Why does society persist in maintaining such a double-standard? Because back in “the day”, men maintained their superior position through brute strength - something that mattered quite a bit in the Stone age - and somehow have kept that position over the past however-many millennia?  Okay, that topic got boring fast. “What if you use derogatory labels but you don’t mean it?” In other words, the word “gay”. Beyond reinforcing the homophobia of society, it deeply ingrains a terrible stigma in the word, often without the user realising it. In informal polls, almost everyone that has firmly declared themselves to be open and accepting persists in using “gay” or “faggot” - and its myriad variations - as curses or insults. And then I come out to my friends and almost all use of the world ceases. Amusing, no? And now whenever someone does slip inadvertently, there’s an almost palpable cringe and awkward silence. That’s amusing.    The end.   25 July 2004  These are getting increasingly sporadic; I feel bad. But individual entries are getting longer. Hopefully it will work out in the end.  Everything works out in the end; that’s part of my theory on life. Ever the optimist, stuck in my world fabricated from wishful thoughts. People say I trust in other too much. I think I trust in them enough - such that we are all conferred the status of rational beings, and rational beings are good in the end.  I’m relaxed and content. It’s really nice. We had to “check in” again tonight, but I’m still in a mood to ponder. The past couple days have been pretty damned amazing, especially since I met someone who’d make an absolutely amazing friend. But that person lives here [Pittsburgh] and I live five hours away. So it’s true you meet awesome people here, but you may never have the chance to just sit in a coffeehouse and relax with them, which sucks. Instant messaging and phone calls really aren’t good enough; it takes someone’s physical presence sometimes. You know, those people who are entrancing in person but almost blasé otherwise. That’s a major low point right now. But you just have to push it off center stage and seat it next to the box labeled “school-assigned summer work for the 2004-2005 school year”.  Society dictates a lot of things. Is that a good or bad thing? If we were all free-thinking - and I suppose ideal - beings, then an utterly unstructured society might not be so bad. There would be no need for laws if we could all make the rational choice. But we don’t, so Society is always there to ensure we make the “right” choice.  There are decisions we make for ourselves - or that we believe we make for ourselves - and those so deeply ingrained in us that we see only one choice that would be considered “logical” to take. In fact, some decisions are so impossible to escape that we don’t realise we’re making a choice. They’re transparent and pervasive. Like culture, in fact.  We constantly make choices we’re only slightly aware of. Or ones we’re completely oblivious to. Many many times in a second. Such as why I’m not stopping this journal and heading off to mingle or why I should jump on a coffee table and start doing the Macarena. Because there’s no one to mingle with at the moment and because it’d be ridiculous and embarrassing. Why? Because Society told me it would and has taught every to look upon anyone who commits - yes, commits, like a crime - such an act as an imbecile and to point and laugh accordingly. Moreover, Society has made it perfectly clear that being pointed and laughed at is a bag thing.   27 July 2004.    Last journal entry for Governor’s School.
