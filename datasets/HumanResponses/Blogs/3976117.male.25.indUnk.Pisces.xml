       Welcome to my blog. After having nothing better to read than  urlLink Rohan 's blog in the evenings, I've decided to write and read my own blog&nbsp;;)&nbsp;&nbsp;I promise I will not ramble or rant and waste your time.  But I am not exactly sure what I am going to blog about. So let me just talk about something for a while...  err...Hello...Hold on...Dont close the browser yet! I was just kidding. Don't you want to know me? Good. Then, I'll post personal, technical stuff and all kinds of goofy things that I do/think, here. I hope you'll find it informative/humorous.  If you are/not a photo enthusiast feel free to look/comment on the  urlLink pictures  that I took&nbsp;in my recent trip to Los Angeles and San Diego. I would like to learn the beautiful art of photography. Check out  urlLink www.photo.net  and  urlLink www.pbase.com  if you are/not a photo enthusiast.  Also check out  urlLink Saifee 's blog.  I've made this a rather long post, 'cos I haven't had time to shorten it. So pls excuse me. See ya later.

       The first tennis match I ever watched on TV was between Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl. I dont remember if it was the 1989 US Open final or some match in 1990, but I was hooked to tennis ever since I saw that match. As with many of you guys, I became a huge fan of Becker, followed every one of his matches through my loving neighbour's 'The Hindu', which was the only local English newspaper which covered tennis tournaments, in a small column in the sports page. Unfortunately, I did not get to grow up with computers and internet till I came to college (I was introduced to computers by my dad when I was 5 - only in my SOP! ;), so there was no 'live scores'. I, however followed the Grand Slams on TV.  Even after the Becker era, I continued to follow tennis - but never followed or supported any player as much as I did Becker, surprisingly not even Sampras, the Great. I have rather become an admirer of the game. Some of my favorite players in the current circuit, besides Agassi, Federer and Roddick are Carlos Moya and David Nalbandian, who on their day could beat the former three.  urlLink Maria Sharapova  has rekindled my interest in women's tennis for all the reasons I used to follow it during the Steffi Graf era. Oh, she is hot with a wickedly cute smile and a funky attitude and is also talented, which makes her an exciting watch. Now that I have been playing tennis for over a year, I have become addicted to the game a little more.  I bought a Head Intelligence X3 Racquet last week, but am yet to get used to it because it is about 2 ounces lighter than my previous racquet, forcing me to swing higher and with a tighter grip. Here's a picture:     I would be demo-ing a lot of racquets in the coming weeks, courtesy  urlLink L B Houston Tennis Club  in order to select my next racquet, I am not happy with my new racquet. I would be playing every thursday at 8pm at the club in the league matches for the 3.5 to 3.9 group. Though I serve and volley well, I still play terrible tennis - need to work on my groundstrokes! Alright, I am off to hit some shots. See you later.   .
