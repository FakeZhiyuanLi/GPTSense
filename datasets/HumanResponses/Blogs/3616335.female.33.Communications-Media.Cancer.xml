      I was very active in "religious" things for seven years. That seems like a long time to me to be active, just like the four inactive years that followed seems long. In the four years that I was out, the Lord showed me a lot. He showed me that I was very judgmental. I can remember during my "religious" days truly feeling that if you weren't in church every time the doors were open you were not living right. God said "Kendra that's crazy, it's not about them being their every time the door is open, it's about them having a DESIRE to be there every time the door is open, see the difference?"  I got to thinking about the difference. Of course, God was right.  Some folks are there every time the door is open but appearance means nothing, how's their heart? What is their true motive for being there? Guilt? Boredom? Habit? What is MY true motive for being there? Sometimes, I hate to admit, it's obligation, it's because I don't want people to talk because I missed, it's for this or that, but lately, I'm glad to admit, it's because of my DESIRE.  My DESIRE to be near my Lord, my DESIRE to hear God's word preached and taught, it's my DESIRE to feel His presence, my DESIRE to worship my God and Savior. Ahhh, to worship. Where is the DESIRE of the people to worship?   I hear so many prayer requests for revival, "oh Lord just send revival", "Please Lord send revival to our people". The Lord spoke very clearly to me about revival one night, he said "Kendra, you guys don't need a special speaker to get revival, you just need my presence and DESIRE". WOW, I thought. How easy is that, I feel your presence right now Lord. You are in this place! I grew excited, I felt like we were on the brink of revival. Pastor continued to teach and I was filled with the Holy Ghost right in my seat, a short altar call was given. I headed to the altar, closed my eyes and began to worship. Oh heavenly Father, how I praised you and gave you praise and honor and glory. How I blessed your Holy name, I raised my hands and offered thanksgiving to you for your son and the precious name of Jesus. I felt certain the rest of the church must be around me in reverent awe of the strong presence of God that surrounded me...when suddenly the music stopped and someone came over the microphone giving an announcement reminder about this or that. My Spirit grieved, I cried. My hands were still lifted up, I praised as the tears flowed down my cheeks as I heard laughter behind me, and loud talking, people zipping up their Bibles, visiting with others as they made their way to the exit. Then someone walked by me and bumped me as I tried to worship. Some of the musicians tuned their instruments, my hands are still up as I worship. My Spirit grieved. The tears fell. "Where is their DESIRE???" I cried to the Lord. I opened my eyes and one other was at the altar with me, trying to worship. The rest of the sanctuary was emptying out, except for a few stragglers that were visiting with each other about the latest news in their lives, what kind of home products were they selling this week? "WHERE IS THEIR DESIRE?‚Äù I cried. My heart was broken, my Spirit grieved. The Lord blessed me though; He filled me for what seemed like forever, I continued to worship Him. He blocked out the random noises and filled me with His presence. I pray in tongues often, but usually in a quiet way, but He filled me and I felt as though I was shouting out prayers to heaven in my prayer language. My Spirit was praying for something urgent, something that the Lord knows. Someone got saved, someone was healed, someone was safe because of those prayers. "WHERE IS THEIR DESIRE, LORD?"   He brought to mind memories during those seven years of being "religious".  Altar calls filled with the same people I attend with now. I remembered being at that altar until 1:30 in the morning, people dancing and laughing in the Spirit, slain while the Lord spoke secrets to their Spirits. Marriages mended, wombs opened, souls saved, diseases healed all in that altar! "WHERE IS THEIR DESIRE, LORD?" Where is their desire?   I know that I've been gone four years, and some would say that I have a new and fresh start. I have the fresh desire now because I have so much to be thankful for, because He brought me out of four years of sin. Well, maybe they are right. Does the Lord need to do the same thing to them, to bring back their desire? He can, ya know. What happened to them? Did they dry up? Have they become so used to the Lord's presence that they have no reverence for it? No awe? No respect? My Spirit cries out! WHERE IS THEIR DESIRE?   Memories flood back of the respect that was given to an altar call. The altar call was for souls to get saved, physical, mental and spiritual healings, it was for worship. It's not the time to RE-announce the announcements you made at the beginning of service. It's not the time to tune your instruments or practice for the next service. If someone is in the altar the Lord is still moving! It's a time for prayer; it's a time for worship. The Lord yearns for it! He demands it! When did we become so contemptible? When did we forget why we go to church? When did it become a habit? What happened to our desire?   It seems to me that people have forgotten how to worship, or they think that if they spend time at the altar people will think there is something wrong with them. I have found that when I linger at the altar, at times, people will come pray for me, out loud, that the devil will loose me. Loose me from what? Praising my LORD? They have forgotten that in worship comes tears, bowing and shouts of praise. Every altar visit is not about conviction of sin, have we forgotten how to worship?   I say that if it took me being out of church for four years to remember how to worship, to renew my DESIRE then I'm glad I was out. If keeping my church attendance perfect for those four years meant me losing my DESIRE for the Lord, then mark me absent every time. Revival is there; my question is.... where is our desire?
