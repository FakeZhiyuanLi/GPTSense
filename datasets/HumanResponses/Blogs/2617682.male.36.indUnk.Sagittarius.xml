      ..."For you, ze Euro 2004 ees over"  Probably what the referee said as a few dodgy decisions resulted in England's departure from the tournament we all had a sneaky feeling we would win.  Bummer.  The flags and stuff that have been all over the place for ages now are slowly starting to be put away for next time. It's been good to see all the banners and flags on the cars and buildings, such open displays of patriotism are usually frowned upon in this country but it seems to be standard practice in America....and they have nothing to be proud of. The argument seems to be that the flags could be seen as being nationalistic and could threaten/upset the population that is of Asian origin. But they seem to be joining in too, so work that one out ! Certainly all the taxi's around here have been flying the flags.  While I'm on about Taxis, Burnley officially has the fastest taxi's in the world. Wherever you are, and wherever you want to go to, at whatever time of the day or night, if you order a taxi the reply is always "..be there 5 minutes mate, alright ??".  How do they manage that ? What do they drive, rocket ships ??  Anyways, the large St.Georges flag with The Rovers crest on that has been on display in the house window (and been gaining many admiring glances from the neighbours) is now on borrowed time.  Bloody David Beckham, I say. The link on the right has a report which says a lot more....... (not for you, mum!).  Here's a thing ! If you have one of these bloggy things, and put your interests down, it automatically links to a list of people with similar interests. So I was looking around and there is someone else out there who lists SPIDER as a musical preference ! Is this THE Spider ?? The Scouse boogie band of the 1980's who had a liking for stripey trousers and PG Tips ? I can't ask him, unfortunately, as he is based in Malaysia and speaks 'foreign'.  He also looks like Raditz, so I don't want to risk upsetting him...  Last I heard, Brian Burrows (base player & floppy moustache) was doing OK with his business designing album covers and playing around with VW Beetles.  Fave Spider song ?? 'Rock n' Roll Gypsies' 'cos it's a good one to bounce about to !

      There should be special 'tit areas' at public entertainment events.  I went to see YES at Manchester Arena on Saturday. A brilliant show and highly enjoyable, apart from the tit a couple of rows and to the right of me.  This pillock, I presume, came from Accrington (which says a lot in itself....) and ramdomly, shouted out 'ACC-RING-TON', 'Hey, Jonny boy', 'Ahlll-right !!' and 'A-Whoo-ha' at fairly regular intervals.  The event hosting team should be allowed to employ snipers for such people.....  Whilst initially being very annoying, it did become quite amusing as a fellow tit on the other side of the arena decided to return the 'A-Whoo-ha' calls !  It was like some mating ritual going down !   Surely there should be a case for keeping idiots like this into their own (soundproofed) area ?  Otherwise it was a great night !   And another thing !.....  Not sure what the situation is with Manchester and cows, but there are loads of them all over the centre.  A bit strange, but better than some statues and street art you find !
