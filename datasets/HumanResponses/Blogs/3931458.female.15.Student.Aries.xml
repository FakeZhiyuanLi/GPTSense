      oh i'm in my happy place now!!! mom and i went shopping today it was actually alot of fun. we didnt fight and we bought alot of stuff!!!  when we went to walmart to get stuff for the trip we decided to do the self check out, well that is a bad idea, cuz the self check outs at walmart spazz out. it was scary it started like yelling "item out of the bag" and i kept repeating it over and over and over! it was horrible!!!!  we went to a bunch of places and they all had their skirts on sale so i got 5 new skirts 2 shorts a new really really cute denim jacket a purse and some thongs!! the jacket was my favorite i think it is the cutest thing!!! i need to go and get some shoes to match!!!  i usually dont like wear skirts cuz i feel fat in them but i was having a good self confidence day so i went ahead and got them so in a few weeks i will b mad cuz i spent money on skirts that i dont like to wear cuz i feel fat!!! but they are really cute!! so i doubt i will b mad!  one of them is like a marroon one,a denim one ( which i really like),&nbsp; a courdoroy light blue one, a black and white one,&nbsp; and a navy blue one. my dad says that they are too short but they really arent!  I love my new Clothes!!!!!

      wow the the movie was so much fun!!! there are so many stories but i bet i will forget some of them!!!   ok so I am upstairs laying down not really doing anything but i have no clue what time it is and i have no make up on and i am not dressed to go out so miree comes in my house and i'm like what the heck? she said she would call me but of course miree never does what she says cuz she is a L-I-A-R LIAR!  but so we get in connie and we are driving and i ask miree what is this stick thingy in her car. and she is like its my parking brake. well, i had no clue what it was and she had to explain it to me untill i understood what it was. and once we got to the movie she pulled it out of habit and i go " oh thats the parking brake" it was funny   so we are driving and talking and as we are passing through a light miree kisses her hand and hit connie on the roof! i was like what was that? and miree was like oh we passed under a yellow light. it was something that erin alwayz did so now miree does it! it is kinda wierd!  ok so we are walking up the stairs and we are deciding on where we want to sit and i slip going up the stairs it was embarrassing!  so we are sitting watching the movie and all of a sudden miree's hand was on my leg!   ok so during the movie they had a part where they layed down in the street watching the lights change and the light was yellow and i kinda hit miree cuz it reminded me of the yellow light and her hitting connie but she didnt get it untill after the movie when i told her!  ok so we are sitting down watching the movie and this guy who is sitting 2 seats away from me was commenting so much it was funny like when the people in the movie were making out he covered up it daughters eyes and was like "oh NO" and stuff like that it was funny!!!hehehe  so the movie is over and we go to the bathroom cuz&nbsp; i needed to utilize the latrine and as we are leaving the restroom you know how heavy those doors are at the woodlands well i kinda forgot and pulled it and hit myself and i was so confused and we just laughed! it was great!  ok so we leave the bathroom and miree calls chris and was talking to him and so i wanted to talk to him so she hands me the phone and i was like "hey matt" then i just stoped cuz that was miree's ex and was like omg and then i burst out lauging i felt so horrible, but ya no he was infringing on miree and jordyn time.  so i think this is all but miree if&nbsp;i forgot something remind me!!!   &nbsp;

      OK so today i woke up around 8:30 actually my mother woke me up cuz she had to go get her nails done and i had to watch baby elizabeth and we had fun untill she would cry then i would get annoyed but then caroline came to the rescue and we watched elizabeth. when mom came home she made all of us pancakes so i feed elizabeth some! she really like's to sit on the table and eat!! then micha came and picked up elizabeth. then i just hung around and did nothing for a while untill my mom and i decided to go to outback to see vanessa.  &nbsp; so we ordered our food and they didnt have potato soup so i was very upset and just asked for a salad instead but then my mom got her onion soup and i tried some and i liked it so i got some onion soup instead! it was really good!  &nbsp; we didnt get to see jason and ask if he was wearing underwear so we were a little dissapointed.  &nbsp; oh and we brought some bread home and we stopped by sonic to give it to kayla and she comes out and reaches for the bread before she even gives me a hug!!! i was so upset! but it was ok i forgave her!!! hehehe

      Around the corner I have a friend, In this great city that has no end, Yet the days go by and weeks rush on ,And before I know it,  a year is gone. And I never see my old friends face, For life is a swift and terrible race, He knows I like him just as well, As in the days when I rang his bell. And he rang mine  but we were younger then, And now we are busy, tired men. Tired of playing a foolish game, Tired of trying to make a name. "Tomorrow" I say! "I will call on! &nbsp;JimJust to show that I'm thinking of him. "But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes, And distance between us grows and grows. Around the corner, yet miles away, "Here's a telegram sir," "Jim died today." And that's what we get and deserve in the end. Around the corner, a vanished friend. Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them.Don't !  be afraid to express yourself.  Reachout and tell someone what they meanto you. &nbsp;Because when you decide that it is the right time it might be too late.

      omg lets say somebody in your family has a cell phone and you hear it ring what would you do if that person was downstairs and couldnt hear it? well one thing that you wont want to do is to answer it. cuz lord knows that if you answer the cell phone you turn into the worst person in the world cuz you are wasting minutes. all i was trying to do was to answer my brothers cell phone cuz it was my dad who was calling, well obviously thats not what you do so i dont think i'm every gonna answer any phone again cuz i might get yelled at again!!! people these days! *sigh* ( i got that from miree)

      church is awesome I love it!!! hehehe Ok so not really most of the time it is boring! But today austin miree and i went to st. anthony's it was great! we decided to go there cuz they get all into the hugging and hand raising stuff that we just dont do! so we went there and sat in the back and we pretended like we knew what we were doing with our hands while we were singing. and during the Our father austin and i played tug-a-war with miree!!!! oh and miree was hitting on me! it was kinda gross she kept putting her arm around me and touching my leg! oh oh and the preist was so funny cuz most of u guys have read about the catholic priest's and how much they like little boys and so during the homily the priest goes " i am going to tell you a story about two BOoooys." i dont know if u will get my meaning when i write it but he dragged out the word boys it was really funny that was great!!! Oh and we decided to leave after communion so that way we wouldnt have any trouble with getting out of the parking lot. &nbsp; After church we went to see kayla at sonic! thanks for the&nbsp; message on my bag Kayla and for all of the condiments you gave me! Oh miree taught me how to jump into connie. i thought that if i did i would break my leg or something but i didnt.  &nbsp; When we got back to my house connie was being annoying cuz she wouldnt let miree take the keys out and she wouldnt start. so she is calling her dad and i go inside and get austin&nbsp; and miree is freaking out yelling at both connie and her dad so austin just calmly says " put the car in drive and then in park" and so miree does and it works!!! connie lets go of the keys and everybody is happy! &nbsp; oh and my dad had us watch this old show or something where the guy didnt talk and he was pretending to use a chemical set or something. sorta like a mime it was confusing i didnt understand it!!! &nbsp; oh crisco thanks for the comment!!! now at least 3 people read my blog!!!! and yes u did shun me!!! i cried myself to sleep many time over the years and its all cuz of u!!! hehehe j/k you are a great friend. we have to get back together again soon!!!

      I really didnt write that much about game day yesterday but for those of you who care it was ok I had alot of fun with miree and kristi. Oh and I met chelsea she is really sweet! Since i couldnt get in the water cuz of my foot I was in charge of the prize table wich half of the time i left it cuz it was too hot outside!!! Miree kiristi and I left like 2 times to get ice for the snow cone machine I think we all got frostbite! Oh and Miree kicked connie! I felt so bad for connie! (btw connie is miree's car!) we also did a pinata and my dad made hot dogs they were pretty good it was the first time i had hot dogs in a really long time.  &nbsp; Oh when we did the pinata I did my good deed for the day!! I was so proud of myself! We did it in the parking lot and the cement was hot. and i know how hot cement can hurt thanks to CTO lee making us do push ups on the cement but anywayz this little girl didnt have her shoes on so i let her have my flip-flops so that way she could go and get some candy! she was so cute! &nbsp; after game day ended We went to champs to get some food. Normally i would say dinner but i dont think that what we ate was actually dinner! we did have some normal food but most of it was desserts we had 3 messy sunday things a cookie icream thingy a mile high cake and a chocolate cake and we had onion rings and 2 sampler platters! &nbsp; oh funny story at champs there were 10 of us (i think) but we had two sets of onion rings at each end of the table, well vanessa's end finished all there onion rings (imagine that) and we only ate like 2 of ours, well when the waiter came to pick up the food he asked us if we were done with the onion rings and miree,chris, chelsea and i were like yea, but vanessa saw that we still had some and was like OH OH OH it was so funny I guess you had to have been there! but since miree is the only one who reads this i dont think it is a problem cuz she was there!!! &nbsp; Tonight ausitn miree and i are going to st. anthony's for church so we can make fun of them!!!! I cant wait!

      Yesterday was alot of fun but I was so tired by the end of the day today i didnt want to wake up for "game day" at the pool! Actually I dont know why I was so tired because for most of the day i didnt do anything except for watching TV and messing around on the computer! But I helped my mom get ready for her crop( which miree was having too much fun with other people to come) and I was supposed to go with my dad to his work but since i thought kayla was spending the weekend with me I decided that I was gonna stay home, well kayla's parents decided not to go to normangy for the weekend so kayla wasnt isnt staying with me this weekend so i was gonna tag along with Vanessa,Austin, and Miree when they went shopping, but they didnt wake me up! So i was left at home! but when Austin did get home we invited andy and Kristi to come over cuz they wanted to hang out and we all got the pool/clubhouse ready for game day! It was pretty fun Kristi spent the night. I havent seen her in ages!

      omg who do people think they are?? they have no business telling other people what they think about other peoples relationships. dont go telling somebody why you dont think you should be going out with someone. its not their decision.if people wanted your opinion they would ask for it, but dont butt into&nbsp; peoples lives. ugh i cant believe some people. and the sad part is i'm not talking about just one person. it really makes a persons get all fired up when some one decides to run your life. umm hello i can make my own decisions for myself thanks any way! omg people are so done they are its not even funny. if you dont no what i'm talking about u can ask me but dont expect a quick recap oh no if you want to know the whole story i can tell you about all of the smart a$# people and what i think of them and their big mouths! i'm done i'm off to fume in my room.

I thought kayla was working but it was her day off. but we drove in and parked and ordered. all the car hops were delivering food all around&nbsp;us and miree says&nbsp;"oh i hope we have him"&nbsp;it was this guy who was pretty cute but he looked like he was mad. so&nbsp;when he comes back out again i see him coming toward us&nbsp;&nbsp; with our food!!! i tell miree "oh my gosh he is bringing us our food"&nbsp;and she says no he isnt and i was like&nbsp;yes he is look and she goes no i'm not&nbsp;gonna look so he comes up and gives us our food and miree gives him her credit card and the total was like 9 something and as soon as he left to do the credit card thingy we start looking through her purse and car for money to tip him! we ended up tipping him&nbsp;$3!! hehehe!&nbsp;oh&nbsp;and his name was shane!!! he was pretty cute! but Jared&nbsp;is&nbsp;much more cute!&nbsp;

      i forgot about the trip to kroger yesterday! Ok yesterday miree and i decided we wanted to have some aloutte cheese so we went to kroger! as we were walking into kroger my mom calls miree's cell phone and told her she just dropped of some aloutte and crackers at the pool! but we still wanted to get some from kroger. so we assume that it would be over with the cream cheese and grated cheese. so after we&nbsp;stoped by the free samples of cookies and got some crackers we went to the place where we thought there was cheese. well as we stand there looking at the&nbsp;cheese for&nbsp; about 5 minutes we decided it just wasnt there. so as miree is raising her hand looking around like an idiot i look for someone who works at krogers.&nbsp;I see this man stocking theshelves&nbsp;and we go over&nbsp;there.&nbsp; and miree asks where the alloutte is, the man first stands there like he is thinking then he asks if we looked in the cheese&nbsp;deli miree and i looked at each&nbsp;other&nbsp;because we didnt know&nbsp;there was a cheese deli. as we follow the guy around to the other side of the store&nbsp;we stop at like an oval stand thing that held a bunch of different cheese spreads and we just look at the one side for a while then we walk around and find our alloutte!!!! we were so excited!&nbsp;i guess you might of had to be there to understand our excitment!&nbsp;

      hey i took this from miree (thanks) Girl PoemA poem for us.... I shave my legs, I sit down to pee. And I can justify any shopping spree. &nbsp; Don't go to a barber, but a beauty salon. I can get a massage without a hard-on. I can balance the checkbook, I can pump my own gas. Can talk to my friends, about the size of my ass. My beauty's a masterpiece, and yes, it takes long. At least I can admit, to others when I'm wrong. &nbsp; I don't drive in circles, at any cost. And I don't have a problem, admitting I'm lost. &nbsp; I never forget, an important date. You just got to deal with it, I'm usually late. &nbsp; I don't watch movies, with lots of gore. Don't need instant replay, to remember the score. &nbsp; I won't lose my hair, I don't get jock itch. And just cause I'm assertive, Don't call me a bitch. Don't say to your friends, Oh yeah, I can get her. In your dreams, my dear, I can do better! &nbsp; Flowers are okay, But jewelry's best. Look at me you idiot... Not at my chest!!!! I don't have a problem, With Expressing my feelings. I know when you're lying, You look at the ceiling. &nbsp; DON'T call me a GIRL , a BABE or a CHICK .. I am a WOMAN. Get it?, you DICK!?! &nbsp; hehehe this is cute!!! &nbsp;

      So caroline calls me and is like do you want to go out to lunch with gary and i and then go to the mall?? and i'm like idk i have to ask. my mom says yes and so we go and we stop at mc donalds. i get a number 12 (crispy chicken sandwich) it was pretty good! guess what with my fries instead of BBQ suace i had ketchup! i never eat ketchup! but i did! it wasnt that horrible, i still prefer BBQ or ranch. anywayz so we get to the mall and caroline doesnt want to go into abercrombie for her interview cuz we were like 10 minutes early, so we walk past it then we walk back! it was funny! but gary and i went around the mall we went into a few stores and when we passed by dry ice he is like caroline alwayz makes me go in there! anywayz so caroline calls us cuz she is done and we meet up with her and we decided to go around the mall with her. so as we pass by dry ice she goes "oh lets go in there" it was so funny cuz gary gave me a look like " i told you so" it was funny!!!  oh so i'm like lets go to bath and body works and gary is like ok  and the people who work there alwayz come up to you sometimes its scary! but she was like would you like to try a lotion and i'm like sure and she looks at gary and asks him if he wants to try some too! he is like no but we convince him too. i dont think he liked it very much! lol  anywayz so we are on the way home and devin calls and so we go over there it has been forever since i have seen her, nicole was there too! we had fun we just sat around and talked and watched tv!  Tomorrow is the first day of school!!

      To love is to rish not being loved in return. To hope is to risk disappointment. But risks must be taken because the greatest risk in life is to risk nothing. The person who risks nothing, does nothing, sees nothing, has nothing and is nothing. He cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love and live.

      i dont see why people insist on butting in to other peoples buisness. ok its one thing to do it behind their back and its another thing to do it to their face! if you want to say stuff behind my back fine go ahead i dont give a crap, but be damn sure i dont find out, and when i do find out, and confront you about it, have enough balls to say what u think to my face.

      camp wasnt all that bad just kinda boring i wish amy would keep track of the instructions! it would help me out alot.  but i do have good news!!!! Hossler is gonna be public affairs with me! actually she is above me but it will be fun!!! and i dont think she likes amy either! but i still have no clue if i'm an officer or an NCO. i kinda want to be an officer but if i dont get it i dont think i would care that much cuz i love taking pictures and i would rather take pictures than be an officer!!!  Oh and Jared's flight won the drill comp!!!!! Congrats Jared!!!  oh and miree is not the only person who reads this!! Jared does too, he just doesnt write comments!!!  please write me some comments baby, i dont care what they say just write me one! and that goes for everybody else too,if there is anybody else!!!

      hummm camp today wasnt all that bad. It had its ups and downs. first of all I was not in a very good mood today, but so lumpkin was talking and she just made me mad i dont think it was what she was saying it was how she said it i guess, anywayz so she was talking to us while we were at attention and she put her hand on my shoulder. normally i wouldnt have cared, but for some reason it pissed me off.  so very nicely and calmly i brought up my left hand with my water bottle and just pushed her hand off, i didnt say a word, and i didnt break bearing!! i dont even know why i did it!!! i dont think she liked that!  oh and during the warm-up while i was taking pictures a sign came up and said "not enough available space" so i went and put it away cuz i would deal with it later. so as i was putting it away i remembered how it only had about 20 mins. left so i took it back out and plugged it in. so i went outside and did drill  then right before sports i ran inside to get the camera and it wasnt in the box!! i was freaking out! i looked all in the logistics room and i started to cry i was like "OMG i lost the camera, chris is gonna kill me." so i walk outside and Kayla's flight is re filling their water and i go up to kayla and i'm like " umm kayla have you seen the camera" her eyes get real big and she is like " you lost it" and i'm like i " might have misplaced it" then she was like go ask chris somebody might have used it. so i double time it over to the volleyball net and chris is giving instructions so i wait, then he comes down off the ladder and is like what and i'm like " umm Jordan i dont know where the camera is" he starts screaming " what? where is the camera" it was horrible cuz then amy heard him and is like "you lost the camera"  so chris  starts just going over with me where it might be, and then i am like "oh i know where it is i plugged it in to recharge it!" chris was like go and get it! I thought he was pissed. it was a simple mistake anybody could have done the same thing!

      i'm scared! i love the untit so much i would do almost anything for it! hey i put up with a year of hell for it because Chris wouldnt let me quit, and now people use that against me. but i'm mostly scared for kayla. I dont want what happened to megan beasly to happen to her. she is my best friend and i could not stand by and let people hold meetings about her i would have to say something. I think one of the problems is that chris, col, and kayla all have the same personalities are too similiar. they all know what they want and will do anything to get it, and you cant change any one of their minds for anything! but dont get me wrong i love them all, but if you put them all in a room they would kill each other!!! I just think that kayla works hard and she might not be the easyist person to work with but neither is chris or col. Chris if you read this you know how rotc is, you hear things i just dont want people to think that kayla did something wrong by not going to SLS. Her little sister was being born for christs sake. and i heard her tell MSgt and col that she didnt want to go because sarah was being born then.  so i dont think they or anybody else should be mad at her for not going. so if later in the year something comes up with her i think that so far she has done an outstanding job and should not have to deal with little meeting that people have to talk about her i think it is wrong and i stand by every choice she has made, it may not have been the best sometimes, but this is JROTC we are here where we can afford to make mistakes, and we learn from them, so i hope that people will realize that we all make mistakes.
