      Today at lunch I found an ENORMOUS, black, hairy spider in my little oh-so Japanese toilet room. I am still a bit shaky from it. Animals I can handle; large insects I am less okay with. At least I have yet to see a mukade (large centipede type things, incredibly ugly, that can get up to about 10cm, apparently). Ahhhhh! The typhoon is supposed to hit tomorrow. So much for a day outside to discover my village...

      It is still really hot and sticky but a little cooler than yesterday so I guess a bit more bearable. Thank goodness for air conditioning in the office (I am not yet in my official apartment, so only have a fan until next Wednesday). I went swimming again last night and tried to convince myself to go for a walk but all I could think to do was sit and read. Tonight I will be more productive, I have promised myself. I feel like I am finally mostly rested, and I am anxious to see more of Ikegawa. I have a bank account now, which is exciting, I guess. I have not yet registered as an alien (laugh all you want, but we all have to do it!) but that will come next week. I am going to start looking for a car, which is weird, but oh well. It comes so highly recommended that it only makes sense&nbsp;to me at this point. I also don't have a bike yet, and will have to find one at some point but I am not sure how I will go about doing that as I need to get it in Kochi city. We shall see, I guess. At any rate, thanks for the emails and posted comments. You guys ROCK!!

      I feel like I have so much to say right now it is disgusting... I will keep it brief though. First of all, I just found the apostrophe, which I am very excited about. ''''''' - yeah!! (Small pleasures, hey?) Secondly, my postal code is 781-1606 so add that to the address you may have written down. And finally, it is 37 degrees today, before humidity. It is gross. I have been walking around with a fan and still sweating like a fiend!! Okay, that's it, that's all for today. Big enormously giant long distance hugs from me to you all.

      So said the tshirt of one of the kids I was doing taiko drumming with this morning at the elementary school. Today is my first full day in Ikegawa Town, though how they call it a town is far beyond me. I was woken at sunrise (literally) by a crowing rooster, followed at 6am by the town chime. Oh yes, welcome to rural Japan! The view from my home is stunning: mountains on all sides, but not hard, grey mountains; these are&nbsp;lush and green, mostly evergreens, but the forest area behind the elementary school is enormous bamboo trees as far as the eye can see. My apartment is a good size, not sure yet how many tatami mats, but I will let you know when I count them. The staff is all very friendly and between them speak about 10 words of English, so once Dara (the current ALT) leaves on Wednesday, I will be left to fend for myself. I am certain we will figure it out. We had a few days in Tokyo for orientation, and it was quite helpful in many ways. Lots of seminars... I roomed with a really nice girl from Montreal, Emilie, who reminded me soooo much of Marie from my Katimavik group. Tokyo is ENORMOUS like nothing I have ever seen before. I didn:t go out and about very much because I was suffering fairly extensively from the JET lag, but will make a point of checking things out at a later time when I am hopefully more human feeling. I cannot access my yahoo right now, which is more than a little bit frustrating; it seems to be something&nbsp;about the server, so I will not be reading any email until it gets sorted out. For now, this will have to do. Some highlights of my time in Japan so far: the toilets in the Keio Plaza hotel, which offered cold or warm bidet with thin or thick spray, as well as some heated seats (!!)... The cab ride to the Canadian Embassy on our last night, when I got to see a good portion of the area for the first time (followed by Moosehead!)... Our plane ride from Tokyo to Kochi, when we flew right beside Mt Fuji!!!... Going into my first Japanese mall, and eating Italian food because they didn`t know what to feed&nbsp;me, as a vegetarian... The drive to Ikegaw, through the mountains... Swimming (and cliff jumping)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the crystal clear river last night with Dara to cool down from the horrifically oppressive humidity... And then this morning, honestly, meeting some of the kids and sitting on the floor drumming with them was one of my favourite moments ever, quite possibly. I cannot believe I am actually here.

      Tonight I will be taking off for my last couple of days in Canada. I get to spend them in Ottawa with Luke, Tasha, Robin, Isapoo and Marc, which sounds like a pretty nice "see ya later" time. I have been having a wonderful time in Lindsay, with all sorts of truly wonderful visits (thank you Andrea, Kristy, Amy, Erin, Kate, Joe, Graham, Shelly and Sue, and especially Mom and Dad) and good reading (LOVE the Davinci&nbsp; Code!) and packing and errands. I am really nervous today, kinda nauseaus, but it's all good and I think once I get on that plane I will be feeling a million times better. The countdown is on...

      Only 5 days until I go, and as I stress about everything from what presents to take, to the fact that there is going to be some strange man in his underwear in my apartment for the first week or so (aaaaahhhh!!), my Isapoo was good enough to create this little sight for me so that I can share my Japanese experience with my friends without harrassing you all every second day with long rants about the toilet I have to crouch over and the chopsticks that I can't eat with! Thank you, Isabelle, you are fabulous!

      I got back from orientation in Kochi City all of about an hour ago (not even) and already Fumi (who I am buying my car from) came over, took my Hanko (name stamp) and put what has become my signature in all the right places to make the car mine... Once I pay, that is...  Orientation was awesome. We got heaps of helpful information from 2nd and 3rd year ALTs who know what we are going through, we got to commiserate with one another about the things we are experiencing, and we got to go out on the town for a rousing good time both nights. It was fabulous, and the people around my prefecture are really nice and really fun!! Today I am chotto (a little) hungover and very definitely exhausted, but it is all good because I got to do karaoke last night! (I also have a number of large, rather painful bruises all over my body because I was dancing on a table and fell off it. And broke it. Shhhhhh...) Very fun. I also made friends with a bunch of guys who were breakdancing in Obiyamachi (a covered pedestrian mall) on our walk home from the bar and I was trying to get them to teach me some moves. Those poor boys, they were probably thinking 'why won't this crazy gaijin just leave us alone?!' Ah well...  Anyway, the computer I am on sucks and keeps moving the cursor on me, which is extremely irritating, so I am going to cut it short for today and maybe do some reading since they gave us about 400 pages of information.

      I am leaving shortly to spend 3 days in Kochi City doing an orientation with the other JETs in my area, so I wanted to get a quick post on here before I forget everything that happened this weekend (like that would be possible)...  Saturday's festival didn't really start to feel like a festival until the dancing later in the afternoon. In the morning, Peter and I wandered around and tried to find the kids catching fish with their hands (no luck), we watched some of the log haul (teams pull a log down the river) but that got a bit tedious, we tried the earthquake simulator (yeah... interesting...) but eventually just went back and sat in air conditioning for a little while because it was insanely hot outside and I was a bit stressed about dancing in front of my entire village. Ohhhhhhhh... Little did I understand what I was getting myself into!  I met up with the rest of my group, attired in our 'hoppi' (pronounced like happy!) and we walked to the very far end of the village along with the other 4 (I think) groups participating. On the way there I walked with a couple of Vietnamese guys who work in construction here, and a few of the local guys (most of the people in my group were around my age), and the first question they managed to get out in English was if Peter was my boyfriend. And so it began... I think I had to answer that one about 40 times in the space of the weekend!! Luckily I had learned the word for friend (tomodachi) so I think I was pretty clear in my communication. Anyway, it was a fun walk and we muddled our way through a bit of a conversation. And then we started dancing. And we danced all the way down to the centre and up to the elementary school, which was the heart of the festivities. That part took about 30 minutes. Keep in mind that when we practiced the most times we did it in a row was two!! Along the way some people had little tables set up with beer for us to chug back as we went. They really have their priorities straight - hydration vs numbing the pain of dancing for far too long... Hmmmmm, which shall I choose?? Peter had my digital camera near the elementary school, and I promise when I get back at the end of the week I am going to take some time and get some photos up on the web. I promise!!! We had a brief rest and then started out again. This time we went aaaaaaaallllll around the other side of the village, up one road and down the other, and I really truly thought I was going to die. When all was said and done, we had been dancing for about two hours. TWO HOURS! I think this is what it would be like to try to run a marathon without having trained for it!! My friend Chris from the next town showed up about halfway through, so that was cool. Now the thing about this whole dance experience (which, despite my complaining, was really fun and satisfying and just kind of amazing in general) is that as the new ALT, people in the village are pretty interested in me. It was nice to have so many people smiling big smiles at the crazy foreigner trying to do the Japanese dancing, and having them wave their fans at me to cool off my disturbingly bright red face. However. I have never ever ever ever in my entire life had so many photos taken of me!! I swear I had my own personal photographer for a good part of the dancing who always seemed to be right beside me snapping shots of the sweat running down my face (so attractive), plus Peter had my camera, Chris had his keitai (phone - they all take photos and videos), and random strangers along the street would run up to get a picture of me as well. I was hideous, but I had to keep smiling away not just so that they would all think that I am a nice happy person and be excited to welcome me to their community but also because I don't want half my village to have pictures where I look like I am about to vomit!!! Anyway... it was incredible and fun and I am really glad that I did it. Yeah Yosakoi odori (dance)!  I got to see my kids do their taiko drumming and I felt like a proud mother. They were fabulous and insanely cute. I took video and pictures and I am so excited for you to see them!!! We watched some Shinto dancing, I headed home to take a shower, my friend Amanda showed up,  we watched the fireworks (they go all out - it was a better display than Ottawa does on Canada Day, and my village is only 2342 people!!), and then we went back for some more Shinto dancing. It was really fascinating and it was clear they were telling a story about the struggle between good and evil. Lots of my kids were running around in their yukata (summer Kimono) so I got some pictures of them as well. We had a beer, I chatted with some of the girls from my dance group, and then one of the guys from the group came over, drunk as drunk can be, and he invited us to go to the after-party. His invitation was something like this: 'Shall we drink?' So we wandered all over Ikegawa (it felt like) and finally found the party where a large part of the dance group was hanging out in a tatami room with beer and snacks. It was pretty fun; lots of laughter as we tried to communicate. I am trying to make a solid effort to make friends here because they seem really sweet and I have fun with them once we actually start talking, and I think it will really help my Japanese as well. It is a bit scary though, because they don't talk to me until I go up and speak to them, and then they are totally excited. It is hard for me to walk up alone to a group of people I don't really know and can't really understand, though. I guess I just have to suck it up.  On Sunday Chris used his new car (a very large station wagon, especially by Japanese standards) to take us on a roadtrip to Irino Beach, a fairly popular surfing area in the west, and we frollicked in the ocean and I disturbed a crab in the sand who got quite upset with me and ran away. It was a beautiful drive, and the water there is very warm - some sort of ocean temperature anomaly in this area, which is lovely for those of us who want to enjoy a swim in it. By the time I got home I was beyond exhausted, but really satisfied. What a fabulously perfect weekend. It will be hard to beat that one, I suspect.  I will update again at the end of the week and there will be photos to view. So much for the 'quick' post, eh??

      I just had the pleasure of participating in a Japanese tea ceremony (sedo) with a few women in my office. It was wonderful... so precise and thoughtful, every step. As much as sometimes it is hard to be all by myself up here, I am certainly exposed to a number of things that people in the city might not get to experience, and for that I am truly grateful. (About my feet though, I sat in seiza properly for about half an hour during the ceremony and I really have never had them get quite so thoroughly numb before. It was a little bit scary!)  One of the women doing the ceremony approached me just after lunch and as far as I could understand she was asking me if I would help her learn English, which of course I am more than willing to do. I am going to try to work out an arrangement, though, if this is the case, where I teach her English and she teaches me the ceremony. I will have to wait and see if I actually understood her correctly, but I will certainly keep you all posted. (Although perhaps I should try something that isn't quite so delicate... I'm likely to trip on something and spill tea all over anyone I try to serve!!)  Have a wonderful weekend, let me know if anything exciting happens with the Olympics, and frollick like children of the night!!

      I just have to share this because it made me really happy. Today was the first day when a lot of the kids really came over and sat with me, crawled on me, and basically seemed to  like  me as opposed to just being kind of in awe of the fact that I am not Japanese. It was awesome. There is one little girl who has been fairly forward all along, who I just adore. She is about 8 or 9 years old, I think, and I feel like we really communicate! It is too hard to explain, but it makes me happy. And their drumming sounds awesome. I am so excited to see them all in uniform tomorrow!!  The flowers that I spent all those hours making are now adorning a platform in front of the elementary school, and they look beautiful. My blood, sweat and tears paid off...

      Tasha is pregnant. Real honest-to-goodness, getting big and round, having a baby pregnant. I knew it would happen while I was away, but I was really hopeful it would take a bit longer so there might be a chance I would get to experience some of it, but no such luck. I am happy for her (them - I suppose Paul plays  some  role in this as well...) because they are so happy, but I am sad for myself that I am going to miss it all. Isn't that horrid and selfish?? She is not the first of my friends to be having a baby, but she is my closest friend to go through this next step in life, and it floors me because I feel so far away from marriage and baby-having.

      Oh ye who wrote the funny comment to my last post... Using the world whilst really takes a certain talent, and that was very well done.  I got drunk last night for the first time since arriving in Japan and today I really do not feel well. At all. I think it was the horrible wine I found in my cupboard... Or maybe the fact that it followed a couple of beers. At any rate, I would like to crawl in a hole and die right now. And Marc, much as I love you, 5:50am is a tad early to call me. It's a good thing you're pretty...  Just for the record, I was neither drinking alone nor making my first foray into Japanese enkai. My friend Peter (who lives in Kochi city) came to visit, so we went swimming, I went to dance practice, and then came the beer. Can I go home yet??? (No, because it is only 9:00am... Dammit Janet!)  Saturday is going to be a long day of festival-ing - as far as I can tell by the miming and dictionary translations I got this morning, they have a competition for catching fish by hand followed by a duck race, an earthquake experience (I'll let you know about that one...), tree hauling in the river, the Yosakoi dancing (that's me!), taiko drumming, the traditional year of plenty dance (which I learned at the community centre), fireworks and lastly Shinto music and dancing. It should be quite the day!!!  Okay,  now  can I go home??

      My car is Mitsubishi, not Honda. I must have made that up.  I also lied about the grocery store... On closer inspection I found potatoes, CUCUMBER (which made me really happy) and eggplant. Not bad, I guess...  That's about it for today. Next Monday to Wednesday I have orientation in Kochi, which I am looking forward to because it gives me a couple of days to hang out with other ALTs in my area and get to know some of them a little bit better.  For those who are concerned (I've had a few question) I am quite a distance from the landslide that seems to be getting a lot of attention at home but very little here for some reason. I didn't even know about it.

      Some of you will find this funnier than others...  Kawaii means pretty. It was one of the earlier words that I learned (thank you Amy), it being, in my vocabulary at least, an important one. The funny thing is, for those who know me even reasonably well, is that people keep saying that I am a pretty girl, which invariably makes me laugh due to my 'habit' of telling everyone just how pretty I am!!! (And of course, you know that I'm kidding when I say it, but I suspect that if I start running around Japan telling everyone 'watashi wa kawaii' I might get even more funny looks than I do at home!) And truly, I think I keep getting the comments about being pretty simply because the last ALT they had was a tall, skinny, dark guy from Los Angeles.  Anyhoo, that just occurred to me because when I went to buy my car just now (oh yes!! car car car!!) the women at the garage were talking about me being pretty. It is just so funny to me!  So car... It is a Honda Minica, and as the name implies, it is tiny and cute and wonderful. It is sparkly silver-ish, and they are going to put a cd player in it for me. I don't get it until the end of the month because that is when I get paid and they want me to pay all at once, but it's all good because the next few weeks are going to fly by anyway, I suspect. I never in a million years thought that the first car I would ever own would be in Japan!! And although it is a bit more expensive than I was hoping, it is still a great price, plus it's automatic so I don't have the added problem of learning standard while I try to navigate on the opposite side of the road, opposite side of the car (notice I said 'opposite' rather than 'wrong' - I have been making an effort not to be so Canada-centric, difficult as that is sometimes).  Okay, that's all.

      Is it just me, or does that sound really dirty to anyone else?? If only it were a t-shirt rather than a billboard, I might have to get myself one!! Ha ha!  Last night was wonderful and at moments a bit like a dream. I really wanted to go to Kochi city  for their giant Yosakoi (dancing) festival, but my friend Amanda (friend from nearby Nyodo) decided she wasn't up for it, and I wasn't prepared for my first attempt at the bus to be when I had to get back for work, so I resigned myself to the fact that I would not be attending. At the end of the work day, Miki-sensei (who took me to Kochi my first Sunday) asked if I wanted to go with her. I was delighted! Even more joy came in the form of a vibrant purple kimono in which she dressed me, and a beautiful blue one that attired Miki as we made our way to the festival. Guys, I felt so pretty, it was unreal, without even looking in the mirror. It is just that image of the beautiful, delicate Japanese woman in kimono, I guess. (And then I looked in the mirror and it was still me...) I felt like a princess, though. I can't wait to get my camera sorted out even more now so that I can show you!! It was like being Lady Jane, but better because I am in Japan!! (That was one of those moments when I said to myself, 'oh yes, you are definitely here') I do have to mention, however, that they pull the belt thing really tight, and I had a bit of trouble breathing at first, but got that sorted out soon enough.  The dancing was incredible. I don't know how they did the whole route (it was basically a parade through the downtown pedestrian mall) without passing out from heat and exhaustion. The costumes were bright and beautiful, and the music was fun. I took some video, lots of pictures, and just sat there in awe of it all. I felt really really blessed to be having such a wonderful opportunity, and I realized how taken care of I feel in this community. Miki is absolutely a goddess-send, my supervisor is always concerned that I am doing okay, and people are continually introducing themselves to me on the street. I had one woman the other day drive by, then pull over and come to meet me. She had been told about my by Dara, and she said she wanted to be my friend because she knew it would be lonely at first, so I could come to her house for dinner and have a friend. Her name is Fumi, and she is lovely. Sometimes it makes me a little teary how kind people are to me, and I hope that I am able to repay them in some way.  Yesterday I met a couple of the elementary school teachers and got a tour of the school itself. The classes are tiny, the smallest one only 7 students, and the biggest one (grade 6) is 20, so it will be very personal and fun, I think. (Thank you for the games/songs/etc those who sent them already!) The teachers are super-nice, and seemed really excited about how excited I am to be coming into the school. Yeah!!!  Last night I found mukade #2 in my house (argh!!) and got a picture, so I can share the little assface (that was for you, Christina and Marc) with all of you as well. Tonight I have yosakoi dance practice again. Things are good. Bless....

       Umbrellas:  -Everyone owns a few, not just one, and if you happen to forget yours at home and you get caught in rain, you look outside any business (because they all have umbrella stands) and look for the least-used, probably deserted one, and take it. This, apparently, is umbrella etiquette in Japan. -Even the cheapest ones ($4 or $5) are better quality than more expensive ones in Canada, probably because they need to withstand friggin' TAIFUS!!   Driving:  -The roads, for the most part, are very narrow and very winding (thereby testing my motion sickness), and at sharper curves there is a mirror so you can see around it and check if anyone is coming. Stressful, yes, but with speed limits that vary between about 40 and 60km an hour, and drivers who - for the most part - obey them, it is less scary than it would be in, say Ontario, where you always go 20km  over  the limit. -When you encounter another vehicle on one of the above mentioned roads, one of you will backtrack until you get to a space where you can pull over and allow the other to pass, and this is such a commonplace occurrence that they don't even usually acknowledge one another with a polite little 'thank you' wave!   Groceries:  -I paid over $3 for 3 tomatoes. And they are NOT that big. -The only vegetables that I recognize in my grocery store are tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and green peppers (which are tiny). My stirfry is a little lacking, needless to say.

      Or at least a dancing gaijin (foreigner)!! Remember how I said last week something about going to dance with a bunch of young men with Miki-sensei?? Well I went last night. It was a practice. To dance at the festival on the weekend. I did not really understand what I was getting roped into when she asked me, and I am still not sure I am comfortable with doing it, but it seems I have little choice. It is a very small group of people around my age, and we are doing what is called Yosakoi dancing, which is very pretty and involves clacking wooden things. They all look so graceful and natural doing it. I am such a clod!! I will suck it up, though, and go off to practice every night this week (and sweat like I have never sweat before - it is on the second floor of the elementary school gym and it is hotter than hot in there!!), and pray to every god and goddess there is that I don't look like a complete fool when we dance our way through the streets of Ikegawa. And, just because I am not ashamed of the fact that I am a dork, using the video function on my sassie new camera, I will record my dancing for posterity and share it with you once I figure out how to move things from camera to internet. (Any hints would be appreciated - somehow the Japanese manual is less helpful than I would like!! Ha ha!)  Today my supervisor, the Deputy Superintendent of the Board of Ed and another one of the men in my office came to my house, rolled up their sleeves and rid the outside of my apartment of the junk my predecessor had left behind. They take such responsibility, it is really nice in some ways, but for someone like me who is quite used to just doing things on my own, it is a bit hard to accustom to. I know they mean well, but I feel bad sitting there watching while the 'men' do the dirty work. And I was warned about this before, but one of the women in the office brings everyone tea a couple times a day. Again, it's nice, but not something I am used to. I guess I really am in Japan, aren't I?! (And not just sitting in my parents' backyard in Lindsay like Tasha likes to think!!)

      do Japanese insects love me soooo very much?! (WARNING: if you are truly faint of heart about bugs, you may want to skip the next paragraph... honestly.)  I think I said before that I can handle the small creatures, like salamanders and my overly large toad, but I have a harder time with shockingly large insects, like the spider I found in my house on one of my first days. Well, it got worse on Saturday night. I had the nicest day in Kochi city with the ALTs I am going to be doing the English Camp with, and we met up with some other JET participants briefly before heading back to the mountains and our respective homes. I arrived home a bit after 11pm. I brought in my towel from where it had been drying outside. I looked down at the floor... And there sat a mukade, probably having hitched a ride inside on said towel. ARGH!! It makes me shiver to even think about it!! I am pretty sure I described it before - a very large, very ugly, poisonous, centipede-like creature, which you are to do your very best to avoid. It was awful, and the closest I have come to crying since arriving in Japan. The worst thing about them is that as you're freaking out, you have to be inventive about how to kill the invading beast because they are tough as nails. I held mine down with my shoe, which barely even registered to the little fighter, and to get it out of my house I used a nearby clothespin and squished its head. Cruel, yes, but I have become a lot more militant in how I treat the bugs who choose to invade my home since arriving here. I try to be nice, but sometimes they just have to be dealt with. So I have been traumatized ever since and can't sleep because I am constantly thinking that there is another one of those horrible creatures in my house, in my bed, crawling up my leg, etc. I am exhausted, and desperately hoping that once the memory of Saturday night is a little less vivid I will be able to get on with my life...  Good news, though!! I got a digital camera on the weekend, so as soon as I figure out how to get pictures from the camera onto the internet, I will let you know so you can see where I am (I went on a little walking tour yesterday and got some nice shots of Ikegawa). The only thing is, it might take me a little bit of time as the manual is in Japanese and I am not very electronics-savvy. I have managed to fumble my way into figuring out bits of the camera itself, but the software it came with is also in Japanese. I think I can download English though, so I will see what I can do. The best part about my new handy dandy little camera?? It's PINK! And I didn't even actively seek it out. The one I was looking at was grey, but they only had pink and blue ones left. YIPPEE! I am one excited little  gaijin !  Other... can't access my yahoo again - what a pain in the butt! I decorated my house a bit, framed some pictures on the weekend so it feels a bit more at home and I get to look at the smiling faces of friends and family, which is always nice. The English camp is going to be a fun time, I think. I really like the group of ALTs I am working with, and it is at what is called Awaga (town) Skypark, and we get to go paragliding and mountain-boarding, weather permitting... Cross your fingers for no rain for me, okay?! Otherwise we have to entertain 27 adolescents in a fairly small gym for about 3 hours, which could prove a challenge.  All in all, I feel pretty good (apparently I have been giving details about life but not saying how I am doing, particularly). I have moments where I honestly wonder what the hell I am doing here, like when I can't understand what they are telling me and I suspect it is important. Or when I know people are talking about me right in front of me because they know the only thing I will understand is... well, pretty much nothing. My Japanese  is  improving slowly, though. I am working on expanding my vocabulary and although I wish I could make progress faster than I am, it is better than nothing. I like my apartment, it is small and cozy, and now that I have had a bit of time to make it my own, it feels like home. I love how pretty Ikegawa is. When we were in Kochi City, it was awesome to be able to socialize and that everything you could need or want was available, but I felt really lucky to be able to leave and come back up here, where the air is clean, the people are really nice, and everyone knows that I must be the new English teacher when they see me, because what else could I possibly be doing here?? So life is pretty good.  Let me know how you are doing, generally. I really like being kept up to date on the goings on at home, it makes me feel like I am not so very far away afterall... You know what I mean??  Have a glorious week. Laugh loud and hard. Meow at someone randomly.

      ...in a lot of small ways.  I spent most of my day out of the office with Miki-sensei. We went to a community centre where we were met by a large group of older women (some incredibly old looking, like you imagine a stereotypical wizened Japanese woman) attired in variously decorated aprons, and a few retired men. Most of them were sitting on the floor lined along low tables, and the women were all sitting seiza - for real. (Seiza is the traditional way for women to sit, on their knees with their feet tucked under them. It has relaxed so that you can sit with your knees to the side, but I suspect that for some of these women it is almost a sign of honour to sit properly.) We were there to make flower stalks in preparation for the matsuri (festival) in Ikegawa the weekend of the 14th. They were a lovely group of people, very interested to meet me, some of them going off in long stories about family they have in Canada, a visit they took to Vancouver, Victoria (mile one!), Banff and Niagara Falls... I guess those are the hot spots! It's funny, I just noticed yesterday, but it happens a lot, that although people know I don't speak or understand Japanese, for some reason they still think it is a good idea to talk to me for a long time, not slowly, not using hand gestures or any other sort of mime, just talking. I think that they have a hope (irrational, though it may be) that at some point I will miraculously just start to understand them. IF ONLY it were that easy!!!! It's endearing until it starts to become irritating, though I am doing my best to just be patient and enjoy everything I am presented with.  So these were the main events that made yesterday big: #1 - I made my first real Japanese faux-pas, at least that I am aware of. I sat cross-legged on the floor... Like I was ready to play duck duck goose, or something... In a  skirt . I realize this is frowned upon even at home, but anyone who knows me well is aware that although I frequently wear skirts and dresses, I am not the most conscientious person when it comes to propriety. I don't know how long I had been sitting like that, but one of the women subtley pointed it out and I immediately remedied the situation and paid a LOT more attention for the rest of the day. #2 - I  almost  tried octopus and shrimp, if you can believe it. I am making an effort to be as easy as I can with seafood. I have told them I won't eat beef, chicken or pork, but with seafood I will make concessions. And I keep thinking that I am ready to try actually eating some, rather than picking around it. I came close with the octopus when all I could see was a chunk of white, but then I picked it up and there was a suction cup and I was done. Ah well, maybe next time. #3 - The dancing, oh the dancing. After lunch many of the women got in a large circle and two of the men picked up microphones and one of them got a large drum out. The women danced for a 'year of plenty' and it was beautiful and graceful and ageless. I was almost in tears. They looked like they had been born doing these movements, and the two oldest, my favourites, often had their eyes closed a look of pure bliss on their faces. It ended, there was a rest, and then they got ready for another round. And I was pulled into the circle. Gone was the grace and beauty, marred by my awkward, uncoordinated attempts. I was embarassed, but they were so delighted with my attempts, big smiles and nods of their head, I couldn't keep feeling like an idiot and sort of basked in their attention for a few minutes. #4 - Apparently next week I will be joining Miki-sensei for dance class with a group of young men. Ummmm... this should be an adventure!!  So, despite the fact that the hanna (flower) making got tedious, they were some of the cutest, sweetest elderly people I have ever encountered, and I had a lot of fun while I was there. Maybe if I am lucky I will get to go back when I have a bit more skill in Japanese and can say more than my name and where I am from. And my age, of course. Everyone wants to know how old I am...  I have a meeting all day today for the English camp that Ikegawa and 3 nearby towns are having at the end of the month, and it will be nice to see some other ALTs and compare our first week and a half. I think there might be some social events on the weekend, which will be fun, so I will update on Monday. Have a fabu weekend.  Big love... I am missing home a bit today, so extra hugs to you all.

      Yippee! I am moved into my very first, very own apartment now!! Glory day! If you would care to give me a call (thereby making my day), here is my contact information:  address first - 944-1 Doiku Ikegawa-cho, Agawa-gun Kochi-ken 781-1606 JAPAN  phone - dial 1010710 before calling and it is only $1 for 20 minutes (yeah!) then dial: 011-81-889-34-2911 (we are 13 hours ahead of Ontario)  And there you have it, ladies and gents! I just had a moment of thinking that perhaps I shouldn't be advertising this all over the internet, but then I thought, who but my friends and family would bother reading all my long-winded ramblings anyway?!

      today was the first day I slept through the f***ing rooster and the town chime. Hurray! I was overjoyed, mostly because 5:30am is simply too early for me to start my day. The chime actually goes off 6am, 12pm, 5pm, and 9pm, each time playing a different melody, the final one being the ever popular 'Taps' - it reminds me of Sonja and highschool Remembrance Day ceremonies, except it's not a solo trumpet.  Dara left this afternoon, after spending three full years in Ikegawa. It was quite the send-off: everyone from this office (board of ed) and the town office went down to the van to see him off and waved as he was driven away. Tonight I will go home, to my  real  new home and unpack and do some cleaning. And maybe watch some tv. I would like to do laundry, but as it is STILL raining, that may not be the best idea. At least if I would like my clothes to be dry when I put them on for work tomorrow.  Now comes the real challenge of communication with my co-workers,  sans  Dara to translate. It should be an interesting endeavour, to say the least.

      Yet another brilliant Japanese t-shirt. Gotta love 'em!  Taiko drumming practice is a great introduction to the kids here. I am meeting them slowly, and I am actually beginning to remember some names and attach them to the correct faces! Hurrah! It is incredible, though, how independent and well behaved these kids are. By the time we arrive, they have taken the drums out of the storage room and set them up, and they've usually already begun practice. The don't talk to their neighbour if another row of drummers is being addressed, and when it ends they all run to deposit their sticks in their bags then come back to put everything away in its place. No one but the one tiny kindergarten boy sits and watches, and even he helps while there are still things small enough for him to carry. Once this is done, they gather in front of Miki-sensei, do their cheer, and then one of the older girls picks up the cooler with their snack and takes it out to the hall where they wait their turn quietly and eat/drink neatly. At the end of the Friday practice, before snack, they clean the gym: some kids close and lock all the windows, top and bottom, some sweep, and some hold the dust pans. Honestly, it just blows me away!!  I don't know if I have explained that I am not actually in school until September 1. Between now and then I spend the majority of my time in the Board of Ed office, wondering what in the world I should be doing. I spend a lot of time on the internet (if you hadn't guessed), but what I should probably be doing more of is studying Japanese. You know, when I left Belair I was sooooooo excited to not speak French anymore. Not because I don't like the language, but because it was so frustrating for me to try to explain insurance to an angry French person speaking 4000 miles a minute. I mean, it could be hard enough in English, but this, well... It was awful sometimes!! However, now that I am in Japan, when I am searching for a word or phrase I find it coming to me in French and WISHING with all my might that I had even a fraction of the skills in Japanese that I have in French. How much our perspective can change in such a short while...  I wonder if part of the reason I have sooooooooooo much to say once I start typing is because I spend so much of my day in silence??

      Translation: more rain!!!  It cleared up and got sunny and warm for the better part of yesterday, and naturally I was thrilled because this meant - joy of joys - that my towel would be dry! (Like I have said before, it is those small pleasures that make all the difference in the world...) It was awesome to feel that vitamin D on my forehead, and I totally felt refreshed. Dara and I braved the stream, much higher, with a much stronger current than pre-taifu, and it was a bit of a shock - my previously gently flowing, comfortably warm swimming hole had turned into a glacially cold torrent!! Okay, so it was actually pretty nice and I got a bit of a workout by moving just far enough into the current that I could swim against it without going anywhere. And then I got distracted by a large stick floating by (keep your comments to yourselves!) and drifted a bit before I realized I had started moving!! It was a little mini-adventure!!  I decided to take advantage of the warm-but-not-oppressively-so afternoon and went for a walk up the longest, mossiest staircase I have ever encountered to check out the town shrine. The stairs go through a lovely forest (mostly bamboo), past a fabulous little house with black-eyed susans growing almost as tall as I am, and through 3 traditional looking entranceways, each with 3 bundles of some sort of grass, or maybe it is rice plants, I couldn't tell, hanging from the middle. At the final entrance there are pieces of paper tied to plants on either side where people can write their prayers (I was not prepared, but will do so next time), and a fountain where you can wet your mouth (though my understanding is that you are not supposed to swallow the water from it). The building itself is quite simple, with some slightly tattered cloth hangings, a plain wooden floor with a section in the middle of what looks like double-thick tatami mats, and above that section are the most intricate paper cutouts I have ever seen. They are like snowflakes, but full rectangular pieces of white paper with traditional Japanese scenes cut out. They are beautiful and like nothing I have ever encountered. I was in total awe.  I sat quietly for a little while, but the bugs were starting to get really bad so I did eventually have to venture back to my little apartment. It was such a lovely way to spend the first part of my evening, though, and I expect I will take the walk up there fairly often. (And then when I get home I will have BUNS OF STEEL!!)  Tonight I get to move into MY apartment, which is a mixed blessing because it means that Dara, my means of communicating with my coworkers, will be gone, but at the same time, I get to unpack and feel like I actually live somewhere. AND I will have a phone at my disposal whenever I choose to use it!! Yeah!! I think this move will take me many steps closer to feeling at home here. It is certainly not that I feel uncomfortable, but there is nothing like that sense of being 'settled' to let me start feeling more like myself.

      (I should say 'move' and 'life' but I just like what 'move life' implies, to me at least) How are those for some cool car names?? Most vehicles in Japan are significantly smaller than at home, even these little truck things they have. I do, however, occasionally see a North American sized SUV, and even after such a short time, they still shock me with how enormous they are!!  This morning I did something I was hoping I would put off for a long time. The Japanese have a habit of sucking air in through their teeth, often when they are thinking about something, giving it consideration, but at other times as well. I know it is simply a cultural thing I will have to get used to, but I sort of find it a bit insulting when they do it when we are talking. I will get over this, but it makes me feel like I am doing/asking for something wrong. And this morning I did it. I will make a conscious effort to not make it a habit, but I pick of the speech patterns of people around me so quickly that it might be unavoidable.  It is still raining, by the way. Not much, but it is definitely not going to be drying out just yet.  By the way, I just updated the time so it reflects what time it is here when I write. I know it won't make a big difference, but whatever.

      *The poor wimpy bamboo trees really took a beating in the taifu, and are all now very bent over. *In the grocery store: watermelon for approx. $15 and cantaloupe for approx. $10 - normal sized, too. I guess I won't be eating those fruit for the next year!! *100 yen stores are even better than dollar stores, and if you know my love of dollar stores you will realize this is no small feat!! *Who is Lady Penelope?? (I suspect either Jane or Sarah, but I'm definitely not sure.) *I gave my omiyage (gifts) this morning to Superintendent and deputy, my supervisor Mori, and my coworker Miki who took me out yesterday. Only Miki and Mori opened them, the others set them to the side of their desk, still wrapped, without so much as a second glance. After all the AGONIZING I did about what to bring... Ahhhh!!! *There is a toad the size of a kitten (literally) who lives in front of my house. It is sooooo cool!! *I have a name stamp (inkan/hanko) that says my name in Japanese. Anyone who gets mail from me in the next year will get to see it. I feel so fancy with my little stamp in its little case with its own little circle of ink inside!

      Nope, not some miraculous slime I have discovered in Japan, but rather the cd/dvd store in the next town. Apparently they meant 'good' - I like this better!!  It is still raining, 44 hours later. The harsh wind only lasted about 18 hours, but then last night was the craziest thunder and lightning storm I have ever experienced. I usually like summer storms, but I honestly felt like the mountains were going to fall on me!! I don't know how much water has fallen by now; yesterday at about 10am there had been 244mm, so add another 24 hours of liquid on top of that and, well... We're not flooded at least. The river I swam in so peacefully all last week is many feet higher and rushing quite dangerously, so I will have to find something else to do after work until it drops a bit again.  My weekend was really good. I had expected to spend most of it at home reading and wishing away the torrential rains, but instead I got to go into Kochi city both days. Saturday I went with Dara and we met a few of his friends for lunch. They were adorable!! One was really excited that I am her size, because although I am much closer to average size here, I am still smaller than most adults. Another was fascinated by my eyes (not brown) and eyelashes. It was pretty funny. I will go back to visit them once I feel a bit stronger grasp on my Japanese because I think they would be a lot of fun to hang out with. We did a bit of shopping and I gloried in the plethora of fun, cartoony, cutesy toys and paper and stickers, etc. I felt like it was a special little heaven created especially for me. I could spend millions on all the fun stuff here!!! That night I relaxed. I have already read a book and a half, so I am going to get through my supply awfully quickly. If anyone has any good books they think I should read, either let me know the name and I will try to find it on Amazon, or send it on through. Seamail is much cheaper, but takes about a month. (Speaking of mail, I got my first letter!! Thank you, Mom! And it only took 4 days to reach me. Yeah!!!) Sunday I had plans with Miki-sensei, from my office. Her English is very very limited, and my Japanese, well... let's not even talk about that! It was an adventure involving lots of hand gestures, use of our dictionaries, and exchanging vocabulary. She is really lovely, and took me to the Pacific Ocean (where I could look towards Canada, oh so far away), which was very angry after the *taifu* and where there is a large statue of Sakamoto Ryomo, who is a bit of a legend in these parts. Then we went for lunch at a seafood restaurant, and I thought I could do it, but ended up picking the scallops off my pasta. We then went to Kochi Castle, which is beautiful, and offers a wonderful view of Kochi city, which - by the way - is not very attractive, except for the fact that it is surrounded by these incredible tree covered mountains. We did some more shopping (soooooo much Kitty-san/Hello Kitty!!) and I did a very good job of resisting spending excessive amounts of money before I even get paid. I would like to buy both a bike and a car in the near future, so I should probably try to be a bit more responsible for the time being. Driving here  could  be really stressful, with the very very narrow, winding roads, but the speed limits are so low (50 or 60k) and people are so careful, that even in the crazy storm on our way home yesterday, I didn't find it particularly stressful.  Soooo... anyhoo, that is about it for the weekend. On Friday after work I discovered a bit more of Ikegawa-cho by taking a walk for about an hour (too hot to stay out for longer). It seems that every building along the road, which is most of the buildings in town, have some sort of business operating. I think a lot of it is more out of habit - stores being passed down through the family, etc - than any real expectation of making a sale. It was pretty interesting. And although the buildings themselves are not the most attractive, the area, and all the little nooks and crannies I could find are all just beautiful. I took a ton of pictures and will be excited to see how they turn out. OKAY! Blah blah blah blah... I know, I just go on and on, don't I?! But that's why I like having this site, because I can write down every little detail that occurs to me, and I don't have to harrass anyone with the emails, you can just read what you want. Really, I think it's the best of both worlds!  Love and hugs to you all, hope you had fabulous weekends! I will hopefully get internet set up in my apartment before too long and then can chat on messenger. I am also trying to get the phone thing sorted out. I will keep you posted.
