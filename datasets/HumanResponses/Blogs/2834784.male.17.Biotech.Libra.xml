      I am spent. Wasted. Man, those exams were crummy. Probably my worst ones this semester. Three straight major exams.    I'm obsessing again. That's how I am.    I can't stand it. My aura is reeking of failure. Sheesh. And I almost misspelled the stupid word too.    I have to go. My paragraphs are too short but what the hell. No one else ever reads them anyway. So off I'll go to wonderland to forget about everything for a while.    I wonder when I'll get back?

      So. This is the aftermath of two huge exams that made me feel restless all week. I thought I got done venting awhile ago at the arcade. Obviously I'm not. Which is why I'm here again in this dump (having successfully conditioned myself against a smell that I'm beginning to suspect contains traces of weed) delivering my piece.  My life is once again in an in-between state. I'm engulfed in a sea of unpleasantness that I have to cross. I can deal with the tests pretty well, though. I've been doing that since I don't know when. But it's the hordes of 'activities' I'm required to do that I find utterly distasteful.  Why have I been condemned by fate to take my KOM subjects in Filipino? Things would have been completely different otherwise.  I think there are still some things I've left unsaid but right now I really need to get back to studying for yet another test.  Another day, I guess.

      I hate the way this stupid place stinks. The smell permeates my clothing and lingers there hours after I leave. These morons just can't seem to stop smoking. Shame. It killed my 'creative writing mood'. I was about to dismiss the line of thought but the noise made my mindless game players hanging about is just terrible.    I can't do it. Not today. I'll talk freely later when I figure out how to overcome this wretched smell.

      Today I did something productive. I cleaned up my room. It wasn't really anything much. I could've done a whole lot more with my time but once again I didn't. But it's a start. I think I can finally break away from this lull I'm in.    On the other hand, I am starting to freak about the progressively more numerous responsibilities that are piling up on me. This is not an isolated occurrence. It's a nasty consequence of the vicious cycle I'm trying to break.    I didn't go to church today. I haven't since I left Davao. I don't see the point when I know I won't be sincere anyway. Also, I'm just too lazy to go and that's probably the only reason. It just makes me feel better to have a justification for my actions.    I am blowing all the long-term things I've decided to carry out and I hate it. I need to lay down a more definite plan for what I should be doing. Boundaries for what I will and won't allow myself to do. I will do it within this week. I think that wouldn't be asking too much of me.    Yup. A gradual change would be best. I'm already aware of how deep and potentially hopeless my situation is. But as long as I have the strength to occassionally keep my head above the water I'm still in the game. And I still have the hope of reaching land. I just hope I don't get myself drowned before I get there.

      Right now I'm not in as bad a mood as I used to be but I admit that there's still a lot about my life that's still messed up. I think I'm doing better though. I read a 'Japanese' novel and it was good and I'm waiting to read the second installment of the trilogy. I just got the result of a recent exam. Owing to bonus points I got over a hundred percent. And because of those things and the fact that I now have my allowance of the week I'm feeling slightly better. Funny. Exams have this huge impact on my mood. But I never work for them. Well, yes, I cram for them, but that doesn't count. And when I do well on them I get high and act like it was destined to happen. Like, 'of course I should have done well on that exam, there's no reason I shouldn't'. But when I don't I bum around and complain and feel depressed and I'm just sick of it happening again and again.    I have to unentangle myself from the results and ask myself whether I did my best or not. Because I have always said (or thought) that that is what counts more. Except that I have never really done my best ever so what is there to ask? And my actions clearly point the other way: I'm only interested in results, and so is everyone else.    Time to change.    For the better, I hope.

      Once again I'm beginning something I'm not quite sure I'll be able to end. I've had a lot of beginnings lately. And lots of endings. Most I'd rather not remember. Sitting in this stuffy, noisy, distinctly uncomfortable internet cafe, I can't help but think that I've never really lived a single day the right way in the seventeen years of my existence. How much can you accomplish in seventeen years, anyway? How much can you screw your life up? For the past few days what predominates my mind is the uncomfortableness of everything. I have this feeling in my gut that I'm not where I'm supposed to be, that I'm not doing what it is I'm supposed to do. I am in a rut, just like the countless ones I've been having ever since I can remember. What is it, really, that I'm supposed to do with my life and what is it that keeps me from finding out? I'm supposed to spend my time getting an education and I've learned a lot of things. But everything seems to be contradictory. And the only thing I'm sure of right now is how little I know of anything. I don't understand what makes me tick - why I keep doing the things I do.  I have so many things on my mind but I don't know what to start with. I think that I'm on the verge of a breakdown - and that I'll always be on the verge because that's how I always am - at the point of something but not quite getting there.  Religion - my faith. Do I even believe in anything now? Well I've lost faith in myself a long while ago and as for God - the best I can say is that I don't know. And right now that uncertainty is driving me crazy. And I am hoping that things change for the better and that my next blog will be a more optimistic one although I really don't know how that's going to happen right now. I am waiting for something that will most probably never come.

      People who smoke while walking along Taft Avenue are people I do not understand. The reason why they'd want to add to all the smoke that perennially coats the air and is continually replenished by passing vehicles is a complete mystery. I suppose they want to die sooner and maybe take others with them (second-hand smoke is, of course, more potent than smoking through a filter).  But really, I don't think I'm in any position to judge, because I do not understand myself either. A few hours from now I'm taking a killer Calculus test and I know absolutely nothing about the topics. I just got done taking a Midterm exam (for Kom), again without knowing anything, and through an incredible stroke of luck it went out all right. At least I'm pretty sure I didn't fail it. I don't think I'll be as lucky for Calculus though. Which is why I should stop wasting my time here and start studying. I might still make up for my total lack of knowledge with my two remaining hours of free time.  God help me.

      Recently I discovered that I have a grand total of six exams lined up for me for this week and the next. And that's okay. Because I'm not going to get myself caught in that cycle again. I'm not going to obsess over everything that doesn't really mean that much when you think about it. I mean, how is knowing how to get the derivative of a stupid function supposed to help me with living my life?  Besides, I have other things to do. Like practicing for an acoustic event this Thursday, and maybe another one the week after. I'm not playing any instrument, but I do pretty decent vocals (I think). Anyway, it's a no-brainer, really. Do I do something fun and expressive and meaningful, or something mentally and physically exhausting, not to mention totally pointless? It's not even a choice.

      Cigarette ads are proof that the majority of people lie to themselves more than they would like to think about. After promising everything from magically acquiring the best cars, clothes, and women to becoming a rugged cowboy, cigarette ads promptly conclude with the ironic statement, 'Government/Surgeon General's Warning: Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health'. Here we see the government coming up with the rationalization that 'We've done our moral duty to safeguard the health of our citizens with this conveniently vague warning, and look, we didn't even antagonize the multinational tobacco companies that bring us millions in revenue each year! Wow. We must be really smart.' That excuse would be perfect except for the fact that the government relies on a healthy workforce to keep itself afloat. But the government doesn't think about that. Oh no. Because that would bring about nasty issues like budget cuts due to loss of tobacco revenue, and then how could our politicians possibly steal government funds without us noticing? That would never do. That is why politicians choose a slow, agonizing death for our country rather than facing the truth.  The people who buy that advertising crap are, of course, the bigger idiots. But worse by far are the people working for ad agencies who actually come up with the ridiculous concepts. You have to give them credit though. They are smart enough to recognize that most people are perfect targets for manipulation because they're just too stupid to notice.  This is just like the very smart people at MTV who came up with 'Whatever things' and who don't seem to realize that they're contradicting themselves when they say 'Do not attempt these stunts EVER' and 'Would you like to know how to get on this show?' in the same advert. Or the brilliant people in pro-wrestling idolized by practically every male pre-teen in America who feel like they're doing a good deed when they advise their viewers to 'not do what we're doing at home' and actually expect their advice to be followed.  I feel so insecure in this world of incredibly intelligent people.

      I had very strange dreams over the weekend. And stranger still, I remembered most of them. Friday night (I think, it might have been Saturday) I dreamed that I had been abducted by people who broke into my room in the night. There was this guy who had a knife and I remember the very real fear and thinking that I did not want to die and that I had to find a way out of the situation. Guy-with-knife lunged at me and managed to wound me a bit but I remember getting hold of the knife before he recovered his balance and gaining the upper hand. Then I stabbed him twice in the chest. He staggered a swayed a little and I remember feeling a bit uneasy because he wasn't really down yet. So I stabbed him again on his belly and twisted the knife around and sliced upward. I wasn't really aware of any blood, just that I felt oddly satisfied when I was done. Then I had to get away. I leapt into an adjacent building and then into another one and so on until I felt that I'd lost 'them'. After that my family somehow managed to get hold of me and they drove me to this vacant lot beside a shopping mall where I would have to hide away from 'them'. But I had to get into the mall for something and inside they were everywhere and they recognized me so I had to get away again. I got outside and ran into a park with ostriches inside and there I told my sister that I would have to stay deep inside so I could remain hidden.  And then the dream just stopped. The next thing I remember is that I was in a garden with potted plants around me and there was some old guy teaching me how to properly water one of the plants. It had something to do with draining out the excess water and measuring the water level in the pot. And then I woke up.  The next night I dreamed I was a street urchin and there was someone teaching me how to read in a room inside a mansion with lots of books and colorful furniture. And then I was outside the really tall, solid fence of the mansion and I was thinking of how to smuggle a frog into the mansion without anyone noticing. Then one of my street urchin friends stuck his head on top of the fence from the inside and told me that I was being tested by the owner of the mansion, who was the same person teaching us how to read. And I remember thinking that my friend wasn't really any help, and I couldn't figure out a way to get the frog inside.  After that, I was suddenly the ruler of a particular country and I had captured and defeated an enemy and I was deciding how best to get rid of him. I remember thinking I shouldn't let him rot in prison because he might be able to escape. So I decided that a public execution would do and I ordered him to be burned at the stake. And I watched with pleasure as his body was consumed by the flames. And then I woke up.  There you go. A glimpse into my subconscious. I don't exactly know what to make of it. And if you think it's all just rubbish, well, it probably is.

      Things happen only once. And then they are gone. There are so many ways of going about the unchosen task of living. Everyone goes through life in his own unique way. But that fact - that things happen once and are never repeated - remains unchanged.    There are no rehearsals, there are no previews, there are no 30-day-limited-time-offers. There is only here and now. And then a different here and a different now. And then, well - no one knows for sure. Perhaps it goes on forever. Just like that. One step and the next. Life and death and whatever else there is that awaits us.    I am writing this down because I want to. Because I think it means something. Because I don't know the answers to what I haven't been asking.    I try to keep still but I never am, really. Everything just flows on steadily, unmindful of what I feel or think. I can't force things to stop or speed up. But eventually for me, everything will come to a halt. Abrupt or gradual, I don't know.    I would have asked a question by now if I had not known that it would be beside the point. Because my entire life is the question. And right now I have no answers. Just me. Lyle. Alive, typing, thinking, breathing, wondering.    Being.

      Today is Friday the Thirteenth. I didn't even notice until someone told me this afternoon. And my immediate thought was, 'Well, Friday the Thirteenths aren't so bad after all.' Because despite all the little annoyances I've had this week, I'm still having an okay day. Here are the reasons:  1. Our artificially natural group presentation for that accursed subject, KOM 3 (Speech in Filipino, the HORROR) which we did this morning, went reasonably well. Our group was, surprisingly, not given the usual bashing by our beloved professor, despite having worked on a script for the supposedly 'extemporaneous' group discussion. Apparently, lines flow more smoothly and naturally to said professor's ears when they are memorized word for word based on a script. I'm not complaining, though. We deserved an uno for what we did, after all the work we put in.  2. After resigning myself to the fact that I did not know squat about the quiz we were going to have for Zoo Lab in the afternoon and watching everyone study study study and spout incomprehensible terms (to me, at least) and deciding that I could just not care for once what grade I'd get for a stupid quiz because I didn't really study anyway, it turned out that our instructor spent close to an hour or more in preparing the slides we needed to view and in that amount of time I was able to read up on everything and realize that there wasn't really that much I needed to stuff in my head after all.  3. My financial troubles have come and gone (almost). Wednesday morning, after completely running out of money and banking on my ATM to withdraw, I was informed that my ATM account had just closed and my mom would be opening a new one but I couldn't use it until today. That turned out to be untrue, because it turns out I need to wait until Saturday to get some freaking money. Fortunately, I received the money my mom sent by courier and I'll be all right until tomorrow when I'll hopefully be able to get the money I very definitely need.  There. Three good things that make me feel better about my day. And I have a weekend of much-needed rest to look forward to. There were some strange things that happened to me though. Like today someone (I don't know who) gave me flowers. Oookay. And my previously-misplaced Chem Lab manual mysteriously appeared on my desk chair (didn't happen today but I'm still guessing who put it there - maybe my subconscious did).

      I have lived with myself for seventeen years now. I've had my ups and downs. I sleep and wake and live my life like most people do. I embody everything mundane and everyday and mediocre.  I don't like it though. There's something about the thought that makes me recoil inwardly with revulsion. And yet where would the world be without the nameless, faceless masses? If I hate the masses so much, do I expect the masses to hate themselves and live with it? Am I to live with the thought that I am the exception, that what applies to them doesn't apply to me?  I have always been alone. And different. Indifferent to the fact. Not completely, though. At the back of my mind there's a little nagging thought that I should pay a bit more attention to the people around me instead of being so engrossed with myself. But usually I ignore that feeling.  Come to think of it, there are many things I ignore. Because it's often easier to leave things out of your mind and distract yourself with other, less troublesome things.  I am alive. For now, I'll leave it at that. I'm recovering from whatever it is I'm afflicted with and I'm taking my recovery one day at a time.

      My day started out all right. A 7 am class (Biology) and I wasn't even late. I had breakfast at the AS canteen like I usually do on my M-Th schedule. I was even in good enough humor to scribble some notes about plant cells - nothing taxing. And our teacher entertained us with stories about trees. And showed us a picture. Yes, trees can actually be interesting. I was content to listen and take random notes and think about a play we were having in the evening. After that was Zoology and apart from falling asleep in between the period I did well enough.    Chemistry at 11.30 was a different story. I didn't bother to follow what our dear teacher was saying. I was getting tired of hearing her voice. I quietly slipped out as she started one of her long, complicated, I'm-talking-to-myself-and-not-you lectures and spent a third of the period making visuals for a report for Chemistry Lab, which was right after her class. I've done this (sneaked out) a couple of times before and she's never noticed, bless her tiny heart. When I got back, I tuned myself out to her monologue and wrote random song lyrics on a scrap of paper.    Chemistry Lab was distressing. My group was in charge of handing out and returning materials from the stock room and instead of being able to finish early and get ready for the play like I expected, we had to wait while our classmates repeated a tedious experiment to get the expected results (they didn't) which caused a bit of a delay. When we brought back the items to the stock room, we discovered that a graduated cylinder was missing. I still can't figure out how it could have just dissapeared. And the thought of a petty pyrex glassware thief in our class is just plain creepy.    Anyway.    We got ready for the play. I was supposed to be this mime-looking guy. So they decided to put white poster paint on my face. My face did not like being treated like a poster. At first I felt all right but then my face started burning. A couple of minutes spent in front of a working air conditioner dealt with it though. And off we went to the Class 1972 Theater to compete with four other batches of Med students. We were fourth to present. The first two classes did comedies. Ours was a serious drama. With a touch of the absurd. Hence the mime-looking guy (my character was called Kapighatian, and along with other imaginary beings I was supposed to drive the main character to despair). After the second presentation we went outside and got ourselves ready. And then it began.    There were a few accidents. I won't mention them here. But I was happy with the way the play turned out in the end. Funny, though. We purposely left out humor in our play. But the Med people laughed a few times (Med people meaning those already in Med proper). And they acted strangely. In fact, I always seem to think there's something strange about them. And being around them makes me feel uneasy.    Oh well.    We didn't win, as expected. But we had fun. Took some photos. Yelled a lot (most in frustration). We had dinner in the Pit, this eating place on Pedro Gil. And we made noise. And had more fun. Then we went home. I thought sadly that our brief period of camaraderie and class unity had ended. But the event proved that we could do something productive together as a class and have lots of fun in the process.    Back in the dorm, I played three games of chess with Ants, the director and scriptwriter of our play. We often have these after-class-or-some-other-activity games. We watched some of the Grammy Awards. Then Ants went home. And I started writing here.    Strange. I don't know why I suddenly had the urge to give a summary of my day. Maybe because this isn't my usual ho-hum kind of day. And that for some unknown reason I happen to think I'm happy.

      The 'Survivor All-Stars' are dumb-asses. Well, not in everything, of course. But in one very big thing that I could not believe they screwed up on.    I just watched the first two episodes tonight. I thought they would be more competitive. And they were, in a way. Too bad they just revealed how stupid they were as well.    Each 'tribe' was given very few resources after being 'abandoned' in yet another tropical island: a machete, a pot/bucket, and a map to a water reserve, which turned out to be contaminated (the water was cloudy) which meant it had to be boiled to prevent the possibility of being infected with some disease and possibly having to go home and weaken the tribe. Valid point. So they had to figure out how to make fire. Big problem there. None of the geniuses knew how (couldn't they at least have figured that out when they decided to play the game for the second time?). And that was basically the story of the first episode and part of the second. How the 'Survivors' attempted and spectacularly failed to produce fire. In the need for water. Which they had but could not use. Imagine the angst.    Let me emphasize here the fact that there were eighteen of them divided into three 'tribes'. All of them faced with the same predicament. And none of them figured out the obvious solution that was just hanging above their heads. Coconuts. Duh. They needed to hydrate themselves. Coconuts were in abundance around them. They had a machete to cut them with. How could they not have seen it?    It wouldn't have annoyed me so much if I hadn't seen one of them actually cut up a coconut and do nothing with it. I think she just poured the liquid from the coconuts into one of the buckets half filled with the contaminated water from the well. Perfect. She really worked her brain cells there.    There's more to their stupidity. On the night of the first 'tribal council', it rained. Hard. I remember thinking, Poor tribe being forced to vote someone off. They won't have the chance to collect fresh water from the rain. Because by the time they got done it wasn't raining so hard anymore. Apparently, they didn't lose out to the others at all. Because none of the other teams had the same brilliant idea that I got.    And later, they kept on harping about how much they needed water and made it their major angst-of-the-episode. When it rained again in the morning and they were already really, really thirsty, some of the guys suddenly thought, Oh, we can get water from the rain! Imagine that. And so they held their tongues out and slurped up rain water as it fell from leaves or collected it into their palms. Brilliant.    I hope the 'Survivors' don't show the same degree of stupidity as they did in the first two. That would be just sad. Seriously though, I think the 'voting-off' portion of the game has really changed with the reduction of the number of tribe members from eight to six. It becomes easier for a single person or an alliance of two to manipulate the results, and swing votes are easier to spot.    If I have the time I might just want to see succeeding episodes of this new series. I am itching to see Richard-the-big-fat-naked-gay-guy-and-former-winner-who-doesn't-deserve-to-win-again get voted off. Yes, that will just be perfect. But knowing the players, well, they just might let him win again. They are idiots like that.

      Awhile ago I took a palm-reading test and learned about the life, head and heart lines on the palm. According to the test I was good in 'believing in myself'. I suppose this is true in most cases. The problem being that I very often leave it at that and do nothing productive with it. What use is confidence when you're just lounging on your butt doing nothing? Where's the challenge I've been hoping to find? Or rather create?  The palmistry thing got me thinking about how people talk about following their head or their heart. Something emotional is supposed to be a 'heart' decision and something practical is supposed to come from the head. I am neither a head nor a heart person. I act by impulse. Whatever strikes my fancy in a particular moment. I'm never emotional and very seldom practical. I wonder how I should describe myself: a 'gut-feel' person?  I have a lot on my mind today. I can think of too many things to do with my time. This is in stark contrast to my usual state of a dazed stupor, content to just sit around and do nothing.  I need a break. And some quiet time to relax and to decide and make sense of everything. Rather than just barraging blindly onwards which is my usual strategy of doing things.

      The results are in. I was right in worrying about how my recently taken exams would turn out. In descending order: 78. 59. 44. I have never gotten grades like these in my life. Grades in almost equal proportion to the effort I put in. I have no right to be unhappy. But I am. When life gives you lucky breaks too often you start acting like you deserve them. This is my little dose of reality.   I have yet another exam to take tomorrow (I mean this) afternoon. And as usual I know absolutely nothing about what I'll be tested on. Also, I have to finish the portion of the lab report that I have to redo because the other one I made was on the wrong activity. How stupid is that? Well, my life has always been perfect.  I know I should be studying or writing (the report) or cleaning up my messy room but I am compelled to do this. I want to keep a record of everything because I feel that somehow that gives them a degree of permanence. I want to make myself feel that I didn't just breeze through life and leave nothing behind. As if I never even existed. Even if all I have to show for it are random thoughts.

      Tuesday night I went to Malate with Elaine, Gerald and Louie, all IMED friends. It was the first time I spent my night out there. Which should actually be surprising: though I live in Ermita, Malate is just a short walk away. I went out with the specific purpose of getting myself drunk. I had never been drunk in my life. My past alcohol intake has been very minimal. I wanted to know what it would feel like.  It was a small place, with tables placed close together around a dance floor. Loud pulsating music. People smoking. Dark, with colored lights moving around. I told myself I wouldn't dance. I didn't care to. Besides, when we got there, no one was dancing yet, except for this girl that I was told was getting paid for it. She was supposed to be there to 'encourage' people when no one wanted to dance. I don't think she was doing her job very well, though. She didn't encourage me, anyway. It was around 10:30 pm. We spent some time waiting for our orders (I ordered a mocha shake for starters) and after a while Elaine, Gerald, and Louie started dancing around with only the girl I mentioned for company and I had fun watching them have fun. They tried to make me join them once or twice and after a while I thought, what the heck, I've got nothing to lose so I went out there and it was okay. But I thought it would be better if I got a little drunk first so I ordered two beers and waited for awhile.   I do not like the taste of beer. Maybe alcohol in general. But I can sort of stand red wine, which is the only other alcoholic drink I've tried except for white wine and vodka(I think). I was determined to get drunk, though, and I didn't really start gagging or anything. I got through the two beers. I spilled a little I think. I started getting a little tipsy and getting the urge to pee every few minutes. I danced a few more times, and started getting more comfortable with it. I do not know whether to credit that to alcohol or just my improving mood. I had another beer. My head felt a little heavy (Elaine said that was a sign) and I waited for myself to blank out and lose control. It didn't happen. I was in perfect control of my faculties, albeit a bit unsteady on my feet. But I could remember everything. And my memory was one continuous flow until around 3 am when we decided to leave.  I'm not entirely sure whether I accomplished my purpose that night. I might have gotten drunk but most probably didn't. I'd rather not repeat it though. I had a 'hangover' the next day (whatever it was it wasn't a very nice experience) I figured that that plus the awful taste would cancel out the 'happy feeling' drinking brought, which in all likelihood might have just been a mood swing in itself.  Regardless of all that, I had fun with my IMED friends and I might want to repeat the experience (sans drinking) in the near future.

      A lot has happened in the two days that passed. And right now I am left numb. Which is strange. Because I happen to think that my experiences were pretty intense. And now I'm thinking: is this what everything leads to? Do we live and feel and find that there is nothing afterwards? There are memories, of course. But they can never really capture the essence of actuality. And they fade with time. Leaving behind vague fragments of the past. And of course death is the biggest mystery of all. Because despite any amount of faith in an afterlife, we are denied the certainty of what really happens afterwards. Will there even be a reality then?  I don't know. That's for certain. And no one else alive knows either. It really is the great equalizer. Every human being faces the uncertainty of death with an equal amount of vulnerability. I remember someone saying, "People are never born equal." I suppose this is true. But we are equal in our lack of certainty about death. And for that matter, every passing moment.  I did not intend to be philosophical. But I just have to wonder about the point of what I'm doing. Because I'm not doing it very well. I keep on immersing myself in all the trivialities of existence - eating, sleeping, studying, socializing. They take up all my time. But I think, it would be very sad if I spent my entire life this way. This is not what I'm supposed to do. This is not what I'm supposed to BE. I'm something else. I can feel it - beyond all this. Deeper. More real. Which is why I keep thinking that I've never lived a single day in my life the right way. I've never really been what I feel I should be.

      I would write some more and I have plenty of things to say but it's getting late (for me, it is) and I have to do two extremely annoying things I've been putting off over the weekend:  1. My share of our Zoology Lab Report 2. A worthless Kom activity  I have to say bye for now. But awhile ago I was just so completely incensed by the absolute injustice of everything - Well, it seemed like everything at the time but actually it was just this one thing. And now, I feel nothing. Just the usual nagging urge when I have to do something I really really dislike. In this case the two I enumerated above. Oh well. The really nasty things are yet to come. And for the moment, I have Poirot and A Separate Peace to look forward to after all this dirty work.

      I am a frog murderer. I killed two frogs two weeks ago I think. And the full realization came to me only now, after the recent onslaught of exams that occupied me the past few days. I was supposed to do a decerebration procedure, which involved cutting up the top side of a live frog's head and pulling out the brain. All that to assess what aspects of the frog's motor responses are controlled by which parts of its central nervous system. I would have objected, too, being the compassionate creature that I am, but the lab instructor said, "Oh, the operation is absolutely painless to the frog. Nothing to worry about." (not the exact words, of course, but a close approximation) and so I complied.     There were a few complications to the whole thing. First, my specimen was not exactly a frog. It was a toad. Which meant it was big and its skin was thick and bumpy. Second, I was supposed to cut through the maxillary (jaw) bone and parts of the skull, and all I had were crappy scissors from a human dissecting set that were clearly not made to cut through bone, as I was made painfully aware of the moment I began. Again, the lab instructor said, "Oh, I'm sure those scissors will do. You go right ahead." Third, the instructor was pretty vague about how to go about the whole thing. She merely told me to cut behind the eyes and take off the head and the brain with it. Not exactly illuminating.     There's more. The lab was in its usual state of sweltering heat, I was sweating like crazy, and moments after I began my first attempt my phone started vibrating in my pants pocket and just kept on going (it was a phone call, never mind who it was), which is something you never want to happen to you while dissecting a toad, particularly if you're a compassionate creature like myself.     The 'frog', too, was not behaving like it should have been. The chloroform was supposed to have sedated it and kept the whole thing painless, but unfortunately it didn't do its job as well as it should have. The 'frog' was a good actor though. After we patiently held out a chloroform-soaked cotton ball in front of its nose for some time, it appeared limp and relaxed. But when I made the move to begin cutting it up, it squirmed around and refused to keep still. Strange. Like it had somehow sensed its own death. Anyway, we had to re-apply the chloroform a couple more times until I got fed up and decided to finally get on with it.     It took me a while to cut through the jaw bone. By that time, there was yellowish-white goo that had oozed through both sides of its upper back, which I later learned was poison. Perfect. Also, a lot of blood was spewing from the cut I made, and it didn't show signs of stopping. I didn't even get to start on the more solid bones of the skull when we realized our 'frog' was dead.     Her name was Lucy, by the way.     It turned out that we cut in the wrong place - behind the exposed tympanic membrane (eardrum to laymen) when the cut was supposed to be in between the eyes and the eardrum. Well, it wasn't exactly a blunder. After all, we did cut behind the eyes like we were told.     So we decided to try again. This time with another live toad we left nameless. I was seriously doubting my scissors' capacity to do the job, but I thought maybe the right cut would make the difference. Apparently it didn't. Granted, there was no marked bleeding when I cut up the jaw, and the toad still showed signs of life, but the scissors just could not cut up the thick bone on top of its head, and in the end we had to give up trying. Which left the nameless toad with a fractured jaw and (I assume) a large amount of pain. We pithed the toad, which is just a nice way of saying we killed it by poking at and in the process destroying its brain and spinal cord. And we wrapped it up in an old newspaper with Lucy and threw it in a trash bin.     And now I'm tormented by all the ifs and could haves and I still think I could have prevented the senseless waste of amphibian life if I had just prodded for clearer instructions from the instructor or used better instruments (a scalpel, maybe, or anything else sharp) or whatever else I could've done to change the outcome of things. But it's no use. I guess my conscience will never rest.

      The concept of land and sea breezes is one of the first things I remember learning in gradeschool, back when I was still a science geek. I won't bother trying to explain it here, but it accounts for the fact that if you live near the coastline, the wind moves towards the land in the daytime and towards the sea at night. Though I live relatively near the sea in Davao, I never personally experienced this phenomenon. So you might say my learning was vicarious, which is the case with most of what I read in books. But recently, I've been noticing that walking along Padre Faura, which happens to be a street perpendicular to the Manila bay, I sometimes find myself facing the wind when walking to school in the mornings and walking home in the late afternoons. It happened again today, and it's just now that I noticed that this concept I learned early in life (and thought of at most to be something nice to know) would actually be working to my advantage at present.  Because sometimes, when I walk the street and find myself facing the wind, I forget the stench and ugliness that surround me and find that there are still some things in this congested metropolis that are beautiful.

      Today I scratched off another annoyance: KOM 3 is officially done for good. I just took the final exam this morning, and it felt great right after. I still have to study though. There's the third exam for Math 100 tomorrow, and the finals on Tuesday. There's Soc Sci and (maybe) the Chem finals on Monday if I want to take it. But I feel like a seasoned veteran by now. I can handle this. I won't screw up.

      My left hand is still numb from writing. Funny - it's been a while since I subjected my fingers to this much stress. And the results are just perfect, too. No, I did not write something meaningful and important. No, I did not take another important step towards discovering who I am. No, I did nothing to fulfill the greatness that is my destiny. I did less than that. Much less. The kind of 'less' that reminds me of dirt that gets stuck in between my toes when I walk outside on my slippers.  I woke up at 8 this morning, and I immediately realized that my Zoology Lab Manual was due to be passed at precisely that moment. That's when adrenaline started pumping through my veins.  Fact:  Right then, I had filled up less than an eighth of my manual.  Fact:  I had all weekend to do it, but I spent all my time trying to postpone the dreaded chore until the last possible moment.  Fact:  I started on it last night but I got tired and discouraged when I realized just how much work it would take and reverted to reading  urlLink  my current book   instead.  Fact:  Exhausted, I slept at around 3 am and promised myself I'd wake up after a short nap. I didn't.   Bummer.   So I started filling up my manual like crazy and it took me until 3.30 pm. Perfect. Thirty minutes early for my Chemistry exam. I should have been happy, except for the fact that I knew literally nothing, as I mentioned previously, and I had thirty minutes to cram in as much information as I could. As expected, it didn't help much.  I won't talk about how I think I did on the test. I won't say how I felt when I saw my Zoology grades posted on a bulletin board later in the afternoon. They're not important. What's important is that I have, once again, disappointed myself.  Back to my hand. My fingertips are hurting. Not the satisfying kind of hurt that happens when I manage to write down something with a pen and paper that captures my thoughts almost perfectly and makes me feel like there's a point to living. The hurt is more of a reminder of how, hours earlier, I felt like a piece of dirt that gets stuck between my toes when I walk outside on my slippers. And now, well, let's just say that it's not just my left hand that's numb. Because my thoughts are just a big, resounding blank.

      So. I finally got done moving from  urlLink blog-city . I thought it would take forever, with me being an HTML ignoramus and all. But I did it. Big smile.  This is my first official post with blogger, and I know I should talk about something interesting and important. But all I can think of is that I have a sudden unexplainable craving for a cinnamon bun. It's stupid, really. I pass by Cinnzeo almost every day, on my way to the mall, and I can't remember how many times I thought about going there and deciding against it because I'm really not the cinnamon-and-sweets type. Must be the fact that I'm really, really hungry. I haven't had any meals since yesterday. Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything yet today. I woke up at two in the afternoon, which isn't out of the ordinary since I like to sleep in on weekends. Right after that I decided to work on moving my files from blog-city to here, and making everything look decent. Just goes to show how much effort I put in for this.  Now that  this  is finally over, I'm eating. A lot. The mall is closed by now, sadly, so I can't get the cinnamon bun I'm craving for. But there's a convenience store where I'm staying, and I'm going on a junk-food binge. And then... well, there's another exam coming up this Tuesday. Chemistry. I used to like it, you know. Better than Biology, even. But now things are different. Because I am in Chemistry hell, along with everyone in my class. Hell being defined as a teacher who has everything in common with the Energizer bunny... she just goes on and on and on. To be fair, though, she isn't really a bad teacher.  Too  good, maybe, but definitely not bad. And she's a decent person.  It's just that, well, I mentioned earlier that I'd been sneaking out of class without her noticing. The truth is, there wasn't a single lecture she gave where I listened. I managed last week's exam well enough by reading our course module. I'm hoping to do the same thing for Tuesday. The problem being that the exam isn't even covered by the course (we're taking up Chem 14, General Chemistry, and the Tuesday test is from Chem 18, and I don't even know what it's about) and I have to read almost the entire Chem 18 module, as opposed to reading just a few chapters.  I'm confident I'll be able to pull it off, though. I've gotten out of worse situations. I'll get out of this one.

      It's been close to a month since my last post. I can't claim to have been unusually busy, although, as one classmate very aptly put it, the latter part of this semester has given a new dimension to the phrase 'Hell Week'. Because, as I mentioned earlier, I had been expecting several Hell Weeks to pass as successive waves of departmental exams for most subjects, but the phrase Hell Week implies periods in between when things are not as Hellish. Unfortunately, we didn't have them. So our Hell Weeks dragged on and on and are more accurately termed collectively as one big happy Hell Month. I won't go into detail and complain about how our insignificant, unimportant subjects reared their evil heads and made their presence felt with unreasonable requirements totally out of proportion with their designated GPA values. I can do that later.   My point is that all the added stress isn't really the reason why I haven't been blogging. You see, when you have a lot to do you're supposed to get busy and go to work. But since I have an inherent aversion to work, I didn't do that, and I ended up doing nothing. And every time I thought about blogging I would get myself in front of a PC and start typing but I couldn't make the words come out. And sometimes I'd be too lazy to even get myself in front of a PC and the thoughts I'd been keeping in my head stayed for a while but they probably got tired of being there so they left.  A lot of things have happened. I have made decisions and I have yet to reap the consequences. I don't want to review stale news, but there are a few things which I think are worth mentioning:   Last weekend I read two books. The Stranger by Albert Camus and We The Living by Ayn Rand.  Both got me thinking. Because disregarding the fact that the stories are entirely different, and that one is pessemistic and the other ends with a kind of optimism, I realized that the two are essentially the same. They both talk about what it means to be alive. And they are both honest. And from entirely different perspectives they send the message that we are responsible for how our lives turn out and we need to choose to live and value our existence.  There is a song called 100 Years by Five for Fighting. The melody is beautiful. It's one of the songs I gradually learned to like. It's a story of someone's life that passes by as if years were just precious moments contained in a verse. There's a line in it, when that someone is about to die, that says, '...[there's still] time to buy and time to choose...'. And its true. Because until our last moments we keep on choosing what we make of ourselves. And when we do nothing, it's still a choice.  A few hours ago I decided to watch a movie. I did it because I needed to study for an exam in Zoology tomorrow and for another exam in Chemistry the day after that (both of which I'll fail if I take them right now), and because I felt like I would throw up if I did. So I watched The Butterfly Effect. And I was stunned. Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking. I have always been haunted by all the 'what ifs' in life. What if I wasn't born a Christian? What if I lived somewhere else and met different people? What if I could have lived a completely different life that would give me everything I could ask for, but instead I am living this, and there's no way out because this is the one life that I have, and so I'm forever be denied of that better possibility and since I don't see it, to me it wouldn't be anything at all? These are things I've been asking myself ever since I can remember. And these are the questions the movie addresses. The movie made me realize that what we do to ourselves is so powerful and has so many repercussions, and that our choices can literally turn us into completely different people. It made me see that I am not bound to my concept of myself, that I reinforce my view of who I am and how others see me in every moment through my every action. And by simply not taking things for granted, I can change the entire course of my life, and the lives of others around me.  I remember, some time ago, that I read Stephen King's compilation of short stories, Everything's Eventual. I don't particularly remember the title story, but I remember thinking that I wouldn't want for the statement to be true. Because I can't accept that I don't have a say in how things turn out for me, because I think that when I change my whole future changes, because I think that life would be so boring when we can't decide for ourselves.

      I'm still alive. I don't exactly know why I've been hibernating this past week or so. It's something I've very cleverly kept myself from comprehending. And since all my little interesting ideas have hidden themselves in the clutter that is my brain, I've decided to write on something every other blogger has already had his say on - The Passion of the Christ.  Disclaimer: I have absolutely no intention of further promoting this already too-publicized movie. I think Mr. Gibson has already paid enough for that. I'm just another someone typing out words and posting them for everyone to see just because I can.  I watched the movie last Friday, more as an excuse to skip yet another boring math lecture than on any religious pretext. Although I did employ this skewed type of logic: since math doesn't matter at all in my life anyway (except as a requirement I have to get through) while Jesus' story is something that should matter to everything to me if I'm to call myself a practicing Christian (which I'm not), then it would be a much more productive use of my time to refresh myself on the major events in Christian doctrine than to mull over statistical data.  And so I went to the cinema, bracing myself for a dose of extreme violence. From all the reviews I read about the movie, I half-expected Roman soldiers to start cutting people's heads off, complete with close-ups of blood spurting out from their necks. That didn't happen, though. The violence I encountered from Jesus' flogging up to his crucifixion was tame compared to other violent movies I've seen. Yes, I admit that I found the sight of Jesus being tortured painful to watch, but the movie didn't deserve people saying the violence was  wanton and uncalled-for . It's not as if Jesus' followers and other enlightened people went around grinning and eating popcorn. The violence was completely in context, and any sane viewer who pays attention will notice that the good guys did not approve of what happened. Even Pilate tried his best to prevent the outcome.  What those critics should have noticed, I think, is how the story was humanized and portrayed in a way that doesn't make you want to nod off after the first few minutes, which is what those old Holy Week movies always made me do. Also, I like the realistic portrayal of what happened - the movie didn't try to sugarcoat events or tone them down to make them more palatable.  Despite all that, though, I think the film isn't at all perfect. What I didn't like about it is that instead of focusing on historical accuracy, they added unnecessary dramatics (the crow was an insult, really) that made things seem too theatrical. Besides that, I think the film was all right, and for someone wanting to get back in touch with his Christian faith, it's a good start.

      Once again, my stubborn self is refusing outright to let anything get into my head. I've been here in Manila for a week now, classes started this Wednesday, and already we have two reports due next week. I can almost predict the outcome of my weekend - I'll spend two thirds of the day sleeping, the rest dazedly walking around my room like a zombie, and the wee hours of Monday cramming for two reports I should have spent the whole weekend doing. Here is my sad state of affairs:  1. As yet I know absolutely nothing about the two subjects I'm taking this summer. This must be because I've been coming to class late again and disappearing in between periods to try to regain my sanity.  2. I have a lot of non-school-related concerns taking up space in my head that keep me from getting any real moment of peace.  3. I've been semi-sick the past few days. This is a new type of condition I picked up in the course of my stay here. Just a few sneezes, a few coughs -  nothing serious enough to require any medication but enough to cause me unnecessary annoyance. The only good thing about it is that most of the time it just manages to go away by itself.   Faura looks decent at night. The yellow sodium street lamps even make it look almost beautiful.

      While walking to school this afternoon I had to stop in this little island in between the lanes of Taft Avenue while a caravan of horn-blasting vehicles that had bright, pink flowers painted all over them passed in front of me. This, clearly, was a campaign device very ingeniously crafted by Presidential candidate Raul Roco (sarcasm intentional). Don't get me wrong - it's not that I have anything against Roco (in fact I think he's an okay person) it's just that the streets of Manila have been saturated by the campaigning of so many would-be politicians and I'm sick of it. Ever since campaign period started I have heard popular jingles converted into campaign slogans pumped out almost daily by mobile loudspeakers, I have seen posters of artificially smiling candidates plastered on every available corner, I've endured political ads full of glowing promises that make me cringe.  I am tired of the blatant lack of creativity displayed by people running for office in this country. But I would have been willing to tolerate all that if that were their only offence. The problem is that most of the time these candidates prey on the ignorance of the masses. I heard on the news that Gloria Arroyo, current president and running candidate, attended several high school graduations in which she promised free education for the poorest among them, granted, of course, that she gets elected. This, I think, is just plain stupid. First of all, she made no attempt to quantify her statement. Who exactly are the poorest of the poor, and how many of them exactly will the government subsidize? Also, this will ultimately lead to people vying to prove that they are poorer than the next person. As head of state, I don't think this is something you want to happen to your citizens. It's like this policy I read about in the United States where dirt cheap apartment rates were provided for the poorest people, with the result that it was even harder for people with minimum wage jobs to get housing than those on social security!  Another Gloria boo-boo I read about in a newspaper is how she gained voters among the Tricycle Drivers' Association because she supported them when the MMDA (Metro Manila Development Authority) was about to outlaw them. Tricycles are these small, modified motorcycles that carry passengers who don't want to walk short distances. They are also safety hazards on the road because they very often do not have safety lights (much less seatbelts) and are usually parked in the sides of roads, clogging up the sidewalk and even taking up road space. I see her move as another selfish bid to secure her victory.  While my dad and I were on our way home one night in Davao, we had to take a different route because a triangular intersection in the middle of the city was completely taken up by a wooden stage, large posters of the candidates of Arroyo's party, and a crowd of people witnessing the campaign. That was just wrong. To think that Gloria kept on bragging of possessing the 'moral high ground' in the elections. Yeah right.  It might seem like I'm doing a Gloria-bashing here, but I'm really not. It's just that I happen to have a collection of examples of her stupidities. Most other candidates have done much the same. The point I'm trying to make is that Philippine politics is in a depressingly low state. They are no better (and are even worse) than the media, who shamelessly use the masses to further their own moneymaking ends. Filipinos have been promised a better future, one where we can hold our heads high and know that we are actually heading somewhere. But this will never materialize unless there is a radical change in our political system. Right now, while the bid for public office is one big popularity contest, where no move is too low that will secure the most number of votes, where even in the highest places the prevailing attitude is 'be content with little and do the bare minimum in all situations', and where morality serves no purpose except as a front to provide an illusion of goodness to the witless herd, the Filipino nation will remain as it has always been: fragmented, backward, a farce perpetrated by the people on top, our brothers, those who should know better. This is the ultimate betrayal, and it seems we shall always be bound by it.

      I was pleasantly surprised a few days ago when I suddenly heard on the radio this song I really like called  urlLink  Let Your Shoulder Fall   by Matthew Jay. Besides the melody, I like the noncomittal way he says the words, like he doesn't really care that much when in truth, it means all the world to him. It's a sad song, and it makes you think, and it's beautiful. Another song I heard before but didn't know the title of is  urlLink  Dare You to Move   by Switchfoot. It's inspiring, and it really applies to my situation. Because I am an idealist, because I am so far from what I hold ideal, and because I need to lift myself up and become who I'm meant to be.

      I think that my life ever since I went home for the summer has been one long therapy session with my experiences being the shrink and myself as the befuddled patient who hasn't yet resolved his many internal conflicts. I remember one particular incident when I accompanied my 'aunt', a family friend who's an ophthalmologist, while she went through her rounds before ending her work day. She had three patients confined in the hospital that day. The first we visited was a little girl, about the same age as my sister Maxine, who just had her eyes operated on to correct a congenital deformity. Since my aunt is an expert in reconstructive eye surgery, I don't think the case presented much of a problem. The little girl seemed to be doing well, and though she looked scared and uneasy (she had gauze patches over both eyes and couldn't take them off until the next day), she had her parents around to comfort her. Next was a boy around my age who sustained a major eye operation to clear the mucus that was clogging one of the sinuses close to his right eye. I thought this was pretty silly at first, but I was told that this was his second operation, and that the first one had to be done because the accumulated mucus caused his eye to bulge out. Strange, but true. The last patient we visited was the one that left the most impact on me. He was confined in the Neuro Ward, but there was a curtain separating his bed from the others. This meant I had my first sight of him from quite close by, and I was relieved that my face didn't register my astonishment at what I saw. He was a small, thin boy, maybe seven or eight years old, and his large round head was lined with staples where his hairline would be. I learned that he was run over by a truck on a highway, and though he didn't have any injuries in the lower parts of his body, his skull was fractured in front and his eyes were damaged as well, but I didn't pay much attention to what I was told about what happened the boy's eyes because I couldn't stop staring at his head. It looked so fragile, as if a single touch would cause it to break apart again. And then my aunt mentioned that there was no bone left in front of his forehead and she told me to feel it. I did, and it was so soft that I was afraid I'd press too hard and maybe injure his brain so I quickly pulled away. Throughout all this the boy was awake, and he was murmuring things I couldn't understand. He must have said something funny though, because his mother, who was lying beside him on the bed, laughed a little and asked him about it. While my aunt and the boy's mother were conversing about his treatment and how well he was doing, I thought about how much bravery that mother was showing, that she could bear to laugh and appear to take things lightly for the sake of her child.  Afterwards, I asked my aunt about the details of the accident, and learned that it was a hit-and-run case - the truck driver had sped away right after hitting the boy. The remarkable thing about it was that a witness had managed to recall the truck's plate number, and because of that, the truck's owner, a Chinese businessman, had been identified and besides paying damages was charged to shoulder all the expenses related to the boy's treatment.  The whole story made me think a lot, especially of my decision to become a physician in the future. The truth is, when I was little, I wasn't exactly sure of the  one  thing I wanted to be when I grew up, but I made up my mind that  I very certainly wasn't going to be a doctor . I don't really know why, but that's pretty much how I felt until high school, and by then, I had decided that I was going to become a lawyer. My parents hinted now and then that being a doctor would be an ideal profession for me, but I always dismissed the idea, and being the open-minded people that they are (God bless them), they left me to whatever I wanted for myself, believing firmly that I would put my heart to whatever it was I had chosen.  Things changed, though, when I was informed that I had the opportunity to enter a course that would reduce my pre-Med time to two years and guarantee me a slot in the College of Medicine, which is of course what  urlLink INTARMED  is. It was then that my father had a serious talk with me about what being a doctor is really like, and why he chose it as his profession. You see, my father, like me, had also wanted to become a lawyer. But he didn't do that, and now I can't imagine what life would be if he was one. Anyway, after that, I gradually came to realize that being a doctor was what I wanted to become, and was in fact the best thing I could become. It's like this: As a lawyer, I'd be spending my time studying things created by man, things that are arbitrary, temporary, and subject to interpretation. The law I'd be studying in the Philippines would probably be completely worthless in, say, Pakistan. On the contrary, as a doctor I'd be studying the inner workings of man, a creature created by God by his design, and even if you don't believe that, the point is that the biology of man is constant, in the sense that the same basic principles govern the body of every human, whether he lives in Pakistan or anywhere else. Furthermore, what makes medicine the noblest of all professions is that it very directly upholds the dignity of man, and an understanding of it is ultimately an understanding of the self.  I admit that I have many times been reluctant to face the fact that I am now stuck in Manila and this routine I loathe. This is why I wrote this piece partly as a reminder to my self that I do, in fact, desire to become a doctor. And I do believe in the end result of what I'm undertaking, even if I complain a lot about what happens along the way. The memory of the day I spent with my aunt at the hospital will stay with me as a reminder of why I'm here in the first place - because I want to make a difference, and because I want to do something meaningful with my life. That is all I really need to know.

      I want to go home. The reason I've been griping about my situation ever since I got here is because I don't want to go through another month having to stress myself so much. I need to transplant my house and my family here. Or I need to transplant UPM and PGH there. I wonder which is easier. The latter, probably.

      I did not get to enroll today. There was a problem with the registration - our block was assigned to the wrong classes. This means I'll have to go back tomorrow morning, right before our classes begin in the afternoon. Talk about short notice.   I got my P.E. grade instead. And though I know it doesn't really matter because P.E. is only a pass-fail course and the teacher was kind to me (she even remembered my name!) besides, I still got irked when I found out I only got a lousy 2.25. The teacher said it's because I didn't move so well. Oookay.   Note to self: let go of misgivings over crappy grade in insignificant subject.  Afterwards I told myself,  Hey, why not have a nice meal at McDonald's  (I hadn't eaten at McDonald's in over a month because it's out-of-the-way from my place)  and get that McFlurry you've been craving for?  So of I went in a vain effort to enjoy a satisfactory fast-food experience.  The McFlurry was fine. Everything else wasn't. It started right after I paid for my order. I handed the girl at the counter a five-hundred-peso bill. "Do you have a smaller bill?", girl-at-counter asked. "No," I said, slightly apologetically. So girl-at-counter proceeded to give me one hundred-peso bill, two hundred something pesos worth of twentys, and thirteen one-peso coins. This gave the effect that in one meal, my five hundred pesos had been reduced to one hundred-peso bill, a bunch of twentys, and some heavy coins that made my wallet bulge. I was not at all happy.  I took the only available table, which happened to be close to a number of middle-aged people who were having a meeting of some kind (though how people can stand to hold meetings such a crowded place with eighties new-wave music blaring in the background is beyond my comprehension). Big mistake. Apparently, they were discussing a pyramid marketing scheme. I learned this because their 'leader' kept talking about it in a loud, grating voice. Fortunately, I managed to tune him out after he mentioned something about some guy who pawned off his cell phone to get started in the business. I managed this because I started to notice my food.  I opened my yellow styrofoam food container and discovered, to my dismay, that my eighth of a chicken was a tiny, pathetic-looking wing. Also, the rice serving looked like it would only fill a quarter of a cup. The apple pie, too, seemed smaller than I remembered. At this point I had a strong urge to take back my money and spend it instead at Chef D'Angelo's (which, by the way, I do not consider a fast food place, except during  peak hours) where I would at least have had a proper meal in front of me. This, sadly, was not a possibility. Faced with my dismal-looking meal of diminished proportions, it didn't take me long to finish eating and then I was out of there, facing the filthy street called Taft Avenue like a convict just released from prison.  Considering that for the next few weeks I shall once again have to patronize fast-food chains of the same kind, I have formulated a few rules that to me are essential for one to survive this particular type of dining experience unscathed:  1. Be prepared to face long lines in front of the counters upon your arrival, reminiscent of the food rationing services provided by the Soviet Republic decades earlier. Remember: You are not there to be serviced by that particular fast-food chain. You are there to add to the profits of its owners, just like the millions of Russians who died to give glory to their Great Proletarian Republic. So wait.  2. Expect your food to look a lot less appetizing than the pretty pictures you see in the menus.  3. Ignore the loud music/noisy people/unpleasant odors/general uncomfortableness of the surroundings. Buy your meal, eat it, and leave. Do not linger, because that might keep the hordes of potential customers from eating in the same place. It is likely that the loud music/noise/etc. were purposely set up by the management to get rid of you as soon as possible. Respect their wishes.  4. Do not expect the employees to have time to cater your needs. They are probably understaffed and are too busy taking orders from the customers who just keep on coming. This also applies to people who expect clean lavatories provided with soap and toilet paper - odds are, you're on your own.  5. Finally, whatever your circumstances, always compare your situation to the worst possible scenario. Then just grit your teeth, take a few deep breaths, and repeat the words 'this could be worse' in your head until you feel a bit better. If this doesn't work, go far, far away. You aren't in the right disposition to sustain other similar encounters. Better stick to home-cooked meals.  I think that this rip-off from something JFK said best illustrates the fast-food philosophy:    Think not what your fast-food chain can do for you, rather, think of what YOU can do for your fast-food chain.

      Yesterday was Easter Sunday and I went to mass for the first time in three months. It took a little longer than usual. The priest had this Presbyterian from Norway profess his faith along with the rest of us and that was supposed to convert him into a Catholic. The priest asked everyone to give him a round of applause afterwards. I didn't. In my head I was wondering why on earth anyone would want to convert to the Catholic faith.  When I was studying in a Catholic school, masses and other religious services were imposed on us regularly. When the time came to recite the profession of faith (I believe in God, the father almighty, etc.) I couldn't allow myself to include the phrase 'the holy Catholic church'. I just didn't believe in it.  What I hate most about the Church is that it used to be a worldly, power-hungry institution that opressed the masses (the giving of indulgences and the Spanish Inquisition were acts of pure evil) and if there is anything I hate, it's someone, or something, that's oppressive and power-hungry. Even today, when the Church has made feeble attempts at making things right, I still observe priests and many self-righteous lay people acting exactly like the Pharisees Jesus so passionately condemned. I don't mean to say that the Church teaches people to act that way, but since a Church is supposed to be a community, I'd rather not be a part of it. Also, I agree with Martin Luther on many counts (like the issue on the adoration of Mary) and though I am not a Protestant, I very certainly do not want to be Catholic.  I agree that no religious denomination is perfect, which is why I prefer not to align myself with any and I consider myself a plain Christian. I read the Bible and I believe in Christ. I don't put any worth on tradition because Christ didn't either.  With that issue settled, my faith went on a roller coaster ride these past two weeks. I thought I got over my issues but now they're still here. I think, though, that I'll be able to deal with them in my own time and I don't need to convert denominations to put my mind to rest.

      This is one of the days when I regret all the more that this country was not subjected to a dictatorship under Lee Kwan Yew. I just got back from Davao (I had to leave, there's no way around it) and endured a one-and-a-half-hour flight with an infant wailing incessantly throughout the duration. This is not something you want to happen to you when you need to take a rest. I wouldn't have been so pissed off if it hadn't been for what happened right after - it took exactly 29 minutes from when the conveyor belt started running before I got my only piece of luggage. I checked. And because of that wasted time, I'll have to postpone my enrollment for the summer term tomorrow. I remember Lee saying he made it a priority to make sure airline travelers got their luggage as soon as possible so there wouldn't be any unnecessary waiting. This is a concern our short-sighted politicians wouldn't even dream of addressing. If things had only gone differently, and Singapore got Marcos while we got Lee...  Unfortunately for me, more annoyances followed. After claiming my luggage I suddenly realized I left the book I was reading in the plane, a book which would have been of great use to me and which I most likely will not get another copy of. Stupid me. And then, when I got back to the building I stay in, this creepy taxi driver practically begged me for a large tip which I grudgingly gave him in case he did anything crazy.  Now, though, I am comfortably settled in and I'll be spending the rest of the day relaxing and giving myself a well-deserved rest.  Tomorrow is a new day and a new beginning and I'll see what life has in store for me.

      I have come to the conclusion that home, indeed, is synonymous to rest, relaxation, and total comfort. I almost broke down when after three long months of (self-imposed) exile I was finally reunited with my big, brown, comfortable bed in my room that after all this time still exudes its the-great-Lyle-has-been-here-for-prolonged-periods quality. Never mind that my desk was replaced with piles of boxes in my absence. Never mind that the computer had to be reformatted which is why I am in yet another net cafe to get this entry published. In my mind's eye, there is, truly, no place like home.

      Yesterday afternoon I watched the last two episodes of survivor all-stars. Predictably, it was an exercise in stupidity. Disregarding the fact that it turned into a complete mush-fest (which almost made me puke), it was just a continuation of how people time and again allow themselves to get run over like little woodland creatures standing around waiting to become roadkill. There were numerous occasions when the other players could have voted either Amber or Rob off, but they didn't, because they were just too stupid to realize they were being used and manipulated. Everyone kowtowed to Rob just because he was bold enough to impose himself on them, to flatter them, to make promises he had no intention to keep. And the other players, being little woodland creatures at heart, looked on blankly as one by one they were knocked down, almost gleefully I think, by the conniving couple. There is really nothing excellent in Amber or Rob's strategy. They merely relied on a tried and true method: always expect the stupidest in people, and formulate your plans accordingly. To Amber - congratulations. With a complete lack of talent and skill (If you think about it, what else is necessary in a game of elimination but stupidity, luck, and perhaps some cunning?) you bested the other players and became the 'sole survivor'. You've proven yourself to be the least stupid among the flock.  I was watching TV yesterday afternoon and not voting because I am not yet eighteen. Which might seem to be a pity at first, but is probably for the best. My single vote wouldn't really be able to change the fact that the fate of this country has already been decided beforehand - by the carnivals disguised as campaign sorties, by butt-kissing to various 'authoritative' cult groups, by the bitter fight between candidates who will stop at nothing to be put in power, and most importantly, by the overwhelming judgment of everyone that the Filipino people are little woodland creatures being herded to their deaths.

      Sometime last week, while I was in the grip of a particularly annoying respiratory infection (I am still recovering), I got so pissed at all the stupid people around me that I would have written a scathing, lengthy entry containing numerous impolite words if I had only had strength enough to sit in front of a computer and type. Nevertheless, I've since contained my anger and I've created a list of all the people who require immediate punishment.   Note: this is to be taken in the context of an alternate universe where conditions are exactly the same except that I have absolute, unquestionable powers (this is actually true even now, people just don't realize it yet).   1. Drivers of smoke belching vehicles - They shall be given exactly one week to overhaul their engines, and those who don't comply will promptly be rounded up and shot. Not very creative, I know, but it will do. The vehicles themselves will be disposed of in a conveniently out-of-the-way area, all the better to clear up our congested cities.  2. Politicians who had the brilliant idea to allow certain countries to dump worthless spare parts into our country, thereby creating the problem I've mentioned above - These guys, being the instigators of the whole thing, and being the people who should know better, will be publicly skinned alive and left in the streets to rot. An example to others who might get similar brilliant ideas.  3. Politicians, law enforcement officials, and others in power who shamelessly neglect any reasonable measure of law enforcement and allow smoke belching vehicles to run unchecked in the streets, poisoning the citizenry - These people will be decapitated (if they hadn't already been skinned alive) after being branded with the letter S on their chests, which stands for  stupid . Their severed heads, along with their bodies, will be displayed in a public area for exactly one week. Again, another example.  4. People who smoke in the streets or in any public area - They will have one hand cut off (preferably the stronger one) and they will have their noses removed. As an afterthought, I might designate one or two buildings within each city to which smoking will be limited – like a smokers' ghetto. The windows will, of course, remain closed.  5. Politicians who, until now, allow cigarette ads on TV and the radio when they have long been outlawed in most other places - Refer to punishment number 2. Any other creative mode of torture and/or execution will be appreciated.  6. People who spit on the streets (here's a clue: keep your disgusting body fluids to yourselves) - They will have their tongues severed and their lips sheared off. Repeat offenders will be smeared with their own spit and required to perform a month of community service.  7. Any other insignificant creatures who happen to incite my annoyance - They will be subject to my discretion, and punishment will vary depending on my mood. They will be sure, however, to lose any number of appendages and/or their lives.  I could go on and on, but this will do for now. With the excellent administrative policies I've come up with, I might consider running for office in the future. Or perhaps more suitably, heading a military coup.

      Since I'm not in the mood to do anything productive yet, and since once again all my interesting little ideas for posting have deserted me, I might as well write about a movie I just finished watching: Walking Tall by the Rock. It's funny because at the beginning when they flashed his name it could have been the title of the movie. Sort of like  The Ring  or  The Phone  or something like that. I didn't really plan on watching it (I didn't like the trailer, for one thing) but I had two compelling reasons to waste my time:  1. The afternoon was unbearably hot and I wanted to spend a couple hours without having to constantly wipe the sweat from my face. 2. I had a hangover from spending my weekend almost entirely in bed doing nothing. (I was sick and would have written a few entries about stuff I thought about except that I was too lazy, but maybe I will later) As you should know by now, making like a sloth is one of my favorite things to do, and I didn't want it to end.  So I picked the movie I thought I would least dislike and ended up watching a puzzle. It bored me a little at first, but the story showed promise. And then, when the bad guys started raining bullets on the sheriff's office and the Rock started retaliating by shooting at them with a shotgun I thought,  Crap. I am stuck in a generic Filipino action movie . It had all the classic elements: The big, tough-looking hero who could get away with trashing stuff in the name of righteousness and who's only plan seemed to be 'act first, think later'. The hero's 'consort' who's only job was to act pretty and add a bit of interest in the tamer periods. The overused theme of revenge and settling old scores. And of course, plenty of ass-kicking and gunslinging. Undeniably, it was no different from the hundreds of movies that preceded it in this respect. But it was also a feel-good movie. Unlike the usual drawn-out drama and melodramatic ending, the plot moved quickly and actually had a bit of humor. The battle with the bad guys was short and sweet, and provided unconditional victory. The Rock barely got a few scratches, and while he did get a big ugly scar in his midsection, it only served to win him the sympathy of the townspeople and didn't seem to bother his leading lady at all when she took off his shirt and they made out in the sheriff's office. All the bad guys either got shot, severely beaten up, sent to prison, or all of the above. The ending was actually very satisfying. Too good to be true. But then, who would want it to be true?  The movie, I now realize, is standard fare for the masses. Nothing spectacular, but good enough. Sort of the equivalent of the McDonald's value meal I ate while watching. Nevertheless, both served my purpose.  And that's just what I wanted.

      It's been a while since I last posted. I don't have anything definite to say right now, so let me leave you with a little something I wrote some months ago, something that I think still applies to me today.    Life is a tragedy, but not quite. You see, a tragedy focuses too much on the ending - that's how it's defined, after all. A tragedy equals a bad ending. And yet despite the fact that all existence comes down to the end is death, I somehow sense that that's not really the point. I may be an irrational hopeful who blinds himself to the inevitability of death (as I suspect the vast majority of people do), but I say it's better to be irrational than to live in despair and meaninglessness.  One sad truth is that most of the time, people live their lives on hold, suspended in time, promising themselves to live with purpose, fulfill their dreams, and make everything the way it should be, right after they get done slacking off or basically just doing nothing. At least, that's the way it is with me. Oftentimes, it takes a tragedy before people finally wake up from their respective fantasy worlds, whatever they may be. I don't know how or why this happens, but it definitely does, and I don't want it to come to that point.  So in a sense the awareness of death, of how fleeting a moment our present existence is, is what ironically impels the individual to make the most out of everyday life and treasure every experience. It is uncertain what the future may bring, and all we have is the here and now. The reality of death does bring despair, but beyond that it also carries the message that life is infinitely precious, that it is something to be savored to its fullest extent to give it justice.  And so, when the time comes when all has passed and there is nothing left but goodbye, I'll have only one thing to say: I hope you had the time of your life, and I hope I did too.

      I still haven't fully digested the idea, but I am all set to fly home for the weekend - except that I haven't yet started packing, but that's a minor detail I'll deal with later. I'd already mentioned that my roommates spend most weekends in their own homes, and this had always made me feel a bit jealous. I never really considered the idea myself - not seriously, anyway.   It began on a whim. My sister's birthday is on the 31st, she wanted me to be around during the celebration (which would, of course, take place in Davao), and I wanted to be there. So we told our parents about our little idea and predictably, they said no. They didn't really have to explain anything - I knew it was out of the question. In the first place, leaving for even a weekend might cause me to screw up my academics, and god forbid that ever happens. Also, from a pragmatic point of view, buying a round trip ticket to spend a little more than a day back home&nbsp;would just be a waste of money. To complicate matters, I found out I had an exam scheduled for this Friday and another one on Saturday.   Still, I wanted to return to Davao badly. Ever since I arrived here at the start of the semester, I hated the thought of having to spend five whole months away. And that's just what would happen had fortune not decided to smile on me. But wonder of wonders, I got a call from my dad last night - it turns out he had already bought me a ticket and he wanted to know if I could come. I was prepared to decline, actually, because of the exams I had scheduled for Friday and Saturday. But then I remembered that both exams, for reasons I couldn't care less about, had actually been postponed, making me free for the weekend. At that moment, I wanted to jump up and down and do cartwheels. I was going home.   I just came from the airline ticketing office. I booked my ticket for an afternoon flight tomorrow. And boy, am I glad I'm leaving. Even for just a weekend.

      I was eating a (very) late dinner at Wendy's a while ago and lost track of time while reading an engaging short story by Stephen King about a man who finds a growing finger crawling around his bathroom sink. It was maybe a little past midnight when I stepped out of the restaurant and made my way to the building I stay in, and I immediately noticed that something wasn't right. The entire street ahead of me was empty and silent. No vehicles parked or moving down the road, no people, nothing except a dark lump huddled next to a building near the next street corner, whom I recognized as the urchin who regularly occupied that area at night. I had to turn the corner to get to my destination. I wasn't afraid of the sleeping figure - he wasn't a threat. But I was creeped out majorly by the sight of Taft avenue completely deserted. The same Taft avenue that I negotiated daily with distaste because of all the obstacles, human or otherwise, along the way. I had repeatedly found myself wishing that everything around me would disappear. And now it had. And I realized that had this happened during the day, the situation would have been more eerie. I knew that traffic thinned out along Taft at night, because most of the vehicles that pass carry commuters who work during the day, but I had never considered that it could actually become nonexistent, even for just a few moments.  In those strange few seconds as I took in my surroundings, with the yellow sodium lights casting a dim but warm glow around everything, I actually felt a sense of freedom that I never feel when I walk the streets. When I'm in any public area, and especially when I am alone, I am always on guard, and I never allow myself to completely relax. Especially when I'm on Taft avenue, a street which, I have often reflected, is a perfect testament to that bastard of a president it was named after. (You may recall that W.H. Taft was that moron who said that God had told him it was the Americans' duty to civilize their 'little brown brothers'.) So I let myself loose, and I found myself running until I reached the corner to the other street where I saw people sitting around the sidewalk doing nothing. And then the experience ended, and I stopped running and walked like a sane person the rest of the way.

      Right now I'm hungry and tired and so not in the mood for another round of intensive studying. I had a long day, starting with a Zoology lecture exam I spent all weekend studying for, after which I immediately turned my attention to cramming hundreds of terms in my head for the quiz on cat bones in the afternoon. My strategy worked, because I think I did well enough, but I was hyped up the entire time and there were a couple of instances when I felt like I was about to throw up.   I am saturated with information, none of which would be particularly useful or interesting to laymen, which at present doesn't even have any concrete practical applications. And yet the fact that I've memorized so many obscure biological terms will translate into grades that will give other people the impression that I am intelligent. That I am knowledgeable. That I am wise.   Last night, as I walked towards a nearby convenience store to grab something to eat before getting back to studying, I noticed a few dark shapes stretched horizontally along a corner of the sidewalk. I knew what they were - indigents who chose that particular area to settle down for the night. They're usually thin, grimy, forlorn-looking men who wander the streets aimlessly during the day. I had long ceased to feel surprise or sympathy for their wretched condition. I ignored them the first time I passed, but when I approached the convenience store a second time, I just happened to glance at this lone figure, lying on a narrow cemented elevation in a corner, her body wrapped in a ragged blanket and her wrinkled face framed by wispy white hair.   She had the peaceful look of a person in deep sleep. Or a person who's dead. It took me a while to get over the image of that old woman in my mind, not only because I felt disgusted at a world that could reduce someone's grandmother into such a miserable state, but also because I knew that I had no way of helping her, and even if I did, I had no intention of doing so.   What do I know that really matters? I know that people often hide their true thoughts and intentions from each other, and that this is an indelible and probably essential aspect of society. I know that the people I see in the streets who stare blankly as the world passes them by are living in my definition of hell. And I know that ultimately, in a world where people like to think that compassion and decency and kindness are imperatives, it is every man for himself.   I am wise, I know, but so is everybody else.

          It might not seem real, but that is the photo of an actual pregnant woman who allowed her body to be preserved and included in an exhibit called Body Worlds. I didn't want to believe it at first, but the image does look a lot like the color illustrations I've seen in medical books. I'm not exactly sure if the exhibit is legitimate or just made up, since I read about it from a site called   urlLink Daily Rotten - News You Cannot Possibly Use  .   Still, I wouldn't mind seeing the exhibit for myself, if it really does exist. The images I've seen so far look fascinating, although somewhat disgusting. But hey, it's not as if I won't be exposed to my share of dead human bodies. And from an academic point of view, the more of them I see, the better.  You really should see the photo of people showing only their blood vessels - that one I find harder to believe to be real. I've linked the article where I got the picture - click on the title of this post to read it.

      What really works up my temper when I'm walking along the streets is when the people around me demonstrate just how immensely stupid they are by getting in my way and acting like retards (most probably are, given the amount of lead and other toxic substances they inhale each day). I have always known that people are stupid in general, and I really didn't have a problem with that. However, it's an entirely different thing when they're impeding your progress while you're in a rush to get somewhere important. Do these people lack some rudimentary portion in their brains that would have allowed them to comprehend  simple traffic rules ? Because even a two-year-old can understand the concept of  red means stop, green means go, and yellow means  slow down  . And even a two-year-old would realize that a pedestrian lane is  not  the place to board public transport or pick up passengers, especially if that two-year-old has taken and passed a driving licensure exam, which I sincerely hope applies to all drivers I encounter.  I am sick of having to put up with buses stopping their bulk in front of the pedestrian lane just when it's time for people to cross, and people jostling me aside because they're hurrying to board a jeep that's parked right on the pedestrian lane. There is no excuse for that kind of moronic behavior.  I say kill them all. Death for every offense. And if some pompous public official starts to complain, then kill him too. Our country could use any amount of population reduction we can provide. And judging by the number of public officials, if we kill them all off, well, that would be a big victory. Besides, I should reign supreme. I can certainly run things better than those blathering idiots in public office.   I just noticed. My posts seem to be getting more vindictive. Oh well. There are a lot of things to despise.

      Sometimes I have to resort to psychoanalysis to figure out why people act the way they do. Sometimes I would just like for them to shut up.

      My roommates went home for the weekend - unlike me, home for them would mean somewhere less than a thousand kilometers from here - and so, as always, I am spending my weekend alone. This time, though, I have three silent companions bundled up conveniently inside bright blue cylindrical bags, placed in various locations within the room (near the fire exit, under the microwave, under the T.V.) - one of which is Barry, the cat Julian and I skinned during class, with whom we will both undoubtedly be spending many more hours as we poke around his insides in the attempt to learn how they actually look like. I find it surprising how easily I've adjusted to the concept of examining dead animals. Although I wasn't squeamish as a kid, I never really had an interest in Biology, and I never considered dissection among the things I'd want to try doing. As far as I was concerned, dead animals belonged as far away from me as possible. What's strange is despite that general indifference I used to have, I'm actually starting to enjoy what I'm doing. And I've found myself anticipating dissecting actual human bodies, which we'll start doing around this time next year. Maybe it's because I've realized that examining the complexities of creation is one of the most concrete ways of learning about life in general, and me in particular, and might ultimately lead me closer to discovering who I am and why I exist.  Or maybe I just find it cool to cut things up and look inside them. Either way, it doesn't really matter.

      I had always known that I am, by my very nature, great and invincible. Evidently, people had already realized this fact even before my mother was born. Such is the power of greatness.

      Today I was once again struck by the many parallels between the course I'm taking and taking up witchcraft or wizardry at Hogwarts. Aside from the fact that the students of both courses take seven years to graduate, I've realized that our Zoology lab sessions are a mixture of Care of Magical Creatures, Transfiguration, and Herbology. You have to learn how to properly preserve your specimens, which constitutes the Care of Magical Creatures portion. You have to listen and be patient because sometimes, structures identified earlier turn out to be completely different - and this is sort of like Transfiguration. Also, Zoology lab tends to get really messy, just like Herbology.  With her blue lab gown billowing like a Hogwarts robe as she inspects our cat specimens, our lab instructor strikes me as a peculiar cross between Professors Sprout and Snape.  An upside to taking Humanities 1 in Filipino, which I had previously thought to be nothing but a pain in the ass, is that we have our very own stand-up comedian in the afternoons, all geared to cheer us up from another draining lab session. Today our dear teacher made a hilarious imitation of a baby crying, and the previous session he sang his very own melodramatic version of the lyrics of a preppy Ricky Martin song. Plus, every meeting we get to cool down our stinking, sweaty, formalin-drenched selves in the airconditioned classroom.  Life is getting good these days. We have another Chemistry exam coming up this weekend - I can hardly wait.

       Three facts:   Walking the streets with a deadly object in your hands apparently does not deserve the general public's attention. I was on my way to school a couple days ago when I saw this grungy-looking man heading towards me with a black bag slung on one shoulder and a snake - I repeat, a  live  snake - cradled in one hand. I looked around me and noticed that I was the only person about to freak out. So I kept my cool, sped up and swerved away from the accident waiting to happen. And I thought,  I have to watch out for more of this insanity . Just another twisted day in the nuthouse called Manila.  There is nothing better than a weekly dose of P.E. to brighten my spirits. Aside from being subjected to and being forced to come up with silly and pointless activities, I get to review my Zoology lessons as well. There was this one session when my  latissimus dorsi  ached for days, and now my  rectus abdominis  is still aching from being overworked yesterday. Thanks, P.E. You never fail to deliver.  For some inexplicable reason, the German word for the number four is pronounced exactly like the word  fear .

       A song by Arkarna.     You could be popular. You could be wanting more. It doesn't have to be that way. This could be beautiful. Are you really gonna make it happen? Seems a whisper's sometimes louder than a scream. Are you really gonna make it happen? Life is free.  You could be a checkout girl. You could be beautiful. You give your all but it's not enough. Is that just the way it is? Are you really gonna make it happen? Seems a whisper's sometimes louder than a scream. Are you really gonna make it happen? Life is free.  Keep the dream alive, don't be afraid. I'm suffering my life away. That's all I've got to say.  You can make it happen. You can make it happen. You can make it happen.

        I just got back from Davao (I'm missing my family already) and I've already got a barrage of schoolwork to attend to. There's the quiz in Zoology lab an hour from now, the exam in Humanities tomorrow, the departmental exam in Chemistry this Saturday, and God knows what else. But I really don't give a rat's ass about any of that because I got to go home and enjoy myself. Also, I rediscovered a little something I wrote back in high school that I think might help me deal with the major studying I'll have to do in the near future. It worked for me back then, and I have no doubts that it'll serve me just as well now.   There is one practice that, though generally despised, is an undeniable part of everyday living. It is the frequent companion to impossible deadlines, final examinations, and grueling research work, all of which compel the average individual to put off working on them 'just this one last time', due to the inherently dull nature of the tasks involved. As you may have guessed by now, what I am talking about here is good, old-fashioned cramming, and if you've had the assumption that any moron can go on ahead and cram, you're badly mistaken.  Cramming is an art. Despite what most people think, it takes real skill to pull off a cramming session and come out unscathed, with results that won’t get your boss to start yelling at you, or else show nice, colorful numbers on your report card. In fact, cramming entails a great deal of preparation and commitment. The world is littered with degenerates who dropped out of school or got fired from their jobs just because they didn't take the time to learn how to cram the right way. Unfortunately, there hasn’t ever been a course given on the proper way to cram, and as a dose of public service, I'll clue you in on an age-old classic: the all-nighter.  Ahh, yes: the all-nighter. What decent student can forget the first time he decided to stay up late and suddenly discovered that he had in fact stayed up so late - it was early. Early morning, that is. Just in time to grab a bite and head on to slug the daily grind to school. Just thinking about it brings me back blissful memories of the good old days… but enough about me. The fact is, the memories of all-nighters may not be so blissful for everyone. But that's okay - that's what this article is here for. I'm proud to introduce my fool-proof, hassle-free, step-by-step guide to surviving the dreaded all-nighter. Take it from me - I’m an expert. Pay attention to what I'm about to say and you just might find yourself thanking me later on.  Step 1) Arm yourself with a formidable arsenal of… well, food. Let me tell you, there’s nothing worse than being stuck in the middle of the night trying to cram buckets of semi-useless information into your head and getting a sudden urge for the munchies. It will drive you nuts. So the first thing to do is to go on ahead and gather lots of food and put them smack in the middle of your desk. Chocolate bars and potato chips are excellent for this purpose, but any sugar-rich food will do. And one more thing: don't ever, ever forget your coffee. There's nothing better to prep up a bleary-eyed, yawning, stress-ridden student than a good ole cuppa. Make sure you have lots in supply so won't have to interrupt yourself later.  Step 2) Gather the necessary materials. Hopefully you have some decent notes at hand (whether they be yours or copied off from someone else, it doesn't really matter) or at the very least your course textbook. If not, then go get them. They are absolutely important… almost as important as the food, even. I mean, how do you expect to pull off an all-nighter when you don't even have anything to study for? Once you have them, place them on your desk next to the food, or someplace where they don't get in the way.  Step 3) Now that you have all the stuff you need, it’s time to get on with the down and dirty. I'm talking about work. Yes, I know, I know, the very reason you've resorted to cramming is to avoid work in the first place, but like it or not, it has to be done. Here are a couple of pointers to help you out though. First, go over the topics you need to cover and work systematically. That way, halfway through your cramming session you won't find yourself looking up and discovering that you had not in fact covered anything at all. Second, don’t hesitate to put your entire focus on the job. Remember, your suffering will last for only a few hours, but the rewards you'll get afterwards will definitely be worth it.  Step 4) Do whatever it is you're supposed to do. If you need to take that killer math test, then do it. If you need to pass that overdue research paper, then hand it over. This step it vital. Don't ever skip it because if you do, then all the work you just did would amount to nothing.  Step 5) The test of a truly effective all-nighter lies on what happens next. Review the results of your efforts. Any grade higher than slightly above passing indicates that your all-nighter has been successful. If that’s the case, then give yourself a pat in the back. You deserve it. If, however, you failed the test, then you’d better think twice about what you did. You might have missed out on some of the techniques I elaborated on or perhaps the all-nighter may simply not be for you. Try to improve your methods of cramming and if that still doesn't work, then explore saner, safer alternatives like actually studying on a regular basis for example. The prospect may not sound so inviting but it’s better than killing yourself over studying all night.  That ends it. Hopefully you now have a better idea of what cramming is all about. Decide carefully whether it's something you want to be doing on a regular basis. And remember - just because it's a shortcut doesn’t mean that it's easy.
