      We were going to go for a barbecue tonight, but now we're not, because no one else wanted to. I ask you. Maybe it was the weather. Maybe it was because they are all lazy. Maybe its not.

      Yes. Camp was bloody good fun. Me and Vicky are now set for life with our wood-walking skills and number plate business.  The campfire was not anywhere near as good as it should have been.  Oh, and I seem to have misplaced my CD case and pass the bomb. Anger.

      Well the camp was really good. We played with rugby balls and i hit Bri in the face with a frisbee... (sorry) Genrally it was good, and not bad. Andy wrennall hared our tent last night. I am mean to have a beach party tonight. look outside, i beseech you.

      Huh?  Hmm.  I heard that Yellowcard backed out. This is a bad thing.  On that night, me and Penmo had fun scaring little children and acting like morons. It was much fun.  In about an hour I am going off to camp with Robbo and Penmo and we will have tremendous fun with Vicko and Brio (not to be confused with pens..) and whoever else who can be called "entertaining".  If they aren't as much fun as they're cracked up to be (I'll be the judge of  that ) then I'll just sit on my own playing pick-up sticks.  I am bringing pass-the-bomb with me.. That's bloody brilliant.  This is a long post. Probably because of the double linebreaks. Hohum.  Raawr!  Let's make it bigger.  Yes.

      I'm not a huge fan of travis or Keane...but I LOVE LTJ!! I went on Saturday too and it was sooo cool. Did you go crowdsurfing? Some of those security dudes were harsh, they threw some of my mates around and stole one of my mates! Capdown and the AKA's rocked too! Although I thought capdown were alot better than the AKA's, but they were really good for supporting bands. But the bad thing was I came out covered in beer, water and ice cubes down my top. But it rocked!! \m/ Anyhoo..I'll shutup now. Today I had my literature exam, it sucked monkey butt because I didn't manage to finish it all :-( it's not right that we only have 1 hour 45 minutes to write 3 essays...grrrrr! I really hope I didn't do really badly. Tonight I'm watching the last ever friends god I'm excited. I'm getting ready to cry already...and it's 3:20pm!

      Your god returns! He bears gifts from heaven!   urlLink Firefox Internet Browser   Dear lord, get it. Or I'll beat you.  Gruitt is a living legend of gruitness. He also has a girlfriend who is 2 years younger than him! Whatever floats your boat. (Bouyancy I presume)   Grindell=Yoda.  Show him respect you will.  I'll kick Vicky up the arse and make her write stuff more. Or not. She might hurt me.  *runs to the hills*

      Right. Mr Gruitt is actually Tom Gruitt, not a teacher. Briony is just... well, i'll let her speak for herself. She is an associate of me and Dave. And Vicky, but vicky has not actually written anything on here, so you don't really know her either. suffice to say ive known her for about 12 years for about 11 of which we never said a word to each other. Anyway, ive just been talking about photography with Tom, and also i can assure you that no procupines were invovled.

      Poor Rob all alone =( don't worry...I have returned to babble on and on about worthless "news". RE exam? First exam? Lad you've had it easy! We've had three exams already including our french oral exam. We've also had french listening and ICT. They're pretty easy...but then so is RE! I can't stand cricket...*gah* and this Olly lad sounds like a bit of a character! I don't know Mr Gruitt but I know copying teachers is a BAD idea (Mr Grindell influenced me to get out the razor...) if you don't know Grindy I'm sure Dave'll explain. My god I'm tired, I'll fill in another day.

One is just a scratch, but the other looks as though someone was trying to cut right through a vein. must have been olly. i always thought he was out to get me. Im not paranoid.

      I would love to come round and try out your new set. Anyway, today i sailed olly's new boat again, and it was at the same time, the most enjoyable and the most terrifying experience of my life. It is also the quickest i have ever been in a boat. My hands now hurt. RE revision will commence shortly, if anyone wants to watch. I am listening to dire straits.

Lol, Dave smacked you in the eye? was it like a girly smack? I hate being hurt in the eye, it's never FUN! I went to watch Twin Wars at the school today, two hot, sweaty extremelly attractive twins fighting each other? (Might I add they were MALE!) It was pretty damn good...

I propose we set a wild porcupine on her until she writes something. Although this isn't too practical an idea. Any more?

      Well to be fair, I don't need to pull I have a whole load of guys lined up waiting for me to go out with them. I also lie. Maybe you guys should do what most low-lifes do online and make up a whole new personality. Not that you need to...err...hmm. I'd sleep with a guy that moaned about their day because that's what you call a turn-on. We love it when guys talk dirty...

      Yeah. Pulling was the idea I had in mind when I created this. I figured that if women saw a couple of people moaning about their day they'd go "Hey, he's moaning about his day. I like to sleep with people who moan about their day."  It hasn't worked yet.

Also, i got to show off my diaboloing skills at lunchtime, and you all know how great i am. My first exam is not til tuesday, and im not on study leave yet. Grrr. Probably tomorrow.

      Phew...at least that CD mystery has been solved, I couldn't sleep at nights! :-( So yesterday was my last day at school, and they decide to give us our first exam on the first day of study leave. So instead of making excuses about no exams yet and causing chaos on the streets, we have to stay in and revise. Je ne c'est pas juste! I write so damn much everytime. I went to pizza hut last night, hurrah! And...erm...no more smelly Lee or crazy Armstrong!

My french listening exam is soon and I'm pretty darn scared. Listening to the French is never fun. I'm going into town tomorrow which I'm going to have to make the most of as I have to see my Grandma on Sunday. She's lovely but she's so slow and I'm so impatient!

      Wow, I'm part of something *wipes a tear from her eye* so, seeing as it seems to be only Dave and Rob that write on here I feel it is my duty to write as much crap on here as possible. Today was bad for me. I had history which is never good. NEVER. Well, unless it's war history or something cool like that. Today I had a thought about My Future. And the fact I'm gonig to end up in McDonalds or even worse...WIMPY! *gulp* Oh, and I had a boogie.

I have decided that at some point I may actually start doing revision at home. I also decided that nuclear weapons testing is a good idea.  Ju Jitsu, Jujutsu, Jui Jitsu etc. The fact that there's so many variations is fucking shit. And I don't mean educational.

      Yep, seagulls suck, right enough. Some guys went seagull fishing on our field at school sometime. It was funny. I would like to hit a seagull as hard as I can, and then, when all the others swoop down for the body, I would detonate it, killing them too.  BTW, sadism toward animals is wrong, don't you think?

      Gluttons of the world, i ask you: how much easier is it to cram a handful of chips into your mouth without choking than it is to eat (looks haughtily down nose) potato wedges? chips! truly english.   Chips, chips, bad for your heart  but as for wedges, where do i start?  they are bad for you in the extreme;  they'll turn your insides to clotted cream  no-one will hear your silent scream  as you eternally sleep, of chips you shall dream.  Why did i eat wedges? why oh why?  you'll sit down there and start to cry  wedges are truly traitorous  a horrible use for the honest potatorus.

      But you see, it takes more effort to wash a potato and cut it into "wedges" than it does to make a rectangle. Also, the skin is left on jacket potatoes. Anything wrong with that? Potato wedges: perfect size for eating. Also, wedges can have a variety of flavours. With chips it doesn't seem to go down as well.  There could always be a new kind of shop:  "POTATO AND FISH" , hosting all kinds of potato products, including moonshine vodka. Yum. Vodka and chips. Or wedges as the case may be.

      Well, thats as may be, but quite frankly the only purpose of the skin on a potatoe is to keep the earth out. The bit you are eating has been in direct contact with the soil, or it would have been if they were actually british, and not grown by some poor third worlder, with less income even than you. Also, i have yet to come acroos a chip that i could not fit into one mouthful. Of course, i cant be right. Because you see so many wedge and fish shops, but fish and chips... pah, its got no ring to it, you know?

      Chips better than wedges? I think you are wrong. Often, a potato wedge is better than a chip by far. Note: -The absence of potato skin on chips. This means that, not only is it better for you, but there is a holding property on the wedge found only on burnt chips, which are icky. -The "wedge" shape. Unique amongst potato based foods, the potato wedge's "wedge" shape grants consumers a far more stable structure. This means that not only is chewing more enjoyable as there is more to bite into, but also the surface means that it is better to get sauce onto.

I gave him some mini cheddars too.

      Well, today, I have done very little. I watched a film about some guys who were trapped in space and got rescued by Russians. I also gave not unconsiderable thought to how capitalist bastards are destroying hippies like myself. Admittedly I have only been a hippy for 3 days, and I don't smoke, or chain myself to trees, and casual sex... well, I just don't get the chance. But anyway, I was thinking about how we could make the insurance cheaper, and I have had the following idea, assisted by my wonderful mother. What we do is: Designate 2 drivers, and I would go for Vicky and Bri, since they are learning to drive even as we speak, but also because they have less insurance to pay because they are female, and also by the time of the trip they should, with care, have a few months of no claims too. Then we get my mum to by the insurance in her name, and nominate Vicky and Bri as drivers. We are not sure if this will work, but it might, and she has lots of no claims. This should lower the price considerably. Then, we divide the cost between everyone concerned, and life is good. After that, I may be able to foot the bill for most of the van, since this years EMA was mostly going to be saved up for a car, and a hippy van is far better. If anyone else, such as Penman actually manages to find a good job and wants to go parts with me, that's cool. Very few people could have thought this far ahead in the space of 2 days, so kudos to me for being obsessed  and  bored. What a long post that was. Apologies to anyone who this doesn't concern and just came here by accident, the rest of the blog is far more interesting, so read that. Cheers.

      I have some good and some bad news. The bad news is that i don't think we can borrow the vw. The good news is that we can buy a van for porbably under £50 each. Then we can paint it with sunflowers (yay) I admit this is a little more costly, but £50 is not that much. I may see some of you tonight, so I will talk more then. Also, my firend has a paintball gun, so we can be really  original  in our decorations. But, I don't know for sure that we can't have the VW, so we shall see.  Anyway, here is a logo I made in a moment of boredom:   Thanks to Olly for posting it, because Hello doesn't work for me.  Also look  urlLink  here  for a list of some festivals we could go to.   I am not obsessed, just bored.

      Well, today, me and the Dave's continued to hatch the daring scheme which I had on firday night.  The Gatevaulters' 2005 "Damn Vodka" tour. The DV tour will consist of the five of us  Vicky, Dave, Bri-y, Rob, (that's me folks), and Penmo.  We will go round various small music festivals and fields, in a VW campervan with lots of beer and other alcohol, being Hippies, and generally having a good time. Atm it rather dpends on me learning to drive and on something else which I can tell you but cannot write on here. Anyway, it should be a gd laugh. Start saving now, and learning to drive and other such things. We are about to venture onto the interweb to find some festivals which we can patronise. More details will follow... Money is important. Get a job if you are me, Dave, Bri, or Penmo, and get another one if you are Vicky.  PS, Carly, we have one more space for a woman on this tour. would you be interested..?

      So last night, Vicky and I went to the cinema at 'The Vue' (not Warner Village anymore folks). On the way there, we walked by some scary drunks and plenty of bastards from Plymouth, but that's to be expected when you wander through Plymouth anyway.. We got to the cinema, paid our money and went upstairs to queue for Shrek 2 in screen 9 (it starts at 8.00)  *90 minutes later, the film ends*  That film was damn good. The character depth is, once again, explosive. Puss-in-boots was a fantastic addition to the team. Usually when a character is added in a second movie, they tend to be a bit... shite. Shrek 2 kept its 'Shrek-ness' with its fairy tale gags.  All of the songs and singing worked very well. I have never heard 'I need a hero' work so perfectly :D  For the nerds: Shrek 2 kept the high standards of CG set by the original. At times you can swear it's real. The giant cookie guy (forgotten his name :S) was fantastic. Especially when he was sinking in the water.   All in all, a very good film.

      OMG, JAMIE CULLUM IS A GOD! he is sooooo damn god. Incredible. Support was good too, but the Cullumeister was just incredible!!! I loved it! It was amazing! if you ever get the chance to see him, do it! he is a legend! I am all happy, and it's all good. The intervals were a bit short though, which meant I had to down the best part of half a pint of Vodka and red bull. As Olly put it: "There's a straight line down there, and you're avoiding it at all costs."  I'm not lightweight though, no no no! Bri-y is, but that's not my problem. It was great, anyway. We stood up and clapped lots! He did high and dry, which was the most F**cking incredible thing ever. He had the whole crowd singing in three part harmony, and it sounded incredible! He kept running out ad touching a bit of carpet too, which was mental. he is a legend. I want to have his children. Yes Vicky, that means Dave is safe from me, at least for now... but as or the future, who knows? Anyway, enough of this kinda gay thing, but Jamie Cullum is a legnd. Yay! Yay! Yay! It was sooo good. And I met up with Carly, who, by pure coincidence was at the same bit of the bar as we were. Did you enjoy it CArlos? I thought it was f**cking incredible, which you may have guessed by now. Then we came back and watched the best bits of Glasto. If anyone saw Franz Ferdinand, I WANT HIS SHIRT!

      hello there! I haven't been on here for a while cos my pc has been playing up. But now 'm at Olly's house, so I'm typing form there. Anyway, last night I slid down a bank and landed (literally) flat on my face, with 11 stone of Rob behind me. It hurt, and my nose is now an interesting new shape. Admittedly, all members of this blog apart from Carly already no this, They were all there cept for Vicky, who said she wished she had been, because she is very nasty. Very nasty indeed. Horrible.   Anyway, Bri-y's frisbee throwing abilities have increased supremely, even with her dislocated elbow, which I am sympathetic about, even if people like Vicky aren't, because she is nasty. Very nasty. Nasty as hell. And that's pretty nasty. Anyway, Jamie Culum tonight! Woooo! Yay! If I see you there Carly, I will buy you a drink, because I am nice.

      Hello, I'm here to moan. I HATE THE PROM! God it's awful, and I haven't even been yet! I have a crappy dress I really do not like, I have to buy bloody heeled shoes and some dinky bag. I can't do it. Ok, I'm not some kind of tomboy-girl but I'm certainly not a girly girl and this prom is doing my nut. I'd rather have the money from this prom and go get myself a new phone or an MP3 Player (I could probably get both looking at the cost of all this)! Now, ok, it was my choice in the first place whether I went or not. But they are so good at persuading you - for a short amount of time you think it' will be great so you hand in all your money and grin for hours. The suddenly you realise, you're going to end up killing yourself. I'm just looking for the alcohol provided at my friends house before and after the prom. Boo hoo hoo! :(

      So, hello. It's me...grooowl. So a run down of todays events: 1) I woke up, ate, had a shower and headed to school for my history exam. The history exam was piss easy because it was a source paper and there wern't too many questions unlike last time >:( ! 2) I went to see Mr Mathieson (or however its spelt) to get my sixth form induction sheet. Yeh thats right! I'm going to sixth form! ^.^ Hoorah! But now I'm not sure if I want to do french or not. Maybe I'll do biology? 3) I went to Pete's house (as if you all know him...) with Brownie, Dave, Kirsten and Steve. I don't like Steve much. We then travelled to Daves house to retrieve my monkey hoody...and then to Steves to check his dog wasn't dead ;) 4) We all went into plymouth, managed to get child tickets and headed to subways (mmmmm!) we then went about the shops and I got mocked for working in freezeways :( argh! 5) We went to the guitar shop and I sat there all jealous and grumpy 'cos I can't play. I really wish I could, I must learn. But first I must find enough money to pay for my guitar...and my new phone...and my MP3 player...and my Green Day T shirt. Life is SOOO unfair! - Kevin stylee 6) Came home, and wrote on here.  Now, I know that wasn't interesting but I'm bored as fuck, so live with it!

      I am lovely and Yayish again now. Listening to happy music has cured my depression. Yay! I am saying that a lot now. Some may say it is camp, but not to my face. And besides, it is no more camp than my shirt, the one with the pink stripes. Only 2 exams left now! Nearly there!

      Time to write some more stuff. Yesterday, Vicky and I walked the dogs. My dog surprised me. For some reason, she stayed next to me most of the time, wasn't too badly behaved and was just generally unusual.. Very odd. It was really weird when a very old dog with scabies or something, wandered past and the dogs went ballistic. Very odd.  Tomorrow I am going up to Waitrose for a job interview. (Wai'rose) Hopefully, tomorrow I will walk out of Waitrose with a job. I very desperately need it; I'm getting fed up of mooching off my parents. I also want to learn to drive, but I want to pay for lessons myself. Dilemma indeed..  Today, I had one lesson because I'm dropping maths and my sociology teacher went on an art trip... :| Right now, I'm listening to Franz Ferdinand and eating lollipops. Hurrah!

      Had no sleep last night, and three science exams this morning. What a great combo that was. I am pissed off with boats. Just as Penman is getting used to how to sail it, and I am too, it fucking breaks  again . Oh well. I  hate science, but if I have passed them, I have just done my last ever peace of science. Yay! Kind of yay anyway, cos if I fail I have to retake them. Cue ppl saying, it'll be fine and I won't fail. God I am pissed off with exams. Grrrr! Damn them into hell, or hades or some other rather unpleasant place. Birmingham, for instance.

      Today I had my Home Economics exam. Simple pimple. I then went to find out if the school had got off their arse to get the bastard who stole my mobile phone. The receptionist looked nervous and told me she'd ring me at 11.30am, it is now nearly 3pm and she hasn't called. Grrrr! So anyway I'm grounded (stupid time and it's stupid...time) so I'm sat here in my duvet wishing my life away...  I need some non-kinky entertainment right now...

      This morning I had breakfast at 12:15, which was in fact the aftrenoon. it was, however, almost exactly 12 hours after I went to sleep.  Hooray. My dad is just making me some cofee. What a nice chap he is.  Anyway, I noticed this morning, that since I put my hotornot pic on here, my rating has gone from 8.9 to 7.7. I do not know who I have to thank for that, but I  will  slap them. They clearly don't like Orlando Bloom. God I am rambling. I should really stop now, but when I do, I will have to start revising, so I'll keep on a bit longer.  In 48 hours  I will have just 1 exam left. Yay! Here are my exams: Tuesday morning: Seperate Sciences Wednesday Morning: History 2 Tuesday afternoon: RE that is a total of 4 hours left. Thats all! Yay! Woo! etc.   Thank you for taking the time to read all that. I appreciate it.

      I prodded Dave! ^.^ right in the arm!! thats the most exciting thing I did all day as I had to work...OH DEAR GOD! I really was not made to earn a living. I work in the new Freezeways shop in Fore St. I have to work on my own with a bunch of old people who want cheap frozen goods. gah! It was so boring and so hot and I had to tidy and do boring, boring things. I love to rant! Also, my boss is a mixture of David Brent and Wallace from Wallace and Gromit. It cracks me up! so anyway life is boring at the moment. My mobile phone got stolen :-( I can't remember if I told you guys before but I'm SOOOOO annoyed!!! Damn Saltash Community school bastards. I cried - and I NEVER cry! Sorry I'm blabbing, but, shush. There are some really good films coming out which I must see at some point - Shrek 2, Garfield the movie (he rocks ok!!), Spiderman 2 (better be better than the first) and Thunderbirds the movie (come on, you can't say your not a little tempted?) Oh and one final point. I HATE THE BLACK EYED PEAS!!!! ARRRGRRHHGHHHHH! Au revoir

      I am also not hungover! No surprises there.  I can honestly say that I am not going to be going to bed at 2.30 ever again; I don't go to sleep until about 4-5 o'clock. For shame.  I am still waiting to see this reminder that Vicky put on my phone last night (I haven't looked yet!) and really can't be bothered to eat anything.. Damn alcohol.  In other news, I managed to actually tell my dog to bring me a lollipop about 10 minutes ago. How good is that? She didn't refuse to give it to me or anything! Now I just have to get her to bring me drinks.. ¬_¬  Also, now that I have my computer back, you can all start sending me stuff. Like photos :D

      Yay! I'm not hungover! Woooo! I have mysteriously cut my knee though. Last night was very good. We filled a water cooler with beer, but Vicky would not let me drink out of the tap. Grrrr. Anyway, It was good. Briony is clearly the legend of Twister. (she actually fell over  before we started and that takes skill) Hope your parents don'tread this though Bri...   Also, what the hell is up with John Smith's? It has one of them widget things in it, so the can froths all over the place, and then when you drink it, the first 2 inches or so is head. It's ridiculous.  Ho hum. I'm going out now, so I will see you all later. It's raining.  Oh and kudos to me for writing so much so early in the morning.

      Hello party people in the house, as some kinda rapper probably once said. Me and Penmo went sailing this morning, and it was very fun. The boat broke a bit, but we'll fix it. It was soooooooo fast. we only capsized 5 times though!  Tonight I will drink a fair bit, and I have eaten little all day, so it could be quite interesting.

      What's that sound? Could it be cheering? I hear a celebration!  Yes! That's right folks, I'm back!  No more boring evenings without me!  The full blogging team!  And best of all!  Lots of linebreaks.  What have I done this week? Sat in a boring house mostly. Monday was the first day back at school. I was not happy.  On tuesday I went up to aylesbury to see my brother's RAF passing-out parade. It was good. There was a nice travel inn that we (me and my family) stayed in the monday night. We had a nice meal and there was this huge dessert thingy! Yum. Ultimate Chocolate Challenge, I salute you.  Wednesday I was back at school again and at Ju Jitsu, as he has already said, I nearly killed Rob! Take that you bastard! Or, y'know, don't.  The rest of this week I have been thinking about dropping Maths and picking up Art or Psychology. Both would be fun.  Party tonight at Bri's house. I don't know where it is! Huzzah! Vicky's hand will guide me true.   Is this a long post? Yes. Is it because of the double line breaks? Yes. Do I care? Not a great deal, no.  Yum.

      Last night I had JuJitsu. Dave threw me badly, I landed badly, and almost died. My eyes stopped working and so did my breathing. Remember this, people; Breathe out when you hit the floor.  Aside from that, I have 4 exams left, Namely RE, Science, History, and RE. Damn catholic schools. My last exam is a week on tuesday, and I will slap anyone who takes the piss because they finished before me.  Wow, three sections to this post. I am going to see Jamie Cullum live at the pavillions a week on Friday. He is so good. (I will also slap anyone who takes the piss out of Jamie Cullum.) Then my exams finish on tuesday, and it's time for me to go sailing, everyday, 9-5. While you damn As people are still in school.  HAHA . Apologies to Vicky, That laugh was mainly aimed at Bri. Even though she was actually quite sympathetic last night when I told her Dave almost killed me. So, I am sorry. I take back that laugh. It was nasty. Bad Rob...

      Yesterday I played football. Thats right..I..played..football! I surprised myself. Obviously I wasn't good at playing football, but it was fun until I cut my leg. Ouch. A "male friend" of mine went away this morning to France :( damn France, they take everything! Its going to be weird not talking to him every night and now I'm feeling kinda lonesome *looks around for sympathy...gah!* But anyhoo, today I've been revising out in the sun for my darned science exam tomorrow. I've never really been able to REVISE so to speak, I've merely just skipped through the pages and remembered random sentences such as "polar bears have large paws to spread out on the ice and snow". Maybe this is why I suck. Wish me luck for tomorrow *laughs nervously*

      This morning I am ok, But my lungs hurt and I can't breathe properly. I have had this problem for about 6 years, for those of you who didn't know, and it is really starting to piss me off.  On to more pleasant things... I have roast chicken for lunch today.

      Okay. So last night went off without a hitch. We probably should have played far more games than we did, and getting more drunk would have been a bonus. But I had fantastic fun so I say it was successful  Rob throwing up was funny though. And the smelly place was cool. And skipping around is always entertaining.  There's plenty of leftovers too. Yum.

      Well, today we all went into town, or some of us did. We bought many things! Briony said several amusing things too, such as "let's go away from the dead people" and also the title. I got both Bri-y and Dave birthday presents. Dave chose his. Bri has no idea about hers. Hehe.

      Sooo I haven't written for a while (or maybe you all just write too much!) I haven't got alot of news so it'll just be the normal blab... Last night me and and my friends had a BBQ on chapel field with some drink...well maybe alot of drink. I pleasantly enjoyed it. Well...until I fell into a bush of stinging nettles with my friend Pete. Yeah, we're in pain...it's not funny! What else? Ohh..I'm still doing the ol' GCSE's. You know what? In the past 5 years I think I've meant to be learning about all the religions out there. I still know nothing about any of them. So anyway, basically, I failed my RE GCSE *laughs inside* yeah...maybe I'll regret that. But I have history coming up which is quite worrying because I want to do well in that...A* people!! And someone said something about penis enlargements?? I think I'm going to need that...(don't ask) Anyhoo there is your blab, I'll have a whole bunch of additional blab for next time Warly xx

      I am lazy. So here is what I wrote somewhere else. Hey, it fills up the page.  Let's get some more ska here shall we?   Ska:   SHJUSA  ... ... ... ... (As already mentioned. I love them to death.)  Save Ferris  ... ... (Dermot O' Leary was wearing a t-shirt this morning. Hmm)  The Toasters  ... (Yum. Talk Is Cheap makes me leap. Heh. Rhyme.)  Ska-P  ... ... ... ... ... (for Cannibis mostly.. crazy Spaniards)  The Hippos  ... ... (Though they seem really "skatey", they're quite catchy.)  Sublime  ... ... ... ... (Oooh. Versatility! Though most of it's ska, they have other stuff too. Sexy, no?)   Other stuff that's fun:   The Donnas  ... ... (E2: "They're called a metal-inspired punk band and a classic rock and roll band." All women? Yes. Live with it. They're hot and good.)  Elastica  ... ... ... ... (Anybody here who says Connection is rubbish can burn in a fucking hole.)  Yellowcard  ... ... ... (Not a lot of bands have violinists. Yellowcard do. I like them. Powder. Mmm.)  [spunge]  ... ... ... ... (There are a lot of square brackets on this forum, so embrace [spunge]. Where the hell did you think I got my name from anyway?)  Monster Magnet  ... (Maybe they aren't everybody's cup of tea, but Heads Explode makes me laugh. Powertrip just makes me go "woooh".)

      I just had maths. It was not too bad, I think I got about 60%. Isnt it terrible when you come out of an exam thinking "well that wasnt too bad" and everyone else is like "Omg, that was crap" and you're thinking... I must have got it all wrong. This is not a good thing. Still, I only have 20 mins of exams tomorrow. then i will do something else. God knows what... just hope my dad lets me go to ju jitsu in the evening. Good god, that was the most boring post i have ever written.

      *gasp*  I finally got round to posting! It took a whole night for me to feel like doing it, but I'm doing it again. Take THAT, Rob.  What's this? Films? Well, guess what I've heard! A new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film! The old one is rubbish.. In this new one, Johnny Depp stars. Hurrah! We like him. He acts like some kind of good actor or something. Tim Burton directs! Sha-pow! Do I think it could be a good film? Yes. It could be the best film ever if the A-Team appeared though. "I'll just have a glass of milk, foo'" AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA DO YOU SEE? MR. T!  Ahem.  What other films... I look forward to The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy too. It looks like it'll be good maybe if possibly it works just a little bit well.  Shaun of the Dead is your god. It is quite possibly one of the best films I've ever seen. Though the Matrix still has a special slot in my heart.  Bruce Almighty should have been better. (They used up all the good jokes in the trailer really..)  Hannibal is fucking weird. (Puffy men and people eating their own brains.. You tell me that that's a normal film..)

      I've never heard of new found glory. Would I like them? The BBQ was good :-) not much news there to be honest. But...today I went to see Harry Potter with my friends Joe, Tim and Andy. I was yet again disappointed. It might be because I think the books are over-rated but meh. Ok, actually, I think it is the acting. God that Daniel Radcliffe can't act for his life. I have to say he has improved slightly but I still want to steal his big thickly-rimmed glasses and play Harry myself. It frustrates me! Also, the guy that plays Ron. I have to say he was pretty good in the first two films he over-acted at just the right time. But in this film he does it constantly.  The direction was better though, thanks to the new dude. He should re-do the first two films again that direction really did need improving. They should replace Harry potter too! The guy that plays Sirious Black was great though! in fact, fantastic! Maybe he jsut made everyone else look shit? Oh well.

      Today i discovered something that i had long forgotten about: New found glory. Those of you who know me may think this is not my kind of music, and those of you who don't may also think it out of pure spite. Anyway, i like them, and the next time i get some money, I will get one or more of their albums. Or maybe I won't there are only 2 songs that ive heard, after all.

I am sure i am justified when i say that I think this is  shit . Anyway, today, I will revise, and other things. I do not feel like it, but it must be done. Geography, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Can it get any worse?

What do you think my weakness is? 9. Whoo you think I'll get married to? 10. Where do you see me in 10 yrs time? 11. What do you think is my ideal occupation? 12. What reminds you of me? 13. If u could give me anythin, what wud it be? 14. When's the last time you saw me? 15. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 16. Describe me in one word. 17. Do you think our relationship is getting stronger, weaker, or staying the same? 18. If it were to 2 b da last day of my life..wad wld b da last thing u wanna tell me  Seriously, why do people have time to writ this kinda crap?

That means keeping my revision notes by my side at all times but kind of forgetting they're there. Oh well. Tomorrow I'm going to my mates birthday BBQ/Partay. The problem is it's a birthday and I don't know what to get him. Plus...it's TOMORROW! any ideas? I'd be very, very grateful! poor you Dave...get well soon!

But when my mum saw me she instantly asked if I was unwell, because I had funny coloured skin or something.  Damn vodka. Damn it to hell!

      Ok. Last night, I feel, went very successfully. I can't for the life of me remember how much I drank; I wasn't keeping track. Though, judging by the bottles on the floor, I must have drank a fair bit. The worst bit for me was when I got into bed though. That's when the vodka kicks in and I start rolling around all dizzy. Then about an hour after I threw myself towards the toilet to chuck it all out again.  Lush.  Damn vodka..  Rob sent me interesting texts. "Ok. In away now in tryna sleep", "Im ducked. You shoulda got pissed.", "I finl in ripped ignore o."  I think he was pissed.

      Gosh. That's a lot of posts. Last night I  did  go to Jujutsu. It was very exhausting. Especially after putting up tents all day. Then afterwards I went to a party. There was not nearly enough alcohol as I returned home sober. Once again. Though there was a guitar to entertain myself with.. If only the alcohol hadn't nulled my senses enough to make me forget how to play everything I know. I have trouble remembering without being intoxicated.

Kat could never really bothered and her lack of effort was getting me down. Really down. Anyhoo, today I revised science and let me tell you that there are 23 pairs of chormosomes in each cell, and in each gamete (sex cell) there are 23 chrosomes. Interesting huh? I also went to my local (crappy) youthclub and...well...blabbed on for rubbish for hours. Life is good, life is fine.

      Hey hey kids! I am saying that sort of thing a lot these days. I will stop, unless anyone likes it.  Anyway, I have Ash's new album, and it is absolutely great! Buy it, or you shall perish! Ahahaha!  I also have the audiobully's album, but I don't expect you to have heard of them, because you think dance is $hit. (VICKY!) ahem.  That is good too. I also got the last Discworld Novel that I haven't read, and one of those cool  urlLink  Airzooka  things. It is very cool, but my dog doesn't like it.     In 2 days The Daves (like the hives, only different) and myself are off to Campedowne, which I cannot spell. There we will scuba dive, mong, talk and miss you all terribly. For those of you who wish to get in touch, our mobiles will be turned on on the evening, but not anytime else to conserve battery. If we do not reply, assume one of the following:       We have no battery left     We have no credit left     We are dead         Our phone has been stolen     We hate you (only joking, hahahahaha! Had you for a minute, but I can see we didn't fool you really, you canny bugger. :-D)    Anyway, you will be without us for 9 days! NINE WHOLE DAYS! We will miss you all terribly, and I'm sure you will pretend to miss us too.    Rob  xXx      <>

      Yesterday me and the Penmeister fixed my broken boat. Today, we sailed it. And... IT DIDNT BREAK!!! I cannot tell you how happy I am about that. It was a good sail too, nice and fast, although my shorts kept falling down. Ho hum. The water was quite warm, and we only capsized 4 times, Penmo geting through 3 of them without getting wet except for his feet, and I did the last one, without getting wet at all. It was good.    On the way home we bought some skittles, and I had a haircut. Yay! It's all short now. Or shorter, anyway.

      Ode to Carly    Carly is a wildchild,  Or so it seems to me.  Certainly she's grounded now,  So that is it, surely.    I've known her now for 10-odd years,  With a 5 year gap somewhere.  She say's I rode her scooter once.  I'm sure I wasn't there.    This is the last gatevaulter Ode,  Unless we add another,  But why would we do that? Don't know.  The reasons undercover.    Hooray!

      When was the last time i posted more than once in a day? (it was saturday, btw)  Anyway, today i went to work and had to demolish an ex-smoking room. It was the most nauseating smell imaginable. I almost threw up several times. But in the end it was ok, and next week I get to drive this big sit on floor sweeper thing, which is cool. I got paid as well.    One week til campdowne! And I'm not even excited yet, because I don't know what to expect. Anyway, I should go now. No reason why, I have nothing else to do, but I'll go anyway.     Actually, I've had a great idea for a feature:    Who knows what this holiday may bring?  Possibilities:  I will get a girlfirend.    Penmo will get a girlfriend. (this is almost certain, since he tends to pull at jamborees, usually someone who he has no hope of ever seeing again. A weird guy, this one. I'm not intending to pull at an international camp, cos I'll never be able to see them again. This is logic which penmo would do well to consider.)    Dave will get sued for £2000 by an irate farmer.    Penmo will get sued for £2000 by an irate farmer.    I will get shot by an irate farmer. (I tend to have the worst luck around)    Vicky will take up bull fighting while in spain, become a famous matador, and never return.    Bri-y will not get pissed. (Unlikely this one, since my birthday is going to be during the holidays... Oh, and she is unbelievably lightweight, that too.)    Dave will form the Dave Thomson band.    Carly will be allowed back on the computer.    I will stay sober. (no comment)    Penmo will ask every fouteenth girl he meets to put him on a lead and drag him around, and every second guy.(seriously, this could happen)    I could take the record for the longest post.(MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)    Emily Jayne Harris (that is a very Jane ustin- pride and prejudice-esque name, which is why I keep typing it in full) might actually make herself a profile for blogger.    I will buy some CD's (this is really quite likely)    Dave will eat some chocolate whilst standing upside-down in a bucket    I will get bored of writing what will happen to people I know.    I might have too much time on my hands.    Vicky will pass her driving test.    We will be able to go to see  urlLink Keane  as a driect result (yay!) (I LOVE Keane!)    I will stop witing now. (That is quite likely)

      Helllooooo people! This is just a quick message to say goodbye, well for 2 and a half weeks anyway! Last day of school today - yay! Then&nbsp;I leave for spain tonight, at 11pm to be exact, on a ferry from Plymouth. Tomorrow I will be in a car in France and the next day, or maybe the day after that I will arrive at a campsite near Madrid - Spain - yay!!! I will be returning on the 8th of August, or the Sunday of that weekend anyway, after 2 and a half weeks of sun :o) I shall see you all again then! Enjoy your holidays/camps and take lots of photos for me to look/laugh at, I'll do the same! :o)  Bye bye for now  P.s.

Apparently it's really hot. Olly got sunburnt anyway, and he's well 'ard.    Q.What do you call and aardvark who's just beaten up another aardvark?    A. A well 'ardvark.

      Ode to Penmo    Penmo is a funny guy;  I look at him and laugh.  He's looking for a job right now,  On apple' westward's staff.    He likes to wear a lead sometimes,  He is a masochist.  Take last night, for example;  He wasn't even pissed!    In a camp shirt he looks the part,  And he can sail too.  I do not think that he'll read this,  But hey, what can you do?    Carly is next!

      Okay, I'm going to double post (and maybe triple post because I have cool photos!) The reason? I need to show off about my recent holiday to both Egypt and Cyprus and ask about Dave and Rob smelling each other? My holiday was ammmaaazing! We went to Egypt on a cruise firstly, then we spent a day in Egypt, visited 3 pyramids, The Sphinx, The Egyptian Museum and some real live(?) Mummies. Then we spent the rest week and a half causing chaos in Cyprus (we = me and Kirsten). In Egypt I got my first wedding proposal. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting but jus as I was happily buying some papyrus some boring Egyptian dude came up to me like a schoolgirl and asked if I wanted to be his friends wife. When I said no he asked if I would wave at him, or marry his other friend. It was oh so romantic...damn Egyptians and they're vast amount of wives!! I also rode a camel (life dream succeeded...), went paragliding and snorkelling. In fact, I did loads. This meant no time for tanning (well, thats my excuse). Oh oh and we got beaten up by young german kids who thought it'd be funny to pull at our bikini strings. It really wasn't funny. Oh God...(typical Germans!) Anyway, I don't care if this is really long because I've been blog-deprived for three  WHOLE  weeks! So now I'm back I'm going to learn to play the guitar and go bodyboarding as much as possible :-D Anyway, I'll shush and post photos because I'm silly like that. Oh, and going on holiday means I must be forgotten? I'd like an ode (maybe a shorter one, we don't have many private jokes :-( ) Oh and decision time should I take either politics or history for A Levels?

       urlLink Blogger Help : What is BlogThis! ?   OK. So last night, a group of us went bowling. The group was Vicky, me, Bri and Dan. We were unable to get a lane when we arrived (about 7) so we had to go for 8.30. It cost us, collectively, almost £30. To pass the time, we played pool, air hockey and a couple of arcade games. Actually, I think it was just the one.. But never mind. Bri and Dan won the pool, but Vicky and I came close! Then on the air hockey, Vicky won against Bri, and Dan only  just  beat me :P  Then it was about 8.30. We went to our lane (7) and discovered some foreigners had jumped onto it. Obviously, they were french. Once that problem was sorted we started bowling.  I can't be bothered to run through the  entire  game, but the best moment was probably the very end. Remember how if you get a spare or a strike on your last bowl, you go again to see what the score will be? Vicky got a strike. So she bowled again, and got another strike. So she bowled again, and got  another  strike! Go Vicky!  Then we all missed a couple of busses, but that's not really exciting. Except the AMAZING sounding jam band in some pub.. I wish we had time to go in there... *sigh*  So what else can I blabber on about? I am officially working at Waitrose. Expect me to be able to do things such as:  Buy things Not scab money off my parents  Isn't that good? I have a green shirt, a tie (clip-on, even though I asked for a real one) and soon I will be getting another shirt and some trousers. I need though, to get some "polishable" black shoes. Fun.  What else? My parents are going up to my sister's house today. I didn't want to come so I'm at home. Alone. All alone. So alone...  Hmm. This post isn't long enough yet... Let's make up random crap. Today, out of my window in my back garden, I heard a funny noise. I went out there to find out if it was one of those rowdy boys. It turns out that it was my neighbour, Peter, who was holding onto a Flux Capacitor. It turns out that he built a time machine, like in some movie I've seen, and he said, "Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul!" Please forgive me for combing Tenacious D with Busted. I deserve to die. How the hell did  Busted  get to do the soundtrack for Thunderbirds?! Why the hell do kids today know about Thunderbirds? It should be designed exclusively for people who are old enough to appreciate Thunderbirds. Damn Busted.  That's long enough. Yes.

That really was unkind of me  I should not have said it  I am sure she can spell really  If there's someone to edit.   She's going out with Dave right now,  I think they're good together  It is, perhaps, a shame, because  They can't control the weather.   Dunno if I should do one for Penmo, cos he's not actually on here, and Carly is in cyprus, so we'll see.

       This is a news update in a random font thing.  I have the tickets. They were ordered today. £13.50 each. I am looking into the whole transport thing, and Bri's parents are right in that we will need to find somewhere to stay. I have briefly looked into this, but my sister says she knows somewhere, so we'll see. It may not be necessary anyway, and time will tell. Anyway, we have the tickets.   In other news, Me and Penmo sat outside waitrose earlier and ate waffles and crumpets respectively. That was just after Dave had gone up to do his training. How did it go Dave?

Always with a smile, Or possibly a frown, He'll go that extra mile To stop you feeling down.  He knows exactly what he thinks, He'll tell you at great length. He's pulld me back from several brinks With his almighty strength.  Im going to write one of these for everybody, so there.

       urlLink Blogger Help : What is BlogThis! ?   Ok. It seems to be a habit of mine to use BlogThis!, but I feel it's much more convenient than going ALL the way into the dashboard, then ALL the way to the create posts page.  So what happened during  Industry Day ? We were put "in charge" of setting up some holiday resort in France. We had to manage finances, location, staff, marketing and some other, even MORE boring things. All in all, the day kept me occupied, but it was  dull ...  So what else happened? I went to Ju Jitsu and threw some people around a bit and learnt something that's very confusing. Go me.  What else? Today, I woke up nice and late, because I only have one lesson. Unless you count careers, but I didn't bother going, so I don't. I should probably use all the free time I have to write up my work experience report, but I really, really don't want to. This probably makes me seem very lazy, so I will disprove these false assumptions by saying that I've both hung up washing AND emptied the dishwasher. So there.  On Saturday, Vicky and I are bowling with Dan and Bri. We will beat them because we're really, really good. Professional bowlers envy our elite bowling skills! That could just be a filthy, dirty lie, but we'll try our best!  Hmm. This post isn't quite long enough yet. The Goo Goo Dolls are really very good, I do not enjoy eating fish, British spies did not really have a clue or, too many reliable clues - about Saddam's infamous weapons of mass destruction, raspberry jam is not as good as strawberry, the pope has announced that he is flying to the moon in August, and I have recently acquired a brand new combine harvester, I doubt anybody will mind terribly much if I give you the key, come on everybody, let us have a social gathering and live and work together in some form of perfect harmony.  Thank you, and good night.

       urlLink Blogger Help : What is BlogThis! ?   I'm using BlogThis! again. It is cool. I like to leave the link at the top there so everyone can use it. Aren't I kind? (Entirely rhetorical. Don't answer.)  Rob told me to blog. So I am.  Look! Blog! Isn't that great?  What's going on then? Tomorrow, I have an "Industry Day", where I get to spend the whole day in school doing... Hell, I don't even know what it's meant to be. What a load of shit. What's that Mr. Mathieson? I just suffered the most boring week of my 6th form life and now you're telling me I have to do even more shit? Thanks a fucking lot.  What else? I'm bored. I had a bacon sandwich earlier on. I liked it.  What else? I had some skittles earlier too. They were also nice.  What else? Somebody phoned me lots of times. And my house too. If you wish, I will tell you the number and you can see if you know who it is. It is very disturbing.  What else? I have induction training at Waitrose on friday. That should be fun. Once I start, I will be on £3.90 an hour, thursday and friday nights. Plus, if I do overtime I get more money. PLUS, if I work on sundays I get "time-and-a-half", meaning I get all the money I earn that day plus half again, in case you didn't know.  Anything else? No? Good. That's quite long enough. Congratulations for surviving my post. I like them long, as you can tell.

      Here are some pics fromlast night:    Bri-y looking surprised.    Penmo building, with vicky and dave in the background.    Bri-y looking pissed. What a surprise.    Me looking either pissed (which I sooo wasn't) or in tears of joy. Who can tell? And don't you just love my shirt?

      Ode to Briony   Bri is very lightweight  She is a subtle thief  She can get in such a state  On just a single reef!   She'll sit down at a party  She'll get all settled down  When playing complex card-games  With concentration she will frown.   Very multi talented  Video extroadonaire  If she can't film it, no one can  She doesn't have black hair.  hehe Rob  Hope you all enjoyed that. I was bored.

      Tomorrow sees a momentous occasion.  We've been waiting for it for many hours.  Dave and myself will leave you tomorrow for a two day expedition of some of the most extreme terrain ever seen on Bodmin Moor.  Preparations have begun. Even as I write, I'm eating spaghetti bolognese.  We will be offline for almost 36 hours.  And we won't be able to reply to your texts. (Dave couldn't anyway cos he has no credit)  So, if, in our absence, you pine for our company...  Tough. We are not here.  (PS, I don't think anyone has   ever  pined for my company, but nm.)

       urlLink Blogger Help : What is BlogThis! ?   I am posting this with BlogThis! It's a very cool idea.  In other news, terrorists invaded Antigua today and I had to ask for directions, but the ticket only cost a pound so that's all right, provided the Loch Ness monster doesn't knock me into the water.  In other news, I have finished work experience. It was a very boring week. I now have to write a log about it. Lame. Maybe I'll go completely over the top and include pictures and all sorts. Just so the  fat cats  have to read through all of it. That'll learn them for making me do stuff I don't want to do.. On seconds thoughts, that's far too much effort, even if it would teach them a thing or two about  respect .  In other news, I hope this DofE expedition Rob and I are going on is cancelled. I don't want to go. I'm forced to borrow Penmo's bag because my brother has mine and he is in some place.. Antigua or Fiji or something.  In other news, I should stop doing this.  Yes. So I'm still trying to figure out the easiest way to edit the blog's appearance without putting in immense amounts of effort. I should probably update  urlLink my website  too.  I think I'll listen to Livin' La Vida Loca again. It makes me laugh. Whoooooosh.  Loooooooooong post. I like these. It makes me feel superior to inferior Rob, who posts little short ones every day.  QUALITY NOT QUANTITY.  Yeah. Word up, yo yo yo. Ok. So that last bit was a load of rubbish and, indeed, so is this. But I don't care. I have written a nice long post.

      Today I wasn't bored. Yes, that's right, I wasn't bored. Incredible, no? Anyway, I built myself some new CD shelves, and put my TV back in my room. (yay!).   Anyway, I had an idea spawned by Dave's previous post, which was this: What is the greatest song in the world?   Place your comments now!  Also, It won't let me comment on dear Bri-y's post below, so I'll just edit this post to include it: How dare you? I am not stupid. My mind runs just as quickly as anyone elses, although sometimes in the opposite direction. Thank you.   Commenting's fine now ~Dave

      Rob has posted too much. He has too much time on his hands. Let's help him out here.  I now present you with:   List Of Things To Do When You Are Very, Very Bored   1. Invent new ways of dancing. Turning ordinary tasks into robot style dances are tremendous fun (I draw your attention to microwaving things, or eating noodles)  2. Construct elaborate buildings using only matchsticks/toothpicks/lollysticks or a combination of all of those.  3. Write bizarre poetry involving some sort of action hero, fighting hard against the opressive dictators of the world in a desperate attempt to liberate his wife from their vile clutches and once more keep the world safe from the foul, corrupt, communistic government of the nazi-commie-fascist rulers.  4. Compose the greatest song in the world.  5. Write obscure lists.  6. Rip-off the same "Write obscure lists" gag that has been used in almost every single 'things to do when you are bored' list ever contrived.  7. Make an "obscure list" post your own by making a joke about how it's been done before.  8. Cook fish.  9. Try very hard to fill in 10 points of "Things To Do When You Are Very, Very Bored" lists.  10. Shutup.

      I have just been to see Shrek 2. It was quite good. I haven't actually seen the first one yet, but nm, it was still good. The bit after the credits was good too. In fact, the whole ting was good. Yay! Especially Puss in Boots.  In other news: I am bored now. I have Ju jutsu tonight. I bought a drink from the Co-op in the barbican, and they were on BOGOF, so I got an extra one too. I also ahd fish and chips for lunch, but they lacked something in the salt and vinegar department. Now, I think the last 4 posts on heere are from me, so will someone else   please  write somehing?

Anyway, Bri-Y now has broadand, and, since it's by BT, that makes us BT Broadband Buddies. Yay! This also means that she can post on here a lot more. Yay!

      Yesterday, most of all of us went to mount Edgecumbe, where we variosly attempted to knit and make wheels. Bri-y rolled down a hill in a survival bag, and I have a video of it. She also got stuck in a tree, and I have pictures of that too. Then we had a barbecue, and I ate what turned out to be a raw chicken burger, but it was nice. Then we went down the park afterwards, where we smelt each other, and apparently, I smell the nicest! Yay! Then Bri-y did Me and Penmo's hair for us. What fun it was.

      Today, I am bored. But I'm going sailing later, so that should be ok. This morning, I went shopping with my dad. I got some stuff to stop me from biting my nails. Yay stopping biting nails! Also, I found out last night that Bri didn't think we could do the tour. She said she couldn't see it happening. We'll show her. Grrr. I give you all permission to do horrible things to me if we don't.   Me and Penmo, having been forsaken by everyone else, stood around in the rain planning last night. We have decided that the VW must be called something. So far, we have thought of Alice, Georgina, and Daisy. If anyone else has any ideas, please put them in a comment.

      hmm. think il rite sumthin intrestin cos i havnt ritten nethin for a while. so here goes.     Albert Einstein wurde am 14 März 1879 in Ulm, in Deutschland geboren. Sechs Wochen später ist seine Familie nach Munich umgezogen, und Einstein ist zum Luitpold Gymnasium gegangen. In 1901 hat er seinen Diplom gewonnen, und dann in 1905 hat er seinen Grad gewonnen, und ist Wissenschafter bekommen.  Er hat Mileva Maric in 1903 verheiratet, und hat eine Tochter und zwei Sohnnen gehabt, aber in 1919 hat er sich scheiden lassen. Er hat seine Kusine im gleichen Jahr verheiratet.  In 1916 hat er seine Arbeit über die Allgemeine Relativitätstheorie veröffentlicht. Diese ist vielleicht die größte theoretisch-wissenschaftliche Leistung, die je einem einzelnen Menschen gelungen ist. Während dieser Zeit hat er zu den Problemen von der Theorie von Strahlung und statistischer Mechanik beigetragen. Während seines Lebens hat Albert Einstein viele ehrenhalbe verliehene akademische Grade in Wissenschaft, Medizin und Philosophie aus vielen amerikanisch und europäischen Universitäten gewonnen. Er ist am 18 April 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey gestorben.  yeah, i feel beta now. ahh.

      Right, here is todays DV tour update. My mum spoke to the guy she knows, who said that we could not get a van, because they are hell to insure. So now, we go to either a minibus or, easier, a campervan. Preferably a VW, Penmo found one the other night for £750, so it should be doable. Also, this guy said that it would be cheaper for Vicky and Bri-y to drive.   In other news, I am publicly apologising to Briony for saying she seek work as a dominatrix. it wasn't me, it was Ron, my alter ego, who sometimes signs my emails. (look at your keyboards, folks!)

      Well well well. Last night we went to Vicky's, whereupon we variously drank, ate, made merry and juggled fire. We also drank some unbelievable spanish liquer if thats how you spell it, which was very unbelievable, and also very nice. then we went to the field and sat around, discussing all kinds of things. Would write more, but it's just possible that my heart is fucked, so I wont. (only joking, I think its my lungs actually.) Here is a gd quote. Rob: Bring me something sweet and alcoholic.

Dave looking sultry.     Me and Colin (who taught us to juggle clubs) performing.     A duel of medieval proportion.     Colin with some fire poi.     Dave and the man Grum.     Colin juggling knives above me. (he did actually drop one, but fortunately it hit me with the flat of the blade)     A really cool bowl. There is a story behind this on... Oh wait, there isn't.     Me Dave and Penmo playing twister, which went on for an hour and a quarter(!!)     A cool windmill thing belonging to the Meon valley Rangers.   Most pics taken by me, cept for the ones that im in, obviously. I think they were taken by Andy or Dave.

      Hey everyone! We are in an internet cafe outside waterloo station in london, and we are having a great time. Variously we have canoed, swum, learned how to juggle clubs and been told off for moshing. Also, I got uberly rat arsed last night, mainly thanks to half a bottle of whiskey and a man called Grum.  No pics, alas, since im in an internet cafe, and dont have my camera or my cable. But rest asured that we will give you many when we return!  I have cut my elbow, and got some glow in the dark diabolo stuff, it's cool. Penmo has pulled, but I dont like her much because she smacked me really hard with a chopping board.  Today, we have been in london. we went on the tube, and went to Camden, which is the coolest place on earth and incidentally has hundreds of shops selling shrooms. Yay! No, we didn't buy any. But we did se some inredible boots which would really have suited Bri-y.  Penmo has fire Juggling balls. I don't know if i said that already, but they are cool, so I'll say it again.  We have a really great band here, they are amazing, as Emz and Bri-y should know if they actually heard them off my phone. They are really great. Go   urlLink here   to the campdown website which is really good, and has live broadcasts online. Look for us folks!  Anyway, Fairplay etc to you all, See you soon!  Rob  "Greetings" Now that Rob has relinquished control of the pc I can type a load of bollocks too! On-site activities are really dull so the only things we can actually do that are vaguely interesting are off-site, which take a long time to get to. However, this trip in London is certainly turning out to be "spiffing" good fun. It is very hot etc. I wish I didn't have to pay 20p every time I wanted to go to the toilet in London, though it is free on camp... Yum. Dave.

The group stared at eachother, all felt that they were happy so what could they possibly need? 'How about looking in the mirror from Harry Potter that showed your hearts desire?' suggested Vicky 'And where is this mirror?' inquired Rob 'We'd have to ask Dumbledore' 'But...' and so on and so forth Rob destroyed Vicky's logic till the Davemother who knew Vicky to be right, stopped Rob by giving him blue eyes, rosy cheeks and a cute little dog to complete the sissy look. Rob hid behind a tree. 'Now listen,' the davemother said, 'i will give you a clue for what Rob needs...or I shall just tell you cause he really needs MODESTY!' 'Do not, Im perfect!' Rob proclaimed The others looked at eachother and agreed first get the modesty before midnight (well you know that someone would kill Rob if he didnt have some by then) and then after to search for this mirror and seek what each desired. The fairy davemother was to come along to, to finally rid her/himself of this cross dressing curse bestowed by someone with a poor sense of humour. And off they went on their journey but had not gone far when...

Rob blushed and a tear fell from his eye! Then bubbles began to appear and the fairy came to tell them their quest. You guessed it was gonna be Dave right? well you were completely....

Rob looked out at the empty, birdless sky and raised an eyebrow. Meanwhile Emily woke up in the back seat and saw that as the other two were arguing they were rapidly approaching a wall. There was nothing else she could do but...

      Emily. She appeared to be dead, but upon closer inspection was in fact just resting. But Rob had other things on his mind,  mainly Bri-y's driving. She was all over the sky. Shocking. However, Rob new how to solve this.   "If you drive straight, then I'll..."

      ...Rob woke up and smelled the coffee which he promptly pushed away, (it having been there in his room for a few years). It was all a dream, he sighed. He stared out his window and looked at a blue speck approaching him. As it got closer it grew in size till it became the car out of Harry Potter. With Bri in the driving seat Rob was apprehensive, but with a final look at his mess...cough...room, he got in the flying car which flew to the clouds, and was looking out the window once more when he realised there was another in the car. It was none other than....

      Once upon a time, Rob was really damn sexy. Lots of women had commented on this. They siad to him:   "Rob, you are a sexy bitch"  "thank you" said Rob  "Thou speakest truth" Said God.  And so, sitting in his enchanted glade, Rob was quite content with life. He just been sailing with a happy goblin, who was very happy.  In the heat of the day, Rob dozed off. He awoke a few hours later to the sound of smashing. Looking into his portable welsh dresser (where he kept all of his chinaware,) he saw something smashing. It was a piece of paper that said:  "Congratulations, Rob, you have won £1,000!"  It was the first time Rob had ever heard paper speak.    Reaching behind him, he picked up his phone, and rang his bank manager to tell him the good news.  They were celebrating together when suddenly...

      ok this is the random story 2 For this you cant post anything two times in a row, you have to wait for someone else to continue. comment on how good/bad the story is, the titles are the story. ALWAYS have a cliff hanger ending! here is the first random story so you get the idea: 1.	One day in chemistry Briony was trying to correctly wire up a plug. It then fell apart for the tenth time. She gave up and was staring out the window when... 2.	suddenly, an unconscious pupil fell through the roof, who was then followed by a dwarf dressed as a nun (oh no, it was actually Mrs Goodchild) 3.	The unconscious person remained still. Briony realizing it was Emily Cried out a prolonged Noooooo!!! When Emily got up and said why are you doing that? Briony fell into a shocked Huh wad-ju-yer-du-in-mmeh and was silenced by the nun... 4.	then, Briony thought of something. She hadn't done her massive 500-page essay, so (in her physics lesson, remember) she decided to get on with it. What was the title? Oh yes, "How to say hello in 500m words" Hmmmm.....she thought. Well, hello, guten tag, bonjour, hola,......um.............hmmm......... 5.	Briony spent the rest of the lesson pondering this strange task of hers. Emily personally thought that the essay was just created by the teachers as revenge. Briony was bought back to reality by a flying blue car outside the window, which had come to save both her and Emily. 6.	who was it? she wondered? Uhhh! It was Harry Potter in his flying car (remember the chamber of secrets?)! Wow! MY hero! Sighed Emily. How I do love you so! Oh get on with it said Briony. She was missing Adam. Sigh........... 7.	Harry turned to Briony and said 'I know that Emily is drop dead gorgeous but I'm afraid I can not date her due to a curse created by Voldemort. You how ever can both come with me and I will take you to Hogwarts where Adam is a pupil. Briony looking both sceptical and worried climbed into  the car, Emily took the front passenger seat, Briony the Back. The car then took off into the skies ... 8.	All of a sudden a strange knocking was heard apparently coming from nowhere. Briony still worried turned to Harry and asked what on earth it was. Don't worry said the alien as it turned around it's just my pet human Becky! 9.	Suddenly, Harry grew two ex-TREMELY large tentacles and started to eat Briony! Luckily, Adam was around to save her, and killed Harry. Meanwhile, Emily was fast asleep and dreaming of sticking pins in Dave’s privates. She woke up to find herself with Becky, Briony and Adam, in the sky, resting on what looked like a cloud. Have I died and gone to heaven? Wondered Emily. Meanwhile (again) Briony, Adam and Becky were all wondering what to tell Emily. Could they tell her that Harry Potter, her long loved lover, had turned into an alien and they had to kill him? Worse still, there was the matter getting down from the cloud; they thought they had killed Harry, but he was well enough to drive off after leaving them on a cloud in the sky. Hmm.....this was going to be a long night.......... 10.	Adam walked around pondering what to do and then fell through the clouds in a puff of smoke with the words 'oops I hit a soft spot'. Emily caught his wand in a flash and cast the wingardium leviosa spell saving Adam. She thought to herself well that shows my brother that the Harry Potter books ARE educational. Adam stuttered thanks, Emily put up hand and cast a spell to take them all to Hogwarts- unfortunately she sneezed part way through and they actually ended up at the worst possible place. You guessed it there were at .... 11.	Voldemorts secret palace in the middle of mount Doom where he was secretly conspiring with Sauron to take over the world. Briony on seeing such evil collapsed elegantly into the arms of yes you’ve guessed it ADAM. Who on seeing her almost dying (well he thought so) declared his undying love for her, but fate was not looking fondly on the two young lovers as Sauron swooped down in a rather vampirish way to steal his love from Adams arms. With a cry of anguish Adam....... 12.	...........punched Sauron in the fangs and grabbed Briony. He pulled her (nicely) away from the evilness of Sauron and made sure everyone was alright (aww, isn't he nice!!!!) Anyway, back to the story....Adam quickly chanted a spell that took them all to a very magical romantic place. Everywhere they looked, there were very wonderful things that were so wonderful they couldn't be described. Adam decided to seize his opportunity and whisked Briony away from everyone so that they could be alone. Finally! But, just as they were about to go into the best snog ever in the world,.................................. HAVE FUN!!!

      ....Emz spotted the spooky house that they were to seek just in time to see the gorg tour guide being dragged through the door. Emz set off towards the house alone, she would save the tour guide and save Rob by finding him that modesty which he was now lacking cause by taking off that dress he only had a pair of barbie shorts on with a t-shirt saying love me on it, would she be able to find what she needed in time though? As she walked toward the castle...

Everyone was relieved that they had not been killed, but were rather worried that they should now have to navigate the island alone, with all the terrors it no doubt held. Bri suggested that they all head for the erupting volcano in the centre of the island. No one seemed to want to point out the obvious flaw in this plan, so off they set. But they had been walking only a few minutes when suddenly...

They started to fight over it as the humans ran for their lifes. It was truely a great battle til one pygmie triumphed and was blown to bits shortly after. The group looked around, Briony said 'Is everyone ok? Is everyone here?' But one was missing from their group...

'Well...you passed the test, welcome to Spooky island, im your tour guide!' the old man removed the suit and out stepped a dashingly handsome man who took Emily by the hand and motioned for the others to follow. Emily was all a-glow and walked close to the man. They had just reached a hut when out from the shadows...

"Please, don't tread on my island, for tis written, shud another's feet walk this soil, then I shall die, and my line shall be extinct." Unfortuneatly, Emz was already halfway to the ground, having ignored the warning and jumped. She was just about to hit the ground...

The others thanked the tree and informed of their quest to first get Rob some modesty or someone would kill him before midnight. The tree said he was sure that it would be a sad loss for someone if Rob was to perish but that he probably would have brought it on himself. No-one disagreed with this. Suddenly there was a bump and the tree anounced that they had arrived on Spooky Island. All looked around in amazement and were about to get off the boat when...

Well, that was the plan, but his dress got in the way, and he fell overboard. Or rather, he almost fell overboard, when suddenly strong hands grabbed him, and he was pulled back by none other than...

The others looked baffled and then returned to help Rob whose speach about tree's being used on boats had prompted the tree who was the captain of the boat to attack Rob with all his might. Bad for Rob that he had offended a whomping willow who was now trying to make Rob a wheeping willow. All seemed lost as Rob's dress was torn and his make up smudged, he had even resulted to cat fighting as the others took a break to watch and have a laugh and a coke (well it was 11.30am). Once this sacred time of coke drinking was over they considered how to stop the fight so they could get on with their mission. Suddenly the little dog that had been given to Rob....

Then Rob pointed out that tree on boats were not that uncommon, since without them there would be nothing to hold the sails up. Then, with a bowel-trembling thump, another ship fired its canon at the crew of the good ship Castlemaine. Fortuneately, everyone was in fact on the good ship Fourecks, which was some distance away, and, by incredible coincidnce, in another universe. But the faeries were worried for a moment. "Was it just coincidence? Was it planned? who knows?" And so saying,...

(wel, not big trees anyway) Evryone thought this was just a TAD weird, but no-one sed anythin cos they were all too stupid (he he)...apart from Bri-y, who spoke up. "Hmm, that captain looks like a tree. How strange." Evryone agreed, and then carried on playin pass the bomb (soooo much fun). However, little did they realise that the "plastic pretend" bomb was actually.....

      ....the really spooky house on spooky island, she muttered something bout some clutz of a dog who somehow helped to solve mysteries and a bunch of kids who were so tacky that even the 60's rejected them. Vicky realised that if she was telling them not to go, of course that meant they would go, but she probably knew that they would do the opposite of what she said cos she was evil, meaning that she did want them to go cos perhaps there was a trap there like in Hanzel and Gretal, but if they knew this then they wouldnt go, but if she knew that they thought this, perhaps she was just trying to make sure that they didnt go cos she was hiding something there that she didnt want them to see. Vicky tried to explain this to the others and then proposed that they should go to the spooky house on spooky island. The others were to bemused to argue. The evil fairy tried once more to stop them saying, 'but i told you not to go!' Vicky started her explaination again but the fairy stoped her and said 'I'm going to classes now to be good, this was my good deed for the day!' Everyone looked at Vicky who said 'well so what, you dont get to meet a mystery solving dog everyday!' The others nodded and left the fairy woth her mouth hanging open behind them as they walked towards the port that had the boat to take them to spooky island. When they got there they looked at the boat, it was empty except for the captain who was a ....
