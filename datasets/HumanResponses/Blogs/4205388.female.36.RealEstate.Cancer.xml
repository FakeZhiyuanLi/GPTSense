       Well H and the kids were away last night and I had the place to myself.  Damn! Wouldnt you know it that my mom would call, AND I would answer.... there goes my night to myself.  It's like she has freaking radar that zeroes in on me whenever I have time alone.  So not only does she pop over to "drop something off", but then she looks at the tv and never moves her ass off the couch.  If I hadn't been so obviously watching the movie I would have turned it off just to get her to leave.      Its like it has some damn hold over her.  For as long as I can remember, if she came over to our house and the tv was on, she would look at it and it was like she was physically unable to look away and then she would just melt like a lump into the nearest chair.  Her eyes kind of glaze over and actually its almost intentional - its like she fixes her gaze on the tv rather than make eye contact with us because if she looked at us it would be obvious to her that we want her to leave.      So for all my being pissed about H treating my mom like crap and making her feel unwanted, i really can't stand it when she hangs out at my house.  She always talks about other people - as if they are the only life she knows.  She talks about other peoples problems and about other peoples experiences as though they are hers.  Theeeeeeeeeeeeeeen she actually has to describe in excruciating detail everything she eats whenever she eats out or has anything good to eat in general.  Either that or she talks about cats or dogs she used to have, or about "when I was a kid".      So she hung there for two hours - effectively using up my whole night - and didn't leave until almost 10.  Even then it was hard for her to pass by the tv without beginning to gaze at it blankly and stop walking.      I even told her H and the kids were coming back hoping that would spur her to leave.  If only he would have called while she was there I could have made it sound on my end that he'd be home any minute and I'm sure she would have hightailed it outta there.      So I was just plain disappointed.  Then i couldn't sleep cuz its like when the weekend is going to end and you stay up late just trying to eek out every minute you can of the time off before going to sleep.  Because once you go to sleep its like an instant before you wake up and have to go back to work.      Then my sister calls her to cut watermelon and whines that the dogs miss her.  Here all this time I thought it was my mom who couldnt let go of my sister and had to be there all the time to avoid being at home... and so she could feel needed and useful.  The truth is that they call her over for every little thing - cut watermelon, wash the dishes, help with laundry, take care of the dogs, blah blah blah.      This is part of why i am so distant from her.  I so dont want to be as needy as sis that I went in the polar opposite direction.  I always want to be on my own.  Even when I've been in the hospital for things like.... oh i dunno childbirth... or similar - I just hate having people there with me.  The last time I was even glad to have H out of there.  If i were to get pregnant again I'd probably say just drop me off at the front door and pick me up when im ready to go lol      Oh and i went back online yesterday.  Just to peek.  It's been about a week I think.  GT caught me right away and then I got disconnected.  As soon as I got back on, JM caught me.  So I talked to both of them.  I was so surprised to find out how much GT really liked me before I decided to leave chat.  I think he was really fallin for me.  As for JM, I knew he was just going kinda gaga - and I was worried that if I stayed on he'd be too obsessed.  But it was nice to talk with them both yesterday.      Our pc at home died.  CRAP!  I meant to take some "things" off the pc before it went in for service and I just didn't have the opp.  Maybe I'll try to hook it up tonight just in case it will work.  If not, I'll just have to take my chances that things don't end up in the wrong hands.      OH MY GOD!! I have been eating like a PIG PIG PIG PIG!!!  Not sure what's causing it - and I wonder if its partly due to my switch from regular meds to generic.  No matter what people say its not all the same.  (its just a thyroid med - nothing psychotic lol)      Last night I went home and had two individual bowls of chips and salsa, a bowl of herb rice - kinda big, a bowl of chocolate ice cream, and then in the middle of the night - four waffles.  This morning I ate a fat egg salad sandwich that i picked up on the way to work.  I wasn't gonna eat ANYTHING for lunch, but I was on "that" side of town so I ended up getting a pasta dish from Noodles N Co.  DUH!   Man Im gonna get as fat as a whale if I don't cut it out.      Thankfully Im going camping this weekend so I can starve myself, drink lots of water, and walk/jog/run a lot to try to burn off all those extra calories ive been consuming.  Really I dont know whats been driving it except the need for instant gratification.  ANd the funny thing is that its not really all that gratifying - not WHILE im eating and DEFINITELY not AFTER I eat it.  I spose Im just missing a few things that would give me long term satisfaction so Im constantly looking for a quick fix.      I did just drink a liter of Evian.  Whew - thats a start.  Speaking of which - I needa pee.  Ciao.

       Well not a bad weekend.  H was quite crabby for bits and pieces of it and naturally I didn't most things right.  However there were moments of mellowness and anytime with mom-in-law was enjoyed as were times with my lil babies.  We did all take a looooooong bike ride on Sunday on an old RR bed that had been converted into a bike trail.      H started out bitching, went right into "you provoked me" and I let him have it.  Tell me, how could I be provoking him if I got up, got ready, put away laundry, did dishes, cleaned the house, and started more laundry.  Ok - fill me in - exactly when did that become grounds for being mad at your wife?      Anyway the bike ride was great and relaxing and very communal and I think it was good for all of us.      The kids were a lil weepy leavin us last night to spend their last night with Grandma before she heads back home.  That, and the fact that it was Sunday night and I had to go to work the next day, left me feeling very anxious and unsettled and I slept like crap.      Funny thing is that work always ends up ok and I know my children are in great care, so I should be able to not do that.   Well I keep working through it - trying to boost my own morale so I can get over that stuff.      Enrolled in a tech college under the major of Business Development with emphasis on supervisory management.  I'm HUGELY excited about this.  It will be so great to put some technical know how behind the on the job experience.  It will also make me much more marketable outside my own industry specific type of job.      MY horoscope says that this is the time for me to buckle down, impress new people, get all that backlog of work done, etc.  So I'm pretty psyched about my decision to stop chatting.  It's been really tough to NOT do it.  Whenever I'm in between projects or tasks I have this overwhelming urge to log on and chat about my day.  So I have logged in and watched in a room or two but thats it.  The "new people" i think the horoscope is talking about would be my new boss.  He starts next week and I haven't really had one for a looooong time, so I think this will be great.      Last week I surfed a ton of porn - how stupid!!.  I have a terrible virus on my computer too.  I think I'm going to take the pc to an independent computer contractor to get it fixed because I just can't give it to our in house tekkie for him to find all that I've done on line.  Not that I think he'd tell - but I don't really want him to know.      On the home front I've realized that I have ZERO sex drive for H.  I have a pretty great sex drive in general, but as he's become increasingly negative, arrogant, self righteous, condescending, and disrespectful towards me, I have less and less attraction to him.  How can a person feel passionate or sexy with a person who talks down to them and constantly expresses that he thinks he's better than her?      My family thinks its emotional abuse.  I think it's bordering but I wouldn't take it that far.  Of course they only hear the bad stuff, but maybe I'm just making excuses for him?   I dont know.  My sibling made a comment that our mom left our dad for OUR sake without regard for her own fears of being able to take care of us.  The difference is that my dad hit her, was an alcoholic, and couldn't hold a job, and they were living in someone's basement or something at the time.      For me, I have a nice place to live, my kids are TONS more secure and self assured at their ages than I or my sibling were at the same ages, H has been employed at the same place for 13 years and I for 11.  Yes H is crabby and is going through some really nasty phase, but we're talking about it regularly and we are both trying to make changes to help it work out.      The thing about marriage is that it's not just about love and passion.  Marriage is about commitment and love and passion are a bonus.  Thankfully the love and passion come first in most cases, but in the long run its the commitment that matters.  When you marry someone you are vowing to stand by them through thick and thin and that means, because you are two individuals coming from relatively different growth environments, that there will be differences of opinion and difficulties as you try to make the best happen.        I mean two people could committ to be there for each other just out of a need to care for someone and to be needed by someone and to be able to rely on someone.  They could do that as relative strangers, sign a contract, and in the process fall in love.  But first and foremost they are contractual partners.      If you leave in the middle, your partner has to start all over again trying to develop such a partnership and trust.  That's not an easy task and you promised you would be there in the first place.      Ideally it would be better if such contracts were the norm and if love and/or passion could be supplemented outside of the marriage.  Thats sort of what drew me to messenger - the fact that I could have passion and sort of a relationship of love or friendship/romance outside of my marriage.      Okay maybe Im rambling but those are my thoughts right now.  Peace to you all and I hope someday someone finds this and makes some comments.      Me

        Hey all, this here's my first (virgin) post on my new blog.  I just retired from messenger cuz i was so addicted to it that it was messin up my work n life.  I guess I needed some other addiction to feed so here I am.          Usually keep my journal on livejournal.com, but this seems more accessible.            The purpose, if anyone cares, is sometimes to vent, sometimes to express an opinion or to record an idea.... occasional epiphanies.  Maybe someone sometime might benefit personally from reading anything that goes on here - who knows.  I named the blog adult swim cuz i'm not a teen or gen x'r n sometimes what I write might really only apply to working, settled, and sometimes unsettled adults.          Im 36.. married with two children.  Mom-in-law just came to town for a one week visit which is cool cuz I like her (plus she doesn't stay with us).  I work in a human services kind of organization in neighborhood redevelopment and housing development in an administrative and managerial capacity.          It's nasty cold today for August - only in the upper 50's low 60's - last week was plenty hot.  My weekly beach days are over cuz I'm out of personal time - that really sucks - so I'm back to the five day work week.  No more days off until the new year.          Recently I've become kind of addicted to chat.  I've chatted for several years regularly, but had one or two close friends that I chatted with daily for the last year and a half.  That recently went south when one got busted for IM on the pc.  Then I found that I couldn't shake the habit - how weird.  I had to be talking to people all the time .... much to the detriment of my work.  No problem staying away from it at home, but my  habit of practicing avoidance of difficult tasks at work let me to really spend too much time on IM.          Today I called it quits - told everyone I wasn't coming around anymore and uninstalled it.  I'm going to figure out how I can block it from ever being installed again.  It's kind of a new start for me.  So far, it hasn't resulted in any great amount of work getting done, but I will get started today.  My goal is to revamp my work and personal life so that every step from here on is a positive one in a positive direction.          Just picked up a course catalog and app from a local college so I can get enrolled in some classes and start to better my future.  At the very least I hope to gain some skills to help me at work and to make me more broadly marketable out there in case I decide to leave here.          Been here for 11 years and worked my way up from a part time receptionist thru many other positions to where I am now, one step away from the CEO.  No, I dont mean I could be in her position next... I just mean she's who I answer to.  No, Im not at all secretarial or assistant related.  But I've gotten about as far up the ladder as I can climb without a degree.          Unfortunately Its moved my office location about 1/2 hour from home so a lot of things have changed in my interaction with my kids.  Last year my husband had to start taking them to school and my sister had to start picking them up because I was no longer close enough to do that.  This year, they'll be riding the bus.  I could no longer hang out and watch them until the morning bell rang every morning - more of a let down for my youngest because I'd been able to do it for my oldest for four years before this happened.  I couldnt visit at lunch.  I barely knew what was going on at school by the time I got home.          I'd like to gain some skills that would give me more employment options in other related industries - real estate or banking or personnel management - where I could get a job in my home town with equal or better pay.  That's sort of my goal at this point.          I'd also like to write a few books - shakespeare for children has always been my dream.  So maybe I'll be able to monitor a few shakespeare classes to get a better grasp of it from the real plays on out.  When I was a kid my fave book was a collection of simplified - tho not TOO simplified - tales from shakespeare that had been published probably before my mom was born.          Ok so thats enough for me... I'm gonna see what else I can do with this and move on to my work.  I promise all future blog posts will be much shorter.          Peace
