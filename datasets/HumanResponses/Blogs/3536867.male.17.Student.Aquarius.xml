      This comic was drawn up during a math class one day because some chick a) actaully said what's typed out in the first frame and b) actually left class to book beauty salon appointments when they heard we had a half day one day.   Other Thoughts  Now that exams are over, I'm going to try and get my shit together, slowly yet surely and get one comic a week.  Than two.  Hopefully I'll have 3-5 comics a week if I can get things working out well.  We've not even had 5 comics out already and I've heard bitching about my comic.  I'm holding back here, but to those people,  nuts to you and don't read my comic .  Next comic soon.

      Yah, I decided it would be best to avoid guest comics for a while. Well since the site just got up and working and there are only a few comics, we decided that it doesn't really make sense to post guest comics so early.  So ya, things are starting slow, but that's okay! So long as the "no updates" habit doesn't stick, it'll be alright!

       OK!   Here's the skinny.  Despite the archiving here, both Part 1 and Part 2 of "Bicentennial Violence" are one comic.  Sorry about that.  Also, I've not had time to get this week's comic done between work and friends but it will be up soon.   Also , exams are coming up for the staff members here, so thinhs might get a little hectic.  So if we get quiet, we'll be back soon, don't worry.

      A lot of the features won't go up until I'm finished writing them, and there hasn't been much time to do that recently. I have a lot of drama doing on right now, but hopefully it'll boil down soon. That, and summer's almost upon us, where we will all have untold hours of boredom to make Oddville even better. Look forward to it.  FillerKori out...

      This comic was inspired by my goofy mind, my love for senseless violence and the movie "Bicentennial Man."  We were doing a science fiction section in english and we had to write a comparison essay between the moves "Bicentennial Man" and "A.I.".  Oh yeah, I got 82% or something on that essay, in case you're wondering. 	Sorry about the quality of this first drawing, I'm having a bit of a time making the swtich from lined paper to frames.

      Alright, the site is complete in terms of the design and all the active sites. Glad that's over with...  Now all that's left to do is to complete the incomplete, underconstruction parts of the sites, primarely the Cast section. As that happens, we'll slowly add articles and such to ther "other" section.  Whee, fun fun fun.  -Takkun

      While BlackMage is busy with what he's doing, I'm writing more features for the site. Look for a "links" page soon, and be on the lookout for the History of Oddville and Cast features.   The site will grow, and eventually we'll have more than one comic up XD.  FillerKori out...

      Hello.  Ii'd figured I'd test this bleeding thing for myself and let you know what  I'm  up to comic wise.   Comic Editing  Takkun (the web ninja!) has sent me a template that I  think  I can work with and so we're looking into mass producing the templates and I'll start re-drawing the comics.   New comics  Coming slowly but surely.  I think I might all out stop making new ones at some point in time because a) I run out of ideas quickly and b) editing is going to be a bitch.   The History of Project: Oddville  In the works.  It won't be huge, but it'll explain a few things.   Cast feature  Takkun has asked me to draw up the cast pictures and those will be done soon.   Other notes  I'm starting to work now (real life sucks) and so does Takkun.  So if things seem slow around here, we're doing our best.  Mad props to Takkun and FillerKori.

      Oddville on the internet at last! I've been bugging BlackMage/Paul to put Oddville on the internet ever since I saw the first couple comics. Almost a year later, here we are. There's no comics up, there's a ton of broken links, but we're here. BlackMage is the creator, as he said. Takkun is our resident webmaster, so where do I come in? When BM is busy drawing comics and Takkun is busy making the site nice and pretty, I'm the one keeping you in the loop about the going ons of Oddville, as well as updating site features and handling the PR stuff. You got a question, it comes to me. Have a comment for BM or Takkun? I'll give it a quick run over and forward it to whomever. Spammers and flamers bewear, you gotta get by me first. I shall nobely sarifice my inbox to deal with you people, the Internet.  There's more to come!  FillerKori out...

      Well, ladies and gentlemen....1...1...2...3...hello? Excellent! We are now going LIVE! My name is Takkun, and I'm the web designer, editor and graphics designer of Project Oddville. This site is still under construction, but will still be posting comics...hopefully regularly. In other words, we are active, and taking off! Slowly, but it's happening! Wish us luck, everyone!  - Takkun

      I wrote this comic instead of cleaning my room one day.&nbsp; It seemed like it was more fun anyway.   New comic should be up by end of the week.&nbsp; I'm going fishing tomorrow which means I have to be up early.&nbsp; Good night all.

      Corrections made on practically all (not garunteeing anything...I'm horrible at proof reading things I wrote out...) of the comics done up untill now. The next comic will be posted around 7, or something this morning, so enjoy. It's a short one, but that's okay. All of the early comics vary in length greatly. Once all of the first year's comics have cycled, we'll probably set a standard length.    Eventually I'll be adding a drop-down listing all available comics. Normally I wouldn't add this (cause I'm lazy), but the archive works in strange ways and doesn't list all the comics on any previous comic or, whatever...I'm not sure if you understand, but if you don't, too bad. It's not like it's gunna effect you or anything.    Anyway, good night...err, morning.    - Takkun

      OK...I drew this one a long time ago at about 3:30 in the morning one day after watching the movie "The Cell" with Jennifer Lopez.  Yeah, I was bored.  I also redrew this comic early in the morning one day, so there's a few continuity errors, but you may not even notice them.  If you do, I'm really sorry and I won't screw up next time.  As for lack of updates, I'm working on it.  I'll have to start on the cast pretty soon and I'll talk to the other staffers about features and what not.  As for the next comic, expect it soon.
