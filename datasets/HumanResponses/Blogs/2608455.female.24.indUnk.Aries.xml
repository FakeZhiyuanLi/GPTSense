      MOK still hasnt come home.i think some stupid people kidnapped him coz the other nite i heard kucing gaduh then it sounded soooo like him then out of nowhere i saw jack running away(like he always do when miamor ran after him) but this time no ones after him.ok so my theory is MOK is being locked in a cage or something hence he couldnt fight with jack.make sense? i think so. so thats my blog for today,a lil longer than usual.well couldnt help it,not having MOK around making it lesser thing for me to do around here.laters

       Slip away.....   Kenapa bila kita nak sangat sesuatu tu biasanya takkan dapat? But will always end up with something that we don't need. Something that we don't even think of. Tapi biler dah dapat benda yang dikejar-kejar tu ada pulak orang yang stupid enough to let it slip away. Stupid?  Yups..i'm one of the stupid dumb ass people who let it slip away right in front of my eyes.  UWWaaa... i can't believe i said NO to that. A big fat no! This is like the biggest regret in my life...ever! No wait... second kot..second biggest regret. I feel like nak hantuk je kepala kat dinding..tapi sakit.. isk! isk! isk! PENYESALAN!!!!!! That was like the only chance i have to prove myself tapi skarang ?uhuk uhuk.. ;( akulah orang paling buduhhhhssss buat masa ni kat planet  ni!  note to self ... do not make any decision/dealing right after waking up early in the morning !  natural born loser?

      PARANOIA (sp?)  anyway all these losing weight thing is getting me a bit paranoid.i was so upset yesterday (the day i found out i was losing weight), so i thought i'd went shopping to cheer my self up. it works(as always) but the paranoia crept in, ie before this i have no prob buying stuffs in small sizes.heck i always buy stuffs(shirts/t shirts) in small size but now i kept wondering- if i buy small clothes again,wouldnt that make the ever so thin me(heh) more obvious? but then if i buy bigger size clothes nampak mcm baju pinjam lak. hmmmm so i dont know :(((

      Will update my blog on weekly basis from now on since i hardly have time to log on the internet. Let's see what i did last week. Went bowling at Warta (not bad since there was not so many peeps but the balls are in pretty bad state. But next time i want to play in the new lane.) Manage to embarassed myself by having the ball to roll over just when i'm about to throw it -throw?( ehmmm... )&nbsp;and i got cheers for that haha...&nbsp;next time when somebody mentioning to anyone about a girl who rolls her ball off (haha!) it could be me !!!!! and i better not laugh at that! i guess since i'm in a&nbsp;good mood that day,the game was pretty beautiful (eheh) only to get beaten up by nudd and mimi. but considering i haven't been playing for a long, long time, i guess all was forgiven.  the rest of the week is spent on projects and assignment..*sigh*  &nbsp;

      After years of expensive education A car full of books and anticipation I’m an expert on Shakespeare and that’s a hell of a lot But the world don’t need scholars as much as I thought Maybe I’ll go travelling for a year Finding myself, or start a career Could work the poor, though I’m hungry for fame We all seem so different but we’re just the same Maybe I’ll go to the gym, so I don’t get fat Aren’t things more easy, with a tight six pack Who knows the answers, who do you trust I can’t even seperate love from lust Maybe I’ll move back home and pay off my loans Working nine to five, answering phones But don’t make me live for Friday nights Drinking eight pints and getting in fights Maybe I’ll just fall in love That could solve it all Philosophers say that that’s enough There surely must be more Love ain’t the answer, nor is work The truth elludes me so much it hurts But I’m still having fun and I guess that’s the key I’m a twentysomething and I’ll keep being me    urlLink jamiecullum.com  ---->my fav.site at the mo' !

      I'm in dilemma...i need a new machine desperately but the thing is i dunno which one to splurge my money on (eheheh duit loan!!!) there's the conventional computer, the eyecandy barebone and the tempting laptop ... aiyooo which one??? fenin la fenin ...  since my fac. skang dah ader this wi-fi connection (11mb!)so kalau ader laptop, i don't have to berebut using pc in the lab, bley duduk-duduk surfing while having my coffee -cheh konon!...plus senang nak bawak balik umah during the holidays..praktikal rite? i love those laptop from the fujistu series ... slimmy + slivery. i have to rule out the barebone though ...eventhough comel, lawa, kiut ...tapi cam tak leh nak angkat gua nyer power jer ... susah nak overclocking n upgrade...so tinggal pc ngan laptop..huhu..which ONE??? ArgHHHH!!! and i need one pronto...  on the lighter side .. i met someone who look like a carbon copy of ashraf sinclair...or is it really him? ntahla ..but thing is aku nampak dier kat pusanika while i'm having my lunch..so it can't be him can he?  oHH..looks like this weekend gonna be hell again....i spend my last weekend all alone..talking and cursing to myself and only god knows what i'm gonna to do this weekend.. seems that everybody evaporate last weekend.. tetiba hilang ..and i'm left alone counting the cracks on the wall.(first count 43, second count 49-maybe i bang the door too hard..)   i know ..i'm pathetic...my life is a truckload of rubbish...

      it's saturday & yes, i'm working(sucks big time!). juz feeling blue today. something happen last nite & i juz feel so sad rite now. more sad than ever.. i dunno whether i can take this anymore. it's juz too depressing everytime it happen. feel like crying rite now, but "wake up gal!u're in ur office!". wat will happen if i just let everything go? can i cope with it. shall i try? urgh..too many question but not even a single answer. s**t! why is is always HAVE to happen eventho i'd promised tat it wont happen again?why? i guess MY promise alone wont work rite? i'll just wait for what will happen next. THEN only i'll cosider the next step. hope it's the rite one:( in case u're wondering wat the f**k am i talking about, just let it be a secret for me(n just me) to keep..

      'Malam Bintang Luxor'? It is an annual event where all(atleast almost all) the members of Luxor Network 'kumpul sesame' in hall(stadium etc)n watch as the management ppl give away award(trophy and such) to the top achievers.There also will be performances etc. Last year it was CT Nurhaliza(Adriya's favourite;p) and this year was Misha, Ning Baizura, Rem etc. That's about it...

      zzzZZZZzzzzZZZZ...why am i so sleepy today? Hmm..it would be nice to snug in under my comforter rite now..umm..Heaven. Got meeting just now with my GM and few colleagues. fortunately my GM in good mood pulak. Not like when i came in my office this mornin, he was so moody and i think i heard him kick his desk..scary man:p I went to 'Malam Bintang Luxor' last saturday(CONGRATS MAK&ABAH!). it was ok, but the best part was when misha sang her 'lagu berhantu' PULANGKAN. she made me addicted to her voice..really! I miss my niece, Aliyah and my baby nephew, Adli. I was not at home when they went back to Klang last nite coz I was out with my honey until around 11p.m. We went to the movie and watched 'The Punisher'. It was quite nice tho i'm a bit dissapointed with the ending:P We(me & ma honey) planned to watch SHREK 2, but tix weren't available. All tix sold out,n that leaves us with 'The Punisher'. When can i get to see SHREK 2???? I've already missed my chance to watch Van Helsing.Damn!

      oh tidak! cemane leh terjebak dlm kancah blog nih? i'm not the kind of person tat like to write my tots or events in my life to any kind of media(let say diary etc.), but since nowadays ppl i know are infected by this blog-thingy, i say why dont just give it a shot kan? wat i've got to lose pon kan? thinkin back, i think it would be nice to remember sumthin-sumthin in my life that i'll tend to forget later since my brain space is gettin smaller (mcm nk kene tambah memory je eh?hehe).. hmm..think tats about it for now..u'll be seein me more after tis(or is it i'll be seein me more after tis;))..live life to the fullest!
