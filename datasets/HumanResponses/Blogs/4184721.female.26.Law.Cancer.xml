      My friend Neil is in NYC on his honeymoon with his new wife, Sherisa.  Today they said they would come to Bronx Family Court and watch one of my trials.  That has to be one of the most depressing activities that any newlywed couple can participate in.  This place forces me to be here and on most days I want my eardrums to burst, just so I will be free of listening to one societal failing after another.  I don't know who to blame for the stories that I hear anymore.  It only seems like they are all the product of apathy of some party or another.  Some days I want to blame a child's parents, the next day I feel ready to pounce on every yuppie in Manhattan who only comes to the Bronx to catch an ocassional Yankee game from their corporate box seats.  Now that I think about it again - maybe every newlywed couple should be forced to come to the Bronx Family Court.  I doubt people like Neil and Sherisa will ever need court involvement to settle anything amuck in their family.  I spent my entire childhood and never once had to see the inside of a courtroom - except when I participated in the Mock Trial competition in high school.  But even for families who do not run the risk of Family Court involvement, maybe they should be required to see the inside of the Family Court so that they can be grateful for what they have, and learn that they should care about others who don't have their same resources.

        So as much as I have tried to avoid the empty nationalistic pride that comes with it, I have caught Olympic fever.  Having spent a large portion of my childhood and adolesence as a spectator at swim meets, I find myself still obssessed with worldwide swimming rivalries. Perhaps now my knowledge of world record holders and times has faded, but I still have certain allegiances that transplant me back to when swimming seemed to matter.  Watching Gary Hall, Jr. takes me back to that summer after graduation, dancing in front of the TV with my little sister and cheering for him.  It is really an ironic attachment - that cocksure attitude he possesses is the same attitude that revolts me in the day to day interaction I have with many males.  And yet for Gary Hall, I excuse it as charisma and charm.  Maybe it is because of the gold medals. I am a loyal fan.  Don't get me wrong, I think Michael Phelps is a great swimmer - incredibly talented and well rounded, but part of my felt the sting of Gary Hall not being chosen for the 400 meter relay instead of him.  So then part of me felt vindicated when the US only won the bronze in that event (although Michael Phelps time was not the slowest).   See, that it the attitude that comes over me when I watch the Olympics that troubles me.  I hate those stupid rivalries and that competitive feeling.  I sat around the pool for too many days quite sure my heart would stop if Sarah didn't get a particular time or beat a certain girl.  I don't know why I live out these competitive notions I have through the performance of other people.  Perhaps it could be because I suck in all sports.

      I am disgusted with Dick Cheney. He has been critical of Kerry all week because Kerry said that he would fight a "more sensitive" war on terror. So basically, Dick Cheney, in political terms, has called Kerry a pansy, stating that the US has never won anything by waging a more sensitive war. Of course warmongers everywhere agree with Cheney's point - it's Sherman's march to the sea out there - "War is Hell" so it is better to rape and pillage because those are the only tactics that work. I liked Kerry's point - we have to be more sensitive to the world before taking military action. We have to be aware that, for example, in military conflict in our age, the victims of bombing and bloodshed are for more likely to be civilian non-combatants than the supposed terrorist fiends against whom we are fighting. We have to be aware of the limitations of military conflict - that bombs don't change people's minds, it only makes them more resolved to beat us to the punch. Our tactics in the world so far have not worked, being less sensitive has only caused us to lose respect, even from our allies, and to allign terrorists against us. Being more sensitive in the war on terrorism enables us to see that there are more layers and more nuances to our enemies and their grievances against us. I am at work. We just had several complaining witnesses in our office. They were all about 18, and they bothered me alot - because they made some of the most absurdly homophobic statements I have heard in a long time. These are not Bible-thumping conservatives either. They are kids in the Bronx who have had alot more action than I have ever known or will ever know. I am greatly disturbed by this, because kids in the inner-city are some of the most homophobic people on the planet. I have seen too many assaults targeted at other children because of their sexual orientation. And my officemate almost made it worse by offerring to read a list of Governor McGreevy jokes that was just sent around our office email. Luckily I stopped him. The last thing we need is to give kids in the Bronx more homophobic ammunition. Of course, these are also kids who haven't learned about respecting women yet either - they had naked pictures of women saved on their cell phones. Tonight I am going to eat dinner at Mesa Grill, which should be good and relaxing. Bobby Flay will keep me from more opinionated outbursts.

           So I realize I have yet to post anything about Zanzibar, which makes it kind of odd that my blog would be titled I wish I was in Zanzibar because...  I haven't seen Zanzibar since the summer of 1998, where I danced on the white sanded shores of Matamwe Beach and spoke Swahili to the villagers in Kizimkazi Dimbani, or haggled for bargains in the markets of Stonetown.  When I was there last, being an American didn't matter all that much, except for the fact that sometimes people looked to me for a little extra cash.  I was there when the embassy in Dar es Salaam was bombed, a short 60 mile distance from Zanzibar, and never once did I feel threatened or uncomfortable in 99% Islamic Zanzibar.  Of course my experience was before America decided that we needed to kick the world's ass.  U.S. foreign policy in 1998 was not ideal, we harbored our imperialistic tendencies, and Clinton's Africa policy left something to be desired (Rwanda! Rwanda! Rwanda!), but we weren't in this blatant state of us against the world that we are in now.  I wonder if things would be different in Zanzibar now, or if it would still be the idyllic paradise that I still envision in my mind.       Mostly I wish I was in Zanzibar because days in the family court leave me feeling so pasty and blah, and when I was in Zanzibar my skin had a healthy glow and I felt very youthful and a part of the world.  It is strange that a city like New York can leave me feeling isolated while a small island left me feeling so a part of some larger community.  It was easy to be affected by people there.       Tropical Storm Bonnie is spanking the Florida panhandle today as a punishment for their warm reception for President Bush earlier in the week.  I don't think that Mom or Melissa even got the day off from teaching school today, though.

      So I just want to state...I am bored in New York.  Does that make me the lamest person alive because I am bored in the world's most exciting city?   In better news - my boredom has made me addicted to the new album by Rogue Wave.  The first song, Every Moment, I am obsessed with.  It is rare when a line about Mormons makes it into Indie Rock.  I have to decipher that line!! Why can't I find the lyrics online?

           So two hurricanes are about to hit Florida.  This weekend, when the rain from the remnants of the two hurricanes has made their way up the East Coast, then I have decided to go see Garden State again.  Hearing the song "New Slang" in that context again, is worth a hundred rainy days.      I am outraged! A judge at the family court today kicked a boy out of the courtroom because he was wearing an earring and the judge said, "boys don't wear earrings."  I don't know who died and made her fashion police.        This week is going by so slowly, it is killing me.

        I am troubled today about a couple of things.  Today I read in the New York Times about the protests that firefighters and police officers are staging around town against the mayor.  These protests center around the fact that the mayor's new budget proposal only includes 5% pay raises for them, spread over three years.  This is the exact same raise negotiated for other city employees, but for police officers and firefighters, they think that it isn't fair that the raise is the same as for other city employees.  Rather, they assume, that because their jobs are dangerous and high profile, they should get higher raises than other city employees.  Lucky for them, since September 11, everyone loves New York City firefighters and police officers.  They have the high profile visibility to make a scene.  The thing is, I support labor unions.  I think they should have the right to protest for better wages and benefits.  What I don't support is greed.  What I don't support is people assuming their city service is more superior than the next person.  The truth is, police officers and firefighters already get paid for their overtime quite generously.  I, as a so called "city manager" do not.  I get no overtime no matter how late I stay, no matter how early I come in.  I do not have a union to speak for me, I just have to accept whatever raises the city is going to offer me.  In contrast, what the police officers and firefighers have doesn't seem so bad.  They come into court on their Regular Days Off, getting overtime, and sitting around for six hours for their cases to be called.  I wish my Family Court experience was so relaxing.  I do think that police officers and firefighters offer a unique public good.  However, so do city sanitation workers, so do teachers, so do city attorneys even.       Here is my second troubling issue for the day - the social experiment called Reality TV.  I probably shouldn't admit this, but I watched the FOX series, "Trading Spouses" last night.  I know that was a considerable waste of time, and I am sure that I could have found something more productive to do, but I just got home from the gym, collapsed on my couch, and wanted not to think for awhile (because I thought that I would just miss talking to David if I thought about anything too much).  On the show, a well-off, blonde, California mother of two spoiled children switched places with a working class, overweight, Massachussetts mother.  I wanted to hate Mrs. California, see her as a characteristic example of the Orange County, California Consumer class.  Certainly she was materialistic.  Certainly she was superficial.  Yet the Massachussetts family loved her.  They loved her "positive" attitude.  They loved her diatribes on not eating sugar cereal.  Meanwhile, the Massachussetts mother in California received a less heralded welcome. The California friends and family hated her.  Certainly she was sarcastic.  Certainly she was bossy.  But the explanation I offer has less to do with personality and more to do with appearance.  Perhaps the overweight mother was less well received because she was overweight.  Perhaps her appearance alone made her self-conscious enough affect her bossiness in trying to fit in with an obviously sleeker (and I have to say tackier) Orange County.  And when you are an overweight kid in Massachussetts, of course you are going to love having a skinnier, prettier mommy.  It is a humiliating commentary on our civilization - because appearance is still all that matters.

      So I need to correct myself in regards to my post yesterday - Mark Hacking actually shot his wife in the head while she slept (according to prosecutors that is).  He didn't slit her throat.  What a relief.

      Yesterday, when I was walking home from work I was asked to be interviewed for a PBS documentary about voter attitudes towards Bush. For so long, I have thought of so many insightful comments concerning the Bush administration, and when my time for the spotlight comes, I just look like a big dope. I hate how it is always possible to sound articulate until someone else is listening. Now I am just going to look like a flaky, ill-informed liberal. Mom told me that when Sarah is coming to New York for Labor Day, she is staying at a hotel instead of with me. I guess practically my apartment is rather small, but I can't help but think that there are other reasons she doesn't want to stay with me. Bill Clinton was on the Daily Show last night. I am still mad at him because of Rwanda, but why does he always have to be so articulate? I am jealous of him that he comes across as a friend to the little guy when his economic policies were mostly taken from a conservative Republican playbook. He is so lucky to be so charming.

        Socialist - You believe the free market can be beneficial, but that a large and powerful state is necessary to redistribute the wealth of the top classes to those of the bottom. You also think that basic utilities and trasportation should be publicly owned. Your historical role model is Eugene Debs.    urlLink  Which political sterotype are you?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Of course I am a socialist.  Would anyone ever think differently?   P.S. - I have to find something more productive to do when the Bronx Family Court is slow than to take internet quizes that give me answers I already know.

      I approve of and even endorse this quiz because it gave me these results:         You're Washington!    Though you were named after some ancient and revered relative, you've taken off on your own course and are making a new name for yourself. Water dominates your life, surrounding you on many sides and usually from above. Though you say you love rain, it's really that you've forgotten that there are other types of weather to hold an opinion on. You have an amazingly eclectic interest in walls, spokes, yaks, seats, and even the Olympics. It'll all come out in the wash.      Take the  urlLink State Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      My first blog. I abandoned Live Journal because the quality of my postings left something to be desired. Too much information - not a good thing.  Leave things in generalities - that is what I have learned.  It is silly to miss someone when they are generally absent from your day to day life. But Alaska is even more absent. It is one time zone further away than Seattle.  I have a disturbing obsession with the Mark Hacking case. Maybe because I fear being in love with someone and going to sleep one night and then not waking up again because that person that you love cuts your throat. It is perhaps a little far-fetched, but who can you trust?  I have to start regularly attending the New York Sports Club, even though it is a distressing place full of young stockbrokers and executive assistants who have to make themselves look acceptable for martini hour.  Is it more or less distressing than Coney Island, where I spent Saturday night? The Bumper Cars at AstroLand are set up against an airbrushed backdrop of the Statue of Liberty, a NASCAR, a football player, Captain America, and scantily clad busty women. Aahh America (It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw).
