      Those of you who have never listened to any of the Silly Songs with Larry are definately missing out. Below are the lyrics to this very silly song... teehee. Enjoy.



Narrator: "Joining Larry are Pa Grape and Mr. Lunt, who together make up
the infamous gang of scalliwags, the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything!"  Larry, Pa, Mr. Lunt: "We are the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything! We just
stay home and lie around. And if you ask us to do anything, we'll just
tell you ..."  
Larry: "We don't do anything!"
 Pa: "Well, I've never been Greenland and I've never been to Denver, and
I've never buried treasure in St. Louis or St. Paul, and I've never been
to Moscow and I've never been to Tampa, and I've never been to Boston in
the fall."
 All: "'Cuz we're the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything! We just stay home
and lie around. And if you ask us to do anything, we'll just tell you
.."  
Mr. Lunt: "We don't do anything. And I never hoist the mainstay and I
never swab the poop deck, and I never veer to starboard 'cuz I never
sail at all, and I've never walked the gang plank and I've never owned a
parrot, and I've never been to Boston in the fall."
 All: "'Cuz we're the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything! We just stay at home
and lie around. And if you ask us to do anything, we'll just tell you
.. We don't do anything!"
 Larry: "Well, I've never plucked a rooster and I'm not too good at
ping-pong, and I've never thrown my mashed potatoes up against the wall,
and I've never kissed a chipmunk and I've never gotten head lice, and
I've never been to Boston in the fall!"
 Pa: "Huh? What are you talking about? What's a rooster and mashed
potatoes have to do with being a pirate??"
 Mr. Lunt: "Hey, that's right! We're supposed to sing about pirate-y
things!" 
Larry: "Oh ..." 
Pa: "And who ever kissed a chipmunk? That's just nonsense! Why even
bring it up? Am I right? What do you think?"  
Mr. Lunt: "I think you look like Cap'n Crunch!"  
Pa: "Huh? No I don't!"  
Mr. Lunt: "Do too."  
Pa: "Do not!"  
Mr. Lunt: "You're making me hungry."  
Pa: "That's it, you're walkin' the plank!"  
Mr. Lunt: "Says who?"  
Pa: "Says the captain, that's who!" 
Mr. Lunt: "Oh, yeah? Aye aye, Cap'n Crunch!"  
Pa: "Aargh!"  Mr. Lunt: "Yikes!"
Larry: "And I've never licked a spark plug and I've never sniffed a
stink bug, and I've never painted daisies on a big red rubber ball, and
I've never bathed in yogurt and I don't look good in leggings ..."  Pa: "You just don't get it!"  
All: "And we've never been to Boston in the fall!"  
Pa: "Pass the chips! Who's got the remote?"
  


This is only one of several very funny songs I have recently downloaded on a bored impulse. Others include "Oh where is my hairbrush" and "Barbara Manatee" both performed by the wonderful Larry the cucumber, who is not to be confused with a pickle. *dances off singing The Pirates Who Don't Do ANYTHING*

      I am continually finding out how fortunate I am to have the parents I've got. Sure, they are strict about many things, but they are very reasonable. One thing that I am very glad to have in my parents are people who understand that sometimes the roughest looking people have the very softest hearts. Example? My sister was married a year ago in my backyard. Her husband is a former tank-operator for the army. He has tattoos all the way up his arms, and he used to smoke. Not exactly a parent's dream for a daughter. However, my family welcomed him with open arms, and we all love him.  However, he is not really the best example. He worked in a tattoo shop until shortly before he and my sister got married, so all of his friends are very interesting looking creatures. On the night of the wedding, my parents, one an accountant for banks and the other a teacher, took some Jack Daniels and some of my father's good bourbon and went out to where the new couple's friends were camping. They all took shots and had a fantastic time. That is the kind of thing that my parents do... they try their hardest not to judge by appearances and first impressions. Whenever either I or one of my sisters brings home someone, they open their arms and hearts to all. I am definately blessed in that. All of you who have been reading this blog will remember my long description of Dustin, my boyfriend. For some odd reason, his mother rarely lets him come and see me. If we have planned in advance to go out, something almost always comes up. I do my best not to judge, as I don't really know that much about his family, but it seems that once again, I have gotten lucky in my parents. Despite some bad decisions on my part in my last relationship, they trust me and want me to be happy above all else. The last time Dustin came to see me, we changed plans on my parents. We had intended to go to a movie, but decided to save money and went home to play cards with my family instead. To make a long story short? My parents are usually successful when they try to make people feel comfortable. It was Dustin's idea to go back to my house. again, something to think about. Comment as you please.

      I mentioned that School House Rock Live Jr. opened on Thursday, and that Dawney and another friend were with me on back stage crew, right?  Well, now Dawney's parents have decided that because she is grounded, she cannot go ANYWHERE, including the theatre. Never mind that about 50 people are counting on her help... (not to mention the audience) no, they have to have absolute control over her. Whereas my parents won't let me quit anything I've commited to, no matter whether I want to or not. I also got myself grounded during a show weekend once... and my parents VERY reasonably started my grounding after the show ended, because they simply aren't evil enough to punish the whole cast, crew, and audience of a play for something I did. Just something to think about.

      Actually, nothing very bad/dramatic has happened over my first day of school... except that School House Rock Live Jr. (Whew! That's a mouthful!) opened last night, which just means that I'm never home, since I work backstage. Dawney, another friend and I have a blast  modifying  the dances backstage where no one can see us... *wicked grin*I haven't been able to talk to many of my friends at all that I didn't see in person yesterday, so this is a "HEY! I miss you! Call/write me!" for all of you who know you haven't gotten your Cat fix lately. I must depart... school, you know.

      I think I got about 5 hours of sleep... You'd think that I woul have gone to bed early, knowing I would be getting up early. Oh, no. Not me. Procrastination at it's best.... last night I did my summer reading. You doubt? It was only one book.... as a senior, my English teacher felt we needed to spend more time checking out colleges than reading books. She gave us the choice of six books.... of which we need only read one. I chose Dorian Gray out of a curiousity I have had since watching the League of Extrodinary Gentlemen.Turns out the book is only 165 questions long... and I only had to do 65 questions on the whole book. Naturally, I began during actual summer vacation, and got about a quarter of the way in around June, but last night I re-read and answered all the questions for the entire book. Whether you are awestricken or horrified, I completed my entire summer project around 1:00 am last... er, this morning. Now I'm up and around, trying to get ready for my first day of school. As a female, it becomes quite an ordeal, this getting ready. We have to look amazing for our first impressions, you know. More later, if I can manage it. Wish me luck!

      Forgive my lack of writing today... I haven't had much time. Even this must be shorter than I intended to write, for I am freezing and exhausted. I would simply like to offer a hello to all the friends I was unable to speak to today, my traveller in particular. I hope your first day of school goes well, my friend... and I hope my last day of summer is one I may enjoy. With that, goodnight. Forgive my early retirement to bed, but I simply have no more energy.

      *rubs the bruise from running into the keyboard, glaring reproachfully* Mum got me up at 7:00 this morning... I think I went to bed at a quarter 'till two. *wistfully eyes her bed* I've been slamming into things left and right because I can't get my eyes to stay open. But I have to stay awake... chore time! Whoo! Only not.   
I didn't get to talk to Dustin at all last night.... our phones aren't working, so I couldn't call and he didn't get online. :o( *sniffs sadly* Hopefully I'll get to talk to or see him today... unfortunately, it doesn't seem likely that I'll see him until school starts... For some reason his mother doesn't want him spending time with me. *sobs* Ah, well. I'd better beat it before I get scolded for actually sitting down for a few minutes... I'll try to post more later.

      You may find yourself hanging out here, waiting to see what else I come up with. Yes, I am pathetic. I cannot stand to be bored. I do enjoy writing and describing, so you guys are either in or out of luck, however you want to look at it. Feel free to skip this particular message if you have ever met my boyfriend. It's describing time. *wicked laughter* I'm sorry, love... but I can't help myself. I promise I shall keep a few secrets.... 
  
Let's see. I am a very short (5'2) person... one of those details I had to take out of my 'about me' description... *growls at BlogSpot and their lies* I have never met a person my age or older who is shorter than me, except my Aunt Jerry, who is about 4 ft. even. *sigh* So you will understand my utter fascination with tall, dark, and handsome men. (For those who have not met me, I shall reveal another fact... my favorite colors are red and green. This is because people keep telling me black is not a color, it is a shade. Basically? Dark=purr. :oP) Dustin most definately fits the generic. He's around 6 feet tall... (He thinks 5'11, I think like 6'2, lol) He's got these great, dreamy eyes that shift from brown to green and back again... with long, thick, black lashes. *purrs softly to self* He's got curly black hair that he despises and I love, so we've got kind of a compromise on length. In short, he looks like a pirate. Except without the long hair. *sigh* Which I'm working on. *eyes twinkle* He's lean with being tall, but very solid... you'd think being held by a rock would be uncomfortable, well, it isn't. It's lovely. *sigh* He has a low, warm voice that I've discovered I can't sleep without hearing before I go to bed... We have a system of communicating while my parents are asleep and are not monitoring my phone curfew. *chuckle* He also introduced me to a fantastic game online... Yes, I am a freak, just in case any of you were thinking that but didn't want to offend me. I love role-playing... my favorite part of the game is *gasp* describing a new character. So I now have, erm... six I think. I'm often online late into the night talking to Dustin and kicking butt with either my ranger, rogue, or monk... yes, the monk is scary-cool. Don't ask unless you want to know. *broad grin* I am also a very music-oriented person. This is likely why I love his voice so much... just speaking it sounds incredible. While all I can do with music is sing it or play it on the piano, he plays 9 instruments... among them the trombone and baritone. He told me not to list the others, and that those are his main two. Do we begin to see my attraction? Tall, dark, handsome... music playing... as much of a late-night person as I am (that's hard to do... another thing that makes people think I'm a vampire... hell, he sometimes wonders if he isn't a vampire himself. *shrug* That would take a while to explain, so I'll spare you.)
  
I imagine you are all tired of reading. I did warn you that I am overly-descriptive, among other oddities. Ahh well. If you dislike it, don't read it. It makes no difference to me. I promised I would not brag on Dustin, so I shall stop where I am with his description. In parting? He looks a bit like Orlando Bloom... only fairer and short-haired. *purr* That just came to me. (And he hates having his picture taken... he's not in our yearbook except on the band page...)

      *growls fiercely at BlogSpot* It said that when I was writing my 'about me' section of my profile, I could write as little or as much as I wanted to. The bloody thing has a 1,200 character limit. *grumble* I had to take things out of my description! That's not ruddy fair! *wails* It SAID I could write AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO!  They LIED TO ME! *composes self* The disadvantage to being a writer by hobby is that once you get your mind flowing, it becomes difficult to stop writing. Once I finally decided what to say... *sigh* But I couldn't write it. This is stupid. *grumble* Ah, well. I suppose I'll get used to the idea.... *walks away from the computer, grumbling*

      You really should be scared. At least I'm warning you. I'm not precisely sane, you see.... I believe eccentric is the word. Yes, that's it all right. *beam* I love it when I get the word right the first time... *shakes head* Oh yeah, I was introducing myself. I really don't have much to say... erm... Ah, yes. Perhaps you know Dawney? A very good friend of mine. I got to talk to her Josh the other day... I think I may have frightened him. *mild concern* Ahh, well. It's a good thing he's in love with her, not me, 'cause I think he'd be afraid for his sanity within a few days. *saucy grin* As will those of you who feel the need to read my blog... I suppose I may be asking for trouble, writing out what I think, and what has happened to me... especially on a public site. However, you are asking for trouble by reading this. I've warned you several times now, so I shall leave you in peace. You know what you are getting into now. Don't say I didn't warn you. *wicked laughter*
