      it's about 10 in the morning now.  Woke up and hopped right on my computer.  Checked my email and for any offline messages on yahoo... of course, nothing exciting.  Chatting with a friend of mine on yahoo who lives about 3 hours away from me.  Should drive up to see her soon. I drank a whole fuckin' 6 pack last night.  I so don't want to go to work today.  Don't really have a hangover... guess I'm just lucky this time.  My bed is calling to me something fierce.  I can already feel that this 9 hour work day is gonna feel like 18 hours.  I'm definitely not looking forward to it. Eh... I'll write more later.  I'm bored now.

      Just started this thing.  I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now, just to get these thoughts offa my chest.  It's about a quarter after 2 in the morning and I'm drunk.  Fuck, I have to work tomorrow.  However, this seemed a good time as any to start this shit... so why not?    Still not exactly what this entails, but fuck it.  If you want something spontaneous, you'll get it here....  So this is where it begins...  I'm 27, male, and a Scorpio. Those of you who believe in "what's your sign", you'll start to wonder what the fuck you were thinking.  Eh... maybe.  I do subscribe to a lot of Scorpio descriptions.... manic depressive, smart, sex-craved.... that would be me.  I'm an introvert mostly, but it's mostly forced upon me by my environment.  I can be a very outward person, but I'm very non-confrontational... so I'm an introvert.  Fuckin' sue me.  Re-write your books now, and fuck what planet is in what house.  That shit doesn't dictate what situations I'm dealing with day to day, aight?  Doesn't work that way. Anways... I'm very much into piercings and tattoos.  For you people out there that like to toss the word "poser" around, my first piercing was in '97.  When was yours?  I only say this because I was called this not too long ago... by someone very much younger than me and thinking that he had something to prove... so I beat him about the face with his definition of "poser".  He doesn't speak to me any more. I just got up to grab something to drink, sat back down and saw my "subject".  I imagine those of you who browse upon this nonsense will wonder what my religious affilition is.  Well, I have none.  None at all... I was an athiest.  I bet that the use of the word "was" does dissappoint some of you.  It happens.  It will happen.   My mom (more on her later) gave me a book to read once because I am interested in the Free Masons.  It was called "Holy Blood, Holy Grail".  I suggest it for any athiest, and any agnostic.  I have to say that I am more gnostic in my beliefs now... that book will open your eyes.  Read it and get back to me. I'm thinkin' about a certain set of tits right now, so it's time for a little self-loving followed by some sleepy time.    "Athiesm is a non-prophet organization"
