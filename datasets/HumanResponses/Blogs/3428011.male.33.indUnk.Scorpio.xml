      It always comes back to the raindrop that dries up the sea.   it can fill up your latest thought  and top up your cup of tea  the pure clear raindrop  falls aerodynamic and fast  from the darkest cloud and soaks the brown grass  slowly the blades go green again and the smell is familiar like the sqeaking tap in your sink or it's drip drip drip that bewilders  it always comes back to the raindrop that soaks my baseball mit it makes me think of the last time it was all ok to get wet  I think I'll take a walk to today and hope for clouds real dark It always comes back to my raindrop Let's go for a walk in the park

      I was near someone in the frat party in 1992 who had lost the plot. pissing on his shoes and laces standing in brown gas burnt and layered tight on the cement with water, and this a black below the brown that felt his urine lapping at its back and ears trying to disperse its busy bee  in desperation that was fading  rain and sweat mixing in his brow finally even in a basement with one light and grimacing with vaseline tears gluing down his face into a cake of five percent and purple cow and thirty-nine chin hairs talking of glory and  slamming its fists over and over hoping to flap wings to deliver him to his iron horse ticket and the letter A

      my latest thought was about the moon it goes so that we say the moon is half it also goes so we say of the moon quarter mistaken. it's mistaken. miss taken. the half moon is the quarter moon why we blink so long for the side dark? as such, there is no 'full moon' as we see it but we do know it. you do.

      "the ranta of the gallows in hunger that swallows the rightous who yell and scream  the belief of thee wild oats sown free I catch just a silver of the shadow  you have gone thee like a nightengale with song to the south where it feelis like heaven  crescendo and passion is for you your fashion take it now for tomorrow it could be gone  dichotomies can exist subsumed and persist along lines of duty and age  it was night I thee tell when the light it did fell on the cheeks of my most brazen of loves  tender fodder of toddler as she tomward me did I saw her and into my arms she did embrace  cherub of my blood her joy it does me flood sheechless, as a father I am amazed" -Fellsy, 2004

      182.30 gets me a ticket to infinite intimacy  across an expanse,  no expense.  Across the high interior plains  that look like cereal bowls  filled with wheat germ  blanketing the last few sales of the sunset  leaving me  to work the margins  to find myself.  taking the train  from one place to another.  things are still the same  unless of course,  you buy your ticket  while you are sleeping,  dreaming of breakfast.

      Nothing stays new like, for example the moment  just past it was new, but not now it jumped forward  to miss smashing my specs (they had fallen to the floor) I gounded them.  This is always the way They start new  like a sprout or a car wash or a slope or a breath or the edge of your bed or space invaders  Anything new will slide away down to the old how long can you hold on  to all that is new?  Not [-------------------------------------]  Long.                            This is why nothing stays new  The first sign  you can see of age comes only when you  have a scratch  on your glasses and see time watching you slide down

      The Brain once spoke:   "I believe you  that you had  the worlds most amazing dream,  few would. I too dream... I was living on the moon.  and I couldn't breath.  I had gills.  I had slit them in my throat.   It was beautiful nonetheless,  I was so very content.  Very ironic.  The sky was purple.  I was upset because I woke up."  I reply, "Gills."  Continuing, the Brain says,  "You don't say much in your pictures.  I may just like you best silent and unmoving."  Can one resist speaking with The Brain?  I had the worlds most amazing dream  just the other day - so real I built a space ship.   a 'flying saucer' and went into space ailerons everywhere they made sense to let it fly  I had to come back to earth  only now, solo, and in my shirt  a green shirt  made of the number 55 falling on my own free falling into the ocean just before I was abve Sudan I could see them running the marathon Plunging down 800m, back first to break the fall into warm ocean, (some kelp) of murky sunshine and bubbles  Back at home, strange aliens beings were born  of my next door neighbours body she was 28 and blonde she drank what I had given her  from my tap her mouth and throat eroded she fell to the ground and was dragged,  mysteriously across the hall and left with just her face,  tucked under a doormat another neighbour open his door  "Hello?"  (It was really Michael J Fox in a cigar gown) I say, "Look under your door mat" He leans downs and surprises her.   Kisses her face  She turns into a mouse, or maybe a mole Probably a mole  as it was a bit large  and quite fat It begins giving birth to many many strange beings. I had to clean then up. I filled two laundry baskets They were content  A few years pass  These aliens were super human-animals horses with 8 legs --->  double teaming a speed bike in the olympics beatles with 10 human arms ---> doing pole vault events  ..will have to tell you more about it soon. so tell me a story.

      Textures of your life shine into my eyes sometimes my heart depending on  who I see - when you let  me see you so so  strongly I  protect  you golden,   crystal  drops slide down my soul into my chamber of sorrow as you walk by without but a look when again? never? end. //

      Molten ice  drips evil on me coralling, mistering, compasing dim light has she echoing moans imprint my soul with a lifetime of love, pain takes  a toll - tis a small cost for  such a day, one I'll remember the biblical way. a cost is it, you shall pose..  my answer awaits a hermits prose. with limbs amok, sequents a floor asks she  take some more? Delay, ponder, contemplate till sore her adive to me  some molten  ice  more

      Likity split with a twist of the tongue frolicking in sand, kicking the bum drunk and disorderly he sips from his bag Dribbles some drips as he sees an old bag He stumbles towards her and gives her a kiss She tells him to "f**k off" "you give me the shits" The drunk heaves and groans, and yanks on his tool "i'm not silly old grumpy old fool"  Lying in his vomit, the cops pick him up chuck his bony ass in the back of the truck Off to the cell, but asleep he does lie little they know, but he actually cried. He missed his young family, he missed his old mates. Was this 'orrible life, his fortune, his fate.  No way yelled the drunk as he smashed through the doors Ran down the beach, sometimes on all fours He got to the shore and was met by a mermaid beautiful and soft, her hair in a tight braid.  She cuddled him gently and played with his hair her porked her real hard though his member was bare thay laughed and they giggled as the waves lapped them up "F**k my bottle, where is it, he quickly stood up  The cops all in blue where they're all the same They said "pull up his pants, you're just insane" It was just a dream, he was just a bum But hell he liked pissing it up in the sun  -by Crazy Cricket...2002

      No dingoes, only dead ringers for travellers on time and sand High water table for four with cougars, unframed, serving not lemon or lime jello artifact Roaming off as the sea bull sees triple red sets  that make the sand look far And hunts its prey at the altar to change a twenty dollar bill The shade of her finger back to forth Makes the fingertip black as blackass

      There was a dream the fire had died All there was eyes open wide Icy walls met sun-baked soil A winter's pocket sensed turmoil  Slopes of calm paved in sedation People gathered in contemplation The sun fell fast, a tired horizon It's kicking horse our fate lies on (They would stand still, believing still air it so fine)  Alarms high but no surprises Then a martyr he who dies is The slopes awake to protect in kind By a high sun trigger they did find They ran west again The coasts sight would all mend  When I awoke I was the pass I felt remorse they died alas My bare feel stood on their course Below which lies Kicking Horse

      The earth is 70% water The human body is 70% water. This is no mistake. Notice now sex includes "ex" Notice now Women includes "omen" Notice now danger includes "anger" Notice now devil includes "evil" Notice also turmoil includes "oil" Yet notice wheat includes "eat" and Moron includes 'Ron' Surely this is no mistake, Ron.

      I was serious when I wrote this  but now I am smiling  I was smiling when I wrote this but and now I am trying  I was trying when I wrote this but now I am failing  I was failing when I wrote this but now I am thinking  I was thinking when I wrote this  and now I am a cricket  I was a cricket when I wrote this and now I rubbing my legs together  I was rubbing my legs together when I wrote this but now I am making music  I was making music when I wrote this but now I am hearing things  I was hearing things when I wrote this and now small eyes are staring at me  I had small eyes staring at me from the cedar when I wrote this and now I can see  I could see when I wrote this  and caught all the crickets thinking about failing while trying to smile seriously.

      He sits in that place looking at the stone faces,   thinking of an air conditioned raise and a white noise eulogy to the present  "Surely this is not related", she yells from inside his head  "Is that why are like this?" (Is this why you are like that?) "How can you?" ... He stretches his arms wide open  and then sways back in his $500 chair and says "No way".  So, I get back to work  waiting for that voice dreaming of the  age my face  turns to  stone

      Why does my breath smell like forest fire?  There are no trees in me,  or brush, that I know of  nor is there an environment in which a fire could burn... but I know.  I know what I smell,  and I know what I taste.

      On broadland pills the score is nil and sick The people look up and see the world as clouds and not land, nor food, not a mood not to study or to be astute or real or crude  There is a camel and a man both who miss what they know is real but breathe and suck and sit and squeal  She walks among the dead with eyes of Jade convincing the cynical of beauty so rare but real enough to convince one of justice and truth  -collaboration with pett, 2004

      Maybe this feel right but what if i've made a wrong turn and demons will turn my reality into a living hell! Hell fire is a wash of cloud blackness, blackness which runs deep.  So pick your number and be your house. Your house makes love under the sparkle of moons so bright as to wash smiles from your face.  Delicately then, I spin songs waiting in your place. Flowers will wash their smells among the villians of your soul freshening your ego to make sense of the day.  Stopping not for a quarter or a little maid as a servant bound by the culture we so ignorant create.  A life shining and sedate, soft and real too late to relate soft and real so far to date.  Stripes in black so bountiful make men spin. Her lines-of-best-fit are of zen and why not for Mary for you and I are getting scary  And so full of romance, they dance among the toilets and sinks of sin, and I stand waiting for a song, a verse that's not wrong but lazy today, I say I'm a new corker any other day  -collaboration with pett, 2004

      Just got home from a night out with 2 friends here in Toronto.  Barry is one of the good old boys. He's in the mix with a new girl named Amber who is 23 and he thinks he likes her. I met her.  She is nice. He drank vodka.  Dave, is married and has been with Michelle for 11 years.  Dave is from age 15, we played baseball together. He was a pitcher who used to get stressed on the mound, but could throw smoke. I know this.  He may forget.  He's a close friend. He is going to Journalism school soon. He drank vodka and then finished with a beer, and left first.  Only barry and I danced.  I boogied down and looked like the beaver. (Dave wrote on beer coasters with a green pen)  I liked getting down, solo with the funk being played at Ciao Edie, a Toronto bar. Noticed no one else and had a good time.  I drank vodka until I was sober.  Now, I am going to have a cup of tea and some peanut butter on italian bread. It is 3:43.

      I am but a servant of my instruments taken into my hands ignited by collaboration they serve upon me a portal  evanesce  silver surfing galactic wind magic carpet vapour trail swirling desert thermal weaving Darko serpent bear me on my Odyssey  sempiternity  right here, time stops, I am ended I swim away from the beach and let the depths take me  deeper ...deeper ... ...deeper  my boundaries dissolve, I am and are of something else I release my corpus from thrall  praxis  I am but a servant of my instruments  - jg, 2004

      it is because I have it. therefore, so long as I am, it is.  I just chopped off my pinky as a test of my being  your axe is soft in hue and has a glisening texture it makes a wet plumb look like a wet tire your axe was made by a craftsman of high distinction, with a fine brush and hands with time, but a wrist with no watch  soon, it will be your time to fell the greatest music fuelling fires of sound for millennia and more leaving nothing but your watch reflecting past their eyes
