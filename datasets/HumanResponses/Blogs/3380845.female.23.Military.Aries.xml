      today was yet another exhausting day. another fun filled day of packing, packing and well what do you know more packing. tomorrow i get to go store away all my personal belongings and well that's it. i'm pretty tired and my mind can't think too much right now. hopefully if you're at this address you all understand how to get here and have an idea as to what this whole journal thing is. it's my bedtime time now so good night. pleasant dreams sleep with the angels.

       first of all hello everyone. i knew you guys would check up on me eventually. today has been such an exhausting day. after finally finding out yeterday that yes i would be going it's been non stop packing and buying stuff for whne i leave on monday supposedly. this morning i started the long task of packing up my room and then went to medical for this whole smallpox brief. yeah like i want that shot. i still had stuff to buy so it was time to shop. not for the good stuff though like clothes and what not. i've spent the entire evening packing my seabags and am frsutrated. i ws doing good then i don't know what went wrong. all that miscellaneous stuff we are to pack has taken up alot of space surprisingly. i told myself i wouldn't go to bed until i got it all packed but i'm tired. i am yet to go find a storage for all my stuff that was in my room too. oh well. maybe tomorrow won't be so frustrating. tkae care and god bless.    &nbsp;  sherie

      i need some damn sleep. i of course had to work last night in which i was unable to get any sleep. when i was supposed to get relieved by the other crew i had to wait because they had some formation and me and this other guy had to stay back. well when they finally finished and i got to leave i was tole i had to stay back and go with the duty driver on some stupid errands. by the time we got the srupid humvv and a damn radio it was about 0830. i got to my tent around 0835 and thought that maybe i could make it to breakfast even though it ened at nine. i went to the restroom and upon returning to my tent was told i had to be in the rec tent to clean up at 0845. so much for breakfst.  once that was done i had to go drive with the duty driver to pick up the laundry and mail. that wasnt exactly a short drive. it took forever and boy was the ride bumpy. i got to see the lake though. wow from the distance i saw it at and from what little i saw it was nice. i got to look at the scnerey which consisted of you guessed it....sand. then we go to get the mail only to have to get a slap in the face since no one had a mail card. why didn't i think of that. by the time we unloaded the laundry back at the tents and stuff it was about 1100. i took a shower and straightened up my little amount of space. by the time i was done i decided to lay down finally around 1220. i ended up having to get up around 1245 to get dressed for lunch since i told strasle i would and because well i hadn't eaten a damn thing. now i'm here and it's about 1430. i'm so tired but if i sleep now i won't sleep tonight. i get to be up by 0900 tomorrow or a fun-filled day of filling sandbags on of course my "day off". how lucky huh. at least i'm doing good and keeping safe i guess that's all that matters. other then that i think i'll take it easy today maybe go read another book. in the what almost 3 weeks i've been here i've managed to read 2 books. i'll have read a whole library by the time i leave this place. oh well it helps pass the time. everyone take care and god bless. get some sleep also. well for me at least since i can't seem to be able to at the moment.

      well it's me. well duh who else would it be right. today's yet another day here in my world iraq. it's barley lunch time though so. i had a late breakfast so i'll skip that. i took my approach test for work today so see how that turned out. i have to go back at 1330 to see how i did. i must say i had a brain fart through some of it. it's been almost a month or more since i've done any type of book work. hell when's the lst time i opened up a 7110 or something. for those who don't know what a 7110 is... it's a big book of knowledge for us air traffic controllers. i'll let you know how i did.  so my friend strasler and freddie j made it here safely. they got here last night and will be here till the other guys leave in about two weeks. they're due back in the states aroung mid-august so let's all wish for a safe return home for all of them. they've done their job well and now it's our turn to hold down the fort.  hopefully evrything in texas and nc and ny (roxana and claudia) and everywhere else you guys are at is going good. don't have too much fun while i'm away. you all take care and i'll take care of myself also.  much love to all.

      well here i am yet agin to fill you in on my "fabulous day" here in my world iraq. today has seemed like the longest day since i've been here. we had pt from 0700-0800 and then we had 45 minutes for chow. yeah like 45 min is enough for me to throw up the 'do and go eat and come back in time for our next task at 0845. here's where the fun begins. we had the privilege of filling sand bags for about 3 hours or so. i was hurting ready to pass out. shoveling all that sand. i'll have muscles so big by the time i leave this place. then we got to take the laundry to the rec tent and wait for water to be delivered. well we waited and waited and then said forget it. i took my long awited shower and went to chow. i  must have been extremely hungry because that cheeseburger and fries was delicious. i then took the walk to my tent and had planned on going to the internet shack after heading to the bathroom. well i walk into the tent and couldn't believe how hot it was. who would be so stupid as to turn off the damn a/c. little did i know we had no power and out room was now the tent 2c52 sauna. aaahhhh!!!!!!!!! i sat in there for awhile before realizing it was actually cooler outside. so everyone sat and sat and sat. we had a couple people sitting around in some kiddie-pools and i mean kiddie-pools and filling water ballons. they made sure to keep everyone nice and cool by throwing them all around. the next thing you know about 1 1/2 hours later or so the power kicks back on. boy was i glad. it actually wasn't that bad waiting outside though. i got to work up a slight tan so. of course thanks to all that sweating i had to go take another shower. now here i am blabbing off my wonderful story to you guys. tomorrow's another work day so...  on a good note my good and bestest friend brandon strasler is due here in a few days. i can't wait to see him. if anyone has ever helped me out so much it's gotta be him. even if i mad fun of him or cracked jokes about oh everything he's the greatest. i'll be sure to keep you guys informed of how he's doing. he's heading back to the states soon so may he have a safe return home.  for now i must go rest and get ready for tomorrow's work day and go eat my dinner, an apple. take care everyone. miss and love you guys much. 2 the moon and back, 2 infinty and beyond.

      well i'm finally here at this said place and it's freakin hot. most of you know this by now being that i've contacted most of you. for those who i haven't forgive me but... well forgive me. this place is hot yet not too bad. the food isn't mexican food, and it's definatley not texas. but still it's good enough so what can i say. i'm tired and ready to go to bed but it's barely 4 p.m. those damn night shifts mess up my whole sleep schedule. what am i talking about i can't even get used the the whole time adjustment. other then that i'm doing decent and i'm hungry. time to go find something to eat. let's see my choices are chowhall and well taco bell is out of the question so chowhall it is. and for you mom... i know growing up as a kid when it came to not liking the food you served for dinner your favorite reply was take it or leave it. i must say around here it's alot easier to just leave it and settle for a bag of chips. and you thought you were teaching me a lesson that would help me eat my food. good try. i'm sure eventually i'll just take the food though one day. and for you greg & brandon, thank you so much for helping me get ready for this deployment. i would've gone crazy without you guys. even though you were miles away brandon you're great advice of what to bring and all the good advice of what to expect helped out more then you can imagine. you guys are the greatest. till next time......take care and god bless everyone, you're all in my prayers.
