      Can you see through the things that are impure? Destiny, fate, should you let yourself beleive? My mind cannot desipher the signals, confused, confused. A circle we go around in becuase we dare not stop it. Stupified as if by the stare of Medusa herself. Does it exsist? Love in the truest, most pure of forms? Fuck-bitch, you've played the prodigal whore a thousand times, maybe you are becoming what you never wanted to be, maybe you were always that girl.  Breathe in and fill your lungs with the breath of staleness, that is where you are right now, in a room full of stale air and everything is old and overstuffed and if you were to breathe in that putrid air, surely, you would choke. No one is in there with you, you are alone but the whole world knows you are in that stale room. No one moves, "hold your own" they say, if it doesn't kill you then surely...

      How to even begin today? I can feel the swampy, energy drained weight of my body fighting against me, my bones almost screaming in denial. I hate the waiting, it feels like waiting for a war to commence, baited breath and all. I am sleeping on empty dreams now, I have almost become the death angel, oh, but she is beauty, she is true purity, yes?

      Deep inside me lives a voice that will not calm itself. It is a voice of chaos and confusion, it is the driving force behind many a foolish thing. When my life becomes dull, grey or restless; it is then that I feel this voice stir, like wayward leaves caught in an autumn wind. It dances on the edge with me, daring me, tempting me to go over. It is coy and beautifully mallicious.  These days of my life go by like the pages of a book in the wind, with all of the important things caught in my mind like little catch phrases. I seek true love, to carry it around with me in my pocket; a small comfort in a world of discomfort. I do not understand my place in life, my purpose shall we say. I seek knowledge, challenge, and a space to grow. I seek an alcove of comfort and warmth, a warm port where I can feel safe and calm.

      Hmm, I often feel as though I run in circles, many, many of them, all overlapping each other but, of course, none of them ever going anywhere but back into each other.  We never want to lose sight of dreams, of pure angst. Nobody wants to be thirty and say "I haven't changed... that much..." I have come to learn that is gets more and more difficult not to trade in blue jeans for breifcases as we age. I never want to be that, I never want to lose heart, to become a social creature. I want always to dream and sway, to grow and learn. Always to remeber where I came from and never to know for certain where I am headed.  However, on weeks such as this, I feel life draining me, making me dull and horribly mundane, it taunts me with beauty that is just beyond my reach. I feel pure terror at the thought of becoming ordinarily domestic. Dream a little dream...
