						   Well, we took advantage of the long week-end  (yes, even retired folks like long weekends) took time off from Ebay and decided to redecorate the guest bathroom (since Dee will be here in less than 2 weeks to stay awhile....that spurned me to get it done NOW)  It took 4 complete days of cursing and struggling and that was just to decide what color to paint...(ok also stripping wallpaper, modernizing all the wall switches &  outlets, replacing towel holders, etc..!)   But after buying 2 different colors because I couldn't decide what color to use, .... I decided to take a risk and just go for it and do something different.    Well, I succeeded... and I Love It!!  Tomorrow I'll go to TJ Maxx and get a few finishing touches, but the hard part is finally done!!   Good bye Sunflowers, black and white stripes and hello?????  No this is something you just will have to see for yourself...  ... Let's just say Barney would feel right at home....

						   Hi All  Ana Maria called yesterday and I asked her about a few more of the "unknown people" in the pix.  She said the "bare chested "warrior" guy on some of the pictures was actually a caretaker on Grandpa's and Mamaya's Ranch.  Apparently they had exotic birds and even a monkey.  His name was Goyo (the caretaker...not the monkey)  and he was around a lot.  Also the "unknown" woman... really pretty dark haired lady in a picture by herself - is Marta.  she was a long time girlfriend of Salva.  She also is one of the ladies sitting on the grass (3 people in the pix - great scene of a hillside..man leaning on the fence .. no one looking at the camera)  Also, the man in the high top cowboy boots is Manual.  Grandma's mother (Mamaya) More to follow later....

						   Hope everyone has enjoyed the awesome pictures from Ana Maria.  I have numbered and assigned temporary titles to each of them, to help identify them and when we discuss them.  Ana has promised to send me more pix as soon as her son, Jose scans them onto a CD.    I plan to have more information on each picture by the end of the summer when either Ana Maria comes to San Jose or I go down to LA to get the info in person.  Have a great week-end!

						   Hey everybody I created this website as a way to keep in touch with everybody, it's called a blog, basically it's a place where you can write whatever you like from how your feeling today to what your doing this weekend. You can also post photos and links to web pages. Lets give it a try.

						   Well, I'm taking care of Jaime today...  she had all 4 wisdom teeth removed this morning.  Took Dentist 2 1/2 hours to do the procedure.  Much longer than he expected...but it has now been about 4 hours since it was all over and she's doing pretty good.  I've haven't let her sleep since she got home, because she needs the ice packs changed on her face every 15 minutes.... 15 min.. 15 off.. and gauze changes every hour...so I've been pretty busy.  I've fed her jello and choc pudding and not much else.  She's watching tv and taking little naps in between the ice pack changes.    It wasn't much consolation when I told her that Danny had recently been told he had "no wisdom" teeth so he didn't have to go through this mess.   (I only had 1 and Dan had 4... so Jaime's only comment was "Thanks Dad")   Aaron will be taking over this evening and continue to take care of her over the week-end because I'm going camping with Gwen and her sisters very early tomorrow morning and spending the week-end at Lake Solano near Sacramento.    Girls Only....Camping Trip...  Dan stays home

						   Hey all, my weekend is starting out great.Renee and I went to the Orange county fair. We had a fantastic time, we saw the new ginszu knife,some amazingly absorbant shammys,and a vegetable chopper that is dish-washer safe. I was also feeling adventurous and tried the deep-fried twinkis and snickers. The deep-fried twinki was so-so but the deep-fried snickers was really really good.~Dan

						   Well.. I did it... I actually decided to try to set-up my "old" laptap computer with a wireless modem, so I could use my DSL on both computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked up up the wireless modem and computer card for a clearance price of only $50.00&nbsp; (Aaron says I got a terrific deal)&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few false starts... I actually got the laptop to work!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It only took about 1 1/2 hrs.. but the time was well worth it..&nbsp; so I'm officially a computer geek!!  Dan is happy, since I'm usually the one who "hogs" the computer all day and he never gets to check out the web.&nbsp; I also wanted to be able to access the web from the kitchen and garage where I would be able to do some ebay research without dragging the stuff into the computer room.  Also, some of you know that I'm volunteering at a local thift shop in Almaden Valley and they have decided to work out a "deal" where I would sell some items for them on eBay.&nbsp;&nbsp; I convinced them, when I told them they were "literally giving away" some of the stuff when they could make a lot more.&nbsp;&nbsp; (i. e. they sell all cameras for only $30.00 !!! )&nbsp; (I was there on Friday, when someone donated a nice looking Minolta SLR with attachments, priced it and sold it within a few minutes!!!&nbsp; )&nbsp; They now have a note to give all cameras to me....&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give them a&nbsp;discount to sell the stuff, since it is for charity....  Jaime & Aaron come home from Canada tomorrow... unfortunately, Aaron's grandpa, passed away last Friday and they attended the funeral today....&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaime was glad she was able to meet and talk to him last week several times....

						   Hey Fam, I hope you all had a great weekend. So far I have, Friday&nbsp;I took the new girl I'm dating, Renee to Pasadena to see an outdoor movie "the 7 year itch: starring Marilyn Monroe". Then on Saturday we went to a&nbsp;local museum. It's called the Bowers museum, they have a great display of cultural artifacts/&nbsp;buddist pieces from Tibet. It's a cool place to go and learn something about other cultures/religons. We spent a few hours there then after relaxing a while we went and saw "the Bourne Supremecy" It was a fun sequel that I highly recommend if you enjoyed the "bourne Identity" definetly a good action popcorn movie. Today I'll be catching up on fun stuff like laundry and setting up my new computer, but it won't be too bad I picked up "rubber soul UK" to listen to while I do my "chores". TTyl&nbsp; ~Dan

						   Thanks Mom and Dee for taking the time to write. My weekend was pretty relaxing, I bought a new beach cruiser this week and I've been riding it all over town. Yesterday I rode to downtown,it's about 4 miles one way, I caught the movie I,robot. with Will Smith. It was a fun scifi/action movie. Then I spent most of the day reading and chilling at the beach. Today I did alot of the same relaxing and reading, then to a friends house to watch HBO. This week should be busy as usual, I hope everyone has a good work week. ~Dan

						   Hi Everyone: Another fun weekend! lots of errands. Tom and I are getting ready to move into our new digs in Sunnyvale. We should be moving in by the end of July. (I am sure Kathy and Dan will be "glad" to have their home back!!!) . We found a great bargain on Craig's list today, we bought a stackable washer/dryer and then Dan Sr was nice enough to go with Tom to pick it up. Ed Sr was here this weekend, he bbq'd for Cyrena's going away party for Sergio (he leaves tomorrow for his Marine boot camp). The food was great as usual!! It has been warm (though not as warm as it has been in Oakhurst) I am so glad to be back in the Bay Area - traffic and all! I have been at my job now for 6 weeks and will find out in two weeks if my contract will be extended and for how long - the hardest part is the waiting! Well, enough about us for now! &nbsp; Dee

						   Hey everybody I hope you all had fun weekends. Mine was pretty cool, I went and saw the new Will Ferrel movie "Anchorman" if you like his other films and  silly movies you'll like this also. I also went to the long beach aquarium. it was cool but nowhere as good as the monterey bay one but it had some cool stuff to see. It was a little crowded though, I say we start a campain to ban strollers in any public place. Until I have kids at least. Well enough of that stuff Goodnight.  P.s Don't feel shy about posting try it you might like it.

						   Good morning all! Danny -- way "cool" pics! Jaime -- PEI looks beautiful!! have added the pics site to my favorites so I can really take my time to browse through them without having to type in the address everytime.  Had a really good time this weekend - Brother Al stopped & visited with us Friday night on his way up to join  Peggy & the girls in Seattle.  So good to see him & the chance to visit.  JW (my John) has developed in interest (LOL an obsession!) with didgeridoos (Australian Aborigene musical instrument) & has bought several of them -- as I said, an obsession! He really enjoys playing them - anywhoo -- there was a didgeridoo get-together this last weekend that we attended and had loads of fun.  When we get our new computer, I'll post some pictures of JW's didges & some of our house. Danny -- thanks again for setting up this site &amp; keeping the family "in-the-know"  Love to all -- Aunt Marina

						   Hey all, I hope you had great weekends. Mine was one to remember, I got the opportunity to go on a free 3 day scuba trip to San Clemente island. It was aboard a luxury yacht out of San Diego. There were 4 of us diving plus a crew of 2. The 3 other divers are all published scuba photographers and journalists. They sure taught me alot in 3 days. Now about the diving it was phenomenal!! Visibility underwater was from 40'-85'. During one dive I did find myself alone with about 5-8 sharks all about 5 to 6ft in length. I was a little nervous but they were not aggressive. I also got to dive with a giant black sea bass which is in the picture below. Altogether I made 7 dives in 3 days all were very memorable. ~Dan P.S. also I found out the picture with 2 diver (I'm the diver in the distance will be used as a poster for the upcoming San Diego underwater film festival. Both Photos are by Eric Hanauer

						   Hi Everyone..  Just wanted to share a few new pictures of Peekaboo.   Unfortunately she still has her "skin problems" so she must wear her "hood ornament"....  I'm taking her to a specialist on the 12th of this month and hopefully the new doc can help me determine what is wrong.   In the meantime, she happily takes a daily "walk" with Dan and me.

						   Hi Everyone: Tommy and I would like to give a great big thank you to Ed Sr, Craig, Kathy, Dan Sr, Johnny, Karen, Nathan, Andrew, Dave and Gwen for all the help they gave us this past weekend during our move from Oakhurst back to Sunnyvale!!  You were a godsend to us - we had some real challenges with U-Haul (They didn't have the 26' truck that Tommy had reserved) and all they had was a 14' truck - Tommy ended up making two back to back trips - Saturday with a truckload and trailer load of boxes and, Sunday with the furniture.  Ed Sr helped Tommy load the truck in Oakhurst and then made the trip to Sunnyvale to help Tommy and me unload all the boxes! Tommy and Ed then only took time for a quick lunch and then headed back to Oakhurst Saturday afternoon to load the truck and trailer with furniture, Ed, Tommy and Craig were up till midnight loading the furniture. Craig also returned the next morning to finish up loading and to make sure Tommy got on the road safely (he even had to chase him down to give him two of the dining table legs that Tommy had left behind!).  Tommy then made another trip Sunday morning with the second load. Johnny, Karen and the boys arrived first at our new house and helped me unpack the kitchen boxes while we were waiting for Tommy to arrive. The boys set up my pantry (canned goods and hung up Tommy's and my clothes !). Kathy and Dan arrived next and Johnny and Dan unloaded our stackable washer/dryer from Dan's truck.  Dave and Gwen (bearing a delightful box of her homemade peanutbutter cookies!!) arrived just before Tommy and then  everyone  helped unload the truck of all our furniture!! It is hard to believe how much furniture can be packed in a 14' truck!  It all was unloaded safely and placed in their proper places - with the living room the last room and the most fun to be arranged - everyone had a different idea of how the furniture in there should be placed and the guys had "fun" moving the pieces around according to the varying opinions!!!!  Having all of you help made this a far easier move than if we had had to do it ourselves and we both want to give you all a warm  THANK YOU!!  You all earned a lot of Karma points!   Our new address and phone numer is: 412 Cirrus Ave Sunnyvale, CA 94087 (408) 773-0733
