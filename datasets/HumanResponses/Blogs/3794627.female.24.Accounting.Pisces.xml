      It seems quite apt that I have that picture of Kate (dog) licking her lips in my profile.  This morning we experienced a little bit of guinea pig-dog horror! It has a happy ending, don't worry.  So Kate normally lives with my parents... she is diabetic and needs 2 insulin shots a day, at the same time every day, it is much easier for my parents to look after her. However, my parents have gone on holidays (how dare they??) and Derek and I are babysitting Kate. Well, Kate is fascinated by our pigs. She stares at them in their cages, trembling with excitement. She looks like a very tightly wound spring that is about to explode. Generally, we don't let her linger in the pigs' room.  Well this morning I got up at 6-something to give her her insulin and breakfast in the laundry and stumbled back to bed. Apparently, I didn't barracade the pig's room off well enough. An hour or so later I woke up to a sharp, excited bark. I told Derek (through my laryngitis) to go check on Kate. She was [b]in[/b] the girls' cage and it was a mess - hay spread everywhere, their food bowls broken, the top level broken and Lucy missing!!  Well to cut the story short, Lucy didn't get eaten, we found her cowering behind Tuck's cage. I don't know how she got out... but we rebuilt the cage with extra reinforcements.  Gosh that was stressful!

      Somehow I am feeling inspired to start a blog.  I am not entirely sure why - I don't anticipate that it will be a buzzing hub of activity. I have always been terrible at keeping diaries. I think my best record was some time in year 7 when I made 2 entries on 2 consecutive days... and then silence for months and months. This whole blog thing will probably turn out to be just another one of those blips of activity that will soon be eclipsed by total nothingness again. Oh well!  Right now I am supposed to be working, I am taking a "coffee break" - mainly to warm up my icy fingers - so I can't really write a whole lot now. Workwise, I am wading through the Federal Parliament Hansard (parliamentary transcripts) for info on the Roads-to-Recovery Programme. Politicians are verbose! Just one transcript goes over hundreds of pages. Surprisingly, some bits are quite interesting and the debates get quite heated and entertaining at times. According to Derek, the parliamentarians allowed to shout at each other anymore because the girl with headphones who records everything is beginning to show signs of industrial deafness!  Okay.  Back to work.  I wonder when my next post will be!
