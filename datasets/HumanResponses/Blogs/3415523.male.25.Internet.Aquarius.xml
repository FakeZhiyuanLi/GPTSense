      Dedicated to Ekta Kapoor.  Acknowledgements  This book would not have been possible without the combined efforts of certain specie residing in Bangalore, and of course Ekta Kapoor and her Spooky villa better known as Krishna Cottage. In addition, I also wish to thank my neighbors, rats squeaking at ungodly hours near my house, a couple of cats wanting to kill those rats, and a dog which I am not very friendly with, but keeps the cats away to my dismay.  Contents  Chapter 1: The History of the Ring Chapter 2: The Curse of the Ring Chapter 3: Samara’s viewpoint Chapter 4: The old man and the horse Chapter 5: The strange kid Chapter 6: The Hotel and The well. Chapter 7: The Ring. Appendix A, B and C.  Author’s note – viewing audience are kindly request to avoid reading Chapter 5 through 7 as they may contain horrific details, and may spoil your mood.  Chapter 1:  The History of the Ring.  First of all, this Ring is not to be confused with Lord of the Ring’s Ring. This Ring is categorically different from Sauron’s Ring, in the sense that the Ring in question is an illusion. The Ring does not exist, but it can been seen. Something like Matrix – You cannot be shown the Matrix,  you have to see it yourself. Similarly this Ring appears in different forms and illusions, which one must look out for. A brief history of the ring – There was a video tape. How it got made, no body knows, no body cares. It exists, and therefore it is.  No, the video tape has nothing about Ring, but only an illusion again. The tape is cursed, and anyone who sees it shall not live to see the 8th day of their life.   Chapter 2: The Curse of the Ring  Once there was a beautiful girl and her room mate. The girl and her roommate were enjoying a quiet dinner, when they decide to spook each other. It was there that the first instance of the video tape was made. One of the girls gleefully claims she has seen the tape which kills you after 7 days, and it was her seventh day, that day. A few minutes later, she dies, and her friend remains paralyzed.  Enter the heroine; author regrets he cannot remember her name – heroine is a relative to the girl who died, and is also a journalist. Her 5 year old son is smarter than her in most things, but is spooky himself. He was the closest to the girl who died, and hence  can feel her around, though how when why where is not be questioned. The heroine sets out on a goose hunt about the possibilities of the girl’s death, and comes across the tape.  She watches the tape at night, and as the legend goes, you get a call from someone right after it ends to tell you about the 7 days time. The phone call was made; She makes a few copies of the same for further investigation, however like all filmy moms, forgets the important one at home, which her son like all filmy sons decides to watch. So, her son too is cursed the next day. And since she shows the video to her boyfriend too for further investigation, he too is cursed for 7 days. The heroine is about to embark a race against time to save herself and know more about the ring.  Chapter 3: Samara’s viewpoint.  There existed a girl called Samara on an island. She was born to a woman who had 64 abortions, and much to surprise of many was born. It is said that she was cursed since beginning, and her birth had a serious repercussion on her mother as well, who, was actually mentally deranged. Her father locks her up in attic above the horse shed, where Samara is made to live in shoddy conditions, and that is when her evil powers begin to surface. A freak accident involving killing of people and horses, Samara is investigated by the local police. Her only need in life was she wanted to be heard by people about her.  She feels sorry about the whole killing thing, but she cannot do anything about it – the curse has been fallen. All she needs in return is others to know about her.   Later, the deranged mother, pushes Samara into the well, killing her, and then puts up slab to cover the well. Look carefully, it’s the first instance of the ring – as Samara drowns and keeps her eyes fixed above, a ambiguous hand slides the slab on the well – and when its nearly complete, just before the complete darkness, she can make out the ring of light she has seen.  Chapter 4: The old man and the horse  The heroine is out to the island depicted in the video she saw. In midst of nearing the island, a horse jumps out of nowhere and commits suicide. Poor she, for she does not know the history behind the horse. Samara hates horses, and she killed them while she was young. And yes, the curse remains – horses die or commit suicide on the island. Yes, but the heroine is still not aware.  The heroine at the house of an old man – yes it is the house she has seen in the video. The old man is not friendly, but as she later finds out, he is the father of Samara. His wife died, and before he is able to help the heroine out of her life saving trauma, he kills himself by shocking himself – quite literally.  The heroine must find the truth quickly now.  Chapter 5: The strange kid.  Her kid is cursed. He used to be strange anyways, but now he claims he can see the girl who died. He claims strange things at home. At one instance in school, he literally draws rings and rings together – again a mere illusion of the ring, signifying the ring Samara saw.   The curse is working on the hero too – his face is disfigured when he gets a photo of himself. He is busy trying to figure out where Samara was born and where was she killed. On the sixth day, he is finally able to do so, and gets to see Samara’s video of mental delusions.  As described above, the above events occur after this.  Chapter 6: The Hotel and the Well.  The heroine has discovered the well Samara was buried.  It is the same place where she saw the video for the first time. With her boyfriend and time at stake, she rushes to the hotel and digs. The day is ending, but they are still trying to find the well – it is below the room she and the girl stayed.  The day is ending, and its already the 7th day.  Tearing through,  walls, they come to a desolate basement, and there lies the well.   In trying to uncover it and looking in, the heroine falls in. No she does not die, but meets Samara down there, which finally crushes to bones. Up above, before she hits the bottom, the Slab slides again to close, and yet again as Samara, the heroine sees the ring form of light. After Samara crushes, away, the hero is able to save her, and she finally believes that she is safe.  Chapter 7 : The Ring.  She didn’t get it. The next day, the hero dies watching Samara come out alive. It is then it strikes her about Samara’s statement – “she wants to be heard”. She knows now it can’t stop, but it can be prevented. She knows now, that if you can make a copy of it and show it to someone else and let Samara be heard, you did be safe. That’s the reason she is herself alive – she showed it to her boyfriend. Promptly she makes sure her son makes a copy.  Her son simply asks – what will happen to the person whom she shows the video to?  Appendix A There is a part 2 coming.  Appendix B The original in Japanese is equally scary. For information, Ringu (in Japanese) has got around 5 parts. A prequel, and 2 sequels and the one more in middle.   Appendix C: Enjoy the movie.  © Suyog Deshpande.  The above content was originally posted on  urlLink Mouthshut.com  under the username  urlLink suyog .

       Did your dog run away? Call  Rimjhim  for help.  Is your son plotting to kill you and take away all the wealth? No problem – Rhimjim helps solve the issue.  Is your daughter in law 1 conspiring against daughter in law 2 and planning to frisk her son? Rhimjim makes sun shine.  Is your neighbor’s wife having an affair with your boss? Rhimjhim ahoy!  Do you need a lawyer, a soothsayer, a spiritualist, a mother teresa? Rhimjim again!   To solve all the associated sundry events and quandaries of this world, there is none but Rhimjim, whose life is perpetually on tenterhooks trying to bring about world peace and harmony to herself, her house, dogs, cats and a depressed teddy bear passing off as head of family. (The depressed teddy bear is courtesy MS member Suprena1). That in sums up what this serial tries to pass off as –  Piya Ka Ghar.    -----------------------------------------------------------  Of course, I am yet to figure out whose Piya and whose Ghar it all belongs to. A complicated whirlwind of a story hasn’t helped either. A mega large family (why can’t people in serials produce lesser number of children simply fails me!), with a depressed teddy bear leads the cast of this serial. Other delectable members of this enterprising family are –  3 monkeys passing of as teddy bear’s sons.  A vixen with broken legs passing off as teddy bear’s wife. All that the vixen has to do in the serial is growl menacingly at any passerby and utter a few words like “Aey Ladki” with utmost glee.  A confused hedgehog with glasses passing off as teddy bear’s sister. The hedge at most times accompanies the vixen and loves to shirk its  thorns every time the vixen gets hyper active.  2 Hippos passing off as 1st and 2nd  monkey’ wives. The elder hippo loves to play the disgruntled villain not satisfied with the ocean around it and tries to aim the stars, while the second hippo gives it immense competition being equally wily, and at the same time getting involved in underworld, world politic and the likes.  Oh yea, there is a third hippo always scheming and plotting of eating other’s babies – I mean stealing someone else’s babies.  A couple of foxes, a cow passing off as politician, a buffalo  as underworld mafia and a rather slimy giraffe make up for the rest of the inmates of this zoo.  Meet the zoo keeper –  Rhimjim.   -----------------------------------------------------------  If Rhimjim is not getting the teddy bear to smile, then she is either settling a bout between the two hippos, or is trying her best not to uproar the vixen and its companied. If Rhimjim is not pleasing her monkey, then she is busy stopping the other two monkeys from tearing each other’s hair out. And if Rhimjim is not doing anything in particular, there is always the giraffe who threatens to run away with her beloved monkey. The of course, the cow straying 10 miles away is as much her business as much as the black buffalo (No, its not a paradox!), is her concern as well. In between, she also keeps busy shooing away un-required species like mamaji-fox and other sundry elements.   The three monkeys while their time in business pleasures, and fight amongst themselves. The first 2 monkeys want the cage torn down, which causes the teddy bear to have  multiple bouts of hysteria and heart attacks – alas, not once does he die. Why the teddy  tries to hang himself once, but the whole circus troupe somehow manage to save him. Anyhow, I hope you got the gist of it all.   Of course the receiving end of all this is the zoo keeper called Rhimjim. The inmates have such tremendous liking and obsession towards Rhimjim that any specie even remotely with Rimjhim won’t do. Thus, she is always at receiving end of it all – The hippos threaten to eat her off, while the vixen can’t wait to tear her face in two. The hedgehog fantasizes herself entangled in her too. The teddy is the only one quite understandable towards Rimjhim.   As if this weren’t enough, the giraffe is always busy poking her nose in zoo keeping activities trying to learn some tricks herself.   Gosh so much for  animal exotica eh? I best, animal planet has better things to watch.  -----------------------------------------------------------  As expected, the direction is crass from the word go. There is no rhyme or reason or anything. A misguided doctor from another serial has ended up as a vet in this serial trying to cure the zoo keeper who is suffering from a vixen bite – I mean, cancer. There is no reason why zookeeper needs to die, and there is no reason why she will survive.  I don’t have animal planet telecast on my TV – thus I get my share of my animals by watching this serial.  As expected, the depressed teddy bear steals the show by its sheer intensity and its idiosyncrasies of its life. Its indeed a great relief to my comic bones when I see the bear sing or break into a jig.  The others merely add or decrease some amount of glitter. I only hope they don’t show the two hippos hugging each other ever – that might cover the whole TV screen – gosh!  -----------------------------------------------------------  If you were wondering why my review began with humans and quite inanely moved towards animals, well, the review has no purpose and its purposeless at this serial is. I know my review meandered endlessly into something else, but that’s just a melancholy out of watching Piya Ka Ghar. Yes Yes – its still a human serial.  Go figure out the animals.  -----------------------------------------------------------  PS: thanks suprena1 for the giraffe and the teddy bear.  © Suyog Deshpande.

      Every generation has a memory. Whilst my adolescent days were buried in innocent treasures like Small Wonder and the likes, it was probably  The Wonder Years   that simply stay put in memory, and will last an epoch. Adolescence passed, and then  into college, where there came again, another series, which again will last a lifetime. Yes, as I will always reminiscence The Wonder Years, years later, will I also cherish another memorable series –  F.R.I.E.N.D.S.    Admittedly, I don’t claim to have seen all ten seasons. Nor did I see the complete tenth season too, but then that has always been the beauty of this serial. You really didn’t need to follow it to get hooked – you could start on it anywhere, and yet fall in love with it. Nor were all seasons great too, but then there is an unmistakable aura about the series which remains. A decade later, the chemistry between Monica, Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler and Ross is as fresh as…. Err… yesterday’s Rose (Ok stupid analogy... lets try again) as fresh as fresh air.   Indeed, its difficult to choose the worst amongst them because they are so good, I will just go ahead and name the worst character I did not like most. Lets make it simple – I mean its difficult to choose the best amongst them because none of them are worst, I will just go ahead and name the best character I did not hate most. Excuse me, my English is as worse as Joey’s geography, but you may guess it right – it had to be the lazy, dull, unassuming  Joey .    Chandler:  [To Joey who's removing his tie] Would you put that back on? Monica's gonna be here any minute!   Joey:  But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.   Chandler:  [frustrated] Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.   All-right done with the favorite parts – but lets be fair, I think I liked  Rachel  too, I mean who wouldn’t ;-), though she was not necessarily the funniest character. And  Monica  too- I mean her err…mmh… cooking?. Cannot do without   Phoebe  – No No – the ultimate sneaky peaky a must have friend, and especially her poetry.  Chandler  is so funny, especially with Joey – No he is my favorite too – especially his one liners and enders. Of course I love the dinosaur too, and because I love dinosaurs, I love  Ross  too- I love his I-am-so-confused-with-this-world attitude. Ah well, what a waste of  two paragraphs trying to guess whom I liked best.  An eclectic wandering of  Phoebe -   Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat It's not your fault  They won't take you to the vet You're obviously not their favorite pet You may not be a bed of roses And you're no friend to those with noses   The point is – None of them were above the theme of the whole series – friends; precisely why I loved all the zany characters. More so, because a little of friends is in everyone.  What I loved about friends was that the show was not pretentious in nature. American TV is obsessed with catering to every segment of society, and irreversibly any damn show you pick, the makers make it a point to have a character from prominent ethnic communities to satisfy both audiences. Friends was different – they didn’t follow the normal TV standards, and there was no pretensions. The show rose above the menial suit-to-everyone characterizations to actually consist of people in a real life situation, which made it all the more appealing to everybody. Friends was a good example of a script being larger than the character’s serial – and of course, for 10 complete years, being blessed by a star cast that shared an amazing acting chemistry.    Phoebe:  [Right after playing a song in the coffee shop ] If you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.   Of course Friends was not without it fair share of flaws. As in all sitcoms, seasons 8 or 9 weren’t really spectacular. Additionally, their underlying humor towards life sometimes got a little too crass and amateurish. Their handling of fatherhood, motherhood and babies was done pretty amusing and amateurish and sometimes felt went overboard with the humor, but then compared to ten years, small facets like these don’t really matter a lot does it? All in all, barring its small share of flaws, Friends remained on a singular track with lots of sideys, specials and such happening, but basically revolving in and around the coffee shop, and more prominently Monica’s apartment.      The season finale (05/05/2004) –   The season finale drew the curtains on FRIENDS for good (hopefully). What I loved about the last episode was the spirit of the serial – no melodrama, no overdone hyperdramatics – just the way it began, it just remained. Of course an hour  long special did provide a lot of scope for emotions, but were subtly handled. The humor remained intact. The best part was the evening long specials of best scenes of FRIENDS really lighting up my day.  Should I be giving the end of the finale? Nah – I resist. Though a memorable mention to a particularly humorous part of the finale -    Doctor  [To chandler and Monica]: The other one will be out in a minute.  Monica:  Excuse me? What will be out of what?  Doctor:  The other baby! You knew they were twins right?  Chandler:  Twins? Two babies?!!. Hey, we ordered just one!   The F.R.I.E.N.D.S shall and will always remain. Now I hope to but the entire ten seasons DVD set in one go sometime. As they the Show must go on, and I hope there is something as lively and as friendly as FRIENDS soon on TV, else a generation might just have to live with the re-runs.  Happy viewing and cheers to one of the best sitcoms to hit televisions in a long time.     Joey:  I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.   Sarah:  I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.   Joey:  You don't own a TV.? What's all your furniture pointed at?   © Suyog Deshpande.  The above content was originally posted on  urlLink Mouthshut.com  under the username  urlLink suyog .

       Sleeping is no mean art:  for its sake one must stay awake all day.      -- Friedrich Nietzscheu   And I think, how so true these words are. Sleep is perhaps the most beautiful thing on earth and its rather a shame that a normal human spends 1/3rd of their lives sleeping. I wish everyone could sleep at least half their lives. Think of the advantages it would have produced –  - People could sleep more (Ah, profound observation here.)  - Population control. Yes, yes, come to think of it people sleeping more could produce lesser. Err, only it doesn’t back fire that is ;-)  - Normal workday hours would be a 6 hour a day work – bliss!  - World would be a safer place since half the times either part of the world would be busy sleeping instead of bothering about other half of world’s problems.  - Kekta would have a hard time finding spots to air her horror shows - I think this is the best reason!  But then, life is not this simple. Sleep is something simply sacred, something simply divine, simply irreplaceable, (of course lord of dungeons and grim reapers will severely debate this ;-) – they have better permanent methods they did argue, but sigh… ), simply irresistible, and plain simply enjoyable. The most profound things in this world are simple, and if you look above, there are so many simple joys of sleeping. And best part of all – falling asleep is really simple too – just close your eyes. Ah, so much simplicity in life eh? How can one not like sleeping!   A few simple reasons why one must sleep –   - You always dreamed of double date with  J.Lo  on one side and  Tina Turner  on the other side (all right, not  Tina , mayhaps  Queen Latifah ? – no eh?  Britney  then?). Anyway point is, a mere mortal may achieve all that (s)he ever wanted to achieve in life.   - The day began badly; your boss fired you again for coming late, for not working hard, for not being motivated, for not being interested enough in job; Remedy? – SLEEP. You always wanted to kick his bu*tt hard – at least take the satisfaction that you could at least kick him while sleeping!  - Sleep usually induces other activities which then help reduce stress, tension, relief, oppressed feelings, and most of all release for a few moments of this ungodly world.  - Sleep makes you appreciate life ;-) (Hail Grim Reaper here!)  Anyways, so much for the sleep inducing introduction to this sleeposgasmic review. Life is too short to stay awake, hence my friends, one must cultivate healthy sleeping habits. These habits will not help people sleep  more, but also err… will help people err... sleep more... yawnnnn.   So how must one cultivate healthy sleeping habits?   - Don’t sleep for 16 hours of your day. You will automatically feel sleepy enough. So Intelligent eh? The point is, for me a healthy sleep is night sleep – other sleeps are pleasure sleeps err... I mean, siesta sleeps.   - Eat like a bakasura – u is bound to develop very healthy sleeping habits indeed then ;-).  - Ignore the point above – I meant the opposite. If you sleep on an empty stomach, you will wake up empty ;-) (Stop. Applause. Continue). Seriously, one must not sleep on empty stomach. Not only you will feel much emptier next day, I kind of feel rather weak! I simply don’t believe in the King-Prince-Pauper food theory, and I think I always sleep well when I have had a sumptuous helping of chicken tikka masala coupled with 3 tandoori rotis topping it off with a serving of pulao and raita and of course Kheer as desert. Gluttony is an art, and if practiced well can really help you sleep well. Point is, eat healthy to have good sleeps.  - Exercise! – Kehne main kya jaatha hain. I do regular exercise  by holding  peanuts in my hands, and trying out different ways I can toss them up and land them in my mouth. Anyways, I have **heard** that by exercising you can sleep well. I am always too sleepy to exercise anyways, so I don’t know the efficiency of the results. Reminds me, I need to exercise my mouth before the next sentence. There are also other exercises, though I am very reluctant to suggest them in public spaces, though are a sure fire way of falling to sleep – no, it doesn’t fail ;-).   In addition sleeping healthy has health reasons –   - You grow hairy like a bear. Sleeping is believed to reduce hair loss, temporary hair loss, alleviate baldness (sorry wrong word), lessen baldness, and give kali-reshmi-zulfi to those who desire. It doesn’t mean that all ladies should sleep more ;-).  - Then,  I guess I have also heard that if you don’t sleep well, your neural system may start malfunctioning. Next time that dog runs behind you when you jog at 5 in the morning, you know what went wrong with the dog. Allow your dogs to sleep well, please. Sorry, lost my way. On second thoughts, how many agree that dogs actually act to kill our sleep?  - Sleeping is fun.   Well, I think I have nearly come to the end of this review. I have been feeling sleepy ever since I started this review. Its nearly 3 weeks I have started this review, and yawn; this has been one boring review!   Oh, by the way, research hasn’t still found a reason why we sleep. Lets sleep to this!   © Suyog Deshpande.

      Indian authors have never enjoyed world fame – Not many have been lucky in getting their work across the globe and show to people what fine writers India possesses. While most good authors have been vernacular authors in India, their works are rarely translated in put forward on the globe – While  Bhyrappa  was not as lucky as Marquez to get his work  One Hundred Years Of Solitude  to world and eventually win a nobel prize for that, Bhrappa’s most works evoke similar respect – For example, there is no better deserving book than  Parva  to literally sweep any kind of awards that exist in literary world, however, the lack of outreach has prevented this. For a long time I was in complete awe of  Parva  and though  One Hundred years of Solitude  did bring me out of that hang over, it required another of the same author’s work  VamshaVriksha , translated  The Uprooted  (not quite literal translation, but very appropriate to the content), to bring me out of the magic of  Parva . Incredibly simple and incredibly complex at the same time, this is a book that leaves its readers so drained, so full, so many answers, and so many questions, that in the end, a reader is bound by the duality of nature of the book.    ''Who are you? What are you? Where are you going? Ask these questions to yourself and watch these answers change...''       --  Richard Bach, Illusions   While Richard Bach merely chose to pose the questions and leave it to the reader,  Bhyrappa  asks the very same questions and more in the book. Its not the questions that enthrall the reader, it’s the justification to the answers that enthrall you.  What is your purpose in life? Can faith be guided by greed? Do you love a person so much that you did give up your own child to be with him? Do you love your work so much that you did give up on your wife and family to pursue your goals? Are you strong enough to shed any kind of hatred towards another person? How much do you know about your child, and more importantly, yourself? Does your past make a difference to who you are? Does your past influence your future? Is devotion love? Is love devotion? Whose sorrow is great – a mother who lost her child or a child who lost her mother? Do you think you are firmly rooted in this circle of life?    Probably that is half the thinking a reader will do in reading this book. This is a book about 2 families, and yet the complexities of each character touch upon almost everything in life. This is a story about a mother who lost her son to floods and feels the sorrow of it. It’s a story about a woman who lost her husband and her sorrow at becoming a widow so early in life. It’s a story of progressive thinking of the widow wishing to be happier in life. It’s a story of commitment to one’s dharma and karma by a person. Its also a story of man who is so passionate about his work that he forgets his wife in it. It’s a story about a man who marries another lady out of pure love and greed of common goal. It’s a story of woman’s undivided love for her husband and her loneliness. It’s a story about a child loving impotent man, and his introspection of the various aspects of life that he has changed his opinion on. But ultimately it’s a story of a woman, a widow who mourns her husband, loves another man so much she wants to marry him. Yet she is also in the duality of her love to a man and duty of a widow, her unquestioning quest for the path that leads to mental peace.   Bhyrappa  weaves his story around such principles and is able to bring about a justification which you cannot just help nodding with – Every character justifies his or her actions throughout their life, to the point, that their duality becomes an issue you think off, and not the characters. You cannot help sympathizing the wife who longs for her husband, but you cannot help agreeing to the justification of the husband in leaving his wife. Such is the beauty of book – along with every character and their metamorphosis, you think the same way they do - to the point you ask the same questions to yourself. It’s a book that just doesn’t go by characters, but it’s a study of human nature and its desires, the norms of the society, the regulations of an Arya  life. At the very core lies in a story about 2 families, orthodox Hindu Brahmin families, trying to make sense of their duties as Brahmin, and at the same time find themselves uprooted of the very foundation of their life. Or like the author best describes in a passage – like a branch which fell from the tree as if the tree had no longer the use of that branch.  Prakirthi and Purusha, (Nature and Man) give this book an absolute meta physical look to the book – while every event in the book derives an relation between nature and man in form of woman and man, it also derives beautifully the meaning of being uprooted on the nature (woman) and Purusha (man). To really grasp the meaning of this metaphysical line, its best left to the reader to understand it.  Fortunately, the translation is again by my related grand-father  Dr. K. Raghavendra Rao , and he doesn’t fail to deliver. This is a joint effort by him and his wife (who by the way is a very nice lady, and I shall always miss her tea that she used to prepare when I got home from college), and the effort shows. A translated version never really tells you the magic of author’s real wordings, but a great translation will captivate you in any language by the way it has been translated – same is with this book – the translation itself captivates you so much that you did desire to read the original too.   In the end, you must have made out how much I have loved reading this book. If  Parva  is possibly the best book I have read in my life, then  The Uprooted  comes a close second. Not a book to be missed at any cost in life.

       ''I glance at the headlines just to kind of get a flavor for what's moving. I rarely read the stories, and get briefed by people who are probably read the news themselves.''       --George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Sept. 21, 2003  Reading a techie novel is something which doesn’t really inspire me (after all why would I read something which I do for a living?!). However not counting that, with 3 more techie novels which I have to finish (since I have bought them), and also with a hope that some combination of keys which I am typing doesn’t cause the notorious Office XP to hang and crash, I proceed therefore to review, which is actually, well, about a BUG. Now, for hopeful environmentalists here or some bug expert, first and foremost, this is a book about a BUG as in the world of computers; sorry to disappoint you, but this BUG lives in the machine world, and unlike objects of curiosity of its lively counterparts, the BUGS in machine world excel at making you gape with horror, shock, amazement, irritation, anger, loath, hatred, and have you tear your hair apart for its sheer capacity to tease you when you expect it the least.    What’s worse than finding a bug in a program? Catch the next computer programmer beside you and ask.    Ellen Ullman  herself has been a programmer for around 20 years, and now a days writes for various magazines and has a fan following. So when she decided to write a fiction novel set in the techie world, eyebrows were raised as to how would she come up with something that was easily accessible to readers in all domains, and still avoid the smirk of the geeks. While she succeeds at both, her intrinsic sense of programmer gets the better of her at many places, there by making geeks happier than others. However that should not deter people from other fields to try out the books, however the audience acceptance will definitely be amongst computer literate, and of course anyone familiar with C and the ubiquitous monster UNIX (which perhaps is the best thing the machines could have ever asked for).    THE BUG   A BUG can be anything in your program – a simple pointer going haywire, your memory allocation going berserk, or even a simple loop which instead of terminating after 10 iterations, decides it doesn’t want to. Of course bugs are caught sooner or later, with ‘later’ being an infinite concept of time; Its the harrowing time between finding the cause of the bug that makes life miserable. Like any other BUG, once found, it usually is a ridiculous piece of code which just happened to be there.   While it’s a simple one line story, I am sure the geeks here appreciate the horror of the predicament.    There is a bug in the system which causes the application to crash at random times due to random input responses.   The book well, is about finding that elusive bug and correcting it. Simpler said than done eh?   REPRODUCTION   One of the toughest things you can encounter with random BUGS is the reproduction. If you cannot reproduce an error, or more appropriately, the BUG itself, then you don’t know where to start. If you cannot see the ‘effect’ of the BUG again and again, chances are you will never the ‘cause’ too   The BUG deeply explores an era set in time when Graphical User Interfaces were becoming famous – a story set back in the programming world of mid 1980s when the root ruled (pun intended). The backdrop of the company, programming an interface for their latest database is going through all the typical chaos of a company trying to get a product to market. A typical scene of a techie company is superbly narrated -  a bunch of programmers coding a application, sending over their modules to testers, who then will return with BUGS, and programmers correcting the BUG until an acceptable level of tolerance is reached and the software is released in the market,  with  BUGS un-discovered or intentionally, for some newer person to find it and report it back. (In a lighter vein, I wonder if Windows XP development team ever had a testing team!)  Reverting back to book again, a BUG which surfaces out of nowhere, creates havoc amongst the life of the tester and a programmer respectively. A superb narration of a (rather cliché American) life of the programmer makes for compulsive reading - the trials, the hopelessness, the frustrations of not finding out the BUG and correcting and it and overall mental tiredness of trying to catch something beyond your control, all the emotions are superbly captured by a one time programmer herself, giving it more scope and understandability  – I guess it take a programmer to feel a programmer.   CAUSE   Sometimes BUGS may require as simple a step as declaring your variables from one data type to another. At times a simple change which took care of one BUG, doesn’t necessarily mean you wont face another BUG caused by the effect of the change. In real world systems, there is no such thing as a perfect software system – even mission critical software have bugs, and as the author brilliantly points towards the end – its there, waiting, lurking behind the doors, may be weeks, may be years, to strike at that opportune moment when it shouldn’t and create havoc. If you are lucky you will never see it.    The explanation right from the first page is pretty technical with oodles of UNIX and C programming thrown in – that an attempt is also made to make the novice reader understand the happenings is an appreciable effort by the author. While taking a parallel to the BUG, the author also vividly paints out images of techie world to the readers – the constant head-banging deadlines, the eagerness to release half finished products, the layoffs, venture capitalists, role changes, almost every aspect of a techie company is brought about as an undertone in the book, making it immensely enjoyable. She also perfectly captures the feelings of a human when dealing with a BUG and the art of debugging the BUG. Probably as a mistake or may be an intentional trick, the author leaves a BUG in the BUG for the readers to grasp. I admit I had to see again to find that BUG!    TEST   Once a bug has been dealt with, you cannot clasp your hands with wonder. For you never know what you may face next. Sometimes you can predict  what will occur, a newer bug may awake, where that bug will occur and so on, however its what you cannot predict you should be scared of. A software without bugs is a BUG itself, and probably useless – that’s a fundamental nature of software, in a lighter vein that is!   In short, let me just state that the book has been a very enjoyable read for me, and even if you are not a geek, you should read this for pure thrilling narrative. On the only flip side of the novel is the language which goes from first person to third, from past to present and future in an eccentric manner. But that is probably just about it. On the whole, the BUG is a very a good read, and if you are from the geek world, then this is one book you must read!   Ps: I have and clearly avoided mentioning any part of the philosophical jingo in the book – its eminently enjoyable and very true to today’s world which is ruled by computers and not humans.

      I had solemnly decided after the horrific experience of last time that I would never ever fly the Maharajah again. However fate it seems had crueler joke to play; and I had to visit the Maharajah, Air India yet again. So when two weeks ago I had fly our national carrier back to India, I made sure that   1. I had a copy of Hanuman Chalisa with me (Just in case you know…)  2. A couple of good books which would distract me from Air-India’s in flight and out flight entertainment (read scare).    However my situation was not helped very much when I discovered that I had to sit besides a Gujju Old Couple whose first remark to me was – “Gujarathi cho ne?” (I assume you are a Gujarati only!) After settling down with kem cho  and other pleasantries, I quickly decided to bury my head into the book I had to chosen to read in-flight, lest Air India or my pleasant companions decided to bug me.  The book I had chosen to read was  “Stupid White Men” , written by  Michael “On the Oscars stage who bushwacked bush” Moore .   STUPID WHITE MEN  In a nutshell, Stupid White men is about –  1. Stupid White Men (Glory to my brains!)  2. White men who are Stupid (Applause please, thank you!)  3. Stupid men who happen to be White (I am too much!)   In a screwshell, the book is a big eye opener on Corporate America and how some Stupid Corporate Americans are making ordinary citizens look, well – Stupid.  Stupid White Men though begins with a Stupid man from Texas who got elected to be the President, it traces back and forth between different scams and hams of the American Life. Moore takes a dig at everything that has made the country America. Though being the most developed nation in the world, the country Americans still don’t belong anywhere, half the world hates them, live a life driven my media, have no sense of culture in their lives, and still support a stupid man who has brought more misery to the world than Hitler himself some eons back. In a way, I fully endorse what Mr. Moore has to say about the sorry state of affairs burgeoning in the country.  Stupid White Men doesn’t take the normal road in telling you about the vagaries and scams of America – Instead of writing a book, Moore simply talks to you. He talks for a good 300 pages, and yet you never ever tire of him. His premise is simple – Most of world’s chaos within and outside America has been caused by Whites, and by that he means Corporate Whites. Moore knows he gets a lot of flak for what he says, yet he goes about publishing books which he says what he means.  In a clean sweep, Moore addresses the following issues with superb spice and humor backed with some excellent research work –  1. How Bush got himself elected in 2000 – The details and intricacies of how the election was flawed and how Bush got through the elections  2. General American myopia in knowing about the world and their world knowledge as good as zero  3. How should men of America behave and live. He also suggests that Men should give up their places to women and let them do the ruling!  4. Corporate Scandals like Enron and how Americans were duped into the stock market; the stock market cost millions of Americans their livelihoods  5. How Economy not doing well is a quite a lie when all the big companies in the last five years and their corporate heads only raked in more money in millions  6. That the education spending in America is gone to dogs – why in some schools there aren’t no drinking water too?  The above is just a breather as to what Moore addresses in this book!! And he does it in great style, with dollops of bush-whacking and cheney-slapping.   *******************************************************************   Sorry for digressing, I just thought I did put this here to make my review longer! America is nation starving for media – it cannot live with media dishing out daily dosage of how one should lead their lives here. One of the funniest things this country always brings about is the amount of surveys they do; for example –  - In a recent survey they found that 12 % of pet owners called their pets home from work!  - Around 24% of homosexuals smoke! Wait there is more – out of the 24% more than 60% who smoke and are gays have equal chances of getting an STD!  - People who are distracted while driving have more chances of meeting an accident! (This one takes the cake!)  - There was one in TOI today morning, though not American in nature – People who fail in love are equally to lose in gambling!  *******************************************************************  It would be unfair for me to say what kind of political aspirations this man has, but nonetheless the book provided a good dose of humor. I was more concerned with the hidden information and the humor and less about the political inclinations. I least cared what Moore thought for others, but yes, when he whacks bush, then its immediately my interest too! More on his political inclinations follow in my next review.  Moore’s style is simple, and to the point. He doesn’t use flowery language, nor does he fail to call a spade a spade! He simply presents the facts and then asks his readers to do the thinking. He writes letters to Bush, Arafat, God, Sharon and other leaders and while using humor suggests practical suggestions to end the world’s troubles. That is the greatest success of the book – practical and humorous!   In epilogue Moore mentions that success withstanding, this would be the last book he did write. The book went on to become the highest selling non-fiction book of year 2002, showing there are more sensible people in America than he thinks! He keeps his promise – he wrote another humorously witty book, this time completely devoted to dubious dubyaman –  “Dude, where’s my country”!   And that’s what I am going to review next!  Till then, grab this one immediately! And by the way, the old couple weren’t finished yet…

       ''This very week in 1989, there were protests in East Berlin and in Leipzig. By the end of that year, every communist dictatorship in Central America had collapsed.''        —George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Nov. 6, 2003   As I promised in my last review, the old gujju couple were not done yet. Mid flight, just when the plane started galloping up and down due to turbulent weather, old  man decided it was time to take a leak. He took a leap though. The movement of plane was enough to send the man running 3 feet away and trip over a nonplussed lady who taught aisle space meant additional leg room. After lifting him up and getting him back to the seat, I discovered to my horror that I had finished Stupid White Men rather too quickly, with another 10 hours of flying left.  When the operator announced “We will be shortly arriving in Paris” my old man quipped “Mumbai avee gayoo atle jaldi?” (“Mumbai came so soon?”). After some more pleasantries and explanation that we were still continent apart, I buried myself again into the second book I had got for in flight concentration. This was “Dude, where’s my Country” by none other than  Michael Moore  (The more I read Moore, I love him!).  --------------------------   Dude Where’s my Country?   In this second book on bush-whacking, he  completely and solemnly concentrates on the dubious man, Bush. This time Moore centers his research around Bush and his bunch of cronies and how they led a nation into believing that they first scared a nation to go to war, and then tried convincing people that they were actually liberating a nation’s people.  [Come to think of, the weapons of mass destruction still haven’t shown up; I wish my grand children hear of them sometime]   There are some truly hilarious chapters in this book. In  7 Questions for George of Arabia , Moore exposes how the bush family has had a tradition of oil well deals with well you guessed it the kith and kin of Bin Laden. Moore asks the very question sensible ask and (most Americans have simply forgotten) – Where is the much acclaimed Bin Laden? A nation which thrives on latest gadgets and space technology fails miserably to catch the one man responsible for 9/11.  Moore also presents exciting recipes where the main ingredients happen to be    1. A bowl of Rice 2. A dick-full of Chaneys.  3. A foul smelling duck called Donald 4. Some  dried and dangerous weeds from Texas  passing of as Bush.   Each of whopper meals come with ample salad dressings which can be changed and modify to suit audience tastes at different times. They include   1. I-Nuke: Iraq has Nuclear Weapons dressing 2. I-Bio: Iraq has Biological Weapons dressing 3. I-Lib: We are Liberating Iraq dressing 4. Al-Qaeda and Saddam are tied  dressing 5. Oil wells must be protected dressing    Note  – the above ones are my creation –  Moore  knows how to mix them in the right proportion and serve it to you in form. For more please read chapter 2 of this fantastic book.  Moore also addresses this nation obsessed with  ‘Terrorist Threats’  and  ‘God Bless America’  Syndrome. In a hilarious letter from God, Moore explains how even God must be tired of Bush acting his messenger every time he croons on TV –  “God Bless America!”  Moore is as fascinated by various colors and codes for threat levels as much as I am too. He suggests practical ideas as to what do with them. He tries to bring vanity into Americans into believing that their chances of getting killed in a terrorist attack are far far lower than they meeting an accident on road!   Moore also takes a dig at the Patriotic ACT 29 which was accepted in wake of paranoia in the country there by finishing any kind of privacy anyone may enjoy in the country. In the name of security, Yokun Ho! You may not speak up!  By the way the much acclaimed tax cut by the Bush actually cuts taxes only for the billionaires and not the common man. The trillion dollar tax cut meant millions of cuts for the super rich while for the common working man turned into a mere 30$ a year. So much for the cuts – Moore exposes the false ideologies behind many of Bush’s moves and that what makes it even more interesting!   [Oops a digression! In the middle of the flight, our captain announced that we were flying over Arabian ocean and should be in Mumbai in another 3 hours. The Old man who probably heard the Mumbai part of it asked me “Are we on runway?”; I shook in disbelief and asked him to take peek outside the window seat he was occupying and confirm it for himself”]   Coming back to the Bushy Adventure, Moore probably gives the best thoughts on terrorism in the middle of the book, which goes by  “HOW TO STOP TERRORISM: Stop Being Terrorists!” .   And yes, he also leaves the common Americans some spring time cleaning work to do; He sets a plan for the cleaning work and how to go about removing Bushes and other types of  dangerous plantations and thereby save his homeland.  ------------------------  I won’t digress into his writing style again – he is not a literary achiever; he simply talks to you and you simply listen and have a good laugh. That his research is pretty extensive shows from the notes and research work he mentions in the book itself. Without creating any controversy, let me state that I tend to agree with Moore’s opinion, though I will not rule out the possibilities of propaganda campaign by Moore himself. However I and Bushwhacking get along very well hehe!  --------------------------  In the end, is this book a worth successor to the  Stupid White Men ? It is! If you are planning to read that one, may I suggest you read both of these books in one go? They are supremely hilarious! I also refrain still from making any comments on his political inclination as I am still not in a position to do that.  ---------------------------   However as much as I tried to stir myself away from the oldies, I couldn’t ignore them. They were nice people at heart; When I was alighting at Mumbai airport, the old man and his wife thanked me for helping him out when he fell and also being patient with numerous visits to the bathrooms, the medicines, the luggage movement, the theplas, the form fillings. It was the “Thank You” that really touched me and probably why I will never forget them too.    -----------  ''[A]s you know, these are open forums, you're able to come and listen to what I have to say.''         —George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Oct. 28, 2003

      On trip back to the United States, by some misfortune or luck, I managed to buy just one book. That I had to still endure the Maharajah with probably another couple gave me the shudders since this was not very inspiring thought. Add to that the book I did got,  “The Alchemist”  was just around 100-150 pages long, thereby suggesting it would get over even before we crossed the Arabian sees! However things happen for good and luckily the seat next to me sat a good looking girl, about my age and just because you asked it, well, she was a Gujju! So while I was not chatting with her about India and she not telling me about her life, I read the book. In deed, the book lasted the whole flight and it was only near the end I finished the book. Also I need to make a trip to New Jersey soon, if you know what I mean :-)  Now coming back to the haranguing on the book I am going to review today, first and foremost let me tell you that I prefer books over talking to people in flights. Now if this had been a such a stupendous book as it claimed to be on covers, I did have been pretty unlucky not to know her :-). Fortunately or unfortunately, the book is nothing but an average rendition of one man’s quest for himself.    THE ALCHEMIST  Likes of such books have been written a many.  Richard  Bach’s  brilliant book   ‘Jonathan Livingston Seagull’   or the average   ‘Illusions’  come to my mind immediately which debated on similar topics albeit different ways. The problem with  The Alchemist  it tries vainly in the later half of the book to be come something grandiose and just falls flat on itself. So what is it about?   The Alchemist  is about a dreamer who decides to follow his dream. The dreamer is a shepherd who is told that he would find a treasure in the pyramids of Egypt. With a wishing from the old man, begins his journey to the pyramids. In between he meets a budding alchemist who in turn wants to meet the one (The real Alchemist) in the oasis. At last when he comes in face with The Alchemist, the alchemist then sets out to explain him about the soul of the world and the soul within. Eventually the dreamer actually reaches the pyramids to only discover that the treasure he looked for all his life lied with him back home.   MORAL  The book begins brilliantly with some really thoughtful lines hidden in the story. When author says  we are always sure of how others should lead their lives, but never quite ours ,  you simply nod and wonder such exquisite lines. However to the book’s loss, they are far less and few, a fact that made both of Richard Bach’s works very famous. Things go downhill when the Soul of the World and such philosophies are introduced with some bizarre things happening within the book. The dreamer’s ultimate realization of the soul of the world, that is the soul of God was his own soul, doesn’t even sound satisfactory. His path to realization that God was probably his perfect self does not come across strongly enough for us to justify with the dreamer’s dream.      FATE & DESTINY  In the beginning of the book, till the later half of book, the author presents a thoughtful discussion on Destiny and Fate. We are all destined to do the work we were supposed to in our life the authors argued, however not many do it because they are simply bound by their insecurities of their fate. This probably came across as the strongest point of the whole philosophical thread of the book.   In my personal opinion, an individual controls his fate. And yet there is always a thing called destiny. Everyone is destined to do their work, and if we are destined to something, our fate too is destined with it. Conversely, my fate binds me to my destiny. It is in my fate to follow the destiny carved for me.  So – do I believe in destiny? Yes! Do I believe in Fate – Yes! The book provides a good debate on this issue, and probably the only reason I ended up giving 3 stars to the book   PROSE  The prose of the book is very simple, straight and to the point. It does not try to be a literary classic in its own right, but manages to be simple. However, its far too simple – to the point that it bores you. Such a book requires the author to hold his reader’s interest throughout, however this is where it fails. One is never really interested so much in this book at any time.   FINALLY  Did I like this book? I thought this book was a pretty average book, and if I really had to recommend a book on similar lines, then I did seriously recommend Richard Bach’s  ‘Jonathan Livingston Seagull’  which is a far more superior piece of work; and yes, shorter too :-)  Richard Bach’s rendition of the Seagull looking to break beyond the boundaries to reach his dream to the point where his prodigy learns that to know thyself was to know the one, provides more thoughtful exposition than a dreamer lost in desert.    PI  In the book  ‘Life Of Pi’  towards the end when the kid explains his adventures with the tiger, the police men refuse to believe him and laugh him off. When he reiterates the same story with animals, it becomes more convincing to the policemen. I probably felt the same after finishing Seagull and the Dreamer.   Do animals teach us more about life than we can to ourselves?

       Three days ago I woke up in the middle of the night in the Lesch-Nyhan position – my one leg and its opposite hand folded, almost like a criss-cross position. A cold sweat ran over me,  and I immediately switched on the bed lights; First I checked myself whether I had bit off my fingers (I am known to bite my nails),  and then checked if my lips were still all right and  not tethered. Five minutes later I realized that I was probably seeing a nightmare; – no, I didn’t see a dream, I just enacted a nightmare and it was downright took me out of myself.   Such was the effect of this book –  The Cobra Event  by  Richard Preston  on me after reading this brilliant novel on bio terror. Even Prey with all its technical geek didn’t give me the shivers as this book did; its not a horror novel, but simply a possibility of a horror affecting our lives. A horror more powerful than a nuclear bomb;  a horror which really threatens humanity as a whole. And to think it all begins with one little DNA strand; a strand of A, T, C, and G all in different formations, different structures, from different diseases. All it takes is a strand of 100,000 or more or less A, T, C and Gs to make up a DNA of the virus strand which only electron microscopes have had the ability to see. And to imagine, humanity may simply be challenged by it.  Witness a shockingly descriptive narration of a school girl dying in the prologue. It takes ten pages to imagine the symptoms - and when you do it, a picture emerges in your mind of horrifying impact a single genetically modified molecule can have on a human body. The chilling start only begins to expose a thrilling novel, on the possibilities and the reality of bio terrorism in our lives  The Cobra Event is story of a mysterious virus in New York which begins to take people’s lives in a matter of few hours. The unexplained deaths became a basis for exploration for a group of people who must delve into the deeper aspects of biology to uncover exactly what was the virus made up. You as a reader join them on their pursuit of not only finding out exactly what the virus is all about, but also about finding ‘who’ exactly leaked it out. You travel through forensic sciences, the symptoms decision,  and the pursuit of that elusive strand of the virus. You are thrilled some exciting moments and some tense moments good enough to keep your midnight oil burning. One notices how damn realistically it all could be possible – and we are never as safe as we had always imagined ourselves to be.    The next day after I got up, the day went smoothly at the office.  As I climbed the shuttle I was going to take back home, I noticed there was a pungent smell in the bus and I couldn’t figure it. The bus was packed, and I had to sit at the far end where the smell was the strongest – it was kind of medical smell, as if someone was putting on a Vicks on their face. And yet, I thought what if some one had caught a ‘different’ kind of cold? The cold is contagious, has 100 different strands of its own and one of those which does not have a vaccine. What if someone had sprayed something in the bus – nearly three people seemed to be running a nose. How was I sure that some idiotic insane decided to run a bio test on live humans right in this bus? Could it be possible? Well, very truly yes – after all how many would actually notice in 5 billion people on earth about such a measly group of people in a bus. I told myself, I was again enacting a nightmare and all is still definitely well with world.    The Cobra Event itself is a work of fiction, however the background isn’t. The background research is not a self thought of situations, but rather an extension of what has already been achieved in bio terror research and what is being pursued currently. The story is fictional, and yet the historical rupture is not. The historical notes on different important events of bio terror weapons being tested in the world secretly makes for a quite a shocking read, which not only thrills you, but leaves you cold. The authenticity of the research only makes it a more compelling read.   Allow yourself to ask questions – ‘Is AIDS an experiment gone horribly wrong?’  - ‘Why is Anthrax so powerful?’ – ‘Is man creating the ultimate weapon against himself?’ – ‘Do animals spread virus to human bodies?’   In an era where thrillers have ceased to become movie scripts, this book comes a welcome change. Here is a thriller written as a book and not as a trashy script – thereby increasing the thrill element. The author uses a lot jumbo vocabulary in biology enough to split your head. Unless with a preliminary knowledge of biology, it would not be very easy to follow the book – however anybody with a secondary degree though should understand the concept of the book.  All in all, this one is a must read books on the real terror behind biological weapons and how in itself man seems to be creating the ultimate weapon against himself.   For the past weeks I have been hearing about the spread of Bird-Flu amongst people in Thailand. Inherently a chicken disease, there are cases of people being affected and dying rather too quickly. The virus spread across a few more countries by this week; the WHO is worried about the virus and its possible mutation with a common cold. The results could be ghastly – what started as a dangerous disease in chickens might just turn out be a nasty mutated virus affecting humans rather too quickly and become a highly infectious disease. A fully functional vaccine against the virus is still nearly six months away; hopefully that’s not too late.   Now comes the point – is this yet another experiment gone horribly wrong? Or am I just enacting another nightmare?

      Meet  Michael K , a 30 year something with a harelip, with shortened intelligence and goes about his daily life as a gardener. He doesn’t expect much from life or society and doesn’t understand very basic things in life. Yet his heart desires freedom and the freedom of having a lived a free life; free not from the war, but from his soul.   Witness  South Africa  raging in a civil war. Not many places to actually live. Loot, arson and war camps are the order of the day. You are captured and put into war camps because you want to live. You want to see the end of war; not by putting an end to it, but by staying away from it.   Experience the pathos of the doctor trying to understand his patient. He yearns to know the story behind  Michael’s  resistance. In understanding  Michael , he understands himself – that in a vestibule of life, Michael K, the nameless soul is freer than himself. Sympathize the plight of an individual who has chosen to live a life of service to humanity and yet without freedom.  *******************************************************************   J. M. Coetzee  novel in 180 pages speaks more like a volume and an epic saga of one man’s quest of freedom. That a mere 180 pages is all it took for Coetzee to pen something so brilliant is an indication of how good this author really is. Twice booker winner (one for this one and other for  Disgrace ), one quite understands that he deserved them more than anyone else.   Coetzee  spans across an epic of a country torn by war and the indulgence of one man’s quest for a free life.  Michael K  doesn’t understand much of this world – rather he is one of the stupidest persons to come upon on earth; yet in  Michael  we see that a simple idea of life is worth living a life for.    Michael  teaches us that by removing ourselves from the complexities of life and looking at the bare simplistic demands of life, what one yearns for is freedom. The freedom to be free from the soul; that a free life in a bonded society is probably not worth it; that a man bonded in his soul is not quite free. And that if one tried to look beyond the wall - it was not very hard living that life.   Bombs may have cracked and fell that water pump, but Michael derives pleasure in finding water at the end of the bore in the ground. In his pleasure of finding enough water in a spoon he displays his thoughts of deriving a better life even in the times of hatred. That looking further, it was the water contained in spoon that mattered, not the war ravaged surroundings to make man happy.   *******************************************************************   Coetzee  writes with supreme élan – The language flows beautifully in the book; there are no overtly complicated prose nor is there over done third person. Note the change in stance and perspective in different parts of books – at one time a third person narrates  Michael K , at others a doctor’s perspective takes the story forward, and then yet again  Michael  himself takes himself ahead – all blended in an intricate manner.  As with most  Coetzee   books, this one too broaches upon darker aspects of life. A pretty disturbing book like Disgrace on the outset, but leaves the reader to delve upon the deeper meanings of the book. And like  Disgrace , the moral of the story is clear at the end.   In a teasing style, Michael K himself discovers the moral of his story. I refrain, please  read this magnificent book. Simply not to be missed.   ”Its difficult being kind to a person who wants nothing in life…” 		-- Excerpt from the book

      Reading this book is like viewing one of the overtly oppressed and done a million times rehash of village thakurs, dowries and common man’s struggle against corruption, tragedies at every step of life in the movies of the late 70s and early 80s.  Flimsy characters, almost out of those very movies, arise of this book and lead their lives in terrible tragedy, as if in effect themselves paying tribute to the script writers of those movies by mouthing inanely cliché done dialogues like  “Will you not hug your father?”  or  “After all I did for you, you do this”  and such. The characters almost behave like the oppressed villager awaiting his messiah to free them, the bastiwalah fighting for their life or the low class oppression against gangsters, landowners and every single terrible efficacy there is to life. Almost panoramic in its view, the book in effect is a standing tribute to the cinematic scope of myriad stories of the bygone era.   However that would be looking at one view of the book. It is in those very characters that a tale breathes of tragedy, friendship, self discovery, and over all a sense of that obsessive looming failure about to strike that next road to them. In the characters you discover not only the pathos of the characters trying to strike that fine balance between finding solitude in chaos, friendship in lies, family in disoriented characters, or perhaps just striking to find the balance between their lives and their past. As however cliché many pages over and over again may sound to you, as yet how many ever times you seem to almost predict whatever is going to happen, and perhaps as many times you may have almost gathered the next few lines of the book, yet, the book keeps coming back to haunt you, keep you engrossed, keep you traversing the characters lives, and perhaps in the same vein, try to bring about the fine balance within yourself, wondering whether you loved this book or loved to hate  the book for progressing nothing but the banalities of life.   But perhaps, that is the strength and the weakness of this magnificent book – a book that tries to draw a fine balance between story telling and flimsy characters, between characters in almost always tragic scenarios with the little gushes of happiness, or between the lurid details of emergency to the memories which refuse to give up long after they are gone. In essence, what remains then of this book once it ends are nothing but memories of a bygone era and the pathos of the characters. Its not the characters themselves who stay put in mind, but it is their underlying struggle to find their balance which keeps you haunting, and to a very shocking disturbing climax, which quite literally had me moist.   *******************************************************************  Perhaps, reviewing the story of this book itself is a meaningless exercise, for in reality there isn’t anything story worthy. Its not about a story trying to reach a goal, nor is it about docu-journey of life in the big city. Its just about a year, a certain year which changes the lives of four characters in the book – bound together by dependence on each other, beginning with a doubts of trust to never ending love and bound by memories hard to relinquish. A six hundred page saga set in a single year, manages quite brilliantly to cover three backgrounds from three eras to a culminating pothole of life. Diverse in backgrounds, all and I mean all backgrounds neatly end up supporting the anguish of character’s life – that the author wastes quite literally half a book is proof evident that the author never intended this story to be happy.  *******************************************************************  Saying that  Rohinton Mistry , critically acclaimed author who manages a booker shortlist every time he pens, demonstrates amicably why he doesn’t make it. When compared to the likes of  J.M. Coetzee , Mistry becomes simply a pale shadow of Dickens era. While his prose is superior and keeps you always engrossed, his prose never quite delves till the near end – in effect, he nearly doesn’t affect his readers, until the final two chapters, when the saga takes a different turn – quite particularly, Misty positions himself for a brilliantly written yet disturbing final chapters. However I couldn’t say that for most part of the book. Nonetheless, he is definitely a superlative author whom I am looking forward to reading more.   *******************************************************************  Despite the flimsy characters, I was most pretty much impressed by  Maneck’s  character, a character trying to find his balance in life by weighing his past – at many parts in the book I could absolutely relate and feel myself in  Maneck’s  steps; particularly and not shockingly to my readers, but I almost had the same pattern of thought towards the end. His struggles in his mind at many places reflected a personal struggle within me too. His was the most prominent character I liked and probably more because of the proximity within me.   Saying that the characters do remain flimsy - and explaining the difficulties between how they are flimsy in themselves and then telling about how personally moving they are is like a contradiction itself. Forgive me; I cannot draw that fine balance between when the characters begin to look flimsy and when they start moving you to tears.   *******************************************************************  However yet despite all this, one question which reiterates my mind writing this review. Why are such books written? At one point, it was almost as if Mistry had a preconceived notion of presenting the gory details of every heinous society ill in Indian life – to the point that at different websites, a few readers are proud to be American / Britons after reading this book and appreciate their life? Why do international Indian authors delve upon subjects of utopian era? Why can’t we have more people writing about better part of our lives? Is it so difficult for these authors to present – or tragedy in itself is an easier topic to write on and our background only makes it easier? Where are the R.K.Narayan’s of today who knew the art of looking back at life in a much more hope than these authors? Maybe then I too finding that fine balance of finding that right author.    Overall  Excellent book – worth a read once; I am sure you won’t pick it up again.

      How many times in your life do you come across a book, after reading you simply frown and wonder  “Gosh! How did I waste my week behind this one?”  or  “What was the point of this story?”  or  “Why the hell I didn’t stop after 100 pages?”   Rohinston Mistry’s  first work  Such A Long Journey  evokes similar emotions, and lets you feel terribly disappointed and wonder how author of a excellent book such as  A Fine Balaance  could come up such a amateurish, contrived and boring story; that too in his debut!. In essence,  Such A Long Journey  is left nothing but as  Such A Boring Story.    Such a boring story  And hence as this is a review, I must bore you too with the boring details of this book. Meet a boring family which will make your ancestors come alive and kicking out of their graves; the protagonist has a boring personality; neither does he represent the common man, nor does he represent his religion. Meet  Gustad,  the headman of a Parsi family working for a boring bank filled with mundane characters and boring idiosyncrasies of life. Meet his wife  Dilnavaz  who seems to have been created out of primitive era – a lifeless soul just there in the story to expose superstitious beliefs amongst women rather a character in the story. Meet their children a daughter who remains perennially ill, a son who is a misnomer in the story, and the eldest son whom remains pretentiously the most boring character of the book.  As if these many tired characters weren’t enough,  Mistry  allows himself to build a chawl with cliché characters, dogs, rats, cats and the rest. Then he mixes his ingredients with a culmination of rather strange incidents in books for no rhyme or reasons, people emoting for no reasons, people dying without purpose, and most importantly people on soul searching without much purpose. One never gets into the thick of things; one never feels for Gustad or his trials; at one point I was wishing  Gustad  kill himself to save the bore for us, however I was not the author.   Tragedy is the author’s forte, this much I have gathered, but forcing a tragedy is like making  Devdas  drink alcohol in spite of being married to  Paro . The requiems of protagonists’ life fail to make any contact with your heart after the last contour in the story. The suspense track which has been tried hard to be kept, is seemingly crooked and devoid of any thought process or execution. Tragedy must strike characters out of nowhere, this much the author assumed, and as if to prove it out then goes on a killing spree, making extras catch an  emotionallydrainingmemoriesfillewithcolossallosspathos  effect on the protagonist.  Oh did you wonder why I haven’t told you the story? If there was any I did let you know. Whatever was bored me to death and I will save you the trouble.    Such a boring prose  Admittedly, one  might unfailingly ask –  “why the hell did finish the book?” . The answer is,  Mistry  is one of those authors who manages to keep your hopes alive by some skill. While most of other authors I did be throwing the book back at the wall, authors like  Mistry and John Irving  leave that door open with a little hope that a book might get better; alas that doesn’t happen. The author’s prose is arcane; It is as if he set down to write something else initially, and gradually then it turned into something else. He is also eccentric with some brilliant moments delved in the book, only to be surrounded by vagaries of mundane existence. His take on the holy gods and wall ceremonies are humorous and well handled.   Such a boring review  Forgive yourself for reading this boring review, and forgive me for writing such a boring review as well. It is as if I am in the hang of the book – a listless feeling has swept over me, and deprived me of any skill in writing. My only determination was to warn all my fellow msians against this book, and save your precious money.   Saying that  Mistry  is not a bad author; his second work was almost brilliant; I only hope he gets better with time. And as for me, my boring existence has left me with no new authors to read – thus I now take my sheathing brain towards  Family Matters . Hopefully, that should get me back!  Meanwhile, avoid this one.

      While many Indian authors (who most of them have settled abroad anyway), have written about displaced Indians (example – Rushdie) and weaved fantasy stories around them, there are others who have preferred be an on looker and write stories set in India (example – Mistry). These writers have similar qualities in their characters trying to find their lost souls back in motherland or stories of pathos in the country. However when an author comes along and decides to take a view of an Immigrant life it becomes interesting. It becomes even more interesting when the view is not presented as soul searching drama or triumph of human spirit, but just a book about normal characters, leading their lives normally.  Enter the  Gangulis .  Ashoke Ganguli  is one amongst those who like so many before him enters the American soil to fulfill his dream of leading his life there, beginning as a student at MIT. While as a student, he is also married to  Ashima Ganguli  who finds it difficult to accept her new home. Enter  Gogol Ganguli  a few years ahead, a misplaced namesake to their first son whom they cannot name properly because of a mail lost between the two countries, and who by the time they decide a proper name ‘Nikhil’ seems to have lost himself in the namesake. Enter  Sonali  a.k.a Sonia, Gogol’s sister, and the circle of family is completed. The ‘Namesake’ is their journey as Immigrants trying to find their real identity behind their namesake of being in America, and later holding American citizenship. And while it is the former, it is also about  Nikhil  trying to find a sense in his namesake.   A typical immigrant’s life begins with student life in America; after studies they germinate to good jobs, good cars and so forth. A marriage later and a green card in kitty, its time to start a family; a family being, it’s a struggle trying to bind the personal history to the kids who become more American  - and thus end up being called ABCDs – people displaced and trying to find their acceptance in the foreign land, while still not ready to let go off their roots. Years later, the parents have let go of their children, lost in their own identity crisis of having embraced a foreign land, without letting the roots of homeland go. The next generation, quite nicely becomes jelled and thus one more family is absorbed into the foreign land; but it’s the first and second generation that find it the toughest.    Lahiri  doesn’t boast of telling an awfully touching story or a dramatic novella, but rather weaves a very realistic story of a displaced family. Her characters are immediately believable, and one can relate to such every day characters. All characters, their behavior, their living style make up for a very believable story;  Lahiri  infuses minimum fuss and melodrama in the proceedings. Events in book are given their due respects, and situations and confrontations presented in the book are much authentic – the coming back to India for holidays, Durga Puja and Christmas, children’s non-interest in understanding their roots,  real events make for a riveting story.  However it is not the story per se that holds the reader’s interest. It is in  Lahiri’s  observations of nuances in life that makes the book immensely likeable. She is able to bring out the differences of American and Indian life from an immigrant’s point of view without too many words. Sometimes, it just takes a sentence or two for her to convey her thoughts on conflicting life and ideals. Simple observations like how most first generation Indians don’t quite have any American friends to call their own and close strikes a chord somewhere, even me, because it’s a simple truth. Observations like these are a plenty in the book, and make this a memorable read.    However saying that,  ‘The Namesake’  is a difficult book to relate to. While most of western audience cannot glimpse the nuances of her observations, I would be very surprised if Indian audiences would find her observations real and so true. ‘The Namesake’ treads a middle path, relating to Immigrants, and perhaps lies in a land it belongs nowhere to. Unless you are an immigrant and have seen the other part of Immigrant life, its pretty difficult to relate to the book. Those who are can and will very well relate to the book. Saying that it should not hinder either western or Indian audience to read this book – for it shows how the namesake of American life perpetually confounds the Immigrants.     Overall  An Excellent debut novel (her first was a collection of stories) – A must read for everyone, especially the Immigrants.

       ''In my judgment, when the United States says there will be serious consequences, and if there isn't serious consequences, it creates adverse consequences.''        --George W. Bush, Meet the Press, Feb. 8, 2004    ( I have a devious desire that this idiot gets elected again as the president. That way I will be assured of another four years supply of Bushisms! ) .   -------------------------------------------------  In a nation obsessed with ridiculous debates whether gays should marry or not  (come to think of it, it sounds so very silly when people start claiming Christian values, religious sentiments, conservative bullshit to support their claims against, when it is as simple as two individuals choosing to like each other and staying with each other!) , it is impossible to spend a day watching TV without the mention of Sex, Sleaze or anything equally sensational on TV.  Janet’s nipple-gate event only proves the heights (or rather depths) this society has reached; Britney Spears forms an icon to generation here, and that only indicates the shape of things to come. Sometimes, Saas-Bahu serials provide the mental relief from such  sordid surroundings!  The first things I want to find out about  The Inscrutable Americans  is whether Anurag Mathur is related to Spookdum Swami. If he is, kripaya bathaye! Secondly, I really want to know the inspiration of the hero and his friend came from. A village gook named Gopal meets a sex-starved hyper active Randy (whose name suspiciously sounds funny) when he comes to study at the United States.   The Inscrutable Americans  is a hilarious take of one man’s journey in the land of supposedly free, democratic and blessed by the lord!!!   Per se,  The Inscrutable Americans  is an average book, but it is in its simplicity and not trying to achieve too much that appeals you. For example, Anurag Mathur doesn’t aim to provide nostalgic saga of immigrants,  but simply a year in the life of Gopal when he comes to United States to study. Along he meets his first friend and probably his last friend too – Randy – who tries his best to get him laid but to no avail. In essence, the book is nothing but one boy’s quest of the glory hole, and in between interspersed with Gopal’s own observations of American College life and its bundle of eccentricities it brings with it.  Having myself been at heart of college life here,  its impossible ignore Gopal’s shrewd observations about Americans in general -  a fact I am sure which germinated within author’s head when he too stayed as a student here. His observations of Americans confused between their personal privacy and their public privacy  had me in complete splits! There are some supremely well crafted incidents in the book, but the one which had me in complete howl right in the bus was Gopal’s stint with a Pimp who offers him vegetarian cats. (gosh gosh – enjoy the pun).  Subsequently, his frustration at having dished out 75$ for a Swedish massage had me in fits too; I can easily sympathize the situation there!  Along with the hilarious insights, Anurag Mathur cleverly digs at several issues raking this country like racism, color problems,  the hypocritical views of the conservative idiots, and general American lowness in IQ when it comes to knowing about outside world.  But probably the funniest parts of the book belong to Gloria (the hostel care taker) and her ridiculous poems, along with Gopal’s letters to his brothers. Note the language he uses, and the ever slow increase of American idioms in his letters, especially when he coolly mentions –  Take it easy now .  The writing isn’t anything literary or great, but makes for a very comfortable reading. On the flip side, the book does tend to go overboard in reciting Gopal’s experiences, and while at times seems to drag too. However as said earlier, it was not meant to be a literary classic, so just enjoy it as it comes.    Overall  On the whole,  The Inscrutable Americans  is a good enough book to be picked up, and finished in a jiffy! While its observations may strike non-experienced readers amused, its really the ones  who’ve pursue the holy grail and tread the path to cats that will find this book interesting!    One word – mood for light reading? Pick this one!  ----------------------------------------------------------   The above comment on Bush is not to be taken very seriously! The world will be much happier and safer places without Bushes and his bunch of cronies out.    ''More Muslims have died at the hands of killers than — I say more Muslims — a lot of Muslims have died — I don't know the exact count — at Istanbul. Look at these different places around the world where there's been tremendous death and destruction because killers kill.''        --George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Jan. 29, 2004 (Exactly what was the point?)

      Instantly moving, and instantly gratifying – that’s  Phaniyamma  for you. A microscopic view of a society riddled with inane rules and regulations, caste system and prejudice,  Phaniyamma  succeeds in two ways – first in bringing about a subtle, but significant message, and second by not adhering either for or against the concepts in the book. Does this book endorse a cruel tradition of society? Or does this book in fact question the hypocrisy of the society in a very subtle but significant way? –  Phaniyamma’s  greatest strength lies in the narrative which works both the ways.   Meet  Phaniyamma  in a small village, who is married off to an older man as in the norm of child marriage. The astrological stars have predicted a great match and wonderfully glorious long life of happiness. However, stars couldn’t have been in a much displaced position –  Phaniyamma  grows to be a widow at 12.  A society riddled with inane rules for widows. Widows must shave their heads, wear whites, eat once a day, stay away from others and practice the  madi  - the act of purification in daily work. In addition, a widow must work day in and out till her dying day. In an effect, she has been punished for her man dying. Witness Phaniyamma in such delirious settings in a highly prejudicial and rule based society, trying to understand her widowhood, even before she knows herself as a woman.  A widow woman leads her in a mindless existence, adhering to all the rules and dharma of the society. Phaniyamma never knows how it is to be a mother, how it is to be a woman.  Phaniyamma  shuns the union of man and woman for her cause, her destiny. Travel  Phaniyamma  a victim of social prejudice and hollow rules which move her mentally, but she doesn’t speak a word against them.  Years later a woman in the same household cannot accept that her whole life is going to while away as a widow. A Muslim family needs help to bear a child. Society has changed, rules have been mended, and life a little more luxurious than it could have been. Meet  Phaniyamma  then, the victor, as she supports the woman in her household, and then again she helps the Muslim family – her life free from the moral obligations of the rustic society.   The victim and the victor – Phaniyamma is both.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The original book was written in Kannada by  M. K. Indira  which won the Sahitya Akademi Award for the best book. The translation in English by  Tejaswini Niranjana  also won the Sahitya Akademi award for best translation. A movie in the same name swept the national and local awards as well. The writing is simple, straight and to the point. No extravagant details, no overtly done situations. A journey of 113 years covered, well within 160 pages, perhaps indicates the strength of this book. The author herself mentions in the beginning that she writes the book because she thinks something is of significance to be told to us – which is exactly  true .   She brings about  Phaniyamma  as women who stuck to the rules laid out by society and lead them without questioning them. As a devout woman, her life was of peace and brining about help and peace in household – a respected woman,  Phaniyamma  is the moral example of a woman not questioning the society but fulfilling life’s obligations.   But ever without mentioning it or asking the reader to think upon, the author brings about the other side of the society in the reader. A gripping narrative succeeds in forcing the reader to question the very morality and rules of the bygone society, without ever hinting at it once through the eyes of the protagonist. Its in the strength of  Phaniyamma  as the victim of society and the eventually the victor within the very society that leaves you sad and happy at the same moment.   Overall...  A superb book – not to be missed by book connoisseurs.

      It might be perhaps intentional or unintentional, but there is a remarked difference in the two novels even though they are quite literally the same. In fact, the prose, the style and the writing never ceases to change, and yet the change in both the books comes across to you. Perhaps, that is the biggest strength of writing of this author.   Discover a very emotionally written Boyhood filled with incidents that simply linger on in your mind; at the same breadth, you are bound to get struck by the raw emotiveness of Youth. Smaller incidents and smaller questions mark the boy’s life – “Why am I not normal?”, “Why will aunt not stay with us?” to his sexual awakening as an adolescent. At Youth, discover john asking himself “when will my time come”, “why can’t I write”, “Where am I going?”.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moments haunting you long after appear in both the books, but perhaps, it is the largeness of the surroundings that make Boyhood richer in terms of story setting and discovery. In a bus, besides his mother, he lets something go in the wind – nothing dramatic about it, but yet so poignantly recalled. At his school, he doesn’t know what he is  - A Christian, a Catholic, A Jew or someone else; and a price he pays for being one of them. His turmoil not only stems from his own family, but also due to the surroundings or probably the lack of them.   Conversely,  an older John needs to find himself first. His questions and his world is limited to him, his poetry, and his ambitions. Perhaps, it’s the smallness of the surroundings of Youth and the remarkable process of self discovery which has its own moments. While, not many moments strike you, yet his discoveries on appropriate behavior with the Indian couple,  or his inner feelings when he beds a woman he doesn’t want to stay with.  But perhaps, it is own self in the other Indian that is the most memorable part of the book.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Coetzee writes without inhibitions and without any premonitions of writing a well  sounding completely justifiable autobiography; which is the strength of both the books; He is not writing about how he made through his life, nor does he aim to preach you anything. He merely recites his journey, allowing you, as a reader to make judgments about him. Nor does he overcome all his fears or all his weaknesses, but then he didn’t need to be.  Like in any other Coetzee book, (or maybe the resemblances to others these two books have) is the ending. Like his other works, the books just end; just right,  just about time, as if its almost Coetzee knows its about time wrap up.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Overall    Boyhood  and  Youth ,  are a very well written memoir of a very distinguished author of our times.  Its difficult writing reviews on both of them, for they must be read – first  Boyhood  and then  Youth  in that order only.  Overall – yet another must – read  books from Coetzee.

      Talking about two novels, written differently in time  Boyhood  and  Youth  in two separate reviews is pretty difficult, since they are one and the same book; the latter is a continuation from the end of  Boyhood . I have come to believe now that J. M. Coetzee is simply one of the very best writers around in this world, who all books are challenging, and yet subtle in nature of their own. The two books, aptly tagged as “Scenes from Provincial Life 1” and “Scenes from Provincial Life 2” provide an insight into the author’s past from his boyhood till his youth, when Coetzee discovers what he wanted to do and become in the world.   Boyhood   Meet John, aged 8 sometime in the 1940’s in South Africa. His family has shifted from hustle and bustle of Cape Town to a country side village – a place where all streets are named by tree names, and yet no trees actually grew there. Elsewhere a World War II rages on in the other parts of the world, though he doesn’t understand exactly how it that they are involved. South Africa is a nation in turmoil, yet he doesn’t exactly know what is so paining the African nation.  At school, John is always first in his class – not because he is clever and  wants  to, but because he is scared of failing and getting beaten by his teachers. It’s a fear which refuses to let him go – the fear of not being a normal boy like others; not being a normal child like his classmates. He resents his dad; he adores his mom, and yet cannot wait to despise her and leave her for good. His brother too is a normal child, but he is bound by fear of things going wrong, and fear of him doing things wrong.   In an environment besieged by violence, turmoil, guilt, arrogance and self pity, John grows up to his adolescence.  Boyhood  is the journey to his adolescence.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Youth   A young man wants to leave his home badly. He has left his mother and his sordid past behind him. He studies his graduation at a university, while working to consolidate his living. He has a dream, of going to United Kingdom. He also has his real dream – of being a Poet. He convinces himself that London is the place where he can become a poet.  He still hates his mother; he still loves her as well – she is overbearing, over concerned and over loving – whilst, he needs to break away from her mould. He has discovered that he is not as clever as he was in his boyhood in schools; mathematics is interesting though not something he really wanted to do.  His relationships don’t last long. His flings with women don’t seem to last long. He needs to get to London, to find his inspiration in form of love, and then to become a poet; as he believes all artists need true love to motivate them, so does he wait for his love and his moment to besiege him.  Instead, he must work to live. He must work like a normal man, earning daily bread. Though he lands a luxurious job, he is still awaiting his love, his inspiration and his moment when he will set out to write the poetry he always dreamed of.   In a world of self consciousness, bereft confidence and the anguish of not leading a life he wants to, he passes the  Youth  of his life. At times a discovery, at times an anguish and at other times  fear  of losing that he still possesses from his boyhood haunt him.     Youth  is this journey from his adolescence to a man.

      So, finally after all the brouhaha about India Shining and Feel Good factor, it all boiled down to the un-shining and the felt-bad sector of the country which cost the BJP the mandate to lead India once more.  Its ironic though, we are probably voting away a government which was actually doing good work – or perhaps, to put it politically correct, was doing great work for a section of society in India.  While its debatable whether  Vajpayee  did or did not deserve another term at the office, one cannot possibly argue the power of rural vote in India.  And here is an example, where the rural vote was yet once again deceived (again, debatable), and another party has come to power to lead India, ironically by a European – or make that Indian perhaps.  Instead of looking at what Congress did  right  in these elections, it is more interesting and important to look what BJP did  wrong .     - BJP didn’t really do badly, but somehow they got carried away in their own reform ideas and trying vehemently to put India on global map, even before putting their own people under their confidence.   - I have never supported BJP ultra soft approach to NRI brethrens and resulting political fiascos. While their  “Yatri Divas”  program was much indeed novel idea to promote tourism, their  “NRI Divas”  was as dumb as a dead cuckoo. If only BJP had devised something like “Farmer day” or “Rural Day”  in  addition to their fancy dress competition of NRI divas, they would have been more balanced in their outlook.  - BJP certainly needs to get over the foreign origin issue which it has kept harping and harping about incessantly.  Agreed, Sonia Gandhi may have been (and may still be) a foreigner, but truth of the matter was, Sonia reached out to people with BJP didn’t during the campaign – and it showed. BJP was given a chance in these 5 years to bring a bill preventing people from foreign origin to hold an important post, though they didn’t, and well it backfired.  As for me, Sonia Gandhi looks dumb to me, and is unfit for the post of PM, and that’s about it; whether she is Indian or not is simply a secondary issue.  BJP could have instead questioned her political experience and qualification she had for the post rather than harp and cry about her foreigner issue.  - Pro-Reforms but where? India Inc definitely has shown promising results in the last five years, and yes a lot of credit does go to the BJP. And yet,  BJP/TDP in Andhra Pradesh could not explain farmer’s suicide, the state’s  burgeoning deficit bill and overall  state of the state’s rural areas. I personally consider  Chandra Babu Naidu  to be a visionary and fit enough to lead our country, but his over enthusiasm of developing a Silicon Hyderabad cost him dearly. Same applies to  S. M. Krishna . He wasn’t bad either – however one city centric reforms cost him the election.  It’s the same at the center as well – the urban centric approach.   - BJP’s change of stance change from pro-Hindutva to secular party spoiled a good part of their vote pie for them.  While the minorities still preferred to vote otherwise, BJP cut into its own skin by keeping away RSS, VHP and others at bay. I no way support VHP or RSS for their ridiculous activities, but the fact is, even if RSS / VHP and likes could convince 5% of their own people to stop supporting BJP, that still meant that BJP lost a chunk of their own votes.  Its to BJP’s fault that the Ram Mandir issue has flameballed into something so communal and ridiculous; what was on their agenda 5 years ago, well, remained there - A costly move that cost the BJP.  - One of the best things BJP did for the country was to start building Roads, the much necessary building blocks of a nation. Vajpayee’s dream project does deserve that mention, and it was indeed something the nation needs badly.  But BJP had to defend itself from issues of Dubey’s murder and such likes. Unfortunately, and very unluckily for Vajpayee, he spent the better part of his PM time settling Amma’s and Mamtas of our country. On that accounts, yes he has been very unlucky. Congress doesn’t have any great shakes. With their rates of scandals hitting the TV with ferocious regularity, neither do they have great allies and friends within whom I am sure Sonia Gandhi or whoever will become PM will have a nicety to.  -  While the top rung of the BJP did have some really good people,  they had their own share of fanatics and show stealers too. I have never liked  Sushma Swaraj , however intelligent she showcases herself to be. Half the time she spent bringing adult call centers and adult channels and the likes down. I don’t say she didn’t do a good thing, but there is something called freedom of speech and freedom of democracy – over doing it is not appreciated by all and sundry.  But what went really wrong for them was the  Murli Manohar Joshi  and his IIM fiasco. BJP were targeting the middle and upper class sensibilities – how could they even miscalculate Joshi’s jingo on the election? Not only in India, but people out here too were amused by the fiasco, which in many ways hurt the image of BJP.  The issue could have held till they had been reelected, at least!  - Godhra Riots was a big face downer for the BJP.  Whether it was intentional done, or unintentionally done, the fact of the matter is that BJP had to make do with all the blame game and all the shame of the incident. Objectively thinking, BJP had a lot to lose from the incident; even their excellent political gamble of selecting Kalam as President didn’t work at all.   But then, the verdict is clear. Congress will probably be able to form the next government, and the dumb lady will become our next Prime Minister. More than anything else, it’s the fact that an absolute unqualified person is going to sit and rule is the worst thing to happen to India. If Congress were sensible, then they did grab the opportunity by both hands, and possibly elect a dignified personality like  Manmohan Singh  to lead the country. BJP has proactively led many projects, be it reforms, tourism or development – Congress have the best possible opportunity to build upon the pedestal already laid for them. It remains to be seen, 5 years later where it all leads to.  As a parting quote, I am neither for congress nor for BJP. But, I think in the current political scenario of corrupt and deteriorating Congress, BJP  deserved  another chance. I think we as public of India were rather rude on the party by not even giving them a much needed second chance to prove their mettle, while we are the very same people who have tolerated a dynasty for nearly 5 decades.  Perhaps, nothing makes more sense to me today than these golden words –   “Bad politicians are elected by good people who don’t vote”. .   Next time, I will make my vote count!  For now, a nation waits...
