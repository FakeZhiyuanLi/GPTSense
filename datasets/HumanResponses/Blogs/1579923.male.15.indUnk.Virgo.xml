      I worked today.  It wasn't too bad.  In fact., it got rather interesting when someone spilled their large Coke (boo) into the popcorn heater.  Luckily, the popcorn soaked up most of the mess.  Then I stood around for a few hours, then I cleaned hot-dog residue off of the rollers, then I left.  Afterwards I went to a send off party for some AWC members going to Columbia and Palestine.  I didn't know too many people, and I felt .bad that I had no money with me, particularily because they passed around a basket church-style.

      My view of the human race, combined with a little humor from the other side of the mental pond...  CMS = Cassie the Mad Scientist RAG = Random Apprentice Guy EMC = Egocentric Mofo Creation  CMS: "Yes, yes Random Apprentice Guy, bring me a sprinkle of Flattery and the whole damn bottle of Narcissim! This will be my best creation yet! Muah ha ha ha!"  RAG: "Um. Cassie..."  CMS: "THAT’S CASSIE THE MAD SCIENTIST TO YOU, BITCH!"  RAG: "Yes, Cassie the Mad Scientist. Are you quite sure you want to do this? I mean, what if your creation's ego, like, swallows the entire town?"  CMS: "DO YOU DOUBT MY GENIUS!?"  RAG: "No, ma'am! I don't doubt your genius. It’s genius alright, I’m just wondering if maybe...the world isn't ready for it?"  CMS: "Well fuck you with a stick!"  RAG: "Yes, ma'am. Your Flattery and Narcissim is on the way."  CMS: "That's a good abused Random Apprentice Guy! And while you’re at it, bring me The Blood of Yes-Men, a sprinkle of Success, and an extracted gene for Blowing Things Wildly Out of Proportion. The perfect egocentric super-human will be created at my hand!"  *~*Time Passes*~*  CMS: "IT'S ALIVE!!!!!!!!! MUAH HA HA HA HA!!!! So how does life feel, Egocentric Mofo Creation???"  EMC: "me...think...me...prettier than you!!"  CMS: "YOU SON OF A BITCH! Random Apprentice Guy, tell this idiot who is boss!!!"  RAG: "Uh. You are?"  CMS: "That’s right, you mofos. And don’t forget it!"  EMC: "Me... smarter... than... you. Me... eat... you." *EMC picks up  CMS and dangles her above his mouth*  CMS: "A LITTLE HELP, YOU LAZY, CRIPPLED RANDOM APPRENTICE GUY!!!"  RAG: "I told you the world wasn't ready, ma'am..."  EMC: "You... you unworthy of my presence!"  CMS: "You big pile of self absorbed shit, I created you and can break you just as easily!" (a la Rocky Horror)  RAG: "Cassie the Mad Scientist, don’t you remember? A massive ego cannot be reasoned with! Their brains are too over taken and shrunken by the sheer weigh of their own self-conceit that they have no room to form any other coherent thoughts!"  CMS: "NOW you tell me!?"  RAG: “You have created a monster, Cassie the Mad Scientist.”  EMC: "You no use to me. But perhaps you make a worthy entree."  CMS: "Oh shit."  THE END.  Epilogue - So, the Egocentric Mofo Creation ate Cassie the Mad Scientist. After that, out of perhaps fear, and perhaps wisdom, the Random Apprentice Guy joined forces with the creation. Together they pillaged the entire town with their massive egos. The creation would make absurd statements of his superiority, and while the townspeople were on their knees in fits of laughter, the creation would crush them, and the apprentice would stick their bodies on a spit and roast them for dinner.  .+*^*+.+*^*+. The REAL End .+*^*+.+*^*+.

      Having watched Kill Bill, I have to think; despite their super-high coolness factor, I find assassins morally lacking.  Unless they are fighting an opressor.  The end.

      Hmm... I was an usher today instead of concessions, which meant that I got to tear tickets, and carry heavy boxes upstairs, and clean, and sweep the theatres, and do concessions.  Overall, I prefer it quite a bit to actually working concessions.  After I was done, I watched Kill Bill Vol. 2, and I would recommend it to anyone.  When that was over I went outside. lol.  I really do like Centennial Lakes.  At night, that is.  Not quite so much during the day.  Um... I figure I should say or do something interesting now... um... yeah...  BTW/Disclaimer:  I am not responsible for anyone elses posts.  lol.

      This is the best movie ever.  I don't do blurbs, so I've pasted the description from IMdb below.  This really is a great movie, though.  Watch it.  Now!!!  Martin Blank is a professional assassin. He is sent on a mission to a small Detroit suburb, Grosse Pointe, and, by coincidence, his ten-year high school reunion party is taking place there at the same time.

      Truck hauling bees crashes in Montana  Dumps honey, sending bees on rampage  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 Posted: 11:08 AM EDT (1508 GMT)   BOZEMAN, Montana (AP) -- A tractor-trailer overturned on a curve on a highway, spilling its load of hundreds of bee hives and unleashing some nine million angry honey bees.As in real estate, the key to this bee spill was location, location, locations as the crash occured just a few hundred yards away from "the Bozeman openair center for young, slow childrem with extreme bee sting alergies". Because of the massive spill the price for domestic honey is expected to sky rocket, just in time for the start of the summer honey season. Earlier today the anounce of the "honey hike" cause and uproar of civil disobediance and widespread rioting and looting. Damage from the uprising is projected in the billions.

      I was up till 5am yesterday, and then I woke up at 11:30am today to call and see if I needed to come into work.  I did, and it turns out it was because the person who was supposed to be there was sick, and left as soon as I arrived.  This wasn't much of an issue, and there was only one ten-minute period in which there was a big enough line that another person would have been useful.  In fact, it was so slow today as to be incredibly, horribly boring.  To pass the time, I did as follows as slowly and repeatedly as possible, because anything is better then just standing by the register:       1)Wash my hands (a good idea, yes, but I definately over did it, in an OCD sort of way)      2)Clean counters      3)Fill bags of popcorn      4)Sweep      5)Refill napkin dispensers      6)Repeat over and over again for four hours  That was about it.  It was horrible.  On the bright side, I'm now a little closer to a particular electronic device.

       sanrio is focusing on not only the tiara wearing population but the increadibly stupid tiara wearing comunity with the release of its platinum tiara jewellery decorated with 'Hello Kitty' charm at the company headquarters in Tokyo, June 16, 2004. The tiara, encrusted with 167 pink and black colour diamonds and seven pearls, will go on sale in Japan from July to commemorate Hello Kitty's 30th anniversary. Sanrio's Kitty tiara will be available by made-to-order at three million yen ($27,300)  alright in the first place if you are wearing a tiara arent you alittle above hello kitty. i would hope so. secondly who wears a tiara in the first place, i know i dont, and thirdly with $27300 couldnt you buy somthing a great deal better than a stupid hello kitty trinkit, like say a car, a kick ass home theater system, a shit load of other cool hello kitty paraphanelia or fair amount of crack  a closing thought, if you purchase this tiara my recomendation is to be decapitated with you head put on a stake in the town square with a sign that reads "i am a total idiot when it comes to spendiing  money"

      today was...ABSOLUTLEY TERRIFYING.  i went to the doctor. i woke up at 7am so i could get stripped, stabbed, and interrogated while wearing a blue body bag.  so i was sitting there while a perfect stranger is groping me and suddenly shes like "so, how are you feeling about life?" and i just felt like screaming. HOW THE FUCK DO U THINK I'M FEELING!?  they drew blood to feed their vampiristic tastes.  those wicked doctors.  and she kept asking me if i do drugs and had sex over and over. its like "yeah, i shoot up heroine every day and i prostitute on the courner of vicksburg" WHY THEY FUCK DID U BOTHER ASKING!?  argh.  to our halo fan: its more fun to think nick is doin' drugs. :)  so i am off to shoot up and put on my "whorin' outfit." :P  Cheers, Cassie

      By Nick Groenke Washington Post Domestic Service Tuesday, June 15, 2004; 7:45 PM   Contrary to popular belief and a Leann Chin fortune cookie, 8 year old Alexa Groenke is not welcome in most gatherings.  After consuming an entree size plate of lemon chiked at Leann Chin's today, Alexa openned her fortune cookie, and was pleased to see that her fortune was "You are welcome at any gathering."  The cookie's claims were later disproven on the car ride home, when Alexa was told she was not welcome to come with her brother and his friends to Rigedale mall this Friday.  Staff writer Jackie Spinner contributed to this report.

      I got a disc full of pictures from my uncle from our trip to the Boundry Water Canoe Area a couple weeks ago.  I've been looking through them, and they're pretty high quality.  Below is part of the note he sent with the pics, as well as a picture.  I am the one in the grey sweatshirt.  I'll probably put some more pics online, but I have a limited selection, as I'm not gonna post any with anyone else's face in them.

      The party turned out to be rather smallish, but also rather funnish.  We rented movies, then watched Canadian Bacon (Micheal Moore).  Then we ate.  I've made that its own sentence, so I can easily start a brief paragraph about the food.  When I was called last night to see if I was allergic to any foods, I said that I don't eat meat, and was told that there would be a vegetarian option.  I was expecting cheese pizza.  Instead, we had spaghetti (with the meatballs on the side, thanks for being so accomodating), salad (delicious, if hard to get on my fork), this sort of bread stuff with garlic (real) and tomatoes on top, which was excellent, and black forest cake.  It was all amazing.  After that, we watched Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, which was hilarious, though rather tastless in some spots.  Thats it.  Bye.

      so today was boring but cool, as i got some new tunes last night.  nick is at a party, and i remember him musing about it possibly being a "halo" party. and i'm not sure why, but the first thing that came to mind was drugs. i was gunna be all like "nick! you've hurt me so much..." but i decided it was just my weird mind. and it was. turns out it is a video game. i dont have a twisted mind. i swear.  so anyway! my union worked, even though eric was just kinda like "um. ok." so now, if u look to the right (your other right, for the disoriented) there are 2 more sections. the one in red is mine, and will have riddles. it isnt totally finished, i wanna have a drawing and a link with the answer to the current riddle. eric's is there in green, but it hasnt been touched yet.  does anyone truely understand how sick of movies i am? seriously. i saw shrek a couple days ago, which was fine. but then i saw troy last night, which wasn't too hard, cause it was a good movie as well. but now i have to go out with my mother and see ANOTHER MOVIE. and of course, i'll hate it, because the only kind of movies my mom likes to see is romantic comedies, which, quite honestly, make me ill.  but anyway. i think i'm quite done with that mini rant, ha ha.  and in the sport of all things cool, leave me a comment or be a rectangular thing.  Cheers, Cassie  P.S. because i am a massive idiot, i have forgotten how to edit my own profile. can someone remind me? heh...

      what comes to your mind when i say chardonnay if your anything like me, some thing classy and sophisticated (big word) but my believe of the classyness of the wine produceing community was thrown out the window today  as i was browsing the ads in the sunday paper something caught my eye, Thierry and guy, fatbastard chardonnay. "hmmm" i thought as i stroked my waist lenght beard "hmmm, indeed"  a short bit later i decided to confer with nick the amazing on the subject of wine company ethics  i was surprised by such a vulgar name in what i thought was a very classy industry  welll long story short i am part of the fat bastard fan club  i am also a supporter of the number fourty seven but thats a story for another blog  id like to close on a note that brought a lot of joy to my transplanted pig heart they reran the SNL with lindsay lohan last night i greatly enjoyed it  with that in mind i have decided what i want on my tombstone  "lindsay lohan is hot"

      Hey!  I got my scanner working, so I'm fairly happy.  It also means that I'll spend most of today scanning, then photoshopping pencil sketches.  Its maddenning, cus they look great in pencil on paper, but when they're scanned, half the lines have disappeared.  I'm using the burn tool to darked parts, but its not perfect.  I really need an inking pen --not that I'd ink any of my old sketches.  Secondly, I have added a couple of inline frames on the right of this page, at the prompting of certain parties *cough* Mistress Nomad *cough*.  They are still under construction until either contributor wishes to contribute.  Mine is set to automatically display whatever I last played in Winamp.  Cya, Nick

WELL YA KNOW WHAT, BITCH!? I WANT MINE! i want a section called "the phyco bitch from hell is destroying this:" and i want you to teach me how to use it (says the HTML impared freak). and eric should get a section for...erm...whatever the hell it is eric likes to do! you are totally an evil oppressor, nick. and my voice shall be heard!  so...um...yeah.  sufficed to say, i have already given up the war against swearing. this is my new war! ^_~  at any rate, as i have nothing else to say and i believe i have made my request quite *cough* crystal clear, i should high-tail it outta here.  ha, c ya later. i'm blowin' this popsicle stand.

      My little sister has this Harry Potter wand thing.  When you flick your wrist, some green plastic telescopes out to represent the magic.  I just saw a little bit of Van Helsing today while on break, and if you've seen it too, you'll know what I mean by this next bit.  I think that this wand is just like that retractable silver steak in Van Helsing.  The one where you push the button, and out springs the sharp point.  Where is my silver spray paint...

Cassie here. well, had lots o' fun with Nick the amazing today. i drove him right through a fountain, the highlight of my evening.  so on personal news, i am trying to stop swearing. i have a vocabulary that makes sailors blush and turns toddlers into foul-mouthed deliquents.  so my limit for all LJ-Blogger related writing it 1 swear word per entry, and in person, 5 per day. trust me, its more of a strech than it sounds like.  so now that i have taken over Nick's Blog, i must find a new land to conquer, and a new soul to devestate.  see ya on the flip side,  Cheers, Cassie

      I went to see Shrek 2 today with K(s) and C.  I can get in free now, which is good times.  Today was certainly full of spontanaity, partly cus I really didn't plan it out, and partly, I'm sure, cus of C.  After the movie (which was at Centennial Lakes) we walked down by the lakes, and C decided we were gonna go paddle boating, so we did.  First we went around a bit, then C steered us into a fountain, which was wet.  Then we went to run down some ducks.  We thought we had one cornered against the rocks, but how wrong we were.  The duck turned at the last minute, and we got stuck in the sand.  K(s) had to hop out and push us off.  Then we were about to leave, and C decided we were gonna go to Chucky Cheese, so we did.  We even got some tokens.  We played storm stopper, and ski-ball, and this one other game, and C rode on this stupid ride that would even go up and down.  Then we ate, then we talked for a bit.  Then K(s) showed up and said we had to leave.  She had redeemed our tickets for a receipt, and it turned out we had 168, which was quite more than we thought.  We were gonna buy a dolphin slinky or a playdough cup or something, but then we decided to give the tickets to some little kid.  I figure that more then makes up for wearing a shirt that was made by some kid in a sweatshop in Pakistan.  And thats the end of that chapter.

      We had open lunch today.  I didn't go, but I sent some money with a couple of people to pick me up a smoothy from Jamba Juice.  Something strawberry, I said, something with double protein (I don't eat meat).  They came back with an excellent beverage, but half empty.  Apparently it was left on the roof of a car.  I hear it was quite funny.  I wish I had been there :)  Anyway, schools over, so thats the end of that chapter.

       urlLink    This is the funniest Boondocks strip I've read in a couple of weeks.  Oddly, it seems less one sided then usual.  I can see both sides of the issue in this strip.  It states that sovereignty in Iraq is a joke, and there is no way that its gonna happen, but it also says that, in fact, full severeignty might not be a good idea, just as turning over the keys to the gun cabinet might not be a good idea.  I could be missing something, but whatever the message, this truly is a funny strip.

      I've gotta say something about this, even though I really don't have a big opinion, simply because it was tucked away, and I think its worth notice.   urlLink New York Times Article   Basically, we are pulling out one third of the 37,500 troops we currently have stationed in South Korea.  Since North and South Korea are currently in a state of truce (no peace treaty) they are technically still at war.  The North Korean army is 1.1 million strong, so our troops have symbolic and deterrent value more than anything else.  Many South Koreans were surprised by the partial withdrawl, and Pyongyang said that the US troop cuts were actually to mask an imminent invasion of North Korea (paranoid or what?).  The US maintains that the cuts are simply part of it's plan to increase focus on technological warfare, creating smaller, more mobile units.  3,600 of the 12,500 troops will be redeployed in Iraq.  What I think about all of this is... well... I really don't have an opinion on the topic, other than NK would never attack, so a removal of troops might help ease the tensions.  I really don't think any of the troops should be sent to Iraq, as 140,000 American troops in a supposedly sovereign (on the 30th) country is plenty.

      Good news!  Iraq now has a fighting force trained by Americans with which it can handle it's internal affairs and defend itself from outside threats.  This 'army' consists of 1710 people all armed with AK-47s.  Wow.  Thats great.  They can totally handle all four of the major militias in Iraq, the millions of unemployed, angry citizens, and all of the outside threats.  Perhaps thats not as good as it seemed at first.  Luckily for the Iraqis, they have us Americans (the same people who are limiting their military) protect them.  And for this 'protection', we charge a small fee: their oil.  It may sound like we're some sort of organised crime group, but it really is a deal, if you look at it more closely. 1) We invade, then occupy Iraq, destroying their military structure and supplies. 2) We make their military (which did not engage US forces) illegal, and force it to disband. 3) We put Haliburton in charge of the petroleum industry in Iraq. 4) We establish the Iraqi National Task Force (INTF), limit their numbers to 7500, and train them all with ak-47s (we ain't givin' them any planes or tanks, or anything else they may need to actually maintain national security).  Actually, I can think of several things we seem to be after by doing this: 1) If we see a bunch of news articles right after 6/30 about how the INTF if quashing the anti-american rebellion, it looks like a)Iraqis really do want us there and b)Iraq really is sovereign, as evidence by their military. 2) We keep them weak so that we can maintain our occupying force with the excuse of protecting them. 3) We can take all their oil in exchange for protecting them, because they can't do it themselves with their artificially weakened military.  Actually, this all sounds very much like what the British did around 1920 when there was a rebellion in Iraq.  In fact, they even created a little, volunteer based military force, and kept their own military in place (we are keeping all 140,000 troops in Iraq, even after the 'transfer of power' on the 30th).   urlLink http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/771A6660-4D6C-462A-A987-BEF93FD2A14C.htm

      Bush supports democracy in the middle east, right?  Isn't that why we went and occupied Iraq (though the reason keeps changing)? Bush support peace in the middle east, right?  Isn't that why we occupy Iraq? Bush wants peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, right?   urlLink Wrong.   When Palestinians wanted to hold democratic elections, they wanted the help of the United States.  We could totally do that.  If we can spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a war and an occupation to bring democracy to Iraq, we can certainly spend a bit of time and cash peacefully bringing democracy to a violent, tense area of the middle east.  But we don't.  This leads me to conlude, once more, that American leaders are only interested in Israeli supremacy.  Israel is our foothold in the middle east.  Why would we acknowledge Palestinian legitimacy?

      Alexa (sister, 8yrs) is crying now because her tree is dead.  I have to say, I saw it coming.  It was this tiny, 10 inch tree with a couple of leaves.  Now it looks like a stick in the ground.  We figure bugs ate the leaves, or the recent storm just whipped all 'em off.  Actually, I think someone mowed it down, but no one will admit to it.  So shes crying.  Come on... where does she get this stuff?  I'm liberal, but not in a tree-hugger way.  I guess she just looked at it like a pet or something.  Oh well.

      With the commemoration of D-Day, Bush continues to compare the occupation of Iraq with the liberation of France and the defeat of the Nazis in World War II.  I think we can all see some fundamental differences here.  1) Our leader during WWII didn't have to lie to us about the Nazis to get us to go to war. 2) The Nazis really did pose a threat to us, and the rest of the world. 3) Sadaam wasn't invading country after country. 4) We didn't stick around France forever stealing their natural resources. 5) We didn't torture the French or the Nazis. 6) We didn't instigate WWII.  I'm sure there are dozens more.  Comment.

      I was on my way out the door this morning to go the a bring-back-our-troops demonstration downtown, when I got a call from my boss saying that I was actually schedualed for work, and I was 30 minutes late.  Apparently this was my first day.  I know I was told that my first day would be after school was out... but oh well.  So I showed up at the theatre and met my 'trainer' and clocked in (I get $6.25/hour, which is minimum wage).  For the first hour it was incredibly slow and boring working concessions cus everyone was going to see Harry Potter (we are a second-run theatre, so we won't get HP for about a week).  After a bit it picked up and I took and filled orders and such.  It really is easy work.  The cash registers are all touch screen, and I don't even have to figure out the change myself.  My favorite is when someone pays by credit card, cus then I get to swipe it, and there is no change to give at all :)  -Nick

      Well, here I am at the debate dealie. Lots of  urlLink pictures  have been taken.  I am working on a Kritik (pronounced 'critique') on international law. The idea is the aff's plan boosts international law, and international law is inherently oppressive, and thats bad. I may even be able to link to genocide. The part I'm having difficulties with is the alternative. I need a way to try and solve the aff's harms and claim their advantages without boosting international law. Anyway, all this requires me to read about 50,000 words in the next day or so. Oh well.

      I bought a bottle of Evian today, not because I wanted to drink it, but because it intrigued me that this water had seeped through the ground in France, been bottled, then brought over to the United States on a boat.  These 500 ml (about 16.9 oz) had made quite a trip, and now I held them bottled in my hand.  The very idea is interesting to think about.  The other interesting thing is the fact that anyone would pay $.07 (where is the cents symbol, anyway?  it used to be above the 2) an ounce for water on a regular basis.  I know this has been discussed before, but it really is an indication when we in the midwest --and area rich in fresh water- will pay more money for bottled water that we can get at the tap, then we will for bottled pop (about $.05 an ounce, if bought in 20 ounce bottles at the same gas station).   Bottled water has become a status symbol, and prematurely at that.  In a few decades, when we have polluted and used a huge percentage of the fresh water available on earth, when millions are dying of drought, and when water is difficult to obtain, then its perfectly logical for water to be a status symbol.  Now, though, when you can still get free water at the fountain next to the bathroom, people buy a bottle and set it on their desk or carry it around to give the contemporary, health concious look, as well as to say, "Look at me.  My disposeable income is such that I am willing to pay a large overhead for foreign water."  This while people are dying accross the world from a lack of water caused by the very corporation that provides it to US first-worlders.  There is currently an effort around the U.S. to boycott Coca-Cola products.  This is because (for the most part) of Coke's connection with the deaths of trade unionists in Columbia.  I, however, have another good reason to say, "Screw you, Coke!"  My reason is that Coke sets up camp outside villages in third world countries (though the terms first- and third-world are rather archaic) and drains the water table to make their product and cool their machinery.  This, of course, causes a lack of water for the people that wish to drink it and water their crops.  I say, "Screw you, Coke!" because they aren't just killing tade unionists.  Finally, bringing together the theme of Coca-Cola and bottled water is Coke's  Dasani  brand water.  Dasani never actually says its spring water, nor is it.   Dasani is simply filtered tap water (of which we have some of the cleanest in the country, here in Bloomington) with added salt to get you hooked.  Sounds a little like less deadly cancer sticks, to me.  Fight globalization, Nick

      I have gotten very good at the same-sex marriage argument.  I recently got a comment to some post or another that was against gay marriages, and I decided to post about it instead of replying.   urlLink Here is the original comment.    Point 1 (from comment):   What have you got against traditional gender roles? I am a guy and therefore I am not suited to be a mother. I don't feel put out by that; rather, I'm happy that one day I will be a father.  I have nothing  against  traditional gender roles, I just don't think people should be forced into them.  Traditionally its only acceptable for men to love women, and women are supposed to stay in the kitchen.  Also, the example you use is flawed in that an electrician must be trained to do what he/she (yes, women can be electricians, too) does, where as being a mother or father generally is a job without a lot of pre-job training.  There have been studies done and papers/books written by qualified people that demonstrate that a male and female are not necessary to raise a child, and, indeed, the children raised by a male and female tend not to be any better off.  Also, I don't appreciate your sexist "women shouldn't act like men/vice-versa" comment.   Point 2:  It is true that 50% of marriages end in divorce, but don't forget that the statistics are skewed by the people who get married and then get a divorce and then they do it again--and again, and again, ad nauseum.  Also, don't forget that you can't complain about frequent divorce, because it was people with your ideology who made divorce so easy and accessible in the first place. If you want people to get married and stay together, you should make divorce harder than breaking up with a boyfriend. You can't fault the people who subscribe to a mindset that the liberals themselves have fostered.   I don't complain about the divorce rate, I simply state that there is no way that the institution of marriage can be harmed by more people who love each other getting married.   Point 3:  Homosexuals don't really need to get married anyway. Infidelity will be rampant among homosexual couples, just as it is now. In Norway, only a few thousand gays have bothered to get married in the past 10 years, and that's because they find they have more freedom to sin when they aren't married. In one year, many gays have 40 or more sexual "partners," thus decimating the argument that homosexuals are faithful.  Heterosexuals don't need to get married either.  Infidelity is rampant among heterosexuals.  If you are going to bring religious values into this (you use the word sin) you better be able to tell me why they are so important.  Many heterosexuals have a lot of partners too.  This is the part where I call you a bigotted jackass with no sources.  You are simply talking out your ass.  (sorry, Dad :P  )  As for not needing to get married, look at Virginia.  Marriages are important so that the two partners can have wills, and visitation rights, and medical stuff (lol).  Also, marriages are important because not recognizing them is the same as saying that gays are second class citizens, not allowed the same rights that straights are.   Point 4:  Finally, don't forget that once the definition of marriage is changed to include gay couples, what will stop it from changing to allow people to marry several spouses? If I really love myself, do I have a right to marry myself? What about my dog? He is a very cute dog, after all, and I'm sure he would be faithful to me for ever. If I really like my dining room table, what's to stop me from marrying it too?   Oh, wait... this is the part where I was gonna call you a dumbass.  This is the stupidest, most flawed argument there is in favor of banning gay marriages.  First, a dog/table can't sign a contract, and if they did, it wouldn't be valid because they don't have legal status as US citizens.  Secondly, there is no slippery slope argument.  If there were, then people would have started marrying chairs as soon as marriages of any sort came around.  As for marriages involving more then two people, I don't condemn or accept that, simply because I have no good arguments either way.   Point 5:  Or perhaps I could just marry everything I mentioned, and get huge tax benefits from having such a large family.  Damn!  Your right!  Two women  could  get married just for the benifits.   But wait!  don't straight couples do that all the time???   Point 6:  Don't forget as well that to allow homosexuals to get married would place a tremendous burden on businesses, insurance companies, and the general public for having to support such as high-risk lifestyle. Gays don't often see their 40th birthday and would undoubtedly place horrible financial stress on America. If you were a business owner, would you want to give benefits to an employee who was a drug user, knowing that your company would pay for his bad choices? If so, then I doubt you will prosper in the business world.  You are taling out your ass again.  Would you care to cite ANY SOURCE that says gays don't often live to 40?  High risk is also a stereotype.  Sure there are some that live a high risk lifestyle, but 1) they can be insured with or without marriage, you don't know what the hell your talking about, and 2) there are plenty of high-risk straights.    Closing jackassery:  Homosexuals shouldn't be allowed to marry. I don't hate them, but I do think that their lifestyle shouldn't be condoned or protected, for as I have proven, it is detrimental to society. God loves the homosexuals, and therefore so should I. However, I am not supposed to support and encourage their self-destruction. They have chosen suicide by lifestyle, and I can't condone that. I can, however, love them like Christ did.  You don't hate them (or so you claim), but you are perfectly happy to opress.  Thats like saying,  "I don't  hate  blacks, but they aren't people like you and me.  We can oppress them however we want.  We don't have to condone mixed-race marriages, cus, well, thats totally wrong" .  [Nick: that was purely satirizing this jackass, and does not represent the opinion of anyone at this blog, nor (so I don't get sued for libel --lol-) the opinion of the commenter (unless it is, I don't actually know).]   You have proven nothing.  You have merely spouted lies and illogical statement out of every orfice.  "Suicide by lifestyle" is another little bit of stereotyping and illogic.  If you truly loved them, you wouldn't opress them.  Christ did not write the Bible, so I can just about guarantee you don't know what the hell he thought about the whole thing.  ---  I feel that I did an inadequate job with that, so I may have to bring Arif or M. Aby in as a guest to do a better job.  Be less of a jackass, Nick

      Very few of you, I'm sure, even knew that an amendment to the constitution to ban same-sex marriages was scheduled to be voted on in the senate today.  I've known for a month, but not many have, because it has gotten near zero news coverage.  Even today, the Star Tribune (the local paper here) had merely a tiny article that was stuffed back in A4.  Fortunately, the amendment was defeated 58 to 50.  The House is scheduled to vote on the same thing next week.  In bad news, Virginia has passed a law that makes it very near impossible for same-sex partners to have contracts (like wills or child custody) with each other that heterosexual couples take for granted.  Today is a sad day for human rights.

      Here is a sample of Fanatical Apathy; the real thing is  urlLink here :  Raising the Tone  From Reuters:  Cheney, annoyed at Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, had hurled the "F-word" at Leahy during a conversation on the Senate floor in Washington on Tuesday.   ...Cheney had ripped into Leahy for his criticism this week of suspected war profiteering in Iraq by Halliburton, the oil services company that Cheney once ran.   Cheney said on Friday he had no regrets about what he said.   Cheney told Fox News, "I expressed myself rather forcefully, felt better after I had done it."  -------------------------------------------------------------  So do I! I feel much, much better. Four years ago, when Bush and Cheney were promising to "raise the tone" in Washington, I had high hopes. But except for Bush calling a NY Times reporter a "major league asshole," until this week the world of politics was still full of false politesse and "diplomatic" doubletalk. Just think of how much more ennobled American political history would've been if the voices of years gone by had possessed the courage, directness, and honesty of George and Dick:   "December 7, 1941, a day that will live in being really completely fucked up."  "These are the times that try men's souls, and the British can lick my balls."  "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in and bone the South right up the ass."  "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that motherfucking wall."   There. Isn't that better? I feel better. You can write your own (in the Comments below, naturally).   A new day is dawning. Now that Mr. Cheney has come right out and told the loyal opposition what's on his mind, we can finally stop pussyfooting when it comes to our international relationships. We can come right out and say it: We can tell France and Germany to fuck off! We can tell the United Nations to kiss our ass! We can tell the entire world that they're a bunch of stupid ass-licking shitheads, and if they don't like what we're doing, they can go fuck themselves! We can tell 'em that.  Er... again.

      The ICJ (world court) ruled against Israel today, declaring the Apartheid Wall illegal by international law ( urlLink link ).  Israel's policy has now been challenged and found illegal in a legal court, and if Israel does not comply, it will show that Palestinian militant groups have been right the whole time, and geurilla warfare is the only way to throw off the opression of the Israeli occupying forces.

      I'm back, and some very interesting things have happened since I last posted, but I'm not going to bother with them.  In fact, I am going to ignore the past few days, including certain comments, which certain parties handled well enough, and without certain phrases that I would have been forced to include.

      apperently the blog has suffered in my abscence, and so, due in part to Eric practically begging me to bring the life back to this place (ha!), here i am!  ...with nothing to say...  on the note of my "riddle of the day" section, i apologize for not changing it in...um...like 3 weeks. and its sorta sad. i'll get on it once nick gets on so he can help me, me being HTML illiterate.  I JUST GOT MENTHOL ON MY EYE!!!!!!!! ARGH!  sorry. *cough*  so, folks, in another few days i may, once again, be abscent. i appear to be moving within the week. no, i didnt know either. me dad brought me by an apartment and said "we're moving." and that was that.  and should i not write by the 14th of july, know in advance that i will not be writing again probably until august 8th, due to the fact that i will be out of town. but if i can find a way to get online, i definatley will.  so, how was my trip to pennsilvania, you ask? lets not talk about it.  i apologize for this entry being utterly pointless. i just wanted to make it clear that i have not, in fact, died.  later days, folks.  Cheers, Cassie

      first to outline my points so i dont forget 1. overall odd smell 2. far to many obese individuals 3. subpar public restrooms (and a few surprising exceptions)  my friends, i have returned from the far off wilds of the wisconsin dells and i have this to say: wisconsin dells, like most of wisconsin is made purely for the enjoyment of fat people. the first thing i noticed when i entered the dells, for the first time in several years, was that it was things that required little of no physical movement, such as, a shitload of restaurants (none healthy), minigolf, and other attractions that feature sitting down and eating. as i stood at the top of a hill in downtown dells, i noticed something, i was slowly being hypnotized by the jiggling of thousands of overweight torsos (and there overweight offspring). overall one could barely make his or her way down an avenue without being overcome with nausea brought on by the spherical masses of lard waddling down the street beside them.  secondly, wisconsin possesed the smell of the parkinglot behind a mcdonalds. i believe it has to do with the extreme quantities of lard present in both settings. so to conclude this subject, if you blindfolded me i could not tell the difference between the smell of the dells (sweaty overweight people exiting their fudge shoppes and candy stores), and the pungent odor of the rear side of a mcdonalds eatery (exhaust, grease, and people)  finally, where there are obese people there are disgusting restrooms. one the floor of most bathrooms there was some sort of standing liquid present. one can only fathom what sort of horrors the slush of fluids contains. from the presense of the horrible liquid one can assume only one thing, they didnt bother to aim at the urinal so they must not have bothered to wash their hands. for the germophobe, like me the thought of unwashed hands can make your blood run cold. anything that a person may have touched was, in my mind, a biohazard. but by breathing only when necessary, using paper towels to touch everything(including the papertowel dispencer), and not looking at the floor or facilities (toilet, urinal, etc) i managed to survive the human bacteria festaval which was the public restrooms. altho it wasnt all bad there were several shocking exceptions to the rule, a diamond in the rough, surprisingly the local dinery Denny's had acceptable restrooms, with what could be classified as minor puddles, infared faucets and hand driers, and most importantly a push door. the second of the dynamic duo, was a highway reststop. absolutly imaculate, no puddles, no touch systems on all things, and best of all no disgusting door on the exit. truely gods restroom.  overall, if you find obeseness as disgusting as i do and you prefer air that isnt tainted with lard, i advise staying in minnesota

      Well, CONvegence was great.  I ended up playing some games, including Monopoly, chess, and Munchkin, Munchkin Fu, and Space Munchkin, all of which I recommend to anyone.  I also got to play some Soviet style DDR (the real communist party) and watch some anime.  This is a pathetically small bit of text for a 48 hour party, but oh well.

      Well, it seems that things at AMC get more complicated as time passes.  Today we had three groups of people at the box office who had bought tickets online, and could now not pick them up.  One old woman was yelling at our manager because she couldn't retrieve hers.  When you pre-pay online, you have to use your credit card to pick them up, and she didn't seem to understand this.  This other guy came out and complained about the movie having not started, so I radioed the projectionist, and he said he'd get right on it.  The guy came out again  five minutes later, and I told him that the projectionist was working on it.  Well, he actually followed me through the key-coded door into the concessions area when I went to grab the radio, insisting on GOING UPSTAIRS TO TALK TO THE PROJECTIONIST.  I radioed the manager and asked her to come down.  In the 30 seconds it took her to come down the stairs, he made me call her twice more, then he TOOK THE RADIO AWAY FROM ME AND STARTED YELLING INTO IT.  There was no way I was gonna tell him that he had to push the button to send.  I was able to catch Chronicals of Riddick.  Wasn't too bad.  Ah... CONvergence is this weekend at the hotel that used to be the Radisson South in Bloomington.  It would be cool if some of you that I know showed up.  Email me if ur gonna.  You don't need to pay unless ur gonna go to the panels.  For free there should be plenty of party rooms with food, DDR, and other stuff.  Good times.  Oh yeah: I think you would be hard pressed to find anyone there who isn't liberal, so thats a huge plus in my book.  Free Palestine!!! Oh... finally, I got an email of great importance, so I have saved it as a web page  urlLink here.

      i may have posted this and it may or may not have worked, if not here it is, if so you get double the eric  the day started poorly when i was forced to awake at SIX FUCKIN O'CLOCK where i proceeded to teh dentist who felt the need to floss very agressively with me and my gums, later in teh appointment they found a loose brace {i bet it is from over agressive flossing} so i was sent to the second best place in the world, the orthodontist office. where it was glued back on {later the taste of the glue would interfere with the enjoyment of a perfectly good hamburger}  on the positive side i cashed my pay check and am now $109.86 richer. and also i had my ipod repaired (not as much had it repaired as had my stupid mistake shown to me {i also found that the saying "you learn somthing new everyday" is flawed and should be "you have you raging stupidity pointed out everyday"})  wow parenthesis in parenthesis im impressed with my self  so overall the day has been 3 out of 12  also i continued my streak of over 15 1/2 years without a single cavity  well fireworks anyone? bye

      I just realized that I'm the only one here who regularily uses puctuation and capitalization.  Huh.  Today is July 1st, a fact of which I was notified at 12.01 this morning.  What this means, I don't know.  However, what I do know is that Iraq is not sovereign, as it doesn't even fit the dictionary definition.
