       Hey, life. I am kinda sceptical about this whole talking to myself on the internet thing, it just doesn't seem like something I would do...But hell, I have one life, so I might as well try everything once. Just so anyone who views this knows, I am a 17 year old junior in High School, I play football, basketball, track, and golf (I am a starter on all teams), and I love hanging out and hooking up (what's new, right?). Any-hoo, today was a pretty weird day. It started like a usual day, getting a ride with my mom to school cuz my licsense is legally suspended. Going to first period was nothing new, but it was what happened afterwards that really kinda upset me. For about the past two weeks, I have been helping out a friend (who is a girl, just for clarification), get a guy that she really liked. Well she finally got him, and I like to think it was me that got her the guy. She was scared, and I gave her confidence in making the first move. She didn't want to hurt friends, so I went and told the friends just how the girl felt so that they wouldn't get in a fight over him. She asked me every night what to talk about and every night she told me just how much she liked him. Getting back to the point, she walked up and told me she finally asked him out and he said yes. The part that really hit me was that it was then that I realized, How can I get her a boyfriend, yet I can't even tell the girl that I like that I like her???I pretty much got those two people going out, and yet I can't get a girlfriend, I can't tell the girl I like that I like her, and I can't even manage my own life, but yet I helped my friend get her life in better shape. How is that????If you have an answer or an opinion, post back please.

      Ok, so just to sum up a couple of things, if you are reading this BEWARE! I am going to experiment. I am going to attempt (key word, a-t-t-e-m-p-t) to just sometimes take a step back and look at what all I am doing in life and what-not. Read it or not, please post a comment afterwards so I don't go insane thinking I am talking to myself. I ask for your opinions, your comments, or just a good ole Hey, just because you have nothing better to do. Anyways, on with the blogging. (I guess it is blogging, sounds kinda funny to me.)
