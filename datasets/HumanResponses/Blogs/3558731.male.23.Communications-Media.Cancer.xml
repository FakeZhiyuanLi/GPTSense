       This is a story that I wanted to pen for the paper ever since I moved to Jaipur from Bangalore. My magazine writing teacher, an out-of-this-world personality, put me through to this story. It finally ran in Sunday's edition of  Hindustan Times  in Jaipur. She can be viewed on www.kiranontheweb.com:    A few years back she did not step out of home beyond six the evening. That is, well, history now. Today, she feels that showing her cleavage is “normal”. This is the story of the metamorphosis of Kiran Rathod, originally from a conservative family in Jaipur, into a world where oomph and the come-hither look form essential survival instincts. The girl from your city is, arguably, the queen of Tamil cinema today.  After a brief presence on screen with Yaadein and a Coca-Cola commercial, it was a chance encounter with AVM Limited, one of the oldest Tamil film production houses, that sent her neckline plunging as she forayed down south. She was launched in the mega hit Gemini and it brought her an instant award for the best debutante in the 2002 Cinema Express Awards.  “Showing the cleavage is not vulgar,” she says. “I think exposing to an extent is normal and I know my limits,” insists Rathod, who deflated the notion that most films down south are mainly exaggerated frames of sexuality. “I also acted in Anbesivam with Kamal Hasan and it was critically acclaimed,” she adds.   Rathod has performed in nearly 15 films, three of them are in Telugu and one in Malayalam; the rest are in Tamil. She dabbles in Tamil but her voice is still dubbed by a single lady for all her films. “I think it is the glamour feel to me that has clicked here. All my roles have had that feel,” Rathod says.  When Rathod decided that she would move to the south, a land most here associate with the loincloth-donning and marble-mouthed people, her family debated its implications. Her father strongly opposed the idea. “We were concerned about our social standing initially and her lifestyle. People did not say anything explicitly to us but it was, nonetheless, odd. But we have adjusted now,” says her mother Anita Rathod, currently with her in Mumbai. “She was adamant about it. Moreover, there is more vulgarity in films being produced from Mumbai,” she adds.  C-Scheme is still home and so is the rest of the city. But, firmly entrenched there, Rathod wants to continue to “rule” the Tamil cinema industry for another five years. “That is why I am now looking for more performance-oriented roles,” she says. “I do not want to be a showpiece,” Rathod adds.

      Here is the  urlLink link  to a picture I came across on a photoblog by Hossein Derakhshan, an Iranian expat in North America. The picture portrays the oddities an outsider to the Islamic Republic might experience. It shows mannequins at a store with headscarves on them. Moreover, their heads are sliced because of "Islamic laws that prohibit making identical statues to humans". Can't wait to get to Iran!

      If only we were more serious about tapping the enormous goodwill that Indian films, mainly Bollywood, have generated in West and Central Asia. I was reading  urlLink a piece  on BBC on how the filming of "The Rising" has bowled over Aychi, a tiny village in Tajikistan. The reporters say that many locals can sing numbers from Hindi films without knowing their meaning. It's like me singing hits of Fairouz or the Gipsy Kings.  Stakeholders, especially the Ministry for External Affairs, should exploit this "weapon of mass attraction". In a world full of terror diatribe and skewed priorities, films, music and the arts will surely give us a breather.   Even American policy makers have realised that much of America's goodwill, whatever little it has left, comes from Hollywood and its enormously popular pop culture worldwide. Books, songs and films out of America have inspired so many worldwide. It is a pity that their power is still neglected.

       I am still trying to convince myself that I turned 23 yesterday. Sometimes I wish I could freeze the ageing process... Anyway, while I do a little bit of introspection, here is a piece I did on a  kutta mandi  in Jaipur:   It was her second bidi in five minutes. Roop pulled them out of a packet carefully tucked inside her floral blouse. “Why do you bother us,” she yelled in a hoarse voice when she realised that a reporter was in their midst. “Let us live in peace.” With a yellow-striped dupatta that hid most of her features other than a heavily disfigured nose, she came across as an intimidating personality.  Nearby, an emaciated Doberman sniffed at an empty milk packet. Puppies, their eyes hardly open, wailed from pits where they were stocked for potential customers. And more dogs, many of them disease-stricken, were chained to their cots – waiting to be sold off. There must have been more than fifty dogs at the camp.  A member of a nomadic tribe from Haryana but based in Jaipur for 10 years now, Roop and her family members have been selling dogs, some of which, they claim, are pedigree. The tribe camps on Jhotwara Road and their hutments are known to locals as Kutta Mandi, a place for dogs at dirt-cheap prices. “We are poor and uneducated. This is the only way we can feed ourselves,” said a taciturn Arjun, the leader of the gang. A mongrel will sell for as low as Rs 100 but the price of a “pure” German Shepherd can go up to Rs 1,500. No papers are produced here to prove the pedigree.  When this reporter first walked in, the tribe members shoved a photo album that contained pictures of their dogs – all healthy ones – on a leash. “What would you like,” asked Arjun, sensing a buyer. “A Doberman or a Boxer? Or a Pomerian?” The tribe claims that they buy the dogs for as low as Rs 50 and look after them but animal rights organisations tell a different story.  “These people have to struggle to feed themselves. How do you expect them to look after the dogs,” said Rakhee Sharma, who works with Help In Suffering (HIS). “Most of these dogs are sick and end up dying there only. A stray dog can at least feed itself but not these dogs,” she added.  Controversy has long hounded the tribe, who have also been accused of stealing the dogs. “Many of my friends from C Scheme say that they steal pups,” said Sujeet Sharma, a German Shepherd owner. “They sure do not deal in pedigree dogs. They pass off mongrels as pure bred ones,” he added.  But that does not bother Arjun and his kin. “Go and write that we deal in stolen dogs,” he shouted, in unison with other members of the tribe.

       I wish people were a little more serious and dedicated to languages. Here is a piece I wrote for  urlLink Chaya , a bilingual (English and Hindi) magazine that my friends from the American Institute of Indian Studies and me put out. It is straight from the heart, this piece on the English language and me:   It never was my birthright. Neither was it my mother tongue. But fate would have it that I would be born in a former British colony, one that was in many ways colonised to the soul, and that my parents would be affluent enough to send me to an English-medium school.  Circumstance has made the English language inseparable from me. It has intimately bonded the two of us. But am I less of an Indian if I choose to pray in English and not Bengali—my mother tongue? Does it make me a foreigner that I penned my first love letter in English? And would I feel more at home in Pembrokeshire than in Jaipur, just because most of the books on my shelf are in English? I think not.  A language, like one’s faith, must be a personal choice; like faith, it is unfortunately also a platform for prejudice. Nothing hurts me more than to see “privileged” English-speaking Indians denigrate vernacular languages.  Lately, many young Indians have begun looking at accented-English speakers as “cool”, as the guys who are “in”. This attitude is especially flawed and offensive since for most of these speakers the language remains largely a professional acquisition; although they speak the language, many of them have not even sampled the rich body of Indian writing in English.  English is shaped by its daily usage in the mushrooming nouveau-riche corporate offices of India’s large cities, and is deemed only a passport to professional and financial stardom. English is treated impersonally and abused, learnt not for the love of the language but for the financial gain it entails. Worse, many of these English speakers are no longer comfortable reading and writing in their mother tongue, whatever that may be.  How many students actually “choose” to study English Literature at universities in India? Only a handful. And not only English—other language and literature courses as well are calling out for attention, with only uninterested and apathetic students on their rolls. On most students’ lists of priorities, these courses appear far below other, more “career-oriented” subjects; in India, the Humanities have always been overshadowed by scientific and engineering programmes.  Few youngsters are in love with languages today. How many, for instance, would care to find out the various words from South Asian languages that have been officially included in the English language? And how many are interested in the etymology of any of the words that they use daily? For them language is still, unfortunately, only a survival kit.  As a journalist I use English as more than a mere instrument or simple medium of communication. All my ideas and expressions stem from this language. It has been my childhood friend and is now my life partner. Nothing gives me such a thrill as browsing through a list of unknown words, or delineating the nuances of a set of synonyms.  English words still hold a certain magic — one I have yet to fully discover — and they have made me the writer I am today. What I admire in English is the way it continues to grow on me. As much as I would now feel orphaned, unable to share anything in my heart without this language, my attachment to it can only grow stronger with the passage of time. English remains in my heart, embedded in myself, irreplaceable.

       Greetings from Bangalore! Am here for my reunion and, quite obviously, I have had loads of fun getting together with my friends and catching up with each other's lives. Many have already decided that they would no longer be associated with journalism per se in another five years from now! Not me! Anyway, here is a piece I did on a premiere of a Rajasthani film "Oji Re Deewana":   It was almost as if they were drugged on her. Anaesthetised from their daily woes, the crowd's whistles refused to die down till Neelu danced on the stage. The worn-out speakers at Minerva were belting the title track from her latest and 46th film, Oji Re Deewana. And many from the audience, which comprised largely of daily wage labourers, trooped into the aisle for a quick boogie. It was utopia in a ramshackle hall.  Some even walked up to the stage and handed over cash to her. Even babies were not spared. They kept coming in one after the other into Neelu's arms. The leading actress of Rajasthan's cinema industry, and ageing some might add, seemed their best bet for a ticket to fantasy land.  Vinod Kumar, who works at a dhaba, took an off on Friday to see Neelu's newly released film. "She fights very well on the screen and her dances are also enjoyable," said Kumar, thoroughly enjoying himself. Asked to recollect his favourite dialogue, Kumar replied, "Tu meri payr ki jooti hain". That is what Neelu had in store for Billa, a notorious screen character, in one of her films.  In one of the scenes from her latest film, Neelu stands towering and stern like a deity. Her reel husband is sobbing on his knees. But a moment later, the two hug and begin sobbing incessantly. That is why the actress, fans said, is a treat to watch on screen. She switches with ease between busting villains and weeping her heart out. Or even performing comic roles, they added.  "She embodies a true Rajasthani woman. There is no vulgarity in her films," said Waqueela, one amongst the audience. "She does bold roles and has a good hold on rural aspects of Rajasthan," said Suresh Khandal, the still photographer for the film. "She is Rajasthan's Sridevi," he added.  Decked in heavy gold and a blue sari, Neelam spent much of Friday shuttling and dancing between two halls where her film was being screened. "Artistes do not have any age," she said, rubbishing criticism that she is too old for limelight on celluloid. "I made my debut in 1982 when I was 11 years old. And with the love and blessings of my well-wishers, I am still going strong," she added.

       I always had a real soft corner for Afghanistan because of all the trauma it has been through and also for its exceedingly beautiful and warm people. So, when I heard that leaders of the Scout Movement would be in Jaipur, I knew I had to speak to them. Here is the article that ran in Hindustan Times:   Abdul Rauf Saboor stretches his arms wide open and with a gleam in his eyes, he responds, “Thoooo much happy!” It probably is a tempered reaction from someone who has just resumed doing what he loves most after a gap of more than two decades.  Saboor, here for a scouting management workshop, was passionately involved in the Scout Movement in Afghanistan, which began in 1931. Fearing an imminent Russian invasion his work came to a standstill in 1978. The Soviets eventually trooped in a year later. “Because they were not a member of the movement, they gave it the name of policemen,” he says in broken English. “After that because of the war and the Taliban, we could not continue our work,” he adds.  Since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Saboor is rediscovering his lost love. Only that he now has the added responsibility of ensuring that the movement regains its lost stature. Saboor is the director of the Afghan Scouts, under the Ministry of Education, and has a fiercely daunting task on his hands. “We have to start from zero,” he says. “Even the government does not have any idea about the movement,” he adds.  It does not have an office and even the uniforms of the delegates are privately made. But the early signs of its growth are showing. The movement has reached 18 of Afghanistan’s 32 provinces. “We will move out as the security situation improves,” says his friend and scout leader Gul Ahmed Mustafa Pure.  There are presently 22,650 members in the movement, of which an encouraging 7,000 are girls. Their activities mostly include maintaining schools, ensuring that they are kept clean and that drinking water is easily available. But with no support from the government, the leaders are paid just about 2,000 Afghani rupees each month. “The director of the Asia Pacific region visited us in July this and said that they would help us,” says Saboor, who like his friend made a living out of teaching all these years.  The two could pass for any other Afghan. They speak English haltingly and are crazy about Hindi films. “I love Vinod Khanna in Rajput. Each Afghan family has hundreds of Hindi film CDs,” says Saboor. And if you ask him if he likes India, he replies with a stare, “Why not?”  The two have big plans for promoting the movement in their country and building a better Afghanistan. “Boys and girls are equal in our movement,” says Pure. “We now want to use the youngsters in developing Afghanistan into a united and beautiful country,” he adds.

       Here is a piece I wrote on two leading cardiologists who were in Jaipur for a workshop. They work at Chaim Sheba Medical Center, the largest hospital in West Asia and had some interesting insights into heart care and the road ahead:    Being at the forefront of preventive cardiology and coronary care is not their only claim to fame. Michael Schechter and Y Har-Zahav also work at the biggest hospital in West Asia. In fact, the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv is like a “monster”, as Schechter would say. A 3,000-bed hospital, it also has a five star hotel and shopping malls within its premises. “It’s like a city,” Schechter said.  Recently in Jaipur for an Indo-Israeli workshop on cardiology, the two doctors are the first from Israel to travel to India for an exchange at a professional level. Schechter is a leading researcher on how to accurately predict heart attacks and undo the damage done to the endothelium. Whereas, Har-Zahav specialises in performing angioplasties and angiographies on patients with a transplanted heart.  Currently, using high resolution ultrasound probes it is now possible to observe closely the damage done to the endothelium and predict “very precisely” coronary attacks. “We are now working on finding exactly what medicines and facilities can stop and undo the progress of the disease,” said Schechter.  “Next, we want to begin working on small machines, like use a PDA and wave light, to measure the endothelial function. This will enable us to take the set up to every home and benefit the people,” he added. Contrary to what most would believe, a check up on this costs just about $ 100 dollars. “Indians do deserve much better medical services at lower costs,” he said.  Excited about coming to India, the two doctors said that the two countries could learn a lot from each other. “India could benefit from Israel’s developed emergency care services and we could use India’s traditional herbs for cardiac rehabilitation,” added Schechter. Asked if people in the region suffered more from cardiac problems because of the incessant violence, the doctor acknowledged that it did stress the people. “When Iraq launched scud missiles at Tel Aviv during the first Gulf War, studies found that heart attacks had gone up by three times,” he replied.   “But often the media exaggerates the sporadic violence in the region. It just happens in pockets and we lead ordinary lives,” Schechter added. Also the chief cardiologist of the Israeli Red Cross Society, he added that cooperation with Arab doctors was also active at their hospital. “I am a firm believer in people-to-people contacts and as a doctor I treat all my patients, irrespective of their politics, as human beings,” he said.

       Here is a profile I wrote recently for the paper:   If he were married, Sheoram Yadav’s grandchildren could have taught him his school lessons today. Almost 70 years old, Sheoram has been struggling without a break since 1969 to clear the secondary school exam. He claims that his slow handwriting betrays him each time. “It has always been like this for me,” Sheoram says.  But others nearby inform that he concentrates too much on the one subject that fails him that he trips on another the next time. In 1995, he had made it but for mathematics. “I failed in it in my supplementary paper. It is one subject I dread,” he adds.  However, his determination seems to have only strengthened with each failed attempt. “I want to pass on my own, without adopting any unfair means or asking the authorities for grace,” says Sheoram, who appears as a private candidate from the Government Higher Secondary School in Tasing village.  Till he makes it, Sheoram has vowed to remain a bachelor. “You can’t study after marriage,” he says. Instead, it is squalor and solitude that keep him company. Having sold off most of his land to finance his studies, he lives in a dilapidated haveli. He has leased out his remaining land and has a few cattle to support him. If you ask him why he is so obdurate, he will reply, “It is education that distinguishes animals from humans.”  But time seems to be running out for Sheoram, a resident of Khori village in the Alwar district. Despite his imposing frame, he is frail with a voice that quivers and eyes that incessantly water. Hard of hearing, speaking to him means yelling into his ears and, at times, still failing. He comes across as a quirky character, one that would dovetail with ease in Malgudi Days.   Some claim that he is a celebrity of the Behror tehsil but closer home he is a laughing stock of the villagers. “We have asked him so many times to give up but like a senseless person he doesn’t,” says Shriram Yadav, one of his distant cousins. His study-cum-bedroom is dingy and dusty. Filled with rat-eaten and pale books, an oil lamp hangs by his bedside. He spends most of his day studying his updated set of books, reading newspapers and strolling in the village.   His results are due in another few weeks and villagers are hoping, like before, that he will finally make it. They prod him to throw a party if he does but Sheoram quips, “The government should finance my party because I have spent so much trying to pass the exam.” Sheoram claims that he spends nearly Rs 400 annually to achieve his elusive dream. He isn’t too optimistic of clearing the hurdle even this time but his grit is intact. “If I lose my courage, I would rather die,” he says.

      Being a scribe, I couldn't help but put that as the title of my debut on Blogger.com! Am a staff writer with Hindustan Times in Jaipur and this blog will offer a glimpse of my online and hopefully real life happenings.  This place will give you thoughts on my interests - reading non-fiction, writing, photography, jazz and world music, languages and films. Also Islam and West Asia, primarily contemporary Iran - its politics and culture.  It will also let you read some of my stuff that I work on for the paper. Our edition is still not online... lol!  Cheers.

      For the last two days, we have had a monsoon cloud cover in Jaipur. Nothing like the ones in Assam or the Western Ghats, still, it has been such a relief from the searing heat and humidity for several days earlier. Don't really know how long it wil persist but prayers, even official, are being sent incessantly. However, agriculture experts believe that the damage has already been done because the showers didn't arrive in time for the sowing season.

       A report for  Hindustan Times  that I wrote on how changing food habits in Rajasthan over the years has harmed the culture associated with the traditional food:   Here is some food for thought. Changing food habits, like your switch from coarse millet to leavened bread, has caused irreparable damage to Rajasthan’s cultural fabric. Many folk songs and proverbs associated with endemic food habits of the state are now lost for good because of its changing food platter.    An ongoing study being conducted by the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) is presently trying to document the cultural loss. “Rajasthan has traditionally been a coarse grain, such as millets and barley, consumer and that has been reflected in its history,” said Varsha Joshi, an IDS associate fellow. “But since the 1970s, intervention from the Centre propped up wheat cultivation that brought about a drastic shift in the food pattern,” she added.   Rice and wheat, Joshi informed, has been documented as a “privileged” commodity in many folk songs and proverbs. “We have songs that mention how a sweet porridge of wheat and jaggery is cooked only on special occasions like when a married lady returns to her brother,” said Joshi. “Now because of the changing food habits, for most of the youngsters these songs are a bygone. It is only the aged who remember them,” she added.  The study has also archived some samples of some folk songs for further reference. Though not easy to quantify, Joshi said that the loss was “immense”. “They were folk songs with a focus on food, ones that were sung at festivals. If you sit with three generations, the loss will show,” she added.   The thrust on cultivating wheat has also led to a decline in the “common resource property”. “At one point of time sangri was abundant. Today it is sold at Rs 100 for a kilogram,” said Joshi. Also phog, a rye-like seed, that was consumed with curd for its cooling properties. “Few in the urban areas have any idea of it,” she added.        Not only this. The changing food platter has also affected our health. “Because we no longer consume coarse grains but a fine variety of wheat, the level of micronutrients and fibre has gone down. Heart disorders, diabetes and gall bladder stones are becoming increasingly common,” said Joshi. “Now the doctors advise us to have a more fibrous diet,” she added.  Presently, work is on to document how certain food items were consumed because of its health benefits. Like rotis made out of millet that were always consumed with clarified butter and buttermilk to ease digestion. “What I am hinting at is that those in the centre framing policies must keep the region-specific contexts in mind,” said Joshi.   Here is an example of a folk song where a lady returns to her home on Holi and is treated to wheat porridge by her brother and to millet porridge by her mother:   “ Holi ke din chaar Bai ey begi ajaey pavani Mharo veer ranthavey bai ke lapsi Mhari bhavaj bajrio ko kheech raey .”   A sample of a proverb that states wheat is consumed by the merchant community and coarse grains by the farmers:   “ Kurra karsa khai, ghaun jimaey bania .”

       I did this story yesterday about a guy from Haryana, not an affluent family, who has designed a fascinating tea-making machine that also has an alarm function to give you tea when you want it! The  urlLink Grassroots Innovation Augmentation Network  has now taken it up to evolve a sleek and more efficient model out of the original design:     This success story does not have a happy beginning. Ashok Dhiman’s mother was unwell and it was up to him, the youngest in the family, to help her with all the household chores. And the first task of the day was to make tea for the family. That is where Dhiman, a resident of Panchkula in Haryana, put on his thinking cap. Why not have a machine that would make tea automatically, in the required quantity and at the required time?  He did exactly that. A former Industrial Training Institute (ITI) trainee, Dhiman created a machine in March last year that was designed to prepare tea, Indian style, in the required quantity. It even had an alarm function so that the user could get a steaming cup while in bed. The Grassroots Innovation Augmentation Network (GIAN, North) cell in Jaipur has now adopted the project to incubate it into a success story. The creation has already been patented.  A snazzier model, like your microwave, complete with push buttons and programmable logic control is expected to hit the market countrywide around Diwali this year. The prototype of this model is expected to be readied by the end of this month, a GIAN official informed. Priced at around Rs 6,000, it will require advanced booking. “The machine could be any executive’s office furniture. It will be designed in way so that you can keep it in your drawing room and not your backyard,” he said.  The first model was crude and had basic functions such as mixing the ingredients and bring the water to a lukewarm temperature. The second model corrected that and made it possible to boil the water and switch it off immediately, using sensors, to save electricity. The third model is expected to be entirely automatic and have a capacity for five cups of tea. “It will not take more than five minutes to do so,” the official claimed.   “We are expecting an enormous demand but we do not want to produce it en masse. We have received around 50 orders from Jaipur already,” he added. Only around 100 pieces are expected to be ready by Diwali.

      It is a historic case of abuse. Thanks to the apathy of both the government, and more importantly the people, original names of some streets in the Walled City have been bastardised over time to make more “convenient” names. Even official signboards have helped corrupt the names of the streets, say senior citizens from this part of the city  A victim of this blasphemy has been Sangakon Ka Rasta, located near Mahaveer Park. A JMC sign put up three years ago records it as Sango Ka Rasta but it was once named after the eminent Sangakon family. A Jain temple, built by the family, still exists on the same street. “The new name holds no relevance for someone like me,” said Gyan Chand Khinduka, a senior citizen.  Another prey is Govind Rajion Ka Rasta, near Chandpole Gate, which is today known as Govind Raoji Ka Rasta. For most it does not make a difference but to veterans of this street, like Hariballabh Koolwal, it robs them of their identity. “I was born here and all my life I have known it as Govind Rajion Ka Rasta,” says Koolwal. “It is not just my memories, it is our collective past that is being defaced,” he added.  Koolwal informed that the street was originally named after Govind Rajion clan from the Khandelwal Vaishya community, who had been hired by the royal family to handle its affairs. “Members from this community handled most of the royal family’s tasks and street were named after them in honour,” he said. “And since I belong to the same community I am attached to it,” he added.  The list does not end here. Uniara Raoji Ka Rasta, named in honour of a thakur from the Uniara district near Tonk, is now known as Uniaron Ka Rasta. “Today everyone wants a short cut. They are not bothered about these long names,” said Puranmal Sindhi, a fruit seller.  Senior citizens say that most of these streets had signboards with their original names but they were damaged over time. “When the boards were replaced, they did not even bother to ask people like us the correct name,” lamented Hariballabh Koolwal, who claimed that there are no government signboards on his street. “In another few years there will be no one alive to give the right information. The young are least bothered about it,” he added.

      Did you know that Israel's current defence chief Shaul Mofaz is Iranian by birth? He was born in Iran in 1948 and moved Israel in 1957. It would be interesting to keep a tab on his comments as the war of words (over nuclear weapons) between the two countries heats up.   Here is an extract from  urlLink BBC :  A few months ago a man born in Tehran was a guest on Israel Radio's Persian service.   The guest had spent his early childhood in Iran before coming to Israel and joining the army. And he is now Israel's defence minister.   What if Iran attacks, Shaul Mofaz was asked. The minister answered: "We will know how to defend ourselves."

      Despite Israel's cosmopolitan social composition, this BBC report claims that many in Israel did not take too well to the success of Sakhnin as it prepares to play in the UEFA Cup - the farthest that an Arab team has gone in Israeli history.  Excerpts:   The Jewish state watched in surprise in May as Sakhnin won the Israeli cup.   Sharon Mashdi has kept a close eye on Israel's reaction. He monitors racism in Israeli football for the New Israel Fund.   The Arab team's victory, he says, went down particularly badly with fans of Betar Jerusalem, a team known for its ties to Israel's right wing.  "After the cup final the Betar Jerusalem fans put an ad on the Internet about the death of Israeli football," he says.   "I think it's like what's happened in Israeli society - some percentage of the Jews don't like Arabs at all and don't want them here in this country."   Such is the political climate right now that few in Israel want to go all that far in backing the Arab team.   Sakhnin does not have its own stadium. And it has found it tough to get sponsors.   "This is the biggest problem of Sakhnin," says Goren of Haaretz.   "Jewish companies don't sponsor Sakhnin. No-one from the Jewish business community said: 'Let's take Sakhnin and make it a symbol for peace, for living together'.   "Sakhnin has succeeded in a professional way, but in a social way it's been a failure."   urlLink Read more...

      If Johnnie Walker were to look for an apt brand ambassador for its inspiring “Keep Walking” ad campaign, then they need look no further than Ramesh Bhai Thakur in Jaipur. Despite an amputated left leg, Thakur has constantly pushed the realm of what a physically challenged person like him could achieve.  With several races and marathons already under his belt, he, using a  urlLink Jaipur Foot , has just returned from a successful 32-kilometre trek up to Amarnath at a height of around 13,000 feet. But he did not tire there either. Now, Thakur is all set to enter the 2005 Limca Book of India Records (LBIR) as the fastest runner on a single artificial leg. He completes a 100-metre dash in little less than 19 seconds. An average human takes about 12 seconds to do that.  It was in 1982 that he fractured his leg in a train accident in Bharuch, where he was then based. The leg would not heal and the doctor insisted that it had to be amputated. “I was heartbroken and dejected,” said Thakur, who was in his late teens then. He moved to Jaipur to have a prosthetic limb fitted onto him. Luckily, he was employed by the Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti (BMVSS) when he managed to put a kaput sterilising machine back in order. Thakur had done a course from the Industrial Training Institute.  A technician with BMVSS now, he has earlier walked to Badrinath when he was part of a camp for fitting Jaipur Foot pieces in Rishikesh. “Then I thought why not Amarnath. If Shiva can call others, why not me,” he said. After a lot of negotiations, he managed to get a “fitness certificate” and set out for the arduous trek. “Often, I would leave my team members behind me. Some wanted to ride a horse but when they saw me, they would keep walking,” he added. Doctors at BMVSS claim that he is the first such case to have trekked up to Amarnath. “There was no pain or inconvenience,” he remarked.  Thakur has also been running regularly each morning at the SMS Stadium with a coach to train him. He has heard from the LBIR, acknowledging his extraordinary feat on the track. “Right now there is no entry in the category where my record stands at 19 seconds. Even if someone breaks it, I expect to improve on my performance and reduce the timing to 17 seconds by March in time for the 2005 edition,” Thakur said. But what is that does not let his spirits sag? “I want to show people like me that they are not inferior. I want to encourage them and support them,” he replied.

      John Kerry, John Edwards and Jaipur – The connection might seem vague in reality but in the unpredictable world of cyber crime the three fall into place. SurfControl, an American Internet security firm, on Thursday blew the lid off two phishing scams in the US that were soliciting funds from Internet users, claiming they would be used to finance the political campaign of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming US presidential election.  One of these sites,  urlLink www.yahoogoogle.biz , was found to be registered in Jaipur. Moments after the beans were spilt, these sites folded leaving cyber crime experts fumbling in the dark about their identity or the amount of money they could have amassed since they went online around the date of the Democratic Convention in Boston.  But why Jaipur of all places? In an email interview with  Hindustan Times , the SurfControl vice president Susan Larson wrote that many American spammers host their operations outside the US to circumvent the law there. “Moreover, certain countries, including India and Thailand, have become popular destinations because the overhead costs are considerably lower than in the US,” she said.  Because SurfControl’s primary responsibility is to identify and classify spam, the nature of the site’s work is still in the dark. For example, it is still unclear whether the site had any physical presence in this city and how many people were involved. There are reports that Kerry-Edwards Campaign did contact the US Department of Justice. Concerned authorities in Jaipur are clueless about any such event. Considering they had a presence in Jaipur, Larson mentioned that it is “likely that few, if any, of the funds were diverted to India”.  Each site has to be registered against a name and physical address. However, many choose to base their sites outside the US to exploit loopholes in the US CAN-SPAM law and other national laws that have no international provisions. So the possibility that the spammer had some fascination for Jaipur remains open because of his choice of city. Larson stressed that international cooperation is one of the keys to establish effective anti-spam and anti-phishing legislation.   (eom)   What is phishing?  Phishing attacks use 'spoofed' e-mails and fraudulent websites to fool recipients into divulging personal financial data such as credit card numbers and account usernames. By hijacking trusted brands, well-known banks, online retailers and credit card companies, phishers are able to convince up to 5% of recipients to respond to them. Once such private information is in their hands, these scamsters make purchases, withdrawals and the like on accounts of the unsuspecting users.

       Recently, I met the director of the  urlLink South Asian Cinema Foundation  and we spoke at great length about flims. The man, Lalit Mohan Joshi, said that Indian films (for many read as Bollywood) lack quality content and social relevance. He urged directors to pick up subjects that have an undercurrent of realism.   But again, the game is not won just by picking up such a subject. Talking about Girlfriend (a recent Bollywood film on lesbians), it was felt that sensitivity and subtlety are equally important. Here is the piece I wrote for the paper:   A failed attempt at acting in a Shyam Benegal film did not douse Lalit Mohan Joshi’s fascination for Indian films. “The seed did not die,” recollects Joshi. Gradually, over the years, that “seed” germinated into the South Asian Cinema Foundation (SACF), an organisation dedicated to portraying a “whole picture” of Indian cinema in the UK and elsewhere.  Formerly a journalist with the Hindi service of the BBC, Joshi says SACF seeks to correct the “myopic western perception of Indian cinema as either Satyajit Ray or rubbish”. Neither is it something “highbrow or elitist”. “We want to use cinema as a tool to empower the people, especially the South Asians in the UK,” he adds.   Co-founded in 2000 with Derek Malcolm,  The Guardian  film critic, SACF brings out an annual thematic journal on Indian cinema (the latest one is on Partition films) and holds regular events aimed at sensitising the UK to films that go beyond Bollywood – a term that many think encompasses the entire range of Indian films. Just like many here in India would associate English films produced outside the US as Hollywood productions.  And one of the films, also one of his personal favourites, that Joshi has tucked into his quiver is V Shantaram’s 1937 classic “Duniya Na Mane”. The film portrays a woman who is married to man as old as her father and how she struggles to change her fate. “We screened it and people were amazed to see a woman oppose the marriage without being very loud. Such a situation (as the plot) still exists amongst several South Asians in the UK,” says Joshi.  A far cry from the “socially relevant” films of yore, he feels that there is a “crisis of content and social relevance” in Indian films now. “Not that I am denying Bollywood its importance, but look at Mohabbatein. It features a gurukul in Wiltshire with students eating Pringles chips and girls in short skirts. Whom are they trying to fool,” Joshi asks. “Instead, cross-cultural films like Bend it Like Beckham are playing a much better role than nonsensical Bollywood films,” he adds.   Tracing the crisis to the 70’s, Joshi says that the crisis still continues with “declining” social values and directors being undermined by commercial forces. “Directors must take up socially relevant subjects. If Ram Gopal Varma decides to make a such a film, money would surely pour in,” Joshi says. With all his love and frustration for Indian films, he feels that Indian films and filmmakers are headed for a brighter tomorrow where regional films would also gain more importance. “There are many Shekhar Kapurs simmering in India,” Joshi adds.

       I had a chat with Jean-Marie Borzeix, the literary director at  urlLink Editions du Seuil  ( a noted French publishing house), and he some interesting points to mention about languages:   The noted Algerian writer, Kateb Yassin, was right when he said that the French language was a “war booty” that his countrymen would inherit from France once it became independent. Not surprisingly, over the years it these Francophone countries around the world that have enriched and embellished the language incessantly.  Paying tribute to them, Jean-Marie Borzeix, a linguistic expert and the literary director at Editions du Seuil, a noted publishing house in France, said that speakers from these countries play around with the language much more than the native speakers. “For them it is not an academic language. They invigorate it, invent new words and create something fresh,” he added. Borzeix was speaking on Friday at the Alliance Francaise in Jaipur on the occasion of the ongoing international Francophone festival.  Even the vibrant body of literature that they produce is now increasingly becoming de rigueur. “In some British and American universities, Francophone literature is taught more than French literature,” said Borzeix. The Francophone movement is essentially one that links culturally, now increasingly also politically and economically, the various French speaking countries worldwide. It was conceptualised during the period of decolonisation in Africa by Leopold Sedar Senghor, a noted French litterateur and the former president of Senegal.  “The language became not just a medium of exchange of words but also of ideas like democracy and human rights,” said Borzeix. “Today, France has changed its centralist policy and is encouraging it actively. It even is promoting the native languages,” he added. In a highly fluid and dynamic world of languages, attempts are being made to forge movements, similar to this, amongst the Spanish-speaking, Portuguese-speaking and even Turkish-speaking nations.  Taking a stand against “linguistic hegemony” of American English, Borzeix said that he was all for cultural and linguistic diversity. “English is a beautiful and powerful language but it cannot be imposed as the sole one,” he added. Borzeix, who has been travelling around India, was happy to note the ongoing work of translating French works to Bengali and vice-versa. “And the Tamils are producing a three-volume book on the history of French literature,” he informed.  But asked if the hegemony of the Academie Francaise, a conservative and traditional guardian of the French language, was a right thing, Borzeix replied that a balance was required between “linguistic heritage” and “intelligent creativity”. “At times, I cannot understand the French spoken by teenagers back home, and that is dangerous,” he said.
