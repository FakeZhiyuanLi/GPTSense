      It's 12:38 p.m.  We're done with school and the kids are playing with the girl I homeschool on Thursdays and Fridays. I'm checking my messages and pondering life. Sad news from another. On Monday, a woman from church whose has a daughter with whom my daughter plays, had her water break. The baby had problems and was delivered by emergency c-section. It was born with severe problems and hooked up to life support. The decision was made and the plug pulled. The little girl died and the burial will be tomorrow. The family is dealing well with it. There had been problems in the pregnancy. It's also helpful to have the gospel in your life at times like these. You know that you will be together again with your baby-it's not an end all to everything. However, it's also one of those major fears we (at least we women) have. A dear friend of mine had this happen four years ago. She gave birth to two twin daughters. One is brain damaged,but, the sweetest girl there is. The other lived two weeks. She's pregnant now with their first son. Their oldest is six-just three weeks older than Zoe. They love playing together, which is great, because we moms love chatting! lol (what, me?) She really is a source of inspiration for me, though,too.   On a lighter note, I've really got to find some ground cover roses. I've got a corner on the driveway where I'm putting them in. They are not easy to find, however. I think I know where I can look. I also need to find some cherries and apricots. I've located some local raw honey-I'm almost totally out-maybe two tablespoons left, if I'm lucky! I need to call on that. Okay-now I'm just thinking out loud here. Good think I'm thinking of a shopping list! lol

      Has it been a week since I've blogged?  Goodness, how time flies.  Anything happened since then? ummm, vacuum cleaner broke  beyond repair. I bought a new one today. We'll see how long this one lasts. We're thinking of ripping up the carpet and putting ceramic tile down. Easier to clean, classier look, etc. hmmmmm......... We got sod put down in our front yard last Thursday morning. I still have to decide on plants, flowers, etc. I'm still thinking about a moon garden-oooooh-how romantic!   ;) Father's Day was on Sunday. Poor Mark had to work, but, we still managed to give him a few gifts. hee hee Zoe HAD to get daddy an outfit. Funky shorts with lots of pockets and a matching shirt. Keegan got daddy a new drill. Mark and I had decided that our Mother's/Father's Day gifts would be a garage door opener. Now, if Mark can find the time to put it in! lol I had another new homeschooler call today and find out the ins and outs. I'm a contact person for this area and frequently help new homeschoolers get started in the what, where, how, etc. It's amazing, though not surprising, how many homeschoolers have 'joined the ranks' , so to speak. I just can't imagine sending my children into the mess of the public school system that exists today. This morning, Keegan asked me if there were any reasons why a person 'couldn't' homeschool. It took me awhile to think of one. Then, I remembered that a family out here had the mother die and the kids then went into the ps system. Every circumstance is really different. I homeschool another child on Thursdays and Fridays. Her mom is a divorced mom who refuses to subject her child to the ps system, so, she educates her before and after her work periods and I help out two days a week. I admire the dedication she has to still give her child the best she can.She makes sacrafices many aren't willing to make in order for this to happen. I really don't understand why so many are 'afraid' or say they don't have patience. It's so very different when it's your own child. We've grown so much as a family and really know each other. The kids support each other in their educational endeavors. Of course, not every day is an easy one-but, that's life. Most ays are easy and just plain fun. We take very few 'breaks' because my children simply don't want to.  I like blogging. It feels nice to say all this. I really have my firm opinions in many matters. lol oh, another thing happened. A friend on our city council called to let me know that there are two positions open on the Library advisory board. They are volunteer positions and only have one meeting a month. Since we are frequently there and I have a vested interest, I hope to get a position on the board. I had to turn in a letter of intent to the mayor last week. We'll see what happens! I don't know how long it will take.  Mal sehen!

      okay, I've time to chill out from something that upset me quite a bit,but,I'm getting back to automatic mode through prayer, pondering, and support (thanks ldfr!). On a brighter note, Mark and I had our 7th wedding anniversary yesterday. We actually celebrated on Saturday. We took the kids to see the new Harry Potter movie. Then, with a gift card in hand that arrived as we were leaving home (whew!), we feasted well at Red Lobster. After hanging out at Barnes & Noble ( okay, weird, but, we all love it!lol), we bought the kids a fun new outdoor toy (a Cosmic Wheel from Gart Sports-like a Green Machine)and then played mini-gold. The kids have been wanting to play at night to see all the lights. It was fun. Both kids got a hole-in-one. Our town needs a mini-gold spot. And, oy! do I think it's expensive! $22 for us to play. That's nuts! It was cheaper to see Harry Potter!Granted, it's the best mini-golf course around,but, still. That's just blatant price gouging. It's not like there is a huge overhead.  I still say we ought to build one out here.  Hmmmmmmm...............maybe I ought to look into something like that. Indoor for something year round. A family night-date night-good deal to rent it out for groups,etc.Have a nice private room so the kids do still do their school work and learn to work around the business as well. hmmm.... Of course, that does cut into travel time. Unless we make it only during the summer-outside-that leaves winter travel. hmm.......I don't know...... Good opportunity-if you want it,I suppose. eh?

      Yes, while I do indeed have my outer space moments, today I was justified. It was Homeschool day at the Clark Planetarium in Salt Lake today. We saw a great IMAX bug show and a fun cruise through the Solar System in 'Secret of the Cardboard Rocket' in the domed theatre.  It was the kids' first time to a planetarium. One of these days/years, I'm going to take them to the planetarium in London. They have cushy seats that lean back and turn into a Lazy-boy bed while you watch the universe. It's amazing.  Since Mark worked last night and will tonight, he couldn't go.So, we brought him astronaut space food to munch at work tonight. hee hee He put up the new pool while we were gone. What a guy! (although we're still heading down to our indoor city pool) The outdoor one is great for cooling down, but, I need to swim,too! We've been on field trips the past two days,so, tomorrow it's back to regular studies.  We've got a great math program the kids are really enjoying. I think I'll go snuggle Mark before he has to get up and we head down to the pool. Tschuss!

      It's nearly 9 p.m. and I'm tuckered! It's Home Education Week here in Utah-that means field trips and special things to do just for homeschoolers at cheaper (and free) prices. LOVE it! Today, we did a field trip to Salt Lake City's "This is the Place Heritage Park". It's a living pioneer park. We usually go at least once a year. We had a fun time. It wasn't until I got home that I realized the items I bought I left somewhere in the park. I called and, thank goodness, someone had found the bags and turned the items in. whew! After tomorrow's field trip, we'll go back and pick them up. I can't believe I did that. Oh,well..... After there, we had a picnic at one of my favorite parks ever-Liberty Park and stayed to play. 2.5 hours later, we headed home. We got home in time to get Mark up and ready for work. The kids and I snarfed a quick dinner and headed down to the pool as Mark left for work. *sigh* I love the water.  Tomorrow, we'll start even earlier for our next field trip. I think we're only going to do two trips this week. Two of the trips are better suited for older children and Friday-I'm not sure yet. Three trips to choose from, plus I have another child to think about then. hmmmmmmm................................................. Well, I think I'm going to disconnect and veg for an hour or so before dragging myself up to bed.........snzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........

      It's the Sabbath day once again. *whew!* Made it through another week. Thank you, Heavenly Father, for these Sundays to rest, renew, and remember our true purpose for being here.  :)  The day is only half through,but, I couldn't wait to get on here and put some thoughts into words.  A dear woman at church today shared her thoughts on gossip. I hate it. More people are hurt and humiliated by things that are no one's business at all. One of the reasons I prefer the company of men over woman, in general, is the gossip factor. Yuck!Yuck!Yuck! My children are too young to understand what this even means,but, it made me think of how to approach this to teach them. Well, this woman shared a General Conference talk (can't remember who gave it) and how another's name should be safe in our home.  Wa-La! Not only was that the perfect idea to teach my children, but, to remember myself when I'm tempted to let the tongue wag. 'Another person's name should be safe in our home'  I really like that. Sometimes the the touchiest concepts are most best taught by the simplest words and not the longest explanations.

      It's Saturday night, the kids are again getting ready for bed and dh is at work. Laundry is going, competing with the dishwasher.  And here I sit, thinking of all the things I busied myself with today.  You know, in this day of technology, we just can't get it all right all the time. After buying the cutest little boy outfit for a newborn, who was scheduled to arrive by induction, etc., I had to go and buy another outfit. Why? Because 'he' came out a 'she'! That's the second person I know that has experienced this 'surprise'.  It was a guess with my daughter. Everytime we had an ultrasound (three) she'd kick, kick, kick at the machine. All we got was pictures of her feet! lol With my son, well, let's just say there was no mistaking his gender. Until then, I had no idea that boys could have erections in utero. Of course, hubby just stood there and pronounced that "that's my boy!" with a grin bigger than the famed Cheshire cat. hee hee memories.......  I know why Kmart is going out of business. They are utter and complete-ok no name calling. But, duh!!!!!!!!!!! Let's just say I bought a $29.99 pool for the $19.99 going-out-of-business price and, FINally, paid the $19.99. *sigh*  We did find a good Greek eatery, though. That's what the kids wanted for lunch-they've been on a Greek kick lately (fine with me!) YUM!  Zoe lost her third tooth this morning. Her two front bottom teeth are coming in and it's amazing to see. My little girl! *sob*  Our town's pool reopened and we stayed in the water until the pool closed down this evening. I feel SO much better. Nothing like floating-although we did do some practice laps. I lost count how many times Keegan went flying off the high-dive. That little boy LOVes to throw himself off. I have fun watching the other swimmers around us freak out to watch the little guy go off "Lady! your son is going to fall! He'll drown!" and etc., etc. I actually had a teenage girl jump in the water and 'save' him. I had the hardest time not laughing. I was happy, really, for the courage of the girl. Keegan was trying to get away the entire time, yelling,"I want to swim!I want to swim!" hee hee   oh, all these disconnected thoughts. Maybe tomorrow I'll have more to say-and my brain will be more awake. At least our Father's Day shopping is done! *shhhh!*

      I like warmth,but, I'm not a big fan of HOT! Everyone around me loves it. bleh. At least it's dry. Humidity is worse than the dry heat. I love taking a shower and staying dry. A few weeks ago, we we're changing flights in Atlanta, Georgia. The walk from the plane to the airport-THROugh the gate ramp was stifling. That was still May. As we made our way to our next gate, we found it to be in the area of the airport where the air conditioning was being worked on. While the airport had huge fans, it was still quite 'muggy' inside. I'm glad we didn't have to wait too long. I'm about to take the kids over a friend's to sit and chat while they romp in the pool. They can't wait. Earlier they were begging to move to Germany.  I was chatting with a friend we'd recently visited in Germany at the time. She was asking us to come back asap and the kids were in my other ear begging to move there. So tempting. So incrediblely tempting. I guess I'm getting my pllbb! frustrations out right now. I planted flowers in planters on my porch stairs and at the front door. I want to make a moon garden. I need to look in one of my garden books to remind myself which flowers I'll need.Moon gardens are so pretty to look at. Time to throw the kids in the suburban and head.

      I did it. I joined the bloggers of the world! I've thought about it before, but, beats me why I haven't created my own blog before! So-welcome! You may take a peek in, if you dare, if you wish.   Hmmm...maybe I'll start with a quick round-up of my day to set the scene. It's Utah-I can see the sunset over the Great Salt Lake out my living room's bay window. It's gorgeous. Pinks and purples galore over the desert that today-feels like! It was 95 at 4:45 p.m. The kids and I were going to the pool after our two our sports day at the park with other homeschoolers,but, arrived to disappointment as the pool was closed for repairs. argh! We pretty much live there anyway,but, I'll dry out if I don't get back in the water. Fat is a GREAT flotation device!  Instead, we came home to a chess match. The kids took turns playing with me. Keegan is getting pretty good. It's getting harder to beat him. Zoe thinks it's funnier to get nabbed. She loves to play, but, she's more laid back about it. Keegan is more determined. Mark is, of course, at work.  The kids are getting ready for bed now and I better close to tuck them in. welcome and enjoy!
