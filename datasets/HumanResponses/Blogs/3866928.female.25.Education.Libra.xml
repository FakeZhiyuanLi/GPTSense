      This is my response to the readings "Closing the Digital Divide and the Achievement Gap."   To what extent do you see the achievement gap and digital divide as an issue in your classroom?  My district is mostly higher-income families with good support.  My school is a focus school for middle schoolers learning English, so we have a variety of students with a variety  of background knowledge.  It is challenging to have students from so many different abilities within one classroom, but it also is of benefit when mentoring is incorporated into the curriculum.  In terms of achievement gaps, I see several examples of students performing high and performing low in all race groups.  The lowest-performing tend to be students who are new to the country and don't want to be here & don't want to learn English.  These students are very hard to motivate because they miss their home countries so much & want to fail so they can go back.  I find that the best way to motivate these students is to create a positive and joyful environment for them to work in...the laughter and joy is contagious and they will usually join in with the learning.  As a stereotype, I hear that the Asian & East-Indian students perform the highest...but I can think of several Hispanic and Hmong students who are high-achieving as well.  I guess, in this kind of community, race may have some bearing...but it is not a deciding factor.  In terms of digital divide...I ask my students at the beginning of each year if they have access to a computer for word processing and internet.  Out of my 180 students, I usually have 5-10 that don't have regular access.  So, my students are pretty wired up.  They are also pretty savvy, for the most part, when it comes to using computers.  Many of them have websites, blogs, and skills in Power Point, Flash, and other software.  The students that don't have access to computers are given first dibs on the computers during classtime, and are also given access after school when needed.  I have not had any issues with these students completing their work at school.  I worked at a high-poverty middle school and it is completely different from where I work now.  Most students had reading levels below the 4th grade level, there were a lot of gang problems, and it was rare to find students with internet access.  Needless to say, working there and working in Cupertino is like night and day.  Everyday was a struggle just to get kids to bring a pencil to class...now my students bring a whole pack of pencils.   How do you think your students compare with other students in the Bay Area in regard to these two issues?  From what I hear from other teachers (I'm not real familiar with other Bay Area schools), Cupertino is a great district with lots of support.  I feel very supported there and do see high achieving students.  So, I would have to say that my students are very competitive and are in the upper ranks when considering the achievement gap and digital divide.   How will you address these issues in your classroom?  I have addressed some more minor gaps in my classroom by allowing students to use computers during class time and after school.  I have also been able to find people to donate working computers to families in the school so they could have a computer at home to use.  My school also has a Child Study Team that works out plans for students who are low achieving.  This involves the student, parent, counselor, principal, and all of the child's teachers working to gether to help the student be more successful in school.  I have seen this work for many students and really try encourage students towards improvement.  I am hoping to upgrade the hardware in my class soon so that our computers are more accessible (we currently only have my personal laptop in my classroom) to students.  We have iBook carts to use, but I'd like to have a computer consistently in my class, accessible to students, for searches and other projects that come up.

      I could incorporate digital video into my project in a variety of ways.  Some possibilities include having students create digi-vids of their portfolio work to present to the class ("How did you grow as an artist?").  They could also create digi-vids that relate to a particular content standard such as researching a time period or artist.  These videos could be included in my students online portfolios.  I could also use a digital video to introduce the project to my students ("Why do ePortfolios?").  Digital videos could be used in the classroom as discussion prompts, to convey information about the process or particular steps students will need to take, or to describe specific learning you would like to take place.  I am going to create a digital video that will introduce the concept of ePortfolios to my students.  It can be used to start a discussion on the importance of using ePortfolios as well.  I am also planning on posting this video on my project website.

      I really enjoyed the concept of adding enduring understandings to the curriculum alongside the objectives.  So often I have been focused on what I want my students to be able to  do  or  demonstrate  that I forget what overarching things I went them to understand in a meaningful way.  One enduring understanding that I would like my students to come away with is that learning is not just about grades, but is about developing and growing in a way that will make their life more fruitful.  This is why I want them to create ePortfolios...so they can be in control of their learning.  ePortfolios will push them to be introspective of who they are and how they are developing; they will set goals, create work, and reflect on their process.  For the engaged learning, I also loved the idea of "Question-Answer-Question."  So often we get too into telling students the answers before they have even asked the question.  Making sure that students are motivated to seek the answers is very significant.  By probing them to ask questions, it will pique their curiosity and interest in the learning.  Even beyond that, though, is that students should be connecting the answers they find with their prior knowledge and experience.  This should lead them to ask more questions, even after finding the initial answers.  I agreed with the idea that a teacher is having a stronger impact when students are so engaged in their learning that they continue asking questions.  I would like to incorporate some overarching questions into my project.  My website already has a banner with a road map image that says "Where are you going?"  Hopefully this question will probe students to consider who they are and where they want to go artistically in the class.  They can then set goals (both long term and short term as we move along in the class), research, create work, then reflect on what they made and their process.  The changing role of the teacher article already describes what I do most of the time in my class.  I rarely just lecture to my students.  I love posing questions and having them learn from each other or utilize the resources around them.  When students ask me a question, I rarely give them a straight answer.  I will instead ask, "Where could we find the answer to that?"  The student will then suggest some places and I will go with them (often) as they look for their answer.  Learning is so much better and more fun when you feel guided and supported as you follow your curiosity to find answers.  I am hoping that I can put together more resources for my students to utilize on our class website this year to serve as guides for my students as well.  I can build upon and expand my repertoire of teaching/learning styles by incorporating more resources for independent/small group learning in my classroom.  I really believe that the internet and certain software programs are of so much use today because there is so much information at your fingertips.  I would really like to utilize Inspiration to help my students create mind maps, brainstorms, and outlines to help them to organize their thoughts.  I am also hoping that the use of ePortfolios will help my students be more motivated and engaged in their learning because they will be in the drivers seat.  They will be setting goals for themselves and reflecting on their work, while I (and hopefully a parent) come alongside and dialogue with them as they take that journey.  This will really change the way I teach because it takes the eyes off of me and my expectations, and onto the student and his or her goals.

      My project will meet my students' learning styles and needs because it puts the goal setting, learning, creation, & reflection in the hands of the student.  I am hoping to find a good resources that helps students to identify what their learning styles are at the beginning of the course.  Armed with this knowledge about themselves, students can take an active role in their learning by setting goals for themselves, developing projects within course guidelines (that allow for some amount of choice that identifies with the individual student & their learning needs), then reflecting on their learning.  Throughout the process of the class, students will be able to develop according to Piaget's development stages.  I teach middle school students, who are in the  formal operational  stage; developing logical and systematic reasoning skills.  By having control over their goal setting, project development, and reflection, students will need to reason through not only their projects, but also their learning.  Students will address higher order thinking skills by pushing students to analyze, synthesize, and reflect on their work.  Rather than just coming into class and making projects, they will be pushed to consider their options, select the choice(s) that best meet their needs, implement their choices, explain the choices they have made, revise, and reflect on their work.  It pushes students to move beyond "making stuff" into being able to critically understand the visual language and make work that creatively expresses their ideas and emotions in an aesthetically pleasing way.  The use of online portfolios will assist students in this creative process.  This project will address the skills business and industry tell us are important in many ways.  Many of these skills are already embedded in course work.  Students will be required to generate ideas and make intelligent decisions that will best express their ideas or emotions.  Since all projects work with a visual language, students will learn how to see things in the mind's eye and will attempt to translate this into their work.  They will need to solve structural or procedural problems as they go about creating work in class.  I am hoping to begin the portfolio by having students identify their learning styles so they can have some control over how they work in class and can make choices to relate projects to their learning styles.  The portfolios will help students to step outside of their work and see the over-arching learning that is going on in this class.  The hardest element of project based learning for me to implement will probably be making real world connections.  I have strived to make connections between the arts and the real world for my students by studying art/crafts careers, looking at the visual language of the media and advertisers, and studying life-long hobbies.  I find that students, while they think art is fun, often think it is not usable in the real world.  I see how the online portfolios really relate to the other six dimensions of pbl, but am still trying to make real world connections with it.  I think the portfolio will make real world connections by teaching students how to effectively combine pictures and writing/reflections to describe themselves and their work.  Many professions (artists, teachers, etc.) require the making and keeping of portfolios to show clients or even to get jobs.  Teaching students to organize this information effectively and "sell themselves" will be of great use to them in the real world.  Students will collaborate with one another when critiquing artwork, selecting work to go into the portfolio, and analyzing one another's goals and reflections.  One major goal I have for the portfolio itself is to maintain a connection between myself, students, and parents.  To help with this, myself (the teacher) and parents will have the ability to comment on student art and reflections.  I am not allowing the option for student commenting, however, because it will require a lot of anti-spam management and constant reading by me to make sure commenting is appropriate.  I may consider this possibility in the future, however, but am leaving it out of my first draft.  Students will have many choices in the creation of their portfolios.  I will give them a list of guidelines and criteria, and they will select the works of art that best meets that criteria.  They will also have choice in how they reflect on their work and what goals they set for themselves.  I want to have a lot of control over how the portfolios look, however, because I don't want to spend a lot of class time designing the portfolios.  So, I will create several templates or color palettes and students can select which they would like to use for their portfolios.  Student learning will be self-assessed by students in their reflections.  They can also be pushed further by comments by their parents and myself in their portfolio pages.  This ongoing dialogue between classmates, teacher, and parent will hopefully facilitate a fertile ground where they students can learn and grow.  I will know that students have met their objectives when portfolios have been completed with the required amount of entries, including uploaded works of art, reflections, goals, and comments.  Students will be assessed according to a pre-made rubric.  It is going to take me a lot of time to create this tool, but I believe I can realistically complete it this summer.  I don't think it will be difficult to implement the online portfolio into the curriculum because I am setting it up in a really "hand-holding" kind of way that clearly walks students through the procedure.  We will probably spend 1-2 class periods making the first entry together, and students can do it on their own during class time after that.  I will be checking the portfolios regularly and helping individual students as needed.  The technology will be used to support and foster learning by putting the learning in the hands of the students.  Rather than being a bystander to their own learning, they will be in control of it.  It is too easy for students to float through classes without ever stepping outside themselves and assessing their own development.  The technology will help students walk through the process of developing creative ideas and reflecting.
