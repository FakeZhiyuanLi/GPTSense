      Sitting here in this room.  Waiting for her to make a move.  I'd like to hear the phone ring, I'd like to have the inbox filled.  An instant message.  A call from someone else letting me know she asked about me.  Maybe an old fashioned letter.  The problem is, she doesn't exist.  Somewhere out there she does, but she hasn't met me.  She doesn't know my name.  She can't even tell what color my eyes are.  Never heard my voice, never asked to hear mine. Somewhere she's happy with the guy she has now, or is she alone asking the same question I've wondered for sometime. Where is the one for me?  I may find her tomorrow, I may find her next year. Perhaps she does know me, but it's my fear of failure that keeps me from getting to know her.  Not in idle conversation, or the casual question, but asking her to let me know her, and peering into her soul through her eyes and getting the answers I seek.  I will meet my fate one day, and I hope my fate is her.

      I've seen the commercial over and over again.  The one where the guy and the girl get in the elevator with the older black lady and she exchanges a glance and smiles at the girl.  The guy tells the lady to have a nice day and they walk out with the girl doing a meekish lookback at the lady.  The back of the guys shirt reads "Child Abuser" or something to that effect.. That's all I need to see again right now.  I want to call. I just need to see that commercial or for someone to tell me to call.  I saw something the other day more obvious then the guy with the shirt clearly spelling out that he beats his kid.  Standing at the door at a retail location the other day a small child, thin, probably thinner then he should be entered the store. He went for the gumball machine and when he did his father grabbed his arm, nothing there bothered me. Lord know I've grabbed my nephew and had to pry him from something but what the child did was what disturbed me.  He didn't flinch or cover his head like I'd expect, hell I still flinch when my older brother is around and I see something flash out of the corner of my eye.  This kid however turtled, covering his head with both arms and curling up in a fetal position before his small body even had time to hit the ground.  This wasn't the reaction of a child that had been swatted on the but a dozen or more times in his life, this was the animal instinct of a child that had the fear of being pummeled once again.  His father didn't hit him that time.  He yelled at him sternly and as I said, had it just been the stern yell, and the arm grab, and even a smack on the ass it wouldn't have bothered me one bit, but the reaction again is what I go back to.  Through work while the guy was there I was able to get his name and adress.  His wife I'm certain is also a victim.  As the exited he questioned her about something they bought and when she told him not to worry about it he yanked the recepit off of her saying "Fuck you" and off he went in the other direction.  I don't want to get involved, but if I don't then what?  Whne I was growing up I was a small child, I'm still a small man.  My older brother and myself looked like we where malnourished while in fact, that's just the way we where, still are.  When the school nurse reported my mother for child abuse on that alone it was horrible.  Half a dozen blood test on my brother later it was just determined it was genetics, nothing that my mother was doing.  That's what I fear, alienating someone else that may be a decent person like my mother.  But decent people don't tell their wife "Fuck you." in private, let alone infront of a complete stranger in a public place over something so mundane.  Decent people don't have children that fear for their safety at a sudden movement by their children.  I'm a decent person.. if I don't do something, will I still be a decent person? Or just like him.
