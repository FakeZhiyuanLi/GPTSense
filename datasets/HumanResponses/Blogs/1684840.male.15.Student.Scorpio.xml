       Today was cool.  We raked the yard a bit we filled up an inflatable paddling pool.  I didn't go in it though.  Sheldon is back to work now so he isn't around for quite a bit of the day.  We might be going out tomorrow, we might not.  Lets just see how it goes.  I'm off for now... cya...

       Today was great!!  We went to Wal-Mart, and I was absolutely gobsmacked.  They sell tyres, bikes, household goods, guns, sports equipment, pc stuff, games consoles and games, gardening equipment, toys, medicene... oh yeah and food! LOL  They even had school equipment lists on a rack for the local schools to get what they needed... weird!  It's freaky.  It's almost like a UK Asda because it has the same slogon "Always low prices", has the creeply little smiley face and the same rollback gimmick.  They have live lobsters in a little round tank, you choose which one you want, they kill it and prepare it for you... eugh!  They have rotating bag stands at the checkouts and the till people pack for you (I think that's a usual thing in every store in America).  They have prams hanging from the ceiling!!  It's mental lol  I blew the whole of my money on a Gameboy Advanced and a Pokemon Sapphire game, ($115 which is exactly £30 cheaper than I would get it in the UK!! In the UK it would have cost = $162)  I've been playing on it all day, and I finally came around and come off it to write today's final journal entry ;)  I've updated the picture gallery in 'Pictures Two' with lots of picture I took today.  I even got a snap of one of the stands which had guns in!  Today was a brill day, hope theres more of these to come eh :)

Hopefully getting some more money changed tomorrow, I'm thinking of getting a Gameboy Advanced, which is like £20 cheaper than in the UK :D  I'll post some more pics tomorrow, and one of the rain today too.

       What a day!  I'm kinda caffeine drunk, but I'll get to that later *hic*  We started out to this department store, a bit like an American Ikea.  The other guys were packing up stuff into the trolly while I was watching this cool robotic hoover lol  We then went to this MASSIVE mall where we went to get my mum's engagement ring resized, then we all went looking around these stores.  After that we went to this really cheap elecrtical goods store, yet again MASSIVE!  I had another bottle of Mountain Dew and we made our way to Mc Donald's, one of the few hundred to choose from LOL  I had yet another MASSIVE drink of Dr Pepper and I'm full of caffeine and shaking like mad *shakes*  We then went to H.E.B. again where I bought Natalie's Jello and loads of Kool-Aid!  I've added more pictures to the 'Pictures One' gallery page, so check them out now!!  Might post later on, cya :)  P.S, Look down!  I have now added a Mood tag :)  Now you will know how I'm feeling!  I'll update it every post, but it will change on all of the posts, so don't get confused now :)

       I've just been to a grocery store called H.E.B. and got to see all the cool American food stuff and sweets!!  I bought a lot of Kool-Aid and looked at all the different brands of fizzy drinks (soda) they had. I bought a bottle of Mountain Dew, which tastes a bit like Lilt, and some gummy Life Savers for when I'm in mortal peril!! lol :D   Bought Becky's grape Jello (I had a litle trouble finding it through the shelves full of all the flavours. The fruit and veg. section had little water sprayers on the shelves which kept the food fresh! We got all our bags packed by helpful staff of the shop, one of the differences to the UK I noticed.  I'm gonna chill now, cya :)

       I've just arrived at Sheldon's house in San Antonio after a hell of a long journey!  We took off from Manchester Airport about 11:28AM and I got a window seat to take some great pics (I'll upload some tomorrow :D)  The attendants came around with drinks and pretzels and they showed "Chicago" on the projector.  The view outside the plane was phenomenal.  We were supposed to be flying straight over the Atlantic but we took the scenic route, across Greenland and Iceland and Canada, and then finally into America and finally to Atlanta.  Getting through Immigration was like watching paint evaporate.  Sheldon got straight through because he was an American Citizen, but we had to wait for about 50 minutes, making us miss our connecter flight to San Antonio.  We finally got through and we left our luggage with customs, made our way through the metal detectors and up to the departure lobbies.  We took a shuttle train to Lobby C only to find our plane had left, so they assigned us another.  We made our way to Lobby D and waited for our new flight to San Antonio on a smaller commercial plane (the US equivilant of the UK's train system lol, well, you couldn't say in the UK, "Hey I'm just gonna pop down Stoke on the plane" lol)  We had no in-flight movie this time because the flight duration was only about 2 hours.  We arrived at our final destination at San Antonio Airport which looked like a bomb had hit it (It was currently being refurbished).  We made our way to baggage where we had a horrible feeling that our luggage had gone astray..  :o  We found it in the end and a helpful airport man came to whisk our cases to the entrance where Sheldon's freind was waiting to pick us up.  We drove through San Antonio City, full of bright lights and littered with advertisments.  There were hundreds of fast food restraunts everywhere!!  We drove to a shopping place where we spotted a drive-thru pharmacy, yes you heard me right, a drive-thru pharmacy!  I've seen it all now lol  We waited in the car listening to Avril Lavine and then drove to Sheldon's house.  It's currently 10:39 CST, and I imagine about 4:39AM over in good old England :D  Keep posted for pics of the flight, they're awesome!!

       I'm getting really excited now! Less than 5 hours to go and I'm just starting to feel that it's actually real lol :D   Finished packing ages ago and I've only just realised I forgot to pack my toothbrush SHOCK HORROR! I'm gonna keep a Mini-Journal on the plane so I can get you a good detailed description of what it's like, and I'm hoping to get a few pics from out of the window :) The first plane goes to Atlanta, where we will be boarding another flight to San Antonio, our final destination in Texas. It's gonna be a great journey! The last time I went on a plane was when I was about 4 and I can only remember a bit from that.   This is going to be my last post until I take out my Harddrive from my pc to take on holiday with me (Yes, I'm going to be online!)   Anyways, goodnight :D

       Cool day today.  Did a bit more work on Coffee Chat while my Mum and co. went to town.  I remade  urlLink Where's Willow?  (A Habbo game where you go round finding Willow).  I'm so jealous of my mate who gets to go to the Habbo Offices in August and see all the cool stuff :D  I'm going my Grandma's for tea tomorrow :)  I wont post again tonight, well, If aliens land or something then I might lol Cya

       Just woke up and I'm feeling great :)  Gonna start packing today and tidy things up for when we go away.  I still don't think it has stuck in my head that school has finished, but I'm sure it will tomorrow when I won't have to get up at 7:30.  It almost seems that going on holiday isn't real either, more like a dream, but that's probably because it's so great :)  I'll post a bit later after I've sorted some clothes out and packed some stuff.

       Day was really long and boring.  I was home alone nearly all day and my heads buzzing because I've been on the computer too long... again!  So today's events in a nutshell.  Woke up, went on computer, got dressed, had chocolate bar, more computer, had chese and onion bap, more computer, had more baps, more computer Mum and Sheldon came home, wrote in Journal...  And that brings me here :)  Might be getting a further $47 holiday money from my grandparents for doing great in my sats soon!  Very little time left now until my holiday!  T-Minus 3 days :D  Good Night... zZzZzZzZ

       I've been up all night, drank two bottles of Dr. Pepper and stuffed myself with sugar and now I feel shoite lol  The BBQ was cool.  I scoffed myself silly, but probably not as much as other people did though 8->  It's been a wicked day to end of the dreaded place which makes us learn (regime which must not be named).  I'll probably have a sugar hangover in the morning lol *hic* ;)  Im off to bed now cuz my eyes wont stay open ¦-{

       Left school a while ago... for the holidays!! :D  Very cool day, well, if you can call it a day.  Zak brought in his water gun, and the teachers were too dumb to realise it poking out of his bag all day lol.  The only lesson today where we actually did some work was geography, typical Mrs. Marsh.  We watched a few videos and messed around in other lessons, pretty pointless going in at all I suppose.  I've got a right old elephant for my next school tutor and it's gonna suck.  I got a few awards in assembly and I wasn't suprised that Mrs. Marsh chose two girls for her awards, again, typical old Marshy!  I'm having a barbeque tonight (in aid of my Mum's and Sheldon's engagement) and then I'm going my dad's for the weekend.  I'm gonna be packing for my hols on Monday and Tuesday and then jetting off on Wednesday :)  I better go and get ready for the barbeque...cya

       Today was as eventful as a rain shower... literally  Woke up this morning at 3:00 AM to a raging thunder storm, which went on all morning, and when it's pitch black and you're in bed, it's quite scary!  When I was awoke by my alarm I found the garden flooded and the sky all grey.  It has been raining all day, some minor rumbles of thunder now and then, but nothing as major as last night.  The day was totally miserable and boring, but you can't really expect school to be fun I suppose.  Which reminds me, last day tomorrow!!!  Gonna be baby sitting tonight so I should get some more pocket money for my holiday to America, 6 days to go :D  Can't wait one bit...

       I shouldn't have spoken too soon about that thunder...   Geez we had a great storm tonight!  Lots of loud rumbling and flashing (no not that type, the lightning you pervert :P)  I had a great veiw...from the centre of my back garden!  I got absolutely soaked, but it was worth it, and I even took a trip to the local Tesco Express in it too, with a few funny glances from shoppers because I was drenched and my shoes were making a squeaky noise on the shiny floor!  Weather is so entertaining :D

       Only one and a half days of school to go, and I've managed to escape being soaked yet another day :)  The dinner ladies have been demonic and evil, nothing really perculiar about that really eh!  So we decided to form a group called ADA (Anti-Dinnerlady Association) and our recognition salute is that of Hitler because, naturally, it suits the situation doesn't it?  Anyway, the day went a bit boring after that...  I'd like to formally slag off the weatherman for promising rain storms and thunder, but did we get a drop of rain?  NO!  Instead there was blazing hot sunshine and headaches forcast for me :(  Today has been great though.  I gotta admit though that seeing dinnerladies angry is so much fun muahahahahaha

       First post, woohoo!  Today was an extremely boring day at school (no suprise there).  Can't wait until Friday at 12:35 when we leave the school grounds for 6 long and deserved weeks of rest.  I'm really excited about our 6 week holiday to Texas, which we go on next Wednesday!!!!!!  I've got yet ANOTHER cold and my throat hurts :(  I hope it rains really soon because I've had just about enough of it being sunny, even though I was really bored of seeing rain cloud rain cloud on the weather every day.  I'm off to bed now anyways...

       Today sure went quick!  We didn't do that much, but I liked today a lot for some reason lol.  I'm writing again!  Yesterday I dug out the first part of a story I had started to write a while ago, and now I'm going to finish it :)  I think it's better than anything I've done so far!  Mum and sheldon went shopping earlier, while I kept sizzling poor Crash Bandicoot on hot coals lol.  Nearly a week to go until we're up on the bum aching aeroplane again, but at least this time I'll have my Gameboy to keep me occupied.  I'm going shopping soon for the sweets and things to bring back and amaze people with lol.  Can't wait for that.  Sheldon has to go to work again tomorrow :(  I've got a perculiar feeling that when I come back my cat's gonna HUGE!  He always looks bigger when we haven't seen him for ages lol.  Night all...

       Had a nice day today :)  Woke up to my brothers fighting in my room... AGAIN grrrrrr!  Sheldon's sister came but I didn't see her, lol.  There was a thunder storm, Woohoo!  The lightening was very thick and much brighter than ours, louder thunder rumbles too.    I'm gradually making my mind up over moving over here.  So far I'm 80% for it.  I'm gonna miss a hell of a lot of things, right down the the last red post box :)  Might be going a few places tomorrow, and I hopefully won't forget to update this blog which has been sitting here for days without a post (sorry!).  Good Night :)

       Sorry about not posting for a while, we've been doing so much I've been forgetting to post!  Yesterday we went to a British food shop, which had a lot of out of date stuff :S.  We bought some Ribena and sweets u can't buy in America there.  We then went to H.E.B. to do the weekyl shopping.  The American kids started school today from their longer summer holiday!  Haha, nerrrrr :P  Today we went to Toys R Us for the Pokemon tour currently going on in the US.  We took our gameboys and got free Pokemon stuff, it was really cool, and it was only a little set up in the car park, plus they came in a Pikachu car!! (See Pictures Five).  We got an Eon Ticket swipe card for the Pokemon gameboy game plus, a poster, a toy and cool little badges.  Plus, it was probably less crowded due to the American kids being at school, they missed the whole thing rofl!!  See the new 'Pictures Five' section for snaps from San Angelo and today :)  Good Night..ZzZz

Tropical Storm Erika is heading for southern Texas, but nowhere near us fortunately! :)  Aparantly it could turn into Hurricane Erika!! :|  We did a flash mob on Habbo today, that was fun :D  Anyway, it's getting late so night night...

       Wow what a day!  I woke up about 11:30 to a great breakfast of tacos!!  Beef, egg, cheese and salsa sauce to be precise, yummmm!  Not long after, we set off for a ride around the city, which was cool.  We went to this large park by a lake, and I mean big!  We picked up drinks (I had a can of Mountain Dew, my new found love lol :D) and then we went to this park bit where there were swings, whoooooosh.    We then drove around for a bit (I spotted some English looking traffic lights) until we finally came back home.  I spent the afternoon playing on my Gameboy until dinner time.  We had this gorgeous meatloaf consisting of beef, onion and kechup.  After, we played a game called Aggrivation with marbles, a bit like ludo, frustration, whatever you wanna call it, followed by a blue raspberry popcicle, and then a few rounds of Balderdash.  Dan and Ryan went to bed (well, if you can call two sofas a bed!) and we went outside the back to a beautiful large red star, Mars to be exact.  The topic of conversation changed from stuff about space, to evolution and how we believe it's a load of crap followed by my favourite subject: how Earth was blessed with Humans! lol  We had a cool chat about how angry the atmosphere was in Atlanta when we arrived on American soil, and then about how different it was and how cold it can get.  I was told the coldest it can get in winter is 0 degrees....Fahrenheit, which is like nearly -20 degrees Celcius!!  Just about to get to sleep in my nice warm... floor! :D  I have pics of the day but I can't upload them here, you'll have to wait till we get back in San Antonio ;)  That might be tommorow or Tuesday, not certain yet.  Nighty night...

       Suprise!  Sheldon's mum and dad have a computer after all!  We've had a fun day :)  Sheldon's mum is cool lol, and umm  small ;)   It took us 3:15 to get here, the familiar butt-ache kicking in.  I can't help stop giggling about that flash mobbing (thanx for showing me that Becky! LOL).  I just stuck my music on and went to sleep for the first half of the journey.  Dunno how long I'm staying here for, or what we're going to do while we're here!  Anyways, better be off to bed now... cya

       Heloo...  Sorry about not posting the last couple of days as there wasn't that much of interest to write about anyway.  We pretty much stayed in and went computer and gameboy crazy!!  Well, I've not long been up now and it's 11:05am.  We might be making an early start to Sheldon's mum's house in San Angelo so I thought I'd better post now.  I won't be posting for up to 3 days max.  I'll be back with pics and stuff and a good blog entry when I return.  See you all in three days! lol

       We're going to Sheldon's mum's house for this weekend so I wont be able to blog!  I'll be taking my camera and I'll have a nice report on what happened when we get back, maybe on Monday or Tuesday (not sure when yet).  Today was cool.  Sheldon started work again so we chilled out at home.  Good night :)

       Woohoo!  Got back from the city and I'm sweating like a P.I.G!  I got loads of pictures, I used up two camera cards, and I made two sections from them, 'Pictures Three' and 'Pictures Four'.  Check them out now!  We went to the Alamo which is this big ancient place (we werent even allowed to touch the walls!)  And I got this cool strobe light keyring and a squashed penny with the building on it.  We then went outside and I had an American snow cone.  It was a cup full of ice they squirt juice on, which was quite refreshing :)  We then spotted the MSNBC news crew going around talking to people and doing reports and stuff (I snook a pic of them when they weren't looking LOL).  When I had finished my icy thingy we all headed off for fudruckers.  It was really cool!  I didn't know you could choose how you wanted your burger cooked, what cheese to put on it and everything!  I just chose a plain ol' hamburger, which did me fine.  We then went on this Riverwalk which was a really nice boat ride down the San Antonio river.  There was loads to see, it was so colourful and the building designs were amazing.  The tour guide said they dye the river green on St. Patrick's day!  We headed back home and that was the end to our cool day :)  Remember to check the Picture Gallery!

       Not a great today, but it was ok.  We didn't go into town in the end, but we may be going very soon.  We played a board game and watched a lot of TV.  I'm going to bed now *yawn*, night.

       I ate Bambi!  Die cute but evil little deer roawr!  lol  Seriously now, I ate deer today, and they didn't even tell me it was deer until after I had eaten it!  It tasted like spicy sausage, the meat was tough but how was I to know.  It was quite nice, but I'm not sure if I'd have it again.  We met a few of Sheldon's family this morning, they were quite friendly, and they gave us a little pack of playing cards, which had a picture of Texas on the back of each card, as a 'Welcome to Texas' gift.  It's poker time! lol  Mum, Sheldon and Ryan went to an International store while me and Daniel stayed at home.  I took some time to catch some rare Pokemon on my game while they took a crap journey to a store which didn't sell anything from England!  A total waste of time really :S  I nearly chucked up when I saw Sheldon covering two raw chickens with garlic salt, but that wasn't what made me queasy, it was the chicken's heart which was also salted up which nearly got me puking.  He was going to eat it! Eughhhhhhhh  We are going into town tomorrow for some sight seeing, and a few great photo oppertunities too so it will be awesome.  This post adds the 4th archive section onto my journal, making it here for nearly a month!  Might chill a bit before I hit the sack, nighty night.    P.S: I've change the title to 'Journal, Diary, Whadever' because that's how Americans pronounce their T's LOL

       Today was great :)  We didn't do that much but we still had a cool day.  I'm really for moving here, even though I had an encounter with the moody folk of Atlanta, which really put me off to begin with, but I'm begining to warm with the states at last.  Not that much is different, well apart from the fact:  It's legal to carry knives There is no TV 'Watershed' Woo Hoo! Everything is big and spaced out There's no local supermarket or cornershop, just big stores u can drive a couple of miles to Great weather Snakes, scorpions... the lot  Still pondering on what to do about school, I'll have to think about that a lot.  Anyways, past my bed time now... cya

       A great end to a cool Friday :)  In the morning, or should I say afternoon, I got up and had breakfast and played around on the PC and my Gameboy until around 6:50 when Sheldon came home from work and we had a great dinner :)  We then took a journey to Wal-Mart where Daniel got his Gameboy Advance, and with a free Pokemon Crystal game with it :o grrrrr  I bought an Action Replay, a link cable and a nice case for my Gameboy.  I'm now sitting here fiddling around with the stuff on it so I'm gonna go now :)

We did some yard work today, like as soon as we got up... grrr mum! lol  The rest of the day was PC and Gameboy more or less.  We might be going to Walmart again tomorrow to get my Daniel a Gameboy and I'll probably get some more stuff too :)  Until then... cya

       Woohoo!  The new site is finally up :D  Grandma is out again with her man friend and I'm stuck in here nearly as board as a cardboard box.  I'm busying myself with my website and thinking of pages and stuff I could add to it.  I'm going to upload the final part of the Holiday sections of the gallery.  I've decided to make them sections now rather than pages.  Mum is coming out of hospital tomorrow and Daniel and Ryan will be coming back from Dad's house, dear God!  I'll do some homework tomorrow and get some ingredients ready for double cooking on Monday (making a pie :D)  As for now, I'll just stay up buzzing for a while and finally drift off to bed a little later...

       Ooo my head is buzzing!  It was cool today, and not just any day, it was Friday!  The day lagged on a bit through some of the lessons, but it wasn't all that bad really.  I finished off Chapter 5 of my story and now I'll have to error check it when I get some free time.  Assembly nearly sent me to sleep with Mr. Gledhill rambling on about bloody target setting and how we're going to be doing it again, grr!  Anyway, the bell finally rang and I head off home thinking "WEEKEND!!".  Got home and got ready for going to the hospital to see mum.  She looked really well and her will power is amazing!  Go mum :D!  When I got back, Dad used his Paypal to buy my domain and hosting which I should be getting any minute.  This blog is ready to switch over to it when it comes!  I'm also thinking of adding loads of other stuff to it too, and it's NOT going to be about Habbo Hotel either *phew*  Anyway, bye for now :)

       This week has gone really fast!  Mum has been into Hospital and had the operation.  Can't wait till she comes home now :)  I'm going to see her at the hospital tomorrow after school.  Ryan seems to be taking advantage of mum's absence and playing up big time grrr!  I'm buying hosting for this tomorrow also so you won't have to keep going to that awkward url anymore :)  I'm planning to make a personal website too, that should be fun!  Might go town on Saturday for like the first time in ages.  I just hope the rest of the weeks ahead are going to go this quick because the sooner the time to leave comes, the better!  Which reminds me, less than three months till Christmas!!  I love the red, green and white lights and the magic that surrounds christmas.  It makes me feel back when i was little and Christmas was great, and it still is :D  Night everyone, before the night periods go too quickly for my liking and I wake up shaking :|

       You will never believe what's happened this week!  I caught a terrible disease called Blogus Preventus (that's latin, honest!) and whenever I tried to update my blog it teased me and it wouldnt let me update :'(  Hehe only joking.  I'm about to go off to bed now after a lazy Sunday, which felt like a typical Sunday now that I'm back at school.  The feeling of 'School Tomorrow' is floating around after a measly two days off.  I have a bad chest and I feel really hot... again.  I'm off.  I better get to bed now or I'll feel really rubbish in the morning.  Night...

       Today was  normal .  Probably one of the most  normal  days you could get really.  Didn't do anything really interesting at school today other than forget my Games note and had to go back home to fetch it at dinnertime.  We were using microscopes in Science and Chris put some of his blood on a slide to look through.  It was pretty cool but Miss. Jari told him off lol!  Well, it was much more fun than looking at onion peel >:D  I printed my story off last night so I can error check it when I have a bit of spare time.  Plus, it gives me another chance to read through it and convince myself it's not crap lol.  My stoopid printer is telling my I need to change the black ink cartridge because my stoopid printer uses cartridges with chips in, even though there is a lot of black ink left >:(  Just another money schemeing way Epson can make people buy their cartridges which cost a fortune grrrr.

       Noooooooo, school again today!  It was quite strange this morning really.  I was really late and I hadn't got my food ingredients ready so I had a mad rush around the house getting those ready!  I left the house about 8:50!  I know, very bad!  But that's not why it was strange; when I arrived at school, the bell went at 8:55!  How weird, it was as though it waited for me to arrive so I wouldn't be late haha :P  The overall day at school went well :)  We baked scones (or scons if you're like that) in double cooking, which I really like!  I wish I had a coffee through Information Systems.  It's getting terrible slow and it's hard to stay awake sometimes lol :S

       I'm stuffed!  I went to my cousin's party today; we all went bowling and then quazar.  After I had worn myself out, we ate party food.  We were then all given a party bag with free coupons and a mini bowling game in it, that was kool.  After we ate, the party guests left and then we were told we were going to the pub for tea.  I was already stuffed from the party food!!  But anyway, we went and I didn't eat much, yet I still had room for pudding (Everyone always has room for pudding!)  After that we all left and got home late.  I went to dads for the remainder of the weekend.  Good night :)

We had a test at the end of the day, and thanks to the pattern section of it, I got another headache >:(  More homework *moans*.  Can't wait for the weekend, I hope it comes really quick because I can have a long lie in :)  Night...

       Whew what a day.  Got up this morning feeling horrible so mum let me have the day off to recover.  How long is this flippin jet lag is going to go on for is buigging me now.  After another like, three hours rest, I woke up and had breakfast etc. and then tidied my room up.  I have somehow now regained my fascination in Pokemon Cards again, and Sea Monkeys too.  I think when we like something, we still like it but we don't realise it then later in life we re-discover it and like it again lol.  At least now I have two more things I can spend money on :)  I'm beginning to wonder whether knowing that I won't be doing my GCSEs will effect how well I do my coursework.  I'm still going to have to try hard though and do the work well :)

       What a day!  Went to school a little nervous and It was great in whole, well, it would be being my first day lol.  Said hi to freinds and ppl I hadn't seen over the holidays (erm... everybody!) and gave out Lifesavers and everyone was asking me about it :| lol!  Well, my reply was finally a "Yes I am moving, Woohoo!" and some were shocked and some were happy lol.  Information Systems was very boring indeed.  Mrs. Checketts is not what I expected her to be like in lessons, but she is still a big old weirdo o.O!  The rest was ok, but double cooking just rocks!  I felt the effects of jet lag this morning when I couldn't concentrate at all.  I got really hot and stuffed and I couldn't think at all, then I relaxed a bit and set my head straight.  I'm not suprised I didn't fall asleep though in I.S, it was borrring.  I started to wish I hadn't have taken it :S  I'm sweating like mad right now, my allergies are going mental and I feel stuffed up :(  Why can't us Brits have air conditioning too!  Smudge is going back to the Cat's Protection on Friday because he can't stay here :(  I'm gonna miss him soo much, even though he damages my health.  It's not fair...

I'll be able to get to bed at a reasonable time so I'm up in the morning :)  I'm not looking forward to IT, even though I love the subject.  I better go now and get to bed or I won't be up lol, night.

       Nearly midday.  Dan and Ryan are still fast asleep and mum is now up.  I'm feeling quite funny inside again, jet lag is soooo cruel :(  I just had a few Hershey's kisses and a few gummie lifesavers.  I keep thinking it's nearly late afternoon when it's not :S Somebody slap me, lol!

       I've just woke up.  I know what jet lag can do now.  I woke up in my clothes and my bedroom light on!  How the hell I fell asleep is a mystery, I must have just collapsed or something lol!  Even though I kept waking up in the night because of my body clock being screwed, I still didn't notice the light was on or the fact I was fully dressed :s  I feel properly awake now, but I'm still a bit groggy.  I'll go and get breakfast in a min.  It's sad.  I woke up and I thought 'I wonder what we're doin today' and then when I opened my eyes I moaned.  Sleep can really confuse you, you know.  I had thought we were still in America, proberbly because it seams so dreamy here.  Maybe it won't when I go out in the freezing cold to go to school eh, lol.  I still really wanna be back in America though, I suppose I'm going to have to live with it until we go back :(

       It's midnight and I can't get to sleep.  I'm tired but I feel very buzzy and I just don't feel like settling down, but I will hopefully soon *yawns*  It has been a long hard day for all of us, and it really doesn't feel right being here, knowing that we should all be in America having a great time still.  Pinch me, I still think I'm dreaming :(  Oh well, I'm sure I'll just wake up in the morning and feel the wrath of the real world.  School starts soon, I'm excited about that even though it's going to strange with all the new changes.  Dad came earlier to see us.  We're going tomorrow to stay for the weekend and to celebrate Ryan's birthday again for the people in England.  I'm currently guzzling down some Mountain Dew I bought home, the caffeine settles me down o.O!  I have some pictures from the flight and the journey home to upload, but I'll do it tomorrow when I feel awake.  I'm off for a bit and then I'll go to bed, night :)

       *phew*  I've just plonked my hard drive back into my PC, oh and guess what...  I'M BACK HOME!!  Woohoo, even though I really wanted to stay in America, I am somewhat glad to be back where if you tell a girl to move her fanny you'd get a slap, lol.  When I got up It didn't seem like we were doing anything special.  I had breakfast and we finished packing and rushing around for unpacked things etc.  We finally got all our cases into the car with a big heave and we set of for San Antonio Airport.  We wandered around the shops n stuff while mum and sheldon had their last minutes together and then we went through the metal detectors and waved goodbye to Shel.  Btw, thanks Shel for putting up with us and making our time really great :D!  We got on our flight to Atlanta, which was quite ok.  When we arrived in Atlanta I was relieved that it wasn't as tense as when we came from England.  Well, probably because we didn't go through Immigration I don't know, but it was cool.  Our main flight home was brilliant.  We took off just after sunset at Atlanta when all the runway lights were on and everything, it was very cool!  It was quite strange because little orange flashes came from some of the clouds we passed, thunder maybe?  It turned night-time and we had dinner, watching 'Anger Management' as we ate.  A while after that everyone went to sleep.  I got a little bit of shut-eye but I couldn't really sleep that much really.  When I opened the window the view was great.  Stars were EVERYWHERE in the sky, it was really beautiful.  I could even see Orion up there, and even Mars at one point.  As we neared Ireland, it got light again, the sun rising and our breakfast being served.  We had a warm croissaint (Is that how you spell it?), a banana and a crispy oat and honey bar.  We soon came to land at good old Manchester Airport, greeted by an ENGLISH accent, yes I couldn't believe it lol!  After Daniel had a few minutes making fun of the way she said "Nine o' clock" (the time we arrived), we left the plane and wet to collect our stuff.  I'm not really that tired but I have a feeling this Jet lag is going to haunt us for a few more days :(  I still cannot believe I'm actually awake and living this, I'm convinced it's all a dream and I'm going to wake up back on the sofa in America... *Pinches arm really hard*  Ouch... :(

       *Sighs* A great holiday, wooshed straght passed, well, all because we were having so much fun!    From what started as an unreal, exciting and strange experience has turned into a fun and likable new surrounding.  I can't wait to get back here, and I haven't even left yet lol.  It will be surreal going back to England hearing Brittish accents instead of the American ones.  I can imagine messing a few thigs up like saying chips instead of crisps, I have got used to chips now and it will probably take a while to shake that off lol!  That and soda also... o.O  I'm scared of the jet lag which is ahead of us.  I don't like things messing with my head, it makes me feel sick :(  Speaking of which, I better get off to bed before I go too late.. again!  I'm going to take a mini-journal on the plane again, plus the great views from the plane windows If I can.

       Not long at all now.  Mum and Shel have gone out while we pack our stuff etc.  Just watched a bit of Mrs. Doubtfire on tv, heh.  From what I've heard, school seems to be a lot different from how I left it.  Hopefully it's just me, expecting it to be horrible when it won't be :|  Case is nearly packed, I'm trying to squeeze the last bits of clothes in.  I hope the people at the airport don't mess it up.  I'm still making modifications to my new layout so expect to see a few changes now and again :)

       Hehe, I'm all full of energy and ready to make my final post today lol.  We went to Wal-Mart again, aching my legs off because of the largeness of the store, and after that, heading to McDonalds via Target to get the sweets to bring back home :)  I had another super large Dr. Pepper, and I was able to drink it this time without feeling like one of Ryan's Birthday balloons lol.  When we got back we went out in the back garden to play pinyatta.  When Ryan had finally smashed it to bits, we all grabbed the sweets and cheap plastic toys which fell out lol!  It was fun ;)  I've nearly packed my case now.  It's ready for my hard drive to be packed snugly between my clothes so that it don't break.  I'm getting nervous for the flight home again, not long at all now!  Nervous about returning to school, I can't believe there's only a year and a half left of that, scarrry :| (Even though I'm not going to be there a year and a half lol)  After a long day, and my head is still hurting grr, I'm off...

We'll be going the shop in a short while to get souvenirs etc. to bring back to England.  My eyebrow aches because I've been frowning too much lol >:)  Anyway, I'll post later after I'm full of Dr. Pepper and hamburgers from McDonalds, cya.

       Another week gone by.......  We had a small thunder storm last night, and I get scared :( lol!  We were gonna go out today but we decided not to.  Instead, we stayed in and watched Final Destination 2 on In Demand Pay Per View.  Made me feel kida sick, but it was a good movie :)  Ryans birthday today.  We're going to McDonalds again.  I can't wait to have one of the massive drinks again... mmmm.  Not long now until we go home.  I'm kinda excited and also sad cause we have to leave! :(  I'll just have to think of it as a 4/5 month holiday until we come back here lol, but somehow I don't think that would work...  Better get off to bed now, or else I'll get ryan jumping up and down on my bed to wake me up heh  Oh, and by the way... New Layout!  (If you hadn't already noticed LOL)  I've also scrapped the imood because it didn't fit with this layout :S

       I'm becoming terrible at not updating my blog :(  So then, here's a little update for this week!  There was no school on Monday (YEAHHHHHHHHHHH).  I went to Pets at Home to get some more fish for my tropical set up.  Trust my luck to get a male and female sword-tail fish!  It will be interesting to see what happens :|  Tuesday was cool too.  There were only a grand total of FIVE people in our French class, 10 people in English and 11 in Science.  It was pretty good, except for Geography where more than half the class were in!  I couldn't believe my own mind when I thought of a super twist in my story. I'm not telling a soul any part of my story from now on because I want to make it secret >:D  Today was super.  Lesson one was a right laugh.  Chris decided to experiment with Mrs. Lawley's Winnie the Pooh teddies and put them in vulgar sexual positions while she was whisked off to the reprographics room.  Oliver just wanted to hide them and make it look like they were having a secret tea party, which would have been hilarious if we had little cups!  Lesson two was boring and we just did normal work :(  GEOGRAPHY again!!  Science was fun though, we did some copper coating.  People were turning coins bronze and everything, well, when I say people I mean the few people who were actually in school!  English after wasn't really fun but time flew by.  A quick ten minutes in registration and we were free to leave at 2:30 due to Open Evening, didn't seem different though, but it was cool I suppose as we missed the lesson with Cruella De Vil!  Home was good apart from the fact Daniel was trying to make everything awkward!  Apart from that, everything was great!  Every Wednesday is really good!  Only 16 days until my birthday!!  I can't wait :D  That's on Friday though, another really cool day because the excitement of the weekend is added to it!  I better get off now before I fall asleep on my keyboard and dislodge the space bar like I did already last week :S

       Today was cool!  My Geography homework was a let down because I saved it and then when I came to print it at school it was corrupted!  I'm not going to go into how the rest of the day was because you would probably guess what it was like.  When I got home it was fun.  I made a cake not so long ago, and it was great!  It was tasty, fruity and very spongy.  I am so gonna make more of them in the future :D

       Ahh what a great day... Not!  I  hate  Tuesdays, and always have done.  They include a bundle of my not so favourite subjects which seem to lag on forever!  As soon as I left the house this morning I started snivelling in the ice cold winds.  It was absolutely freezing!!  I swear I've got a cold coming now, and all thanks to school, the infamous HELL HOLE!  French was a breeze (no pun intended), but after that it all went a bit pear-shaped.  We had a fire drill right at the end of English which was uncalled for.  Standing out in the freezing rain is not fun, trust me!  At least we got to go to break early...  Science was as interrupted as ever and Geography was absolutely... hmm let's see... exciting *cough* not!  Now that I have made fun of the first droning half of the day, let's move onto the second *woo hoo*  Sitting in the unit for 50 minutes when no-one is there but the teaching support staff gives you a lot of time to think and clear your head.  I think that was the lesson I enjoyed the most, even though it really wasn't really a proper lesson.  I'd have hated to do games in  that  weather!  I would not have been amused! *Sips tea like The Queen*  Days go fuzzy as soon as you get home because I try and cram everything fun in as I can, plus do homework at the same time!  Mental I'm telling you...

       Wow what a day!  It was certainly a nice change from the usual droning Monday.  There was no Information Systems today due to this stupid thing about how well we did in SATs etc.  But hey, we got to miss Information Systems!  Chemistry was awesome!  We were making metal come from its ore, then Mrs. Bond made some metal explode >:D  Cooking wasn't so bad this week either.  I made Gingerbread, which turned out like Ginger cake!  Thatnks alot Mrs. Humpherys for taking it out too soon *rolls eyes*, the middle wasn't cooked properly!  Anywho, the rest of the day went alright.  I earnt a tenner off Aunty Di for installing and setting up some stuff on her new PC.  Pretty cool really!  I'm off now, cya :)

       This week is going really crap.  School as boring as ever.  Dido's new album is out *woohoo*  Now I've got some more music to listen to at last, which makes a nice difference from Avril etc. (Ironic really as I haven't yet even got the new Dido album!)  The day Mrs. Checketts realises that there are more words in the vocabulary other than really difficult ones will be the day man lands on the sun.  She almost stood there for 20 minutes asking around what abstract meant *rolls eyes*  I'm planning on making a Snapshot space on the main site for webcam pics.  That is when I've got a web cam of course; I'm saving up for one :D  Night :)

       Whoa, what a long time since the last update!  There was a bit of trouble with the site so it wasn't showing properly :(  Sorry bout that!  During the time the site has been down, I have been ill and mum has gone to America for two weeks.  Last week I had 2 Science exams, they werent that hard, but they were quite challenging.  My chest is still a bit bad; everyone seems to have this cough and cold, it's probably the weather again.  Chrismas is less than 4 weeks away!!!

       Hey all.  The weekend is now over... again :(  My birthday went great!  I had a grand total of £120!!!  I've had to repay dad for I few things I've had in advance plus I went shopping yesterday and bought all of the Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 games.  So with £55 left, I plan to sell my Gameboy Advance and get an SP instead, which are 100 times better (I don't know why I didn't get one of them in the first place)

       Tonight was great!  Dad came round and suprised us all with fireworks :D  We watched them in the garden whilst there were thousands of other bangs filling the sky.  I saved a few sparklers for my birthday, just to make it a little bit better ;)  I'm off now, no school tomorrow!!! (10 mnutes?  That's nothing :P)

Mrs.  Checketts's lesson is last, a grand super finale for today, Not!  Anyways, better go now, byeeee

       Wow what a week!  Free from school WOOOOOOOOOOOO  The start was quite good.  Me, Sam, Craig and not Chris (the lazy git) went down town and did stuff.  The weekend was okay too.  We went the cinema to see Finding Nemo, which is a wicked film!!!  "I shall call him squishy, and he shall be mine, and he shall be my squishy" lol  So anyway, the half term ends here.  I've just been to York for the weekend and that was ok.  I wasn't feeling to well though, which spoiled it :(  The York Dungeon was great!  I had giggle fits every night and one of the main reasons was because of the  urlLink Hypnotoad  from Futurama, daft I know!  I'm off to bed now because it's that 'S' place in the morning, cya :)  P.S:  My birthday on Friday!  Buy me a present or I will stalk you and pelt you with soggy wet sponges... You have been warned :P

       Wow, we were close to snow today!  Woke up this mornin and fog was EVERYWHERE.  The ground is all dry and crispy and the air is bitterly cold.  8 DAYS 'till Christmas now, can't wait.  I get the feeling Dad has got me something really cool for Christmas, I can't wait :D

       Wow, only 9 days 'till Christmas and it doesn't seem like it!  It's probably how we notice the excitement drain from it every year as we age.  All the colourful lights and mad shopping are very appealing mind!  2 + 1/2 days to go at school!  I can't wait for that to finish.  A long term comes to an end, along with all the coursework and the words GCSE (eek) finally dissapear into the brances of the Christmas tree... for now!  I've been going out a bit more often now, and I'm starting ot notice myself becoming naturally exhausted and tired at the end of the day.  Its a good feeling, believe me.  Waking up at 7:30 - 8:00 isn't easy :(  And yes, get a load of this, all of our precious sunlight hours are spent at school!  Yep, sun comes up about 8:15 and sets at about 3:51!  How great...  So as the Winter (Hahahahahaha - No Snow) goes on, as the temperature starts to get below freezing, Christmas approaches!!!

       2 Days into Winter and the weather has got... WARMER!  Thanks to a load of unwanted rain, that's why.  All the days are dull, it goes dark right after school and it makes school a nightmare.  How great Winter is.  Oh yeh, forgot bout Christmas :P  Less than 3 weeks away, but the mood doesn't seem to be floating around for some reason :(  My Birthday present of Dad should have been here by now, but as I exected, it isn't!  I can see it coming during the end of this week, hopefully.  I went to bed at 10:30 last night to see how big a difference to how my body felt in the morning, and to my suprise, I felt GREAT.  Plent more early nights for me :D

       Good couple of days :)  Oppertunity has touched down on the Red Planet!  Seems that it has landed in a crater with loads of weird mud and flat stones.  Plus, Spirit had a file storage problem!  It's always a computer fault isn't it! heh  Britain has now entered the sub-zero temperatures that is mid-Winter.  The air is getting colder and more quiet every minute.  It's as if you can tell snow is coming :D  Mrs. Bladon must have the plague or somethin; she has been off for a while now! (YESS! Because French is utterly boring!)  We had tutorial today so we didn't have the Perminator for a lesson.  Ah well, we're only doing the amtosphere (BORRRING).  Checketts wasn't so bad today either, she seemed a little more frosty than usual...

       Whoa, not a single post for nearly a month!  I'm terrible (sue me :P).  Anyways, not alots happened to me recently...  School has been as boring as ever, apart from that day where the class had to disect real organs from farm animals.  I nearly puked that day!  Or maybe the day when Mrs. Humphreys locked us all in the cooking room and kept us all back for no reason.  Maybe it could have been that time when Checketts fell over the whiteboard (daft cow)!  So maybe it was an eventful 23 days since my last post after all.  Beagle is lost on Mars, while the NASA Spirit rover is on a rocky hospital bed while it is being operated on (techno. surgeon and patient being 104M Kilometers apart of course).  Opportunity lands tomorrow!  Poor Beagle eh, the Brit's one big chance to hit the limelight and they've blown it... or have they?  They have one last chance on Monday, then it's classed as Lost!!  Freak weather conditions forecast for next week... (YESS!!!).  School may be cancelled if they shut down the motorway... Ha! In a million years.... :o(  Heavy snow and temperatures of -14 are expected!!!  Hopefully this is enough to cover England a few thousand feet hehe.  Snow tunnels for all!

Finished a load of coursework off recently and we have a Biology exam on Wednesday.  I have been getting straight A*s in the practice tests... COME ONNNN!!!  I hope the real thing is just as easy as these ones ;)  French is utterly boring as usually, including all of the fake coursework we're doing for what purpose?!  Ooh.. and Checketts collapsed!!  Big news that was lol  Got to school to find ambulances with sirens ablazing.  Lots of people were bit shocked, others were scared and some people were even happy about it (which wasn't very nice).  I'll post some time this week.. lol :P

Checketts has come back after her little collapsing and then disappeared again lol, SONIC TIME IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS hehe  I'll post a bit later :D

       What an eventful day!  Food seems to have a mind of its own I swear!  Walking out of school today at dinner, I noticed Michaela, Danielle and James making their way to Tesco.  I caught up with them and James was attacking Kayla lol  Next thing we knew, Kayla's yoghurt was splatted right between James' legs! lmao!!  He walked all the way to Tescos looking like he had been up to something rather lude, then finally changed into his games kit.  And from what I heard, Sophie's tomato soup came alive and soaked a few people at the benches! What a day!  Maybe everyone was so exited that... *drumroll*... THE EXAMS HAVE FINISHED!!  Back to boring old school work yay!

       Hey!  Cool day today actually :)  Arrived at school pretty early for the Maths exam, which really sucked.  Mrs. Lawley spent at least 4 lessons revising things with us and then gave us a paper with hardly anything revised in it!  How so totally stupid *Rolls eyes*, and on the subject of Mrs. Lawley, imagine this...  You're sitting in an exam.  The dingy dusty air is flowing, the sun is in your eyes and your conecntrating on a really hard question when, out of the blue... CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP!  Mrs. Lawley enters the room.  Her shoes make a bloody loud noise on the hall floor, which is so annoying!  It was as if a horse had entered the room lol.  Still, her shoes aint half as bad as one of the receptionist's... BANG BANG BANG BANG (literally) all the way down the corridoor, you can sure tell when she's coming! (Earthquake in Australia!)  Anyway, the rest of the day resumed as usual with an easy peasy RE exam to end the day.  I, with the help of Chris' priceless Mrs. Checketts impression, have made a mock song called "What's New Pussehcat".  I'll let your imagination dwell on that one... G'dnight!

       *Yawn*  Now that I've had a bit of sleep, I can make a decent post!  Last night was hilarious!  Someone had brought a puffin bar and we were throwing it around the tent "ATTACK OF THE PUFFIN MWAHAHA".  Everyone was hypo from all the fizzy pop and suggary snacks we bought from Tesco and that...  Anyway...  The evening started about 9pm, James turned up with the tent etc, shortly followed by Craig and Sam who helped put the tent up (it only took 2 tries and we got it right!).  We went to Tesco to get loads of food and then watched some of Monty Python and the UK Simpsons Episode ("...Henrietta R. Hippo", "Yes Bart, an elephant's butt...") while we pigged out on a tub of raspberry ripple ice-cream!!  We then cooked pizza and eat it in the tent (It was quite tasty for a cheep Tesco pizza!!) and then stayed up for ages talking and going hypo.        (Don't ask... Sam ate a bit too much sugar!)  And as normal, after a night full of sugar and being on a sugar high, the morning sugar low set in.  I felt like s**t!  Now after a bit of brekkie I feel fine :)

We took lots of pics and they shall appear in the gallery section shortly!

       Hey.  Well, as planned, me and Bob went out at 4:30 AM to try and spot the comets.  It was quite light (too light to see most stars) so only the brightest stars were visible, but unfortunately, no comets :(  The view of Stafford at night was brilliant though, so the early morning trip wasn't all bad.  Aparantly the comets are going to be brighter and higher in the sky in May so maybe I'll spot it then!

Ommmm, and I'm a little crazed because I've just drank some caffeinated coffee (omm naughty!) which drives me nuts, but I'm keeping myself awake on purpose.  Believe it or not, there are going to be TWO COMETS in the Northern sky this morning!  If the sky is clear (hopefully will be, sudden changes in the weather forecast, the bloody lyers) me and Bob will make our way across the Motorway bridge to the fields where there is hardly any visual disruption to block our view from all corners of the sky!  Anwyays, i'll post later in the daytime on what happened (if anything!)

       What a beautiful day it was today!  Woke up to loads of sunshine (how can you not be happy on a sunny day?!) and eat breakfast etc.  At school we had the english exam (didn't like it that much but I tried my best!).  We had a cool english lesson; we all did a quiz because it didn't make sense to do an english lession straight after a 1:45 long english exam!  The weather is fantastic.  The sky is totally clear now and stars from all around are visible :D  Just finished playing Minesweeper flags with becx, gonna go have a shower and get an early night now... cya!

       What a good day!    Walked into school (not literally... you know what I mean) and had a few lessons (as you do).  I'm starting to get annoyed with secret codes and languages!  James is starting to get on my nerves again also, I hate to say.  If it's not secret codes he flaunts, its the PoD or Netstat as a 'hacking' method (god help us all).  Trinity never got anywhere by scanning her Network!  The hard attitude especially pisses me off, I don't think I'm alone on that...  We had the first exam today.  Pure geographical shit, nicely sectioned out into high-mark answers... lovely!  The teachers marched up and down the desks like military people (topped off by Mr. Rock at the top of the hall with a 'corporal' look about him).  I think I did quite well, which bugs me because I hate doing well in things I'm not good at.  I GOT AN A IN THE BIOLOGY MODULAR EXAM WOOOOOO HOOOOOO!  I love doing well in things I'm good at!  Aparantly 2 comets are in the sky on Saturday morning, can't wait to stay up really early to see those!  (By the way, you may have noticed swearing in my blog today!  Before you complain... "It's my blog and I'll bitch if I want to!" Mwahaha)

       Hey all.  Sorry I haven't posted in a while, been busy with school and that.  The endless reminder about the upcoming exams is getting annoying now lol.  We have the geography one to do tomorrow afternoon, I'm glad we are getting the most boring ones out of the way first!  I've been eating healthly since monday morning and I feel a little better.  School's been alrite.  Now that the stressless holidays have faded back into hardcore education, headaches have been returning :(

       Ahhhh, life is good :)  I've just had a killer salad with my mum for tea.  From now on I'm gonna eat properly instead of having a 'computer geek' diet of crisps and chocolate and fizzy drinks!  (Even though i don't really eat them much anyway lol, I want to be healthy!)  Day has been quite interesting actually.  Nothing much has happened but the feeling in the air has been happy.  I've got quite a bit of chocolate left from the easter break but I'm only going to eat it in small amounts and probably only at each weekend so that my diet is not affected.  Last night I found this cool program which enables you to play MP3s on your GBA Flash Cartridge!  At least now I have something I can play music on for the time being.  Speaking of MP3s, Dans had a wicked MP3 Player for his birthday!  It has little logos and animations on it like the Nokia phones.  I'm jealous now :(  I took my pc apart (just a few bits) and was suprised that theres so little hardware that makes a computer possible.  The tower seemed to be making it look massive!  I've seen a cool 160GB Hard Drive on sale for £63!  I've decided to scrap my tower when we move and I'm gonna try my best to refurbish my computer to make it 'breathe-easy'.  I seriously can't wait to move!  Have I mentioned that already?  I'm so excited...!

       Today's not been that good to be honest.  I planned a sleepover for me, Craig, Chris and James, which got ruined by the stupid weather.  I always seem to get depressed on cloudy and rainy days...  Grandma and Grandad are buying me a new MP3 Player for a very early birthday present.  They're so great, without them I'd be travelling everywhere and going to sleep without a single note of music :(  School is just around the corner and I can't wait to get back (OF COURSE I'm being sarcastic!).  Sometimes I wish I could just wake up and be somewhere else.  Speaking of which, we better get approved soon so I can finally start crossing off the days.  Waiting is painful...

       I'm tired alright!  I went out earlier today, came back in, then went out after tea with Jamie and Craigus.  James kept on mumbling "I hate Becky Ross, she's too intelligent" mwahaha.  That's what you get for sp00king someone with brains James :D   Hehe Becky ;)  Jamie might be hosting a sleepover this weekend so that should be good if it happens!  We could go out into the early hours of the morning and listen to the silence of the minute amount of cars on the motorway, and maybe see some stars if it's not cloudy!  I think I've pulled my tummy muscles :(  It hurts when I sit crooked, so I best not sit crooked lol.  G'dnight!  Mmm turkish delight!.. sorry, Auntie Paulines Easter gift is being devoured before me eyes!

       Great day!  I went out at 7ish to meet up with James, then we went to call for Craig and we stayed outside there for a bit chattin about anything.  I've realised that the holidays have given me a great big confidence boost.  Maybe it's the absence of dick-heads from school, or the fact I'm starting to go out more.  I'm lovin' it!  Me and James left Craig's and went to James' house and I managed to get his Eye-Toy working as a webcam.  It's a cool looking thing!  I'm gonna force myself to wake up early tomorrow so I can try and get back into a normal sleeping pattern.  Hopefully it shall work!

       Hey all.  Not a bad day!  After frantically wolfing down my breakfast and having a wash, me and James (Michaela buzzed off somewhere) walked to Chris' house and went inside.  We played on Tony Hawks for a bit then when it was Chris' turn on the PC we went on it and Chris recorded a brill version of Gary Jules - Mad World in the voice of Mrs. Checketts, with altered lyrics!  We had so much fun messing around with the voices and stuff again.  After, me and James came back to my house for a bit and waited for Chris to finish his dinner, then walked all the way back again (Chris!!) to force him to come out.  We went to call for Craig again, who came out with Sam, but then went striaght back in to watch LoTR RoTK, so me Chris and James ventured past his house to the Motorway bridge.  It's nice watching the traffic.  Chris used the word 'Romantic' but I didn't quite think so with the roaring traffic going past (He also mentioned the name of the person he fancies but I can't repeat it without risking my life :P)  I'm about to fall asleep sitting here at my computer.  I better do some revision tomorrow for the upcoming tests at school.  Yeh, that place we're currently away from.  Now would be a great time for the school to catch fire *HINT HINT ARSONISTS*

       Hey all.  I shouldn't have spoken too soon about the cloudy weather!  A brilliant night it is tonight, the sky is absolutely littered with stars!  And of course whenever the sky is clear, the air is bitterly cold!!  The backs of my hands are pretty numb and it is prooving to be a little hard to type right now lol.  Me and James went out for a walk.  We went across a motorway bridge near to a field where there were hardly any street lights in sight, boy was it a pretty sight, however, we didn't hang around for long because the darkness was starting to sink in and the feeling of ghosts and scary night beings forced us to turn back towards the light :D  Maybe my Dad could take me over one time.  I am still yet to spot the Andromeda constellation.  Anyways, we had a good time!  James got some frubes and we squirted a few over the pavement (LMAO daft I know - haven't had so much fun in a long time :P)  Anyway, my hands are starting to feel more normal now and Im gonna go chill a bit, goodbye!

       Not a bad day :)  Went out with Jamie n Kayla in the afternoon and walked around for a bit.  We called for craig then went back to Kayla's house via Tesco.  I'm fiddling around with this Internet Radio tool which can be used to broadcast radio across the internet (yay!).  Anyways, I'm now growing tired and shall be going off to bed in a few minutes I hope...

       Yay, changed the blog template (as if you didn't notice:P)  I hope you like it, I thought it was a bit too much on the green side, but it has to be to look good I guess lol.  Not much going on really so far today.  I had this weird dream this morning about living in this gigantic castle with everyone at school... that's a thing, why is it whenever there is a school holiday, I always have dreams about school, or people at school... odd...

       Woke up this morning and had a bit of a lie in.  I had a shower and got ready to go to my Grandma's house in Stoke.  I couldn't go to James' Barbeque because it felt right to go and see my Nan because I haven't seen her for ages.  The drive there was tiring.  The sickness I get from travelling is terrible.  It leaves me nauseated for a while afterwards.  At Grandma's we had a big dinner with trifle and cake afterwards!  I had two helpings of trifle then couldn't eat another thing when the cake came :(  Had a fun time with everyone and the day went quite well.  I got some fudge from when Grandma and Grandad went down to Cornwall... YUMM!  (It was gone within minutes of opening it at home).  I've been playing the new Avril Lavigne album over and over again because it's so great!  I got it about 2 days ago and ever since I've been engrossed in the cool music.  I'm about to go to bed now because I'm being picked up at 11am to be taken to Stoke again to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Odeon and have a McDonalds... EUGH!  I suppose on fat-filled food won't harm me, unless I have one of the new crap McDonalds salads (their desperate fight against the health scientists out there saying McDonalds is crap).  They will probably cost a bomb anyway due to their exclusiveness.  What a big step from those tiny little fruit bags in the Happy Meals hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... *cough*  Anyways, better get off to bed.

       I've had such a good day.  It didn't get off to a very good start but turned out brilliant.  Me, Craig and Chris went to town and arrived at the cinema at half past to find nobody!  We waited for about 15 mins then walked around town looking for everyone.  In the end we all went home because Craig had a paper round to do.  A few hours later we went back to town and watched "The Day After Tomorrow".  It was a bloody good film!  It was so realistic and the special effects we amazing.  I won't spoil it for anyone so if you wanna go and see it, go ahead lol.  Half way through the movie cut out and every was like "WTF" but it came on again afterwards.  Apart from that cockup the film was great.  I recommend it to anyone.  We went home after that, legs and arses aching because the cinema seats are so uncomfy with hardly any legroom (one of the disadvantages of being tall... argh!).  Chris went in and me and Craig called for James, thenw ent to see Jo and Annie who were off their heads.  We then went to Kaylas for a bit until it was time to go in.  I had a really nice Bird's Eye microwave roast lamb dinner, which are really scrumptious!  They're so tasty yet so cheap... well done Bird's Eye :D

       That private blog lasted ages! lol  Me, Sam and James are friends again and I've taken all the nasty stuff out of my blog and put it back up (as you can see).  I've been really weird lately and hopefully I'm not in a depressive and nasty mood anymore.  Me, Sam, Craig, James, Chris, and Kayla are going to watch "The Day After Tomorrow" at Apollo this afternoon.  Should be fun :o)  The forum is up, join NOW!  It's meant for myself and my friends or people at school but if there are any adults reading, feel free to see what us teens talk about lol.  I'll post later after the movie... ta ra

       God I feel awful.  I've had a late night and I feel really tired.  I feel really guilty about writing all the stuff about James and all the bad stuff that's been in the blog so I wrote 2 letters of apology to James and Sam.  Whether they accept them or not is another matter.  I hope they do beause I've been really stupid.  I was feeling really happy last week and this week has just been awful.  Somebody hit me...  The forum is installed and I wrote a few default topics and things for people to start debating on.  Hopefully it will be as cool, or maybe better than the last forum was.  I'm going to go off to bed now.  A good nights kip should do me good.  I hope Jamie and Sam read their emails tomorrow morning.  Sorry!

       This is the first personal blog post.  God it feels so quiet now!  This is also a kind of test post to see if the privateness is working lol.  Anyways...  Had a really bad argument with Sam and James.  I feel like shit, they said a lot of nasty things.  The outcome of the argument was stubbon ol' me keeping my blog.  I had a chat with Becky and she suprised me.  At first it was as if she was on their side... but I saw her point of view.  The blog has been 'privitised' as it were and a forum is probably going to go up in its place.  They're much more fun anyways lol.

       Peculiar day.  My alarm clock didn't friggin wake me up again!  But unfortunately/fortunately, Chris rang (to see if it was mufti... :S) and woke me up with enough time to get ready for school.  IT'S HALF TERM!!  WOOHOO!!  Geography was cool.  Stephen's salad lunch spilt out all over the floor while Kryptface Kylie stood there making nasty jokes and laughing at him.  RE was really fun.  Miss Oakley wasn't in and we had Mrs. Hodson.  We went to her room and watched the first bit of Priates of the Caribbean.  Science and ICT were average.  English was cool, we did drama.  Miss read out my Marmite poem lol.  Maths was fun too, we had to make a square with all of these cubes and make sure no 2 same coloured cubes were in one row or column.  Natalie won £2 off Mrs. lawley for doing it before everyone else did.  Regestration was dissapointing.  Might do something over the weekend, not sure.  I'll blog it of course...

       What an interesting but boring day!  The BBC were recording at school for BBC Breakfast!  More on that report later... :P  Food was okay.  Did some research and stuff for the project we are working on and these strange people came in with Mr. Gledhill.  French was quite good today actually.  I think Mrs. Bladon's a bit obsessed with mind maps, we've done a lot now, heh!  I still have some work I need to do over the holidays... damn!  Break time came, and no cameras were in sight.  I had a wicked sandwich for lunch today.  It was stuffed with cheese and onion and salad bits and pieces.  English was up next where we did some more cool work on the Carol Ann Duffy poems, which I have to say, not being a great poem lover myself, are excellent (plus they're also cool due to the fact they have swearing in them and naughty words; Mrs. Auduoin Swore! Hehehe)  Maths was good.  We're back doing Number again which I'm really good at.  I can't believe that a few months ago I really hated and found Maths difficult whereas now I'm flying through it.  Now then, dinnertime!  Cameras lined the canteen, their big black lenses gawping at everyone whilst they ate.  It was quite surreal.  It was as if these strange beings from another planet with square black bodies were observing daily human life.  So strange...  Chris was brave enough to enter the canteen, and 'get a cup of water' from the cooler, mouthing "Hutton Report" to the camera each time he passed one.    We then went to the bench area to escape the scary visitors in the canteen.  We had a laugh around the vender.  Becky sold some of Chris' drawings to daft Year 7s for small sums of money lmao!  The orders were flying in.  Chris bought a mini bag of Fizzy Haribo from the vending machine which sells a little (bloody miniscule) for 50p!  What a ripoff!  You can go to Tescos and buy a big bit of actual fruit for cheaper than that... Sheesh!  Minutes later the scary camera crew turned up again and started filming grime on the walls in J Block!  I have a small feeling this report or whatever they're doing ins't going to be something great.  Period 5 was so boring, and Biology passed in what seemed seconds.  Me, me bros and Dad are going to Stoke on Bank Holiday Monday to see Harry Potter 3!  Can't wait for Half Term to start.  8 more weeks left of school, god this year has gone quick, and to think that after the Summer holidays I will be in YEAR 11!!  Last year of school!  But that's if I'm still here ;)  Had a cool chat on MSN with a friend who has been receiving some petty abuse from bloke-woman.  You know who I'm talking about Becx ;o)

       Today was alright.  Maths was normal and IT was as normal as ever as well (we did a word search... yippee!)  Sam told me at break that all the teachers know about my blog... what blog?  I don't have a clue what he was on about... Mwahaha  Okay, so the teachers really have discovered my lovely little place in which I chat to myself, basically.  Hope you all like the blog and find it a really cool read!  God knows who told them about it.  Some people may think I did it myself to get visits... funny thought but no, I want to know who told them!  Please note, if you don't wish certain views of your pupils to be read by you, I suggest you buzz off because it just might happen!  Anyways, the rest of the day was alrite.  Information Systems was cool because Mrs. Checketts used the flashy new projector things; little did she know that the laser beam on the controller kept shining in my eye when she was making gestures with her hands.  Hmm... I think I'm getting punished for making that nasty comment and her reading it lol, unless there is some kind of secret vendetta against me since the discovery of my blog by the teachers... help! Lmao  Ok let's put the topic of teachers and finding blog out of the way now because there have been more things in my day to talk about :)  Anyways I'm off because I've got lots of work to do for school and lunch to do and stuff... bye!  Quote of the day... "Chris move your FAT HEAD!!", by Sharday and Charlotte!

       What and interesing day!  I woke up at 8:25... yes!  How the hell my alarm clock decided to un-set itself is a bloody mystery.  I have my suspiciouns as Daniel and Ryan are both awake when my alarm clock is due to go off.... hmmm  After rushing to school I was nearly suffocated by Chris, Craig, and James because for some bizzare reason they suddenly decided to jump on me!  Anyway, stupidity out the way, the first two lessons were moderately boring, English better than French.  Mrs. Audoiun did a striking performance of the masqued ball scene in Romeo and Juliet with her desktop stationary.  HB Pencil Romeo and HB Pencil Juiliet (also with a rubber on top!) had fun jumping around on the desk whilst a dodgy figure of some cloaked Dracula like thing acted out Capulet.  T'was funny...  Biology was okay.  We had it in Mrs. Bond's room because it's soooo spacious :D  All the way through Shardae kept shouting out... argh!  "MISS SLOWWWW DOWNNNN", "MISS I DONT GET ITTTTTT", "MISS THIS IS CONFUSING MEEE SO MUCH", "CRAIG MOVE UR HEAD GODDDD"... etc.  Geography was hilarious.  Me and Steve had been moved to the opposite side of the room to sit next to none other than Kylie Bridger.  Mehhhhhhh Whatsup Doc'?  A lot frankly.  We discussed our new coursework which involves walking along the A449 and looking at aspects of the area etc.  The lesson was nearly at an end when Mel and Kylie set of a rape alarm!  I'm sorry but what the hell would Mel want one of those for.  It's isn't as if she is going to be raped... lol!  It remided me of one of those annoying car or house alarms that stay on for ages and ages and ages that dig at your head and give you a headache within minutes.  Games wasn't practical (The whole dept. has gone to Wales *sniggers*) so i went along.  We were in Wibbo's class and we drew stuff and I did a bit of English work.  Maths was... Maths basically.  And funnily enough, there was a bit of a rumble in there!  Charlotte was caught with her phone out and Mrs. Lawley demanded it off her but she wouldn't give it her.  She used the excuse that her mum was gonna ring her... oh purrlease!  She went out in a right huff slamming the door and everything as they do.  Mrs. Lawley swiftly following to deal with it.  Everyone went hush to listen to the row further outside lol... t'was funny!

       God what a long day.  Went to school feeling a bit odd, then sat through ICT feeling a bit weirder.  Mrs. Checketts arrived a bit earlier than usual and gave the class a minature talk on why she is late (something about exams) and then a small talk about computer misuse and wait for it...  offensive websites  and emails!  It felt like a little of that, or maybe all of it, was aimed at me.  I feel a little bit guilty lol.  Then strangely when I came to log on the computers, it wouldn't work at all.  I had to get my password changed and I got through a little work.  Science was ok, we did something about motors.  French... god I just can't wait to leave, let's just leave it at that.  Becky chose the perfect time to steal my pen off me (I wasn't feeling particuarly well today.  I think I was a bit depressed).  I felt like being alone for a while, which is hard to achieve at school.  Other lessons were just... blah.  Food was ok, had fun smashing the hell out of fruit in the blender.  I feel absolutely whacked.  I have some homework I need to do and I'm boiling hot.  Talk about STRESS!!  Not even music can calm me down I'm so edgy tonight!  I wish there was a way to lie back and forget all the troubles of life and relax for a few minutes so I could sit back up and say "Right, let's get cracking!", but unforunatley... :'(

       Wow, another cool Sunday!  Sundays are usually the worst day of the week, down there with Mondays.  I woke up at 1:23, and for some reason, I'm always looking at the clock when a consecutive time is displayed... and me being the most easily interested person in the world, finds that interesting! lol.  Anyways, back on track...  Mum cooked a really kool brunch with mushrooms and bacon and sausage and really tasty baked beans + cheese on toast!  YUMM!!  Thanks mum :D!  Afterwards I decided I was going to go to town, with or without friends.  I'm totally different from everyone else, so i decided to ring and ask people whether they wanted to go town with me :o)  First I asked Michaela, but she was with Sam.  I rang James but he was out, so I gave Chris a try... and bingo!  I called for him and got a lift into town from his mum and dad (thanks!) and we trekked through the quiet streets, inhabited by the few Sunday shoppers (yeah, there were probably like 50 people in the whole of town) and to Woolworths.  Due to the quietness of the streets, Chris' voice was 10x louder than ever, so like everyone heard what he was saying :P lol!  I'm sorry but if I was going to pick a totally shit place to buy music CDs from, it would be Woolworths!  Chris bought some M 'n' Ms and we walked through town talking about... anything really.  We talked about the fireplace shop which caught fire, trying to decide whether it was worthy of the title "ironic", or not.  In the end, we thought it was.  I compared it to getting run over by an ambulance, which would be totally ironic.  I also wondered: "What if yo' mamma sat on a rainbow and M 'n' Ms popped out instead of Skittles?", to which Chris gave the ultimate answer, "A massive law suit would be launched." (Don't tell me you have never heard that Yo' Mama joke!)  I bought the new Blink 182 album (well when I say new, I mean the new-er one) from WHSmith, who have a great selection of music compard to the store obsessed with sheep (Woolworths is totally baaaaring sometimes!)  I've had a haircutand my face is itching again :(  A whole line of spots has formed on the right side of my face and I'm starting to look like a dot-to-dot game again;  It's punishment for eating too much chocolate!  I'm gonna go now, and have a lazy evening on this fine Sunday.  There's a nice big bottle of champagne in the fridge, dreading the day of our approval because it's going to be popped with a lot of force!  Hopefully... and I hope to GOD, that we are approved this week!  C'mon Texas Service Center!  (yes that's centre with the last two letters flipped).  Bye everyone, including you lot *points at all the teachers reading my blog*   :o)

       Tonight was ok.  I went out and met up with Sam, Craig, and his sisters (oh god).  The night went ok, we started a game of manhunt which I struggled with, but to be honest the atmosphere was ready to split... and it did.  The Year 8s of the group (including Dickhead Dean) started shouting and causing loads of noise (You could feel the eyes of everyone looking out of their windows lmao).  Sam went in, everyone was like 'WTF' and the whole thing was in chaos for a while.  We all trapsed around for a while, again like 'WTF' until we decided to go to Tesco.  We all bought somethin' and James went and bought a massive bar of chocolate again (hehehe! yum yum) but he didn't give it to anyone for ages (noooooooo!).  We went up to the Garth where there was this wedding going on!  A blue van turned out of the road with loads of cans dangling off the back lmao (wedding vehicle with style).  Craig and Sam bliked up and down these slopes and eventually Kayla and Craig's sisters (oh god) turned up.  We stood there chattin for a while.  An old woman kept pointing out of her window and Craig's sister (oh god) and freaking them out a bit lol.  Sam then had a real go at Kayla for no aparant reason, which was really out of order, and then told her to "F*** Off"!  God knows what was up with him.  Michaela went after him, shortly followed by Craig's sisters (oh god).  Me, Craig and James sat up by the Garth for a few mins until Craig went in.  Me and James went to Sam's house where we met with Dean (the dickhead) and Michalea and Craig's sisters (oh god) outside on the drive.  Dean sat there being as insensitive and as childish as possible whilst Kayla sat there sad (I don't blame her, a certain person was being horrible... Sam!)  James dished out a bit of chocolate then after Dean had made a few more insensitive comments about Kayla, mentioned something about his... *cough* disability *cough*.  Dean chased after James with a deadly... broom, then an axe! lmfto!  He went then so did Craig's sisters (oh god).  Kayla hugged Sam, who eventually showed his face outside the house.  Me and Kayla went round the corner and met back up with Jo, Dani, James, Craig (who had come back out, without his sisters (oh god) this time).  We stood chatting for a bit and James kept flashing his freaky belly button lol.  After that we all made our ways home.  It's now bloody cold outside and there's a crescent moon out tonight... in case your were interested lol.    Night Night!

       Hey, I thought I'd post something as I am totally bored.  My ankle is a lot better now and I fancy going out, but theres one little problem... there's no-one I can go out with!  As usual, all my mates have pissed off somewhere and I'm left here with nothing to do, as it is weekend after weeked.  I'm getting pissed off with it, so if you're reading, Suprise!  Sam is probably somewhere messing around with Jo or Annie, or biking with Craig (but he cancelled the sleepover because he was 'tired' according to James... hmm), James is prob stuck on the PS2 or on Online games or something, Chris is probably stuck on RPG Maker or something like that,  and here I am stuck INSIDE!  I'm Indoors... Get Me Out Of Here!  Anyways, *End Rant* (soz becky thought I'd nick that :P)  I've put Blink 182 on real loud that should cure some of my depressiveness! There's some cool movies coming out soon so I might go and see them alone... unless anyone fancies coming with me... maybe I might go with my family... I dunno :D.  I spent a good 10 mins making a mobile out of CDs, straws and wire from a pair of broke headphones.  I'd rate it about 4/10, but it was cool anyway.  I was about to stick the thing up and it keeps falling down so stuff that.  You can probably tell from the post I aint in a good mood, so don't come near me or I might bite your head off >:D  What the hell is going on with me today, I feel so... Crazy/Depressed/Edgy/Happy/Excited/Sad... I think I need some Anger Therapy (time to bash the hell out of my pillows!).  That will probably calm me down a bit... hehe argh :S  Maybe it's my time of the month, as Sam said lol  Ok this is like the fourth time I have edited this post now.  It turns out Sam was gonna call for me but he thought my ankle was still bust up so he didn't.  I was just talking to him on MSN then he suddenly went offline like he always does :S  What's with that...

       I overslept this morning, giving me a pretty strange dream.  I'm not gonna elaborate on that... it's wasn't that good lol.  My sprained ankle is healing nicely and I can walk again, but it still hurts :(  For some reason my blog posts recently have become a bit boring.  So I'm gonna try and make small things seem amusing lol, well, I dunno.  There's supposed to be a sleepover at Sam's this weekend, I'm not sure if anything else is going on.  I might go out if my ankle feels any better.  I'm still relaxing it on loads of cushions I pinched from the front room hehe.  Anyway, cya soon...

       Hey, my ankle is still bloody hurting!  GRR  I fell asleep on my bed with ice around it and with it elevated a bit (following the RICE guidlines of course) and woke up about an hour later and it felt great.  It reduced the swelling a lot and made me feel better :)  Mum got some bandage for it and it's doing ok now.  Hopefully it will be better for Sam's sleepover this weekend, if there is one that is.  Make your mind up! lol  I'm off now... ta ta

       Ouch!  I woke up and my ankle aches like mad, and unfortunately has me off school :(  My dad rang Mr. Swaries and it was about the reference to Mrs. Checketts being a cow in one of the earlier posts, so I removed it.  I'd just like to say (whilst all the teachers are probably reading my blog now) that anything wrote here is an opinion based on my mood at the time of post.  If I am in a bad mood of course, posts shall be quite bitchy or a bit nasty, but I don't mean to cause any harm from these posts nethertheless.

       Hey everyone.  Well I don't know what to say really.  Yet another eventful day!  This week seems to be jam packed with events, the good and the bad.  I had a bit of a shock at school when Miss Oakley quoted an opinion I stressed in an older post I made a few days ago.  I didn't know what to think really.  One of the things going through my mind though was: "What the..!  How does she know..!".  I'd just like to say that the comment about her being "a crazy funeral lovin' teacher" was a joke and I think Miss Oakley is a wonderful teacher, although I do feel sorry for her sometimes when kids take advantage of her good nature :(  James got attacked today by Will, which was quite a shock really.  I hope Brannan gets better soon!  We went to see him after school and he came out.  Me, Craig, Chris, James and Sam (eventually came out after being trapped by his crazy possesive girlfriend) played Manhunt with a few other kids.  We did quite well actually, although I was suprised when I saw my dad and the rest of the family in the car waving to me.  I went to investigate this strange phenomena (Mwaha) and was a little taken aback!  Mr. Swaries had left a message for my mum about something and wanted her to phone back tomorrow.  God knows what it is about!  I'm still trying to think.  My dad is going to ring him back tomorrow, because it was ICT, my dads great at it so he knows whats what.  My mums a cool techno pc person too but my dads got a job in the subject so... you get the picture.  Anyways back to the game of Manhunt...  I was about to capture James when I hurtled over a bloody kurb and sprained my ankle; god it wrecked!  It still hurts now and there is a massive lump below my ankle so now it looks like I have got 2 ankles lol.  I hope the injury doesnt get me off school tomorrow because I want to know what this mystery phone call concerning ICT was all about.  Anywho... I'm off to bed now.  Bad girls has finished until August!!  I can't believe it!!  Quote of the day: "I hate to burst the bubbles in ya bath but...!", exclaimed Chris whilst taking a break during Manhunt!

       Good afternoon everybody!  A very relaxed and calm Carl here after a more unusual day at school than usual.  Last night was ok.  Babysat and watched Bad Girls 1/3 with Tanya in it from Footballers' Wives (totally quiet for a change!) and Eastenders and Corrie etc.  I rushed my French hw and sat on my PC for a bit, and then got into bed listening to the Late Show on BBC Radio Stoke.  Woke up as normal this morning.  My Lost Prophets CD came in the post (and is really cool I must say).  It is bloody sunny again (but not as hot, thank thee lord)  Anyways, now school.  French was utterly boring and Frenchie was too.  A breif summary of those lessons would be:  Coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, and coursework (to be precise).  Brannan shocked the life out of us all by announcing that he had managed to hack into the school system.  I really doubted it at first but I gave him a chance.  We did something about leaves in Biology and then looked at settlements and stuff in Geography.  Afterwards we went to thelibrary so James could show us his little hacking trick... which was a complete farse.  It turned out he couldn't hack into the system (suprise suprise) and made a bit of a fool of himself to be honest.  I suppose it might be impossible since all of the accounts are from a mapped network drive which requires a specific user to access (from an admin terminal of course).  I heard from the lunchtime goers that a man went mad in Tesco when he wasn't being served (most people wait in the cues?!), but this man was different.  He went mad and what happened next could best be described as 'Sandwich Terrorism'.  He threw his sandwich which he was about to purchase at the person on the tills and stormed off cursing about school kids or something.  Must be that time of the month...  After lunch I went to the RE death discussion thing.  It was a lot different from what I expected it to be; it was in fact quite interesting.  The funeral director bloke from over the road came in to chat to us about funerals and death and stuff (mostly about how funerals were conducted etc.) and half way through something HILARIOUS happened!  Sean who was sitting right beside moi, was groping a yoghurt pot, which Richard Holland, sitting right in from of moi, decided to turn around and grab it out of his hand.  Before we knew what was happening, the yoghut pot burst and it went EVERYWHERE!  Poor Stuart, who was sitting right 'in the line of fire', got full blast of it and most of it hit the wall and blind behind us.  Everyone was laughing their heads off for ages and Miss. Oakley and the funeral director bloke stood there looking bewildered.  Great afternoon entertainment in my opinion!  Maths was the usual work, except near the end Mr. Salt did a sort of chicken dance to teach us the axis of the graphs we were drawing.  Assembly (with the oh so entertaining Mr. Rock) was a complete laugh and joke as usual... not!  All he did was natter on about coursework and exams.  Again, all I could think was "not me!" when he said things like: "You will be sitting here in 53 weeks doing these exams" lol.  Which reminds me... I want to go to America now!!!!  I'm starting to feel 'homesick' from America, which is quite odd really.  I just want to get back over there as soon as possible.  Bad Girls is on again tonight as part of this 3 part special with Tanya Turner in it, so I shall be retiring early to bed to watch that (after compelting my oh so precious Information Systems homework).  It's Becky's birthday soon so I'll make her something cool on flash to give her instead of a boring old card.  Buh Bye...

       Ugh... today was hot again!  I think there is something wrong with my head; it keeps hurting!  We sat through a really boring and tight lesson of Information Systems, where Checketts spent at least 15 mins (not including the 10 minutes in which she is always late) yelling at us and telling us how she will put us all on Homework Report with Mr. Rock... Geez lady, if you saw the other lessons you'd die from shock!  She has a high expectation of people.  She expects us to hand in our homework seconds after it was set!  Mad...  The crazy funeral lovin' RE teacher has arranged a meeting in W1 tomorrow after dinner.  I can see the point in the work but it seems wrong.  I know death is somethin we are all gonna face but studying it at school isn't relevant, in my opinion.  I'm worried that my headaches have something to do with my eyesight.  I don't want to wear glasses!  I'll look like a right prune :o(

       Well what can I say!  It was a bloody brilliant movie!  Craig and Sam called for me and we went into town, in the baking hot sun!  Wow, the weather today was so great, it was hard to believe we were in England (Roll on leaving day! Hehe).  We got our tickets and then went to Farmfoods and Home Bargains to get stuff to eat in the cinema, then afterwards, shoved the stuff in our pockets and we all looked fat lmao.  We got into the cinema (almost sweating after the exposure to the bloody hot weather, which was now starting to get on our nerves) and got some seats to the right of the screen, then moves so we were a bit in-line.  The film was based on a kind of Dracula, Dr. Frankenstien, warewolf and old legend style stories all merged into one cool story.  The SFX were amazing too, and because it was a dark and dingy film, it seemed really cool in the cinema.   I can't wait to do it again sometime.  We might go and see The Day After Tomorrow and Harry Potter 3 when they come out.  Might go and see Shrek 2 as well   {:D} DONKEH!

       Wow what a day!  Woke up excited about the sleepover tonight.  When I got on the comp I was actually invited to go to town!!  Wow!!  Lmao... I didn't go though because I didn't feel like it.  Sam didn't want to have the sleepover this weekend so we're gonna have it next weekend instead.  The weather today was great and everyone turned up to Sam's little BBQ party (EVENTUALLY *cough* James and Craig *cough*) and we had some food and played the pole tennis game thing Sam had.  After the food we all legged it into the house, literally, to watch Sam's Flash birthday message I made, which sings Happy Birthday then as it finishes pops up a funny picture of Sam and screams Mwahahahaha! :D  We then went up to Sam's room and chatted a bit and listened to Kerrang! Radio (105.2 FM, brand new station it's wicked!) and I got onto Sam's laptop mwahahah, he thought nobody knew his password but I got it!  Tee Hehe...  After that we all went outside to play a very tiring game of Manhunt where we all got a bit out-of-breath and stuff.  My asthma is dreadful this time of year :(  It then started to go dark so we made our way back to Sam's house and we just hung around there for a bit until we started to go home.  Today was great!  Pics are up in the gallery for the people out there who can't put together a mental image of what our day was like :P

       Whoa!  It seems that Year 11 at school didn't do as much as they made out!  *Sniggers*...  Aparantly in RE we are planning our own funerals!  Well, I definitely won't be that's for sure.  I think it is totally shocking and we should be doing more apropriate topics in lessons than planning our own sodding funerals!  They are acting as if we are going to drop dead any second.  From what I've heard, people have been designing coffins, saying what music they want and everything!   Why don't we start planning our weddings, job interviews, christenings... and the lot!  No wait, better not say that or they just might lmao!  Why don't we focus on having a good life and have RE lessons on how to respect other cultures and beilieves (I certainly know a few people who could do with those) than plan the religious ceremony that our families will have to endure in the FAR future.  On a lighter note... Weekend!  Yay!  2 whole days away from school (lmao as if I haven't had enough time off already this week hehe).  I totally agree with what Becky said about the way things have sped up so fast at school.  The exams, coursework, and homework have been rushing past us all so fast it has been a very daunting and confusing experience for us all.  If the government really want an overworked and tired generation of youngsters going into the workforce, then they are definitely going the right way about it.  Stop giving us so much bloody work!  Anyways, I better stop ranting before I end up with a post as large as this mornings lol!  Buh bye...

       Woooo... I just woke up and I feel kinda stuffy.  I've just had about 5 dreams all in the space of this morning, but they were kinda strange actually...  In one of them I was getting married!  Totally weird, I never got to see who I was marrying but the person's family was kinda crazy (I think the mum was Italian or somethin :S)  I am crazy really, I have never had a dream like that before.  I started panicking because I was about to get married then I remembered that we were moving to America so I couldn't get married, so I was trying to talk to my mum but she couldn't hear me for some reason.  It was about then the dream changed...  The next dream involved some kind of school competition, which had most of the people at school in.  Loads of people from school were round these colourful rainbow-like victorian cottages doing stuff, finding crystals I think (this is how perculiar dreams can get!).  It was probably a memory of the rocky cycle we were doing in chemistry because she talked about crystals in there.    Next, I can remember being on a bike with Sam, and Leander and Jo were there (they weren't on bikes) and we bumped into this trendie group or somethin but they didn't do anything.  We hopped over a few walls then the dream genre changed again.  We were by a river and oliver was there too.  My bike was stuck in the river and I was worried what Grandma and Grandad were gonna say (presumingly they bought it me).  We had to get across this really easy-breaking bridge and it kept on sinking in the water of this rapidly flowing river.  It was like made of cardboard sheets.  I kinda made it to the end when we were suddenly sitting in a hall with 'results' papers and aparantly I wasn't meant to be in the 'river crossing' challenge... ok....!  I have some weird dreams!  I then appeared in this factory/medical environment and I was some kind of officer wearing this stylish blue uniform with orange stripes around the sleves and a cool security ID card clipped to my chest.  There was a rogue loose on the area and everyone was on alert to look for him.  It turns out this was a child and he had a syringe full of some dangerous chemical.  The child (he might have been in the form of Ryan in my dream I'm not sure) injected it into this woman and ran off and I was the only one who witnessed it (she was quite pretty actually, but it was no-one i've never seen before).  I got her help then the kid re-appeared with the syringe loaded again.  He started chasing me and I ran and ran (this is what backs up my thing about Ryan.  Yesterday he was chasing me into my room and trying to get in.  The dream could have been moulded around that memory with added fear from me, because I'm terrified of needles).  The dream then changed into some kind of near-nightmare scenario.  I ran into this large underground mechanical type place which looked kind of like a tourist attraction underground view thing.  I ran being this wall and into this chamber style place.  I think I was still in the same place as before (the factory/medical environment) but I was just me, not the officer person.  We were trying to get into this chamber which had these two men in these strange blue uniforms with big equipment attatched to their shoulders (might have been something like off Red Alert 2 I think) and I was with this scary person who gave me these light guns.  We were shooting at the base of the protective screen around this chamber and it collapsed like a wall of cards.  We went in and then got trapped somehow.  We found a way out into this monk type place and he was talking about God and stuff and we were desperately asking for a way out.  He showed us finally.  The dream that followed that was just as strange.  Me, Mum, Daniel and Ryan were walking through a public area... in America!  (Although in my dream, something told me it was the USA).  We walked through the crowds and I saw two large black skyscraper type buildings, which were both kinda tilted (they were probably formed in my dream by my memory of the photos I took in America as I was going past things in the car, they came out slanted on the actual photo later) and then I saw two more funny shaped buildings.  We walked out of the buildings and onto this country like area.  Sam, Craig and a few others were biking up and down this field and I kept thinking that all my mates could visit me every weekend in America because in my dream America seemed to be not far south from Cornwall lol.  In that scene, Mum and the rest of the family mentioned previously had dissapeared and it was just my friends.  We walked through these pathways to this house (which looked kinda like craigs, but it wasn't on the same side of the road) and Sam and everyone was there and it was the sleepover.  Everyone went inside and I stayed outside, that's when Mum appeared again.  I can't remember what was said but it might have been funny dream talk.  This post has been amazingly large, I hope you read it all lol.  I'm going to look up what these dreams mean so cya...

       Argh!  I'm full of cold and I feel like crap :(  Off school again and lazing around trying to make the cold get bored so it will go away!  You know, when your at school you don't wanna be there, but when your at home, you do.  Can't win can any way...  My Splash Plastic keeps messing up so I can't buy the Lost Prophets ablum argh!!  I want it now!!  Harry Potter movie will be out soon, can't wait for that.  Will be kool to inject some magic into reality again.  I keep thinking I should re-read the books again; I might do that sometime.  The Day After Tomorrow looks good, might watch that too.  I've managed to collect the £20 I owe Grandma and Grandad for the MP3 Player so from now on I just have to pay back £30 for the Telescope Shell bought me and save up £15 so I can buy the upcoming Avril Lavigne album and the Harry Potter Soundtrack for the 3rd movie... (what!  I like the music lol)  Since getting my MP3 player I have been listening to the radio loads!  I'm becomming a radio-holic.  It's actually quite entertaining listening to discussions and kool songs.  I'm so pleased with this MP3 Player!

       Today was terrible!  In a funny/horrible way lol.  Maths was skipped for a test I had to catch up with, followed by IT where loads of people went on Zak's Amazing Incredible Swearing Keyboard, and made Mrs. Evans aware of it, who no doubt went and told Mr. Swaries landing me in a bit of bother :S.  Mr. Swaries being the great ICT head he is, thought an SWF file extension was some sort of program that could allow people to access naughty websites... right!  I gave him the URL of Zak's Swearing keyboard to block (after offering to remove it from my website but he seemed to be deaf to the MY WEBSITE part lol, but he turned that down anyway!  I was only being co-operative...) and was then told he had heard that I was able to make it onto the admin area of the school network! Wherever he heard that from I haven't a clue.  I set the rumour right and was on my way (after a little word of warning about the police lol).  I know the laws and yes I'm not stupid to go hacking the school system, what's the point anyway?  Shardae was struggling in Chemistry when Mrs. Bond drew a few lines on the board!  Lmao, that was quite funny!  Bit pissed off at Becky.  She was supposed to be organising a leaving party and it turns out there's no plans or anything.  Then to make it worse she goes and says "Well I'm not going to any party where there isn't booze!" which really puts icing on the cake.  So stuff her, our new party organiser is Chris :o)  My MP3 player came this mornin, woohoo!  It's brilliant, built in FM Radio (I love that feature, I can listen to loads of random tunes!).  I was going to ask Mr. Swaries if I was allowed to use it as a storage device to use at school on the XP computers but I thought I'd better not because of the earlier incident.  Will try and risk it tomorrow hehe.  Jamie and Craig have gone to the Peak District trip with the Geog Dept. (YESSSS!! lol)  A James-less few days :P  Gonna go now, cya...

Last night I added a webcam link which shows a latest snapshot taken by my webcam.  It isn't a live feed or anything like that, just like a little ever-changing picture of something from my webcam!  Anyway, the link can be found over thar...    Anyways, hope all me mates are having fun at school while I sit here bored and woozy :o)

       Woo hey everyone!  Blogging from school again mwahaha!  Just been showing me mates the new layout and  Zak's Amazing Incredible Swearing Keyboard , which I made over the weekend; not for the ears of little children! (That includes you mum :P)  Anyway, I'll be going to cooking shortly (that's pronounced 'Cooh-King' in a Mrs. Humphries sort of way).  Checketts' lesson was quite strange.  She turned up late (as usual) and told us all off for 'behaving badly'.  Omg we're so naughty for being held up in our precious learning time... *cough*!  Quite ironic actually; this comes straight after the last lesson where I recall her telling Craig off for missing some of her lesson time... Hypocrite!

       Another eventful day at school.  The 'Kick Brannan...' flash game prooved quite popular.  I'm begining to wonder if it was a good idea lol.  James said he was okay with it but I'm not so sure.  People were printing off pictures of it and he kept on being violent and aggressive with people, which was totally out of order in my opinion.  Becky should give him one of her 'chill pills' lmao, You know what I mean, Miss Pill Popper ;).  The way he acted was bang out of order...  David didn't grass me up after all; I think he realised it was so pointless anyway.  We had an assembly this morning which ran into a bit of lesson one, which was totally useless in my opinion.  It was to remind us that once Year 11 leave, we aren't to go acting like we 'rule the roost'.  They could have had the braisn to go and hold it on the morning of their actual leaving day so we don't get pelted with eggs and stuff.  I dunno, what's the point anway!

       Mum showed me this hilarious clip from an episode of that ancient old kids show called "Rainbow" last night.  Because of it's old age (back in the ol' days, when people weren't as dirty minded as us modern folk), the people acting had no idea that what they were saying sounded really funny!  Anyway, back to today lol.  School was ok I guess.  I didn't do as bad as I expected to do in the Food Tech. exam.  Lauren made it loud and clear that it was her birthday by getting it written on the board lol.  I don't know if It's just me or the sandwhiches in the canteen are getting a bit crusty round the edges.  It's not very pleasant!  OMG!!  The Science department has lost my Science exam paper lol!  How funny!  I thought I did quite crap in the test anyway.  I wonder if I could sneakily find it before they do, erase it digitally and then redo it mwahaha!  Only jokin ;)  The Biology lesson was okay anyways, I thought a clump of cells which had the same functions was called a tumour lmao, when (duh) it's tissue!  Back home, I've been flashing away (Flashing as in creating Flash Animations... NOT exposing myself...).  I made a wicked interactive animation to kick Brannan's arse!  Sorry james it had to be done lmao.  Now people from all over the world can  Kick Brannan Up The Arse ! Mwahahaha

       What a weird and wonderful day!  Back to school from a 3 day Weekend! (Mayday yesterday).  It's been ok actually, confidence levels quite high.  Mrs. Bladon was doing exams so we had a boring lesson with a substitute (but hey, it's ALWAYS boring).  English was ok, as was Biology and Geography, then Maths..! lol  I've been making mad flash cartoons now that I have learnt a few basic skills.  You can see one I made  Here  which is a little cartoony commercial type flash cartoon based on the crazy "Yop!" yoghurt drink thats come out.  Make up your own mind...  I went out about 7:14 and called for Sam, then went up to Craigs.  We went over the field to look for the Lunar eclipse.. but did we see it?  NO!  The bloody clouds!!  Sam went and got some money and he bought chips (I had some!  I'm supposed to be eating healthly lol).  We then head back up toward the field and didn't see a thing, so we went home, the rain bolting down from the... CLOUDS!!!  Grr

       Not much to report on today.  It's been a cool and extra long weekend thanks to this cool Bank Holiday!  There's a Lunar eclipse tomorrow!  I'm gonna try and see it this time.  I've never actually watched one successfully in the past - at all.  I've always missed them :(  I just hope that it's not cloudy.  I might be able to take pictures if its visible enough (hopefully!)  So then, back to school tomorrow and all the tests have finished so it's back to coursework, stupidwork and homework!  All we do in English lessons is coursework, coursework and nothing else!  It's like, we finish one piece and move straight onto the next.  It's mad!  Should be putting those sleepover pics up in the gallery later if I can be arsed.  Cya...

       Hey, Carl reporting from the library here!  The mornings' lessons have been great because more than half of the year have been out on a crappy Army trip that we didn't give a darn about.  I completed cube number 2 twice and Mrs. Lawley called me a genius    ICT Shortcourse was kinda boring, followed by a boring session of Geography in the library and an interesting lesson of Chemistry with Mr. Pooley.  We did Electrolysis and to be honest, I understood him a lot more that Mrs. Bond.  I smelt the Electrolysing Hydrochloric acid and it smelt like the swimming baths

       Today was very good, ignoring the exams.  They went well but sitting there in the hall for 1:30 isn't nice.    At break time the pillocks sitting across the hall decided to bomb our table with bits of food and crap.  Chirs could no longer take being pelted with bits of food, grabbed Domonic's bottle of coke, shook it, opened it slightly and bombed it across the room onto their table, splattering all of the occupants!  HILARIOUS!!  Josh went kinda psycho on Chris but in the end we couldn't stop laughing.  Mrs. Fordham saw the whole thing and also went schiz on Chris.  It was bloody hilarious!  The dinnerlady stuck up for Chris, aww    We went out of the canteen and Michaela's sister, sorry BROTHER (the smoking guy  ), started on James and had a little paddy.  He is kinda pathetic really, anyway, having formally slagged off Michaela's brother on the internet, I might be recieving more paddy abuse from tiny big guys from year 8 hehehe    Games was fun, I scored 2 rounders, plus hit Lauren with the rounders ball lol (sorry!  ), but it does happen a lot strangely.  Mrs. Lawley had her photo taken in Maths, but I think my flash drawing is better:     Also, if you missed the chicken dance flash thing,  Click Here .  Anyway, after school was fun!  I went town with Sam, Jo, and Annie and we went to the train station to enquire about the Alton Towers bus.  Turns out it costs £5.  Friday is gonna be SO WICKAAD!  Me and Sam went McDonalds, Annie and Jo went home, and we sat eating it outside the old church.  The Police were searching the bins for what seemed some important documents (not being nosy or anything  )  G'dnight

       Today was boring!  Didn't do much really except prepare for exams tomorrow.  ICT was boring, Physics was boring, French was mortifying (did the lesson in the hall under controlled conditions), Chemistry was boring.  Food was very boring.  Mrs. Humphries said something about being mature whilst doing our surverys (like a fine cheese!  ) lol.  Today was boring, tomorrow better be better... we have exams!

       Another lazy Sunday.  I didn't go out today because I fancied a break, and it was pretty fun anyway.  I installed Harry Potter - PoA and played that for a couple of hours.  I spent most of the rest of the day browsing and planning what to do with my money when I get it.  The bids on eBay did great!  All three items reached a grand total of £75.50!  I now have over £130, plus I am babysitting tomorrow too!  I don't know what is happening, money seems to be flooding in from all directions...

       Hey all.  Today was so cool!  Today I received payment for helping an online mate with a website and I got... £50!!  I recieved the money by Paypal and sent it straight to my mum to put in her bank so I could get it in my hand   I have got lots of spending money for Alton Towers now!  The bids on eBay aren't doing too well yet, but the printer has had 3 bids so far!  More money hehe   There's only 3 and a half weeks left at school and I can't wait for Summer.  Anyway, today I went out with Sam, Craig, Jo, Annie and we just walked around and and watched a bit of Shrek etc.  It was a bit rainy - but who cares!   I've spent most of the day installing things back onto my computer.  My horroscope couldn't have been more wrong when my money score was rock bottom heh!

       Hey all.  Today was very good; it was mufti day at school!  For anyone who doesn't know what that is, well it's a day at school where we get to pay to wear our own clothes other than their stoopid uniform.  I stuck on my jeans and my "Byte Me" T-Shirt.  The day over all was pretty good.  I'm not going to go into it that much because It wasn't that entertaining.  A certain few people weren't in school today which made the day more enjoyable.  In most lessons we had fun because more than half of the lesson populations were in Belgium (land of chocolate  )  Might be going town tomorrow. Dad brought us a laptop and I've installed a few things on it and set up user accounts for me and my brothers.  It's wicked, thanks to Dad   I've formatted my computer and installed... Windows XP!  Finally I'm back where the cool blue graphics run wild and the smoothness can let rip.  I just made a nice background in Adobe Photoshop for it and It's ready to be piled up with programs!    Night

       Today was AMAZING!    School was pretty normal.  Started with a very plain sugar-free lesson of Food, followed by FRENCH...   English with a funny old woman because Audouin had gone AWOL, then a good maths lesson to end the morning.  Games was cool, it was a bit chilly though.  Natalie wanted a mention, so there you go    After school me and Sam went down town to look at this Alton Towers deal thing.  We had a really cool time on the way, chattin' about stuff.  We got to the station to find that we couldn't do the Virgin Train deal to Alton Towers, however, the bus there and back is free!  So we thought "fair enough", and then went to McDonalds thinking about how we could get cheap tickets to Alton Towers.  We had a really good time, it has been the best day this week by far!    We went back to Sam's house and browsed the Alton Towers website and thought "Damnit, there are no cheap deals  ", then when we looked at the front page... £10 MISS THE MATCH DEAL!!!!!  PERFECT!!!!     So that's that!  Alton Towers next Friday, 10AM for £10!!!  I can't effing believe it!  It is going to be such a bloody good day as long the weather is nice.  Anyways, fun!  Theres a bit of an argument now because laods of poeple have suddenly got Blogs.  Here's what I say!     All hail the photocopier!

       Today has been kinda cool    Maths was okay.  IT Shortcourse was funny, as in, "What a stupid lesson".  All we did was go through the School code of conduct.  I was quite amused by the way it was written, for example:   !  You must not use internet chat rooms or E-Mail   then went on to say:    !  You must not send or use bad language  !  You must not give out personal information  !  You must treat others with respect  As if to say: "You can't use chat rooms, but if you happened to magically stumble across one and accidentally use it... do not swear, insult or spread your phone number around it!"    Anyway.  James went home before break because he banged his head or summat.  The general attitude toward him around the table at break wasn't a pleasant one, due to things he had been saying behind peoples backs, a usual thing that James does   Next came a double period in W1; Geography and Chemisty, oh how fun!  The latter was more boring due to it being a revision lesson, but hardly anyone revised by the sounds of things.  It started belting it down half way through and I went out in it.  God, we got soaked!    Me and Craig went with Sam to his house and we just messed around with Blogs for about 20 minutes before returning to school in the calmer weather.    On the way there and back we discussed what we should do on the computers.  I thought I'd make a "Day at School" flash movie.  It could end with a dark lesson of Information Systems.  Somethig dark and hooded with a long, waving cloak enters the room, then thunder strikes sending light scattering across the room.  The light clicks on, and Mrs. Chekcetts is standing there at the door holding a few books, and says, "Hello Children!"  English was cool.  During the process of analysing another poem, the heavens opened yet again, this time chucking a few bolts of LIGHTNING down with it!!   Yes it was THUNDERING wooooooo!  I love thunder so it was like a momentus occasion for me.  The sound of the large raindrops pattering down on the roof was very calming, backed by the odd growl of thunder.  Ahhh, good old English weather.  Information Systems was normal.  We exited there for assembly, then afterwards to a windy outdoor, yes, the wind had arrived!  Whooooooshhh.  Not done a lot at home.  Only 19 more school days to go!  It sounds like NOTHING at all!!  In a couple of months I might not even be in England at all, yet again, the chances of staying in England to start school again in September is looking more likely...

       Today was absolutely spiffing    I'm going to completely ignore French, it's no longer worht wasting my breath saying how crap it is.  English was okay, we did another poem with a swear word it in hehehe    In Biology we just did a practice paper, how entertaining!  Geography was really cool.  Miss Taylor heard us talking about the trip to Alton Towers (Hopefully going next Friday wooooooooo!!) and shared a little story about how she took a disabled friend with her so they could both get on the rides instantly mwahah... she r0x0rs!    Games was brilliant again.  I'm glad I've started doing it again, and my asthma is nowhere to be seen yet, but I am not really doing any tough exercises really.  It would be hell if it were football I was doing at the moment - God forbid.  Craig whacked the ball and it either missed (luckily) or whacked Lauren in the foot.  It went about 70 Mph, at a guess.  We had an assessment in Maths and I think I did quite well actually *crosses fingers*    Can't wait to find out more about the Alton Towers package so we can book it etc.  It will be a bloody good day out and a great time to spend some time with me friends    Because I'm anti-sport, I'm wearing normal clothes on Friday and bringing in my Mufti money all in coppers    That should keep them busy for a while!

       Whoo I think I've had too much Tango hehe *hic*  I've now started to gel my hair and I think it looks a lot better than previously (I want to dye it blue, or orange, in the holidays!).  School was really crap today.  ICT was funny because lots of us didn't know what we were doing.  Physics was good, we looked at an oscilloscope and then did another practice paper for the modules next week.  French was blood horrific - as usual.  We had Chemistry in W1 and it was really boring, and we're also going to be in there on Wednesday too... great    Food was...       ... Yep!  Terrible.  We sat there in the dreaded W1 doing a load of Shoite.  That was it basically.  We did some questionnaire thing and... yeh.  So for the longest day of the year, the weather was fine, perfect, super duper!  But the day, in my opinion...  Bit It

       Yesterday was kinda cool.  Sam and Craig couldn't have the sleepover so we had it here instead.  It was brilliant!   Me, Sam and Craig had a tent putting up race and Craig stood there with the tent on his head.  We drank coffee and watched School of Rock in the tent which was a really cool movie!  We had pizza and we we pranked a few people from my room with the Old Boot hehe.  Overall the night was pretty rough as usual with sleepovers lol.  We jumpd around in the tent a bit and squashed each other.  Sam kept farting    It was way better than the last one and we are bound to do it again really soon  *hopefully*     I've not long woken and my face feels like it has been glued.  Craig tries to take the tent apart on me so I got out and then he started wearing the tent again.  We've just had a drink of coffee and stuff and now we're all awake again and ready for another day of MADNESS!!  I made this...   Jamie as... The Hulk

       Today was quite odd to be honest.  I woke up tired again having listened to the whole of the Asylum on kerrang! FM until 2AM   Anyway... today...  Lesson one was quite amusing.  Miss Taylor hovered around James momentarily for some chocolate as we finished off the first pieces of our coursework.  RE was just mad.  Physics wasn't that good ebcause we just did a practice test.  Information systems was particularly 'ready salted' also. In fact, not one lesson today made the 'cheese and onion' or 'salt and vinegar' title   I was feeling a bit down at dinner time for some reason.  Maybe it was the sudden change in weather from sunny to cloudy and windy.  Ignore me please.  I have just been writing the first paragraph of my new story and my brain is bashind around in my head trying to break free.  Here is a taster paragraph:   James continued down the corridor, not noticing all of the stares he was receiving from other hospital staff, and jogged up a flight of stairs.  He passed the first floor waiting room and almost exactly the same thing happened as downstairs.  Every single person waiting suddenly stopped talking and gawped at him.  A baby somewhere in the room suddenly started chuckling.  He was about to say something when Jennifer appeared around the corner, let out a short scream and dropped the small cup of tea she was just holding, “James!  What the hell have you done?!”   I'll leave it to your imaginations.  Anyway, me Sam and Craig might have a sleepover this weeked.  I stress the word might because 9/10 of the times, there isn't a sleepover after all.  I'm going to bed now before my head actually explodes and I can't stay awake without falling asleep (rather like the main character in my story actually  )  I'll leave you with a few pictures I made today.  They hold the theme "Why you shouldn't put your picture on the internet", and are of Sam and james mwaha!  Here you go:   Sam... Engorged!   James the Porn Star   Wallace and... Sammit   'Shrek' and Donkeh!   Toy Story Sam   Sam of Liberty   Hahahahahaha... sorry Sammo, couldn't resist

       Haha today was  Excellent !  Lessons were usual etc.  Food was annoying, French was ARGH F*%$£@Z*£.  I am starting to get  very  stressed out with it.  I wish I never picked it now!  I wish I had followed my instincts and had picked art rather than pick French simply for the fact that I might need it the future, which when I look into now looks highly unlikely as I'm moving to America!    I had my first lesson of Games today for a long while, and it was bloody brilliant!  We played rounders, Greebos vs. Trendies and none other than Mrs. Checketts run the lesson!  She was brilliant, she even got a sweatshirt on for the part and we all had a giggle about it - including her.  Shows how cool she really is   The game was fun, Chris shouted random ICT phrases such as "Data Storage!" every time he hit the ball.  We all made fools of ourselves and made the game really enjoyable.  I can't wait for Games next week    After school I went to Sam's house with Craig and we pranked Kerrang! FM with their own Old Boot sound effects...  urlLink Click Here to Listen!   It was hilarious.  Afterwards, we had to go home but we had hardly turned out of the area when Sam phoned Craig to say that they had phoned back!  They had returned the prank to Sam with the real Old Boot sounds haha!

       Today has been quite funny, and somewhat spooky!  Started the day atearly 8AM.  Last night I set up my webcam in my window again to do a 'timershot' over 24 hour, or more, periods.  It's basically a program which takes a picture from the webcam every X about of minutes and saves it to your Hard Drive.  Mr. Salt took over Maths again, which reminds me...  Click Here!   Muahahahaha!  You will get it if you were in the lesson where Mr. Salt explained co-ordinates... anywho, ICT Shortcourse followed and Craig got told off for not doing any work lol    I have the feeling I am being spooked, or have somehow wandered into a patch of bad luck.  The bottle of water I bought from the canteen at lunch somehow unscrewed itself (it was tightly screwed!) and made a small swimming pool for my books in my bag.  I got it mopped up and saved my books from absorbing most of the water.  At dinner time I went to Sam's house with the gang and we pranked Kerrang! with the Old Boot sound effects lol!  The DJ answered and everything, they're a great bunch.  We played 'Hello!' and he laughed.  We reckon he realised who it was but kept schtum anyway lol    Back home I decided to make the Solar System in Adobe Photoshop.  You can see it  Here .  I love drawing in Photoshop... WHAT THE!  I've just noticed that my keyboard has a euro key!  It's added itselfonto the '4' key   God I swear I'm being spooked.  This happened earlier when I was looking for my camera card reader.  I scanned the whole bedroom floor, gave up, sat on the bed, then saw it right there on my shelf, which I had scanned a number of times!  Jeezus!  Anyway I better be off I'm tired...

       Today has been quite good.  The feeling of the end of school seems to be dawning upon the days now as the summer gets hotter.  The morning's lessons were okay, French was terrible.  We now have to learn another bloody piece of coursework OFF BY HEART!  I'm sure any day now it will turn round and go "Right, that's it!" and I will be subject to a very bad heart attack.  Seriously, I'm sick of French now, roll on leaving day...    I'm turning into a health freak!  I've been drinking loads of bottled water and eating 'Hamster Food' for breakfast and 'Rabbit Food' for lunch.  I'm telling you know, having been on a healthier diet for about a month now, I can certainly feel the effects.  I feel much more nautral, but when on a caffeine and fat fueled diet I feel full of wasteful energy which makes me all hyperactive and over-confident.  Anyway...  I'll be starting Games again on Thursday.  After a long period out of it due to my asthma I've decided it's time to give it a go again.  Should be fun!  God... Maths!  Mr. Salt invaded the classroom... need I say more?  We received our reports today, which was quite good.  A number of people weren't happy with theirs, although some of them were over exaggerating.  I've been making loads in Adobe Photoshop lately.  Here area few examples:   Planetary   Vortex   Soul   I went round Sam's house after school for a bit and we did some stuff on Adobe, I helped him a bit making planets and stuff.  I can't believe how cool and easy to use the program is.  I used to look upon it and...   We pranked a few people with a few Kerrang! FM sound effects it was funny, I might upload them    G'dnight everyone... yeh

       Back to school after an interesting weekend.  Typical Monday morning, full of yawning and rushing about.  The small lessons of Information Systems we had was quite good actually.  We learnt a lot about making queries and stuff.  Mrs. Checketts was about 20 minutes late but the lesson was worthwhile.  Physics was okay, we learnt about Electrolysis which we have done many times in Chemistry.  We had another mindmap mad lesson of French followed by an average lesson Chemistry.  Lots of people made fun of Mrs. Bonds pronunciation of "Both".  Double food was horrendous.  Mrs. Humphreys was being mega shady with Ross because he was drinking water in the vast temperatures of the day.  We sat there for 100 minutes doing rock hard coursework    We had a sneak preview of our reports, mine was great.  Everyone made a comment on how quiet I was, as if determinedc to find something perculiar to pick about me.  We get them back today because they were just giving us like a taster of them lol.  Food's report was terrible though... Grr

       Today has been quite slow!  My keyboard has been messing up and I payed off my telescope!!  I now own an absolutely BRILLIANT Telescope, brought at an amazingly bargain price from eBay!  I can't wait to use it to look at the moon or the planets.  I'll be able to take photographs from it as well    Today was England's first football match in Euro 2004 - like I care.  We got caught up in tesco whilst innocently buying sweets and stuff.  Football fans and hooligans from across stafford seemed to have all gathered in Tesco to buy peanuts, popcorn, beer, and any other snack they could grab their hands on.    I bought a bottle of Dr. Pepper, some minty Dairy Milk and other stuff.  Me and Craig then went to call for Chris and then went across to Rowley Park.  It was so quiet!  The sun wasn't far off setting and was casting brilliant light all over the clean grounds of Rowley Park.  We hung around the park for a bit and eventually went because Chris and Craig had to be in.  It was like walking through a desert!  Most of the roads were completely empty, even the Wolverhampton Road!    All of the football crazed fans and alike were gathered int heir living rooms worshiping their TV screens and watching people run around a field.  At least there were no cars with flags on the roads.  I'm sick to death of seeing these flags on every single car, shoved in every single place possible such as side windows, sunroof, ariels and boots.  I found another place they can go...

       Just come back and my brain feels funny    We walked around for a bit, went to a deserted Queensville carpark and then spuna round and around on a round about, bloodstreams flowing with DRUGS!  Yes, today I have taken drugs, one which is widely available and almost everyone takes - literally.  This was before walking around mind...  What?!  I'm not on weed or anything like that... whatever gave you that idea!  I'm talking about  trimethylxanthine , that's caffeine to you kids.  It is the most popular drug on the planet and people take it without even knowing it.  So in the form of a post, I shall rant and rave about caffeine and give you some interesting coffee facts     Caffeine is the world's most popular drug! First isolated from coffee in 1820! Caffeine is derived from the Arabic word qahweh! Caffeine is also found in tea! Reaches all tissues of the body within five minutes! Slightly increases water loss through urination... *cough* Caffeine drives me flippin mad I haven't had it for ages and it smells     Moooving on... We had an okay time, as I said my brain feels a bit funny because we were going around and around on a round-a-bout and frankly that was a bit stupid!

       Got up at nine and felt tired, but failed to return to bed    I didn't go out with Sam etc.  I stayed in and sorted out my brand spanking new Blog template, then to my horror, the forum is broken!  I asked for help but it was no use, the forum is dead.  Some pathetic error about the MySQL database not being found.  It was a good forum as well...    I sat down a bit earlier to read a bit of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  Time flew by as I read through about 4 chapters, then decided to put it down.  I might watch a movie tonight with mum or go out.  I was supposed to be going out around now but alas, Sam and Craig are nowhere to be seen    What is it with that, a simple phone call would be nice      SHIT!  They're here LMAO... I'm off out, cya!

       One word which best describes today? ...  Anomalous  First two lessons were computer room based and were pretty average.  RE was interesting.  We are studying things to do with witches and satan etc. for the next few weeks so it should be fun.  Physics was really interesting; we learnt about how transformers worked, which has always been something that has puzzled me.  We learnt how currents could be trippled just by using a bit of iron and coils of wire, which begs the question - Why can't we power the whole world from one super-powerstation with thousands of gigantic transormers?  I was also amazed by the fact that the UK's National Grid system is quite unique compared to how the rest of the world's countries generate their power.  Anyway, Information Systems was a normal experience followed by dinner.  Spent the first half in the library then the second half sitting in the arboretum (isn't as beautiful as it sounds) with Craig, eventually joined by James, Michaela & Gang, Oliver, Sam and Chris.  English was okay today.  We did two Carol Ann Duffy poems in one lesson.  Mrs. Audouin split the class up into two groups and we did one poem each, then merged afterwards.  These poems weren't as good as ones we have done in other lessons this week.  Maths was quite good today.  Mrs. Lawley set us doing work out of the text book for three quarters of the lesson which totally messed with my head    Overworked and exhausted after a long week at school, it was home time at last.  Having been asked 4 times already today, I don't think I could face another "When are you leaving Caaaarl?" from anyone.  But it came anyway... twice, during the small period that is registration. Our reports are going to be given out next Tuesday so I've heard; I can't wait to see what I've got!  A mufti day is fast approaching soon also, and I don't care that we have been asked to wear sports clothing.  I am wearing my "Byte Me" t-shirt and jeans.  Nobody can stop me, and after all:     Google: Definitions of sport on the Web:    An active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition.   Technically, that includes pie-eating contests, fishing, darts, speed reading, programming contests, jelly wrestling, kicking Brannan up the arse, watching Lord of the Rings, farting contests, family arguments and throwing paper aeroplanes at the Big Issue seller.    I have a sudden urge to start writing a story again.  Many fresh ideas have crossed my mind and I feel much maturer than when I wrote bits to others when I was younger so maybe, just maybe, this time they will be better.  I might give it a go... after reading Harry Potter 4 and 5 again

       Another long hot day!  School was pretty plain and boring as usual    There was, however, an event that took place which is rather stupid.  Craig frog hopped over James and aparantly kicked him in the head.  Craig apologised and then James went round saying he was "Going to kill Craig".  I'm sorry but STOP ACTING SO HARD!!  Frankly he has pissed us all off a bit.  I don't know how this is going to turn out, but yet another pathetic issue revolving around Brannan is about the last one I can cope with    Chris got kegged in games lol!  That's about the 4th time this week that has happened to Chris now.  Chris must be pretty sick and embarrassed to hell by it now!  Biology was bloody hilarious!  We were supposed to be doing something about plants but the diagrams Miss. Hussain drew on the board even got Miss. Jairi laughing!  What were supposed to resemble shoots on a plant looked rather like the male anatomy.  Then to top it all off, Miss. Jairi went and drew a scale beside the shoot "2cm"; Oh the laughter!  After school was kool, the gang went down town with Josh this time and walked about a bit.  Craig got soaked in the pool and then went and sat on Chris lmao.  We had a walk around town for a bit and we saw Miss. Lyons in town.  We then went back to town park and Chris took a trolley.  We saw this croup of baby swans with the parents and they weren't very happy when we got up close; they hissed!  But they looked so cute...    A mad man who walked over the bridge started singing to them it was hilarious!!  Sam caught some footage of him as well, that should be appearing on the forum soon lmao.  We walked around and sat down near the pool, where loads of the tiny rogues were sitting with the big manly bitch who was being nasty to Michaela the other day.  They started again, this time on Oliver so we made our way back through town and back home.  The day was quite cool actually!  Peace out...

       Interesting day.  Maths was good, followed by a regular lesson of Short Course ICT.  Geography was okay and Chemistry was too.  And, wait for it, English was okay as well!!  Well actually, English was better.  We did yet another brilliant Duffy poem called 'Educating for Leisure' (I took an extract and put it as today's blog title) which was brilliant.  Read:   Education for Leisure    Today I am going to kill something.  Anything. I have had enough of being ignored and today I am going to play God. It is an ordinary day, a sort of grey with boredom stirring in the streets.  I squash a fly against the window with my thumb. We did that at school. Shakespeare. It was in another language and now the fly is in another language. I breathe out talent on the glass to write my name.  I am a genius. I could be anything at all, with half the chance. But today I am going to change the world. Something's world. The cat avoids me. The cat knows I am a genius, and has hidden itself.  I pour the goldfish down the bog. I pull the chain. I see that it is good. The budgie is panicking. Once a fortnight, I walk the two miles into town for signing on. They don't appreciate my autograph.  There is nothing left to kill. I dial the radio and tell the man he's talking to a superstar. He cuts me off. I get our bread-knife and go out. The pavements glitter suddenly. I touch your arm.    Carol Ann Duffy   Scary poem don't you think?  I took the following line and put it as my MSN Name because I think, well, I think it is cool (and sounds like something Chris would say lol):  "The cat avoids me. The cat knows I am a genius, and has hidden itself..."  Anyway, at the end of school we discussed my leaving party and have decided to have a cool Teen night out.  To start off with we shall eat pizza in town park and then go and watch a movie at the cinema.  It's going to be great

       Today was bloody amazing.  School was kinda boring as usual, but interesting.  I went to school a little earlier to see the Venus Transit, which was quite interesting actually.  The tool they were using to see it with was quite handy.  I heard it cost about £100    For both lessons 1 and 2 we had Mrs. Audouin because Bladon was away yet again.  We did another great poem in English by Carol Ann Duffy.  I thought poetry would be quite boring but it is actually really good (this particular poet).  After school I cleared my room up a bit and then went to Zak's to sort out his radio for him.  Me, Zak, Craig, Sam, Oliver, Sophie and Chris then went to town park to take advantage of the river and pool.  We had a brilliant time   Zak kept going down the mini-waterfall things in the river and Chris got pushed in and soaked (again  ).  We then went to the pool and this time I got completely soaked and, well, we all did except for Sophie and oliver.  Craig went home ( ) and we splashed around loads in the pool.  Zak had a few condoms which he filled with water and threw at us.  Afterwards I got out and dried off.  Sam and Zack went and left us remaining four enjoying the quiet of the park.  We sat talking and stuff and then Michaela and Chris went.  Me, Sophie, and Oliver walked through town as the sun set behind the clouds.  God town is so peaceful at night.  It was so relaxing and calm.  The coloured lights from the shops illuminated the streets and a cool breze blew through the streets.  We relaxed on the bench in town square for a few minutes then made our way down the main town road.  The evening atmosphere in town is so pleasant.  Lots of adults around dining out and drinking in pubs and things.  The smells of hot food drifting through the air... excellent!  I felt like I wanted to go and have a drink or a meal or something with a few freinds.  I can't wait till I'm all grown up heh   We walked past a very inviting cinema and made our way home. Today has been so cool.  It's days like these which really make me realise how much I am going to miss when I've gone.  I really want to make a big effort for some kind of leaving party.  Going out for a meal or a drink would be just brilliant

       Today has been quite interesting acutally.  I went to school after the half term and found myself being spoken to by a select few that I'm usually ignored by.  That felt quite cool, to be talked to... lol  Information Systems was okay, followed by and interesting lesson in Physics about how electricity is generated etc.  Not sure if anyone else likes Physics... but there you go. The science dept. are holding a small gathering for the Venus transit in the morning, which will be quite cool.  I'm still pondering on whether to go or not, although I probably will, with or without friends.  Sam suprised us in the dinner hall again by explaining how teachers are now reading the forum... *waves*    After school, Sam, Craig, Me, Chris and Zak went to town.  Our original plan was to get toally soaked and go swimming in the pool fully clothed.  Why?  Because we're mental that's why    Zak brought along a large rubber dinghy which was ridden along the river for a bit.  Our plan would have been great, hadn't a large group of bitch kiddies have been there annoying us and totally kicking the piss out of Kayla.  In the end we called the Police but they ran off... pussies!    I took a record of 101 pictures on my outing for Geography Coursework and just general photos of Stafford for memories.  I'm getting really excited now.  We could be leaving as early as July and to me it's great news, but to others it isn't because they like me so much lol (There's at least a whole month yet! lol)  Any day now, that approval notice is going to come through...

       Today has been quite a good laugh and a good day out!  I woke up extra early because Craig said he'd call for me at 8:30, but in true Craig style, didn't turn up at all hehe.  Anyway, he came on MSN a short while afterwards and we were all sorted.  Sam, Kayla and James called for me and Craig met up with us on the way to Chris' house.    The idea today was for Chris to walk through town wearing womens clothes.  That plan fell through the roof faster than an elephant falling from a helicopter.  We walked into town, past the Big Issue seller (looking as scary as ever), the old war protester man sitting in his deck chair with his anti-government signs, and two Labour and Tory stands right next to each other (Labour won; they offered free helium balloons!).  We walked to the end of the road (saw Becky again emerging from the new Cafe Nero) and then tailed back up to the centre again.  Everyone had lunch in Fatdonalds.  Chris took a yellow helium balloon which was floating idly on the ceiling, which was swiftly taken off him by a nasty member of staff, stating "They're for children!".  So what was the staff member doing with it then   lmao.  Chris (the baloon taking person) then did a stand up performance in the middle of Fatdonalds upstairs, which Sam caught on film.  When we went out, Chris swiped a dark green balloon from under the staffs' noses and we ran out of the premises laughing.  Chirs, accompanied with his new friend (the Fatdonalds balloon), went round taking the wet out of the Labour balloons by going up to people and saying "Vote McDonalds!  Free Hamburger Policy!".  We walked behind St. Mary's Church and Chris did a rather loud speech about it, causing a lot of attention.  (A woman walked past asking if he had recently left St. George's!)    Town park was the next stop.  They had refilled the swimming pool (it's a little farty kids paddling pool really) and we thought about things we could do.  Sam then went home alone and everyone else stayed in town to continue the antics.  We went to Home Bargains where a roll of 5m Tin Foil was purchased and promptly wrapped around Chris' head.  Oh the laughter!  Every single person who sighted Chris either laughed, looked at him weirdly, or took a quick peek and then looked away quickly.  On entry to JJB Sports he got some very snotty, gawping, and sneering looks from the uptight people in there.    We all went to chill out in town park for a bit.  Michaela and James went into the swimming pool and we ended up scooping water with the plastic bags and winging them about.  In the end it was a brilliant day out and we went home after another cool day out together.  One of my good mates has been quite upset today and I hope to cheer her up a bit tomorrow    Before I go, I just have one little message for Fatdonalds...  !

       Wow, I was so busy yesterday I forgot to post!  Wow it has been an eventful couple of days.  I've been out with Sam, Chris, Craig and James (sometimes) doing loads of cool stuff like throwing ourselves off skateboards and stuff... lol!    Ok, so Thursday was fun.  Me, Craig, and Sam went into town, taking loads of pictures for Geography coursework.  We went up and around every place imaginable (except certain... places) the called for Chris on the way back (for some odd reason we keep seeing Kylie... freaky!  ).  Me and Chris hung out a bit in my room and at about 6pm went out with Sam and Craig, James joining us for a short 5 minutes, to the area near James' house.  We filmed loads of cool things such as Chris rolling down a hill into nettle bushes and stuff.  We did sort of the same thing today whichw as really cool.  James came along and he did a bit too.  I've had such a cool time with my mates recently.  I'm glad because I'm not going to have a lot of time to be out enjoying myself before I move.  I'm gonna try and get some group photos with me in them as well for memories and stuff    I really fancy a burger from Chillis   (a brilliant American food place).  I'm gonna be off to bed now.  Getting up early to go to town with the gang again heh.  I must do some work before I go back to school also

       God I'm so hot (temperature wise, not looks wise) and my fan cover has come off so it will be a bit careless of me to put it on    I've been in all day today.  I had a great tea!  I scrambled some egg with peppers, onion, cheese, and tomato and it tasted de-lic-ious!    I'm getting used to my new blogging program now.  Tis fun, tis fun!  We all watched a movie on the telly this evening after Corrie and here I am now whacked (again)  I'm begining to think there might be something wrong with me    I might go out and do most of the practical part of my Geography coursework tomorrow with the mates.  I'm off to bed now, I'm bloody tired.  Bye bye bye bye bye...

       Hey everyone.  Woke up and had a phone call from Sam and we went to town with James and Craig.  We all watched Harry Potter 3 (my 2nd time watching it) and had a great time!  On the way home we tried to think what the evil cow from book 5 who teaches DADA was called (turned out to be Dolores Umbridge).  I can't wait to see the next 2 films!  I had  a bit too muchg fizzy pop and chocolate again I think... I feel funny :S     As you can see, I've been pretty movie mad lately.  I better go... cya!

       Got up reasonably early because my dad picked me up to go and see Harry Potter 3 in Stoke.  We got there around 11:50 and had a quick McDonalds before entering the Odeon.  We waited for a short while (a few obvious die hard Harry Potter fans there... reading the book!  Daft sods) and were finally let in.  There was a pretty mad rush to the seats and then we waited around 20 minutes for the production to start.  For about 30 mins there were trailers and advertisements until the movie finally started.  I won't ruin it for anyone but it beats the other two movies by storm!  It was so much darker and cooler.  I guess it was because the director wasn't a cheesy American dude lol.  I really want to go and see it again now with my mates but I havent got enough moneys lol.  Maybe some will magic it's way into my wallet.  After the movie (with aching bums) we head off back to Grandma's where we had chicken and ice-cream afterwards.  Just finished watching this Séance by Derren Brown broadcast on C4, which was quite spooky and interesting.  They called a spirit of this woman who turned out to be alive after the whole thing, prooving it was all in their heads.  I'm gonna get off to bed because I'm whacked.  G'dnight!

       Today has been pretty fun, mad and hard working.&nbsp; I've managed to cram half of my room into a case for America.&nbsp; It's been really hot and the Sun hasn't shown its face all day.&nbsp; We have the chance to go to Alton Towers and stay in either the Arabian Nights suite or the Oblivion suite, so that will be amazing!   I was called for in the evening buy Craig, Chris, James and Jo.&nbsp; We met up with Kayla, Tasha and Emily and we all went mad for a bit.&nbsp; James jumped on Craig and they ended up rolling in dog poo.&nbsp; James got it all over his knees and Craig on his t-shirt!&nbsp; Mr. Poo and Mr. Shit-Knee (as we nicknamed them) went mad trying to get it off whilst we ran off hehe.&nbsp; James went in shortly followed by Jo, Craig and then Chris.   Me, Tasha, Emily and Kayla then went to Kayla's house for a few minutes until it was time for me to go home.&nbsp; We didn't have&nbsp;a long time out tonight but it was a bit fun.&nbsp; James was mad, but when isn't he?&nbsp; I miss Sam, he is in France and I haven't seen him since last Tuesday.&nbsp; I need someone insane to talk to!

       So...   This morning we woke up early again for the London hotel brekkie and then made our way to a different bus stop where we had to wait shortly for bus no. 7 which went up past the British Museum, down Oxford Street and around a part of Hyde Park to the Royal Albert Hall.&nbsp; We got off the bus after about 15 - 20 minutes and head off around the corner to the Science Museum.&nbsp; No sooner had we entered and gone up to the second floor, an emergency announcement was made and everyone had to evacuate!   Annoyed, we went next door to the Natural History Museum which was really cool, but seriously packed!&nbsp; Feeling a bit claustrophobic,&nbsp; I left and we had hotdogs and a slushie from the truck outside.&nbsp; We then took the bus through Piccadilly Circus and past Soho to the British Museum.&nbsp; This building's architecture was amazing.&nbsp; We went around a few areas and in one exhibit of life and death, there were two timelines of medicene and stories of the lives of a man and woman, from birth until death.&nbsp; Beside each timeline were pills lined up in rows indicating the medicene each person would take in their life.&nbsp; It was very interesting and cleverly done.   After visiting here (and having the worst orange juice from all the holiday) we met back up with Grandma and set off home just as it started raining.&nbsp; Less than 2 hours and a boring trip up the morotway, we were home,&nbsp; Woohoo!   A couple of hours after arriving, I was invited round to Craig's house for a 'sleepover' (I didn't actually sleep... much!)&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a laugh and watched Family Guy and Chris brought his cool mate Joe round and we had a great time.&nbsp; Chris and Craig fell asleep and me and Joe just sat up chattin' a bit until he went to sleep and I just sat there on the sofa.&nbsp; I eventually dozed off for about 30 minutes and then woke up and had some more apple Tango... *burrrrp*   Pictures from London are up, check out the Gallery now!

       I have had the best day of the holiday yet!&nbsp; Today was totally awesome and we got to see tons more of London and some famous monuments in greater detail.&nbsp; I woke up around 8am by the bloody noisy phone by the bed (Grandad phoned us from his room to wake us up for the hotel's early breakfast times!)&nbsp; The hotel breakfast was really nice and you could help yourself to a large selection of cereal and hot food.&nbsp; In total I had a full english breakfast minus the egg, a bowl of Cruncy Nut Cornflakes (ludicrously tasty) and three glasses of apple juice.  Not long after we set off out into the mega-city that is London.&nbsp; Grandad got us a couple of bus passes each for today and tomorrow and then we walked with Grandma to the Edexcel head office so she could do her work.&nbsp; Me, Dan, Ryan and Grandad then found the nearest bus stop to take us to the Tower of London.&nbsp; The bus journey was about 10 to 15 minutes in total, taking us past St. Pauls Cathedral and a few buildings which stand out on the London skyline, such as the 'egg' building (the Swiss Gerkin) and the Natwest Tower.&nbsp; Nice messages on the bus such as "Treat all abandoned baggage with suspicion, GUILTY UNTIL PROOVEN INNOCENT" (risk they might contain wild gerbils on canabis, or a bomb or something)  The Tower of London was quite good.&nbsp; We got to see the large ravens prowling around in and around their cages on the grass inside the fortress.&nbsp; In the white tower where the Kings and Queens were help prisoner, there were lots of exhibitions of the armour used in battle and models of the whole tower etc.&nbsp; We then saw the crown jewels which were absolutely amazing.&nbsp; They were so sparkly and very, very beautiful.&nbsp; We had to go through a secure vault door to get to them.&nbsp; We departed the tower shortly after this in search of a drink or ice-cream as Ryan wanted.&nbsp; Standing behind us mightily was the great Tower Bridge.  We went up and around the Tower Bridge taking tons of photos and admiring the spectacular views from the walkway above the road bit, then watched a couple of short movies about how the tower was built and how it worked etc.&nbsp; Afterwards we saw the old pumping and engines for it which lifted it when a large boat sailed along the Thames.&nbsp; After having an ice-cream, we went across the bridge again and boarded another bus all the way through Westminster and into the West End.&nbsp; I have never seen so many people or shops in my life!&nbsp; God this place was busy.&nbsp; I snapped a couple of pictures from the bus frantically as we passed because there was no way we were going to stop here!&nbsp; We went passed Piccadilly Circus with its giant lights and signs and past Soho.  We took the bus near to Buckingham Palace and then got off for a short walk around the Queen's back garden because no buses could go down to the palace itself.&nbsp; We arrived to find another large crowd perched around the Queen Victoria monument like pigeons with dead legs.&nbsp; The palace was quite cool, Big Ben and the London Eye could be seen in the opposite direciton like two big giants.&nbsp; We finished at Buckingham and left via the Mall and through the arch at the bottom.&nbsp; We passed Trafalgar Square and made our way to famous Leicester Square.&nbsp; There were movie theatres on all sides of the area where they have the London movie premieres and stuff.&nbsp; We sat down to eat at Garfunkel's, even though there were about 4 Pizza Huts in the area lol.  After that we took the veyr hand bus service to Covent Garden where there were loads of little shops and market stalls selling cool things.&nbsp; There were a few open cafés with singers etc.&nbsp; The atmosphere here was very pleasant and calm despite the masses of crowds.&nbsp; I bought lots of little British goodies from a market stall to take to America with me.&nbsp; I bought a few flags, a cap and various little keyrings and things.&nbsp; After getting back to the hotel, my camera card bursting with pictures of our adventure across London, we were relieved to be able to flop down on the bed and relax, looking through photos with Grandma who had returned from work.&nbsp; For tea we set off out to find a Mcdonalds and we found one a few blocks away from the hotel.&nbsp; I ordered a Big Mac to try out their free music download offer (what, I gotta have a go!)  We were then suprised to a night visit to Westminster.&nbsp; I got my camera out and we waited many minutes for the 91 bus to Trafalgar Square to arrive.&nbsp; We got there in minutes and departer to the&nbsp; brightly lit streets of London at night.&nbsp; Traffic lighting and floodlights for the monuments created a brilliant atmosphere all around.&nbsp; We got to Big Ben just in time for the Ten PM chimes which totally brought the whole experience to life.&nbsp; The large clock was illuminated entirely and stood magnificantly on the riverside.&nbsp; I took a few pictures of Westminster Abbey and then we crossed over to Westminster Bridge to sneak a few of the beautifully lit London Eye and more of Parliament and Big Ben.&nbsp; After snapping loads of photos we went back to the hotel.  Today has been so amazing, and yet again I am yet to believe it really all happened.&nbsp; Here I am sitting here in the early hours of Sunday morning reporting to you my amazing day across London and seeing some pretty amazing stuff!&nbsp; I better go and get some rest now because tomorrow, or rather today, is our last day here and we are going the the Natural History Museum, the London Science Museum and then hopefully, the British Museum.&nbsp; Good night!

        Woke up this morning and had a small breakfast in the hotel again.&nbsp; Not long after, we quickly packed up what hadn't been put away last night and made our way quickly to the port for our ferry to Dover.&nbsp; We arrived within 30 minutes of the departure time and hopped onto the boat at nearly the last minute, then rushed up to the top deck.&nbsp; By the time we had arrived across the channel my camera was loaded with around 200 pictures of the journey and lots of the great white cliffs of Dover which were gleaming on the shores of the UK.   A quick 2 hours up the motorway and we entered the outskirts of London - nearly there!&nbsp; After travelling about 20 minutes, the residential area began to get more dense and lots of commercial and inustrial zone began to appear.&nbsp; We passed a few congestion zones and we kept spotting the eye&nbsp; on the horizon between the high buildings which I would have expected to be in somewhere like America.&nbsp; We finally saw Westminster, Big Ben, the London Eye and the Thames when we crossed a bridge.&nbsp; It wasn't a long look, more like a glimpse, but we were well on our way to Bloomsbury where our hotel was.   After a while checking in and dowloading photographs from the camera from on our way here, we set off into the wild and busy streets of London.&nbsp; Grandad bought the Congestion Charge from this car park shop and we went to the bus stop to catch the bus to Trafalgar Square (there were buses everywhere!)&nbsp; People were everywhere!&nbsp; The fountains were spreaying jets of water all over the place and Nelson's Column stood tall in the sunlight surrounded by four lions (and hundreds of foreign tourists of all ethnic origins).&nbsp; It wasn't long before we made our way to this archway where we could see Buckingham Palace (a sight to see another day), then we continued into SW1 where all of the government buildings were and eventually we came to Downing Street, the MoD building and the Cabinet Office etc.   Heavy security outside Downing Street prevented us getting excellent pictures but we got quite a few anyway.&nbsp; Big Ben stood gleaming gold over the buildings so we made our way up to it and the end of the street, just in time for the Six PM chimes.&nbsp; It isn't really that loud as you hear it on the TV or the radio.&nbsp; The busy traffic and noise of the people everywhere drowns it out.&nbsp; The dense buildings around the city reminded me instantly of our visit to San Antonio last summer and was delighted by how the landmarks stood nicely in the centre of it all.&nbsp; It almost seemed unreal because this isn't how I imagined London to be at all.&nbsp; I thought there would be lots of space but it is so up close and personal!   We made our way across the bridge and towards the London Eye which we boarded after about half an hour due to a couple of small queues for tickets and boarding the world's largest observation wheel.&nbsp; The whole 'flight' was truly brilliant.&nbsp; As soon was we were at the wheel's full height, the whole of London was visible in its true form - city EVERYWHERE!&nbsp; Buckingham palace and all of the government buildings were visible and tons of skyscrapers and cool looking buildings were too, not to mention Westminster and the Houses of Parliament.&nbsp; The whole experience was amazing and we got 'ride photos' when we came off too (the whole ride was operated and managed by Tussauds!)   We came back after by bus (I got on with a child's ticket hehe) and had room service for tea.&nbsp; We rang Mum and Dad and now I'm sitting here writing this entry.&nbsp; We have to get up early for breakfast tomorrow or else we don't get any!&nbsp; So I best be off... I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE HERE!!

        Today was going okay in the morning.&nbsp; We had some breakfast and set off to Le Touquet.&nbsp; The weather was stunning.&nbsp; I fell asleep in the car and was probably better off asleep because of motion sickness.&nbsp; We arrived in the town and parket the car beside the beach and walked along to a couple of cafés and Aqualud, which is a small water park on the beachside.   We had a few drinks while Ryan and Grandad went in and walked around for a little while.&nbsp; When they came out of the water park we went back to Calais and to the hotel in time for a swim in the hotel pool and the news.&nbsp; Clouds were appearing from all directions and by the time we were back in the hotel room the sky was covered.&nbsp; No sooner had the BBC South East news discussed the abnormal weather (and marble sized hail that had been at Dover) the thunder outside had begun.   Sheet and fork lightning form all directions appeared followed by the loud rumbling and groaning from the clouds above.&nbsp; One bolt shot down and hit one of the metal poles in the Cité Europe shopping centre behind the hotel.&nbsp; It was a very rewarding experience!&nbsp; I managed to take well over 300 photographs on my memory card whilst frantically snapping up pictures of the sky to try and capture the lightning, but no such luck.&nbsp; If I had had my new camera with me it would have been possible to have taken a video of it... never mind.   The night went on and the thunder calmed down and we ate in the hotel restraunt for a change because we couldn't go out due to the car not having headlight converters.&nbsp; There wasn't much thunder after that, apart from an outbreak from Grandma in the hotel lobby.

       Hey!&nbsp; I'm sitting right by the swimming pool at the moment and Dan, Ryan and Grandad have just jumped in and are splashing around with a few other French people who are among them having a splash.&nbsp; Today has been okay so far.&nbsp; I woke up about 7:30 French time (which is a bit silly because France falls on the GMT time zone!) and went to the toilet... nice!  I went back to sleep for about an hour and was then woke up by the Grand'uns for breakfast.&nbsp; I wasn't really hungry to be honest, or I was just not in the mood for French food.&nbsp; I grabbed a bowl of museli and some jam on toast and got stuck in.&nbsp; After breakfast we left the restraunt (in a bit of a mess hehe) and went to the hotel rooms to decide what to do.&nbsp; We ended up going to Cité&nbsp; Europe, the massive mall which is full of shops that we've never heard of before lol.&nbsp; Daniel and Ryan bought these American tops with their 30 Euros, with an added injection of cash&nbsp;&nbsp; from Grandad of course!&nbsp; I haven’t spent a 'cent' on French soil yet...  We came back after careering around the shop bit at the end to get Dad some wine and stuff.&nbsp; Bored&nbsp; and a bit hot, we stayed in the hotel room for a short while and then made our way down to then pool about 3:00pm.&nbsp; It said it was closed so we waited around the lounge area until it opened.  So here I am beside the pool, writing this blog entry for the second day... in France!&nbsp; I will add a bit later after we've done some more worth blogging lol.&nbsp; Au Revoir! Back!&nbsp; Right then...  After the pool we went back up to the hotel room to drop things off/collect some things, and then we made our way into Calais town centre for a bite to eat.&nbsp; We found the 'English Spoken' London Bridge Pub where we had dinner.&nbsp; I ordered a massive pizza with a fried egg in the middle lol.&nbsp; I could only eat about half of it before I was really full up.&nbsp; A fayre was being installed beside where we were sitting which Ryan took an interest in, plus a gigantic plush Pikachu stuffed toy hanging inside one of the booths.  After we had dessert (I had a really nice raspberry sorbet with strawberry ice-cream) we went in the car to the beach, just as P&O Pride of Kent was arriving in port.&nbsp; There were about six ice-cream vans parked along the promenade.&nbsp; Well, when I say vans... They would be better described as ice-cream trucks!&nbsp; We walked past them anyway (Ryan wanted one after just having one for pudding) and walked along the pier, stretching along the dirty Calais water.&nbsp; Numberous boats could be seen across the horizon in great sunlight, which I couldn't capture on film due to me not bringing my camera out with me - doh!  The seaguls were playing silly buggers and running away from the waves which came in on the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan kept going "Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!" lmao.&nbsp; We made our way back to the hotel, and just as we were about to go around a round-a-bout before the hotel, HUNDREDS of cyclists appeared out of nowhere!&nbsp; I have preciously complimented France on the amount of cyclists, but I didn't expect there to be this many, and taking up the whole road wasn't exactly funny either, well - Hehe!&nbsp; We followed them into the hotel and everything.&nbsp; It turns out they were all English and staying here overnight.&nbsp; All of them had cycled from London earlier today and had arrived here this afternoon!&nbsp; Tomorrow they are heading off early to begin their journey to Paris by bike.&nbsp; They seemed like a really friendly bunch anyway, I was with a few in the lift for about 40 seconds and they didn't even try and see if I was French, they just said "Going up?" lol :-)  So here I am in bed at 00:42 French time, being naughty on the laptop when I should be getting to sleep lol.&nbsp; I've just had a shower and it's not that bad here.&nbsp; I discovered that a flashing light&nbsp; over the townscape view out of the window is the lighthouse at the harbour!&nbsp; I want to go there again tomorrow so that I can capture a lovely sunset in the ocean, if it is a nice clear day as was today.

       Set off about Ten in the morning (Grandma and Grandad were running a bit late) and traveled down to Dover via a few motorways and a long and tiring car journey.&nbsp; The M6 toll road is amazing and really empty!&nbsp; We finally arrived at Dover and boarded the ferry.&nbsp; Ryan has never been on one so he was a bit scared at first.&nbsp; Last night he said to Dan, "I'm sitting by the window!" The ferry set off and I started clicking my camera rapidly taking pictures of anything and everything.&nbsp; I got some really good pictures of seagulls which had decided to race the ferry lol.&nbsp; We arrived in Calais and swiftly parked at the nearest roadside parking area.&nbsp; Grandma went the loo in the Holiday Inn across the road and then we set off through the busy streets of Calais, and god were they busy.&nbsp; There were so many cyclists going up and down the road, an obvious difference from any UK city.&nbsp; Grandma bravely got a phone card from "La Tabac" or something, by saying "Par Lay Voo Arnglays" (spelt phonetically), and we managed to buy a phone card which we could ring England cheaply with. After walking back through the busy streets we made our way to our nice hotel.&nbsp; The entrance lobby is really cool looking and most of the staff speak "un peu" English, which is enough to get us by, plus I know quite a bit of French so we're okay.&nbsp; The view from our room is amazing.&nbsp; Near to the hotel is the Cité Europe shopping mega mall with tons of shops and low (hopefully) prices.&nbsp;  Later on in the day we decided to go swimming in the cool hotel pool.&nbsp; We got there and all hopes of a nice swim fizzled out when we found out that it is 'French law' that you're not allowed to wear swimming shorts for swimming!&nbsp; Instead you had to swear these skimpy swimming garments which resembled underwear.&nbsp; I really hated them so I didn't bother going swimming.&nbsp; I dunno, the French and their 'Tight' laws ;)&nbsp; Ryan, and Daniel (eventually) went in with Grandad but I just sat aside&nbsp; and watched with Grandma. Afterwards we were all hungry and decided to look for something to eat.&nbsp; By the time we had got round to it the restraunt had stopped serving and the only option left was room service, bar pizzas which were unavailable.&nbsp; I had this chicken curry and noodle type dish which was really tasty and not really spicy at all.&nbsp; Went to bed around midnight and I went hyper because it was night time and I had had way too much Fanta!

       Not a very dramatic exit to my English school life, but it happened anyway.&nbsp; I came home at dinner to see if my camera had come whilst I was at school, but it hadn't.&nbsp; The pain in my stomache was too much to bear any longer so I couldn't be arsed to go back to school because it hurt so much. &nbsp; So that's that.&nbsp; No more school for me!&nbsp; Probably not going back in September so it could be seriously - no more English school for me!&nbsp; And thank god for that, the system mainly sucks anyway.&nbsp; So what's happening in the Summer? &nbsp; Going France tomorrow, then going to London for a couple of nights afterwards!&nbsp; Lots of sights to see and pigeons to step on.&nbsp; Getting back sometime on Sunday and probably having a week or two at home.&nbsp; Hopefully then we will be going Alton Towers to stay in the hotel!&nbsp; I really wanna go back there it's so cool! &nbsp; I might not be able to post on my blog anywhere from France or London unless I'm lucky enough to find somewhere with Internet access.&nbsp; So until Sunday, cya!

       God I feel like crap today!&nbsp; Woke up at half 5 with terrible indigestion, which was really hard to get rid of.&nbsp; I was walking really funny because it hurt so much.&nbsp; I made my way downstairs and opened the medicene cupboard.&nbsp; The smell almost made me puke, let alone the rising acid from my stomache.&nbsp; I went to the loo and nearly fainted because I think I sat down too fast lol, I felt so sick!  &nbsp;  Getting the gory details of my morning sickness out of the way...  &nbsp;  I woke up by the alarm at 7:25 and discovered that my stomache ache had been reduced to a lesser terrible pain,&nbsp; It was still pissing me off anyway.&nbsp; Digital Camera didn't arrive in the post yet, but it could still arrive today (fingers crossed).&nbsp; Walked to school a little slowly due to my stomache, ARGH!  &nbsp;  I was greeted by about 6 flying ants on the table in Hulse's room, which I didn't notice were flying ants until I was shown loads more flying around the room like mad!&nbsp; I think they're really disgusting, but Becky was biffing them and chucking them in the bin lmao.&nbsp; The must have come from the dormant filing cabinets or something!&nbsp; Information Sytems was funny.&nbsp; Mrs. Checketts was asking the Sixth Form what biscuits they would like in an assembly they're having, and whether they would like tea, coffee or orange juice.  &nbsp;  Just had Physics and I did absolutely nothing at all because, to be honest, doing coursework on my last day (hopefully) is just pointless isnt it.&nbsp; Chris drew some cool things in my leaving book and we sat chatting.&nbsp; Mr. Pooley's laptop crashed and displayed lots of glitch sytle boxes all over the screen which kinda looked like something off The Matrix.&nbsp; Break was boring - period.&nbsp; I'm now in French and we're just sitting in the computer room doing things that are anything else but French.

       Cool day at school!  The Ministry of Defence came in and we had a few presentations and talks about what they did.  The army and navy guys were pretty arrogant and again, like all hard ass 'intelligent' and 'authoritive' army people, had an attitude problem.  At dinner I bought some stuff from Tesco along with a notebook for people to write stuff in as my last day at school might be Monday (going france Tuesday and might not be returning after the 6 weeks holiday!)  I got loads of cool stuff written in it so far and hopefully more on Monday.  I've bought a brand new amazing camera from eBay and if it arrives before or on Monday I will be able to get pictures of people too!  (If not I can use my old camera, which isn't as good)

       Yeah!  Today is one year since I started my blog last year, just days before going to America for the six week holiday!  I love reading back in my blog there is so much I have forgotten already.  The interest I have when reading past posts in my blog will never cease and will be really cool when I'm old and I can look back (if the Internet as we know it exists in the future) and read it and be amazed.  Today was boring.  We were back in normal 'lessons' but we didn't do much.  I was taken home after Games because my pulse had rocketed above 100 and I had done nothing purposely because I had no inhalers with me!  Weird or what...

       Wow what a cool day!  Our last Industry Day at school consisted of a cool morning activity which involved marketing a burger as if we were a fast food restraunt.  There was quite a bit of conflict because another group had chosen (by coincidence of course - unless they cheated it off us) the same name as us, "Burger Queen"  We changed ours to "Burger Queen's" and I made a cool jingle to promote the new Mini Burger.  The presentations were really good, except for ours.  We were last and it really sucked.  A certain member of the group went mardy about it, which was quite pathetic.  Dinner time was Hilarious!  Most of Year 10 had lines up from the bench area against the wall, sat down and spread out their legs in protest of the dinner ladies being such evil demons.  We have always had issues with the creatures and today was fight back time.  Becky was a great leader; the dinner ladies seem to really hate her!  After dinner we had to create a newspaper.  Ours was the best by far.  We had produced many pictures and cool reports which made it stand out from the others which most of were in black and white.  After school, Dad came and took us to the cinema to see Around the World in 80 Days, which was really cool.  Steve Coogan was good at acting as the main role.

       Had a really crap day at school today.  Everyone is wound up in their own little affairs and hypo attitudes towards the end of school, and some people are beyond excitement and can't wait for the term to come to a dead stop.  We did a cool murder mystery thing period one which didn't turn out to be quite the exciting murder mystery at all.  There were so many stupid clues that didn't mean a thing.  After that we did a funny army thing.  I say funny because the whole experiance was funny, but the work was physically demanding.  Just another bunch of army dimheads acting like they own you.  Loads of people stood up to them it was really funny because no matter how strict they were no-one cared.  We then made a tower out of spaghetti, or tried at least.  Two certan people pissed me off so much.  I really hate being forced to work with people who think they are really and are something that they're not.  They folowed suit in the next activity which was a cool piece of drama which would have been cool had they have evaporated unsuspectedly beforehand.  Dinner was bloody boring.  I hate hanging around 'friends', those especially who are obsessed with shouting and stuff like a seagul (I'm sorry but pidgeon doesn't describe it very well).  Certain people were dancing around and laughing at stupid things and I just think it's really rediculous how people can be jealous of their friend's new other half because they're getting more attention.  Sorry I'm ranting...  The afternoon was a lot better.  The dickheads were sitting out of Task 5 because they can be bothered to come to school and drag themselves, but not do anything - pathetic.  Task 6 was okay I guess.  We were in this toy factory and had to make little paper things and we decided to make truth or dare things.  I made an assortment of sizes and even a tiny baby version which was about 2cd by 2cm.  I'm in a great mood now anyway and just relaxing a bit after a pretty exhausting day at school.

       School today was okay slightly.  The project days have arrived and the school uniform is out the window for a few days.  I got put into a group with Mrs. Marsh.  It was quite fun really apart from the dickheads who sit there holding up the whole group and show us all up.  After school we had a cool barbeque party and loads of relatives and people came.  After a stupid day at school I wasn't feeling verye xcited so I just sat about eating stuff and drinking beer heh.  The champagne was so nice.  I was fine with the alcohol, but as soon as I ate a cake and sugar was rushing through my body I felt really weird as I always do after a sugary snack.  I hope tomorrow will be a better day at school...

       Hey!  The past few days have been pretty down but now Sheldon has arrived today after getting a last minute flight to Heathrow from Chicago    The day started well.  Craig invited me round to watch a movie and we had a laugh.  Sam turned up and went again soon after.  I went home around half past four and Shell and Mum were in the garden.  It's been a really cool day.  The approval has settled in now and we're rushing into the school holidays like there's no tomorrow    Can't wait to go to France next week and then have a couple of days in London to go sightseeing.  Lots of photo oppertunities!  This week at school is going to be interesting.  The first three days are just dossing around so t'will be fun

       Today has been really cool.  I went to the Cinema to see Shrek 2 and had a great time with everyone.  Sam and Annie are officially going out now (they make a great couple!) and so are Michaela and Craig!  That came as a complete shock to be honest... but oh well.  Sheldon's flight was all effed up because of the shitty airport service offered by United Airlines.  The departure and arrival times wouldn't stop changing.  Hopefully he will be here tomorrow early in the afternoon.  I hope he gets here alright and works out how to use an English payphone to ring Mum in the morning!  My PC has been going okay since my format (yep, had to do it AGAIN) so hopefully this time it will behave.  Cya!

       Application Type: I129F, PETITION FOR FIANCE(E)   Current Status:     This case has been  approved . On July 8, 2004, an approval notice was mailed. If 14 days have passed and you have not received this notice, you may wish to verify or update your address.        Speaks for itself doesn't it?!  BEER TIME!!  Sheldon's flights here were disrupted last night because his first flight to Chicage was late.  Mum told him about the approval on the phone.  I hope he gets here really soon!

       Sorry for not posting the last couple of days.  I've not been feeling too well due to a knawing headache and I have recently acquired a nasty sore throat.  I had my hair cut today and I'm having a sleepover tomorrow.  I dunno whats wrong with me.  I've been feeling a bit weird since last week and I feel a bit depressed and weird about freindships.  I can't put my finger on the problem exactly, I need a good think.  Night all...

       I am so pissed off!  Yesterday went up and down like a rollercoaster and I've just about had enough of computers argh!  I had just ifnished my coursework last night and restarted my PC innocently, only for it to die on me.  I managed to save my coursework on an NTFS DOS floppy disk quickly for today and here I am without a PC at the moment.  I've installed Windows on my backup partition and am just waiting now to format again so I can reinstall.  I just can't understand why my PC keeps doing this to me whenever I install XP.  Maybe there is some secret option I keep missing which states "Automatically delete some random important system files after 30 days", and of course, it is checked!  Anyway...  Today was kinda cool.  Started off okay in Maths, followed by a dos around lesson in ICT Shortcourse.  Geography was a nightmare.  Sam got sent out for tapping the desk (wtf?!!) and when he came back, Miss Taylor overheard me moan about it lol,  Whoops!  English was normal and ICT was really good.  Some people from Keele university had taken over our lesson for us to test out a beta version of a cool CD for kids about further education.  It was really good, the graphics were amazing and there was this cool little virtual game.  I gotta go now and sort out my computer... wheeee!

       Today was really funny and boring at the same time.  For 4 lessons I was in the computer room!  Because the school's computers really suck, it has been one of the most boring days ever.  Mrs. Checketts wasn't in today, but they still managed to keep the lesson waiting 20 minutes    We have started coursework in Chemistry and both Physics now (oh yess  ) and we did both lessons in... the computer room!  I've discovered that it is possible to set the keytones on some of the keys on the keyboard at school; yet another way to annoy teachers!  If you see me about at school I'll tell you how to do it so we can spread the key bleeping-ness    French was really boring.  We finished of our Coursework and I sat there doodling for half of the lesson.  Dinner was ok, but really boring.  We spent period 5 in Miss Humphries's uiet room because I didn't bring my ingredients.  It was fun in there anyway.  A certain person launched paper airplanes from the fire extinguisher lol!  Period 6 was in the library and me and Ross set the keytones on and got on Mrs. Gardener's and Miss Humphries's nerves lol.  So I guess the day has been okay, if you count the bleeping... *bleep*

       Today has been pretty up and down.  Woke up very early because the postman was at the door, but nothing for me.  I couldn't go back to bed really so I stayed up and have begun making a cool movie out of all the photographs and videos we got from Alton Towers.  It's going really well so far, in fact it is nearly finished.  It will not be appearing on the internet due to its file size!    I had the mad idea of revisiting the park tomorrow because we didn't cover amazing rides such as Air or the new Spinball Whizzer.  The original plan was just me and Sam to go again tomorrow, but when Sam couldn't go it changed from that to going with family, then asking Grandma and Grandad if they could take us all, but none of the plans were unfortunaly possible, however we are going to France and London in 2 weeks time!  We get to miss a couple of days off school and see loads of sights    Grandma also said we shall visit Alton Towers in the summer before we go and stay there in the hotel!  I can't wait!  Early rides and lots of fun planned ahead.  I went to Sam's 'party' about 7pm and we messed around and walked around for a bit.  James got drunk on some dodgy Dandelion and Burdock stuff and we were all ripping the piss   He lost one of his bottles it was so funny    All of the photos from Alton Towers are up in the Gallery including the On Ride photos and a video Sam took of us all on Oblivion!

       Never in months have I had such a bloody good day!  I spent well over £40, nearly give myself a heart attack and had an effing brilliant time out with my best mates.  Yes, I have been Alton Towers!  I haven't been for years and I was looking forward to this day so much!  Let me begin...  I met Craig at Tesco at half past eight, and then James and Sam.  We called for Chris and steven then made our way to the train station in town and waited impatiently for the magical bus that was to take us to the Towers.  We againa sked about the price and whether it included a return journey as well and was told that it was £7!  A little peeved off that we had been told it was free, then £5, then £7.  When the bus arrived, driven by a cheery lady, our questions had been answered.  The bloody bus was free wasn't it!  Happy and relieved, we ran into the bus and finally settled on the top deck.  I have never had such a noisy bus ride in my life.  A rowdy group of Girls and Indian people from London were shouting and singing all the way there and we chatted to this cool girl who sat in front of Chris.  On arrival the bus errupted with cheers (the rowdy bunch of girls thought it appropriate to start singing the Alton Towers theme tune  ).  We queued for about 20 mins and finally reached the ticket kiosk, hoping that our vouchers owuld be accepted for the discount ticket.  THe woman in the desk took the money and the ticket, scanned it and drew over the voucher and passed a map and ticket.... WE WERE IN!!     Relieved that the plans had worked out brilliantly, we headed straight over to Spinball Whizzer which twisted and turned its way throughout the queue and up into the air.  It is an amazing ride!  Unfortunately we didn't get to go on it, but it was a brilliant sight anyway.  Next stop, the toilets, followed closely by a ride on Oblivion.  Sam opted out and offered to record our silly trek around on one of the most intense coasters ever.  We queued for about an hour and then the ride came to a halt.  It had started raining slightly and people began to groan.  After about 10 minutes, the ride sprung back into life and everyone gave a cheer which could be heard everywhere lol.  We got closer and closer to the ride...    There we were, strapped in Oblivion and there was no turning back.  The cart began to escalate the track and we waved frantically so that Sam could see us and begin filming our daring adveunture.  The cart reached the summit and then our pulses begain to raise.  This was it!  We reached the end and faced down, then paused, followed byt he eerie, "Don't Look Down" said by the scary man.  WHOOOOOOSH!!!   We plummetted down the 200 foot verticle drop.  I screamed my bloody head off.  The ride was so intense you felt like you were free falling much faster than you would jumping off a building... face down!  After that I felt very shaken and my thoughts drifted over to the plan of going on... Nemesis!    We grabbed our photo (I look so tense!) and head to KFC for a bite or two to eat.  We had just finished ordering our food, decided there was nowhere to sit indoors and eat outside when the rain came down!  It was absolutely hammering it down and the poor people on Oblivion were escalating the track!  The got wet and dried all in the same ride lmao.  After a few minutes it went off and we made our way to Ug Land.  Everyone except for me (still shaken by Oblivion  ) went on the Corkscrew and then the Ug Swinger.  We made our way across the winding paths and gardens to Forbidden Valley.  We all had a go on Blade and then Chris and Steve went on Ripsaw whilst the rest of us went to check out Air.  If the queues were not so long, we would have gone on it no sweat!  It looks like an amazing coaster, not too fast and doesn't go into any large loops.  Pitty we couldn't go on it really   We all met back up and then went to Gloomy Wood.  The queue for Duel was nothing so we ran around the path and straight into the slanty building.  Couldn't help laughing at the zombie outside in his crypt with a laser gun.  We soon got onto the train carts and armed ourselves with the super cool laser guns.  We shot loads of spiders and zombies etc.  The ride was amazing.  It cut out half way through lol and broke down!  I added another photograph to my collection and we head off to Katanga Kanyon.  We went straight onto the Rapids.  We were really sure the people in front of us were smoking something naughty   It smelt nasty whatever it was!  Anyway, the ride.  We got on and zoomed around the entrance into the main body of the ride, splashes of water coming over the boat from all sides.  T'was really fun!  I was the only one who seemed to get completely soaked lol.  I got a wet bum   I got the photograph from this ride too!  We head towards Merrie England in hope that we could have a bath (on Flume  ) but the queues were much too big sadly   Me, Craig, and James hopped on the teacups and Sam took pictures of us spinning and spinning and spinning away!  We made our way back to the Spinball Whizzer for another look and messed around on the field taking photos.  We then spent our last minutes in the shops.  I bought some stuffed toys and pens etc. and we sat down for a bit, shortly leaving the park for our bus.  The bus arrived and we boarded and inhabited the front of the double decker on the top deck once again!  Everyone who we had seen earlier on our bus ride to the park boarded - except for the rowdy girls.  The bus set off, bye bye Alton Towers!  After an amazing day we were relieved, and a bit sad to be leaving.  We laughed so much when we spotted the rowdy girls lying down on the grass... outside the park!!  The bus driver had specifically said to wait where she had dropped us off.  Oh dear!  We had our own unique ride down the steep hills and tight roads of Alton and we recorded some of it.  We arrived in Stafford quite tired and very happy.  Me, Sam, and Craig walked home together and chatted about how cool the day had been and how well it had all worked out.  There were no problems with any vouchers or tickets and everyone had enjoyed themselves so much.  It is definitely worth a revisit sometime if possible!  All of the cheap deals end Sunday and I doubt there is a chance of going tomorrow!  This has been one hell of a blog post, and so it should be too   I shall post images of our day in the Gallery as soon as, and get the ride photos scanned shortly soon.  I keep thinking it is Saturday but we have 2 more days of school!  Poor teachers, sitting there at school while we poo'd ourselves on Oblivion

        (For full effect, imagine me whispering this post)   I have tried to go to sleep but I don't think it is possible.  I've reached the stage of ultimate boredom lying in bed and I've decided to update my blog.  I'm really excited about tomorrow, well it's today now  !  The muscles around my eyes are hurting now and I think it's time for sleep, if I can get any.  The guest list to the party has shrunk to 6 people and it could still go down yet.  Hopefully it won't of course.  I'm off now, or I'll be thrown around Nemesis half asleep... cya!

       Well, school is out for this week!  Absolutely cannot wait until tomorrow because me and my mates are going to Alton Towers for the day, yes, just my mates    Anyway, Food was hilarious - as in stupid.  French was hilariously long and stupid, Mrs. Bladon wasn't in and we had this funny substitute teacher with a shiny velvet coat.  English and Maths were average.  Dinnertime was mental.  Michaela and Annie had an argument, started by Kayla as usual.  She just can't get over the fact Sam doesn't want her back, so she takes it out on Annie.  I can't imagine what Sam's going through    The rest of the day was ok.  We had two spoons teaching rounders, but it was funny anyway.  Biology was a suprise.  We have now started our coursework, which I think is a bit close to the holidays, but anyway.  There were a few laughs in that lesson but I'm not going to elaborate on them.  Becky blatently attacked me on MSN because aparantly I have been bitching about stuff she has said in her blog.  When I'm sure I have done such a thing, I will apologise  , but until I do such a thing, she can go and have her little tantrum.    Anyway, gotta go, planning to do   Tomorrow is going to be GREAT!

       Well, my camera came yesterday, and it wasn't what I ordered!  It was a lot smaller, and basically did everything the one I ordered was supposed to do... only the pictures looked nothing like they would on the ordered one.  God I was mad!  I tried to like it, but I was ust too disappointed.  It has now turned into a gift for someone and I'm getting payed some money.  I have purchased the right one from a SHOP this time!  Screw eBay lol.  Anyway, apart from that little pain in the arse, my last couple have days have been really cool.  Been out a bit with everyone.  I went to see I, Robot last night and it was amazing!  There was one hilarious bit in it, where Will Smith sneezes suddenly and goes, "Sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit."  The trailers didn't look that good, but it turns out the movie was really good.  It was set in 2035 and there were some clever changes in technology etc.  Probably won't be staying in an Alton Towers themed suite now.  It doesn't matter that much though, we don't get any free merchandise or brilliant room, but Grandad is gonna buy us an Axcellerator Pass each, and they are about £72 each!  Dunno whats happening this week.  Won't be doing much, but next week the fun begins!  Lots of things to get done!

       Today has been funny and kinda 'cool'.  Sam was back this morning so we all went out and chilled a bit in Rowley Park.  We also went out this evening, we didn't do much, just sit around chatting on Meadow Road park.   Ryan's Rollercoaster Tycoon game came - but it wasn't what we ordered!  Poor Ryan, they had accidently sent him "Dora the Explorer - Backpack Adventure" LOLOL!  Aparantly we can't get a themed suite at Alton Towers until the 27th August, but Grandma and Grandad are going to keep trying to get us one.  Going Blackpool Pleasure Beach soon!  Dad's taking us... can't wait!

       Cool day today, not because it was full of events or activities or anything like that, but because it thundered really! I got a little wet after getting caught in it while watering the nextdoor neighbour's plants (as if they needed it lol)  No Sam today, aparantly he is back...now! He better be on MSN or something, we need to talk lol, and aparantly he has a tan to match his hair mwaha. I was invited out yet again today but I refused because there might have been people there that I aint comfortable around, but it turns out there wasn't and I missed being with my mates during that wicked thunder storm! The rain came down and lightning spread across the sky in all directions. The roads were flooding up and this 'porky woman' (as Ryan called her) was jumping up and down in a MASSIVE puddle lmao.  Then it cooled off for a bit and came back quietly later. I reckon the weather tomorrow is going to be perfect but I have a feeling it is going to be miserable again...  Oh yeah, I have recieved £90 for doing lots of website jobs for a friend, plus $5 payed into Paypal for the first survey I did on this amazing site. Saving now for lots of PC upgrades hehe...

       I would have posted yesterday but this wasn't working properly.  I've generally been in a down mood. My friends have been calling for me and asking me to come out but I really don't feel like it. When I'm down I get pissed off at stupid things lol.  We went town to pay for Visas and go to the dentist. My teeth are fine; I'm glad to see my new brushing regime has payed off. Saw a couple of people I wish I had rather not. I can't wait to move and get away from some pathetic people, but I want to stay for a certain few friends who haven't been getting on my nerves. I keep thinking against it though sometimes... what actually do I need to stay here for other than a few people?  Grandma has been given the go-ahead to book the suite at the Alton Towers hotel sometime in the month. I've been having way too many theme park dreams lol. For some reason, Oblivion is starting to scare me more than Nemesis, and I haven't even been on that (yet) but have been on Oblivion twice! Anyway, totally go on everything!  Sam's back tomorrow aparantly so I hope I might be able to go out with him and other mates to have a laugh, if I feel like it. The weather has been so crap today, Autumn is approaching!

       Yes, I'm posting at 2:45am because I'm hot, bored, tired, and I feel like writing a blog post with a bit of depth.&nbsp;  So, here I am in the last summer I will be&nbsp;experiencing in the UK for a long time.&nbsp; Ever since the approval everything has been speeding up so fast, and now we even have the date for our interview in London at the US Embassy.&nbsp; I can almost feel the plane taking off on that one way journey which we will soon be boarding, and it is only weeks away.  After coming home from the great break from reality in France and especially London, I have been soaking up the heat and laze of the school holidays.&nbsp; Blink-128 blasting on the speakers and any hardcore punk or emo&nbsp;music that takes my fancy really.&nbsp; Ordered my phunky new wireless mouse which arrived today, and is seriously wacky.&nbsp; It opens up a whole new chapter of bed-surfing and showing off moving the cursor from the far bedroom wall.&nbsp; The wicked digital camera I bought got send to Sheldon's house and is now on its way back to mee.  Can't wait to go to Alton Towers this month!&nbsp;&nbsp;We still haven't been able to give Grandma a&nbsp;date to book it because there's a chance we could bring the interview date forward, but I'm sure in 31 speedy days we shall be exiting the US Embassy happy and excited that the next day we shall be recieving 4 amazing 'tickets' to our near-future lives.&nbsp; It will be really cool to revisit Alton Towers again and be able to ride everything we want to (as long as we get a themed suite and the axellerator passes)&nbsp; I'm going to push myself on everything, from Black Hole to Air, and I don't care if it rains, it will be a more interesting experience!  Having already packed one case, my room is quite empty now, and very messy!&nbsp; My school uniform is sitting on top of the case I am soon to pack, as if to say "Where the hell am I supposed to go now!?"&nbsp; I wanted to burn it but we best keep it, just in case.&nbsp; That's what Mum said anyway, but I don't see myself returning to that excuse&nbsp;of a&nbsp;"civilised comunity!"  I'm going to learn to drive as soon as I can when I move because I want to get the hang of it at an early age.&nbsp; I am a little nervous, but who wouldn't be if they were going to be driving soon on busy roads and in America as well!&nbsp; I really can't wait to get over there and start getting used to it all.&nbsp; I'm sure there are a lot of differences to our road system etc.  Becky and Chris want to come and wave me off at the airport when I leave, which is really nice.&nbsp; I can't believe I'm going to be leaving all my close friends and people I can talk to back here while I bugger off and start my new life.&nbsp; There is still MSN and everything but it won't be the same.&nbsp; I can't wait to come back when I'm 18, and I haven't even left yet!&nbsp; I never knew growing up could be so much fun.&nbsp; My friends keep on saying they want to come and visit me and have holidays in Texas and stuff after I've gone.&nbsp; Most of it is probably just fantasy, but I can imagine some of them coming over in the future, I;m sure whatever happens, it will be a right laugh.  So here I am, the clock has turned 3:24 and I have been sitting here for about 30 minutes writing this.&nbsp; My wireless mouse is on charge (because I keep using it up!) and I think I'll go to bed and listen to some Enya... mwhahaha!
