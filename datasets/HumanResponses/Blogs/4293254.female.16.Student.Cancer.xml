      I'm glad in a sense my masks aren't working, but in another I wish I'd stop crying. I'm coming off as pissed off to some teachers. Yes I am down. I'm down, that my boyfriend is leaving for Elon this weekend. His parent's won't let him have the fucking car even though he's paid at least a good $1000 on it. And it's not like they need it either considering they have two cars already. I'm overwhelmed by my honors classes and I doubt the homework will be letting up anytime soon. I know I'm screwed for this year. I'm going to end up at the bottom of my class I see it already. I'm a failure. I wish they'd stop posting grades because I compare myself to others(even though the names aren't listed). I see it already. Branded across my forehead: FAILURE AT LIFE! I can't believe what I've become. I love my hate myself and hate myself all in one futile breath. Is this all I think to myself, before I pull my face out from the pillow in the morning. Sometimes I wish I could lie there all day. Somedays I think I'm dead walking around in some girls body, then again maybe I am... Maybe this is just the clueless ramblings of my depression. Why am I this way? Am I getting suicidal I think to myself? I constantly think of placing the knife into my veins over and over again until I'm drenched in blood. Is this a beautiful thought? I don't know. This quickly moves out of my head. I'm better now, I don't want to return to the places I've been I can do better than THAT. I'm soooo fucked up right now, then again, when will I not be fucked up? -Nikki

      Hello to the World that doesn't know I exist, Today, when I went into to Chemistry I Honors we were suppose to turn in our measuring the thickness of foil project(which I pretty much felt like I did the whole project), a couple of the people in my group came up to me and asked if I had turned it in. When I replied with a quiet "yes," they didn't respond or anything they just walked away. I didn't receive a thanks or anything. This is after I discovered how to find out how thick a piece of foil is by doing research, typing up and editing all the bull shit they screwed up on, and so forth. Maybe I am being a little hasty, but my time is very valuable to me. Last night I didn't have time to finish all my homework because I was editing "OUR" paper. I though a group paper, was suppose to be a group "effort." Next time I'm doing the work on my own. Christ, I might as well. -Nikki

      Hello There My dear World,I'm extremly ADD today. My mind has been wandering off all this morning. At church I only had one kid in my room which I was glad because if I had more I'd probably loose them and their parents would be very afraid. My psychologist told me I need to think of positive things I like about myself: I like: that I look older than my age, my hair, my smile, my eyes, you know something I never realized this, but I think the reason why my mind is always thinking about kind of sad things is because I kind of enjoy thinking about my life... I mean my life is like the average american family. Which says a lot for society. Hmmm.... Woah... Off topic AGAIN!!! Anyways I have some Honors reading assignments I have to do so I better go. Love,Nikki

      -Something weird happened in my dream last night , when I opened my wallet, I had a ton of like $1 in foreign money, bute the thing was that it wasn't all 1 bills. -I think this is my subconious trying to tell me something about myself. I've been having a hard time lately at school. I've been putting in a lote of effort though. My schedule goes like this: Honors Chemistry 1Honors Environmental ScienceHonors English IIIHonors Integrated Math IV QuantativeA LunchHonors Civics and Economics (a bunch of 10th graders)Spanish II (they don't have honors for this class)Newspaper (Editor and Cheif) -Also, Mrs. Kraft the Student Council teacher wants me to run for President, I want to, but the question is: Am I doing it for myself? Or for Mrs. Kraft? For the school? Or for who? -I broke down today at school though, I started crying in the hallway, what was I crying over? Stress I suppose, and I was extremly overwhelmed. My homework is rough, not rough, but when it adds up in all 7 classes it covers my night. Boy, am I glad I don't have a job I'd be screwed over. I'll stick with Church. I'm so depressed right now... I better go do stuff, before Charlie(Hurricane) comes. Love,Nikki

      Let's think about what good therapy did today for me? Hmmm... NOTHING!! It only made me realize how much more I hate being stuck in the skin I'm in. Why is life so fucking difficult? I mean yes I know "no body said life was going to be easy," but fuck how in the great glorius world could so much drama and shit happen to me. Let's see... Both of my brothers suffer from different forms of schizophrenia along with depression, my mom has MS and refuses to use her crutches even when she's in extreme pain, my father is so fucked up he doesn't realize others have feelings and has so many money problems I don't even want to think about it. God, you know, sometimes I look around at people and think why do you have it so fucking good? Who said you could have everyone worship you? I have an idea next time your MOM HAS TROUBLE WALKING OR IS HAVING SPASMS YOU CAN TAKE THE DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL TO TAKE CARE OF HER? HOW 'BOUT THAT UH?? You know WHAT AND THE NEXT TIME A TEACHER SAYS THEIR TIME IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE I CAN TELL THEM WHAT I'M GIVING UP TO BE THERE, because you know what- they've had their parent's their parent's have supported them, but what about me? ASS HOLESS, ASS HOLES!!! ALSO NEXT TIME I WORK MY ASS OFF AT CHURCH I HOPE EVERYONE NOTICES THE SHIT I GO THROUGH FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I WORK SO DAMN HARD TO GET THE MONEY I GET, SO DON'T WHINE AND BITCH ABOUT HOW LITTLE OF A PAYCHECK YOU GOT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT MY PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOUR FAMILIES HAVE? SO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL THE FUCKING THINGS YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE THAT I DON'T AND YOU KNOW WHAT, STOP BITCHING ABOUT HOW YOUR PARENT'S SUCK BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU will need them more than ever, and you know what they'll be gone. Why am I sitting here writing such an angry letter to the world, a huge part of it is because I'd like to be said "goodbye" to or invited to go along with some of you guys to the things you do? You know what I don't hate you, I'm jealous of everything that you have that I don't. Lisa- I'm jealous that your dad cares about you enough to look at you, and that people are constantly taking care of you, even though this is also a bad thing. Sofie- Your slimness, and occassionally your humor even though it can be brutal. Miranda- Your so sweet,and kind and I think you really do love yourself deep down. Sara G.- Your parents even though you hate them soooo much they are able to be REAL with you, and tell you what they think, oh and lets not forget that its good to have our baby fat! Karen- Your ability to keep a secret, and hold it... I will finish this later.. I do love you all but please realize I'm human too... love,Nikki

      Last night was fun, sort of. I woke up early yesturday day and went into school to work on the newspapers new office. I got to school around 8 am and then left around 4pm in the evening. Mom and I headed to the bank because on tuesday the atm ate my check without crediting my account. After taking care of that we drove my Wendy's to pick up something. God I hate fast food, it's so greasy, but we didn't have time to make anything, so I settled for a small burger, fries and a frosty. After wiping off the grease I finally ate my food. Stopped in at home to change then we went back to DSA (my school) for Orientation. Orientation was okay, but didn't realize until later that I didn't get Chemistry Honors like I had signed up for which makes me ANGRY!!! But I put in a drop add form and I'm a little worried might change the status of my Honors Envir. Science Class, but I was told it wouldn't. Anywho, later when I got home I talked to John on the phone for a little while. I really enjoyed it, I couldn't stop laughing, we're going to go bar hopping on Sunday! YAHOO! lol Anyways I have to go, I'm sitting on my floor in the buff, so yeah, I'm hungry... lol buh bye love,Nikki

      My day was soooooo fulll today, and I feel terrible. I woke up this morning to go to school and work on NEWSPAPER stuff until 4pm. Well at 4pm I headed over to my mom's work and about 5 mins later headed over to Carrboro for my writing class. I was late for my writing class by about 20 mins. as usual. After the class ended around 6pm I had to wait around for an hour. During that hour I was learning or rather attempting to learn how to hemp... geez I suck at hemping. Sorry John, I had a cool idea for a new bracelet for you too... That's another thing, I was thinking alot today about how it turned out I wasn't going to be able to go to game night right after I promised John S. I'd come. My mom is having issues though right now with what John and I had talked about. Hmmm.... Anywho .... I'm really tired and I have to go to school again tomorrow to continue working and organizing the newspaper stuff so I better go to bed... hehehe GO TO BED... With who?? no one :( lol love,Nikki

      I can't believe all the crazy things that happened this past weekend. The weird part of it is, is that everything is working out okay, I guess. It seems interesting the way Sofie called me a blabber mouth a while ago, and then wonders why she "bothers" me. I guess why Sofie suddenly comes to mind is because of all the people invovled in this situation I think she could be the one to "handle" it better. I understand where Drew came from, yes he did break a few bonds, but it's not like John didn't already know who liked him. It's rather obvious. The thing is, is that I don't think people realized how close John and Nicole were because the way everyone is acting right after they broke up is insane. I don't know this is just my opinion, maybe I'm rather confused. All I know is I care about John and I hope he takes his time recooperating. love,Nikki
