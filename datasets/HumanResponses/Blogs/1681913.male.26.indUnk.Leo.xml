       BEHOLD!  Humans demanded it, so I delivered.  Two new links on the left (now) MC Frontalot, Nerdcore Rapper Extrodinaire, and Sametown Blues.  Sametown is a site that is held together by sheer human will and lots of gin.  I charge you to go and browse through the illustrious photo galleries (keep an eye out for Ron Jeremy and Chuck Palahniuk) also download and read the script, it is excellent.  Don't forget to  Ask Dusto  while you're there.  Don't look into this, but he's a certified psychiatrist as far as you know.  YOWZA! YOWZA!  Don't be a fucking clyde.  Go Now!

       mood: stoked  Yo.  It's vaguely Wednesday.  I just woke up, and I'm not as sore today, which is nice.  It's proably all those  urlLink equestrian muscle relaxers  I've been taking.  Last night was freaking movie night around these parts and I have to say it was  urlLink Colin Farrell -riffic.  What with  urlLink Daredevil  and  urlLink Phone Booth .  But I also got some  urlLink Lupin III  (that Zenigata is one messed up dude) and some  urlLink Japanese  flick called  urlLink Fulltime Killer .  I also got  urlLink Two Weeks Notice  because I have an anomalous hankering for the romantic comedy, plus Hugh Grant is a funny dude.  Gin and I watched Daredevil and Two Weeks Notice last night, neither of which she said she was going to have much interest in.  But after movie's end she seemed to not be disgusted by either of them.  I didn't see DD in theaters, but I was highly interested in it.  I've always liked Daredevil, but thanks, mostly, to  urlLink Kevin Smith's  Guardian Devil run, DD has become relevant again.  Not since Frank Miller's run on the book in the early 80's had it been that good.  After Kevin, people like  urlLink Brian Michael Bendis ,  urlLink Jeph Loeb  and  urlLink David Mack  kept it good.  As a fan of DD I enjoyed the movie a great deal.  The SFX were cool, the story was cool and the costumes were pretty boss.  However, as a group, we should hunt down the Director, Mark Steven Johnson, and kill him and his family for casting Ben Affleck as Double D.  And I like Ben Affleck.  I hope Mark Steven Johnson doesn't fuck up the casting to Ghost Rider as well, becasue GR is very dear to my heart and if he picks someone like Nicholas Cage I will find him and beat him like Rocky beat that side of beef.  (it's probably already set in stone, though. Billy?)  Enough of this, I'm getting all riled up.   Anyway I still have to insult you bastards.  wait for it...  waaaiiiittt for it....  and...  You people have a stench about you, similar in nature to that of a fluke.  laters.

These are amongst my very favorite websites, and seeing as I took the time to write the links out in HTML then you bastards can take the time to read through some of them.  Seem fair?    One thing to keep in mind:  Perversion tracker doesn't work so hot on PC's running, well, any browser.  So don't be shocked if it looks like crap, because I assure you it looks stunning on my Mac running  urlLink Safari  also, it's not perversion as in sex acts, it's perversion as in crimes against software.  peas.

       mood: sane  Is sane a mood?  Or is it more of a mental thing?  Hmmm...well, anyway, moving day has arrived and The Tiny Little God (my mac) has to go into its box, you know, so it doesn't try to hump the other computers.  You think caging a gig of RAM is easy?  It's like trying to put shoes on a shark, you know, if sharks had feet or any leg-like apendages what-so-ever.  It's got to be free, man.  Free.  Listen, I've got to go hide the porn, and pack my clothes (read: stuff them in trash bags) so I'll see you either late tomorrow or on Tuesday, which if you didn't know is my birthday.  What I'm trying to say is, if you don't bring me a present or a delicious treat, I will hunt you down like that Predator hunted Arnold, only you will not outsmart me and hit me with a bid spiked log.  But if you did, keep in mind, that I have one of those arm thingies.  Yeah.

       mood: reflective  After we watched [adult swim] I got to thinking and when I said "Manga" in my last post, I might've meant "Amime".  Are they synonymical?  Or is it synonomous?  It remains a mystery.  Anywho - I think they might be interchangeable.  I know that there is a company, started in 1998 by Island Records (U2, Insane Clown Posse) founder, Chris Blackwell, called Manga Entertainment Inc.  They are a film company, responsible for some of the more well known animes, such as Ghost In The Shell, Macross Plus, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Ninja Scroll, coming to america with decent dubbing.  For some reason I always thought that manga was the print form, whereas anime was the animated version (hence the name and all).  I wish I knew a Japanese dude so I could ask him if he knows, also I could ask him to hook me up with his sister if she wasn't too young.  mmmm...asian.  Bet you fatheads didn't realize I was so au fait when it came to American corporations getting rich off of Japanese culture.  Well I am, so kowtow before my indomitable encephalon.  Nice sentence.  booya!  And that's how we solved the mystery of the word 'manga'.

       mood: seemingly content  Thursday, huh?  Thursday's are renown for excelling at the art of suckery.  But, today....well, today was absolutely no different.  Today's levels of suckishness have previously only been toyed with by mortal men.  Actually I justed wanted say 'art of suckery'.  I think it's funny.  And, seeing as this is my blog, I will do as I damn well please.  Shut up!  Get off my back!    Do you think Thursdays need a theme?  You know, like on Tuesdays when I make you more intelligenter what with the word of the day and all.  Similar, as well, to Wednesdays when I poke your feelings with a big stick, and then step on them, and then set them on fire, and then invent a machine that burns things after they've already been burned and re-burn them.  You get the point I'm sure.  Anyway, themes was the topic, right?  Ah, who cares.  I'm moving this weekend as well as Monday and, probably Tuesday.  Which means, unless I use one of the several computers available to me (other than mine), I will not be posting.  I know, I know you're heartbroken.  But it's ok, I'll be back real soon.  Anyway, sniff you jerks later, it's time for Big O.  Theme song is weird, but beginning to grow on me.  mmmmm...Manga.

       mood: spiteful  It's Wednesday, that means it's Horrible Insult Day here at Nick HQ.  Meaning that I get to insult my precious readers.  Not that this is an uncommon practice as it stands, only now it's got a title and an official day of the week.  Standby for insult...  3... 2... 1...  You readers are an assbunch.  That is to say, a bunch of asses.  Well, that wasn't great but it was the first one.  I don't want to blow my wad on the first one, now do I?  I still have to get my Insult Legs.  You know, kind of like sea legs, except with less sea and more name calling.    Anyway... there was one more thing I wanted to share with you.  Today on my way home from work, there was this beat-up-ass Acura driving in the lane next to me, and this fellow's car was, literally, vomiting exhaust.  It was like a fume geyser.  Now Lawrence, for the most part, is nice enough, but I'm tired of seeing all these stench ridden hippies come into kinkos making their little 'Save The Earth' flyers on 100% recycled paper, and then stapling them to telephone poles.  And once they're finished desecrating a piece of city property, they befoul the sky by driving away in a car that's being followed by a thunderhead of noxious effluvium.  What they should do, instead of stapling they're message next to a handbill for "Blake's Going-Away Kegger at the SigEp House", is save their hard panhandled money and by a God Damn hybrid electric car.  Like that ugly one that Honda makes or the ugly one that Toyota makes.  I heard that actions speak louder than words, anyway.  Don't get me wrong I'm not a fucking enviro-nazi, I just hate hippies and hypocrites.  Wow, those words sure are similar.

       mood: contemplative  What up?  It's Tuesday again.  Please take notice that the "no smoking" and "fasten seat belt" signs have been turned off.  Feel free to move about the cabin.  Also the captain advised me to tell you that if anymore people are caught having sex in the mini-kitchen he will turn this plane around.  God Damn sinners.  The only pure people left are me and Steve Jobs.  God Bless your pure soul Mister Jobs.  Demons dare not speak his name lest their mouths be devoured by flame and searing lava.  oh by the way, the word of the day today is:  aggrandize \uh-GRAN-dyz; AG-ruhn-dyz\, transitive verb:  1. To make great or greater; to enlarge; to increase.  2. To make great or greater in power, rank, reputation, or wealth; -- applied to persons, countries, etc.  3. To make appear great or greater; to exalt.   Transitive verbs rule!

       mood: abashed  Apparently there is some discussion about the year that Georgia became a state, as well.  I found several websites dating Georgia's entry into the union as 1776, some say 1788.  But let's start at the beginning.  Georgia became a colony in 1732.  A colony is defined as "a group of emigrants or their descendants who settle in a distant territory but remain subject to or closely associated with the parent country."  By 1776 their population had skyrocketed to a whopping 40,000 and they were no longer closely associated with their home country or the king who had signed the royal charter establishing the colony in the first place, thereby debunking the very definition of "colony".  Also, in 1776 something known as The Declaration of Independence was signed.  The last statement of this document is "these United Colonies are...Free and Independent States."  In 1777 the Georgia Constitution named counties after Cherokee and Creek Indians finally ceded the land, counties are indicative of a state.  In conclusion, I move that an independent state government, a state constitution, and counties make Georgia more of state than the signing of a federal constitution on January 2, 1788.   You can make your own decisions based on the information I've provided.  However if you think I'm being biased or making stuff up I submit to you a bibliography containing the sources from which my True and Unerring information was obtained.  Krakow, Kenneth. Georgia Place Names. Macon, GA: Winship Press, 1994  Coleman, Kenneth. A History of Georgia. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1991  Bryant, Pat. Georgia Counties: Their Changing Boundaries. Atlanta: State Printing Office, 1983  The Georgia Studies Book: Our State and Nation (Athens, Ga.: Carl Vinson Institute of Government, 1998) and The Georgia Official and Statistical Register  The Declaration of Independence: http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDERAL/independ/declar.html  These tomes and texts will provide you with the answers you seek in reagrds to Georgia's Statehood.

       mood:  vexed  So, another Naked Monday come and gone.  I hafta say that this was the best one ever.  Turnout reached an all-time high, and what about satisfaction you may ask.  Well, satisfaction was guaranteed.  Although it's still, technically, Naked Monday I had to call it early this year because I just wasn't focused.  I kept thinking about what all you bastards said over the weekend.  I tell all of you about the Glory and Illustriousness of N.M. and all you people can say is "You spelled 'because' wrong in your last post".  Oh well, excuse the fuck out of me.  I didn't realize you all held rank in the Conjunctive Police.  God forbid you say "Congratulations on N.M., Nick.  It sounds rad."  Or how about "I love you, Nick.  You are a lodestar of magnanimity, and I strive to emulate you."  But, no.  It's "You spelled a single accursed word wrong you God Damned tomfool.  We are Superior in perpetuity, whereas you are, unchangingly, an oaf, as we stated before."   So in deference to all you Johnny-Spell-Good's out there this next section is for you.  Toodae I wuz at wurk, it wuz fun.  I got too play wif the big musheens, thay ar neis.  I calld my bos a bad naim, and hee laffed.  The naim wuz "DooshBag".  I call lots uv peepull DooshBags.  Yoo, for instinz, ar all DooshBags.  I hope that did a little something for you.  Now, I hope I didn't give you the wrong impression, I'm not mad or anything.  I always appreciate criticism, as long as the criticism cannot be perceived as bad or negative in any format, frame, or guise.  Savvy?

       mood: restive yet complacent  I'm not sure if it was becasue I was vague or enigmatic, or if it's because some of you are slow, but aparently the concept of Naked Monday is a hard one to grasp.   Let me break it down for you in terms that even the "most layest" of laymen can apprehend. 1) naked girls come over 2) i do them 3) sleep 4) girls fix me a sandwich on their way out passably simple, I think.  But seriously if you are still unclear, email me and we can either discuss it or I can send you a flowchart (read: a Naked Monday coloring book).  savvy?

       mood: calm  It's Friday.  We all know what that means... that's right, only 3 more days until Naked Monday!  Naked Monday is a praxis older than a Georgia sunrise. (Georgia became a state in 1776, do the math)  Anyhow, Naked Monday is comprised of a pilgrimage to my house by many many attractive naked women coming to claim their Naked Monday prize.  The prize is hidden and there will be a scavenger hunt to find it (here's a subtle hint for all you contestants:  The prize is located in my pants)  Any men or unattractive women trying to pass themselves off as attrctive young women will be exposed as a charlatan and then sentenced to death by slitting.  We don't fuck around when it comes to Naked Monday.  So tell your friends, and by friends I mean Hot Naked Chicks that want to root around in my pants for a while with their friends.  If you are a Hot Naked Chick and want to attend, but need a ride, please contact our carpool office at 1-800-nicks-pants.  Long Live Naked Monday!

       You think W is going to get re-elected?  The smart money is on no.  And, all though money does run this country, only a small portion of it is smart.  People without the knowledge, whether it be through stupidity or apathy, only know two things for sure: evil was smote and they got a three hundred dollar check in the mail.  That's enough for the general (read: ignorant) public to cast their vote for the "Man Hoo Wood Bee Presidint (again)".  Perhaps I am misjudging the public, but, from what I've seen the only place W seems to catch flak is overseas, and unfortunately, last time I checked they don't get to vote for our president.  I know Franklin's frightening mistrust of all things governmental, and my father's distaste for Jr., and indeed republicans at large, will garner me a few emails "setting me straight".  I don't think on politics overmuch, it starts to hurt my brain after awhile, but I've noticed a few things:  1) With all the aberrant humanity I've seen in my day, I say God bless the electoral college!  Keep the vote out of the idiot's hands. (Not you guys, you're swell)  and  2) Me being surprised by The Public, en masse, is not without historical synonym, so perhaps there is hope that John Edwards or That Other Guy The Democrats Have will win.  Either way it really doesn't effect me considerably.  I'm just trying to encite a brannigan.

       This goes out to all me peeps in the service industry and retail.  Any of you who work in these fields and also chat with me on Messenger know that my current Screen Name speaks volumes about pesky individuals known by some as customers.  My screen name, for those of you who don't chat with me, is "Customers Suck".  They are vile and dispicable creatures who, I believe, come out of the sewers at the break of dawn and walk the streets preying on unsuspecting and overly chipper clerks.  In their wake they leave said clerks with musings of Post Office and Columbine reenactments.  Perhaps my sister is right in thinking that these people are clerks themselves, who, in an effort to not violently rend someones flesh from their skull, go to places where they can behave as badly as the people who mistreated them.  I don't see how this helps.  Clerks, no matter where they work, are in this crazy retail boat together, so why treat each other like shit, just for catharsis' sake?  I still think they are creatures from the underdark who have to anger innocents to feed on their emotions, like some sort of Jungian lamprey.

        We're All Going To Die!   Seriously.  Maybe not today, but someday.  It was just a simple reminder.  By the by, Mars is going to be Über close to earth tonight, and even closer tomorrow night.  After that it starts getting farther away again.  When I say close, I don't think you humans understand  exactly  how close I mean.  34.5-ish million miles.  That's fucking close.  You will be able to see the ice caps with binoculars.  So I implore you to go gaze upon the Heavans, and see the natural beauty of the unexplored.  On a more serious note, did I mention how fucking awesome my Fantasy Football team is.  I did?  Well, shit.  Then I have nothing to say to you.  Except this.  Today's word of the day is:  vainglory \VAYN-glor-ee; vayn-GLOR-ee\, noun: 1.

        Monday, Bloody Monday   The world must know that I busted my ass today at work.  "But, Nick, how much ass-busting was there,  really ?"  Believe me when I tell you, good people, that it was  lots .  And now that I've suffered at work I will make the do-wells suffer, similarly, at my hand.  May the force be with me, indeed.  The Republic, for too long, has been a thorn in the Sith's side.  Now is the time for The Sith to rise and take our proper place amongst the galactic hierarchy, and crush the puny Jedi in the ever-clenched fist of the Emperor.  Kneel before Darth Nick!  Uh, yeah.  Reality, sort of, slipped away from me there for a minute.  But I'm back now.  My fantasy football league had its draft over the weekend, and let me tell you I wouldn't want to be my opponent right now.  Oh no.  They will feel the implacable vengeance of my spiteful wrath.  They called me foolish for drafting Tampa's D. in the first round.  Well, we shall soon see who is foolish and who is, um,  not  foolish.  (here's a hint:  I won't be foolish and they will)  Indeed, The Lord, Our God, Warren Sapp and his band of roughnecks will lay waste to the foolish mortals who stand before them searching every inch of the steadily shrinking field for a sign of an open reciever or a gap in the line.  But where one should be, none will be found.  Instead they will only find pain and humiliation.  So it is written, so shall it be done.  Please recieve my prayer O Lord, In Sapp's name we pray, amen.  This Post Brought To You By  urlLink GE .  "Nuclear Weapons Now 32% More Energy Efficient!"

        Sweet Zombie Jesus!   I am so tired.  I have been playing Knights of the Old Republic for the last 7 hours.  I haven't sat on my ass and continually played video games like that in a long while.  This game is awesome.  And by awesome, I mean we should put it on a pedestal and build a little golden shrine to it and worship it.   I can sense your seething jealousy from my pleasant, air conditioned home.  It's kind of pissing me off though.  I am trying my damnedest to become an all powerful warrior of the Sith, and I keep inadvertantly gaining Light Side Points.  See, I'm afraid if I don't help certain people that I'll miss some important part of the game.  The people that roll with me already think I'm a real shithead because I won't listen to their problems and I keep charging for my services, they're all "you shouldn't do that, the people need that cure."  and I'm all "Fuck you, Twi'Lek I gots to get paid."  But try as I might I can't get many Dark Side Points.  Oh, I got a few already.  I killed some drunk guys that were starting shit, and I did a couple hits for the Hutts, (hits for the Hutts!  HA!) but I swear you save one wookie and your force alignment is right back where it started, dead middle.  Oh it gets better, after I saved his dumb ass the hairball swore a lifedebt to me, now I can't shake his good aligned ass.  How's a brother supposed to get his Dark Jedi on when he's rolling around with three Light Force users.  It's not fair I tell you.  I don't ask for much, a little Force Choke here, a little Force Lightning there, but no.  It's all puppy dogs and ice cream cones.  Ugh.  Fucking do-good Light Side hippies.  But I digress.    Sorry for the late post by the by.  I was focusing my talents elsewhere, as stated above.  Plus, I hate you.  Ok, I don't hate you, I merely mildly loathe you.  I want to go to bed, but I feel inclind to read the instruction book now that I'm seven hours into the game.  You know what?  I  am  going to bed.  Screw you, you penniless hippies!

        Peking Shrimp!   Today, huh?  Well... today was different.  Fer damn sure.  I don't know what to talk about first.  Let's see.  There was the water pipe breaking.  The AC being off for several hours.  Or the exploding men's bathroom.  Also the cash registers all broke.  Hmm... nope can't decide, I'll just forget the whole thing.  Still it was better than last Thursday.    Tomorrow's Friday.  What can I say but hot-diggity-daffodil!  I'm thinking of following my own advice and purchasing an X-Box.  The reasons are 3 fold.  1) HALO/HALO2  2) Knights of the Old Republic and lastly 3) DnD Heroes.  These games, only on X-Box, are the main reasons but there are many other games out or soon-to-be released that I want, like Soul Calibur 2 and Guilty Gear XX.  Ok so "many" was a little excessive, I should've said "two".  Don't get me wrong, I love my PS2 and the games out for it are awesome, hell I can even get GGXX and SC2 for the PS2.  That's a lot of acronyms.  The point is I  have  to have Knights of the Old Republic.  Have to. Have to. Have to.  Savvy?  The rest of those games, although awesome, can jump off a metaphorical cliff.  If ever there was an item that could be classified as The Shit, then KOTOR is it.  The Shiznit, even.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, then just leave.  No one here likes you.  Stop hanging around us.  Don't make me call the police.  Because, I will.  What have we learned today?  Not a lot.  That much is clear.  In Other News: Beefeater brand gin makes a man mean.

        Um, Sorry...   Yeah, I know you're probably terribly worried about me after a no-post yesterday, it was word of the day too.  But the fact is I was going to post when Blue Gender came on, becasue that show is not cool.  Not  as  cool, anyway.  Unfortunately, I fell a-fucking-sleep and missed FLCL and Futurama.  Damn my human circadian rhythm.  But I am alive and well, so you can go back to your ice cream now.  I will generously provide you with an insult and a word-of-the-day today to make amends for my grievous crime.  I promise to not let it happen too often, as I don't wnt to lose my two (2) dedicated readers.  My good, kind, lovable friend Fire is working on a website for himself (see, he usually makes them for other people) and he has cordially invited me to be a part of it.  If it happens the URL of this blog will be changing, but it will still contain all of it's chocolatey goodness.  I will also be upgrading to Blogger Pro (if they ever get their damn ordering system back up) which will allow me to post pictures, and have forums.  I will also be able to track hits, which is nice since it will let me see how often my two (2) dedicated readers are checking it.  This is kind of exciting for me.  Be happy for me dammit!  Travel as fast as your mortal legs will carry you and buy  urlLink this .  You will need one of  urlLink these  to use it.  I-O-T-D: I saw your Mom on the Street Corner the other day and went over to talk to her.  I said "Hey, I didn't know you were back from vacation already."  See, cause she's a whore.  W-O-T-D: bucolic \byoo-KOL-ik\, adjective: 1. Relating to or typical of the countryside or its people; rustic. 2. Of or pertaining to the life and occupation of a shepherd; pastoral.

        Mike Hates People From Maine   He does.  He told me himself.  Hater.  Aparently they (people from Maine) use excessive names when addressing each other, and although I have no documentation of this, Mike only lies when it's really really important.  "No Nick, I didn't have that hit put on you.  It was some other guy."    So, yeah.  Today, though not sparkling, was fucking metric tons better than last monday.  I say metric because today did harbor an  urlLink intrinsic gayness  found only in Canada and France.  It's hard to put my finger on it, so to speak, but it was unequivocally there.  I think the fountain might have something to do with it.  Yes, we have a fountain in the break room at my  urlLink work .  It's supposed to provoke some sort of wistful, zen-like state while we eat our peanut butter & jellys or our microwave macaroni and cheese.  The fucking thing plugs into the wall!  How in the hell am I supposed center myself using an electric fountain, fake plants and an off-brand jambox!?  I'm not saying they aren't nice amenities, I just find it difficult to focus my Chi in that particular setting.  You wouldn't undersatnd, it's a Monk thing.  Moving on.  For those of you who find it difficult to check this Blog 5 whole days a week I will be summing up the previous week for you in two sentences every Monday.  Beginning today.  Here goes:  FLCL owns and work sucks.  I like Football and eating alot.  That's pretty much the gist of it.  Catch up on your reading for further details.

        Midday Bugaboo   So here it is.  Friday.  Why the hell isn't it over yet?  I want to go home and play Madden and take the trash out and make a feeble attempt at cleaning the house before my parents arrival, anything but fucking work.  This week has gone on too long.  It must be stopped.  I'll gather up the troops, you sound the alarm and move your men around the east side, we'll flank the week and it'll never know what hit it.  Yeah.  That's some John Clark type shit.  Actually if John Clark  were  here he'd kill the week with some shoe string and a can of lysol.  He's like the MacGuyver of killing.  I suppose what's relevant here is that the week is nigh over and I get to see my folks, play some Madden, and some DnD.  My weekend is chock-fucking-full of laughs.  So bite my shiny metal ass.

        Insert Weird Remark Here   So, Thursday huh?  Yeah, well, I say you can keep it.  Thankfully tomorrow is Friday and that will put an abrupt end to this horrible week.  I haven't really been paying attention, but it seems to me that when I have a bad week, all my friends have good ones.  So on the one hand, I'm pissed because my week sucked, yet on the other hand, I feel happy because I'm allowing my friends to have a good week.  What am I saying?  Fuck them.  I want to have a good week, screw everyone else.  Eh, wwhatevver.  I can't even be bothered to spell that word right.  On a happier note, Cartoon Network is starting to rerun  urlLink FLCL  which, if you haven't watched it, is the greatest show that's only six (6) episodes long ever!  The  urlLink soundtrack  is amazing, plus the animation rules.  If you can keep up with the story (which you can't) it's fantastic.  Have I ever led you astray in the past?  No.  I haven't.  OK, there was that one time with the deer ticks, but I was young and impressionable.  Jeez, why can't you people just let the past be?  Buncha freaking nitpickers.  Pickers of the nit.  Seriously, though, if you can stay up  urlLink late enough  to watch it, I highly recommend it.  You Cannot Resist.  In other news: Boston Market brand frozen meals are quite delicious.

        Kills Owls Dead.   Greetings humans.  Today was slightly less bluey than yesterday.  To give you a legitimate scale to base said blueness on we'll say that if yesterday's CMYK values were C=100 M=75 Y=15 K=17, then today's were C=90 M=59 Y=3 K=0.  So, as you can see, there was a definite reduction in that particular hue.  But whatever.    On a lighter note Football season is mere weeks from beginning and I am fucking stoked.  The months without football are tedious and boring.  Save hockey playoffs and a few regular season 'can't miss' (read: Red Wings vs. anyone) matches there's really nothing to fill the void in my heart left by 7 football-free months.  'Round these parts we don't count preseason football as football  per se .  This last off-season I, at least, had the joy of The Bucs winning the Superbowl (can't tell you how long I've been waiting for that) to keep me going for 3 or 4 months.  So that was nice.  But after that, nothing.  Nothing, nothing and more nothing.  Blah blah blah.  So booooring.  My mind can now focus on the fine art of memorizing stats and making ideological predictions about the post-season.  (Speaking of the post season, the Bo-Sox  ARE  going to get a wild card this year.  Fuck You Babe Ruth!)  Essentially what I'm saying is prepare yourselves for 20ish weeks of "Holy Shit! Did you see that catch that Marvin Harrison made in the 4th quarter, he was all like *whoosh-boom-woo-woo* for like a thirty seven yard gain!" or "Damn, that LaDanian Tomlinson is a monster back, I swear to Christ he could run through a wall if it weren't too thick or made out of titanium."  That's what it's going to be like, and when I get to talk to my fellow stat-junkies, it'll be worse.  For example, "Sure, Jeremy Shockey's a decent tight end, but he's no Tony Gonzales.  For all of his antics and bullshit, he only scored two (2) touchdowns last season, and now he's king shit motherfucker in New York.  For Christ's sake, Todd Heap scored more touchdowns than that.  Todd Heap!  Shit even Derrick Brooks scored more touchdowns than that, and he doesn't even play offense."  See what I mean.  I'm already getting myself riled up over a mediocre shithead tight end.  Fuck Jeremy Shockey.  And fuck U of Miami (Fla.) for making him.  At least he went to a team I despise.  Nevermind.  In an ironic, yet painful, coincidence The University of Miami (Fla.) also produced my favorite player, and the best defensive tackle ever,  urlLink Warren Sapp.    WAR-REN, WAR-REN, WAR-REN.  A familiar chant form last year's Superbowl.  I was drunk.  How dare you judge me!  Today's harrowing remark about you and/or your families is: You are so loathsome, that not even people who favor loathsome company will hang with you.  I'm trying, really.

        Welcome To The World Of Tomorrow!   So yesterday was the last first-run episode of Futurama, a moment of silence please....   Ok thanks.  It's unfortuante that FOX completely mishandled that franchise, it had the potential to leave the Simpson's in its wake.  Instead it got moved around, preempted, and evetually cancelled.  It  was  the funniest animated show, hands down, and, some would argue, the funniest show period.  I'll let you be your own judge of that.  But the good news is that the recherché people at  urlLink [Adult Swim]  had the presence of mind to pick up the syndication rights.  So they can keep us hip deep in unequivocal animated goodness.  (I guess we should thank those copycatting fucks over at TBS, too)  But for a more permanent solution go purchase the  urlLink DVD .  (season 2 comes out this week)  Also, write an angry missive to your congressman and get him to provide federal funding to foster this show.  Do it now, I can wait.  Conversely, the one hour block [Adult Swim] uses to show  urlLink Futurama  and  urlLink Family Guy  is doing exceptionally well.  So well, in fact, that their has been discussions of Cartoon-Network-Funded new episodes of both shows.  Now, whether or not that will come to fruition remains to be seen, but send your emails to Cartoon Network and Adult Swim and tell them what an outstanding idea it is.  To those of you who did not get me a present or a tasty treat for my birthday, I am providing you with this one (1) opportunity to get out of my proverbial dog house:  go  urlLink HERE  and pick something, doesn't matter what, buy it and give it to me.

        Fiesta!   Dammit!  I was just playing some Madden 2003 to get prepared for 2004 which comes out next week.  I got my ass handed to me on a platter with some little radish flowers as garnish.  I haven't been privvy to a beating that bad since bootcamp, when we held Private Leonard Lawrence down with his bed sheets and castigated him with bars of soap wrapped in towels.  Wait... Wasn't that... Nope, nevermind.  I swear to God it was like my Corners had lead shoes on.  Mark Brunell threw for over three hundred yards and the man is like 95 years old.  Fuck it, I just need to get back into practice.  I remember a time when Man and Animal, alike, cowered before my hot football action.  Maybe to make myself feel better I'll beat a man to death with my knee, courtesy of UFC Throwdown.  I did that once, in Brooklyn.  I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong.  I did it because he cut me off in traffic.  Watching people die is so passé.  Besides, what better way to teach someone a lesson on the hazards of bad driving than by killing them.  We here at  urlLink Nick HQ  don't promote or condone, in any way, the killing or maiming of inferior drivers.  But we have been known to, occasionally, look the other way while it happens.  So what have we learned today?  Nick hates losing and bad drivers.  So if you veer into my lane without using your indicator light, or if manage to best me in a rousing match of squash (which I highly doubt) then your lives are forfeit.

(or is it Hamatulas)  But I keep up with what goes on in the gaming industry and my  urlLink favorite   urlLink gaming   urlLink authors , that is what bookmarks me as a dork.  I'm not ashamed, but damn, you think one of my  urlLink "friends"  would've given me a heads up, so I can, you know, talk with a british accent or something to countervail it.

       A-motherfucking-Hoy.  Now that the vacation is finally over I can get back to the grind. Back to the job.  Back to the blog.  But mostly, back to the getting up at 830a.  I like my job, I'm good at it, the people there rely on me and I get free candy sometimes.  But, dammit if I don't need a week off every now and then.  You see, by nature I'm a ne'er-do-well with a heart of  urlLink Solid Gold .

Nevertheless, I remain resolute in bringing you unyielding posts about  urlLink tenacious  happenings.    In a side note: Have I mentioned in the past how much I execrate alliteration?  Well, I do.  Also I apologize vehemently if I ever use it by accident, like, for example, "Tendering Topics To Tantalize Thumb-Throughers".  In all fairness, when it comes to recapitulating stressed syllables I suck at it, like GW sucks at  urlLink peaceful reslolution .  I'm serious.  Who, in the history of man, has ever used 'thumb-throughers' as a synonym for 'readers'?  No. One. Ever.  I suppose I'll just have to bank on my acuminate wit and vast-like-the-fucking-ocean vocabulary.    I know that's why you love me.

        We Am Smrat!   So, in the daytime, before the Bison incident, we were at a place called Mammoth Hot Springs. (MHS)  It is named as such because, either, there are Mammoths there, or there are large Hot Springs.  I don't remember which.  Whatever the reason, the place is a  urlLink biscuit  from Montana.  It had already been snowing for a day and a half, so we said "Hey, why not go farther north?"  This, for me, was the coolest part of the trip.  I seriously enjoyed MHS, for real.  No sarcasm.  I liked it.  Got it?  I will post some wicked pictures of it towards the bottom of this post, so keep a goddamn eye out for those.  I said goddamn because I hadn't cursed up until then.  I needed to.  I wonder if I can put a swear in each fucking sentence I write?  That would be the shit.  I know my damn Mom wouldn't like it.  Relax, I'm just kidding you sunsabitches.  In MHS springs, there are these terraced thermal events.  It's really strange.  The water flows out of the earth and  flattens the rock it's on then it flows down to the next rock and flattens that one, and so on, until there are several tiers of rock.   urlLink Kind of like if Salvador Dali built stairs for a living.   These terraces go all the way down the side of a mountain.  For some reason I got a bug up my ass to climb this fucking mountain.  Now all of you that read this probably know what I look like, but for those of you who don't my body isn't exactly mountain climbing material.  My body is more streamlined for sitting in recliners and eating Cheetos.  I wasn't sure if a fat dude trying to climb a mountain a mile and a half above sea level was even possible, but, DAMMIT, I had to try!  At first I beat up an old lady and stole her Rascal but that sumbitch gave out at 6500 ft.  Piece of shit. (by the by, if you have never seen an old lady plummeting down a mountain unstoppably, I highly recommend it)  So I had to hoof it the rest of the way.  My heart tried to escape my chest using an intricate system of levers and pulleys, but I managed not to let it escape.  So, yay me.  If there was one upside to getting up there it was that I, in all my perfect eyesight glory, could see for-fucking-ever.  It was amazing.  I also have pictures of that.  The climb counteracted the fact that it was 28 degrees or some shit.  Before we went to MHS, we went to Old Faithful (OF).  You can't go to Yellowstone and not see OF.  That's like going on the internet without seeing some titties, just doesn't happen.  It's not that OF is a heavenly sight to behold (like titties) or that it is overly impressive, It's just that OF is pretty much the reason that there is a National Park there in the first place.  You kind of have to go pay your respects, like a Mafia boss.  Old Faithful is, indeed, faithful as the name seems to suggest.  But only if you have a sister who knows how to tell time.  See, we went into the Lodge/Mall that was right in front of OF to warm up (it was snowing) and they had this huge fucking schedule right on the wall that said when the next ejaculation of steam and water was.  Well Ginny comes running up and says "It's going to go in about ten minutes."  So we head on down to locate a strategic position that will be ideal for pictures and not getting soaked in sulfur water.  Thing is, we were the only ones down there.  And this  IS  the biggest attraction at YS.  Curious.  So we wait.  Turns out It was actually AN HOUR and ten minutes from going off.  Thankfully a kind soul mentioned that fact to us, so we didn't have to be cold for too terribly long.  I thought one of the pre-req's to being an adult was being able to read a clock.  She's going to kick my ass for this.  Anyway the obligatory picture of OF is also included.  I'm going to take down the older pics so the load time is decreased.

The area we were staying in was normally 'bear heavy' but there had been a forest fire recently and they had all gone into the highlands, where they fought to the death with swords.  Hoping to claim "The Prize".  But alas, no bears.  I did see a shit ton of Bison.  Whoopity Doo!  I think it was the last day we were there when, after a long day of exploring, we were crossing the bridge back to our RV park and a whole fucking herd of these disgusting beasts came thundering across the bridge in the opposite direction.  It was like the fucking weird Levi's commercial.  There are signs up all over that warn against approaching the Bison, or they might gore you to death, I kept wondering what 25 Bison goring a RV would look like.  Not pretty for sure.  Especially a RV chock full of Seaman. (Eww...)  Besides Bison we saw all kinds of Elk, but nary a Moose.  A Moose was the other animal I wanted to see up close.  So 0 for 2 on the ol' wildlife.  However, if you are ever hard up for a geyser, hot spring or acidic pool of filth then YS is the place for you.  You can't go 2 miles without seeing some sort of thermal event.  We were up to our necks with fucking thermal events. Not literally, although a guy once went skinny dipping in one of the natural springs.  Turns out it was around 140 degrees farenheit, and the fucking guy nearly boiled himself to death.  Say no to drugs, kids.  Drugs are bad, mmmkay.  There was this huge fucking lake there called Yellowstone Lake (clever...), it is the mouth of a huge volcano.   A volcano that is supposed to errupt every 100,000 years, or something.  Well, apparently, it is 40,000 years overdue and seismologists or volanologists or whatever say that is is "rumbling".  I'm not sure what, exactly, that means, I am sure, however, that when you are 15 feet from the mouth of a volcano whose mouth is like 4 miles across, you think about things.  Things like; "If this explodes, the entire northwestern seaboard is fucked" or "Why in the fuck am I standing next to the mouth of an overdue volcano?"  It was pretty, though.  One of the main reasons I live in Kansas is because we don't have any volcanos.  I don't need any huge explosions, thank you very much.

        I Got Yer Big Horn Right Here!   Look below to see what I learned how to do.  Now that I can post pictures you are fucking doomed.  You will be forced to see what I want you to see.  You already read the things I want you to read, I wonder if there is a way I can make you smell things.  God that would be so awesome!  I am now on a quest to create an ISP that uses patented Smell-O-Net© technology.  Bwahahaha!  Bow before your de facto master!  Anyway.  The Bighorn Mountains (BHM) were cool as hell.  Well, I guess they were just mountains, the cool part was the road that had been laid through them.  I don't know the person who drew up the plans but I guaran-damn-tee you he was hopped up on some crazy jungle mushroom.  The road curved a lot.  It curved back on itself, sometimes.  As you travel this particular mountain pass, it is entirely likely that you will take a curve and realize that not only are you lower than where you started, but you are farther back on the path as well.  If there were exits or two-way switchbacks no one would ever find their way out and we would have perambulant tribes of cannibalistic tourists roaming the BHM looking for other foolish wayfarers to either eat or sacrifice to Min, the Egyptian God of nomads.  And nobody wants that.  Still it was a lot of fun to ride through.  I think I might've been the only one to think that, though.  Dad was driving and you really miss some of the nuances of mountain travel if you're concentrating on trying to keep the 28 foot long vehicle containing your family on the road.  Mom has a fear of roads that are on cliffs and bridges, so, needless, to say she wasn't exactly gawking out at the 1,500 foot fall.  And Ginny, well Ginny was the worst (funniest) of us.  She gets car sick on Kansas highways.  So imagine that instead of flat and straight, the road continually drops or raises 200 feet in the air and is straight in the same sense that a slinky is straight.  Now imagine driving said road in an RV with bad shocks at 40mph.  "Awesome" springs to mind.  I have to commend the old girl for prohibiting the contents of her stomach from spewing forth and coating the bed in a mucusy film, but I'm sure it was an arduous task.  Meanwhile I was wishing I was in a Porsche Boxster going about 60.  The ironic part is I hate roller coasters.  I think the difference lies somewhere in between having a moderate amount of control and having no fucking control, whatsoever.    I talk about the BHM as if it were someplace we stopped and looked around, but the truth is we just drove through them and, as far as I can tell, that's pretty much all they're good for.  All the spots of interest are clearly marked with large signs that you can see from your car while driving.  I submit that this is so people don't stop on the side of a fucking mountain.  And, really, the only thing the signs said was "Attention:  this bit of rock here is 450 Million years old" or whatever.  We did see a wall of rock that was 5 billion years old, and all I could think was that it looked exactly fucking like the rocks in the ditch outside my house.  Geologists must be, categorically, bromidic people.  As much as I appreciate a natural stone structure that is cool, like Devil's Tower, I am loath to admire something that doesn't have anything going for it except that it's really, really old.  It's the same as people cherishing Bob Barker but hating to visit their own lame-ass Grandparents.  We drove from Yellowstone to Devil's Tower and the BHM were in between them.  So next time I'll actually be talking about Yellowstone, instead of just referencing it.  You're all giddy aren't you?  I can sense that kind of thing.  In the meantime, I'll let you get back to your mouth-breathing.  I will let this cheese representation of pac-man tide you over until tomorrow.

        Prepare Thine Eyes!   Lest they be disunited from thine wigs!  For sheezy.  So I decided to relate to you the details of my trip in reverse order.  I already told you about Wall Drug, which was the last thing we did.  Holding to the restrictions set by my new decree, the next to last thing we did was go to Devil's Tower.  Devil's Tower (DT) was, for all intents and purposes, the shit.  The bees knees, if you will.  Now, I know it's just a big fucking piece of igneous rock that was spurted out of the ground by some pussy ass volcano that didn't have the wherewithal to destroy a civilization like a real volcano, but I still like it.  I have some boss pictures of it.  If you want to see some of them just hit me up with an email. (Use the link on the left, towards the bottom that says "reach out and touch me", idiots.)  If you have ever seen the movie "Close Encounter of the 3rd Kind" then you have seen DT.  It's that rock with aliens on it at the end.  Although, now that I have been up close and personal with DT, I want to find Richard Dreyfuss and lambaste his arthritis ridden skeleton for leading me to believe it was climbable with nothing more than determination and a smattering of upper-body strength.  See, there were actual climbers there when we where there and, by God, they had actual climbing "equipment".  Like harnesses, metal circles with claspy-things and spiky, pole-like instruments.  Fuck You, Richard Dreyfuss, for lying to a child!  I see you, now, for what you really are:  A bedraggled, doddering, lying ass-fucker!  Go fuck some asses, you ass fucker!  *ahem*  So, yeah, Devil's Tower was pretty cool.  What with the rocks and hot Asians.  What's that?  I forgot to mention the hot Asians?  I am so, so terribly sorry.  I can't believe I forgot the hot Asians.  So anyway there was this group of Asians, they might've been a tour group but I think, probably, that they were just a really big family, anyway they were there and amongst them was this smaller group of really hot Asian girls.  Men who know me, know me as a votary of Asian tail.  So, needless to say, I was quite pleased with myself for locating them amidst the vast expanse of migrating gadabouts.  Unfortunately this story doesn't have an ending involving a jar of apple butter, a kiddy pool full of heavy whipping cream or twins.  But, believe me, if it had, I would've been handing out urinary tract infections like free bibles after school.   (was that Jim?)     Oh well.  A man can still dream and masturbate unremittingly, can't he?  Kind of  hard  to follow that up, but I'm always  in the mood  for a  rousing  rencontre.  The thing that one (meaning, "you") needs to realize about DT is how engorgingly prodigious it is.  A more monosyllabic way to say it would be: the fucker is big.  See, it is has a crystalline structure and the outer most sections are exposed to the most erosion, so they tend to fall off, relatively, frequently.  The last piece that fell off was fairly small.  It weighed something like 100,000 tons (3.584 x 10 to the 9th ounces).  Yeah.  But not to fret, earlier when I said "frequently" I meant it in a 'relative-to-DT' time frame.  That piece that fell off, did so about 10,000 years ago.  And pieces (are believed to) fall off in that, every 10-30,000 year, window.  So it's not like a piece is going to fall on you.  Unless it does.  In which case you are so totally fucked, that it is impossible for physicists to determine a preponderant grade of fuckedness.  You'll grease that sumbitch up and make it go faster.  God, how I long to see that on FOX©.  Please keep any comments about my conversion from tons to ounces to your-fucking-selves.  I don't give a shit if it's wrong.  I was trying to be funny, and the only people that would know or care if it is right are nerds who deserve to be beaten with chicken skeletons until their skin is perforated and pockmarked.

        Oh God! It Burns!   Ahoy you scurvy bastards.  It's been a week and my disdain for all of you has intensified no less than three fold.   I find it amazing that I don't talk to you for a week, yet, I dislike all of you even more.  That's gotta sting!  I hope the  urlLink world of fashion  hasn't changed too much during my stint in Wyoming.  I have decided that South Dakota is the worst state ever.  For a long time I purported that it was Nebraska.  And one could even make a reasonable argument for Texas.  But, lo, it is SD.  Never since before the Big Bang has there been more of nothing in one place.  They don't even have cows there.  What state doesn't have cows?!  We hatesss it!  I know what you're thinking - "But, Nick Isn't Sturgis there?"  and after I get done slapping you until my hand bleeds I will reply "Yes.  But you know what?  I fucking drove through Sturgis and it was as if God, himself, was punishing me for my numerous sins."  And you will riposte with a hacking cough, indicating that there is blood in your lungs.  And I will say "I hit you because I love you."  And you will fall unconscious.  The  only  cool part of that state is a city called Wall.  There is a drug store there by the name of  urlLink Wall Drug.   If you are already in the know about Wall Drug, keep your filthy mouth shut so I can inform the rest of these miscreants.  Wall Drug, hereafter referred to as WD, is an amazing place in the sense that one cannot truly appreciate it unless they are suffering from Mercury Poisoning or the third stage of Syphilis.  It is no less than a city block long and it has more crap in it than a 400 lb Samoan eating Red Beans and Rice.  They have a store that sells rocks, which is nice if your into paying money for pretty pieces of gravel.  They have an art store which actually had some cool stuff in it.  They had a candy store, and if you don't like candy stores then you can just get the fuck out!  They also had a Tyrannosaurus Rex head that screamed at passersby, it was amazing.  They had over 1500 historical photographs, 5 of which were of a man being hanged.  Good Stuff.  Another cool thing that all the guys and lezzies will appreciate was 75% of the employees were from Eastern Europe.  I guess they were spending a semester abroad or getting their work visa or some shit. (why in the fuck they would go to a bumfuck little town like Wall, SD is beyond me)  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  The point is that of this 75%, I speculate that 70% were extremely attractive women.  From Eastern Europe!  They don't speak good English and they are all homesick and vulnerable!  It was like Disney World for my penis!  The whole experience was surreal.  We should all get some psychotropic drugs and go there and see the T. Rex.  I swear to God that you will shit yourself.  I could go on and on but I have to take a piss and I hate you.  Stay Tuned, though, as tomorrow will have my Yellowstone run down.  And later in the week I will be discussing Devil's Tower and why I fucking hate Bison.  You're are so in for it, now!

        "Look At Me!  I'm Joe.  I Can Spell And Do, uh, Other Things Too."   My "talented" friend Joe C. (I  wish  it was the dead midget) informed me that Tuscan Raider is actually spelled Tusken Raider.  After which, I informed him that I don't give a shit and that he should die in a most horrible manner for pointing out my shortcomings.  I'm not going to be lugubrious about misspelling the name of a fictional beast.  Especially since the way I spelled it worked so well with my "raiders from tuscany" joke.   I will, however, hunt down Joe and violently void the feces from my bowels into his trombome.  And then I will laugh.  Don't Forget!  Today's is the last post for at least nine (9) days.  Sorry to leave you hanging.  Wait... No I'm not.  Fuck You!  Have A good week, losers!

        The Funny Side Of  urlLink Rape!    That shit is so wrong.  How can you people just sit idly by while I give Human Beings a bad name?  One of you should beat the shit out of me.  By "one of you" I mean an attractive young lady, and by "beat the shit out of me" I mean sex me up.  The following is a forewarning:  All of next week I wil be out of town and not near a computer.  The Family is going to Yellowstone, and unless there is a Kinko's or an internet bar in the wilds of Wyoming then I will not be posting.  Sorry if that upsets you, but we all knew that you'd have to overcome your seperation anxiety eventually.  Now is the perfect opportunity.  There is nothing special to report today, so I will let you reflect on my wise teachings.  I said reflect Godammit!

        Gayer Than An Ass With Two Dicks In It.   That's what I think about Sand People, also known as Tuscan Raiders.  And I absolutely don't mean that they are people made from sand or that they are raiders from Tuscany.  Although I'm sure Tuscany's Raiders are very pleasant fellows with lovely accents.  The reasons for my thoroughgoing disdain for these creatures are three fold.  1) When they speak, it's like a dying pig on a riding lawn mower trying to fuck my ear.  2) They are Luddites.  3) They look like rejected extras from a Tim Burton movie about stupid people.  If these reasons are unclear then stop reading because you are not a human being, you are some sort of Evil Robot Tyrant who was browsing the internet looking for a weakness in America's infrastructure and accidentally stumbled upon my site.  Fucking evil robots, always chumming up our nicely unchummed waters.  Anyway, as I was saying I hate Sand People.  Just so you know.  Okey-Dokey.  Also I have decided to not do the IOTD anymore.  It's not becasue my antipathy for you people has lessened, it is, however, because I am lazy.  There you have it.

        Grossly Irresponsible.   You know, I think I might be underpaid.  I know I'm not underappreciated, in fact, I'm wholly appreciated.  I just don't see that appreciatation in greenbacks.  Know what I mean?  I need a raise.  Getting one, though, is a whole different and painfully difficult task.  I like my job.  I'm good at it, it's relatively easy (seeing as I've done it for so long) and, as I've stated before, I sometimes get free candy.  Which no one can turn down.  Unless it's from a guy in a windowless van and you happen to be under the age of 15.  In that case kick him square in the nuts as hard as you can and set him on fire if the opportunity presents itself, then run and tell a police officer. (leave out the part about murdering him with fire)  I never could say no to a good conflagration.  What were we talking about?  Yogurt, you say?  Indeed.  I like the creamy whipped kind.  When I eat it, it's like an Angel crapped a sunbeam in my mouth.  Mmmm...scat reference.  Jesus Christ, Nick!  Get over it you namby-pamby so-and-sos.  I have to go.  See, I've got this, uh, thing I'm supposed to do and the thing about it is... OH MY GOD, A ZEPPLIN.  LOOK!  WOTD:  metier, also métier \met-YAY; MET-yay\, noun:  1. An occupation; a profession.  2. An area in which one excels; an occupation for which one is especially well suited.

        GOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLL!!!   Did you see the US Women's Soccer team absolutley kick the shit out of Mexcio yesterday?  Oh man, It was awesome.  Mia Hamm was like a freaking  urlLink ninja .  I'm just kidding.  Like I'd watch some lame ass sport like soccer.  It was all about the (american) Football yesterday!!  The Chiefs owned San Diego's ass.  Miami lost like a bunch of bitches to the God Damned Texans.  And Tampa is preparing for another vicious beating of the now defense-less Eagles.  O! Lord I sing thy praises for another glorious football season.  My fantasy football team didn't do quite as well as expected, mostly becasue Eddie George decided against doing his fucking job yesterday, but I still did pretty well.  Oh, and if Kelly Holcomb throws another god damn interception he's getting cut faster than a skinhead at a St. Lunatics concert in the TWA dome.  Figure it out you meatheads.  Anyway, I must away to BK's to get my X-Box so I can play me some ESPN Football.  Buc's 4 Life, Nigga!

        Pitiful!   That's what I am.  I only blogged twice last week.  And I  like  doing this!  In my defense it was kind of a rough week.  But when you think about it, these post only take, like, 5 to 7 minutes to write, so mostly it's just me being lazy.  I am doing this now despite being hungover to death.  I feel like I could die any moment and I would welcome it with open arms.  Please Lord, take the pain away!  I went to the Haus von Jazz last night and got way liquored up.  Fortunatley for me, my sister showed up and and kept me from sleeping in the alley.  It was a pleasant evening, I would have been fine.  Then when we went back to get my car today there was some God Damned parade going on downtown.  How does a parade happening on the street I work on get under my radar.  I don't care, really.  In fact I hate parades, I think they are stupid and gay, but the mere fact that an organized gathering of this magnitude slipped by me can mean only one thing: My senses have begun to deteriorate.  Ever since I turned 25 my senses have begun to slip and my memory isn't what it used to be.  Oh, Lady Time you truly are a cruel mistress.  I damn thee.    That's all.  Go away now.

        King Shit of Fuck Mountain   So, I would've posted yesterday but Lord Malak had to be destroyed so that I could reclaim my post as True Lord of the Sith.  The republic has been crushed under my steel toed jack-boots.  I killed most of the Jedi left in the galaxy, except for one, who I turned to the Dark Side so she could be my apprentice.  Now it's off to Courasant to lay waste to the main Jedi Council.  Isn't life grand.  Seriously though, if there are any Jedi out there reading this, you had better run and hide because I'm coming for you.  You know who you are, Mike.  I wanted to talk to you about something serious for a minute, if that's alright.  I've been hearing a lot about this nonsense surrounding Madonna and Spears, lately, and I have to say I'm a bit discouraged.  I mean Madonna kissed Britany Spears on TV and I fucking missed it, not only that but not a single one of my friends sent me pictures or links.  I had to find them all by myself.  And you call yourself friends?  This is a problem for me because, had our positions been reversed, you can damn well bet on the fact that I would have been right there with pictures for you.  So you forget about me in my time of need, well... okay I could forgive that if it didn't involve hot celebrity females making out on TV.  I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.  You know what, Fuck You, I  am  mad.  I'm mad as hell.  You all get demerits.  That is all.  By the by, is today WOTD or IOTD?  Fuck it.  As punishment you don't get either.  That's a good start.

        I've Been Kidnapped   Yeah.  That's it.  Kidnapped.  That explains why I missed Fridays post.  Obviously I've escaped since then.  Gave 'em the ol' "Run 'n Hide".  Just like I gave your girlfriend the ol' "Snap 'n Grab".  Figure it out.  Anyway, the real reason I've been away is that a Sith's work is never done.  I've been spreading propaganda for the Sith, now that I'm a wholly dark Jedi Master.  How anyone can live without Force Lightning is beyond me.  "Give me those freshly baked tarts, old man!"  "No, they are for my family."  BRRXZZKTT *sizzle*  "Mmmm... Tarts."  Also it's great for flash cooking a wild boar.  Just whip up a nice mustard rosemary dipping sauce and you got yourself a meal.  Think about it.  Onto more pressing matters.  This coming weekend is opening day for football fans.  Personally, I feel that if you mixed the Chinese New Year with St. Patricks Day and a dash of Boxing Day then you have a suitable stepping stone for Opening Day.  It is a glorious time that can only be properly celebrated with beer and roasted sausages wrapped delicately in bread.  So if you're in the mood and you live near me, please come by for a pork product and a barley chaser this coming sunday.  My treat.  You know what they say... "Nothing Beats Free Pork".  Well, mostly it's me that says that.  Shut up.  Pork, Pork The musical fruit.  The more you eat...  wait.  That's not it...  huh.  Oh well.  This Post Brou....

Anyway I've got a clever costume for this evening.  I'm going as a fat guy (cha-ching!)  That way I'm sure to score with countless rich supermodels.  Wait I'm confusing 'fat guy' with 'rich guy' again.  I always do that.  Damn my human brain!  Anyway, please except this heartfelt apology for not blogging recently.  I have been, uh, busy.  yeah.  Listen, uh, if the feds call you, tell them I was with you from 8:15pm Tuesday until 9:49am this morning.  As soon as Paco gets back from Tiajuana and T-Dog's plane comes in from Switzerland, we'll make it worth your while.  Trust me.  Oh shit!  Someone's at the door, I have to go.

        *Yawn*   I am tired.  We got in late last night from the Chiefs game because I got us fucking lost in KC, MO.  I hate that city so much.  It's a blight on the world.  There are 5 things that have to stay in KC, everything else should get the fuck out. 1. Kansas City Chiefs (8-0, bitches!) 2. Kansas City Royals (Sweeney's locked in for 4 years!) 3. Oak Park Mall (Too many fine women to kick out!) 4. KU Med School (If it's not there neither is Mike) 5. Jack Stack Bar-B-Que (mmmm...)  We went tailgating yesterday at like 3, I have never seen so many drunk people playing with fire in one place before in my life.  I am amazed that no one died, although I can't be positive of that.  Chiefs won 38-5.  Woot!  Am tired.  see you later.

        No, That's Ok.  I Don't Need That Part Of My Finger.   So I cut off part of my finger today.  Middle finger, left hand.  That was my favorite one.   God. Damn. It.   Other than that work was absolute hell today.  Fun all around.  Yeah.  Luckily for you, though, I am done jumping through hoops trying to get promoted so it's back to my normal schedule.  I am so looking forward to this weekend.  Tomorrow we are playing our Evil Campaign in DnD and that is  always  fun.  Also tomorrow is the KU/K-State game, and although K-State will most likely win we should at least make a go of it this year.  See the last time we won was '92, when we limited KState to like 65 total yards of offense, inclusing -56 yards rushing.  Let me repeat that, minus fifty-six yards rushing.  MINUS!!  what the fuck was K-state doing to accumulate that many negative rushing yards?  Their running back must have been a mentally retarded 7 yeard old girl.  I can't brag too much though, seeing as that was the last time we won, and it was 11 years ago.  Since then we have been getting whooped.  Badly.  This year, though, K-State is not really that good and we  are  pretty good, so we should at least make a game of it.  I don't care if we lose, as long as we don't lose by 40.  Well... I don't want to lose by any more than 14.  That will be satisfactory.  Moving on...  This sunday I am going to the Chiefs game, I am also going to paint myself up red and yellow after I shave my head.  So look for a fat bald guy who is painted red and yellow on ESPN.  Can anyone say needle in haystack?  By needle I mean me and by haystack I mean bowl full of rednecks.  Go Chiefs!  Later on all.  Nick out.

        Look, Goddamnit, For The Last Time We Don't Have Any Pudding.   This post may be a little weird, I have basically been hardwired to my The Who playlist on iTunes for like two weeks straight.  That much Daltrey can ruin a man.  Anyway, here goes.  I caught some shit about bitching out on my Monday post.  I openly admit that I posted that conversation to avoid having to actually come up with something new, but it's not because I don't love doing this for (to) you, it's because I'm a lazy bastard.  So fucking get over it.  Plus that conversation was pretty funny.  As long as you're not some über pussy liberal tight-lipped prick hippie shithead.  I can't stand UPLTLPHS's.  Anyway, I do have a harrowing tale for you today.  Some may call it borrowing, plagiarism or even stealing.  I like to think of it as tasteful appropriation.  By any name it boils down to one thing: Storytime, Nick style.       Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack.  He wasn't very old, but he was a man.  Though not physically aged he was very mature.  He didn't act like a child and the other kids frowned upon this.  They had taken to calling him Jerkwad or Fignuts.  Naturally, Jack just turned the other cheek, not about to kowtow to these foolish antics.  This aloof indifference angered the other children.  More than anything they wanted a reaction from Jack, they wanted to see him fight back.  But Jack was no fighter, he was too happy to ever fight.  So one day after school Jack was walking home and a group of the other boys cornered him in the alley between Benson's Frozen Confections and Handy Dan's Hardware.  Jack knew there was no escape so he simply removed his backpack, set it aside and prepared to take his licks.  The boys pinned him down and punched him mercilessly, they hit him with sticks, they dropped things on his back and told him lies about his Mom.  Through it all Jack continued to smile.  The boys tried and tried, but they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy.  They finally got so pissed off that he was smiling while taking a beating that one of the bigger boys hit Jack in the head with a brick and killed him.  Once the other boys realized what had happened they all ran off and hid.  It wasn't too long before a passerby found Jack's lifeless corpse and called the police.  Well, the police showed up and, using forensic science, figured out what happened.  They picked up one of the boys that had been there and told him that if he didn't rat on the others they were going to go to his house get his puppy and slowly torture it to death, until he did tell them.  The boy, sensing a bluff, told them to go fuck their mothers with engorged Wapiti cocks.  Needless to say, the kindly Police Officers took exception to this comment and went to get his dog.  After about 20 minutes of watching his pup get skinned and filleted the boy was ready to turn over anyone the Police wanted, even the god-damned Easter Bunny.  The Police rounded up all the boys who had been present, tried them all as adults and sent them to a maximum security prison where they spent the rest of their days.  Meanwhile in Heaven, Jack laughed and laughed and laughed.  They couldn't prevent Jack from being happy.  "...a compelling read."  -PC Networking Magazine*  "...a steaming pile of... ...apallingly... ...good... ..."writing."  -Complacent Housewives Weekly*  "We will not... ...sue you blind, you son of a... ...mother[lover]."  -The Who*     *not actual quotes    **UPDATE** I didn't do word of the day last week and I didn't do it yesterday, so by God I'm breaking tradtition and doing it today:  panacea \pan-uh-SEE-uh\, noun:  A remedy for all diseases, problems, or evils; a universal medicine; a cure-all.   P.S. - have any of you noticed how that stupid google ad at tht top of the page changes to advertise something that I mentioned in my Blog?  It was DnD stuff for a long time, and I just thought it was a cool coiencidnece, but now that they're shilling climbing gear and Devil's Tower related things I am convinced that it is some sort of conspiracy.  Fucking bastards!

        Hey!  It's That Guy.  You Know, The One Who Writes This Thing.  Yeah, Him.   Listen, you clydes, I want to take a second and give big ups to the funniest ghost ever.  Harry Goz, we love you!  Sealab will never be the same without you.  R.I.P. Hazel "Hank" Murphy.  Show some respect you god-damned miscreants.  Also I don't have anything planned but read this transcript of a conversation I had earlier with a buddy of mine.  I have posted it here without his permission, so don't go blabbin' to the feds.  Just for clarification I am Limey Git and he is Worst Pirate.... (some of you know who this is, which will clear some of the references up)  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (6:57:53 PM)    "Royt! Silly little bleeder! One rabbit stew comin' right up!"  Limey Git says: (6:58:09 PM)    give us a fag, love.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:02:36 PM)    I love calling cigarettes fags. I like calling fags fags too.  Limey Git says: (7:02:54 PM)    i call pretty much everyone and everything a fag.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:03:13 PM)    Get away from that fag, you big faggy, fag.  Limey Git says: (7:03:20 PM)    "hey fag, give me that fag before i fag you in the fag of your fagging fag."  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:03:52 PM)    Even Papa Smurf would be confused by that. The big fag.  Limey Git says: (7:04:44 PM)    seriously. i bet he smurfed grouchy smurf (or whatever) right in his tender smurf.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:05:04 PM)    Smurfette---what a sexist name.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:05:14 PM)    Is she not herself a Smurf?  Limey Git says: (7:05:16 PM)    no fagging shit.  Limey Git says: (7:05:42 PM)    they might as well have called her dame smurf or smurf broad.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:05:55 PM)    Smurf Slut. Smurf Strumpet.  Limey Git says: (7:06:12 PM)    skanky smurf  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:06:21 PM)    That's what I would've named her!  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:06:23 PM)    We have a winner  Limey Git says: (7:06:35 PM)    i fagging love alliteration.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:06:59 PM)    I like the word itself  Limey Git says: (7:07:10 PM)    fag? or alliteration?  Limey Git says: (7:07:17 PM)    both?  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:07:43 PM)    Both really, but I like alliteration.  Limey Git says: (7:09:06 PM)    in truth, i despise it. but the word itself, like onomatopoeia, is cool.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:09:43 PM)    I forget the meaning of that one now...  Limey Git says: (7:10:21 PM)    BooM!  Limey Git says: (7:10:33 PM)    word that sounds like what it is conveying.  Limey Git says: (7:10:54 PM)    The formation or use of words such as buzz or murmur that imitate the sounds associated with the objects or actions they refer to.   The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:11:20 PM)    Fagging A!  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:11:33 PM)    That's interesting---I knew there had to be a word for that phenomenon.  Limey Git says: (7:12:53 PM)    Indeed. i know lots of things about words.  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:13:07 PM)    Word  Limey Git says: (7:13:56 PM)    No, no. Words. with an 's'. you Fag.  Limey Git says: (7:14:04 PM)    :)  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:14:24 PM)    "Hey, there, Jimbo, you big friggin' fag, you want to go make out or something?"---Garrison  Limey Git says: (7:15:24 PM)    "I can't wait for out first shore leave, so I can get me some fucking poontang." ---Garrison (from movie)  The Worst Pirate You've Ever Seen says: (7:15:35 PM)    Man, I love that line!  Limey Git says: (7:15:52 PM)    that whole fagging movie was full of great fagging lines.   ...the conversation went on, but it pretty much deteriorated into name calling and confabulating about how much we like south park.  which is a lot.  must go watch football.

        Happy Belated Columbus Day, Everyone   Not really sure what this particular holiday involves, or even how to celebrate it.  I do know that my bank will proabably have a five day weekend to celebrate it.  I swear to God those bastards will take a paid day off for anything.  I bet banks near the canadian border take Boxing Day off.  As an example, I have, here, a transcript of my last trip to the bank.  Enjoy.    Bank - "What's that you say?  The birthday of a president who died 150 years ago?  Why, yes, we will be closed.  Thanks for asking."  Me- "But what about this deposit I need to make in order to not have my children taken from me by the State?"  Bank- "Ok, our policy is: If, for any reason, you are not completely satisfied, go fuck yourself."  Me- "But my children.... I love them..."  Bank- "Sir, I have a manicure at 3, so if you are quite done...."  Me- *crying* "Oh my god... what am I going to do... "  Bank- "You're obviously a bad father, but for what it's worth, we will be opening back up sometime next Thursday between the hours of 9am and 2pm.  Whenever we get back from our villa in The Azores, really."  Me- "Terceira?"  Bank- "Ha! Do we look like the kind of street trash you'd see on Terceira?  Is that what you are implying?  Becasue if you are, I will...."  Me- "No, no.  I didn't mean...."  Bank- "I certainly hope not.  But if you  must  know, we are going to Faial.  Me- "Beautiful hydrangeas there.  I heard that they are scheduled to get a poor person in 2005."  Bank- *tsk* "Yes, but fortuantely he can only stay for one night."   As you can see, my bank is compassionate.  Compassionate like John Wayne Gacey.

        Meet The New Boss...   ...same as the old boss.  Well, it was a day of utter disappointment here at Nick HQ.  My simple phone interview has blossomed into something much more freightening.  I am to interview with a panel.  That's right.  Three people.  And I have to give a 15 minute presentation.  I'm not sure I want the job that bad.  Many of you might be surprised by the fact that I went to college for a little while.  I know what you're thinking, probably something along the lines of "waahahahahahaha!"  Am I right?  Regardless, I did spend some time achieving higher education.  The biggest problem I had in college (other than  actually  having to go) was Speech class.  I have a zero tolerance policy in regards to making speeches and presentations.  I failed that class three times.  I get freaked out and sweaty and twitchy and I say 'um' and 'uh' a lot.  So what started out as good-odds that I would get this job, has begun to steadily decline into what bookies call a longshot.  I have had personal assitance from my speech teachers, I have tried different mental techniques and I have even tossed back a couple before going to class on speech day, but everything I have planned and prepared goes out the goddamned window when I get up in front of those people.  Staring at me, judging me, mocking me.  This time next week I will be a tightly wound ball of a nerves/crazy mix, that will explode come interview time.  I am so doomed, that Franklin Richards is my god-son.  And now I've got, like, seven people giving me peptalks and telling me to practice and shit.  They obviously don't understand the gravity of the situation.  It is completely inconsequential how much I practice or how well prepared I am, I will still fuck this up.  Optimism has never been one of my strong suits.  Anyone out there have a sedative of some sort that I can pop before my interview next thursday?  Lortab, Vicodin, Ny-Quil?  whatever, really.  Well, goodbye.  I'm going to go cry myself to sleep.

        I Think You Know This Already, But...   ...I care about myself slightly more than anyone else, with the possible exception of Tara Reid. (smokin')  To that end, I am sorry about late posts and no-posts this week, but I have been neglecting my friends, family and frivolous indulgences in order to obtain a promotion at work.  It requires that I do a lot of reading and writing and other not-fun things.  But, I have decided that I am no longer interested in a job that a monkey could do.  My interview is this friday.  I will let you know how it goes.  Also please excuse the sloppiness of my grammar and spelling, I have been up way too late the last couple of nights writing an 'action plan'.  I am so a corporate whore.  it is now 2:01 am and I am going to bed.  p's.

        Now With 20% More Sarcasm   This blog needs more sarcasm like (insert random thing) needs (insert something that random thing dosen't need).  I couldn't think of anything.  But let me tell you this:  Today was fucking bizarre.  On my way home I stopped to buy more delicious cigarettes and there was a man with a voice box at the counter.  It was hilarious.  I laughed until I cried.  After I left the store I was driving home and ther was a  child  riding a motorcycle on the sidewalk.  I'm serious, this kid was  maybe  10.  And it wasn't a dirtbike or one of those small cykes for kids.  It was a fucking motorcycle.  And he was on the SIDEWALK!  See, bizarre.  There was some other things that happened too, but they weren't so much bizarre as they were stressful and agonizing.  In an entirely unrelated story, one of my favorite websites threatened to ban one of my friends if he didn't stop posting in his Warhammer 40k persona.  See he was an Inquisitor for the Imperium, as was I.  They didn't ask me to stop, just him.  And I'm the one that swears a lot.  I don't get it.  Apparently people who run websites that review bad apple software don't enjoy humor.  Too bad.  It doesn't make me mad so much, it's just that it's a public forum, so WTF?  Eh, fuck em.  Please go here and express your outrage.   urlLink Forum   type something like this "Laemkral should be allowed to write whatever he wants, you fascists!"     Don't mention me though, I don't want to get banned too.   WOTD: pejorative \pih-JOR-uh-tiv\, adjective:  1. Tending to make or become worse.  2. Tending to disparage or belittle.

        It's Not That I Don't Care...   It's that I'm lazy.  So we drove to Bar Nunn from Minden, Nebraska.  Do you know what is in Minden, Nebraska?  The answer is "One Of Everything".  We went to Pioneer Village (PV) and they had like two square miles of things.  Not specific things, just things.  They had three huge buildings dedicated to cars.  The Cars were boss.  I mean Ric Ocasek is practically my hero.  That was such a crap joke.  If you laughed at that, you are hereby banished.  I'm bored with talking about my vacation it was fun, there were neat things, and me and my dad owned mom and ginny in spades.  That sums it up.  Now quit asking already.  I took a few days off to regroup and refocus my efforts with the blog, and I... shit, who am I kidding.  I was drunk and watching TV.  TV's fall season has begun and therefore I will be switching off my brain for the next 22 weeks.    If you need to talk to me or something, you should make a commercial and put it on in between Smallville and Angel or on Thursdays, between Friends and Scrubs.  that will be all.  Now make like OJ Simpson, and get the truck out of here.  Too harsh?   How about, make like what hit the WTC and jet.  Too soon?  Goodnight.

        So, Where Was I?   The day we got to YS, we drove through th Grand Tetons.  Many of you may have recieved an email regarding the origin of the name "Grand Teton".  Rest assured it was not from me.  It was from the knowledgeful sister.  I am in charge of hitting things and video games, she is in charge of knowing things and cheese.  It's a tandem.  Like Batman and Robin, only if Batman were more like a Swiss Alex Trebek and Robin were more like a really nerdy bully.  Anyway, for those of you out of the loop, The Grand Tetons were named by the French and it was originally Le Trois Teton, meaning The Three Breasts.  Imagine that.  A French guy naming something after a tit.  That must have been one inspiring rack if this guy named some mountains after it.  Think about monuments and other natural occurances that are named after something else.  The Lincoln Memorial is named after Lincoln Kennedy of the Oakland Raiders, he's an impressive man.  Niagra Falls is named after that show The Fall Guy, a masterpiece in it's own right.  See where I'm going with this?  Those titties must've been something else.  The point is they were fabulous mountains.  At this point they were pretty much the closest we've come to mountains so far on the journey.  We were near The Rockies but we actually drove up into the Tetons, it was pretty awe inspiring.  Every-goddman-thing was covered in trees too.  There wasn't one single thing that wasn't coated in trees.  The park rangers drove tree-cars.  The roads were just elaborate branches.  I think the mountain itself was just a series of ever bigger trees until they all came together in the middle at the highest tree, giving the impression of altitude changes.  An embellished landscape.  Trickery thy name be mother nature!  Unfortunately I did not take any pictures of the Tetons.  I didn't care enough to dig out my camera and take pictures of fucking trees.  Take my word, though, that it was nice.  We arrived at the south entrance of YS/Grand Teton National Forest from a town called Bar Nunn in the armpit of Wyoming.  It is where we stayed the night after driving form Nebraska.  Right behind the RV park was a bar.  I have no idea what it was called but Me and Dad figured we could get a burger and watch monday night football.  So we went there and had dinner and drank some beer and watched Dallas kick the Giants ass.  After a while Mom and Dad get tired and go back to the RV, but me and Gin stay and spend every last dime we brought getting loaded.  After the Darts competiton that was going on 85% of the people there leave, and it's me and gin and about 7 locals.  Well the drunker we get the more talkative we get.  So by the end of the night we had all these locals buying us drinks and asking us what it's like to live in a "flat state".  Nice people but a little dim.  They had a kick ass jukebox at his establishment.  If ever you were in a life and death situation and the only thing that would save the day was the pinnacle of jukebox technology, look no further.  So here's a big shout out to the Locals at the unnamed bar in Bar Nunn, WY.  Thanks for taking the edge off, you crazy bastards.  Next up is Pioneer Village in Nebraska.  The absolute derivation of all things old.  Stay tuned.

        MSU Is Not So Much Ranked As They Are Rank.   KU beat MSU like they stole somethin'.  Hells yeah.  I love when we beat ranked opponents, especially when they are ranked higher than us. (unjustifiably or so it would seem)  I wonder how high we will move up?  Probably just to Fourth, but still that's pretty damn good.  And as much as I like UConn I don't think they are a #1 team.  Maybe a 2, possibly a 3 - but if they're a 3 then where will we put Duke?  How about in a rope with a short drop and a sudden stop.  Obviously I have little love for the Poo Devils, I savored every second of our victory over them in the Tourney last year like it was a bottle of wine made in Heaven by Angels.  Naked Female Angels.  A team that I have less tolerance for is Arizona, maybe that will change now that Bill Walton's spawn is gone.  All this talk of college hoops has inspired me to do my next TTL.  So here it is.  My Top 10 Favorite Men's College Teams 10. Notre Dame (motto: We're too good for a conference.) 09. Oklahoma (Kelvin Sampson is hard not to like.) 08. Michigan State (Fuck The Wolverines!) 07. Oregon (I like white guys who can play point guard.) 06. NC State (The Wolfpack.  How can you not like that?) 05. Texas Tech (Bobby Knight, baby!) 04. Creighton (I'm a fucking believer.) 03. Louisville (Rick Pitino  is  The Mafia.) 02. Southern Illinois (What in God's name is a Saluki?) 01. Kansas (duh.)  Top 10 Favorite Women's College Teams 10. Kansas (Love for the home team.) 09. Purdue (Boilermaker?  I hardly know Her.) 08. Minnesota (Gophers!!!) 07. Texas (They could beat the men given the right cicumstances) 06. Lynn University (They're a DII team from the SSC, a friend of mine is the coach.) 05. UConn (110-4 since 2000.  Jesus.) 04. K-State (Fell apart at the end last year. Won't happen again.) 03. Texas Tech (I love me some Red Raiders.) 02. Virginia Tech (Hokies.  HAHA!) 01. Tennessee (Pat Summit's The Man, er, Woman)  Well, there you go.  By the by if any of you happen to know Diana Turasi and would like to hook me up with her, well, that would be swell.  Ah, who am I kidding I'd just embarass myself.

        Thanksgiving?  More Like, Sucksgiving.   You call it stealing, I call it an homage.  So eat dick.  Seriously, though, get some dicks and eat them.  Oh, I'm sorry does that offend you?  No?  Well, fuck.  What do I have to live for now?  If I can't even offend simpletons like yourselves then I have nothing.    Most of you read Penny-Arcade, methinks, but if you don't, click on the PA link on the right and read the Child's Play post at the bottom of the splash page.  It's awesome.  I'm helping and so should you, unless you hate children.  You don't  hate  children, do you?  I wonder if I should rethink the order in which I type things.  Helping kids first, then eating dicks.  Maybe you would take me more seriously if I ddn't insult you so much, you  God-Damn  thankless whorechildren.  And now, your feature presentation.  The Top Ten Numbers Of All Time 10. 10 09. 09 08. 08 07. 07 06. 06 05. 05 04. 04 03. 02 02. 03 01. 01  As you can see, 3 beat out 2 for the fifth straight year.  Way to go 3.  WOTD:  limpid \LIM-pid\, adjective:  1. Characterized by clearness or transparency; clear; as, "a limpid stream."  2. Calm; untroubled; serene.  3.

        Monday.  Whatever.   What's up?  I have more people's Top Ten albums.  Well, when I say people what I mean is just one person.  Jared Fire to be specific.  And even his list is better than Mike's.  For real.   Here:   10.   The Pillows - FLCL OST 1: Addict 9.      urlLink The Burning Brides  - Fall of the Plastic Empire 8.     The Beatles - Revolution 7.     Beastie Boys - Ill Communications 6.     AC/DC - Back in Black 5.     Zakk Wylde - Book of Shadows 4.     The Stooges - Self Titled 3.     Rage Against The Machine - Self Titled 2.     Metallica - And Justice For All 1.     RHCP - By the Way   I was going to say nice things about Jared Fire but then he had to go and refer to  My Beautiful Tiny God Of A Macintosh  as a speak 'n spell.  So, nevermind.   If you haven't listened to that FLCL album you need to, it is seriously awesome.  Jared's definitely on to something with this list, I think that with a little brainwashing we can get that god damn Rage album off of there and get a real band into to #3 slot.  I said slot.  And now, since I was, uh, gone on friday I present My Favorite Top Ten Movies (as a warning, some of these movies are really bad, and I kow it so fuck off.)  Keep sending your lists in people, it's good to share.  My Top 10 Favorite Movies  10. Major League - "Hey bartender, Jobu needs a refill." 09. Encino Man - "¿el queso es viejo y estropeado, donde esta el sanitario?" 08. The Fifth Element - "Anyone else want to negotiate?" 07. Being There - "I like to watch." 06. The Outlaw Josie Wales - *spits on the dog* 05. South Park: The Movie - "You can't say "fuck" in school, you fucking fat-ass!" 04. Wayne's World - "Garth, that was a Haiku." 03. Terminator 2 - "Easy money." 02. Pirates of the Carribean - "Drink up me hearties. Yo ho!"  01. Grosse Pointe Blank - "Yeah, well, not me.  So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild."  Pirates moved up the list real fucking fast.  I watched GPB like four times before it usurped T2, but with "Pirates" After the first time it was on the list and then moved up continually the more I saw it.  I'm such a fucking fanboy.

        Everything I Say Gets Ignored.   What up, peeps?  New week, same shit.  Endless incoherent ramblings of a vaugely eremitic mad(ish)man.  Howzabout you?  I bet you're wondering where I was yesterday... huh?  You're not?  At all?  Fair enough.  My new job has its high points, but mostly it sucks.  I can't quit though, cause I've only been doing it for a week and a half.  I have to give it and myself some time.  Maybe it will get less sucky when I get better at it.  And if it doesn't, well, then I'll quit.    This week (or what's left of it) I think I will bombard you with inconsequential details about my life in the fun and interesting form of top ten lists.  Mostly I'm doing this because all the creative energy is being sucked out of my brain like a lamprey on the belly of a shark and I haven't had an original thought in maybe 2 weeks. (as evidenced by the crap I've put up here lately)  So without too much more ado, I give to you the Top Ten Things That I like.  10. Crab Rangoon 09. Sports Statistics 08. The Number 24 07. Rembrandt (not the oral care products, the artist) 06. Banana Pudding 05. Volkswagens 04. FLCL  03. Harry Potter 02. DnD 01. T&A  Hard to believe that pudding beat out the greatest artist of all time, but that's the way things go sometimes.  My fucking mouse is a piece of shit.

        Hot Fuckity Damn!   Well, well, well.  What do we have here?  Why, it's a weblog.  You bet your ass it is.  The most in your face and straight shooting weblog since  urlLink Wil Wheaton's.   Thought I made that shit up didn't ya?  Actually Wil's is pretty funny.  And I'm not really in your face, also I've never shot straight either, whatever the hell that means.  I had to begin telemarketing this week.  I have to make 100 telemarketing calls per week in my new position.  It is the gayest thing since gay things came to America from France.  I am utterly disturbed by it and, unless I get better at it, I fear it may be the one thing tat makes me step down from this job.  Gay!  Gay!  Gay!  Like Shawn Franklin.  Ha!

        I'm At A Loss.   Seriously, I couldn't think of anything.  Matter of fact I have been wholly unfunny the last couple days.  I wonder if I need some vitamins or something.  Part of one of my teeth fell out yesterday, it was really weird.  I have some of those white fillings in my front teeth and it was part of one of those.  It doesn't hurt but it looks funny.  I suppose I should go to the  god damned  dentist.  I hate the dentist like I hate black licorice.  Which is to say, a lot.  But I hypothesize that it is a neccesary evil.  Like satan.  I mean, if there were no satan, then  everyone  would go to heaven and it would get all crowded and smell bad like Venice.  Plus it would take some of the fun away from those off us who are going there.  If everyone went to Heaven then I couldn't rub it in Grant's face when he was in hell getting his skin rendered from his body while Hamatula continually fuck his ass with their enormous barbed penis' and I was in Heaven getting a blowjob from Lucy Liu atop a bed made of money while Beethoven puts the whole thing to music.  A great loss, to be sure.  WOTD!!!!  solicitous \suh-LIS-uh-tuhs\, adjective:  1. Manifesting or expressing care or concern.  2. Full of anxiety or concern; apprehensive.  3.

        What We Have Here, Is A Failure To Communicate...   Many of you probably think that's a line from a Guns 'n Roses song, and while you would not be wrong it is actually from the movie Cool Hand Luke.  I really don't have a point here, I was mostly just rambling.  How bought those Chiefs, eh?  9-0.  You Gotta like that, unless you're a Cleveland fan.  In which I case I'm sorry, but your team sucks.  I love when professional athletes set a great example for the youth of America by getting arrested for DUI.  Makes you proud.  Today was the first day of my new job.  I didn't really do much, it was pretty cool.  OK, that's all.  I'm bored and tired so I'm going to go play ESPN Football on my Xbox.  NS out.

Not any of you obviously, but maybe my parents.  Then again, perhaps I'm giving them to much credit as well.  Sometimes it seems like I'm only doing this for myself.  Don't get me wrong I love writing this shit, but there are other, more fun, ways to make myself smile.  Fuck you guys.  Fuck you until you can't be fucked anymore.  And then fuck your pets.

        Let Me Ask You A Question...   There is a blogging service that I am interested in using, but basically it would mean deleting all my old shit and all the archives etc.  It looks really slick and it's relatively inexpensive.  They host files and such for me (as opposed to having someone else host them and then me using that url in the html tag)  And I get to track who looks at what and there is a comments section for you guys to talk back at me and stuff.  I really like it but, what do you think?  I know you lazy fucks probably won't respond to this but I figured I throw it out and see if anyone has an opinion.    Have you read the scripts yet?  I enabled tracking on those files with my hosting service, so I will know how many people download them. I'm watching you.  Do it or be ashamed of yourself.  Anyway.  Think about waht I said and please throw your opinion my way.  I know you won't but I have faith.

        Please Take Notice.   I have changed the links on the right.  You will now see a section entitled "Read These Scripts" and two links underneath it.  These were written by my good pal Adam Huddleston and Co.  He spent a lot of time on these, please read them and drop him a line  urlLink HERE  and let him know what you think.  All comments are welcome and encouraged.  Except negative ones, which you can shove up your respective asses.

        It's Here!    urlLink Get Some!   If that doesn't make you feel good, then by God, get the hell out!  So I got that job that I wrote about a couple week ago.  Thought you would like to know after I talked about it a couple weeks ago.    It's been a good day by most standards.  I got a raise, that trailer came out and I traded for Chad Pennington on my fantasy team.  Plus I sold a 1200.00 oversize color order.  Hard to beat that.  Now if I can find some chick to give me some brain.  Oh yeah, and it's Word of the Day today, which I just love.    For your edification please allow me to present, today's Word of the Day!!  crux \KRUHKS\,  noun;  plural cruxes, also cruces \KROO-seez\:  1. The basic, central, or critical point or feature.  2. Anything that is very puzzling or difficult to explain or solve.   I've always liked that word.  Thank You and Goodnight.

        What The Hell Are You Looking At?   And quit grabbing my ass while you're at it.  What up peeps?  How was everyone's halloween?  Mine was cool.  There was a girl dressed as Janet from the Rocky Horror Picture Show at this party I went to.  Now, normally that's no big deal, except that she was dressed as Dirty Janet the Slut from the second half of the movie.  Basically she came in her underwear and said she was Janet.  Thankfully she was highly attractive, otherwise I don't think she could have pulled it off.  Ah, who am I kidding no one even saw what her face looked like.  She could have had a beard and no one would have noticed.  So what's up with those Oakland Raiders?  They got beat by the Detroit Lions.  WTF?!  I'm pretty sure OU's football team could beat the Lions.  How the hell do the defending AFC champs lose to a fucking football team that has won 7 games since 2001.  That's just bad football.  And speaking about bad football... yesterday as a whole was a piss poor day for football.  The only game I wanted to watch was the Bengals game.  How sad is it when I actually want to watch a Bengals game.  I guess that GB @ Minnesota game last night was good, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the crap they put on TV.  I guess if you're a Colts fan (which I'm not - Go Miami!) it was a good day.  The Chiefs will be back in action next Sunday then all will be right in the world.  As The Chiefs get into the second half of the season they have a soft-like-charmin schedule left.  With the notable exception of the Vikes in Minnesota, but hell even they have lost their last two games.  The rest of our opponents have a combined record of 25-39.  Only 2 of the remaining 8 opponents have winning records; Minnesota (6-2) and Denver (5-3).  Denver, like the Vikes, have lost their last two and none of the others opponents (Bungles, Browns, Faders, Chargers, Lions and Bears) have more than 3 wins.  That is cheese.  As long as we don't lose focus and don't get big heads we should roll to a 15-1 record, 14-2 at the very worst.  It should be interesting to watch.  Sorry about all the sports talk, my fantasy team has got me in a tizzy, and I'm all Gung-Ho-Sports-Guy today.    See the thing is, I was alone in first place in my fantasy league at 6-1.  Well, week 8 rolls around and me and my opponent tie at 138 points each, and neither of us has a guy playing on Monday night.  So After all the points are tallied I'm still at the top with a 6-1-1 record.  A game and a half above the next guy.  But two days later the fucking NFL adjusted the stats of some players who just happened to be on my team and I lose 5 points for week 8.  All of the sudden I lost the game 138-133 and now have a record of 6-2 with a bye in week 9.  What this means is that the two guys I am ahead of (both with 5-2 records) can win this week (meaning yeasterday and tonight) and tie me.  Luckily I have more total points than one of them so I will only fall to second place if they both win.  The good news is that the guy who has more points than me and a chance to tie got his ass handed to him yesterday and can't win with any players in tonights game, the other guy won so we are tied at 6-2 but I'll still have my number one spot secured by 90-ish points.  The bad news is that I play that guy in week 10 and we will find out who is the shit.  The worse news is that he's won 6 straight, his team is rocking right now.  But I beat him in Week 1 and I'll do it again in seven days.  I just need someone to go find Tory Holt and Peyton Manning and break their legs.  Please.  I hate losing.

        Cindy Lou Who Is A Whore   She is.  So here we are, it's Jesus' Birthday and we are at war.  That doesn't seem very fucking christmasy to me.  I wonder if Jesus were here what he would think about the current goings on in the world.  Lucky for you lot, I happen to know him and he has granted me a little time in which to interview him.  But first let me give you a little background information on the one they call Jesus.  Jesus was a Jew whose language was Aramaic and who followed the Jewish customs and religion all his life. He was condemned to death by crucifixion by the Romans who did not like that his followers considered him as a king (they did not understand that His kingdom was not of this world). But the Romans condemned Him at the request of the Jewish authorities that did not accept the suggestion that he could have been the Messiah they expected,                                  and whose appearance on earth was foreseen by previous Jewish prophets. They knew that if Jesus was the Messiah their authority would disappear.  That whole kiling Jesus thing didn't really work out for anybody.  Especially that Pilate guy who probably has his own wing in Hell.  So without further ado, I give to you Jesus Christ; Lamb of Hosts.  Jesus Christ: Hey everyone.  Me: What's new Jesus?  JC: You know, not much.  I've been doing some writing lately.  Under a pseudonym of course.  Me: Anything we would know?  JC: Dude, I'm Jesus Christ, of course you would know it.  Me: It's Harry Potter isn't it?  I fucking knew it!  JC: No, man, I didn't write Harry Potter.  Not to take anything away from J.K. she's one of our favorites, you know?  Me: You and God have favorites?  JC: Of course.  Think about your life compared to other people.  You know damn well Steve Jobs isn't that smart.  But we like him and so you get to have iPods and 27" flat panel Cinema Displays.  Me: Thanks for that by the way.  JC: Sure.   Me:  Let's move onto the Middle East.  How do you feel about what's going on over there right now.  JC: I'm pretty pissed about it.  I mean they're bombing so close to my home, how would you feel if some redneck was bombing Topeka?  Me: There's no point in lying since you know what I'm going to say.  I really don't care that much, but come on you just compared Galilee to Topeka for God's sake.  Oops, sorry.  JC: Don't sweat it, it's not like you coveted your neighbors dog or whatever.  Me: His dog?  JC: To be fair that dog is  really  smart.  ME: Right.  So, anyway, if you're so pissed about the Middle East why don't you do something about it, I mean you're Jesus dude.  Omnipotent and all that.  JC: That's true but we try to let you people make your own decisions even though you suck at it.  If we solved every little problem for you it would make you incompetent jerks instead of just jerks.  HA!  Think about the Ion stroyline in Green Lantern, it's a lot like that.  Boy, that Judd Winnick is a cool cat isn't he?  Me: Hell yeah.  Do you like The Authority?  JC: Listen, as much as I want to sit here and talk comics with you, um, uh...  Me: Nick  JC: Yeah, Nick.  As Much as I want to I can't I have to be in some guy in Denver's dreams in about 2 minutes.  Me: Aren't you like everywhere all at once or something?  JC: Listen, most of that stuff they taught you in Sunday school is crap and scare tactics to make you act right.  Me:  So we can do pretty much anything we want?  JC: Adhere to the comandments, uh, my son.  And don't try to lie when you get to Heaven, we may not watch you all the time but we definitely know when you're lying to us.  If you try to pull one over on Me or Dad it is a sure fire way to get an express ticket on the Hell train.  Me: Hell Train?  JC: I said it.  Me: Alright.  Well, Jesus we're about out of time so we are going to finish up with a segment that was made famous on The Daily Show by Craig Kilborn He called it 5 Questions, and so do we.  JC: Craig is neat guy.  Me: Neat?  JC: *nods*  Me: Ok, are you ready Annointed One?  JC: Does a crucified savior return to life after 3 days?  Me: ...  JC: That means yes.  And don't call me Annointed One.  Me: Right, sorry.  Okay, Jesus, Number 1 - Egg Salad or Tuna Salad?  JC: Egg Salad.  Me: That is correct!  Number 2 - Where in the world  is  Carmen Sandiego?  JC: I believe she's in Monaco.  Me: 2 for 2, Jesus.  Number 3 -  Who will inherit the Earth?  JC: The meek... no wait wait!  It's Bill Gates isn't it?  Me: Let me check with the judges... they're going to give it to you, but from the look on their faces you could have said Fran Tarkenton and they would have given it to you.  JC: He was born Feb. 3, 1940.  Me: I know.  Moving on.  Number 4 - Best punctuation mark?  JC: duh, Semicolon.  Me: Uncanny.  4 for 4 folks!  Number 5 - How many...  JC: 16  Me: How...  JC: Son of God.  Me: Ah.  Well there you have it folks.  Jesus Christ, A perfect 5 fo 5.  Well played Jesus.  JC: Thanks.  Me: No thank you.  You know, for being on my blog and the whole dying for my sins bit.  JC: I would say it was my pleasure but neither one of them were that great.  Ha! I'm just kidding you're a swell guy.  I'll see you in about 26 years.  Me: Why?  JC: Heart attack.  Me: Ah.   Well there you go, guys.  A little glance into the psyche of my savior and yours, the one... the only... Jesus!  Happy Birthday guy.

        Fuck Home Depot.   What kind of multinational closes at 9pm?  Buncha fucking savages.  What happens if I have a lumber  emergency at 10pm?  What then?  Well, I'd be fucked then, that's what.  Instead I'm left to fashion my own lumber out of a felled pine tree in my neighbor Steve's backyard using a planer and a really sharp bit of rock that's tied to a stick.  Now I've got callouses and an akward limp and my fucking porch looks like it was built by St. Mary's School For The Blind's shop class.  Fucking Home Depot.  Fuck them forever.

        Drunker Than Two Irish Guys With A Stolen Credit Card.   The Good Doctor's bachelor party went off without much trouble.  We got to see a comedian drive a man to the brink of murder, we got to see some Med Students who are vehemently opposed to smoking fire up some cigars, and finally I got to save one of my friends from the diabolical clutches of an extremely drunk and unattractive older woman.  Good times, good times.  I don't think anyone had as much fun as JP did, though. (You Bastard!)  Amazingly enough, everyone stayed out of jail, too (for now).   The details of the evening are not as savory as I'm making them out to be, it was more like a regular night at the bar with 9 of your friends.  But we still had some fun.  Now to come up with an alibi...

        Goddamn Karma   I have a cold, and I blame Mike Chacey.  If he hadn't make me say to him the other day "I don't ever get sick, I haven't had a flu shot in 15 years, etc. etc."  I twas along those lines and Mike tricked me into saying them, so I would draw the ire of the Cold Demons.  I think Mike might be on the take.  You know what I mean?  He's building a good relationship with them so when he becomes a real "doctor" he can make money hand over fist by making his patients continously sick with the help of the Cold Demons.  They would split the profits 60-40.  You're such a bastard Mike.    I wish the BoSox would pull the damn trigger on the A-Rod trade.  That is all.

        LOTR:ROTK   I thought about going to see it today, but then I realized I hate people and would rather be torn in twain by a couple of dogs hopped up on meth than fight with Elrodin The Geek Protectorate of her Highness Glamadril The High Elf princess, or whatever.  Now if I was fighting them on paper using dice that would be a totally different story, those bitches would perish.  I will probably see it tomorrow or sunday or whenever.  It's wedenesday and I dop not want to deprive you of 2 WOTD in a row, so here you go.  WOTD: derogate \DER-uh-gayt\, intransitive verb: 1. To deviate from what is expected. 2. To take away; to detract; -- usually with 'from'.  I have mentioned in the past my love of the intransitive verb.  God I hope that girl below is of legal age.

        I'm Still Pissed.   Sorry about the sabbatical, but I am still pretty hot about the K-State incident.  Faithful reader Joe Clements had this to say regarding my insinuation that Bruce Springsteen is a huge flaming 'mo.      "I should have clarified:  I think Springsteen sucks too.  He couldn't sing a note in tune if his very life depended on it, and he's only an average guitar player.  I just mentioned him because he's a good (great) songwriter.  His singing is gayer than an ass with two dicks in it.  Joe"   I couldn't have said it better myself, although technically that last part  is  mine, therefore I don't need to say it any better since I already used that phrase once.  And although it might have been used to describe something other than Springsteen, it is still very applicable.  More to follow.    PS - Anyone know how to get ahold of Keira Knightley's phone number?  Soooo hot.

        Fucking K-State.   If I ever come across the K-State football team I will destroy them.  I wish their plane would crash in the mountains so they would be forced to eat each other, like that stupid movie.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the Big XII championship trophy resting easily in the confines of our glorious state, what I'm not for is them sucking every ounce of win juice from the state.  For them to beat the heavily favored Sooners, KU's basketball team had to get beat by Stanford and the Chiefs got fucking routed by Denver.  Some of you will state that the Chiefs are actually from MO, and to that I respond by saying "shut the fuck up, no one cares what you think."  It doesn't matter if K-State wins or loses that game - they still go to the fiesta bowl and OU still goes to whatever three hour commercial is posing as the national title game this year.  But the Chiefs are vying for their first divisional title since '97 and a number 1 seed in the playoffs (which they conceded to the Pats due to a better conference record) and KU is in the early stages of a title run themselves.  K-State was just showing off.  They should have just conceded victory and left all the win juice in the fucking win juice reservoir, so that teams that actually need it can  fucking  have it.    On a different tangent - Goddamn I feel sorry for USC. I have no love for anyone in California, but dammit if the Trojans didn't get fucked squarely in their asses.  With OU's (unnecessary) loss the Trojans moved up to #1 in the coaches poll and #1 in the AP poll, but somehow they will not be playing the new #2 (in both polls) LSU Tigers for the national championship.  LSU (#2) and OU (#3) will be playing in that particular bowl game, while USC (#1) plays the University of Michigan Wolverines (#4) in one of the other bowl games.  The BCS was created for a number of reasons, but one of the main ones was to avoid this very situation.  The same thing happened in 1991, which was the year before the BCS came to be.  One of the other reasons it was created was to not have rematches of regular season games in the main Bowl Games, which has also happened this year.  It seems to me that the BCS is flawed.  I don't fully understand it, of course, but let's ask USC what they think.  I submit to you a quote from Chris Fowler, an analyst for ESPN, about this very subject.   "The BCS is what it is: a system created to inject more fairness in to the bowl system than existed before and select two teams to play in a "Championship Game," while keeping the forces pushing for a playoff at bay.  It failed this season. More importantly, it failed for the third time in the last four seasons. This time, though, with an important twist: the controversy is NOT which contender is most worthy to face the clear No. 1 ranked team. The No. 1 ranked team is nowhere to be found in the BCS game. And it's a much bigger BCS headache, because half the national title could be decided three days before the Nokia Sugar Bowl is even played."   The entire article can be found urlLink  HERE.   It a very good read and it sheds light to some of the things that I don't know about.  In the meantime I have to go have a chat with Bill Self about KU's pitiful, I'm not sure that word is strong enough, effort out in the C-A.  58 points?  We are  so  better than that.  I'm sure the new Ball Coach will set things straight.  Not to worry, diehards, we'll be dancing come march.   That was fairly inspirational, I should get a goddamn medal or something.

        What's Wrong With Your Kid?  Is He Retarded?   I hate recanting my own decrees, but in this case I guess I'll make a fucking exception.  Here is Joe Clements Top Ten Albums list.  I'm still trying to figure out how Springsteen made anyone's list.  You know, since he sucks so much dick.  I'm talking like metric tons of dick.  witness and absorb:   10.  Dave Mathews - Listener Supported 9.  Frank Sinatra - Sinatra at the Sands 8.  Sting - Bring On The Night 7.  Bruce Springsteen - Greatest Hits 6.  Dave Holland - Prime Directive 5.  Steely Dan - Katy Lied 4.  Miles Davis - Kind of Blue 3.  J.J. Johnson - Vivian 2.  Steely Dan - Alive In America 1.  Tower of Power - Soul Vaccination Live '98   The Sting is understandable, though, becasue he's a stone cold pimp.  Fo' Reelz.  Man, I'm gonna catch some shit for the Springsteen comment.  Just so you all know I shot a 50 at Oakmont.  Did I mention that?  I previously shot a 53.  A 50 is 3 strokes better.  See how that works?  Also I was playing Skins with Sergio Garcia and I beat him 16 Skins to 2.  Man, golf lingo sounds dirty as hell.  Skins?  Strokes?  Threesome?  Fucking twisted Scottish people.  I'll catch you later.

Yeah I know your fucking jealous.  I think the top 10 lists have played themselves out, so we will be moving away from that.  I think in their stead we will have, um, we'll have.... well shit.  I can't think of anything.  So, yeah.  I, um, have a 6:15 Tee Time at St. Andrews, so uh, see you later.  N Out.

        Suck It.   Hey Ya.  What up?  It's a gloroious morning here at Ranch De La Seaman.  Also I got and email from Bryan Jones.  In addition to filling me in on how he's doing, he also told me that he slipped a disc in his back.  Apparently it was caused by the rigorous humping he gave my mother last night.  Incidentally he told me to tell you he hates all of you and he hopes you all die.  He sent me his top ten albums list as well.  Here it is:   10. Number 10 is too tough, I dont want to miss someone, so I will leave it blank. 9. John Frusciante - Niandra Lades, and Usually Just A T-Shirt 8. Mr Bungle - Mr Bungle 7. Daisy Chainsaw - Elenteen 6. The Stooges - Funhouse 5. MC5 - High Time 4. Nirvana - In Utero 3. Sonics Rendezvous- Sweet Nothing 2. RHCP - Blood Sugar Sex Magik 1. Beastie Boys - Paul's Boutique    So there you go.   Hope you enjoyed that.  I know I did.     WOTD:  deracinate \dee-RAS-uh-nayt\, transitive verb:  1. To pluck up by the roots; to uproot.  2. To displace from one's native or accustomed environment.

        I Look Like Something That Starts With A 'F' And End With A 'G'.   So I needed to come into to work tonight (which is where I am now) and do some work on my call log, which will hopefully keep my employed.  But I haven't showered tonight so my hair was standing straight up in the back and, because I didn't want to look like a fuckhole, I wet my hair and put some gel in it.  Well one of my coworkers comes up to me and says "why is there glitter in your hair?" and I say "What the fuck are you talking about?"  So I go look in a mirror and my hair is tinted gold and has glitter in it.  It would be nice, you know, if I liked the cock.  It was some gel that I used on Halloween a year, or so, ago and for some reason I neglected to remember the integral fact that it had GOLD FUCKING GLITTER in it.  Now I look like the goddamn Fairy Prince of the Hinterlands,  or something .

        You Gonna Die Just Like Your Daddy.   Here I sit, eating a four cheese pizza, pondering the usage of those commas back there.  I feel a sense of calm coming over me as I realize that the usage is correct.  I wonder if the former Mrs. A would be proud of me for using punctuation correctly, or would she be appaled that I am trying to get praise for something a 7 year old should be able to do.  I think she'd be a little of both.  Mr. Nichols, on the other hand, would be straight appaled.  But he's German, what do you expect?  Enough of that, most of you don't even know who those people are.  Mrs. A was my senior english teacher and Mr. Nichols was my German teacher for 4 years.  I feel pretty confident that neither of them have ever had a student that they would be more disappointed in.  I don't say that with any joy.  All of this sounds like the beginning of a self pity rant.  So, I'm gonna nip that motherfucker right in the bud.  Instead of feeling sorry for myself or having other people feel sorry for me, let's look at the following pretty picture and think about how good life is because of it.

        Talk About A Kick In The Nuts.   We are experienceing mad turnover at work right now.  I've worked for a really understaffed Kinko's before and it is one of the worst experiences ever.  If you wanna see someone mad fuck up their Wedding Programs two hours before the ceremony.  I have a lot of friends that work in retail and I understand that customers suck balls, I really do, but you can't hold a candle to a pissed off Kinko's customer.  They're not mad at the company I work for, they're mad at me, and that is completely different.  It makes you feel bad  You know, unless your a completely heartless bastard who hates puppies and bubblegum.  The next 6 months are going to just drag on, hopefully we can get some decent employees in who are quick learners, otherwise I might die.  ugh.  Moving on.  I am pissed at the goddamn iTunes Music Store.  Think about that for a second.  I am mad at an ethereal place that exists solely in the digital walls of iTunes.  Is my anger justified?  Well that all depends on how much you like Iron Maiden.  All I want is one goddamn song off of Powerslave, and it just so happens to be the only Maiden album available as "album only".  See the other ones you can just pick and choose whatever song you want.  Fucking capitalist bitches.  I'm going to go let off some steam at an eBar.

        Apple.  pfff.   That "pfff" was that sound you make when you're disgusted at something.  Anyone who knows me, knows that I am a diehard Apple user. (and you can save your shitty little comments for someone who gives a fuck) But recently I have been having these experiences with my beautiful optical mouse that came with my computer.  These experiences can only be classified as fucking enraging.  My mouse just periodically stops working and when it does it hangs my system.  There is nothing worse for a computer, save dropping it, than turning it off at the power supply.  My mouse was threating the peaceful infrastructure of my OS.  So I kept putting off getting a new one because my other one, when used gingerly, would suffice.  Tonight, it just stopped working.  The optical light was on, I had just restarted, the goddamn thing was plugged in but there was nothing.  So I began to use my computer with nothing but my keyboard which, thanks to Apple's brilliant designers, is quite easy.  But there is something about a mouse that makes a computer whole.  It compliments the way the entire Operating System is designed.  So I said fuck it, I just got back form Best Buy where I purchased a  urlLink Logitech Wireless Optical mouse .  It's pretty slick.  It's not the one I wanted, but it'll do.  There was this  urlLink one Kensington wireless optical mouse that I wanted  but I needed one right away, and Best Buy, inaddition to not carrying any Mac products, also does not carry any Kensington products.  Due to my procrastination, and Apple's apparent inability to make a mouse that works for longer than a one and one half years, I now own an inferior product.  And who know maybe I'll grow to like my new mouse.  Or maybe I'll get pissed and buy tha damn Kensington one anyway.  Then I'll have a spare.

        Do You Ever Use Ebay?   I have come to the conclusion that getting outbid on an auction is one of the most disenchanting and acrimonious things ever.  I am trying to buy an iBook on Ebay, and I've been out bid no less than seven times, today.  The last time by 450 dollars.  My max bid was $450 and I get this message saying "you've been outbid" so I go check it out and the new price is 900 bucks.  Well fuck that, what am I, made out of gold dubloons or some shit?  I have a good paying job, and I want tbuy a goddman laptop before I get fired from said good paying job, is that too much to ask for?  And what about these counter bidding fucks?  Don't they have anything better to do than pick on a man who wants to pay less than half price for a newish laptop?  Fucking geeks.  Oh well.  Friends Season 6 comes out the 27th.

        Fuck!   Just wanted to get that out of the way.  I have nothing of interest to note today, so I think I'll relate some uninteresting tales of interest today.  I need to get into more fights or something, it seems like th only time I have something funny to write is when I'm pissed at someone or when somebody done me wrong.  Perhaps it's time I came face to face with the fact that my introspection is boring.  You need excitement, you need adventure!  Unless you're a Jedi.  For a Jedi craves not these things.  Anyone catch the trailer for Kevin Smith's  urlLink new movie .  I feel that it will be good, however I am slighty curious as to how his first attempt at a non-askewniverse movie will turn out.  And a romantic comedy no less!  I am a fiend for the romantic comedy.  Here are a couple other flicks that look bomb-ish:  urlLink Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow  appears to be a World War II-Big O-Superhero thing.  It's got that same kind of bigger-than-life-film-noir thing going on that made the first Batman movie so awesome.  Plus, Angelina Jolie!  If you are like me in the sense that you thought Pitch Black was dope, then you will like this prequel-esqe thing called  urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick .  Vin reprises his role as Riddick in what looks like a mix between Alice In Wonderland and 1984.  There are some other funny looking shits coming out soon.  Check out all the trailers  urlLink here .

        Tuesday! Tuesday! Tuesday!   See monster truck master Sal Rodriguez Jump his Monster 1982 AMC Pacer over a schoolbus full of children blindfolded!  Sal, not the children.  Wouldn't that be funny.  We were cracking wise at work today when I said something that apparently crossed the line.  Some guy we want to fire is about to be deployed to the Middle East and we were joking about it, cause we're heartless shitheads, and I said "maybe he'll get shot".  See we were joking around and everyone just sort of stopped and looked at me like "Jesus Christ, Nick"  So I said "What?  You're gonna fire him."  and my boss replied "Yeah, but not kill him."  So I said 'I didn't say anything about killing him, I just said 'shot', you know, like in the shoulder".  Apparently this was too much for people who talk about fucking the life out of each other's mothers.  Am I right in thinking they overreacted, or did I actually go to far?  You know what, I still think it's funny.  Fuck everyone else.  I don't actually hope the guy gets shot, but it was funny to say at the time.  I like making everyone freak out.  Anyway...

        Naked Friday!!!   Just kidding.  That was last week.  You know, I've been sitting here in front of my glorious Macintosh for ten minutes trying to think of something funny or insightful to write and I couldn't think of anything so I decided to write about the fact that couldn't think of anything.  Let's backtrack for a moment.  I challenge anyone of you to actually show eveidence of me having written anything insightful, ever.  I doubt it the way I doubt anything that comes out of Shawn Franklin's mouth.  Sometimes I'm funny, but mostly I'm offensive and trite.  Just the way I like my women.  Actually I don't really know how I like my women.  Let me give you an analogy.  If you've never had a steak in your entire life and you don't know that much about them and you go to a restaurant one day and order a Rib Eye and the waiter asks how you want it cooked, what do you say?  You just don't know.  You have no experience to base your preference on.  And that is like me and women.  You see if I'm left with nothing to write except my surface thoughts, it's a painful experience for all involved.  I could go into a tangent about how I hate... you know, everything, but we've been down that road before.  So what are we left with?  My unmitigated and perfect impotence at securing a date.  Like Michael Jordan with basketball and Wayne Gretzky with hockey, I have taken ineptness and elevated it into an exhalted art form, setting new levels of awkwardness that future generations can only hope to aspire to.  Watching me lay down my smooth is like watching Jean Van de Velde blow a three stroke lead on the 18th hole of the final round in the 1999 Open Championship, it's really quite stirring.  You realize you're witnessing something that has the potential to be a catastrophe and ends up being much much worse.  This whole process has been physically painful.  I'm going to go to the Granasty and watch some ska bands do their respective  things.

        Strange Happenings   Today has been weird.  Work was weird today.  There were no kids riding motorcycles on the sidewalk this time, but it was still messed up.  I can't really explain it.  I would say you had to have been there, but I don't think that would really help.  Later, I got home and was subjected to a conversation about shaved asses by one of my friends.  Man.  What do you do with that?  I can't, say, put it on a greeting card.  I can't relay it to my father.  Apparently, it's just for me.  How special.  I am going to go ponder this new information and attempt to process it or perhaps filter it out of my brain using a complex system of pulleys and levers.

        Good News In The KC   You probably have already heard, but Chiefs (sorry) D Coordinator, Greg Robinson quit yestrday.  Woo Hoo!  I don't wish the guy hard times but, damn our defense has been sorry for the last three years and it's really hard to blame that on personnel.  Hopefully they will bring back Gunther Cunningham.  He was shitty as our head coach, but that was mostly Marty Shitenheimer's fault.  Marty left the ranks filled with assholes who don't care about anything but money, like Chester "the molester" McGlockton, and Bam "these ain't my drugs" Morris.  When you have those kind of guys and you insert a head coach who demands his guys play with passion, they will clash and the head coach will suffer.  Especially when your record is 16-16.  Again, not entirely Gun's fault.  Gunther would make an outstanding D Coordinator, especially with the guys we have.  He's coached half of them already and they like him, more importantly they will play their asses off for him.  I'm not saying that he is the only option but he's definitely up there.  We don't have to have a Tampa like D, we just need to be middle of the road.  Instead of giving up 356 yards a game we need to give up like  290. Instead of being ranked 29th (2003) or 32 (2002) on D we need to be ranked 14th or 15th.  Couple that kind of D with our #1 offense and that equals Super Bowl Appearance and possible victory.  None of that shit mattered this year though becasue New England is going to win it all no matter who they play.  All the games from the first day of the season have just been a mere formality for the Pats.  Give 'em the trophy now so I can switch my focus to Hockey and College Hoops.

        We're All The Same.   Well, shit.  What's up today my peoples?  I hope everyone got as much of a kick out of the questions segment as I did.  That shit was fun.  You know how sometimes a really good comedian opens for a more famous comedian and he kind of steals the show?  The more famous guy would be reluctant to follow up the better comedian fearing that his act would be insufficient to keep the crowd and the level they had previously been elevated to by the first comedian.  That's kind of how I feel today.  I don't want to follow up the questions because they were funny and I'm not feeling very whimsical today.  Therefore anything I write would be doing you a disservice.  One observation though, I cannot fucking stand companies wo do not let you pay things online.  My insurance company does not have an online bill pay option.  How archaic is that?  Fucking cavemen.  Here's something that's long overdue.  WOTD:  tergiversation \tuhr-jiv-uhr-SAY-shuhn\, noun:  1.

        She's Just A Small Town Girl   Response was overwhelming to last week's musings.  And by "overwhelming" I mean three people responded.  It's a new record!!  Anyway you guys were pretty united in your answers, and yet some of you were stupid and answered incorrectly.  Keep in mind that these are my questions and therefore whatever I think is right  is,  in fact, right.  Let's move on.  In regards to Jesus v. Larry Bird in H-O-R-S-E the reponses were mostly similar.  Let me Give you an example.  I said Larry Bird would be too much man for Jesus to handle based on Jesus' panache for not misusing his powers, and Larry Bird's natural Basketball prowess.  Alert Reader Joe Clements and his cronies came to the same conclusion based on this:  "There's nothing in the Bible about Christ having mad hoops."   That statement, in it's entirety, is true.  Billy had this to say about it:  "You impressed me with your Jesus logic, it's pretty sound."   That means he agrees with me.  On the other side of the coin we have the ever-argumentative Mike Chacey who proclaims:  "Jesus would beat Larry Bird, because besides being the son of god, and salvation for all humanity, as well as God on Earth, he had somthing going for him that always held back Larry Birds game.  Jesus was Black."   C'mon, everyone knows that Jesus was a Jew and, excluding Sammy Davis, jr., who ever heard of a black Jew?  The Blade v. Angel question was not as tough.  Everyone said that Blade would kill Angel.  Various reasons include: Blade's superior knowledge of the martial arts, his superior weaponry and the fact that he has none of the negative side affects of vampirism. Billy and I maintain, though, that you couldn't count Angel out until he had actually been dusted.  JLA v. Authority in dodgeball was a toss up.  Mike says that the JLA would "trounce" The Authority based on this:  "Justice League would win at dodgeball.  First off, there is more of them, but lets assume that we parred down the team to equal numbers.  Most every member of the JLA has super speed (Batman and shitty Aquaman being notable exceptions).  Only Apollo has super speed with The Authority.  I figure that speed of such magnitude gives the the JLA all it needs to trounce The Authority."   Once again Mike is wrong and I'll tell you why.  Super speed and Hyper-strength are all great and what not but The Midnighter could beat the JLA by himself.  The Midnighter goes into a fight (any fight) having already calculated every possible outcome and knows exactly where and how he must throw a ball to get someone out, by that rationale, as long as everyone is being occupied, The Midnighter would take them out one by one.  Billy agreed with me in one sentence:  "[The Authority] work better together than the JLA, or any team perhaps."   As for Yoda v. Xavier, this should have been easy.  Yoda. Yoda. Yoda.  There is no way Chuck Xavier could possibly beat Yoda in chess, ever, in a million billion years.  Joe agrees:  "Because he's a FUCKING Jedi!"   Billy also agrees with me:  "Yoda.  Come on, he's THE Jedi Master."   And my logic dictates that, yes, Charles Xavier is perhaps the most powerful telepath in the world, but Yoda is a superior strategist and he's also 850 years older and his powers are much more refined than Xaviers.  There's no way Xavier could penetrate Yoda's mind.  Mike, again, disagrees:  "Xavier would beat Yoda.  Yoda is a superior strategiest, but Charles could just read his mind and see what he was planning.  Charles would also win beat him in 20 questions, rock paper scissors, and pick a number between 1 and 10, for the very same reason."   My favorite question was Team Gretzky/Batman v. Team Roy/Wolvie.  Everyone agreed except me.  Joe didn't really say who would win unless a fight broke out, in which case it was Wolverine.  I think that Wolverine and Patrick Roy would win for three reasons.  1- Wolverine and Roy (pronounced "Wa") are canadians.  Never bet against canadians when Hockey is involved.  2- Gretzky might be the best goal scorer ever, but Patty Roy is the best goaltender of all time and goaltenders will win that battle 7 times out of 10.  3- There would be a power struggle for dominance on Team Gretzky/Batman, both of them would demand to be the leader and that would distract them just enough for Batman to get scored on.  Plus, Gretzky sucks on the defensive end.   Billy said it would be Batman and Gretzky:  "I really have to go with Batman becasue hed figure out some way to stop Wolverine."   Mike also said that Team Batman would win:  "I would actually have to give it a toss up. Batman has displayed a fine ability to adapt to different fields of combat through clever use of toys (i.e. skates), and has most likely practiced, or at least come up with a plan for such an event.  Logan, on the other hand, is Canadian, giving the ferral canuck an equally impossing advantage.  There for I leave it up to their partners, and Gretzky would score on Roy like he was a drunk 16 year old at junior prom.  Advantage:  Gretzky/Batman."   Mike did concede the Canadian point, but he is dead wrong about Gretzky/Roy.   So there you have it.  Whatever "it" may be.

        Award Shows Are Out Of Control   They have an  urlLink award show for blogs now.   That's ridiculous.  People are being praised for offering their opinion.  I've been imposing my opinion on people for years, most recently in blog format, and I've never won shit.  I should have won a fucking nobel prize by now and at the very least garnered a goddamn nomination.  If opinions were delicious meatballs I would be Lord and Master of Meatball Land this very moment.  I would reside in the highest tower of a glorious meatball castle and rule from on high, not unlike Jesus.    Speaking of Jesus, I read something very interesting today in ESPN the Magazine.  My favorite sports writer,  urlLink Bill Simmons , asked a question in his coloumn, The Sports Guy, that I honestly couldn't answer.  It wasn't a trivia question that one would just know the answer to, it was a question that had to be answered and then backed up with data that would support one's answer.  The question in question was "Who would win in a game of H-O-R-S-E between Larry Bird and Jesus?"  I maintain that Larry Bird would beat Jesus like a stolen snare drum.  And I like Jesus.  The way I see it, Jesus is an honorable and unselfish guy and therefore would not use his Son-Of-God-Powers to win a mere game.  He uses his powers to free slaves and feed the hungry.  By that rationale, Larry Bird would have the edge becasue his occupation revolves solely around basketball, whereas Jesus is more of a prophet/savior, not so much with the basketball.  Something to think about anyway.  More questions to ponder:  Who would win a fight between Blade and Angel?  Who would win a hockey game between Wayne Gretzky and Batman vs. Wolverine and Patrick Roy?  Who would win a game of dodge ball between The Justice League and The Authority?  Who would win a chess match between Charles Xavier and Yoda?   Make sure you back up your answer with good reasoning, if you choose to respond.

        Pre-Wrapped Sausages.   I may have messed up the seedings in my NFL predictions.  I have the Chiefs playing the winner of the Tennessee/Baltimore (Tennessee) game when, in fact, the are playing the winner of the Indy/Denver (Indy) game.  This doesn't really change much, as New England will kick some Tennessee ass.  Indy is playing with conviction right now and I'm not sure we can beat them.  But that's neither here nor there.  I have come to you today to talk about the fact that I have ESP.  I am a precog.  I have the ability to see what will happen before it actually does.  This does not apply to gambling or any sports predictions.  The government has strict guidelines that a precog must adhere to unless they want to end up in a brain harvesting lab.  I figured this out the other night when I was scrolling through the channels and I noticed that E! was playing SNL, and I said to myself; "Self, you have to click on that because it's the first one with The Rock."  And sure enough when I hit the info button that sums up the ep. it was in fact the first Rock one.  I was surprised to find that I had predicted the future, but not that surprised because it has happened in the past but I just wrote it off as synchronicity.  Now I am fully aware of my abilities and vow to you and the world that I accept my responsibility and promise to use powers for good.  My first good deed will be telling you that this weeks Pick 3 lotto numbers are  NOT  1-5-8.  As I said before if I gave you the numbers I would have to be killed.  I just upped the odds of you winning though, so do with it what you will.  My fellow precogs would frown on this, but they are a bunch of freaks.  It's not breaking the rules, it's just skirting them.    If you ever have need of my service as a seer, please contact my agent and she will set up an appointment or you can call my emergency hotline and I will get back to you post haste.  Chances are I already know who will need me and I will just call you first.  Do not, however, confuse me with a psychic.  Those fucks are all frauds.

        Fine, Don't Listen To Me.   What do I know?  The answer to that is, of course, "everything".  Dig?  I'm kind of just babbling, but how is that new?  See today was the first day back to work after the holiday/wedding vacation.  Mike and Erin's wedding was the 28th.  It was nice.  I was the whatchacallit... best man.  The other groomsman was a hot chick, I shit you not.  I didn't make a move or anything, because my dad wasn't there and he wouldn't understand if someone told him I went home with a groomsman.  When we were done with the Groom's party's photos Mike and I did a couple for us, we did a back-to-back James Bond kind of thing with guns (not real guns) and a cupid shot, like a fountain or something.  That last one is hard to explain.  Anyway the wedding went relatively smooth with only minor screwups, Mike would never say anything of course but let me tell you, whoever that jackass best man was fucked up the ring part.  Wait that was, uh, yeah.  Nevermind.  Needless to say that guy is a tool.   I have mentioned football in the past as you might have read, likewise, I have discussed my Fanatsy Football team, well, let me bring you up to date.   My fantasy championship was this last weekend and it was between me and my buddy Patrick, he won of course because the Chiefs jumped all over the Bears and A-Train couldn't get the carries he needed for me to win.  It also didn't help that Patrick had LT on his team and he ran for 243 on the damn Raiders, it was ugly.  Regardless I came in second and that's one spot better than my boss (whom I beat to get into the Championship game) so I am satisfied.  I feel bad for No-Feet though, working his way into the Number one spot right before the last week of the season and then pissing it all away in the playoffs.  Way to go, buddy.   Speaking of the Chiefs - way to go KC getting the number 2 seed in the AFC, not that it will matter, it looks as though we will have to play either Baltimore or Tennessee (probably Baltimore) and either one of those team will kill us.  Baltmore is the best rushing team in the league and we have the worst or second worst run defense in the league, not a pretty picture.  However, the Pats will have to face Denver or Indy (probably Denver) and they will kick the shit out of either of those teams and then proceed to kick the shit out of whoever is next and then kick the shit out of whoever they play in the Superbowl.  Can you guess who my pick is?  No?  What's that?  You want me to break down my playoff picks for you?  Well, alrighty then.   Week 18 - Wildcard Weekend!!!  Woot!!   AFC:  Tennessee @ Baltimore - winner: Baltimore  Denver @ Indianapolis - winner: Denver   NFC:  Dallas @ Carolina - winner: Carolina  Seattle @ Green Bay - winner: Green Bay   Week 19 - Divisonal Weekend   AFC:  Denver @ New England - winner: New England  Baltimore @ Kansas City - winner: Baltimore   NFC:  Carolina @ St. Louis - winner: Carolina  Green Bay @ Philadelphia - winner: Green Bay   Week 20 - Confrence Championships   AFC:  Baltimore @ New England - winner: New England   NFC:  Green Bay @ Carolina - winner: (this one's tough) Green Bay (Brett has got that look in his eyes, the Patriots remeber it from SB XXXI)   Week 21 - Super Bowl XXXVIII   Green Bay @ New England (in Houston) - winner: (not this time Brett) New England   This is complete lunacy.  How many people besides me think that the Pack will be in the SB this year?  Well, there is the state of Wisconsin and the good people in the Packers franchise and Mike Chacey and Me.  that makes less than a couple million or roughly 5%.  I just think that Brett Favre can get it done, he dropped 399 yards and 4 TD's a day after his dad died and then just fucking spanked Denver the next week.  Everyone in the NFC should be furious with Minnesota for not beating Arizona in week 17 to win the Division and not letting GB get into the playoffs.  Because, let me tell you, Green Bay is fucking dangerous right now.   Peace.

        It's Breezy In Here, Just Like Marvin Gaye's Head.   You know, cause he got his shit blown out by his dad, or something.  I wonder how much shit I'd have to give my dad until he reached the point where he wanted to shoot me.  I bet I could drive him to do it within a week.  "Chuck, I can drive that man crazy in 5 days."  "Drive that man crazy!" (like name that tune, for you gifted students out there)  If I had a time machine I would go back in time and find the guy that invented conference calls and fucking torture him to death.  Also, the guy who invented work.  And that goddamn snake in the Garden of Eden.  Then we could sit around naked, not working, and drink beer all day.  Good times.  Of course our feet would look pretty calloused, but I think it's a fair shake.  I'm glad we don't have to deal with the vengeful God of old.  Locusts, frogs, first born son, all that shit.  Now all we get is cancer which we can eridicate through the cunning use of science.  We don't really have any epidemics that aren't medical in nature anymore.  I guess there was the Grasshopper Invasion of 1867, but even that was contained to the midwest.  I don't know why, really, I bring it up.  It's not like I long for a plague or anything.  I have to assume that society, now, is way more lewd and licentious than it ever could be in that day and age, so why do they get the plagues and tribulations and all we get is a chiding from the occasional religious zealot.  If you believe that there is a God, do you think he has given up on us?  Does he not care enough to wreak his vengenance upon us?  Can a deity really be that dispassionate?  Some people would argue that we have free will and God wants us to make mistakes so that we may learn from them, but it strikes me that certain cities in the bible were destroyed for incidents that dwindle in comparison to some of the shit we do now.  Or was all that just a metaphor?  If not, we certainly haven't learned from our mistakes and, indeed, have made much bigger and more horrifyingly disastrous ones.  And that strikes me as a good reason, if there is a God, why he would give up on us.  If that be the case, then we are certainly doomed.  Sorry for the theological rant.  Not really sure where that came from.  Also, I didn't mean to come off so preachy.  I don't really give a shit one way or the other, it just struck me as odd is all.  You believe what you want and I'll make fun of you.  I promise no more religous rants until the ruinous destruction of condemnation takes us.  Sleep well.

        So, I Saw A Dead Guy Today.   For real.  I had to take a delivery to a certain mortuary today, which is not unusual.  There was a family there doing the whole prefuneral thing, I didn't see them but the lady I went to see wasn't available because she was with that family, no big deal.  I gave the delivery to someone else and split.  On my way out I glanced to my right and there was a fucking dead guy in a coffin.  You'd think they would, oh I don't know, close the fucking door.  I don't like dead people.  I didn't look at my grandma at her funeral, nor did I look at my aunt.  I don't feel the need to look at dead people for any reason, I don't know why people do.  It must be a sense of closure or something.  The whole thing freaked me out, how can you prepare for something like that?  You don't go out to your car anticipating the viewing of a dead person.  I'm not scarred or anything, but it still wasn't cool.  At least I didn't kill any of my friends in my dreams.

        A Little Cilantro For Your Liver.   Today was fucked.  I don't even want to talk about it.   OK, fine.   Jeez, you're so pushy sometimes.  Well, it started out with this dream I had, it bothered me all morning.  I dreamed I fucking snapped at work, and tied up three people, one of whom was my good friend Adam.  I had a gun and was threatening to off them, and somebody called me on it, like I didn't have the stones to do it, so I kicked over the chairs they were sitting on and but a bullet in each of their heads.  Sick, I know.  The worst part was I killed a good friend of mine.  What the shit is that all about.  Anyway the dream continued.  I was being all crazy and shouting and whatnot, when my other good friend Grant shows up and talks me down, I give him a hug and a gun, and when the police try to arrest me, a court appointed psychotherapist shows up and instead of locking me up they put me in her custody and she makes me better, I never even spent the night in jail.  It was completely fucked up.  I ahev no idea where it came from.  And why Adam?  I mean why not like David Duchovny or Judy Dench.  It freaked me out all morning like I said.  I felt that if Adam had showed up at Kinko's I would have been "Dude, you have to get out of here, I might try and kill you in a minute."  I feel better now.  Goddamn, I'm a freak sometimes.  Anyway, couple that dream with an understaffed/overbusy day and my stress level was such that I needed a drink by about 2pm.  I'm just glad it's over.  Now I can watch movies and eat Yelo Sub and mellow the fuck out.  So that's what I'm gonna go do.  Peace.   ps - Sorry I killed you in my dream Adam.  If it makes you feel any better, after I spent some time with the shrink I felt really bad about it.  Like, really really bad.

        Messenger Pigeons To Congress: "We Have A Message."   See, because they're fucking  messenger  pigeons.  It's what they do.  It's in their title for God's sake.  I wanted to come out today and take a moment to do a little crazy talk.  You know, nothing serious just some simple incoherent babbling.  Think that would be ok?  Alright, here goes.  Today at the circus we melted down a bronze statue of Gerhardt The Amazing.  He was our former lead trapeze artist, but his wife left him and he hasn't had the courage to step back up there yet, but that's beside the point.  The thing is we melted down this statue because Marcus,one of the clowns,had this idea that we could use the molten bronze as a sort of initiation for the new circus employees, we would tell them that we have to make a bronze cast of their foot, or something.  Well obviously we wouldn't do that cause molten bronze is like 150 degrees or something crazy like that, it would just be a joke to freak them out.  So later when the police showed up we explained that Carlos had tripped and that's why his head was melted.  Obviously Marcus could back the story up since it was him what made it up.  Don't tell nobody but we pushed his dang head in there cause he keeps eating all the s'mores at dinner time.  Fucking s'more stealer.  Serves his melted ass right.  Later the cops kept riding us about why we had a busket of molten bronze and we had told them that it was for one of the acts, but I don't think they was buying it.  So later when we were in Mexico, the federales said they had to extradite us, or something, becuase murdering cops is apparently really bad.  Who knew?   This whole thing is Marcus' fault anyway, goddamn midget.  Once we clean these mexicans's blood off our shoes 'n socks we can get the hell outta here.  Anyway, what I'm trying to tell you is that circus life is really excitin', so if you are looking for a new career path, look to the circus.  Murder doesn'ty happen all the time, it was just this once.  Well, three times.  And that one time last year.  Okay two times, but that's it.  Well, that and the one time in 1998.  So only the six times, and that's over a period of 7 years, that's not even two a year.  I nev'r was too good at the uhrith-matic.  okay I'm done now.

        There's No 'I' In Asshole.   What's up hoi polloi.  Not much on the Nick front today.  Just a couple of kwik remynderz.  (I have no idea why I did that)    1: When you're using a chainsaw to curtail the size of a corpse, always remember to wear the proper eye protection.  2: Sometimes, when you are baking delicious panettoni in your patisserie, you have to kill your assisstant for putting the candied fruit peels on the cake  before  the raisins, God Dammit!  I mean,  come on !  It's not that fucking hard, you ass.  We are making dainty treats, it's not fucking rocket surgery!  Jesus Christ!    sorry...  That guy, I mean sheesh, what a fucking tool.   WOTD:  tractable \TRAK-tuh-buhl\, adjective:  1. Capable of being easily led, taught, or managed; docile.  2. Easily handled, managed, or worked; malleable.

        Steve (OtNH)   That one is special, for Billy and Adam only.  So there was a veritable alluvion of Limericks sent to The Nick.  And trust me when I say that by "veritable alluvion" what I mean is "zero".  Apparently limericks aren't your "thing", I guess your "thing" is sucking dicks.  Anyway, I had limericks on the brain, and wanted to get rid of them.  It's the only form of poetry that I can really respect, beacuse I learned about the form in question via a filthy one.  Poetry, limericks notwithstanding, is really really...  what's the right word...  gay.  Yes, that's it, and I don't mean happy.  I would apologize if that offends you but I don't feel like starting any trends right now.  I feel, and, in fact, have always felt, that poetry is a ridiculous way to express oneself.  Writing to express yourself is great, as long as your not doing it in iambic pentameter, elegiac couplets, anapestic measure or any other silly grouping of syllables.  The only, and I mean ONLY, poetry that can be deemed acceptable is as follows:  Anything by William Shakespeare, Geoffrey Chaucer, Shel Siverstein or Dr. Seuss.  Anything that is vulgar, boorish, cheap, coarse, common, contemptible, crude, dirty, disgusting, dishonorable, filthy, fractious, gross, hard core, ignoble, impolite, improper, indecent, indecorous, indelicate, inferior, low, malicious, nasty, naughty, obscene, odious, off-color, profane, raw, repulsive, ribald, risqué, rough, rude, scatological, slippery, smutty, soft core, sordid, suggestive, tasteless, tawdry, uncouth, unmannerly, unrefined or villainous in nature.  And finally, If this is your first night in fight club you have to, erm... sorry that's something else.  Poetry Smokes Pole!

        Limericks.   I feel like writing some limericks.  Observe:  There once was a bloke name of Chacey. His underwear preference, lacy. The friends they poked fun, made many a pun, and then started calling him Stacy.  See, how I did that.  I made fun of Mike by implying that he likes to wear girls panties.  This is fun, huh?  Now what...  hmm... How about this:  I told my friend that I got to shag with some chicky who wasn't a hag he called me "liar". my anger was dire, I said "fuck you, you stupid douchebag."  Story of my life....  *sigh*  I think I'll keep this up through next week.  If you have one send it in and I'll post it.  Make fun of me or your mom it doesn't matter!  There once was a man from Nantuckett,  but the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.

        Your Ad Here!   Man alive.  8am conference calls suck dick.  And not just any dick, no.  They suck Hitler's dick.  I used the word "dick" in four consecutive sentences, including this one.  Go Me!  It reminds me of this scene in the movie The Battle of Shaker Heights, the main character, Kelly, is getting bullied by this other guy and they have a confrontation.  The bully grabs Kelly and says "Hey, dickface, don't dick with me, you got it, dick?" (or something like that, it's been a while since I've seen it.)  And Kelly responds by saying "Hey, you just used the word dick as a noun, adjective, and verb in the same sentence."  Then he gets beat up.  It was still pretty funny.  I wish I had the ability to look danger in the face and be glib.  One of the reasons I'm still alive is probably because I cannot do that very thing.  So now, including this, I've used the word "dick" a total of nine (9) times.  A new personal best.    Kansas City is looking to trade Larry Johnson, which pleases me to no end.  We have The Priest, what on earth do we need a mediocre RB for?  I love the offseason.  Trades and movement in the draft.  We are looking at Drew Henson, too.  As a back up and student for Trent Green.  You may or may not know who Drew Henson is, either way I'm going to talk about him for a moment.  Three years ago Drew was one of the top QB prospects coming out of college, Michigan to be exact, and he decided to play baseball instead.  The Houston Texans still claimed the rights to Henson, if ever he should come back to football. After three years with the Yankees Texas League team, he has decided to come back to football.  There are pros and cons to this, he has been out of football for three years, but his maturity level is way up, and it's not like he's been sitting on his ass getting fat, he's been playing baseball for three years, and while baseball isn't exactly the place to look for physical perfection, they still aren't a bunch of slouches.  I think Henson would be an awesome backup for Trent Green, he's the same kind of QB.  He's smart, and can read defenses very well and he probably has a better arm than Trent.  Under Dick (10!) Vermeil's tutelage he could blossom into a fine QB.  Do I think we'll get him?  No.  He's probably going to go to Pittsburgh.  But a backup QB is the least of our problems right now anyway, we need Corners, D-Ends and Linebackers.  A really tall and quick Wideout would be nice too.  And a young Kicker.  You know, to take over for Morton Andersen when he turns 70 and retires.  eh.

        Even My Good Guys Are Assholes.   Naturally, I am referring to Knights of the Old Republic.  I am running throught the game a second time and I was going through it as a good guy, vis-a-vis the light side of the force.  The operative word in that last sentence is "was".  See, I was almost completely light, that is to say the meter that measures how much of the force, whether it's light or dark, was almost completely filled on the light side of the force.  That was after playing the game for 29 hours.  In the next four hours of game play, I garnered enough dark side points to put me in the dead middle of the spectrum, which is where you begin the game.  I have about 3 hours left of the game and there is no way I can get back to where I was.  Apparently I make very poor decisions.  Anyway, it doesn't matter, I have chosen the light path and that's where I will finish the game.  You can be as dark as it gets and still get the light side ending, if you make the right (or wrong, depending) decision.  The only downside to it is, I was wearing these bad ass Jedi robes that were for Light Side users only, and then all of a sudden, "wham", you kill some guys who were talking shit on you and your party and you can't wear them any more.  Fucking judgemental Force.  I'll show it who's boss.    On a different note:  If you have not been or never have watched the show Smallville, then you are a despicable person with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  I hate you and so do all your friends, and we all wish you were dead.  The show has gotten exponentially better form day one.  We are at a point now, where Clark (aka SUPERMAN) now has X-Ray Vision, Super Hearing, Invulnerability, Super Speed and Heat Vision.  All we are lacking is Cold Breath and Flight.  We will probably never see Clark with Flight through the course of the show, but Frost Breath is another story all together.  In the last couple of weeks he finally got his glasses, so now he is starting to look the part of naive Clark Kent.  Christopher Reeve is going to be on the show again, April 14th I think, to reprise his role as Dr. Swann, the only one outside of Pete Ross and Ma and Pa Kent who know who Clark really is.  The first time he was on, he told Clark where he was from, Krypton, and what had happened to it.  At one point, the original Superman music from the movies started to play when they were both in frame and I, literally, got goosebumps, it was that awesome.  It was also the highest rated ep of the show, and probably top five in the history of all WB programming.  I suggest that you tune in to see the next one.  Actually, I demand that you do.  You hear me?  I am demanding something from my vast (6 people) readership.  Good Day.  I said good day!

        Home Again, Home Again, Jiggity Jog   I've missed you, fairweather blog readers!  I have been not blogging lately, for a number of reasons.  The number is 2.  One: I was really pissed at my bank for a while and that anger manifested itself into depression, and when I'm depressed, well, I don't do shit.  I eat and play videogames and drink.  I certainly don't blog.  But I feel better now.  Two: I didn't really have anything to say.  Not that I do now, it's just that now I feel like rambling.  So listen, old bean, if you don't like it then you can get tossed.  I have taken up the mantle of the Jedi once again, I am working on finishing KOTOR on the light side although that is proving to be quite troublesome.  I keep getting these DSP for no reason.  If somebody walks up to me and starts talking shit on the jedi or one of my homies, of course they're going to get killed but that's no reason to start throwing around dark side points as if they're going out of style.  My light side meter was almost completely filled and then you go to Korriban and join the sith betray your teacher and kill a few students and your light side rating is just shot to hell.  What kind of sense does that make.  I'm almost dead middle now.  I can't wear things restricted to DS only or LS only.  What a bunch of bullwinkle.  At least my golf game doesn't judge me based on poor decisions.  Although, that would be kind of neat.  If you were like an asshole golfer people would try to beat you up behind the clubhouse and you could take your lob wedge to their face, or you could sabotage other golfer's swings with a fog horn or some such.  Put guns in it and maybe some whores and you got yourself another million selling game from Rockstar.  They would call it, Golf: The Reckoning or some bullwinkle like that.  Also, lately I have been substituting the world bullwinkle for the word bullshit.  Trying to curb my language for work or some shit.  What-the-fuck-ever.  By the by - you should click on stewie, I left you a surprise.

        Nick: Post Ass Fucking.   That may look like a strange headline, but wait till you here the story of how I got ass fucked to begin with.  Before I start, I would like to take this opportunity to address a couple quick things, I realize that what happens in this story is  probably  my fault, but I 'd like to believe in a world where corporations don't take every single opportunity to sexually assault their customers and rape the faith that they (the cusotmers) have in them (the corporation).  I am overdrawn at my bank right now.  I had 11 transactions that did not clear.  I had 162.00 in my account.  That money was sufficient to cover all those transactions save one, a 227.00 purchase.  So which one does the bank push through first?  The big one.  Instead of incurring one 28.00 dollar service fee for one overdraft, I have incurred 11.  I went to speak with the "Customer Service" representative from the Local  BANK OF AMERICA  and they said it was becasue "...big purchases are probably more important, so we do those first."  There is no logic in this statement.  Just becasue a purchase is large, does not mean it is important.  The important thing to them is this, instead of making 28.00 dollars off of me, they are going to get 308.00 becasue of the order they put my transactions through.  They could have made my day by helping me out, instead they chose to fuck me hard right in my ass.  I will be closing my account at  BANK OF AMERICA  as soon as this debacle is taken care of.  I would  never  push my opinion off on other people, but I suggest that if you bank with  BANK OF  (fucking)  AMERICA  (in it's ass) that you consider moving your funds to another financial institute, perhaps one that doesn't hold their customers down and stick splintered broom handles into their rectums.  I reiterate: This was  mostly  my fault, but they could have made it a lot less painful.  They had the power to do it, and they didn't.  That is not corporate responsibility, and I am fucking furious.    Also: The 227.00 purchase was from CRANDON AND CRANDON optometrists, here in Lawrence, and the purchase did not clear my bank for SIX (6) days.  I paid with my check card, for God's sake.  I partly blame the technology and partly blame CRANDON AND CRANDON, for their idiocy.  The whole thing has made me sick to my stomach, and I intend to go throw up.  Right on  BANK OF AMERICA'S  door.  GODDAMMIT!

        See, This Is Why I Don't Gamble...   The spread on the SB was 7.  Pats by seven.  I said they were going to win by 14.  Not only did they not win by 14, they didn't even cover the spread.  There are thousands of people who lost their asses on that game, because the fearsome Pat's D was nowhere to be found yesterday.  At one point in time yesterday Jake Delhomme had thrown for 309 yards on 14 completions.  That's fucking ridiculous, my video game stats aren't even on par with that.  I feel for those persons who lost their gambling addicted asses, I really do.  On a lighter note, halftime was pretty sweet.  Well...the last 10 seconds of halftime.  It's really rather incredible.  However, we need to be more careful as a society or there will be no more live TV.  Everything will be pre-recorded and screened for content and it will be really really boring.  Small steps people, small steps.  Anyway, big ups to the Pats.  One is an accident, two is a trend, and three... well, three is a dynasty.  So here's to a third one.

        So... What's Up?   I'm back.  I had to take a short break because for the first time in my life I realized I wanted to kill someone, and I figured, since I love you all so much, it would be best if we didn't see each other for awhile.  Actually there were a couple of DVD box sets that came out that I had to dedicate myself to.  But now that I've watched them I can continue this mind numbingly interesting blog.  When I was a little kid I wanted to be a fireman.  Did you ever want to be a fireman?  Well, it turns out all I wanted to do is spray shit with a hose.  I'm really good at that.  I'm having a hard time deciding who to put up as the new Hero Of The Week.  Nevermind, it just came to me.  See you later.

        Sam Adams vs. John Adams   The smarter of you will have noticed that I changed the name Sam to John in the last post.  This is for various reasons, one being that John was actually what I meant to write and apparently I lost my mind.  Another one would be that Sam Adams was never a president.  A third reason might be that a small cricket named Smithy told me to do it in my sleep.  I can neither confirm nor deny that last one.  It's a good thing I couldn't find any rat poison yesterday, because nothing bad happened despite what me and Dannie thought.  So that was cool.  I am in the midst of watching volume 4 of Mystery Science Theater 3000 right now.  Well, not  right  now, but this week I have been watching it.  I had forgotten the glorious wonders that are Mike Nelson, Crow and Tom Servo.  It's fucking hilarious.  I must acquire the rest of them, also the movie.  (you know, the one where they show "This Island Earth")  It has been great but I've only got one episode left, fortunately Futurama Season 3 comes out the 9th, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  Until next time, enjoy this excerpt from and MC Frontalot song entitled "Special Delivery"           and I wish that I could afford the ear of Bush the second          I'd ask is it your favorite philosopher who recommended          invading and exterminating all who defy us,          crying out justice but seeking out triumphs?          wasn't your christ unbeloved of empires?          one nailed his ass to a post; he expired!          a terrorist, as roman evidence showed           put down like a retard on the death row          in texas, I guess "tough luck," right George?          ain't that how every war gets scored?          big gun wins, winner gets a free turn          enemy after enemy burns           are you listening sir? or did your mind drift          to the next country in your axis          to all the cool bombs drops you get to call          delivery fresh from the 4th reich to y'all

        My Precious Brain.   I have been having excellent conversations as of late.  Seriously, my conversations have been well articulated, funny and relavent.  Mostly.  For example, I was talking to my boss today about how John Kerry was whipping George Bush's ass in the cnn.com poll by a stunning 14% margin.  He is a proud supporter of Bush and I, on the other hand, hate him with the fire of a thousand suns.  I said that there was no way in hell W gets elected again and he maintained that he would, while our coworker Rich interjected this comment "Even if he doesn't win, he'll still be president, just like the last election."  Which was funny, but it led to this exchange:  Dannie: That's the same way John Adams got elected, probably one of the finest Presidents of all time.  Me: You know, sometimes, I like to make things up and say them too.  Dannie: I'm serious.  Me: What do you know about John Adams?  Dannie: Quite a bit.  Me: You don't know a fucking thing.  Dannie: I mean, I never met the guy or anything, but... blah blah blah.  As a side not, he didn't actually say "blah blah blah" but I kind of tuned him out at that point in time. See, that was an excellent conversation.  And just moments ago I exchanged emails with my good friend Bryan Jones.  In the midst of casual name calling we had this to say to each other:  Bryan: Eat a bag of dicks, your blog is gayer than an ass full of hotdogs. *insert of tasteless remarks since I dont have any cool points* *gently crying*   B-Dubb from the P.G. County G's Represent, what!  Me: The rules clearly state that out of town friends are not eligible.  I wish I could add you but, you know, I didn't write the rules.  I assume you are gently crying because Adrock turned down your request for a date again.  I guess he's too busy accepting semen deposits on his tonsils to talk to you.  That's gotta be tough man, you're a real trooper to keep trying like that.  D-County Pimps Up, Hoes, er, I mean PG County G's down!   N wut, wut!  As you can see, things are picking up on the intellectual front for me.  Anyway, my DM is coming to our store to have a "talk" with me and Dannie tomorrow, so I have to go find some rat poison to ingest.  Good Day.    The Yellow Dart Has Spoken

        Spot Off In That Light.   Billy has regained the lead in the cool points poll with his correct (and prompt) answer to yesterday's question.  The answer was Klingon.  If any of you speak Klingon and would like to apply for the scholarship in question, go  urlLink here.   Fucking nerds.  I know what you are thinking.  You are thinking that me calling people who speak Klingon nerds is akin to the fabled pot addressing the neighborhood kettle as black.  "What right do you have, Nick, to judge people when you yourself play DnD?"  And the answer is simple my lovely made up person - I have every right.  I don't make fun of people depsite the fact that it's wrong, I make fun of people  because  it's wrong.  When I make fun, nothing is safe, no one is off-limits and I'll be damned if I'm going to let a little crying deter me.  That said, I will never make fun of someone's dead pet.  It's not a moral or ethical question, I've just seen Pet Cemetary one too many times.  You'd be wise to follow suit, but if you like being mauled to death by and undead ferret then, by all means, make fun.  Me?   urlLink I loathe the undead.    WOTD:  qua \KWAY; KWAH\, preposition:  In the capacity or character of; as.    The Yellow Dart Has Spoken.   **UPDATE**  Possibly the best thing ever...  from The Sports Guy over at ESPN.com (He's brilliant.  Just brilliant.)   "..Finally, if Magic Johnson's Basketball Hall of Fame induction doesn't include a sequence where presenter Larry Bird comes out wearing a Lakers jersey, gives a heartfelt speech about Magic, finishes, shakes Magic's hand, steps backward to let Magic bathe in the applause of the crowd, then inexplicably hits Magic over the head with a steel chair as Ernie Johnson Jr. screams, "My God, Noooooooooooo!," followed by Bird ripping the Lakers jersey off (revealing a Celtics jersey), then kicking Magic a few times before exiting the stage to raucous applause ... well, I'm not going."

        Knock It Up A Notch.   As far as the cool points poll is concerned, the only person to closely identify last weeks question was not eligible for the list, although he is quite cool.  So here is this week's question:  You can recieve a scholaship for knowing what made up language?  This question is worth three (3) cool points.  I haven't seen any dead bodies this week, but it's only Monday so we won't count out the possibility just yet.  The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King sweeps at the Oscars.  11 noms, 11 wins.  Way to go Peter Jackson and Co.  Nobody has swept since 1988 (The Last Emperor) and before that it was 1958 (Gigi).  They also tied an Academy Award record with 11 statues.  In 1997 Titanic won 11 and in 1958 Ben-Hur won 11.  I'm glad that fantasy can finally be seen as a viable genre now.  I know that the three films combined to make over 2.5 billion (worldwide) at the box office, and probably several hundred million more in DVD sales - but nobody really wants to take the chance and spend 100 mill making the movie right in fear that they won't make their money back.  Now that this movie kicked ass and took names at the Oscars, I feel that we'll continue to see the fantasy genre flourish, at least that's my hope.  I love me some wizards and dragons and fucking swords and shit.  Now that we have that out of the way let me move onto the reason I'm pissed at the Motion Picture Academy.  Sean Penn wins best actor?!  Who was smoking what when they doled out that special little piece of torture upon america?  I don't want anyone to think I'm biased here, but how in the fuck do you not only pass up Johnny Depp, but also Bill Murray?  I wonder if they even watched these fucking movies?  Johnny Depp may have given the single best performance ever as Captain Jack Sparrow, and if were giving out sympathy-been-shunned-one-too-many-times Oscars (in the case of Penn) then why not give it to Bill Murray?  His body of work is far superior to Sean Penn's.  I blame fucking Russell Crowe for the whole goddamn thing.  Sean Penn should have won it for I Am Sam, but they had to give it to Crowe for Gladiator, which was a fine picture to be sure, but did you see I Am Sam?  Penn was brilliant.  All Crowe did was bring a strong presence to an otherwise prosaic role.  If Penn had won like he was supposed to, then you can bet your ass Johnny Depp or Bill Murray wins last night.  While we are on the subject, there is no way that Charlize Theron was better in Monster than Naomi Watts was in 21 Grams.  No. Fucking. Way.  And I like Charlize.  But Naomi was off the fucking chart.  And she gets robbed like a Times Square hooker.  Oh well, at least that's not as depressing as Bill and Johnny getting robbed.  That was a crime.  A crime, I tell you!  But I digress.   The Yellow Dart has spoken.  "I'll read you poetry, I'll tell you what I know to be true // I'll make a sentimental observation 'bout the moon // I'll kiss you so that you can think that kisses are sublime //  But I won't spend a penny, cause all that your worth is my time."

        I Guess I Shouldn't Be Surprised.   I have been roaming the internet for the last three days and I have found some fucked up shit.  Not dirty, disgusting shit (although, there is plenty of that too) but things like, a gay man's tribute to knitting, or a website devoted to the glory of shoe horns.  It's strangely disturbing and yet somewhat satisfying to know that if I should ever require knowledge about the mating rituals of ancient inca tribes, it's only a click away.  If I was a teacher, I would assign reports on very strange things, just to see if my kids could successfully trek their way through the mire that is the internet and come up aces.  It takes some skill to use the internet properly.  Any meathead can use the internet to buy stocks, find pictures of naked people, read comics or read reviews of video games.  I'm talking about navigating through webrings and bypassing sleeze to get to the only website about making yo-yo's out of pig intestines.  That takes cunning.  With all that tasty information out there I still use the internet for three things: email, webcomics and this here.  Sure, sometimes, I like to check baseball scores or read about DnD books, but that's only like a couple times a month.  I still get all my sports info from ESPN the tv station and my DnD information usually comes from Adam or Billy.  As great as the interent is, I couldn't imagine obtaining  all  my information from it.  Books are still pretty cool and TV is a great for rotting the brain, also I like to have friends.  I got to meet Scott Kurtz, of  urlLink PvP , on Saturday.  It was cool, him and Aaron Williams, of  urlLink Nodwick  and  urlLink PS238  were at Pop Culture Comics is OP, I chatted with them and got Scott to sign a copy of Striptease (a book collecting his webcomic) and he drew me a sketch as well.  Nice guy.  If I'm ever that fat I need someone to come over and tie me up and break my jaw so I stop eating.  Nice guy, though.  This concludes your lesson for today.  I'll expect your report about Nigerian fire breathing garden gnomes on my desk tomorrow morning.  Dismissed.

        So,  That  Was Dumb.     I was off yesterday and I meant to update but I fucking forgot.  Sorry.  Anyway I'm glad I waited.  A couple of posts ago I was ranting about a world without a Joss Whedon TV show and though I still think the world would be a better place if there was one on, his new X-Men title will suffice.  I read Astonishing X-Men #1 today written by Joss and drawn By Cassaday (his Cap stuff was off the hook) and it was fucking great.  The last page (or last couple) is easily the best.  If you haven't read it, you should.  It's fucking great.  Wolverine and Scott have a big throw down over Jean, and in the end they form a new X Team, hence the name.  Just great.  You should read it is what I'm saying  I would further like to add that Aaron Sorkin is a king among men.  Sports Night is one of the finest shows ever, it is unfortunate, to say the least, that it didn't make it.  I bring this up because (Mike, you can just shut the fuck up) I watched half of the second season of the West Wing the other day and I loved the shit out of it.  It reminded me why I liked Sports Night so much, moreover it reminded me why I like Aaron Sorkin so much.  His writing is like Kevin Smith's but more intelligent and without all the "fucks".  I couldn't believe that something that I have avoided and am really not interested in could draw me in so quickly.  After I watched it, I went home and put the entire first and second season in my Netflix queue.  I have the first four seasons of The Sopranos and the first two seasons of Six Feet Under in the que and I moved The West Wing ahead of all of them. (except for the ones I've already seen)  Anyway, now I'm going to have to put up with Mike's constant barrage of "I Told You So's"  I should have just listened to him.  Actually, now that I think about it, if I had started listening to Mike at age 16 I would probably be a better citizen now.  See, Mike doesn't just act like he knows everything, he  actually  does know everything.  I don't know why I'm picking on Mike all the sudden.    Anyway - Laters.

        Mortals Make Me Laugh   What is the happenings?  I took off on Friday for Wichita and ended up spending the weekend there.  It was a lot of fun, I got to see pretty much everybody I know, all my old homies from Kinko's, Grant and my family.  It was good times.  Grant and I had a 3 hour  NHL Rivals  war on Sunday, I got my ass kicked.  In my defense I had never played that game before.  But when we put in  Links  it was I who did the ass kicking.  This Saturday I'm going to OP to meet Scott Kurtz creator of  urlLink PvP .  I'm really excited about it.  It seems that Scott and I have a lot in common.  We're both big fat guys who like trolls and...  ok I guess we just have those two things in common but those are pretty significant things.  I mean, c'mon, trolls people.  Trolls.  Anyway, Gin's coming up too, and we're going to make a day out of it.  You should come too.  Scott needs a reason to come back to KC.  We should come out in force and demand that he come more often or we'll... we'll do something crazy, man!  If you want to come, go to his website and you can get the name of the comic store he'll be at and directions, or I suppose you can ride with us.  Mike if you're reading this, I expect you to be there.  Boards or no boards!  Med skool can wait.    You know how McDonald's is giving out those stepometers now?  I think I need one so I can modify it to measure how many times a day I say the word fuck.  A fuckometer.  That would sell.  Oh yeah baby, I could sell the fuck out of those.

        Count Donkula From Punchstonia   Sorry no post yesterday, but it was like my Tisha B'Av.  Angel came to a close as well as Smallville, and I almost died.  I know I say I almost died a lot, but this time I really almost died.  This time I mean it, I could've been injured badly if not for my cat like reflexes and my brobdignagian mental capacity.  I was scared I might limp away from this one.  It was bad.  Sorta.  At the very least it was scary.  I was embarking upon the trecherous journey from my humble abode to Lord McDonald's castle, when, betwixt the Haskell and Harper passes, a mechanical chariot arose on my tail end with a furious speed, I was sure the beast would collide with my own chariot but I sped up at the last second and he began to slow down.  Then he caromed off the side of the bridge and began to swerve wildly, I though for sure the Devil had possessed this once tame fellow.  I sped the fuck up and and cut some dude off so he would be between me and crazy.  It was fucking scary.  Anyway, it was probably just Jared Fire, all drunk again.  Angel ending bothers me more than Buffy or Firefly ending.  It was a better show and I was more invested in it, but moreover it was the last Joss Whedon show on TV.  I can't imagine a new season of TV later this year with no Whedon enterprise.  It's not healthy and it's not right.  Firefly got the worst of all the shows, it had the potential to be better than Buffy or Angel and it got canned after a season, whereas, Angel at least had the benefit of 5 seasons to develop.  I don't claim to know how Hollywood works, but I can tell you I will never respect them.  Grant and I have been working on a script for 5 years, it's mostly a pipedream, but if it ever sells I will never again stop washing my hands or begging the Lord's forgiveness.  This season of Smallville kicked the other two season's asses.  They moved away from the freak-of-the-week method and had continual plot lines throughout the season.  The season finale was, I think, the best of the three season finales.  It was very similar to the ending of Angel Season 3, (the one where Cordelia gets called up to heaven, Angel gets sent to the bottom of the ocean in a steel box, Lorne heads to Vegas, Wesley is in exile and the only people left to hold the fort are Gunn and Winifred) in that Lana goes to Paris, Pete heads to Wichita (aww yeah...) with his Mom, Lionel is in Prison, Lex and Clark are done being friends, Mr. Kent might be dead, Chloe and her Dad are most likely dead, Clark goes into space (maybe - I'm not really clear on this) and Martha Kent is the only one left.  I love those season finales where it ends and you go "What The Fuck!?  How are they going to recover from this chain of events?"  or, you know, something like that.  It makes the wait until the next season more excrutiating.  Anyway I have some Soprano's Season 2 and Six Feet Under Season 1 to watch, so, peace.  I like TV, what?  Fucking facists!

        If It's Going To Be That Kind Of Party...    ..then I'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes.  In this case, "mashed potatoes" is Jared Fire's nickname.  I just watched the movie "Miracle" about the 1980 United States hockey team, and it was  awesome.   I've always had a soft spot for sports movies.  They are always fun to watch and you go home feeling better about yourself, life and in a world with "me, me, me" athletes you leave feeling better about your favorite sports, too.  There is absolutley no negative side to sports movies, even the really bad ones are fun to watch because, at the very least, you get to see underdogs win or a hot shot arrogant young coach (or player) get their comeuppance by the seasoned vet.  And those are things that people like to see.  (As a side note, Mystery Alaska is one of my very favorite sports movies because the underdogs  don't  win and the big shot New York Rangers still give them their propers for playing like studs.)  Raging Bull is the exception here, there is nothing feel-good or formulaic about it.  I think what it all comes down to is the perserverence aspect of these movies.  Nobody would go see a movie about a really shitty baseball team that gives up and loses 115 games and then one of the players gets cancer and dies or some shit.  It's about overcoming adversity, playing through pain (physical and emotional) and winning or, at least, giving it your very best shot.  People pay to see that because they themselves are unable to do those things.  I'm no exception.  If a coach was riding me real hard or working the team until we collapsed, I'd fucking leave.  "See you guys later, I'm gonna get a hooker to suck me off while I watch bowling on TV.  Peace."  And as I walked out the door with my middle finger in the air, I would take solace in the fact that I just undermined everything the coach was trying to accomplish and broke the entire team's spirit.  That's the kind of guy I am and have always been, I can admit it with very little shame.  Nobody  wants  to be that kind of person, unfortunately, a lot of people are born that way and they find tiny scraps of inner peace by living vicariously through fictional sports heroes. (or it can be any type of movie hero fiting the archetype that I've laid out)  That's the whole goddamn reason films are so popular, so people can escape real life or relive simpler times.  Maybe I'm being too pretentiously callous about the whole thing.   The point is, I really like sports movies.  And to allow you to get a feel for my personality, I submit my top ten favorite sports movies of all time.  10. Baseketball 09. Rocky 08. The Replacements 07. The Longest Yard 06. Major League 05. Bull Durham 04. Any Given Sunday 03. Hoosiers 02. Mystery Alaska 01. Caddyshack  So there you go.  Underdogs triumph, sports teams are revitalized and Chevy Chase throws tequila over his shoulder.  What else could you possibly want?   WOTD: redoubtable \rih-DOW-tuh-buhl\, adjective:  1. Arousing fear or alarm; formidable.  2. Illustrious; eminent; worthy of respect or honor.

        +3 Unholy Blog of Spirit Crushing    That was a DnD joke.  If you didn't get it you are a nerd.  *sigh*  I know, I know...  Today at work, I was helping this couple and I gave them our email address so they could send me a file to print, and as I was jotting down the info I wrote down this "Attn: Nick" but I forgot what I was doing right in the middle of writing and I involuntarily looked at my own nametag and then wrote my name down.  The lady said "you're name is Nick", not in an inquisitive sort of tone but one that implied that I was a fucking retard, to which I replied "Yes, I remember now", failing to assuage her fears that I had, in fact, forgotten my name.  She then walked off with a look on her face that could only indicate that she had, at that very moment, lost all faith in mankind.  I was sure that my actions had vanquished her spirit, like some sort of post-apocolyptic spirit triturating machine devised by our Alien Masters to keep us from rebelling.  I felt like an idiot at the time, but now I think it's hilarious.  What does it say about me that I don't have the focus or aptitude to, simultaneously, remember and write down my own name, the very same name that I have been using for the better part 25 years.  From that moment I stopped being "Nick the order taker" to her and forever became "That guy that forgot his own name."  You don't forget that guy.  Not ever.  It's a shame, really.  I always knew I would gain infamy, but I expected it to be for something like eating a really big steak (like in The Great Outdoors) or perhaps even creating the world's biggest mashed potato sculpture of George Washinton Carver, definitely something having to do with food, but not forgetting my own name in public.  I fear that I will eventually grow to rue this day.  At least I can cross that off of my "to do before I die" list.

        Hello Little Man...    Welcome to a special Saturday edition of The Sac.  It's a pleasure to have you.  Wait, did I say 'pleasure',  I meant to say 'an abomination against nature'.  My bad.  Well, since I'm rolling on 3.5 hours of sleep and I'm so funny I thought I would combine my hilarity and my sleep deprivation and issue forth unto you the following nuggets and/or ingots, if they so shall be called.  Sometimes I like to make sentences way longer than they should be.  See, I could've said "I got 3.5 hours of sleep last night and I'm funny, so here you go..."  But no.  I took what should have been a sentence of no more than 15 words and ejaculated a 41 word lingual atrocity on to the screen.  I just did it again.  I like to usher my readers away from the safety of good grammar and proper sentence structure like a lexical ignis fatuus.  But that's neither here nor there.  The point is you shouldn't listen to pans and you shouldn't listen to british people.  Once upon a time this post had a purpose, an intendment, if you will, but I've disremembered it.  Nothing left to say but goodbye, I fear.    You read it, you can't unread it.

        That's No Duck...    *drum solo*  dungudadungudadungadubachingbachingbradumpbradamp... *chimes*   AWOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  THANK YOU, NEW LONDONDERRY, VERMONT!!!  YOU ROCK!!!!      Hi, I'm TV's Nick Seaman, and I'm here to talk to you about Nad Sweat, The Silent Killer.  You work all day, you go to the gym, and generally lead an active life and your nuts are going to sweat, it's a part of life.  But that sweat, left unchecked, can lead to a horrible and grusome death.  Okay, okay, fine... It won't kill you but, God-Damnit, you should wash your nuts, if not for you then do it for the woman who loves you and your cock.  I'm Nick Seaman, for the National Ball Washers Association, and this has been a Public Service Announcment.  I know what your thinking, "Nick has never been on TV...  WTF!?"  But it's like my dad always used to tell me; you can't kick a field goal tied to the back of a buffalo.    This post is reading like the liner notes to a Radiohead album, or a Novel by Henry James.     Now, you go to your room and you think about what you did.

        Wut Da Hook Gon Be?   I don't need no fucking hooking on this beat.  What's up, chimps?  It's now Wednesday.  Actually it has been Wednesday for quite a few hours at this point, but that's neither here nor there, really.  Wednesday is typically my favorite, and yet most hated, day of the week.  I hate it because work is historically terrible on hump day.  Usually some jack ass calls in sick and someone else has to leave early, etc, etc.  The only thing that makes it remotely tolerable is the fact that I get a "Fresh" Smallville and Angel.  Next week marks the final episode of Angel altogether and the season finale of Smallville, so I might fly off the handle and destroy someone in two weeks, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  Today was not so bad, though, which I hope will make my stories, as Ginny calls them, all that much better.  I'm sure that not everybody that used to read this on a regular basis has realized that I've begun again, but to those of you that have, please take notice that I have a comments section.  Please feel free to call me names and add your two cents.  I always wanted to make my b to the l to the o to the g more communal but my Interactive Artificial Intelligence 3D display by LucasArts is still pending, so a comments section will have to do.  Anyway peeps, I have a date with the Texas Rangers, so I'm outtie.  Okay, let me clarify, I'm playing MVP 2004 Baseball and I'm in the middle of a series with the Rangers, I'm not actually dating them.  Buck Showalter's not really my type, anyway.

        Spies Will Not Be Tolerated.   So...  As I sit here before you eating a delicious tuna sandwich from Ye Olde Cheese Shoppe, I am confronted with a dilemma.  You see, I have uncovered a spy in my own home.   urlLink Dusty , world renown  urlLink Joe  and tireless do-gooder, was discovered lurking in my tinsel.  He has been there for some time documenting my every move.  On one hand I respect him because he's fucking Dusty, man, and on the other hand (this is not an admission of guilt) he has seen some things that would make King Solomon blush, and I can't trust him to keep it all hush hush.   He says he will, but I know better.  Therein lies my dilemma, do I kill the legendary Dusty, to keep certain "things" on the DL, or do I trust him and surrender him to the Joes.  Maybe I'll keep him locked in a secret prison for the rest of his life...   That seems like a very French thing to do.  I'll ask my good friend Dr. Mindbender for advice, he'll know what to do.  How many of you that saw yesterday's post thought that you wouldn't see me again for like another month?  I feel like I'm ready to pick this back up on a regualr basis.  Or in the immortal words of our lord and savior: " I am Bender, please insert liquor!"  I just found a disgusting wet black thing on my floor.  Maybe stream of consciousness isn't the way to go.  Until next time, I remain Captain Ameri... er, I mean, Steve Rogers.  Yeah.   WOTD:  abstruse \ab-STROOS; uhb-\, adjective:  Difficult to comprehend or understand.

        Guess Who.   No, it's not Ricardo Montalban you godless heathens, although I have been known to stroke my fair share of fine corinthian leather.  You might be asking yourself, "I wonder if he used a powerful stroke..."  And you can rest assured my mild mannered chums that I, in fact, used a powerful yet soothing stroke.  I'm known for my strokes.  Not well known, mind you, not yet at least.  Anyway,  If you are still checking this space for updates then I admire your dedication to my cause.  Finally you have reason to celebrate.  A new post at last, a new post at last, Good God almighty, a new post at last!  It's nothing special really, just a tiny verbal window into my soul.  I finally got suckered into signing up for Netflix, I ordered all the Inuyasha DVD's they had, I swore to myself that I wouldn't get tangled up in an Anime that had something like 200 episodes.  Well, I was really tired one night and it came on, I couldn't muster the energy to locate the remote and  then  actually change the channel, so I watched it and it was totally bad ass.  I think the fuckers at the Cartoon Network used their telepathy to secure the knowledge that I was going to watch it and then they played a totally kickass episode to hook me.  God Damned Enablers!  There's this monk who is a straight pussy hound, and then this one guy who is only like 2 inches tall and some weird cat/possibly-not-a-cat like animal that was cool, too.  Anyway, it was also pretty funny.  And then just like that I had to know more.  What's up with this Noraku guy?  Why does he have such a hard on for Inuyasha?  I must discover the answers!  So I qeued those bitches up and I guess they'll send them to me or something.  The whole situation will probably go the way of the turd after a month or so, but at least I will know more about Inuyasha.  Does Nick Seaman gotta choke a bitch?

        This Is How I Talk, Motherfucker!   That was obviously a Sam Jackson (via The Chappelle Show) joke.  Sam is the man.  There is no room for misunderstanding.  He must be the coolest motherfucker in Hollywood.  If I ever found out that he was actually a dick in real life, I might die.  The very real pain it would cause me would be too much.  Merely the idea of it is causing mild discomfort.  I'm not sure why I bring it up.  I mean, yeah I watched Formula 51 recently but that was like a week and a half ago.  Well, no time to worry about that now, we have things to discuss.  Things like how awesome the Texas Rangers are.  I'm sorry, I meant to say The First Place Texas Rangers.  I had a discussion today about a certain 252 million dollar shortstop that the Yankees aquired this last off season.  The man in question goes by the name of Alex Rodriguez.  My question is this: If A-Rod is so great, if he really is worth the 252 Mil. that the Rangers dropped on him back in 2001, then why have the teams he left (Seattle and Texas) immediatley gotten better after his departure?  Seattle improved by 30 games the season after A-Rod left and the God Damn Texas Rangers are in 1st place.  I don't deny that the man has skill, but how can you justify paying a man so much money when he doesn't improve your team.  If baseball was tennis A-Rod would be like that kid Bobby Fisher, a certifiable savant.  Unfortunately, baseball happens to be a team sport and when you have 9/10ths of your payroll wrapped up in one dude you can't get him good team mates, and if you did it's not like he would make them better.  All I'm saying is if you payed the man 15 Million a year instead of 21 Million a year you'd have six mil left over for the free agent market and the man could still pay his fucking water bill.  I think that all the baseball teams should get together and swear an oath on the Lord that they will never pay somebody more than 10 Mil a year and never give them a contract of over 5 years.  It's ridiculous.  If I had his talent I wouldn't accept a contract over league minimum because a guy that special belongs to baseball not the other way around.  I would put my heart and soul into the game and make friends with the fans and make the owner of my team, the team that I love, use all that God Damn money he wanted to spend on me to build a fucking team that will win the World Series 3 years in a row.  And I would insist that Buck Showalter be our manager.  That is all.   I would like to address that "If baseball was like tennis..." thing.  I realize that Bobby Fisher never played baseball or tennis.  What I was saying is that if baseball was a one person sport like tennis then A-Rod would be the Bobby Fisher of tennis.  Becasue that Bobby Fisher kid was a chess savant.  Do you understand my metaphor now?  I accepted the fact that it was a little convoluted and then I moved on.  You should too.

        Angertutional!  (or: Made Up Words On A Tuesday Night.)   There are a couple things I would like to discuss with you, one is funny and the other is not funny.  Did you get all that?  One funny, one un-funny.  Okay.    First - I would like to say that made up words are funny.  Billy and I had a go 'round with a bunch of fake words the other day.  Let me give you some examples: instudiously, lameatorium, awesometastical, irresponsitory, stokalicious and, most recently, angertutional.  Miller beer has a new ad campaign where Bob Odenkirk is debating a Clydesdale while running for "President of Beers", playing on the viewers democratic nature by insinuating that the "King of Beers" is too monarchical.  (that's a real word, by the way)  Anyway, in this one commercial he is being shushed by the moderator and he says "This whole thing is a travesty, a sham and a mockery.  It's a traveshamockery!"  and the moderator says "no making up words." and then Bob says "burgelflickle!"  It's really funny, mostly because if you have seen Mr. Show you know that when Bob is acting angry it's, perhaps, the funniest thing ever.  My point is that even Miller has seen the joys of making up words.  The English language is brutal and oftentimes confusing but it's ours and we should help it be ever-expanding.  It is our civic duty.  Therefore I charge you to make up your own words and send them to me, either via email or just use the comments section.    By mentioning the comments section I have segued seamlessly into my next point.  You people need to use the God Damn comments section.  It's not there for eye candy.  I almost moved to a different blogging service based solely on the fact that they had a comments section even though I love blogger, it's pretty and easy to use.  When they added a comments section I went to my room and masturbated for two straight hours.  Needless to say that was painful and quite disgusting.  The punch line is that I would like to see you comment more because I enjoy our playful banter with one another.  Without that we might as well move back to the caves, start wearing animal skins again and fustigate our meals to death with makeshift cudgels and overt rocks.  You know, like French people.  And now I will seamlessly end this post with a curse word.  Shit.

        It's A Relief   I'm glad I don't have any enemies.  Well, I might have enemies but I'm glad that nobody else knows who they are.  I don't like confrontation.  I'm not good at it.  I'm not a world renown debater like one Mr. Michael Chacey.  When I argue it's more like, "shut up - you smell!"  and I like to make up facts (although, if I made them up they probably aren't considered facts)  I also don't care for fisticuffs.  I don't mind watching viloence, I just don't care to participate.  Does this make me a pussy?  You bet your ass it does.  Luckily, I'm tall and girthful.  That enables me to easily intimidate people with a glare.  However if they take even a moment to talk to me, as you all have done, then they will realize that I am, in fact, not dangerous or outwardly mean.  I have been known to get into arguments, sometimes mean spirited ones, but usually they are with people who are already my friends and will not hit me.  We make up the next day and all is well.  It always makes me laugh when someone who I now assent to as a friend tells me that when they first met me I was in a foul mood or was yelling at someone and they took me to be a bastard, but once said person was put in a situation where they were forced to speak to me I came off very pleasant.  It's all about impressions.  The reason I bring this all up is that Gabe from Penny Arcade and another guy named Sean Howard from a rival web comic called A Modest Destiny had a go round last year about certain things, and this Howard guy has been making veiled threats and such against him since then.  I know it proabably started out as a misunderstanding, and it doesn't help that Gabe is an asshole (which is why we love and revere him) but I just couldn't imagine disliking anyone enough to keep harping about them for the better part of a year.  I have had fights, and I have lost friends but I just let it go.  Even if I thought I was right and the other person was an idiot.  I let it go and moved on.  This Howard guy claims he has tried to move on but everytime someone brings it up (i.e. Scott Kurtz or a forum flamer) he gets all riled up again.  If he truly had moved on or at least made an effort to do so that kind of thing wouldn't bother him.  Granted I don't have all the facts, and it's really none of my business but I just read this Howard guy's blog and, besides his extremly high opinion of himself, he mentions Gabe a lot.  A lot lot.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't like to keep reminding myslef of all the fights I've been in, I find that, when I do, I get really pissed off.  It's not conducive to "moving on".  Seems to me that I wouldn't want to keep drawing the ire of someone who can perpetually piss me off.  Seems I might be driven to a certain Death Penalty invoking crime.  All I'm saying is that if this Howard guy was really dedicated to the "moving on" philosophy he would just stop talking about it.  Stop responding to flames, stop answering questions about it, stop replying to email, stop fucking blogging about it and stop caring what fucking Gabe from fucking Penny Arcade is doing this week.  It's a god damn web comic.  Move on.  But I digress...  Sorry about the no-post yesterday, I was in the company of someone a whole hell of a lot more charming than you fuckers.  We watched the Cleveland Indians and the Chi-town White Sox engage in ye olde American past time.  C.C. Sabathia is a monster on the  mound.  Anyway enjoy the new hero of the week and the new word of the day.   WOTD:  jeremiad \jair-uh-MY-uhd\, noun:  A tale of sorrow, disappointment, or complaint; a doleful story; also, a dolorous or angry tirade.   I always find it to be a nice bit of synchronicity when the word of the day matches up so nicely with my blog.  Peace out bitches.

        Specially Equipped Vehicle   It seems like I might be going through the motions today.  No real purpose, just doing things because I have to.  That wasn't even a proper sentence.  I have been trying to put together a particular CD for about a week now.  It's a themed CD for my DnD group, to be played on the day that they fight the Eldest Living Red Dragon.  They have been building up to this point for almost a year (in real time) and the expectations are high, so I thought a little music might enhance the experience.  One could say it's mood music.  I don't want to say what it is, exactly, because they read this (I assume) and I want the CD to be a surprise.  Anyway, I have been having some problems getting it right.  Tommy B and Gin gave me some good ideas, but certain aspects of it seem forced.  If you are wise in the ways of music and desire to help (also you can't be Billy, Adam or Lyd) please email me.  I could use a couple more songs to really bring the message home.  I find that music helps to stimulate the imagination.  For example, the first time we ever played the Star Wars RPG, Billy made a CD of songs from the movies, all that John Williams stuff, and it added a great deal to the fun.  In fact, the last time we played Star Wars we didn't have music and our group of adventurers ended up at odds with each other.  Now mostly this was Adam's fault, because his character was a jerkoff, but I can see how music might have helped us mend fences.  See Adam's character is a halfwit and almost got everyone killed with his shoot-first-and-don't-bother-to-ask-questions method of roleplaying, so my Jedi used a little Mind Trick action to make him stop (which I got Dark Side Points for, even though it was for the betterment of the group) but he still found a way to get us in trouble.  So my Scoundrel set his blaster to stun, shot Adam's dude and knocked his ass out, and when he came to you'd have thought I fucked his mother on live TV.  Needless to say we got into a fire fight and my blasters were on stun and his were not, I had to feign death just to escape.  The point is, all that could have been avoided with the addition of music.  See, it soothes the something something.  In closing I would like to say that Adam's Character is gay and he makes gay sex videos with male dogs.  Also, he's a racist.

        Your Funky Mother   There has been some discussion as to whether or not I should have included horrible lizard monsters in my address yesterday.  I maintain that it was not only a good idea but it was perhaps the best idea ever.  Better than cheese even.  You see, now that I have shown the HLM the obeisance they so capaciously deserve they will obey me and quash my enemies.  It was all part of my plan.  Perhaps if you had been nicer to them they wouldn't be forced to kill you now.  But that's neither here nor there.  Enough about me, let's talk about you.  For a small pittance of 1 dollar I will spare your pitiful life.  That's 1 dollar (US) from each citizen and I won't kill you.  I figure, why make the gov't pay me multiple millions of dollars when they'll just charge you for it later.  And, c'mon, it's only a dollar.  Who wouldn't pay a dollar to be spared.  I already paid myself my dollar to not kill me.  Who's next?  I guess maybe I should reenter the real world and tell you that I am just about finished with the second season of The West Wing and it only get's better.  After that I move onto the 3rd season of The Soprano's, and then Sports Night sometime down the road.  I wish Sorkin would write more things.  He has a movie coming out which he is producing and West Wing and Sports Night cohort Thomas Schlamme is directing, it's about the TV.  Like an actual TV, not some mercurial concept.  The physical manifestation that sits in your entertainment center.  So we have that to look forward to.   WOTD:  primogeniture \pry-moh-JEN-ih-choor\, noun:  1. The state of being the firstborn of the same parents; seniority by birth among children of the same family.  2. (Law) An exclusive right of inheritance that belongs to the eldest son.

        Debriefed!   Ladies, gentlemen, distinguished guests, honorable friends, horrible lizard monsters and sheep I come to you not out of neccesity but out of disdain.  I do not like you, nor have I ever liked you.  I would like the record to show that on occasion when I was nice I was doing it in an entirely condescending manner.  I feel that I have gotten away form my roots in this.  To that end I am starting an evil initiative that will eradicate all niceties from my manner of speech, demeanor, intonation and eyebrow movement.  I know that you would like more details about said initiative, but I am no Bond villain, I will not explain my plan before I destroy you.  *ahem*   I mean "before I am mean to you", not "destroy".  With that in mind I wrgwefdcwefwgrgfxvw...  ...sorry, a spider crawled onto my keyboard and I freaked out a little.  Seriously, it was one of those tiny little red spiders that creep me out.  I think it may have gotten into my keyboard.  Now it's probably going to lay it's eggs in there and one day when I'm reading research on String Theory and the Unification of Forces a thousand little spiders will emerge from behind my "h" key and lay waste to my hands and devour my flesh like a fat guy at Home Town Buffet.  In a situation like that the only real winners are Yoichiro              Nambu, Leonard Susskind, and Holger Nielsen who independently discovered that the dual resonance model devised by Veneziano is based on the quantum mechanics of relativistic vibrating strings, thus beginning String theory.  And, yes, it's  that  Veneziano.  I'll leave you with the image of a thousand spiders stripmining my bones of their flesh.  Well, that, and the knowledge that there is a new episode of Red vs. Blue.

        I Have No Time.   The West Wing is perhaps the finest show of our time.  In Sorkin's name we pray, Amen.   I have to go watch more of it.  Please forgive my shortish post.  There is a new Strongbad Email out, go check it.   WOTD: enjoin \en-JOIN\, transitive verb:  1. To direct or impose with authority; to order.  2. To prohibit; to forbid.

        Buoyancy Of Citrus   So, I went and saw Harry Potter.  It was great.  Hell, it could have been the worst movie ever and I would say that it was great.  They ttok some liberties with the film, which I suspected they would, but it turned out just fine.  I was wholly impressed with the visual effects and the aesthetics.  I think that Alfonso Cuarón did a superior job than Chris Columbus in this aspect.  But the flow of the movie was better in the two Columbus "Potter" films.  I'm not saying it was neccesarily bad in the new one, it just went quick (for a 2.5 hour movie)  They did the first, like, seven chapters in 15 minutes and then it was off to Hogwarts, which is fine, because all your action is going to take place there and not in Surry, or wherever the hell the Dursley's live.  Pace aside, I feel this was the best movie of the three and I think that going with a darker director, like Cuarón, was the right move for a darker novel.  It could have used two things and it would have been perfect; 1- More Quidditch and 2- an explanation regarding Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.  The explanation part doesn't bother me as much because I already know who they are and why they have those nicknames.  But to someone who hasn't read the book, they are S.O.L.  because they didn't explain them even a little.  As for the other point,  any  movie would be better with quidditch.  Think about that Passion of the Christ movie, now think about it if the Romans played the Jews in a quidditch match.  Which one was better in your head?  Can you see Jesus on a Nimbus 2001 or better yet a Firebolt?  I sure can.  You thought he was a good savior, wait til you see him as a Beater.  Anyway, there was a number of things I would liked to have seen in the movie, but it would have been like 4 hours long then.  And, although I think that would be fucking awesome, it's probably not feasible.  Moving on.   I would like to state for the record that I kicked Mike's ass in Halo yesterday.  He will tell you differently, most likely at great length, but he is a liar.  I am a dangerous person with a shotgun and a pistol.  I bet Mike is still feeling the shame.  By the by, a new episode of Red vs. Blue came out today, go to the site and check it out.  Caboose's brain is fucked and Simmons is a cyborg.  Nick (otNH) out.

        Week's End Summary   There are a plethora of things that I have been meaning to write, and every time I sit down to blog some other thing always comes out of my brain, so I just saved those things up and will present them to you today.  I have been watching The Soprano's and Six Feet Under on DvD and both are very good shows.  Six Feet Under has more guy-on-guy action than I care for.  I wouldn't even mention it if they counter balanced it with an equal amount of girl-on-girl action, but it's just not there.  An unfortunate oversight.  Anyway, most of you know that Scrubs is my favorite TV show, and towards the end of the season we got to see more of Carla's brother.  He cracks me up and I wish they'd make him more permanent.  Anyway, the guy who plays him is also on Six Feet Under.  He plays a restorative artist, which is to say he makes dead people look good for their funerals.  He is great on SFU and it's good to see him in more of a starring role.  Interestingly enough the woman who plays his sister on Scrubs is in The Sopranos, she plays Paulie Walnuts' girlfriend, or something.  So it's like the weird pre-scrubs life of these two.  Sometimes, when I read the word "first"  I don't see "1st" I see "Fir St."  Like, that guy lives on Fir Street.  It's weird.  I'm going to see Harry Potter tonight, and I'm so excited I could almost poop on myself.  I won't, but it's always a possibility.  This is my favorite book, becuase it introduces my favorite character, Cirius Black.  Also Lupin.  Don't get me wrong, Goblet of Fire is great but this one has time traveling and hippogriffs and fucking dementors and  God Damn  Sirius Black.  By the way, I'm a big Harry Potter fan.  Anyway, I'm going to eat my subway and play baseball until it's time to go watch HPatPoA.  p's

        One For The Money, Yessir.    I must have said the word "cock" (in some form or another) at least 200 times today.  No shit.  Sometimes it was "cock biter" or the more formal "cock bite"  notice the subtle differences.  Mostly it was just plain old "cock".  Ginny's seen me like this before, where I'll just call everyone and everything a cock.  If you were to ask my manager how many times I called him a cock today he wouldn't be able to remember because the number is higher than Sir Edmund Hillary standing on a ladder, snorting cocaine.  It's not that I loves the cock as much as it is that I loves the word cock.  Just like how it's not Jared that loves the cock so much as it is his mouth that loves the cock.  At least that's what Shawn told me.  Fucking cock-smokers.  I must have cock on the brain.  Again, not  actual  cock, just the word "cock".  I think you folks have had enough cock for one day, so let's move on.  The "girl" came back in today.  You know the one.  I figured out why she talks that way, she's deaf.  I kind of felt like a shit-ass today, looking at her and thinking about what I wrote.  It wasn't remorse, but it was something.  I have no problem making fun of people, especially not cripples, minorities, old people, ugly babies, chicks with itty bitty tittes, or, God help them, disgusting hippies.  I guess it's because I have no social interaction with these people.  But I've been helping this girl for two days now and I have talked to her quite a bit, she's really nice and pretty funny, and now I kind of (just a little) feel like a shit-ass.  Somewhere there's a light side Jedi Master who still has hope for me.  I wonder if I'm losing my edge...  You guys would tell me if I was off my game right?  I couldn't stand just being "a little condescending" or "barely an asshole".  It's all or nothing, baby.  Fuck you cocks.

        OMG, WTF Dude?   Words cannot describe how much I hate abbreviations of this nature.  Although they can begin to.  They suck the sweet juice out of our language, like a vampire appropriating the blood of a 12 year old virgin girl.  At first, he just lets the succulent nectar roll over his undead togue before popping her tiny head off like a warm animated cork and drenching his face in her toothsome liquid vitae.  That almost seems  too  vulgar.  I loathe abbreviations almost as much as I loathe the undead.  No sense of propriety, those undead.  I just wanted to tell everyone that yesterday's post was a hoax.  I did write something but I thought putting that "content removed" blurb would rile you up even more than I could.  So if you wish to actually read what I wrote I will print it below.  content removed from 060104 post: "Today I was at work and this highly attractive woman came to the counter and I asked what I could do for her.  She must have had some sort of childhood disease that disrupted her speech patterns because she sounded like, God forgive me, a cow that had had it's tongue removed and replaced with a pissed off cat who, in turn, had been punched in the brain.  I almost,  almost , gave the slightest hint of a smile.  A smile that would have given away exactly what I was thinking at that moment.  Specifically: "Bwahahahahahaha!!!!"  Anyhow, I managed to surpress this feeling and went about helping her, keep in mind that this girl was really hot.  As our conversation progressed I came to the conclusion that, if I were to ever have sex with this girl she would  have to  remain silent or, at least, have her mouth bound in some fashion, so as to keep her quiet.  If she were talking dirty in bed, it would be too much for one mere human to take."  As you can see, it is quite bad, but nothing so bad that it would require removal, thus negating my constitutional right to free speech.  I just wanted to see you girls get your respective panties in a collective bunch.   I wanted to continue my "Mike Is Always Right" rant and tell you that if you have not checked out  urlLink Red vs. Blue  then you need to.  It's fucking hilarious.  I will add the link to my sidebar right over there ----------->  Pvt.

        Blog, Not  A Blog.    Sometimes thoughts occur to me that make me shudder.  Thoughts that, if spoken aloud, could make people never want to talk to me again, or worse yet could end in a tragic homicide/suicide.  One such thought struck me today and I just had to share it, so if you are frail of heart or are still trying to decide if you like me or not stop reading now, because, rest assured, this will sway your opinion of me or outright kill you.  Obviously, some of you out there already know me well enough to realize that this is probably relatively mild compared to some of the other things I've mentioned in the confines of Adam's backroom or my apartment.  Anyway, let me tell you what happened.   >>content removed  Please realize, I'm not without sympathy for her, it's just something that occured to me.  To those of you who didn't heed my warning and continued to read please accept my apologies for the fact that you are either, a) dead now, or b) never going to speak to me again.

        And I'm Back In.    I am up and running down here.  Got my shit all hooked up today.  I even got a new email address.  You can still reach me at the nick_seaman@hotmail.com addy, but my sunflower account is kaput.  My new email addy is nickseaman@skt.net.  The skt stands for southern kansas telecom.  I'm crazy smart.  I'm supposed to begin work next week, which sucks after you've been on vacation for two weeks, but fuck it I'm getting lazy sitting on my ass all day.  Oh yeah, I turned 26 yesterday.  I'm finally old enough to do, um, pretty much anything I want.  Just thought I'd give you an update.  Peace out bitches.

        And I'm Out   It's Sunday.  The Lord's Day.  I am over at Adam's house and he's cooking my dinner, man do I love my firends.  I spent the day cleaning my apartment and getting it prepped for the final walkthrough, which is tomorrow at 9am, after that I am gone like smallpox.  I just hit the shift key on Adam's computer 5 times in a row (I was trying to think about what to write) and aparently there are hidden commands that are activated by hitting the shift key 5 times in a row.  Who knew?  Anyway, I will have the internet up and running at my new abode in no time,  Actually it's already up and running I just have to buy a big ethernet cable and drill a hole in my closet so I can plug into my Dad's router.  Then it will be Wichita Blog Motherfucking Central, or WBMC for short.  Holler!

        I Should So Be Packing Right Now.   However, I am not.  I would rather share this with you.  I have created a  urlLink Flickr  account which is a service affiliated with Blogger.  It allows me to store pictures in a sort of photo album thing.  I have posted a bunch of pictures with descriptions and what-not.  I also tagged them so you can search for certain ones, but seeing as there is only about 19 right now I think that might be unnecessary.  Anyway, here is the link:  urlLink My Pictures   I will also put it in the links area over on the right.  So you don't have to remember it.  Right now it's a bunch of pictures from Vacation: The Reckoning that you've never seen, because you didn't care enough to ask.  But once I get to The Ta I will use it to keep you apprised of my life in a visible sense.  Much like I will use the blog to keep you up on my life in the verbal or lexical sense.  Look that up in your Funk & Wagnall's.  For the love of God, I have to go pack now.

        Because I Wanna...    Hey shit heads.  I was thinking and I've decided not to do it anymore.  Thinking, that is.  It doesn't pay dividends like it should.  I am under the firm belief that the things I do should be rewarded.  And I don't just mean big things, I mean all things.  "But Nick I don't understand, could you possibly give me an example?"  Of course I can you imbecile, now get back in the god damn box!  I mean that when I take a shit somebody should show up and pat me on the back, say "good work" and give me five bucks.  When I take out the trash someone should give me a cookie, and when I go to bed there should be a person waiting at my front door in the morning congratulating me on a successful night sleep.  I wouldn't have to be rewarded for jerking off becasue that's a reward unto itself.  Speaking of orgasms, I think we should harness the power of the orgasm and replace the fortunes in fortune cookies with a small orgasm.  So when you crack that motherfucker open the orgasm energy is released and you get  The Sensation  for a moment.  Asian eateries would become the busiest places on earth and the fortune cookie industry would triple our GNP.  Also they should do it without telling anyone.  Imagine sitting at a table with three of your friends chock full of General Tso's Chicken, everyone's laughing and joking and then you get the cookies.  Everybody cracks them open at the same time while the owner watches from afar, laughing quitely to himself.  The table goes silent for a moment, save the audible sighs.  Nobody feels comfortable making eye contact for about a minute because they're not sure if it happened to everyone else.  Then one of your friends says with gusto "These are the best fortune cookies.  Ever."  Everyone nods in fervent agreement.  And as the waiter busses your table he happily eyes the 45% tip that you left because, for some reason, you were feeling extra generous.  Of course Fortune Cookie theft would sky rocket.  Plus, Christians would probably have a fucking problem with it.  God Damn Christians.

        Here I Sit, Broken-hearted...   Couldn't remember knowledge imparted.  You thought I was going to say something about shit didn't you?  Well, I am, so keep your chin up.  Here's the thing about shit; it's smelly.  But enough about you.  I read Fire's update from today and I about busted a gut laughing from this nugget "...this will be a community of diversity and excitement."  I love Fire's all-inclusive attitude, it casts my blog into stark relief.  What with me being so exclusive and all.   STREAM OF CONCIOUSNESS ASIDE: I have got to delete the fucking techno music off of my computer, it is a dangerous distraction.  I'll be chilling, looking on the net or blogging and all the sudden I realize that I am nodding my head in time to some rapid fire drum machine and I'm all like "What the fuck is going on here, I'm gonna get whiplash or something." >end S.O.C.    Sorry about that.  Where was I?  Oh yeah, I hate people and their petty problems, what about me huh?  What about my problems?  For instance, why in the sam-fuck does my first baseman feel the need to leave his post to retrieve a groundball that the second baseman could easily scoop up?  I don't understand it.  It confuses me and invariably the pitcher has to then sprint over to first and cover while the idotic first baseman engages in this retardedness.  See what I've got on my plate?  It's not fair.  It's not right and it's not fair!  How do you explain that with your precious science?

        Apparently I'm Going To Hell.   Take a look at this email I got today:   Getting out of debt is not easy, but it is Biblical.  Proverbs 22:7 tells us that "the rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender." God instructs us to do that which is beneficial to us, and getting out of credit card debt would allow so many to give back to God's kingdom.   I am almost nearly speechless.  Almost.  What kind of fucking person would prey on a person's sense of faith to get them to consolidate a loan.  I understand about tithing and giving to your church and that's all well and good, but to imply that if you have credit card debt then you are in poor standing with The Big Man, and I don't mean Shaq, well, that's just wrong.  I have a good sense of right and wrong which, when combined with, literally, gallons of luck, has kept me out of jail and trouble my whole life.  Also, I'm not what you'd call a religious man, but I can appreciate faith and religion, and I am slightly offended by this email.  But I digress.  Of all the people everywhere, I wonder how in the hell they got my email address, boy they sure got steered (stirred? stur? steerded?) in the wrong direction.  Losers.  On a different note:  I got an email today about credit card debt and The Lord...  wait, same note, forget it.  I apologize for the lack of text in these confines this week.  I have been occupied with other things.  For instance, Buffy Season 6, my father, packing et al.  Anyhow, I wished to update a bit and tell you that the next couple weeks may be kind of sketchy as it is that time of the year again.  By which, of course, I mean moving time.  If you go back to last July in the archives you will find similar references and see what I mean.  For now, please accept this WOTD and be done with it.  Good day.  I said good day!   WOTD:  acuity \uh-KYOO-uh-tee\, noun:  Acuteness of perception or vision; sharpness.    **UPDATE**  Funny story...  I was uploading the picture of the new hero of the week and the title of the image is spike.jpg, well I try and upload it and it keeps giving me this error about another file with the same name and I'm all like, "Bullshit!"  well, turns out that I  did  have another file named spike.jpg, it was Spike from Buffy/Angel.  I completely forgot he was in there still.  If you are having a hard time understanding what's funny about this allow me to explain.  Are you ready?  Here goes: It's funny because I am stupid.  Now you're laughing.

        I AM MIGHTY!   What's up, my fair crackers?  You know, without that comma in the first sentence it could be badly misconstrued.  So, seriously, what's up?  Cause I got nothin'  Just sitting here, staring at my computer screen.  I'm still waiting for Lady Inspiration to get off her lazy ass and show up in my precious brain.  FIRE:  go  urlLink here  for the answer to your question.  I use it and it works good.  Or well.  I always mess that up.  Well, shit.  I guess I'll go play some baseball until that inspiration shows up.  Nothing satisfies quite like hitting a baseball 530 feet.  I leave you with  urlLink this.    "Lady" Inspiration just made my list.  Fucking bitch.

        I Guess I Should Mention This.   This is July and it marks my one year anniversary of using this blog.  I don't remember the exact date I started, I suppose I could go look but I really don't care.  This current post, the one you are readnig presently, represents my 183 post and it will push me past 44,000 total words written.  A few things struck me when I learned that tasty fact:  1) How many of those words did I make up?  B) How many of those words are swear words?  £) How many times have I cursed the Lords name and/or taken it in vain?  ∂)  How many insightful things have I written?  One, two maybe?  Who knows.  The point is, it has been fun for me and I know I bitch a lot and sometimes get off on uninteresting tangents but guess what, it's my fucking blog, if you don't like it you wouldn't keep reading it.  And if you stopped reading it, I really don't blame you.  It's not that good.    As many of you know I will be moving back to Wichita at the end of this month, and I want my Lawrence posse to know that I never thought I would meet as many cool people up here as I did.  You guys have been great and I will miss you all dearly.  Lord help me, even Shawn.  So Billy K., Adam B., Shawn F., Jackie B., Lydia W., Rich, JP & All The Greenwoods., Travis H., J. Fire, Bryan & Candace, Tara W., Dannie & Family, Shawn I., Kahn D., Burton P., Doug & Sarah, Pants, Rev, Dean R., TJ, Tim & Family, Kirk & Shelly, Tom & Jess, Rabbi, Justin K., John T., Chris S. and the many others that I've forgotten I want to say thanks for making my stay here worth while.    With that bit of sentimentality finished, I would like to go on and say that I will not be abandoning my blog, I will keep it going with the voracious glee that you have come to expect.  I think it may even improve.  See, the stuff you guys read about now, some, if not most of you, already know about it since I live in the same town as you.  But now, with me being in the bottom half of our glorious state, you can read about my wacky misadventures there.  I might even let the now infamous Grant say hello once in a great great while.  Plus, it's not like I'm moving to Canada or some other part of Europe, I'll definitely be back up here so you guys can lavish me with affection etc.    Last night's episode of Futurama, The Farnsworth Parabox, is the finest  of all the Futurama episodes.  If you have not seen it, it will be on again in about 3 months, or you can buy the Season 4 DVD boxed set when it come out.  Which I highly reccomend.  Peace and Elbow Grease.

        So Disappointed...   What part of "use the comments sections" do you fuckers not understand?  I realize that it won't let you post a name unless you type it in the message body, but get over it.  I cut the fucking shit out of myself today.  Seems like about every two weeks, without fail, I manage to practically sever a limb or digit.  Today it was a digit.  No biggie though, I put a Band-Aid brand bandage on it and cursed our lord's name and all was well.  Today I went out to the parking lot and there was some dirt (or something) on the side of my tire, not on the tread mind you, but the side, and I said this sentence out loud: "What the shit is that shit on my fucking tire?"  It was the highlight of my day.  Also I had a Capri Sun, which was right up there.  I don't have any tirades or lengthy stroies involving my new-found lust for america's past time today, nor do I have any parables regarding post-apocolyptic religions, or even a cock-and-bull story about the socioeconomic ramifications of the RICO Act.  (RICO means "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations")  So I'm posting these little two or three sentence blurbs with the desire to make you laugh a little until you go back to your regularly scheduled lives.  Anyway, I have to continue watching The Sopranos season 3 today (explains that RICO thing, huh?) so I'll let you go.  Please send me suggestions (via email, since it's not actually a comment) for new Heroes Of The Week, I had a hard time coming up with Cookie Monster, actually it's been difficult the last couple weeks.  Anyway, if you have a personal hero you'd like to see up there, send in their name and why they deserve such a prestigious fucking honor.  Peace be with you, my children.  (And also with me)

        Grant, You Old Fucking Bastard.   Ironically, Grant doesn't even have access to the internet, so he can't read this.  More important, though, is the fact that he can't defend himself.  You see, today is Grant's birthday.  25 years ago today his unfortunate mother wrought forth the ungrateful hatemonger.  (did you know that, in addition to meaning "created", wrought is the past tense of "work"?  I didn't.)  So, in honor of my friend, his great halfwittedness, I deliver unto you the following anecdote.  A yarn, if you will.  Grant and I used to go to school together.  He'd either swing by and pick me up or I'd drive out into the wilderness to his house and pick him up.  Either way, 9 times out of 10 we went to school together.  On one occasion we were almost to school, I mean like a block away, and some jackass in his Grandma's 87 Escort wagon swings around a corner going about 50 MPH.  Grant is a notoriously slow driver, primarily because he hasn't driven a car that had a working speedometer in, well, ever.  So we weren't going too terribly fast, plus we had to finish our cigs before we got onto school property or they'd suspend us.  (they had cameras all over the parking lots to catch kids smoking)  Anyway this kid tries to mash on the brakes and he hits a patch of sand and his car starts fishtailing and he eventually loses control of it and the ass end of his wagon slams into the front end of Grant's P.o.S Oldsmobile.  It's important to mention here that Grant has a rather short fuse.  He seems calm and lucid on the surface, but underneath his halcyon exterior lies a bitter, chafed heart.  Grant immediately goes to open his door with rage in his eyes, I look over to make sure he is OK and I can see the physical manifestation of his anger.  Thereupon, I realize that if Grant gets his door open this kid in the Escort is going to get a ferocious beating, him and his two friends.  (Grant is no slouch like yours truly, he is a freakishly strong individual, also, did I mention he has a lot of pent up anger?)  I grab his arm and scream at him to calm the fuck down, luckily the impact jammed his door shut, otherwise, in addition to getting a ticket, the kid would have received a free ambulance ride.  Anyway, I think the kid in the Escort also saw the hellfire brewing in Grant's eyes because he promptly apologized and made sure everyone was all right.  That fucking kid should have thanked me and God for saving his worthless little life.  Some lady in an apartment complex heard the accident and came running out, phone in hand calling 911.  The cops show up and just fucking rail this kid, they determined that he must have been going between 40-45 MPH by the length of the skid marks.  He gets like 4 tickets with a side order of verbal abuse.  So justice was served and all was right in the world, right?  I think not.  Our adrenaline was flowing like amber waves of fucking grain and we were way too hopped up to go to school right away, so we drive around and smoke like two packs of cigs and drink a bunch of coffee before finally making it to school by 5th hour.  Our German teacher inquires as to our whereabouts for the first 4 periods of school and Grant pulls the grill of his car out of his backpack, like a hunters trophy, and explains to the class that we were nearly killed this morning (an exaggeration, but fuck them, they weren't there...) and then we were lavished with affection and sympathy by all the chicks in our class and excused of any wrong doing for the rest of class.  It was a master stroke.  By the by, we were in 2 wrecks that week.  The other was much more vicious and, if not for seatbelts, my mother and I probably would have been killed or at least very badly injured.  But that's a story for another time.  I saw a kid today who had a mohawk and spikey clothing driving a new cooper with a Union Jack painted on the roof and all I could think of was "That is fucking punk rock to death.  I bet he gets so much ass he has to open an ass savings account where he can store his excess ass until it comes time to service said ass."  Yeah, it was definitely something like that.  Meanwhile I'm wearing plaid and driving a '93 accord with front blinkers that don't work, my ass savings account is more nonexistent than Rambo, the Tooth Fairy and Jesus combined.  Travis said "nut sack" today right in front of everyone.  It was fucking great.   WOTD:  congeries \KON-juh-reez\, noun (singular and plural):  A collection; an aggregation.

        You Look So Out Of Context   So, obviously, I've been on this baseball tangent lately and I'm not typically a baseball fan because the players seem more like hired guns than athletes. (with notable exceptions, but not enough to matter)  But this god damn video game, MVP 2004, has me entranced like some sort of stripper hypnotist.  I have learned more about baseball, not only by playing the game but talking to my manager (an avid baseball fan) and researching which players I should trade for.  Baseball is a pretty cool sport, it's just too bad that the top 20% of players are assholes and money grubbing whores.  The sport gets a bad image becasue people like Barry Bonds are anti-media.  You'd be anti-media too if everytime you had an at-bat some god damn reporter wanted to ask you twenty fucking questions about Hank Aaron and whatever the fuck else they can think of.  Admittedly, I don't like Barry, but that has more to do with the fact that he's an arrogant prick than it does with the fact that he is hostile towards the media.  All that notwithstanding, I am seriously looking forward to the All Star game.  This is the first year that the players and managers got to vote for the allstars, and it really made a difference, instead of having the population of New York vote just for New York players, now people that actually deserve to go are getting to attend.  Joe Torre, despite being the hellspawn that he is, voted a couple of guys in that have deserved to go for a couple years but the fans ignored them becasue they play for small market teams.  I like this system and so do the players and managers.  There is one person who probably doesn't like it and that is Carlos Beltran.  Carlos Beltran was voted in as an AL all star by the players in the american league, a week and a half ago the Royals traded Carlos to the Houston Astros who are an NL team.  The rules say that he can't play for the AL because he's not in th AL, but he didn't get voted in by the NL players, so he gets fucked.  He can go and participate in the festivities but he can't play in the game.  Not that I really give a shit, I just think that MLB kind of put the screws to Carlos.  Moving away from sport, I have yet to see Spiderman 2, which, by all accounts, is better than the first movie.  I am really excited to see it.  So Ginny calls me the other day and says that she and her friend Andy went and saw it, so I ask her how it was and she pauses and says in a not-to-enthused voice "it was OK".  So I tell her that everybody that I know and every movie site on the net says it's better than the first one, so what gives?  I don't really remember what she said, mostly because I stopped listening to her, but I think I got the message across that she was wrong.  It's important to make sure that you remind smart people that they are wrong every now and then, it keeps them from getting a big head, but mostly it's fun to sardonically rub their biggety faces in it.  As a side note, I would like to mention that you should not try this with Mike Chacey because he will punch you right in the throat.  You have no idea how hard it is to laugh derisively at someone with a crushed windpipe.  Right in the fucking throat.

        Consider This...   Mike, Michael Jordan is already Serena Williams.  However, if baseball was like chess then Michael Jordan would be me.  Apparently my metaphor from yesterday was a linguistic paradox.  Don't think about it for too long or your head will explode like a can of mushroom soup that is 3 years old.  Sometimes when I write things it's an adventure for the reader.  And I don't mean the fun kind with Jackie Chan and a hot air balloon.  I mean the sucky kind with Charles Manson and the parole board.  I had to suffer through another one of those Red Sox/Yankees games that end in tragedy last night.  My God Damn Sox were up 2-0 in the 7th and they ended up losing.  I'm not sure what the final score was becasue I turned it off at the end of the 8th when the score was 4-2 Yankees.  I have so fucking had it with the Yankees.  Mike can relate being a Baltimore and Boston fan.  If I lived in an Americal League East city I would throw rocks at the Yankees every time they came to my city.  As a matter of fact, I am now placing the fabled Peruvian Jinx upon the Yankees right now.  Bear with me a moment.....  ....there we go.  All jinxed up.  I'd like to see them win the east now.  Ahhh, who am I kidding.  The Yankees have a 7.5 game lead in the east and never ever in their entire history have they not won their division when their lead was 6 or more games.  Not once.  God couldn't win the east as long as Steinbrenner is alive.  Fortunately for God, he controls whether Suckbrenner lives or dies.  C'mon Lord, I know you're a Red Sox fan, let's have some locusts or something!  Little rain of fire, maybe.  Hell with it.  If the Red Sox couldn't win last year, there is no way they do this year.  I bet they finish 3rd in the east this year behind the God Damn Devil Rays.  All I'm managing to do is piss myself off even more.  At least when I play MVP Baseball on the X-Box the Sox win 130 games a season.  I'm going to go cry myself to sleep.

        Quiznos: Mecca Of Sandwiches   The Sandwiches are so good that I want to curl up next to one in bed and make sweet sweet love to it.  Have you ever had a sandwich so good that you wanted to copulate with it?  Probably not.  But hey, like Joey, I enjoy sandwiches a great deal.  It's kind of hard to follow sandwich fucking with anything relevant.  My buddy Adam and I have been having a conversation, via email, for the past week and I thought I would share it with you.  It will show you the level we operate on and it will also probably disturb you a little bit, but if you're not used to that by now, then I suggest you re-read everything in the archives and reflect upon it.  As per your request:   Adam:  "...by the way Nick, I had a really funny dream where I stuck your face in a boiling vat of cheese.  Shoulda been there.  (well, I guess you kinda were)"   Nick:  "Boiling vat of cheese? Are you mad at me?"   Adam:  "No, because in the dream it didn't sear your face or anything, just an amusing thing to do."   Nick:  "Amusing for whom?  Did you ever read my blog the time I wrote about a dream I had with you?  Here I'll give you a link:  urlLink DREAM  It's not a dirty dream, although it did upset me.  This would have been February of this year."   Adam:  "Damn, Dude!  Next dream I have I'm wastin' your ass!  Of course I did have a dream once where I was Thanos and I killed everyone on the planet except a scientist (that I was planning on exploiting for knowledge), a fine blonde lady (that I was planning on exploiting for ass), and myself.  I was wasting people right and left in very creative ways: axes, swords, pistols, machineguns, grenades, snapping necks, pulling out spines, crushing skulls, etc.  Very long and exciting dream, since I had to kill nearly everyone.  So I guess it would have involved killing you indirectly."   Nick:  "I can only think of one person who would ever dream they were Thanos, and that person is you. You also realize that if you killed everyone except for the scientist and the blonde (and yourself, obviously) that you also killed The Hulk. Also I think you would get bored after awhile with only a scientist and a girl to talk to. You killed the Hulk, you bastard."   Adam:  "Oh contrare mon frare!  Who do you think that scientist was?  I never saw him hulk out, but I can believe. Oh by the way, later I killed the blonde by accident.  Fucked her to death.  I kinda felt bad about that."    Unfortuantely that is where the conversation stopped, and I'm not sure that fucking someone to death is really the way to end a post, but I got nothing else for you.  Thanos.  *sigh*

        Non-Stop Demand For Pitcher Leads To Belly-Itcher Strike.   Goddamn belly-itchers.  Always wanting  something.   They're like a bunch of fucking children.  Mind you they are not like a bunch of kids having sex.  I probably could have phrased that better, but it's too late now.  That whole paragraph could have never happened and I wouldn't be that upset.  If you haven't read Penny-Arcade from today, you should it's fucking hilarious.  Something about gigantic banners adorned with homosexuals.  Seriously funny.  I don't have much to say tonight, mostly becasue I'm pissed that I have to work on a Saturday for the first time in 3+ years.  It's really not that bad I suppose, lots of people work on Saturdays.  Plus we close at 7 so it's not like I have to work well into the night.  Fuck you, me!  Quit justifying things to yourself.  Sorry, I was talking to myself in those last two sentences.  Well I'm going to go watch Timeline for some fucking reason that I can't even begin to fathom.  Why does Hollywood make kick ass movies out of some novels (i.e. Harry Potter, LOTR, Shawshank Redemption) and manage to rape the corpse of every Michael Crichton book?  If I was Michael Crichton I would get all up in that ass and make sure some motherfucker did my novel justice.  With the possible exception of the first Jurassic Park movie (which I still have a beef with, but not as much as the others) every Michael Crichton book turned into a movie has been shit and he doesn't seem to care.  If I was Michael Crichton and someone was destroying my intellectual property so they could leverage a video game and a lunch box I would pike their head and the heads of their children along the driveway to my 20 million dollar estate as a warning to other parties interested in acquiring the rights to one of my novels in order to transition it to film.  Fucking savages.  That sentence about the heads was really long.  Fuck it, where's my propeller hat?

        Did You See The Banner Up Top?   I don't know what it says when you read this, but when I wrote it, the banner was urging me to help support girls' education in Asian countries. (Vietnam, Indonesia etc.)  Weirdest internet banner ever.  I havce been notified at work that I am the fix-it guy.  I have to fill in where I can.  I assume that this is because I am awesome at what I do, also it could be that I'm getting dicked around, but I genuinely don't believe that.  What this means is crazy shifts and split days off etc.  The good news is that when it's all said and done (in 6-8 weeks) I will get a new shift that is static and more than likely I'll get to pick it (and maybe where it's at, too)  So, I'll take my lumps.  The X-Games started tonight.  Moto-X, Street Skate and Vert Skate were (was?) tonight.  It was ill.  I'm am so totally street.  "But Nick, do you have any street cred?"  "Of course, I have two of them.  Fool."  Me and my two street creds rep the street for reals, though.  All the live-long day.  What the hell am I talking about?  Jesus.

        It Was Like The First Day Of School   So, today was my first day back to work.  And, as I say, It was like that first day back to school after summer break when you have a couple butterflies in the stomach until you see your buddies and then all is well again.  That's how today was.  As I said.  Multiple times.  I thought you should know that my feet got lazy while I was off.  It must have been all that sitting on my ass.  Stupid lazy feet.  They hurt.  Actually I'm beat.  Like a back-talking housewife.  Ugh.  On a brighter note, my Dad is getting Direct TV installed this week with the NFL Total Package (not Lex Luger) So I can watch freaking football until my eyes bleed.  It's going to be so sweet.  Sweet like the nectar of a flower grown with the tears of Angels.  Anyway, I think I'm going to hit the sack after I watch Baseball Tonight in a couple minutes.  Until tomorrow, my fair peeps.

        Monday, August 2nd   I thought I would tell you the date, just in case you are an idiot or you forgot.  I have been playing alot of NFL 2K5 recently.  As always, I enjoy a good football game.  I am sitting here, last day of my vacation, talking to you when I should be out experiencing life, watching children smile and seeing the world around me.  But no.  I am here, in my underwear, just woke up an hour ago trying to push through this post so I can play video games and later, when Grant gets off work, we're going to play Yu-Gi-Oh! The Card Game.  My life is a nonstop roller coaster of excitement.  Also my birthday was a few days ago.  What did you get me?  Maybe I'm just upset becasue I have to go back to work tomorrow, which isn't bad in and of itself, however I have to work second shift Tuesday thru Saturday - what's that about?  I was under the impression that 7 year employess got the schedule they wanted.  Oh well.  I'm an going to leave you with a bit of advice.  It's something that my Dad taught me and that his Dad taught him, and now I am giving it to you.  It goes a little something ah-like this:  Never stick your weiner in a fan of any sort.  It will never work out well for your weiner or the fan, especially not your weiner.  My dad never taught me that, by the way.  I had to learn the hard way.
