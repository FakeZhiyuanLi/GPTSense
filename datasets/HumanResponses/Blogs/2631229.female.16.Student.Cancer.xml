      ^NeVeReNdiNg SnOw^  i keep living in the neverending snow he gave me....... so that the dreams i once shared with him will never melt........ even though we are now in different world........ the snow we experience is always the same....... hope that one another will not be cold as the weather snows..... is that so......  that we are now in different realms ..... that my tears will not flow..... is this what you hope....... then what for...... your future is bright and clear..... but my...... covered with fog that doesn't wanna disappear........ reasons for clinging on the things that is in the past....... is just that hoping it will come back once more....... to clear the fog that block us from carrying on....... naive is what you will say....... but hope that dreams will never fade........ so i can be in your arms once more........ in the neverending snow...........
