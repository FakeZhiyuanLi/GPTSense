        *sigh* sitting drinking jones berry lemonade. tastes kinda like blue moonmist. chillin with rach, larry, and everyone at u play. walking to breakplace to get a yummy doughnut and other yummy stuff. going and buying large amounts of candy at king soopers. wondering how they came up with a stupid name like king soopers for a grocerie store. singing songs while wondering and going on and on about the things that we both love and hate. it's great. really...it is! ok, and here's what it said on the cap of my jones...the coming month shall bring winds of change in your life. the funny thing is, thats true. new school, for the most part new ppl, etc. hope there good changes tho. but a lot has been happening. i really don't have regrets tho. about anything. the only regret i have is letting myself get to the breaking point. becuase i know i should have done things sooner than i have, but hey, atleast there getting done right. and i have found something. ya know how ppl say that everyone in the world has a twin or whatever? well i think that ppl have the same personalities. some ppl. and i think it's weird when you get to know the 2 ppl with the same personalities bc you kinda know what will happen. it's strange. but o well. i'll shut up now and go enjoy my jones...yummy!

       You'd think that i care about how much people hate me. but i don't. You'd also think that i'd care about how much they don't get it. But i don't. Hey, i can't control what people do and i have learned that. no matter how hard you try to make people see things it's not going to work out. Being selfless pays off about as much as being selfish is, which is not all that great. I guess you need to find a happy medium. There's something that my dad always tells me and i think that it is very true and i will never forget it. ~Smart people learn from there mistakes, while wise people learn from other ppls mistakes~  I know people who are neither smart nor wise. I have tried to help them, but my attempts were unsuccessful. They are blind to all the good things all for attention. I know, it's a really great thing to do. I am really sick of not just doing things for myself. Little by little i'm getting better, but no one takes the time to see my point of things. People don't listen to me all that much. I can only take so much before i break down, and get sick of it all. do things i should have done months before. but then there are still things that u can't handle, and for me it's an undescribable emotion. it's where you feel inside like you want to break down in tears, yet you can't. and the anger and carelessness that is present in me, is magnified a million times more that usual. The thoughts of wanting to spill everything to someone, but the right person you are yet to find. it eats at you every moment. you see, i can bitch and complain to people non stop, and i can lecture you and try to help you until my voice goes out. but none of that will do any good. I am done helping and i am done confiding in other people and i am done being sympathetic. becuase i've had my share of bad things happen, and the people who do nothing but make the bad things happen, aren't worth keeping. because you can try to tell them a million times how there going to lose all there friends, and how there going to make things a lot worse for themselves, and how there going to drive everyone away, but it doesn't mean that they will listen. so live life to it's fullest because you only get one chance to live. and to everything bad that happens, try to find something good to come out of it. This will be my last peice of advice becuase i'm done helping people who are too wrapped up in themselves to listen.
