      So, the roommate and I had a bit of dinner party on Saturday.  Fun times, despite my dislike for Indian food.  Lots of wine consumed.  God, when did I become someone who hosts dinner parties and serves wine in nice glasses with little rings on the bottom so no one gets confused about whose glass is whose???  Yes.  We own those rings.  Two sets, actually. This brings me to today's topic.  Red wine.  Personally, I'm not a fan.  I tend to like cold drinks, so red wine and I are not so much on the friendship thing.  (Ah, Pinot Grigio)  Whatever- to each his own.  Anyway, my issue is with red wine.  The Red Wine Smile in particular.  I have not experienced this phenomenon myself, but I've seen many friends fall prey.  Nothing like hanging out with your girl and then she turns and smiles and it looks like she's smeared blueberry paste all over her grill.  This is not attractive.  It doesn't happen to everyone, just people with porous teeth or something.  If it happened to me, however, I would refuse red wine in public.  Or at least the second, third and fourth glasses.  Or maybe bring a travel toothbrush.   So everyone, please be aware of your status in terms of the Red Wine Smile.  If your teeth start to look slightly gray or blue (more advanced): PUT DOWN THE GLASS.  Brush your teeth and immediately switch to a gin and tonic.

      I'm not going to go through a whole "This is who I am" bullshit entry. You'll see who I am soon enough. I have an unusually large family, most of which I detest. I find the humor in even the darkest (or lightest) situation. Case in point. One of my younger half-sisters is 5 months pregnant. She's probably my most disliked sibling- by everyone in the family. So her baby shower was this past weekend. First of all, who has a shower at 5 months. (I said she's my sister, but I never claimed she was wise to the ways of the world like me. I know about things like showers.) She has a baby-daddy. An illiterate baby-daddy. An illiterate baby-daddy with 4 other children. An illiterate baby-daddy with 4 other children who can't work because of a "back problem". (I don't buy it.) ANYWAY... we were all sort of against her having this baby. Our reasoning doesn't matter. We just see her as a burden on the family (which she is) and she is not in the best position to jump into motherhood, i.e. no job, still in college, no place to live among others. As my dad prepared to go to the shower (which my mother and I refused to attend) I suggested to my mother that there was no need to purchase a gift. I pulled a hanger out of the closet and said "just wrap this up." That's me. Welcome to my world. Oh, don't think I don't know it's awful. I shock myself with the shit that comes out of my mouth sometimes. I'm the person that says what you think. Or says what you only wish you could come up with. Stick around. It will only get funnier.

      Why do I love bad 90's R&B and Hip Hop?  Not that most people don't, but I have a HUGE affinity.  A friend just gave me a cd with Ditty by Paperboy.  Remember that song?  So good.  Still makes me want to shake my ass.  Return of the Mack, Got Me Waitin'.  The list goes on.   The music was bad.  The clothes worse, but I can't help loving the tunes of my youth.  How about Ace of Base?  Music was so simple and innocent. I was looking at my high school yearbooks (yeah, I'm a dork) a few weeks back and I realized just how much things have changed.  No one was wearing belly shirts.  We wore lots of men's clothes.  Big polo shirts, flannels, tapered jeans.  Flared jeans, what?  Thong, what?  This was the time of short sequined prom dresses, K Swiss sneakers, gold charm necklaces, long flowered skirts paired with combat boots and babydoll dresses.  I never realized that the fashions were so bad.  I realized the 80's were bad, but now when I look back, times have really changed.  Take a peek at an early episode of 90210.  They were the height of fashion and now it's absolutely horrendous.  God, and I'm only 25.  What will I be saying at 35?  Remember when we used to wear pants outside???  Who can be bothered covering your lower half???

      So, I've had two occassions in the past few days that make me question marriage.  I am all for it, but wonder if the reality is anywhere near the theory... This past weekend I was out with J and two of his male friends.  Male friend, D., I have met a few times.  He's always been pleasant and nice and really funny.  He's had J. invite me to a cookout.  He's going to hook me up with HBO for free.  Overall, we like him.  Other male friend, M., I met for the first time on Saturday.  Nice guy.  Kind of quiet. So flash foward a few beers and M. is grinding me.  Then proceeds to touch my ass ALL night, everytime I walk past him.  Granted, I'm a flirt and don't react negatively to the attention, but M. has a serious live-in girlfriend.  He spent a good portion of the night trolling for women, "J. let's go look for girls."  J. explained to me that guys just like to know that they can still flirt and get attention.  Whatever.  It was pathetic if you ask me. Even worse, though, was D.  D. was ALL over me.  I'm talking all over me.  Now, I know this was so wrong, but I ended up kissing him.  Lots of beer and high hormones and bad judgement all allowed it to happen.  I think what bothered me was that he kept saying "If you can keep it a secret, I'm going to call you."  So sleazy.  Trying to get me to spend the night with him. That's example 1.5. J. called me last night to tell me about his evening at work.  He's serving at some yacht club for the summer.  Long story short, some lady got wasted at her company party there and was hitting on him.  Bad.  Bad as in she went to the bathroom and took off her pantyhose, then came out and told him.  In front of her coworkers.  Turns out she's waiting for him outside when he gets off.  They make small talk and then she proceeds to grab his neck to kiss him and his crotch.  He gave her the cheek and pulled her hand off of him.  She then told him that "if it's going to happen, it's got to be tonight" because her husband is out of town.  Yup, that's right.  Her husband.  How gross.  He was disgusted and basically left her there.  Come on.  Makes me afraid to get married.  I don't know this woman, but I know D. and I know that he pledges to be so in love with his fiance.  Scary.

      What a whirlwind weekend!  I can't remember having so much fun in the recent past.  It's good to finally be out and making my own friends, rather than going around with a crew that's not my crew.  Wild.  I love being the only girl with a bunch of guys.  I'm such a flirty flirt and love the attention.  Although, sometimes engaged guys give too much attention.  And sometimes I have too much beer to keep myself in check.  One kiss won't end the world. J and I had an interesting evening.  Glad he's a friend now.  It was weird there for a bit, but I think we're on the same page in terms of what we want and there are no weird attachments because of anything that has happened. Let's talk about sex for a minute.  Is sex like pizza?  Our sex was mediocre at best, as predicted.  I knew from prior hookups that it wasn't going to rock me and it didn't.  It was nice, but I think I've been spoiled by having great sex for a period of time.  Do I want to make this a regular thing even though it's only OK?  I mean, it's not like I couldn't get it somewhere else, but at least I know him, where he's coming from and where I stand.  Maybe it would be better next time. Got a wild story from L. this weekend.  She answered a W4W ad on  urlLink craigslist  and actually went on a date.  No, she's not gay.  Crazy.  She ended up doing "everything you can do" with this girl.  I was all "YOU ATE BOX???!!!"  She laughed, and said yes.  Outrageous.  I am so down with lesbians- I think it's fascinating.  I just couldn't see myself actually doing it.  She said the whole time she was waiting for a filling though.  Not satisfied, but happy with the experience.  Good for her.   Completely off topic- why are avocados SOOO good but so bad for you.  I could eat them all day.  I love them.  Salad with avocados.  And ice cream.  Love  urlLink ice cream .  I think I'm hungry. I need some music ideas.  My iPod wants more.  Any thoughts?  Anyone?  Someone?

      I finally joined all the hipsters, yuppies and spoiled teenagers in iPod land.  iLove it.  While it is making me insane to have to download EVERY FREAKIN CD iOwn, I know it will be worth it.  I am rocking out to Brandy's original album.  Oh, yes, the one from like 1992.  Not that great of music, but I have fond memories tied to it.  I'm one of those people that has a hard time letting go of music.  And now that i'M cool, iAm sure that iWill resurrect lots of stuff, and even listen to cd's iHave owned for a long time, but never really listened to.  So, even though I spent so much money yesterday that iWon't be doing anything fun for the rest of the summer, at least iWill have good music in my little Somerville apartment.  iRecommend that you get one, too.

      Has anyone seen this show?  A friend at work insisted I need to see it.  What a freak show.  It's almost p-orn (I'm saying barely a step back from what you'll see on Scinemax)- there are naked butts, guys pumping girls with their legs in the air.  Insane.  It's also quite possibly the worst acting in all the world.  Next to Speed, my all time most hated movie of all time.  The one guy actually said "The world is our oyster and we're going to suck this bitch down with a champagne chaser."  I have to wonder if the writers know how bad it is and the show is a mockery of itself.  I just hope so.  One of the characters (the one who slept with 3 different women in this episode) is actually pretending to be the father to a black child.  Weird.

      Since joining  urlLink Netflix  a few months back, I’ve seen SO many movies and I guess this is as good a place as any to share my opinions on them.  Without further ado, my thoughts on a few things I’ve seen/heard/read of late.  The new  urlLink Beastie Boys  album rocks my world.  I was a bit unsure the first time I listened, but after a few run-throughs I was sold.  I guess I was expecting something a bit funkier like Hello Nasty, but the boys seem to have taken it back to their rap roots a bit more.  Overall, I give it an A-.  If you’re a true fan, you will love it.  I just saw  urlLink Requiem for a Dream .  Damn.  Yeah, I know I’m about four years too late, but still.  Wow.  I love the cinematography.  Rather than just showing them shoot up, you felt like you were right in there.  The story was sad but engaging.  I only wish I had known a bit more about the characters before this all started.  I’ll give it a B+.  Still reading  urlLink Anna Karenina by Tolstoy (translated by Constance Garnett).  And, no, I didn’t pick it up because Oprah told me to- I started it long before I heard she had recommended it.  It’s a great story, but I think my translation needs a bit of help.  Garnett uses the word “ironically” a lot.  I mean, really how often does something ironic happen.  She writes things like “She smiled at him ironically.”  How exactly do you smile ironically?  I find myself being really annoyed with Anna, almost to the point of wanting to put the book down.  She's cool and strong in the beginning, but after leaving her husband to be with Vronsky, she gets all crazy possessive and it's so frustrating.  Poor guy, I want to scream at her for him.  Book gets an A, translation gets a C.  I also watched  urlLink The Magdalene Sisters  last week.  Great movie.  I’ll tell you, I have a tough time staying awake through movies the first time.  Just a bad habit of mine.  I was totally pulled in by this one.  It’s a story set in 1960’s Ireland, in a laundry for wayward women.  Girls are sent to this laundry for 1. being raped, 2. looking at boys, and 3. having a baby out of wedlock.  It’s sad and fascinating and hard to believe that it really happened and that these laundries actually existed until 1996!  I’ll give this one an A-.

      Yes, it's official. The bling is blingin and I now officially have a million dollar smile. I love my toof. I woke up so eager to get it this morning- almost Christmas type excitement.  I know it's not a cool as those rappers' teefs all blingin and shinin in the front, but I'm like the undacova brudder rockin the gold to the back. Happiness is always carrying a tiny savings account in your mouth. What's that? No money for rent this month? Don't worry, we can knock out my go' toof and take care of it.  Smiling the smile of the in crowd,  K to the B

      So I was off the man-hunt for a few months.  Had a date here and there, but was intentionally easing up a bit.  Those days are now over and I am back in full effect.  Kind of.  I been out with exactly one guy and I think I'm off the market.  He's delightful.  Mature, secure and pretty much everything I'm looking for.  We've seen each other or talked on the phone everyday since we first met and it's only picking up momentum.  I will leave it at that for fear of jinxing it.  Oh, wait.  One more thing.  He watched the dog show on ESPN with me last night.  And he wasn't just doing it.  He liked it.  I like him.

      Another one of those whirlwind weekends.  I had a 4th of July party weekend that I always imagined to be possible, but hadn't ever been part of.  The weather was right, the people even more right and the beer perfect.  Saw J. again and had a really great time hanging with him and his two friends.*  We made it through the whole day/evening with no weirdness from the prior week's adventures.  Then it was late and we were full of beer and fireworks and watched a little p0rn and off we went.  It wasn't even good p0rn.  He definitely upped the weirdness factor afterwards, though.  We need to not do it again if we want to keep our friendship.  I don't have any burning feelings for him, but I could see us dating.  We get along and enjoy each other and the sex was much better this time.  Who knows?  I do know that it's weird that I'm the one who's like "why can't we just be f buddies?" because that's all I want and he's the one worried about feelings.  Funny.  I don't think he appreciated me telling him that I'm not on the pill.  I guess that's not great pillow talk. I finally met M. after several evenings on the phone.  Such a great guy.  Really someone I could get to know and be into.  He has a perfect sense of humor- he's a lot like me in that sense.  He loves animals.  He's laid back, which would be a great counter to me, since I tend to not always be so laid back.  We'll see if he calls.  The only thing he said about me that I got out of Liz was that he thinks "I'm awesome" and "really fun."  Whatever that means.    *  His two friends were women that he teaches with.  An older and a younger.  After the fireworks, as we were sitting on J's. porch, the younger one announces "If Bob (fiance) were here, he'd call us porch monkies."  I almost threw up.  I was sitting there, feeling trapped.  What do you do when someone says something awful and so apparently doesn't know?  I sat there for a few min. (as she said it twice more) and J. looked at me and said "Are you OK?"  I just got up and walked around back and sat for a bit, trying to figure out what to do.  A few minutes later she came running back, full of apologies.  I knew she meant it, so all I said was "You should tell your fiance not to say that anymore because it's not funny."  J. came back a few minutes later to check on me.  Such a good guy.  I went back out and picked up where I'd left off- no sense in ruining the night.  There you go, though.  Ignorance is killer.  Oh, please check out this  urlLink tshirt site .  SO FUNNY.
