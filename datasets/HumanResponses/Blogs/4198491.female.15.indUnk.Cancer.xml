      I had soccer practice today for only about and hour and a half. What an improvement! After practice we packed up our car and drove to Ithaca to drop my brother off at college. We found his room and I met his roomate Jason who plays bass guitar which is really cool since some of my friends and I have been trying to start a band for awhile now. I'm gunna play electric guitar. We unpacked all of David's things and set up his computer. He brought about 10 pictures to put up, 8 of which were of him and Meg, not counting his picture of them on his desktop on his computer and the one of Meg as the background pic on his cellphone. It's like he's afraid he'll forget what she looks like or something. I dunno....When we left my mom was sobbing her eyes out and wanted to leave right away. So, cue the long boring drive back. Yawn. I got home and I talked to David online and he sounded pretty sad actually. I felt bad for him but I'm sure it'll get a lot better. I think college would be kinda fun having ur own room and roomate and all that stuff. Especially if ur not too far awway from home so u can go home a lot when u get homesick. Well, this is the beginning of my life as an only child. Oh joy.

      Yesterday was the crappiest day of my life. Oh joy. I woke up that morning from one of the most horrible dreams of my life. I dreamed that my mom died. My mom and I are really close and it was the worst I've ever felt. So, I was really relieved when I woke up! I couldn't find my iPod and I thought I seriously lost it. My dad and I spent hours searching through the whole house until my dad found it under the seat in my mom's car. My brother took it thinking that it was his. Then I had to find my shinguards in the attic for today's soccer tryouts. It is so frickin hot up there and there is so much crap. It was horrible. I never did find them so I had to wear some old shinguards from a couple years ago that don't really fit me anymore. I'm so exahausted from running so much in soccer! I did get to use my brother's new computer for college but or only like 15 minutes and then I got kicked off. Well, now that you're all in such good moods I'll leave you now.

      Last night I slept over with my grandma in her new senior citizen apartment. She is moving in gradually and is trying to sell her house now. We only had a couple pieces of furniture there so I slept on the floor in my sleeping bag. We had a tiny t.v. that didn't have cable but it was actually fun! That place goes dead quiet by like 8:00 and you hardly see anyone all day. I told my grandma she needs to liven up the place and host some parties in her apartment. We went to different stores to get random things for her place and thats basically all i"ve done today.  Tomorrow is when I go to Fair Haven with Mary and osme other people. It should be tons of fun and I'll be there all weekend. My dad has to fix my bike cuz the chain keeps falling off orr something. It's wierd. Oh well, I guess thats it. So long!

      hey everyone. i changed my journal to here because I didnt like the other place. kinda confusing and all. Well, on sunday I went to my friend's sleepover b-day party and hardly slept at all. The next day I had my physical so I can play soccer in the fall. I was so tired and I was sick too. I lost my voice at the party and I sounded pretty funny! Well, this moring I caught up on sleep by sleeping till 1:30 in the afternoon. This weekend I'm going to Mary's camp thingfor the weekend. It's in New Haven and I think it's her grandparents house. ANyway its on a lake and it should be tons of fun! I cant wait! Robin is off in Scotland for her dance camp and I really miss her a lot. We talk on the phone a lot but its not the same.
