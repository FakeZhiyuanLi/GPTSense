      For those not in the know, I am doing a project for Dunkin' Donuts on weekday mornings, where they are serving coffee to audience members of the CBS Early Show.  I make sure that every single person I can coerce into holding a DD cup of coffee has one when the cameras are rolling.  This job is outside, in the cold, where the weatherman films some of his segments.  The audience is made up of passerbys who think it would be neat to be on TV for a 30-second weather segment.  Well, this week's brush with fame would be me serving coffee to gold-medal winner Sarah Hughes.  (During the last few weeks of the project, the pervious celebreties include the Grinch [trying real hard to steal Christmas] and the Salvation Army Band.)  The Grinch.  See?  I am makeing the right contacts to advance in the world of business! So there!   urlLink I'm a mean one...

      While blog-surfing, I came across  urlLink this news item :   The local news on WAMU-FM tonight had a followup story about the Virgin Atlantic pilot arrested the other day for showing up drunk for his run from Dulles to London. Today the pilots' union posted bail for him. According to the story, they had requested he be released without bail, but the judge refused, saying the pilot was a flight risk.  A flight risk! BAHAHA!   Yes, I do find great humor in that.   urlLink Learning to Fly

      Another George Bush blunder.  And this comes from someone who has seen firsthand the jobs in question.  GB wants to give  urlLink illegal alien workers legitimacy .  But one of his arguments in support of his plan is actually much stronger an argument that this is indeed wrong.   “Illegal entry across our borders makes more difficult the urgent task of securing the homeland,” he said.   But wouldn't the act of ENCOURAGING more of them to come be multiplying the problem?  The only encouraging part: the intent to  provide incentives to entice those workers to go back to their homelands.   But this is in the form of Social Security benefits, which, last time I looked, was not the most stable system to begin with and probably can't handle the higher output...   urlLink This is why I'm a registered Democrat

      I'm exhausted and need to go to bed.  It's been a long day.  But first, a thought.  When I was younger (maybe 11, 12, 13) I remember that I would have some sort of an imposed bedtime, and of course, I was never actually tired yet.  I had so much more energy then...  and I would lie awake in bed for the longest time, sometimes more than an hour, daydreaming.  First, I'll say that some of my daydreams put my actual dreams to shame.  Let's not forget I'm talking about my middle school years here, which were, ahem, quite hormonal.  (Just a bit.)  While some of those thoughts still remain,  urlLink at least in a much more mature sense , I realized tonight that I miss that energy.  As much as laying down to sleep, and being so darn exhausted that I fall out soon after, may sound very appealing to those in the crowd, I miss those moments of thought.  I very rarely get a chance to daydream during the day.  If I try to close my eyes and imagine a different life, chances are, I'll crash my car and end up in the hospital, because when I'm driving is one of the few times of the day I (sometimes) have to myself.   As I write this, I am remembering some of those daydreams.  I think I'll try to go to bed early tomorrow and relive them.    urlLink Don't dream it's over

      Here's one tradition that needs to be changed.  I'm sure at least SOME of you agree.  When driving a car on Sunday, especially in Bergen County, New Jersey, it seems to be an unwritten rule that you must drive at least 15 MPH slower than on any other day.    The thought process, I assume, is as follows: "Even though *I* don't have anything important to do at this moment, I must ignore the fact that the 15 cars lined up behind me, waiting for me to get out of the way, probably *DO*."  To quote Weird Al: "I hope you die a painful death; I hope you choke on your next breath."   urlLink I can't drive 55...  (and yes, I know  urlLink I've used that line for an e-mail link before .

      My friend  urlLink Louis  talks about his visit to Starbucks, and as I visit another location of the same name today, I have another thought.  Starbucks overpays its workers, and also pushes barrels of benefits towards these counter-jockeys (free coffee, 401k, stock options, and in some markets, I'm sure a night on the town with J-Lo can be arranged).  So, could you please explain to me why the customers, who are paying $5 a drink, are throwing pounds and pounds of coins (and bills) into the tip jars next to the cash registers?  I'm not sure what employees staff the Rosecrans location of which Louis is sitting at right now, but at the  urlLink Rt 4, Englewood  location, the only employees that aren't illegal aliens with limited English seem to work only 2 hours a week.  That said, I enjoyed my Quad, Iced Venti, Skim, with whip, White Chocolate mocha today.  But on top of the $4.98 I paid (tax included), I couldn't justify a gratuity.

      Okay, wisdom tooth #2 has been removed.  It had arrived in the mounth with a cavity already in it, and at such an awful angle that it needed to come out.  Speaking of the sangle, you know, it's never really a good sigh when your dentist says things like"Oh, wow!" and "There's something you don't see all the time!" while peering into your mouth.  (I really don't like to hear that from most medical professionals.  It's just nervewracking.)  Today is another catch-up day.  I'm sitting down to write a letter to an old high-school classmate I haven't seen in years.  He sent me a Christmas card, and I wrote him back immediately, saying, "Here's a quick hello, and I'll write a detailed letter soon."  Two months later... well, better late than never, I say.  I am unofficially on vacation right now.  As I stated before, I let myself go from my old job for the new business, but left a couple of weeks in between.  Part of it was frustration with the old job -- one more day, and I would have shot someone.  But also, it's giving me a chance to get my stuff together.  I've cleaned parts of my residence that haven't been uncovered in years.  I've (almost) finished my taxes, minus the little sidebar of needing to actually pay them.  And unearthed this card from this friend, reminding me that I needed to get off my ass and write a letter.  Oh, yeah, how about a picture.   urlLink A blurry picture of me  from my Florida vacation.

      While visiting my friend in Florida, we went to Disney World.  The main park, the Magic Kingdom, is so horribly crowded, it wasn't funny.  For crying out loud, it was a TUESDAY.  There's no excuse for some rides to have estimated wait times of over 2 hours!!!  The cool part was a seperate facility (with, of course, a seperate cover charge) called DisneyQuest.  Five floors, filled with old school video games, virtual reality experiences, and any cool video game or skill game or driving game made!  For $31, unlimited access, um.... WOW.  I If I did the math on how many quarters I would have put into these machines, I know I came out ahead.  Back to Magic Kingdom.  The last time I was there, I was 5.   I think if I had gotten on one of the lines back then, I might just be getting on the ride today.

Last week,  urlLink I talked about  a book I was reading,  Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution , by Steven Levy.  A history of the evolution of the personal computer, until about 1983.  This week, I've started to read it's followup.  Mr. Levy also wrote about the development of the Macintosh from 1983 to 2000, in  Insanely Great .  It's no big secret, and it's in the earlier post, but I'm not a big fan of the Macintosh, at least as a computer user.  But I won't deny it's place in history.  While it may not have gone down exactly as acted in the movie  Pirates of Silicon Valley , yeah, Mr. Gates did steal the concept, at least in part, from the gullible fools at Apple, when he designed Windows.  The irony, of course, is that when you read in Hackers about Mr. Gates, he started early on a crusade to stop people from pirating an early program he wrote (a BASIC interpreter) and even today uses copy protection on his products which is so annoying to the customers, modern hackers write cracks not only to get free software but to make software tolerable for legitimate users.    That in itself isn't a new concept - annoying copy protection.  Having to read  urlLink vague symbols  from a paper, as in Leisure Suit Larry 5, was one thing, but other games that did the same, adding red-tinted glasses to the mix, as in Maniac Mansion, made these games awful to play, even though the designers thought that they were "enhancing game play".  Back on topic, however, even though I will never willingly own a Macintosh computer, I do respect some of the technological advancements it brought about, although I'm still of a mixed mind whether it was a good idea to make a computer for the idiots in the room (sorry, "Computer for the rest of us") as opposed to the power-users who used the more powerful PC's.  Now that any Tom, Dick, and Harry can use a computer, there's more crap in the world, like the Hamster Dance web site.  More later.

       urlLink Kill Mom But Don't Hurt TV, Teen Tells Hitman   It's nice to know that today's youth have their priorities in order.  I'm reminded of a quote from comedian George Carlin:  "Do what you will with the girl, but leave me alone!"

      I'm currently re-reading a book that's been on my shelf for years,  urlLink Hackers  by Steven Levy.  It's a history of the evolution of the personal computer from the mid-1950's through the days when the Apple ][ was in power; the edition of the book I own was written on such a machine, as noted by the author.  In re-reading the book I previously read at age 16, I'm coming to new appreciation for the origins of the computer culture, and learning the etymology of words that are used every day now, such as the word munged (from "Mash Until No Good", used with telephone systems engeneering parts).  I've lost a lot of the computer-science nerdiness that followed me through high school; and even today the average 16-year-old probably has a better idea of what the current fastest cprocessor is out there and how many small fries they'll have to sell at Mickey-d's in order to upgrade the lousy hunk-o-junk they currently own.  But I'm still fascinated in the history.  One of my regular blog readings is  urlLink Dan Sandler , whom I have observed (read: stalked) since he established a web presence back in the early-to-mid 90's.  To set the stage: I was the operator of the school's BBS system, and had access to the internet through a friend who developed an early version of an ISP.  (Not many 15 year-olds had free internet access, let alone any idea what the internet was back then.)  He's become my doorway to the other side -- after all, I grew up and programmed on the PC, the obvious choice for the analytical, straight-collar thinker.  He's a Mac addict, which has long been the choice of the creative person.  When I was 12 and older, the only satisfied Mac users I ever met were either musicians. graphic designers, or layout professionals.  Everyone else at the time preferred the competition.    Dan's blog regualrly links to  urlLink Apple folklore  sites, with easter egg tidbits of the development  of the Mac and it's relatives.  I've gained a newfound respect for a computer I refuse to own; I'll nevr have one, but I appreciate all the hard work and energy that went into it.  What's the modern lingo?  Oh, yes: don't hate the playaz, hate the game.  Actually, I like the game, just not the end result.

      After today, I've lost all respect for human nature.  When leaving a department store today, I came upon a child in the parking lot who had become seperated from his mother.  His name was Shana, and was no more than 4 years old.  He was in the parking lot, crying that he wanted his mommy.    After talking to him for a moment, I took him inside the store in order to help find his mother.  I approached the cashier, and asked her to page security because I had found a lost child.  She shrugged, and then went to complete a personal conversation she was having.  I became insistant, and she finally complied.  Security came, and we talked with the child and comforted him.  Eventually, the mother was found, and this part was worst of all.  The mother was less concerned about the child than we were.  She didn't even ask the child if he was okay or what happened.  I would have done the same thing again, no matter what, but it hurt me a little that only the head of security said "Thank you".  The mother did not say this to myself or the security staff.  That child deserves better than this woman as a mother.  But I am grateful for the chance to help this child, if only for a short while.

      I've seen more than one mention of this group:  urlLink Harry and the Potters .  Indie acoustic rock recordings of various themes in the four HP books.  Now, I'm not ashamed to admit that I like the books (the geek in me still loves fantasy), but I'm not a musical or creative sort.  If only I had thought of this idea first -- theyve been playing schools and libraries, and I understand they've sold a handful of their CD's...  Er... bless that American business spirit!

       “[SUV's] are not cars which people should be using in London. They’re bad for London and they’re totally unnecessary. They’re largely a status symbol. If you’ve got that much money to spend, you could spend it on a better holiday. I would.”   - London Mayor Ken Livingstone in  urlLink this news item .  I find it incredible that with so many people who have come to their senses about the wastes of money this vehicles are, so many people still insist on buying them.     Part of the paradox of American energy use, which Roberts neatly traces, is that as we get more efficient, we respond to that trend by consuming more.   - Paul Roberts in  "The End of Oil: On the Edge of a Perilous New World.", as quoted in a  urlLink Salon  article.  Of course,  urlLink this picture  says everything you need to know.

      I need something to read.  For those who haven't figured it out yet, I am one of those nerds who actually read in school (although, rarely my school books).  Lately, I've been in a fantasy/sci-fi mode, including the almighty  urlLink Terry Pratchett  and his  Discworld series  of novels; a friend of his,  urlLink Neil Gaiman , who is known by many for his comic work, but I much prefer books like  Neverwhere ; lastly, I have gotten around to reading all of the  Harry Potter  books by  urlLink J.K. Rowling , being sure to do so before the third movie comes out.  Now, given this selection of authors -- does anyone have a good suggestion on where to go next?

      Lots of mini-updates for today...    First off, to follow up on the awesome  urlLink Mario Brothers  movies, how about to  urlLink Harry Potter  fan-made films?  The t-shirts they have are rather awesome as well -- support the site if you can!  Bother.  As for web sites, I found a lot of content from the adventure game site that I was an editor on 5 years ago; while the site and it's background code were (mostly) lost to me being poor and web hosting costing actual money, I am working on restoring some of my favorite (and web-exclusive) content...  the old site, thanks to the Wayback Machine... [ urlLink 1999 ] [ urlLink 2000 ].  My proudest moment?   urlLink An interview with Al Lowe .  I still have the cassettes this was recorded on somewhere.  Please feel free to yell at me or abuse me  urlLink by e-mail , my gmail account has 999MB of the total 1000MB available, so bring it on!  (And if you're an artist, all the better, because anyone who has seen my past artwork (see adventure pages linked above) knows that I'll need some help bringing the content to a modern audience....)

      The upside to all these priest molestation lawsuits?  All the wonderful settlement money that is returning to the taxable economy.  While there is an understandable reason for it, it's still a shame that the church doesn't pay tax.

      Last night I saw a beautiful sight... flying in a jetBlue aircraft, from Florida to JFK, I was able to watch the fireworks out the left and right windows of the plane, as well as on the TV in front of me.    So where have I been?  Besides "2 inches from a nervous breakdown", I was in Florida for the better part of last week, playing the role of Best Man at my best friend's wedding.  Only he would have a wedding in Florida on what had to be the most humid day of the year, and the day before a holiday.  Boy, was that air travel fun.  (Can't you hear the sarcasm from here?)  But it was indeed a beautiful ceremony and reception, and although I did the traditional job of telling my friend that given the chance, I would have stepped into his shoes, truly they were made for each other.  (Hopefully, someone forgot how to make any more of them, though.)
