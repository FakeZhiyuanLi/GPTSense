      well hello there this is my first post, and i guess i should mention my name and stuff like that there.  My name is Scott Banks, and i'm 24 in about a month.  i just graduated from the university of Waterloo, BA, Honours Drama.  I'm a tech theatre student, NOT an actor.  um other than that i don't have much to say for now.   I watched Eurotrip last sunday, and holy shit is it funny...Scotty Doesn't Know by Lustra...GREAT song. lates for now Scott

      so I went to see Spiderman 2 with my awesome girlfriend Jennifer today.  holy shit, that movie rocked.  all the action of the first plus more, minus all the exposition background story crap (which granted had to be included for all the non-true believers like myself.)  Tobey Maguire delivered a standout performance as the nerdy, now-unhappy- with-his-life superhero.  Really brought the realness of the character out, so that he's not a 2-d cardboard cut out, but a real person that can be related to as he has real problems.  This has always been the genius of the Spiderman character.  James Franco as Harry Osborn, Pete's best friend, still trying to live up to the expectations of his father that he could never meet when Norman was alive was great.  and of course, last but DEFINITELY not least, is the always curvaceous, always beautiful, always good actress Kirsten Dunst as Spiderman/Peter Parker's love interest Mary Jane.  again, another great performance, with depth, grace and believability.   Also saw Harry Potter 3, also a great flick, with good performances all around.  These movies really bring the books to life.  the new director and the new dumbledore add to the movies, and don't detract from it, such as what happened with Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, when Joel Schumacher took over and totally changed the look and feel of the movies. as for The Day After Tomorrow, story was pretty good, the ending a bit of a deus ex machina, the effects were absolutely spectacular.  the flash freezing, the tidal wave attacking New York, the twisters ripping up LA...WOW. well that's all for now Scotty B
