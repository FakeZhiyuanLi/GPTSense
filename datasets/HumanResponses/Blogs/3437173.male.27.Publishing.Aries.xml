       Well, the first few posts I've desisted from telling the world about this little effort of mine. Now I've taken the plounge and let some people know. Let see what the response is (probably pretty minimal...).  Speaking of reading blogs, I have to put in a round of applause for  urlLink Bloglines , a syndicator for rss feeds so that you can see what blogs have been updated, without having to travel them all. Thanks guys!  -E

      Hi,  That's it - the weird book top N has a new #1:  urlLink "Tokyo doesn't love us anymore"  by Ray Loriga. The previous #1,  urlLink House of leaves , was weird because it had so many stories-in-stories and had such a twisted topic(s). "Tokyo ..." doesn't need all that - it just is completely disconnected (at least for two-thirds of the book). The story centers on an unnamed man in the near future, who sells oblivion by means of drugs. Of course he takes a healthy dose himselves every now-and-then (up to the extent where being clean for more than 3 hours is an event), which severely influences his ability to remember things. His lifestyle as a travelling salesman is in consumerist jungles around the world is dotted with anonymous sex, and unavoidably ( mini-spoiler ahead ) leads to  his downfall and commitment to a mental instution ( end of mini-spoiler ).  What makes this book so seriously weird is the truly disconnect way of writing, in accordance with the character's experiences, seemingly completely without story lines or goals. It looses in the second half, mainly because it all becomes clear where it's going to (if you hadn't guessed...), and the style becomes slightly boring.  All in all, definitely not a bad read. Don't pick it up if your suffering a depression, because it's not exactly a happy story. But an interesting read, it is.  -E

      First words incoherent molded into meaning into the mother tongue.  Painstaking years of development betrayed by different tongues.  To think it possible to think not in your mother tongue, to feel not in that speech of old but in some self-learned other tongue.  -E

      Isn't it amazing how even in the biggest turbulence you can find tranquility? It's like being on a small boat, tossed every way and up and down while all around is flying rage, you find it in yourself to smile and laugh about excitement. Like having lost all course, adrift, and feeling that's OK.  -E

      Thijs had a birthday party at his parents' place. Always inspiring, talking to like-minded people. On the way back created some scriblings, which I'll upload in a bit.  -E

      A first post always has something awkward. Nothing there, nothing to build on, no trends set. On the other hand, it _does_ allow you to give a feel for what's ahead. At the moment, I'm not sure what is ahead. I know I'ld like to use this platform to send some scriblings into the world, so that's what it's going to be, for now.  -E

      Had a weekend with lot's of  urlLink Thijs . On Friday evening, we (plus girlfriends) went to see  urlLink Under Byen , a little-known Danish band that came to play in Paradiso. Like Thijs said in  urlLink his post  about it, the sound system sucked and their set was way too short. This did little however to stop them from developing a weird, detached atmosphere.      (Image (c) 2004, Thijs Stalenhoef)   Definitely one of those should-have-been-there things, but if you manage to catch them on stage, don't miss it. Theirs is not a music that I like to listen to in the office (a bit too intense to make good wallpaper) but when traveling, or sitting down to listen music, yes.   On Saturday, the four of us made a trip to the east of the NL, to visit Florian in his new home and celebrate his birthday. Nice to see them again. Missed the first 90 minutes of the football, but it was still a very exciting match. Lots of people seem to be proud of the Dutch team again, though I wonder why. It was far too close a call (they won by margin of 1 penalty) for comfort...   On Sunday Thijs and I went for some geek tool shopping near the Amsterdam Arena (the football stadium). Thijs seized the opportunity to make some pictures, and I shot some of that, using my PhoneCam (tm).      -E

      Well, after much waiting, etcetcetc finally decided to get ADSL at home, too. Mostly because it's a) much faster and b) a saving on our telephone bill. It probably won't turn out much cheaper, but it will turn out to be a time saver. I hope.  -E

      Hurrah! The BBC is supposedly opening up (part of their) their archives this fall and making them available "to the public for noncommercial viewing, sharing and editing". I personally applaud this move - apart from being instructive, it would be a boon for artistic creativity as being an interesting pile of raw material to work with.  -E

      Al-Jazeera (of all networks) brought  urlLink an item on a mobile 'phone virus , one that propagates via BlueTooth. Basically, it propagates via BlueTooth to Symbian 'phones. It doesn't do much damage - it only displayes a message ("Caribe") each time the 'phone is switched on. I've been waiting for it for some time, and now it's finally here. I just hope that when we get to see inserts (i.e. computers that interface directly with our central nerve system), they will have some decent anti-virus software...  -E

      Well, I only got back from the States this Friday, but am travelling again today. Just a daytrip to the UK, luckily enough. Will be back in time for my own bed (touch wood), which makes all the difference. All this doesn't mean it isn't tiring, though. As for the good news, I've heard yesterday my job is secure for the moment. Hurrah!

      My third visit to New York started yesterday and lasts 'til Thursday. The funny thing is, the first few times I didn't get to see too much of the city. I'm hoping to change that a bit this time around. I'm actually visiting our office in Hoboken, right across the Hudson. The office I work in is on the 11th floor, with an absolutely stunning view of Manhattan. Nice. The weather is fantastic, and only suppost to get hotter. Maybe I need to get some clothes that are less warm...  -E

      Life often seems to be built up of story elements. You walk on the sidewalk,  right past the postoffice, and see some disconnected Nicholas standing perfectly still next to a spring laden tree. His gaze like a torch beam cutting straight through transparent people. The story line doesn't need developing - it is there. It is there, right around the next corner, printed in yellow capitals on that dark grey van. You don't even need to read it, 'cause you already know it. Nicholas's no-good deli job, his wife, their fights over her parents and his nerves fraying. All there. You walk into a cheap pizza place to fill your stomach. With a slice of pepperoni you sit down. Mom, dad and two teenage daughters sit down on the table next two you. Lives within grasping distance. Salmon struggling upstream, catching a moment's breath. The story line is there. Clear. The woman in front of you dropped a napkin, covered in her sweet girl's curves, spelling out the details. John, Elaine, high-school friends, her pregnancy ruining his big plans. Pulling double shifts in the factory - but happy, yeah.  All these story elements, every moment of every day. Every person on this earth, continuously changing. Dazzling like counting the grains of sand on every beach.  -E

      My head is killing me again. For the last week, I've had a headache every day. More often than not I can 'drown' my headache by drinking a liter or 2 of water, and then keeping up with whatever comes out again, but not today. I'm guessing it's because of my cold - sleeping with your mouth open to be able to breath, but loosing a lot of water in the mean time. I don't want to take pain killers to much, but I've given in again today. Not that it helps much, though ibuprofen works a lot better for me than paracetamol or aspirin. Right now it's a 4 (see the  urlLink Kip scale ). I tried keeping a headache log for a while, but nothing much of a pattern came up. I know it's not cluster headaches (see  urlLink headache types ) or hormone headaches, or migraine headaches. I'm thinking tension headache - but that doesn't prevent the problem. Oh well, I'll have to live with it, painfull though as it is.  -E

       urlLink El Reg  pointed me to a prime example of useless features ( urlLink here ) invented by Nokia:  wave messaging! The concept is as follows: a series of leds blink on the cover of the phone, and if you wave your hand, the message is then readable for up to 6 metres! Wow! Mike, it's amazing! That is so useless!  -E

      Last night Susana and I went to see a Bollywood movie with some friends. Having heard a great deal about the concept, I was quite eager to see one for myself. It was, interesting, to say the least. The movie, called "Koi mil gaya" (see  urlLink IMDB ), was a 3 hour long romantic sci-fi drama. Which doesn't sum it up at all. The movie is a stew of about a dozen Hollywood movies (I personally counted E.T., Jack, Forrest Gump, Spiderman, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Space Jam ).  The story is basically E.T. except that we have a brain damaged young man playing the role of The Kid in E.T., and a romantic love story of the brain damaged man and a beauty, who chooses him over Mr. Perfect.  The thing is, we were cracking up with laughter - it just seemed like a very big parody. But it wasn't. Weird, puzzled, about the extent of cultural difference possible.

      The shower is always a great place to think, and it would be even better if I could actually think about the things I needed to think about. You know, work, marriage, kids, that sort of stuff. Instead, I found myself thinking about political systems today, with the upcoming European elections and the US elections. As you may or may not know, the Dutch have a multi-party system, compared to the US and the UK (to name a few) that have effectively got a two-party system. This means, that when push comes to shove, and for the coming US elections push will come to shove, you're either Republican or Democrat. Forget about the Greens, Ralph Nader or whoever - even if your heart is really with them, you're not going to vote for them, because basically you either want Bush in or out. That's I think one of the major drawbacks of a two-party system - it tends to polarise issues. Though in the next Dutch elections I'll cast my vote in such a way as to contribute (in my own, humble way) to the departure of the current prime minister, that doesn't stop me from being _in favour of_ certain other parties, I'm not locked into a certain party by default. This makes for a much more colourfull, diverse political landscape. As the current Bush said, "You're either with us, or against us." I know, that was on the 'war' on terrorism, but it could just as easily apply the the Republican party. What I wonder is, if this polarisation also makes for polarised decision making, and for a less colourfull, diverse country?

      Couldn't resist the urge to redo the design of  urlLink this page . If all your seeing is some light text on a black background, make your browser window bigger (or use a graphical browser, for a change ;-). If you can't, get a bigger monitor/better video card.  Hope you like it, if you don't, let me know.

      The world is a wide place. The unexpected joys of finding, by an impossible trail, a random click, something that strikes a cord.  I notice  urlLink Bloglines  allows me to keep track with multiple blogs more easily and prompts me to read blogs of people I do not know but whose blogs inspire, add depth or wanted news. One of those is  urlLink Joi Ito  - a person I had never heard of before, but had discovered via a posting on  urlLink Oliver's blog . Joi Ito's blog has a random face roll (i.e. on every reload 6 different mugshots get shown). One of them had an interesting face, and led me to  urlLink Purse Lips Square Jaw's (aka Anne Galloway) blog . Her postings resonated, but  urlLink a site   urlLink she  linked to  even more.  I know, I should be working. But doing this makes me so much happier...

      This weekend I had a discussion with Thijs on Google and the desktop. Linking into this is  urlLink this quote :   Another part of Microsoft's Internet strategy is to combine Web searches with an improved application that lets users find documents and e-mail messages on personal computers. The enhanced search function will be a feature of the next major version of Windows, scheduled for 2006, but Mehdi said that MSN would make a desktop computer search feature available much sooner, probably as part of the free downloadable toolbar that it introduced earlier this year. And last week Microsoft bought Lookout, a tiny software company, to help with its desktop search effort.   Now, here's a thought: Apple puts decent searching into it's OS (far too late, but at least it's here). MS might make it available using ... a downloadable toolbar. Now just who do you think would have the better implementation? It shouldn't even be possible for a _toolbar_ to get this far down into the OS...

      Oliver  urlLink posted  on the subject of  urlLink ChangeThis , a site that basically aims to be a central point in the life of a  urlLink Meme . I have to say I really like the idea. These people are blatant optimists, thinking they can change the world by creating a novel way to spread ideas to the world. I'm not 100% how they want to distinguish the cream from the crap, but I'm definitely staying tunes...  -E

      As per 'customer' demand, an   urlLink RSS   urlLink feed  (as opposed to the standard  urlLink Atom   urlLink feed ) is now available. If you don't know what that means, ignore this post :-)  It was actually quite some brain work to get this to work. The Atom and the RSS file both being XML files, an xslt solution seemed the most logical one. A bit of Googling yielded a PHP script that was supposed to be able to do this, but unfortunately it relied on a bit of PHP not present on my (other wise excellent)  urlLink hosting environment . Now what? The solution lay in downloading  urlLink Xalan-J . A simple caching solution (if atom.xml is newer than rss.xml, recreate rss.xml, then output rss.xml) upped performance, &eacute;t voil&aacute;!  Enjoy,  -E  PS After writing this, I've discovered a service at 2rss.com: an Atom2RSS translator, by simply typing something like http://www.2rss.com/software.php?page=atom2rss . Oh well, this works too, and has less dependencies, or something.

      Slightly overdue, but with Susana in the States for work and her brother's girlfriend situation, things aren't quite normal, to say the least, but here are some notes on our holidays.  Basically, we travelled to the south of Spain to spend some time with Susana's parent, one of her brothers and his girlfriend. The main theme of the trip: heat, heat and beach. The most entertaining part (or at least the most entertaining part to relate here) was our visit to  urlLink Gibraltar . This weird rock (it really is a rock sticking out of the surrounding land- (or rather sea-) scape) is a rock of Englishness in a Spanish see - but with a dash of Spanishness to it. Even though they're trying to stay more British than the queen, spanishness creeps up on them in obvious and less obvious ways. Everybody speeks Spanish (and with quite the southern Spanish accent, too!), cooks (partially) Spanish, builds (partially) Spanish. It really is an intriguing little plot of land. If you're in the opportunity to go and see it, do so.  -E

      Right now, I was expecting to provide an update on my past holidays. Instead, I find myself writing about the contents of a phone call I got from Susana from Dayton (she had to fly to Dayton, Ohio, for work directly from Madrid last Sunday. Not nice...) She told me that her brother's girlfriend (living in Madrid) was in the hospital, with her left arm and leg paralysed. Apparently a blood clot had ended up in her brain. Quite shocking. We had seen them just last weekend, and in fact on Saturday she'd been to the doctor (in the hospital - that's the way Spain's healthcare works) because she couldn't move her arm. The doctor told her it was probably a problem with one of her vertebrae being mis-aligned and pushing on some nerve endings, and told her to do a checkup on Monday. Boy was that guy wrong... The chances of her recovering mobility are quite good, considering she's very young and healthy. The odds of something like this are supposed to be extremely low, but still, it does leaves you in a kind of daze...

      Technically, I'm still on holiday - of which I'll share all the highlights at some later point in time - but there was one thought that struck me last night that I wanted to share right away. &nbsp; Assumption: reasonable understanding of Einstein's theory of  urlLink Special Relativity . &nbsp; One of the consequences of this theory is what is called the twin paradox:&nbsp;One of a&nbsp;twin flies off in a spaceship travelling near the speed of light. When he returns he discovers that his twin has aged much more rapidly than he has (or he aged more slowly). Now, this made me wonder... Crank up your trusty  urlLink SL1200 , and supercharge it a bit. Well, a bit... Make sure it turns at such a speed that the edge speeds along at nearly the speed of light. Got that? Good. Now, switch it off, stand on it, in such a way that your left leg is at the centre of the thing, and your right leg near the end. You got it: now switch it on! I really do wonder what the effect of this would be (apart from being flung off at a spectacular speed, that is). Any thoughts, let me know... &nbsp; -E

      I've just now discovered  urlLink ACM 's  urlLink Queue magazine , and ran into an interesting little article.  The basic question it asked resounded with some thoughts I've had before. It is: &quot;...do we still have the premises from which the effectiveness of our form of government is a conclusion?&quot; In other words: Do we know enough about governing a country to effectively make choices about it? Or should we at every vote put in some checking questions to weed out those that don't know enough about the subject to make valid decisions?  I understand the implications of these questions (elitistic/arrogant, etc.etc.etc.), but it did strike a cord...  -E

      Only today I stumped over a  urlLink CNET article  (which has 'expired'), based on a NY Times article from May 19th (purchase  urlLink here  about Google supposedly readying a desktop search program searching the machine's harddrive and integrating these results in with Web search results. Now, the fact that I haven't heard anything else about this makes this a bit shady, to say the least, but it certainly does point to the clash that is going on between Microsoft (having claimed to put 'real searching 'into the OS, by the advent (if it ever does) of Longhorn) and Google. In fact, Apple is also getting into the searching dance - having added OS-wide search capibilities to Tiger, the latest-and-greatest for MacOS X. *ponder*  -E

      Let's generate some noise on blogging..  This weekend, Susana's brother (Pablo) & girlfriend (both from Madrid, Spain) are visiting us. Pablo works in IT and is pretty computer savvy (doing perimeter security for some software company, i.e. firewalls and perimeter virus scanning), both on Linux and Windows front. Now, with a profile like that you'd expect somebody to have heard of the concept of Blogging.  Wrong. Hadn't heard of it. Not once. Was completely new to the concept, when we were doing some nerding last night and I showed him an article on Thijs' blog on  urlLink white balance for digital camera's  (pretty interesting, btw - plug). I know  urlLink Wired  ran  urlLink an article on blogging in Spain , but I was still amazed about the fact that it hadn't cought on at all yet on the Iberic peninsula.  This makes you wonder why, though. I know that bandwidth is a lot more expensive in Spain then it is in say the Netherlands (most ADSL doesn't go beyond 256k down), but that doesn't mean people can't write blogs at Uni, or at work. And not actively writing one doesn't preclude _knowing about it_ - if you've looked at any remotely computer savvy website lately, you're sure to have seen a piece on blogging. It can't even be the language thing. To be honest, I'm puzzled...  -E

      This year's summery week hasn't relented yet, so today we made a stop at the local Italian ice cream salon, Peppino's. A customer was commenting that compared to ice-pies (?) ice cream was &quot;just icecream&quot;, to which the artisan replied how important ice cream was, since it made people happy. He went on to say that in the morning when he woke up he would say to his wife &quot;I have to get up - I have to go and make people happy!&quot;  Now that sounds like a nice job! Here's a man who's obviously truly happy with what he's doing.. I've been thinking about this very subject quite a lot lately, and I think in the near future I'll see a change for the better in this; I'm aiming to wake up in the morning to go and make people happy - if only myself.

      An article on a Dutch site ( urlLink here  - in Dutch) reports on a German candy firm,  urlLink Nappo Dr. Helle & Co , has asked it's employees to work 60 hours a week for the next three months. They've done this to avert impending financial doom. Since in Germany it's illegal to work more than 10 hours a day, the employees will have to give up their Saturdays too. This really reminds me of a case in Holland, where a company called Smeade (without consulting unions, but with consulting the employees) had upped the working hours (though from 36 to 40 - not to sixty). The union complained, and have now been put in the right - the company is not allowed to change the working hours.  One has to wonder about this mechanism, though: asking the employees to work more hours a week (for the same pay) while painting them a picture which features words like 'closing', 'fired' and 'survival'. Let's just hope it doesn't become a new trend...

      Doing some Googling I discoverd that  urlLink a website  is set up to request funds for Lynndie England. For those of you that don't recall that name,  urlLink here  are some other pictures of her. Obviously, everybody has a right to defend herself and get legal aid. On the other hand, my personal feelings say that either somebody bore a substantial grudge towards, or tried to nail her (instead of somebody else), or those pictures are real. In this case the contrast between the pictures of her torturing Iraqi prisoners-of-war and her cute and innocent smile on the fund raising website are a bit too big. To be honest, I'm not sure why, but the website slightly upsetted me.   Edit : PS, Lynndie England's trial starts today ( urlLink details ).

       urlLink Joi Ito 's sister, Mizuko Ito has written an  urlLink article on mobile phone use under Japanese teens , as Joi  urlLink points out . My gut feeling is that it by-and-large describes how the general modus-operandi is for future communication. Certain elements are already present in my own communication behaviour (like for example the more loose aspect of social appointments), others (still?) seem alien, like the tendency to talk to friends via the phone  while meeting face-to-face with others . On the whole, it rings like a good description of the general near future. Score 5, insightful.
