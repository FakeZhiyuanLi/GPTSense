      Nagarjuna’s Manmadhudu is an entertainer by all means. Nag has proved that he has a penchant for such genre of films and in the company of glamorous Sonali, the film is turning out to be a superhit. Though there are shades of Mel Gibson’s What Women Want, the thread has been reworked to suit the taste of the Telugu audience.   Abhiram (Nagarjuna) is a handsome middle-aged man who works as an executive in an advertising agency. He is a misogynist. When his uncle and the chairman of the company (Tanikella Bharani) appoint Haritha (Sonali Bendre) as an assistant manager, all hell breaks loose. He tries to make life miserable for her, which results in Haritha submitting her resignation. In a flashback Abhi’s uncle tells her about how Abhi became a women hater. He was in love with a girl Maheswari (Anshu) who spurned him in the last moment due to certain compulsions. Since then he hated women and now uncle wants Haritha to fall in love with him. What happens next and will Haritha be able to succeed in her mission form the rest of this hilarious comedy.   Though the story is wafer thin, the director has been able to package the film well with an innovative presentation. Nagarjuna and Sonali are excellent and have played their roles with conviction. The music of Devi Sri Prasad is hummable. The film is out to wallop some fun ‘n’ frolic.   Manmadhudu, whose counterpart in English mythology is Cupid, strikes his victims with arrows piercing their hearts thereby causing them to fall deeply in love(Like my friend Kishore does) Well, our Charmer of Charminar, Nag, fits the bill perfectly as Manmadhudu. Paired with lissom lass Sonali , he hopefully is bound to strike our hearts leaving behind indelible impressions of love and joy.

      I realised that something was fishy in missed call info thru SMS service of hutch . Consequently, I’ve come up with the following modus-operandi that I believe that Hutch could have been employing to trick & charge unnecessarily from their customers.  1. The Base Station targets a cellphone at random, and so a person (lets call him/her as ’X’) trying to reach you is told that your phone is unavailable, even though you might have been available. 2. You receive the SMS that you’d missed call(s) in certain time duration. 3. You either delete the SMS and go on your way.... End of Story! But in case you reply to the SMS and get the information, chances are that you might call back X (and probably other people as well) too.  Statistically speaking, even if 5 out of 10 people respond to the SMS and 2 out of those 5 make a call back, HUTCH makes a very neat profit. For numbers sake, assuming that transmission of the SMS from the Base Station is as cheap as 20 paisa and calling back to ’X’ consumes a talktime of Rs. 10 on average, the profits from this shady gimmick would come out to be around 30 rupees (5*2.00 + 2*10.00 - 10*0.20 - 5*0.20= 27.00) per 10 people. With consumer bases of a few lakhs, this (still quite a conservative estimate!) in actual would translate to pretty decent profits......  It does sound wierd, but it is possible!  Any Comments .....:)

        This is my first blog. Let's see how this adventure goes.    so today i saw movie "Yuva" in telugu directed by Maniratnam. The name of Maniratnam spells magic on celluloid screen.The narration and technique of this film is similar to that of acclaimed Mexican film, AMORES PERROS.The central point - students and youth should take more active role in politics for a better India - is not convincing.  And a great scene at the end when the ‘student denim party’ enters state Assembly into a sea of white dress.   Indeed, technically YUVA is brilliant

      Mobile operators could become “the bankers of the future.” Mobile operators already have large subscriber levels, perform millions of billable transactions a day, and most importantly, are trusted. The foundations of mobile commerce are currently being laid and the market is expected to take-off within the next few years. Many people have an interpretation of what mobile commerce will entail, however few have a shared view.   In many ways, your mobile subscription is already like a “bank” account for you – you have to manage and maintain your account with the mobile operator to continue receiving service. Extending your mobile subscription to enable the transfer of funds from your mobile phone account to another means that a mobile operator effectively becomes the middleman in a mobile payment transaction. Just like your bank offers you a debit or credit card when you open an account, mobile operators could use M2M payments to entice new subscribers and keep existing customers from straying.   MORE TO COME ............

      Internet made a lot of things easier to accomplish by eliminating friction. Here's one area which has received a great boost because of internet. Credit Card FRAUD. Unfortunately, when presented with a credit card number, name/address, and CVV - all of which match up - there's limited tools available for a business to ensure that there is no fraud.   First you'd have to wonder how these fraudsters get such extensive information. Something has to be said for all businesses following the right processes to make things secure.  But the root of these problems is different. What i would say is that the credit verification systems put in place need to be better. In their haste to participate in the internet boom, and opening credit card verification via the internet, VISA/Mastercard and other bigwigs seemed to have skipped some important steps. These decisions are now coming back to haunt internet transactions and cause businesses to spend huge amounts of dollars being defrauded or avoiding fraud.   That's a big "charge" against these companies, however, here's what i would point to. In the 5-6 years since basic credit card verification on the internet has been implemented what advances were made? There's all this talk bout smart chips, card readers built into computers etc. However, they did not put enough muscle behind any initiative to make it successful.  In the end, this is something that's going to come back to haunt the big networks.. Gave up security for ease of adoption.

      It was mark twain who said "Reports of my demise are greatly exaggerated". I know it has been used way too frequently, but it is apt to use this quote again referring to "Middlemen" and internet.  One of the many promises of Internet is that it allows the manufacturer and consumer to connect directly. A lot of the pundits, experts, visionaries were unanimously hasty in predicting how internet will be the demise of middlemen. Internet is going to bring efficiencies they said. It's going to eliminate the need for middlemen, create a direct distribution network, and thus reduce prices. Hutchison Essar South  would not have dealerships they said - people would just buy the SIMs off the internet. Certainly, Cellular operators in India  might still need dealerships for users , but for other stuff, people won't need stores, distribution networks, no middlemen.   In reality, internet ended up introducing more middlemen. None of the middlemen offline "went away". Manufacturers have their stores on line, they still have their distribution networks, and quite a few of the stores have online versions.  Apart from these merchants, Several new kinds of middlemen emerged. In fact, with the advent of Pay-Per-Click (PPC), every webpage is turning into some kind of paid middleman. What do i mean by this?

      As your distribution channels and transaction mix expand, the need for flexible fraud and anomaly tracking increases. One important use of the INFOLynx ANOMALYCenter Module is to combat fraud.    ANOMALYCenter tracking lets you provide your customers with the benefit of identifying suspicious transaction trends on traditional and new transaction sets as they come on-line.  The speed and accuracy by which you provide this information to your customers can add to product differentiation to the services you provide. The INFOLynx Anomaly Tracking Module also enables you to identify historical common points of origin for the anomaly transactions identified.  This can prove crucial in identifying sources of irregularity and preventing reoccurrence.  Each of the module’s functions provides issuers and acquirers of transactions leading edge tracking opportunities to identify and assist in the reduction of anomaly activity.  Tools and methods allow you to develop detection schemes and research cardholder behavior patterns to eliminate loses and enhance profitability.  You can establish and dynamically adjust how the Module identifies patterns of behavior. Databases containing transaction anomalies are then made available for analysis, distribution and further action.  You and your customers receive the benefit of identifying and accessing unusual transaction information and trends

       If we didn't have passwords just think how vulnerable we'd be. Your credit card details are littered all over the internet, stored every time you go shopping. Without passwords anyone could use your Amazon account... and they'd probably gift wrap everything too! Bank accounts, email, pretty much anything you care to mention. Surprising then that we're so slack with them. i did a bit of password prising.  When it comes to online security your password is your first line of defence. So it's a shock how few of us keep our private passwords to ourselves. Using a computer security expert we went out on the street and were amazed at how many people will hand over their passwords to a complete stranger.   What i saw was people giving their passwords to me, who they've never met before, which is a fundamental issue. If they'll give it to me then they'll give it to anybody. So some good advice for people in constructing or using passwords: first of all, try not to write it down anywhere because if it's in your top drawer or on your desk people will find it; secondly, try not to use things like your husband's name, wife's name or any other relative in your family,or the street you live in, because those are very easy to find.    "Make it easy enough to remember but make it a mixture of numbers and letters and potentially some random characters like !?#@ and so on."      The English language is only 26 characters and there are only so many combinations of those characters. So because we're all using the same dictionary we can use numbers and special characters to make it a little bit more complex but there's a finite number of combinations and if you work hard enough at if you can break that password. The advantage of pictorial systems like Chinese or some other system based on pictures is that the combinations are infinite.   Instead of remembering numbers and letters, which is the normal way for passwords, i have come up with a way of remembering a story instead, which is much easier for someone to remember than letters and numbers.   As our deepest secrets go digital, choosing a good password becomes more important than ever, but many people don’t take their password security seriously enough. New technologies like biometrics will help, but the fact remains that if you want to keep your private information from prying eyes you must choose a password that’s hard to crack and then not say a word about it to anyone...

      Look back over the past decade and it's clear the internet has changed communication and the availability of information beyond recognition. To many of us email and the world wide web have become a key element of our way of life. But what about the next ten years, what do they hold?    what the next generation internet may bring.    In thirty years we've travelled from a 'net that was a government sponsored research project with two machines, to a cyber universe of one hundred million computers, four hundred million users, and around six hundred billion webpages.  Analysts are now envisioning the 'net quietly extending its tendrils into even more of the places we find ourselves each day - it's already available, or close, in cars and planes. And they claim the devices hooked up to it, and the code they use, will get a lot smarter. The computing power in effect will move out towards us.   The example of building your own house is used - you'd be able to have a realtime, handheld, two-way video conversation with a carpenter on the techniques being used.    Time for a bit of scepticism here though, isn't the whole idea of widespread wireless computing suffering from dire problems from  urlLink 3G  right down to  urlLink Bluetooth . Many of these concepts also eat bandwidth, and the vast majority of us still see no sign of broadband access on the horizon at all.    The scientific community is also very excited about The Grid, also known as Grid Computing. It's a way of creating virtual supercomputers by assembling computer resources online across the 'net as and when you need them.   They're even re-writing the  Internet Protocol  by  urlLink ietf  the nearly twenty year old language of the 'net. Version six will hopefully soon begin to replace the current version four, which is showing signs of strain.

      In this ever more cashless society spending our hard-earned money means credit and debit cards. We use them everywhere, to help buy our shopping, our luxuries, our dreams. These days everyone has a flexible friend.  There are 1.3 billion credit cards in use on high streets all over the world, they're part of our culture. But there is a darker side to shopping in the cashless society - last year, in India  alone, over 20 million dollars worth of transactions were illegally clocked up by fraudsters. And Now Indian  banks are now talking about a crisis of credit card fraud, with losses up 50% every year.   Technology's making fraud easier, giving criminals new devices to play with. A pocket size skimmer costs just over 2000 dollars. It can read the numbers off your credit card in a single swipe. The technology to copy this information onto another plastic card is even cheaper. All that data flying around makes it very easy for the fraudsters.  Fortunately though, crime fighting technology is also getting smarter and the credit card companies are fighting back .  In 15 seconds, details of the transaction are sent to your card issuer where a complicated algorithm checks if anything looks unusual. Your transaction is now assigned a risk rating based on how likely it is to be fraudulent. If your bank decides this risk rating is acceptable, it authorises the payment and you get to walk of with your goods.   Sometimes, then, big brother is on your side, but don't rely entirely that this monitoring will cut out fraud altogether. The internet has us all electronically shopping, and while it's as safe as the high street, you still need to  stay sharp.

      A hole in older versions of Windows including 2000, Millennium and 98 could allow hackers to meddle with files stored on hard disks or web pages.    Worm viruses could be altered to exploit his 'critical' security flaw in Windows. Microsoft says that anyone using Windows 2000, Me, 98, 98 SW or Windows NT 4.0 will need to download the update.

      Nine out of ten consumers are concerned about the security of their mobile device, according to a new study which is conducted in India .  Consumers are concerned that the increasing sophistication of smart phones and PDAs has made them more vulnerable to security breaches including viruses, spam and hack attacks.  According to the report they found that 88 per cent of consumers are concerned about mobile security, with 44 per cent having considerable or major concerns and it is estimated that 82 per cent of consumers would like the ability to block unwanted calls and two-thirds wanted to filter unwanted data from reaching their mobile phones.   My Advice to all mobile users is as follows  “Users need to treat their mobile devices in the same way they treat their PC, to remain suspicious of unknown SMS or email messages sent to their handsets and to only download content from a trusted source.”

       Summary   Biometrics are a security approach that offers great promise, but also presents users and implementers with a number of practical problems.  Whilst some of these are technical, and possess technical solutions, however difficult they may be to implement, others are social and cultural.  Social and cultural barriers are much more complicated to resolve, and need much more thought by would-be implementers as well as the manufacturers and suppliers before they will succeed. Culturally, one size does not fit all, and that may increase the cost and complexity of solutions.   Introduction   For some considerable time now the personal identification segment of the IT security industry has been trying to improve on the use of the identifier and password as the means of authenticating the user of an IT service.  The problems of managing password based systems, their weaknesses, and the (now) classical ways of attacking or subverting such systems are well documented and need not be considered here.  Many consider that such simple authentication measures need to be reinforced, and refer to multi-factor authentication, based upon:   -    a secret that you know (password); -    something that you have (a token); -    something that you are (a biometric ).  In the IT world, probably the most commonly implemented method for token authentication is the SecureID token. (Smart cards for mass transit rail systems and telephone cards are more numerous, although they do not really authenticate the user.  Possession of the token authorizes the holder to have a use.)  The introduction of advanced security techniques such as public key cryptography (better known as PKI – public key infrastructure) has increased the need to be able to store secret information (a private key), because a user could never remember a randomly constructed password that long (RSA 2048 would require you to remember a mere 256 characters worth of information and be able to input it reliably!).    The rapid increase in fraud, and in particular credit card fraud, is creating demands for greater security methods than magnetic stripe cards and handwritten signatures offer.  This has seen many card issuers issue chip or smart cards which require a password (commonly a four digit PIN) before they can be used.  However, these are by no means generally implemented.  A spot check on the various cards in my pocket showed only 50% of the various bank/credit cards have chips, whilst none of the others have that facility.   Why move to biometrics?   The principle pressure to move to biometrics comes from two sources: the biometric industry and the finance industries.  The finance industries are continuing to search for a cost-effective means of reducing fraud.  If that means can also be used to prove who authenticated the financial transaction, or could ensure that only the authorized individual could make it, then so much the better.    The biometrics industries clearly wish to see their commercial potential fulfilled.  Since they form the ‘third pillar’ of the security authentication process, there is a logical requirement for their services if you need to improve the ‘quality’ of the security functionality of a system.  Exactly how the ‘quality’ is improved in some mathematical calculation is less clear, although work has been done by the UK security agency CESG to consider how it might be represented.  Overall, however, it is obvious enough that using more than one mechanism to authenticate a user is going to make the system stronger provided that the mechanism is effective and not related to any other mechanisms being used.   Which biometrics?   Biometrics are about measuring specific characteristics of a person, including:  -       voice; -       handwriting; -       fingerprint(s); -       face; -       retina of the eye; -       iris of the eye.  In an ideal world you want to choose a characteristic of a person that has helpful measuring characteristics such as:  -       unlikely to change; -       likely to prove unique; -       not invasive; -       difficult to copy or steal and reproduce.   Conclusions   Biometrics offer a valuable approach to extending current security technologies that make it far harder for fraud to take place by preventing ready impersonation of the authorized user.  However, in order to make use of biometrics we need to register users, a procedure that may be costly, and onerous for users, and we have to have a socially/culturally acceptable means of checking the biometric at the point of authentication.  These problems may also give rise to the need for safeguards over the use of the biometric...  Any Comments Are Appreciated..........

      on 18th June 2004 ,  I ,Kishore & Raja  , went to watch movie  urlLink LAKSHYA  the most awaited Bollywood flick .   Lakshya is based on the 1999 Indian Army's skirmishes with pakistani intruders in the heights of kargil district in the restive state of Jammu and Kashmir.  Through all the pre release hype ( including Hritik's "special" haircut for the film which created such a stir -- then !) Hritik fans finally get to see the film which they have waited for the past 3 years.   Post the "goodwill" cricket matches, and the general goodwill which has been generated between both India and Pakistan by the BJP Government, this film seems a little outdated in spirit. The 1st question i want to ask is "Do we need any more Indo-pak conflict films ? "

      For years Internet companies were competing fiercely against each other to earn the coveted Home Page slot on personal PC. But while that is still a highly desirable goal, most of the major players are now focusing on Instant Messaging as the main way to attract and keep their customers.  In 1996 a little known Israeli company wrote a piece of software that quickly became one of the most downloaded programs on the web and revolutionized global communications. It enabled any two people anywhere to type to each other in real time.  urlLink ICQ  was a prototype Instant Messaging system that within 2 years had 11 million users and attracted the attention of internet powerhouse America Online who bought it outright in 1998 for $287 million. Since then scores of companies have produced similar products that can usually be obtained free of charge.   Instant Messaging has a huge user base worldwide;  urlLink AOL  alone carries 2 billion messages every day and the IM software stays open on the desktop for an average of 6 hours a day. It's little wonder that all the big players have recently announced major upgrades to their IM services. It's become a huge market.  urlLink Yahoo Messenger  has an estimated 19 million US users, and the demographics have changed dramatically in the last couple of years.   urlLink Yahoo , like all IM developers, is trying to get more customers to stick around for longer. New offerings include integrated radio station feeds, characters that represent you whilst on line, customizable backgrounds, and 13 new emoticons.  Here in country like India  a recent survey found that 40% of staff use IM but its use doesn't seem to be viewed with nearly as much suspicion as email. The study found that email is monitored by six out of 10 companies, but only a fifth concern themselves with the content of Instant Messages that are flying back and forth throughout the working day.   So how worried should businesses be about the threat to their systems from IM? And as employees is it right to expect conversations to be tracked?

        It has been estimated that Sai Baba, India's biggest spiritual leader, has up to 30 million devotees around the world.But increasing numbers of former followers are alleging he has sexually abused them or their families .   Swamis, otherwise known as yogis or gurus, are the holy men of India, and part of ancient tradition.   Sri Satya Sai Baba, 78, is based in Puttaparthi, near Bangalore in southern India. His distinctive 1960s orange robes and Afro hairstyle make him instantly recognisable.   As the country's biggest "God-man" - a human being who declares himself divine - he professes to be the reincarnation of a Hindu God-man from the 19th Century.   Sai Baba not only commands huge regular audiences at the local ashram (religious retreat) - where he performs countless "miracles" - he also boasts followers from more than 165 countries world-wide.   Alaya, a former follower who claims he was sexually abused by the swami, says in the programme which was shown in BBC world  : "  I remember him saying, if you don't do what I say, your life will be filled with pain and suffering  ."   In an intimate and powerful portrait, Alaya's family talks openly in an interview with  urlLink BBC  correspondent about how they feel they were betrayed and lot information can be obtained from the ling Given below  The other side of saibaba    Back in India, there are serious questions to be asked of politicians, who seem to have continuously ignored the problem. Indeed, some would say, the correct position for these politicians appears to be at the feet of Sai Baba.   He certainly has friends in high places, and throughout the scandal, his popularity has remained intact.   Has this "God-man" been wrongly accused or does his status mean he is immune to criticism?    urlLink

       Step 1: Protect your finances   Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus.  Get a copy of your credit report, which is free to ID theft victims. Ask that your file be flagged with a "fraud alert tag" and a "victim's statement." That will limit the thief’s ability to open new credit accounts, as new creditors will call you before granting credit, generally. Insist, in writing, that the fraud alert remain in place for seven years, the maximum.   Step 2: File a police report  You will need a police report to dispute unauthorized charges and for any insurance claims. Be persistent; your local police department may suggest that this isn’t necessary, because they don’t want the paperwork hassle.   Step 3: Close all compromised accounts   The list may be wider than you realize. This includes accounts with banks, credit card companies and other lenders, and phone companies, utilities, ISPs, and other service providers...

      These days, it doesn't take a computer expert to become a hacker. There are over 30,000 hacking-oriented sites on the Internet, offering easy to use click-and-hack programs and scripts for anyone to download. These easily accessible hacking tools have opened the door for a multitude of new exploits.  The first big-name hackers include Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds, all now highly recognizable names behind many of the computer technologies used today. These early hackers had a love of technology and a compelling need to know how it all worked, and their goal was to push programs beyond what they were designed to do.  The objectives of early hackers are a far cry from the goals of today's hacker. The motivation of the new breed of hackers appears not to be curiosity, or a hunger for knowledge, as it used to be. Instead, most of today's hackers are driven by greed, power, revenge, or some other malicious intent, treating hacking as a game or sport, employing the tools that are readily available via the Internet.   To help combat these threats of hacking , your enterprise needs an in-depth defense across the gateway, server, and client. There are many different types of threats in today's environments and many security appliances are deployed to address a subsection of these.  something besides the growth of the Internet is driving the rise in security attacks..............

Take a look at the text links on the top - I am trying to get in the middle of the clickstream that pays.   Some sites are even less scrupulous than the googles and yahoos. They don't seperate out the advertising links from content links or they attempt to put together "content" for the purpose of driving clicks to paying partners. I don't know much about this company but i'd venture guess  urlLink http://.PriceScan.com  is one of them. They do call themselves "unbiased" and have a nice page of principles. They say   Q: Are vendors required to pay a fee to be listed in the shopping guide?  A: At Pricescan we believe that consumers should have access to unbiased reporting on products and prices. It seems obvious to us that if a price guide restricts its listings to those vendors who have paid to be included, then its database more accurately reflects the source of its revenue, not necessarily the best products at the lowest prices.   At  pricescan we accept no money from any vendors for listing their products and prices.   Notice how they said that they don't get paid for listing. With the magic of PPC you can get paid for driving traffic, even though you never told the customer that you are going to get paid for that click.   Of course, PriceSCAN may be a bunch of scrupulous nice guys, and they indeed don't get paid PPC. My point is that there are a lot of less scrupulous folks out there and there's a lot of PPC advertising masquarading as content.   Interesting Isn't It .....   urlLink

      In my personal opinion, cheating is going to happen in online  games . here i took the example of poker game , but from the actual poker provider itself is pretty hard to believe. many sites who host Poker games  may have some problems, but I'm sure even they know that rigging the deck would be the absolute worst thing they could do to shoot themselves in the foot. There already exists out there a number of poker tracking software that generally keep track of your individual poker play. I'm sure some sophisticated players who have the capability have written their own for that matter. These can be aggregated into a database format that can be summarily used to analyze deck shuffles and hand probabilities. Although most players would never play enough to make a case for statistical deviance, professional players would definitely notice an errant deviation in deck shuffles with their trackers.  For instance, to hit a flush draw with there are two to your suit showing, the probability is around 35%. In essence, the chance of the board having three to a suit fall is around 35%. Through tracking software, one can easily notice over 10,000 hands (what a professional probably plays in a month) any deviations in flushes. If flushes are falling 36% of the time, that's probably just a random blip. 37% and that's a big blip. If we get near 40% then there's definitely something to be looked into. Seeing how a pro player would have a database easily reaching into the hundreds of thousands of hands, they would definitely be able to judge the randomness of the deck (if they were technially able to run reports against their own data).    i having a little a computer background, I have a good knowledge of how most software applications are written and how server software operates. My assumption would be that Poker sites  only sends to your computer data about the board and your hand. Only at showdown does it actually send data about other players to your computer. Sending the data for each player would be a completely insane approach in terms of security- and any good programmer would know not to write a server in this fashion.   There is also close to a zero perecent chance of being able to send data to online poker servers that would have you magically win a hand or get cards of your choosing. It would take deliberate coding on the part of the online sites to have this happen- and again, it would not be in their best interests (or so we hope).   Any Comments Appreciated

        Most current password systems for the Internet are flawed. Designs that were almost acceptable 10 and 15 years ago have not been updated. Instead of moving to integrating authentication services under a cryptographically sound approach the IT industry has continued to proliferate multiple incompatible systems. Users are increasingly exposed by suppliers who feel no pressure to do anything better. There are parallels with the situation where web site page design methods are increasingly being rejected by security software because they represent known security weaknesses that have been exploited by hackers and viruses.    Introduction    The approach to using a log on identifier and password goes back to the early days implementing security on mainframe systems. This kind of security was introduced as soon as it was possible for people outside the computer room to be able to use computer resources. Up until then access was controlled by physical security.  Passwords were short (6 characters). They were short because the ID would be disabled if the password was entered three times incorrectly. They were also short so you didn’t have much to type and would likely get it right. They were short because it gave you less to remember.    Initial design considerations    Experience with short passwords soon threw up a series of flaws for user implementation. In no particular order these included:  using a ‘standard’ word such as boss, master, doall, passwd; using a dictionary word or the name of the business; using repeating letters or numerals (AAAAAA, 111111 and so on).  Six characters were also found to be just about short enough for someone to watch and remember whilst the user typed them in.    Technical design problems    Early password systems restricted user choice to upper case and numerals, thus giving the attacker a much reduced space of attack (the permutations and combinations of valid input data). Later systems used upper and lower case and this improved things a bit in terms of the number of attempts the attacker had to make before he could find it by ‘brute force’ (still not all eight bits of each byte since not everything is on the keyboard).    educate users into using passwords successfully    The first thing to remember is that the length must be proportionate to the overall security requirement. If a ‘three strikes and you’re out’ system combined with a token of almost any kind is in use you can live with a 4-digit PIN. If there are multiple systems then a single long password could be used as a system enabler for all services.  Choosing long passwords is not the daunting prospect that so destroys choosing short passwords. Natural language is now to be preferred since it must be memorable. But the expression of the natural language must be left to the capricious nature of the user. By way of some examples of longer passwords, one could consider the following  “redcarpet*”, “Knight(soil)” or “aapka**naam”. Other examples that could work include, “1066nuvvucheyyi”, “Hangthe****donkey” or “Now is the time forall women”. This last one is a quotation, but it’s still hard to guess or attack, especially if you don’t know where the spaces are! These kinds of passwords are proof against any dictionary attack, and, provided they are not changed often, users are more likely to choose something difficult and unique. Another handy feature is that they are slightly harder to share with friends since there is so much more to remember.   Never forget the real purpose   The password, as we use it today, is more often than not the ‘secret’ that unlocks systems capabilities or grants authorizations (including access control). In future services it will be used to authorize cryptographic secrets, most likely held in software, and then later in hardware. These ‘keystores’ may hold various secrets, perhaps even including other passwords that are transparent to the user. Where infinite retries are possible, the use of short passwords will represent a significant, and avoidable weakness which designers may one day be called to account for.  Ultimately, the real purpose of a security system is to try and make the user’s life easy whilst making the attacker’s life difficult. Systems that ignore the user are going to fail with the very community they are supposed to serve.  Whenever users cannot manage the systems they are given an advantage is being given to the attacker because they will exploit those aspects of the system first. Similarly, a poorly designed system will fail and will compromise the very users it is supposed to protect. Poor design is much harder to fix than bad coding or errors in implementation.

        Summary    Internet fraud should be addressed as two specific issues: fraud that uses Internet technology as an integral part of the fraud; fraud that is already taking place by other means and the Internet is merely another method of delivery.  New Internet environment crimes may exist, such as defrauding machines or causing business harm by denial of service or virus attacks, and these will require social and legal steps to address them.  However, the Internet has provided the fraudster with access to a significantly bigger market than ever before and effort will be required to create an environment where fraud is resisted by design rather than by insurance.     Introduction    Internet fraud is said to be big business.  But what is it, and does using the Internet create the fraud, or is the Internet just a different way of delivering ‘traditional’ fraud.  Fraud is essentially persuading someone of something with intent to deceive, perhaps with criminal intent.  The deceit may be to persuade you to part with money, goods, services, rights or information.    For the purposes i am not going to examine methods of fraud, but look at the general techniques, how they are applied, and how, if at all, the Internet can be used to make those techniques easier for the criminal to use either to carry out a fraud or to escape detection    General techniques of fraud    The key to fraud is to persuade you that something is real, when in fact it is not.  Once you accept that the fake is real then the fraud can take place - whatever it is.  Whether you are buying the Taj Mahal or charminar in hyderabad  (both are real and have been seen by millions of people - and have been regularly ‘sold’) the essence is to believe the proposal that is put to you.  Other types of fraud essentially persuade you to do something in the (wrong) belief that it should be done, or to accept something in settlement that proves to be without the value you were led to believe. But they all come back to the same thing - the fraudster has to persuade you that his vision of the world is the correct one.    How does the Internet map to the real world    The Internet is rather different.  The biggest problem for the Internet user is that there is no physical reference to use. You can’t go to a physical bookshop at www.amazon.com.  You have to believe what the computer tells you, and that is the start of the problems.  We have many practical examples where people get the physical world wrong - they put their bank cards into fake ATMs and enter their PINs, they tell their friends and children their passwords (sometimes in public), they sign up to ‘get rich quick’ deals with people they don’t know - so how well are we set up to handle the Internet world, where web sites are just exactly as good as their designer intended?  The practical answer is just barely.  The Internet is marketed as an anonymous zone.  Information is free and users are anonymous.  Now some of those features are desirable.  When you go into a store it is the store that has to tell you who they are.  If you pay with cash they will never know who you are and none of your legal rights are affected.  They give you a receipt and you can check any of the details and get corrections made on the spot.  If you want credit you have to tell them more about you, but not necessarily very much.  The Internet, by comparison, is anonymous whether you are the seller or the customer.  For the seller it is as anonymous as they want to make it. This, of course, might be thought of as attractive to a fraudster.   Conclusions  Internet fraud has two distinct strands to it.  One results from the differences between doing business in the physical world and the dematerialized world of the Internet.  This gap has been accentuated by the ‘world of the Internet’ to the point where the user has no conventional reference points.  This leaves the user ill placed to make adequate judgments of any kind, not merely about security and the possibility of fraud.    The other results from technical inadequacies in the infrastructure used by the service providers.  Lack of clear regulation has allowed registration practices to develop that are not acceptable anywhere else for doing business.   Previously available security mechanisms have been implemented in ways that fail to protect the user and which require, if followed, unreasonable user effort and significant user education.  Mechanisms such as the law may be able to provide some assistance, but care needs to be taken that the law is not used as an excuse for inadequate business practices.  It would be sensible to ensure that a duty of care to implement best practice is included in legislation to expose any who have failed to protect themselves, their shareholders or their customers.  Self regulation is another essential approach, but it must avoid becoming all self and no regulation if it is to carry real conviction to a suspicious user community, and its practices must be clear, obvious and understandable to the ordinary man.  The paper world has already done this so wheel re-inventing is not required.  The introduction of new technologies places responsibilities upon their implementers.  The developers have a responsibility to get it technically right.  The implementers have a responsibility to deal with its social and cultural dimensions, and cannot stand back and ignore these.  Professional web site design carries a great deal more responsibility than merely sorting out key words, search terms and a site map.  More to come on this Topic

      I attempted here to share some knowledge which could be useful to the BPO community. I will list questions even if i don't have answers for them. Hopefully, one of you will respond to those queries. Please do feel free to correct/improve my knowledgeBase on BPO in India.  What are the pros & cons of outsourcing to third party vendors?  What are the pros & cons of outsourcing to a captive centre?  What are the current salaries in the BPO world in India?    UPDATED  Customer Care Representatives [CSRs]: Rs 8,000 - Rs 15,000 per month  Team Leaders: Rs 17,000 - Rs 26,000 per month  Managers: Rs 3 lacs - Rs 5.5 lacs per annum  Training Heads: Rs 8 lacs - Rs 12 lacs per annum  Training Managers: Rs 5 lacs - Rs 8 lacs per annum  Trainers: Rs 2 lacs - Rs 5 lacs per annum   Specialized ITeS professionals who posses MBA, BE, B.Tech, C.A. [CPA] and other expert qualifications or experience may be paid higher salaries depending upon the expertise required for the desired work profile and their level of experience. Frankly, this doesn't apply to just BPO field but to all fields.   Besides the salary employees are paid incentives depending upon attendance regualrity, achievement of targets. Don't be surprised if the incentive exceeds the salary!   Note: Rs 1 lac = Rs 100,000   What is the job growth in the BPO sector when compared to other sectors?   Industry         New Employees                   Period  Telecom                   10,000                January-December 2002  IT Enabled Services       50,000              April 2002 - March 2003  Software Services         30,000              April 2002 - March 2003  Retailing/Franchising     35,000              April 2002 - March 2003     analysis on Indian ITES sector?      Strengths    Highly skilled, English-speaking workforce.  Cheaper workforce than their Western counterparts. According to Nasscom, The wage difference is as high as 70-80 percent when compared to their Western counterparts.  Lower attrition rates than in the West.  Dedicated workforce aiming at making a long-term career in the field.  Round-the-clock advantage for Western companies due to the huge time difference.  Lower response time with efficient and effective service.     Weaknesses    Recent months have seen a rise in the level of attrition rates among ITES workers who are quitting their jobs to pursue higher studies. Of late workers have shown a tendency not to pursue ITES as a full-time career.  The cost of telecom and network infrastructure is much higher in India than in the US.     Opportunities    To work closely with associations like Nasscom to portray India as the most favoured ITES destination in the world.  Indian ITES companies should work closely with Western governments and assuage their concerns and issues.  India can be branded as a quality ITES destination rather than a low-cost destination.     Threats    The anti-outsourcing legislation in the US state of New Jersey. Three more states in the United States are planning legislation against outsourcing Connecticut, Missouri and Wisconsin.  Workers in British Telecom have protested against outsourcing of work to Indian BPO companies.  Other ITES destinations such as China, Philippines and South Africa could have an edge on the cost factor.

      1. Tell me about yourself. 2. What do you know about our organization? 3. Why do you want to work for us? 4. What can you do for us that someone else can't? 5. What do you find most attractive about this position? What seems least attractive about it?  6. Why should we hire you? 7. What do you look for in a job? 8. Please give me your defintion of [the position for which you are being interviewed]. 9. How long would it take you to make a meaningful contribution to our firm? 10. How long would you stay with us?   All these questions are very general. It's pretty easily to provide canned answers to these types of questions. It certainly won't give you a lot of insight into a candidate's technical or project management skills  One technique I find effective in interviews is to pick a recent project on their resume and ask them to explain it to you in detail. Keep asking questions, diving in deeper and deeper.   Using this technique,  i believe any one can quickly determine their level of skill, depth of knowledge, and whether they actually did what they claimed to have done. Even if you know nothing about the topic, it's very hard for someone to cover up their own lack of knowledge under this kind of questioning.   "How would you move Mount Fuji?"

      It's the eternal conundrum, how do Team leaders get their teams to perform at higher levels and how do they maintain a level of high morale. It always amazes me how leaders point the finger at their people and talk about them as if they are the problem or an entity unto themselves responsible for all failings within the department. It is a brave leader who will look at themselves first and ask some very powerful yet disturbing questions such as:   1.What have I done in the past that worked?  2.What's going on with me right now and am I bringing enthusiasm to the workplace?  3.Am I being realistic in my expectations and have I communicated them to my team?    Eight Ways to Motivate Your Call Center Team  Many leaders are put into their positions with little or no training and they are doomed to fail. The assumption most employees make is that because you are the leader you should know how to manage personalities and motivate. This couldn't be further from the truth. People skills are just that, a skill that is developed through training, application and experience.   Let's face it, in a highly functioning team environment there exists a high level of accountability all the way around. What I am saying is that we leaders be willing to look at ourselves and what we have control over. Here are 8 things you can do to motivate your teams:    1. Look in the mirror.  Are you waking up with enthusiasm and excitement about your work? Have you set goals for yourself and your team? Or are you just punching a time clock like the rest of them and it's all you can do to not fall asleep with boredom or scream out loud with frustration. What do you need to be more excited and enthused? If you are not excited and energetic it is not fair to expect your team to bring the same to the table.    2.Take a retreat.  Step away from the work environment for a day or if possible two. Go to a 2-day management seminar or retreat and re-fuel, re-group and re-energize so that you can bring a fresh attitude and approach back to your team. Many leaders are suffering burnout and they are not able to be creative with their solutions. Signs of burnout are: lethargy, apathy and negativity just to name a few.    3.Take a pulse.  Do an assessment of your team dynamics. List all of your team members on a piece of paper and beside each person's name indicate the level of performance you feel they are currently at, what you feel they are capable of and where the gap in performance exists. Then think about how you have approached this person in the past in regards to performance improvement and what you can do differently this time with them to have them hear you in a new and different way.   4.Tell them what you want.  Have a team meeting and tell your team that you want to brainstorm ideas on how to create higher levels of motivation and morale. Be willing to hear all ideas and as a group have them prioritize the ideas and then delegate the action items. Be willing to do something yourself to show your commitment to the goal of higher motivation and morale.   5.Do a 360.  It is a brave leader who willingingly has his/her teams assess them as leaders. The 360 degree performance evaluation system does just that. It allows for employees to evaluate their leaders and to provide sound feedback on how their leader can improve. Tell your team you want their opinions and input on how you can be a better leader. Be open and willing to hear the good with the bad and sometimes the ugly. Then do something with the feedback- communicate back to your team what you are going to do as a result of the feedback.   6.Coach regularly.  Statistics show that leaders who have a coaching plan in place for their employees have less absenteeism, higher productivity and overall higher morale. It makes sense doesn't it? Spend quality one on one time with your employees on a regular and rotating basis and they begin to perform at higher levels due to ongoing personal attention and validation. Coaching prevents bad behavior and negative attention methods by employees.   7.Praise in public- criticize in private . There is nothing that replaces pure praise. Employees surveyed stated that they value recognition above pay raises by their leaders. We often undervalue the power of praise and we may even feel that if they are doing a good job they should know that we think they are great. Some leaders feel that giving praise all the time is hard work and that employees requiring it are high maintenance. The rules of giving effective praise are: praise specific behaviors or results, be sincere, make it timely when the event happens and when possible make it public.   8.Be a psychologist.  Adapt to the different personalities of your team. You already know your people to a high level and yet we tend to overlook the unique emotional needs that each individual has. Treat them as they want to be treated and be willing to see things from their perspective. Openly communicate and be willing to share yourself with your team. You can't be everyone's friend however you can be accessible, open and trustworthy. Teams who have an understanding and compassionate leader tend to be more loyal and can weather ongoing change at higher levels.   Often we feel that we just need to throw money or perks towards our teams to keep them happy. This is an erroneous belief and it has been found that truly what people want is to have open communication, straightforward and direct leadership and an easygoing environment to work within. Sounds good doesn't it?    Any Comments ...........

      Will the Outsourcing Trend continue to survive with falling training standards?   What's the bottom line? Call Center Employers will regret slashing their 2003 training budgets to save a few dollars. For a small investment, employers can protect themselves and save hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs. Below are the top four training blunders that many employers make and later regret.    Blunder #1: We distribute training policies and that's all we need to do.  Distributing a company/induction/training policy is not sufficient to show workforce that a company has met its legal obligation to train its workforce and create a educated work-environment. Also, line managers - the people in the trenches and making your daily employment decisions - are your best hope of creating a energetic & learning workplace. Therefore, it is very important to train your management staff so they can "spot the issue," recognize a situation involving a issue and seek help from HR.    Blunder #2: We're fine since we had training six months ago.  In order to use training as a defense tool, companies must verify that each and every worker received training. All companies experience turnover and absenteeism problems, which undermine training effectiveness. Therefore, companies should receive written or electronic training verifications and audit those verifications ANNUALLY to ensure legally defensible training. Compliance training loses significant value if you're not able to present tracking information and documentation showing that each of your workers received annual training. Also, many employers experience the all too common scenario where they know they provided training, they know the employee likely attended the training - but they cannot prove it for lack of documentation. Don't make that same mistake.    Blunder #3: We have an HR assistant conduct training workshops. A company needs to rely on the quality and effectiveness of its training. Otherwise, why do it? Using an in-house trainer can be difficult if the person lacks expertise or credibility within the organization. The trainer must be a senior executive or an outside professional to gain the respect and attention of the training participants. Also, companies should have a qualified expert conduct the training - a person who can also provide training testimony in the event the training is ever legally challenged.    Blunder #4: I only want in-person training rather than Web-based and I can't afford it this year . A blended learning solution (combining in-person and Web-based) is the most comprehensive and effective training solution. However, some Web-based programs can also be an effective stand-alone solution.. For example, in-person training costs about 4000 to 5000 per person just for the training. That does not account for ancillary expenses such as travel costs, staff costs or lost productivity/opportunity costs. In contrast, Web-based training can cost as little as 3000 per person, without any hidden costs.   As we are in middle of year 2004, we need to devote energy and resources to our employees more than ever before in order to maintain a productively workplace amidst this recession and the poor morale pervading the marketplace

      Like it or not, the outsourcing era is here to stay. One can safely say that at present, outsourcing to India is one of the best ways for a company in a developed nation to cut development and maintenance costs, and yet stay on the competitive edge. Already, anywhere from one-half to two-thirds of all Fortune 500 companies are outsourcing to India.'Outsourcing to India: The Offshore Advantage' is an easy-to-read-and-follow book, which you can read at One Go, as the chapters follow a logical progression of steps required to work with an outsourcing partner in India. Alternatively, you can have this book as a handy guide to India and outsourcing to India and refer to it as when you need to clarify critical points and issues.   The book is divided into three main heads;  1.Introduction to India  2.The Outsourcing Industry in India and  3.How to Organise the Outsourcing Process.   The first section provides the reader with a summarized, yet comprehensive view of India. They include a brief history of the country, contemporary Indian politics, culture and food, travel in India, and also address any security concerns a traveler might have.  The second section deals with the outsourcing drivers like government policies, technology and corporate strategy, the major industry players and the BPO market in India, the ownership models and players, major outsourcing locations, and industry associations and research bodies.   In the third section, Kobayashi-Hillary touches upon outsourcing objectives, India as an outsourcing destination, research ratings, outsourcing flavours, success criteria vendor selection, legal contracts and arrangements, culture and communication and employee transition and exit management. There is also a political map of India at the end of the book.   The book is a step-by-step "how to" guide that takes the reader through the entire process of outsourcing and is written in such a clear and easy-to-understand style that begs to be read. The chapter and section headings alone are worth the price for anyone who needs an outsourcing checklist.   'Outsourcing to India: The Offshore Advantage' differs with other outsourcing books already in the market in that it provides a comprehensive understanding of the country, rather than just focusing on the business aspect of outsourcing. Also, the book is written from the author's personal experience and several years of research in India, and includes many anecdotes, incidents and experiences that make it very interesting to read.   All in all, 'Outsourcing to India: The Offshore Advantage' definitely makes for a valuable handbook and a 'Bible-like' manual for anyone considering outsourcing to India, or even for someone remotely interested in the subject.

      The infrastructure required depends upon if you are setting up a voice based call center or just a backend operation for your client. For e.g. if you are processing the payroll for your client in the U.S. chances are you really don't need an IPLC line from your facility to your client in the US. However, if you are answering the inbound calls from US then you require an IPLC line.    Few important components of setting up a call center are    1.IPLC (International private leased circuit) line  Dialer  2.CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) - This is the system used for the Screen pop ups as soon as the call is transferred to an agent. The pop up gives the details of the caller, information required & the product details as required by the caller. The info on the pop up screen can vary depending on the settings made. It is optional for a call center.  3.ACD (Automatic call distribution) - the calls are automatically transferred to the agents who are idle. This may be skill based distribution or general transfer of calls. It is the must for a call center.  4.IVR (Interactive Voice Response) - this enables customers calling a contact center to use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking to an agent. This basically helps to reduce the man power cost.  5.Voice logger - This logs the conversation of all agents which can be used to check the quality of all agents.  6.MUX - Used to connect the IPLC at both the ends. Now a days most of the call centres are migrating to IP network, hence usage of the MUXs are minimal and routers are needed to connect the IPLC on both ends of the link.  7.Call Centre Management Software - Software to manage the calls & reporting  8.LAN Cabling - This is also referred as backbone.   Any comments are Appreciated .....

      Being a Hyderabadi, I have been to most of the eateries in the city. Once such place I would like to frequent is Chutney’s, . I tried `  Steamed Dosa’   here. And believe me, it left me craving for more! From the menu, I could see that this dosa has been customized for  Chiranjeevi , a leading Telugu actor. The menu also features that the Steamed Dosa is cooked in Japanese style without using any oil.   It takes less than 10 minutes by the time they prepare and serve you this dosa. On weekends, it may take a few more minutes. The dosa is served with a palatable selection of four different types of chutneys and sambar. If you are someone who usually avoid oily foods and wish to try something different for breakfast, go ahead and indulge yourself with this rare catch. Such is the popularity of the Steamed Dosa at Chutney’s that you find gourmets dropping into the eatery and relishing it even at the lunchtime.   The chutneys and sambar (both are non-spicy) truly complement the quality of Steamed Dosa. Another impressive feature of this restaurant is that they serve water in copper glasses  More To Come .......

      True!! very very true. Life seems too beautiful. But here!! no one is here for some social service. No one loves you just because you need some one to love. Some one loves you because they need something.  One can not force some one to love us. But one should be lovable, so that some one love us. How can one be lovable? One should learn to love their self, Here Loving self is not being selfish.

      Every one feels “she is the one”. Every one says Love is blind. Is really love blind. No!! Love is not blind but it is a deal.   My friends say they are madly in love with some girl. How is that girl? A woman with sharp features,fair, with good qualification, Good Job with many other feature.  Then I said my friend "you don’t like a main system, you just love the accessory". Even I may not be exception here.  So I question myself. Is there exist real love? No Love. Everything is requirement. If Love exist then why don’t we fall in love with some one who is less blessed than us. Why this filter?  Other day I was discussing with my friend on the subject of women & equality in job opportunity. My friend said "Men should be given preferences.If Men get a job one family survives, If female no much help. Look men are ready to marry unemployed female. Are female willing to marry unemployed men. They look for more qualified person". .  Female blog readers don’t beat me up. It is a fact. Apple is an Apple. I have guts to accept...........

      E.C. Thomas writes about - India's Dominance in the outsourcing industry. He also writes about the outsourcing competition and controversy surrounding it. The extract covers the growth of outsourcing in India:  The BPO sector in India has been growing at almost 60 to 70 per cent per annum. According to NASSCOM, the projected revenue of the BPO industry in India is expected to touch US $ 12 billion in 2006. This is a nearly four-fold growth from the 2003-04 revenue estimates of around US $ 3.6 billion.   The number of jobs increased from 140,000 at the end of March 2003 to a projected 245,000 in March 2004, according to Nasscom’s ‘Strategic Review 2004’. This could rise almost five times in the next five years. Each day nearly 200 people join the Indian ITES – BPO industry.   BPO is a specialized form of international trade in services, based on the doctrine of comparative advantage in international trade. Today, companies outsource to destinations like India because they see value in their investments in terms of quality service and financial spending. By outsourcing to quality and lower cost operations, these companies are able to lower overhead costs, compress time-to-completion with efficient time difference management and focus on core competencies. There are many clear instances of such advantages to companies over a short time-frame. Likewise, banks and financial institutions will not send their data to these countries, unless they are sure of the credentials. As pointed out in the McKinsey Institute study, the US economy benefits in outsourcing in more ways than one.   One estimate says that the General Electric (GE) which employs 18,000 workers in India, saves $ 350 million per year through outsourcing. In all, $ 8 billion has been saved in the USA through outsourcing. A NASSCOM report estimated 60 per cent savings in costs for companies outsourcing to India. There exist 185 Fortune 500 companies which outsource work to India. Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) provides opportunities for MNCs to reap the surplus in the service sector that did not exist earlier. The companies engaged in production of value-added services, from medical transcriptions to software programming, require skilled labour which countries like India have in abundance. In fact, Indian call centres have a higher productivity as compared to those in the USA or UK.   According to NASSCOM, an Indian call centre agent makes on an average 98 correct transactions, as compared to 95 by an agent in the UK. Besides, the Indian makes 120 transactions an hour, while his British counterpart makes only 100. However, efficiency does not always mean higher pay. A worker’s basic salary in the USA is $ 63,000 per annum, while it is $ 5,850 in India and $ 4,750 in China for the same job.

       Cricket no longer depends on crowds for revenue. There is sponsorship and television rights that fill the coffers. But even a television viewer feels the absence of crowds. It makes the telecast flat and to raise the volume of sound effects is not the same as catching the actual cheering........

      Two people. Entirely different. Yet have something in common. Unable to accept the affinity openly. Unable to hide it too.   But good relationships are not discriminated by color, race or sex. Point exemplified. Very well indeed.   Morgan Freeman as Hoke, an african-american and the chauffeur for Ms. Daisy (Jessica Tandy), an American Jew who is reluctant to have him as one. Their loneliness and the circumstances lead them to a 25-year long warm relationship. Crafted beautifully, this masterpiece is a drama as well as a melodrama.   Expressing a serious problem (racism) in an intended comedy is not a joke, and Alfred Uhry - the playwright has done it carefully and effectively. Hans Zimmer's music gives a boost to the film. Inspite of the four academy awards (including Jessica Tandy as Best Actress), I am sure Morgan Freeman also deserved one for his performance.   A must-see if you like dramas.

        Andhra Pradesh is getting big on news.    In the Telugu regional language broadcast space, 2004's big media story is likely to be that by year-end Andhra will have the distinction of being the state with the highest number of dedicated news channels - five of them in all. While at first reading, this might appear a perfect recipe for collective disaster, that's not the way the players who have set forth plans for entering the arena see it. According to their reasoning, the advertising potential that news offers in Telugu hasn't been fully exploited as yet and there is enough room to grow. Another thing is that with the new digital technologies that have come in, operational costs of running a news channel have significantly reduced. Last but not least, there is the Telugu speaking diaspora across the globe that is thirsting for news from their home state, is the perceived wisdom behind the flurry of Telugu news channel activity.  But before examining the subject in detail, some history. On 28 December 2003,  Eenadu Television ( ETV )  launched Andhra's first 24-hour Telugu infotainment channel ETV2 with a thrust on news. Just over a month later (1 February 2004 to be precise), 24-hour "pure" news channel TV9 started beaming.  Reports suggest that   TV9   has received Rs 150 million as funds from venture capitalist Srini Raju's i-Labs Associated Fund and the Chennai-based Unify Wealth Management.  Now there are three other players getting set to move in on this turf. There is of course the big daddy --- Chennai-based Sun TV network --- that is making moves to beat the competition from archrival ETV and TV9. Sun TV will be launching its Telugu news channel Teja News (tentative title) and a local cable television channel   Gemini Cable Vision  , which, while not being strictly a news channel, will have a high emphasis on news via regular bulletins.  While   Teja News   will be ready by September 2004, Gemini Cable Vision will take another four months after that to launch. Right now, Sun enjoys visibility in Telugu with Gemini (Andhra's top rated channel which is devoted to soaps) and Teja TV (an infotainment channel).  Sun's Tamil competitor   Raj TV  , which has its Telugu presence in Vissa TV, will be launching its Telugu news channel Vissa News by December 2004. Come September and two-year-old Maa TV network also will unleash its news channel.  With news channels galore, TV9 CEO V Ravi Prakash explains what prompted them to enter the race. "Telugu television had been clogged with soaps of the saas-bahu kind. Then the serial factory graduated to topics like extra marital affairs. Our market study revealed that women wanted a change. So we launched TV9 as a news channel targeting the youth and women."  Now TV9 is eyeing the Telugu TV's entertainment market and also has plans to launch a Kannada language sibling to TV9 in neighboring Karnataka. TV9 Kannada would be ready for test run by September, while the entertainment channel would be launched by December.  The trend triggers the question: Why this mad rush for channels? What makes networks believe that a channel devoted to news has enormous potential? Obviously, all assumptions would lead to one explanation - money. But is there such a great potential in the Andhra television market? And why this sudden spurt?  As per details provided by Starcom (Mumbai) broadcast investment manager Varghese Thomas, the total ad revenue generated by the Andhra television market for the last fiscal amounts to Rs 2.2 billion.   Gemini TV leads the tally with an impressive 44 per cent closely followed by Eenadu TV (ETV), which recorded 37 per cent market share. Maa TV had eight per cent while Teja TV had six per cent of the ad revenues. The state, which also has high cable penetration, saw cable TV advertising garnering four per cent of the revenues. News-specific channels TV9 and ETV2 scored one per cent each.  The ad revenue generated by TV9 and ETV2 together comes to around Rs 30 million. What is significant about these figures is that it highlights the growth of these news channels just within three to four months of their launch. And it also gives an idea about the enormous untapped potential of the news market in Telugu.  One can't overlook the fact that both TV9 and ETV2 leveraged the recent elections to their advantage. But looking at the Rs 2.2 billion Andhra Pradesh television market (only Tamil Nadu is ahead of AP in the south), and the ad revenue these news channels have generated in a short period, the potential for news channels to encroach into other's market is very evident.  News is primarily watched by the A and A+ segments. That justifies high-volume ad-spenders including Yamaha, Metlife Insurance, Bajaj Auto, Siyaram and Emami gunning for news spots in Telugu channels.  ETV has earned about Rs 100 million from advertisements in the last fiscal from its five news bulletins a day. Teja also earns about Rs 5 million per month.  Talking about the audience segment, the vast Telugu-speaking diaspora in the US, South East Asia and the Middle East are what the channels are eyeing. So that defines the scope for new channels with a stress on the news in Telugu.  Maa Television Network assistant marketing manager Praveen Viswanathan justifies his channel's decision to enter the fray saying that news has an ever-expanding viewership.  "The trend is like a gold rush. When there is a gold rush, everyone would seek a share."  If they have to woo the advertisers or satisfy audiences, what all channels need is good content. When it is solely news, the challenge is tougher. Teja TV news bureau chief, Madhu P identifies two audience segments, which are crucial to the success of any new television channel or programme in Telugu.  "Telugu people are very much interested in politics. They like to be informed about the latest happenings. Then there is the film-crazy public who make it a point to keep themselves updated of all the latest happenings in the industry.  TV9, which has a round-the-clock news schedule, packs each hour with a 30-minute news bulletin and a half hour news show. The channel boasts of a manpower network of 125-strong reporters in the country.  TV9 CEO Ravi Prakash, who was with Zee and Teja TV earlier, anchors the daily show 9 pm with Ravi Prakash. The show covers current affairs and politics. Prakash says that the channel strives to fulfill its motto: TV9 for a better society.  "Apart from the coverage of current affairs and politics, TV9 works hard to strive for a corruption-free tomorrow. We use hidden cameras for our spy show Nigha to expose corrupt officials and politicians," says Prakash.  ETV2 has hourly news updates. According to ETV2 public relations head AV Rao, the channel aims to provide comprehensive and in depth news with a regional focus.  "We have educational programmes to assist students, we support social causes with our programmes that bring civic problems to light and also there are programmes that focus on women and their issues. We aim to reach out to all segments of the society," he says.  The advent of news specific channels saw an increase in the number of news bulletins on the existing general entertainment channels like Teja TV and DD Saptagiri (Doordarsan's Telugu channel). While Teja now airs six per day (with an additional four on Sundays), DD Saptagiri added three five-minute headlines to their regular daily schedule of two 30-minute news bulletins.  Vissa TV, which was launched on 23 June 2003, airs three 30-minute news bulletins plus one 5-minute headline bulletin every day.  Will these channels prove good or bad news for all the brave new entrants in a broadcast area that everyone and his uncle seem to be looking at today?   That is the million-rupee question

      Here are some simple tips to help you stay safe online. If you have been harassed or stalked online, please go to What To Do If You've Been Harassed Online and follow the instructions there. i have also provided some offline safety tips.  Any web sites mentioned below are only a sampling of the many available online. i does not have any affiliation with these web sites and use them only as examples.   Select a gender-neutral username , email address, etc. Avoid anything cute, sexual, diminutive, or overtly feminine.    Keep your primary email  address private. Use your primary email address ONLY for people you know and trust.    Get a free email account  and use that for all your other online activity. Make sure you select a gender-neutral username that is nothing like anything you've had before. There are many, many free email providers, such as Hotmail, Juno, Yahoo! and Hushmail. i suggest that you do a search using your favorite search engine and choose the email provider that best suits your own needs.    Don't give out information  simply because it is requested. Countless web sites ask you to give them your full name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address, etc. when you might just want to search their catalogs or read messages on a discussion forum. Give as little information as possible, and if they insist on information that doesn't seem justified, leave to go elsewhere. Some people give false information at such sites, especially if they don't plan to return in the future.    Be especially  cautious of "profiles" and "directory listings" for instant messaging programs or web sites.  Block or ignore unwanted users. Whether you are in a chat room or using IM, you should always check out what options/preferences are available to you and take advantage of the "Block all users except those on my buddy list" or adding unwanted usernames to an Ignore list in chat. If anyone bothers you and won't go away, put them on block or ignore!    Don't allow others to draw  you into conflict. That may mean that you don't defend yourself from personal attacks. It's safer to ignore them and keep yourself above the fray. When you respond to a harasser in any way, you're letting him know that he has succeeded. No matter how hard it is to do, do not interact with a harasser. When he realizes that he isn't getting a reaction from you, in most cases he'll move on to find an easier target.    Lurk in a new forum to learn  local customs. Read mailing list or discussion board postings for a week or more without responding or posting anything yourself. In chat rooms, just sit quietly for 10-30 minutes to see if the discussions that are going on are truly something in which you wish to engage. Don't respond to private messages in that time, either.    If a place becomes stressful, leave it . There are many stressors we cannot avoid easily in our lives, so why put up with those we can avoid? If someone is being asinine in a chat room or on a discussion board, there are countless others that are likely to be more pleasant. If another visitor to a chat room or forum is harassing you and the forum owner/moderator refuses to take decisive action, why would you want to be there? Don't allow yourself to get tied up in battles over territory.    When you change, really change ! If you need to change your username or email address to break off contact with a harasser, using a variation on your real name or anything you've used in the past leaves tracks allowing the harasser to find you again fairly easily. If you've always been "Kitty" and you change your handle to "Cat," you haven't really changed. The harasser knows that you have particular hobbies or interests. For instance, perhaps you like to play Scrabble. If he's really obsessed or simply has too much time on his hands, he's likely to poke around in different Scrabble-related fora looking for feline names to see if he can find you again.  Watch what you "say" online.    When you do participate  online, be careful--only type what you would say to someone's face. If you wouldn't say it to a stranger standing next to you in an elevator, why in the world would you "say" it online?    Know what's in your signature file . Don't put your company name, title, email address, address, phone/fax number, etc. there unless your employer requires that you do so. If you must provide that information, restrict use of that email account to business interactions with co-workers and customers. Do not ever use it to participate in any public forum (mailing list, newsgroup, web-based discussion board, etc.).    Never use a business account for personal use . Simply leaving messages on a discussion board will reveal your IP address to others. That information can easily lead to a stalker knowing where you work and finding you offline. Restrict personal internet use to home and public access computers.   Ego Surf. Put your first name and last name in quotes in a search engine such as Yahoo!, Google or Dogpile and see if there are any results regarding you. You just might be surprised at what you find. Also put in the names of your spouse, loved ones and/or children. Remember to put their names in quotes to refine the search results. Better yet, use TracerLock or a similar service to do it for you on a regular basis.    Never give your password to anyone.  Your ISP will never, ever ask you for your password while you are online or via email. In fact, they shouldn't ever contact you to ask you for your password, period. They can get it from their own records, if they really need it for any reason. If you call them for support, there are a few rather rare instances in which the support person might ask you for your password - but you called them, right? So you know it's really a support person from your ISP that you're talking to. There's no legitimate reason for anyone to ever contact you to ask for your password.    Don't provide your credit card number  or other identifying information as proof of age to access or subscribe to a web site run by any person or company with whom you are not personally familiar or that doesn't have an extremely good, widespread reputation. Check consumer advocacy resources before giving out your credit card number to anyone, just to be sure that your trust is justified.

      The biggest middlemen on the internet are  urlLink Google  and  urlLink Yahoo ! - Each making around a billion dollars from the PPC revolution. The typical starting points for internet experience are the biggest middlemen. There are others in this category - MSN, AOL, and on a smaller scale LYCOS.   Why are these folks middlemen? Let's start by searching for a digital camera. Let's say - for argument's sake - that you are looking for a canon powershot s50. Try typing it in google and yahoo!. On google the first 2 links are "advertising links" pointing to potential vendors. There is no guarantee that these folks actually sell this product. They bought advertising links for the keyword. So google is getting money to mislead folks and send them out to these vendors. In my case, i got shopcartusa.com and newegg.com. If i click on it - google is getting paid. Thus they are benifit from my activity of looking for a camera. Mind you, i haven't bought anything yet. The next 4 links are links into froogle - google's shopping product. Here, we get linked to merchants who actually sell this product. It's unclear if google gets paid for it. Nonetheless, none of the merchants are "canon". These are bunch of other middlemen. Should you click on the first link in the "product search results", you'll end up with a list of merchants that sell this product according to google. Interestingly, this list is yet again surrounded by links to merchants who want to pay google. Some of these links are real merchants, some are again other shopping sites. For example, pricescan.com came up for me. This is nothing but another company's version of froogle like product. They - i am sure - make money if i visit their site and click on some merchant links.  On and on goes this saga.   Yahoo! is no different. They have more of the same. Advertising links put in the top result position with enough fineprint to protect them from law.    To be continued...

      there are reports that financial services web sites in some countries are moving to more complex authentication methods as password cracking becomes an increasingly serious security threat.  A Scandinavian bank is experimenting with single-use supplemental passwords mailed to members on scratch-off cards. A Belgian company manufactures a “password calculator” that generates pseudo-random codes based on your primary password, the time of day, and “the unit’s unique characteristics.”   Both solutions seem clumsy and baroque to me, but password security is not an easily resolved issue. Strong passwords are by nature difficult to remember. If you use a secure password keeper like Mac OS’s “keychain” you’re totally screwed if you happen to forget your one master password. As a result, users choose passwords that are simple and easily cracked. There just isn’t much that service providers can do about it at this point. User education can go a long way, but I think this problem is still a few years from a real solution.   How about you? Does anyone else out there have a great idea for the authentication system of the future?

       Calling Packages, Internet Phoning Swiftly Ending a High-Cost Category     "Shush, it's long-distance!"  For decades, that phrase was part of the fabric of Indian life. A long-distance call was something special -- and expensive. It could instantly quiet a dinner-table conversation and infuse a household with an aura of anxiety or romance.  Over time, long-distance became cheaper and more routine. And now it appears close to disappearing entirely as its own category, thanks to the popularity of unlimited telephone packages. For millions of people, it no longer makes a difference if they call across the country or across the street.  What began as a slow change has been accelerating in the past year or so, upending an industry long viewed as a steady utility. A combination of deregulation and new technologies has spawned a sometimes bewildering choice of pricing plans for consumers from different players -- traditional phone giants, wireless firms, cable systems and Internet companies. Most of them offer connections for much less than what separate local and long-distance used to cost.  Further roiling the industry, consumers have begun to embrace a technology that allows them to make calls over their high-speed Internet connections instead of phone lines. Such services are driving prices down further, although they are still working out some kinks when it comes to reliability and sound quality.  Lets watch what changes are going to HAPPEN???

      The Indian Government  should move ahead with a plan to implant electronic identification chips in INDIAN passports that will allow computer matching of facial characteristics, despite warnings that the technology is prone to a high rate of error.   researchers, academics, industry experts and some privacy advocates say the government should instead use more-reliable fingerprints to help thwart potential terrorists.  The enhanced INDIAN  passports, scheduled to be issued for people obtaining new or renewed passports, should be the first to include what is known as biometric information. Such data, which can be a fingerprint, a picture of parts of eyes or of facial characteristics, is used to verify identity and help prevent forgery.  Under Ministry of external affairs specifications for companies to bid on the new system, a chip woven into the cover of the passport would contain a digital photograph of the traveler's face. That photo could then be compared with an image of the traveler taken at the passport control station, and also matched against photos of people on government watch lists.  The department  should chose face recognition to be consistent with standards being adopted by other nations. Those who drafted the standards reasoned that travelers are accustomed to submitting photographs and would find giving fingerprints to be intrusive.  But  researchers who have tested face-recognition technology say its error rate is unacceptably high -- up to 50 percent if photographs are taken without proper lighting. They say the error rate is far lower for fingerprints, which could be added to the chip without violating the international standard.  The new system would differ requirements for many foreign travelers, who are fingerprinted when they apply for visas to visit India or any other part of the world. The visitors then have their fingers scanned when they enter the country to compare against the data on the visa.  Similar requirements are to be imposed for travelers from countries whose citizens do not need visas to come to the INDIA, who will be fingerprinted when they arrive in the country.  "Fingerprints are much better."  The concerns come at a time of heightened terrorism alerts and urgent calls for changes in national security from the commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and attack on Indian Parliament . Among its many recommendations were quick adoption of biometric passports and more secure drivers' licenses.  In seeking to have countries use one common biometric to aid anti-terrorism efforts, the international group designated face recognition two years ago in part because it would be easiest for most countries to implement and it was deemed the least likely to raise privacy concerns.  "Facial photographs do not disclose information that the person does not routinely disclose to the general public," the group said in a final technical report issued in United States. "The photograph . . . is already socially and culturally accepted internationally."  According to tests by the National Institute for Standards and Technology, two fingerprints provide an accuracy rate of 99.6 percent. With face recognition, if the pictures are taken under controlled circumstances with proper illumination, angles and facial expression, the accuracy rate was 90 percent. "The numbers would be better today, but they are not going to be comparable with fingerprints," . Even a person's aging can affect results, especially with children.                                                                To Be Continued.....................
