      Okay, essentially, this was an assignment given to me in English. Find an esteemed author and closly emulate one of their poems. So Obviously, I chose Walt Whitman, and emulated his poem 'O Captain! My Captain!' only about a leader who is a little  less  admiarbale...  For those of you who aren't familiar with Walt Whitman's works (Alliteration!!), here's the original:  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~    O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!  by Walt Whitman  O captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done; The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won;  The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the stead keel, the vessel grim and daring.  But O heart! heart! heart! O the bleeding drops of red! Where on the deck my captain lies, Fallen cold and dead.  O captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up! for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills:  For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths, for you the shores a-crowding: For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning.  O captain! dear father! This arm beneath your head; It is some dream that on the deck You've fallen cold and dead.  My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still; My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will.  The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done: From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won!  Exult, O abores! and ring, O bells! But I, with silent tread, Walk the spot my captain lies Fallen cold and dead.   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   O Puppet! Dear Puppet!   O puppet, dear puppet Your foolish war ain’t done Both sides you’ve used have bled for you Respect you sought ain’t won  The soldiers bleed Iraq ain’t freed The hippies cry for peace  And while your eyes Are set on oil The country grim and dead  But oh Hark! Hark! Hark! Oh the bleeding drops you’ve shed Why not in the White House, Do you not drop cold and dead?  Oh puppet, dear puppet! Wake up and hear the yells! Wake up, For you, they want impeached For you, US is hell For you, bloodshed and war amuck For you, the cities rallying For your blood they lust The peaceful flag Their angered faces yearning  O puppet, dear fool, arms found not where you said It is our dream that one day you will drop down cold and dead  This puppet does not answer And continues his spree to kill What political thoughts has he? He has no mind nor will  The war continues to rage unbound The voyage unclosed and dumb A mushroom trip The fool hardy shit Must have been on  Off to war we went To protect the world you said But what you do not realize is For naught our men have bled    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Yes, Isn't that fun... Woo... Feel the excitment. Anyway, for those of you who haven't seen Farenheight 9/11, I suggest you drop everything and go to the nearest theatre that's showing it! NOW.  Peace out!

      ...or if you perfer "We're Screwed from Multidisciplinary Stand Point"   FACT ONE : (common sense)  We as a people have been lulled into a false sense of security and complete oblivion about what's actually going on anywhere outside of our immediate realms, the outright shock that our country's population expressed at the Sept. 11th attacks is proof enough of that. We exist in a bubble, where we are completely blind to the consequences of our actions until they bite us in our big fat collectively ignorant ass.  FACT TWO : (astronomy)  During the day, the sun strikes the soil and the soil absorbs the heat. When the aforementioned soil rotates away from the sun (thus it becomes night) the heat absorbed in the ground radiates out and gets trapped between the atmosphere and the Earth, thus wrapping us in a type of blanket. This is called the "Greenhouse Effect" and it's how life is maintained on this planet. Without this effect everything would freeze over the moment we rotated away from the sun and survival on Earth would be akin to survival on the moon or Mercury (both bodies of rock completely without atmospheres) - impossible. The obvious problem (as seen on TV) that we face today, is that suddenly the Earth is producing far more heat that it would with just the sun alone shining on it.  FACT THREE : (environmental science)  From savethecleanairact.org : In 1999, coal-fired power plants alone released 490.5 million metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere (32% of the total CO2 emissions for 1999). Notice that that's from coal ALONE... and there are more and more cars (to say nothing of the fact that many of those cars are Hummers) on the roads every year.  FACT FOUR : (social science)  Both China and India, the two countries wherein most of the world's population lives (China - approx 1.3 billion, India - approx 1.1 billion) have yet to industrialize... and you'd be a fool to think that it's not high on the list of priorities.  FACT FIVE : (geology/climatology)  When studying natural and even social sciences, one thing that seems to blatantly stand out as a consistency is that dramatic change takes a VERY long time (i.e. the shifts between geological eras, the evolution of species, changes in a population's political culture, etc...). Corks of ice taken from Greenland in recent times have revealed the above assumption to be a fallacy. Places like Greenland (or the poles for that matter) are essentially Earth's time capsules, due to lack of climatic change in those regions. What these corks have revealed is that the end of the Pleistocene (i.e. the ice age) which occurred about 10,000 years ago, was not in fact a gradual thawing over a period of centuries. It was an incredibly rapid and cataclysmic shift that occurred in a window of only 5-20 YEARS! It was a shift that caused mass extinction and the ocean to rise 300 feet (Noah flood anyone?). Today, we face a similar problem, and it’s one of our own making.  FACT SIX : (geology/climatology continued)  Antarctica, like Greenland, has been the geologist’s wet dream for many a generation… unfortunately, the once stable land of ice has been going through a rapid transformation in the past two decades. Massive ice blocks on the Northern face which had been long studied by scientists and were thought to be eternal, spontaneously broke up, slipped into the ocean and were gone forever… all within the time frame of 5 days. Many a research project was destroyed and moreover, it became clear that such an event was utterly unpredictable, even by the very people who made such events their life’s work… what’s most terrifying however, is what lies on Antarctica’s Southern face. 90% of the world’s fresh water lies frozen on the inclined land mass (imagine all the rivers and lakes in the world only accounting for 10% of the fresh water in the world).  FACT SEVEN : (physics)  Recall that water expands when it freezes, so that that 90% is even more massive than it’d be if it were liquid. Now considering that… if even so much of a third of that mass were to break off like its Northern counterpart did, and then slide downhill into the southern ocean, the ocean would rise about 500 feet. More importantly however, is the wave that such a massive displacement of water would create. It’s a wave that once it hit the land, would reach heights of 7000 feet… meaning, to put it in CA terms… it would wash right across the top of the Sierra Nevada mountains, fill the Great Basin of Nevada, and stretch as far inland as Salt Lake City Utah. The coastal regions of every land mass in the world would experience a similar fate to that of CA, and islands such as Japan, the UK, New Zealand, Hawaii would be completely decimated.  FACT EIGHT : (geography)  Grab a world map and check out where all the major oil reserves in the world are located. You’ll see that most of them are located either directly on, or very close to the coast.  FACT NINE : (logic)  So essentially… there is really only one conclusion that can be reached from this. If this ice chunk slides off the Antarctic land mass, creates this massive wave, which destroys everything in its path and proceeds to put all our oil reserves under water, our civilization is essentially shut down within a week. Without fuel to power the vehicles we’ve come to rely so heavily upon, there is no transportation of food, supplies and people. There is no more industry, no more communication… western civilization will have come to an end.  FACT TEN : (ecology)  The conclusion? It’s fairly simple… we will have been the victims of a very sick kind of poetic justice… as this will have been an event of our own industrial society’s making. Strangely… it brings to mind a hypothesis I first encountered in high school called “The Gaia Theory” : In the 1970s the British scientist James Lovelock formulated the Gaia hypothesis, which has attracted many followers. According to this theory, named after the Greek goddess of the earth, the planet behaves like a single living organism. Lovelock postulated that the earth, like many organisms, can regulate its temperature, dispose of its wastes, and fight off disease.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  I'd like to shove a dis-claimer on this. The facts and research aren't/isn't mine. Hell, the "ten step guide" isn't mine either. Someone near and dear to me... Researched the research (if you will), and pulled it all together with this as a final result. Do I believe that this will happen? Maybe. I AM a firm believer in the Gaia Theory, and a hard-core environmentalist... So therefore do believe that the way we're affecting the planet is for the worse... But that's common knowledge now, isn't it? Most people, it seems, are simply apathetic. Blah.  Yes, so credit goes to: Kelly Hale.  My wonderful, hard-working anthropologist!  Need sleep.  -K
