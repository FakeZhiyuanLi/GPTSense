      We went to 80's night at Neighbors's last night. sometimes it was horrifying and sometimes it was really fun. There was this weirdo that was following me around trying to violently hump my leg. He actually knocked me over with his humping action and almost took Betsy, Amy, and a couple of other people down down when they tried to catch me. Then I laughed in his face because he reminded me of a guy in Sex in the City. Luckily I was able to get away eventually. It's sad when people don't take the hint.  Actually, there was lots of humping last night. Renny was being melodramatic all night and Betsy and I humped him into a good mood. Nothing else was working so I guess humping (the word of the day if you haven't noticed) is the true path to happiness.

      I just saw an article about how bad hair may be genetic according to a recent scientific study. Isn't it obvious that bad hair is genetic? Color, volume, density. When you add it all together it makes good, bad or indifferent hair. Who thinks up all of these ridiculous studies and why are they newsworthy? What a waste of time and money!

      Thursday was Betsy's sister's (Mindy) 21st birthday and everyone went to the Cha Cha and then got our 80's groove on at Neighbour's. We had to drag Betsy's sister from the club at the end of the night. She just kept saying "i don't wanna go" over and over. we had to explain to her that there was no more alcohol to be had and the bouncer was laughing at us dragging her out. Luckily no one was hung over for backpacking the next day. huzzah!  So we took the Bainbridge Ferry over to the pennisula and drove north on 101. that was cool because i had never been past Hurricane Ridge and alot of the scenery was new for me. betsy, mindy and i were playing 80's music and singing and dancing the whole way there (and back too.) lucky for renny, amy and scott they were in the other car so they didn't have to hear our crooning/croaking. of course i speak for myself only.  The hike in to the rainforest was beautiful but it took longer to get to our destination then it should have. there was a baby elk eating foliage on the trail with it's mama so we had to hang back and wait till they left the trail so the mama wouldn't charge us. it was actually kinda creepy because while we were waiting, we realised that we were completely surrounded by elk. We didn't see any other animals besides some birds, baby salmon, and douglas squirrels. we did hear an owl and on our hike out we saw fresh bear poo and a bear paw print in the mud.   the trail was pretty easy for the most part but there were some hilly areas and we had to cross 2 creeks. one we had to hop from rock to rock to get across and the other had a 4x4 that we had to cross like a balance beam. our site was really soft sand covered in moss and clovers surrounded by old growth trees. it was nestled in between Tom Creek and the Hoh River. We got all of our drinking water out of the River and treated it with Iodine pills. The Iodine made the water brown so we added Tang and were fine. It actually worked out well because we drank lots of Tangtinis and Pink Nasties. It was easier having it premade than adding Tang/Lemonade powder to each individual cup.

      so we are starting a new production index in Louisiana. because we have no info on the people in the film industry there, I have been doing research and data entry. The past week I've been working entering in names and contact info off of the New Orleans Film Office web site where people have entered in their own contact information and listings. It is amazing how many people in Louisiana go by initials (A.J., B.J., etc), are a Jr. or a III, and how many people don't even know the abbreviation to their own state (using Lo, instead of LA.)  they just seem to be perpetuating their own stereotype. i think it is funny.

      ok. so i sympathise for people in 3rd world countries. my liberal side tells me that these people deserve good jobs and decent lives but god dammit! all this outsourcing crap is pissing me off! last year, 9% of jobs were lost to outsourcing. assuming that every person in the US worked one job (i know not everyone works but most people i know also work more than one job), than that results in approximately 26.5 million people out of work. that is ridiculous! we need to create rules and regulations for these outrageously greedy corporations. they are trying to eliminate the middle class which is the core of our society. i say that we should start boycotting companies that give away our jobs to other countries in order to pay for their summer home in fiji.

      work has been to busy to add anything this week so this is what happened since i last posted:  Saturday, I went out to dinner with Sean, Luke and Luke's boyfriend to La Cocina y Cantina. I love their margaritas and I love that they have a 26oz margarita which comes in a fish bowl on a stem. Besides that I stayed home the rest of the evening which I was glad of when I heard the stories the next day. I guess renny, amy, iain and others went to the Chaple that evening. iain broke up with renny at the Chaple even though they were never dating and renny broke up with him on thursday anyhow. whatever. i don't get it. after that they all went to this gay dance club called the timberline. i've never been there but i have heard it is just a sea of sweaty shirtless gay men. yuk! with in a relatively short time period, renny met this guy (Roderick) and they proceeded to make out for the rest of the night. actually it was beyond making out. i guess this guy gave renny 5 BJs on the dance floor of the club. yikes. needless to say they went home together where they had sex all night WITHOUT a condom. totally scary. long story short= i'm glad i was not a witness.  sunday was memorial day. i went to folk life with amy, scott and renny. that was fun. i had strawberry shortcake, laid around in the sun and people watched. oh! and listened to renny's adventures from the night before. later, renny and i met up with betsy and went to joe's show at the sunset. it was enjoyable and tennis pro played later in the set which was cool. after the show, betsy, joe and I all went to Cowgirl, Inc and it was terrifying. I was so glad that we didn't have to pay a cover because what a waste of money. I seriously went into culture shock but I ended up having a lot of fun. It was a total sausage fest. the guy:girl ratio was 10:1 and that included the bar staff. The female employees were barely half a step up from strippers. they were stuffing guys faces in their crotches for money  and the MC seriously said at one point "The only thing better than a woman is a wet woman" and then one of the bartenders started strutting down the bar counter sopping wet. it was hilarious. i rode the bull and totally kicked ass at it this time. i had a really fun if frightening time.  michelle had her going away party on monday. it was alright. things felt a little tense and weird but it is probably because both renny and iain were there. at least they were both well behaved.  on wednesday, nothing happened except one of our clients just came in the office and he had the worst toupee ever! it came down to his eyebrows and was 3 shades off of his actual hair color on the sides. i know it isn't nice to laugh but this guy is one of the worst clients we have. he is really rude and mean and just an all around horrible person. every year they say we aren't doing business with them any more and every year jim just has to have Michael Field's $300. Plus his business is a total sham. anyhow, it was funny to see this ridiculous thing on his head.
