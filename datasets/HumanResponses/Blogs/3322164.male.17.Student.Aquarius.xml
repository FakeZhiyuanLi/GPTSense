      People have gone to far. dissing arena football just aint cool. even my girlfriend was doing it. they sais it was a hick sport, but it takes a lot of skill and luck also  anyway enough ranting, becasue i know that guys dont want that. but wait---this is my journal so who cares what you guys want.  i will save that for another time when im in a bad mood, but right now i am the happiest that i have been in a while, because of my girlfriend. i love to go on the bus now.  well, im dj-ing right now so i have to get back to that. well got to go.  later  colin aka commander cool  MOOD: HAPPY AS A COW THAT GOT A FULL TRUCK FULL OF HAY (THINK ABOUT IT.

      what is pizza? when you really think about it questions like this pop into your mind. dont ask me why and dont ask me how, becasue they just do. you know who i would like to see killed? President Bush. I dont like that man at all, and i mean at all. the only thing  i like about that man is that hopefully he will be out of office in november. what would be really cool and no one could be blamed is if he chokes on another pretzle log. (lol) remember that one?  well onto more typing in Keyboarding class.   later  colin  MOOD: bored as hell MUSIC: thousands of keyboards typing
