      It's getting near the end of the day on Friday and I'm looking for a back door to sneak out of.  All of the office women are going crazy.  They are like apes in khakis and flower print shirts who know the promised treats of apple martinis and Julia Roberts movies are very close.  They are screeching ("I want guacomole!" "Derek doesn't like crowded bars!") and banging on their cages.  I feel the same way, but the tail end of a hangover is keeping me slightly more in check. I just called Kyle at Microsoft.  I love calling him there.  I always feel important asking the operator to please connect me with Kyle Kinkade ("Last name spelt K-I-N-K-A-D-E").  They always say "Thank you, Sir. I'm connecting you now" and I feel like I've had an agent of the machine do my bidding.   Sidenote:I like it when people call me sir, especially teenagers.  I'm not one of those people who get caught up on the youth not finding me hip enough to call me dude anymore.  And I'm deffinitely not going to be one of those lame-ass Jimmy Buffet listening people who tell the youngin's to call me "Brent".  Hell no, I'm Mr. Kinkade, Snotface, now go mow a yard or play with fire.  Anyways, I called Kyle and he told me he has a top secret project that might keep him away from the apartment until Wednesday.  He's like Batman, he can't reveal what he does outside of the home.  He's so precious with his little red sports car and big brain.  Speaking of which, last night he brought up the excellent point that I know a lot more about computers than I let on.  Ever since I've moved to Seattle I act like I'm a hillbilly whenever he and his friends start talking about computers.  I even got a shirt made up that says "Don't talk to me about computers" (with a 66 on the back for esoteric appeal) to wear to one of his little socials.   The thing is, I was considered pretty proficient with computers back when I was in college.  Is this some self-defeating sibling rivalry of mine?  Why do I always pretend to fall asleep when he says "CPU".  Does it work the other way?  I've haven't seen Kyle read anything since I've been here, but I see books in his room. I think I got a promotion today.  Not any extra money, but extra responsibility.  I'm replacing some guy named Roy who left recently.  He did other stuff with folders and paper that I bet many have never dreamed could be done.  I'm looking forward to my new role and whole new cubicle!  Maybe I'll stay on and become a full-time (non temp.) Roy part 2.  This Roy fella always dressed kind of sharp and listened to trendy music.  Maybe if I do a good job I can make enough money to dress in Gap clothes and say things like "Should we listen to new Radiohead or old Portishead" and "I say, Teeny, is this cabarnet or cabARET?" I'm ready to go.  I want to try to squeeze in some frolfing before I go see Ramones girl tonight.  She and her buddies caught some salmon in the ocean last weekend and I want to cook it up tonight (found a simple receipe for bbq salmon that sounds like it will make panties wet).  Then it'll be off to a party with people I don't know and more than likely alcohol (which I'm all too familiar with).   Before I go I want to talk about something.  I keep thinking about my pops every time I use the copy machine at work.  Although, I'm pretty sure my dad has someone who does his copying for him and I can't ever remember dad doing too much Xeroxing in the garage as a kid.  This got me thinking about father figures and how they affect us.  I've been stuck with this image of Atticus Finch hunched over a copier blankly staring at the words  "1 side/2 side" with a look that says "How did I get here?" on his face.  Oh, to be the men we want to be, and yet we are the men we are.   Ok, the ape women are getting restless; I better start making a run for it.  Late

      I've totally forgotten what I was going to say.  It was profound I think.  Hmmm. Last night was typical B-Man.  I got drunk on cheap beer while other people did sober things and told me how funny I am because of the drinking and smoking and punching and cursing and long sentences with too many conjunctions, or... I woke up at 8:05 today when I was supposed to be at work at 8:00.  I never used to be late for anything.  I used to get major anxiety attacks an hour before something was going to happen.  "Holy Christ, the Wonder Years is coming on in 25 minutes!  Where's my soda!  Kevin!"  Now I show up late and wearing a ball cap.  Fuck 'em, I've been stabbed before.  Actually, I haven't: but, Goddamn that's a good line. So, it sounds like I'll be able to stay on at the space commander desk job after all.  I call it that because I spend most of the day pretending that my cubicle is a spaceship and I'm fighting space asteroids and star people.  It all started because the ergonomically designed chair that I sit in has these arm rests with buttons and levers on them to control lumbar support and tilt.  But in my world they control the lasers and my tracking beam.  Sometimes I'm wearing an eyepatch and have a big metallic space warrior suit on in my daydreams.  Usually I have my trusty crew with me who gives me advice on how to handle situations.  "Captain, don't shoot that asteroid, it's kind of pointless and we only have a million photon rockets!", they say.  "Sounds like a challenge," I reply.  "Huh?"  And then I start my intergallactic genocide.  I'm an anti space-monster-ite.   Then I come back to reality. Casual Fridays rock!  That's all that rocks about this place (except the world in my head).  I'm dressed like such a frat boy today that I feel like pinching asses and tailgating out in the parking lot.  Maybe I'll jeer people as they go into work ('You're office sucks, Washington Mutual has the best defense in the PAC 10! Whoooooo").  Actually, I think I wore this exact outfit to a Clemson/Carolina game when I was a sophomore.  That night was crazy!  This guy started hitting on my girlfriend at the time (El Diablo) while we were partying on the frat hall.  Later on that night I found him on my bed and he did a "come hither" motion to me (this guy is a complete stranger by the way).  I said "what the fuck are you doing?" and he said "Working on my paintball skills".  He actually tried to convince me that he was laying on my bed drunk working on how to best squeeze the trigger of his paintball gun.  I'm not a homophobe (I've actually given thought to banging a dude just to prove that) and I'm not sure if the guy was actually gay or confused or really did like paintball; but, he had to go.  The fucker had his shoes on my bed.  Try and do me like I haven't been done before, that's cool, I'm honored.  Hit on my chick? You can have her, she's too skinny for me. But, shoes on my comfortor?  Get out. That was the same night I put the shaft of a six iron through my right arm, which I still have an amazing scar from.  Note to all new found frat boys out there: Cheap vodka is a pretty good anti-bacterial rub. Say something smart, Brent, you sound like an ass.  How do you get exactly 4 gallons by using a 5 gallon and a 3 gallon jug?  Fill the five gallon jug and pour it into the 3 gallon jug.  This will leave 2 gallons in the 5 gallong jug.  Empty the 3 gallon jug and pour in the 2 gallons.  Refill the 5 gallon jug and pour one gallon in with the 2 gallons in the 3 gallon jug.  This will leave exactly 4 gallons in the 5 gallon jug.  "Form follows function" is by far the most challenging architectural design method.  If lacking in aesthetic, it is made up for by it's almost alluring decadence in simplicity. This weekend I'm going with the happy couple to an all-day cross country Bocce ball tournament.  I'm looking forward to playing.  I keep having memories of playing the game with Kyle in our backyard in N.C.  "Lawn bowling" is the lamest term ever invented.  I can just see some spectacled fuck in shorts and suspenders in Kentucky who can't say "Bocce" without the "K" sound, just giving up and going "Let's lawn bowl."  He'd have a huge grin while all the other corn eating fucks all said "Kurt, you're a riot.  Lawn bowling!  Funny guy!".  Fuck Kurt, it's Bocce ball. Anything else happen to me?  Did laundry, got drunk, stayed up late.  Nope, pretty lame night and boring day so far.  I think I'm going to go blow up Mars.

      Just had my third encounter with goateed-elevator-rule anarchist today.  Epidemic?

      I have a theroy.  Men with goatees don't know elevator manners.  Today I saw two men, both with goatees, walk onto an elevator before the people already on the elevator walked off.  It's like they forgot the golden rule of elevators, "Don't walk before others as you wouldn't have others step in front of you".   Maybe the goatee is evolution's anit-elevator sign post.  Maybe the men were just evil versions of themselves. On to real news.  I have succeeded in losing a job before I even started working at it. I had landed a well-paying gig at a certain place doing things.  It wasn't glamorous, but the benefits would allow for anti-depressants and cooler eyeglasses.  Well, I forgot to put on my application that I was arrested when I was a sophomore in college. Here's the story for the 4 people who don't know it: I was the social chair of my fraternity one year.  I was in charge of planning the annual orgy known as Carolina Cup (for those not from S.C., think of it as a Renior painting with Busch Light and less posture).  It was the end of the day and the pigs were on the prowl (power to the frat boys!).  I got into a fight with these two dudes from another frat about the property rights of a 3 foot sub sandwich.  In the end I offered that they take the sandwich ... UP THE ASS!  As I went to throw the deli monstrosity at them Dan Marino-style I was tackled from behind by 3 cops.  I thought I was getting jumped by the other frat and fought back.  So, more cops jumped on me and eventually the battle of Subway was over.  It took 6 cops to bring this hoagie fuck down, baby! Back to present day.  I forgot to mention this on my application.  So, when they did my background check this old charge came up.  They were forced to take back their offer, which made me upset for a while.  Now I'm hoping the temp. company I'm with will let me stay on with them.  Will Brent be umemployed as of Monday?  Stay tuned. Today I've got that awkward confidence I always put on when I'm unsure of the future.  I think I'll go play frisbee golf (game steadily improving.  driving is stronger, mid range sweet, putts oh-so-close) after work.  Then a sandwich and then Coors Light.  Perfect plan.

      I have to tell you who I am if you don't know me.  I could be ultra-alternative and say I don't believe in "getting to know you" stuff and ask you to judge me based on whatever else I do or don't do depending on what's considered hip by the alternative press.  Or, I could tell you I like the color blue and was born in Iowa.  Both of those things are for dorks.  And we all know now that dorks don't rock.  I do. So, I'll tell you the things I do.  Not things that I like to do, just a list of ten things I do throughout the day.   1.)I fantasize about sleeping with roughly 40 percent of the women I see.  This gets weird when I'm at hospitals or drag shows. 2.)I chew Wrigley's Doublemint gum because one day I hope I run into my long lost twin and we're both chewing the gum at the same time.  I'd call him B2 and we'd laugh forever about the "gum incident". 3.)I drink Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Alot.   4.)When I know someone is coming over to visit I pretend to be watching the History Channel.  When they walk in they think I'm smart when really I'd rather just watch "COPS". 5.)If I like a girl I always forget her name and have to make up nicknames.  "Russian chick", "Gas station girl", "The one that likes the Beatles" are some examples from the past. 6.)I make faces at babies when no one is looking. 7.)I daydream about explosions and super spies. 8.)I play frisbee golf roughly 3 times a week.  9.)I don't eat microwave popcorn because I feel like I'm cheating on movie theater popcorn. 10.) I get disturbed when people drop foreign words into english sentences.  Like this one time this guy kept saying "Try some of this champagne (but said it the french way "shom-pawn-ya").  I wanted to say "Why don't you just go-fuck-ya".  We all know at least a little bit of a foreign language; so, stop trying to look like a Kennedy, you arrogant fuck.  That's why we have the History Channel. period goes here

      Holy Christ, dorks!  I just got a call from Ramones Girl that woke me up; I'm two hours late for picking her up for camping.  The way she said "Do you not want to go anymore" made me want to buy her roses. Damned malt liqour and late hours.

      The name Brent gives you a strongly independent and highly creative nature, with drive and ambition to have experiences and accomplish things out of the ordinary. You can work intently at whatever is new and holds your interest at the moment, but your interest wanes quickly when drudgery and monotony set in. Obstacles to your progress or restrictions on your freedom to act create a sense of frustration which may cause you to feel resentful and even rebellious. You can then become intolerant of others, and caustic and belittling in your expression, thereby imposing stress on your personal relationships. Although you have a clever, quick, capable mind, your progress in life is restricted by instability in your affairs and misunderstandings with people. Your impulsive nature can lead to actions which you later regret taking, or to accidents. Relaxation is elusive, and depletion due to nervous tension can develop to the point where you become subject to moods of depression and morbid thoughts. Nervous tension centres in the solar plexus, with nervous indigestion and stomach ulcers a possible result.   Dorks, is this true?  I wish to think this is one of those all-encompasing generalities.  Dammit, my life can't be summed up by a random website, can it?  I'd rather be shot by a Terminator than figured out by www.whoyouare.com

      I need to find out how to buy the rights to the Harlem Globetrotters theme song. I downloaded it earlier this afternoon and I'm hooked!   I've been playing it while I clean up, while I make a sandwich and while I take a little nap; it makes everything a little more whacky! Watch out Mr. Sandwich, that's not a jar of mustard; it's a jar of confetti mean ol' Slippery Kinkade gonna throw on you!  Uh-oh, Mr. Nextdoor Neighbor, ol' Slippery gonna pull your shorts down and then dunk while you look silly!  Hey there, Lamp, Slippery ain't pregnant; the ball is up his shirt! If my life was a movie and I had to have a theme song play whenever I did something cool, got into a fight or had rough sex it'd be this song!

      I didn't write in this thing yesterday. I hope everybody didn't get shot. As you might be able to tell from my backwards hillbilly speaking, I'm tired.  I had a lot of work to do today as Roy2D2.  One of the swing shift fellas totally forgot to fill out the HMDA forms and that set my closing process back a good 2 hours!  Can you believe it?   Here's what happened to me in the past 48 hrs. -A man with a goatee stepped on an elevator before I got off of it.  I was too shocked to say "Hey". -I rented "Marathon Man" and "Rear Window", excuse me "Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window".  I wanted to redeem myself after watching "Phone Booth" the other night.  Forrest Whitaker? Hmph.  And Colin Ferrel?  This guy is supposed to be Hollywood's "bad boy"?  He's about as badass as a pair of Reeboks.   OOOO, take that you aussie or whatever fuck.  And Keifer Sutherland, listen up, I only want you making movies with someone related to or with the last name of "Estivez" from now on. -I got dragged downtown to go to a karaoke party.  By party these people meant a room with a computer that plays songs.  I was instructed to sneak beer in.  No.  I was told to have fun.  No.  I was already a little drunk when we got there, which allowed for one of my prouder moments in life.  I was in this "room" box thing for about a minute listening to the opening rifts of "Superman" by 3 Dicks Up My Face when a penguin came on the screen.  I yelled, "And now there's a fucking penguin?!?!  That's it, I'm out".  And I was. -Kyle and I drove around downtown last night.  I had one of those surreal/ perfect life moments when we were stopped at a red light next to Seahawks Stadium around midnight with the top down on his cute lil' car and The Sex Pistols' "Holiday in the Sun" rocking everyone in ear shot.  It was a Visa commercial.  We were young and rocking; we were American Eagle. -I spent some quality time with Ramones Girl. She told me that I woke up during the middle of the night on Wednesday laughing my ass off.  She asked me what was so funny and I sat upright in bed staring at the wall and started saying "Does anybody have any questions? Anybody? Anybody?".  Over the past couple of weeks I have, in my sleep, asked her "Where are the buildings?" and "When is the great race of 80 days on?  You don't know of the great race?".  Most girls would bolt, but she says it's entertaining to have a psychotic in bed with her.  I'm her R.E.M. cycle H.B.O.  That should say something about her. We have started to make plans for camping this weekend.  We are talking about going ot the Pacific Ocean (not the Caspian Sea) and camping on the beach.  That would be swell; I've seen the sunrise over an ocean but not set behind one.  I'm as squirrely as a prom night whore thinking about it. That's about it.  I have felt like I'm coming down with a cold all week.  I've been low on energy and kind of grumpy.  I'm going to go take a nap. I hope all of you kids starting school are having a good time.  This is the first time in almost 20 years that I haven't been in some form of school during the fall.   HMDA.  Can you believe those stooges on swing shift?

      I like being the new Roy.  People even refer to me as "The new Roy".  Roy's job is so simple and keeps me busy enough to not notice the time; although it does allow for plenty of day dreaming.  Today I reenacted the scene from "Desperado" where Antonio Banderas is hiding behind a counter and has to silently check his pistol for bullets so the bad guys don't hear him.  I held my pen up to my ear and slowly clicked the button on top while I ducked behind a file cabinet.  It let out a little click (just like in the movie!) and I made that "oooo" face.  Such a hottie.  Antonio? No, me.  I haven't really checked to see if the other people in the office have a clear view of me.  "The new Roy is making laser noises." There's a new annoying woman at work.  She doesn't scream about guacomole or look like a rat  like Screeching Woman of yore.  That chick looked like Minney Mouse came to life and then got shot in the face. This one has no inner-dialogue.  "I have to tinkle" "I was just at the little girls room" "I bought new shoes because my feet stink" "My phone is black" "I like pizza" "Eye blinking, breath, eye blinking, breath".  She sits right behind me.  Sometimes I go in the bathroom just to escape her.  And then I hear from the other side of the wall, "The urine is coming out of my urethra.  Leno was good last night"  What's worse,  she's the type of girl that makes a different voice for every occasion.  (British) "Hello, sir, how are we today" (Ghetto) "I gave you that file, boy" (LOUD) "I told her I like pizza. PHONE BLACK". I wonder if she gets hit at home; which, would raise the age old question, "Which came first, the hitting or the self-focused ego-building lack of confidence babble fest?".  I don't condone hitting.  But sometimes it's o.k. to shoot a dog. Enough about work.  That's not what defines me as a B.   I think the neighborhood kids are at the door.  I'm not going to go find out.  They keep asking me to come out and help fight some unruly teenagers who apparently are throwing rocks at the poor kids.  I never see these kids and I don't want to start a fight.  Teenagers are mean man and I might end up punching of them.  "Local man beats up kids with rocks". Right now I'm talking to some girl I used to bang; she is boring.  I don't even know what she is saying.  Something about boiling water and noodles.  God, I've slept with some dumb girls.  My brain keeps playing the "Harlem Globetrotters" theme song. She keeps asking me if I've met anyone new and I don't want to even have that conversation so I just keep saying "No".  She asks if I still smoke and I don't want a lecture so I say "No".    Now she's asking about my mom.  Has she even met my mom?  Ahhh, this is boring.  More boring the that horrible movie, "Phone Booth".  I need an out.  Quick brain, focus. "Brent, you are hungry." YES!  I am hungry!  I need food or I will die.  You don't want me to die.  No, I haven't cut my hair.  No, I don't remember the dinner with the birds overhead.  I haven't been up to anything.  I live in a box.  I have no friends.  I'm sorry, but I have to go.  I'll call you next week.  No, I'm not still a liar.  Freedom.  The whole point of me moving to Seattle was to de-barnacle myself.  Just keep humming the Globetrotters and keep your head down when the "tentacles" (wink) of the past come up from the deeps.  "Whore, she blows, c'apn"  "'Tis the great white skank".   I just bitched through this entire blog.  I think I'm going to go get some deli meat and make me a fatty sandwich and drink some coke.  Because that's what I like to do.  Let's end this on a pos note, B. When I was a little kid I went to the zoo with my mom, my brother, my godparents and their kids.  I was sitting on a wall surrounding the prairie dog pits.  I was having so much fun.  Until I fell in.  I hit my face and all the little prairie dogs ran to their holes.  As the people I was with scrambled to get the zoo workers the prairie dogs stuck their heads out, one by one.  I had gained their trust by not yelling and laying completely still. I got to go with my godfather to the world famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.  He was an anestheologist there.  I got checked out by a really pretty nurse and was giving a clean bill of health.  My godfather then showed me what doctors do during a day.  I got to see the operating rooms and he even gave me my very own pair of very baggy medical scrubs.  I wish I still had those.  And I wonder if the prairie dogs still talk about "The Day That Kid Fell In".  Have a good night, dorks.

      Dammit.  That story I asked to be read didn't really take place in the South.  That ruined my trifecta that I thought I had with the piece.  Who the hell cares about South Windsor, Connecticut skanks?  I don't.  They're just leftovers from the plethora of Kennedy skank bangings over the past few decades.  "Would you say I have a plethora of skank bangings?" "Si, John, I would say you have a plethora" "Ted, do you know what a plethora is?" I don't want blue blood hoochies, I require my trash pure Southern.  PBR blooded.  Read the story if you want, but it's ruined for me because I can't imagine her screaming "Daddy paid for this dress; you ain't my Daddy" no more.  Dammit.  She even jumped on the hood of a car and everything.   I'm all alone.  Not figuratively, literally.  I'm alone and sober.  This can't last long.  A sober B and an entire night alone don't mix well.  Like oil and vodka.  Mmmm, oil and vodka.  I think we have some olive oil in the pantry and the liquor store doesn't close until 9.  Boredom and sobriety problem solved, people.  Nothing more to say.

      Please read this story!  http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-819maritalbliss,1,7307132.story?coll=sfla-home-headlines  (oops, it doesn't create a link; I guess it's copy and paste time, dorkfaces)  Thank god for the South, alcohol and young tattooed skanks.  Without the first there'd be no "COPS" for me to watch, without the next no reason for me to run this silly web dealy, and if there were none of the later there'd be no porn.  God bless us, everyone.

      Not a good day.  I would say that it's because it's Monday, but that's for dorks.  Read the title, dorks.   I'm sorry, Brent didn't mean to yell at you.  He'll buy you some ice cream.   First off, this little kid with way too much hair keeps knocking on my front door while I'm writing this asking me if he can play video games.  Usually I'd say yes.  They're good kids; but, it's adult time.  That means movies with cussing and Marlboro Reds. Second, I just got back from a horrible game of disc golf.  I started out strong by paring the first hole, which I had never done.  On the second hole I got caught up behind a 4some and decided to repeat the hole after a double bogey.  My chance for redemption, right?  No, my time to throw a jackass hook that landed me right in the middle of a blackberry patch the size of my truck.  Scratched up and soar I decided to go onto the third.  Redemption song time?  No, again.  I hook again and go over a fence and land in someone's back yard.  After retrieval I attempted teeing off again.  The damned thing goes shorter than the first time I ever played. That's it, I'm done.  I packed up the discs and sped home.  My C.D. player was on the skids in the truck so I had to listen to the 80's station and a recount of the Butterbean/Larry Holmes pugalist spectacular on talk radio instead.  Man, that sounded like one lame fight.  A 50-year-old plus man beats the crap out of a super fat 30 something pop icon.  It's like Rocky 3 without the soundtrack. Before that I got a lovely letter from the Devil's cell phone company telling me that I had to pay a very large sum of money because Robocop now had my address and had been ordered to "Fuck the prime directives".  Curses, I knew this day would come.  So long cool new tennis shoes and premium whiskey and hello adulthood. And before that I had a very long and sleepy day at work.  Actually, work was all right, comparitively.  It was a slow day but I managed to stay very busy in spite of others mulling about the coffee machine chanting "There's nothing to do".   The salmon rocked last night.  Here's the recipe:  1/4 cup pineapple juice 2 TBS fresh lemon juice 4 (6 oz) salmon fillets   2 TBS brown sugar 4 tsp chili powder 2 tsp grated lemon rind 3/4 tsp cumin 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp cinnamon   Cooking spray Lemon wedges (optional)   Combine first 3 ingredients in a ziploc plastic bag, seal and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour, turning occasionally.   Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove fish from bag; discard marinade. Combine sugar and next 5 ingredients in a bowl. Rub over fish. Place in an 11x7" baking dish coated with cooking spray. Bake at 400°F for 12 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve with lemon, if desired. Serves 4  After dinner I walked around with my redheaded sweetheart looking for the moon to try and spot Mars.  We couldn't find it.  But, isn't pointless wandering with a newfound someone always the best?  I think we reached a definite mile marker in the relationship.  She broke the Terms of Endearment barrier yesterday.   "Wait, how do we get to Seattle?" I asked. "Honey, we're in Seattle," she replied.   This B is someone's honey.  Actually, I feel a little better now.   Fuck the promise of ice cream, reader person, I'm going to go make a phone call.

      Just got back from my Seattle date with the Ramone's girl.  Here's a quick list of fun and exciting things that happened to me today. 1.) We went down to Lake Washington where little kids were swimming and diving.  There was this dorky little lifeguard riding around a boat in 5 FEET DEEP WATER!?!?  Best overheard line from a little kid today: "You're going to get nunchucks on the head!" 2.)We then went to a restaurant down by the docks on the Puget Sound where a.) the waiter said this classic line:  "Hi, welcome to this restaurant, are you guys from around here? you live here so you know how we do it here, let's get down to business.  let's get this train a moving.  You probably want me to just be quiet and let you order, don't you.  She's thinking "I wish he'd be quiet".  I can tell she wants me to be quiet.  Do you?"  We did.  b.)Over excited waiter boy kept calling me "chief" or "boss" ($5 tip for a $10 tab right there), but he kept touching Ramone Girl's arm ($2 tip) then he called me buddy ($5 tip) and then he touched MY arm ($2 tip).   b.) we saw "party boat".  It's a boat (or type of boat) that goes around with 3 100 foot high streams of water shooting out of it it doesn't go near any of the boats.  When a boat comes near it it starts spinning.  I'm serious.  It is like Looney Tunes in Seattle.  What purpose does this boat serve?  Who needs a boat that shoots water into the air and then spins?  Who said "Dammit, we have it all a needle for the space and a bunch of other stuff; but, we don't have a boat that shoots water, avoids other boats and spins when excited."? c.) a bird flew under our table and started attacking Ramones Girl.  A woman passing by said "Ahhh, I hate those things". 3.)After the restaurant and a few minutes of standing on a deck trying to figure party boat out, we decided to head home.  I kept seeing a bunch of people wearing necklaces that had a bunch of pot leaves on them.  Then I remembered it was Hempfest, I grew curious.  This is an actual conversation I had with two stoner girls I saw at a crosswalk. B:So, where's this thing happening that's on your button? ("Thanks for pot smoking. Seattle HempFest) Stoner girl #1: What? B: The HempFest thing, where is it? Stoner girl #1: You mean the pot thing?  What's it called? B: HempFest Stoner girl #2: Potfair?  Stoner girl #1: Weedfest. HempFest.  Yeah, it's way up there, man.  You can take a bus.  For a $1.25 they give you a transfer ticket, so you can transfer. B: That's nice of them.  What do they have at the HempFest? Stoner girl #1: Stuff.  Lot's of stuff.  If you want pot stuff, go there. I didn't go there.  I have enough stuff. 4.) We went to an arcade where I played that quarter game where you drop the quarters and the machine knocks over quarters, I don't know if it has a name.  But with one quarter and one quarter only I won ... 67 MOTHERFUCKING TICKETS! HELL YEAH! I RULE!  I didn't want any of the prizes (A Kit-Kat, a South Park sticker, a Spongebob Squarepants mini mug) so we picked out the cutest kid there and gave her the tickets.  I am Robin Hood, I take tickets from the machines and give them to the cute. 5.) Soon after that we passed by the greatest street musician ever.  I call him that because he made up a song about us.  He looked like a beefy Michael Stipe and kept staring at us as if there was no Seattle, only us.  The song went something like this.  He plays basketball for Winthrop.   He's the last of the basketball players and he doesn't care.   He likes to play basketball and there's a girl with red hair.   He's a basketball warrior.  He likes to play, but he's the last and he's alone.  He continued to sing as we kept walking; for all I know he's still singing ("He's not here right now, but he's still in love with basketball").  It's the greatest song I've ever heard.  And it's all so true.   Today was such a great cure for a hangover.  No chance to be depressed, iced tea and vanilla ice cream.  I have to go cook Salmon now.  Apparently I'm making an ass load for a lot of people. The pressure is on.  I know burritos pretty well, but I kind of lied and said I could cook salmon ("Salmon? Fuck yeah, i've got a million receipes for the fishy fuck.") Why did I say I'd cook salmon for all of these people?  Sometimes I feel like I'm floating through life randomly grabbing beers and preparing fish.  Kyle told someone I'm like a little drunk puppy that keeps wandering around and getting lost.  Bark, fuckfaces.

      Sunday afternoon.  Hangover very much a part of my life.  Like a parrot on a pirate's shoulder that punches the brain instead of the squawking.  "B-Man want a migraine?"  Yesterday ruled.  I woke up in time to pound a couple cups of coffee before the lovely couple picked me up to head out to the amazing Bocce compound party.  The drive out there was beautiful.  I don't use that word very often; but, that's the only way to describe it.  Fucking beautiful is another way, I guess.   We got to the event around noon.  This house was amazing.  Fucking amazing.  It looks like an architectural mastermind was blindfolded and sent about a forest to create.  This place was like a less-pointy St. Basils; there was lots of stuff and it didn't seem like it should flow but it did". We played 3 games of Bocce ball (1-2 for the B) which I surprised myself by being able to pull out some amazing shots.  I'm hooked on Bocce.  Hamburgers, oriental sandwiches, Jack Daniels and AmberBock.  More Jack Daniels.  Arrogant B-Man remarks ("My boyfriend is a part-time cop" "Then I guess he's a piglet! Hahahahahaha") More Amber Bock.  Some more Bocce.  More arrogant remarks ("Well, they did give my idea a movie deal" "They gave 'Ernest Goes to Camp' a movie deal too").  Great conversation.  Even though a lot of the conversation was about musicals, it's amazing how much I care about musicals when I'm half lit and in the company of theater buffs.  It's my ability to blend in and get drunk in any environment ("Say, bishop, how 'bout a sermon and a Vodka tonic? I tell you, that Christ had one hell of a mother.")  The other B and I played a rag-tag game of disc golf through this amazing piece of the Northwest (skins match score 2-5.  I can never seem to win anything) which I had to throw from the top of a compost heap at one point.  I argued that should give me at least an extra skin for props sake.  No luck with that. Anyways, I was obnoxious but I met lots of interesting people.  I just hope I didn't say anything too jackass to embarass the h.c.  I guess I'll find out. After all of that I had a good old fashioned sibling ass kicking argument with Kyle.  Why?  Why not?  He's so cute when he clenches his fists and goes "Brent, I'm serious". There was more that happened but I don't want to think too hard right now.  Ramones girl is on her way over and I need to shower.  We're going to go down to this dock that we found on Mercer Island.  Maybe we'll watch some boats and drink some beer.  Maybe we'll just makeout in front of little kids.  I'll write more later.

      Do I dare it?  A drunk blog? Kyle took his socks off today and asked me to look at the tan lines on his feet.  Here were my responses: -Holy fuck, did Mom fuck a sasquatch? -What the hell?  Did God slap on some fallen trunks to the ends of your legs? - A family of 3 could feed for a year off of one of those goddamned things! - Are those fuckers registered? These feet are too huge.  Imagine a clown with huge red clown shoes.  Stop!  Now take away the shoes and there are my brothers feet.  It's like watching evolution forgotten.  "We will create a race of men with huge feet and they will ... what? An Adam's Apple? Yeah, that sounds kind of interesting.  Let's go with that." So, I've spent the night sipping Labatt Blue and calling people in Columbia I haven't talked to since I've left.  Actually, it's mostly been people I forgot to tell I was leaving.  So, most of my night has gone like this ... B: Hello, someone I once knew Columbia People: B-Man!  Holy shit!  I'm so drunk right now, where are you?  Are you still in Seattle? B: Yep.  I think I'll be here for a while.  Things are pretty good out here. Columbia People: I'm so glad for you! Some random girl you used to know just passed out on my arm .... talk to her! Random girl: Brent? B: Yea, Hi, It's Brent. Random Girl: Where are you?  When are you coming back? B: Seattle.  You know what, this is getting boring put the other person on the phone.  Aww, I miss those guys.  Nowhere else have I found that you can walk around completely shitfaced and yelling "Lube her up, I'm not drunk yet!".  Oh, Five Points, one of the last vistages where a P.B.R. chugging fratboy past his prime can find bliss.  For those of you that have never been there, imagine all that you know about the Old South with it's Hoop Skirts and Gone With the Wind's suddenly ripped down the seam, and replaced by Abercrombie and Bud Light.  (Upon later drunken editing I've decided it's best to start playing Grand Funk Railroad's "I'm Your Captain" at this point). Here you find the diehard and less political drunks out there sipping on $2 Beam and Cokes, but they stumble in between hoards of hair-spiked, "Abercrombie's Ice Shed" t-shirt wearing,  paying $4 for a Sam Adams trying-to-be-yuppies-in-the-middle-of-the-deadest-economy-in-the-country- boys who are somewhere between their sophmore and senior year.   Late at night, in the colder wind-whip of 5 Points, the pretty frat boys would run for cover and give us true alcohol soaked boys of the dark a chance to shine.  "Oh, that's right, you said your mom was dead".  "You know what, this shot would look better if we were making out".  "Look, I'm not going to remember your name; where the fuck did I park?" And in the morning it was O.K.  It happened in 5 Points, somewhere between Columbia and a college sophmore's Heaven. I need to shower.

      I forgot, dorkbabies. If you want to contact me, whether I know you or not, my email address is capt_zeppelin@hotmail.com This is kind of an experiment.  I've always thought about starting up a web business where I promise to respond to people's e-mails within 24 hours.  You know, help them the best I can with a problem, or be a buddy they can write to when they meet a girl or hit a double play during intramurals.  It'd be kind of like being in a frat; you know, paying for friends.  Booyeah, take that you fratboy pieces of .... oh yeah. So, anyways, write me and I promise you that one of our staff will respond to your comment or concern within one B-business day, which is a 24 hour party day, baby!

      If I was 8 years old today would be one of those days where I'd convince my mom that I was still a little too sick to go back to school.  Then after everyone went to work it'd be M.C. Hammer and "The Fall Guy" 'til after 5, baby! I would tell you about the ape women and how work tested me and how I bested it like Conan the Fuckbarian; but, I don't think so ... Because it's 3-day weekend time, baby!  Party over here!  Party over there!  Throw your hands in the air like you's a true playa!  All the ladies say "Heeey"!   Today I've been in the mood for music from my high school days.  So, it's been The Beastie Boys' "License to Ill" and Ice Cube's "Death Certificate".   Went out to eat downtown last night with R. Girl.  I treated her to a lil' spaghetti dinner (the worst I've ever had, my meat sauce was PINK!) b/c for some reason we have to reward people for getting a new car.  It still makes more sense than tipping your hairdresser, I guess ("Here's a tip, throw in a rubdown and we'll talk about cash.  Got it, sweets?").  We went to a popular restaurant down by the place where they filmed "The Real World: Seattle".  While we waited for a table we looked for "party boat" and watched dolphins swimming in the exact spot where Stephen slapped Irene!  And for you Seattle-ites, you know where I ate.  Yes, I sold out, but the convenience factor was so convenient. The table next to us was this hyper-nuclear family with 5 little kids.  Three of them were singing this song that had only one line, but that was stuck in my head for the rest of the night. "I love my Chi--nese food". One little girl would only say "I hate my Chi--nese food".  I agreed, but mine was spaghetti. The other kid was this dark-haired ugly fatty in the midst of these blonde haired Heidi clones.  Damn, it has to suck not to look like the rest of your family AND be the ugly one ... Kyle? I had awesome dreams last night!  The one I clearly remember was being at a restaurant eating with some random people I know when all of a sudden a younger Ronald Reagan comes up and says "B-Man why don't you look me up when you're in Chicago next week so we can catch up".   "Cool, Reagan," I said, "Why don't you call up General Patton and we'll all go grab a beer."   "Sounds good, I gotta run," said Ronny.   I felt like the diplomatic shit. An overheard story from today: "Do you like my purse?  My house cleaner brought it back for me from Uraguay.  She's such a wonderful woman.  She's so sweet and tries so hard to get ahead.  I do what I can to help her out, because she has a hand in my home ... I mean my heart."  I thought the first one was much more honest.  Fuck yeah, take care of the people who have hands in your home.  Otherwise, you might wake up missing a Playstation2 one day. Well, I think it's time for me to get this party started B-styley.  I'll holla at a dork.  Damn, I feel hip hop.  Where's my Kangol hat?

      I'm feeling better today, thanks for asking. I have that post-cold crummy feeling.  I'm randomly breaking out into cold sweats and cigarettes taste like burnt glue.   I've made plans for frisbee golf with R. Girl, but I think I'll have to cancel.  I don't think the body is up for 18, or even 3, holes of whipping discs and walking.  Instead I think we should go on a little jaunt about the city in her new car.  I love new car days.  They are very rare, and I feel we should take full advantage of this one.  You know, riding around going "This is nice" and "How fast will it go?".   I really don't have much news because all I've done is slept and worked in the past 48 hours.  I did have some random dreams.  In one I returned to Columbia to say hello to everybody.  Everything had changed and nothing was in the right place.  Walking the streets made me very nervous and I kept slipping on wet floors and icy sidewalks.  Everyone I knew was in a very large park for what seemed to be a "Welcome Home B" party.  Instead, it was just a huge conincidence.  I was drunk and people kept saying to me "You shouldn't have done that" and I kept saying "I don't care what I should have done; I did it".  I quickly ran back to Seattle. When I got back here, in my dream, I was in a huge field looking up on a large 200 foot tall snowy cliff.  There were about 50-or-so snowboarders jumping off of it.  They were falling about 100 feet each and then landing in a large snow pile.  I kept thinking "Are these kids cool?"  I decided they weren't and kept wondering if they were hurting themselves.  They weren't getting up from the snow drift and more kept jumping on them.  Weird and vivid shit. I really smell like cigarettes.  I've been trying to catch up on my blood to nicotine ratio and now I smell like my grandpa pre-cancer.  I need to wash up and drown in some Listerine.  I'll have more to say, dorkbabies, once I actually get out of here and enjoy this fucking beautiful Seattle day.

      Two things learned from this cold. 1.) They use Sudafed-type products to make crystal meth, or crank if you like.  When you buy it at stores, old women look at you like you're a fiend.  If I had known earlier I would have twitched and asked where the best place to boost was. 2.) Blowing in someones ear and coughing in it produce two different affects. I don't recommend the later. I left work after only one hour today.  Right when I showed up with my head Sudafeded out (I was tweaking!), my nose running and N.I.D. Girl screaming "Clyde, I think bagels are good", I knew it was going to have to be a sick day.  What clenched it though was N.I.D. Girl turning to me and saying "This day has been from Poopityville".  I agree, freak; I'm out. I slept and I had those fun halucanegenic (I don't care if I misspelt that, the dictionary is too heavy to pick up right now) dreams that come with a cold and crank.  I dreamt about dinosaurs and laser tag and for some reason it was fucking important for me to get to the grocery store.  Last night I dreamt that I had stolen a car and moved out to a Pacific Northrwest island to oversee a paper mill.  Anybody with one of them dream analyzing books want to take a stab at those? Today I'm going to avoid sunlight, eat soup and try to ignore the nicotine addiction that is telling me to "Fuck the chest; light up".  I know he'll win eventually, just like my thirst for Sudafed will call me out into the Seattle streets looking for meth dealers and drag bars.  I like pretending that I'm skirting the edges of hard drugs by taking these little white pills.  This might be why I eat poppy seed muffins and drink Coke. Last night I watched "The Burbs" with the comedic brilliance of Younger Tom Hanks.  The movie dragged more than I remember from watching it as a kid, but I blame that on Jerry Bruckheimer.  A great flick for stuffy nights.  Best parts: "This is Walter!" "AHHHHHHHH" and Tommy boy coming out of the ruins of the neighbors house. All right, I need to go watch T.V. or do laundry or eat.  I don't think I have the energy for all three.  Maybe an addiction to speed would come in handy.

      The cold I was dodging and drowning in Budweiser last week finally caught up with me.  I feel stuffed up and cold.  This damned thing came on fast too.  I was sitting around watching "Dude where's my Car?" after playing Bocce ball with the lovely couple when I became instantly sick.  No build up, I went from not sick to sick and now I'm cold fever chest cough sick. I don't feel like writing and I don't have anything much more to say except it is hard to write.   I'll try and write later, but I don't think you want to know about runny nose updates.  So, it's time for soup and cough drops, thanks to the lovely advice of a very special girl named Liz.  Thanks, slut, and goodnight, dorks.

      So much to tell you about, sweet things. I've had such a great and busy past few days.  But first I want to tell you what happened to my brother on Friday. Kyle is the blonder and more sober version of me.  He kind of floats through life with, as far as I can tell, the mindset of a 12-year-old suddenly thrown into a 21-year-old's body.  Anyways, this is what happens when my little brother goes boating. Kyle and his work buddies were out on a boat (I'm guessing in the Puget Sound) and everyone is enjoying the scenery.  Well, except for Kyle; Kyle becomes obsessed with a duck that is floating near the boat.  His buddies challenge him to catch the duck and Kyle hops in the water to get it.  The duck gets away but this just pisses Kyle off.  After getting back on the boat Kyle goes "We're catching that fucking duck".  My words coming out of an aryan body.   So this boatload of dweebs goes tearing ass around for half an hour after this damned duck.  I can only imagine what the thing was thinking. "Quack. Why? Quack."  They can't catch the duck and Kyle gets to his breaking point.   "Pull up along side the duck at full speed.  I'm going to jump out and grab him and punch him and break his fucking neck, then I'm going to stuff the fucker and put him in my office."  Good idea, dork. So Kyle jumps off the side of the boat as they pass the duck going shitfuck fast.  Only he doesn't tell the guy driving the boat that he's about to jump.   Here's what happens when this scenario is set up.   While Kyle is in the air and before he hits the water, the boat turns sharply so that Kyle is now face to face with the front of the boat.  As Kyle hits the water, the boat hits Kyle.  Kyle's friends say they looked over the side and saw his legs "going really fast" in the opposite direction of the boats path.  Kyle is shot underwater by the force of the boat for about 10 yards and suddenly pops up way the fuck away from it.  He was O.K. but he didn't get the duck.   This is my new favorite Kyle story.  Mom just called and asked how everyone was.  "Kyle got hit by a boat"  "What, what, what?" "Yeah, you should probably call him." Onto the B news. Work was work.  A goateed man ignored elevator rules again today.  This shit is getting weird. Camping was super fucking great.  After a late start (thanks to two late night Mickey's 40 oz.s) we got down to the state park in Ocean Shores.  When we get there there is a huge sign that says "Camp Full".  "This doesn't apply to us," I say, and I proceed to go find me a park ranger.   "Is the camp full?" I said. "You know it's full; you saw that big brown sign," said the park ranger.  And you can't sweet talk a park ranger, friends.  They've heard it all.  "C'mon, sweet stuff, I'll let you see what I got for some kindling". So, we went on to the next camping site.  This place was like that scene in National Lampoon's Vacation, you know the one after the one where the two girls get high.  Here's another conversation I had. "Are you full?" "Only tent spots we got are next to that table out there." Next to the table also meant next to the road, a thorny bush and this guys office.  And this guy meant swatting flys and drool, he was all about that shit. "You don't have any of those wooded areas?" "What? No! Those are all gone, I just said that!" "Yeah, I know." So, we went to the next camping site.  This place was like a yuppies wet dream.  For 10 bucks you got a picnic table, a fire pit and your own personal log to sit on and tell ghost stories.  We pitched our tent ... oh wait, about our tent.  This thing is fucking precious.  It became our common child.  It's a two person trail tent from Coleman.  It's one of those ones you'd see Boy Scouts from the 1950s using.  It's this tiny red triangle thing with a yellow tarp bottom.  It was so cute that I wanted to makeout with it. After setting "Tenty" up, we headed out for the ocean.  But this wasn't as easy as going to Myrtle Beach and falling in the Ocean, you lucky East Coast fuckers.  We had to trudge through underbrush and then cross this treacherous log bridge across an inlet, which we let some teenagers cross before us.  "What are you just going to watch us to see if it's safe?" "Fuck yeah I am."  After that we had to trudge through sand that would sink about 6 inches with every step.  After about 200 yards of this we finally reached the ocean, which was foamy brown and cold as a Minnesota handjob.  (Great fucking simile, B). It was gorgeous though.  The waves were choppy and harsh.  The wind made nipples hard in beach fashion but for different reasons.  I needed a sweatshirt and boots instead of my t-shirt and flip flops. Standing there on Danger Beach I realized that it would never be corrupted by dance clubs or cokehead bikini skanks.  Never would this beach hear "Daddy, take me to the arcade" or "Hoooeee".  It was perfect, and I felt like Leonardo DiCaprio having gotten there.   We walked along the beach looking for full sand dollars.  I've never found an unfucked one.  Maybe that is my lot in life.  After a good while of looking we headed back.  R. Girl fell into the inlet when the log bridge gave out under her.  "Sucks for you," I said and decided to strap on a pair and just wade the fucker.  I did, and I have the cock to prove it. I showed baby doll how to play frisbee golf back at the camp.  I ran barefoot through a patch of briars and got about a hundred stuck to the bottom of my feet.  "Sucks for you," she said.  Actually she said I looked cute pulling them out with the blood on my fingertips.  Weird shit is cute to some people, man. We then went and bought firewood from a very crazy old man on the side of the road.  He told us he was the mayor of a Seattle subarb and that his face was on a statue of a very well hung dog.  I don't understand either, dorks.  He took me over to his truck and showed me how to judge the quality of firewood.  By his standards, I have to say, he did have some fucking great firewood.  He liked me and told me to "stay here" he wanted to give me something.  "What could it be?" I thought as he started walking deep into the woods.  Gold?  A treasure map?  A hatchet to my jugular?  Nope, just more wood.  But special wood he said to make our fire warmer.   Side note: This whole situation made me very nervous.  However, R. Girl was having a fucking ball with this guy.  After reading that "The name Brent means you suck" thing (posted below) the other night I have become worried that I will end up bitter and with a fucked up solar plexis.  I have started taking cues from other people on how to handle situations that make me nervous, like crazy old men telling me they want to show me something.  Normally I'd say "Not today, rapist" and run away.  Instead I followed R. Girl's lead and laughed along.   We shook crazy fuck's hand and drove off.  He can be found somewhere on the "what do they call it ... the intro-net?", but he couldn't remember where.  Great guy. I made fire.  I am all that is beast and ape.  I took wood and I built the blaze of blazes which cooked the meat of dead animals for me and my woman.  I am a primal sweatshirted God. We had an early night, doing nothing with Ramones Girl is a very full day.  The less we do the more fun we have.  It's perfect for being a cheap anxiety-ridden ass. The tent started dripping condensation at some point in the night and when we woke up everything was wet.  And not in the good way, dorks.  I was up at 4 and had a fire going by the time the sun started to come up.  We decided to skip the camping breakfast since we were both damp and grumpy and find us a Denny's. All in all the camping trip was the shizzy and I think I could really like Ramone's Girl if things keep up the way they are.  But, that's personal, so back off you tabloid fucks. Other things to discuss: -The Twins are 1.5 games back, baby fucks!  They survived interleague play and can smell the spoils of the Fall Classic.   "My baby does the Homer Hanky!" Eh? Eh? -No Inner Dialogue girl was suprisingly quiet today.  "My stapler smells like toothpaste," was the extent of her observations.  Although she did stab at me with her pen when I walked by her desk.  We've never even talked and she's trying to stab me.  There goes my solar plexus. -Eva Moore is super cool.  Check our her fun adventures in linguistics and sexy alternativeness at www.clevertitle.150m.com  -I downloaded some stuff from www.suicidegirls.com from Kazaa Lite.  I was expecting buck naked goth girls going at it with Barbie Dolls and whips.  Instead I find out it's like some kissing, a couple tit shots and mostly just chicks telling stories like "I like punk music" or "One time I had to walk down a hill".  What a gip.  I'm starting my own porn site.  It's going to be www.chickswhorocknextdoortoyourwhileyouarewatchingseinfeld.com Coming soon. I grow weary of writing now.  I'm going to go play frisbee golf.  I love you.

      On those nights where you are all alone because sweethearts are tired and brothers are out watching gang members fight with his new found Justice Dorks of America, you sit alone and watch movies.  Then you make sandwiches.  Then you look up porn. And as a straight male all alone on those nights you ask yourself this question. "Am I attracted to transsexuals?" "I am attracted to pretty girls.  I am not attracted to pretty boys.  But what if a pretty boy became a pretty girl?  Would that be passable prom date material for me?" Then you take to the internet.  How these questions were answered pre-internet explosion I do not know. Come to find out, a lot of transsexuals are Brazillian.  Or so they say.  If they are telling the truth someone should really look up why so many pretty boys in Brazil have forgone soccer for transsexual porn.   "Welcome to Brazil.  If you have a penis you can stuff it into soccer shorts or a thong." But all transsexuals have gone for that skanky "I just got back from Myrtle Beach and got hair braids" look.  I don't like that look and so I decided that I wasn't attracted to transsexuals.   I don't know if they have any Catholic school girl transsexuals (I'm sure some preist would know) or Lauren Ambrose or Kirstie Alley chicks with dicks.  Those might do it.  Well, at least until they took their thongs off.  Not so sure I could swing that bat. Sweet dreams about that, dorks.

      I just finished watching "Bowling for Columbine".  The cover of the DVD has a review that says "Funny".  Yeah, I laughed; but, the they should have had a review that said "Honest" instead. I don't want to talk about the specifics of the movie or how I'm kicking my ass for not going to see it in the ONE Columbia theater that showed it.  I knew all of the facts that were said in the movie.  I have studied poli sci, media literacy and race relations.  What I want to talk about is the one truth that was said in the movie. We are mad at nothing. I just gave Kyle my theroy that the U.S. is a high roller strung out from a 20 year poker game.  We won the cold war (purposely left in lower caps, fuckers) when Ronald Reagan played history's biggest bluff known as "Star Wars".  We were not going to put lasers in space.  We had no intention on building this silly project.  (In fact if you ever see some old coverage of that silly speech, note the reaction on half the people's faces ... I've never seen more "yeah, right"s in my life).  It was a bluff.   http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/1777/poly/rrcoldwr.html Russia had built up a nuclear arsenal larger than ours.  But, really, how many times can you blow up the world?   So, we bluff that we're getting ready to build this defense system that would make nuclear weapons obsolete.  Imagine you're a Russian. "What?  Really?  We put all of our fucking money into this goddamned arms race and they are going to make it obsolete?  Can they do that?  Yes?  Oh, shit, we're fucked." That was it, the worlds greatest bluff ended the cold war. But, if you are America you can't just say, "Just fucking with you." (P.S. I'm not a Republican, but it's O.K. to admit that the other guys came up with some good ideas) Everything since that point has been a super inflated hyper active arms race to beat nobody.  Which brings me back to the poker game. We have noone to play but we are so excited that we won the "big match" that we have been on a 20 year(ish) bender.  "Who's going to play me next?  You? You? You?"  No one has ever wanted to play. "Fuck that. Panama, you play him." But, we Shanghaied us a couple of apponents.  Now the rest of the spectators get nervous.  "Maybe we should punch the fucking hyper Maverick before he gets us next."  I would. Which brings me to my big point that I wanted to say after watching this movie.  I have seen the pointless anger that is incorporated in us by a chase for goods and a lifestyle we can't ever reach.  Even those skinny blonde fucks in the ads go home to cocaine and bitchy girlfriends, people.   Wrap this up, Brent.  I wanted to share with you 2 typical Americans who are (or were) scared of the world outside. Case study #1:  When I was working at the great supermarket in high school this dude came in one day.  I was bagging his groceries and noticed he had F.T.W. tattoed on his arm.  Unlearned in the was of the angry world as I was, I asked what it meant. "Fuck the world." I didn't say another word.  But I kept thinking, "Why is he so mad?" "Fuck the world?  Fuck you!  Carry your own goddamned groceries that I just bagged for you so I can make enough money not to ask my single mother for gas money to go to school and take my fat girlfriend to a movie where I won't make out.  Fuck the world?  Buddy, I am the world." The second was this guy from just the other day.  It was when me and R. Girl were heading out to camp.  We were driving down the interstate when all of a sudden this fucker pulls into my lane.  He ran me off the road, which, naturally, upset me.  But the guy has the nerve to look in his rearview mirror and start telling me to "Fuck off" while giving ME the finger.  He cut ME off!  It was ME that almost died!  After a few seconds of me screaming "I'll fuck your world" and R. Girl giving him the doulbe bird (you know, both hands at once) did the guy calm down and realize his mistake.  He gave the "I"m sorry" wave and as a citizen of this world I had no choice but to accept it and give the all encompasing "It's ok, you're a good guy" tilt of the hat. Good stories.  But within them are what's wrong with this country.  Daddy hated us or we got arrested for crank possesion and all of a sudden we say "Fuck the World" every time we reach for something?  Are we so caught up on fucking others over that we don't look at our OBVIOUS mistakes and realize we were wrong.   We can't even say we're wrong.  We have to tattoo ourselves to protect our silly lifestyles that are fake and based on GAP ads anyways.   You're mad at someone for something.  Don't fuck the world. You cut me off.  Calm down.  We lived.  I flip you off, you shake your head like an idiot and we drive on. There's no need for any of this anger.  Who are we mad at?  I think ourselves.  We watch 9/11, we watch Columbine, we watch all of these things and we KNOW that it's not the kids or the Middle Easterners.  It's us.   That's why we are mad.  We cut off the world and don't want to admit we aren't as cool as we thought.  So let's all run out and tattoo our arms, right? Think about that, dorks.

      I left work early today.  I was done playing Roy.  Before I left I did the "Look At Brent" round.  I don't know if this is a common office practice; it'd be cool to say I invented the move.  On days where I want to leave early I go on a little jaunt around the office and talk to as many people as I can.  "Say, fella with that box, how's the U.P.S. situation?" "Oh, hey, female superior, did you get that e-mail about that thing that involves something in Houston?"  "Say, person at the coffee machine, did you hear the one about the Jew, the penguin and the abortionist?" "Well, that's unappropriate, Brent." "That's right.  And remember I said it at roughly 4-4:30 p.m. on Wednesday." The idea is that if anyone asks for me in the half hour to hour that I'm supposed to be there, plenty of people will say "I just saw him" and lead whoever is looking for me to assume I'm somewhere else.  And when 4:30 rolls around, "I guess he just left" will be in their head. The more I work this office job the truer my earlier theory about office work becomes.  People in offices don't really do anything.  Collectively, sure, they might spit something out.  But, as a single human, no one person is needed, ever. Over the past couple of days I have started to reach out to N.I.D. Girl.  After the Labor Day weekend I was sure she'd be full of stories.  "And then there were hamburgers and I ate one.  And then we saw clouds.  And then we drove to buy Listerine at the store.  And then I payed for the Listerine.  I like the blue kind.  The yellow kind hurts.  Hurts my mouth.  My mouth is on my head.  My head is connected to my body by my neck.  I once saw a man with a big neck.  Where are my fingers?  Oh, on my hand." Instead she only had one story, which, granted she did tell everyone that came by her desk.  "I watched my sister's kid and she was late.  She said she was sorry.  I didn't have anywhere to go, but I was still upset.  The kid is a wild one." This made me sad.  The extent of her 3 day weekend was a little kid.  The extent of my 3 day weekend was balloons, making out, statues, getting ripped and Seinfeld.  Comparitively I win the weekend contest.   I realized that this woman doesn't have a boyfriend, or partner I guess I should say in the progressive and heavy sexual alternative lifestyle city of Seattle.  Is being gay still considered "alternative"?  Are the "Spin Doctors" still considered the same?  Alternative, not gay. Back to N.I.D. Girl.  I couldn't help but feel sorry that this woman only has this job to come to and talk to C. from Washington Mutual about what is happening to her at that exact moment.  Because, that exact moment is all this woman has.  She doesn't have a dorky brother to make fun of and try to get drunk, she doesn't have someone to kiss and tell they are sexy, she doesn't have a Lovely Couple to play alternative (not gay or Spin Doctors) sports with.   So, I've started talking to her.  And I've learned that if I speak to her I can stear the course of our conversations.  It might be harsh to hear her voice but at least I hear "McDonalds is good" compared to "Boys are not the same as girls". One thing she did say today that made me look up to see if it was actually true, because this is N.I.D. Girl we are talking about.  "My ears are on fire".  I was half expecting to see her ears fucking blazing when I looked up.  Oh well, it's still funny to think about. I am gross.  I spent the night with R. Girl last night, dorkbabies.  And that's all you get out of that.  She's cute.  There, there's a little tidbit of smut for your sick minds.  Go read porn! Anyways, I didn't want to leave this morning and calculated the Shower/Sleep ratio.  You know, it's a highly mathematical formula where you figure out the number of hours since your last shower, factor in number of physically exerting things done and relative ratio of closeness to stinky stuff and then come out with a number (x) which is then compared to the ammount of time it takes to shower (y).  If  x is less than y there is no need to shower and sleep can continue.   However, now I feel gross and nervous about skipping out on work.  I will shower and then watch Seinfeld or go play frisbee golf (which I've fallen out of rotation of the past couple of weeks).   I hope all of the dorks out there are good and healthy little dorks.  I'm sorry I haven't written much in the past couple of days.  I have been busy being caught up in the fun parts of a new relationship.  You know, "Do you like Led Zeppelin" and "Is that a freckle?" Later, dorks.

      I did nothing today. I could bore you and talk about how I cleaned my truck or downloaded 20 Seinfeld episodes.  But, you don't care and I don't want to bore you with that. Instead, in honor of Labor Day, which I told R. Girl should be renamed Non-Labor Day, I think I'll play James Brown's "I Feel Good" and tell you all a bad  joke. How do you spot an elephant on the moon? He's the one with a giant "E" on his space suit. Happy Labor Day, dorks.

      I am sad. Charles Bronson died on Saturday. This was a man who said his face looked "like a rock quarry that someone has dynamited".  He was the Tunnel King in the movie that bonded me and my father.  He was the man who put nails through a board that sprung up and killed trespassers in "Death Wish".   He was the man who I shared a birthday with. Every November 3rd I would say to myself "Happy Birthday, Charles Bronson". I need to watch "The Great Escape" and cry. Live life, dorks.

      There's a nice cool breeze blowing out the remains of a perfect Seattle day.  Friday night (in between drunk blogging):  Kyle had a dorkfest over here.  These are the kind of dorks I like though.  They drink beer and when I say things like "I hope South Carolina kicks ass tomorrow!"  they nod their heads and pretend to care.   We have discovered another thing that I do great with a few beers in me ... Soul Caliber 2.  It's this game that Kyle bought a few days ago and these dorks were going ape shit over on Friday.  After an hour or so of feeble attempts to get them to wrestle me ("C'mon I'm the DorkKrusher, Bring it On!") I decided to give their game a whirl.  I kicked their ass so hard and began to realize that I had played the first game in between drinking and class when I was a sophomore ("C'mon, professor, I'm the ProfKrusher, Bring It On!").  That was fun and then I passed out. Saturday morning I woke up late and in a non-showered sweaty hurry to find a present for Great Cousin because the Lovely Couple was throwing a b-day party for her that afternoon.  Kyle had come down with my cold and since I was hungover on top of that we bickered through every store that we were in. "Dammit, dude, she doesn't read comic books!" "Dude, I'm going to smack you. Shut up and get the hell away from the video games.  We're on a mission!" "No, Mom loves ME more.  She told me so ... wait, what about balloons?" So, we ended up getting a lovely arrangement of balloons.  In the center of the arrangement was a Harry Potter balloon b/c Great Cousin loves Harry Potter. Here's how Kyle fucked that up. After getting together with Ramone's Girl (yes, this would be the day she would meet the family beyond the dorky blonde version of me) we decided to head over to the Lovely Couples for some par-taying. "Dude, are you sure you want to take the balloons in a convertible?" "Brent, look, it's only a 3 block drive.  Nothings going to happen to them." "Allright, but I'm following behind you to make sure." "Whatever, Brent, you know, sometimes ...." "Blow me." End of conversation.  So, me and R. Girl are following behind King Dork when not 30 seconds into the drive (but they were a fun 30 seconds of watching the balloons hit his face repeatedly) the fucking balloons fly out the back of his car and almost hit my truck.  They land behind me and in the center of the road.  The people behind us are verring and swerving to avoid the balloon baracade.  After a few minutes of pure Stoogian comedy we get the balloons back from a car full of girls who I'm sure Kyle hit on in the process.  "So, you hang out on the side of this busy road often?" To cut the story short 30 more seconds into the ride the Harry Potter balloon sails off behind the car and was never heard from again. The party was great.  The Lovely Couple knows so many interesting people and it's always fun to sit around and have conversation time with them.  Ten minutes after being there I had forgotten that I was missing College Football kick-off Day.  Later on in the day we played a couple rounds of Bocce Ball.  It was boys v. girls (finally score 1-1).  R. Girl turned out to be a natural ass kicker at Bocce and became the ringer for the girls side.  I, on the other hand, was quickly labeled as the not-good player for the guys.  You know you're not doing good when your own team laughs when the other team says "Oh, too bad you suck, Brent". A great day nonetheless, and everyone liked Ramones Sweety.  I was nervous about the whole meeting, to be honest.  I don't know why, I guess I'm just used to friends and family saying things about other girls I've known like, "Umm, does she abuse cocaine?" "Oh, yeah, she seems nice ... for a retard" or "Brent, that's obviously a man."  And, you know what, deep down I knew Suzzie-Carl was a man. It was an early night for all.  I decided to pass up on earlier promises to "Get ripped and kick a little ass".  R. Girl started having girl problems and the night was kept quiet and full of "Your cute" and "Do you want me to rub your back?". Today I slept in until noon and skipped showering.  I love being a man on Labor Day weekend.   After meeting R. Girl's parents and aunt in a rushed attempt to get medicine for girl problems, we went downtown.  We wanted to find a couple of statues. The first was the one of the dog with the face of the man that had sold us firewood last week.  We found it, but the mystery of whether it was the guy is still afoot. The next was a quick stop off at the Troll under the Fremont Bridge.  This thing is a huge concrete fuckbeast of an artpiece.  http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/WASEAtroll.html  Check it out here.  It can descibe better and with more sober brevity than I. That was about it, you perverts. I'm tired of writing now.  It feels like work and this is my labor day weekend.  I'm going to get ripped and watch "Road Warrior" and "Animal House".   You are all so fucking cute, ya dorks.

      I love my fucking life, sweet dorks. A few minutes ago, at work, I mention that I wanted to go see "Laser Led Zeppelin" at the Science Center downtown.  The lady at the desk nearby pipes up, "My friend is the manager there" and after a phone call "O.K. I have 4 tickets for you to go tomorrow night".  Sweet. So, I decide to get a cup of coffee to celebrate.  I pass by Cool Guy's desk and stop to tell him about the game last night.  After a little sports swap I say "Yeah, I'd like to go see a Huskies game this year;  I sure miss college football.  Maybe I'll call up my frat and see if I can score some tickets."  Turns out that Cool Guy's good friend is the Alumni Chair for my fraternity.  I'm alum, and now I have an in for student tickets at UW. And this is how my life has gone always.   "I think this thing is cool," I'll say. Ring, goes the phone. "Hey, B, it's someone you know.  You know that new cool thing you like?  Well, a semi truck flipped over in front of my house and now we have a bunch of them all over our yard.  Want one?" "Yes," I'll reply. "Oh, and we have too much beer in our fridge; can you drink it?  Also, our just-turned 18 years old slutty daughter needs a prom date." Sometimes I wonder if it's a joke played by Fate that I suffer from low-level depression.

      So, it was Texas and Seattle, not Anaheim. And I didn't actually use the centerfield tickets last night like I wrote about. I used the box seat tickets that we got when some dude pulled up at the bus stop in an IROC or a Z and handed them over. He had adult braces, which always makes me a little uncomfortable. The seats were between 3rd base and home plate and about 30 rows back.  It was awesome.  We showed up around the 3rd inning because we wanted to go grab some bourbon from this little bar downtown that boasts "The world's largest selection of bourbon".  It was a lot of fucking bourbon to choose from.  And good too. The electricity went out at Safeco Field when someone drove a truck into a power line near the stadium.  I felt like I was back in the South again for a minute.  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/139038_lightsout10ww.html I need to work ... or play space genocide.  I'll decide over some coffee.

      Take B out to the ball game. Take B out to the crowd. Buy B some beer and a hat watch him run on the field and steal a bat. So, let's loot loot loot the souvenier stands  God, I love this fucking game. Cause it's 4, 15, 34 beers and you're drunk  At the ol' ball game!  Just got a call from the better part (ha) of the Lovely Couple and he has an extra ticket to go see tonight's Seattle/Anaheim game.   "Want to go?"  "Fuck yeah, I do." Today has been such a good day.  I woke up so fucking hungover and an hour late for work.  But that was o.k. because of 2 things.  The first is I had an awesome night getting ripped with R. Girl, her friends and King Dork/Batman last night. "Listen up, girls, I'll give one of you 5 dollars if you steal that guy's shirt.  I like it."  "Muthafuckin' STYX, baby!" The second is that I got to take an amazing hour long nap today during my half hour lunch break.  So smooth. When I got back to work I was instructed to join in with a class about how to do things with computers and files and skulls.  So, I went ... like I was actually going to work after a nap.  Hmph. The class was full of Obvious Staters/News-Fueled Single Moms.  You college kids know these people well.  They are that chick in the class who is older than everyone and who obviously has been through some stuff so she decides to go back to school to show her father/ex-husband/boss that they are empowered and strong.  But instead of being a typical college drunk they sit and class and talk and point out things and talk about their kids. "When I'm watching television I don't let my child see the gore or the sex.  It makes him hit the dog and use foul language.  I've heard about these movies where people actually lose their ..." "Shut the fuck up." My office is where these women come after they give up on college b/c none of the hot frat boys (booyea) won't bang them and the alimony tuition ran out.  So, when you put them all together it becomes this nonstop babble fest.  A lesson that would have lasted 30 minutes in college took 2 and a half hours. "I see what your saying, but sometimes when I look at my computer I will see that I have a phone next to it.  I call someone and we talk about files. September 11th." "I agree, but generally when I use a phone there is another person on the other end.  I will say "Hello" and they will say "Hi" or "Hello" also.  And roughly 2-156 minutes later I hang up.  It's a process that works for me.  SARS." "I find that it's best to say 'Hello'.  Yeah, baby, very shagadelic.  And when I hang up, I put the receiver back on the cradle. 9/11" "I already said that." But it was fun b/c I got to sit across from this younger woman in my office who has to be from South Africa or Uganda or something.  The way she talks is melodic.  "I watch-ed the mo-vie Rush-MORE".  I sat through the entire meeting imagining her reading me "Huck Finn" or The Playboy Advisor.   "Gener-ally, the male cli-max lasts on-ly a few secONDS.  We should take the raft SOUTH to eventu-ALLY head NORTH." Wonderful. Well, I need to go grab some McFuckingDonalds before I head to the game, you nosy fuckers. Yippee, dorks, baseball.

      Folks, we have a winner.  Mz. Eva Moore, that's THE Mz. Eva Moore from Perfect Sleeper, has won the first Win Stuff From Brent's Whacky Life Contest.  Mz. Moore (why am I using the Mz. title?) will receive the original Roy nameplate as well as detailed instructions on how to use the space commander chair.  And for getting all of today's 5 songs at 5 correct (answers: The Monkees, P.M. Dawn, Gladys Night sans Les Pips, R.E.M. and R.E.M.) Mz. Moore has won the grand prize of No Inner Dialogue Girl's Sharpie marker!  Stay tuned for more chances to win with the Win Stuff From Brent's Whacky Life Contest! "Where's my Sharpie?  It makes black ink go on white paper.  Sometimes the paper is blue!  Red cars pay more for insurance.  The Titanic was a boat!  A water boat!" Moving on to Frame Stage in a relationship is harder than it sounds.  First you have to say goodbye to pre-frame stage.  You've made a commitment now, buddy.  With frame stage comes the no more having Hustler issues laying around the room responsibility and the knowledge that flower buying is coming up very soon.  Next is toothbrush stage (which I've already accomplished at R. Girl's apartment thanks to some desperate emergancy brushing after camping) then the dreaded tampon stage and then you die. But, the hardest part so far has been actually picking out the frame. I bought one yesterday at the Northwest version of Wal-Mart, Fred Meyer (who's slogan is "We charge a dollar more for a 2 liter of Coke b/c we are hipper than Wal-Mart").  I was half asleep and bought a frame much too big and I had to return it.  Actually, that wasn't too hard.  I guess I'm just used to only having to remember to return my Soprano's D.V.D.'s to the video store and eat McDonalds once a day.   Last night was sleepy night.   Laundry was forgone like a pretty young Brazilian boy's hopes of soccer greatness.  Instead I played "Tiger Woods 2003" with Kyle. I got him this for his 21st birthday, which is Saturday, by the way.  I played this game a lot in college and it always leads to beer drinking so I figured if he wanted to be a responsible young drunk male he should have this game.  It's fun.  Enough. We're switiching from UPS to FedEx at work!  Roy would be so jealous, dorks.   I require pysical activity today.  I don't think I've told, y'all, but this damned cold has stayed with me for near 2 weeks now.  It's been phlegm and sniffles for 13 days now.  I've been sleepy and rundown and I need some sun and to watch little kids hit each other at football practice.  So, I'm going to head over to the park across the street from me and try out my new frisbee that I got at the Adidas store on Sunday.   Now, it is time to sneak out the back door at work.  Say a prayer and hum the James Bond theme, dorks, the B's about to get crafty. Later, sweetdorks.

      Have I got something for you fans of the dorks out there. Today, while cleaning out my desk at work, I found an authentic "Roy" nameplate.  I was going to throw it away, but thought I'd put it up on Dorkbay first.   So, if you would like an authentic piece of Dorks Don't Rock history, contact me.  There will be no charge for this one-of-a-kind piece. Shipping and handling fees will be waved if the buyer promises to put it on their fridge. Hurry, supplies are limited (to one piece) and time is running out for this amazing deal!

      Hey, hey, babydorks.  This has been a great weekend. Were any of you ever in junior high?  Did you ever have that Friday night were your mom dropped you and a girl off at the movies and tossed you a couple extra bucks to get some popcorn.  The movie was "Tommy Boy" or some Sandler/Farley/Segal epic.  You had your popcorn you laughed and you stole a few kisses.  After all of that you dropped the girl off (just a few precious but compromising feet away from your mom's Aerostar) and stole one last kiss. That was my weekend, you sweet and lovely dorks. Me and R. Girl had that one defining moment in a relationship.  That one moment isn't a second, that one moment isn't even a minute.  Nobody has ever defined how long a moment can last.  And, if Webster is reading, a moment can last a few days. We had pictures devolped today from our past few weeks together.  I really liked the one of us on top of the troll statue (read back for more info) and asked for doubles. This is a defining moment in a relationship, because.... "I want to put this picture in a frame ... is that O.K." "Yes it is, why wouldn't it be?" "Because it's the "Frame Stage" are we ready to go to that stage yet?" "Yes, let's go to that stage." On Friday I score some very potent and very west coast weed.  I haven't done drugs in months.  But when someone hands you a shitface fuckload of potent, grown in grandpa's back yard weed, you don't say "No thanks".   You say "Who's got brownie mix?" So, upon advice, I poured a quoted "5 months worth" of very potent grass into a batter of brownies. Let bake for 25 minutes. Become so shitfaced that .... "Where do you hide it all"  "How about in your neck, shit look at that fucker" "Did I have legs" "Are there hills?  Help me with the hills." "Did you want the chair? A chair?  Did you want to find the chair?"  "What the hell are you talking about" You wake up at 6 in the fucking afternoon the next day!  6:00 p.m.?  What the hell do you do then?  Drink beer and rent movies, that's what. So, today I was more productive.  Me and my sweet, sweet baby went and spent our weekly day downtown.  We had a great day of window shopping and gyros.   An old woman with a camera set up this situation for me. Old woman:  Do you want your picture taken? Me: Yes.  What? Old woman:  Do you want your picture taken?  Do you want the camera, you can have it. Me: Yes, I want the camera. Old woman: Five dollars. Me: No way, I thought you were giving it away because you are high. (Walk on for a moment) British guy: Are you guys not from around here? (This guy is acutally sipping from a STARBUCKS cup ... only 400 yards from where Starbucks first opened.  Very Seattle.) Me and R. Girl: Yes, we are. British guy:  Well, you aught to be careful.  That's one of the oldest Seattle scams in the book. (This guy walked near us for 5 minutes without talking.  I know he wanted us to ask him more questions about how to avoid Seattle's downfalls, but I didn't care ... he made me feel like a tourist asshole enough anyways). What scam? Oh here's a camera for 5 dollars!  Fooled you, it's only worth 4.50!   A scam!  Like I'm dumb enough to let some old crack sucking camera whore run off with my money? "Oh, it's a Sony?  Well, here's my debit card, go shopping with this.  What? My social security number?  Sure, you DO have a camera." So, it was a good day except for British asshole ruining my good natured ribbing of the local crack heads.   Oh and there is the haircut I got on Friday at misogynist barbers. Short and sweet. "You know what I do with a first date? I tie them up and beat them.  No, wait, how did that comic say it?  I tie them up and drag them by the hair and then I beat them unconcious.  No, it wasn't "unconcious" ... I think it was "senseless"." So, needless to say, I came out of that place with a MOTHER FUCKING G.I. JOE, MARINE, HAIL TO THE CHIEF, HAND ME A GUN AND WATCH ME SHOOT UP A SCHOOL haircut that is so fucking short that I feel naked without a hat. Ahhhh, at least I have a sweety.  She jokes and tells me she likes it while others go "Goddamn, did you fuck a weedwhacker?" I need a new hat, dorks.

      Good morning, dork babies.  I had a great and not very restful weekend.  There were diabetes walks and birthdays.  There was R. Girl, broken toys and great fucking sandwiches.  Today I am sleepy and need just one more fix of a weekend before I can really get this week started.   Like I've said before, I'm not saying it's because it's Monday, so back off you fucks. No Inner Dialogue Girl had a good weekend.  She saw Tim's band play at the park.  (I have no idea who Tim is, people always do this to me.  They start talking about people I don't know and I don't care about) There was nobody at the park.  It was a nice park.  She went to Vegas for her 21st birthday.  She was supposed to work.  She didn't go to work.  She went to Vegas.  Her coffee is hot.  She needs a bagel. I'll write a more all encompasing blog later.

      I have a great fucking idea, my cute dorktits.  We will take down the internet. Or at least part of it. For this to succeed you each need two things. 1.) Consciousnes  and ... 2.) At least one friend And some of the dorks start crying .... When you see a pop-up when visiting the website, remember what the advertisement was for and don't buy any of that product that day. For example, I just saw a pop-up for Orbitz, which I think is a fun hip-time drink that kids put vodka in.  Well, I'm not going to buy some on purpose today.  I wouldn't have bought any anyways, but imagine if this thing catches on and all of a sudden Orbitz has a zero profit day.  And then they ask why.  And then Chet tells them "Dorksdontrock.com told people to do something to fuck with the man that wouldn't be obnoxious or require any effort and goddammit it worked!".  And then I get to be on the Today Show.  Fuck yeah, let's do it! The B-Man motto: The easiest thing in the world to do is to not do something. It's reverse advertising and I really want this to work.  Please, please tell a friend about my idea.  We would be going against years of brainwashing from Mad Ave. and show those corporate advertising fucks (who I would like to work for one day if the pirate or forest ranger things don't pan out) who's the thinking man.  Rage against the Orbitz, dorks.  Don't not go gently into that convenience store.  Rage, rage against the lying and the hype. Dorkus Thomas, suck it. Did anyone else besides the better half of the Lovely Couple notice that my archives have disapeared?  Part of me has died and that's why I kind of have been taking a break from doing this silly typing with my fingers. B:Are you going to see James Taylor? N.I.D. Girl: Maybe, I don't have anyone to go with me.  Me is in reference to the person right in front of you.  You is in reference to the body you are living in and the soul that floats in your heart.  Angels put your soul there when you are a babity wabity scoobity doo! B: I'll go with you if you can't find anyone. So, I might be going on a little pseudo-date with the N.I.D. There will be no tongues and I declare it!  I get enough sugar from R. Girl.  And the good kind of sugar, not that brown cane shit that hippies and yuppies with no tongues put in their ass coffee. Speaking of which, my new favorite thing to do is waking up early when R. Girl spends the night and getting my showering and dressing done quickly and then jumping back into bed for about 5 minutes.  Sweet red-hair-in-my-face bliss, it is nice. Today I play frisbee golf and then pornography. Tickle me pink, dorks, and do my bidding.

      So, like I was telling you dorks yesterday. Last week was testing.  Testing in the way where you fight with swords, not in the way where you write your name in the top right-hand corner and make an A. First off, GreatTits/NoBrain and Uncomfortable Silence Boy were fired.  You see, as interest rates remain marginally high then the influx of new loans remains relatively low to last fiscal quarter, which allows for more space commander playtime but less purpose then before.  This made me fear that the Roy job would soon end so I volunteered to do extra work.  I decided to be come more valuable than gold to save my precious job.  So far it worked, but I was very tired all day last week.  While each and every one of my precious dorks were on my mind I was just a little preoccupied with visions of hobos and a disapointed Roy to do any more than cry and sleep. Not really. So, let's just skip over last week.  Last week is dead to me. I have snored my entire life.  I think I have at least.  I always hear people say things like "Did you fight a walrus in your sleep last night?". And for 23 years it has been funny.  I snore, other people don't sleep, I snore, and then Easter comes in the spring.  Well, I decided recently to buy some of that snore spray such and such and such.  It works.  I even tried the strip things and then ... anyways I sleep better now.   That was an all time low for the blog I think. Friday night: Me, R. Girl and the Lovely Couple all went to a high school football game.  It was a freaking blowout, dorks.  Some school kicked another schools ass by a large quantity of points.  I don't really know.  I was too busy checking out the hot 16-year-old in front of me and her sexy, sexy jailbait thongs.  Oh, and I'm not hip anymore.  These kids these days don't tear up their hats or bend the brims.  They wear white jackets and Skechers.  I was fratted out, and I thought damned sexy.  But, no, I was the dork who a group of 10-year-olds threw popcorn at.  That really happened. Saturday:  Me and The R. went camping out by Mt. Rainier (I accidently typed "Mr. Rainier" there, that would be whacky). B: Gee, Mr. Rainier, we just wanted to do a little camping next to you. Mr. Rainier: You kids are all right. Nature fucking rocks.  There were trees and I lost a frisbee and we drank beer and R. Girl wouldn't let me keep a big stick I found and poked at a fire with and there was a river and these rocks and the toilets didn't flush and we had pancakes for DINNER! And I really like R. Girl.  She's like the female me. B: You know what I really like? R. Girl: Clouds that look like boobs. B: Yes, but Nirvana .... R. Girl: ... couldn't have lasted creatively if Cobain hadn't sucked on a lead slug.  Yes, I know.  Now, shut up and pass the vodka. So, there was that.   Today at work was this. N.I.D. Girl: My throat hurts and I can't really talk.  I said my throat hurts and I can't really talk.  Clyde, my throat hurts and I can't really talk.  My throat, which is where I breath and magic makes the letters into sounds, is hurty like hurtsville so I can't talky walky mcsquawky fawky.  I want ice cream because my throat is soar and those words I just spoke hurt more to speak but these are hurting and then I saw a cat. Thank god for the snore spray, dorksluts, because todays hangover would have been packed with stabbings if I hadn't gotten my deep R.E.M. cycle goodness.  Two trailer park dorks go 'round the outside, round the outside, 'round the outside. Guess who's back ... back again ... dorks suck face ... tell a friend. Guess who's back .... guess who's back ... guess who's back ... guess who's back ... guess who's back ... nanana I created a monster because everybody wants to read about dorks and more, nobody cares about B ... I'm chopped liver.  Well, if you want dorks than this is what I'll give you a little Nintendo mixed with hard liqour.    I'll never leave you behind again for so long, dork baby slut fucks.

      For the time being ... DORKS DON'T ROCK IS BACK, SLUTFACES! ... that is until I get sick of doing it again and give it up for a few months. But until then, let's get reaquainted, dorks. So, I know you are all asking "Where the fuck have you been?" or "Why the fuck are you back?" or "Could a ninja beat a polar bear barehanded?".  The answers are "Seattle", "Creative recharge" and "I'm going with yes." Quick list of things that have happened to me.  -The day before Halloween (4 days before my birhtday) I was laid off from the Roy job.  I wasn't too upset.  I saw it coming.  Something like 4,000 people were laid off that day.   I read somewhere that everyone should be laid off at least once in their life.   It's supposed to build character.  You know what else builds character?  Getting stabbed.  Do you want to be stabbed?  Sometimes people who come up with advice should be advised to eat glass.   Being laid off for a few weeks sucked.  It sucked harder than a pipe whore.  I felt like a bum, I had no money, I had no reason to shave or shower and I had to put up with questions from employers like ... "Do you know how to program the 5RTX transtickledoober and create specs. in a 3P format?" "I know how to grow a beard.  Wanna hire me?" or "Hi, Brent, nice to meet you.  My name's Waste O'Yourtime. Thanks for meeting with us today.  We aren't going to hire you." So, I no longer work at the space commander job as Roy 2.  I now am working at a place pretty much across the street.  I still do things with paper and boxes and stuff.  Mainly I listen to mix C.D. I made my Junior year in college with such hits as "Rosanna" by Toto, "Werewolves of London" by the late Warren Zevon, "Baba O' Reily" (or "Teenage Wasteland" to Creed fans) by The Who, "In the Meantime" by Spacehog and ... I'm tired of listing.  Lists are for fools and wives.  Moving on, dorks! -I'm still with R. Girl.  In fact, my sweet dork faces, we have been looking at apartments together.  I am coming out of my bachelor shell ever so slowly.  Example, I went to IKEA TWICE in one weekend a few weeks ago.  I actually said these words, "OH, we need a chopping block (a cutting board in non-me language)".  Can you believe it? The same guy who just a year ago skipped graduation so he could make out with Ginger Lynn ( www.gingerlynn.com ) and the same guy who has had this conversation "Dude, don't talk to her. She's a skank." "Did you just call me a skank?" "No, I said .. I ... drank too much?" is going to IKEA bi-weekly and picking out chopping blocks!  It's actually pretty nice.  I know you are still thirsty for the tear-jerking "I love her like the dickens" sap right here, nosefucks, but you still ain't getting it.  Just know that things are great and I've discovered it's easier to have a meaningful relationship with a girl when you actually like her as a person.  Wonders! -I have cut back on my drinking and smoking.  I can go up to 4 days without a cigarette now.  I don't know if I'm quitting or I just keep losing my cigarettes and my drive to buy more.  I actually went for two days without noticing that I had lost a pack of cigarettes.  And the best part?  I wasn't drunk when I lost them. So, I've embraced a more sober and healthier lifestyle.  I actually drink Diet Pepsi and like it.  I also avoid McDonalds.  I'm semi-healthy B now.   Why the lifestyle change? Two reasons. -I no longer live with Kyle.  The KingDork forgot that his lease was up at the end of December NOT the end of March.  So, we had a mad scramble last month to find a place to live.   I'm not saying Kyle drove me to drink it's just that when one lives in a bachelor pad he must bachele (a new verb).  So where do I live now? I'm staying at the lovely couple's place until R. Girl and I move in together, which should be at the begining of April.  It's fun. They don't have cable, but they do have a shitload of DVDs and a couple of dogs to play with.  Plus they have Risk.  The better half and I have talked about starting up a game. World domination here I come! -And the other reason for my newfound health awareness.  My mom has finally admitted she has a problem with alcohol and has started going to A.A. meetings.  It was a big ugly ordeal that led up to the proverbial straw and I don't really feel like talking about it, ever.  But she's apparently better now and such and such and such and such.  Not right now, dorks, maybe later. Other random things. -It snowed a few inches here last week.  The Better Half and I went and played frisbee golf in it.  It was awesome.  Oh yeah, after over a decade of shacking up together and scoffing marriage, the L.C. finally got hitched in a Britney Spears style weekend jaunt to the place where you sign marriage papers (not that far out of the bachelor shell to know what you do to get married proper) and they did it for ... INSURANCE PURPOSES!  Now that's straight up fucking the system.   -R. Girl got me tickets to go see the Lions and the Seahawks play for my birthday.  She also got me a B.B. gun for Jesus' birthday.  We spent Christmas and Thanksgiving together.  She sprained her ankle by falling down some stairs on Thanksgiving so I got to play Super Boyfriend and take care of her.   There were other things, but you know what, let's just start fresh.  If I remember things from the few months I was amissin' as I start this blog up again I'll relate them.  Word. I tried to start another blog.  It was a cool idea and I might still do it.  It's at http://mahatmajones.diaryland.com  and the premise is that I take an actual historical event that happened on a given day and stream of concious my own version of history. I interviewed with Microsoft the other day.  I'm hungry and I writing this blog makes me feel like I'm explaining to a needy girlfriend why I didn't call her after a night of boozing.  I'm going to run downtown and pickup my paycheck now.  Maybe take in a skin flick or a bagel sandwich.   Later, dorks.  I've always loved you.

      Moving so fast, dorks, taking a minute to say hello. What to say ... I've been dipping in and out of work to run errands all day.  One of the ape-women from upstairs noticed my lack of being. "Brent, I haven't seen you all day.  Just making sure you were here." "SWITCHBLADE!" No, I just did my little "I'm here, ape-woman" jig for her, tossed her a banana and went about my own monkeyish work.   You know what?  If I had to holler something each time I was challenged or excited I think "switchblade" would be a good one. "Sir, you can't supersize porn." "SWITCHBLADE!" Of course, I'd have to get a switchblade for it to be convincing.  Hell yeah, one of those little springloaded plastic ones you played with as a kid.  You know, to have all of the humor of a stabbing and none of the blood and S.T.D. exposure. Well, I have a weekend to do after this.  Not sure what it will be.  More than likely it will be a quiet evening with R. Girl tonight and perhaps this neato thing at Safeco Field tomorrow.  They're having some kind of fan appreciation thing and for 10 bucks you get to run around the bases, throw some pitches in the bullpen, take some batting pracitce, etcetera, more ....  Mayhaps that would be fun after some Jack.  So, I've been mainly eating high protein things the past couple of days.  I kind of feel like a dork testing out this new diet that all the fatty dorks are doing these days.  Today I ate half a jar of peanuts, some pork tenderloin (good), some bean salad (beany) and an apple (because I feel sexy eating fruit).So, fuck off, you grocery snoops.   "Raised in Car-o-li-na, I'm not like that." Forget it ... it's hard to explain. Well, I got an e-mail from my Mom yesterday.  She seems to be doing better and that is a good thing.  However, conviction to stay with something for life is not a common trait in my family.  I just hope some exceptions can be made for alcoholics, modern love and unsweet iced tea. That's right, I said I feel sexy eating fruit, dorks.

      Things to say, dorks, and things to say. Let's pick up where we left off ... After my little Tuesday rant about people and signs things pretty much started looking up.  People at this place have been nicer.  I guess you scream at one old lady and threaten a manager and all of a sudden you're Johnny Playground around here. So, after work on Tuesday I went to this here grocery store where the high school kid who was bagging my groceries was named Brent. "Hey, my name is Brent too." "Awesome." "And, you know, I was a bag boy in high school too." "Hey, maybe you're me from the future!" "If I am I don't have any advice for you." "Aww, dammit." Which got me to thinking ... What the fuck would I say to the Brent of 8 or so years ago?  Probably to dump my fattie high school girlfriend and bang Emily Urbanek more.  I think I'd have advised to stay closer to my family during college too.   But, I had no time for completing such thoughts because this happened next. An old man was standing in front of a mini-van yelling at two younger black girls. "Are you stupid?  This is a one way drive!" Then he goes up to their window and keeps yelling. "Can't you read?  Do you have a problem with following rules?" The girls drove off and the old smug anal plug walked off content.  But, I hadn't had my time with him yet. "People make mistakes, sir," I said in my best Batman voice. "When there are mistakes people get run over," he said, obviously flustered that someone had invaded his white-retired-cancer-bucket  post-berating orgasm. "You didn't get run over sir," I said very Bruce Willisy.  Oh, and I was saying "Sir" all cool and calm to get under his skin Bond style. "Mumble, walk, Mumble, Rumph, Hararumph," said Asshole. "Asshole," said Batman. So, that kind of upset me.  To be honest, I had a southern flashback and wondered if the guy kept a Dixie flag tucked under his fashionable R.E.I. gear.  I then wondered if maybe the girls had been white and fat I would have laughed at the ordeal.  But then again, if the girls had been white would Asshole had yelled?  Dammit, I hate racism.   For those of you who weren't part of the Summer of B. listen to this story. In a post debauchle hangover stupor I decided that I wanted to play kickball so I went and bought one.  I was upset from the night before because this guy had called me a racist.  He really did look like Jackie Chan, I was drunk, he was trying to get me to hit him and then I said this ... "Get out of here, Jackie Chan, we aren't going to fight." "Oh, what are you racist now?  Going to use that against me?" "No, ass, you look like Jackie Chan and you want to fight.  Don't even pull that on me." So, I was upset that I was called a racist when I knew I wasn't.  The dude really was hopped up like Jackie Chan.  It would be like if I saw a white man killing a bunch of Russians I'd go "Hey, Stalin, calm down". So, I had to redeem myself.  I wrote "End Racism Now" on the kick ball.  The idea was that if I could change one persons mind than I would be redeemed for my potential wrong racial doings. My idea was this, we'd be playing kick ball and some dude with unjust racial convictions would be playing outfield.  I would kick the ball deep and it would land in his hands and he would read "END RACISM NOW" and he would think, "Yes, I must change my ways". We never played kickball, but the thing sat in my room for almost two years and I hope I helped one person. Burritos, ice cream and a movie with the female part of the Lovely Couple.  Apparently she found me inside Hollywood Video after we were split up and I was just staring at a wall.  When asked what I was doing I couldn't remember why I was in the store.  "Huh, what the hell was I in this store for again?" What's the big deal about sobriety? Kyle is now dating a friend of R. Girl's.  This should lead to some fun and wackiness.  They claim to not be dating, but he has already bailed on a trip planned for Portland this weekend so they can go to a museum and study the Amish or whatever it is that couples do. Shit, I'm at work right now and listening to a C.D. that I made in college (a collection of bands playing live on Letterman and highlight from Badly Drawn Boys first album).  It has a bunch of orgasm sounds that I need for promos for the Phi Kappa Nasty show.  I forgot they were at the end and they just started playing in my office (glorified room).  Oops. I picked up tickets for me and the R.G. for The Shins show at the end of the month.  It will be swell.   Thanks be to Eva for introducing me to them.  And, while I'm at it, thanks to God for my own pair of shins.  Much props. Last night was dinner with the beautiful to celebrate her new job offer.  Pizza and making out is a quality night.  She had to leave before me this morning and I really don't remember saying goodbye just being confused that people were moving.  She left me a love letter in my leftover pizza box.  Sweet, dorks. Well, I need to go work or shower. Later, dork dorks.

      Morning, dorksluts.  I have some busi to take to the streets.  To tide you over here is one of the only two entries I put into my other blog.  Kyle gave me an idea to just do my "stream of history" blog on this website every once in awhile, which is a good idea because, to be honest with you, sometimes I taint got much to say. Well, here it is.  I'll write more later.  ((2004-01-09 - 10:23 a.m.  Here's what happened today ...  IN 1984!   Long time beauty queen Clara Peller first appeared in Wendy's infamous "Where's The Beef?" commercials.   A transcript of that commercial is posted below.   An old woman: (pointing at a hamburger) Where's the Beef?   America: (laughs for 15 years)   The commercial prompted other companies to follow suit. However, not all slogans caught on as well.  For example Duracell's "Where's the battery acid?" campaign was quickly cut short when children, most notably child actor Punky Brewster (Sunbelt Farmface), went looking for the battery acid inside Double-A and Triple-A batteries.   Farmface was forced to leave her multi-billionaire Punky Brewster media empire in 1985 due to severe acid burns on her face and throat. She became a posterchild for the "Hey Kids Battery Acid Ain't Kool-Aid" organization, which spawned it's own catchy slogan, "Acid Bad, Chocolate Good".   Peller went on to enjoy critical success with her tell all novel "The Beef Was Never There". The book exposed the sordid history of the Wendy's corporation. Here's is an exerpt from the chapter title "Frosty, French Fry and Freedom"   It was the 4th day that I had been locked in the basement. I knew Wendy would be back soon and with her would come the sauldering iron and ball peen hammer. I had to escape, I had to get to Dave Thomas before that red-headed #$@! If the world was ever going to find out the truth about Frosties I had to make my move now.  From my time in the Marine's I was trained to kill with my bare hands, but those bare hands were handcuffed to a radiator. In a dark corner of the basement I saw a harpoon gun left over from the shark hunt Wendy and I had gone on last summer. Those few days in Florida were the good times, but they were gone. All that was left was pain, a red-headed @#$#, a harpoon gun, 4 stuffed sharks and a deadly secret ....   Peller did eventually escape that basement of horrors and her and Wendy "Harpoon Face" Thomas went on to rekindle their friendship and hit the road as a country-western duo with such hits as "The Judds are Fatties" and "The Judds Suck".  Peller died in a freak shark attack in West Texas in 2001. Witnesses say it was "the most awesome, wicked" thing they had ever seen.   At Peller's funeral, Ronald McDonald gave the eulogy.  "When Clara gets to Heaven we all know she's going to ask God where the beef was all of this time. And I think we all agree that it was probably in her big heart. Super Size Amen."  Super Size Amen, indeed.))

      "Brent, what kind of people do you think are stupid?" The kind in this story ... I'm at a new job right?  So, it goes without thinking that only the people who had this job before me and God know what to do.  Well, maybe instead of getting upset at the new guy for not doing something for you when he had no idea he was supposed to do it  because your fat childless gray haired ass was too busy daydreaming about "American Idol" and how to look good by Easter on the Atkins diet to talk to me about it you should pull that grande latte out of your grill hole and talk to him.  But, nope, when you get asked by your manager why it wasn't done you blame it on the new guy so he gets talked to about it.  And then you have the nerve to call me and act as if I'm holding up the progress of the free world because due to the inability of UPS to make things appear in people's hands you have to wait an extra day when really you'd be O.K. and could keep eating your cake for Peggy's birthday and planning your weekend trip to Ann Taylor if you had been a fucking adult!   That person is the person I hate.   But, what can you do?  Some people have to be the type to step in front of buses.   Here is an actual handmade sign I saw at work today.  I guess everyone was invited to add their own two cents.  Someone laid down a nickel of stupidity.  What does the customer expect of us? 1.)To Listen 2.)Call Back 3.)Paitience 4.)Large adjustments 5.)To agree with them 6.) To be KNOWLEGDEBLE 7.) Even larger adjustments  KNOWLEGDEBLE?  Please, God, let me use my degree at some point in my life where the employees aren't so knowlegdeble.  Oh, and by the way, this sign has nothing to do with my job.  It's just something I saw.  I have no need for paitience or "even larger adjustments" to vague things in need of adjustment. Man, it's people like that that get under my skin. "What will make us better?" "Large adjustments" "To what, Cindy?" "Even larger adjustments?"  Back to my hip life.  Kyle has quit Microsoft.  Well, he was going to have to take his 100 day break soon enough and he was offered another job so what he hell.  He wants for me and he to gee on a road tree this wee to Portlee. I haven't spent any time in Portland and think I might take him up on it. I'm now in search of a snowboard online.  Must find one soon so R. Girl and I can thrash together.  Also, started thinking about Valentine's Day ideas today.  I'm leaning towards a pony or what I told her I got her last night. "I hollowed out Mt. Rainier and it's now your house." How wicked would that be? Other things I have to do to maintain a certain level of chic. 1.) Rotate my C.D. selection for the truck. 2.) Get a new pair of crosstrainers and a sweater. I've got a headache and no hangover.  I think I need to get out of this place for lunch.  I will, dorks.

      All right, back on track.  Monday morning, chugging a liter sized Diet Pepsi and digesting a PowerBar.  Give me a moment, dorks, just trying to remember what I did this weekend. Oh yes ... Friday R. Girl and I had a very romantic dinner at the International House of Pancakes.  You see, I feel it's important to treat the girl you care about with a fancy dinner at a foreign restaurant, preferably  at one boasting the all encompasing "international" label.  I didn't know they had never-ending pancakes there and now I have a new mission in life.  The man near us ate 6 pancakes and his son was in such awe.  Being the ass dork I am I quickly boasted I could eat 8 pancakes. "You can eat EIGHT pancakes?!?!" said an astonished R. Girl. "Dad, that man can eat more pancakes than you.  I feel robbed of my innocence and my one true hero.  Goodbye, father, I care not for your hypocrisy of breakfast baked goods nay no longer," said the man's ex-son. But, I went with the patty melt instead.  Mainly because our waiter told us that someone ate 46 pancakes once and my hoped died and so did the boy. Saturday me and the R. went to check out a "Mega snowboad and ski super sale blowout" that boasted of sales that would make GAP girls cream.  Suck my dick if they were lying.  They were, so blowjobs around.  Oh well, I am excited about taking up snowboarding and the chance of messing up my evermore fucked up knees ... Speaking of which ... that is another thing that is new in my life.  Bad knees.  They fucking feel like someone poured sand in them sometimes.  I've actually thought to myself "Wait a minute, I need to rest my knees before I go any further".  Shut the fuck up, body.  I finally listen to your hacks and hangovers and make amends to change and this is your fucking thanks?  Bad knees?  Whatever, I'm back off the wagon again, ass. And back to the reality of non-interpersonal body arguments. "Shut up,leg" "Bite me, molars" Train of thought slipping ... was talking about something ... maybe it was ... Oh yeah, Saturday.  So, we skipped snow shopping and checked out some new sights (for me anyways) in Seattle.  We watched kids play in a fountain and I ate too much popcorn and got a stomach ache.  I won R. Girl a stuffed dinosaur playing skeeball and she won me an army man with the game where you put the quarters in and then more quarters fall but it was tokens not quarters.   Sunday was lazy day.   Talk about .... Emotions.  Maybe, sure.  There was some tension between R. Girl and me of late.  We talked last night and got to the root of the problem and dealt with it.  I definitely feel better about the whole situation (which I'm not revealing what it is because it is embarassing), but not about the fact that there was something between us.  We still haven't had an argument or really been mad at each other and I like that lots.  Oh well, it's growth and growth is good and speaking of growth ... Remember, the girls in the middle are always the first to fall off. Shins segue right there, hipper dorks ... Oh yeah, e-mails I've received today.  Three great ones. Eva finally wrote back.  Yippee.   Someone at the "big paper" (as my dad would call it) has written back to me about working as a sports stringer.  Must write back and follow possibility further.  Monster like write, write good sports stringer.  Sonics win game, make monster happy, freethrows many, rebounds help.   And I got one from a guy who runs an adult-industry "the onion"-based website where I could make a fatty G a month to write parody like articles about porn.  I feel weird about this, and don't see how I can really write too much parody about porn. "In a stunning development today, people got naked and had orgasms on each other." I'd feel like I was selling out my forward thinking sexual hipness for the mass puritan culture.  But then again, a G a month to write funny porn is good.  10 200-word articles a week though?  Man, I don't know.  Maybe. Oh, and K-Dogg the Killa called me on Friday.  My old high school and sometimes college drinking buddy might be moving out here in August.  Oh joy abounds and hearts leap like leopards, glory days of debauchary in Seattle! Later, dork princesses.  I might or might not be wearing women's underwear on a dare from R. Girl.

      Fucking Friday, bro. Dorks, I am full of spirits.  I'm talking 'bout the angel tickles kind, not the Jack Daniels.  This new diet is kicking ass.  I feel my compounded-frat-boy-beer/LSD gut dropping off.  Although, last night the lovely couple and I went out for hamburgers and french fries.  I'm allowed one naughty food day a week.  I cut it down to just one bad meal for the first week.  Now I'm back on the protein kick. Shit, that last sentence reminded me it was time to eat and I just dropped a peanut into my keyboard it's stuck under the 11111 key.  Fuck it, it's not really MY keayboard. Yesterday I had coffee with one of the sports guys from the Seattle P.I. (the only newspaper with a mustache and a Ferrari 308).  It was a nice coffee as such ... We discussed pro sports versus college sports, LeBron James, journalism and the rigors of being a sports stringer.  It being the middle of high school basketball season and since I have a fulltime job that doesn't let me (I just got the peanut out!) get out until 4:30 I won't be able to start working with them for about another month.  Then it looks like I'll be covering baseball games or track.  Either would be fun. After that I headed back to work and then out for burgers, which was followed by a 2 mile walk with the L.C. and their dogs.  It was fun and wet, as are most good things in life. Tonight with the R.G. I have a well-earned steak dinner, which will probably be followed by "Family Guy" episodes and a box of wine.  I'm so European.  Smirksome. Tomorrow is the big mini golf rematch between me and my lovetickles.  A few months ago I, trying to be a nice guy, let her win.  Only I wasn't anywhere smooth about it.  On the final hole instead of easily missing and making it look real I reared back and hit it as hard as I could. "Oops." I forgot I wasn't dating that kid from "Life Goes On".  I'm talking about the retarded one, not the girl who wore glasses. So, there's that tomorrow (lay money on me) and then the cruise and Shins concert on Sunday.  My, The Shins on Sunday. I wish the time would hurry up.   Speaking of which, does that new Ashton Kutcher movie look like it was made by 14-year-olds?  Not tempting at all.  It has that big fat kid in it who couldn't see the sailboat in "Mallrats" (Kevin Smith isn't original and has hepatitis).  I can't stand that guy.  Every movie he's in he plays this big tough guy when in real life he'd be too fat to hit me.  I'm more scared of the kid who played Goldberg in "The Mighty Ducks" than this clown.  Man, if I saw that guy I'd totally switchblade him and his precious Goth hair and "Der, I need a sandwich 'cause I'm a meany" attitude.  Dammit, I hate fatties and Goths.  Football.  Monster trucks.  Midwest culture.  Closed mind.   Whew, where'd I go there for a second?  Back to ultra-hip land ...  Yeah, so the guy's kind of a joke if you ask me.  Hip recovery. On that note, have a great weekend, Dork Johnsons.  Let's all of us get laid.

      Well, shit, dorks, we've been caught. The lovely and talented Eva Moore has announced on her own blog (http://themeasure.diaryland.com) the fucktastic return of Dorks Don't Rock. So, to all of you white t-shirt alternative vegetalbe people who might be reading this for the first time ... Hi and don't take my rants (and not boring Dennis "Finger me, I'm special now" Miller rants) too seriously.  For I, born of Iowonian man and woman, am but a humble consumer of cheap liqour and lover of all things Zeppelin. And for you people who have been keeping up with the return of the blog for the past couple of weeks I think it's time you got an answer to the question of where the hell I was for 3 months. Well, you see, after the layoff I went into what psychiatrists might call a multi-month bender.  You see, since it was near the holidays and near the end of the year the only people who were in the market for hiring were cocaine dealers.  I didn't become a cocaine dealer, obviously, so I had to go with what work I could.  This was mainly sitting in front of a computer looking at screens to find problems. What problems? No one could really tell me what problems I was supposed to look for.  Yes, it's true.  So, for a couple of months I sat in front of a computer screen and scanned through several thousand pages of documents for 8 hours a day.  I was fried and poor at the end of the day.  But I had to eat and so I had to work.  What I didn't HAVE to do was write in my blog.  So, I didn't. Also, the days around here became supremely short.  I lived in darkness like a beast cast from job security into the pits of temping.   But now things are definitely turning around and I am on a life-improvement kick. This is why I'm doing the diet, making amends with my alcoholic mother, focusing on maintaining the love between me and the redheaded R. sexpot, looking for a better job (although the non-brain-frying one is good for now and puts little rush on me to find a better one) and paying off debts occured by Christmas and such. Speaking of which ... So, I called this trendy clothing company today that I have an account with.  I was wanting to pay off my card and such.  So, perplexed by my balance, I asked when they received my last payment. "November 8th" "What the hell?!? November?  That's not right!" "Sir, the information I have in front of me says you haven't paid since November." "Well, dammit, the information is wrong .." "Sir, what it says is ..." "I don't give a damn what it says ..." "that fines have been ... "Stop talking." "...added and that to remove .." "Listen, I want you to stop talking right now.  I am done listening to you.  Put on your supervisor." ( I really said this, by the way, and he shut up). ('only the lonely' on muzak) "hmmly la lmmmly ... mm, mm, mm ,ummm-m-mm-mm" "Hello, Mr. Kinkade, this is another annoying peson.  You wanted late fees removed?" "No, I was concerned because that guy said I hadn't paid on my card since November." "It shows us here that you made a payment on January 8th." "Well, you need to teach that guy the difference between November and January" Well, I won't bore you with the rest of the story but they were jerks.  I like beef jerky not jerks, beefy. Yesterday I got in touch with someone from the "big paper" and set up a meeting for tomorrow.  We gonna talks about hows I'd be a good little writer for their big ol' paper.  I'll update you on that later. My The Shins tickets came. My, The Shins tickets came. My, The Shins tickets CAME? Moving on. Another paper has responded to a little 40 word start to a porno story that I sent in.  It's not the porno thing I mentioned before, it's another porno thing.  The world is full of porno things. The deal is this, I write a 40 word opening to a story and if they like it I finish up the story by recording it on a server.  Then they run the 40 word snipet and if people are titilatted they call up and listen to the end.  If I get the most people to listen I win something, probably more porn.  Well, I have a little problem.  First, read my intro.  After class I stopped at the cafeteria for a can of pop. I couldn't carry it because my arms were full of books. "Got any lube?  I know a place to put that," I heard my sorority sister Heather say. Awesome, eh?  Lesbian soda can sex!  Oh my god, I'm so wickedly pornirksome.  Except ... Who the fuck is going to listen to the story when they call up and hear a guy with a deep voice saying this ... "So, we went to my room and got wickedly naked.  I mean all the way with tits and all of it.  We were such hot chicks.  Then I got that lube that was mentioned in the ad thing and Heather was like 'Damn, I want to do nasty shit with this soda can'." I really want to win this contest and I think I have a good start.  I just need to convince some chick to pretend she's getting Sprited (dibs on this newfound euphanism).  Maybe it's time to use the old "Get the girlfriend drunk and suggest the unsuggestable" technique. Speaking of which (I am full of seques today) I spent the night with my precious yesterday.  We watched the "Real World: San Diego".  Two of them got arrested for really nothing at all.  We have a theory that people are just sick of MTv and the likes and are looking for any reason to lock up people who associate with them. That would be awesome.  So awesome that I do a chair-jig thinking about it. Well, I think that's enough for this smirksome Wednesday.  All of you S.C. Democrats, all 17 of you, vote for Dean.  He's the non-Botox-filled-non-Bush-loving candidate.  AND HE'S A LITTLE NUTS! AAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH, DORKS!

      Afternoon, dorks.  Let's get started. I'm feeling very efficient today.  This stems from the high protein diet (Today: pork loin, diet pepsi, peanuts and little sausages ... the ape women brought in the sausages as an apeasment to their God of Beuracracy and I took part, bare chest marked with the stain of a sweedish meatball handprint and chanting "Order toner, envelopes, overtime req-ui-si-tion") and a very restful 9 hours of sleep that I got last night.   Things learned last night at the Lovely Couple's Den of Lack-of-T.V. 1.) An online Rorschach test told me that I was fueled by "imagination".  Imagine that.  Get it?  Get it?  AHHH-Hahahahaha! Fuck me, my mind and center of my being is smirksome!   The very sweet and kind member of the Lovely Couple's results said that she is driven by "Peace". Now isn't she a "piece" of work.  Holy shit! Where do I come up with this stuff? 2.) My I.Q. is 138.  I don't know if that is good or if like bank balances we're supposed to keep those a secret.  I made a 1280 on the S.A.T. also.  There, I've said it all. I've broken the secret bond of man by divulging my scores to the public.  My soul is secret no more; it is baren, 138 and 1280.  Gaze upon the naked essence of man.   Back to the I.Q. thing, the internet said that it means I can have my rule over 98% of society.  I don't know if I should get too excited though.  The internet also promised me free porn. I don't think I'd want to rule 98% of society.  Maybe like 7 or 8 percent and have a little island to myself. 3.)The book "Franny and Zooey" by J.D. Salinger is not about lesbians.  I knew this, but I think I put off reading it (and thus completing the trifecta that is Salinger) because I thought it'd be like reading Cosmo or something. "Silly Franny, mascara should match your belt and not your shoes." "Oh, Zooey, you are so 1941" Welcome to dorksdontrock, folks, the home of "Sexist recreations of America's great authors".  Next week, Edgar Allan Poe. "And quoth the stripper, 'Let's do blow'." Actually, I put off reading it because one of my psychotic ex-girlfriends (one of the two that were certifiable, the others just smelt bad) read it in college and went on for two weeks about how good it was.  She also went on for two weeks about how she loved wearing clothes with cherries on them.  So, of course, the book was, by default, pre-judged as not up to par. I was wrong.  It is good.  Om.  Other tidbits. Kyle got into a car accident yesterday.  He cut off a big truck in his little Miata and got spun around.  Apparently he smacked his head on his roof and got a tail light knocked out. "Yeah, dude, I saw that coming.  You are a pretty reckless driver." "I think the cop gave me a ticket because of my blue hair." Naw, Kyle, it was probably because you were swinging a ton of steel around I-5 like it was a misappropriated yo-yo. Wait, I should probably call him and make sure that he didn't have a concussion. Well, he wasn't there.  They call when people go in comas, I'll find out eventually. R. Girl, her friend, Kyle and I all have a little cruise about the Puget Sound planned for this Sunday.  After that R. Baby and I go to see The Shins.  How ultimately hip am I? Well, I need to return to my work and my life.  It's been nice spending this time with you, dorks.  I hope all on the East Coast are warm and not buried.  By snow, not alive, that is, in reference to the buried thing.

      Sleepy, groggy, protein-packed and half awake.  And then this comes on ... "Face down in the gut-ter, won't ad-mit de-feat though his clothes are soiled and bah-lack ..." Damn me like the devil, dorks, them Dropkick Murphys (quoted song being "Barroom Hero") can pump up even the greyest Seattle blues.  Motivation to write about rain here. Before we go any further, dorkles, let me just get something off of my chest.  I don't give a fuck that Dennis Miller is a conservative now.  However, this is apparently a scoop to every news editor in the fucking country.  Everytime I open the paper or go to cnn.com or the other website I'm addicted to even though the fucker that runs it is a puppet for the ragime there is fucking goateed Dennis with his irksome smirk.  He's fucking smirksome. "9/11 changed me," is his usual quote.  "I couldn't be a liberal any more, the terrorists made me think harder about this than I had to think about whether they should have pulled a Fredo fishing trip on Coppola's daughter after 'Godfather III'." I just made that last quote up. This whole thing bothers me for two reasons. 1.) Who gives a fuck?  Mike Myers isn't funny any more, why should you stay the same. 2.) I am bothered by people who use 9/11 as a soap box for their moral staunchness.  (Typical asshole: "When I saw the planes hit the buildings I asked God how things could be as such and he said to me 'You are so special, I wish I was there to tickle your belly'.  So I ask you to tickle my belly as the Lord would do.") Now if Dennis Miller had been hit by two fucking jet liners then maybe I'd care more about his personal account of the situation. So, with that said, let's swap weekend stories like a couple little pleated honey bun-dos at the tea station, eh? Friday night was quiet as predicted.   Saturday was movies (porn and horror). Yesterday the sexy R. and I went on a little Seattle loop.  For those of you who aren't familiar with Seattle, look at a map.  We started near Kent, drove up the western shore of Lake Washington to Mercer Island and then took 90 into Bellevue and back down to Kent.  Why?  Because we hadn't done that before, nosefuck. We went to our dock and threw bread at the ducks.  However, the seagulls were more determined to get the bread and the ducks didn't seem to care whether they got any or not.  Maybe it was some twisted bird S&M, master/slave, gull/duck situation.  Maybe the seagulls were just faster. Do you know why one side of a "V" of geese is longer than the other? Because one side has more geese on it. R. Girl got me with that one.   She was virtually attacked by seagulls! Virtually (adv.) -about, just about, almost, most, all but, nearly, near, nigh, virtually, well-nigh -- ((of actions or states) slightly short of or not quite accomplished "Virtually everything on sale!" = "Not everything on sale!" "Virtually lower prices store wide" = "Not lower prices store wide" Just a little lesson for you dorks out there in the "virtually"-obsessed advertising-permeated world. Moving on. "Cabin Fever" is so wickedly awesome!  It's Dorks Don't Rock meets Evil Dead 2. Protein diet still going.  Little sign of progress so far.   I think that's about it, dorks.

      Anyways, dorkies, I had written a pretty negative blog earlier with copy/pasted e-mails and charts and graphs and testimonials describing just how rough yesterday was (too much bourbon on Tuesday night mixed with little sleep and ape women marching).  And then I came back to Hipville.   Hey, I'm all right, just lost my esteemed level of cool there for a minute.  Now I'm back and ready to rock you dorks who can't. Right now I'm listening to a mixed C.D. I made called "When You Need to Rock". (sidenote: I made a little series with these, including "When You Need to Rock ... Softer"  and "When You Need to Rock Southern" both of which are amazingly wicked c.d.s that I'm proud of.  The combination of the two genres mentioned above is my "Go 'Way ... A Honky C.D." a fine milestone in my marvelous mixed C.D. legacy).  Right now I'm hearing "You Don't Always Hmm la la" by the Stones (the C.D. is mostly Stones and Zep stuff).  This used to be my favorite Stones song when I was in Jr. High and early high school.  Then it was "Paint it Black" in late high school/very early college and became "Honky Tonk Woman" soon after that. Now?  I think it might be "Jumping Jack Flash". This morning was beautiful.  I woke up for a little morning smooching with the R. Baby (I spent the night with her last night so I could whine and get a back rub) and an unexpected shot of vodka.  Apparently lushly R. had some screw drivers the other night and apparently they were so good she forgot she had them.  I was feeling a little under the weather and asked if I could have some orange juice, which unknown to me was full of vodka.  So I got me a little 5 a.m. Stoli kick, some more kisses and it was back to sleep.  Great way to start a day ... well, and then quickly wind it down again. I get more done before 5 a.m. than  most whinos do all day. Tonight is cleaning night.  Yeeha, my life is exciting the past couple of days!   I need to get back to work, dorkles.  Just letting you know that I hadn't forgot about you and that you are all so precious.  Suck it.

      Afternoon, dorkies.  Or maybe nighty-night to you French dorks, you Forks. Today was a very boring day.  I did receive this e-mail string, I'm sure you all realize that you'll read the last message first and then the first one last. So, to understand my frustration, read from the bottom of the list up (this is the actual e-mail corespondence, with names changed).  ((From: Me To: A girl I understand.

Well, that was the dorksdontrock highlight for my day so far.  I've rented "Lost in Translation" and "American Splendor" and plan to start watching them within the next 10 minutes. "But Brent, you are still at work." Not any more, my dork beauties ... I'm outta here!

      Festive how-dos on this the holiest of days.  The day from whence the hog of ground bursts forth upon the land to beakon the call of but 3 fornights hence of winter's fowl demoness.  And, yea, that tradition, born of the noble clansmen and nazi-noos of Germania, has rendered upon us the icy grip once more.  Take heed ye of weak condition and cast on your blankets of wool! Fucking groundhogs. Very busy Monday for me here, dorkhogs.  People here must spend all weekend thinking of things for me to do on Mondays.  Naw, the probably don't.  They probably throw beurucratic orgies. "I'm sorry, to receive fellatio you must have been with the orgy at least 2 hours and have the consent of a sadist." But there was no swapping of the pinstrip-ed flesh for me!  There was ... a box of wine as predicted on Friday which led to ... my first (and 4th) cigarette in over a week and then ... a fucking massive hangover when I went with R. Girl to here place of work which ... is a place for kids who are sick and so ... I played with a paralyzed kid who is so much fun, what'd we play? ... "where'd the paralyzed kid go"? where? under the blanket.  and then ... there was a car-sick ride due to the wearing off of the wine and the settling in of the big part of the hangover, that ... made me so nauseated that I almost puked in R. Girl's carmobile which meant ... there was no mini-golf rematch (blamed on rain, Milli-style) so we ... went to bed early and tried to get healthy for ... the Puget Sound cruise we went on. This thing was awesome.  Kyle and his pseudo-squeeze went.  I was and still remain angry at Kyle for brotherly and otherly reasons.  This put a damper on the trip, but didn't ruin it completely.   We got to go through the Ballard locks and see this wicked awesome hill where multi-million dollar homes just fell off during a wicked winter a few years back. "If the groundhog sees his shadow into the Sound with your house. (da-da-dum!)" And then what did I do?  Hmmm, let's see, I returned my winter jacket b/c I was sick of it's lack of hipness and protection from the elements.  In exchange I got ... WAIT! I went and saw The Shins!  And they rocked so hard that I cried.  No, I didn't cry you tabloidorks.  I nodded my head and shook it when they said "... at the morning bus stop, shaking their heads".   We went to the all ages show so there were a lot of hip little 14-year-olds in CBGB t-shirts ("It totally stands for 'Come bang girls, buddy'").  Besides the lack of hipness in the crowd there was a great fucking show on the stage.  I heard pretty much all of "Oh, Inverted World" played live!  Next stop, Badly Drawn Boy("I totally heard this guy doesn't have hands and so he can't draw, buddy"), Radiohead and James Brown. Other things to talk about? Not really.  I'm pretty tired from my run around weekend.  I haven't had to much time ... wait ... someone from Microsoft contacted me today about a position with them.  Should I do it?  Also, been trying to get in touch with the station manager of one of the big stations in town to work as a part-time d.j. (like I did in college all of you Phi Kappa Nasty fans). Will keep you updated on that. I'm going to go eat protein and sleep.  You are all so precious to me, dorks.

      What to say, dorks?  It's muther-smirksome Friday, boyyyy! I've got my truck fueled up, all of my Valentine's shopping done, some cash in my pocket, a horrifying addiction to crystal meth and two days with no ape women.  B's about to get freaky up in his Valentishizzy!   I woke up very late this morning after a night of weird dreams that included one that I met LeBron James on the street but I didn't know it was LeBron James.  I asked him for some reason if he knew how to get Sonics tickets and he hooked me up with season tickets.  I think I woke up at some point during this dream to some questioning by R. Sleepy.  I vaguely remember trying to explain that I had just got basketball tickets. I sometimes have dreams like this where I'll wake up and be expecting some cool new thing to be there, but it isn't. "Cleydsdale with a rocket launcher attached to each leg, where are you?" So, I woke up late and got to work about half an hour late.  No one noticed, nor have they noticed that I've been running errands throughout the day. But beyond my growing psychosis (I did the stumble and mumble thing in my sleep again last night) there are great things a-brewin' ... because it's Valentine's Day weekend.  And that means I get a present! And R. Girl and I are going out tomorrow for dinner at the place we went to on our first date and then a movie.  Sunday will be the zoo (if weather permits) with the Lovely Couple.  Will let you know how all of that turns out. They just announced on the intercom at work that "The Mountain Man is in the lobby!" The Mountain Man is this guy who goes to the offices around the area selling nuts and candy every couple of Fridays.  The people around here don't get too excited to see him, but when I had the Roy job the chicks over there would go crazy! "Oh, I just love your chocolate cock.  I need it so bad." "Give me some of that sugar covered crack-heroin." "The Mountain Man is my God all other Gods are beseeched in the glory of Mountain Man and his delectable gummy worms." Naw, it's not like that, they just like candy and nuts.  Hehe, nuts. Anyways, whenever they announce that "The Mountain Man is in the lobby!"  I always get this image of some sort of deranged hillbilly who has escaped from somewhere and always finds his way back to this office.  I always picture him barefoot and in overalls with a straw hat just kind of frantically running around going "Ah, hoo-eee, it's the lobby for me!"  Then they have to announce that he's back so the gaurds will come and get him.   Of course, there are always banjos playing in the background as they chase him.   The next time you are bored in public play one of "Brent's Imagination Games".  Such as: -Next time you're at Wal-Mart or the D.M.V or wherever your happen to be picture in your head what would happen if a hillbilly ran in a hootin' and a hollerin' 'bout "Heading for the hills" or "T'ain't going back to no jail".  What the hell would you do?  That one's always good for a chuckle. -Or.  Imagine the person you are talking to (a cashier or a cashier) suddenly had a spear go into their head.  NOt a killing spear, just a suprising spear.  How funny would it be to see someone with a goddamned spear in their head?  As long as they were still healthy and just happened to have a spear in their head. Dammit, I love the "spear head to pass the time" game. -OR, you could play the ever-Brent-popular "The last few minutes of Return of the Jedi" game.  In this game you are Han Solo and have just shot up the reactor core of the Death Star.  Uh-Oh, Han!  You'd better get out of there fast!  This is best played at crowded malls when you are trying to get from Cinnabon to that smelly Yankee Candle store. Maybe I'm still sleepy.   Well, have a good weekend, dorks.  Happy Dorkentines Day to your and yours (your nuts, hehe).

      "Why didn't you 'put on socks'?" "Because my job is to 'wear tennis shoes'." Dammit, there are so many pricks around this office that I feel like I'm at a gay bar.  That was a pun on the word "prick", not a homophobic slam claiming gay men are pricks. But I'm still hip, dorks, because I'm listening to U2's "Stuck in a Moment" while the sun shines outside.  This is GreatDayOutside Pt. 2.  It is such a nice reprieve from the usual Seattle "What'd you expect? It's Seattle" rain and grey.   I saw Mt. Rainier yesterday for the first time in a couple of months.  I always forget how freaking huge this mountain is or exactly where it is on the horizon depending on where I am.  So, sometimes I'll be driving around a bend and Mt. Rainier will pop out and go, "Ah-ha, it's mountain time!" (A time zone joke!  Maybe the first of it's kind ... ever!).   Say, speaking of sequels, I just saw online that they are making Die Hard 4: Die Hardest.  Nothing really to say about it, just say they are making it.  Well, maybe they could have thought of a better sequel name.  Maybe "Die Hard: Hell's Doorway", "Die Hard: Shotgun of Pain" or "Die Hard: 18-Inch Machete Wound". My dad was in New York this week for the Westminster Dog Show (he was watching not participating).  Some dog won yesterday.   Oh, I looked up information today about an inn that R. Tickles and I want to stay at when we get our tax return money back.  I could tell you about it or you could look at the web site.  Guess which I'm going with ... http://www.oceanshores.com/lodging/JudithAnn/ I made a budget for the next few weeks today and I got my watch back yesterday that has had a dead battery for two years.  I like being productive ... just like you like being a dork. So, it looks like Kerry might be the next great Clinton hope, eh?  Do they just have interns to bang them?  I mean can I just stop saying girlfriend and say "intern" instead?  They always told us in college to get an internship, they also say college is the time to explore your sexuality.  Maybe our universities are just whoring us out to the business people of the world.  Magna Cum Laude, eh?  Sounds like an escort agency name if I ever heard of one.  Hmmm, eh?, hmmm, then eh?.  It's time to go do laundry, dorks .... or maybe an intern.  Ah, boo-yeah! Oh yeah, Ramones (that's what the R. stands for, remember?) Girl said that I jumped out of bed last night and began walking around her apartment.  I vaguely remember stumbling around in search of a glass of water trying to explain that I didn't understand or didn't know.  What didn't I know?  I don't know.   R.G. had a more lucent memory, which is that I was stumbling around without any pants on talking about how confused I was.  She just rolled over and went back to bed.  Now that's what I call love, ignoring psychosis.

      Today is such a freaking beautiful day in Seattle.  The weather is just right for me to wear my new grey lambswool sweater over my hip light/dark blue plaid shirt.  And with my wind tossed hair, OOOOOOOO-EE, I am looking good and feeling a little like Al Joad in 'The Grapes of Wrath' ... that'd be after-church-pre-desperate-flee-to-California Al Joad.  But you knew that, my Okidorks. It's such a nice day that I was only momentarily considering an uzi to solve the following problem ... (For the following scenario I am going to replace the monotonous duty that I do every day with the phrase "wear tennis shoes", another activity that I do every day) Me: (Walking down the hall) Pretty Br-ent, walking down the street ... Pretty Br-ent with Sauconys on his feet. This woman: (Running up behind me) Brent! Brent!  I really need you to "wear tennis shoes" today.  It's very important.   Me: O.K., just so you know, I "wear tennis shoes" everyday. This woman: Oh, well I need you to (no joke) triple "wear tennis shoes". Me: (Confused, very confused) There was even a note attached to the thing that I was supposed to "wear tennis shoes".  It reads ...  Brent, This needs to "wear tennis shoes" - no acceptions! Thanks, This woman  She really wrote "no acceptions", it's not another of my AC/DC kilt mistakes.  This is very frustrating because the more I try to explain to her (and show her documentation) that I "wear tennis shoes" every day the more she becomes convinced that I don't. I wonder if this has been a pattern for her entire life. "Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 14 hundred and ninety-two!" "1947, hmm?" "No, 1492." "Yep, 1947 sounds right." "1492." "That's right, in 19 hundred and forty-seven all good Columbuses went to heaven." But, like I said, it was too nice of a day to consider uzi therapy for more than 12 seconds. I went and got R. Valentine her, well, her Valentine's Day present today.  What did I get her?  It's a really cool little ... can't fool me, dorks.  I know you're all agents for the man.   "But we aren't agents for the man." "Agents for the man.  I should have known." "But this paper here says that I'm not an agent for the man." "That's right, that paper says you are an agent for the man." Actually, that would be a pretty fun outlook on life. Well, I need to run out of this office now, my blog buddies.  It's time to stash gifts, eat protein and drive to see my snickerdoodles for some pseudo-spring loving.

      Dorkensteins!  I just had my mind tripped like the clown/bourbon warp on Saturday.  I went to Google.com and typed in "dorks don't rock" (in quotation marks) to see what comes  up... why, instead of working?  Because my ego is grander than any one thing else EVER!   Anyways, the third find is this german website that lists "german language blogs" and has a link to mine.  Das es vat?  Weird?  Not so much yet.  I translated the page to English all Sherlock Holmes styley ... AND! .... Dorks Don't Rock in English to German to English translation is Dorks Don't SKIRT!  Maybe skirts DO Rock (skirt=rock).   Examples from history: 1.)Catholic school girls wear skirts.  Rumble my rocks. 2.)AC/DC rocked in a skirt (One day after writing this it has hit me that none of the members of AC/DC wore a skirt.  It was short shorts, which are very close to skirts on the efiminate scale, that I was thinking of.  But, I've thought of another example ... Rowdy Roddy Piper.  I feel like such an idiot for messing up an AC/DC reference.  Hellls bells.). 3.)Those Scotish caber tossers wear skirts.  Sorry, kilts, me brethren.  And while we are at it, can't we just say skirt instead of kilt.  Hasn't a drunk man throwing a log really far and a drunk man wailing on the axe (turnbuckle) justified the skirt?  I mean, I know that they are traditionally called kilts, but my grandpa traditionally wore "britches" but I don't get all big-cocked when someone says, "Nice pants, Brent." "What? These are brithces, queerbo, only ladies wear pants.  Maybe I need to punch you a new zip code." "What?" So, you see my point.  What was I talking about?   Well, while my A.D.D. catches up with me, this reminds me of something else.  I really value R. Girl more every day for many reasons, but one is that she remembers all those things I forget (90% of the world).  Lots of times she'll say something funny and I'll laugh and I'll ask her what she's talking about and she'll go "Remember when you said that when that thing happened".  Or I'll go, "Do you use doors or windows to leave and enter buildings?" and she'll say "Doors" and I'll go "The Doors are a band, not a portal" ... Oh yeah, the German website.  Weird, huh?  I'm pretty honored that somewhere a German kid might be reading this.  Maybe I should pass on some knowledge that I've learned from watching Schindler's List and eating Bratwurst.  Why not, it's a free country, unlike Germany.  So.... Dorks Don't Rock presents Brent's Advice to Germans Reading This ... Hi, there, I heard you're German.  You're very handsome or pretty or ugly, did you know that?  I bet you did.  I bet you hear how handsome, pretty or ugly you are all the time down at the old Bierhaus.  You know you should really be careful how much you drink, your countrymen aren't known for their steadfast tempers.  Oh, I know you are different, I know.  It's just that you might want to know that the rest of the world thinks you are probably a Nazi.  What?  I don't make the rules, I just live by them.  Now, come on.  Let's see a smile.  You do make good cars and Ramstein was fun for a few songs.  There you go, that's my Hansel or Gretel.  Now, you go show the world how not a Nazi you are with you little sausages and warm beers. Well, dorks, on that diplomatic note I do think I am going to go do something else which doesn't involve talking to Germans.   Oh, before I go, is it just me or is Howard Dean becoming that dude that couldn't stop going back to his high school after he graduated. "Come on, dudes, we'll get some beers and totally vote for me." "Um, maybe later, Howard, we have lots of homework to do." Yeah, I know, he was my boy, but now he's just another dork like you.

      Jeez-um-craw, dorkwads, I've had a busy day.  Or maybe it was a busy past couple of days, hmmm, hmmm?  And did I mention I am not feeling well? I've been on a productive spree.  I have done my taxes, switched my cell phone to a hipper flip phone, paid bills, seen sites I've meant to see, spent time with my R. babe, caught up on films I want to see, re-organized my office slowly but surely (my official name plate came today, I'm officially non-official) maintained a healthy diet, caught up on sleep, and other things which I'm sure a pointless to list because who is really reading this far. Update on my Hendrix-drinking experience the other night ... I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I remember seeing a painting of Hendrix eating a bowl of soup and I was thinking that it was something "at the Mecca", but now I can't find it anywhere.  I think I just saw the place, thought "Oh, a cafe, they have soup, Hendrix ate soup in a picture, Hendrix was there" and went in.  Curses, my demi-tourist status/faultifourous logic fooled me again!  Anyways, I forgot to mention that there were a bunch of clowns there.  Not jerks, actual clowns.  Real live fucking clowns in a bar.  Can you wrap your head around this?  Imagine clowns being anywhere.  Weird, right?  Now imagine seeing a clown's face as you sip bourbon.  This is my life. Do you want to know how good a guy I am?  Really, do you?  Listen ... When R. Girl gets off from working the night shift (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) at the place where they help sick kids I wake up early in the morning to go over to her apartment and crawl into bed with her.  This way it's like we spent the night together. Choke back the tears, dorks. Fuckin' OutKast, bro, right on. And I just want to say that it's sad when we have to give almost as many awards to dead musicians than live ones.  No, wait, I want to say something more ... fuck you for dedicating every fucking thing to Johnny Cash when none of you have the balls to stand up to the corporate machine that puts out shit like Evafuckmyessence and that puts you on a 10 minute delay because they are afraid you might show some tit for a second.  Johnny mutha punching Cash would have stuck his mutha kicking finger in the gosh darn fuck air and said "For Janet".   And Warren Zevon?  Christ punch a medic, "Werewolves of London" was good, but dude that White Stripes bass lick is too tasty to not super size with the Grammy.  Mutha huggers, I hope someone interesting dies or gets cancer next year so we can have better tributes and awards. Like I mentioned before I am not feeling well.  I think I've caught something that has been going around this office.  I feel like I need to rest but I feel to sick to get any real sleep so my brain is going "Ah, why bother".   All right, it's time for me to skee-mutha-lovin-daddle.

      Morning, dorkies.  Happy Monday to you ... I mean "Fucking Monday", you know, 'cause I'm hip.   I have a bit of work to be tending to, me dorkles, so read you this about a lad and a wee bit of "hooliganism".  Didn'a know it was a word.  http://apnews.myway.com/article/20040209/D80JQMM00.html

      Yeah, it's late, and maybe I've been drinking, dorks, what do you care. Doing a little web-based research I realized I haven't typed in this thing for a few days.   Well, let me tell you something.  The R. had to work at the place where the save kids tonight so I decided to (I'm not correcting any mistakes I make in pucntuation or grammar from here out, dorks, it's taking too long).   So, today I bought a couple of lamsbs wool sweaters at a GAP outlet.  That was spectacular.  They were only 10 dollars a pop and so a I coutgot two.  HMMM, and them I wasnt' feeling too good adn R. baby had to go to wo rk and so I went asn saw Mystic River with the lovely couple.   Robert Downey jr. is good, but I don't mean robert downey jr. I mean the other guy, sean penn.  He was reall y good in that movie.  Every time I see sehan penn on the screen I am like "dude, that's madoneas'sas fuck buddy" but no, the dude can act.  Like I'm a judge of anything. "dead man walking, more like madonnas tits a sucking ... hehehehehe, know what I mean, he dated her, dude, totally, he had to suck on those things ... hahahhahaha, dammit, dude, madonna's tits" So, I went downtonwn with Kyeele tontight and had one drink at theis bar that I rmember reading about in a Hendrix bio or seeing in a Hendrix screen print.  Either way it coust me almost 16 dollars for TWO miller genuiine drafts and a jack daniels and a yager shot.  I don't think jimi would have paye dthose prices even with inflation.   (I had to to back and correct my misspelling of Jimmiy" becasue I have to sound li ke I know my hendrix to remain hip, dorks) So, I guess I was taken becasue I liked "all along the watchtower".   I think that's about it.  I just wanted to let you know taht I'm enjoying drikingin this beer and this bourbon and possibly this beer.  I'm sleepy.  Whend is it time to say god night?  Now! Wait ... I bet you wonder how I got so drunk. Right? I drank the rest of the bourbon letft over from my touesday tirade.  This shith is good, dorks.  I'd tell you I love you all but ehnn you'd asay I was just drunk.

      I personally know nothing about how to make music.   I'm going somewhere with this, dorks, so calm down a minute.  Dammit, you are impaitient.  Now, as I was saying, I don't know how to make the music come out of them music machines. I taught myself how to play the harmonica when I was younger.  The musical fruits of my labor (hehe, beans) was that I could play a pretty good "When the Saints Come to March In Our Town ... Pilaging the Land!" and "Low Rider" by WAR.  I can still play hobo-worthy harmonica but I can't wail like Eddie Van Halen.  But that doesn't mean I don't know who to rock your balls, dorks! What does this crazy guy mean?  Look!   I left the following message on my friend Eva's (http://themeasure.diaryland.com) answering machine the other night (and, yes, she correctly guessed that I was NOT drunk when I left it): EVA! I WAS JUST DRIVING IN MY TRUCK AND I HAD THE BEST IDEA! WOULDN’T IT BE AWESOME IF IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOW YOU JUST STOPPED WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND BROKE INTO THIS PART OF BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY BY QUEEN? HERE, THIS PART! [dull blare of car stereo] WOULDN’T THAT BE AWESOME?!?! The part I'm talking about is, of course, the classic Wayne's World head thrash part.  Eva's in a band called Perfect Sleeper so she can do this. But think about how wicked sweet it would be if a band did this.  They'd be singing along all emo-alternative and then maybe at the end of a song they'd do that cool thing where they hit the strings one last time and let it fade out slow while they look at the ground with their hair in their face when all of a sudden ... Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha wha wha-wha-wha-wha SO, YOU THINK YOU CAN STOP ME AND SPIT AND MY EYYYE!  SO YOU THINK YOU CAN LOVE ME AND LEAVE ME TO DIIIIIIIE! OHHHHH BABEEE, CAN'T DO THIS TO ME BABEEE, JUST GOTTA GET OUT, JUST GOTTA GET RIGHT OUT OF HEEERE. (I just wrote those lyrics without looking them up on the web!  I rule!) So, my point is, dorkensteins, that I know how to rock, but I just don't know how to make it roll.  I want to be in a rock band just so I can have awesome ideas like that and have them happen before me like a babe born anew of Zeppelin and G. 'n' R. And I've got ideas, oh yes, ideas in my head are brewin', but I taint telling you none of them 'cause one day you will see them on MTV and your head with explode from THE EUPHORIA! I am hungover this morning, dorks.  I drank 2 40s and a few other beers and played some muthadominating RISK with the better half of the L.C., the other half being in Cali. or Haiti or something for the week. How'd I do at RISK?  I lost.  Then we played Trivial Pursuit.  How'd I do?  I lost.  Although with the Trivial Yah game I think the questions were a little easy for certain people who weren't me. Example question for the better half: "You eat off of this and it rhymes with plate." Example question for me: "14, Stevenson or that apple?"    I guessed 14.  I lost.  So, I'm hungover and very tired. I called R. There-for-me a couple times when I was wasted last night.  Always a good idea. "Hey, I'm wasted. Who wants a tickle?" "You're on a phone, you can't tickle." "What?  You're cute." He,he I just called UPS and they say "What brown can do for you." Brown do.  He, he.  Fuck I can't stop giggling about this. "Sir, we lost your package." "He, he, package. Do." Then they said "Check us out at UPS.com" "He, he, check.  Like what I write at the grocery store.  Check." Allright, I need to fucking work.  Damn, I have been writing this thing for almost an hour!  Need to go, dork tickles. Wait!! One more thing. I went to return the digital camera that I got R. Camera for Christmas.  It broke when I was trying to take a picture of her riding a statue of a monkey at the zoo. Here's what happened at Best Buy. "Sorry, we can't replace this.  The return date has passed and you didn't get the stupid, stupid extended warranty deal that we should have on all of our products anyways but we don't because we like to ass fuck you because we know you'll keep coming back even if we ass fuck you because we have lots of shiny things.   Lube up!" "But, it's a shoddy product.  It broke, it's not working, you should take it back." "I'm sorry (shoving the receipt at me) but the exchange date has passed." "You don't need to ... so, you can't do anything for me." "No." "So then I guess I got (oh, it's soo good, wait for it just a second, rewind it and turn it up because this is going to be good!) ... "So then I guess I got .... THE WORST BUY!" I actually said this and many people heard me and I walked out of there like a king.  Goodbye, dorks, I rock.

      I tell you, dorkfaces, sometimes I think this whole world is full of people with rubber-filled heads.  That's right, rubber-filled heads.   I just showed someone in the executive office how to ... a.)Convert dollars to euros b.)Build a rocket to take them back to their rubberhead planet or  c.) Use a folder.  A regular freakin' paper folder.  A folder that would not be unlike the folder that has been used for many a year by many a beurocrat.  A  regular (although it was red) paper folder.  I think it needs to be said again for effect.  A regular paper folder.  A red regular paper folder. Ok, now you're supposed to guess.  If you guessed "c" you are not a rubberhead.  If you didn't guess "c" I have a rocketship waiting for you. "This folder not be da one me usededed to be using." "Here, you open it up and then ..." "Oh, that's that there's the folder I be seeing when i use the folders.  Yep I likes the open folders." I'm glad that rubberheaded people make 3 times as much as me; it really helps me stay focused and well-balanced.  Very zen. I hope your dorky weekend was nice and that you all ate chocolate and got hit with Cupid's arrow.  Not cupid the love guy, Cupid this meth addict I know with a fondness for crossbows.  That's right, I hired a cranked out crossbow nut to hunt you down, you smirksome rubberhead. But really, I had a great weekend.  Me and the R. chicky went out to eat and held hands.  I gave her a journal type thing and a nice pen for Valentine's.  What did she get me?  Well, I got porn. I know I told some of you that R. Virgin got me other movies.  This was a lie, a boldfaced lie, I lied to you.   Why? You see, I did this because I didn't know if I wanted to tell anyone that I owned porn and that I mutually owned porn and that I received it as a gift and yadda, porn, smut, other stuff, hmmm, television, I wonder what's on. But, then I realized this little fact. November 2003 - R. Touchdown gives me football tickets for my birthday. December 2003 - R. Christ gives me a b.b. gun for Christmas. February 2004 - My R. gives me porn for Valentine's Football, guns and porn.  I think that needs to be said again.  Football, guns and porn.  How perfect is this chick, I mean babe.  Plus, who the hell doesn't own porn?  I mean, the exception is that Catholic priests don't own porn and we all know what's going on there. That's right, if you don't own pornography you have to wear very tight collars.  And lord knows I like a loose collar. On Sunday (the day of the tight collar) the me-couple and the lovely couple went to the zoo.  It was very fun.  One of the elephants had half of his (her) ear gone like it had been ripped off.  That was awesome. There was also this sign that talked about how a certain type of monkey will get into fights with eagles.  It had a painting showing what a monkey/eagle fight looks like.  What does it look like?  Like this ... I have said in my life that a lot of things are the coolest thing I have ever seen.  Santa Claus, people falling while sking and gators jumping are a few of those things.  However, all of those things are lame ass shit-fuck compared to monkey/eagle fights.   A group of these certain monkies will be sitting in a tree just hanging out. "It sure is a good day to be a monkey," they will be saying. Suddenly, an eagle will swoop in and sit next to the monkies in the tree.  He is the spotter.  "No, it's a bad day to be a monkey," the eagle will say.  Then his buddy swoops in and starts picking up monkeys. (This next part was not mentioned in the zoo display, but here's how I think it goes) The monkies, flying high above the ground held tightly by the eagle, will fight and claw.  The eagle will do sky-cartwheels and zigzags to confuse the monkey.  The monkey is too smart for this and pokes at the eagle's eyes. His attempts are futile. The eagle pokes back with his razor sharp beak, slicing the monkey's left ear.  This angers the monkey who swings violently at the eagles face.  The blow to the head shockes the eagle who momentarily loses control of his flight.  Both the eagle and the monkey are falling to the ground at TERMINAL VELOCITY!  Just before impact the eagle regains control and swoops up.  The camera zooms in on the eagles claw (that's right it's a movie now) only to reveal it covered in blood.  The monkey could not escape TERMINAL VELOCITY!  Before I die I want to witness God's most perfect conflict ... the monkey/eagle fight. There were also bears and zebras and asian people.  But you've seen all of that stuff. Well, I need to go home because I don't want to be at work any more.  You dorks are all right, ya crazy rubberheads.

      "So, do you want me to have this in Portland by Saturday or Monday"  (For this one, dorks, remember it's Friday) "Um, which ever one will get it there faster." Pause. This is the lady that I had to explain a folder to.  Where the fuck did this rubberhead come from? "That'd be Saturday." "Yeah, let's go for Saturday." That's a way to wrap up and summarize this past week.  Rubberiffic, and fucking smirksome.  Long.  Talking 'bout my week, not my ... That's it!  I'm out of here.  Time for an oil change and red-headed loving.  Talking 'bout my girlfriend. Weekend, dorks.

      Yeah, I know, dorks.  I'm sorry that my blogging this past week has been very none-done.  I did try to write one yesterday when I accidently closed the wrong window (the bloggin' one) and lost it.   "Aw, fuck it," I thought.  And fuck it I did. So, like I was telling you yesterday but you didn't know, this has been media week for me. I bought three new, used C.D.'s last Friday. Green Day "Dookie" (Awesome reminder that those fuckers who walk around going "This isn't punk.  Punk is punk I'm punk, this ripped sweater is punk" aren't punk.  And really no one is punk, dorks, it was a stupid, stupid way to sell some records in the mid-to-late seventies since disco and stadium rock had saturated the public ear.  The Sex Pistols WERE (don't ever be fooled into thinking they weren't ... it's not very punk to think otherwise) the SECOND boy band.  The first being the Monkees.   Punk music is still good, however, punks are dorks with spikes.) RZA presents "Wu-Tang Killa Bees" (Good truck drivin' music) and  The Soundtrack for "Dogtown and Z-Boys" (or something like that.  I'm not going to pretend I know the title correctly and falsely have you assume I'm down with skating culture). All good C.D.'s. Also bought "Death Race 2000" and "Rollerball" (the Jimmy Caan one) and rented "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" All excellent movies.  Best lines in each movie respectively ....  Cleopatra: It isn't my fault everyone scored before us. You should have gone after that boy scout camp like I told you!  Nero the Hero: I tried the goddamn boy scout camp. You know how fast those boy scouts move?  Cleopatra: Now here's something more your speed.  Nero the Hero: That'll be at least 200 points!  Cleopatra: If they scatter, go for the baby and the mother  Then ...  "It was never meant to be a game!"  Then...  "Fooeee, where'd I put my sword.  Oh-No!  A ninja!"  I really want to use that Rollerball line at some point in life. "Hmmm, this fish is a bit gamey." "It was never meant to be a game!"  And to top off Media Week I've been reading (I think I mentioned this ... oh yeah, I did) "The Dice Man" by Luke Rhinehart. Very excellent book, please read it.   For Christ's sake, calm down.  I'll give you a summary b/c I know some of you dorks can't read. This guy invents a way of living where dice decide what he does with his life.  There are some rules, the major one being that he has to do what the die say.  Here's how you do it. Think of six things to do and let it represent one of the numbers on a die.  Or maybe think of 4 things to do and allow a couple numbers to represent one thing to do ... Example 1.) Find a hot homeless person and give them $5 2.) Get drunk  3.) Clean your home 4.) Call someone you haven't talked to in a while 5.) Hit on the next stranger you see 6.) Climb a large hill   ... you'll understand as you go.  They can't be things that you woulnd't do.  You have to do them without thought or ego once the die is cast.   So, I've tried it a few times.  In the book the di command the guy to scream that he's Batman and bang lots of broads, the di commanded me today to go eat an unhealthy lunch in the park.  Of course, I don't want to bang a lot of chicks because .... R. Sense-of-humor and I are getting antsy about our big move.  I think we're both over the nervouse "What the hell did I just agree to?" stage and at the "Fucks sake, let's do this already" stage.  I remember when it was just "frame stage".    Boy, who doesn't want to see the new Jesus movie?  Me.  Is it just me or does watching Jesus get beat up for a couple hours sound morbidly interesting and therefore totally out of the realm of being able to go see because of the fires of Hell (that I don't believe in) that would await me if for just one second I had the thought "Man, this Christ guy really just can't take a punch". And what the hell is up with the F.C.C. since LaToya whipped out her tit?  I mean Mel-Gibson-sucker-you-all, you pull out a boob for a second (a black boob remember!) and all of a sudden no one can say "pee-pee".  But show two hours of Jesus getting whipped and everyone goes "Hey, let's rent out a movie theater so my kid can watch this." And while I'm going on about current events, I need to say something about Rosie O'Donell.  This dork-with-tits is the only celebrity that the gay marriage movement could get to join their cause?  Well, maybe it's not a movement as much as a natural and A-O.K.-with-people-who-are-secure-and-don't-hate-their-fathers-and-jerk-it-to-Freddy-Prinze-Jr. progression in civil rights, but anyways ... getting Rosie O'Donell to stand up for your cause is like having the one armed kid from my high school throw out the first pitch at the World Series ... THEY'RE GOING TO FUCK UP SOMETHING IMPORTANT!   We all know Rosie is going to go to San Fran and be all snoddy to people like when she (DAMMIT!) would always give the person the correct answer on Hollywood Squares!  I mean for fucks sake Rosie, it's a game stop acting like you do anything besides eat and throw koosh balls all day.  She's going to piss off different leaders who will rush to shut down what would have been quiet civil disobedience. "I'll take gay marriage for the win." Anyways, I think that's enough dorks rocking for the past few days I've missed.  I'll talk to you all tomorrow and tuck you in for the weekend.   And the dork sayeth on to ye, go forth and do unto dorks as you'd have dorks do onto you.

      O.K., Ameridorks, nows the time to saddle up and kick some old white guy ass.  We've lost Dean.  That's all right, the Democratic Army can still win the fight .... IF, stupid Ralph Nader drops out of this race.   Ralph Nader is the biggest dork in the world.  Even worse, he will never be president because he doesn't have much more than economic ground to stand on.  And even worse he gave us that momma's-daddy's boy of a president we got now.  I'm a seventies-era porn man myself, but I hate me some Bush. So I've been sending e-mails to info@votenader.org (it's the only e-mail address I could find on www.votenader.org).  I've probably sent out almost 100 in just 45 minutes of work.  Why not actual work, Brent?  Because I'm working for America now, dammit!   You should all send similar emails to this address!  I've just been writing things like "No Nader = No Bush" and "Rember 2000?" or "Two parties bad?  Three parties worse!" in the subject line and then pasting a simple message as such ... Please do not run for the office of President of the United States!  You know in your heart that this will only split the Democratic party and fuel a Republican victory.  Please support the Democratic candidate! Thank you, Brent Kinkade ... to the body of the e-mail. Tell your friends to do it too.  If this fucker runs than it's 4 more years of Bush.  That's four more years of your dad's friends running the country.  America won't be hip anymore kids.  The old white terrorists will have won.  So, how was your weekend?  Mine was superfanfuckular.  It was such a beautiful Seattle weekend that on Saturday R. Bedbuddy and I laid in bed all day and looked out the window.  We had grown sick of doing things on the weekends so we decided to do nothing.  And nothing we did. R. Girl had to go to work at 4:fucking:30 on Sunday morning ... and with no sleep thanks to a drunk me.   "You asleep?  Christina Agulkaearea sucks on Saturday Night Live ... wait, it's not live here.  Did you realize that?  Hey, are you awake?" But I didn't have to work, so I slept until 10 in the morn and then went and played a little disc golf with the L.C.  I have to say that I played pretty well for not playing in a few months.  Now that frisbee fever is back in my veins.  I need to get a couple more discs to round out my set and I'll be in good shape.  Also need to work on my drive.  Can't seem to get enough power behind the disc.  And, no, I'm not a girl. After that the L.C. had another L.C. over for dinner, except the L stands for "loud" this time.  We had dinner and lovely conversation about lesbians, marijuana, sirens, dogs, dogs and sirens, and ladders.  I now know where to go for random gay sex in Seattle.  Heavens, what I needed to know is where to get a good slice of meringue instead I got the whole pie! Today I've been reading 'The Dice Man' by Luke Rhinehart. It's pretty good pre-Fight Club male angst stuff so far.   It's now time for ... The B-Man's "After 47 pages" book review! The book opened strong with much talk about disillusionment and disassociation with society.  Then there was some talk about this guys wife's ass which was cool, but was quickly replaced by talk about an egg breakfast with this guy's kids.  Then there was talk about murder and Christ and the Buddha.  I think someone took tranqulizers.  A must read! Thank you. Anways, dorks I need to get back to my real job.  But you need to do my bidding and send out those "No Ralph" e-mails.  If you don't, a New York City fireman will cry himself to sleep.  And you don't want that do you?  A good American would do anything for a brave New York City fireman.  Are you a good American, dork?

      Dorks Say Sorry. I was wrong when I said in a previous blog that Rosie O'Donnell was going to piss people off with her marriage.  Kudos and kooshes to Mrsissz. O'Donnell and her new husbawife. I wasn't wrong about the monkey/eagle fight.

      Martha Stewart is guilty, Howard Stern is gagged, a 24 hour a day search for Bin Laden is underway (the CIA wasn't leading up this "convenience hunt" from the begining?  "Ah, come on, we looked for him yesterday.  Plus, Dr. Phil is on."), Bush uses images of 9/11 to get your vote ("It happened under me" being the appropriate slogan), job market predictions have been cut back, my dad just told me he isn't going to be helping with my student loans, British troops plan to be in Iraq for at least two more years and many Iraqi "leaders" (yeah, and Bugs Bunny was a fucking rabbit, these guys are more puppet than Muppet), for some reason Ben Stiller makes more movies than the Beastie Boys put out albums, my goddamned shoes hurt, Bishops are gay, gays can't marry here, gays aren't supposed to be here, a tit has shook up the world, the F.C.C. is headed up by a Powell and so is our war, probes, leaks, Haiti, Nader = 4 more years, stamps for e-mail?, Atkins was obese when he died, Giuliani defends everyone, Kobe rapes ... he scores, little boys being touched, gays, bombs, is Hitler back?, high gas prices, lower wages, air, clouds, bird flu, mercury, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen ... and then you see this. http://www.local6.com/slideshow/news/2900374/detail.html?qs=;s=3;p=news;dm=ss;w=320 Have a good weekend, dorks.  If the world is ending, you've seen it all.

      I write no blog this week.  You know.  I know.  Hulk smash. I could not wake up today ... but boy-oh-boy I could wake up yesterday.  Because .... R. Girl: mmmmm (you know the morning groan of dream-bliss and awake-realization) Happy Birthday ... Me Boy: Thank you, but it's not my birthday. Even if it wasn't my birthday yesterday it sure was  great way to wake up.  I wish stuff like this would happen more often. Typical jerk sales clerk: Thanks for buying socks, Happy Anniversary. This reminds me that I used to have (when I had my own bathroom during college) a piece of paper torn out from a magazine that just said "Christmas" over my mirror.  I think the same principle is at work here. So, guess what I do this weekend, dorks.  Hulk guess. I'm putting my security deposit down on an apartment that R. Cupcakes and I finally decided on.  It's damned near official, dorks.   Hulk nervous.  Hulk never live with girl before.  Well, Hulk live with girl roommates.  Hulk know isn't same thing.  When girl roommates have girl boo-boos Hulk say "Drink, hush" and girl roommates go to boyfriend.   Hulk sure Hulk be fine.  Hulk like redhead girl. You know I feel like I need to go off on all of the insanity going on under the Bush regime ... -Howard Stern being pulled off the air ("But that was Clear Channel that pulled him with no pressure from the government."  Shut up and suck Dr. Phil's cock, Oblivious Boy, he's near climax ... And isn't that a good point.) - The march of the anti-gay bootstraps. - The anti-science "But ma baby's imbilical cord should be placed in a holy trash receptacle 'stead of being used to help the cripple boy walk" and "T'aint never been no water on Mars" ... Oh, the Mars thing!  Why are people scared of water on Mars?  Why?  I know!  I know!  Dammit, dorks, I know!  If there was water on Mars then maybe there could have been LIFE on Mars!  And if there was life on Mars than what does that say for the creationists, the Baptists ... your God, What does that say for the entire South?  If God didn't just make life on Earth than maybe he didn't make just Adam and Eve, maybe he did make Adam and Steve (Arrrrrrrgggghhhh, the anger from this phrase makes me want to run my truck over a panda), maybe Moses didn't part the Red Sea, maybe Jesus could fly (awesome), maybe Cain and Abel were cyborgs sent back to decide the future of mankind (Cain: Step away from Eve.  Abel: Never Cain 5000!  You may have the shotgun but I've got the dynamite!) ... Maybe an Army of gay men and women and people who don't want to see the new Mel Gibson movie and people who don't feel they need a gun to gain an erection or that we shouldn't hit Hindus and that a pious bastard is worse than one who commits adultery, maybe this army will rise up from under the grip of "God's Army" and say unto those who are left open mouthed and jaws in their limp pants licking and eyes bulged out BECAUSE they have witnessed that man can be strong and glorious without a God and they will see this new race of men powered by the knowledge of Mars life and ask onto they "But what can I believe in now that my superstitous beliefs have gone" and the new man will say "Lo, but believe in thy self"  and old man will say "But I suck and I'm scared" and new man will smile and say "You've got some Dr. Phil juice on your lip." -Um, where to go from there? The Oscars were pretty good ... Oh yeah!  Why does every critic keep saying "The Bored of the Rings" "I'm so bored by it, Oh it was so boring, Bored"  ... Harry Potter rim an atheist,  what's wrong with these people?  "Oh, I have to pay attention for more than a minute and there's no Hillary Duff?  Boring."  and ... "Lost in Translation was boring, so boring, nothing happened, it was boring."  No it was different not boring and don't worry too much some new 'Lion King' sequel will be out soon enough for you.  "He, he, that ol' warthog pooted". Now put your lips back on Dr. Phil he's randy again. - And Haiti!  I'm not going to act like I'm I know anything more than Haiti except that I do not want to go there ever, but I'm not an idiot. Stupid president in the news: "Maybe Aristide should step down." (Cut to the next day: Aristide "leaves" for Africa.) Aristide: "I was forced to leave at gunpoint by the Bush machine." Bush machine: "Naw, come on, America, the silly black man is lying to you.  We just happened to send 50 Marines to the country a few days before he left.  50 Marines seems like quite a small number to make any difference in a chaotic country doesn't it? But, it seems like more than enough to get one guy out doesn't it? Don't worry though because ...." - Something like 180 people died in Iraq yesterday because of sucide bombers.  You don't know 180 people.  Can you wrap your head around that?  Everyone you know could have died in Iraq yesterday.  And now they're saying the guy that's heading up all of these suicide bombings and gureilla tactics in Iraq was within our reach when we first entered the country.  But, no, we had to focus on getting Sadam.  That's right, because that hole he was governing had to be liberated.  180 people died yesterday so Bush could make Daddy happy.  180 people.  Everyone you know.  Prior knowledge once again ignored.   JOKE TIME! How can you spot an elephant on the moon? He's the one with the big "E" on his space suit. And.... (here's a joke I made up while I was making a no-bake cheescake the other day) Me: Hey, what do you call a chicken who hits its young? R. Stumped: What? Me: An egg beater. And on another positive note ... naw, we'll save that one for later.  But until then, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DORKS!

      Ok, dorkwads, I'm a little hungover this morning and I had to pay bills, which might make my statements here a bit biased ... wait, maybe not biased, but skewed ... ah, Christ, dorks, just listen ... Two conversations I had today that made me start to think that something is starting to happen in the world that I should be aware of. (Calling up Best Buy to pay off my card and avoid interest rates, which I can't do online because ...) "So, I can't pay it off online because the service makes me post-date the check and I want to pay it now and I can't pay it over the phone because it would cost me 15 extra dollars, which would make my efforts moot.  I don't know why you make me post date the check, every other company allows you to make the payment that day and have it applied instantly." "Sir, you can not compare our website to another company's web site ..." "Wait a minute, yes I can.  As a consumer (and a Goddamned bomb dropping American!) I have the right to compare.  Your website is inferior to others." What the fuck?  I can't compare.  Oh, please be quiet Mr. Consumer and take your ass raping.  Shh, just be quiet.  Don't point out how we make it hard for you to pay things off so it makes us easier to get richer and dammit dammit dammit.  Don't fucking tell me I can't compare.  I dare to compare!  I'm the compare king.  Your website sucks.  Burger King is better than McDonalds but not Arbys unless I really want a burger.  Apples are better than bannanas.  Leno is a douche, Letterman rules.  Argentina is nicer than Mongolia.  Fuck I'll compare all day, ass.  I'll compare shit you aren't even supposed to compare!  Why? Because I can. A skyscraper is tastier than the moon. Trees are taller than air.  My shirt is more alive than my Burt's Beeswax Lip Balm. Don't talk bad about the corporation, sir. Fuck the corporation! The corporation is more orange than my left nut.   Deep breath. Next, I'm at McDonalds this morning ( I know I said Burger King, but McDonalds was closer.  Closer things are less stuff than stuff not closer.) and I see this sign. "Lunch Policy! ... 16 cents extra for a dipping sauce for nuggets." First off, this isn't a policy.  Everyone is so excited for everything to be a policy.  Since 9/11 everyone wants to be Giuliani so fucking bad. "I hereby decree that the department of nugget security henceforth charge 16/100 of one American dollar for BBQ sauce." It's a rate, it's not a policy.  Policies you can debate, there was no debating this RATE. "Wait, you have to pay 16 cents now for your sauce? It's not free any more?" "Si. No." (He spoke Spanish) "What? Are you guys going bankrupt?" Dammit, I don't even eat McDonalds any more (except for my rarer by the minute weekday hangover) and I care about this.  I think I might go make signs and protest this weekend. 6 piece = 1 sauce! Say no to sauce fee! Sauce good!  "Policy" bad! I've found my cause, dorks.  Have a good weekend.  Love you, mom.

      Dorks, oh dorks, sweet dorks ... you know that part in the 80s movie where the parents come home and the record player goes WHEEEREEEREEE because the precious Izod parents have come home to find that their precious sweet son has thrown an all night party full of strippers and Kelly Le Brock and booze and mutha punching sheep ... CHRIST, DORKS, I SAID SHEEP!  THAT MEANS FUCKED UP SHIT IS COMING UP!  SHEEP MEANS THIS!  Your Mother  Nice to read that you are hemorraghing and doing so well in your social life. Pick up the phone you little skamp!!   This is one of the comments to Kyle's little entry about putting his head through a fucking, sorry Mom, stupid window! This means that my mom (by linking to read the Kyle story) has read this site!  Fuck Christ Shit punch the Pope and inhale whippets while a lap dance girl does things and fuck and shit and dammit.  I mean shoot, ma.  Shoot it all to heck! No one else is going to use the word "skamp"!  Skamp means my mom!  My mom has read about all of this!  Ahhhhh, no way she could just read this little bit and then stop.  I'm as adictive as nicotine, which I don't inhale on a daily basis, Mom. "Brent, what's a skamp?" "Shit, I don't know, I only knows 'bout talking bout beers and boobs, I think my ma knows what skamps might sure be." And so we begin "Brent Explains Everything to His Mother" Hey, Ma ... remember how I call you Ma?  That's funny isn't it?  I know you read some things on this here website that aren't too pretty.  Um, so, I'm still a virgin ... it's just that the other kids laugh at sex jokes.  Yep, and jokes about, um, your girlfriend buying you porn.  That's the funniest joke out there now for kids to tell ... 'Knock-knock' 'Who's there?' 'Your girlfriend.' 'Your girlfriend who?' 'I bought you porn and totally respect your mother.' Hahahahahahahahhahaha. That IS the funniest joke out right now, Mom.  It feels like I'm cleaning up my room, dorks.  Except it's not my teenage "Hide the Marlboros" room. Nope, I'm chasing frantically around my "Hide the, um, the yep let's stick with Marlboros and not dildos" DAMMIT room. And now all of you dorks are saying, "Well, hey Brent, why don't you ever mention your parents except in passing?" Why don't I? I've noticed that too, dork fellows.  So, now that I've admitted to having a mother and not being the coolest hippest most idependent space commander on the sun I should probably open up about other things ... My parents are divorced.  My Dad lives in Michigan and is remarried.  My mom lives in Phoenix.  She recently admitted that she is an alcoholic and left her chump fiance that kept telling me that he loves me.  This was very uncomfortalbe for me. "I love you, Brent." "I don't know what you look like."  At least my stepmother is honest.  She once said to me, "I don't care if you freeze to death."  This made me think, "Hmm, maybe I'm totally misinterpreting this freezing to death thing. Maybe that's how Iowa sluts say 'Hello'." (Guy frozen in Iowa) Iowa girl: Hello to you too. I don't talk to either of my parents very often.  By not very often I mean think of the last time you talked to your parents and divide by 3.  That's how much I have talked to my parents this year. People:  So, what do your parents do? Me: Um, I don't know ... live? And that's all you get for tonight about, dorks.  I hope you all freeze to death.

      "So, um, I have an entry for you ..." "What?" "You know, for your little blog thing ... I've got something to write about." "OK, Kyle, what?" "I'm in the hospital right now.  I cut my head open and I lost a lot blood and had to ride in the ambulance." "What!?!? Are you O.K.?" "Oh yeah, they're cleaning up my head wounds right now.  Look, I don't feel so good, I'm going to go." This was the call I got last night on my way to R. Cookie's.   "He seemed O.K.," I thought.  "No need to go to the hospital." Then I thought, "Wait, I wonder how fucked up his head is!"  I couldn't miss this!  Kyle's head might be wide the fuck open! I might never have a chance to see his skull again! So, being the good brother and avid fan of head wounds that I am, I went to the hospital.  And why did Kyle have a head wound and massive blood loss last night?  This might top the duck story, dorks, it just might. "Boy, I sure worked hard today, I think I'll go eat a pizza and play video games at home.  All I need to do is walk through this door and get in my car.  Yep, just walk through this door and I'm home free.  I've done this millions of times.  There won't be any problems here ..." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!  WELCOME TO TONIGHTS MAIN EVENT!  IN THIS CORNER WEIGHING IN AT MORE THAN A MIDGET AND STANDING TALLER THAN, AH, WELL, A MIDGET WE HAVE THE TYPING, THE SCREEN STARING, THE BLUE HAIRED ... THUNDER DORK!  AND IN THE DOOR CORNER STANDING 6 AND HALF FEET TALL WITH A WINDOW MADE OF SOLID GLASS WE HAVE A DOOR ... WITH A WINDOW!  LET'S GET READY FOR .... HEAD V.S. WINDOW! FIGHT! Kinkade advances toward the door ... he's coming out of his corner fast ... the door just standing there, possibly trying to psyche out the Thunder Dork ... it's not working, Kinkade is still advancing ... he's now trying to push the door, who seems to just be giving in to his brutal attack .. WAIT! the door is swinging back ... OH! the window has laid a vicious left hook to the Thunder Dork's right side ... He's down!  Kinkade is down!  There's blood everywhere!  This fight is over, folks!  The window has won!  The window has won! So, yes, Kyle tried to open a door and instead put his head through a window.  Subtle. Personally I would have just gone through the door, but sometimes I guess it's healthy to try new things. So, he had a nice sized cut on his forhead, his right elbow was torn up pretty gory and he had a nice slice on his left arm.  And what did his charts say?  They literaly said ... "Kyle Kinkade ... Window V.S. Head".   What did I get to see last night being the only person who got to go back into the E.R. and be with him? -Kyle's elbows look like baked chicken on the inside. -When Kyle has to have his head cauterized because he has cut an artery in it and is losing a lot of blood fast ... well, Kyle doesn't smell too good when his flesh is burning.  At first I thought, "Hmmm, someone is having bad Taco Bell."  and then I thought, "Wait, that's Kyle cooking.  Someone needs to dump some salsa on him to cover up that smell." (Oh, dorks, it was so awesome!  The cool guy's in the E.R. let us keep the portable cauterizing iron!  I was going to take it home with it all covered in Kyle's blood and keep it forever, but I figured that he deserved it more.) -Kyle's heart rate jumps for cupcakes.   "Hey, dude, you look pretty fucked up.  You O.K." Kyle: (Heart rate = 91) "Yeah, I'm not too bad." "I brought you some cupcakes." Kyle: (Heart rate = 121) "Really?  Awesome." beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep So, anyways, Kyle was O.K. and pretty much laughing the whole time.  The worst was when he had to get stiches.  "Oh, Heavens, please not stiches." Meanwhile: Some old lady in the room keeps saying "Just let me live one more night."  Some pregnant lady next to us is talking to her doctor about getting brain surgery.  I'm pretty sure a heroin addict died right next to us while some heroin addict down the hall is giving a lesson on the German/Phillipenes war, which I don't remember.  But Kyle can't see this (he stayed strapped to the strecher for 5 hours).  So, to him, his 20 or so stiches were the worst in the world.  Cupcake worthy, I'd say. So, Kyle is fine.  He went home around 10 and was laughing about it.   "Dude, look how covered in blood I am!" You can read Kyle's take on it ( www.omglolh4x.com ... probably later today and possibly codeine induced) AND see the funny cartoon I drew about Kyle and his battery!  I'm very proud of the cartoon ... and more personally I was scared last night, dorkos.  Very scary drive to the hospital not knowing if Kyle was O.K. for me.  I was glad he was O.K. and it was soulful to play the big brother role in another way than the jerk.  Other things since last blog: -Bought new shoes and a new jacket with my tax refund.  Adidas and North Face respectively.  Also, paid off some debts and, um ... shit, fuck, dorks.  What the hell did I do with all of my money?   -R. Di and I were approved to live at our apartment.  It's so nice to be approved.  We've been planning our decorating patterns and color schemes.  We are very TLC.  I am very anxious to get this apartment thing rolling, dorks.   -I finally finished "Franny and Zooey", goddamn those lesbians whine a lot.  Seriously, it's 200 pages of ... "Oh, but to be back yon in the day of childhood.  We could cast the off what we had wronged and were justly wronged by. The Jesus Prayer." "No, Zooey, to cast off is wrong.  We, being child of superior intellect, know only how to cast on.  We must learn to cast sideways.  A sort of side toss of the soul." "Mayhaps a knuckle ball, Franny.  A knuckle ball would cast back ..." Jesus, I got a headache from reading that book.  No wonder people kill people after reading "The Catcher in the Rye." "Wow! Today is a beautiful day.  I think I'll head to the beach.  You know what?  I should really take a book with me. I really like that last book that I read.  That Holden guy was so honest and not a little bitch.  I wonder what else that Salinger guy has written.  Wow, I'm already at the bookstore.  I sure walk fast and talk out loud.  Hmm, "Franny and Zooey", eh?  I think that I, Mark David Chapman, will read that one." Two days later. "Fucking whiny little brats.  I mean seriously just eat the fucking soup and stop nagging.  Christ, I'm so let down I could shoot a Beatle!" And this has been "Brent Distorts the Deaths of Beloved Cultural Figures".  Join us next time when Brent takes on J.F.K. Jr. "Hey, ladies, I can't remember if I got the plane that can fly under water or not.  My dad was a president, let's find out!" I also read "Fahrenheit 451".  It ends with a nuclear war.  Biased, I like this one a lot more.  I have another book to read, "How Soon is Never" by Marc Spitz.  It's about a guy who tries to get The Smiths back together.  It sounded interesting in the library, but now I think I'd rather just listen to a Smiths album. Well, dorks, it's been nice talking to you again.  I am tired and getting over a little sniffle thing today.  I hope all is well and that you have a limited number of bleeding family members.  Later, dorkpals.

      One more thing, dorks. A question I used to ask myself when I was a teenager and that I put before my friend Jared Stover one day.  Maybe it wasn't Stover, dammit, dorks, who cares who it was!  This question was asked ... "Do you think that they'll ever run out of songs?  I mean, it's possible that there are only so many combinations of notes and chords and stuff. " "No." Maybe we have run into this block, maybe the combinations have all been found!  Maybe we just take old stuff and play it faster.  It's new!  It's new! -Dawn of the Dead -King Kong -Psycho -Puff Daddy -Starsky and Hutch -Walking Tall Remake, remake, remix and remake!  Now there's a movie idea, dorks!  A truly original one!  The world has rehashed everything so much that a man sells a copy of "The Little Train That Could" as an original work!  And everyone loves it! Monkeys typing . A movie about monkeys that take over our planet!  Original!

      So, close, dorks.  It's very close.  Can you feel it on the horizon?  I know you can't literally "feel the horizon", dorks, I know.  But, it's there, begging to be felt up.  Change is a slut, dorks, she wants you to take full advantage of her. When change blows through town she doesn't advertise $5 handjobs of herself, she begs you take full advantage of her services.   "It's prom night and I'm drunk on champagne.  Bomb city hall, tear down a historic tree, curse, fuck and show your tits.  Don't shoot Arabs, Islamics, Afghanis or non-rabid dogs. Love tits.  Tits made you healthy.  Black tits started your species, don't be ashamed of them.  Change, take me, knock it all down.  You want to, I want you.  You're drunk on champagne too."  Fuck. Boobs. Tits. Shit. Vote for Kerry. Fuck.   It's been a good week, dorks, it's time for a good weekend.  Sure, my girlfriend is sick and has cottage cheese in her throat and I can't kiss her for a week and that I have to drink beer alone.  Sure, my job is no closer to permanent and I still live out of a backpack between R. Girl's and the L.C. Sure, I have had major headaches all week from a snot fortification in my head. But, the slut is blowing into town, dorks.  Things are close to happening.  The precipice of the old, new shoes on, trail runners, perfect for whatever happens next.  Unknown next. New apartment, higher wages, new president, lower gas prices, electric cars and boobs galore! Good, bad, a meteor, a bomb, a Democrat or sunshine in Seattle. I'll take it all.  SCIENCE NEWS! The rubberhead planet has been found!  It's beyond Pluto!  Can you believe it?  I ask where these rubberheads come from and then from behind Pluto out jumps a fucking new planet?  Punch the world awake and the universe spits out a new planet!   "It's a planetoid," says the scientist. "Aw, fuck, scientist, don't rob me of this.  Just call it a planet.  It'll answer so many questions!" "But then we have to rewrite the books," say the beurocrats. "Jobs, jobs, jobs!" "But then we have to name the planet," say the reporters. "Rubberball!  Texas 2!" (I just realized that the following doesn't make much sense unless I explain that I was thinking of the Sun also.  The solar system as a whole ((excluding moons)).  Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Just, Set, Up, Nine, Planets.  10.) "But ten was such an nice number," say the mathmen. "So is 11!  It's two ones!  We're #1 #1!"  Dorks, dorks, good weekend to you, dorks.

      Happy birthday to you, Happy first official and by official I mean first recognized by the media when in fact it's been an ongoing battle for more than a decade and not a first birthday to you, Happy birthday, War - in - I-R-AAAQ.   Happy birthday to you. Now, blow out the burning children and make a wish.  Weird times, dorks.  Things personally are getting better and better for me.  However, now that I don't have to focus on my own lot and now that I have your attention, I feel I should be punching the world awake.  Maybe it's just youth, maybe it's just pictures, maybe I've caught my R. Matey's fever ...  She's doing better by the way, thanks for asking.  Well, she's either doing better, or she has mono. Either way, she's cute when she's sick.   A blind man with a seeing eye dog at his side walks into a grocery store. The man walks to the middle of the store, picks up the dog by the tail, and starts swinging the dog around in circles over his head. The store manager, who has seen all this, thinks this is quite strange. So, he decides to find out what's going on. The store manager approaches the blind man swinging the dog and says, "Pardon me. May I help you with something." The blind man says, "No thanks. I'm just looking around."  Hahahahaha, fuck ... now, that's funny, dorks!  Happy St. Patty's Day, dorkles!  From all of your Scotch/Irish freinds at Dorks Don't Rock .. Get drunk, start a fight and have unfulfilling sloppy sex tonight! Blarney, dorks, blarney!

      Busy. Sick. Running around.   Drove sick girl to hospital last night, picked her up at 2 this morning.  Her kidneys went on strike. I hate hospitals, dorks, hate hospitals.  It's sad to see people stripped down to their blood and fear.   An e-mail I was going to write to Eva Moore today, but instead I'll write it here because I'm killing birds with stones here, dorks. Eva, I went to the hospital last night.  (My girlfriend)'s roommate was sick.  She got no kidneys.  Anyways, I saw something you might find interesting.  What, praytel, you ask? And I respond ... get the fuck out of here with that praytel shit. And then I say ... I saw you.  Well, I saw what you will be when you are 50.  When you are 50 you will cut your right pointer finger and wrap it up with a wad of either cheap gauze or good kitchen paper towels.  You won't be in pain, just a little worried.  Your mind won't be focused on the hospital.  Instead, you will be either thinking about a book you just finished or something your brother said to you. You will still wear glasses.  Your pajamas are hard to distinguish from your summer clothes.   You will get sick of waiting and realize you can patch yourself up.  You'll walk out of the hospital with a look that says "My finger hurts and I'm alone with this" or "I don't want to see this much of this part of the world for a long time". If, when you're 50, you are thinking the later ... we'll have shared a thought 26 years apart. R. Fever is sick too, fever of 101.3.  Me help with ice water, lots of blankets and a cold press.  I'm Dr. Frankenstein for fevers.  "It's Aleve ... it's ALEVE!!" All I want to do is go back to her apartment and crawl into bed, close my eyes and not hear anything.  Wrap my arm around my R., sleep, let my headache and snot drip away and dream about zombies, sweet blissful zombie hunting dreams.  Forehead kisses and zombies, dorks, that's all I need. Not much more to say except ... whew. Whew, dorks ... mutha punching, whew.

      "Time and again, George Bush has failed to give those fighting the war on terror -- whether they're overseas or over here -- the weapons, equipment and support they need." Dorks, dorks, dorks.  Does this sound like a "slam"?  CNN claims "Kerry slams Bush over war on terror."  I was thinking, "Goddamn, a slam!  This is going to be good!" "That muthafucka ain't done shit for Kerry.  And if he ain't done shit for Kerry than he ain't done shit for none of you fuckers either.  That ass licker best start doing and stops lying before I go from straight chillin' to straight killin'." But instead we get the above quote.  See, dorks, it's all just a hyperbole to keep your mind fucked.  "Kerry slams" "Nation mourns" "America attacks" "Terrorists threaten" "War mounts" "Security lowers" "Dorks Don't Rock".  And now you're starting to see through the hype. PUBLIC ENEMY RULES!

      Morning, dorks.  Have a good weekend? Me too.  Me and R. Consumer went and did some shizopping.  Things we now mutually own together: -Plates -A Vacuum -Shower curtain -Bathmat -Welcome rug -A slip mutha covering cover and other stuff, etc.  It's weird to mutually own anything (besides a case of beer) with someone.  We are just a few weeks away from the big move in. Yip-mutha-readin-ee!  I am so ready to have a place to call home and not just a backpack full of clothes in different locations. What'd I do this weekend.  Well, I was sick on Friday and so was R. Sniffles so that meant that we did jack shit.  I was so wound up from last week with it's sicknesses and exploding heads and other Kyle fueled anger that, in fact, I have no idea what we did on Friday.  I do remember that I went to Taco Bell and that I was dazed in my typical "7 layer good, but 2 tacos for same price" daze when I heard the Lovely couple saying my name behind me.  Apparently they had been standing in line behind me and I hadn't noticed. In turn, the female part of the L.C. didn't notice that I was right in front of her.  Guess what?  She's my cousin.  I guess there's some sort of "Tacos have preponderance over people" gene in my family. I like saying "In turn".  I'm going to use it more often. "In turn, I say to you, good sir of Wendy's that yes I shall indeed Biggie Size." "So, I was wasted and, in turn, I took on SIX COPS!" "Dammit, I missed my turn ... in turn." Want another reason to laugh at Ashton Kutcher?  O.K., here you go. http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/lifestyle/164606_vondutch.html Isn't that the most ridiculous story about hats that you've ever read?  It's like wearing an "I Love Ghandi" shirt to a fist fight, or a "George Washington ruled" shirt while you chopped down an apple tree, or making a very violent movie to spread the word (or your particularly warped view thereof) of Christ. Hey, who remembers Stussy?  Can you still buy a Stussy hat?  Or what about Yaga?  Or was it Yaya?  I was always afraid to ask because then I would ruin the carefully constructed image of hipness that I had created.  I had a kickass Stussy hat in high school, but then some dude said that if you read the signature all funny it said "I am gay".  So, of course, I couldn't wear it because my cock hadn't started it's growth spurt. That's right you started reading a simple paragraph about hats and high school memories and then all of a sudden (BA-DAM) you have to read about my junks.  I like to keep you on your toes and on my tip, dorks. So, on Saturday the R. Girl and me boy went and played disc golf with the L.C. That was fun and frustrating.  I couldn't seem to get my game together, so of course I spent more money on new discs.  They were having a tournament and all of these great players were out there, which ruined my self confidence faster than a Stussy hat. There was this group of deaf guys in front of us playing ( I now know how to say "Knucklehead" in sign language).  We were all slowed down because of the tourney ( I said "tourney", I miss the March fever that college life brings on) and frequently spent time together at tee pads waiting for other groups to throw.  At the 10th (and I know I might have that wrong and a part of the L.C. will catch it) hole, which has a huge hill just off the teepad that has a baseball field at the bottom, the deaf guy (sorry, guy who is deaf) with dreads and wearing the "Weedies" t-shirt throws a slice into the outfield.  So he walks away angry at himself, but fogets that his buddies haven't thrown yet.  But what can you do when a deaf stoned guy is walking in front of your disc's flight path?  (I think it was R. Girl that made the joke about stomping on the ground 4 times ... get it?)  So, that was funny for all the deaf and hearing people. I bought the original "Dawn of the Dead" on DVD this weekend.  It was awesome. Well, I really should work or something.  Later, dorks.

      Dorks, how's it going?  I'm good.  Heading to the beach with R. Bubbles tomorrow.  We got us this here hotel room with a bay window that overlooks the ocean ... as you sit in a hot tub, mother fuckers!   But first more shopping at IKEA tonight. Want to hear something cool that happened to me? OK. How many of you dorks have watched "The Sopranos"?  OK, one, two ... um, 24.  OK, good, then you'll follow me. I was listening to the Sopranos soundtrack on the way to work this morning.  As I got closer to work the last track came on, which was a bunch of quotes from the show. "Owee, I pinched my pinky." "You really look good in green, Tony." "Hey, who needs a hug and a cupcake?" After these actual quotes the theme song for the show came on ... just as I was pulling into my office parking lot.  You woke up this morning Got yourself a gun, (Hell yeah, roll down my window) Mama always said you'd be The Chosen One. (Pull my access card out) She said: You're one in a million You've got to burn to shine, (That's right, can't no security gate stop me) But you were born under a bad sign, With a blue moon in your eyes. (Look at this fucker with the briefcase, what a mook) You woke up this morning All the love has gone, (That's right, mamagamook, keep walking.) Your Papa never told you About right and wrong. (Don't noone mess with T. I mean B.)  We'll fast forward a bit.  As I'm parking my truck these lyrics come on.  When you woke up this morning, When you woke up this morning, When you woke up this morning, You got yourself a gun.  I parked my truck at the same point in the song that Tony parks his in the opening credits!  No fast forwarding, nothing, just perfectly in synch with my actions!  God loves a soundtrack!  Later, dorks, weekend!

      A conversation (circa. 2001). Kyle: (looking at meat grilling) Man, look at that.  That was alive once. Me: Don't be too sad for the cows, dude.  If it weren't for us, the cows would not be alive in today's world.  What purpose would a cow serve besides for food? Kyle: Then what purpose do we serve? Me: To eat the fucking cow!  Two signs I saw whilst on my lunch break. "MOTORCYCLES USE EXTREME CAUTION" (on a wide open road) "Caution: CARS PARKING" (In a PARKING garage. "Is this where I park my squirrel?") Manufacture paranoia.   Sell more Subarus, safety scissors and wars.

      I'm eating peanuts (salted) out of the shell for breakfast.    Simple pleasures, like the ocean, help to keep us all in motion. Just like the waves below the gulls We all have crests, we all have lulls. But simple pleasures, like  peanuts, Christmas trees and girls' butts, Home Alone, parts one and two and the deep Pacific blue will make you flip from a standstill, sure. 'Cause simple pleasures are the cure.  Yizzy, dorks, what's been going on in your respective lives then, eh?  Dammit, not all at once!  Respective, respective. I had a good weekend.   R. Throaty was feeling better but playing a little sick.   This meant I got to play the doctor and prescribe her some ... poetry time over, dorks. I played basketball with this kid on Sunday?  What kid?  I don't know, just some 11 year-old kid that wanted to play basketball at R. Yankee's softball practice (and by the way, she's good.  I saw her whipping them softballs around all better than the other girls and I got excited. I got me a star athlete for a girl, I'm going to be the most popular kid at school!) Back to the kid, the Jordan to my Bird. At first, I let him win a game of HORSE. "Aw, shucks, you got me.  I guess I didn't bring my A game today." Then he wanted to play one on one.  I just met this kid and from his shooting techniques during HORSE and the fact that he's 4 feet tall I was guessing that he couldn't be TOO much better of a basketball player than me. This,of course, meant I gladly welcomed a one-on-one game. And goddammit, the little duthafluffer started doing all of this Nike commercial around the back Harlem Globetrotter hug the line shit.  Dammit! And if I got too close to him he started screaming "foul". I was trying to teach him about the neccessity of the hook shot and he was throwing the basketball at my butt so he could drive the rebound home. And I couldn't contest his Harlem butttrotting antics.  Like I'm going to get into a verbal argument with an 11 year old in a public park.   OK, so maybe I said a couple of times "Bullshit, that was out!" but other than that we played "Dominic-ball" "You talked, your point doesn't count." "I can throw the ball at your ass but you can't throw it at my feet, I hurt my leg." "Mumble, jumble, Racky-too.  You can't understand me, because I'm pre-pubescent." But then, the little punk hit me.   I had decided that he couldn't have all the rules the way he wanted them. "No, you can't go walking around with the ball out-of-bounds going 'nay,nay,nay,nay'.  I'm drawing the line there.  It's my ball." "It's my ball, check it to me." "Hell, no, you have to have some limits.  My ball." So, the kid hits the ball, which I'm holding, and it goes into my face and knocks my glasses sideways.  DAMMIT! I was Larry Fucking Hulk.   "All right, your ball," I said. But the game was mine. I pulled no more of my punches. Literally.  The kid took a couple elbows to the side and got slammed one time when he drew a charge.  I ran the points back up in my favor (I had been letting him keep a 3 point lead).  I ran around him like he was a track and my name was Jackie. I won the game 21-20.  And, yes, as you can probably guess from the score, I wasn't a complete ass.  I let it come down to the wire so we could have a big finish.  I even gave him the ball a couple times and let him run to the hoop really slow while I did "Sports Center" highlights voice-overs. "Dominic takes it up, this is for the win." But he couldn't complete the circuit and I got bored.  My win.  Well, technically my win, but we had to keep playing until he won.  My last goal didn't count because I had a hat on. And, yes, the kid had fun don't run off to call Social Services.  We have a playdate next Sunday for a little "Around the World" action.   Last week I read "Slapstick" by Vonnegut.  Good.  I'm rereading "Timequake" by the same guy.  I wish Kurt Vonnegut put out a new novel every week. I also bought "Children of the Corn" It's now time for "What Did Brent Say As the Credits Started to Roll on 'Children of the Corn'" "What the fuck did I just watch?" Join us next week when Brent watches "The Cat in the Hat". "Ass lickers!  Ass lickers them all!" Mike Myers is dead to me.  In my mind, Mike Myers got into a firey jet plane accident shortly after filming for the original Austin Powers ended.   Well, dorks, I really need to finish these peanuts.

      It's now time for "Brent Explains the U.S. Foreign Theater by Pretending He's Iraq and Chicken Nuggets are Oil"  Me: (sititng around in my apartment, eating chicken nuggets and watching T.V.) Man, I fucking love chicken nuggets.  No shit, these are awesome with honey or bbq sauce.  TV News Guy: Chicken nuggets make people fly. It's incredible but true.  Me: Shit, I better save some of these.  America: (busting down my door) Give us the chicken nuggets!  Me: No, I like them and they are mine.  America: (setting fire to my Adidas) There we burnt your shoes, now give us nuggets.  Me: What?!? No, now I want to give you nuggets even less.  America: You're insane! You kill babies! Give us the nuggets!  Me: Why are you here?  This is my apartment.  America: Are you threatening us?  Where do you hide your b.b. guns?!?!  Nuggets!  You are insane!  (Ten years later)  America: Can we have nuggets now?  Me: No.  Use your Texas nuggets.  TV News Guy: Dr. Phil has been murdered by not Brent.  America: Dammit!  You're insane and killed Dr. Phil.  Always remember Dr. Phil! give us nuggets! You will pay for Dr. Phil's death.  You own a flamethrower!  A nuclear weapon is your pillow!  (America breaks my plates and DVDs and sets fire to my couch ... and then shoots a puppy.)  Me: (Throwing an unbroken plate at America) Dammit!  Get out of my apartment without nuggets.  America: You attacked us!  You are insane!  You killed us!  Why did you not lay down and die?  Why do you fight back?  Why don't nuggets give us you?  We nuggets, you have, we kill, you no curl up and let us burn your puppies! NUGGETS! DR. PHIL! HIGHER NUGGET PRICES!  KILL YOU, DON'T KILL US!  ... we will be back in Fallujah. It will be at the time and place of our choosing. We will hunt down the criminals. -Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt  "Hey, how come you always step on my burnt flesh head after I kill your sister?"  Stupid, dorks.  You're being lied to.  Punch the world and the elephants fall off their towers.  In happier news R. Pillowcase and I are about done with unpacking, electrical sockets and "RARGRRRHH".  After two long days of no sleep, Taco Time and up-down stairs we are ready to enjoy the fruits of our laboratory.   We (I'm speaking for R. Silent here when really I'm unsure of her feelings on this subject, but if I'm wrong we'll just call it fiction) had the idea that moving in would be a magical process.  Much like Disney Land. Yes, dorks, exactly like Disney Land, no need to rethink that thought ... just run with it, Brent. "Oh, look, Goofy and Donald have come by to help move the couch." "Peter Pan did such a nice job setting up the shower curtain!" "Wow, Bugs Bunny, not only are you a Looney Tunes character and therefore an anachronism in this move-in fantasy, but you are also great at setting up a washer and dryer." And now I've lost my train of thought and I'm too wiped out to buy another ticket.   Dorks, dorks, dorks.

      Let's get de-lir-i-ous.  Nananana-na-nana.  Prince rhymed something with de-lir-i-ous.  Nananana-na-nana.   Future me was up very late last night lifting and opening. Color schemes and tidiness.  The fridge wasn't on, ice cubes to be made!  Too many DVDs, did I really need "Firestarter".  Oops, I forgot to clean out my coffee grinds from coffee pot ... 3 MONTHS ago.  Coffee is fur.  Girlfriend vomitous.  Lift a dresser, box spring.  No sleep yet.    I traveled to the future, my friends, on a machine fueled by Taco Time and redheaded smiles. In this future I have a toothbrush holder and a special cup for rinsing.  Ingenious.  In this future I hang my t-shirts on hangers.  I didn't know you could legally do that!   The future's so bright I gotta wear switchblades. Dorks, I want to crawl under my desk and sleep all day.  I could do it.  I could.   Dork-ir-i-ous.

      The prettier half of the Lovely Couple: No, she's not working with A.D.D. (ay-dee-dee) kids any more.  It's actually now "English as a Second Language" kids.

      While coming back from the grocery store on my lunch break today I started thinking about a writing excercise we did in my sophomore-level English comp. class.  The purpose of the excercise was to write a few sentences that showed a progression of a thought. I think mine went something like: Kirby Puckett is a dedicated baseball player and a good man. He played until he went blind one day. He also was nice to kids in the community.  In retrospect (and because of Kirby's "touchy feely" charges) I think I should have instead written the following: Abraham Lincoln hated doing algebra. He was sure that Albert Einstein had invented it just to make him look dumb. So, Abraham focused on writing during his school days. Because of this we have The Gettysburg Address.  That seems a lot more interesting and creative.  Oh, dorks, I went to the beach.  Let me ask you, dorkwaves, have you ever laid on a full-size fold out couch, chugging wine while you stared out a window at the ocean a mere 200 yards away and your red hot girlfriend lounged sedated and bare in a hot tub only a few feet from you admiring the same view while R. Kelly's remix to Ignition played in surround sound throughout your villa including in your master bedroom where a King sized bed awaited you with comforters surely made from the hides of angels and baby rabbits?  No?  I have, fuckers, I HAVE!   This weekend ruled like no other. I flew a Ninja Turtle kite on the beach for hours on end. I bought a bumper sticker that says "I love dinosaurs". I ate buffalo jerky. I ate blueberry pancakes. I ate a pizza that had cashews and feta cheese as toppings. I slept in a bed for the first time since I was 3 where my feet didn't hangover the edge. And for two whole days I didn't talk to anyone except my lovely R. Tickles. You want to know how you know how you've found someone special, dorkles?  You don't realize that you've just spent 2 whole days without talking to someone besides them until you have to answer questions of "How was it?" bursting your bubble.  Bursting your bubble of waves and R. Kelly. And, lo, I say onto thee, the dorks of now and forever, remember this day for now and forever.  For this is the day that Bachelor Brent lays down in his cave of cigarette butts and Hustler back issues.  Yea, tomorrow and forever shall be the day when he known as Brent moves forth into his apartment with she known to all as R. Bunnycurls. The bachelor is dead. Long live the king!  He's checking his list, going to IKEA twice, tomorrow he moves in with his girl who is nice. Bachelor Brent is going away. He knows he must be tidy. He knows he can't stay drunk. He knows he has to wash his feet And not always be scratching his junk. Oooohhhhh, he now owns a rug He now owns plates. Who the fuck is this guy for Christ's sake? He's Future Brent and he's here to stay!  Dorks, I won't give you the sappy shit ("she melted over me like putty"? what the fuck?).  Just know I'm smiling 147 % more often these days.    He's Fu-ture Brent and he loves you dooooorrrrrrks!

      Dorks, dorks, dizzydorkles. How've ya been?  I hope that you all didn't blow up or get mono.  I did neither.  I be busy with my new apartment ... and my new XBox.   The apartment thing is going smoother than a fatty's trip to the store for some Twinkies.  And you know fatties make it easy because of the fat. The apartment is a perfect blend of Glade Plug-Ins and my Adidas, Pink and Knives, Utensils and B.B. Guns, Stuffed animals and Porn.  Many nights I stay up late to play my XBox and drink beer long after R. Slumber's has gone to rest and I think, "I live with a girl and I haven't died yet.  Wicked." Plus, I've convinced her to call me "Best Rapper Alive" (the new Jay-Z album is good), so that makes it awesomererererrr. I cook and I clean dorks.  I'm getting matureereerrrer. Every morning I: -brush AND rinse. -put foot cream on feet -take calcium pills for weakening bones (especially my knees). -take antidepressant so I don't scream "Lead pipes! Head blow!" while at work. -take a Claritin b/c my body now hates grass, pollen, bees, peanut butter, milk, cheap beer, whores, Montana and cats. -make a lunch, which I actually do at night. -return my towels to where they belong, not in R. Bumpers car!   -put things in "hampers" I like it dorks, I'm getting it down!   Hahahahahahahaha, fuck, Brent you are so funny.  It's easy to do what you do.  I bet one day you woke up and could write so goddamned good. NO! To play like the playa I be you gots to play lots like me. I found some of my old writings the other night while unpacking, dorktittyers.  The paper is fading and they might soon be lost, so I'm going to post them here. And they will live for enternity in your hearts. Then you will realize the path of the genius. The following are journal entries I wrote during "Career Math" my senior year in high school (6 years ago now).  I had elected to take Career Math instead of Triangle Math because I wanted to slack and daydream about ninjas and Pringles (which will be evident here very, very soon, Dorklock Holmeseesssesss).   I fit in about as much as an eskimo fits in at a Subway. "Mighty Quin like seal on sandwich." "That's a very racist impersonation of an eskimo ordering lunch.  GET OUT! Lead pipes!" "Mighty Quin alone with hunger."  On the second week we learned to do addition.  What did we do the first two weeks?  Regression of horror keeps me from telling you.  I wrote most of these in 2 minutes (like my blog!). I won't change my typos, just for you.  Let's do it, dorks.   (Name three people you'd like to meet and why.) Kirby Puckett - He's, in my opinion, one of the greatest baseball players ever.  But he's more than that he's a great human being, always nice to his fans and he held on to playing the game until he couldn't go any further. Teddy Roosevelt- He's the guy who said walk softly and carry a big stick, the way I think every man should live his life.  I'd like to go on safari with him and shoot lions and Rhinoceroses and giraffes and bears. Beastie Boys (all of them) - It'd be cool. We'd break stuff and yell at people and other stuff.  I think they are great musicians I like that Sabotage son.  Bum-bum-bum-bum-It's a SABOTAGE!  (Philosophy on life) My philosophy on life is simple it comes in three easy statements #1 = never worry about anything that will not matter a week from now. #2=God is real #3= Do what you gotta do. It's that simple.  It's like one of them No Fear shirts.  They're pretty comfortable and they got some pretty witty statements like "Beat Death Up when he comes for you."  I agree.  It's like that poem "Don't go gently ..."  It goes "Blah, Blah, Blah, RAGE, RAGE against that thing Blah, Blah"  It's a good poem, you gotta fight for your right. You know 'cause life's just like a big spinning wheel you gotta stay ahead of it or else it would crush you and you'd go "Ahhhh." Life is good.  (Something you wanted but couldn't have) I wanted a bear, a real live grizzly bear.  But my mom was like "yah, yah, yah, it will eat you yah, yah, yah, blod and guts, yah, yah, yah, shut up" so I felt bad and I went to the zoo and hopped in the bear pit.  Sure enough the bear was mad.  He tried to eat me.  So I ripped out his throat and showed it to him.  I was like "Hi-Ya" and his body went thunk.  The zoo people were like "you killed him, we kill you"  But my mom showed up and they wussed out.  Boy she was mad.  But I was like "It was scary." So she gave me some Jello Pudding Pops.  I like them Jello Pudding pops.  I eat them up.  "Slurp!" That's what it's like.  I like bears a lot though they're pretty cool.  I wouldn't like to just fight with them.  (How to save electricity)  *Turn off lights *Be Amish *Live in the woods *Bonfires *Be homeless *Unplug dryer and shake dry *Take cold showers *Don't do anything *Blow up the electricity company *Rip out your neighbors electrical lines *Shoot out your lights *Get rid of your TV and hide in your neighbors bushes and watch thier TV  Just don't knock on their window and say "Hey, turn it up."  They'll know you're there then.  (A good investment and a bad investment) I bought a tattoo that was cool.  The needle didn't feel nice and I think the guy who did it was into drugs.  But it was a good investment it was worth it.  I think I'll get lots of chicks b/c of it. A bad investment was when I got the salad bar and some cheez stix at a restaurant.  I was REALLY hungry and I had plenty of $ so I thought, "Hey" and I ordered lots but after like 3 bites I was Ll "Uhh, I'm stuffed."  That was stupid of me it cost a lot and I felt sick.  My tattoo is better than a salad.  Although, you can't eat my tattoo, unless you're a freak like on that movie "Alive" when they ate that ladies flesh.  They were just supposed to play soccer, not eat flesh!  (Something about the middle east and what you want to do with laws.  Not really sure, they start to get whackier.  And please remember that I wasn't this dumb, just this bored.) I think we should blow up all of the Middle East, even the countries we like.  Those sand people always get you in the end.  Sadam Hussein would have been a really bad leader if he was VOTED in.  I think our guns are pretty good now-a-days.  WE can shoot pretty far and do LOTS of damage.  Iraq is supposed to be really big on American TV shows like "Mama's Family" or so they say.  Those big ships we keep sending over there are pretty big.  I bet they'd be pretty scary to see coming across the water.  If I were the president I would make it illegal to NOT turn right on red.  I always get stuck behind some doofus. I think it would be nice if it were legal to knock down people on bikes.  (People that bother you) My brother Mrs. (teacher in high school) Communists Chipmunks, especially when they make that noise. My boss Freakin Santa always wantin' me to be nice. Drunk girls at parties Mexicans who stand in the road. Big mecanics who think you should pay $95 for new brakes like it's their car and then they say that they can't let you go. Drunk girls at McDonalds People who ring bells and ask for $ Old women who think you're cute Drunk girls who go trick-or-treating at 3 in the morning. Drunk girls that puke when you're trying to make a move.  (Opinion on prayer in school) I was thinking about prayer and I decided it would be best if kids could say a little prayer, it's like Madonna when she said "poppa, don't preach, I'm in love again."  It's more like "teacher don't preach, these kids can't handle it." God is everywhere and everyone can talk to him so why can't you be in Geometry and be like "God you're cool."  Because sometimes we all need to talk to God. especially at school.  Yep, God knows what we're going thru so I think the teachers need to get rectified (?).  We need a new Crusades where we go thru the schools and chop people's heads off if they don't let you pray (Tell me, dorks.  Was this written pre-Columbine?  Today's kids would be put in sand people jail for writing that!) We'll be like "Pray" and if they say "No" We'll go "Arrr" and hit them with an axe.  (Scariest movie?  What do you think of Halloween?) Scariest movie is the original "Night of the Living Dead".  Oh boy, I almost wet my pants every time I see that one.  They try to burn them zombies but they can't do it.  They all die but these two people live but they get shot.  This little girl eats HER OWN MOTHER.  Ahhhh!  My god, my mother would take my driving privelages away if I even thought about eating her (no snickers, you sick fuck dorks).  But this girl did it (hehe).  She went "Ahh-Chomp-Chomp".  And then she got shot.  I once saw this kid walking around on Haloween with a shovel sticking out of his head.  I thought it was a pretty scary costume.  I got scared.  The kid kept saying, "For the love of God, it's real, call the paramedics."  Sure enought it was for real and he died, but he was very scary.  (Current event or space bugs.) Starship Troopers is a very current even.  It's the biggest movie about killer bugs since "Schindler's List".  I like it.  It's making a lot of $ I hear they are going to take all the $ it's making and give it to the poor people for welfare.  That will solve the problem.  What if those space bugs were real.  I bet I would hide if I saw one.  But if there was a girl around I'd stop hiding and kill some space bugs.  BOOM-BOOM that would be my gun.  Those space bugs would be like "AHHHHH" and I'd go "Ha-ha-ha" or "Ho-ho-ho" if I felt like all Christmasey.  I like Christmas.  But I like Starship Troopers better.  I've seen it twice.  I want to see it again.  I only saw Schindler's List once.  It was good.  It was about Nazis.  (Something you want to change about yourself) I would like to change my height.  I wish I was 20 ft. tall and all the people would say "Hey tall guy" and if I didn't like them I'd go "Arrrr" and step on their heads.  So there.  I want to keep my head though, it is good to have around.  I once saw a guy get his head taken off and he wasn't happy.  It was on a Popeye cartoon so he didn't die, but he was sad.  Popey was cool.  He like spinach.  Have you ever tried spinach on your pizza (teacher response: nope) it is good.  (New Year's resolution) My New Year's resolution can best be summed up in a poem by Shel Silverstein (a.k.a. Best Rapper Alive).  I came upon a box and opened it up wide and gasped to see a dead body dead inside. There was a note attached that he'd decided to leave that only said... "I forgot to breathe". That's all .. I resolve to remember too breathe.  (Million dollar house or million dollar car?) I'd want a car I'd put all sorts of things on it like guns and wheels and paint.  It'd be like r-r-r-r-r-Purring like a kitten.  All the girls would be like "Hey, big Brent boy" and I'd be like "Hey, baby" than their boyfriends would be like "Hey you, go away"  than I'd pull out my rocket launcher and be all KA-BOOM and they'd go "splat" so than I'd tell their woman to get in and she'd love me because my car is really cool.  I'd be like Burt Reynolds on Smokey and the Bandit.  "This is the Bandit," I'd say.  "No, it's Brent," they'd say.  Then I'd run them over with my car.  I'd be mean, real mean and I could live in my car.  I don't need a house my car is cool. Vroom-Vroom all aboard the fast car machine!  (Interesting?) Something that I find interesting is Madonna.  She's the material girl and she don't want her poppa to preach.  I think she's cool.  She's all like "If I want to wear cones on my breasts and get freaky then that's my business."  She had that book named Sex.  Taht's a good name for a book.  If I were to write a book it not be about sex though it would be about grizzly bears.  I bet Madonna wouldn't think twice about shooting a grizzly bear because she's a superstar and probably a jerk.  (Write about mean, median and mode) (Nope.)  That's about it for my career math writing career.  You see, dorks, it takes a lot of time and talk about grizzlies to be a world class writer like I am.  dorksdontrock is what it is today thanks to my time in Coach Head Guy's class.  I'll never forget you, Coach Head Guy With Glasses. And I'll never forget you dorks.  You are all so cute. (Psssst, I found my creative writing stuff too..... shhhhhhh). Weekend, dorks.

      I'm sorry, dorks.  I get into my rappin' moods and I forget to tell you about what else I'm up to. So, today I started carpooling with this chick who works at the Department of Ecology.  She is definitely not the kind of person who would like being called "this chick who works at the Department of too much typing". She was talking about carpooling and some van and her foster kids and trees and buildings and I wasn't listening and driving and not listening and trying to avoid bringing up lesbians, which I don't think I normally would have except I realized about halfway to work "OH, she's a lesbian" (maybe it was because she was going on about saving the "bushes" Ha, fuck). So, that was good and I like getting to work in 25 minutes and not an hour and 15 apples ... minutes, not apples, Brent.  You eat apples.  Anyways, my car smells like hippies. Man, I used to hate hippies in high school.  I think it was because they sat on the ground.  To this day I refuse to sit on the ground if I can avoid it. Man did not evolve millions of apples (dammit, years) to grow legs and hands and invent screws and wood to build chairs for hippies to sit on the ground!  "It's a sit-in!" "Dammit, no it's a sit-on!"  I should do a remake of that movie "Hair" and instead call it "Chair".  That's a really dumb idea.  In it I will teach hippies about chairs and show them how to use them. "This is the dawning of the age of the Lay-Z-Boy ... the age of the Lay-Z-Boy ... THE LAY-Z-BOY!" Yep. Just a few minutes ago I was getting on the elevator to go up ('cause it ain't time to get down yet, a-huh!) and this lady who I haven't told you dorks about did something stupid.  I haven't told you about her mainly because I don't want her soul fouling up my precious dorksite.  It's like the Amish and their fear of cameras; I feel if I utter her existence here she will capture my soul!  Her name is Wig Wolf!  She is the darkness of Hell!  I hate Wig Wolf!  Sometimes I have nightmares that she is at my apartment very late at night to bother me.  I wake up in a cold sweat screaming, "No Wig Wolf!  Rainbows on your shirt don't cover the Hell in your belly!  Your belly!" And then R. Sleepy rubs my back. Witness the fire! (This time the e-mails are in order. I love you.)  [this is kyle, brent fell in a hole. he asked me to type this ("kyle, i'm in a hole. go update my site"). These email correspondence are REAL. like Fo' REAL. okay. i'm done]  From: 	Wig Wolf To: 	Kinkade, Brent Subject: 	Sorter Importance: 	High  Brent, The sorter you dropped off, is made out of pressed cardboard.  Can you please return this one and get me a plastic one.  This one is not cost efficient because it is going to fall apart, especially the lettering.  The lettering is taped on to the ends.  I got approval for a sorter and I would prefer to get the sorter that I know will last me a long time, compared to one that is going to fall apart in no time.  Please order me a plastic sorter.  Please let me know if you need me to look at the Boise catalog or if you need to see (a woman)'s sorter again. Thank you, Wig Wolf  ---------- From: 	Kinkade, Brent To: 	Wig Wolf Subject: 	RE: Sorter  Wig Wolf, I called around for you.  (Girl #2) has a plastic sorter that she says you can use when you need one.  She doesn't use it often. If you want to hold on to the one you have for future use you may or I will return it. In the future, please ask the different sales supports if they have supplies they can share or let you have. This is more cost and time efficient. Thank you, Brent ----------  From: 	Wig Wolf To: 	Kinkade, Brent Subject: 	RE: Sorter  Brent, (Woman #1) checked with (man) and he didn't have any. (Man) said that (Girl #2) had borrowed his sorter.  We need more than one sorter flooding around.  If (Man) should need it, I would not have one to use.  If (Girl #2) should need it, again I would not have one to use.    When I need to sort, I need to sort, it is not something that I can put off for very long and that is why I felt the need to ask you to order one for me.  You can check with (a woman), as to how many times we need the sorter at the same time.  There are times that (women) and I need the sorter at the same time.  It is not unreasonable to ask for a tool that we need to do our job and it is not unreasonable to get the quality that we ask for.    Brent, don't get me wrong, I believe that you checked, but I know that there are better qualities of sorter and I would like for you to order me one.  Please check for me, and please let me know if I need to escalate this request. Thank you, Wig Wolf  -------  Wig Wolf, I don't believe this issue warrants this much time or communication.  The problem is easily resolved.  Bring the old sorter down and I will return it, the new sorter will be here tomorrow.   I was looking for the most "cost effective" way to solve the problem as that seemed to be your original concern.   Thanks, Brent   This is Wig Wolf!  This is a taste of her viciousness.  She is vile, all hate Wig Wolf! Back to my original story.  Me: (getting on the elevator, which Wig Wolf is on by herself) Hey, hold the elevator.  Wig Wolf: I'm going down.  Me: (noticing that the up light is lit, door closing) But, the light says your going ... (door closed)  I hear the elevator go UP! UP NOT DOWN!  WIG WOLF!  I wait for the elevator again and go up.  While I'm upstairs I see Wig Wolf!   "Have a nice weekend, Brent," she snarled. "I will have nightmares about you for life," I responded. "My soul is pure fire," said Wig Wolf "Yes, and God shuns ye," I said. "That's me!"  I think I had something else to say, but ah well it's time to go pick up Janis Joplin and drink Wig Wolf away. Real weekend this time, dorks.

      Hahahahahaha. I was just laughing to myself and I thought I'd share the laugh with you, dorks. Here's a non-authentic transcript of a prank call I made my juniorish year in high school.  Operator: Thanks for calling Super Speed Readers, would you like me to set you up with our program?  Me: No, actually I've used it already.  I bought it about a month ago.  I can read a lot faster now.  Operator: Well, I'm glad you like it.  Me: Well, I like it, but I don't like what it's done to me.  Operator: What do you mean?  Me: I read really fast now, but maybe almost too fast.  I read so fast that some times I start puking.  Like motion sickness kind of.  Operator: You vomit?  Me:  Yeah, is there like a customer service person I can talk to?  I don't really want a refund, I just want to know if this is normal or if I need to go see someone.  Operator: You're saying you throw up because you read too fast?  Me: Yep, I just start reading and my eyes are moving so fast and I think it's faster than my brain can move so I think it pukes, like to maybe cover up the book so I can't read the words.  Operator: Please hold on while I get my supervisor.  Me: Nope. -Click-  Turned away from it all Like a blind man ... Bowie rules so hard!  Opens with "Rebel, Rebel" and 2 and half hours later closes with "Ziggy".   Me tired today, sore from sitting, didn't take dancing cues from limber balding gay men in front of me.  Full head hair straight boy stiff, bald gay men limber.   And the world turns on towards eternity. Outside they were selling t-shirts with a picture of 70s Bowie.  The shirt said "I Fucked Mick Jagger". I wanted one, but my stiff shoulders and full head of hair held me back. DORKWAD PLAYED GUIIIIIIIIIITAAAAAAAARRRRR!

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Heavy social drinkers show the same pattern of brain damage as hospitalized alcoholics -- enough to impair day-to-day functioning, U.S. researchers said Wednesday ...  This is why I do most of my drinking under a blanket in a dark closet instead of socially.  Speaking of society ... is President Bush getting more darling looking every day?  The picture of him and Ariel Sharon on cnn.com makes him look so precious.  Kind of like a lost puppy/boy.  And his press conference?  Forget about it!  He is by far the most progressively-boyish-by-the-day president ever. "Sir, I knew Jack Kennedy, he was a boyish-faced president, you sir are no Jack Kennedy... you're a pumpkin prince with chubby cheeks of gold and a tightlipped smile of pudding!" Almost makes you forget he's killing kids in other countries and dumbing up kids at home. BOWIE!  SPREE!   (A fratboy infiltrates!)

      Busy life for me a busy life indeed when I move so fast no commas come and all day long the work is done and periods are nay nay nay all I feel I have to say is busy dorks with bad grammar and happy days can't be too far  What a country! -I found a disc golf park 1.5 miles from our new apartment!  It is so beautiful that I want to deflower it.  I could walk there if I wasn't a recovering BigMac junkie or if I liked to walk!   I decided the other day when I was on a ride out to R. Pickles parent's (the cucumbers) for a bbq that I really don't like walks.  I'd rather stay in a relatively smaller area and jump around preferably with a ball.  I have to have a purpose to my leg motion. "Let's go for a walk." "Nope, let's do something useful." -I beat MaxPayne 2 last night.  I like running my proper nouns together.  BrentKinkade, MaxPayne, BigMac.  Very trendy looking. -For the last 2 and a half months I have taken part in a study to treat people with major depression. "When a lack of headaches is making your sex life grand and you hate it , call MajorDepression.  When you've been laid off and that pizza dough tosser boy job offer is looking good, call MajorDepression.  MajorDepression, he makes you say 'Maybe I won't have a burger'." So, there's a 50% chance that I've been taking a new drug that they are trying out, a 25% chance that I was taking, um, I can't remember it's name ... Luftextarasmiles and a 25% (50+25+25=100) chance that I was taking sugar or not sugar.  I won't know for a couple of years until the study is over. But anyways I feel much better and yes I will have that burger. Tomorrow I start Prozac.   Also, tomorrow I go see David Bowie and Polyphonic Spree.  Personally. "So, David Bowie, let's see you do Ziggy." "I'm so hipper than you even though I'm so older.  I will smile at you, but after 5 words I speak gibberish.  Flick flock puddy spoo." "What?" "Tipple crackers." What was that about?  So ... the girl person of the lovely couple (who really needs a much shorter name so now she's Jill, which she really isn't) Jill's dad got sick and she had to go visit him in Atlanta.  So, I get to go to see Bowie in her place with Jack (who played frisbee golf with me on Sunday and who I actually outdrove and, i said it (or am about to (parantheses)), outplayed on a few holes). So, Bowie tomorrow night. Tonight? Kill Bill Vol. 1, dorks.  And Costco hot dogs, dorks. And redheaded kisses, dorks. And leftover girly Smirnoff drinks, dorks. But now? It's time for "More Shit Brent Found". Here is one more of my writing examples that I found when I moved.  This is from creative writing and a bit more structured and punctured. It's a "Finish the story after Big Teacher Worked at Pizza Place finishes prompt". The set up was this: It's Halloween (this was written in the same year, and more than likely on the same day, of the Career Math Halloween entry ... "shovel in head") and this girl is driving home from a party.  She is all alone and she stops on a bridge.  The bridge is supposed to be haunted.  She does not like this situation.  She starts to strip.  She is super super stacked.  She whispers, "Brent, show me the triumph."  I whisper, "Does that mean  ....  Back to reality.  The night is dark and the bridge is dark and she reaches in her back seat for her flashlight when all of a sudden she feels a man's head.  He he. (my story starts now) THE TRAGIC ODYSSEY OF A HEAD ON HALLOWEEN "Hmmm there shouldn't be a head (he he) in my back seat (he he)."  Carolyn thought. She was right.  Her car did come with many options; air conditioning, AM/FM radio, cruise control, but most deffinitely not leathery, bald heads. "Gasp," she gasped.  ("Brent, good writers don't do this." "Yeah, well, good writers don't pee on your face.") Suddenly the head spoke.  Its voice was a raspy voice one that sounded like sandpaper against concrete. "Gack dat ackgah," said the head. "Here use some of this," said Carolyn pulling some throat spray from her bag. "Dack mak ugk," gagged the head. (I should have written "dackmakugked the head"). "Oh yeah, no arms, just a head," observed Carolyn. "Here let me bring you up front so I can spray it in your throat." So Carolyn picked the head up and plopped it on the passenger's side seat. "Say 'ahhh'," said Carolyn. "Aggkahk," said the head. She sprayed the head's throat.  He smiled. Carolyn liked his smile.  "Mature," she thought. "Hey thanks, babe," said the head. "Did you call me babe?" asked Carolyn, astonished. "Sure enough, sweet thing," replied the head. Carolyn was shocked, she couldn't believe it.  She couldn't get a man even if he was just a balding decapitated head.  So she leaned over and opened the passenger side door and pushed the head out. "All men are scum, even dead ones," she said. Now the head had been through a lot in his day but it doesn't matter if you were made part of the undead yesterday or last century, it still hurts to be shoved out of a Rambler going 60 miles per hour (which was stopped before, Brent). However, my future self is a picky ass, and as the head hit the pavement it bounced 15 ft. in the air!  This caused the head to fall over the bridge and land safely in the river below. "Thank goodness all that gel I use solidified into a hard rubbery substance on my scalping," said the head, "I may be bald, but I still know that gel is important." Well, it doesn't take the decapitated head of a rocket scientist to realize that heads sink in the water.  The head had to think fast.  Suddenly he remembered. (Here's a good question/lesson for aspiring young writers: when you realize that you have created an impossible situation for your character that doesn't even allow for much of a story do you  a.)rethink your entire piece b.) brain storm with fellow writers.  Your peers are your best resource. c.) come up with this ridiculous idea) "I'll use my outboard motor," he exclaimed. He'd almost forgotten about his signing bonus from the Dark Lord from when he joined the ranks of the undead.  So he yanked on the cord (how) with his teeth and the engine started instantly. "Purring like a kitten," said the head. Well, the head had a grand time skimming across the surface of that lake.  He only wished he had some skis he could strap on (he he) to his chin. But once again there was trouble.  How does a decapitated head reach the choke button and thus cut off the engine? (?)  He doesn't (well played, past me). So the head had no choice but to try and jump the shore and land in some leaves.  Well, he cleared the shore all right, but he didn't land in leaves.  He landed in a bag of Halloween candy of a tot passing by. "Hey, Ma, somethin' done landed in my bag," said the little inbred. "Well, what it be?" asked the mother. Gazing in the bag the child replied "A head." "Well, I be ... is it one of them heads of the undead that have been going around?" asked the mother. "Yes," the child replied, "and he has an outboard motor attached to him." "Hooey," hooed the mother.  "Mug him and take the motor." "Sure, Ma," said the boy. So the little child proceded to beat the head with a stick. "Hey, I'm just a head," said the head. "You could just take the motor." "Shut up, devil head," said the boy, delivering a rather vicious blow. The last thing the head thought before he passed out was ... H A P P Y     H A L L O W E E N  Well, dorks, it's time to go do things and stuff.  Remember when things aren't working out as planned have someone get beaten with a stick.  It will draw attention from your problems and quite possibly land you a motor.

      The Ranger Creed  RECOGNIZING that I volunteered as a Ranger, disregarding video games, television, political propoganda, movies, the education system, the economy, my father, sports, chicks, beer and advertisments as influences on my naturally influencable human mind.   ACKNOWLEDGING that a Ranger is a more elite soldier who honorably gets to shoot twice as many dark skinned people in hot parts of the world.  NEVER shall I fail my comrades or ask my Ranger buddy, Pippytits, things like "Hey, Pippytits, why did we just shoot that unarmed man?" or "Pippytits, do dark skinned people from this hot part of the world have a Heaven."  GALLANTLY I will show the world that I am a specially selected and well-trained soldier by wearing lots of tight t-shirts and Croakies on my Oakleys.  ENERGETICALLY I will meet the enemies of my country.  I will then invite them to my tent for soda and chips.  After a close game of Monopoly I will kill them.  I will always be the Scotty Dog piece, I will never be the Wheelbarrow.  READILY I will display the intestinal fortitude to say "intestinal fortitude" without laughing about poopy.  Laugh it out! Listen to me dorks!  Listen to the hype!   Pat Tillman will become a rallying point for the war hawks.  They will say things like "Be like Pat" and "Pat was a good American".  They will make Pat speak from the grave!  Pat will be the 2004 electoral zombie!  He is the wet dream for a war marketer. When you see Pat's face, dorks, and when you hear people talk about him remember this ... Pat Tillman died in Afghanistan so you could drive to the beach at lower gas prices, oil companies could punish their enemies and tycoons could have a hand in the world's biggest money maker called the U.S. Government.   Anybody who uses the dead as a puppet is an evil ventriloquist.  It's supposed to be nice this weekend in Seattle.  I hope it's nice where you are, dork reader.   Weekend.

      Productivity and desire to not work here fuel today. I may be up for a wicked new job.  It's another contract job, 6 months for sure, maybe 9 or a year.  Much more money, lots of experience and potential for something wicked afterwards.  No insurance though.  But, fuck it. When I was 10 years old I preformed surgery on my foot because some gross thing kept growing underneath it.  It was like yellow and bubbly. "Don't pick at it, Brent" "Eat it, Mom, I'm digging the fucker out!" Yep, I sure as a fatty likes vegetables said that.  Then as sure as a fatty likes fresh pie I got a pair of scissors and a big piece of chewing gum.  If you bite down on Bazooka hard enough you don't need morphine. So, I dug out whatever was bubbly and sticky and I was fine. My point?  I don't need insurance like a fatty needs ranch dressing.  I have some scissors and bubble gum.  Cancer?  Fuck it.  You can only root deep in your body with scissors until you pass out or dig the fucker out.  Either way works for me. So, me and Wig Wolf and Man Face and Crumble Cheeks and Jersey Hair and Stupid Mustache and Smile Guy and Mole Teeth might be parting ways here soon.  Or maybe not, who knows, it's a crazy world out there, dorks. I got my truck registered in Washington on my lunch break.  I wish I had put some thought into a kick ass vanity plate like ... BLLKIKER STPDHIPY ILUVMACE GOFATTY URAFATS DRKSDTRK MMMCAKE or KITNKLR Those would all be good. So, thanks to a Pentagon mandate the media are not allowed to put out pictures of dead soldier's coffins coming home? What the fuck do you think goes on in war, dickfaces? "I say, I've been shot, Timothy." "My, Pippytits, call a time out and I'll go get Mom."  In the war young Johnny did die then he came home so Mommy could cry. He died from a headshot near Kabul. They showed his headshot from high school, but not the coffin where he rests. 'Cause we don't want voters to get upset.   And poets die sooner than water skiiers?  Good thing I'm a bad poet. Later, dorks.

      Morning, dorks.  Gotta a lot to say, so let's go! Went to the baseball game last night.  Mariners won it 2-1 in the ninth.  Made for a fun little date with R. Third Base. Dorks, are there times in YOUR lives when you go "Hey, what the hell?"  or "What the hell, hey?"  or "Was that the Maytag Repairman that I just met?", because in my "cartoonish" reviewed life I say that often.  Well, with the Maytag Repairman it was just last night that I said that. Yep, I met the Maytag Repairman.  Isn't that a random, random person to meet at a baseball game.  I know I felt up Mrs. Butterworth at a coke party once and played Tekken 3 against the Pillsbury Doughboy at a local arcade, but the Maytag Repairman?  He's like the living god of the unliving corporate mascots!  His ability to actually use paper towels makes him far more dietiesh than the Bounty man! So, after shaking his amazingly silky soft hand ('cause he don't work, dorkitches!) I told him that I did as little work as him all day (and I do! I get paid to do this!). So he signed my glossy picture of him and his young assistant: "To Brent, I know how you feel!  Depend on me!  From Ol' Trusty, FARdlkjBarthly (Can't read his signature)" His strikingly handsome counterpart (hey, I can admit it when a dude is Greekesque in his handsomeness.  I won't say guys like Harrison Ford are handsome, that's a little much.  But guys like the younger Maytag Repairman?  You have to respect their handsomeness ... or you're gay.) signed it: "To Brent, Come join our team and do nothing. STAY CLEAN! Franck;jj OUUUllllw3 (again with the signature)"  "STAY CLEAN!" it's like he knows about how I have to clean my feet and wear deodorant and wipe up spaghetti stains to maintain impress over R. Girly!  He feels my pain!  He really knows me for who I am.  I'm messy, I like teams, he knows the real me!  Maybe I should call him.  No, too soon.  Maybe ... SNAP out of it! So the picture hangs in my office.  Read it, rubberheads and not understand.  To not understand is a rubberheads greatest natural resource. A treat from the creative writing vaults! For this exercise we had to take a horrible play called "The Open Window" and write a screenplay for it.  Fun!  A screenplay!  Awesome!  For "The Open Window"?  Lead pipes!  Lead pipes! Here's the premise of the play.  This nervousa guy goes to visit this family.  This little bitch tells him about her dead dad and brother and how her mom keeps the window open so their souls can come in and out and drink coacoa.  Then the "ghosts" walk through the door and it turns out the little brat was lying that they were dead and the guy becomes a Highlander. Get it?  Good.  Here's my screenplay for it.  THE OPEN WINDOW Screenplay by Brent Kinkade (1998) Adapted from A. Dumwriter (from Hell)  Cast Mr. Nutel-Crazy guy with a sleep disorder Vera(young lady)- Niece w/ an attitude Mrs. Sappleton - Not crazy, but thought to be Mr. Sappleton - Not dead Dog- Does his thing doggy style (I actually wrote that in high school and got a 20/20 for it!  Gold star!)  (Victorian townhouse living room with a large open window (!) that reaches the ground on the wall.  There are about 5 or 6 trophy heads decorating the walls and the seats are large and leather)  (Camera pan out of Vera's face while she's speaking) Vera- My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel, in the meantime you must try and put up w/ me.  (Camera continues to pan out until you see her entire body, she is thin and frail)  Vera- (Motioning for Mr. Nuttel to sit) Do you know many people round here?  Frampton- (sitting cautiously after wiping at the seat) Hardly a soul, my sister was staying ...  Vera- Yeah, yeah then you practically know nothing about my aunt.  Frampton- (shifting in his seat, perturbed by being interupted) only her ...  Vera- (interupting again) Her great tragedy happened three years ago.  Frampton- (Opens mouth to ask question, but...)  Vera- You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon  Frampton- It is ... (any of you dorks notice if the high school writer is getting bored with his material yet?  You will!)  Vera- (interupting) Three years ago boys leave.  Bog suck them down.  Many moons my aunt has kept window wide until the great fireball has set.   Oh, her ailment can be cured by no mediceman.  She believe boys come home soon.  Crazy white woman.  I'll scalp her.  Frampton-(looking confused) Why are you talking like an Indian?  (Enter Mrs. Sappleton) Mrs. Sappleton-I hope Vera has been amusing you.  Frampton-She has been...  Mrs. S. (Interupting- I hope you don't mind the open window but we are playing a cruel joke on you because we think you're ugly and smell bad.  Frampton-(looking up) Excuse me? I didn't hear you.  Mrs. S.- Nevermind let me rattle on cheerfully (Camera pans in on Mrs. S. until only her mouth is seen, switch over to Frampton. Again pan in but to his eyes.  Suddenly he looks shocked, becaus there are the dead men at the window.  He runs away)  Mr. S.-What was his problem?  Mrs. S.-Drugs.  Mr. S.- Oh.  Look little doggy-kins has learned a new trick!  (Dog dances around while balancing a ball on his nose.  Everyone laughs and the camera pans out .... the open window).   There you go, dorks.  I need to go not work now.

      Happy week to you, dorks.  Did you all have a pretty little weekend?  I did.  I saw me Kill Bill Vol. 2 on Friday.  I was supposed to go with the L.C. to see it later in the weekend, but I couldn't sit still knowing that Darryl Hannah was kicking ass.   After that I stayed up late and drank beer. The next day was Date Day with R. Tanktop.  We went shoe shopping(yes shoe shopping and BARGAIN shoe shop at that, dork princesses), bought a new ottoman, got a kickass margarita set and of course some tequila.  But Date Night was cut short when R. Sicky got a little upset stomach from eating too much mayonaise on her club sandwich ("And I ain't even a member"). There is nothing less sexy than mayonaise, dorks. If I wanted to punish terrorists I would replace their blood with mayonaise via slow transfusion.  Oh, it makes me sick! Miracle Whip is the money-shot-in-a-jar stuff.   I've always had a problem with trusting other people's mayonaise (and still do!).   After my parents divorced I would go visit my Dad in Virginia and try to make sandwiches with his mayonaise but I just couldn't. I have to be present at the purchasing of the mayonaise for it to be O.K. by me. What?  Enough about mayonaise?  You know I'm babbling to cover my Saturday emasculation?  What's emasculation?   So, yes R. Woods beat me at mini-golf on Saturday and as a consequence I have to make dinner and do the dishes every night this week. We were tied going into the 18th hole and then I choked harder than a clown on cock.   So, last night I made spaghetti.  (clowns---cock---spaghetti,  If this entry had one of the heavily-elipsed pull quotes it might say "I .... choked ... a clown ... cock ... last night ... spaghetti" hehe) Tonight!  I go baseballing.  Mariners v.s. Oakland!  Me v.s. free hat giveway mob!  First 21,000?  Fuck that I want the first one period! (actually "I want the first one exclimation point?" Dammit.) It seems like there is something else. Work sucks and apparently I am Dumbo.  No one will hire me away from here!  When they read my resume they must go "Ah, yes, you have the solid background we are looking for, but you are also a cartoon elephant, we hate you, die, die, die." In the distance I hear a soccer mom laughing.  I know she watches "Touched by an Angel". I want to run away and grow a helicopter propeller out of my head and fly to a little island full of asian girls .... a little island full of my girlfriend and sip bourbon out of coconut shells and watch sunsets while I set of fireworks and chop with a machete, occasionally using my helicopter head to fly to the mainland for bologna, Miracle Whip, Anal Eaze, booze and funny pictures of monkeys doing man-like things.  I'll make up my own language and put out my own newspaper and then they'd have to hire me as at least an editor, because I'm the only one who knows the style guide of "The Larpy Toontit" like the back of my "winkle".   And I could do it, dorks, I just need to put the one foot in front of the other.  Run out the doors and through the parking lot, long jump over I-405 and the traffic, run Adidas run! But, I can't, I carpooled with the Hippie today and responsibility makes me sane. Later, dorks.

      Morning, dork nipples. First off, look at my links to your right.  Your right, dorknuts!  That's your foot!  Up, up, that's a bird!  Why are you outside with a computer!  Cave dork! There you go.  That political cartoon there is exactly like the joke I made at the begining of the week!  Dorks Don't Rock is so cutting edge I just cut my fucking finger off!  In fact, we're so razor sharp, suicide paitients aren't allowed to be near me without suppervision.  (It's now time for Brent Has a REALLY Good Idea and Then Runs It Into the Ground So Only He Finds It Amusing.) In fact, I'm so razorrific sharp edge shittful that I'm changing my name to Mach Brent 3 or even better, just call me Quatro. Yep, Quatro, that's my new name. "Hey, hey, Quatro, new Adidas, eh?" "Quatro is so hot I want to buy him chocolate milk!" "If Quatro was a dinosaur he'd have been a StegoQuatro Rex and he'd get all the dinosaur chicks and all the dinosaur gold." Join us next time when Brent thinks of a good idea for a Halloween costume. "A Lazer Ape!" This weekend R. Butt and I are going to house sit for this lady with a lot of cats.   The house is very Old Lonely Lady and therefore not much fun, unless maybe she has painkillers or those nitro pills .... Focus, don't reveal your desire for old people pills, you just did, shit, think of cover up, go with something like So, R. Franklin and I had a great idea.  When we get home from work this afternoon (that's get home respectively, dorks, I don't do office romance ayight?)  we are directly changing into pajamas!  I'm taking one t-shirt and one pair of boxers and that's it for the entire weekend.  I might even skip out on brushing, but that would not be good for my junks life so I will.   And don't forget to score old lady pills. But not the estrogen ones again, O.K.?  Last time I cried for a week. But your skin was softer and you did appreciate pink a lot more. And I finally understood "Dirty Dancing". Nobody Puts Brent In A Corner I'm typing to myself.  Now they won't even say the dead troops names on some news stations?   Who do you think is dying in this war, dorkneck dick lickers?  Last time I checked it's almost 800 dead PEOPLE, not dolls.  Girls play with dolls, people die in battles. "We Support Our What's-Their-Names."  Last night I had a horrible nightmare.  It started out with me watching the nightly news (Source:the position I'm up for, watching "The Daily Show" before bed). "That hummingbird in your backyard might not be a hummingbird after all..." "Shit." "It could actually be a flying snake-like creature that is nature's most deadly weapon." "Double Shit" So, I look outside and I notice an old woman sunbathing (an old home video from my childhood). Back on the T.V. ... "This unsuspecting woman thought the thousands of hummingbirds that had gathered in her backyard were awesome, until they attacked her." The flying snake birds (from yesterday's news story about the snakefish on the East Coast) attack the woman. "One bite from the birds is lethal.  Victims first show signs of the flu and then die within days. (zombie movies)" "I can't let them kill that woman! (Boy Scouts)" So I run outside and start attacking the snake-birds.  But once you attack one you attack them all (Playing Halo on XBox).  I was fighting off a thousand of them (Kill Bill), but they wouldn't die easily.  I had to crush then with objects lying around my yard AND avoid their jaws of venom (Wig Wolf)!  It was hard (porn). I had them down to the last two who I trapped in my dojo.  That's right, I had a dojo (Enter the Dragon). I was flipping and swinging and they were snapping and biting and I trapped one under a pillow.  I stepped on him and his venom sac exploded on my face. "I've been infected. (28 Days Later)" The last snake-bird was laughing at me. "A fool you were to risk your life for the old lady's." "A fool you were to be born." (Splinter in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles":  Death comes for us all, Oroku Saki, but something much worse comes for you. For when you die, it will be  [Shredder falls from the building and lands in the back of a garbage truck]  ... Without honor. ) Then I crushed him. I started to get sick and then .... woke up and peed (water, PBR).  That's it. Weekend, dorks.

      Wednesday to you, dorks.   It's quiet in the halls of the place that gives me money for porn.  Maybe the soccer moms are planning an attack.   Battlestations! A lady stopped me in the hall today, "Just so you know, my 22-year-old daughter fell off my scooter." "Oh yeah?  I once rode a bike off of a cliff and smacked my nuts on the handle bar when I landed.  So, who wins the stupid story contest, lady?" Actually, I just filed her babble-dabble under "Useless Stranger/Daughter Scooter Related Injuries" in my brain and went on my way. Not much of words back from place me want work.  Send e-smokesignals today as requested by chief, short word back thanking for pow-wow.  Not respond again, young brave not want seem pushy.  Brent, did you yell at a foreign person or a retarded person last night? Both.   I went to buy some beers at a gas station. This chick in front of me accidently dropped a bottle of girly smirnoff drink.   "I will pay for it," she said. "What happens, man?" said the unruly store clerk. Mumble, grumble, bumble (stopped paying attention for a few seconds because I noticed even NEWER flavors of Doritos!) Then... "You don't have to call me stupid!" said the girl. "What happens, man?"said clerk ass again. "Your boyfriend got the gas, outside the pump, go him," said retard. Girl walks out followed by clerk and jerk.  They seem to all have a little talk in the parking lot.   When they come back in I decide that the place is too weird and put the beer back.   "Sir, I help you!" "You guys are weird, I'm leaving." So, I get to the car and R. Waiting asks me "What the hell was going on in there?" I explain, she tells me that the guys were yelling at the girl in the parking lot while her boyfriend just sat there. "Hmmm," I thought, "I must really have been into those Doritos, because I missed all of that." Then I said, "Not while Batman is around!" "What?" said R. Huh. So, I marched back into the store and looked the clerk right in the eyes. "It's rude to yell at women," I let him know. Then I looked at old redneck retard. "Rude!" Then I left.  I am America's Boyfriend. Later, dorks, it's time for naps!

       ... we will be back in Fallujah. It will be at the time and place of our choosing. We will hunt down the criminals. -Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt  I don't think sealing off the roads and refusing to let families go home for weeks, advising "bad guys" to get out of town, have silly negotiations to get the enemies' weapons and then carpet bombing the shit out of an entire city is really  hunting "down the criminals. "Hey, Mark, where are you going this weekend?" "Well, Neil, I'm going hunting." "Have you sealed off all the entrances to the forest yet?" "Yep, I figure anything left in there come Saturday will be deer and not turtles or Iraqi children.  Plus, I've been in negotiations to get all of the deer to turn over their horns." "Are they complying?" "Doesn't really matter, does it, Neil?  Come Saturday morning I'm dropping bombs on Bambi! Hahahahahahaha!" "Hahahahahaha! Stupid deer!  Great white men!" "Fuel up my F-16! We got Iraqi venison to kill!"  "Hi, my name's Dick and for the 9/11 Commission Talent Show I'm going to have my puppet George here sing 'Toxic' by Britnney Spears while I drink this glass of cover-up ... I mean water. Right, George?" "I'm a fire hazard."  LET'S DORK!  Today I had an interview at Dream Job World.   "Brent," Kyle asked me, "what is your dream job?" "Cigarette-smoker Porn Watcher!" This place is almost that cool.  I find out soon if I got it. I'm whorish with anticipation.  Had a good-then-drunk-then-depressed-then-nappy weekend. Saturday night R. Throaty (who supposedly "had a rushed tonsil removal surgery" today, A.K.A. "Brent rules at excuses to sneak out for interviews"  "Brent, can you please lift this box to save the world?"  "I would, but my arms are full of worms."  "What?"  "And I fell asleep."  Back to ...) and I had people over to drink.  I met lots of cool new people.  I talked with tall and short people that I new (know), I drank lots of beer and vodka and touched R. booty. Then came Sunday. "Brent, we're a thrash metal band that is going to move into your body." "I say, what?" (Thrashing metalically in my head, stomach and soul) "YOU CAN'T RUN FROM THE DEVIL, HE PUTS HIS EVIL IN YOUR EYES AND BLEEDS OUT YOUR NOSE!" "Prozac take me away!" "THE DEVIL ATE YOUR PROZAC NEXT HE'LL EAT YOUR SOUL AND THEN YOUR FRIES FROM THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BURGER KING BAG!" "What?  He ate my bag fries?  What kind of Devil is this?" "HE'S A CONTRACT DEVIL WE HIRED HIM ON A TEMPORARY BASIS REALLY HE'S NOT THAT GOOD BUT WE'RE STILL GIVING HIM A CHANCE." "That's nice of you." "NO, IT'S EVIL!" "Oh, right, that's "evil" of you." "THANK YOU!  THRASH METAL RULES!" "Yes, it does Body Snatcher Band."  Hi, this is the part of Brent's brain that is not affected by cafeine and cable T.V.  We have taken over because Brent has slipped into a creative coma, He has again lost track of where he was going with one of his silly conversations, we will return him shortly when ...  I Lead Pipe you, Mother fuckers!  Ok, dorks, so I had a goodish weekend and last night I bought Aqua Teen Hunger Force on DVDish.  I can't wait to watch more of it!   Body Snatcher Band, play me out!  Later, dorks! "WELL, THE DEVIL DON'T LIKE YOUR GRANDMA AND HE DON'T LIKE SHOPPING NEITHER BECAUSE HE'S THE KING DARK DEVIL AND THE LORD OF THE NETHER ... WORLD!"

      More about "The Matrix" and my first ever thing about Shawn.  Shawn/Skills: So, what is the Matrix?  Isn't that the deal, noone knows what the Matrix is?  Is it a robot or something?  Me:Nope, it's like a dream world that machines made up so they can keep us locked up and use our bodies as batteries.  Shawn: What?  So, it's like they are doing this fighting in their sleep?  That's retarded, it's all imaginary! I can take on 200 guys in my mind!  (closes eyes) Look, there, BAM! I just beat up a thousand guys.   Words as true now as they were the day they were spoken, dorks.  Disney still sucks cock.

So, did you all have a nice little Cinco de Dorko?  I did, I made nachos for me and R. Amigo and then went to bed at 9:00.  Why?  Because I like nachos and I was tired. Other things happening?  I don't know, maybe.  This has been passive week for me.  I'm totally phoning this one in.  "Brent, we have a bit of a concern about ..." "Do I want a cream cheese bagel or an egg and bacon bagel?" "Um, what?  We are concerned about ..." "Yep, decisions are hard sometimes." "Will you ..." "Hold on, start from the begining." "We have a bit of a concern ..." "No, from the begining of time!  Act out Genesis for me!"  We had pot roast and a walk with the Lovely Couple the other lovely night.  That was nice, thems peoples can cook.  Shoooo-eee I tells ya, and they sho got tables manners!  I was slopping up like a hog in Heaven, but theys all "Use the fork and use the knife/That way dinner's extra nice."   Earlier that day R.

"Yes, lots of people." "And carve swastikas into our skull." "Yes, WigWolf, yes!"  Later, dorks.  Disney sucks cock!

      Maria Shriver has made Pat Tillman speak from the grave.  The ventriloquist lives, the dead are silent heroes pushed into eternal rotting iconic roles!           Shriver said Tillman epitomized the message her uncle, John F. Kennedy, delivered in his presidential inauguration 43 years ago.        ``My uncle once said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.' You, Pat, have lived those words,'' she said.   Dorks, dorks, dorks!  J.F.Mutha Kickin'K. said those words so America's youth would HELP the people of the world through organizations like the Peace Corps!  He wasn't saying join the Army and get shot while shooting people! I don't remember the quote going "Ask not who your country can shoot for you but who you can stack into a homoerotic Iraqi-prisoner pyramid for your country."  "Ah, duh-er, we don't want no gays in the military and them homos shouldn't be getting ah-huh-der married in Oregon-io ... he-he, look, Pippytits, two Iraqi dudes all tied up and such.  Let's make them jerk off into each others mouths, them stupid homos."  And it happened and people die and homos hate and people lie and Haliburton and Daddy too get richer and you boo hoo hoo and quote the dead and make them praise any flag you'd like to raise.  Did all of you pretty little dorks remember to buy your mother a present for this weekend?  I did, I did! I made her a card that goes as such in crayon: Outside:(A picture of my mom dressed in a superman costume with a giant "M" instead of an "S" with " You are a Super Mom.  Inside: (SuperMom flying towards a T-Rex that has razor fingers and shooting fire out of its mouth!) Now kill that T-Rex and save THE WORLD!  Happy Mother's Day!  Love,Brent Other things are busy.  I have officially been offered my job as a permanent position. "You're officially unofficial," said R. Emembers. She reads, she remembers!  Meat and New Balances sing the praise of a fan and girlfriend rolled into one! I need to go pee in a cup now, dorks. And then I might go to my drug screening.  Later, dorks.

      Hello, dorks. Are you glad it's Friday?  I know someone who is! Me?  Nope ... Well, yes ... But someone else! It's Weekend Delivery Man!  Monday: "I can't wait for the weekend." Tuesday: "One down, 4 to go!" Wednesday: "Almost there!" Thursday: "Feels like Friday to me.  Does that count?" Friday: "Didn't think it'd ever get here."  Our entire relationship is based on how many days there are until the weekend.  I fear that one weekend I'll run into him at the porn store or the museum and it will be awkward. "Can't wait for the ... just one ... three ... the wife said .... my doctor ... the weather." It's quite possible that me seeing this man on the weekend could rip the universe in half.  Or maybe it isn't, who knows?  We need billions more dollars to fund Iraq?  I thought we planned to be out by June 30th!  Here's a startling math fact for you (which I figured out by the way, thank you internet and BrentBrain4000)... If we funded the bare minimum of 2 billion dollars (the minimal plural ammount) and we leave Iraq on June 30th that will be an average daily (excluding today) spending of $42,553,191.  That comes out to being $0.15 per U.S. Citizen per day.  For less than the price of a cup of coffee you can kill a child in Fallujah.    Amazing!  So, this weekend I will do nothing.  Well, tonight I shop for breakfast sausage and dinosaur nuggets, but then I'm retiring to my XBox.  I rented RedDeadRevolver.  It's O.K.   I watched the final showdown scene from "The Good,The Bad and The Ugly" to get myself pumped for the game.  That is without a doubt my most favorite movie sequence ever!   A close second is when those lesbians made out during "Raiders of the Lost Ark".  Oh, you missed that scene?  That's because you don't have Brent-Imagi-Vision!    Howdy!    I should probably go work ... nope. Weekend, dorks!

      Hello, dorks!  Welcome to the revampired Dorks Do Not Rock!  What they "Don't"?  That's right, they don't! As you can tell, this page is now blue, which is the color of my shirt and jeans.  Coincidence?  Maybe, I'll never tell.  It'll go down in history as one of the great mysteries, like why was Paul Bunyan so tall and who really built Big Ben? (pssst, it was the British) You can also leave me comments now.  I was wary of doing this, because I really fear that some dorks are going to leave stupid things.  No stupid things!  What's stupid?  Well, anything that isn't perfectly written or doesn't make me want to scream "switchblade" and/or laugh.   Feel free to leave your phone number so other dorkreaders can call you for phone sex. Not me though, me no call.  Me have girl who curls red. R. Esponsible had to work at the place where the save kids last night.  So, I had the whole place to myself.  I beat Halo, had a burrito, a few beers, tried to watch T.V. .... and then I was freakin' bored out of my skull. I paced. I looked at DVDs (didn't watch, just looked at them.  I have a problem now that when I go to watch one my DVDs the movie plays through my head very quickly and I feel like watching it will be a waste of time ... plus all the girls can be naked in my imaga-movie!) I paced. I tried to decide between peanuts and chips. I ate chips. Contemplated whether my decision was the right one. Ate more chips. Paced in front of the peanuts. Settled on the chips. Went to bed.  This is what I do when I'm alone.  I pace and eat chips and think about peanuts.  Ask anyone who has lived with me, although they weren't with me when I was alone (because I was alone) they know my pace habits.  I walk around, complain about boredom and not knowing what to do and then go to bed.  I really missed R. Gone too, dorks.  Calm down, shitdorks!  You aren't getting ooh-ahh-fodder out of me.  It's just that last night was the first night I had to sleep alone at our place.  It was kind of not as sad as you think but sadder than dropping a candy bar into gravel. All of the plastic trinkets and girly things that I complain about cramping my style reminded me of R. Nots.  I started to like them because they were part of her and I was there and she wasn't but her stuff was.  So ... I now love the plastic piggy bank!  The rainbow flowerpot is A-OK!   Hula man and pink pillow welcome to my world of love and understanding!    Ooooh Aaaah Dooooorks!  "Why do you always chop off my head after I kill your kid?" Are you angry yet, dorks?  Are you angry at the right people?   Vooooooooote!  Nervous to let you silly dorks tell me if my website works and talk about what I write about girls butts and why we fight.  Later, dorkarinas!

      "My name is Nick Berg, my father's name is Michael, my mother's name is Susan.  I have a brother and sister, David and Sarah. I live in ... Philadelphia."   "For the mothers and wives of American soldiers, we tell you that we offered the U.S. administration to exchange this hostage with some of the detainees in Abu Ghraib and they refused .... So we tell you that the dignity of the Muslim men and women in Abu Ghraib and others is not redeemed except by blood and souls. You will not receive anything from us but coffins after coffins ... slaughtered in this way."    And, yes!  Where the fuck are the mothers of America?  Your sons heads are rolling!  You will never receive handmade ashtrays like you did on Sunday!   There is no patriotism dying for Haliburton, Moms!  There are no heroics in having your head chopped off over a dick-measuring contest, Moms!  Your son could fight fires in California and still come home to you and pie.  He could teach P.E. or someone to read and make more of a difference!   Revolt, Mothers, revolt!  Revolt against the puppets and the killers!   And you, dorks, you see through the hype.  This execution was avoidable.  Anyone called to arms over it is being turned on like a robot.  Turn yourself off! Take out your patriotic Duracell! Fight fires!  Teach!   Dammit, dorks, dammit!!!!!!!!

      Morning and hopefully happy not-being dead to you, dorks.  If you have become a zombie and are reading this then shitty for you.  Shitty indeed. I have missed you all, dorkles.  I really did.  I'm sorry I didn't call like I said I would, you are still the prettiest dork I've ever seen.  No, I'm not just saying that.   Me and the L.C. and the R.Gee went and saw the Super Size Me movie on Sunday.  I'm done with McDonalds, dorks.  Done with McDonalds for life.    And this isn't like when I swore I wasn't going to use the Mach 3 because of rising prices.  Sunday: That's it!  Those arogant bastards can eat my ass!  I'm going back to the pre-Mach 3 days!  Monday: Oooo, I do get such a smooth ball shave.  Kiss me Mach 3!  (I tongue a razor)  The blood!   I will never kiss a razor again!  Tuesday: Damn, Mach 3 have you been working out?  (Tongue the razor again)  Aaaaaaaaa!  My promise broken!  The world falling apart like tongue does too!  I will never break a promise to myself again!  Wednesday: Well, I guess it's O.K. to punch just one wheelchair-bound geriatric when no-one's looking.  (Punch an old guy)  Hooooeee, I missed that!  What fun!  Why'd I promise I'd never do that again?    I'll never make promises again!  Thursday:  I promise, it won't hurt.  (It hurt)  Dammit, I'll never suggest new things again!  Friday:  Hey, who wants to throw rotten fruit at the homeless and see if they eat it? (I do it.) They ate it!  I'll never doubt a homeless man again!  Saturday: Bullshit! You can't beat Slinky Boxcar in a shiv fight, Hobo Bob!  It's suicide!  And that has been a waffling week in the life of Brent! Back to life, back to reality, back to the hear and noooow-ow-ow. So, I'm done with fast food.  I must regain my healthy 16-year-old physique so I can be a strong warrior when the rapture comes ... so I can look good at the beach.  Cows: "Yippeeee!" Potatoes: "Spuderific!" Whatever they make the vanilla ice cream out of: "Glurp!" McDonalds Exec: "Our profits are down 21%!"  Other news might include that I'm close to beating Halo and therefore have put my love life in jeopardy. In Jeopardy. "I'll take "XBox = No Box" for 500, Alex." "Upon reaching level nine of Halo this unshaven ex-frat boy forgot that his hot girlfriend had a lovely rack AND a softball game he promised to attend." "Who is Brent Kinkade?" "Correct ... however, in his defense, Brent did remember to tape the final episode of Friends for R. Luckiest Girl In The World." "And unload the diswasher!"  Did anyone else watch Friends finale done gone bye?  I did.  Why are they so zany?  I stopped watching about 4 seasons ago when they kept sleeping with each other and everyone had a secret or was pregnant. "Don't tell Monica that Chandler has shrapnel in his brain because he's afraid it will cause her to sleep with Joey and then have Ross' baby who is actually Phoebe in a fetus costume that Rachel stole from Ralph Lauren!" "Hmm, I'm going to go eat lots of McDonalds instead of watching this."  R. Campy and I bought a new tent last night.  It is very big!  We set it up while watching "The Swan" my sort of new favorite not-liked show. Want to her something that sounds like it'd be a good compliment but isn't? "Baby, you're the swan."   Yeah, girls don't like to hear that.  You know what I don't like to hear?  That you are a lazy stupid dork, you dork!  Why hasn't President Bush's approval rating fallen to Negative 2000 %?  Why?  Because that isn't a real percentage?  Or is it because you have cotton in your dumb dork ears?  Or maybe it's because you are a stupid hippy-Democrat instead of a me-hit-rubberhead-Democrat?  Maybe you should stop crying in your polluted rivers and get a little more final-scene-of-Robocop! President Bush has maimed you and made you into that hideous man/machine who has been isolated from the love of your family and the compassion of society!  There he is in that pile of toxic waste!  He's melting, oozing his sludge guts!  Now's the time! Run him down, MurphyDork! Last week was prime go-for-the-jugular week and Kerry and all of us passed it up.  Your comander in chief (who is more in charge of the war than Bumsfeld!) had soldiers sexually and physically assaulting people in a foreign land ... WHO WEREN'T EVEN OUR ENEMY!  We declared Sadam's loyalists our enemies, not Everyday Joe Iraqi!  The Red Cross says that as many as 90% of the prisoners were falsely imprisoned!  That's 90% of them dressed up as women and jerking off into each others mouths because our troops had run out of inocent people to kill!   DOES AMERICA NOT READ? Then President Bush AND Rumslick himself said it might be a good idea for him to resign!  Then Cheney calls him the best Defense Secretary ever?  All of a sudden everyone is backing Rum/Cheney again. "Um, George no like Donald." "Yes he does." "Yes George like Donald.  George president.  George use phone!" "Yes, George is a big boy." Arrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhh!  When will the homoerotic slaying of children end so we can all get back to a good economy and nude girls surfing?   When, dorks, when?  Other than that, things are good.  Not much else to say, zombie dorks.  Behind you!

      My job is ...  5 minutes ago, singing in my head: Bite down through the wire, ya-ya la the fire.  Ya da da, da da ooooh yeah ... dum dum da, I use two lifelines ... OH SHIT! WigWolf at 9:00! Evade! Evade! She's on our 6! ((side note: You know that scene at the end of "The Neverending Story" when Atray... um, the injun meets the wolf of the nothing thing ... WigWolf is starting to look like that, which is to say Hot as Balls)) Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot ... she's going to talk to us ... we can't have her talk to the precious Brent ... left foot, right foot ... dammit left foot keep up!  Too Late! Abandon foot, abandon foot!  Past the front desk and to the elevator, focus, focus ...  Jersey Hair: (At the front desk, covering for ManFace since she quit) There you are, you were supposed to be up here at 2:00.  (I smell foxy boxing!)  WigWolf: I was going to but then my father, you know The Dark Snake Prince, called and asked me to fetech the blood of bunnies and Straight-A students.  Jersey Hair: Well, I had to cover for you and now Blondie is here to cover for me. (Uh-oh)  WigWolf: I smite my lateness, but ..  Jersey Hair: Too late, you were supposed to be here.  Thanks again for being a real team player. (Oooooo)  (WigWolf turns into a mist of smoke and fades away into the air ducts ... and hopefully history.  I run for the elevator before she gains enough strength to return.)  Yippee Jersey Hair, the revolt of the human heads has begun!  Beware ye heads of rubber, your day is numbered.  Surely within a fortnight's hence ... Ah, fuck that, I ran out of fancy sounding words. Anyways, this might be a lame job, but it has it's moments.  Then again, there's never a lame moment when cat fightin' is involved. Meow, weekend and down with the rubber heads, dorks!

      From CNN.com: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi Governing Council member Ahmed Chalabi said a raid on his compound Thursday was engineered by Baathists who control the Iraqi police and who are now protected by the Coalition Provisional Authority.  Arrrrggghh, dorks, Arrrggggh! Why the hell are the Baathists raiding anything in Iraq, dorks?  Who are the Baathists, you say? READ!  READ!  Oh, they're just this little group that used to be headed up by a guy named Sadaam Fucking Hussein.  What the hell is going on over there? We invade Iraq and declare Sadaams loyalists to be our enemies.  Why?  Because they weren't behind 9/11 and they don't have WMDs.  That good enough for you, you un-American prickhole?  Buy a flag and shut up! O.K., so we aren't attacking Iraq, we are attacking it's "evil" government. Then we kill some babies and bomb a wedding. (http://apnews.myway.com/article/20040519/D82LPPNO0.html) Don't worry, it was a gay Iraqi baby wedding. Ain't noone alive to bomb the SuperBowl. Now we are supporting raids by SADAAM HUSSEIN'S FORMER MILITANT PARTY?  These are the people who would shoot you if you couldn't guess how many fingers were behind their backs!   I know a guy who knows a guy who's sister's husband was a Baathist and you know what?  Horns.  He had horns. Who the hell are we fighting over there? We have seriously run out of kids to kill and people to force into homoerotic poses.  We have actually sided WITH OUR ENEMY TO TAKE ON ... um, people who don't believe in naked Iraqi pyramids ... I mean Democracy.  But, don't worry, because I know what's going on in Iraq. A monkey with some dice is running the war. Crazy? Yes.  True? Yes. Think about it, dorks. Only a monkey with some dice could come up with a plan to invade the wrong country, kill children, bomb weddings and then a year later support our enemy to fight .... our enemy? "What's it going to be today General Bongles?" "Ooh-Aaaaaaaaaah, Uh, Uh, Uh." "That's it, men, General Bongles has rolled an 11.  That means all-out nuclear war against Spain and bananna splits for all of us."  When you put your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment before was your best bananna split, you'll know what to do.   I had a nice day off, dorks.  I tended to R. Sickly post-tonsilictamoyoney67yey.  That meant pudding and oxycontin.  For her we had ... hahahahahaha, just kidding, dorks. I laid around and watched movies and ate sandwiches.  I like getting paid for someone else being sick.  It's a sick day without all the sickness!   "Can you please ..." "Sorry, R. Baby is sick and by dating default I'm as useless as her." "Would you like to ..." "...watch T.V. and not do anything? Yes.  Anything else? No!"  And what did I return to?  WigWolf mayhem?  No, this time it was "Crumble Cheeks" (aka "What's a folder" Lady)  _____________________________________________  From: 	Crumble Cheeks Subject:	Training Boxes/// Importance:	High  (Brent) delivered boxes to the attention of (people) to me 1st floor Training Room.

I can always count on you to turn a simple situation ("Hey where's that box?") into a 17-alarm fire ("The box is full of Anthrax!" "No, it's not" "It's not a box?" "No, full of anthrax."

      Howdy!  Are you smirksome, dork?  Then let's go! I had me a weekend full of nothing.  An empty weekend.  I bought groceries and then said to myself, "Yep, that oughta 'bout do it for this weekend." And it did.  Wig Wolf's best friend, Man Face, quit today. I swear I heard a howl in the distance. Wig Wolf was sad today.  I found her in the lunch room eating only 2 newborn kittens for a snack instead of her regular 35. "Oh, WigWolf, are you sad." "Yes, and the strength fresh kitten meat usually gives me is fleeting today.  It hurts right here." "Your heart?" "For you mortal hu-mans it would be a heart, but for me, a child of The Fearsome Lord FireDeath, it is a steaming lump of Hell coal." "I know what it's like to have a broken heart, WigWolf." "Steaming lump of Hell coal." "Right."  I'm just joshing, dorks.  I haven't seen WigWolf in almost a week.  I'll relate to you the way I did to Kyle me and WigWolf's last meeting. "Maybe we should have the authority to (do what it is you do)." "Are you saying you think my job shouldn't exist?" "No, no, no .... I'm just." (At this point I stop talking to her and walk into a supplies closet at the back of my office and hide in a corner until she is gone.)  Maybe my job shouldn't exist, but it's my job!  That works!  If I don't have my job then you dorks are un-American!  Hmmm?   New paragraph. I went over to the Lovely Couples for lunch today.  Jack made fancy pizzas.   Pizza #1: Yummy dough, cripsed potatoes, some wine sauce, chicken, angel smiles and puppy souls. Pizza #2: Wheat dough, dijon sauce, carmalized onions, chicken, spinach, Heaven rain drops.  They were good. Over lunch the L.C. reminded me of a show I want to produce.  It's called "Beauties and the Beast".  The premise is that 5 or so women go and get makeovers like on "The Swan".  EXCEPT one girl gets a fucked up makeover.  They make her look like a monster with scales and horns and bugeyes and a hook coming out of her head.  The girls have to stay bandaged up for months and are finally allowed to see themselves. That would be the most awesome show ever in the history of the world.  Could you just imagine some really fucked up looking girl with hunchback and blue skin and one of those robotic throat boxes.  That would be awesome!!!!!!!!  And she'd have to have two mouths and a pig nose!  Hahahahahahahaha, the humor! I had lunch with the L.C. because they are going to Atlanta tomorrow.  So, me and R. Wonderful are going to house/dog sit while they are gone.  Mixed peanuts jar here I come!  And hey!  Way to go on getting Bushes approval rating down, dorks!  I knew you had it in you!  What else you got in there?  Any porn?   I paid $2.35 for a gallon of gas on Friday.   Keep up the good "Bush-bashing" work, Demodorks and Intelligent Republicans!  I need to go swimming or play frisbee golf after work today.  I have been sucked into my XBox and feel like a fatty due to lack of anything physical the past few days. I take a few steps and it's nap time! Look out supplies closet here I come!

      It's 8:36 in the morning and I've run out of things to do. I've been up since 5:30 this morning, dorks.   Just last year I would go to bed at that time.  What have I become?    My father, Brent Sr., wakes up with the sun. "Cock-a-fucking-do," says Brent Jr. Brent Sr. now has to wear hearing aids at the age of, um, 52ish.  He blames it on rock 'n' roll and woodworking.   "I'm sorry, R. Mumbles, could you repeat what you just said?  I wasn't facing you while you were speaking and someone is playing a radio in Texas.  Hard for me to hear you with all of those distractions," says Brent Jr. Brent Sr. has the paitience of a "rabid wolf" (to quote my ma). "Once upon a time ... fuck this," says Brent Jr. Brent Sr. has the memory of a dead elephant. "I'm out of food and toothpaste.  Let's go to Kidco," says Brent Jr. "You mean Winco?" says R. Girl-I'm-Pretty-Sure-I've-Been-Dating-For-Almost-A-Year. "Yep, Spifco.  Let me brush my teeth first," says who?   I have Monday off, that means if I can just play Statue game for 7 hrs. and 15 mins.  I have a three day reward and a paycheck waiting for me. Statue Game comencement in  10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

      Two voice notes left by yours truly on yours truly's cell phone.  5:16 p.m. 5/24/04 "1 cross + 3 Nails = 4given .... huh-huh-ha" (From a bumper sticker seen on the way home.)  1:05 a.m. 5/25/04 "The mullet joke is not funny anymore."  (A truth discovered while P.B.R. influenced.  And really it isn't, dorks.  A dork who says, "Look a mullet" is really saying "Look, my dorkhead is full of Jello".  A mullet joke is on the same level as a Monica Lewinsky joke now ... move on!  The next big joke?  Chicken legs! (on humans))  If it's not the sun that gets you done or great white sharks that stop your heart or killer bees, or mad cow disease, or sarrin gas, or S-A-R-S, then don't you dread you'll still be dead before summer's through they'll still get you. The terrorists, says Uncle Sam have a scary summer plan to murder and kill and poison and shoot, maybe an explosion thrown in to boot! So run, hide and cover your head. Scream and cry 'til you see red. And don't ask "Why?" "When?" or "Who?" Cause Big Brother ... 'Cause Uncle Sam is there for you.

      Correspondence from a letter briefly glanced over at the office today. "I faxed her a check but then never heard from her again."  Maybe next time you should e-mail the check, Rubberhead.  After that why don't you text message me a sandwich.  From cnn.com Bush outlined five broad steps to restore Iraqi sovereignty and get the country back on its feet:  *	Handing over authority to a sovereign Iraqi government. *	Establishing security. *	Continuing to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. *	Encouraging more international support. *	Moving toward a national election in Iraq that "will bring forward new leaders empowered by the Iraqi people."  From dorksdontrock Brent outlined five specific steps to stop killing Iraqi women and babies.  *Hand over authority to people who we won't turn around and kill/overthrow/raid/carbomb/naked pyramid stack/humiliate/intimidate in 5 years ... or days.  Then bring the troops home for a game of softball, some pie, whores and crank. *Establish security by not bombing any more mosques or forcing Iraqis to jerk off in each others mouths. *Avoid the labor and costs of rebuilding with a simple "no carpet bombing" policy. *Encourage more international support for more naked Janet Jackson!   *Move toward a national election in America that "will bring forward a new leader elected by the American people".  Bye, dorks!

      Good afternoon, dorks.  It's such a nice day in Seattle that I feel I should be running through a sprinkler or making out in a corn field. Instead I have to have inane office conversations, which I am no good at, by the way. There is something in-born in every beurodork and republican that allows them to chat mindlessly about things that I have never and will never care about.   Example? Example away! The following is word-for-word ver-fucking-batim a conversation I had today.  "Hey, how's it going, Person?" "Hi, Brent.  Well, it's going." "Well, that's a good way for it to ... move."  I sound like a gooddamned mentally exploded caveman when I try to small talk.  "Sure can't wait for Friday to get here." "Me either." "Weekend never seems to get here fast enough." "Hmmm, racecars go fast though." "Yes they do, Brent" "Yep, Person."  R. Baby and I went to a wedding this past weekend.  Which wedding?  Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, dorks. (A rubberhead just walked into my office and threw trash into my garbage can without even talking to me.  Rude? Nope, Rubberheadish.  Word of my exploded caveman brain must be spreading.) Back to the wedding.  R. Extra's review of the said wedding?  "Borderline white trash". Indeed, dimple angels, indeed indeed. I wore a suit, no tie and was worried that I would be under dressed.  I wasn't thanks to "These my Sunday denims" Guy and "T'aint No One Telling Me My Kid Can't Wear His Barney T-Shirt" Woman. More specifics? A conversation related to me that R. Girl had with the bride's mother.  R. Girl: Hi, Mother Person, remember me?  Mother: Wait, don't tell me ... are you with the groom's side or the bride's side.  R.: The bride's side.  Mother: Hmm, then who are you representing?  R.: Um ... your daughter.  Mother: Oh, you're R. Girl!  The woman forgot if her daughter was the groom or the bride!  I once forgot what Fruit Loops tasted like.  I was drunk. I was also drunk at the wedding. "Wheeeeeeeeeee ... people I don't know AND free beer?  Recipe for disaster!  A disaster lasagna in the making!" But I was ordered to be on my best behavior. "Don't be dumb," R. Bossy ordered. I listened.  Stupid society and your rules. We left early because R. Throaty's throat got re-sore thanks to the tonsilectamony-mony.  R. Baby's throat saves me again!   Hip-hip-hooray!  And now's the time we say goodbye But frown no not and please don't cry. And tonight, dork, when you watch T.V. And see a message from the G.O.P. Via your prez (that's good ol' George) Remember it's O.K. to yawn and be bored. And if you see through all the hype,  The Season Finale of "The Swan" is on Fox tonight.  Fight the powers that be, dorks!

      A story written by my friend Eva "Goldfinger" Moore has inspired me to get a bike.   I found a guy who's selling one for $25. My life just got 3,000 times better.  I wish all you dorks could see Seattle today! Weekend!

      Fifteen minutes ago.  The phone goes ring, ring.  I answer. "This is Brent." "Brent, do you have any of those big envelopes?  Not the skinny ones, the ones that are big," says Crumble Cheeks. "Yep." "Could you please bring me some?" "Yep." I Grab a handful of the envelopes and head to her office.  This is the same Rubberhead who was baffled by how a folder works until I opened it up for her. I am silently chanting "I know something stupid is going to happen.  I know something stupid is going to happen" as I enter the office. "Here you go." "No, these aren't them.   I need the big ones." Silence. I take the top envelope off the stack I have brought up.  I open it. "Oh, OK, that's better.  My stuff can fit in there now."  Rubberheads, dorks, my life is full of Rubberheads.

      From the Tri-Valley Herald: Condoleezza Rice insists that (Bush) will one day rank alongside such towering pillars of 20th century statecraft as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.  "When you think of statesmen, you think of ... people like Roosevelt, people like Churchill, and people like Truman...And this president has been an agent of ... historic change for the better."  Repetition does not transform a lie into truth.         -Franklin D. Roosevelt  Never in the face of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few. - Winston Churchill  Humility is to make a right estimate of oneself. -Harry Truman  I know that human being and fish can coexist peacefully. -George W. Bush  Well, maybe he can rank with Aquaman and Dr. Doolittle.  A small glimpse into my life .... 3:30 a.m. this morning Riding a dinosaur, chasing robots, is that Michael Keaton? Yippee boobies and my childhood home ... Suddenly! I wake up on the floor of my bedroom. "What the hell?  How'd I get down here?" R. Sleepy waking up, "Mmmm, you woke up around midnight and started bumping into things and then grabbed a pillow, fell down there and went to bed." "Why?" "I don't know.  I asked you and you just said, 'I don't know what I'm doing'." Crawling back into bed, "The life I lead."  Have a good one, dorks.

      I woke up late today ... It's time for Morning Math! Current time (x) added to estimated time of shower (y) multiplied by the average number of backups on I-405 (z) over the ammount of words I'll have to use to explain to my hippie carpool partner why I'm late (a) = haul ass!  Made it! "Sorry I'm late."  "Yeah, you know, it's really hard to judge if you're going to make it, I mean you really need to know if you really know the other person, like if they are going to stay or if they are going to go ahead.  I mean I'm on time because the kids had a game yesterday and they were tired so I could go to bed, but I'm worried that their real mother is not taking care of business, and so ...."  (Fading out.  Inner toughts taking over ...) "Taking care of business? ... la da da if my train's on time I can be at work by nine. Start your yah-yah job and get your pay.  Hmmm- da second hand guitar  hmmm-da ... you'll go far if you get in with the right group of fellows.  ... 'Cause we been taking care of business, EVERYDAY. And we been taking care of business EVERYWAY.  We've been taking care of business ... hmmm landmine.  We be taking care of business and working overtime.  Work out.  Dadadadadadaa DA DA"   "...so I told him that pudding shouldn't be gray.  Can you believe that?"  "Nope."  Nice save, brain. Have a good day, dorks.

      Welcome back, Me. I didn't Memorialize too much yesterday. I'm feeling sick.  Between R. Streppy, the L.C.'s dogs, a Rubberhead carnival last week and shopping at every freakin' sporting goods store in Seattle to find a decent sleeping bag I am exhausted.  Exhaustion + Mac & Cheese/Natural Ice diet = ... too worn out for algebra right now, dorks. I'm clammy, crabby and sluggish.  I'm virtually made of molluscs!   Cheerful! This weekend included: -One of my birthday presents for R. Adult (June 18th, if you are present-inclined) was tickets to Mitch Hedberg on Saturday night.  He is our comedian-in-common.  Our movie-in-common is "Malibu's Most Wanted". Mitch jokes not heard before concert: "I flew over an island and saw S-O-S written very big.  I yelled out 'Stop! Those people have dirty pans'" and "I had an infestation of Koala bears ... I turned on my lights and Koala bears scattered everywhere ... Do not hide behind the toaster, you are too big to fit back there. Plus you are cute and I want to pet you."  -Shopping and disc golf with the Lovely Couple Saturday morning.  We bought chicken then took a nap.  If that don't say rock 'n' roll you can eat my ass, dorks!  Why do I yell?  -Shrek 2 in the theater with R. Girl. It was pointed out to me that I started squirming like all of the toddlers halfway through the movie. "I'm tired." "Shh, we'll get ice ..." "Look! Shrek!"  -Bubba Ho-Tep on DVD Sunday night.  What would happen if Elvis had lived and then joined forces with J.F.K. (who is now Ossie Davis-like) to fight a mummy in a Texas retirement home? This movie. 14 tubs of popcorn out of 15!  A must-see ... if you are sick of history and mummy attacks not correlating!  Another voice-note left by me (Heavily Keystone Light influenced) 2:29am 5/31/04: "Now you can eat Dorritos ... Fritos, whatever, no matter what you're doing ..." For some reason I thought this was an important topic to write about.  It's magnitude escapes me now ... oh, wait, I can eat them ANYWHERE?!?!!?  Even while playing SOCCER?!?!!? Miracle of miracles!  I see the glory!  Hehe.  Memory! What I bragged to my buddy Kurtis I was going to tell this chick after I ditched her (circa. 1997): "Truly thou art the fling of flings." Oh, Past Me, what ribald jest!  From cnn: "Bush praises Iraqi interim government ... blasts kill 14, including 3 near 'Green Zone' "  "And your president will be Bob. (Ka-Boom) Your president will be Carl."  I'm reading "Power and Terror: Post-9/11 Talks and Interviews" sort-of by Noam Chomsky (it's pretty much the transcript of the related movie from what I gather). Very good, Ameridork. 15 out of 15 tubs of popcorn.  Hmmm, done.

      WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - A food fight that started with fruit cup turned into a mealtime melee, serving up a full plate of arrests and injuries ... Three girls and fours boys ranging in age from 12 to 14 were  urlLink arrested   on charges including breach of peace, assault and inciting a riot.   Seriously? What's next? Speeding tickets for Big Wheels?  Background checks for Cabage Patch Kids?  I started a foodfight at  urlLink  Crooked Lake Elementary School   in Andover, MN when I was a wee hipster.  It remains one of the proudest moments of my life.  I can still see the potatoes flying, the chicken nuggets pelting innocent first graders and wounded students covered in ketchup screaming "Where is God?" Please, let us have our country back soccer moms and NASCAR dads!  Zealots and Rubberheads let our children go!  I signed up for an  urlLink  adult kickball league   yesterday. AND the dentist told me I had "fairly good" teeth today!   So, on that note ... Candy for all! I brought enough for everybody! Weekend, dorks.

Brent,  Please stop making fun of us and letting people know that we exist. You are really screwing up our plans for world domination. Thanks.   -President McRubber of the Rubberhead Foundation>>  Incriminating evidence!  They exist!  It's like finding out Santa is real ... and really, really stupid. I wrote back!   From: ME!

Your plan to take over the world by "finding a big stick" and "hitting the Universe Emperor while he's asleep" needs a little work. Keep up the horrible, horrible work! Love, Brent>>  But, it wouldn't be a Rubberhead story if all went right, right? So ... The message bounced back to me.  The rubberhead's e-mail address didn't exist.  Leave it to a rubberhead to send an e-mail from an account that doesn't exist!  Dorks beware!

      Just so you know that my life isn't all West Nile Virus and XBox ....  Last night R. Honey and I watched the last minutes of the sunset from a large piece of driftwood on Alki Beach.  The sun saying "Goodnight, all" on our left and the Space Needle blinking on the right. I had mint chocolate chip.  R. Girl had rainbow sherbert. We both had sugar cones.

      Head pounding. Head pounding. Head pounding.   "So, are you FEELING BETTER? I mean, have you made HEALTH PROGRESS?"  Oh, carpool lady can't you see my head beating like a drum?  That's not normal!  "Yes, I feel better," I say softly .... slowly ...   "What was it?  THE FLU? Did you HAVE THE FLU?"  My brain just fell into my lap, lady.  Couldn't have anything to do with your Bose speaker lungs, could it?  "Yes, I think so," I say smoothly ...  "You know you really SHOULD BE CAREFUL.  I've read reports that THE WEST NILE VIRUS has been detected in King County again.  It starts LIKE THE FLU.  You know THE SYMPTOMS.  My friend in college had it and you know she GAINED SOME SEVERE LEARNING disabilities because it caused her BRAIN TO DECAY."  It's 7:30 on a Wednesday morning and I might have some Egyptian Death Flu.   Well, at least Speaker Lungs has already blasted my brain out of my head before it can decay and turn me into some carpooling mummy.  "The kids ATE TOAST this morning."

      I return to the rubberhead factory today after stomach flu yesterday. "I had that a couple of weeks ago," says WigWolf, "It gave me ... the runs." Hell Spawn!  I vomit more!   I avoid using words like 'vomit' 'diarrhea' 'puke' 'the runs' 'Reagan' and 'vinyl' when talking out loud. Be like me, rubberheads!  I fell into a bit of a coma this weekend and when I come out ... Reagan's dead.  Hm. Bush has got himself some lawyers lined up.  Hmm. This quote came out: "This administration rejects torture."  Hmmm. But then they talk about The Torture Act. Hmmmm.  I am once again going to explain current Washington politics to you dorks by using fast food examples ... namely hamburgers equal torture.  "Mr. President, some of our troops are eating hamburgers," said John Ashcroft. "Hamburgers? Are we against that?" ased Bush Jr. "We should be.  Let's make a Hamburger Act outlining when it is right for us to eat hamburgers, when to eat them and how high the ketchup to mustard ratio should be (1:2) and then we'll say we are against Hamburgers," said John Ashcroft. "Does that mean we are going to stop eating hamburgers?" ased Lil' Bush. "Hell no.  But if anyone asks we aren't responsible for the Hamburger Act.  Just the Yippee Jesus Act and the Boo Homos Act .. all other acts are mysteries," said Ashy-Washy. "I'm confused," said Bushbo. "It works!  Bush White House Mumble works again!" said Assfingerer. "I like pickles," said Bushy Boy gleefully. "We know you do, kiddo," said Ashcroft.  Oh, it's so silly. Silly, dorks.  From cnn.com ("Worldwide leader in sucking White House balls") MTV plans to edit out a shot of (Eminem) exposing his rear end to the audience at the 2004 Movie Awards when the show is broadcast Thursday.  My name is what, my name is who, my name is what, chicka-chicka Slim Played Out. If I want sexism, violence, racial stereotypes and homophobia I'll just listen to a White House Press Conference instead of the guy who TRIED TO BEAT UP TRIUMPH THE INSULT COMIC DOG!  That's it! I'm moving to Mars, dorks.

      Did anyone else notice how quickly the major news outlets dropped the "9/11 Commission Finds No Iraq/Al Queda Link" story?  Don't you think it deserves a little more attention than whether or not Reagan's face should be on the million dollar bill? I grow tired of lies and 9/11, dorks.  Three years of  urlLink fear  is enough.  "They could have  urlLink 9/11ed the Space Needle !"  Are we really going to let paralell universes scare us now? They didn't fly a plane into Safeco Field, get over it.  Did the Mariners win? No? Shit. Witness the  urlLink the greatest photo   ever taken by man or beast. Hahahaha, dorks, now that's something to get excited about.  P.S. I forgot to tell you, dorks!  I saw a hobo woman in Seattle's U District on Sunday with a sign that read "Homeless mother yah, blah, rarrgh!" only the "r" was turned around like in a  urlLink Toys 'R' Us  sign. Why?  It's not even that cute when a kid does it, or actually when someone trying to show that someone is young so they reverse the R ... because everyone knows the "Correct Positioning of the Letter R" lobe of the brain doesn't develop until puberty. Back to my observation of the woman. No? A song? Yes!  I don't want a real job. I'll just beg for your change. And when I vomit on the street don't look at me strange. From crack to smack to Jumbo Jacks I really need to score some I don't want a real job 'Cause if I had one I couldn't be a  urlLink Hobo  Mom!

      Provided by the management for your safety ... From a pamphlet handed out today:  Would you know who to call if suddenly one OR ALL (!) of the following happen? -The fire alarms in your building start ringing, yet there is no fire ... -The radio is advising all listeners to evacuate the area due to an on-coming force 5 typhoon is heading your way, and your office is in Nebraska. (These are the actual words. "Would you know what to do if you started writing a run-on sentence for a company handout and then forgot English grammar and the constraints of reality?"). -A co-worker just slipped on the coffee you spilled earlier this morning and injured his (sexist bastards) knee. -A well-known TV investigative reporter is calling on line one wanting to interview you regarding a problem concerning (our product).  "Who ya gonna call" ... The answer is this resource telephone card (attached) ... The subject matter experts answering these lines will be able to help you with these issues and more...  It's nice to know that if I ever say, "Ah, Christ SuperShit!  The building's on fake fire, I've been wormholed to Nebraska, there's a Super Typhoon headed this way, Bob slipped in a completely carpeted office and has knee parts sticking out of his khakis and now Barbara Walters is on LINE ONE (the MOST DREADED OF LINES!) and wants to know the truth! What do I do? Who's I'm gonna call?" someone is there to tell me, "RUN, fucker, RUN!"  Before my disbelief can wear off ... A Rubberhead has asked me to send and inter-office memo to Denver, Alabama. Should I tell them that a.)Denver is in Colorado, b.)we don't have an office in Alabama or c.)nothing, because I'm 75 percent sure the envelope just contains a crayon drawing of a kitten anyways.  I can only stare at the wall as my college education and soul fade away, dorks.

      The Rubberheads, Soccer Moms and NASCAR Dads are in  urlLink my backyard . They are so angry that the  urlLink Wizard of Oz  isn't real, afraid of their wars, and have so much hate for the Lakers that they are coming after 10-year-old children. "There has to be an enemy!  That's what TV teaches us!" Back Soccer Moms! Be gone NASCAR Dads! I have a zero-tolerance policy for Rubberheads!  P.S. Just snuck out of work to get the  urlLink Beastie Boys'  "To the Five Boroughs" ... 4 tracks in and excellent!

      Monday! Me: Hello, Mole.  Did you have a nice weekend? Mole: Nope, never really do much of anything ... Me: Oh. Mole: ... well, did some laundry .. Me: Yep, fun (Moving away) Mole: ... and grocery shopping ... Me: Important  Mole: ... and of course I rejoiced to see the Lakers lose. I HATE them ... so much.  When Mole says this his wrinkles become wrinklier and his brow furrows and his face forms into one that man has historically used to say  "Ghengis Khan stabbed my dog" and "Those Nazis!". Why has the Baby Boomer generation become an increasingly angry group? You see, dorks, first they were stupid hippies and they got hit a lot (actually, first they were neglected of paternal love due to the harsh traditions of non-emotional parent/child relationships their parents were used to), then they were stupid corporate raiders and they lost their souls and now their lives are filled with books like "Men are from Mars and Need to Not Be Stupid" and they cream their jeans when Hillary Duff makes believe that their world exists in it's pretty white universe that is .... lost myself there for a minute. So, they yell! "I HATE red lights." "I HATE David Letterman." "I HATE Wendy's new salads." They used to be mad at their fathers, now they're mad at Shaq.  Moving on. So, I got R. Girl a bracelet for her birthday.  Turns out I got it a little small.  No problem, right? Wrong!  Every Jeweler in Town: Yes are you going to need new O Loops or new eye pins? Me: What? Every Jeweler in Town: Do you know the Quick ratio? Me: Um, I have a bracelet.  There's something about haircutters and jewelers that makes them think they can speak thier lingo and I'll just catch on.  Every Haircutter Ever: Do you want a fade or a crosssnatch? Me: I want to look like I got a haircut. Every Haircutter Ever: For next time remember your gaurd length is 5. Me: NO!  Want some fries to go with your irony? So, I went out with the L.C. yesterday to do some B-Day shopping for R.G.  We dec. to gr. some L. (wait, I can't abbreviate everything) so we went to this place for burgers. One of the burgers was named the "Communication Breakdown Burger" and I ordered out of Zeppelin Loyalty. Guess what? The cook read the ticket wrong and forgot to make the burger. Get it? There was a "Communication Breakdown" and that was the name of the burger. Get it now? Yes? Hahahahahahahaha!  The whole place was rolling when I thanked the waitress for the "Irony Burger", which was on the house. Free Burgers = Perfect Weekend, dorks.

      Mighty dorks and people with brains, I have just returned from Fahrenheit 9/11. Bore you with a review? Nope. Go read a paper for America. I will tell you that this ex-ameri-frat boy who once went after an innocent Clemson fan with a six iron because the dude "was totally hitting on me" actually got choked up at times.  That means it was a good movie, you looking-for-the-deeper-meaning dorks. I can sum up what I felt after the movie by what happened just minutes ago. As I drove home I realized I was angry at the world we live in and thus needed to smoke.  I had to destroy something and tobacco leaves are the easiest and least federally-crime-punished thing to burn. So, I went into the 76 station near our apartment and got me some Doral Lights in a box.   The old white guy next to me with a "Something Important to Farmers and Republicans" hat on starts yelling. "Dammit, shit! I lost my goddamned lighter!" Hmmm, hey I don't have a lighter either.   So, to the middle-eastern guy behind the counter I say, "Hey, man, can I get a book of matches ... and give one to this guy so he stops cursing." The nice gentleman hands me the matches and a pack to the other guy. "Nope, I don't use matches.  The sparks jump off the match and burn my clothes. (Really?) Matches are the most unsafe thing, I only use lighters.  I don't want holes in my clothes ..." "You know, cigarettes put holes in your LUNGS," I point out to this rambling aged Americana piece of work. The middle-eastern guy behind the counter gets the joke and we share a laugh.  The old white guy doesn't. "Lungs? I don't care about my lungs.  I got clothes and they are ..." "Take it easy," I say and I leave. And somewhere in that story is the point of Fahrenheit 9/11.  The middle-easterners and the intelligent people of America get the joke.  There are no WMDs.  There was no threat from Iraq.  There has been no justice since 9/11.   The people who don't care about that and who blindly follow their leaders and their inanerubberist philosophies ("Building a safer world through war"/"I don't use matches") are the rubberheads who are more concerned about the guises they take on (Soccer Mom, NASCAR Dad, Compasionate Conservative, Neo-Patriot) than their lungs or the hearts of the Moms who cry because of soldiers who die. Put on your rubberkicking boots, dorks, it's time to save some Iraqi babies.

       urlLink This , dorks, my doctors ball-grabbing prognosis that I am "fit as a fucker" after yesterday's check-up and my new urlLink  red Nike shorts  that I bought on my lunch break have combined like Voltron to make today a heroically great day.  "This administration does not condone torture." "Pssst, President Bush, condone means to like allow or overlook." "Really? I thought I was just making up another fancy Yaleish word to confuse people." "No, this time you made up a sensible lie." "Shoot it all to Fuck Swamp ... um, what I meant to say is that this administration does not perpitify torture." "That's our, Pinochio Prince!"  Nike shorts, boogers, no testicular cancer, zen.  My two favorite things to yell at horrible drivers: -"Are you alive?" (I constantly suspect many zombies have learned to drive.) -"Asslicker!"  ('Cause nobody expects to be called an asslicker.)  Two things R. Girl says I have yelled at horrible drivers that I don't remember: -"Go fuck your mother." (In my opinion worse than saying "Motherfucker!" because it's an order not a noun word.) -"Give us justice!" (I don't remember ever saying this, but I think it's the coolest thing I've ever said.  This will be written on my tombstone, dorks.)

      From  urlLink cnn.com   Implicitly, (Republicans are) also suggesting (Kerry's) out of touch with Americans. One Republican operative told the New York Times last year that Kerry  urlLink "even looks French."   Looks French?  Is this seriously their campaign tactic?   "Bush/Cheney 2004: A circus monkey + an angry dough pile = Not French looking" Dorks Don't Rock presents ...  urlLink FIND!  urlLink THE!  urlLink FRENCH!  urlLink GUY!  Just click on these four links and guess which of these dudes is the war-hating, bread-liking, pant-wearing Frenchie for a chance to win valuable or non-valuable prizes or nothing!  Please, dorks, beat your television senseless when it tells you to vote for the "least French" candidate!  There's a surplus of televisions.  Put Chinese toddlers to work.

      As I escaped from the rubberhead factory today to get my truck's wheels aligned I drove up on some worker guys fixin' the road. Orange barrels, vests and all. As I approached, the guy holding the "Slow" sign held his  urlLink hand paralell  to the road ( urlLink perpinicular to the road  being the well-known signal for "Stop" or "Put your hand against mine to celebrate our football game victory or the completion of our  urlLink Pine Wood Derby Car .").  As I was going 45 m.p.h., I decided to heed his advice. 35 m.p.h. ... his hand is still up, slow down more. 20 m.p.h. ... still up ... more brake. 10 m.p.h. ... hand up, foot down, time slowing 5 m.p.h. ... is this .... 2 m.p.h. ... guy serious ... Stopped. The guy nods his head to let me know I was now traveling at the proper speed, 0 m.p.h., the speed of rocks and pens.  I had reached Absolute Slow, dorks. My jaw dropped and my stare went blank to celebrate the occasion.

      Ah, dammit all, dorks. I've got that  urlLink "Ding Dong the Witch is Dead"  song stuck in my head for no reason (maybe it's because I read  urlLink this comic  ... but that was months ago).  No witches have died that I know of! I don't even have a doorbell. For the last half hour it's been stuck on the "Which old witch? The Wicked Witch!" part.  Ding Fuck! Get out of my head. Which old head? MY fucking head!  Does it get worse? Yes! Sometimes it overlaps with the "He's a Fucking Genius Wizard" song. So at times my stereo brain is playing this fun hybrid.... "Ding Dong the Witch is dead, because, because, be-cause, because, because, be-cause, because, because, be-cause .. The Wicked Witch is DEAD!"  Welcome to the Jungle we got fun and games we got everything thing you want hmmla la the wicked witch is ..  Dammit, dorks!

      Wetbackorrists, Radical Nigics! So what if I've been drinking?  Dammit, you deserve a drunk entry, dorks. I just finished watching an episode from my  urlLink Superman  DVDs called  urlLink Japoteurs . In it a radical Japanese man tries to fly a plane (!) into Metropolis.  He is dubbed the Japoteur, because Slant Eyed Bob and Nagosammy were already taken. In 62 years have we made progress? Hahahahahaha, dorks!  Just ask the next "Radical Cleric" you meet.

      Two highlights from my drunken Seattle-to-Raleigh conversation with Kurtis "Baby Got" Backs, the best drinking buddy I've ever known.  Highlight #1!  Me: So, you read my blog, is it good?    Kurtis: Yeah, I have to say I laugh pretty often, except when you tend to over-politicize.  Me: What do you mean?   Kurtis: I mean I can't believe you like Michael Moore.  Me: I never said I like Michael Moore.  I think that it's important that he's putting out a message that the average American public has not heard before.  Kurtis: I guess.  Me: It's like Jesus.  Did you know Jesus never washed his hands after using the bathroom?  He'd be like "I need to pee." Then just say "Hey, let's break bread."  People still liked him.   It's not the man, it's the message.   Highlight #2!  Me: Yeah, so I told R. Girl that when I die that I want my tombstone to say: Brent Kinkade Son. Brother. Husband. Father. Zombie?  Kurtis: Good one.  Me: Do you think it should have a question mark after "Zombie" or should it be a period?  Kurtis: How about some elipses?  Like, "To be continued".  Me: Perfect!  It's like I could come back as the Zombie King!  P.S., dorks, as much as I think Pete Yorn and The Smiths' "Panic" kick ass seperately ... together they suck harder than a whore. Also, on Hwy-167 last weekend I saw a redneck driving a truck with a witty Calvin-peeing-on-something bumper sticker. What was it? "City boys" The redneck was peeing on city boys.  The irony is ... you have to usually find a city boy to find someone into that.

      I have tried in the past 18 months since leaving the drunken comforter of college to use Monster.com to my full advantage. Monster has sent me links to many exciting non-me career opportunities, including: Soldier, Welder, Pet Technician, President of Mobil Oil, Boat Welder and, of course, Carpet Welder.  Oh, Monster, truly today's the day for you to show me what I need!  Kyle, my brother and computer Khan at Microsoft, received an e-mail from Monster Networking ("Today's the day for you to meet welders in your area!") "We've got someone we'd like you to meet!" Who? Who? Why,  urlLink Robert G. , of course.  Who is Robert G.?  Just ask him!  "60some writer, marketing/sales/PR person, fit and curious. I am in love with an Asian woman whose pop name is Emma."  This is the kind of guy with a hottub any Microsoft programer should know right? Read on, dorks!  Robert G.'s Skills?  "written/verbal communications, marketing/sales, le (Expert)	writer, philosopher (Beginner)" He's a beginner philosopher, "I think, therefore I ... um, need to go hottubbin'!" Also, he's a beginer AND an expert at writing!   Very zen, Robert.   He and Emma must discuss the inability to ever become an expert writer ,and as such, all one can really hope to achieve is a continued rebirth of the creative spirit.    Robert G.'s Interests? Hold on to your universe dorks!  "music, books, biking, hiking, mountains, beaches, good & straight sex, cuddling, sunsets"  ....... what?  Oh, I see, Monster, the reason Microsoft has been having major security problems over the past year is because of lack of cuddling!  Of course, they aren't enjoying sunsets or "good & straight"-yet-curious sex!   Today's the day that Monster saves the world again, making it better for underemployed journalism majors, highly paid Microsoft engineers, Robert G. and of course the great American hero ... the welder!

      Brent's Top Ten Things to do to Keep Himself Entertained While R. Girl is Having Fun in Las Vegas  10.) Recreate the door kicking-in scene from Walking Tall (the  urlLink Joe Don Baker  one) every time I enter a room. "You got a warant?" "Yeah, I keep it in my shoe!" (Kicks in door, finds bourbon, rejoices! .... later gets shot and wears Darth Vader mask.)  9.) Have my yearly "If I drink Zima alone noone will laugh at me" Night.  8.) Find a slug on my porch when I'm drunk.  Wonder at what point in the evelutionary process did slugs say "You know what? I think I'm good with the slime and the crawling.  You guys go on ahead."  7.) Decide that not wearing a shirt under my button up shirt is too sexy to pass up.  6.) Repeatedly get frustrated at Hitman: Contracts because I can't make it past the first level.  Just because I'm trying to put a syringe into a SWAT team member's neck or just because I decide to use piano wire to choke a mental paitient in front of a horrorified orderly does that mean I have to get shot?  5.) Sing ... my own versions of songs! "Well, I tip my hat to the big washing ma-chine And I say hello to the coffee ma-a-ker Smile because I've got nuggets to eat. So I pick up my nuggets and say, 'Who wants nuggets today?' Then I open up the oven and, HEY! I'm eating chicken nuggets again!"  4.) Catch up on my  urlLink reading .  3.) Call R. Vegas and ask what new presents she has bought me since the last time we talked!  2.) Get excited about presents!  1.) Stumble around Blockbuster for an hour trying to decide between "They Live!" or "Naked Ski Hookers!".

      R. Lucky left for  urlLink Las Vegas  yesterday.  According to her, our months of piggy bank savings have blown away in the desert.  I was hoping I'd be bedding down with a millionaire when she got back, but I'll just settle for a derriere.   She told me about her first day of  urlLink liquour  and one-armed bandits while I made a quesadilla at 1:00 a.m. because neither of us could sleep. For the next few days I'll stumble around the apartment, forgetting pants and when to eat.   I found an interesting  urlLink on-line journal  from a soldier in Iraq. If the sucker's for real then our souls are fucked.   A story. When I was five-years-old or so my family went to Wisconsin Dells, which is for midwesterners who feel Disney isn't cheese-focused enough. One of the proudest moments of my life was when I got to drive one of the  urlLink Wisconsin Dells Ducks , a land/water hybrid tourist mover. I thought I was really driving the boat and loved every minute of it.  As I swerved the large boat around the captain told me I was in danger of wrecking it on the rocky cliffs.  But, I couldn't let that happen and always straightened the boat out in the nick of time to save my precious crew.   I thought I was a natural boat captain because it was all so easy.  I wanted to be a duck captain when I grew up. But then I did grow up.  I realized I wasn't in charge of anything.  I might have had my hands on the steering wheel, but one wrong move and the real captain would have yanked me out of control.   I can't say it was heart breaking to find out I'm not a natural river boat captain, so don't cry for me Dorkentina. But it is sad that so many people will think that today's "hand over" of Iraq sovereignty is real, that the post-toddler steering the country is the real captain. But one wrong step and they'll lose their grip on the wheel. The  urlLink truth  is that nothing has changed, dorks.  The war is still going on.  Four or five guys signing a piece of paper doesn't stop bullets from going through soldiers.   But play with your MTvs and watch your Olsen twins dance, dorks.  Close your eyes and let it slip by, because it's not happening to you.  You aren't dumber or a zombie.  You'll get mad when they show up on your front door and take away your rights, right?  That's when you'll be upset. And then you'll be in a nice, quiet  urlLink Cuban ass-prodding camp.

      Cashier Woman: "What's this?"  Stupid Man: "That's a tomatilo."  Cashier Woman:"No way!"  Stupid Man: "Yes. I should know what a tomatilo is, I'm from the South."  Cashier Woman: "You better not be fooling me, I don't give you boys any special treatment at the fire house."  Top Ten Things I Should Have Said to The Chatty Rubberheads In Front of Me at The Grocery Store Delaying My Weekend Camping Trip:  10.) "Hey! Buy one 'shut' get one 'the fuck up!' free."  9.) "Hey! Can we get a price check on Bald Fuck and Chatty Skank?"  8.) "Hey! This week's special is life at an acceptable pace!"  7.) "Hey! Fuck up on ailse Bald Ass."  6.) "Hey! Would you like some help out with ... these fists?"  5.) "Hey! It's paper or plastic; not paper, plastic or babble."  4.) "Hey! Would you like to sample some mouth closing?"  3.) "Hey! I must slay you and have revenge for my father's blood." (Just to keep them on their toes)  2.) "Hey! Your chat has angered me!  I shall summon your lord the Great Shift Manager to smite you!"  1.) "Hey! This line is 10 spoken words or less."  Weekend, dorks, I'm going camping.

      Iraqi mother:  Why did your tank blow up my baby?  U.S. soldier:  Why am I missing a leg and suffering from nerve damage?  U.S. Taxpayer:  Why am I expected to bear the cost of a multi-billion dollar war?  Official Senate Intelligence Committee answer:  urlLink "Group think."   Ooooh. Gotcha.  (Pssst, dorks ... "This 'group think' dynamic led Intelligence Community analysts ...  to both interpret ambiguous evidence as conclusively indicative ... as well as ignore or minimize evidence that Iraq did not have active and expanding weapons of mass destruction programs" is a fancy way of saying, "Liars!".)

      Hwy-167. Rush hour yesterday.  HOV (to the izay!) lane. "So, the kids have these shoes and thier birth mother doesn't make them wear them and so their feet get dirty and I say 'Dirty feet?'.  I mean come on, those are feet we are talking about, not potatoes ..."  "Hmm, sound like a couple of winners. Hey, look, our exit, time to merge ..." I find a spot and move in.  HONK!!!! - HONK!!!! -HONK!!!! -HONK!!!!  I look in my side mirror and see some cow girl driving behind me making the universal  "What's your problem" face with accomodating hands in the air gesture.  "What, you big (fat) girl (bitch)?" I yell back. "It's called driving!  People merge!  Guess what?!?!? The scenery changes too!  Go home and eat a pie you cow!" I then proceed to mock her dumb face back at her in my driver's side mirror. "Huh? A der!  What?  Who driving?  A hee dee huh-er ...."  When I've had my fill of fat-girl taunting I look over and see Hippie Chick slack-jawed and saucer-eyed looking at me.  Shit, forgot she was there.  This is the first emotion of mine she seen since "Ah, sure, yep, uh-huh".    "So, tell me more about your lovely children," I say.   Yesterday.  Kidco.  Grocery shopping.   Thinking to myself:  Just put the cart over here.  Hey, look, orange juice drink.  That's not like real orange juice.  It's just water and powder.  Or just dye.  Mexican people like it a lot.  I always see them drinking it at the park or buying it at stores.  Look, those two Mexican guys just bought 4 gallons.  Wow.  I wonder if that stuff sucks as much as Chocolate Drink.  A knock-off Chocolate Milk?  Gross.  Is Mexican guy the correct term?  Are they Latins?  I know it's not Chi....  "Brent!" R. Girl says boldly behind me.  "Hey, babe, what d'ya got there?  Some half&half?  Mmmm."  "I said your name three times and you just kept on walking.  You just walked over here and parked the cart and stood while I said your name louder and louder.  The entire grocery aisle turned around and looked except you!" she says.  "Really?" I ask.  "It's true," says a lady passing by.  "See?  She looked, you walked," says R. I-would-have-thought-used-to-it-by-now.  "Is your name Brent, too?" I ask the lady as she walks on.   Later, dorks.

      Two short stories about food from yesterday (One mine and one R. Girl's)  My food story!  Kyle is notorious for keeping a messy car, room, home and pair of cargo pants. If there is space to be filled Kyle will fill it with something. That something is likely a trial AOL C.D. But not yesterday. After going out to lunch yesterday Kyle and I decided to spend the afternoon buying soap. To save time and the world gas, Kyle suggested we take his car. The little red Miata, described by some as "a tube of lipstick on wheels". Described by me as "a car full of shit". "I'm not going anywhere until you get some of this trash and stuff out of the passenger seat, dude," I said. So, Kyle started pulling trash out. Paper. Candy bar wrappers. Empty KFC Popcorn Chicken boxes. Broken CDs A rock. And of course ... a half-eaten whole chicken. I still rode in the car after we buried the fowl.  R. Girl's food story!  At work yesterday R. Girl and her co-worker ordered some teriyaki.  They waited and waited for the food to arrive, being unable to go pick it up due to the having to watch the kids on ventilators. Finally a small, old, rude Asian man showed up bearing gifts of rice and egg rolls. "20.22" R. Girl hands him a twenty-dollar bill and a quarter and starts to shut the door. Suddenly the old man pushes the door open and yells, "This total does not include my tip! No tip for an old man? Where is tip?" "Well, this is the reason you aren't getting one," replies R. Witty. "I guess it's going to be a bad day," says the rude Asian. "For you," she says and closes the door. The food was good.  Two signs. One real, one in my head, one bad, one good.  The name of the coffee stand next to where I had lunch with Kyle yesterday: "Drink & Drive" Drive Thru Espresso Stand  The name of the price-friendly gyro restaurant I want to open in protest to the $10 gyro platter (beef gyro and fries) at Gyro World: "Christ, They're Just Gyros."

      Last night at the Mariners game against the Indians:  ( urlLink Section 143, Row 13, Seat 13)   Bottom of the 7th inning.&nbsp; Mariners at bat.&nbsp; 2 outs.&nbsp; Cleveland leads 1-0.    urlLink The Mariners' Moose  is getting the crowd pumped with his "Raise the Roof" and "I can't hear you" antics.  The problem is, this is the most boring baseball game ever played.   The Moose orders us to raise the roof.  "No, Moose."   The Moose orders us to make some noise.  "Should we go get a hotdog."   The Moose says that he can't hear us.  "Let's go to the Team Store.&nbsp; I need to buy a gift for the guy who gave me these tickets."   Suddenly, the Moose throws his "NOISE" sign on the ground and goes after a fan, arms raised making the universal mascot gesture for "Do you want to fight a mascot?"  "Shit, look, the Moose is picking a fight."   The Moose regains his composure and his sign.&nbsp; Make some noise!  Suddenly the entire place gets on its feet and starts to yell and cheer.  "Oh my god," I think for a split second. "People have started to revolt against performers who say they can't hear them.&nbsp; I'm witnessing history."   Then I realize that the&nbsp; urlLink game winning home run  has been hit.  That's exciting too.   Mariners snap their 9-game losing streak.&nbsp; I continue my 6-game Mariners-winning-at-every-game I attend streak.  Weekend!

      Welcome back to typing, fingers, and to reading, dorks. Is it just me?  Does the world that I live in happen to other people? Why?   ! Last night I decided after a couple levels of Driv3r and some tacos, "I need to just relax tonight.  No blowing up ninjas or hunting down prostitutes.  I will lay around and chat with R. Girl." Hours later ...  "Really?  I didn't know you liked peanut butter.  The things you learn when the XBox is off ..."  Ring, Ring goes my cell phone.   "It's Kyle calling," I say. "I'll ignore it ... tell me more about this 'vacuuming' thing that you do.  Is it easy to pick up or do you need some training, like on Driv3r?"  Ring, Ring goes R. Girl's cell phone.  "It's Kyle," she says.  "Hmm, it must be important."  I answer.  "What's up?"  "So, I just got off the phone with Mom."  "Yeah? Great, look I'm kind of ..."  "Yep.  Apparently she's engaged ... again."  "What?!? To who?  What's his name?"  "I'm not really sure.  He has his own lotion business.  I didn't get his name because he was going on for half an hour about a foot lotion I should try."  "What?"  "Yeah, apparently many adult men have major problems with their feet.  It's not uncommon."  "The vital information, Kyle!"  "Oh yeah.  He has ten kids.  He said he's going to call you tomorrow and tell you all about it.  Don't let him talk about his lotions for too long, though.  He just keeps going and going."  "This is too much.  I need to go."  What? Is? My? Life? Can't I just have one day to stop and smell the tacos without a family member flying through a window, a zebra cutting me off walking down the street or a crazy old man screaming at me "You're a robot! A robot!"? All of those things have happened to me and that is my life.  And now I have to welcome a new guy (who I have already nicknamed Newt Tragena ... get it?) into it.   Bound on, wackiness!  Bound on!  Oh, dorks, and ... During me and R. Woodsy's improper-English-yet-gloriforous camping trip we needed to go "into town" to get batteries for our flashlights. "I don't need the Titanium batteries, Cashier Lady, just give me the plain ol' Duracells." "Are you sure?  These Titanium ones are good, especially if you are going to be using them  in anything electronic ." "Oh, really? Well, I was just going to use them for pancake toppings, but ... shoot, I'll give them ee-leck-tronick batteries a try for!" (Banjos play and rubberheads sway.)

A very Brent moment, from last night:  (Beer-buzzed at the grocery store purchasing a six pack of  urlLink beer , a pack of  urlLink cigarettes  and a cobb salad)  People in front of me in line.  Blurry Blonde: She what?   Blurry Man: She lost her lottery ticket.   Blurry Blonde: Did she win?   Blurry Man: She doesn't know.&nbsp; She lost the ticket.   Me: (Feeling I could contribute to the conversation) I lost a fish in college.   (Blurry Blonde and Blurry Man look at me.)   Me: (Shrug shoulders) I don't know how to take care of fish.   &nbsp;  A very non-Brent moment, from yesterday:  "Hey, look, a pick-your-own lavender field!&nbsp; Let's stop!&nbsp; Hey, they have corn!"

       Some days my job makes me want to roar:      Mon 7/19/2004 8:39 a.m.  To: Brent  From: Egg Belly   Thanks for delivering the large boxes to my area.   Next time could you please set them just outside my cubicle, I could hardly get in this morning. There should be room just to the left of the doorway (as you stand facing my cubicle) of my cubicle and the boxes could be stacked close to the cubicle wall and be out of the way until I return.   Thanks,  Egg Belly     My bad, Egg Belly!&nbsp; I forgot to do fatty math ... fatmatic!  One office cubicle:&nbsp; 5 feet long, 4 feet wide = 20 square ft. of floor space  5 stacked boxes: 1 foot by 3 feet= 3 square ft. of floor space  One beast: 4 feet long, 3.5 feet wide = 14 square feet.   I only left 3 square feet for your ham and Twinkie pie shake.&nbsp; I'll remember that next time.   And!    Mon 7/19/2004 7:14 a.m.    To: Brent    From: Crumble Cheeks     &nbsp;   Good god! From what I see here Brent, authorized to have you order. Double check for me making sure, as well.  Thanks again, Person.     &nbsp;   I have read this e-mail about 42 times.&nbsp; I give up. &nbsp; I am, unable to understand ... brain falling, double check, as well making, sure.  But sometimes I enjoy my job:   "I wonder what's behind those file cabinets.&nbsp; Let's find out."   2 minutes later.   "Is that a .. YES, IT IS!&nbsp; A yo-yo!!!!"

       Rubbersations for a Tuesday.   Me: Oh, hello, Disproportionate Torso (I really need to learn people's names).  Disproportionate Torso: Hello, Brent.  Me: Hey, did you get a haircut.  Disproportionate Torso: Actually, I got them all cut!  Me (Outside): Oh, ha ha, the glory of a joke! Me (Inside): I can feel my brain unlearning!  Another one.  Me: Hello, Told Me About Your Vomit Once, having an exciting day?  Told Me About Her Vomit Once: No.  I'm soooooooooooooooo bored.  Me: That's a lot of ohs ... do you have a book to read?  T.M.A.H.V.O.: No!  I hate to read!  Me:(Outside) That's a shame. Me: (Inside) Ewww, she puked.  Last night.  The world was calm.  I was grilling a steak for dinner.  R. Girl was working late.  The world was quiet.  Children slept.  Old men remembered battles and victories.  Meat cooked.  The world was still.  Ring. Ring.  "Hey, Mom, how's it going?"  "Well, OK, I just wanted to call ..."  "I'm making a steak."  "...becasue I wanted to let you know that ..."  "It's big."  "... last night I came to the decision that ..."  "Sizzle."  "... I was going to give the ring back to Newt."  "Oh, yeah?  Why?"  "Well, it was all happening so fast and I was worried about his intentions."  "Gotta look out for yourself."  "Yeah, I'm better off."  "Yep, and my life is back to the way it was eight days ago. We all win!"  "I've actually already got a couple of dates set up for this weekend."  "I'm making a steak."  "Your mother rebounds really well, Brent."  "That's great!"  "One guy was asking me if I make really good spaghetti."  "Oh."  "I told him yes."  "Oh."  "He was like 'I mean really, really good spaghetti."  "Oh."  "I was like, 'Yes'."  "O.."  "He was like, 'I mean really, really good spaghetti."  "...h."  "I was like, 'Yes'."  I learned a lot about myself that night.  I learned I could listen to my mom talk about her spaghetti for hours and that I could not eat a full pound of rare steak without getting a severe stomach ache.  Most of all, I learned that losing a little piece of your innocence just means you're gaining a big piece of maturity.  I would never see that steak again.  He went off to Vietnam and would be dead a year later.  Mom?  She's now a full-time spaghetti cook.  To this date she has made over 2,500 tons of spaghetti for the single men of Phoenix.  They all claim it's "really, really, really, really, really good".  Newt's lotion business went bankrupt a few months later.  All along he had just been putting sour cream in old toothpaste containers and passing it off as lotion.  It turns out that one of his ten children, Lil' Sue, had an addiction to Mexican food condiments.  She wiped out the entire family business during a Christmas Eve bender.  Police described the scene as "The stupidest thing we've ever seen."  Hobo Bob went on to beat  urlLink Slinky Boxcar  in that shiv fight.  Bums around the world would talk about the legend of Hobo Bob and his "Steel of Anger" for years.    And me, well, I went down to the tanning booth and later became a gorilla poacher.   Still, today I look back on that night ... in wonder.

      "They only poll people who have consistently voted in previous elections. ...

Come November 2. ... 'it's a 50/50 country'. Like if they just keep repeating it enough, it will be true. 'It's a 50/50 country. Put your heels together now. It's a 50/50 country.' ... It ain't a 50/50 country. People are angry."  -  urlLink Michael Moore  on the  urlLink "liberal"  media  Be angry, dorks! Be American! Vote with your flag!

If I am, the internet tells me that I have been pregnant for 38 weeks.  That means I'm not only slightly pregnant, but that I gave birth 2 weeks ago and didn't notice it. Anyone seen a baby?

      The Democratic National Convention started today.&nbsp; Let's talk about the free speech zone, dorks.&nbsp; Or can we?&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, what is this ....  SHUT UP, ME!  It's time to talk about porn!   A classic Brent porn story for the ages:  I was adventurous one night in college and decided to rent a dirty movie.&nbsp; I don't remember what it was called, something like "Amazon Strap-On Golden Girls and Their Bitch Slave Boys Do Six Flags".&nbsp; Whatever it was called it was dirty enough to make the "climax" (ha) of this story what it is.  I returned the movie the following day because porn rentals aren't the Blockbuster 5-day gracious ones (and we all know that no matter how exciting a porn is on the first day, by the second it's just 17 naked girls and an elephant).  But, wait, where is the pornography store?  Oh, it burned down.  I get out of my car, stunned to see a place that just a day ago was so alive with the aura of&nbsp;lotions, boots&nbsp;and 19-year-old strippers now reduced to a charred pile.  "What happened?" I ask a fireman/inspector.  "It was an electrical fire," I'm told.  "When?" I ask, still stunned.  "Last night ... they asked us to hold all rental returns.&nbsp; I'll take that," the fireman says.  It's at that point I realize I am&nbsp;holding my copy of "Amazon Strap-on Golden Girls and Their Bitch Slave Boys Do Six Flags".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a man who I'm supposed to be worshiping in this post-9/11 world is taking it from my hands.  There's a moment soon after he glances at the title and before I run away, run away, run away that we look at each other.&nbsp;  I feel like I should say "God Bless America" or "Never forget", but instead I just run away, run away, run away.   A line heard this weekend that is truer than any I've heard before in porn:  (Girl being violated by two guys) "I should have stayed in school."   Let me tell you, dorks, this girl's words made me consider law school more than any ad campaign or family member's advice.  She should be the new poster girl for the anti-dropouts.&nbsp;

      How I Know I Have an Addiction to Television by Brent Kinkade  Hey, what's that girl doing? Someone died? No, wait, it's a rock star. What are they doing now? Is that a high school? I couldn't do that at my high school. Who is that now? Are they friends? Hey, a jacket!  "Brent!"  "Uh, yes, what?"  "This lady has been asking you the same question over and over again," says R. Girl.  "Huh?"  Oh, that's right I'm at a grocery store. I'm turning in a lottery ticket for a two dollar prize. Stupid in-store television display.  "Oh, sorry," I say and focus on the cashier lady.  "Everytime there's a T.V. on ...,"says R. Girl.  "Yeah, I know. What was that I was watching anyways?" I ask.  " Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,"  R. Girl informs me.  "Oh, crap, I have a problem ..."   BUT! I'm not the only person with a problem! Because .... The other night R. Girl and I stop by to visit her friend the girl-barber because she cuts hair like a downtown stylist at a reasonable rate. There's one catch. She has a very stoned and rubberheaded roommate. Here is my conversation with him.  Stoner: Hey, you want to smoke some?  Me: No, thanks. (I was just concerned that being high before a haircut could lead to a mohawk.)  Stoner: (Ver-fucking-batim) Hey, who's that guy that played the Riddler on that old Batman show? You know not the guy who was the Riddler, but the actor who played the Riddler.  Me: Frank Gorsham, I think. (Actually, Frank Gorshin, but I was really fucking close, dorks.)  Stoner: No, wait, I mean what's the name of that guy on Superman who if you say his name you beat him?  Me: What?  Stoner: You say his name and he ... hehehehe ... goes away.  Me: I am not following you.  Stoner: Wait! That's Rumplestiltskin.  Me: Wow, you are really combining a lot of fictional characters with this thought.  So, I get my hair cut and leave. Days later R. Girl tells me that the stoner was upset with her and I because we didn't smoke weed with him.  "What?"  "Yeah, he said 'They come into my house and they gotta respect me.'"  "What does that mean? I have to get high to be there?"  "I don't know. He's weird."  "I needed to be high for that fucking Rumplestiltskin conversation; I tell you that!"  I think I should consult Dear Abbey about this one.   Dear Abbey, When I go over to a stoner's house is it rude to pass up a bowl of kind bud? Thanks, Sober in Seattle    Dear Sober, If you want to show respect to your host you gotta toke that shit, dog!   Some people should come equipped with muzzles, dorks.

       urlLink    Morning, afternoon or tomorrow to you, dorks. Here is this week's batch of V.S.P.s. It's been a while since I've written an actual post ... opting for the Christ-teasing and stick-drawing instead. So, let me tell you dorks that I'm doing good. I had a job interview last week that was promising. I had many daiquiris last night that were stong. Yes daiquiris. My  urlLink kickball team  is strong but we have lost 3 games in a row. I got caught trying to skip out on a $70 chinese food tab after concluding that the chow mein was actually "noodles and ... is that fucking Vaseline?". R. Girl and I stood our ground and made waitresses cry. The couple that berates the food service industry together is the couple that eats spit in the food together. More later this week. Enjoy my art!
