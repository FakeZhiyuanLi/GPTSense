      [post 5am shift] AHHH im tired as a mofo! lol but I cant take a nap cuz the rains all pater, pater n shit on my roof. grrr mc donalds how i hate thee! 3 reasons why my shift sucked (besided the obvious that it was at 5am): 1) I had to open with Andy, they biggest loony in the entire hell hole that is royal oak mcdonalds. 2) Cheryl also opened. 3) Kellan worked the last two hours of my shift with me. So ya basically the worst part of my shift was the people I worked with. But I must say, I got an hour long break (tho only half was paid for) and I got to leave half an hour early!! yay! well thats all for now, I think im gonna take a gravol and sleep for the next 5 hours, adios!

Ok so theres my day in a nut shell. But seriously, in A-block we watch finding Nemo in spanish with english subtitles. (gag me now) And in P.E. Mrs. Moore was raggin on us for misbehaving and she only played half om my cd in the gym. (she had ot play katies bs Incubus. And im not knocking Incubus, but there old cd was better)AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF I JAMMED MY FINGER AND ITS BALOONED UP LIKE A MOFO! Lunch was ok. Not as eventfull as yesterday with the milk contest and such but it was marginally good. In C block i had a math test which (with my gimpy finger) I failed. what else is new eh? BUT the biggest piece of luck came in D block when I was picked 19th in my oral (haha) presentation yes! So now i get to go tomorrow! AND I have no other homework tonite other than memorising my oral (hehe) presentation! This calls for a big whooooot! thank you, that is all.  B.T.W. Rachel was wearign full bums today!

      so theres nothign new in my life at the moment. im kida stuck in this rut and its really annoying. i wake up, go to school come home and watch tv, go on the comp and do homework. it a neverending cycle!! ahhhh!! i seriously need a bf to mix things up a bit or like i need to attempt suicide, at least that would spice things up a bit!! no i don't think ill kill myself but i really need to do somethign to make life more interesting. not neccisarily funner, but like more... different. like when u talk to people on msn and there like 'wuts up?' and ur like 'n2m' its the same old thing!!!! ahhhhhhh my new goal is to make life more fun. so to do that ill a) join a gym (releases endorfins to make me happy!) b) atttempt to make more friends at school and c) go to a youth group or something to awake me spiritually, last summer owned cuz i felt so in tune. well im gonna go for dinner. peace

      Ok, how cool is the new Harry Potter movie, definitly the best of all 3 if i do say so myself. I was especially impressed with all the cool cinematography stuff, that definitly is cool. My one real 'beef' with the movie was the whole Sirius Black thing. I dunno Gary Oldman is cool, (Sid Vicious!) but he didnt portray the Sirius i was thinking about when i read the book. Like in the book dont they describe Sirius as being this handsome guy whos all scruffy cuz of the whole Azcaban thing? I dunno, i also thought he would be younger... but w/e. it was still good. The guy who played Lupin was cool to. I wasnt a big fan of his little moustache thing, it looked like he had a cut they sewed together and left a scar so the hair wouldnt grow! *sigh* But as usual the HP cast got a lot hotter and more pleasing to the eye. Emma Watson (Hermione) is gonna be one hot momma when shes older! Same with Dan (harry) hes lookin pretty fine himself and Ron looked like hes been workign out! hes buffed up a bit which i thought was cool. Over all it was a good show and i recomend it to any Harry Potter fan. P.S. Props to the new director, hes got a new style that i liked in the HP series! P.S.S Y Tu Mama Tambien was an awesome movie (I reccomend that one too)

        Ahhhhh i havent Blogged in like... months! i feel bad for letting my adoring fans (i think thats just Shannon) out of the poverbial loop. Oh well im back, and im going to make a super cool, radical, gnarly layout! because its summer and&nbsp;the black just aint cool no more. So, theres nothign new in my life other than... nothing. lol Its the same ald stuff with work, (except now that its summer i get to work more (whopee) but that also means more money, which is good). But you know somethign funny, during that last horrid month of school you make all these plans to hangout with people during the summer, but when summer arrives, you dont do anything! and u might even start to move away from said friends! I know this has happened to me, i used to be good friends with this girl (who will not be named for her sake and mine) and&nbsp; by the end we werent SUPER close but we still talked in spanish class (oops, there i&nbsp;just gave it away) and we said the whole speech about how we were gonna hang out during the summer and get high or w/e. but that never happened. and ive asked her to hang out but shes allways busy with other friends (whom i cant stand). I dont get it, why do people say there gonna have this totally amazing summer, and then blow it all away? Like, dont tell people your gonna hang out with them and then dont! Just dotn say it in the first place. Anyways in other news im totally in love with htat song Jesus Walks by Kanye West. that guys got talent. and its not a bad song either. Same with All Falls Down, i totally can think of some people who fit in withthat song. but anyways, thats a whole different blog. But i have to go because ive wasted my whole morning in bed and on the computer (pluss i smell). so i will sign off and go take a much needed shower.    xoxo    -Leslee &nbsp;

        WOW that is tiny.. its kinda cute too. I think my new font size will be extra small. so for todays word of the day (i used to have a song of the day but i got lazy and theres waaay more words than songs) is Stigmata. the definition for Stigmata is as follows: bodily marks or pains resembling the wounds of the crucified Christ and sometimes accompanying religious ecstasy. Wow, what a cool word. I think it sounds kinda neat too, and it is the title of a very stupid movie. Anyways, I have a new activity that i hate. Mowing the lawn. No wait, i mean mowing MY lawn. To any of you who have had the great honor of being in my backyard, you will know that it is this big huge wonky S (with the addition of a sloped front yard). AHHH it was murder. well not murder, just a real pain in the butt because of all the curves. Why couldnt my yard be shaped normally, like a square? whyyyy!? Anyways, being the nerd that i am, i am a part of the StarWars mailing list (pushes glasses up nose with index finger) and yesterday i recieved a wounderful letter stating that the new starwars movie will be called (in full title) Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. i woudl just like to say George, your losing your touch. The old names left a bit to the imagination (think a A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back) by makign you  think  about what was going to happen in the movie. I dunno Revenge of the Sith seems... gay. We all know who the Sith lord is (and if you dont, you are living a very meanignless life) so why does Lucas have to give it away. why didnt he call it 'Anakin knocks up Amidala, she had twins, He goes over to the dark side'. No wait, that defeated the purpose of leaving it to the imagination...       ...         ...well he should take a few lessons from the harry potter lady, (j.k. rowling) and pick cool names. Like the new one (book 6 i think were at?) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Now that sounds cool. But at the same time im pissed cuz i have no clue who this 'prince' could be. she should dumb-it-down for us.         ... great i contradicted myself         ...crap   &nbsp;    &nbsp;   xoxo Leslee

       hey, so funny thing when ur walking to Mattics and u see 8 million (ok 7) people that you recognise when u look liek bum, and you are kickin it with your sister. Its funny how life works that way. Just when you dont want to be seen, you are! I mean dont get me wrong i love hangin out with Holly, were really close and junk, but i just dotn liek beign seen by peopel when im all lets say uglified. So heres how it goes, Holly and I are walkign to mattics, we arrive and wander around get icecream and so on. As we leave the great Shannon Brown-John and Arielle ride by on their bikes (stupid showoffs getting excercise why i ougta..) so we chatted a bit and me n holl went on our merry way. Later on our walk home Suzie wetzer and her dear mom drive by (i wave lookign like a total dumbass) and then kristi merideth and soem chick walk by (i look away but then wounder why seeing as how i dont like them and they are losers...) So continues my story but now we are about 100m closer to the destination (home) and who passes us but Leanne and... Brittney...Stars-omethign-or-other. W/e thats not important. I mean Leanes nice (we exchanged a friendly hello). but what is the freaking deal!! does got purposly set people along your path when ur looking your ugliest? i dotn get it, a few days ago i went downtown all pretty and junk and i saw NO ONE i knew! like wtf! its not like i was trolling but stil.... i was mad   ...and i still am    &nbsp;  xoxo Leslee

       ok, so I went over to Leah's for a sleepover&nbsp;on Monday night which was very cool and in the mornign she had&nbsp;to go to kickboxign which is downtown so they dropped me off at Chapters. seeing as though i had half an hour to kill b4 the next cordova bay 32 came, i looked through Chapters. While in there i picked up a couple books that looked good. The first was calles 'The Book of Dead Days' by Marcus Sedgwick. And i have to say it was a VERY good read. Im ususally not into this type of book but this was one of thoes ones where i judged it on its cover adn hit gold. Its set in a huge old, derelict metropolis where a 15yr old boy named Boy lives and workes for this magician who has a show in the poorer part of town. After a few strange murgers, the boy and his new friend Willow, get summoned by the wizard to do a whole wack of crazy things (think grave robbing, crazy doctor Jeckyl/Hyde things, and insane undergrown mazes). Anyways, im not going to give away the ending in case anyoen decides to read the above mentioned book. But its really good, i read it waaay into the weeee hours of the night. But sadly, with my bad memory and not leaving myself time to absorb the book. ive kinda forgot the begining (most of the explanation came from the back of the book :P).    Well seeing as how its 1:36 pm and im still in my jammies, i have to go.     xox leslee

          song:   ministry of sound mix      book:         the lovely bones      quote:         (below)                         "I gotta go away Cause i didn't mean to lead you on You say i broke your heart But I didn't mean to lead you on And it's hard to hear the truth But I'm feeling bad cause you love me I'm sorry"                 ~Im Sorry by Christina Milian (best song)                          i love that song so much. its so pretty, and its quite anti RnB. Like all the other songs out there are about cheating (see confessions part 2 by Usher) but this one is different and thats why i like it. heres the next few lines:                                   "You've got a wife and a family And if I was you I wouldn't throw that away I'm not not the type of girl to Break up a happy home I really thought we could be friends But it seems that I gotta go"         soo hott.

                       ok, im not here to nit pick (well actually i am) but hasnt anyone alse knoticed that there are a lot of good books that are being slaughtered at the merciles hands of movie directors? Take Lord of the Rings, Matilda and even the Bible! All of these great books have turned into movies. Take the most recent example of the great book(s), I Robot by Isaac Asimov. Now i havent seen the movie so i dont know if they've butchered it or not, but the book is very intricat and  no one  could ever be able to portray that in a 2 hour movie. Another more well known example is the Harry Potter series bu J.K. Rowling. The books are very good pieces of childrens lit which im sure will become classics but the movies? i dont think they will go on the top shelf with The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, just because they were made by money hungery prodicers and direcotors who wanted to make a quick buck. I mean, were at the 3rd movie and 5th book, the books took well over 5 years to write and the movies? possably 3. At this rate the movies will catch up to the books within a couple of years and bu then the actors will be older, well past puberty and unable to play their Harry Potter counterparts. And for what, so a bunch of people could get rich. Why not wait till J.K. is done writing the books to start a movie franchise. Or, start when shes at the 6th book so you can make your movies and not have to wait for, or rush the writer.  No back to the real reason ive started this rant. One of my favorite books that came out a few years ago called Abarat by Clive Barker, yes,  that  clive barker (the mastermind behind many of todays horror flicks) recently aquired a webpage (how sweet). Well upon checkign the website out i clicked on a link that said 'Movie'. My first reaction was 'cool an Abarat movie maybe it wont fall into the traps like other book-to-film books', but when i got to the opened link i gasped in horror (well not really, but for effect, lets say i did). Within the first paragraph it said (and i quote) "The book of ABARAT was so captivating that the Walt Disney Company purchased the movie, theme park, and multimedia rights to the series for $8 million dollars." ...(moment of silence for effect)... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i yelled, they cant do this to a perfecty good book and Disney for gods sake, WHY did Disney have to buy it! The book is going the way of Pirates Of the Caribbean (in reverse) with the disneyland ride!!! aarrgghh, im boiling with rage ready to bite the head off of the next passerby (which in this case would be Holly, excuse me while i run after her). Im sorry but there are going to be 4 books in the Abarat series (the second due in october) and they are wanting to start a movie now!!! It took Clive 2 years to write and illustrate the second one (im assuming he worked on it from when the first one was published), so if they wanted to do a movie now, they (thoes bastards at Disney) woudl be waiting a long time to do the last 2. Plus, this book is so rich with detail they would have to enclude  every  detain to make the plot make sence. As with I Robot, you simply cant fit that much detail into 2 hours of film.  Whew! Im done untill next time, -Leslee
