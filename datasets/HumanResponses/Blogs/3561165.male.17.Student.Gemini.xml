      Hello, 'tis me again! My computer is currently kerfuffled with the connivingly calumnified (sorry, I was going along with the phonetic alliteration scheme) 'about:blank' malware, which is quite an unenviable thing to be, I'm seeking a solution to restore everything to good working order. This could plausibly include reformatting my hard drive if nothing else succeeds, so maybe no more updates for a while. My life is apparently shit, my Dad hasn't called me yet about my flight to Yankeeland and so I'm considering other places to go over the Summer. My poetry is coming along nicely, got six of the twenty poems which I want, two of which are posted here for your imbibement. I hope that at least one of my lines of pursuit succeeds, I don't want to be servite to someone else's whims and ultimately their bank statements, in a fucking office. I'm confident that I have more to offer to the world than slavery to an inheritant's cashpot, a capitalist ideal, two weeks a year of holiday and a wife, two kids and a semi in the leafy suburbs. Middle Britain, conservatism and a free copy of the Daily Mail at the Little Chef does not beckon. I'd rather die than work in an office, "swirling round in this familiar parable" as Maynard James Keenan might put it.  I'd also like to mention Glastonbury, which was in my eyes a triumph over the weekend on one front, and a dreadful failure on another. As some bloke out the Grauniad put it on Monday the whole things has been "embourgeoised" and with acts such as English National Opera could easily be regarded in the same vein as Glyndebourne. As much as I love opera (no, really I do, shut it you at the back) it doesn't quite fit into Michael Evis's fields, does it? Taking exception to that, lots of vibrant, exciting stuff at the festival, The Killers, Hope of the States, Muse, PJ Harvey, Goldie Lookin' Chain, The Stands (1-20 at the bookies that Noel watched, 20-1 that he watched from a balcony), The Stills, Snow Patrol, Franz Ferdinand, Scissor Sisters, hell even creaky old Morrissey pulled it off in style, among others. Paul McCartney was listenable and enjoyable, but the man is an insignificance to contemporary music as even though a lot of it has been deeply influenced by his work (Yes! That's right, I'm referring to Wings!), he isn't participant anymore and booking him to headline Saturday Night is pretty sad really. Lowpoints of the festival include Oasis massacreing 'My Generation', Oasis playing, the Lostprophet playing (okay, kudos to Watkins for saying that Oasis "suck", but then again I wouldn't be surprised if the corporate whore was willing to follow his marketing executives carrot into "parents suck", "homework sucks" and "avril lavigne sucks". Actually, no I think she does suck things*) and the Libertines and Radiohead not playing.  Mood: Phlegmatic and Gordon Brown-esque Music: Radiohead - My Iron Lung; Smiths - Girlfriend in a Coma; Scissor Sisters - Laura; System of a Down - Sugar; Razorlight - Golden Touch  *Tangential = Good

      Good afterevening fellows! Today I am going to be venerating the modern-day Coleridges of this world, namely, Omar and Cedric from the Mars Volta! Despite their music being fucking wondrous, and stuff, their lyrics leave an aftertaste not dissimilar to that off a piss-flavoured popsicle that you thought was made of appletise. "Exoskeletal", and shit. Just imagine if they were scousers, tee hee. As intellectually astounding as this apparent indifference to such rules of the english language as "syntax" and the conventionality of using words in order to articulate feelings and emptions, there is something afoot which is appreciably less-intellectual and that is George Orwell's brainchild, Big Brother. I don't care how many neuvo-artistes come out of the closet to apotheosise about this jumble of moronic fake-tan-clad shitbags incarcerated in front of the cash machine of cameras which will invariably loft them to fame, and then discard them to the scrapheap of Big Brothers eFourum, referring with "philosophical detachment" to the psychological incision of the human mind which this particular program allows. It's a morass of immorality, tedium and abjection, so as my latest victim of plagiarism would say, fuck it. Poor, poor, poor Mr Tribune.   In other moron related news, Oasis are headlining Friday Night at Glastonbury tonight. Only one Beatle-progeny is among their lineup tonight, oh well if a double-decker bus crashes into Noel, I'm sure Dhani Harrison will be more than affable to Liam's willingness to create the Beatles 2. They might as well change their name to the new Beatles, then change it back to Oasis in oh-so-Spinal-Tap-stylee. England were humiliatingly dumped out of Euro 2004 last night, which was a bit morose and shows just how superficial ye olde English game is, with Englands success being hinged upon an 18-year newbie, with a total dissolution of any sort of hope or forward-thinking once said newbie had been removed from the field. Bleugh, at this rate, we'll never win another major football tournament. Also Beckham was dire for the sum of the tournament, and he needs not only to lose his captaincy, but also be dropped entirely, as he was an embarassment to his team on the night and throughout the tournament. My randomly instinctual method of finding winners now leads me to the door of the "Cz-Czech it out" Republic.   In other news, been reading a bit of Descartes and a bit of Carl Jung, the latter being infinitively more interesting and engaging. I find a lot of his ideas about the way we behave in the world and behavioural complexes (through the supression of our own ideas, and our own realities and unrealities), love at first sight (anima/animus, you could say alongside the other archetypes), introversion and extroversion, collective unconscious and so forth. I'm in general agreeance with everything besides synchronicity and the collective unconscious, as I don't feel that they are substantiable. I presume that the majority of modern thinkers are in adherence with that, I certainly feel that his ideas have more weight to them than anything by Sigmund "I wanna shag my Mummy" Freud. Meh, poor Laura just said she erased her hard drive. Anyway, people I've ranted on for far too long, byeness.  Mood: Supportive (for Greece! Come on Greece! You are so Greecey!) Music: Hope of the States - The Black Amnesias; Tool - Aenema; The Ordinary Boys - Talk, Talk, Talk; Hope of the States - Black Dollar Bills.

      Yes indeedy, this is a new/old poem, some of you may find it very funny, others may not and Random Guy 342 will nigh certainly scorn it for being plagiarism. I think it's pretty fucking (ahem) innovative meself.  Fuck it (I don't want you back) by John Aziz  Tony Blair:   See I dont, know why, I liked you so much I gave you all, of my trust I told you, I loved you Now thats all down the drain Ya put me through pain I wanna let u know that I feel  Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now Fuck the presents might as well throw em out Fuck all those kisses, they didnt mean jack Fuck you, Chirac, I dont want you back  Jacques Chirac:  See I don't know why you cryin' like a bitch Talkin' shit like a snitch  Why you talk to Bush 'bout me If you really didn't care You wouldn't wanna share Tellin' Georgie Porgie just how you feel  Fuck what you did was it my fault somehow Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out Fuck all the cryin' you invaded Iraq Well guess what yo, fuck you right back

      Hola, people!  Welcome into the dark crevices of the mind of me! Firstly I would just like to say that the substantial majority of BNP supporters and other nationalists are mindless, ignorant fuckers! Romeo and Juliet people, (Deary me Ash's new video is drab and deplorable, innit?) love and humanity are transcendental of one's creed, colour, nationality and such. Yes, that's right, as if none of you were suspecting that. Also my Mother has a saliently-covered volume of cookie-flavoured conspiracy theories, in the shape of the new David Icke book! Yes, further reptilian conspiracies, hollow earth theorising, globalisation scare stories and turquoise shellsuits! My it's, like the Daily Mail, just with less immigrants! Actually, you've got to respect the guy, even if his ideas and theories are unsubstantiable and outlandish, he's certainly managed to rake in an audience for his collation of ancient myths, turquoise shellsuits, cyber punk and horror stories. So in closure of this update I'd like to big up David Icke, and maybe Pete Townshend too as The Who are magical. Best of fortune to the England team tonight, 'twould be nice if they won. Anyway, toodles.  Mood: Loopy, like Kellogs Fruit Loops Music: The Who - Saturday Nights Alright for Fighting; The Red Hot Chili Peppers - Emit Remmus; The Killers - Jenny was a friend of mine; Enigma - Sadness (Part 1)  This update sponsored by Kellogs Fruit Loops, Versace, JD Sports and Bertelsmann Music Group.

      Aha! My exams finally absolved (predictions: Maths - E; English Literature - B/A; History - A; Politics - B/A; Law - B/C), I enjoyed a joyous trip to London yesterday, complete with illicit substances, good music, oh yeah and a farcical minibus ride to nowhere! Richard and I arrived at the coach station at around 7:30 AM, only to discern that the ticketing office was closed. After panic, confusion and a jot of "oh fuck we're actually not going to end up anywhere", we waited the arrival of the coach. A minibus appeared, and the driver told us, in a stern and frankly-a-bit-obnoxious tone that nobody would be travelling unless 16 people were willing to go to London on the minibus, as the coach itself had been overbooked. We opted into volunteering for the minibus, and were the last two aboard, only to discover that there were only fifteen seats. The driver then helplessly chirped that I should stay on the minibus and Richard should wait for the coach. Well, it was a largely painful and unaccommodating ride, sat on a miniaturised seat, against a six-foot-something, twenty stone black fellow who habitually would stretch out his leg, forcing me half-off my already overcapacitated seat. Richard and I kept in contaxt via the nefarious art of the text message, which was painless. However, worryingly, once we arrived in London's vicinity it became glaringly and incensingly obvious that the driver was totally clueless and was utterly unaware of where Victoria coach station aboded. Richard arrived in London a good hour before I arrived at Victoria, via alighting the flummoxed moron at Trafalgar and catching an Arriva. With exception to that Carry-On-esque incident, the day went very well, Richard was suitably pleased with Camden, and our transactions went according to plan, got a lovely Hammer and Sickle T-Shirt, which I proudly sporting now. We had a very deep conversation about the world on the coach home, pertaining mostly anti-capitalism and communism, it's nice to know that our views our so parallel. I think a very fundamental part of my ideology now is anti-capitalism, insofar as that capitalism is inherently exploitative of both workers and consumers, in its profiteering. Workers because in a capitalist system it is requisite for people to participate in order to live, and consumers because the system articially fixes prices of essential items so that corporations can make a profit, and because the human psyche is exploited through the barrage of incessant advertising to hammer logos (for brand recognition purposes) into peoples crania, not to mention that this advertising malarky has meant that acceptance and success in society generally have to equate to material posession, which means that ordinary people not only have to participate in the capitalists game for sustenance, they also have to do so for gregarious purposes.   I think that I am forming a budding branch of my ideology, based on the principle that we live in a capitalist system, and so we need to work within the system to achieve a fairer world, and ultimately the world which we desire. Non-participation (however ideologically appealing this may be) is not an option, for obvious reasons, and so pragmatic and perspicacious capitalism, such as making donations to extreme-left parties, buying inexpensive clothing from non-branded producers, supporting fair trade organizations and positive decisions about who you buy what you need from are needed. I think if all were better enlightened about these issues, and opted to starve the large corporations from the funds they so desperately need to by buying from small producers, charity shops and unbranded companies, even if these means more personal cost to ourselves. We need to educate the apathetics and political non-participants. As I stated to Richard yesterday there is something fundamentally wrong with our current system and way of life, it is hollow, frivolous and superficial, not to mention directionless. Have a nice day.

      I have been working on my newest poetry anthology, which is going to have a very strong anti-war theme (cliched, but interesting!) for the past two days, anyway, here's a preview, I hope you find it unobjectionable:  The desert sands replete with emptiness Ring a song of coming unhallowedness A slick of oil cooly chases Across the runway, an island in ocean Where snakes are dolphins dancing Weaving their way across with subtle caution Zoom! A black crow of mechanical wizardry Shaped unnaturally to natures despite Unelasticated wings of hardness and coldness A raven rising to kill and slew Weaves over desert, an anodyne hunter Of human carrion and flesh and terror Swoops over down desert, disturbing the snakes And displacing sand rising, little snowflakes  The bird races and thunders and muscles Its way to the mountains and cities to hunt With voracity of a tiger and maybe a lion Starved both and all of food for a month It flails and swoops and flaps its wings Yet its wings give rise to something anew The packages cartwheel and fall asunder To limitlessly bite down onto the land The peaceful people are unwarned, unheeded To have their lives uproariously exploded And to taste the fruit of Thanatos' scythe Falling from trees Falling from the sky  Yet this assuages the people of the jetplane Who feel their safety is compromised And inhibitive action must be taken In the interests of dynamic counterterrorism And protect their culture of sickness and money To rip sinew from sinew Limb from limb All because  These people are different  Soldier In jet plane Undiminishedly unknowing of his victims or their friends or families or anyone

      Long time no update, I'm afraid to say, so if any of you were wishing for more of my extravagant language, mad rantings and general all around bullshit, then I apologise. Yesterday I went to London for my bi-monthly singing lesson, which went quite well, I've basically been warned not to attempt to sing anything above top C in my chest voice to avert causing serious damage to my chords. Which is at a discordance with my wishes, but all the same, I don't want to rid myself of the small amount of talent that I've got. Anyway, I paid a muchly joyous visit to Camden, which is in my eyes the coolest place on Earth. There were volunteers from various Communist groups collecting signatures to get Blair to resign, a treasure-trove of narcotic-selling shops, an amazing slection of authentic foods, music ranging from reggae, to punk, to techno to metal, to prog to hell and back. And severe paucity of townies, which is just lovely. The place has an inexplicable energy to it, the market is like a maze of humans, smells, stalls and other such things, something that you'd read about in a futuristic cyber-punk novel. The only cause of a disquietitude in me was the fact that this bustling centre of commerce is apparently a nexus of left-wing views (as shown by profusion of Communists), which is a bit ironic, maybe even slightly hypocritical. Also the looming presence of new developements of the capitalistic mall ilk contributes to a sense of unease in me, which wasn't there on my previous visit. Looks like although the old dog has life yet, all the truly cutting edge people are moving on. I've heard good things about New Cross, but it isn't even on the tube, so I'm not even gonna go there until it is proclaimed to be "The new Camden" in triplicate. I guess I feel a bit like Dick Whittington whenever I visit London, it has such a vibrancy that overawes anyone from a sad little town like Stoke. I might go to 'Marxism 2004', which seems exciting, costs £22 for the week and comes with free accomodation (what do you expect, from we Commies?) and includes such left-wing speakers as George Galloway, Tariq Aziz (how very hypocritical, seeing as the left unequivocally slated Saddam's torture and despotism up until Gulf War I), Tony Benn and China Mievile, who is a great novelist. The themes and discourses should be interesting, stimulating and thought-provoking.  Anyway, it looks likely that I shall be in Camden next week, as Richard and I may be going there to celebrate the absolution of our exams. I'll definitely take Oli with me there when we go to see Slipknot on his eighteenth.  Mood: Contemplative Music: Pink Floyd - Animals (LP)

      I first witnessed Bloc Party on March the 13th at a Graham Coxon gig, which was the first night of what I believe was their first ever national tour. I gave them a hard time, being the sadistic bastard that I am, asking Kele (Okereke, lead vocalist and guitarist) and co to spontaneously unleash some Radiohead, purely due to the fact that Russell (Lissack, co-lead guitarist) bears a striking similarity to Johnny Greenwood. Anyway, I thought they were wondrously good, and checked out their website after the gig, downloaded 'She's hearing Voices' and it has just gone on a mindboggling rollercoaster wild-ride since then. I've heard everything they have commercially released now and it has to be said that they're awe-striking. Just consummately original, and different and well, fresh. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is only the beginning and they are headed for the stratosphere, and I have thought this since March, so no I'm not bandwagon-jumping. Anyway, I have a sneaking suspicion that their ascendency is yet to fully realise, I predict that 'Little Thoughts', as the NME describes to be their "most melodic three minutes yet" will be Radio 1 C-listed on the 'morrow and is going to be their biggest hit yet.  Anyway, enough of my mad-ranting predictions, I did my examinations today and suffice to say that I failed my Maths and maybe with any fortune got an A in politics. History tomorrow which should be breeze when adjacent to the hellhole that is a Maths exam. Tongith should be an orgy of sweat (due to weather), good music (listening to Rush) and post Henman misery, rank five in the world my foot. I hate it when Henman plays it brings out the patriot in me, which I'm always trying to subvert, I get around it by reflecting it all onto "Oh I just like Tim Henman" which sounds ominously homosexual. Anyway I shall abash myself, happy reading, readers. Also obfuscate is my new favourite word, deary, deary me.  Mood: Disgustipated with Henman Music: Rush - What you're doing; Metallica - Welcome Home (Sanitarium); The Beatles - I am the Walrus; Bloc Party - Little Thoughts.

      Good morning my blog-ingesting friends, tomorrow I have another scarily worrying day of examination, Politics, which should be of no real worry, and then Mathematics Pure 1, which I am almost unquestionably going to score a U. This is due to lack of study during the year, so all culpability shall bear on me. I suppose I have a half chance of getting an E, so I had better do some revision anyway (neglecting politics and lowering me to a B) in order to negate complete failure. With a little bit of luck, I should still be on track for my three A's and my destined course forthwards to Oxford! Well, that's the theory, the resolution itself will probably throw myself onto an entirely different course of life. Probably end up with 2 A's and a B, well at least that could chance me into Exeter or somewhere modestly worthwhile like that. Well I shall depart, have a nice day.

      I would like to pronounce in lucidity that Peter Doherty is a man of unquestionable talent, and mastery. He has gone wayward of late, but his lapsing into episodic drug taking, petty crime and spells in prison has probably added more publicity and mystique to the Libertines convoluted path to here and now. Standing upon the verge of the Libertine's second album and after the top ten success of 'For Lovers' with the Wolfman (I'm sorry but I just can't resist the tantalising prospect of a Prokofiev pun), it would seem to be an exciting time to be a Libertines fan, especially with the usually unhyperbolic Mick Jones (Producer-in-chief of the record) declaring that 'The Man who would be King' possesses "as good lyrics as anything I have ever seen". The only song I'm fully conversant with is 'What Katie Did', and I have to say it is drool-worthy. In th Indie discos that I frequent, everybody's (okay perhaps not literally everyone but you get the picture) favourite band is the Libertines. Yet Doherty's tumultuous ride on the back of the dragon that is Rock 'n' Roll is leading him dangerously close to a mortician's glove. Some of my friends believe that this man would be deified in the same way that Cobain was 10 years ago, if he were to go in the same way, such is the gravity surrounding the band of late. Yet I send out this plea, which will probably be never read by the man himself, to not choose the path of self-destruction, torment, tempest and ultimately and untimely and sorrowful death. Pete, everyone loves you irrespective of your excesses and for the person that you are, not for your bank balance or your celebrity. You have truly swept tides of joy into countless lives up and down the country and all over the world. Your music has brought people back from the edge, it has polarised misery to elation and brought warmth to my heart. You were probably too overwhelmed in a morass of drugs to remember when I met you, but I called you a genius and my word is irrevocable, I do not retract that now. I for one do not want to have you as a memory, immortalised in incessant airplay instead of being here with those who love you most, creating more great music in the most libertine of places, car parks, nuclear bunkers, book shops toilets and whatnot. It would desecrate you if you were canonised with Kurt Cobain, and the vulture-doubters would gather round and pick holes in your legacy. I believe your place is here, but this is all about liberty. All I, and others can do is plead for you to stay with us. Pick the positive path (ooh Sun-esque alliteration).  Mood: Stern and plaintive Music: Black Sabbath - Evil Woman; Bloc Party - Little Thoughts; The Libertines - What Katie Did.

      Bonjour, and welcome to the inside of my head, circa 4:13 pm on the 7th of June 2004. I did my English Literature exam this morning, and it managed to be easier than I expected, if I'd done some revision and not gone off at wild tangents in the most inapt and frankly stupid places I might have got an A, but I'm still confident that with my safely A-graded coursework and a modestly inebriated examiner I can get a B, maybe even pushing an A. Next exam on my schedule is the laboriously titled Government and Politics, about how we're all apparently supposed to lick Mrs Thatchers arse and stuff and how she is the greatest politician since Winston Churchill. Sounds like an acid trip just minus the goodness. Actually in all seriousness I have found that thanks to Devendra Banhart's interview with a cluelessly moronic NME journo, I can trip out on all sorts of things, from the red paint on the walls of my room, to grass, trees curtains and various other things. All you have to do is look at them, in detail for a few seconds and it's like, woah, mini trip no tab required. I'm currently submerged in a textual conversation with my friend Richard, regarding Steve Vai (I fucking hate Whitesnake), cheap alcopops and racist comedians, such as the irremediably bad Jim Davidson, Bernard Manning and ilk. I hate text messages they fritter away money, not quite as seriously as a complusive gambling addiction, but it's still a slow but sure drain.In my trippy state of mind I just recalled an instance on Saturday when my lounge seemed like the nexus of a global firefly convention, which was a bit crazy, I tried innumerable times to clasp one or another between my hands with a deliciously onomatopeic squish, but to no avail. Richard tells me he spontaenously entered Focus (Middle Britain's favourite for low quality DIY) and purchased a plant, which he conveyed to his Mother. Anyway I have a ridiculously irritating urge to go and listen to the Velvet Underground now. Take care my crazed internet chums. Adieu, as the ghost in Hamlet says, Adieu, Adieu.  Mood: Trippy Music: The Bees - Wash in the Rain; Violent Femmes - Country Death Song; The Zutons - Pressure Point; The Mars Volta - Televators.

      Hello my nefariously anonymous readership, if you exist. Greetings, and various other nice things that I may have to say to you, my name is John Aziz, although you are probably aware of this already. As some of the more musically mindful amongst you may have noticed from my blog title I am fixatedly obsessed with all things Smiths related, and generally most rock music related stuff, with little exemption. I am a miserably despondent A-Level student, in hasty preparation for an examination tomorrow morning, which I think I can conclude that my lack of revision has been tantamount to failure. I'm studying (perhaps the past tense would be more appropriate, but assiduous I am not) the convoluted work of M. Shelley, 'Frankenstein', Arthur Miller's 'Salesman' and William Blake's 'songs'. All of these are divinely artistic and masterfully crafted (with the possible exception of Blake, our favourite colloquialist). I suppose my conquistadorias expectations of the metaphorical equivolent of El Dorado (i.e. easy questions) on the exam paper will be shattered with something intimidatingly oblique as "Victor Frankenstein is homosexual. Discuss" which will leave me agog and cause me to spontaneously combust and fail the examination paper. Ah well, as long as I can score A grade's in three of my five subjects (Rank ordered in terms of my likeliness to procure an A: History, Politics, English Literature, Law, Mathematics) I should be able to get entry to a half-worthwhile fountain of learning (layman's terms: University). Anyhoodles, I had better get back to staring gormlessly at my newly modified satrical pisstake Bush poster, now adorned with a napster-cat logo covering Georgie-Porgie-Pudding-and-Pies face. If any of you don't find this to be ironically funny, it is supposed to imply that Napster (once the symbol of freedom, liberty, unity and internet utopia) is simply another head of the capitalist Hydra, venomously sucking the life and expoliting ordinary humans. If you cannot work out why Bush is emblematic of the capitalistic system of expolitation and advantageousness then you should fuck off and read the Daily Mail. Have a pleasurable day and wish me luck in my exam.

      Nooooo.... I just posted and my post got lost in cyberspace. Oh well, I'll rearticulate what I just said. My cousin Amer was here on monday and Tuesday. He taught me an arabic scale called Hijaz, which is really interesting. I think he is an expert in Arabic music, he has been playing the Ud for thirteen years. I bought my new guitar today. It's shiny and red and a Stratocaster. I feel like Jimi Hendrix, just minus the ability to play the guitar! That'd mean I'm pretty fucking debilitated I guess;&nbsp;at least&nbsp;I can learn. I now need to get an amp when I get back to England and some funky pedals and maybe an Ebow or something and then I can prog out, man! I just went to some kind of festivity in downtown San Jose, it was boring and borgeoise and the music sucked, although the band (named the Hitmen) had a singer who sounded similar to the Godfather of Soul. You could easily equate them with Jazz-Funk-Soul-Lite;&nbsp;Norah Jones&nbsp;and Katie Melua mixed in with Prince, Kool and the Gang, the Isley Brothers, Miles Davies and James Brown all put in a blender&nbsp;with a good dose of shit-crowd pleasing cover versions. They did a good Jackson 5 cover, but that's about it.&nbsp;The upside of the evening&nbsp;however, was that I met out neighbour's son, Paul who is a DJ and has played the Berlin Love Parade. He seems like a cool guy, he knows England quite well and lived in Manchester for a while, where he tells me he knew Elbow before they were famous. There were a lot of resiliently and agedly wealthy old white men, dancing like morons, which was nice. This was coupled with a load of newly welathy Tech-execs trying to keep up with the gentrified. I guess that's Sunnyvale for you, there are quite a lot of boring old snobs, maybe not as bad as Palo Alto, but still. At least there were some cool liberal people there, like a hippy woman that I bought a crystal pendant from for $8. Chuck, our neighbour, and I had a good chat about politics on the way back. I guess one of the advantages of this land of pigs in cages on antibiotics is that at least most of the people (around here, anyway, and especially people like my Dad and Chuck) are well edified, and so make for&nbsp;decent conversation. Even the Republicans, dare I say it, seem to quite well-informed, so it makes for interesting discourse.  Speaking of politics, the Democratic convention is in course at the moment. Amongst the stolid&nbsp;and omnipresent&nbsp;Ted Kennedy, the vivacious&nbsp;Jimmy Carter the vibrant (but a bit greyed)&nbsp;Mr and prospective-President&nbsp;Mrs Clinton, as well as the big surprise of the week, Ronald Reagan Jr speaking in favour of stem cell research legalisation, the highlight has thus far been the dynamic, rambunctious and frankly-pretty-damn-awesome Al Sharpton. The man was like an inferno, he was ablaze and scintillating to watch. He was a man of integrity and conviction and spoke eloquently regarding the iniquities of Washington DC having no representation in Congress, the maltreatment of latino immigrants. Some might describe him as a loose cannon, but I feel he was speaking his beliefs and was totally unpretentious in doing so. There was so much electricity in the room it could have lit up Boston, the entirety of&nbsp;Masachussets&nbsp;and most of the inaugural thirteen states.

      Hey y'all, from the ranch. The cows are grazin', the beer is cold and my sharpshooter is goddang broke.&nbsp;My Dad wasn't too pleased about me calling him draconian and Bush-voting and stuff, so I rescind that. I don't think he'd vote for Bush on any issue except for all of them besides foreign policy! Anyway, sorry Dad. I had a fun time today, I was outside Home Depot (the poor man's home expo) and some Republican propaganda&nbsp;foo' asked me if I had registered to vote. Naturally, I took the opportunity to offload a good old "Hail to the thief, our commander-in-Chief!" and the imbecile decided to chime that my non-support of Bush shows me to somehow be uneducated ("little does he know" ~ my Stepmum"). If there are any fascists (i.e. Bush supporters) reading this I lay down the gauntlet for you to prove this guy right, and show us all how supporting Bush&nbsp;equates ter&nbsp;erudition and vice verse. Anyway, that incident of Republican idiocy&nbsp;humoured me, so I'm in a good mood.   I've been pissing around with an array of instruments from guitars, to pianos and so forth, which has been fun. I'm trying to write something with vibrancy, something that sounds fresh and interesting. I was at the home of a friend of my parents last night and I was watching music videos with their kids, who had a propensity for low-grade repetitious pop-crap. That stuff excoriates me, I can feel my flesh seethe as it cuts its way into my self. It motivates me to stand on my own two feet and do better, both in commercial terms (which seems to be the gauge of success in this revolting world)&nbsp;and primarily in artistic terms. I don't know if I can do better, but it would rile me if I could not do so. Anyway,&nbsp;I'm gonna apply for a job when I get back. Someday we'll meet again,&nbsp;don't know where don't know when, as they say in Albion. I can't be arsed to post much more on here, maybe my interest will be rekindled in a week or so.  Mood: Sombre Music: Some Lebanese&nbsp;reactionary-political singer. How dull.

      Hee hee, just a very expedient update this time to tell y'all something very funny that I just noticed...   My Dad just looked at my Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric Ladyland CD, then gave me a very funny look and said: "With your hair are you trying to imitate someone?" Well, naturally I was quite chuffed that he compared my hair to Hendrix's (although from him it was quite a derogatory comment,&nbsp;being the&nbsp;bloodthirsty Neo-Con that he is,&nbsp;but all the same), but he keeps on telling me to have a haircut, and being the bloodthirsty Neo-Con that he is (did I&nbsp;mention that he was bloodthirsty, draconian, Bush-voting&nbsp;NeoCon?) that means I'm probably going to get a shave.

      Yeah, I'm here in yankeedoodledandy land. This part of the US, (the SF bay area) basically encapsulates everything I hate about the world. It is a hotbed a rich corporate executives with perms (yuk), SUV's, $200,000 salaries,&nbsp;minivans, and homes with white picket fences. The American dream. Except all this wealth just makes the less wealthy parts of the world seem poorer, it makes anyone who has traveled south of Gilroy notice that this little corner of bliss is only rich because it sucks natural resources and labour from less wealthy climes. The whole place looks&nbsp;morose and lifeless, with successions of track homes littered hither and thither, with trees which look fake and plastic and tree-like&nbsp;(ahem, don't sue me for plagiarism Thom, please?).&nbsp;No character, no vivacity just blue sky and falseness. There seems to be a great deal of keeping up with the Jones's and a great deal of pretension. My Dad and Stepmum complain all the time about my messiness and my unwillingness to help keep up the false shine on their floors which gives the impression that somehow they are worthy. I think the American Dream is very unwholesome, material acquisition just seems to be a very superficial way to fulfil yourself. But it keeps these people happy, for now. One day America will implode, but for today we must just countenance its tentacles reaching out and sucking the blood out of&nbsp; ordinary people. This country is what makes Stoke-on-Trent the tip that it&nbsp;is, this country pollutes the visions of the billions worldwide with its inexorable greed. Mass production methods have robbed millions of their livelihoods by introducing cheaper production methods to undercut those of ordinary farmers. Oh well, it's a rather pleasing feeling to know that&nbsp;China (I might consider that regime&nbsp;hypocrites, but none-the-less)&nbsp;&nbsp;will eventually do the same to America, but I suppose that the People's Republic will also capture America's economic pre-eminence and we will have another super-power which will be able to exert its will around the world in order to expand its markets. Ah well, a little competition is always a good thing, as they say. Anyway, I'm probably boring you with silly leftish-economics. I spent a pleasant day in San Francisco on Thursday. Because I don't have too many friends over here I felt the solitude press in against me, but they had a load of listening pods and an expansive import section (American music blows asshole), so I listened to my usual diet of prog-indie-pop-metal, the Pixies, Razorlight, the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Muse, Lorretta Lynn, The Stills, The Cure and a plethora of other good stuff. Anyway, love ya'll loads  Mood: Need...... coffeeeeeeeeeeeee....... nooooooooooooooowwwzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZ Music: The wind (it's kinda bluestery), but earlier I was listening to Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric Ladyland (LP) Quote of the Day:  "I can't listen to too much Wagner, I keep getting the urge to conquer Poland" ~ Woody Allen "Pig&nbsp;first, flowers later" (bleugh, it's a weird metaphor that I like) ~ kid on Dragon Tales&nbsp;

      Had a fun couple of days with Richard, besides a bellicose, brusque bastardised bus driver and my flippant Mother being a pain in the derriere. Played Sonic and Knuckles profusely. We had a succession of interesting and&nbsp;worthwhile conversations, as we always do. I feel warm and fuzzy inside, because I did something selfless for once and&nbsp;slept on the floor.&nbsp;David phoned and told me he has aquired Avril Lavigne's new album, which is nice. It'll be good to see all my friends when I get back home from America,&nbsp;for all their merits and demerits.&nbsp;Due to my decadence and irresponsibility I've had to go to extreme measures to acquire enough money to purchase a coach ticket to get to Birmingham tonight. Oh yes, that's right I'm zooming to America to visit my Father tonight&nbsp;and for much of tomorrow. I intend upon getting utterly plastered on the flight, it'll disenvenom (is that even a word? If it is, I like it!) the experience and tedium of sitting for eleven hours, stationary.&nbsp; I'm so very tired, I feel like I could sleep for a month, I feel completely vacuous and thinly-spread. I'll update my journal soon I guess, when I'm in America.  &nbsp; Mood: Maybe one day my cavalier approach to life will pay off.

      Hello everybody, it's nice to talk to you again. This week has been about as unindustrious as it is possible to be without being an overpayed actor or an NME writer. I spent Monday and Tuesday night decamped on the futon in Oli's room watching music videos, and Wednesday and yesterday were expent in a similarly slobbish fashion. Any kind of productive thoughts within my mind have been abnegated by the dull thudding pleasure of sitting around on one's arse.&nbsp; How borgeoise, how boring. Yesterday however, was a revelation for me in another sense. I began replaying Sonic and Knuckles, which in my eyes is unparalleled in its achievements as a 2D platformer. The expanse, vision, ideas and the music (Lava Reef zone!) are mindblowingly good, even after all these years. The only criticable area is that of the length of the game, which could be better (somewhat ameliorated by the fact that there are two selectable characters, but still), but I'm not gonna lambaste what I consider to be a salaciously lovely game. I intend upon playing all four of the Mega Drive platformers, and upon their completion by tonight. I've also downloaded the Razorlight album, and the Ordinary Boys album, which are both good, the latter being the Britpop revival which it is claimed to be. After ten years, britpop seems quite&nbsp;pointless and quite banal now. I guess the world was more receptive due to the comedown after the flighty heights of acid house, and the breakup of the Stone Roses; people were taking ecstacy by the wheel-barrow load, no wonder they were dejected and just willed to be 'ordinary'. Also, I've had a major computer cleanout with some fun administrative tools. Deleted erroneous links in the registry, cleaned out the recycler, gone through with ad-aware about three time, cleaned up links on my desktop, uninstalled a load of unused programs, defragmented the hard drive, etc etc. I think it has reclaimed me in the region of 5Gb of space, which is extremely welcome considering that my music collection is soon going to be overspilling over to my D drive. Makes quite a change from a couple of weeks ago when my computer was a spyware whore, infected with the Parite. B virus and basically fucked. I didn't watch the BNP programme on BBC2 last night, I think I'm fully conversant with the fact they're racists and I don't need substantiation to enfore the fact that their preposterous claims of not being racist are untrue. Anyway, Sonic calls.

      Hey y'all. I was amid writing an update last night which got to 865 words and I was about 1/3 of the way through so I've put it aside, may publish it on here at some point. It's basically my opinions on America, which I chose to do because of the furore around Farenheit 9/11, and I've just finished dissecting the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and asserting what I agree with, what I disagree with and so forth. Now I'm gonna write a section of how America has deviated from its initial ideal and is something entirely disparate to what it set out to be. So I guess it has turned into something almost essay-ish. It's not a great work, but I'm enjoying writing it and distinguishing what my opinions on America actually are. Anyhoodles, I bought the 'Morning Star' newspaper this mourn, and was ashamed to discover that it is nothing more than a tabloid, a (much) more left-oriented version of the Sun. All the same, it has some fun stuff in, such as a column on Australian racial apartheid by the muchly venerable John Pilger. Alongside this, it provides a very non-mainstream perspective on events, and it reports what goes unreported in the press. "For peace and socialism", as they themselves say :)  I'd like to take this opportunity to accord myself with the International Court of Justice, in denouncing Israel's illegal occupation of the West Bank, encouraging their imminent withdrawl from Gaza, and the dismantling of the illegitimate, immoral and repugnant land-grabbing of the wall. Furthermore, I'd like to denounce Hamas and Islamic Jihad for sending suicide bombers into Israel to kill civilian Israeli's, which just exacerbates the situation. This war needs to be ended, now, it nauseates me that both sides are foolishly squabbling over land. I'm not going to go as far as Mordechai Vanunu and question Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign state, but I feel that any nation which kills, maims, oppresses, sectarianises (sp?) and subjugates needs to be cajoled into discontinuing such practices through trade embargoes. Anyway, peace out!  Mood: I'm okay Music: Smashing Pumpkins - Gish (LP); Radiohead - OK Computer (LP) Quote of the Day: "Forgotten genres get rehashed, create the craze, create the cash" ~ The Ordinary Boys ('The List Goes on', a track from 'Over the counter culture')

      Hi! Went to see Babyshambles last night, a suffusion of pleasure, pain and enough sensual stimulation to match the Anne Summers summer 2004 catalogue. The support acts were worthwhile, Wolfman and the Irish woman who played with Pete were fantastic, and Pete trounced the performance which he put on last time around, which frankly was an overhyped, under-ticketed bubble-bursting. The highlights were the ridiculously energetic and totaly-fucking-amazing "Wolfman", the haunting "For Lovers", anthemic "What a waster" (basically epitomises everything the Libertines, Babyshambles and Pete Doherty is all about) and "I'm in love with a feeling". NB, if anyone wants to correct me on the title of the latter, please do as I'm not assured that taht is its title. I arduously wish that Pete would "exorcise his inner demons" (his words, not mine), get clean and reattach himself to the Libertines, who are surely the most exciting and tempestuous band since Jack White first laid his paws on Jason Stollsteimers gullet. Best of luck with whatever line of rehab you take, Pete, for as my co-Libertines fan Steve said to me on Tuesday morning, I don't think any bona fide Libs liker wants the Nirvana-esque hyperbole which has exponentiated around Kurt Cobain's coffin to blossom around Pete's coffin, as it assuredly will as soon as he gets his perversely unglamorous deathwish which he appears to will upon himself. Let's hope that his words "I don't take enough drugs to kill me" resonate true.  Anyway, enough of that. I'm currently working on a song called 'The Priest', to add to the ranks of 'Let's burn money', 'Where are you', 'Sickly on Love Pts 1 and 2', "I am a scelestious man", 'Walking with angels' (formerly titled inspiration), and various other stuff which I have written and am currently purporting to make coherent and good. I'd like to have an album or twos worth of material written and demoed before we even start doing gigs, I want to take this whole thing methodically and rationally and thus lower the risk of failure. I've kinda binned the idea of a song called "The Village Idiot", may return to it at a later date and totally rewrite it. I wanna sound like a cross between Black Sabbath, Radiohead, sort of art-prog rock/metal. "The Priest" is indubitably punky I can't classify it in any other way, but believe me this is formulated, premeditated and a concerted attack on the establishment, John Lydon style. Cut the nonsensical trash, this is not formulaic modern punk, I think I've got it down to the essence of what punk is and what punk should be, and I have bolstered the power and lyrical venom with a quite unconventional song structure. Anyhoodles I want a trendy businesswoman girlfriend. Actually no, wait I don't but I'd like a girlfriend. Being an introverted, articulate (though I say so myself) Radiohead fan with a floppy fringe, floppy stomach and a Commie beret hardly helps matters, does it now?  Mood: Effusive! Music: The White Stripes - Black Math; Black Sabbath - Sleeping Village; The Velvet Underground - Femme Fatale; Babyshambles (feat. Wolfman?) - Wolfman.

      All I can say is, "Oh my fucking God how scintillatingly and perturbingly sexy was seeing Greece win Euro 2004". Yep, if you hadn't guessed by the topic (which you'd have to be pretty retarded, or rock-encompassed to not do so), I am celebrating the wizardry and nigh pant-wetting excitement of Greece's victory! Woo! Anyway, my life is slightly better, my computer is debunked of spyware, and it seems modestly likely I'll be painting with my Dad in America this time next week, or next two weeks. I think college is still on tomorrow, not utterly sure, but I'll go and hang out anyway, if there are no lessons I'll just return home for some "we talk, uKIP".  Anyway, this is a horribly short update, but I have very little to say, no ideological ramblings or musings, no band-related hyperbole or enthusings.

      Hey y'all. It's approaching 10pm and I am sitting enshrouded in darkness at my Father's computer. My life has been pretty vapid and unscintillating of late, and so continues this trend. It's Thursday night, and I leave for yonder shores (i.e. England!) on Sunday, the day of the Sun. I've just been basically hanging out, concocting songs in my head, playing keyboard and guitar, all the usual stuff. I've whiled away my time babbling nonsense to people on MSN, just a load of dreary hot air about rubbish, and music. Mostly rubbish. Okay, I confess, this post has one solitary purpose, to post a quotation that I just found from George W. Bush.  It's good to know that my journal now has the contrivance of "quote of the day".  I'm getting on better now with my Stepmum and my Father, which is nice.  When my sleep finally overcomes my brother we're gonna watch 'The Battle of Algiers', which will be nice. It's in black and white, and French so it should be nice and hideously dodgy. Anyway, that is my post consummated. Good night, I probably won't post again until I am ensconced firmly back in England.  Mood: Wretched Music: Metallica - Wherever I may Roam; System of a Down - Needles; Quote of the Day: "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful - and so are we.

      Long time since I've updated this old mule of a chronicle of the adventures of me. I read the bulk of 'The Life of Pi' again yesterday, which was enjoyable. That book, I must say, almost managed to make me theistic, which I can say of no other literary, theological or other work. I'm not going to endelve into why and how and stuff, just read the book and no matter how atheistic you are, I am fairly adamant that by the end, you well see a new slant on the whole 'God' thing. I still need to start 'War and Peace'. I've had the book for about six months and it hasn't yet unfurled itself to my grubby paws, it judt looks, well, superfluous. I brought it to Yankee-doodle-dandy-land with the intention of reading it in the slumberly hours that I am spending in my bedroom tinkering with my guitar and keyboard in the vain hope that somehow from amongst the crude bulk of my form the genius that I have always believed is in me will reveal itself. The only problem being that it is failing to do so. Oh well, musn't whinge, either way. I also have decided that I can call myself an existentialist, because I looked up what it meant. I 've always (well, not literally) had a faint inkling of its meaning just never been able to definitively say . Yay, go me, I'm special. Also I learned a new word today; symbiotic. I'm doubly special, as the Doctor who diagnosed me as clinically insane once enthused. I've been excercising quite a bit too, in lieu of anything else to do.  I've been studying reams more of music theory, which hasn't been too pleasant. It all makes sense, but making it intuitive; the idea that when one plays a B followed by a C, it is a diminished second does not become instinctual very easily in a mind so encumbered by junk as my own. I guess I'm too self-concious about stuff like that, I could get neurotic about it. Speaking of neuroses, it seems that everyone in this country is on drugs of one kind or another, be they illicit, perscription or whatever. I know that that is perceptual and is making a ludicrous stereotype on the basis of little or no information, but all the same. I've never really become too immured in any type of druggery, especially not one involving cheap, ineffectual prescription drugs. The rule of the thumb, it appears is that we take a drug, and we feel better, with no consideration of any adverse side-effects or whatnot. So really, with the multiplicity of drugs that people love to ingest, we sicken ourselves by curing ourselves. We cure any maladies by supressing them with drugs which then go and invoke more maladies! Yay! Whatever happened to a good old six months of convalescence in a nunnery with the treatment of hot water, lemon n' honey and St. Johns wart? Oh well, that's life people want immediacy then they just create fleeting fixes and fuck themselves fully in the long run.  Anyway, I'm waffling now, aren't I. I'm just scribbling (well, not strictly scribbling, but all the same) an extended polemic of nonsense with no real purpose, simply because my life in this land of Messiah's, Morphine and Money is listless and awful. Bleugh.

Heroism at command, senseless brutality, deplorable love-of-country stance, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action! It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder." ~ Albert Einstein  Woo, three long quotations today, that's cool.  Oh, 'twas my Mothers birthday yesterday and the anniversary of Hiroshima deathday, which both happened 59 years ago. Happy birthday and deathday Mum and Hiroshima people! And to think Gen. MacArthur wanted to nuke China for supporting the Vietcong.

      I may have mentioned this to various people prior to this, but I just want to make a point concerning the Curfew laws which have permeated the statute books in Sunnyvale, and other parts of the US, following a dialogue I had with my Stepmum. These laws are ridiculous and illiberal. They, in simple terms, stipulate that persons aged under eighteen years are not permitted to be on the streets after the hour of 10 o'clock and their parents are prosecutable if this legislation is transgressed. They reasoning behind this is that prior to the predication of this law, the streets were a lawless jungle of teenagers who were unfettered in, and prone to breaking the law. This law makes a number presuppositions which I shall detail and disassemble here:  1) Persons under the age of eighteen are prone to breaking the law and are more likely to break the law than persons of an older age. 2) Thus this law insinuates that it is acceptable to cut the civil liberties of an especial demographic, if this demographic is particularly likely to break the law. 3) Persons under the age of eighteen are irresponsible and thus cannot be prosecuted for their own actions. 4) Thus persons under the age of eighteen are unequal citizens with a different set of rights and responsibility than their elders. 5) Ultimately, concerns raised by presuppositions 2 and 4 repudiate each other in that because persons under the age of eighteen are essentially unequal in the eyes of the law, it does not effect their overall position if some of their non-fundamental rights are cut; in other words they do not have the responsibilities so they should not have the rights.  Okay, I'm sure that many people, and this includes myself, appreciate the fact that the streets of Sunnyvale are a much safer place than prior to the imposition of this curfew. However, Laws of this kind are, as I stated earlier illiberal in their nature and merely lead to indignation and ire among those who are discriminated against by these laws, even if they have superficial benefits. The laws criminalise an entire section of the population without any founding or criminal action besides presence; it has been determined in courts of Law at many junctures that presence cannot constitute a crime. Detractors of my stance would say that because I do not have the responsibilities, I do not deserve the legal rights. I find this to be a very immature stance; it is quite clear that from the age of fourteen or fifteen (in British law with which I am familiar the age of the inception criminal liability is eleven) it is possible for criminal intension to be formed and therefore with this capacity comes the capacity for criminal liability and responsibility.  Indeed, this country of the USA has imposed criminal responsibility to those under the age of eighteen and has carried out death sentences on those under the age of eighteen at the time of the comission of the crime (in transgression of international human rights treaties, but all the same) and then is reticent in allowing persons under the age of eighteen to, in the eyes of the Law to have the same rights as those aged over eighteen, to whom the same responsibilities are (generally) imposed is extremely hypocritical. This country is built upon the premise of equal rights for all, and I quote (from paragraph 2 of the declaration of Independence):  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"  Contrast this statement with the aforementioned curfew law and it becomes fairly unequivocal that this Law is wrong in that persons with equally responsibilities in terms of criminality are not given equal rights.  Therefore, it is clear to me that the best course of pursuit for areas plagued by misbehaviour of a few is to prosecute them for their crimes and not illegitimately punish the innocent. Preventative laws such as this are merely reactionary and in this sense are very dangerous and illiberal. It is a shame that laws such as this can be formulated, by reactionary politicians serving the cause of the miopic mildly-conservative majority. In particular regard to this Law, it is because childrens and young adults interests and grossly under-represented on a political level in Britain and in the United States. With the exception of childrens charities (NSPCC, etc) and pressure groups they get no representation because they are inelligible for election. I am not stating that children should be able to win election to bodies of Government, I am merely saying that Government's and Governmental positions should take childrens interests more to heart, they are after all part of the populace. The fact that they do not have the vote means that politicians and candidates do not need to win their support, and this in turn leads to disengagement. Again, I am not saying that it would be, for reason immaterial to my point, pertinent to confer the vote to people under the age of sixteen or eighteen, I am just saying that elected official should merely listen to the voices of the unrepresented majority among this demographic before making reactionary laws.  Anyway, in closure I hope you agree that laws of this sort are pretty Machiavellian and stuff. All I, and many others like me expects is parity with those aged above me in terms of both rights and responsibilities in the eyes of the Law. If those with criminal liability (in this case, in British law, those aged 11-17, and the equivalent in American law and so forth) behave in a law-abiding fashion, they should be treated with respect, if they are not then the full weight of the law should come down upon them. If you got this far, thanks for reading, I didn't really intend this to be for everyone's digestion, I was just venting my opinion on something which I feel is very unjust.
