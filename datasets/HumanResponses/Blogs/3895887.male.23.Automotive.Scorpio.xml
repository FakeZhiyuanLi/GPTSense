      Well, this is my fourth attempt to write something meaningful!My first was going strong at 1000 words , my second was one better, it was going decetly at around 700 words, third one wa s ajoke, had gone thro 3 lines and well, dont ask me about it!! Its amazing how easy things can be wiped off from their existence when you have a Samurai sword.All you have to do hold it with both your hands, firmly, with right hand above the left one(thats because I am a right hander) and raise the sword to a height where your palms and your ears are at the same WL(hehehe!!!) take a deep breath and take one swing at everything gets erased, all my blogs met the same end!!It was as easy as Command A and delete!! My earlier blogs were about issues which were affecting humankind!INfact they still are!!From Darfur to Saddam's stroke, from Kerry's demcrats circus to shortage of water supply in Bangalore which resulted in a suicide of a former Miss India!!Sorry, it was too tempting to be so insensitive!!So it was all going well, with my usual blasting of everybody in this world, their impotence, their excuse for survival etc, but it all got too boring, and my Moby Dick also got over, had to switch to Interstate love song and hence switch the blog!! Its amazing the feeling when you are blogging!You want other people to read your blog but when you are actually writing it, you are writing for yourself.It is a kind of normal drawn from your brain to the world inall directions, but what really concerns is that it is all converging right inside your brain!And if the theory of a spherical universe is true(I am not doubting the Hawkins man here, at all) it should all diverge inside my brain itself!!Its so amazing!!The feeling!!  I was just telling a friend of mine, it is absolutely ok to talk about something which does not exist and which has no meaning in totality rather than talk about something which has some meaning momentarily only for the sake of talking!!Everything in this universe has to converge at absolute nothingnesss!!thats the philosophy. Thats the shit! OK, before I pick up my Samurai sword and let myself do another swoosh, I am going to publish this!!

      Now that Schumacher has won another race, yet another senate report saying that USA did not have evidence of WMDs in Iraq,the Sun will rise in the east tomorrow,  and everything else is going to go just fine!! What a week to look forward too!!Well, every week has something to look forward too!! Last week was just probably one of the other kind! The week started off with the 10 men defending team Greece winning the Euro 2004, but got a bit better with an interesting headline on the Times Of India !! Man dies watching Girlfriend: Well, for novices, Girlfriend is supposedly a sleazy movie about lesbian relationship back at my home, India. Well, back there a lot of directors are a wannabe type. In the name of portraying what happens in the Indian society, they make all these movies, to create some kind of cheap publicity and make a quick buck or so and enter into the niche director club. But, I prefer to  call that' Oh!! I messed up' club, because I have full trust on the Shivsena( a belligerent group in Mumbai, the home of Bollywood, who believe that eating burgers is going to kill the Indian Culture, they want McDonald to sell their burgers by calling them Vadapaav instead)and likes! Those people just will not allow these kind of things to happen in the land of Khajurao, or the Kamasutra!   Well, coming back to the headline about the man who died watching Girlfriend, TOI has surely taken a good dig at the movie. As the critics say, movie will go down as one of the worst Bollywood has ever made(wait, aren't most of the movies at Bollywood going down the drain?) anyways, TOI did show that they still had the better side of humor. Especially after the complete epic coverage of a stupid marriage in Europe of the Mittals, where they went to an extent to say what color Saree did the Mittal bride get from the groom's mousa's behanji's uncle? Whether Kylie Monogue likes Tandoori Chicken or does she prefer the Naorathan Kurma with her zero cholesterol Butter Roti!!(TOI did this, trust me) And not to mention their complete Budget coverage!!My God!!That was a total shamble. They had 8 pages running only on the budget!! They went to an extent to ask Mr Bhaichang Bhutia(who cannot play the ball properly, let alone give expert comments on Portugal 2004) his opinions about the Budget. The Budget was made to look like a conny movie about an orphan kid picked up by Quick Gun Murugan raising him with inputs from Jaspal Bhatti and his aunt who has just come back from the Canada and obviously the ever smoking, pawn chewing Bengali uncle ! Poor Chidambaram, not enough that he has to walk the tight rope at the coalition, now he has to woo the media with dialogues from latest Hritik Roshan movies!! So amidst all these, yet another Schumacher victory without me watching anything live!!Left alone to watch the  formula 1 One Website for live timings!It is not fun, I can tell you this. But a fan like me, who has nothing to do in life either can do that for 4 hours in a week/fortnight, qualifying and the race! So its back to the 'What it is Monday, where in the weekend?' blues for me. Back to the reality of why I have come to Japan, wait for the day to get over, come back from work and surf the net for more crazy news headlines!! Lets see what's in store!
