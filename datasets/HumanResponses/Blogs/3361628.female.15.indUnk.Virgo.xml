      Yes, thats right, sun-scorched. It would be a MAJOR understatement to say that i was just sun burned...the beach was fun thou. Yesterday was the first day of summer and i was awake at freaking 8 in the morning!!! Then we picked up Kaysi and headed to Galvestion for a fun day of "beaching" with the Mareks and Rollwitz. First we had to stop at Wal-Mart to get ice or something(i dont remember why we stoped) but while we were there i saw ALISSA who i hadnt seen in seriouly FOR-EVER!! It was exciting. but not as exciting as the car ride to Galvestion: Not only did we have a radio and our cd players, but we got to here live hunter playing "hot cross buns" on the recorder while harry sang to it. THE WHOLE ENTIRE WAY THERE THEY DID THAT!!!! OK..i can understand singing it maybe..but is the recorder really necessary!? or if your going to bring it, please learn other songs!! ah, yea..that was umm fun?! but then when we got to galvestion my mom made hunter leave the recorder in the car..which was DEFFINETLY a good thing! the beach was fun. i didnt get stung by any jellys, kaysi and natalie did thou. But what i didnt have in stings i more then made up in burns. Its Sucks!! hurts SOO BAD. My Face and sholders are blistering and red! WAYY ROUGH! The ride home was also very um...humerous?! I made the mistake of make the "Honk Your Horn" sign when we pasted this big truck..only he didnt honk! But then i had to explain to hunter and harry what i was doing..and of-course they had to do it to every single truck that went by. Only they did it wrong..instead of pulling down harry was shaking his fist at every truck! then i think he said the funniest thing in the world! ok so there was this regular pick up truck next to us FULL of mexican's, i seriouly dont know how they do that, very talented those mexicans. but yea so harry all making the fist and knocking on the window trying to get these guys to honk. so i was like harry, your only supposed to do it to big trucks that are carrying alot of things. and then he goes..it IS carrying alot of things!! its carrying 6 mexicans in the back!!!!! HAHAHA OMG! i seriouly thought i was going to die! Funniest thing EVER!! haha but yea, i'm really not feeling good bc i'm my burns so i'm out for now! i'll post laterr, bbyeee

      ITS SUMMER!!! wow! i seriously dont think that the year could've gone by any faster!!! So many different things happened nad i cant even think back to when each thing happened bc it all just seems like a blur. I dont even feel pumped that its summer bc it doesnt feel like it yet. today was my last day of school and it was SO WEIRD bc no one was at school and i'm used to the last day being with everyone and taking pictures and being excited but yea..not today! i woke up at 7:05 today, brushed my teeth and put my hair up and then left the house at 7:15 and took my world geo final came home and went back to sleep unitl kaysi called me from her journalism class! that was fun, but they were watching a movie and my phone was dying...so yea..that was a quick conversation. Last night i went out to eat with natalie and her family to celebrate her sister Molly's awards from school..only Molly didnt even get to go to her own awards dinner bc she had soccer. I thought that was FLIPPING halorious! on the way to Fudruckers we say 2 car wrecks, both to which her sister haley had a million and one questions that we had no answers too. Then haley asked to play a game on my phone...which sparked our next very funny converstaion! Nats mom told us about how ealier that day at the doctors office she had been trying to play snake and couldnt figure it out! i konw your sitting there like yes, ok and thats not funny at all..but trust me..it was! Then we got there and her dad was there and the funny things just kept a'rollin. He has got to be the funniest man that i know. the things he brings up makes me wonder..but yes...it was funny. I think i would enjoy eating dinner with them all the time bc they talk about funny things! but yea, nothing else new is really going on. but i think i'm going to go out side and go swimming!! byee!

Next week will be nice..except for finals..but i get out early on 3 of the 4 days!! so like it, i like it alot. I got my new glasses yesterday and today zach told me i looked really smart..and considering he's a freaking genius..i liked that comment. So now i look smart! While i'm excited for summer, the end of school also means that people graduate and leave...which is very sad!! i'm going to miss lots of people((Allison, Meghan, Alissa and everyone else)). But next year will be fun!! i'm excited!! I will no longer be a fishy freshman!! i'll be 16 in september!! I'll be in my last year of latin!! and i will no longer be in Mr. Bennetts class!! unless i get him AGAIN for us history..which i PRAY doesnt happen...although by now i know his tricks so if it does happen it shouldnt be to hard...i hope. oh well he's old and he needs to retire!!! ahh, ok well i gotta go get my studyin' on! heh..FUN. byeee

      HOLY COW!! i got back from camp today..its was so awesome!! i had so much fun!! At first i wasnt to excited about going and Allie and i were counting downt the hours from the moment we got there..but then it got fun! There was this virus going around camp thou which super sucked!! Rachel got sick first on tuesday and then 11 other youth leaders and many more campers and leaders, it was quite rough..but i didnt get sick..yet..knock on wood haha kristin. But yeah, i got to know that crazy girl kristin, we were only in the same seminary class for a whole freaking year and only spoke once..and then came to camp and got to konw each other in like 3 days...its crazy!! there were so many ppl that go to klein and seminary in my building that i had never even seen before!! But i think you meet certain ppl at certain times for a reason, so its cool!! We had some freaking haliarious times!! Mostly laughing with/at Stacia..She is seriouly one of the funniest and most random ppl i know! i love her!! The Fourth years always put on a big play thing on thursday nite, so mostly we worked on that. it was fun, and it turned out really well! everyone cried!! Thursday is always my favorite nite bc its testomony nite. i really wanted to have testomonies with all the 4th years but we had to go with our ward, so we were gona ahve a 4th year testomony meeting after but yea..ppl got sick. I think my new Favorite song is You Raise Me Up by Josh Groban! we listened to it many times and it was the music for the slideshow..makes me cry but i love that song!!!! basically camp was just amazing! I'm SO glad i went, it made me realize that everything happens for a reason, and wow! i learnded and grown so much just in one week its crazy...but i like it! everything makes sence now, all the things i had been struggling with and thinking about are all clear! its awesome! the little things i always that mattered the most dont seem as important to me anymore..i dont really konw why, but idk, its kinda like my priorities are different now, for the better. but yea, i'm not feeling really great right now, so i'm gona go lay down..hope i'm not getting sick..but if i do..then its off to kristins to play sonic the hegdechog(spell??) on SEGA!! :) hahaha! i'll post later --laur

      Today is gonna be the day That they're gonna throw it back to you By now you should've somehow Realized what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now  Backbeat the word was on the street That the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before But you never really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody feels The way I do about you now  And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would Like to say to you but I don't know how  Because maybe You're gonna be the one who saves me  And after all You're my wonderwall  Today was gonna be the day But they'll never throw it back to you By now you should've somehow Realized what you're not to do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do About you now  And all the roads that lead to you were winding And all the lights that light the way are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you I don't know how  I said maybe You're gonna be the one who saves me  And after all You're my wonderwall....
