      Argh, Sometimes choices are made for reasons, but there the hardest things in life. My boyfriend and I have been going out for 3 days now, and I feel a major connection, but...I am so broken between ... Ever since my Dad passed away, I haven't been good with Relationships, and I feel so bad becuase I love this guy but, I don't want to date, I just don't know how to put it to him...He's so funny and nice...I feel if I tell him and make him wait for me, He will never want me...ever... and he will go back to his Psyco EX! I mean I still want him, but not right now, and he shouldn't have to wait for me again...So I guess I can't tell him, if your reading this, don't hate me, I still have love for you but not right now, I need time at least give me a Year, then maybe I will mature and I will grow up. Bu until then Dalton, make a life for you and exclude me out of it, I don't want to be the bitch that haunts your past...  I will always love you but I need my Family at this time...Go on, *crys* You mean the world to me...But I have to do this...PLEASE DON't HATE ME!!
