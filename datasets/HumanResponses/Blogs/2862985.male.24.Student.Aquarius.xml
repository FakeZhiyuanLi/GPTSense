Its a song which the outside people cannot hear... as its self-composed... so nice! Almost become my favourite song immediately now.. So touching..   Wrote a long letter and send to Grace. Hope she would receive it. Dunno why, these few days, or rather since the starting of this semester, I haven't been able to concentrate during lectures. Think I have slacked a lot. Haha.. or is it because Grace is not around, then disrupt my daily life that I have grew accustomed to? haha.. stop blaming others.. Its plain simple... I am lazy..keke  Today is Valentines Day. Dunno how to celebrate.. Later in the afternoon maybe going out with Keith and Fabian and Serene..See how lor..  Ok la.. nothing much to write also.. Bye..

      Hello... My name is Desmond. This is my first entry of the blog. Today also happens to be my birthday! Well, today was quite a good day.. as in nothing bad really happened. Went to eat KFC at Clementi Central with Keith and Fabian in the afternoon. The ST2334(Probability and Statistics) tutorial was a disater. Disater as in I do not know how to do majority of the questions. Guess that I do have to skip lectures less often now. Discussed about some things over lunch with Keith and Fab. Then Fab told us a very funny thing after we brought up the topic of those secondary school students watching porno together. He told us that last time while he was in sec 1, he had a classmate who once took out his dick and start to masturbate in class while his teacher is teaching. He was actually teaching his fellow friends how to masturbate. Since its an all guys school, he dared to do it. This is really incredible. I laughed immediately after I heard that. How can a sec 1 student be so daring to be able to do that? And there must be something wrong with that guy's mentality at such a young age. Then Fab later explained that he came from the US and have experienced a lot of things. Well, still, he shouldn't have shown such disrespect to his teacher and his fellow peers.  After lunch, I went to the lab and waited for Fab and Keith to finish their tut. After that, left school at about 7pm as I am meeting my sisters, Esther, Edwin they all for bowling. Enjoyed myself thoroughly. Scored 134 and 138 for the 2 games played. Pretty satisfied although a bit disappointed at not bettering my personal high of 167..=p  After that, we went to Holland V for dinner. Dad ordered a lot of things and I ate until very full. However at the bad of my mind, I kept thinking about the CS4271 assignment due the next morning. It was not until 11.30pm before I reached home. Think have to pia throughout the night liao.. Till next time, Goodbye for now...  Nites...

      " Dear all, I am appealing for fosterers or a permanent home for Brownie, a one year plus female mongrel.    My friend and I first found Brownie at Simei, roaming the compounds of PetSafari. She was affectionate despite it being our first meeting. We decided we wanted to help this dog with the most trusting eyes. After being rehomed, she was sent to a farm without our knowledge. We made a trip to the farm and seeing how contented she was getting the full run of the place, we decided to leave her there even though we were initally against the idea.  Unfortunately, during our last visit, we found out that she has been tied up to a pole for the past two weeks. The people at the farm were willing to let her go and Brownie is now putting up at my place.   So far, i've had no complains, save for that over affectionate tongue and her propeller-like wagging tail. Behaviour: Excellent. Taught her basic commands like 'Sit','Down' and 'Up' effortlessly. Eliminates on grass. Sterilised. Not fussy with food. No known health problems as of April 2004.  As great a companion as she is, parents will be parents. My mom is adamant about NOT having two dogs in the house and I'm afraid Brownie's deadline is drawing near. I sincerely hope for someone to step forward to offer a temporary/ permanent home for the sweetest dog i've met, out of the countless dogs i've had encounters with. A mongrel she may be, but she's got a heart bigger than many of the dogs i know. I appeal for someone to step forward for a chance to fall in love with this dog I refuse to put on the streets. Give Brownie a chance, please do not dismiss her until you've met her.  If you would like to help Brownie, please contact myself (Kailing : 92733043) or Cassandra at 97917449 anytime for a bonding session. "  This is the mail that my friends are trying to pass around. Just like them, I hope for Brownie a nice home and owner. I can testify that Brown's really a sweet little dog who would wag her tail whenever she sees you. She likes only to chase cats and people on roller blades... I have only had her for one day, but I have fallen in love with her already. If not for my mum, I would have adopted her. Brownie Brownie Brownie.. I miss you..  Here's some pictures of Brownie (as requested by Simpleboi) :

      Hello, last night forgot to write as I was too tired when I reached home. Went shopping last night and bought a lot of things worth $500++. Its the first day of the Great Singapore Sale, haha, and Pinru wants to buy her working shoes and attire, so we went shopping. I bought a Guess watch and shirt.  Met up with Dr Alan in the afternoon but he was like quite pissed off with me for not doing my work. He said that if i don't do my work, there's no point meeting up with him, and I totally agree with him. Well, I was lazy.. so he has eveyr right to scold me...Sighz, think I'd have to work on my HYP for the next few days..  After that, met up with Huiling at Lips. Wanted to pass her the CDs but .. forgotten to bring! Sighz.. Forgetful Desmond..  Alright, got to rush to school now... would blog again tonight..  Here's a little story again...  From the very beginning, girl's family objected strongly on her dating this guy. Saying that it has got to do with family background and the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.    Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrel very often. Though the girl love the guy deeply, but she always ask him: "How deep is your love for me?" As the guy is not good with his words, this often causes the girl to be very upset.    With that and the family's pressure, the girl often vents her anger on him. As for him, he only endures it in silence.    After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated and decided to further his studies in overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the girl: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?"    The girl agreed, and with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in and agreed to let them get married. So before he leaves, they got engaged. The girl went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love thru emails and phone calls. Though it's hard, but both never thought of giving up.    One day, while the girl was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. She has lost her voice... The doctor says that the impact on her brain has caused her to loss her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down.    During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry, it's still just silence cry that accompanied her. Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same, except for the ringing tone of the phone. This pierced into her heart every time it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know and not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.    With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions and millions of reply, countless of phone calls. All the girl could do, besides crying, is still crying... The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything and be happy.    With a new environment, the girl learns sign language and started a new life. Telling her everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her friend came and told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him.    A year has passed and her friend came with an envelope, containing an invitation card for the guy's wedding. Girl was shattered. When she opens the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.    He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. "I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. The girl finally smiled."      *Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know how to give.  *Treat every moment as is it's the last day, and then you'll know how to treasure.

      Today I got a visitor to my house and she is going to stay with me for the next two days. Her name is Brownie. The first time I saw her, I fell in love with her immediately. Actually its because her foster is coming only this saturday to fetch her and Kailing couldn't keep her at her house any longer (as she already has a dog at home and her mum starts to nag at her.) and hence Cass and Kai have to ask for my help. Well, I couldn't have been happier to have a dog again! Its only my mum thats the main problem. But still I manage to convince her and help to put up Brownie for the next two days.   Actually I really really love dogs a lot. They are not known as man's best friend for nothing ok?!  I used to have a German Shepherd a few years back. His name is Jacky. That time, whenever I feel very low or down, I would talk to him and he seems to understand me. Thats how I started to form a special relationship with Jacky. When he passed away due to old age, I was very very sad. Its like someone close to me has left me forever. After his death I have not got myself another dog. I do not want to have that feeling again..... Sighz.. (Thinking and missing Jacky now...)  Today is actually a very normal day. Went to school in the afternoon to collect the Visual Studio.Net CDs. After that, went to John Little to buy the thermal flask as they are having sale now. Then went to Ang Mo Kio Library to return my books which are due tomorrow. Hee, tell you one secret. I do not know where to return the books and have to ask a little kid in the library where to return the books... Haha, so "malu". But cannot blame la, its my first time there to return books. Normally I don't return.. keke..:P  Played a lot with Brownie just now. Very tired as she makes me run round the whole estate. She ran out of our gate when we opened it and I have to chase her around like a mad man.. Haha.. but well, a good workout though... Its been a long time since I run for such a long distance... :P  Too bad Brownie is just going to stay with me for another one more day. Sighz.. think I already can't bear to see her leave already.. but well, tian1 xia4 wu2 bu4 san4 zhi1 yan2 xing2, that applies to humans, more so for dogs. So guess I just have to wish her happiness with her new master ... Brownie, stay happy and cute always!!!  P.S. Porto won yesterday! Yeh!! Hurray!! Although my heart wants Monaco to win, but well, you can't possibly work against $$, can you? Hee..:P

      Hello, its me again.. after 3 days missing. Well, don't really feel like writing blogs these days as I also dunno what to write in here. Some things might be too sensitive. Some are too bo liao that I feel that it would be a waste of time and space putting here. Haha..    Ok, let's talk about yesterday first. Basically the most interesting thing about yesterday is when I went to change my dad's car tyre at Toh Yee Drive. The tyre shop we went is actually not a very big shop and it only has one worker and the boss himself. The interesting thing is the boss. He must be one of the most blur boss that I have ever seen. He can even talk to himself or hold two phones at a time and talk at the same time. if you do not know him, he would appear a bit mentally unstable to you. He is very very busy, always going about to do things (well, he has only one worker and his business is actually not bad at all because his tyres are really cheap) and listening to phone calls.  Then I saw a portrait of his wife on the wall. Gosh, you won't believe that such a blur man can have a really pretty wife. And do you still remember the incident when the wife of a man who sells car at Great World City went to smash 13 of his cars when she realised that he has a mistress who is the TV actress Wang Yu Xiang? Yah, he has the newspaper cutting pasted on his wall just beside his wife's portrait. It somehow gives me the feeling that he is the man. But then, he looks so blur to me that it would be really unbelievable if he can get a fling outside.  Not only is the boss blur, he also is being fucked and scolded by his customers and even his own worker! There's this customer who keep scolding him CB that he is taking his own sweet time and wasting his precious time. And the blur boss just take it in and never show his temper once. Well, just imagine, when the clock hits 12.30pm sharp, his worker just leave everything to his boss to do and went about his lunch, leaving the poor boss to settle everything. My gosh, such a blur and easily bullied boss, I also want next time.. hee..  However Ace told me that most probably he is just acting blur. When it comes to quoting prices, he is faster than anybody else. If he sees a rich customer (i.e those people driving merz or BMW etc), he would quote a relativey higher price. And I really believe that he is not blur, else how can he have made his business so big and successful that he is opening a second shop at East Coast? Hence it came to my conclusion that he just wants to give his customers and worker the feeling that he is blur and would not cheat them, but actually he is laughing inside at how stupid these people are.  So, at the end of the day, do you think pride is more important or money is more important? To the boss, obviously pride means nothing. However to me, I surely cannot stand it when people scold me.  Today, went to Malaysia with dad to settle some property transfer things. He also set up a stock account for me in Malaysia. Well, very boring day in there as we have to go a lot of banks and law firms and accounting firms to settle a lot of documents. Tiring also and I slept on the way back.  Have been rather moody these few days. Hope that I did not affect the people around me. But I think I have already done so. So here's apologies to you.. hee.. although you don't know about my site, still I want to tell you I'm sorry.. hee..  Ok la, here's a little meaningful quote for everybody, taken from Vivian's website :  "For every minute you are angry. You lose 60 seconds of happiness."

      Today is a bad day for me. Firstly, I only slept like 2 hours the night before then have to wake up early to fetch my sister and Grace to work. Then my mum saw me sleeping in front of the driving wheel and offered to drive them to work. I am of course more than happy, thinking that I can go back to sleep. But after a while after they left, my sister called and said that the cash card is not in the car. Then I have to wake up and check around. After some time, I realised that its in my wallet which I have put inside the car before I got out of the car for mum to drive. After that didn't really have the mood to go back to sleep. Haha..  Then at 10am, I have to wake up again to fetch my mum, Jet and sister to airport. They are going for holiday at Bangkok. So I am still feeling very sleepy but bo bian, have to fetch them to airport.  After that thought of going to school to collect the VS.net CDs which I have reserved with the Helpdesk on Tuesday. Upon reaching there, they told me that my reservation has been stalled and I have to make a new reservation and come back to collect another day. They explained that I have to collect within one day when they have sent the confirmation e-mail. Sighz.. only can blame myself for not checking my mail frequently enough. So a wasted trip to school.  Then after that went to change car with Ace and go straight to Suntec, thinking of having lunch with Grace, but in the end she said she cannot eat with me as she has promised her colleagues to eat with them. So in the end another wasted trip down to the town. Then have to go home lor.  After reaching home, Gavin called to say that he would be reaching the workshop in 30 minutes time. So I thought of going there earlier to find the workshop. Then ended up waiting for very long.. haha..   When Gavin reached, Harry then told us that it is not FOC! Always thought that it is FOC. After some ponderings, we decided to change the tyres ourselves. However, we didn't realised that it needs balancing also until we are about to change. So in the end, didn't get to change the tyres. Have to wait till tomorrow morning lor and see how.  Now while writing this blog, I am talking to Vivian online. I am really happy to be able to talk to her after so long. Its a nice feeling. She is always a friend that I treasured! We updated each other on our lifes and she is still the old Vivian that I have known.   These few days have been sleeping quite late. Dunno why, but I just can't sleep early. Have been thinking a lot about humans and their feelings. That time after watching Passion Of Christ, I realised how great it is to be able to forgive someone. Jesus has been tortured and humiliated by the people and not once has he blamed them at all. He even asked God to forgive them and explained that they do not know what they are doing. It really strikes something in my heart. That time you know who immediately comes to my mind... haha.. its Fabian.. He is always so forgiving and never once had I seen him gets angry at anything or anybody before. But lately I think he is rather pissed off with me. That day went out with him and he doesn't seems interested in talking to me. but well, I dun blame him also.. coz the whole atmosphere is a bit awkward. Well, I did try to talk to sooth the atmosphese.. haha. I want to learn forgiveness. I also beg for the forgiveness of anybody whom I have hurt or offended knowingly or unknowingly. You should know who I am referring to.   There's a very good short story which I want to share with everyone here. Enjoy and here it goes :     Forgiven #491    It had been three years since Lisa last opened the box. A sudden move to Boston had kept her from packing it. But now that she was back home, she took the time to look again at the memories. Fingering the corners of the box and stroking its cover, Lisa pictured in her mind what was inside. There was a photo of the family trip to the Grand Canyon, a note from her friend telling her that Nick Bicotti liked her, and the Indian arrowhead she had found while on her senior class trip.  One by one, she remembered the items in the box, lingering over the sweetest, until she came to the last and only painful memory. She knew what it looked like - a single sheet of paper upon which lines had been drawn to form boxes, 490 of them to be exact. And each box contained a check mark, one for each time.  "How many times must I forgive my brother?" the disciple Peter has asked Jesus. "Seven times?" Lisa's Sunday school teacher had read Jesus's surprise answer to the class. "Seventy times seven." Lisa had leaned over to her brother Brent as the teacher continued reading.  "How many times is that?" she whispered. Brent, though two years younger, was smarter than she was.  "Four Hundred and Ninety," Brent wrote on the corner of his Sunday school paper. Lisa saw the message, nodded, and sat back in her chair. She watched her brother as the lesson continued. He was small for his age, with narrow shoulders and short arms. His glasses were too large for his face, and his hair always matted in swirls. He bordered on being a nerd, but his incredible skills at everything, especially music, made him popular with his classmates.  Brent had learned to play piano at age four, the clarinet at age seven, and had just begun to play oboe. His music teachers said that he'd be a famous musician someday. There was only one thing at which Lisa was better than Brent - basketball. They played it almost every afternoon after school. Brent could have refused to play, but he knew that it was Lisa's only joy in the midst of her struggles to get C's and D's at school.  Lisa's attention came back to her Sunday school teacher as the woman finished the lesson and closed with prayer. That same Sunday afternoon found brother and sister playing basketball in the driveway. It was then that the counting had begun. Brent was guarding Lisa as she dribbled toward the basket. He had tried to bat the ball away, got his face near her elbow, and took a shot on the chin. "Ow!" he cried out and turned away. Lisa saw her opening nad drove to the basket, making an easy lay-up. She gloated over her success but stopped when she saw Brent.  "You okay?", she asked. Brent shrugged his shoulders.  "Sorry," Lisa said.  "Really. It was a cheap shot."  "Its alright. I forgive you," he said.  A thin smile then formed on his face. "Just 489 more times though."  "Whaddaya mean?" Lisa asked.  "You know...what we learned in Sunday school today. You're supposed to forgive someone 490 times. I just forgave you, so now you have 489 times left," he kidded. The two of them laughed at the thought of keeping track of every time Lisa had done something to Brent. They were sure she had gone past 490 long ago.  The rain interrupted their game, and the two moved indoors. "Wanna play Battleship?" Lisa asked. Brent agreed, and they were soon on the floor of the living room with their game boards in front of them. Each took turns calling out a letter and number combination, hoping to hit each other's ships. Lisa knew she was in trouble as the game went on. Brent had only lost one ship out of five. Lisa had lost three. Desperate to win, she found herself leaning over the edge of Brent's barrier ever so slightly. She as thus able to see where Brent had placed two ships. She quickly evened the score. Pleased, Lisa searched once more for the location of the last two ships. She peered over the barrier again, but this time Brent caught her in the act.  "Hey, you're cheating!" He stared at her in disbelief. Lisa's face turned red. Her lips quivered. "I'm sorry," she said, staring at the floor. There was not much Brent could say. He knew Lisa sometimes did things like this. He felt sorry that Lisa found so few things she could do well. It was wrong for her to cheat, but he knew the temptation was hard for her.  "Okay, I forgive you," Brent said. Then he added with a small laugh, "I guess its down to 488 now, huh?"  "Yeah, I guess so." She returned his kindness with a weak smile and added, "Thanks for being my brother, Brent."  Brent's forgiving spirit gripped Lisa, and she wanted him to know how sorry she was. It was that evening that she had made the chart with the 490 boxes. She showed it to him before he went to bed. "We can keep track of everytime I mess up and you forgive me," she said. "See, I'll put a check in each box - like this." She placed two marks in the upper left-hand boxes.  "These are for today." Brent raised his hands to protest. "You don't need to keep --"  "Yes I do!" Lisa interrupted. "You're always forgiving me, and I want to keep track. Just let me do this!" She went back to her room and tacked the chart to her bulletin board.  There were many opportunities to fill in the chart in the years that followed. She once told the kids that Brent talked in his sleep and called out Rhonda Hill's name, even though it wasn't true. The teasing caused Brent days and days of misery. When she realized how cruel she had been, Lisa apologized sincerely. That night she marked box number 96.  Forgiveness number 211 came in the tenth grade when Lisa failed to bring home his English book. Brent had stayed home sick that day and had to asked her to bring it so that he could study for a quiz. She forgot and he got a C.  Number 393 was for lost keys...418 for the extra bleach she put in the washer, which ruined his favourite polo shirt...449, the dent she had put in his car when she borrowed it.  There was a small ceremony when Lisa checked number 490. She used a gold pen for the check mark, had Brent sign the chart, and then placed it in her memory box. "I guess thats the end," Lisa said. "No more screw-ups from me anymore!" Brent just laughed. "Yeah, right."  Number 491 was just another of Lisa's careless mistakes, but its hurt a lifetime. Brent had become all that his music teachers said he would. Few could play the oboe better than he. In his fourth year at the best music school in the United States, he received the opportunity of a lifetime -- a chance to try out for New York City's great orchestra.  The tryout would be held sometime during the following two weeks. It would be the fulfillment of his young dreams. But he never got the chance. Brent had been out when the call about the tryout came to the house. Lisa was the only one home and on her way out the door, eager to get to work on time. "Two-thirty on the tenth," the secretary said on the phone. Lisa did not have a pen, but she told herself that she could remember it. "Got it. Thanks." I can remember that, she thought. But she did not. It was a week later around the dinner table that Lisa realized her mistake. "So, Brent," his mom asked him, "When do you try out?"  "Don't know yet. They're supposed to call."  Lisa frozed in her seat.  "Oh no!" she blurted out loud. "What's today's date? Quick!"  "Its the twelfth," her dad answered. "Why?" A terrible pain ripped through Lisa's heart. She buried her face in her hands and started crying. "Lisa, what's the matter?" her mother asked. Through sobs Lisa explained what had happened. "It was two days ago... the tryout... two-thirty... the call came... last week."  Brent sat back in his chair, not believing Lisa. "Is this one of your jokes, sis?" he asked, though he could tell her misery was real. She shook her head, still unable to look at him. "Then I really missed it?" She nodded.  Brent ran out of the kitchen without a word. He did not come out of his room the rest of the evening. Lisa tried once to knock on the door, but she could not face him. She went to her room where she cried bitterly. Suddenly she knew what she had to do. She had ruined Brent's life. He could never forgive her for that. She had failed her family, and there was nothing to do but to leave home. Lisa packed her pickup truck in the middle of the night and left a note behind, telling her folks she'd be alright.  She began writing a note to Brent, but her words sounded empty to her. Nothing I say could make a difference anyway, she thought.  Two days later she got a job as a waitress in Boston. She found an apartment not too far from the restaurant. Her parents tried many times to reach her, but Lisa ignored their letters. "It's too late," she wrote them once. "I've ruined Brent's life, and I'm not coming back." Lisa did not think she would ever see home again. But one day in the restaurant where she worked, she saw a face she knew.  "Lisa!" said Mrs Nelson, looking up from her plate. "What a surprise!"  The woman was a friend of Lisa's family from back home. "I was so sorry to hear about your brother," Mrs Nelson said softly.  "Such a terrible accident. But we can be thankful that he died quickly. He didn't suffer." Lisa stared at the woman in shock.  "Wh-hat," she finally stammered. It couldn't be! Her brother? Dead? The woman quickly saw that Lisa did not know about the accident. She told the girl the sad story of the speeding car, the rush to the hospital, the doctors working over Brent. But all they could do was not enough to save him.  Lisa returned home that afternoon.                               ***    Now she found herself in her room thinking about her brother as she held the small box that held some of her memories of him. Sadly, she opened the box and peered inside. It was as she remembered, except for one item -- Brent's chart. It was not there. In its place, at the bottom of the box, was an envelope. Her hands shook as she tore open and removed a letter. The first page read:   Dear Lisa,  It was you who kept count, not me. But if you're  stubborn enough to keep count, use the new chart I've made for you.  Love, Brent   Lisa turned to the second page where she found a chart just like the one she had made as a child, but on this one the lines were drawn in perfect precision. And unlike the chart she had kept, there was but one check mark in the upper left-hand corner. Written in red felt tip pen over the entire page were the words:    #491.  Forgiven,  FOREVER.

      Hiyes... Its been a really really long time since the last time I blog in. Haha, guess have been rather lazy to write. This is my new blog outlook after some days of editing here and there. Any improvements please comment ok? ;) And also, please feel free to post in the tag board. Its quite empty there. Haha..Well, think it would not be too noisy as I only tell 4 people about this site.. hee hee..  Well, got back my results yesterday and its only so-so. Not too good but not too bad either... No complaints lah since I did not really put in any good efforts at all in the preparations. The most disappointing should be my CS4271 ba.. I got a B- for that which is like.. shit! Haha.. but well, I was late for almost 30 mins for the paper so no complaints again.. But still, I managed to finish in time so thats not a valid excuse also.. Well, in the end, it still boils down to being lazy and did not prepare well enough.. sighz... The most satisfying result should be my ST2334 (Probability and Statistics). Hee, you must be expecting me to get at least an A or something like that. But no, I only got a B+. The reason why it is satisfying is that I only did like 20%-30% of the final paper. I also expected an A for my MA1104 (Advanced Calculus) but only got an A-. Well, guess that being lucky in one module would lead to being unlucky in another so that it would balance out. Hee.. dunno what I am talking also..   Ok, back to today. Woke up in the morning and decided to meet my sister and Grace for lunch. Hence went to Suntec. Changed car with Dad today and his car is really cannot make it. Its so old and seems that it would break down anytime.. Haha..  After reaching Suntec, guess who I bumped into? Its Huiling and Fabian and Huiling's mummy! What a coincidence. It came somewhat like a surprise to me, maybe with a bit of shock. Coz it has been such a long time since I last talked to them and dunno what to talk also. We happened to be at the same place at the same time and taking the same escalator up. So a bit awkward. But nevertheless, I think over time it would juz get better. Hopefully I would become good friends with them again!!! I really treasure friendships a lot... Sometimes I just doesn't show.. haha..  After lunch, went to try for an interview at Sims Drive, opposite block 45. Yes, its just beside where Huiling stays. They are looking for salesperson for the World Book Fair held at Suntec for a period of 9 days in June, paying $60 + commission per day. However when I reached there, the place is full of people, mostly teenagers and I gave up. Dun want to waste my time queing up. Haha.. Besides, Ace is waiting for my car to use.  Went home and at night go for dinner with my family at Old Airport Road Hawker Centre. The food there is rather nice! Used to eat the Fried Kway Teow over there during army days. Oh Yah, and the Wanton Mee where we have to get queue number one.. how can I forget that? Fabian always order $4 plus a lot of chilli! Hee.. very nice food.. Yummy.. feels hungry again..  Ok la, thats all for today, would blog in again another time.. see when I am free.. haha.. Anyway the lyrics for the song played :                                "Thats What Friends Are For"                           And I never thought I`d feel this way                          And as far as I`m concerned                           I`m glad I got the chance to say                          That I do believe I love you                          And if I should ever go away,                          Well, then close your eyes and try,                          To feel the way we do today,                          And then if you can remember,                          Keep smiling, keep shining,                          Knowing you can always count on me,                          for sure, that`s what friends are for,                          For good times, and bad times,                          I`ll be on your side forevermore,                           That`s what friends are for.                          Well, you came and opened me                           And now there`s so much more I see                          And so by the way, I thank you                          And then for the times we`re apart,                          Well, then close your eyes and know                          These words are coming from my heart

      I've been missing for several days... think have been rather lazy updating my blog. Furthurmore, my computer has been sick these days, don't really know whats the problem with it...Seems like it has been invaded by a large team of cookies and viruses... Sighz..  Oh yah, almost forgot, in case anybody responds to the post I put up a couple of weeks ago, I have to announce that I am now the new owner of Brownie! Yeh Hey!! Was very happy and busy with her these days, as I have to learn how to take care of a dog again. She was not as good as I thought though, always very playful, hee... She would sometimes (depends on her mood) bark at people walking pass my gate and passageway. And she really likes to chase cats and go out of my gate. Last Saturday we took her for microchipping and almost couldn't find her after she ran out of my gate later at night. We searched for two hours and even sat in cars to search for her in the neighbourhood, but to no avail. Kailing and Cass even wanted to come over and search for her. I was almost giving up hope, feeling ultra duper sad and guilty. Then she came back, all BY HERSELF! I was so very happy at that time, I told myself not to let her go away so easily next time... Brown ah Brown..  Went out with Sumitro and Keith last friday. Actually wanted to watch Troy with Sumitro (we keep postponing it for dunno how many weeks already), but apparently, the hottest thing in cinemas now is Harry Porter and we jst couldn't find an appropriate showtime for our Troy, hence we gave up and decided to wait for the VCD. Went to funan instead as Sumitro wanted to change his hard disk. Then we saw Fabian there.. But too bad, we couldn't see Jolin..  Euro Cup 2004 is starting this saturday already...Is actually feeling a bit excited over it now. Hope that Denmark can win the tournament, I always feel that Denmark is one of the best team around.. Hahaha.. Bought $10 Denmark win the tournament at a handsome odds of 36.00 this afternoon... Hope that lady luck is on my side.. Keke..  Ok! I shall stop here... Shall blog again when I feel like blogging.. la di la...

      Hello, just received some pics of Brownie and her new home. However, she is now living with 4 kids and you know, kids are always kids and we are afraid that Brownie might find it too stress to handle them. Don't say Brownie, I can't even tolerate 4 kids at one time. You know how noisy they can be at times..Anyway, this would be a short blog; I have to rush for my HYP...

      Have been busy with HYP. Or other things? I also don't know. I just know that I have been very lazy. Have been really down on Sunday. Been thinking of a lot of things, some bad some good. Got to know a nice song recently. Went reservist the last two weeks and caught up with some of the army friends. Its really a nice feeling to be able to catch up with one another again after a year. Sometimes really feel that reservist is good in the sense that it stops everybody from busy doing what they are doing and get together. This year's reservist is a memorable one as it includes our battalion's celebration of getting the Best NS Unit yet again. The celebration is being held at the Chevleron(did I get the spelling right?). Anyway, its a really nice place. compared to the previous one at Beach Road. Went to Gan's wedding dinner on Tuesday night. He is now driving a super car which I doubt I can ever find a second one in Singapore. I also not sure what the car is but I think it is specially imported from Japan. After seeing the two of them together for so long, I was real happy to see them getting married. He only invited me in 1 SIR, I guess I am really his best friend there. Wishing him all the best, his business would get better and better , his car more and more posh, and may he be a father real soon.. Hee.. Fabian is now in Taiwan. Feels that we have been talking to each other less and less. He seems upset everytime I meet him and I don't know why. Just bathe Brownie a couple of hours ago, she's getting smelly. Going to watch Spiderman2 with Sumitro and Shirley and Grace later in the evening. I also dunno what I am doing..... SIGHZ..........      情人节的前一天   他离开你身边   只剩下你情不至尽的想恋     那一夜我陪着你   你哭了一阵夜   你是否知道我对他一样很想恋     至到有一天我和他碰面   在那间我们常去的咖啡店     才知道有些感受   我和他谁都不曾说出口   我们之间隐藏了什么   处了我自己没人懂     可是你你怎么说   你只道好时不时从此必开我   我一样难过   多希望我们不曾相似过     才知道有些感受    我和他谁都不曾说出口   我们都是最好的朋友   谁会有勇气去开口     不再哭不再难过   我们还有好大好大的天空   故事的最后   我们都不曾失去过什么
