      Well today was pretty dull. I woke up around 12:30pm turned on the TV and flipped thru some channels after that i went downstairs and had breakfast, had some cereal and orange juice. Then  i got on the computer and checked my email and a couple sites that i frequent then i played a game...got off and watched TV the rest of the day. I also saw the last episode of The Real World, kind of sad that they all left...too bad those girls were hot! ah well. Well tomorrow a few guests that are visiting my sister from Denver(my hometown) are coming over for dinner, they're pretty nice people ive met them before.  well thats all folks, cya!

      hey folks!  I had a great day today...first my friend mike came over and we messed around the house, afterwards we skated all the way to our friend Sara's house...which was a huge mistake it was HOT outside (duh, its florida) and when we arrived at Sara's house we were sweaty and dehydrated and none of the girls really wanted to give us hugs lol.  After we arrived at her house we sat down outside and chatted for a while then watched tv and later we went to jose's house and fucked around there then just walked around the neighboorhood for a bit...its pretty nice could of been better if we got some action god fucking damn it!....ah well what am i saying the girls are a bit prude! well im pooped from skating    cya !

      Hey folks!  Well today i went shopping at the mall with my mom and i actually didnt have to bad of a time, contrary to what i thought it was going to be like. yeah so i went to pac sun and bought one pair of transnine9 pants and one DCSHOECO shirt and one Atticus shirt(finally!) been wanting an Atticus shirt for the longest time now. so anyways the reason i got new clothes is because well you know school starts next week...but that isnt enough  clothes for me!! i dont like going back to school with the same old shit from last and i have a really good reason not to this time....most of my pants are shredded up from dragging them so they look old and really used up....oh yeah i stopped by hot topic also and saw a couple things i wanted but i couldnt get but i did get these barb wire bracelet thingies, im probably never going to wear them but fuck it!....oh damn i just remembered i need a new pair of shoes..... SH$ %$^%$*(*%$%$$&amp;$    Ciao!

      Well to start the day off i woke up(duh) around 1:30pm, new record. Then a few hours later my sister arrived with her guests, it was quite nice having them over i hadn't seen them in ages! they're very nice and funny people. The rest of my day was quite boring just watched some tv and went on the computer and surfed around...god i cant wait till i get to Denver i want to do so much when im there i just hope we have the time do what we want, speaking of that my brother told me over the phone that he's going to take me white water rafting... i was like "oh hell no", i dont weigh much and i've seen how u get tossed around on that raft when your going down river i'll probably get tossed right out of that boat...*david scared* :(.  talk to you later bLOG, hehe.

      Howdy folks.....charley is coming...lol school is cancelled tomorrow due to that hurricane, pretty cool (sort of). well school has been going ...ok i guess, unbelievably boring! i guess thats b/cuz i dont know anyone in any of my classes but maybe that'll change soon...i do see my old frineds at lunch and we hang out...but its just not the same. damn i need to get a girl...sarah is sort of the only girl i find myself attracted to but why bother it'll all just end in a train wreck like the past two relationships we had, plus she can be difficult and in a way so can i...if there was a way we could settle our differences i might consider going back out with her. but then again there are plenty of girls out there i just doubt any of them are interested in me. :(  cya  blah
