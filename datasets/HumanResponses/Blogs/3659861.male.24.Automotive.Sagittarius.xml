      Well...I've been doing some chatting with a few folks and poking around all corners of the 'net.  I decided to take "the plunge" and put up an online personal ad.  I decided after visiting 7 or 8 different sites that Yahoo! Personals offered the most listings for my area and I did it.  I have NO idea what kind of response this'll bring...or even if I'll get much of one at all.  But I've decided it's time to start having a personal life again and seeing as how I'm not really into the "bar scene", as it were, this seemed like a very viable option.  As a starting block, at least.  So...we'll see where this goes.  I'll keep y'allz updated on any progress in the romance department :-D  --Oz

      I was reading the first installment of Comicality's "On the Outside" and it got me to thinking...  The first few paragraphs of that story read a lot like my own past few years.  In fact, I think I might still be in the closet were it not for the fact that I met a friend who helped me to see that I wasn't bad because I was gay.  But there were years there, especially in high school, where I knew my feelings weren't the same as other guys', but I didn't know what they meant at the time.  I wasn't interested in Playboy, I didn't stare at all the hot girls at the mall, I didn't get a hardon every time the Victoria's Secret catalog came in the mail.  I had what I'd call, looking back, an "appreciation" for other guys.  I didn't know what that meant, but I certainly knew I was attracted to them on some level.  So...with the wealth of information available on the internet I set out to do some research.  Now, I know what you're thinking at this point.  "Research?!?"  But yeah, that's what I did.  In everything, big and small, life-altering or not, I'm very methodical.  If I have a question about something I do research.  Lots of it.  So after researching what it meant not to have "sexual" feelings for women, and what it meant to be attracted to guys, and after looking at some "adult" material I came to the conclusion that I might possibly be attracted to other guys instead of women.  What you have to understand is that I'm from a town of 3000 people in Eastern Iowa.  The most exposure I'd ever had to gay people was watching "The Birdcage" on television.  I didn't know what it meant, if it was good or bad, or the symantics of the whole deal.  I basically had to learn everything on my own.  I had an asshole of a stepdad that I never got along with.  So as soon as I turned 18 I moved out and rented a farmhouse outside of town.  I'd managed to convince myself, after more research and reading, that I didn't want to be gay and I could turn it off.  Easy enough, right?  Now that I was conscious of it and knew what it was, I could train myself not to be that way.  So for the next couple of years I went into a deep, deep denial.  I dated a few women, slept with some...and had an absolutely abhorrent personal life.  I watched straight porn, read straight magazines, and tried to train myself to follow women with my eyes like all my friends did.  It didn't work.  Shortly after I moved again I broke up with my girlfriend.  About 2 days after that I had a sort of a breakdown.  I was in the kitchen making some soup and it was like a bolt of lightning struck me.  I suddenly hit my knees.  I had no power to stand.  I cried right there in the middle of the kitchen while my soup boiled over on the stove.  That night I laid in bed for hours and cried myself to sleep.  And I finally accepted the fact that I was gay.  And I was pissed at God for doing this to me.  I mean, c'mon!  What sin did I commit that was bad enough to warrant me being gay?  What did I ever do to anybody?  Gradually, I pushed it to the back of my mind and just didn't think about it.  But then, something cosmic happened.  It's as if God finally wanted to lend me a helping hand.  He introduced me to a lesbian.    Now I know that sounds wierd, but follow along.  Through this girl is how I finally learned that being gay isn't bad.  She allowed me to see that a gay person functions primarily the same way in this world as a straight person does.  She helped me to realize that fundamentally I'm the same person I've always been...just more aware than before.  So...that's where I'm at today.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.  P.S.  Thanks to Comicality and his writing for bringing out this particular post.

      Hey, all!  So...I created a blog.  As many of you know I got a new job that's making increasing demands on my time.  I'm not around my favorite haunts as much as I used to be and want to be, so I thought I'd start this blog to keep everyone updated.  I also tend to have random thoughts and ideas that I'd like to throw out there or discuss at length, so I created this blog to have a place to put these things.  So check back often, because I plan on updating whenever something strikes my fancy.  Thanks for reading.

      Well....since so many are curious, and so many ask....I've put a picture up in my profile.  I've shown lots of pictures, but this one everyone calls "The Thinker" seems to be everyone's favorite.  I have no idea why.  Anyway, I'll probably rotate a few pictures in and out just to keep things fresh. Lemme know what y'all think. :-)

      I have a very unique problem, or so I'm told.  When I walk I have what's called a "heel-step" which means that I apply more pressure to my heels when I walk than most other people do.  The consequence of this, much to my dismay, is that long before I ever wear out the undersides of the soles I actually wear down into the soles from the top.   Doc Martens, Ecco, Timberland...I've tried 'em all and they all do the same thing.  I finally found a shoe that doesn't do that to me, called BÃ¶rn.  They actually started in the medical field, so they're made for people that walk all day.  To make a long story short, I finally wore out my current pair of shoes and had to go buy new ones.  Problem is, there's only 1 store in my area that carries them and it's about 40 minutes away.  Not really a trip I like to make by myself.  It's nice enough, and the mall itself is OK, but in general I like a companion to go shopping with.  My roomie was busy with his virual Fantasy League NFL Draft so I went in search of someone else to venture out with me.  As those of you who read my last blog entry know, most of my friens won't have a whole lot to do with me unless there are other people around, so I really couldn't call one of them.  So I went in search of my sister.  She LOVES to shop.  Boy, I tell you what, if my sister didn't know I was gay before, she sure as shit does now! The mall that we trekked off to is in the middle of Iowa City.  For those who aren't familiar with Iowa or Iowa City, I'll give you a brief synopsis.  Iowa City is home to the 5th largest public university in the country, and one of the premier medical teaching hospitals in the U.S.  If you look at the calendar you'll note that at this time there is a mass exodus of students to school.  What does that mean to you and me?  EYE CANDY!  Oh my Lord in Heaven!  I couldn't keep my eyes anywhere near a neutral place!  The store clerks...the shoppers...the Abercrombie boys...the Gap boys...the AE boys...I was at a gay guy's smorgasbord!  I walked around in the mall for 3 hours with a hard-on!  And I'm not just talking an "I saw a cute guy" chubby.  I'm talking raging, stiff-as-a-board, drain all the blood from your head and make you dizzy boner.  You've had 'em before.  You know, the ones you have to tuck up and under the band of your undies so you won't walk around with a tent?  That was me, with my sister, in the mall, for 3 hours.  WITH MY SISTER!   And I'm not "formally" out to her yet.  I think she knows (which is a topic from a post waaaay back if you care to search for it) but I've never told her myself.  I've heard that if you want to know which way someone swings, you should follow their gaze and see which people they look at.  If my sister ever heard that then I'm definitely in trouble. She bought a pink purse at Aroposdale.  She asked me if I liked it.  She bought a pink sweater at Old Navy.  She asked me if it was "her."  She bought some pink shoes at Lady Foot Locker.  She asked me if I thought they were cute.  Hrmmm.....

      Have you ever had one of those moments where, in a flash of clarity, you realize something relatively profound?  I had a thought like that the other day, and thought I'd share it and try to get some insight from other people about it.  Coming out is a big deal; at least for me it was.  It got to the point where I realized that if I didn't tell  somebody  about it I was going to go insane.  So...I came out.  To a lesbian.  It was a small step, relatively speaking, but I stuck my head out of the closet.  Over the next few months (most of my readers here have shared the coming out steps I've taken) I came out to my best friend and a few other people.  My best friend was the hardest, because even though I'd trust him with my life I didn't know how he'd react.  Since then, he's been very OK with the topic most of the time.  But so far, with a few bumps, everything's been OK.  A couple of my other friends have turned on the "professional friendship" angle where we only talk about safe topics and nothing approaching anything personal.  Their loss, not mine.  I thought that coming out would be helpful.  To a certain extent I guess it has been.  I thought that coming out would be liberating...and, to a certain extent, it has been.  But I realized the other day that it didn't change a whole lot in a very profound way like I thought it would.  Instead of being closeted and having a reason to be alone, now I'm out and alone instead.  Let me make a profound statement:  I feel more alone now than I did when I was deep in the closet.  Why?  I don't rightly know the answer to that one, but I've been doing some thinking and I've got a theory that I'd like to present.  Now that I'm out I should have a social live again apart from my friends.  I should be able to have gay friends, date people, and generally get my social life back together.  So why haven't I?  Because this is new to me all over again.  Usually, at the start of new and exciting things, I have someone to share the adventure with, so to speak.  But no one wants to share this one with me.  Not that I'm that much into the bar scene, but I don't have anyone to go to a gay bar with and just pal around.  I don't have anyone that I can socialize with on a "gay" level, per se.  Oh, most of my friends are fine with my being gay as long as they don't have to  do  anything with me that's "gay".  I guess all along I had just assumed that my friends were self-aware enough that if I wanted to go to the Pride Picnic or hang around the Dragon Nighclub for an hour or so that they'd put up with me like I put up with them.  I've been dragged to the far corners of who knows where following my friends.  They can't put up with a night on the town for me to explore my "new" world.  I guess they're just not as self-assured as I thought.  Oh, don't get me wrong, we've gone to the Dragon before.  That was an interesting experiment in what not to do when you're the only drunk gay guy among 10 straight friends.  My Mom always says that a drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts, and if that's what they think about gay people then I'm in a lot of trouble.  But they're OK with me.  Right.  I just don't know.  I just don't know how to find out where we really stand with each other.  I'm just not self-assured enough to go out on my own and learn the gay new world.  What do I do?  Where do I go?  Who do I talk to?  I'd like to have someone to share this life with.  For now I'm just out and alone.
