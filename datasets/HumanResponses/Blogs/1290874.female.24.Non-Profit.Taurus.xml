      waking up early morning really sucks. its as if im going to barf all the liempo and corned beef i ate for breakfast. to top it all, im wearing an ill-fitted jeans which is not really mine in the first place. talk about the karmic cycle! i just finished my email for jomig. i rarely email anyone. its just that i wanted to comment on ien's boylet email. the lack of a boylet doesnt bother me as much as it would have before. enlightenment? yeah right. hehehe. thats probably the reason why im okay now. anyway, got a class in a few minutes. hope everything goes well. laterz..

      very lazy day..i woke up at around 11:30 am. almost succumbed to my lazy demon. when i remembered, i had to go to school not to attend dr palisoc's "wonderful" class but to assist jun in his experiment with transducers. anyway, i arrived in UP at around 2 pm and i was able to check the data sheets of my WDE class. anyway, it was a better day compared to yesterday. i just spent most of my time in the faculty room checking my stuff and organizing those damn data sheets i still have to check. all these while listening to Magic 89.9 of course. i almost won their contest. i dont know what went wrong. i want that "maid in manhattan" OST and those RBO tickets. ill try to win those freebies tomorrow.

      its 3:58 am. certified addict. cant sleep. so many things going on in my mind. 17 days more before my birthday. been asking God the gift that i want. hehe.will i get it this year? i think i better specify what i want exactly. might miss out some important details. geez. i dont want to be alone anymore. Oops. did i just say that? just being  honest. no one knows this blog exists anyway. so back to my ranting. when will my misery end? well im not exactly lonely. my family and friends are with me. and im very thankful to the Lord for that. but somehow, we all need that one person in our lives. id like to think i met the one person 2 and a half years ago. and i wouldnt mind waiting for God knows how long to bring him back into my life. if that is God's plan for us. But i wouldnt refuse a "diversion" while waiting for him to come back. just kidding. ive been wanting to talk with mandela for 2 weeks. i just dont get the point of us not even bothering to say hello. not that im still hoping, not that im bitter. i just dont understand why we had to stop being friends. that really hurts me until now. i just might share this with his sis in jest. just so he knows...we all have to move on. as for the "affairs" or connections i have, they exist alright but to what end? again i ask this stupid question. i asked ponjaps the other day why he still flirts with women. and he said, he really wanted a GF. and judging from his thoughts, i guess theres really nothing to expect from this guy. No more games for us anymore. i dont know why the excitement is gone. as for barry, id just like to thank God for this guy. though limited to the phone, he's proven himself to be a great buddy.  P.S. I should be going out more to meet more guys. hehe.

      its 1:50 am again. i feel like shit as always. another day has passed yet im still stuck with a problem at hand. i had a nice dream this morning. it was very calming. in my dream, i was able to gather strength to face sir wilson. i dont think i can do it as casually in real life. for a moment, albeit in a dream, i was happy. i was free from all problems. and in that dream too, sir wilson understood me perfectly...it was a very comforting thought indeed.  4:04...i just realized..i miss having a crush..a real guy im attracted to. an inspiration. my moving force. in short, i need a boylet. now!

      Feeling ko ako si Imelda Papin. Parang ang sarap kumanta ng “Isang linggong pagibig”. Pano naman kasi, Lunes nang tayo ay magkakilala. (hehe, lumalabas na ang kabaduyan ko) Kung tutuusin, 5 araw pa lang tayong nagkakausap pero parang bagyo kang nagdaan sa buhay ko. Sinalanta mo ang buhay kong nasanay na sa matagal na katahimikan.  Nung isang linggo lang, hinihimutok ko sa aking kaibigan na isang malaking sumpa na ata ang aking buhay. Paano ba naman, hindi ko maramdaman na ako’y buhay pa. Wala man lang manipestasyon na tumitibok pa ang puso ko, o gumagana pa ang mga emosyon ng sistema ko. Pakiramdam ko, isa akong bato. O kundi man ay isang robot na nabubuhay sa isang  monotonous  (hindi monotonic, tanga ko math ang iniisip ko) na buhay. Paggising sa umaga, pasok sa trabaho at sa gabi naman ay papasok sa klase. Uuwi sa bahay ng pagod sa biyahe at derecho na sa kama madalas. Wala na nga rin akong gimik mashado at ang nightlife kong alam ay ang pag-login sa internet at kausapin ang aking mga barkada doon. Pero walang kuwenta rin.  paulit ulit. Hanggang dumating nga ang Lunes. Bakasyon kinabukasan dahil sa QC day kaya naisipan kong magbabad sa irc. At dun, dun kita nakilala. Sa gabi gabi kong pakikipagchat, wala naman akong hinahanap kundi ang makatagpo ng isang taong makakausap at makikinig sa mga kawalang kwentahan ng buhay ko sa araw araw. At sa konting panahon na nag-usap tayo, nagawa mong bigyan ng excitement ang sistema ko.  Napatawa mo ako at inaliw. Samakatuwid, niyanig mo ang boring kong buhay. Sinagot na nga ata ni Lord ang panalangin kong bigyan ako ng indikasyon na akoy isang tao pa ring marunong makaramdam.  Sa unang gabi pa lang na iyon, dama ko kagad na magka-wavelength tayo. At sa loob loob ko, ako’y natuwa ng labis dahil buwan na rin ang binilang ko nang huli akong makakilala ng taong nakakaintindi sa kin at naiintindihan ko. Basta, masarap ang pakiramdam. Nakakatuwa. Di ko maipaliwanag. Alam ko namang walang patutunguhan ito e. Pero ganun pa man, di pa rin ako mapakali. Parang nakikiliti na ewan. Mabilis ang pangyayari pero hindi pa rin ako makababa sa excited state ko. Pero alam ko, walang patutunguhan ito. Kasi natatakot ako makipagkita sa iyo.  Ayokong mag take ng risk para sa iyo. Alam kong isang laro lang naman ito. Libog lang. Pero ganun pa man, Di ko pa rin kaya patulan. Nakakatuwa pero baka magsisi pa ako sa huli.

         Definition: DEPRESSION :   [n]  sad feelings of gloom and inadequacy    [n]  a sunken or depressed geological formation    [n]  a state of depression and anhedonia so severe as to require clinical intervention    [n]  a mental state characterized by a pessimistic sense of inadequacy and a despondent lack of activity       Synonyms :   clinical depression, depressive disorder     Antonyms :   elation, elevation, natural elevation   im not sure what exactly triggered my depression. one thing's for certain though, i feel really sad today. its a different feeling of sadness. not something that can be relieved by crying or talking to a friend. its a form of gloominess that lingers and persists. its like an undiagnosed disease. like a growing tumor that silently kills you inside.   so why am i feeling this way? one obvious reason is money. i really detest money and the fact that it has caused problems in our family since i was a kid. if i look back and analyze the major setbacks in my life, a common factor is money. its always a "money issue".  now that im technically an  adult , meaning someone who has a stable job and regular salary, im supposed to help out my family regarding money. im not forced by anyone to help or give my share, but somehow there's an invisible force, could be conscience, that tells me that i should do my part. without grudges that is.  and why shouldn't i? my sister has chosen to let go of a comfortable life here in the Philippines to  find greener pastures  in the US. not because of her personal ambitions. not because she wants to live away from us. she did it all for the love of family. for us...  its the same great love that i have for my sis that compels me to control my emotional outbursts against my mom. even if it means hiding my angsts. even if it entails patience and understanding. i will just let all my wounds heal in silence.  this is just one of those  money issues  and this too, hopefully shall pass.

      Here's the result of the  Horny Quiz  i took 5 minutes ago...     I am 27.5% Horny!    urlLink How Horny Are You?    urlLink quiz by midgetfarm.com      27.5%??? What do you expect, someone to just walk up to you and ask you where you want it? You have to go out looking for it.     My Reaction:  i've always believed that results of exams,quizzes or whatever tests one takes is not a good indicator of one's expertise on the subject. not that i am claiming to be (as those pa-conyo kikays would describe it) uber  smart about sex. In fact, i have no knowledge or experience to brag about.Neither do i have the sex appeal to help me get both. So what am i trying to say? I agree with the quiz results. I certainly dont expect someone to walk up to me and ask me where i want it.hell! i dont even think anyone would walk up to me asking for my name.   But given the choice,(despite my sexual reservations), i know what scenario i want. I specifically want Marc Nelson in my room willing to be chained and whipped in my own bed. He will be MY sex slave, MY indulgence inside my purple room  (I guess Freud was right when he said purple signify heightened sexual urges)  wake up, patricia javier-wannabe! hahahaha.

      im on my 6th day of "bumhood" and so far, its been boring. i havent been going out much for a week and its probably because of scarcity of  gimik funds.  by the way, i still have to pay Rhona 300bux. my enthusiasm about the sembreak is diminishing. i dont think ill still have the time to accomplish most of the tasks ive listed down. especially driving. arrgh! i wish i had access to money. it would make my life easier. better. if not happier. which brings me to the   refrigerator dilemma  its been 3 days since our 10 year old Westinghouse finally broke down. my mom and i have been searching for a replacement. unfortunately, there is not enough financial resources for us to buy a brand new unit. so we were left with no choice but to consider  slightly used, working and in good condition  refrigerators. i have high hopes that by the middle of the coming week, we would have settled this issue.    lessons learned:  must have  emergency  money all the time. you'll never know what's going to happen next. always be prepared for the worst.    postcript  i need money. i should ask for money. from ate or dad? tough luck! i should try to make money instead. how? ill be seriously thinking about that.

        DVD # 1:  A Clockwork Orange   TITLE: A Clockwork Orange Produced and Directed by Stanley Kubrick 1971 Warner Bros.   ...There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. . .    Concerning the title from Anthony Burgess' preface in the modern american prints:  "...I do not think so because, by definition, a human being is endowed with free will. He can use this to choose between good and evil. If he can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange--meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound by God or the Devil or (since this is increasingly replacing both) the Almighty State. It is as inhuman to be totally good as it is to be totally evil. ...I don't think I have to remind readers what the title means. Clockwork oranges don't exist, except in the speech of old Londoners. The image was a bizarre one always used for a bizarre thing. "He is as queer as a clockwork orange" meant he was queer to the limit of queerness. It did not primarily denote homosexuality, though a queer, before restricitve legislature came in, was the term used for a member of the inverted fraternity. Europeans who translated the title as Arancia a Orologeria or Orange Mécanique could not understand it Cockney resonance and they assumed that it meant a hand grenade, a cheaper kind of explosive pineapple. I mean it to stand for the application of a mechanistic morality to a living organism oozing with juice and sweetness."    Source: "http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/1974/main.html"   ------------------------------------ This movie is a proof of Stanley Kubrick's eccentricities as a film director. "A CLockwork Orange" instantly became one of my favorite movies. It is full of images only a demented mind can come up with. Its oozing with ultraviolence, sex, art, music and imagination. This is a well-crafted movie which made use of lots of symbolisms. I also enjoyed the parallelisms that i observed between this movie and Kubrick's other movie, "Eyes wide shut". Another nice thing about this film is the brilliance of its main character, Alex, played by Malcolm McDowell. For me, he looks like a young Ewan Mcgregor("Trainspotting" era). I wonder if im the only one on this planet who shares the same observation?  As a final note, I have yet to see a movie from my generation that can offer the same level of cinematic impact as "Clockwork Orange" did to me. This film will definietly be my benchmark for so-called  weird  movies.

      2 down..2 to go..whew!  i can't wait for my exams to end. sembreak here i come!   (not so far-fetched) goals for sembreak   (in no particular hierarchy of importance) 1. watch all the dvds i havent watched (e.g. catch me if you can, eyes wide shut, pulp fiction) and account for the missing discs (silence of the lambs, the professional, a beautiful mind, etc) 2. go back to quiapo and explore the wonderful haven of piracy at the heart of manila (hehehe) 3. read all unfinished pocketbooks (e.g Timeline and Foucault's pendulum (ho-hum) ) 4. implement the standard end-of-sem room clean-up  5. REALLY learn how to drive. arrange schedule with mang Boy.  remember: a MUST this sembreak motivation: will be driving myself to school by second sem. yipee! 6. plan a reasonably-priced vacation. Puerto Galera (or Baguio) seems affordable. Although my ultimate target destination is Pagudpud. 7. fix some car stuff  (kunwari mechanic but its really a no-brainer) mom's been waiting for me to accomplish this 8. check financial status. find other financial resources if possible  di pa tapos..ill repost na lang pag may naisip uli.  key words:  RECHARGE, ENJOY  =)

       Im a loser baby, so why don't you kill me- Beck   Maybe he is right. Maybe I needed to change something about myself. Only that he said it in a rather harsh way. I felt bad about myself last night. The feeling of hurt and self-pity was undeniable last night. I couldn’t, for the life of me, express how much his words cut through my heart. through my soul even. I didn’t know what his intentions were in saying those things to me. I thought we were having a rather plain, fun chat until he blurted out twice “mag-pakababae ka naman minsan” And I did ask him what he meant. And he said he feels sorry for me. He feels sorry at the thought of me being “one of the guys”. And I confidently rebutted that he shouldn’t feel sorry because I don’t. Or maybe I do. But I don’t need another person rubbing it in. What added more insult was the fact that it was the last thing I expected from him. I thought he was one friend who understood me. He can relate to my weaknesses because somehow it mirrored his. He knew how it is to be always at the losing end. He knew how life is fair to some lucky ones and unfair to us. I was so disappointed. My ego was again devastated. And at the end of the conversation, he said that the reason he said those things is because he cared about me. If he did, if he only knew better, then he wouldn’t have said things that could hurt me. And I guess he realized how much his words scarred me. He said that maybe he might regret saying the things he said. I respect this thoughts because that’s how he sees me. And probably, that’s how 99.9 % of the total male population sees me. I can never be the type good enough for them. I can never be someone they can seriously and sincerely love and respect. That’s the reality in MY pathetic life. Thanks to him that I’m back to my senses.

      Here goes the lyrics of my favorite happy song.    I Touch Myself - The Divinyls     I love myself  I want you to love me  When I´m feeling down  I want you above me  I search myself  I want you to find me  I forget myself  I want you to remind me  I don´t want anybody else  When I think about you I touch myself  I don´t want anybody else  Oh no, oh no, oh no  You´re the one who makes me go money You´re the sun who makes me shine  When you´re around I´m always laughing  I want to make you mine  I close my eyes  And see you before me  Think I would die  If you were to ignore me  A fool could see  Just how much I adore you  I get down on my knees  I´d do anything for you  I don´t want anybody else  When I think about you I touch myself  I don´t want anybody else  Oh no, oh no, oh no  I want you  I don´t want anybody else  And when I think about you I touch myself  Ooh, oooh, oooooh, aaaaaah

I will control my emotions during class.... I will control my emotions during class....   A teacher's prayer  James J. Metcalf   I want to teach my students how--  To live this life on earth,  To face its struggles and its strife  And to improve their worth.   Not just the lesson in a book,  Or how the rivers flow,  But to choose the proper path,  Wherever they may go.   To understand eternal truth,  And know right from wrong,  And gather all the beauty of  A flower and a song,   For if I help the world to grow  In wisdom and grace,  Then I feel that I have won  And I have filled my place.   And so I ask your guidance, God  That I may do my part,  For character and confidence  And happiness of heart.  AMEN   Lord, please help me overcome this semester.

        "This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."     -Edward Norton in Fight Club  I can’t think of anything nice or interesting to say. Its 3:33 am as I write this down and I woke up 1:11 hours ago. Note the symmetry on the numbers specified...I think im getting worse each day. Although I have successfully battled my depression, there are still lots of other mental issues to be dealt with. For one, my insomnia or whatever sleeping disorder I have seems incurable. There's nothing surprising about this since I don’t recall having normal sleeping habits ever in my entire life.  As far as I can remember, back in elementary, I would complain about not being able to sleep at night and oversleeping during the day. It sucks when you think about it. It’s like losing control over your body. Instead of doing it the normal way, living a normal life where one wakes up just as the sun rises and dozing off just as the late night news ends, I am trapped in my vicious schedule. This is so inconvenient for me because there are activities that can only be done during daytime. This partially explains why I haven't completed tasks such as registering for the election, processing my passport, learning how to drive and so on and so forth. Another issue I have to face is my paranoia, which for obvious reasons, escalates around any time near the opening of classes or any time im supposed to be concentrated on my thesis. Good thing though, around the same time too, I am suddenly armed, (or gifted) with an  adviser detector  which prevents me from bumping into my advisers unexpectedly. I know this is not the proper way of dealing with problems. my clever delaying tactics and all would just prolong my problems' existence. Hence, I must formulate my second-sem-defense-plan before classes start next week, which would most probably include a letter addressed to my dear adviser. Last issue I have to resolve is my addiction to the internet. There's no other way of looking at it but a gross obsession to the use of internet. the best example is happening right now. just when I thought I have tricked my body into sleeping, I surprisingly woke up without an alarm or any distraction. It is of course, impossible for me to go back to sleep, that’s why I am gravitated towards my PC and the internet again. and again. waiting for  something and nothing, for someone and no one.

       Smorgasbord      natawa ako paggising ko kaninang umaga dahil naaalala ko ang napanaginipan ko. si russell crowe. hahaha. di ko lam baket ko siya napaginipan. weird nga e. wala naman akong napanood na pelikula niya recently. o kahapon ko nga ba nakita yung  trailer  ng Master and Commander (God save us? eklavoo???!) sa panaginip ko, nasa isang party ata kami tapos kasama ko ang aking mga barkada at nagmamalaki ako na lalapitan ko si russell at makikipag-kwentuhan sa kanya. naaalala kong pinagyayabang ko sa kanila na kaya kong makipag-chikahan tungkol sa gladiator. weird. nagising na ako pagkatapos nun. sana sexual na lang ang panaginip ko kasama si russell crowe. na naka gladiator costume siya ha. hahaha.   -----------------------------------------     kahapon din, nagisang taon na palang  namatay ang aso kong si Filart. kanina habang pauwi ako, nagmumuni-muni ako kasi iniisip ko, baka nagtatampo na si Filart sa akin kasi nakalimutan ko na siya. siguro nga ay nabawasan ang pag-alala ko kay Filart kasi may bago na akong  baby , si Jarmaine. pero siyempre, di ko pa rin malilimutan ang una kong aso. ang pinakamamahal kong si Filart lalo na't kami talaga ang nagpalaki sa kanya mula ng siya'y 3 buwan pa lang. siya kasi yung dahilan kung bakit ko nagustuhan mag-alaga ng aso. siya ang nagtuto sa aking magmahal. kaya para sa yo Filart,  I love you ! naniniwala ako na magkikita pa rin tayo.   -----------------------------------------  mamaya ay pupunta ata kami ng sementeryo para dalawin ang puntod ng aking pinakamamahal na lolo. ang tawag ko sa kanya ay Papa. mahigit sampung taon na pala nung namatay si Papa. unti-unti na ring nabubura ang mga ala-ala ko kay Papa sa tagal na rin panahon. sabagay, napakabata ko pa nang namatay siya. nasa gradeskul pa lang ako noon. pero isa lang ang masasabi ko tungkol sa kanya. pag nalulungkot ako ngayon at nagmumukmok dahil lagi kong nararamdaman na walang nagmamahal sa akin, iniisip ko ang panahon na buhay pa si Papa kasi alam ko na mahal na mahal niya ako. hindi ko nga alam kung bakit sa dami naman ng apong nauna sa akin ay parang espesyal talaga ako sa kanya. sana nga lang napadama ko sa kanya na mahal na mahal ko rin siya. sana nabubuhay pa ang Papa ngayon, sana proud siya sa mga na-achieve ko na kahit papaano. sana nakita niya ang aso ko, ang bahay namin, ang kotse namin. siguro mageenjoy siya sa garden namin. Papa, i love you po. magkikita rin po tayo..mahal na mahal ko po kayo at sana proud pa rin kayo sa akin.     note: magpopost ako ng pic ng Papa ko pag may nascan na akong matino.  -----------------------------------------    putek! di pa rin ako inaantok. nakausap ko na nga si ate sa YM pero di pa rin ako makatulog. wala na nga akong kausap e pero wala e. magtataka pa ba ako at di ako tamaan ng antok? isang grande ba naman na Almond Mocha Joy at isang tall na White Chocolate Mocha ang lagukin ko kanina sa megamall e. hay. sarap ng kape.  kelan kaya ako may kakapehin uli ?

       me and the coriolis effect   Be very, very careful what you put into that head,because you will never, ever get it out.  Thomas Cardinal Wolsey (1471-1530)   this is the third and probably the last post i will talk about cerebral jack. and so the "jouney" ends. as i write this, a very annoying videoke-crazed guy is heard singing an incomprehensible song in the background. today is undeniably a gloomy day. i have noticed an abrupt change in my cheerful mood. i didnt receive any text messages today, save for one from 2299, an automatic horoscope text. how pathetic can i get?  ive been raving about my positive state for weeks. but now, the happiness has down spiralled. all because of one interesting stranger (OIS) one terrible haircut, a handful of horoscope readings and a load of insecurities. wtf? backtrack two days ago when OIS and i sort of agreed on meeting up finally. the meeting was supposed to happen today, saturday. in my mind, saturday is fine since ive got plans of going out with my upsys friends. i was thinking i could meet OIS after my pasiklab EB. i knew in my heart that i was ready to meet him. he is wholesome and decent anyway. friday night came and i found myself chatting with him on YM. he asked me about THE meeting and i just couldnt say yes. all my insecurities and worries got the better of me. i ended up saying silly excuses and saying sorry and goodbye to him. what was i thinking? it was just an EB and it scared the shit out of me. certified T-A-N-G-A. im obviously a girl with many issues, not worth his efforts, not as smart as he thought. i have a collection of issues to enumerate and unleash. and for that, i have lost the chance of meeting this interesting guy who could make me laugh and smirk in anger at the same time. Too bad i passed up something which couldve been fun.  The realization that i have not succeeded on believing in myself and forgetting all about my insecurities, made me lose my "happy self". i wish i can take away this awful feeling right now.

       Doesn't it feel like Christmas?    Doesn’t it feel like Christmas (It feels lovely) Doesn’t it feel like Christmas (Feels so lovely) Doesn’t it feel like Christmas (Whoa) Yes it feels like Christmas Doesn’t it feel like Christmas (It feels lovely) Doesn’t it feel like Christmas (Feels so lovely) Doesn’t it feel like Christmas (The spirit of Christmas) Yes it feels like Christmas   - destiny's child "8 days of Christmas"  its freezing cold again in what Dranreb refers to as "the summer capital of antipolo". (the only funny joke he ever delivered, hehe) and im awake in this early morning because i was sleeping practically all day. we partied all night and stayed together until 3 pm. to say that our barkada's Christmas party was "fun" is an understatement. it was a Blast! for one, it was the first theme party we ever had. i was excited about the whole concept of donning Oriental costumes but at the same time quite unsure whether my friends would be "game" enough to participate. Im pretty sure rhona,val,jaki would willingly dress up for the occasion but to my surprise, almost everybody who attended last night's Mano Po-inspired party were at their best physically and otherwise. *applause for everyone*  its freezing cold still here in my room, (here in the dark, in this lonely hours ahehe) but i couldnt help but smile and be thankful to God that im blessed with my family (mom,ate,dad) and friends who love me and whom i love as much. i dont even feel incomplete at all.  ------------  postscript:  the postscript section of my blogspot is slowly becoming my dream journal section. hehe. well it just occurred to me that i had again the weirdest dream recently. sometime this week, im not sure exactly what day it was, i dreamed that i was reunited with my childhood classmate (it was anthony dacayo i think) and for some weird reasons, he has loved me all his life, and he wants me. the reason why i liked this dream is that i loved the feeling that it gave me. for one moment in my life, i felt truly appreciated by a man romantically. kilig pala. i guess i'd just have to wait for that dream to be realized. and i have a good feeling God will permit that to happen. :) (wag nga lang sana si anthony dacayo rin hehe)

       on internet "diversions"   i hate to admit it but i actually like having internet "diversions". I am delighted to entertain a few of them once in a while. Two of the  most recent ones are from irc. Their handles are Holden and eloquent. Here are their profiles and stories.     1. Holden - 27/m/rizal, real nick is sherwin. from what i remember, he works in an insurance firm although he graduated as med tech from UST. the reason why i liked this guy is because i had the most interesting chat with him a month ago. it was one of those "serious" sensible chats. but i knew it was gonna be an ONIC (one-night interesting chat). i never expected to chat with him again since at that time, he was still attending a seminar at springfield, MA. a week or two later, i got the shock of my life when he called and texted me one lazy morning. what followed were exchanges of interesting messages. (un)fortunately, after some time, he revealed his true colors. he didnt waste time and told me what he had in mind. and so the interest and all the "kilig" died down. he is a pervert (which he denies) and just wanted to score. a pervert equipped with intelligence is actually quite tempting but my instinct tells me i shouldn't give in. as usual.  2. eloquent - 23/m/qc, real nick is jack. UP grad. according to him polisci graduate. he works with stocks in ortigas.  he is i think, my most interesting find in chat. comparable to ponjaps' or friday's level of intelligence. he is very smart and his eloquence and wit are charming. disarming even. unlike in holden's case, my 1st encounter with jack didnt make an impact to me. for me, he was just like those guys who would ask for your pic,number,stats, etc. he texted right after we chatted and i didnt give a damn. he texted again and he became my source of annoyance for 3 days or more. he is interesting and quite intimidating since he expresses himself well. i can sense that he is one decent guy but then again, if he is, howcome he seems so desperate in meeting me? and he is also too impatient and assuming for me. he would get irritated when i reply late to his texts and would not hesitate to express his sarcasm. the good thing is, he's stopped annoying me since 7:30 am of dec 11th. the bad thing is, i miss the attention. ive always admired men who can "tame" and overpower me. Cerebral jack however has become scarce lately. tsk.  ----------------  postscript :i had a weird dream. around 10-15 of my students actually are protesting about my teaching style and capabilities. it made me cry. and then the dream shifted to the next scene. i remember being in the company of TJ, some young actor (wendel ramos ata) and some old actor (eddie garcia ata) the sexual tension was high. i was sitted beside TJ, who was sitting beside eddie, while wendell was standing a few meters away from us. eddie wants to have sex with TJ but wendel wants eddie and of course, as in real life, im attracted to TJ. wendell agreed i will take care of TJ and him of eddie. and that was the end of it. couldnt have been more BITIN, could it? naturally, i woke up desiring sex. too much pent up heat i should say..

       Adoracion's resurrection PART I   its been more than a month since i lost blogged. not my choice really. its just that ive been busy with a lot of things. i will be writing updates of whats going on in my life by topic.    school  ive been holding my lecture class for more than a month (if my math is reliable enough) and so far, so good. i remember the first day i met with my class, which by the way, consists of 99 students) i was overwhelmed by their mere presence in the big room.overwhelmed but relaxed at the same time. i actually managed to distribute all their class cards and brief them with the usual guidelines given at the start of the sem. anyway, after a while, ive gotten used to the routine. no more butterflies in my stomach as i anticipate each day of lecture. i can say that im more confident (albeit boring and corny at times) in teaching them. i just hope i wont lose the enthusiasm until the end of the sem. whew! tall order aint it? so far, my connection to my students is ok. they still manage to laugh and react most of the time anyway. unfortunately, my responsiblity of imparting knowledge is not well taken care of. i hope to improve by january 2004. =)    puerto galera  first things first. the trip actually materialized. thank God. it was a good one. by far, my best out of town trip. ill probably do a separate blog on this when time permits. my stories will be highlighted with pictures. that will be all for now...   Mariah Carey's concert  we're so back in the grind! lolz. we watched mariah concert last nov 17 at the Fort. there were just four of us,me, rhona, val and jaki. the event went well. we were even able to buy cheap tickets thanks to Globe's mariah ringtone promo. the ticket which originally was being offered for 500 bucks was sold for 309. a great deal for any show featuring an international artist. i guess the term  diva  fits mariah to a T. i remember being a fan of hers back in hs when my dad and sis bought all her albums. i stopped liking her when she changed her image and singing style. her manila concert however, brought me back to my senses. im a mariah carey fan once again.    Magic 89.9's Voices  the whirlwind magic connection proved one thing.."if there's a will there's a way" i almost had a nervous breakdown because ive been trying to win Voices tickets for a week and failed miserably. i joined every text contest, and stayed up late just to listen to DJs i never liked. i even managed to "win" one green day greatest hits CD and one sixth sense VCD. up until sunday, we have 0 tickets. i was in a dilemma sunday night because the chances of getting tickets for the show depended on Me. the burden is too heavy. luckily, my mom and jaki volunteered to accompany me to magic monday morning. [some parts missing]...the rest is history. we couldnt have gotten even half of a ticket without my mom. she was able to tame Ponci. and the story ended happily with 7 of us watching the voices 2 finals with free Italiani's food. i would gladly miss another lecture class for something like this to happen again.

       Guilty Pleasures  i took a 2-day holiday. it felt good. and it also felt right. yesterday, i just stayed in the house. trying to think things over. (im having those doubts again about my career in physics) anyway, back to my story. today, i was supposed to meet aileen at sm north for a much-needed "reunion". havent seen her since her birthday celebration at gerry's. i was quite excited with the idea of meeting her in a weekday, during my day-off as lecturer. unfortunately, "something came up" said her text this morning. and since, i was all dressed up for school, i cant go back to my bed and forget everything there is to look forward to in my day. so, i went to UP to deliver my cartman-stamped recit quizzes and off i went to makati. wait..around 5 minutes before deciding on going to Makati, i checked my pay check at UP cashier. unfortunately again, my watch and the office's clock arent synchronized. they had their lunch break a minute before theyre supposed to..in my watch that is. instead of making this ruin my day, i decided to still push through with my plan. i hailed a cab and after about 20 mins, i arrived at glorietta. it was a liberating feeling. =) i dont quite remember when was the last time i went there all by myself. i had lots of activities in my mind. i imagined myself checking papers while sipping my almond mocha joy. i imagined myself watching Calendar girls and enjoying it. i imagined buying myself a pair of jeans on sale at marks and spencer and buying stuffs from Lush for mommy. whew. it was just my imagination.  i didnt have that much money. what really transpired this afternoon is this: i went directly to glorietta theater to find a movie to watch. i decided on kill bill. theres no other movie that seemed worth the price ill pay. i almost watched last samurai by the way. thank god its screening time is 3 hrs. haha. i wouldve killed myself for wasting my money and time for what-i-guess is a lousy movie. so i bought myself a frosty treat to enjoy inside the theater. for a moment there, i forgot my diet. hehe. (just an update, my erratic weighing scale tells me that i ALREADY lost 10 pounds. unbelievable. i thought i already lost 20.) so, i entered the cinema. the eerie feeling of being alone hit me. but soon it became alright. makati isnt a scary or judgmental place anyway. so..there i was. sitting alone. with my frosty cupped between my hands. i was ecstatic. the first scene i caught was the famous whistle scene. jaw drops. its not like i havent seen the movie before. it was awesome. the cinema created a different impact thats for sure. even the sound was crisp, the lines clearer, the music more haunting. there was also so much blood. but i didnt mind. i was actually enjoying the movie. i never thought i would. (the first and only time i watched a movie alone prior to this was 7 years ago. the movie-a life less ordinary- was totally hillarious.) so there. i asked rhona to meet me after  the movie and i almost didnt realize it was time to go. i couldve stayed there for another round. =) but of course, i had to meet rhona. finding all the landmarks (Landmark) i needed to reach seattle's best gb3. and there she was. sitting like a muse looking at the splendid fountain area. to catch her attention..i gave her my psst and a little tap on the shoulder. and i became happier. there i was at greenbelt with my friend rhona until 6pm. enjoying each other's company. hehe..i hope. theres no comparison really between the joy i had alone and the joy i had with rhona. both made me realize how lucky i am and that i have a lot to be thankful for. =) (im hoping against hopes that there will come a time that i will be spending my day with the same feeling of happiness and liberation with a guy i like and remember every detail like i did today)

       HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!   The start of a year wouldn't be complete without making resolutions. Here are some of the things i'd like to do or change for 2004.  1.   diet and exercise.   ive always included diet in my resolutions for the last 10 years or more. for this year, ive included "exercise" which i think is the best way to slim down. i dont intend though to do to the gym right away. i dont  have the luxury to do that. ill start with "baby steps" that is, ill just motivate my body to welcome physical activities. ill walk more, maybe ill jog around UP, ill try not to sit most of the time. so there. i hope to see some changes after six months.   2.  be serious.  this is just a mindset id like to have towards my career (both work and academics). i have yet to convince myself that i NEED to graduate and actually finish my MS degree. so i guess, ill just have to do that gradually. start with being involved with research which i REALLY hate doing. Regarding my teaching job, ill try my best to do what i have to do. one thing i dont want to happen is to lose my enthusiasm towards work.   3. build up confidence.  i have learned a lot from my encounters with different people during the Christmas break. and i realized that i really lack confidence.one of my goals is to develop my language skills. hehe. i realized that i may be smart and everything, but when it comes to really speaking up and talking to someone in straight conversational English, im a failure. kakahiya! to think that i know i enjoy dealing with Jacks and Antons out there. [insert naughty smile here]  which brings me to my last resolution..  4.  let love grow.  if there's one thing i want to happen for this year, it will hands down be finding a man who will love me, who will be proud of me, who will stand by me. there were 2 instances last year when i felt i was full of love in my heart. i feel the need to share and shower that love to someone who deserves it , any time of the day. may this be the "lucky" year.   All these resolutions of course, i hope to accomplish with God's grace. may i find the right motivation and inspiration to achieve all of them. amen. =)

       sisihin ang pebrero   tangna. pebrero 1 na. dapat nga ba akong ngumuyngoy? sa totoo lang, excited ako kasi pebrero na.  panahon na naman..ng pag-ibig.  nakakatakot pero nakakaexcite kasi pebrero na. lahat ng tao, feeling ko lang, feeling  mga romantiko. eh kahit nga ako na si ms. unemotional eh tinatablan din pala ng pebrero e pano pa kaya ang ibang tao? nakakahiya man aminin, ako na ata ang pinakaexcited na tao sa pebrero 14. hindi dahil may boypren na ako, o may manliligaw akong magbibigay ng bulaklak. wala. di ko alam dahilan bat ako kinikilig sa pebrero. mas mabuti pa nga nung isang taon e. ginulintang ako sa mga pangyayari. may mabait kasi akong kaibigang nagngangalang jomig na gusto ata ipadama sa akin kung pano dapat itrato ang isang babae lalo na pag valentine's. subalit ngayong taon, wala akong jomig na magpapasaya sa akin sa isang sorpresang ganun. pero ok lang. kasi masaya naman ako e. wala namang kakulangan na bumabagabag sa akin. wala namang paghahangad sa isang lalaki. walang mga issues na ganun. mabuti naman. Nung nag-usap kami ni aileen kagabi, sumagi sa isip ko ang tanong na ito. Bakit ko ba gusto magkaroon ng boypren/karelasyon? at naisip ko, wala talagang angat na dahilan e. sa akin, gusto ko lang yung intimacy. un bang feeling ng balat o init mula sa katawan ng isa pang tao. hindi sa anupamang kahayukan, pero yun bang touchy feeling. nagiinit ang puso ko sa tuwa pag ganun e. kahit pag sa kaibigan lang. eh pano pa kaya sa taong mahal mo at mahal ka? naks. inlove nga talaga ang mga tao kahit walang dahilan. o kung may dahilan man, mashado lang pinalaki sa isipan. =) ginagawang focal point kumbaga. tapos ginawan ng issue. *boom* ganun kabilis. hehe. parang yung kay -----. mabuti na lang walang nagbabasa ng blog ko kundi..gusto ko na ata maniwala na lahat ng matinong lalake sa mundo, kung hindi bakla ay taken na. so si ----- asa category nung una. nga ba? di ko pa rin alam e. parang opinyon ko laban sa opinyon ng iba ang nangyayari e. tingin nila lahat siya ay bading. tingin ko rin minsan yun sa kanya e. kaya ako nanghihinayang. kasi okei siya. okei naman kami e. masaya nga ako pag kasama ko siya. in a girlfriend-barkada sort of way. ligawan ko nga daw e sabi ni aileen. hahaha. so ako pa pala magdamubs. anak ng tokwa. di bale na lang. naisip ko baka naman pag sinagot ako nun, di na maging fun ang samahan namin. corny. nagsayang lang ako ng bulaklak at saka chocolate. lolz. siya nga pala, ineentertain ko ang idea na ito dahil sa isang pangyayari nung biyernes. di ko nga lam kung matatawa ako sa idea e. pero natigilan ako at di nakapagsalita sa nasabi ng lola mo sa akin. tsk. crush niya pala ako. di niya naman kasi sinabi kagad e.

       More than this there is nothing   I could feel at the time there was no way of knowing fallen leaves in the night who can say where they're blowing? as free as the wind and hopefully learning why the Sea on the Tide has no way of turning...  More than this... there is nothing more than this... tell me one thing more than this... there is nothing  It was fun for a while  there was no way of knowing  like a dream in the night  who can say where we're going? no care in the world  maybe I'm learning  why the Sea on the Tide  has no way of turning...  More than this... there is nothing more than this... tell me one thing more than this...  ************************************************* "more than this" is sung by Bill Murray in the movie "lost in translation" i guess the song pretty much captures the theme of the movie. =) a relationship that doesn't require a "something", a commitment, a formality or a name even. it could just exist as it is. it doesnt require a reason for its existence. it encompasses all rationale for its being. in my experience, most of the memorable and happy enocunters or "relationships" i ever had belong to this category. im not sure if having 2 such undefined relationships at the moment should make me happy. but truthfully, im glad that THEY* exist to brighten my life.   disclaimer: *THEY - the relationships im referring to are figments of my overworked imagination. id like to think that they actually exist albeit undefined.

       TIIS (`tang ina im shingles)  Herpes Zoster (shingles)  Herpes zoster, also known as shingles or zoster, is a viral infection caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. Anyone who's had chicken pox can develop herpes zoster. The virus remains dormant or inactive in certain nerve root cells of the body and only when it reactivates does zoster occur. About 20 percent of those people who have had chicken pox will get zoster at some time during their lives. Fortunately, most people will get zoster only once.  The first symptom of zoster is burning pain, tingling or extreme sensitivity in one area of the skin usually limited to one side of the body. This may be present for one to three days before a red rash appears at that site. There may also be fever or headache. The rash soon turns into groups of blisters that look a lot like chicken pox. The blisters generally last for two to three weeks. The blisters start out clear but then pus or dark blood collects in the blisters before they crust over (scab) and begin to disappear. The pain may last longer. It is unusual but possible to have pain without blisters or blisters without pain.  and if these words are not enough to freak anyone out, here's what it looks like:       gross? yep. painful? yep. i hope to get well soon. *insert grin here*

       TangInit!!!!!   Arrgh. pucha ang init na naman. kung meron lang sana akong supplier ng putik, tinawagan ko na kanina pa at pinapuno ko ang bath tub para makapaglublob ako. kung may aircon lang sana ang kwarto ko. hay. nakakatamad ang ganitong klaseng init. wala kang magawang matino sa araw mo. nakakatamad naman lalo lumabas kasi ang init init lumabas. bago mo pa marating at malanghap ang aircon ng mall, naexpose mo na ang sarili mo sa skin cancer. shet. so ano ang pwdeng gawin kapag ganito ang sitwasyon? kanina, nag try akong gumawa ng mga "productive" na bagay. pagkagising ko kanina, nagbasa ako ng libro. Yung binabasa ko ngayon ay yung  Runaway Jury . napanood ko ito kamakailan sa dvd tapos naisip ko, siguro di hamak na mas maganda ang libro. hindi naman sa panget ang pelikula pero tipikal sa mga John Grisham adaptations, walang sinabi ang sine sa libro. sinuwerte lang ako kasi nung napadpad ako sa booksale, ayun nandun siya.  binili ko rin kasama nun ang  The Godfather . baligtad naman ang kaso nitong huli. di ko pa napapanood ang pelikula pero gusto ko muna basahin ang libro para may ideya ako. ang laki ng topak ko talaga. Hindi pa nga pala ako nangangalahati sa librong binabasa ko. Mabagal talaga ako magbasa ng libro. di ko alam kung bakit pero ganun talaga. may habit pa nga ako na nakakatulog ako pag sumobra na sa 50 pages ang nabasa ko. hehe.  pero determinado ako na tapusin ang 2 librong yan ngayong bakasyon. May blog ako na nabasa na ang goal niya ay 20 books a year. Mas magiging realistic ako at itatry ko na 10 books ang mabasa ko ngayong taon. nakakamiss din naman kasing magbasa e. kakaibang disiplina ang kailangan. nasanay na kasi ako mashado sa panonood ng sine at tv na minsan, hindi na ako nag-iisip. yun ang challenge na binibigay ng pagbabasa ng libro. isa pang ginawa ko ngayong araw para makalimutan ang init ay ang patulan ang coloring book ko. may 3 akong magkakaibang coloring books ngayon na binigay ni kristelle noong pasko. di ko pa sila natatapos kulayan dahil binubuklat ko lang naman sila kapag feel ko magpaka-artist o magpaka-childish, or magpaka-childish na artist. kanina, naka isang page lang ako sa coloring book. first time kong ginamitan ng pastel ang aking "obra maestra" at mukang maayos naman ang kinalabasan. hehe. amateurish diba? pero yun nga ang point. kung gusto ko magpakadalubhasa, eh di sana bumili na ako ng sketchpad at oil paint.   Yung pangatlong attempt ko para makalimot sa init ay ang panonood ng dvd. matagal-tagal na rin akong di nakanood ng dvd. nagsawa na rin ata ako ng kaunti siguro dahil wala ako mashadong bagong mga titulo. buti na lang, may isa pa akong na-save na dvd. Yung Big Fish . matagal ko nang ginustong panoorin ito hindi nga lang natutuloy sapagkat panget yung nauna kong kopya. halos 2 oras ata ang tinakbo ng pelikula at di naman ako ganun nagandahan. sa totoo nga lang, di ko nakuha ang gusto ipahiwatig ni tim burton. naging mababaw ang dating sa akin ng  father-son conflict . kulang kumbaga sa lalim at emosyon. may mga elemento rin naman akong nagustuhan sa pelikula. una ay si ewan mcgregor. paborito ko naman talaga si ewan e so good choice. sa pelikula, makikiata mo talaga na genuine yung pagportray niya ng character niya. pag sinabing magmukha siyang tanga, ganun na nga ang makikita mo. yung ibang artista hindi ko sila kilala lahat pero maayos naman ang pagganap. gusto ko rin yung striking resemblance ni jessica lange at yung gumanap na batang sandra templeton. nagmukha tuloy maganda si jessica sa paningin ko sa unang pagkakataon.hehe. isa pang elemento na nagustuhan ko ay ang pagkakabuo ng pelikula tim burton style. kilala siya sa pagiging mystical ang treatment sa mga pelikula.    at ganun na nga ang napanood ko. may giants, may siamese twins, may midget, circus, may i love sandra sa clouds. eye candy talaga pag si tim ang gumawa. sana gumawa siya uli ng medyo dark na pelikula gaya ng  Nigthmare before Christmas  pero imbes na clay animation, tao na talaga. sa ngayon, mukang hopeless na may magawa pa akong mas productive sa araw ko. mag alas-4 na at pababa na rin ang araw kahit mainit pa rin. siguro, ililigo ko na lang ito ng mga 2 oras (hehe) at ikakain ng ice cream. May 2 pa naman akong flavors ngayon.

       When Am I Going To Die?   if you go to this site,  urlLink death clock , you will find out when you'll sa buh-bye to this world. these are my results:        the clock requires you to input the following: sex, birthdate, BMI index and current smoking status. Obviously, theyre basing their "prediction" on the kind of lifestyle you have. The more your BMI deviates from the ideal figure, the less likely you'll die soon. The less you smoke, the less probability for you to suffer health risks. in terms of gender, i guess women in general live longer than men. true to how the site decribes its purpose, Death Clock(TM),  is just the Internet's friendly reminder that life is slipping away, second by second. You can take it seriously though and live your "remaining" days as best as you can. Do all the stuffs you want to do and make an effort at achieving your goals. Life is too short anyway for you to waste your days away.

       80s ang drama   (musicmatch playing I Melt with You by Modern English)   ------------ comment lang sa huli kong entry. *turo sa last entry* pathetic nga. harhar. naghahanap lang talaga ako ng source of depression. anyway, nakausap ko na siya uli at mukang di na nga kami madalas magakakausap at baka nga hindi na talaga kasi iba na sked niya. ok lang yun. (/me makes mental note to ask him to teach me how to burn dvds kung may susunod pang chat) ------------  so there. pwede na akong magsimula uli. so weird na naman ang schedule ko now. i tried my best to sleep early tiniis ko di matulog ng isang araw para maadjust ang body clock ko. kaso, hanggang 12 ko lang kaya matulog. nagising na naman ako. kaya ako nandito pa rin ngayon. I went to UP yesterday to help in the registration. ok naman ang araw. masaya in fact. i actually missed everything about UP, NIP and my friends and colleagues. anyway, ill be back there later this afternoon. badtrip nga pala kanina kasi dun sa reg room, nagkataon na may 2 akong students na naibagsak ko. si caissa at si brian. la lang. kahit kasalanan naman nila bat sila naka 5.0 sa akin, feeling ko pa rin kasalanan ko. naguilty ako. ni hindi kami magkatinginan ng maayos kanina. as in nagiiwasan. or am i just paranoid? ------------  ang saya saya kasi nagsosound trip ako ngayon ng 80s. dahil yan kay aileen e. kausap ko siya sa YM kanina tapos nabanggit niya yung  come on eileen  na kanta. ang happy. tapos naisip niya na ok siguro theme ang 80s sa party. wahahaha. :evilgrin: i say "Perfect!" hehe. sorry na lang mga barkada ko. 80s ang magiging theme ng birthday ko. gawa na ako invitation. joke. isip na ako. yey. mukang masaya ito. :) patulong ako kay jaki magorganize. wahehehe. *fun fun* ------------  kausap ko pala si ate kanina. kasama niya si trish. andun na sila kay daddy sa wisconsin ngayon. saya no? theyre lucky to have each other. =) anyway, nagshare ang sis ko na masama loob niya kasi di daw siya ibili ng kotse ng tatay ko. hehe. nagpapakabrat na naman sis ko. buti napagsabihan ko (kelangan ko pa magdrama no although madrama naman talaga yung nishare ko, no hard feelings para sa tatay ko though) sabi niya she feels better na daw after. good! mission accomplished! ahehe. i really love my sister. :D ------------  yan na lang muna. kakain na ata ako ng breakfast. ill be starting my day. hmm..share ko lang pala. i had a dream 2 days ago. weird lang kasi naputol ang dila ko. tapos kinakabit ko. i will try to find an interpretation to that.wahehe. tangina. i always have weird dreams about my tongue, gums and teeth. is this some warning about my dental health? lolz. ciao!

       When God closes an aperture, he opens a slit   sheesh. malala na ata ako. hehe. look at my bangag title. very in tune with the lenten season and yet, very physics. anyway, mejo sad lang talaga ako. i havent spoken to my current fave chatmate for almost one week. (i think) Ang weird na i could go on and on counting the days pass me by without his usual presence online. =( not that it implies any romantic longing on my part, i just miss talking to him. i miss talking endlessly with this cool, wholesome guy. so ganun. wala namang kelangang kilay na tumaas, butas ng ilong na lumaki kapag sinabi kong namimiss ko siya. kahit naman kasi pigain ko ang utak ko sa kakaisip ng dahilan kung baket di siya nagoonline, wala rin ako makukuha kasi wala akong idea. di naman ganun ang level of "friendship" namin. we hardly know personal stuffs about each other. kahit nga name e. which is fine by me. nasanay lang talaga ako na kausap ko siya about dvds.Eh pag meron ako bago dvd, wala naman nakakarelate sa mga raves ko. eh tawag na nga namin sa kanya ni aileen, davide e. (d-v-d, gets?) hahaha. waah! gusto ko lang naman ay yung may kausap na nagegets ako at the same time naiimpart ang mga trips niya at kaalaman niya sa akin. in fairness, ang dami niya talaga naituro sa akin na techie stuffs. =) hay naku! sabi ko na malala na ako e. ganun na ba ka-scarce ang matinong kausap sa chat? hehe. muka na naman akong desperate no? finding my "joy" through chat. eh ano ngayon, wala ako paki kung mababaw ako o mukang desperate. to each his own. Ano magagawa ko e insomniac ako. Adik pa ako mag-online. pero, kakamiss pa rin talaga. wala akong makausap na matino!!!! kasawa na ang "asl pls?","friendster u?". haha. puhlease. pero come to think of it, la naman talaga akong pinanghahawakan sa aking fave chatmate na ito at ganun din siya sa akin. we can just go on with our lives. nothing's really lost. sige okei na nga ako. lolz.

       Fantastic Fantasia      Congratulations to Fantasia Barrino, the new American Idol! Although I am one of Fantasia's fans right from the start, at the end of the contest, I became unsure of her chances of winning the title.Diana Degarmo posted herself as a big threat at the very last minute. I really thought that America would vote for the younger, equally-talented Diana Degarmo. Luckily, Fantasia's performance on finals night sealed her victory. The night before the finals, I was trying to consider the idea of Diana being a good singer, and perhaps even better than Fantasia. I tried to be as objective as a i can while listening to all their MP3's from soul night to the final showdown. Theres no doubt that Diana can sing. She can hit those high notes, she can set the right mood especially when she performs upbeat songs and she's definitely a powerhouse. At 16, she really knows how to perform in front of a large audience. However, my only reservation about Diana is that she doesn't have Fantasia's unique personality. She doesnt encourage ME to listen to her. Diana can sing alright, but she just gives us a good imitation most of the time. For instance, whenever she sings Celine Dion songs, you would hardly notice any difference in her and Celine's version. On the other hand, Fantasia has no problem injecting her style to each and every song she chooses. Even if she picks the simplest or weirdest songs, you'll never get tired of listening to them because there is that added spunk. There's always the fantasia yeah yeah-raspy-yet fun-voice that brings out the difference. And thats fantastic Fantasia for you. She may not have the looks or the body of an average Pop Star, but she certainly has a humongous talent, much bigger than her lips.  Here's a list of all the songs she performed:  1.  Signed Sealed Delivered 2.  Always on My Mind 3.  I Heard it Through the Grapevine 4.  Something About the Way you look tonight 5.  Summertime 6.  Its a Miracle 7.  Get on Your Feet 8.  Crazy Little Thing Called Love 9.  What are you doing the rest of your life 10. Holding Out for a Hero 11. Knock on Wood 12. Chain of Fools 13. Fool in Love 14. Greatest Love of All 15. All My life 16. I Believe

       My Prayer    If the only prayer you say in your whole life is "thank you,"  that would suffice.  -Meister Eckhart  I would like to express my gratitude to the Lord for all His wonderful blessings, especially the surprises He showered upon me this week. It's really amazing how, why and when God chooses to perform his miracles. He blesses us at the most unexpected times.   Looking back at my recent posts, it is quite obvious that i was troubled with my worries about school, work and my life in general. I couldn't imagine how it was still possible to straighten things out. I thought there was no other option for me but to leave the institute the soonest i can.   Nevertheless, this particular experience has taught me one thing, i should never give up on anything knowing that God will always be there to back me up.Thanks again God and i offer this humble prayer for you. I love you, Dear Lord:   Thank you lord for making my life easier for me. Thanks for the patience of my advisers. Thanks for the company of my friends. Thanks for the money i received today.  Thanks for the safe trip of my mom.  and most of all, Thanks for not giving up on me. Amen.

       PASAPORTE   urlLink    passport to success??&nbsp; urlLink      "A man has only one destiny" - Don Vito Corleone, The Godfather  I finally got a passport. I will never have to listen to my mom say her classic passport litany:  "gumising ka ng maaga anak,    Punta tayo sa DFA ng alas kwatro ng umaga    Magpa-passport ka na"    When my passport was finally delivered to our house, i felt a different sense of pride. Shallow but true. I wonder how i will react once my US visa is approved...(but thats going to be a different blog entry..in the near future perhaps) I guess im every inch of an average Pinoy in terms of passport appreciation. I value passport because without it, i can never leave Pinas. Without this passport, it will be difficult for me to realize my dream of becoming rich. I know I will never get financial security from my meager salary if i stay here in our country. Not from teaching college in a state U anyway. Aside from money, another reason why i want to leave is for my family. All i really want now is for me and my mom to be with my sister, and dad. Until now, (years after things fell apart for our family) there is still that child in me who believes that we can be reunited and that we will live happily ever after. :(   My childish illusions notwithstanding, I still have a strong feeling that my destiny and my family's destiny, doesnt belong here in Pinas.

YOU will be my inspiration for the rest of my stay in the University.

       Just Got Lucky   It was one lucky day.   Who would've thought that a day which started so lamely would end almost perfectly.  I saw my two crushes today and both smiled at me. I even jokingly told the older of the two, how good-looking he is. However, I could only muster a forced smile for my younger crush. Age does matter.  We finished sending the modules for the manual.It was the culmination of one semester worth of effort. Our 72.1 group can finally relax.   I talked to my beloved thesis adviser, Sir Val, today and a miracle happened. He gave me hope and the drive i need to do the project and perhaps, thesis this sem. Unlike my two former advisers, he does not impose on me. Rather, he encourages. He is truly a blessing.   A quick merienda with two of my friends, Alvin and Jacque, turned out to be a 5-hour dinner date. We didn't mind the money we had to shell out for Don Henrico's pasta and pizza. It was so much fun just to eat, sit, talk and laugh and relax.   I still couldn't believe how things can turn from bad to good in one day. A sense of direction is slowly unfolding right before my eyes.   There is indeed a God.

Ive had a gloomy week and today is no exception. im feeling highly emotional and this old R.E.M. song keeps playing on my mind. ive wasted so much time doing nothing yet i want to change the direction of my life. i want to break the cycle. for once in my life, i realize that i better be doing something i enjoy and am passionate about. otherwise, everyday will feel like hell. looking into the future frustrates me a lot.   i cant be like this forever. this has to stop. i have to set my goals straight. i will have to LIVE my life.

       Blog!   Yehey!i have a new look for my blog!ive been making improvements since last week.what prompted me to change the old look was blogspot's new templates.the lack of a purple template among them however led me to the obvious choice of a girly pink template.*laughs* aside from the overall look and the profile section provided by the blog host, ive also added some blog "tricks" which were inspired by all the blogs i visit. if you look at the upper right side of the page, there is a line which will tell you that "_ sneaky person is looking at my blog". I think this is a cool feature since online counters do not inform you the exact number of independent viewers you have. Im actually thinking that there's going to be a time it will display more than 1 person who's got nothing better to do but read my entries.until i decide to make my blog "public",the online tracker is just for blog aesthetics andtechnicalities.Other smart features i added were modifications on the comment field. it has a wendy testaburger image which i got from my peyups avatar, and aside from that, ive also customized it to filipino. Looking at the sidebar part of the blog, i maintained the contents of the old blog. If i still have time, i'll be adding more eye candies, more tricks and trinkets to the page. Im planning on adding other stuffs like dvd links/images,mood indicator,horoscope reader and some other weird but baduy things i enjoy. The list of things i want done for my blog is endless and my creative juices are abundant. Unfortunately,even if i wanted to devote whatever vacation time i have left for my blog, i could not.I have more important things to consider before classes begin. *covers face* Did you know that nightmare begins on june 7?

       Puff the magic Gudang Garam Surya Filter 12   This blog is brought to us by my all-time favorite cigarette brand, Gudang Garam. *puff*    I have always been constipated. Blame it on genes, on my being a premature baby, even on my early exposure to suppositories, but constipation has been a very loyal companion. It is something im not exactly worried about however, when others hear about my condition, their reactions alone would make me want to see a doctor right away.    "Ilang beses ka ba jumebs sa isang linggo?"  they usually ask me. My usual reply is  "Madami na ang 3 o 4 na beses."    If there's a tournament for being the lousiest "shitter", id probably be a good candidate. Without exaggeration, one week plus is the longest time i was not able to defecate. (I just love this term by the way, makes something gross sound so technical)  Ive tried several tricks to remedy the situation. During 1st year in college, my Yoga class taught me a position or stance that will induce excretion. You'll have to stand tip-toed with your arms crossed above your head. You should also drink a glass or two of water before attemting this Yoga position. It worked a couple of times but the magic soon vanished as soon as the semester ended.  Next attempt of mine had me swallowing different stuffs. The first ones were Chinese pills that came in a chinchansu-ish orange container. This was one of the successful laxatives i ever had. Just a few minutes after taking 2 pills, theres no way to go but the toilet. These pills are pricey and scarce though. I also tried the famous Gano coffee which actually tasted good and worked fine initially just like the rest. From the "success" commercial, I then discovered the wonders of Fibrosin followed by Dulcolax.Sometimes they worked but most of the time, its really my mind and my paranoia about being blood-poisoned, getting hemorrhoids or having a vein pop out due to pressure, that induces the whole "shitting" process.  This brings me now to my favorite cigarette, Gudang garam. Ive always convinced my mind two things about smoking cigarettes, this brand in particular. One is that it is bad for my health and those around me and has a high probability of killing me eventually. The second thing im sure of is that cigarette smoking induces my defecation. Lets just say that this tehory holds true 7 out of 10 times. I dont have medical facts to support my theory but if it works for me, then who am i to complain?  Unfortunately, tonight belongs to the 3 out 10 chances of failure for my theory. I have savored the taste of one precious stick of Gudang and yet there was no effect. I didnt feel my arse contract in anticipation of the bowl. No funny feeling in my stomach. Nothing. Zilch. Nada.   Is this my cue to find my next anti-constipation trick? I hope its not something edible again. Most fibrous foods dont taste good. Especially papaya. I heard papaya really works. Maybe it does because it tastes like something you want out of your system ASAP. Papaya is absolutely out of the question. A big YUCK. I hope they transform all papayas into soaps instead. The possibility of me eating a papaya soap is way higher than eating the papaya as it is.  In the meantime, i hope to bring back the power of Gudang. Excruciating as the whole process of pseudo-arse ripping defecation is, i need it badly. and i definitely miss flushing.

      i just want to share this article...how timely :P   "IF PLATONIC AIN'T COOL, THEN WHAT IS?"  by Army Craeg   Matagal mo na siyang kilala...siguro mga isang taon na. Lagi mo siyang kasama, magkakabit na nga ang bituka niyo, eh. Pareho ang trip niyo sa buhay kaya hindi kayo nauubusan ng pag-uusapan o gagawin. You find the same jokes funny. 'Pag turn-off sa iyo, ganun din sa kanya. Super concerned siya sa sa iyo, as in, he knows when you are  not feeling well and what to do when you're down. Alam mo kapag bad trip siya. Takbuhan niyo and isa't isa kapag may problema. Kapag kayong dalawa na ang magkasama, parang may sarili kayong mundo. Kahit tawa lang kayo nang tawa, wala kayong pakialam. Basta ang importante, you have each other's company. You feel so comfortable that holding hands and hugging seems natural. He makes you feel so special and loved that you suddenly have these urges of kissing him. Help! help! help!   Pare, hindi puede! Bakit, kayo ba?   Ouch! Bakit ka namumula? What can I say, you look so  affected! Wala namang akong ginagawa, 'di ba? I just asked the right question. Well, sorry ka na lang magaling ako! Don't panic!!! Relax. Take a deep breath and  say...banana!!! One more time now...banana!!!   Concentrate. Focus. Try to look back. Ano ang nakikita mo? Sino and iniisip mo? SIYA. Syet! You are starting to realize how cool he is. Syeter! You are beginning to miss him. Syetest! You are actually in love with him. Banana!!! What 'dja gonna do, bullet? Duh?! Frankly my dear, I have no idea.   Yes, after making you admit to yourself that you're in a situation that could change your entire life, I will leave you hanging.   Teka, hindi naman ako ganun kasama. Okay, let's see what we can do. First, kailangan nating i-establish that your feelings for him goes beyond friendship. Now the question is...does he feel the same way? How the hell are you going to find out? Aha! Go to him and ask it right to his face. Do you labs me? Grabe, parang puede. Do you have the guts to do it? Do it, girl. I'm right behind you, theoretically speaking. Eniwey, you still have the option of whether you would like to know or not. Think. Think hard.   Look, ano ba ang nagyayari ngayon? Don't you feel that, somehow, you are being used for convenience? Imagine - no commitment,no strings attached. Hindi lang iyon. Super malambing siya sa iyo pero bigla siyang babanat na may crush siyang ibang girl. It hoyts, 'di ba? And, once in a while, hihirit siya sa iyo na parang nagpapahaging that he  likes you, sabay bawi. Kaiiinis! What's worse is that since you feel something deeper for him, sometimes you tend to read too much sa mga ipinapakita niyang affection sa  iyo. Thus, you kinda assume na "meron" din siya. Then you'll end up frustrated but you can't do anything about it. Darn, it sucks!   Kaya, the best thing to do is set things straight. End your miseries and be merry. It would be better na alamin niyo kung ano ba talaga para you wouldn't miss this opportunity and be doomed to live the rest of your life wondering what if, just what if... Who knows, it might be you and him together forever. Kay saya! How ispektakolar!!!   So, if platonic ain't cool, then what is? Well, what do you think?

       ISYU_ISBAK   i woke up this morning with a BIG smile on my face. i was able to chat with  aperture  after so many weeks. :) i really missed my wholesome DVD/techie talks with him. i had a gut feel he would be online last night and he did! Just when i was about to go offline. it was perfect timing indeed and i couldnt have been happier. i was desperately controlling myself and holding back my joy upon seeing a notice on my irc status window that says *aperture is on #up. In my mind though, i was jumping, shouting and doing cartwheels out of excitement and anticipation.   If i may be honest about the whole "reunion" thing, there was a need for me to  see him online. He unknowingly serves the purpose of "rejuvenating" my senses lately. he brings out that "kilig" element constantly reminding me that there is one guy i enjoy hanging out with (albeit online). more importantly, his existence makes me believe that im capable of liking "normal" guys. i needed him to be there to remind me that i shouldnt focus so much on -----. when aperture in on irc, the "-----" issue takes a backseat willingly.   It has been 2 weeks since i started contemplating about the whole ----- issue. it started days before my birthday week. it all began with the NIP renewal issue going out of hand. Rumors have circulated about who's in and out of the faculty roster by next sem. unfortunately, he will most probably not make it to the "in" list. and the mere thought of him leaving the institute freaks me. Im confused why it does. is it because it pains me to "lose" a friend or is it because it hurts to see someone i need leave? i have no idea which is which. ive never been as confused as this.   it all boils down to one thing. do i really like him more than a friend? i was never able to confirm my feelings. Ive been struggling with my emotions for almost two years. I never expected that ill have to face the issue once and for all. Ive succeeded in dismissing the issue by accepting the idea that he is gay. like it would erase all the uncertainties that i have. Its the easy way out. Its like an automatic If-Then situation. If he is indeed gay, then it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to like him. but that aint the issue right? assuming that he is homosexual (i suspect that he is a BIsexual ), does that solve my dilemma? it doesnt. It only brings me to the original issue. What does he mean to me? Beats me.  Thus the dilemma. given the situation now, with the possibility of him transferring to another school,  (A.) would i opt to do something bold and tell him? (B.) should i let him know?  (C.) should i just dismiss the whole thing?  the biggest question after making a choice is this:  Would it matter to him?   its difficult to conclude this post because i still dont have the answers. i havent made up my mind. for all we know, i could just erase this issue from my memory as soon as some other distraction appears. i'll just have to take things in stride.whatever will be,will be. all im hoping for is for everyone to be happy in the end which i dont think is too much to ask.

       Zyrus James   urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink    Contrary to the impression that im all messed up this weekend because of work-related matters, i actually had my share of fun last saturday. I attended the baptismal ceremony for our neighbor's son as one of his godparents(after much prodding by my stage mom). I am second to the youngest among the batch. The youngest being Benjan, the son of another neighbor, Tita Lorna. Funny thing is that I still couldn't get myself to say "kumpareng Benjan" or even "kumareng Fe" or "kumpareng Bong" to Zyrus's parents. It seems like a BIG joke and im the only person laughing.  Honestly, the whole experience seemed surreal and i felt like a little girl trapped in a woman's body. The event forced me in a way to act and think like an adult. It dawned on me that it is just about time for me to let go of my childish ways. This event being my debut. Sooner or later, im sure i'll have my share of invites to other baptisms, or even weddings. Signs that I'm headed towards greater responsibilities in life. So welcome me, adulthood!   And to my first ever  inaanak   Zyrus , Welcome to God's world!   P.S. i hope he likes the apple-green potty trainer i gave him for a present.

        A Teacher's Worst Nightmare  urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     Figure 1. Bag of Horror.   A bagful of test papers,reports,homework  waiting to be checked and recorded.    Ive finished checking and recording 1/3 of the pile and my fingers are already protesting. My red pen has also ran out of ink. I dont think i can finish everything by tomorrow evening as i should. Its highly probable that I'll go insane first before this task gets done.   Its barely 3 weeks since school started and yet i'm VERY exhausted. There's no exaggeration at all. Its been "all work-no play" for me and I havent seen most of my friends in a long time.   And that is just the tip of the iceberg.   The major issue that I have about school/work is that i've been "demoted" from TA to Instructor I. It wasn't about my teaching performance or anything personal. I wasn't singled out in this process, all TAs in fact were demoted!!! Blame UP funding and all the corruption for that!   The truth is, I wasn't even getting a decent salary to begin with.and UP still had the nerve of re-assigning us as Instructors with significantly lesser compensations. I even lost my (precious) book allowance! (FYI, Instructors pay taxes as opposed to TAs who don't since they are considered working "scholars" of the University)  A heavier work load for a lesser pay this semester? Just when I (my family actually) am in dire need of money. Wish me luck. I'll need it BIG time.

Napapaano na ba ako? hay grabe. di ako makatulog (uli). nagising ako ng mga 1:30 am tapos ayun di na ako makatulog. buti na lang talaga at wala akong umagang klase pag Lunes, Martes at Miyerkules.:( masama pala ang epekto ng sked ko. biruin mo, 2 araw lang talaga ako nagtatrabaho sa isang linggo. yung "weekend" ko, extended hanggang miyerkules ng hapon. ang dami ko pedeng magawa sa dami ng bakanteng oras ko pero ang nangyayari, mas marami akong hindi nagagawa sa mga kailangan ko gawin. ang labo talaga. hay.   naiinis pa ako kasi sa dami ng oras ko, mas marami akong naiisip na pagsayangan ng oras. tulad ng pagsasayang ng oras sa net kakaisip kung saan ako makakabili ng murang manual na SLR. o kaka-stalk sa mga blogs at pic galleries ng ibang tao. o pagbababad sa net kasi gusto ko makakuha ng bargain R1 dvds (na orig syempre). o kaya itong pag-blog ko at pag-"park" sa irc. halos araw-araw ganito. shet. ang dami ko pang puwedeng isipin (thesis, lesson plan for the week, bills, etc etc.)pero baket kaya nagpapadistract ako sa mga bagay na kung tutuusin walang kwenta?   at nga pala, pramis ko sa sarili ko kanina bago ako nag-decide na mag-online, sabi ko sandali lang ako dito. gusto ko lang talaga magblog. pero sa dami na nang nasabi ko, muntik ko pa makalimutan kung ano yung isang bagay na gusto ko isulat. Yun yung realization na taon na pala ang lumipas nung huli akong nagpaka-"tao"/nagpaka-"tanga". Yun bang umikot ang mundo mo sa isang tao sa ayaw at sa gusto mo. Yung gigising ka sa umaga na may malaking ngiting naka-plaster sa mukha mo kala mo nanalo ka ng lotto at matutulog namang kilig na kilig na parang kinikiliti sa may kuwan. Yung mga pagkakataon na bawat gawin mo sa buhay mo biglang nagkaroon ng kahulugan dahil masaya ka. Yung nanabik ka matapos ang araw mo kasi gusto mo ibahagi ang mga kwento ng araw mo sa KANYA.   Nakakapikon pero di ko na maalala kung saan banda sa quiapo ko nabili ang ganitong mga karanasan. Hindi ko na rin maisip kung pinilit ko bang mangyari ang mga bagay na iyon dati o sadyang dumating na lang sa buhay ko. tangna talaga. nakalimutan ko na kung ano ang pakiramdam ng may emosyon. nakakatakot kasi di ako sigurado kung mararanasan ko pa uli ang mga iyon o mananatili na akong "bato" hanggang lagutan ako ng hininga.  insert a big sigh here  Ang pagkakamali ko, ilang araw bago ako magkaganito, nanood ako ng isang pelikulang may "depressing theme", ang   In the Mood for Love  . ang kwento ng pelikula ay nakapaloob sa mga linyang ito.. -----   It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered, to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away.  That era has passed. Nothing that belonged to it exists any more.  He remembers those vanished years. As though looking through a dusty window pane, the past is something he could see, but not touch. And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct.   -----  sisihin ba? malay ko ba na ma-involve ako mashado sa characterization kina maggie cheung at tony leung at ma-titrigger ang mga kawindangan ko. gusto ko tuloy murahin si Wong Kar Wai. Pero syempre ginagamit ko lang scapegoat ang pelikula niya. marami pang ibang rason kung baket talaga ako sobrang lungkot/baliw/praning/empty ngayon.:(

          urlLink ">Homer 'icon of a modern dad'   It's enough to make Marge Simpson wince.  A British psychologist has singled out doughnut-driven, cartoon dad Homer Simpson of The Simpsons as an icon of modern-day fatherhood.Charlie Lewis, a Lancaster University psychology professor, donned his Homer tie and made the pronouncement at Britain's first national conference on fatherhood. And his phone hasn't stopped ringing since. "Homer is not just the drunken slob he appears to be. He's expressing contemporary angst," Lewis, a professor of family and development psychology, said yesterday. Lewis pointed to an episode in which Homer seeks out fellow television dad Bill Cosby as evidence that Homer is actively seeking to become a better father.  Lewis's original remarks were made off the cuff after his conference speech "Making effective fathers," but he stands by his theory. Sure, Homer forgets birthdays, eats with his mouth open and is renowned mostly for his dim wit. But Lewis said many fathers could learn from Homer's fondness for watching TV with his children, to whom he's utterly devoted. And he noted Homer often chauffeurs the family around town. Lewis said he often plays several minutes of The Simpsons as part of his psychology courses, but isn't planning an imminent research project on his attention-getting theory.  -----------------------   Homerisms, D'oh!  1. "I think Mr. Smithers picked me for my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work twice as hard when I'm around!" 2. "If you really want something in this life, you have to work for it. Now, quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers!" 3. "All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one." 4. ""Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirt.I'm not popular enough to be different." 5. "I am so smart, I am so smart, S M R T, I mean S M A R T."   To my dad, William "Bogs" Manuel, to my fave TV dad, Homer Simpson, and all the cool and hilarious dads in the world,    (belated) Happy father's day!

       Ambigrams   Def'n: An  ambigram  is a word or a group of words which can be read in at least two different ways. The most usual are symmetric under a rotation of 180 degrees (i.e., they look the same upside down) or under a vertical axis reflection (i.e., they look the same in a mirror). The term "ambigram" was coined by Douglas Hofstadter and some of his friends.  some examples of ambigrams are the following:   Rotational  - These words read the same when inverted or (rotated 180 degrees).    Bilateral or mirror image  - These words read the same when viewed from behind (if printed on a transparent surface) or seen in a mirror.     Chain (Rotational) - These ambigrams cannot exist as one word alone, but depend on being linked to infinite repetitions of the word. They are created by dividing the word into different parts and designing each part as a rotation. They are best displayed in a circle or a spiral configuration.     (text and images obtained from http://www.johnlangdon.net)  --------------------- so why the fascination about ambigrams? im currently reading Angels and Demons by Dan Brown and a major part of the story involves a secret brotherhood, the Illuminati.  The emblem of this group is a legendary ambigram. I find it rather amusing that some people go through the tedious process of creating highly symmetric symbols just for kicks. Those people are crazy! I tried to create an ambigram myself and it took me the longest time to produce something legible. here is what my first desperate attempt looks like (drumroll please):    here's another attempt (3 days after):   Did you actually see my name? hehe. i know that my works look amateurish compared to the previous images i have posted. BUT, i think im slowly getting the hang of it. I just need more practice. I tried doing my surname as well and there's progress right after a few trials (despite a terrible migraine). So call me masochistic, geek or whatever but i really enjoy this new hobby.:p -------------------------  P.S.  pahinga muna from blogging and chatting. I still have to settle my account with tri-isys. They froze my account. Gagu sila. So much for customer loyalty. Tsk.  Para sa mga nawiwindang sa lovelife now.. here's a quote which i got online:   “that love drug, it's heavy sh*t. It takes you higher and drags you lower than anything else. And when you're comin' down off that baby, you gotta pump yourself full of all kind of other pharmaceuticals just to survive.” true ba? di ako makarelate eh.

       Da Vinci Decoded      "So many twists - all satisfying, most unexpected...Let's just say that if this novel doesn't get your pulse racing, you need to check your meds..This is good fun--Umberto Eco on steroids." - San Francisco Chronicle    Now i understand the reason behind Mona Lisa's smile and why Dan Brown's book was such a hit. Everybody loves conspiracies. It was a work of fiction like no other. Ive heard so many raves about this book since last year but i never really bothered to find out what the hype was all about. Almost everyone i know has read the book, has recently owned a copy or in the process of finishing the book. Even my sister who's not much into reading has a hardbound copy. I surmised it is not an overrated work of literature after all. I wanted a copy of my own but i dont have the extra cash to buy one. Luckily, one of my colleagues in the faculty, Valynn, volunteered to lend me her copy. And barely a day after that, i finished reading the Da Vinci Code (DVC). The moment Valynn handed me the copy, i couldnt get my eyes and hands off the book. It has one of the most engaging and intriguing plots ive ever encountered. I usually get bored at the start of any book but DVC definitely captured my undivided attention right from the very first page. The author has cleverly intertwined history, arts, religion, cryptology and symbology into one fascinating story. It is both informative and entertaining. It tackles the endless search for the Holy Grail,the conflicts arising from these pursuits, the unraveling of "secrets" of Jesus Christ's mortal life, and the persistent efforts of the Catholic church in shielding its believers from the "truth". This book challenges not only one's intelligence but more so, one's faith. A truly satisfying piece of work which i intend to buy soon.:)   ---------------------------  On a lighter note, a movie adaptation of the Da Vinci Code is slated to come out sometime in 2005. Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, EdTV, Apollo 13) is to direct the movie and actors who may star include Tom Hanks, George Clooney, and Russell Crowe and probably Kate Beckinsale. Yipee! Good news for me indeed.

       Tangnang Sebentiwan  Oo. Tangna talaga ang 71. Leche. Ngayon pa lang, ayoko na sa 71 course group. Pinapahirap nila ang buhay ko. Wala pang isang linggo ang klase pero panay sakit na ng ulo ang binigay sa akin nitong 71 na ito. Para naman kasing pinilit ko mapunta sa course group na yan. Shet. FYI, pinilit lang ako para pumunta sa kanila. Anyway, share ko lang kung baket ako pikon na pikon dahil sa 71. Nagsabay-sabay ata ang kalechehan kahapon e. Una, nabuwiset ako kasi di ko nameet ang deadline ng "solutions to suggested problems". Pramis pinilit ko naman gawin yan nung isang gabi, bad trip lang kasi feeling ko kulang sa oras. At di ko rin gaanong magets kung baket kelangang madaliin ang pagsubmit ng solutions. Hindi ko na nga kinukwestiyon kung baket kelangan ko mag-solve e. Hindi naman yun dapat parte ng trabaho ng recit teacher. Pero, nagsorry naman ako kay wilma kasi di ko nga natapos. Pero faeck,lalo pa ata napikon. Duh. Ikaw na nga nagpapakumbaba e. Hay.Kakapikon. Yung pangalawang mitsa ay ang pagsabi niya na may recit pala sa Biyernes. So sino ngayon ang hindi marunong tumupad sa usapan? Sabi nila, next week pa ang start ng recit. Tsk. Di ko na irereklamo na sa akin ipapahandle ang mga arki sa klase niya. Talagang itambak ba sa R2 lahat e. Grrr. Ang huling nagpainit ng ulo ko ay ang text ni shiela kanina lang. 1 am yun dumating. Tinatanong niya ako kung puwede daw ba akong gumawa ng recit quiz. Di ko na sinagot. Pero mukhang wala naman ata akong choice. Baket parang ang lakas magpowertrip nitong mga taga71 na ito? Nung lecturer naman ako di ko inaabuso ang kabaitan ng mga recit teachers ko. Kung alam ko lang ganito ang mangyayari, sana naglecture na lang ako sa 72 cguro nagenjoy pa ako. Kapag minamalas ka nga naman oo.. Wala na talagang puwede ikatuwa sa NIP. Fakshet.

       First Day of Classes    Rains wash out school opening  Posted:2:28 AM (Manila Time) | Jun. 08, 2004  Inquirer News Service    ON THE first day of school Monday, classes in the elementary level were suspended in Central Luzon, Northern Luzon and the National Capital Region, including Metro Manila, due to strong rains and winds spawned by Tropical Storm "Frank."  Storm Signal No. 3 was hoisted in Ilocos Norte as Frank (international name: Conson) gathered strength Sunday night and remained a threat to the northern provinces.   Rosalinda Luna, division superintendent of the Department of Education in Pampanga, said this was the first time that a storm had disrupted school opening in the province, where almost 400,000 elementary and high school students were expected this year.   --------------------- Life is unfair for adults. While gradeschoolers all around the Metro celebrate the suspension of classes, the rest of the school-going public have to deal with the reality of being back to school.   I was stuck all day in school. I waited for CHED to declare a suspension sometime during the day but the weather did not cooperate. Aside from ocassional drizzles, the day was just fine. If its any consolation, it was a wonderful day for rainy-day-apparel-addicts like me, at least.   I didn't even care to eat lunch. It saved me the money and the sorrow of eating without my friends. My day picked up right after lunchtime when people-i-want-to-see arrived in school one after the other. The first genuine smile came when Carlos visited me in the faculty room. The next one came when Alvin arrived. Everything seemed to fall in their right places afterwards :D  I still won't have(teaching)classes until thursday. Im excited to meet my new "victims". I guess nothing's final yet since im still short of one unit of teaching load. Likewise, I still have to finalize my masteral load and complete my registration.   I bet this is going to be a long week for me. Make that one loooong sem. *sigh*

       Ayaw Paawat    Ilang oras na makalipas ng huli kong post, eto pa rin ako at online. wow grabe, ano ba point ko? Hmm, gusto ko lang ata talagang lubusin ang natitirang oras ng bakasyon ko up to the last minute.Sa totoo lang, la naman na akong reklamo sa opening ng classes. Excited na nga ako kasi may mga bago na namang estudyante. Syempz, panibagong pakikisama, panibagong karanasan.   Panibagong prospects.   Yipee!! Pero di pa talaga ako tinatamaan ng antok. Kanina pa ako dito online at napakarami ko na ngang naisip na bagay sa halos anim na oras ko dito sa net.  Sheesh. Anim na oras na pala!!!  Dami ko na nga nadownload, nabasa, nakausap sa irc, at dami ko na natutunan sa loob ng anim na oras. Baket kaya pag ganitong madaling-araw, overflowing ang ideas ko? Sakit na ba ito? Patay ang utak ko pag umaga tapos pag hatinggabi hanggang madaling araw, para siyang factory ng mga ideya.  Matino man o bastos.   Ang dami ko tuloy biglang gusto gawin. Ang daming inspirations na napulot sa internet. Sabihin ko nga sa nanay ko na hindi naman pala ganap na kasayangan itong pagbababad ko online. Imagine, 6 hrs lang pero narealize ko na gusto ko talagang matuto sa photography. Nakakainspire ang mga galleries na binisita ko gaya  urlLink ">nito . Mukhang hindi naman ganun kahirap magcapture ng imahe. Feeling ko para lang ikaw nag-frame ng isang scene. Ang problema ko nga lang kelangan ko ng magandang equipment. Kaso wala naman ako pambili e. SLR donations anyone?  Isa pang naisip ko na gusto ko gawin, gusto ko ata talagang pagkakitaan yung balikbayan box business na pinopropose ko sa ate ko. Mukang madali naman magtake ng risk sa ganung negosyo kasi may market naman eh. Well, excited na rin ako kasi sabi ni ate, malapit na niya ipadala ang mga boy shorts ko.  Boy shorts kuno pero astig na panty lang naman yun.   That means, may mabebenta na ako sa aking mga gfs. Ayos. Sana kumita kami ni ate if ever. Gusto ko rin sana magexpand later on sa mga books at sa dvds at sa anu-anong anik-anik. At syempre, pag seryosohan na, hanapin ko yung suggestion ng chatmate kong si aperture na iconsider ang Johnny Air for shipping. Wow! Kelangan ko ata gumawa ng matinong business proposal sa sis ko para paniwalaan ako. (spotsky crosses fingers) Ano pa ba ang naisip kong mahalaga sa lumipas na 6 na oras? Amm, narealize ko na lumalamig na naman ang panahon. Tag-ulan e.Tapos syempre ang epekto nito,  nagiging hayok ang mga tao   at senti mode na naman kahit di ko gusto. Hindi ko na lang papangalanan pero kung ano mang ilusyon ang meron ako para sa taong yon, mukang malabo talaga. Hanggang dun na lang talaga. Nanatili siyang detached sa akin e. Hindi na kami umalis sa getting-to-know stage. Hopeless. Oh well, kakantahan ko na lang siya ng "More than this" next time. Sabi nga dun sa  urlLink blog  na nabasa ko,   "if in every relationship there is one that loves more than the other, i want to be the other. its safer that way"    Amen.    --------------    P.S.  kanina pa paulit-ulit ang 2 kantang ito sa Musicmatch player ko:  Balisong ng Rivermaya Talk Shows on Mute ng Incubus  Di ko lam kung may connection ang 2 ito sa state of mind ko.

       Semi-Hypochondria   I think there is something seriously wrong with my body. Ive been worrying about my health a lot because i have been bombarded with various concerns recently.   At the top of my list is my excessive hair loss. I wake up each day with several strands of hair on my pillows and bed. Whenever i shampoo my hair, id see more strands on my hands after massaging my scalp gently and the bathtub drain gets clogged with hair. These scenes have taken their toll on my panic threshold. Ive been considering my friends' suggestions that I go see a doctor and find out for real if this is a serious medical condition or not.   Another thing ive noticed in my body is my face skin.It looks unusually pale and fair. It doesnt match my body color and it bothers me a lot because i grew up with a medium to dark skin tone and here i am now, fairer than my sis or any of my friends. I am suspecting that there is an abnormality in my pigmentation. Of course, there is no medical evidence that would support my suspicions.  I also have a weird theory about my reproductive system. I remember writing this on my Obituary project during freshman year in college. Back then, I said that I would die at the age of 34 due to ovarian or cervical cancer.The idea was probably obtained subconsciously due to my monthly bouts with dysmenorrhea.I have always had problems with my mens. Its always been irregular and painful. I read somewhere that whenever there is painful menstruation, chances are that there is a growth down there.   Another concern of mine are cysts on my chest. Three to four years ago, a cyst on the region between my breasts was removed by Dr. Carpena at St.Lukes. As anyone knows, cysts recur and i have this fear that they're silently growing somewhere inside me and plotting a big comeback. I worry that cysts have taken over my breasts in particular since I usually feel a piercing pain on my right breast.  Of course, there's also my (benign paroxysmal positional) vertigo which is not much a source of anxiety unless i subject myself to abrubt change in positions which would induce it. My ear problem is also another issue which i have learned to live by. It was brought to my attention however that serious ear infection can lead to more serious problems like Bell's Palsy because it could lead to paralysis of one of the facial nerves.  I can go on and on listing all the medical issues i have and i can easily imagine how i can die or suffer from each of them. That makes me a semi-hypochondriac. I'm not sure if there is such a term. The results of the  urlLink  Self-Test for Hypochondria  indicate that I almost had a "perfect" score which qualifies me as a person with high levels of health anxieties, thus a probable hypochondriac.   However, the strict definition by Ingvard Wilhelmsen, MD,Ph.D says that:   A person with hypochondria is preoccupied with physical health and body. The diagnosis is used when a person during at least 6 months believes, fears or is convinced that he has a serious disease despite medical reassurance.This fear of disease or preoccupation with symptoms is unpleasant, interferes with the patient's daily life in a negative way and leads to medical examinations and/or treatment. The patient can only temporarily accept assurance that there is no physical explanation to his symptoms.     The above definition therefore requires some level of defiance or disagreement to medical reassurance which i dont have since I never seeked doctors' opinions despite the symptoms. Any disease is equivalent to helplessness and defeat and I never liked the idea of being conquered by something beyond my control. Thats why i hate seeing doctors because they're messengers of bad news, killjoys.   I'll just hope that everything about my body will turn out alright soon. I don't want to be forced to go to the hospital again for two reasons. One is that hospital bills are ALWAYS expensive and second, hospital means intrusive doctors probing my body.

       Huwaat???Tapos na bakasyon?   Isang malaking bangungot ito. June 1 na pala.Baket parang wala mashadong nangyari sa bakasyon ko? Pinili ko na ngang huwag magturo nung summer kasi gusto ko (a)magpahinga (b)magenjoy ng bakasyon (c)makarecover sa bad lecture experience ko last sem (d)mag-aral magdrive at (e)mag-isip kung paano ako gagraduate sa MS ko. Pag iniisip ko ngayon kung may nagawa ba ako sa limang sinabi ko,parang wala pang 10% ang natapos ko. Pahinga ba kamo? Kakaiba ang bakasyon ko kasi halos pumupunta rin naman ako sa skul linggo-linggo dahil sa mga meetings.Tapos, nung simula ng May,napirmi naman ako sa bahay kasi nagbaksyon si Marge sa Sorsogon.Ang naging labas tuloy, taong-bahay ako.Ilang linggo din akong nakipag-mabutihang loob sa mga kawali, plato, baso, kutsara't tinidor at kay Joy dishwashing paste.Natuto na rin ako magwalis at mag-mop ng kwarto ko araw araw. Natuto na rin ako maglaba at mamlansta kahit damit ko lang. Natuto rin ako mag-ihaw at mag-luto ng sarili kong pagkain. Ang Hatol: nadomesticate pala ako nitong bakasyon kaya di gaano nakapahinga.  Kung sa pagenjoy naman ng bakasyon, ayos lang naman. Nagkaroon ng 2 major parties ang barkada kasi una, birthday ko nung April tapos matapos ang 2 linggo, si Alvin naman ang nagdiwang ng birthday.Meron din naman mga ilang "minor gimiks" kung saan saan. Ito ata ang masayang phase ng bakasyon ko. Gumagala ako kung saan-saan. Yun nga lang, nauubos ang pera ko. May isang insidente pa nga na naka 4k ata ako sa gastos sa mall. Ngeerk. Buti na lang may sweldo pa ako hanggang end ng May. Whew! Tapos,nung weekend lang, nagdecide kami na maghuling hirit sa bakasyon kaya nagpunta kami sa Baguio.(Ireserba ko na lang sa ibang post ang Baguio pics at story)Ang Hatol: Naenjoy ko naman ang bakasyon sa abot ng aking makakaya at sa abot ng aking bulsa.   Sa aspeto ng recovery sa lecture experience, ok na ako. Tanggap ko nang hindi ako marunong magturo at nagkalat ako last sem. Kakahiya nga pero wala akong paki. Sana lang wag na maulit (kahit nanganganib ata akong magturo uli ng lec sa susunod na sem) at medyo may ideya naman na ako kung san ako sumobra at nagkulang.Ang Hatol: Kinakabahan na naman ako kasi maglelecture na naman ata ako.  Yung sa MS, mejo naayos ko na nga ata ang direksyon eh. Binigyan na nga ako ng himala ng Diyos para maka-bangon at makipagbati kay Sir Wilson. Sana nga lang tuloy-tuloy na kasi kelangan ko nang grumadweyt ASAP.Pero malaking kapanatagan ng loob pa rin na di na ako mababaliw sa pagiisip kung paano ako "babalik" sa lab. Ang Hatol: Mejo matino ang kinahinatnan nitong issue na ito. Yung sa driving naman, nagkataon na di talaga ako nakahawak ng manubela kahit minsan ngayong bakasyon. Una dahil si kuya Joey ay umuwi ng Baguio at halos isang buwan siya andun. Ang Hatol: bahala na si batman. Siguro di talaga ako isinilang para mag-drive.Wahehehe. Hmm, bukod sa mga nasabi ko, di ko na talaga maisip baket parang ang bilis ng bakasyon. Nawala na lang siya unti-unti.Siguro kung di pa ako nakalabas ng Maynila kamakailan, lalo akong magwawala. Baket lagi na lang bitin ang bakasyon!!!??? Nakakabaliw isipin pero pasukan na naman talaga. Isang sem na naman itong aantayin ko matapos.

O siguro fan lang talaga ako ng angkan ng mga Marcos kaya bentang-benta&nbsp;sa akin&nbsp;at di ako napikon sa mga pinakita sa pelikula. Pinanood ko nga pala ito nung Lunes kasama ang nanay ko. Sayang nga lang at di namin naisama ang lola ko na numero unong fan ni Imelda. Kaya nga siguro ako aliw na aliw sa mga&nbsp;Marcos ay dahil sa lolo't lola ko na mga loyalista. Sangkatutak ang mga litrato, libro, mga memorabilia na nagkalat sa paligid ko noong ako'y lumalaki pa lamang.   Nakakamangha&nbsp;talaga yung kagandahan ni Imelda kahit na matanda na siya. Pansin na pansin ang pagiging banidosa niya at maselan niya hanggang ngayon. Ang gagarbo pa rin ng suot na damit at naka-french tip pa ang lola mo with matching red na nail polish na base. Astig! kung lahat ba naman ng matatanda sa mundo ay marunong mag-alaga sa sarili ng tulad ni Imelda eh di sana...sabagay, hindi naman lahat ng tao ay sing kurakot at sing yaman niya.  Maraming nakakaaliw na aspeto ang pelikula sa kabila ng pagiging dokumentaryo nito. Nariyan ang pakantahin si Imelda,&nbsp;ang pamimigay ng litrato niya sa mga street children, ang pagre-touch ng make-up at paghingi ng Kleenex habang iniinterview, ang pagdrowing ng kung ano anong kabalbalan para i-explain ang kaniyang mga "pilosopiya" sa buhay at marami pang iba. Sa kalagitnaan ng pelikula&nbsp;napaisip tuloy ako&nbsp;kung may sayad ba itong babaeng ito o wala dahil ang lakas ng amats niya. Napaka-out of this world ng mga ideya at pinagsasabi niya, sa totoo lang.  Meron isang insidente kung saan pinagtangkaan siyang patayin habang nagbibigay ng speech. Nakuha yun sa video at nakakasindak dahil hawak nung assasin niya ay isang bolo. At ano ang reaksyon ni Imelda sa lahat ng naganap? Bukod sa&nbsp;naisip niyang magpa-plastic surgery dahil sa 11 na hiwang natamo, naisip din niya na hindi siya karapat-dapat mamatay sa pamamagitan ng isang napakapanget na jungle bolo. Sana man lang daw, ay tinalian ng yellow ribbon para man lang maging maayos. Panalo talaga!  Isa pang eksena sa pelikulang tumatak sa utak ko ay nung pinapanood niya sa kaniyang projection TV&nbsp;ang kaniyang mga anak na si Bongbong at Imee bilang panauhin sa isang talk show.&nbsp;Halatang&nbsp;proud na proud si Imelda sa mga naabot ng kaniyang mga anak sa larangan ng pulitika. At&nbsp;bukod pa rito, nung babanggitin na nila Imee at Bongbong kung gaano "kagaling" na pulitiko ang kanilang ina, pinalakasan niya pa ang volume para maemphasize ang mga sinasabi nila.  Hindi talaga sapat ang kuwento para mabigyan ng hustisya ang entertainment value ng pelikulang ito. Mas lalo nitong pinakulay ang makulay ng buhay at pagkatao ni Imelda sa saking isipan. Sa isang banda'y hahangaan mo ang katalinuhan, karangyaan at kagandahan niya ngunit sa&nbsp;kabilang banda naman ay maaring siya'y iyong kaawaan o kamuhian dahil wala siyang pag-amin o pinapakitang&nbsp;pagsisi sa mga nagawa nilang kasalanan noon.    "If you know how rich you are, you are not rich. But me, I am not aware of the extent of my wealth. That's how rich we are."  - Imelda Marcos quoted from Phil. Daily Inquirer, 1998  ---------------------  Kahapon, July 27, 2004 ay pumanaw na si Sebia, ang naging kasambahay ng lolo't lola ko sa loob ng maraming taon. Malaki ang utang na loob&nbsp;ng pamilya namin&nbsp;sa kanya dahil naging mabuti siyang tagapag-alaga hindi lang ng mga tito at tita ko kundi pati ng mga anak nila. Naging tapat siyang&nbsp;kasama hanggang sa huli at wala siyang ibang tinuring na pamilya kundi ang sa amin.

        Quarter-life crisis    Eto na nga ata ang krisis na kinakaharap ko sa ngayon. Sa buong buhay ko, ngayon lang ako nafrustrate ng ganito. Kung meron mang peak ang frustration ng tao, ngayon yun para sa akin. Nanonood pa lang ako ng TV kanina kasi kakagising ko lang. Tapos, biglaan na lang, sumagi na naman sa isip ko ang mga bagay na isinasantabi ko. Yun bang pag-evaluate sa naging buhay ko sa lumipas na 2 taon. Reality check kumbaga.   Bigla na lang sumakit ang dibdib ko. At ilang minuto pa ang lumipas, lumuluha na pala ako nang di ko namamalayan. Hindi ko maipaliwanag yung sakit na naramdaman ko kanina e. Hindi ko na maalala kung kailan ako huling umiyak ng ganun. Pero ang alam ko, habang humahagulgol ako, hinihiling ko sa Diyos na bigyan ako ng direksyon.   Direksyon. Yan ang unang kinaka-frustrate ko. Magda-dalawang taon na nung grumaduate ako ng B.S. ko. At magdadalawang taon na rin pala akong nagtatrabaho sa NIP. Subalit kung tutuusin, walang nagbago sa buhay ko mula November 2002. Walang manipestasyon na umasenso ang kabuhayan pati ang kaalaman at pagkatao ko.   Hindi naman sa umasa akong yumaman sa loob ng dalawang taon. Sa totoo lang, kung di lang talaga kapos ang pamilya ko, hindi naman big deal sa akin ang sweldo. Kung gastos ko lang ang pag-uusapan, kaya kong tipirin ang isang libo sa isang buwan. Ang mas malaking issue sa akin ngayon ay ito: Makalipas ng 2 taon, hindi pa rin ako lubusang nakakasiguro na tama ba ang lugar na kinalalagyan ko sa ngayon. Inaamin ko na nakipagsapalaran ako sa pagkuha ng M.S. degree dahil inakala kong wala akong pupuntahan matapos grumaduate ng B.S. Isa pang dahilan ay dahil sa ito ang karaniwang landas na tinahak ng mga ka-batch ko. Yun bang kumuha ng masters habang nagtuturo sa NIP. Pero ngayon napagtanto ko na di naging tama ang desisyon ko.   Halos lahat ng ka-batch ko ay patapos na ng masters ngayong sem. Marahil isa pa ito sa kinakafrustrate ko. Higit sa inggit sa estado nila, mas umaangat yung duda sa isip ko. Pag tinitignan ko sila, para bang siguradong-sigurado sila na ang pagiging "physicist" ang gusto nilang mangyari sa buhay nila. Samantalang ako, ni hindi ko talaga makita ang sarili ko bilang "researcher". Hindi ako kampante dahil alam kong di sapat ang alam ko ngayon (academic man o experimental) para ituring ang sarili na physicist. Sa katunayan, dahil sa mga ganitong realisasyon, ayoko na talagang tapusin ang kurso ko. Hindi ko rin nakikinitang matatapos ko ang thesis ko sa loob ng 1 taon. At kung papalaring matapos ko man ito, ano ang susunod na hakbang?   Ilan lang yan sa mga gumugulo sa isip ko ngayon na di ko masolusyunan. Kung sa tingin ko ay ayaw ko na itong buhay ko ngayon, may pupuntahan nga ba ako? Mas pipiliin ko bang magsimula ng panibagong landas kahit na konting pagsisikap na lang ay kaya ko nang tapusin ang M.S. ko? Mas importante ba sa akin na nare-recognize ang skill ko sa field na pipiliin ko? Kaya ko nga bang talikuran ang buhay sa Physics na "kinagisnan" ko na dahil di lang ako masaya at kuntento? Mababaw lang ba ang pinanggagalingan ng lahat ng mga frustrations kong ito?   Kung kilala mo ang pagkatao ko, at may ideya ka sa mga prinsipyo ko sa buhay kabilang ang mga bagay na tunay na nakakapag-pasaya sa akin, malamang alam mo na ang sagot sa mga tanong ko. Ang balakid nga lang talaga, hindi ko maisip kung paano, kailan at saan ko sisimulan.

        Isang mIRC riddle    May kalokohan akong ginagawa sa mIRC lately.  Hindi siya sex-related pramis.  Ang nakakatawa ay nag-eenjoy ata ako sa ginagawa ko.  Hindi ko inakalang ikatutuwa ko pala iyon. Kagabi nga tawa ako ng tawa mag-isa eh. Pero the joke was on me pala. Nakakaaliw pero nakakahiya pa rin. 'Di ko ito sasabihin kahit kanino. Pero pag pinilit ako aamin din ako haha. Sana lang wag akong pagtawanan.  ---------------------------------------   mga walang koneksyong pahabol:  -Para sa mga walang magawa, panoorin ninyo ang pelikulang  Zatoichi  sa extended run ng Cinemanila o kahit sa dvd lang. Sigurado akong di ninyo pagsisisihan.  -Paano ko ba maaalis ito sa utak ko?   "Kung ikaw ay nalulungkot,  nalulumbay, nabubugnot.... sa paglalabang walang kabuhay-buhay"  Shemats. Na-LSS ako sa jingle ng Surf commercial dahil kay Marge.

         Expecting a lot of Bull this week..     Weekly Overview  07/12/2004 - 07/18/2004   It's Monday and you feel like a million bucks. Literally. Where did all this cash come from? As you proceed into the week, it will occur to you that you're not used to feeling as financially secure as you are these days, and you just might decide to a spring for a new something-or-other. Just make sure it's not, for example, a new house. You're probably not ready for that kind of commitment (financial or otherwise) just yet. Friday and Saturday will return you to the nonmaterial things that make you smile -- namely, your bizarre, hilarious friends.    Taurus Horoscope  For The Week Starting July 12, 2004  Rash action this week can cause problems that you have not taken into consideration. You must be careful with writings, travel, agreements or signing papers. Give a second thought to everything you do. Any parties you attend now can be stuffy or boring to you. Over spending is easy to do now so look for sales and save as much as possible.    This week for Taurus  Venus, your ruler, continues progressing through Gemini; it's rare that you have had a time when there has been so much activity and comings and goings. However, it's not forever but in the meantime take note of the Sun's links with Saturn in your financial sector. Either a job or a position that you have recently taken on could become that more permanent. Make sure it's what you want.

       Let's all pray for Angelo dela Cruz     No official confirmation of De la Cruz's release  Posted: 2:16 AM (Manila Time) | Jul. 11, 2004 INQ7.net with GMA 7  THERE has still been no official confirmation if Filipino hostage Angelo de la Cruz had been released by his Iraqi captors.According to a CNN report broadcast on GMA Network, Dela Cruz has not been turned over to Philippine authorities in Iraq despite jubilation in the truck driver's hometown in Pampanga province after De la Cruz's family claimed they had received a call from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo confirming the release.The CNN reported quoted Philippine diplomats in Baghdad as saying the Filipino hostage was still not in their custody.   Malacañang also could not immediately verify De La Cruz's release, GMA-7 said in a report that accompanied its broadcast of the CNN newscast.    Labor Secretary Patricia Sto. Tomas had confirmed in an earlier GMA Network "Flash Report" that Dela Cruz was released late Saturday and was on his way to an undisclosed hotel in Baghdad.Press Secretary Milton Alingod told GMA-7 radio dzBB in a live interview that the Palace had not received any word from its emissaries confirming Dela Cruz's release or that he had been turned over to them.An earlier GMA-7 "Flash Report" said the Department of Foreign Affairs also could not confirm De la Cruz's release. (Originally updated: 2:08 A.M.)   -----------------------   I've seen this on TV around 20 times today yet each time, i can't help but shed a tear.    I don't know Angelo dela Cruz personally but it is truly heartbreaking for me to see him cry and beg for his life on video. How his family is handling this situation, I could only imagine. It is difficult enough to have family members leave the country to work overseas. Still, even if they have chosen to go, it's not easy having your father or mother, or anyone for that matter, sent into danger. It's scary to think that someone you care about could be harmed, much more killed.  As of this time, the Iraqi terrorists has extended the "deadline" by 24 hours. Of course, there is no way anyone could reason with terrorists but the Filipino in me says that we should give in to their demands. We need to withdraw our contingent in Iraq ASAP. Not only to spare dela Cruz's life but also to prevent something like this from happening again.   I'm hoping against hopes that the government can pull off a miracle for this one. Nobody deserves to die brutally.

       Kwentong MRT    Kahapon pagkatapos ng klase ko ay sinundo ko ang nanay ko sa Ayala dahil may pinuntahan siya sa may Pedro Gil. Nakakawiling pumunta sa Makati na nakasakay sa MRT mula Quezon Avenue papuntang Ayala station. Ang bilis kasi ng biyahe tapos mura pa. Mabuti at di ko sinunod ang katamaran ko at nagtaxi ako mula UP papuntang Pedro Gil. Bukod sa sobrang haba ng traffic, nadiskubre kong 100 pesos lang pala ang laman ng pitaka ko. Ang buong akala ko may 500 pa ako. Yung kotse nga pala namin ay pinarada ng nanay ko sa McDo Quezon Ave kung saan flat rate na 50.00 ang parking fee. Sulit nga kasi naka 12 oras kami kahapon.  Hindi kami gaano nakapaglibot sa Glorietta. Hindi nga ako nakanood ng  Zatoichi  kahit  hidden agenda  ko yun kahapon.Hindi ako makahirit sa nanay ko ng sine dahil una, ayaw nya magbasa ng subtitles, pangalawa, Hapon ang mga nasa pelikulang yun, at pangatlo at pinaka- importanteng dahilan, katapusan ng  Sana'y Wala Ng Wakas  kahapon. Kaya sige, mga alas-7 ay umalis na kami pagkakain. Parang nagpalamig lang ako. Yung bilang ng mga cute na lalakeng nakita ko, ni hindi na nga umabot sa quota eh.  Paguwi namin, sobrang kapal ng tao sa northbound side ng MRT. Mga 4 layers ata ang hanay ng tao na nagaabang ng MRT.Yung nanay ko, pilit pang nakikipagsiksikan. Ngunit matapos dumaan ng 2 MRT na wala pa atang 10 ang nakasakay dahil sa puno ng tao, naisipan naming mag roundtrip na lang. Ganun din naman ang bayad e. Tumawid kami sa kabilang side ng MRT at nag-abang.   Pagdating ng unang MRT, napasakay kami sa pinakahuling  coach .Pagtapak pa lang namin sa MRT, tawa na ng tawa ang tao. Di namin magets ng nanay ko kung baket. Yun pala, inaabangan ata nila ang reaksyon naming mga bagong sakay sa kaganapan sa loob ng MRT. Hagikhikan sila ng hagikhikan sabay nakatakip ang mga ilong. Hmm..nung una, napraning ako. Kala ko ako yung mabaho. Pero ilang sandali lang, naintindihan ko na kung sino ang tinutukoy nila. Yun palang dalawang aprikanong nakatayo sa may dulo.   Nung una, masangsang talaga ang amoy na umaalingasaw sa may banda sa amin. Amoy sibuyas na nabulok tapos parang kumapakapit pa sa balat at damit mo. Yung nanay ko bahong baho din. Nung nagtagal, naging immune na ako sa amoy kahit halos lahat ng katabi namin, nakatakip pa rin ang ilong. Kahit nga nung binuksan na ng 2 lalake ang bintana ng MRT, di pa rin nakatulong. Natapos lang talaga ang  dilemma  nila nang bumaba na ang 2 aprikano sa may Taft. Nakahinga na ang lahat ng maayos pagkatapos. Buti na lang at di naground trip ang 2 iyon kundi baka naubos na ang sakay ng MRT o di kaya ay napamura na lang. Sabi pa nga nila, roundtrip-badtrip daw ang ilang minutong karanasang iyon. OA diba? Di ko mawari kung racist ba sila o ayaw lang talaga sa BO? Malamang pareho.  Nung nakaikot na ng ruta ang MRT, kakaibang problema na naman.Unti unti nang lumiit ang espasyong tinatayuan namin ng nanay ko sa unti-unting pagrami ng tao.Nang napadpad na kami sa may Buendia, giyera na. Halos magkapalit na nga kami ng mukha ng mga katabi ko. Puro lalake pa naman.Buti na lang may isang cute. Hahaha. Kaso nakakahiya kasi kaharap na kaharap namin siya ng nanay ko. Tapos siyempre isa lang yung hinahawakan namin. Kakatuwa lang kasi napakaganda ng kamay nung lalakeng yun kung sino man siya! Mas maputi at makinis pa sa kamay ko. Yung mukha naman niya, di ko masabi kung gwapo o hindi kasi panget naman talaga taste ko sa lalake e. Pero yung dating niya, sabihin na lang nating  enigmatic .   Pasensya na at napahaba na mashado itong kwento ko tungkol sa MRT. Minsan lang ako kasi ako nakaka-commute at nakakakita ng mga ibang lalake bukod sa mga mukang *bleep* na lalake sa NIP.

       Weirdness written all over   I woke up yesterday with the  WEIRD est feeling in me. I just had a very absurd dream about me and a certain guy friend from physics. Just remembering the context of my dream makes me want to hide in shame. And although I am in good terms with that person, I don't think there is or will ever be any mutual attraction between us.   That dreams are the manifestations of our sub-conscious minds' desires is not always true after all.   ------  We watched Cinemanila's feature entry,  Babae sa Breakwater  last night.("We" pertains to me,my mom,kuya Joey,Baby,Rhona,Jaki and Fema.)The movie wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. But judging from the expressions of the people inside the cinema, mostly foreigners,I guess the film succeeded in getting its message across.  WEIRD  as its title may seem, this movie will definitely make you appreciate your blessings in life.    I'm still undecided if I wasted my 100 pesos for this movie or not. But I'm 100% sure that I'll watch Paquita over  Spiderman  on any given day.   ------  I should finish checking 3 sets of data sheets(around 1 inch thick)later today. I find it  WEIRD  that im working when im supposed to be enjoying my rest day(s) as a teacher. Another fact that substantiates my masochostic tendencies.  ------  My DVD-obsessed alter ego is trying to make some  WEIRD  dvd transactions once again. Without my knowing, she already inquired about the  L.A. Confidential  dvd (P 650)and she's also planning to inquire about the  Space Odyssey  dvd (P 800). She is technically broke right now and yet she can't stop herself from considering these purchases.   Please help her control her addiction before its too late. Like reminding her that she can't eat or drink her DVDs if worse comes to worst.   ------  I can't wait for thursday to come. We will be having our 265 classes again at the Intsru Lab where i usually get a good glimpse of my very handsome crush, Joaquin Jose Diokno Escay. Just thinking of his blonde, Aragorn-ish hair makes me blush. Something  WEIRD  happens though when I see him in my class. Dr.Saloma's words turn into mumblings all of a sudden and i'm trapped in my own world. Before i realize it, Dr.Saloma has already finished discussing a page or two of Born and Wolf.  I wish I could turn the hands of time and be young and foolish again. Because right now i'm just plain old and foolish.  ------

       Starry Night       "It is good to love many things, for therein lies strength, and whosoever performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done with love is well done." - Vincent Van Gogh, (1853 – 1890)  So here's a list of my mid-year resolutions..  I'll smile more often. I'll try my best to have a positive attitude. I will not think of financial woes all the time. I'll try to be a good teacher/student/researcher. I will not argue with my mom about anything. I will not spend money on dvds for a long while. I will minimize my internet use to 3 hrs at most. I will be considerate of my family's (even Margie's) feelings. I will try to lessen my sedentary lifestyle. I will not curse or say any cuss words. I will not be the sarcastic brat that i usually am. I will talk to God more openly about my feelings.

           The Shocker   (The amazing things we learn from the Internet  )      Follow this simple procedure:      Start with your outstretched hand, palm up.     Take your ring finger and touch it to your thumb.     Flatten your finger and thumb a bit, while your first, second and pinky fingers remain straight up.     Rotate your hand a little, so your straightened fingers are pointing somewhat sideways.  Congratulations, you have just made "The Shocker".          It is a gesture meant to indicate a sexual act, wherein the first and second fingers enter a vagina, while the errant pinky plunges into the anus; hence the "shock".   The gesture has taken on other, more explicit names like "Two in the pink and one in the stink" and "Two in the coot and one in the boot".    So, the next time you want to express your loathing for someone, you can try giving him the "shocker" instead of the usual "finger" gesture.

       goddess of laziness   Its monday again and my laziness is starting again. I was supposed to go to school today to research* and finish checking my students' data sheets but I wanted to sleep all day. I feel so exhausted, tired and sleepy, so here i am.   I've spent my weekend with my friends at Wewe's house for our long overdue DVD marathon. It gave me the taste of living with them albeit for a short period only. And i realized I'm not yet ready to live independently. My friends did all the cooking and cleaning stuff while all I could offer to do was buy Coke from the sari-sari store nearby.   Since I got home from Wewe's place, I've been sleeping as if i slipped into a coma. I couldnt even command myself to write my "things-to-do" schedule for the week, or fix my schoolbag at the very least.  I hope this is just a one-day debacle. --------------------  *research- anything that is related to my thesis and accomplishment thereof.
