      my body is a zoo of busted limbs and joints. i've been into grappling and martial arts for a while now. for the past couple years i've been laying low to allow my body to heal. every joint in my body except my left ankle has been messed up in matches. i was training to fight in no-holds-barred around 1999-2001, and i got my right ankle twisted 90 degrees inward, my left knee joint bent in two different ways in two different matches, and my right elbow hyperextended for about 10 seconds straight. so i've missed out on a lot of action.  the past couple of months, i've been feeling pretty good. my right elbow is strong again. my ankle felt fine. i decided to go up to sombo last tuesday. sombo is like collegiate wrestling, with judo throws, jujitsu joint locks, and lots and lots of leg submissions. leg/ankle locks are the somboist's specialty. this is the same place where my ankle was painfully snapped several years ago.  so i lace up my ankle and knee supports. i'm grappling, rolling around, clinching, slapping on submits, feeling my old glory once again. all my moves are still there, like i never took a respite.   toward the end of the session, i'm working in guard with one of my friends. guard is like, well, this is gross, but sort of like missionary position. i'm on bottom. this is a defensive position for the ground, a platform where you can sweep and reverse the guy, or try to submit your opponent with a choke or joint lock. so i'm showing him an armbar/sweep combo, and two guys who were in a match suddenly crash into us. a direct hit on my bad right ankle. a sharp pain. i cry out, and lay on the mat. they get some ice, and i'm on my back, my foot propped up on the bench, sadly watching the rest of the matches.  so now i'm back to the healing process. this really blows. by the time i get fully healed, i'll be too old for no-holds-barred tournaments. i hate singing the broken ankle blues.

      jumping on bandwagons is the official sport of birmingham. people love to be leashed and led in my city. the trend i currently hate the most is this whole post-fastandthefurious car customization trend. wannabe vin diesels loudly zoom up and down the streets of my neighborhood with ridiculous-looking vehicular monstrosities souped up with quadruple engines, nitrous oxide boosts, and spoilers that look like they were stolen from aircraft. it's gotten to the point where i'm awakened late at night by the loud nitro sonic booms and banshee tire screeches. and once i'm awakened, it takes me hours to get back to dreamland. i don't catch zzzzs very easily.  and wouldn't you know it, the same exact people who have these loud garish cars have the loud garish car stereos. so each car is a sort of cacophonous duet of nitro boost and rap bass. now, i have nothing against rap (i like some of it myself). but i don't like it when the bass starts thumping the bed i'm trying to sleep on.  i get so mad sometimes. but then i can't help but remember when i was in middle school, and we'd ride our skateboards up and down the streets and sidewalks of our neighborhood, ollieing off stairs, being loud and garish, screaming and laughing, pissing off people trying to relax and sleep.  ahhh, the vicious karmic cycle.

      i'm turning into katie holmes from abandon. you know, where she goes all crazy when people leave her and she kills the attempting-to-flee loved one.  well, important people seem to leave my life. at the most inopportune moment. like cm from maryland (god how i miss her). a couple days ago, i learned one of my art mentors is moving soon. he's the one who's responsible for me being where i am now, and where i'll be in the future. i like to think of myself as his protoge. he helped me cultivate my design skillset, and inspired me to bring my art and design to a point where i can actually make some money. well, i'm not gaining major bank right now, but i will be able (hopefully) to purchase a house very soon. scary, me owning a house. i'm getting old. 30 is the beginning of the end... ashley from creative writing class in high school said she was gonna kill herself before 30. ha, she's probably some conservative midwest housewife now baking peach cobbler and shopping at JC Penney for her five kids' clothes.  anyway, back to my mentor. working with him is such a joy. first off, we have a lot in common. how cool is it for a boss to take his employees to the skatepark in the middle of the workday? man, he was ripping up that half-pipe, too! and more importantly, i learn at least 3 new design techniques things from him everyday.  no, i'm not going to katie holmes him. i'm happy for him. he's going to be making some big bucks where he's going. six figures, i believe. he's one of those people that just goes for it. he's getting a design book published in october. i think he's even putting a screenshot of my work in it!  in the car, he told me i have a great future in art and design. i almost kissed him.

      i like it. a lot.  yeah, i know, i'm the worst cd reviewer ever. just buy the cd. pay no attention to the piss-grade reviews it got. my brother's girlfriend played it in the car and i loved it. so go to the local coconuts and buy it. and buy me one, too.  i don't own it yet.     (i promise i'll get better with my reviews. eventually. hopefully.)

      i was talking to a friend the other day. i was in the middle of watching bowling for columbine when he showed up, so he starts talking politics. he goes on about kerry and g.w. and republicans and democrats and left wing and right wing and congress and the presidential race and this and that. i just kept politely nodding and saying 'yeah' or 'uh-huh' or 'go bush!' at appropriate times. good thing he didn't ask me any questions about my personal political leanings. i confess i am an absolute dunce when it comes to politics. sometimes i tell myself i need to jump in, i'm almost 30 years old for bush's sake and i need to learn the political ways. at least the basics. like, you know, what the difference between republican and democrat is. yes, i do not know. i am an idiot. but i just don't have any interest in politics. to me it's just a garbled alien topic on cnn and the newspapers.  i feel so down sometimes, being a political ignoramus. but then, i think about my life, and the other things i have pursued in lieu of politics. martial arts, for instance. the next time this friend meets up with me, i'm gonna start talking about doing a sankaku jime/arm bar when i have him in guard after an abortive attempt at trying to take him down with a hane goshi after a kouchi/ouichi gari combo. yeah, he'll probably just nod and say 'yeah' at the appropriate times.

      i just got carded again yesterday. man, i'm 2 years to 30, and i'm still being carded. everyone thinks i'm 10 years younger than i am. maybe it's because i'm petite for manly standards. maybe it's because i never developed a deep voice. maybe it's because i'm anti-macho. i don't know, i guess it doesn't really bother me that i'm gonna be carded until i'm 60.  but just in case i do change my outlook in the future and want to avoid the pain-in-the-ass of having to pull out my id everytime i go somewhere, i've compiled a list of ways for me to become more 'manly' and 'adult-looking'. if anyone out there has any other suggestions, please let me know.  ways for andre to look older and be more macho/manly and avoid being carded:  --grow a beard --lay out in the sun and get a bunch of wrinkles for that gnarled, marlboro look --wear a tattered robe jawa-style so people won't be able to see my face and therefore be unable to ascertain my age --quit listening to modest mouse (like i am right now) --quit graphic design --stop writing fiction because writers are pansies --stop writing poetry because poets are pansies --become a construction worker --cultivate a nice pregnant-looking gut --soup up my civic with nitro and play booty bass at window-liquefying levels --drink beer (i've had one sip of alcohol in my whole life) --smoke (i've smoked all my life via second hand smoke... it's time to GRAB THE REINS and take control, man!!!) --only hang out with toddlers and newborns and zygotes so i look that much older in comparison --join an asian bike gang and terrorize the hoover suburbs --quit using so much lotion so my skin isn't so soft --get tattoos --actually grow up!

      i like it. i like it. i like it.  okay, i'm not the world's greatest cd reviewer. but i'll try a little harder than the above moronic chant.  i really like this cd. yeah, i see a lot of people giving this cd bad reviews. but they're losers. or they're not graphic designers. because i swear, every time i go to a graphic designer's livejournal or website, they cite modest mouse as their favorite band. i am a graphic designer. ergo, i like it.  modest mouse is a challenge to listen to. heck, i didn't even like them for the longest time. until i heard a song called 'paper thin walls' from their album 'the moon &amp; antarctica'. that was the initiation song. it cut through the fog in my eyes, it shattered the prejudicial blockade in my head, and hacked the binding thorn bushes around my heart. i was FREE. i could listen and savor the odd music of modest mouse. i became truly enlightened.  'good news for people who love bad news' is my new favorite album, ousting brand new's 'deja entendu' from my stereo. how can i describe it for those who haven't heard this band?.. hmmm... quirky art fag rock with the occasional horn interlude. mid-tempo muscle spasms. the soundtrack to easy-going hysteria. muzak for designers' studios.  i guess you'll have to listen to this band before you decide to buy 'good news for people who love bad news'. i can see a lot of people laughing at it, or crying, or breaking the disc in maniacal rage, furiated at spending twelve bucks on it. head over to amazon.com and listen to some sound snippets. if you already like this band, go to coconuts NOW, because it's on sale for $8.99. I don't know how long that lasts... or you can come over to my place, and i'll let you listen to it for $3. yeah! what a bargain!
