      If a weatherman comes on tv he's going to lie to you. He is not paid to give you accurate up to the minute in depth weather information, He's paid to get you to watch him. As long as you listen to what that stupid news monkey says, he keeps his job. No matter how wrong he is, he never gets any crap from anyone. Because when the bad weather doesn't happen, he just says, "Hey, we got lucky folks, thank the lord that crazy hellfire and brimstone I've been selling you for the last two days didn't happen." It didn't happen, cause it wasn't going t0 happen! He's a liar. I live in Savannah, Georgia, any uninformed person would say "Hmmmm, don't you get a lot of hurricanes there?" And the answer is NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! We don't get them. On the map we are tucked inland in this little cove. Currents always head for us and get sucked up to Wilmington, NC. Now that place is always ass deep in water. Wilmington gets bashed to pieces every couple of months, it's shocking anyone lives there. The weather report there must just be a shot of a buoy with the words "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE" written on it in blood floating by a flooded McDonalds. But here in Savannah, the weather's pretty nice most of the time. But our local weather people act like we live in the Dominican Republic. If the wind blows even the slightest, we're expected to run for the hills. 3 years ago, the weather monkeys got in such an up roar over a hurricane they closed the city down. We had to abandon our homes and jobs for 3 days and IT DIDN'T EVEN RAIN!! So this weekend when everyone was running from hurricane Charley, I just sat outside and laughed. I seriously need to take up looting, these people are idiots. I'll probably regret this whole post in 15 years when I want to run for mayor.  Some time in the near future I need to take the time to explain my dependence to my closest friend and confidant, The Big Ass Spoon. But for right now, I just want to mention that yesterday I could not find him. I looked all over town in every bar, store, and residence I have visited in the last week, desperately trying to find it. Fortunately, It turned up under some trash in my car this morning. I was actually surprised how much losing that spoon freaked me out. I think I need it around more than I thought.  It would be cool if someday, at least one person read one of these.

      I saw Anchorman and really had no opinion of it. I laughed during the movie &amp; forgot about most of it as soon as I walked out. It's just one of those SNL-type movies. A long skit full of cameos. You go, "Hey I know that guy, what a funny costume, oh cool he's dead isn't that funny." and then you go home. On the other hand there's Napoleon Dynamite. It's not for everyone. Off the top of my head I can think of like 4 people who'd get it. But for us lucky few who do, It's brilliant. Loved it to death. That guy is very talented and will be typecast forever. It doesn't matter since I'll be watching this movie again and again for the next 30 years.

      Hi folks, anyone who cares enough to look on here probably knows me, and anyone who knows me knows that I'm not a computer guy. So I'm still figuring this page out, but it could be fun. It's Friday which means karaoke tonight at Daiquiri Island on Abercorn at 10:00pm. Your host for this evening will be "Ruben Studdard's lost cousin" Antonio who will have the place jumping all evening. I myself will probably be stuffing my face with tacos in the parkinglot of Books-a-Million, or sitting in a stripclub. Yeah, that's a hard decision. Wonder what I'm going to do there?! I will however be hanging out with the karaoke groupies at the D.I. on Saturday, when your host will be "The Littlest Brave" Travis. So come hang out with us at the Island this weekend, and me and my spoon will catch up with you later.
