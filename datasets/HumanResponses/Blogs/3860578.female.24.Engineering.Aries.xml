      7-15-2004 My pathetic life Background – Clumsy – Our Lady Peace  It’s finally Thursday, how the days pass by so quickly. I don’t know if I should feel so happy nor should I feel sad coz of what has recently been. I’m happy coz Jae and I are in good terms right now and let’s just add that the sex last night was an added bonus. Some flaws about last night but I could easily forgive. But I know deep down inside I’m sad for Marlon. I don’t want my friend to turn out like that but I have to. Well Jae went here coz of some stupid computer glitch again. So he brought in his computer and I tried to fix it again. Well why we were hanging out in my room I was tickling and fondling him maybe I was just happy that I have somebody to share moments like such. As Jae fiddled with my phone he asked who was my ex beau that I told him the other night and he saw Erwin’s messages. Erwin was my ex beau while I was reviewing for the board exams. It was a very funny thing for Erwin was a Mechanical Engineering from UST and knowing my reputation in Engineering before at PUP that I really hated those guys from Mechanical Engineering and got into fights with them. But we were so over each other and we try to keep in touch with each other. Of course being a super seloso guy Jae wouldn’t even understand such. He would only see it as someone who’s trying to win me back to their arms. I tried to make it up to him while we were making out in my bed and though we really had our own kick just making out in my bed coz Jae doesn’t want to do it in our house which is I’m very grateful for. Well Jae has to leave already for he has to do some errands and he has to drop me off in a nearby talipapa. As I asked for my kissie he looked at me as if I was crazy knowing that there are lots of people around because of what his recent problem was he was not to be seen publicly with any girl. I was quite offended, I knew about it but that was one of out troubles before that we cannot go even to the mall just to chill out because his mom would be enraged about it. Jae has some issues concerning his love life before that he couldn’t be committed with anyone. This made me think like I had people waiting for me hand and foot just to even give them the time of day and this jerk was really acting up so much that I still talk to him? I am crazy aint i? Well my sanity holds to a string from a spider web and all I can hope for right now is to clear my mind about things to finally decide on what to do.

      7-14-2004 Background: Say what you want - Texas My pathetic life  Reality Bites  Well the previous days were really crazy as it seems. Aside from the brawl last Saturday night and jae and I speaking with each other again seems like patching up things left behind. It really seems like were trying to make things work out. Yesterday he cried after I told him that I’ve recently communicated with my ex beau. As I thought that things were working out great then I just had to tell him that, I could’ve just shut my mouth about the subject but I opted to still tell him about it. Call me sadistic but maybe what I did was uncalled for but I’m so fed up with jae always accusing me of doing this and that I told him that given a chance to do it I’d do it so that whatever is bothering him would be true and that being accused of doing such wont be just plain accusations. I went to the mall to buy some stuff for myself and it was pretty long when I was in the mall. The last time I went out was with crix. While I was in the mall jae sent me an sms asking if it’ll take me that long to be still in the mall coz he was thinking of meeting up. I went home already coz I though we wont be meeting up already at around 8:30pm he went to fetch me from my place. I know it was really bad for me to such things but I also gave in. my feelings for him is still strong to the point it clouds my morality check and my thinking. We got home by 2 minutes before midnight. After that my friend called me up, it was marlon. Marlon has been courting me for ages and I’ve known him for so long already. He knows about jae and me but the last time we talked my relationship with jae was on the rocks and it was good to hear from someone who was much wiser in such things. He was quite sensible about most things and he really proves to be my friend when I told marlon that things are getting pretty well again with jae he was surprised because he was rooting that lately he has been given a chance to show me how special I was to him. Call me stupid but sometimes I don’t really care that much for those things what counts to me is that I have a friend who really is there for me. We were on the phone for several hours but we were really just there silent. I feel bad I know the reason why marlon was upset was because of me and it felt that I took everything away from him. Jae was trying to call me at around half past 4 but I cant leave marlon just like that so I decided to just even out things first. In as much as that my feelings for jae is still strong and that there are things he does to win me back and knowing that someone there is suffering for the pain I’ve inflicted on him for leaving him, I just hope that everything would work out fine. But you know deep down inside half of me was wishing that jeff would suddenly appear out of nowhere for I know when that time comes I wouldn’t be confused on whom to choose- definitely him.

      Trust is like glass, it's fragile, needs intensive care and most of all once it has been broken nothing can make it the same. Trust is the basis of any relationship, if you don't trust your partner then you guys are in deep shit than expected. I was rummaging through my old stuff awhile ago, cleaning things, and then I sorted out my Magic the Gathering Cards. After awhile I fell asleep on my bed while the cards are still on it. Then I saw my sister was using the phone so I decided to go back to sleep. After almost an hour my phone rang it was jae and I was surpised coz he called up again. We talked and as usual it went from him accusing me of having another boyfriend and that I did it while we were still a couple. I'm so getting used to these conversations so I just let it passed but today seemed a little different, he was hyper and everything unil came a point that he blurted out that he is still jealous of just the thought that I might be dating another guy. He told me that he still loves me and all that. I still do love him but he hasn't changed a bit he is still the jealous type and if we go back from where we hit it off it'll just be disaster. I dunno I'll just live one day at a time.

      7-11-2004 11:57pm My pathetic Life  Background: You got it bad – Usher  It’s Sunday and as expected it was really more of like Hell- day for me. My body was cursing in seven different languages as it ached because I stayed up till about 7:30 in the morning because of the different things I arranged and cleaned up. It was the dreaded after – party wherein you’re supposed to clean up all the mess. After updating my blog awhile ago I decided to rest already. I woke up at around 11 am to find out that I was the only one left in the house again, I should be used to all of this waking up I’m alone in the house again because it’s what is happening here in this household. After reflecting upon the things that just happened I ate my brunch and then decided to rest again- call me a pig but hey! I needed all the rest I can. I awoke at 5pm in the afternoon just ample time to help set up for dinner. After dinner and clearing out the dishes and stuff my parents and I had a little chit chat about what has happened. After watching a little of the tube coz my sister was using the phone. After my sister was finished with her phone conversations she went to her room and I picked up my mobile phone to see a missed call from someone yep, it was arjae. I’m quite happy he was trying to call me but also sad coz of what has happened to us. I know that what I did would benefit both of us and it would stop the verbal abuse I get from him. As usual it went as jae accusing me of having another boyfriend and that I was with him last night and everything. They have already buried his uncle who was dead and he just told me he got a new mobile phone everything went out pretty well aside from the other side comments wherein he constantly utters about me having another relationship. At first I was irritated but once I got immune to it seems like usual already. There came a point wherein jae kept pushing that I do have a bf and that I hafta admit it but when he asked me that if there was such if I’d admit it and answered yes that I would he suddenly blurted out like that would hurt on his part, maybe arjae hasn’t moved on yet. As much as I still love arjae but knowing and remembering how he’d hurt me being a jealous-type of boyfriend makes me think twice to get back with him. We talked for awhile then crix called me up on my mobile then it was on loudspeaker so arjae was hearing the whole conversation so that he wouldn’t be so suspicious telling me it’s a boy again. But still what kept me up till this time of the wee hours of the morning is what jae’s reaction was. Maybe I do miss him, miss being his girl and him being my boo but if what happened kept on going on then it wont go anywhere.

      It's the saturday on the week of my sister's birthday,my sis was planning to invite some friends over for a little get together on our place.my mom just knew it friday evening and it was gonna be held on saturday night.My hommies and I always have a saturday session wherein we always drink and just get track of each other like an outlet of what's been going on lately.So my hommies finally decided to just hold it also here coz we were there already. After a few drinks and minding our own business of course being guys and assholes and a half with their big EGOs wherein they just have to show others that "hey, you can't do this and that to me". Actually my sister's group and my friends got into a little hot headed discussion, and then as expected it grew into something more intense that they would wanna fight it over. Aside from all the physical torture i got from setting up the place, cleaning this and that doing this and that this is what I get.Upsetting as it could be they wanted justice for what has happened coz they really think that one of our friend was offended and needs an apology from my sis' friends but coz of the bad blood going on we had to break it off.I'm really quite disappointed on what has happened. My best bud omeng was really steaming hot with anger about what was happening and wanted blood there right at that moment, it was hard preventing a 5'11" guy who weighs about 200 lbs but I tried hard to prevent him from going back to the house. After a few moments we calmned down and thank God that my gwampa manok has started cracking us up and my friend promised that they'll set home already.I dunno what i should feel but restless is one and its already 7am here and i still am awake...  As million thoughts cross my mind right noow, about life, work, hobbies, my family, my friends, my ex and that someone special who again nagparamdam lang and left me hanging na naman (pathetic mode na naman ako)

      Another Day On My Pathetic Life Background music: Hold On – Jamie Walters Mood: pathetic   There comes a point on everybody’s life that you just get so fucked up crazy on such a thing, a fad, a rock band and of course on someone special.Your so fucked up crazily hooked on something like an addiction of some sort. My story aint unusual, lets just say that I’m still so hooked up on this particular guy. Yes I know it was just days after my break-up with my recent boyfriend, although you know that I do love you jae but seems like things aint working out for us… its better for us to be this way. It hurts me a lot every time you accuse me of being unfaithful to you, I aint polygamous and I aint that type of girl who beats around the bush just for kicks. I know it hurts you everytime we bicker but if we just bicker a lot maybe it aint worth all the heartaches we’re going through. I know you’ll find another one to fulfill all what I’ve left out on. Well as jae thinks that I’ve moved on pretty well maybe I don’t, maybe I’m just letting things flow as tears come and go this just would make me a better person.   There’s really a time in your life that you’re so damn crazy about a certain person and I myself felt it only for this special friend of mine. It all started with just a chat session, then after that chat session he called me up at my parent’s house. I was home for the weekday coz it was my rest day and being bored to death at the house I was thankful for someone to talk to. It turned out that he’s also into Magic the Gathering the card game. I was really addicted to that game and before I was the only girl who plays in greenhills. Maybe from thereon we just hit it off. One day he went to my ‘rents house to play against me on the said card game. Call me EGOMANIAC but I hate losing especially to a guy. Yes victory it was for me when I beat him 2 – 1 on the said card game. I know they say that I project a some sort of sexual aura but hey! If your really into each other having sex was just an expression of your love for the other. Yeah we had sex. After sometime being busy with our own work and our own lives we just have to part ways. After parting ways we didn’t have that much communication with each other than the once in a blue moon sms or call just saying hi.   Well last Sunday as I was watching BAD BLOOD of WWE on the tube with my best friend I got this unusual sms from my special friend. We exchanged several sms’ just saying hi then there came a point wherein he asked me if we can meet up again, basically on what most people are thinking right now “hey! Your ex bf’s horny and wanna get laid!”  That’s what also the thought on my head was. But he said that he just wanna play again against me, I told him I don’t know where my cards were but I’d look for it. After a few days I received a message asking me if I found it already ok so I know where my cards were but I aint sure if I wanna see him again. I admit that my feelings were still strong for him. He was basically what I wanted in a guy, Very Intelligent, stable, sweet, kind, responsible and an added bonus that he plays magic! He went at my place awhile ago and after 3 friendly games of magic as usual my cards won 2-1 again! I keep on teasing him coz I beat him again! After a few minutes we had to go to my room for him to look at some cards I have on my trash cards. I was stalling for time and distracting his thoughts of doing it. After sometime he lay on my bed and just held my hand at first and told me he was leaving already. After a tickle, a kiss and some sweet nothings I finally gave in. I was so distracted coz I don’t wanna do it with him coz we aint an item anymore but my something inside me was telling me to just let it all go and make him feel how and what I feel about him. It hurts me to think that I’m doing it with someone I aint involved in but it hurts me more to think of not letting him know how I feel.  (Oh Great my player’s playing “Insensitive” by jann arden). He told me before that he still cannot forget me and what we did. Call me stupid or worst “TANGA” but I gave in to that and I know that line was used a million times by guys but I actually bought that. Maybe it was my feelings for him that he knows I treat him special. Actually he aint that type of jerk to just be gloating about what I did to him. (actually we didn’t have sex, I just gave him something far out to remember me). Call me a slut, call me a bitch and call me anything that you guys wants to but I did it coz my emotions about him are still strong. He told me that he was quite embarrassed coz we did it (literally) even we aint involved already and he knows that what I did was supposed to be for someone special and he knows that I treat him special (talk about redundancy) . I didn’t want to react, I just smiled and said it was nothing and he knows how I feel. Half of me was happy for I shared something special with him and half of me was condemning me to death for what a stupid thing I did, I was condemning myself of being a slut, bitch and an asshole as well.  Am I a bitch or a slut coz of what I did? Why cant I just divert those feelings that I feel for him to other people who treats me like a goddess and is just waiting hand and foot on me?  Bothered? Yes very much, my morally demented mind is already stricking me with guilt about what I did. I may be stupid for what I did maybe we all are just too stupid when we feel something so strong…
