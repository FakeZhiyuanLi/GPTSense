      Hey Yall. Today I went to school(horke) and we went swimming at Churchill Pool. Ashley touched the bottom of the deep end(girl I swear to god thats like 10 feet) and we had an overall good ass time :P At school Ms Miller made us play Scatergories and dont get me wrong I love the game but it sux when you play it as a class so yes.....boring... My cat Zooti tends to chew my hair because he loves water and/or chlorine so aha I had a fucking fun after school. I also got my Social Security Number so in 3 weeks I will be able to legally get a job! So yes there is not much else, oh and I have the song Truly Madly Deeply by Savage garden stuck in my head so ya...life sux lol.  This is just out to all mah girls at Sherbrooke and Heath! I LOVE YOU GUYS DONT EVER CHANGE! KEEP THE FLAWS TOO!:P

      Heya! First off, let me just say, "Happy Canada Day!" to all the canadians out there reading this! Yeah! Go us! lol Wow its been a while. Well I just got 2 my grammaz, and quite obviously Im on her PC. I just got The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Marilyn Manson's autobiography. What can I say? Its so kickass. I highly recommend it *thumbs up*. Not much else has been going on. I swear to God tho its fucking rained every day in Thunder Bay for at least 2 weeks. It sucks, man. I had a good chat with Amanda on the phone, havent talked 2 her in a long time. So that was fun. Gunna watch the fireworks tonight from my grammas balcony :) Her living on the top floor of an apartment rules, except Im deathly afraid of heights. Oh well fuck it :P So thats about it. Peace, people!  "Somebody get this freakin' duck away from  me!"

      Well not much has happened this summer. At Ashleys Bre called random numbers(plus my cousin and Renee) as John, the dude who lives down the street. Ya. It kicked major ass. Also tonight(Im at my Grammz) the cops shot another bear out here. It kicked ass. And I ordered The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Marilyn Mansons autobio. Supposed to get it in about 4 days. I also bought The Wordsworth Golden Treasury of Verse. Poems that are a few centuries old, including The Lady of Shallot. Well thats bout it.
