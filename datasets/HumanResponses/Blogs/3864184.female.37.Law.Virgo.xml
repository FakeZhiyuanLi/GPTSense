      On a bright and sunny morning in the back woods of Michigan I woke to the sound of singing birds in the trees.  As I laid there contemplating the day I wondered what made me choose to return to this hole in the wall town.  I knew the answer, if I wanted to be honest.  It was a combination of boredom and love of my mother.  I had bolted from Idlewild as soon as I was able, off to California, as far away as possible, to escape what I believed to be hell on earth.  What else would you call a small town with nothing to do, nothing to offer and no hope of change ever.  I called it hell.  California, on the other hand, seemed like heaven.  Fun, exciting and very far away from Michigan.  After two years in heaven, however, I figured out what got to me was staying in any place for too long.  Two years had been too long for California.  In an effort to change my surroundings I took a few quick classes in French and signed up with an agency that placed American nannies with families in France.  I signed up for an 18 month stint, trying to curb the possible boredom I might find in France if I were to commit myself to staying any longer than that.  After going through the telephone interview process with many families, I was hired by a family in Sceaux and scheduled to arrive at their home in October.  Those arrangements in place I quickly packed my things and headed back to Michigan to spend the 3 months prior to October with my mother.    Now here I was, waking up in what I use to view as hell, Idlewild, Michigan.  Idlewild was once a bustling summer vacation spot for black families. It was established in the 1920s and grew through the '30s and '40s as Jim Crow laws prevented blacks from renting or owning homes in then-popular lakeside vacation spots.  It was a place where families from Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and elsewhere would meet each summer to fish, hunt, swim and enjoy the pastoral woods. That was the early days.  It still served as a vacation spot for many since fishing, hunting and swimming could still be enjoyed, but the "bustling" days were over and had been over for quite some time.  Money had left Idlewild many years prior and from the vacant and boarded up properties throughout, it didn’t look like it would be coming back anytime soon.  When I was a small child living in Dayton, Ohio we came to Idlewild frequently to vacation.  We stayed in a cottage that my father had helped build as a child with his granfather.  A small two bedroom house with no running water, a big wood stove in the middle of the living room and a fenced in porch that my brother and I shared as a bedroom.  I don’t remember hating the experience, and actually believe my brother and I enjoyed it.   Hot summers in Idlewild included playing outside,  driving into “town” to buy ice ceam at Jones and having our parent’s undivided attention.  It was a place that we  visited .  When our parents informed us, the summer before I started high school, we would be moving there to live full time, I knew they couldn’t be serious.  No one  lived  in Idlewild.  They didn’t even have a big grocery store, let alone a mall!  I was also pretty sure they didn’t have a high school, but that thought didn’t seem to cause me as much greif as no mall.    Two months later I found out that while I was right about there being no mall, I was wrong about everything else.  People actually did live in Idlewild, they did have a big grocery store (“big” being a relative term) and to my even greater dismay I learned that they did have an elementary, middle and high school!  All things considered, the three years I spent as a teenager living in Idlewild were not that bad.  Yes, I viewed it as hell on earth, but that was the general consensus of all the teenagers in the Lake County area because there was NOTHING to do.  This small fact lead to bigger problems like teen pregnancy and high drug use, but I managed to avoid those pitfalls and left for California as soon as my parents said I could.  Now here I was, back at square one, if only temporarily, to hang out with my mother.  My mother lives on one of the many lakes in the county.  Of the 5 houses that surround the lake my mother’s is the only one that is occupied year round.  The other neighbors only visit for a portion of the summer.  Right now, towards the end of September, we are all alone.  Me, my mom, Honey, our golden lab, and the mosquitos.  It’s very quiet, with the exception of the birds singing in the trees,  and quite serene.  At moments like this I wonder why I had been so quick to bolt two years prior.  Then I recall my epiphany about boredom.  Were it not for the fact that I was scheduled to leave for France in two days today might have been identical to the almost 3 months of other days I’d spent in Idlewild which consisted mostly of sleeping in and doing nothing.  This was, however, the last day I would spend with my mom before heading to Detroit to begin my journey to France.    My mom took the day off from work so that we could spend some quality time together.  Quality time with my mom can be as simple as being in the same room, same house, or general vicinity.  My mom has an aura about her that can be felt miles from her physical being.  Its an amazing thing but one that I am quite dependent on – her aura seemed to reach out to me while I was in California keeping me from feeling so far away.  While I couldn’t be sure that she was happy about my decision to go to Europe, I was sure that she loved me and supported pretty much whatever I threw at her in the form of a personal decision.  I often found myself wondering where that ability came from, if its one of those gifts you receive once you become a parent or something some people simply possess.

      I’m so pissed off.  In March of 2003 I was admitted to the emergency room of Meridian Park Hospital because I was very ill.  I couldn’t catch my breath, I didn’t respond to my husband, I didn’t respond to anyone.  I was out of it.  After checking me in the doctors were so sure that I was not going to live through the night that they asked my husband if I wanted to donate my organs.  THAT’s how sick I was.  By the following morning I had been up all night being worked on by doctors.  I had  a stint put into my heart so that they could draw blood directly from the point since my veins were nonexistent in such a dehydrated state.  I was better, breathing and talking, in a knowing state of where I was and what was going on, even though still very weak.  Around 11:15 that morning a phlebotomist came into my room to draw blood.  He was sent from the lab because they needed blood from my veins and the nurse’s were unable to do it in such a dehydrated state.  The phlebotomist entered the room, advised me why he was there and then tied rubber tubing around my arm.  At this point I shut my eyes in an effort to rest while this was being done.  I had been up all night, was exhausted and sick of all the commotion that had been constantly around me.  Once the needle was inserted the phlebotomist put his hand on my left breast and fondled me.  Being completely honest my first thought was that this must be a way in which to get the blood flowing so that they could withdraw the blood required.  I knew they had been having a problem, and it was all that seemed to make sense.  He removed his hand and then placed it again on my left breast again fondling.  Again I thought it must be a medical routine.  He removed his hand when my day nurse came into the room to check and see if everything was alright, that he was able to draw the blood successfully.  He answered her and she left the room again and again, he placed his hand on my left breast.  At this point I began to believe that something was not right with this situation so I opened my eyes and looked up at him.  He was not looking at me, but was looking into the hallway as if to watch and be sure that no one could see what he was doing.  He then removed his hand from my breast , took the needle out and left my room telling me that he hoped I felt better.  Immediately after this encounter I was taken to have an MRI, then my husband and children came to visit and then I was allowed to try and get some rest.  It was not until later that evening when I was finally alone, trying (unsuccessfully) to sleep that I replayed the day and the encounter with the phlebotomist.  I buzzed the nurse to come in and when she did I told her that the phlebotomist had felt me up.  That I had thought it must be some way to get blood circulating, but on reflection I was sure he had felt me up.  She reported my complaint to the powers that be and the positioning began.  When my husband visited me the next morning I informed him of the event and he immediately went to talk to whoever was in charge.  The hospital immediately took the position that I was a nut and this did not happen.  They were extremely defensive about the whole thing and without blatantly saying the words called me a liar.  I was in ICU for 6 days.  When I got out of the hospital I was required to be off work for a month.  A week after I was released from the hospital I felt better and left my house for the first time.  I went to the Police Department and filed charges for sexual assault.  Of course the police spoke to the phlebotomist who denied that he had done anything and under the circumstances, because it was my word against his, and no witnesses were present, there was nothing the Police could do.  Two months after my incident in March, the same phlebotomist did the same thing to another patient at the same hospital and this time there was a witness to his act.  The police called to inform me that they were reopening the case because now there were two unrelated women accusing the same person of doing the same thing.  In September me and the other victim testified before a grand jury which indicted the phlebotomist on four counts of sexual assault.  In May of 2004 the trial was to begin against him.  The first thing to happen was that the two cases were severed.  Apparently it’s the courts prerogative to bend over backwards and help the defendant in any way it can.  By separating the two cases it meant that a jury would only hear about one incident and form their opinions on his guilt or innocence on that limited bit of information.  As it played out the other victim’s case went first – the one with a witness – and ultimately the jury found the bastard NOT GUILTY.    I’m so pissed off.  I’ve decided many things, mainly that I must vent my frustration in writing and then let it all go, but I’ve also decided that simply because he was found not guilty in her case does not mean I will give up my efforts and not go forward with my case.  I feel duty bound to at least try and get him convicted.  Chances are even slimmer in my situation that he will be convicted but I feel like I have to try.  There are many things in my favor that were not in hers.    She was 19, and I am 37.  I have been married to the same man for 18 years and come across as a very stable and forthright individual.  Not only was she 19, but she also spoke to the press about the incident A LOT.  She created a circus atmosphere by talking to the paper and the TV stations frequently.  I understand what she was doing, trying to get the information out there to alert people to the problem, but I had no desire to talk to the press and become part of the circus.  The defense attorney in her case flat out said she was lying and simply in this for the money – although I don’t expect them to say that about me, cause my actions have proven different, I do expect them to say that I was very ill and although I believe this is what happened, in my state, how could anyone trust what I believed to be happening as truth.  WHATEVER.  I know what he did, HE knows what he did, and now, fortunately, his wife knows what he did two because even though the jury didn’t know two separate people with no connection whatsoever accused him of doing the same exact thing, SHE knows that and must live with that.  Am I prepared to go to trial.  I don’t know if you can be prepared.  I was advised the defense attorney cried during closing arguments, CRIED at the injustice that was being served on his client, a fine upstanding model employee at the hospital – injustice because he is Pakistani, which in America’s vision equates to Arab – and this was all befalling him because of 911 – again WHATEVER.  The man is a sicko preying on innocent, very ill women in a state where they cannot help themselves and he needs to STOP.  I don’t believe I was his first victim, only the first to make the complaint, and if he isn’t found guilty I have no doubt that I’ll be the last. . . .   I’m just so pissed off at the injustice and the unfairness of the court system.  I don’t know why this surprises me though.  O.J. was found not guilty, Michael Jackson will surely be found not guilty and  Scott Peterson is destined for the same fate.  I’d love to be wrong about the last two, but I am so bitter and pissed off right now I just can’t find the strength to think anything more.
