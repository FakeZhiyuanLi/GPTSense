         Karen Kunawicz        What is the sound of one heart breaking?  It is the sound of someone curled up in a tiny ball crying softly in the night,  the sound of the first unwanted teardrop touching your skin,  it's the sound of a telephone that doesn't ring,  the sound of regret pounding inside your brain with every heartbeat,  it's the whispers of the toy animals he gave you.   It's the shuffling of feet walking away from you,  the sound of your soul shattering into a million pieces  at recognizing the word "goodbye,"  it's the soundtrack of memories torturing you,  it's the sound of feeble hands trying to push back the obstinate hands of time,  it's the sound of cherub's dying breath,  the sound of all those years disappearing in the vortex of Cupid's kitchen sink,  it's the unrelenting, plaintive baby meows  of an abandoned kitten outside an ignoring door.   It's the sound of the rain that doesn't ever stop,  the sound of all the doors in the world  shutting and closing in your face at the same time,  of raging, howling storms in the night when there's no one there to hold you, the sound of your voice as it screams back at you,  the echo of "I love you" burning holes in you,  the sound your heart makes as it tells you to lie still  because nothing you will ever do will matter without love. The sound of the waves at the polluted beach you went to  as it moves from the shore and crashes inside your mind,  of the sniffles that make up your pathetic "SOS-to-the-world,"  the cracking of the brittle black-red petals from the sidewalk vendor roses he gave, the sound of the music he used to make going to your gut. The sound of things in your room being thrown around and landing on the floor,  the caress of sharpened kitchen knives on skin,  the sound your throat makes as you swallow your saltiest tear.  It's the sound of your own voice calling out to someone who isn't there,  of winged creatures dying and falling on a city pavement,  of terms of endearment used a hundred times a day  struggling to crawl into a vacuum of forgetfulness,  it's the sound of your own sobs keeping you company,  it's the cold, uncaring stillness of the air you share your space with.   Destruction isn't always as noisy as bombs exploding.  Sometimes the ultimate catastrophes are as quiet  as feather falling on the floor of a Zen monastery.  No one else can really hear your heart breaking except you.

         (Author Unknown)      Many people are afraid of growing old.  I'm afraid of growing old and boring.  Many people are afraid of growing old, alone.  I'm afraid of growing old, insane.  Many people are afraid of losing their looks.  I'm afraid of losing my dreams.  Many people are afraid of losing their youth.  I'm afraid of losing my soul.     When you're 15, 35 seems ancient.  When you're 35, 15 seems juvenile.  A turnaround in a split second - two decades zoom past and before you know it, it's only a mile to the next millennium.  Don't' fear age - it's a right of personhood.  Don't fear death - it's God's greatest jest.  Don't grow old - you don't have to.        Don't date because you're desperate.  Don't marry because you're miserable.  Don't have kids because you think your genes are superior.  Don't separate because you think it's fashionable.  Don't drink because you have troubles.  Don't gamble because you think winning is inevitable.  Don't philander because you think you're irresistible.  Most likely, you're not.        Don't associate with people you can't trust.  Don't cheat.  Don't lie.  Don't pretend.  Don't try to buy your way into the kingdom of God.  Don't dictate because you're smarter.  Don't demand because you're stronger.   Don't sleep around because you think you're old enough and know better.  Don't hurt your kids because loving them is harder.  Don't sell your self, your family or your ideals.     Don't stagnate.   Don't regress.  Learn a new skill.  Find a new friend.  Start a new career.  Don't live in the past.  Time can't bring anything or anyone back.  Don't put your life on hold for possibly Mr. Right.   Don't throw your life away on absolutely Mr. Wrong because your biological clock is ticking and you can't afford to have your eggs harvested before the new millennium.  There's always a mad rush to something, somewhere but victory does not always belong to those who finish first.  Sometimes, there is no race to be won only a price to be paid for some of life's morehasty decisions.  You can't always go with the throng who could be wrong.  Sometimes, you have to be alone to be enlightened.  To terminate your loneliness, reach out to the homeless.  To feed your nurturing instincts, care for the needy.  To fulfill your parenting fantasies, get a puppy.  Don't bring another life into this world for all the wrong reasons.  To keep yourself warm, buy a jacket. In the long-run, it will be less complicated and less costly.   To make yourself happy, pursue your passions and be the best of what you can be.  Simplify your life.  Take away the clutter.  Get rid of destructive elements - abusive friends, nasty habits and dangerous liaisons.  Don't abandon your responsibilities but don't overdose on duty.  Don't live life recklessly without thought and feeling for your family.  Be true to yourself.  Don't commit when you're not ready.  Don't keep others waiting needlessly.  Fall in love - it's the greatest thing on earth.  But take care and remember, after the fall must come the rise.  Go on that trip.  Don't postpone it.  Say those words.  Don't let the moment pass.  Do what you must even at society's scorn.   Write poetry.  Love deeply. W alk barefoot.  Hold hands.  Dance with wild abandon. Cry at the movies.  Take care of yourself.  Don't wait for someone to take care of you.  You light up your life.  You drive yourself to your destination.  No one completes you - except you.  It is true that life doesn't get easier with age.  It only gets more challenging.  Don't be afraid.  Don't lose your capacity to love.  Pursue your passions.  Live your dreams.  Don't lose faith in God.    Don't grow old. Just grow-up.

         (Author Unknown)     I choose to love you in silence... For in silence I recieve no rejection  Nor should I bother of what it is that prevents us from being together - its just that we can never be together.  I choose to love you in loneliness... For in loneliness, no one owns you  but I.  I choose to adore you from a distance... For distance will shield us from pain.  Still, I love you and I just can't help but do so...  I choose to kiss you in the wind For the wind is gentler than my lips  I choose to hold you in my dreams... For in my dreams, you have no end.  Forever.  That is what you are to me.  In all honesty, I find it hard to believe that I will ever love somebody the same way I loved you.  Thanks for the experience, I loved it while it lasted. I can't help but smile during those times that you threw me out of focus - those times that you made me panic as to what I could do just to appease your call.  Thanks for those times that you almost destroyed my sanity. I always knew it was done for anyway.  Thanks for all the phone calls, all the emails, and all the small things that you did. Without them, I may have not even been sure that I really loved you.  And most of all, thanks for being honest. Thank you for putting me back on track. You would be a constant reminder of a God's gift.  Maybe you were right:  Love is an attachment... to someone who'll never be yours.  Love is something we will never have... something we'll never experience  And I really meant my reply.  The sun maybe up, but the moon does not vanish. It may wane, yes, it may  even seem to fade. But one thing is certain. It remains in its sky...

         Lord,     Make me an instrument of your peace.  Where there is hatred. Let me bring love.  Where there is injury, pardon.  Where there is doubt, faith.  Where there is despair, hope.  Where there is darkness, light.  Where there is sadness, joy.  Where there is discord, harmony.  Where there is error, truth.  Where there is wrong, the spirit of forgiveness.   O Divine Master.  Grant that I may not so much seek  To be consoled as to console.  To be understood as to understand.  To be loved as to love.  For it is in giving that we receive.  It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.  It is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

         (Author Unknown)     A time comes in your life when you finally get it... When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks, and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out - ENOUGH! Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on. And, like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum, your sobs begin to subside, you shudder once or twice, you blink back your tears, and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes. This is your awakening.   You realize that it's time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness, safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon. You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there aren't always fairy tale endings (or beginnings for that matter), and that any guarantee of "happily ever after" must begin with you; and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance. You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love, appreciate or approve of who or what you are ... and that's OK (They are entitled to their own views and opinions). And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself; and in the process a sense of new found confidence is born of self-approval. You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you (or didn't do for you) and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected.You learn that people don't always say what they mean or mean what they say, and that not everyone will always be there for you; and that it's not always about you. So, you learn to stand on your own, and to take care of yourself; and in the process a sense of safety and security is born of self-reliance.   You stop judging and pointing fingers ... and you begin to accept people as they are, and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties; and in the process a sense of peace and contentment is born of forgiveness. You realize that much of the way you view yourself, and the world around you, is as a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche. And  you begin to sift through all the crap you've been fed about how you should behave, how you should look, and how much you should weigh; what you should wear and where you should shop, and what you should drive; how and where you should live, and what you should do for a living; who you should sleep with, who you should marry, and what you should expect of a marriage; the importance of having and raising children, or what you owe your parents. You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for.  You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you've outgrown, or should never have bought into to begin with; and in the process you learn to go with your instincts.   You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive. And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing; and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a "consumer" looking for your next fix.   You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era, but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life. You learn  that you don't know everything, it's not your job to save the world ... and that you can't teach a pig to sing.   You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility, and the importance of setting boundaries, and learning to say NO. You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry, and that martyrs get burned at the stake.   Then you learn about love. Romantic love and familial love. How to love, how much to give in love, when to stop giving, and when to walk away. You learn not to project your needs or your feelings onto a relationship. You learn that you will not be more beautiful, more intelligent, more lovable or important because of the man on your arm or the child that bears your name.   You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be. You stop trying to control people, situations and outcomes. You learn that just as people grow and change, so it is with love...and you learn that you don't have the right to demand love on your terms ... just to make you happy. And, you learn that alone does not mean lonely. And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size 5 or a perfect 10, and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you "stack up." You also stop working so hard at putting your feelings aside, smoothing things over and ignoring your needs. You learn that feelings of entitlement are perfectly OK.... and that it is your right to want things and to ask for the things that you want...and that sometimes it is necessary to make demands.   You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love, kindness, sensitivity and respect; and you won't settle for less. And, you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his touch ... and in the process you internalize the meaning of self-respect. And you learn that your body really is your temple, and you begin to care for it and treat it with respect. You begin eating a balanced diet, drinking more water and taking more time to exercise. You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear. So you take more time to rest.   And, just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul. So you take more time to laugh and to play. You learn, that for the most part, in life you get what you believe you deserve ... and that much of life truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for, and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen. More importantly, you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction, discipline and perseverance. You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that it's OK to risk asking for help. You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time. FEAR itself. You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it, and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms. And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.   You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't always get what you think you deserve; and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting, good people. On these occasions you learn not to personalize things. You learn that God isn't punishing you or failing to answer your prayers. It's just life happening. And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state - the ego. You learn that negative feelings such as anger, envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you, and poison the universe that surrounds you. You learn to admit when you are wrong and to building bridges instead of walls.   You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted, things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about; a full refrigerator, clean running water, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower. Slowly, you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself; and you to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself and to never, ever, settle for less than your heart's desire. And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind. And you make it a point to keep smiling, to keep trusting, and to stay open to every wonderful possibility.   Finally, with courage in your heart and with a higher power by your side you take a stand; you take a deep breath, and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can.

      Infallible as you are to Einstein I cannot help but regard you With such wariness.   Understandably so... You, which I cannot see, smell, and touch Only feel.  The sun seizing Moments of life Dancing rapidly.  The shapeless moon  Tiptoes in the dark Leaving shadows.  Raindrops wooing Leaves golden yet shy Snow on a postcard.  Fallen friendships  Ceased breathing  Withered youth.  Love forgotten Unrequited Gone.  Love resurrected Untamed Still.  Past…  Present…  Future… You, without hands Bare of emotions.  Are you an ally? An adversary? Or just here to stay?

      One day a young man was standing in the middle  of the town proclaiming that he had the most  beautiful heart in the whole valley.    A large crowd gathered and they all admired his  heart for it was perfect. There was not a mark  or a flaw in it. Yes, they all agreed it truly  was the most beautiful heart they had ever seen.    The young man was very proud and boasted more  loudly about his beautiful heart.    Suddenly, an old man appeared at the front of  the crowd and said "Why your heart is not nearly  as beautiful as mine."    The crowd and the young man looked at the old  man's heart. It was beating strongly, but  full of scars, it had places where pieces had  been removed and other pieces put in, but they  didn't fit quite right and there were several  jagged edges. In fact, in some places there were  deep gouges where whole pieces were missing.    The people stared - how can he say his heart is  more beautiful, they thought? The young man  looked at the old man's heart and saw its  state and laughed. "You must be joking," he  said. "Compare your heart with mine, mine is  perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears."    "Yes," said the old man, "Yours is perfect  looking but I would never trade with you. You  see, every scar represents a person to whom I  have given my love - I tear out a piece of my  heart and give it to them, and often they give  me a piece of their heart which fits into  the empty place in my heart, but because the  pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges,  which I cherish, because they remind me of the  love we shared. Sometimes I have given pieces of  my heart away, and the other person hasn't  returned a piece of his heart to me. These  are the empty gouges -- giving love is taking a  chance.    Although these gouges are painful, they stay  open, reminding me of the love I have for these  people too, and I hope someday they may  return and fill the space I have waiting. So now  do you see what true beauty is?"    The young man stood silently with tears running  down his cheeks. He walked up to the old man,  reached into his perfect young and beautiful  heart, and ripped a piece out. He offered it to  the old man with trembling hands. The old man  took his offering, placed it in his heart and  then took a piece from his old scarred heart and  placed it in the wound in the young man's heart.  It fit, but not perfectly, as there were some  jagged edges. The young man looked at his heart,  not perfect anymore but more beautiful than  ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed  into his. They embraced and walked away side by  side.    How sad it must be to go through life with a  whole untouched heart.

      Eternal goodness, with hearts of light Bringer of truth and justice with might  Slays the demons that wrought havoc and despair To those faithless, hopeless, without care   Unending battle for the undying light Forever vigilant to what is right One day the Spirit will prevail Death to the torments that it entails   The spirit of light resides in us all It is within, the battle in our core Ourselves is the final ground to stand For we are the temple blessed by God's hand   Living temple of God, Masters of creation We are key to the triumph of the Fallen's liberation It's not written but it can be done The fallen as the victor and the salvation of none   Never weary, forever awake Demons of sin exists to desecrate Spirit of light, Sentinels of the temple Defend us, we are weak, be our example   Without the Spirit we are gone Our temporal will amounts to none Just a sweet whisper from the fallen Will sever our line to heaven   Minions of the dark, unseen evil of the world Torments the desecrated with horrors untold Constantly is the time and the struggle for all Ours is the burden, are we destined to fall?

      Did I say platonic? I cannot recall What matters most is the present, not was said before  I was seized by your wit and entangled in your charm Calmed by your words taintless of harm  Your prized presence, attention and thought Like the others from you, I have fervently sought  I thought it was fleeting, your addictive hold on me Waiting for it to pass thinking I’ll be free  I realized that time was not truly potent I have to break my way out from your enchantment  My reason as my sword and my will as my shield I have broken your spell, my quest fulfilled  The final blow that brought my struggles to an end Was the fear of losing you as a dear friend  Did I say platonic? Now I recall What matters most is the present and what will be from now on

      Malamig na hangin kumot sa katawan nitong mandirigma, sahig ang kanlungan.  Nakapikit ang mga mata mga labing nagpipigil ng marahang pagsambit ng libong panalangin.  Pilitin mang matulog diwa ay kusang gigising lilisanin ang panaginip may himig ng uyayi.  Malakas na pag-ungol bakas sa mukha pakikibakang pasakit kalaban ay sino?  Pait ng nakaraan asin sa sugat malaya at sariwa tuluyang naghihingalo.  Impit na pag-iyak hikbing kumakawala gustuhin mang lumimot hapdi ang ala-ala.  Bangungot ang pag-asa iyon ang pamuksa sa katawang pagal sa kaluluwang patay.  Ngunit angkin niya dugong marangal hindi pasusupil anuman ang wakas.  Maliit man ang apoy sa kalungkutan ng gabi ito’y magniningas kasabay ng tala.  Yakap ang tapang siya’y mahihimbing gigising sa umaga sisilay sa araw.    Siya’y mandirigma Dugo ang sandata.

      I was not thinking of Eden or an island ever virgin, neither of a palace in the heavens.  I was not looking at the sun’s rays blinded by brilliance or the glowing boldness.  I was not hearing chimes of yin and yang or classical music.  I was not smelling cocoa on a rainy afternoon seducing the wind.  I was not tasting marshmallows vanilla and vainly sitting on my ice cream.  I was not touching the face of Venus’ perfection; nonchalant to Cupid’s tickle.  When I said I loved you… I was not shouting at the top of my lungs I was not even listening to my voice.    It was only a whisper of a heartbeat that probably got drowned in the ocean of bliss.

      Sometimes, I’d like to die And kiss the day goodbye Sometimes, I’d like to lie down And lay still on the ground.  Sometimes, I’d like to weep Until I fall asleep Sometimes, I’d like to think Until my body sinks.  Sometimes, I’d like to pray That I be happy and gay Sometimes, I’d like to wish That I swim like a fish.  Sometimes, I’d like to live All the things that I believe Sometimes, I’d like to breathe All the things that go shit.  Sometimes, I’d like to start And fade away in the dark Sometimes, I’d like to end And follow how they bend.  Sometimes, I’d like to whisper “Farewell” Sometimes, I’d like to shout “I’m gone.”

      “So this is  Barrio Mapagkumbaba .  Hmmm, I wonder where the party is”, Sophia Spaghetti’ s noodle strands stretched as she tried to peek in at the place.  Bright green, red, blue and yellow triangle-shaped objects danced over the big crowds.  There were people everywhere.  Children came running one after another.  Different sounds filled the air – bells ringing, men laughing and women chatting endlessly.  But the loudest of them all were the trumpets and drums of silver-uniformed men marching.  Leading the parade were ladies in golden dresses gracefully twirling batons and wowing everybody watching.  Sophia Spaghetti knew then that she was to be a big hit in this merry happening.  So she twirled in her thick tomato sauce, showing off her cheesy bits.  “My, I always look best in this velvety red gown.  Everyone will say  bellissima  when they see me – because I am truly beautiful… mmmwah”.  Next thing Sophia Spaghetti knew, she was placed on a very long table covered with a huge banana leaf.  She quickly swirled her slightly misplaced meatballs and looked at her companions. What she saw surprised her.  “Who… what are you!”  Sophia Spaghetti screeched.  The others stared at Sophia Spaghetti for a moment.   Sapin-Sapin  who glowed with her violet, yellow and red colors squealed with delight, “Welcome to our fiesta!”  It was the thin noodles with lots of vegetables, which spoke next.  “Hi, ” she curled up shyly, “I’m  Pasing Pancit Bihon  and I am very pleased to meet you, miss --? ”    “Who is she to ask my name as if she does not recognize me!”  Sophia Spaghetti could only mumble.  Aloud she said, “I am So-phee-ya Spaghetti from the great Pasta family!  So, is this the party?  In this small and dusty place?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  shamefully hid under her cabbage bits and meat chunks.  Her brother  Cardo Pancit Canton , who was short, stout, and yellowish, answered instead, “This is a fiesta!  We give thanks to our patron saint who is very good to us.  And during fiestas, we have banderitas, those colorful triangles that you see hanging around.”   Cardo Pancit Canton  was proud of his town.  Sophia Spaghetti was annoyed because she does not know anything about a fiesta.  “We have none of these foolish things in the big city.  What we have are plenty of colorful and blinking lights – everywhere, every night.”   “Wow, you came from the big city!” cried the white round-shaped  Putos  as they bumped into one another.  “We’ve always wanted to go there,” they went on excitedly.  As she curved to look at them, her noodles gave out a loud swishing.  “Huh, what on earth are you!  You are totally black, like mud!”   Beside the  Putos  was the deep bowl of  Dinuguan , which turned even darker.   Dino Dinuguan  grew sad over the rude remark about his color so he kept silent.      Then Sophia Spaghetti smelled something bad.  “What’s that dreadful odor?  Oh, I can’t bear to be on this table anymore!”  The pot of orange  Kare-Kare  bubbled up in anger, “That is my good friend  Bong Bagoong .  Never judge him by his smell because once you taste him, you will surely like him.  We make a good team.”      “ Mare Kare-Kare , control yourself.  Miss Sophia Spaghetti here is our guest.  We should make her feel at home.”   Bong Bagoong  was not at all offended by how Sophia Spaghetti treated him.  “Let us all introduce ourselves so that she will know us better.”  But before anyone could start, Sophia Spaghetti sneered.  “I bet  Bong Bagoong  and  Dino Dinuguan  will be the champion leftovers here because they are the ugliest!  Shee-hee-hee!”  The others remained quiet but Sophia Spaghetti did not seem to notice.  She continued talking and scoffing at the same time.  “Why do you have such funny names?  But then again, they suit you well because you are all so funny looking.  I bet the visitors won’ t eat you at all. Their stomachs will ache from laughing hard simply by looking at you.” Sophia Spaghetti shook with laughter until her meatballs and cheese scattered.  The roasted pig lying on the middle, the King of every fiesta table, has been observing Sophia Spaghetti.  In all his shining glory, he declared, “A-hoink…A-hoink.  I am the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon .  As everybody know, ” and he looked at the others meaningfully, “it is my duty to restore the peace and order on this table.  Sophia Spaghetti…”  Sophia Spaghetti hastily interrupted and spoke in her most dramatic voice.  “I, the fairest of all noodles – the whitest and firmest of them all – is expected to listen to an old dark-skinned hog like you!  My, why don’t you just nibble on that apple in your mouth.”    The rest got angry.  To disrespect the wise and honorable Judge  Listo  was the last straw.  They all prepared to attack Sophia Spaghetti with their vegetable and meat weapons.  A food fight was about to take place when, like the true leader that he was, Judge  Listo Lechon  shook his head slowly and said, “Now, now, please calm yourselves.  Do not ever forget that we are here for the same reason.  Our duty is to feed the hungry and make everyone happy.”  Sophia Spaghetti, who grew scared at the sight of  Pasing Pancit Bihon  ready to hurl carrot sticks at her, now sighed with relief.  She jeered at the others once again, “Don’t be so jealous.  I’m sure that after they finish eating me, they will turn to you.”  “Sometimes, it’s just so hard to be the best,” she whispered to herself.  Finally, somebody shouted  -- “It’s eating time.”  Sophia Spaghetti felt the heat of excitement.  “Now, these dishes will certainly die of envy,” she snickered.  All the people flocked to the long table.  Each one wanted to taste the dishes served.  All the dishes, on the other hand, desired to be tasted.  Elders and children gathered near  Pasing Pancit Bihon .  Everyone liked her crisp vegetables and delicious chorizos.  Pasing Pancit Biho n was glad that she pleased the guests.    Everyone praised  Cardo Pancit Canton  because he was tasteful with all the large chunks of vegetables, pork, and chicken.   Cardo Pancit Canton  exchanged smiles with his sister.    The combination of  Dinuguan  and  Puto  was naturally a fiesta favorite.  So was the popular pair of  Kare-Kare  and  Bagoong .   And, of course,  Sapin-sapin  was the number one dessert.  Each dish had fun except Sophia Spaghetti.  Nobody had tasted her sweet red sauce or noticed her cheesy dress.  She felt like crying.  She never felt so embarrassed in her entire spaghetti life.  She asked herself, “Why don’t they want to eat me?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  glanced at Sophia Spaghetti and saw that she was sinking in her thick sauce.  She coiled into a smile to cheer her up, “Don’t worry.  They’re going to like you, too.  It’s not everyday that people here see something like you.”  Sophia Spaghetti then felt sad as she realized how vain and proud she was.  She remembered how she mocked  Dino Dinuguan  and  Bong Bagoong .  She was deeply ashamed at the way she looked down on the other dishes as if she was the only one beautiful.  She spoke softly, “I am very sorry.  Please forgive me for being mean.  The honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  was right.  We were made beautiful to give happiness to everybody.”  All the dishes gave Sophia Spaghetti a warm smile.   Bong Bagoong  then  remarked, “Hey, arrange your meatballs and grated cheese now.  Your guests are here.”    Quick little footsteps rushed to the table.  Sophia Spaghetti recognized that one of them was the cute girl who grated cheese for her.  The girl asked her two playmates, “Hey, why don’t you both have spaghetti?  It tastes good.”  One of the playmates answered, “We’re not used to that kind of food.  Is it like pancit?”  The other made a face, “Yuck, is that blood all over?”  The girl urged her playmates, “C’mon, just try it.”  The playmates grabbed forks and scooped up Sophia Spaghetti.  They fell silent for awhile and then exclaimed, “You’re right, it’s delicious – it’s sour-sweet!”   The three children called on their other playmates and relatives to taste the spaghetti.  Everybody loved her.  Sophia Spaghetti was so happy.  She did not even notice that only a few noodle strands were left.  She twisted in a wide grin at the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  and he could only wink in approval.

       One fine summer day, the White Light joins the Dark Glow in a log cabin for a vacation.  They are in the dining room.  With feet on the wooden bench, the Dark Glow seats on the wooden table and watches the television placed on the high shelf beside the kitchen sink.  The White Light comes to Dark Glow.  They start to chat and tell sweet nothings to each other.  They laugh.  The White Light kisses the Dark Glow’s lips but the latter hesitates and just turns back to the television.

       Childhood home...  Relatives from the past...  Present home...  Loved ones of today...     January   To dream of this month,signifies financial gains,a mystery will be solved and beware of a false friend nearby.      HOUSE      Consistent metaphor for the self. Upper floors and rooftops symbolize higher functions, such as consciousness, thinking, and spiritual perspective. Basements and cellars represent subconscious feelings and awarenesses. Large houses with many rooms may be metaphors for extended family lines.   Discovering new rooms in a house-typically a pleasant dream-reflects the rediscovery of "lost" aspects of the self. This dream is common in women who have sacrificed personal hobbies and passions (painting, music, desires to own a small business) for the responsibilities of parenting. It's time to reconnect with your passion!  You drive a car, but typically you LIVE in a house/apartment. Dreams about a HOUSE symbolize a larger aspect of your Self, and the aspects of Self which make the whole. Each room is said to symbolize a different aspect of your Self; for example:    AN ATTIC  symbolizes your Higher Self, and your spiritual development & progress. Look at other symbols in the attic of your dream, and try to evaluate what they mean. Also pay attention to the feeling you experience in your dream...is it pensive, enlightening or what, exactly? All these things are clues for you.    A BATHROOM  would symbolize the need for cleansing/purging/elimination of something in your life that isn't quite working, or that has served it's purpose and now it's time to move on.    A KITCHEN  would symbolize the need or act of supplying nourishment or food for the body/mind/soul...whatever is currently "cooking" or developing in your life. If the food is plentiful, you have what you need. If the cupboard is bare, time to go shopping for new nourishment, and you need to figure out what is needed for that "shopping list."    A DINING ROOM  is similar to the kitchen, but has more to do with immediate needs for supplying & utilizing nourishment, and less with the preparation or taking stock of those needs.    THE MAIN ROOM or LIVING ROOM  symbolizes your daily interactions with others, and often you will have other people appearing in your dreams in this room. Remember, they represent aspects of YOUR Self, and not themselves. (See PEOPLE, above)    BEDROOMS  symbolize the unconscious mind aspect of your Self, rest, dreams, sometimes sexuality issues in your life.    THE UPSTAIRS  symbolizes your spiritual awareness aspect of Self, or the Higher Self that holds all the keys or knowledge to this life's role you are acting out, and always has your higher good looked after, no matter how it might seem otherwise.    THE DOWNSTAIRS/BASEMENT  symbolizes your subconscious mind aspect of Self, which deals with habits, old coping skills, automation, ego. That's usually the part of our Selves that makes us feel "torn" between knowing we should do one thing, but inexplicably ending up doing the opposite. (Don't you HATE that??) Old belief patterns & fears have to be corrected, if that is the case. Tackle & overcome it, and you will feel much more peaceful about your life.    THE GROUND FLOOR  of a house represents your daily agenda; what's currently going on in your life.    REVISITING OLD HOUSES FROM CHILDHOOD OR EARLIER TIMES:  This points to issues that probably are resurfacing in your current life, and need to be looked at, analyzed, and healed so you can move forward and not look back. If you find yourself repeating the same old tired mistakes, or dealing with the same old tired fears, chances are you will have this dream.    A HALLWAY  symbolizes that you have reached an area that is necessary to journey through in order to get to the other side, and it may be a narrow path that has to be traversed with care and awareness. If you have that "closed in, claustrophobic feeling" then you need to expand your awareness/open your mind to more possiblities for completing this phase of your journey.    A  PORCH  symbolizes perhaps a metaphor of being undecided, such as the saying, "I'm still on the porch on that decision."  It could be symbolic of being contemplative, or uncommitted or withdrawn.  It could be something entirely different such as being on the threshold of a new sense or an extension of Self.  It depends on the entire context of the dream.  Back or Front Porch? Screened-in or open?  Messy or neat?  Sparse or furnished?  All these details add to the overall symbolism.    House   Financial security. Happiness within the family. Honor and dignity. Being.    Home   Center of being. Spiritual self. Shelter. Basic need fulfilled. Happiness within the family.    Relatives   Relationship. There are parts of you that feel the need to be acknowledged.    Child or children   Innocence. The new self seeking to develop. Part of self nature is childlike.
