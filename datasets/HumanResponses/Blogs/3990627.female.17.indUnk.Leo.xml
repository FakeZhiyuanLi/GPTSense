      Alone:  A dry breeze is blowing The city is getting cold I wonder how many seasons have passed without even a sound  All of the people coming and going bear heavy burdens, searching for tomorrow within the heat haze wavering in the distance.  Feelings like sand falling through my hands... Back then, the words that pierced my heart suddenly started to throb with pain, but...  I've searched for pieces of myself, counting the endless nights all the while. These feelings are becoming so certain I almost lose myself. Right now, without fail, I will walk forward, however far.  I wonder, why is the sky so vast? Even though I tried to yell, my voice didn't come and the tears poured out.  I wonder where the birds are flying off to, as they freely slice through the wind? One can't return to the same place as it once was in days gone by  Even if I give up my dream like this, I won't suppress my soaring heartbeat. Someday, I want to reach as high as the clouds. [1] I'll spread wide the wings in my heart and journey once again  I will reach it, without fail.  I've searched for pieces of myself, counting the endless nights all the while. These feelings are becoming so certain I almost lose myself. Right now, without fail, I will walk forward, however far.
