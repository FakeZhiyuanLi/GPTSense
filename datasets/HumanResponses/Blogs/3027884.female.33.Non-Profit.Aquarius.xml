      I'm on day three of my house cleaning reformation and I think the program is working to some degree.  It's actually fun to go downstairs in the morning and walk through the livingroom without embedding a child's toy in my foot.  And I love pouring my morning coffee while gazing at my reflection in the shiny, clean sink.  Well, my morning reflection isn't all that to gaze upon, but the clean sink... it's enough to make me think about brushing my teeth before 9 am.  I've made a few discoveries about myself so far on this journey.  I have discovered that I dislike lemon scented furniture polish and prefer instead the old church smell of oil soap.  I have discovered that it takes exactly 52 minutes to dry a load of towels.  I've also discovered that my fridge is an evolution acceleration chamber.  Things go in there mere vegetables, but after several months have passed, they come out sentient beings.  I had a conversation the other day with a 9 month old carrot who sounded astonishingly like George W. Bush.  It kept saying something about weapons of mass destruction hidden in the meat drawer.  But when I looked, all I found was a half eaten bologna sandwich trying to date a two year old cheese stick with a PhD.  It's a wild, wild world in there.  Most importantly, however, this journey into the realm of order and organization has brought about self-discovery.  I have determined that I am a lazy perfectionist with a mean obsessive-compulsive streak thrown in for color.  Let me explain.    Basically, it is in my nature to have a clean, perfect house.  When I mean perfect, I mean Better Homes and Gardens' cover perfect.  But who can accomplish that with two kids, two dogs, a late working husband and only 24 hours in a day?  Well, I mean besides my friend and fellow mom, Amy.  Her house is so clean you could lick her carpet and come away without even a single fuzzy on your tongue.  Her house screams "clean."  I've never actually been there to see it for myself, but I hear it screaming "clean" in the background when I call her.  While we chat, Amy usually scrubs her floors.  On the other hand, I play hamper hoops with dirty socks or pull dog hair out of the baby's mouth.  But the reason I act like this is because of my perfectionist nature.  If I do it, I  want it to be perfect.  But I don't want to work that hard because I'm lazy.  So, I do nothing.  Today is a perfect example.  I was told by the almighty to do list that I was to vacuum the upstairs bedrooms, loft, and hallways.  In order to do this, thinks I, all toys, books, clothes, the occasional mixing bowl and grapefruit spoon and the rest of the miscellany cluttering the floor must be picked up and put away.  I did this for over an hour and then looked into my daughter's room. The place looked as if it were an airsick bag for a Toys R Us on a turbulent flight.   Toys and clothes intertwined with books and bedding.  Had I picked it all up so I could vacuum, it would have taken me the remainder of the day.  I couldn't do that since I had promised Reilly Kate I would take her to the pool.  Now, I can't go back on a promise like that, can I?    My natural inclination was to scrap the vacuuming idea altogether.  I do this kind of scrapping often, in fact.  If there is just too much to do to make the job perfect, I scrap it.  This is why with two shedding dogs, my Berber carpet feels more like a dog skin rug.  I can actually pet my carpet.  My daughter offers it milkbones.  It either needs to be vacuumed or sent to the groomer.  And so, I took one more look at my ever present to do list and vacuumed around all the junk.  I just made a path to her bed and hoovered that.  Then I hoovered all the other rooms that I had already picked up.    My upstairs is so much cleaner now.  No, not perfect.  But cleaner.  I feel better despite the episode still playing in my mind obsessively.  I still want to go in and pick up her room then hoover what remains in there.  But at 11:30 pm, I'm sure to wake her.  I guess I'll just take a nice cleansing breath and go downstairs to talk quantum physics with the eggplant living in the crisper.

      I started a new house cleaning program.  One that is guaranteed to  easily  move me from clutter and chaos to organization of my time, home, and life.  Easily, huh?  The program is outlined in a book entitled, "Sidetracked Home Executives" written by the self proclaimed "slob sisters."     I've read the book.  Cover to cover.  I've implemented their ideas with a computer program that will tell me daily what my chores are.  Everything from making the bed to cleaning the oven is plugged into my program.  Nothing is too mundane or habitual for my glorified to do list, let me tell ya.  It all but tells me when to take a potty break and which bathroom to use.  My day begins at 6:20 am with the two year old bounding into my room with literally an arm load of toys.  She dumps half the contents of her toy box on my bedroom floor and joins me and her brother in bed.  Fortunately, Roman is already awake and squeals with delight at the sight of his beloved sister.  I get out of bed and find the floor cluttered with the toys she's strewn all around.  I clear a path for myself to the bathroom, where I put my to do list the night before.  As if I'm a gypsy fortune teller, I see my entire day laid out before me.  In plain black and white, inkjet ink.  First on the list: situps (it's either do 'em or look forever 5 months pregnant).  I'm mid crunch when it hits me... or rather  she  hits me.  Full force.  All her weight.  Onto my crunched, flabby baby belly.  Ugh, that hurt.  "I love you, Mom," says Reilly obviously craving attention at an early hour.  "I love you, too, Mom," she replies to herself (or was that to me she was replying?).  "And I love brother and I love Daddy and I love GG and Papa..."  She doesn't quit talking again until 7:04 pm when she falls sound asleep in my arms.  For those of you keeping track, that's over 12 straight hours of nonstop, ceaseless talking.  I have so much two year old running around in my brain that I'm starting to develop a crush on Bob the Builder.  Can he fix me?  Yes, he can!  By 7:45 am I had made Reilly's breakfast, changed the baby's diaper twice, run a mile and a half, planned our dinner menu, and was in the midst of doing two loads of laundry.  And I hadn't even made a dent in that damn to do list.    According the reformed slob sisters, to succeed in this cleaner, more organized and time efficient lifestyle, one must finish the to do list before leaving the house.  If I were to keep to this rule, I might never leave the house again. I would be a prisoner of my warden -- the to do list.  So if days go by and you haven't seen me, you know I'm trapped inside with two small offspring and a sheet of paper ordering me around.  On the list was instructions to clean the bathroom and sweep and mop the whole downstairs.  This would take a normal person about 20 minutes at the most.  But I am not normal.  Neither are my children.  I set about my tasks, however, neglecting this fact.    I was about five minutes into my sweeping when Reilly takes a tennis ball from Truman (our miniature dachshund) and shoves it into a slot in Roman's exersaucer.  I look over and poor Tru is up on his hind legs with his long snout pushed into a plastic toy barn attached to the exersaucer.  He is trying to pull the ball out but he's only managed to get it wedged into the barn loft.  Roman thinks this is high comedy and giggles to show his approval.    Reilly Kate has moved on to better things at this point. She is now running the length of our couch and leaping from the arm rest of the couch onto our rocking recliner.  Run run run... leap... Land!!!  And each time she lands she says, "Be careful, Mom.  Be careful!  Just be careful."  What the heck to I have to be careful about?  I keep my distance from her just to be safe.  She seems to know what she's doing.  I don't interfere.  To finish the floor with interruptions like this every five minutes or so, it takes me three hours.  It's 11 am before I'm done with the floor and on to the bathroom.  This is a little powder room off of our living room.  It shouldn't take more than ten minutes.  And it wouldn't have, if I hadn't let the dogs outside.  We live in a fairly new house and the grass in our yard hasn't fully grown in yet.  It can get pretty muddy out there.  But I didn't pay attention and I let the dogs back in without washing their feet first.  All over my newly washed floor were bright red, Hawaiian mud prints.  I get out my trusty mop (the one I had become so attached to earlier in the morning) and damp mopped the spots up.  I also stain treat the carpet.  Not, of course, before I get out a bowl and stoop down to wash each dog's foot.  If you would have told me five years ago that I would be crouched down with a bowl of warm soapy water washing the feet of two mangy mongrels, I would have told you that George W was gonna be president, too.  I  must  be a gypsy psychic.  By the time I get back to the bathroom, Reilly has already used her little potty and was swishing the pee around in the bowl before pouring it into the big potty.  The pee went spinning out of the bowl and all over the bathroom.  Fortunately, I wasn't completely done with the bathroom so I didn't feel like it was a total loss.  Just a setback.  Minor setback at that.  The day progressed like that.  Two steps forward, one and a half steps back.  I finally finished my to do list at 9:30 this evening.  All but one thing:  Pick up trash by the computer.  I wonder, does that "trash" include tomorrow's to do list?

      We went to the beach today.  Beach days are always fun.  Well, after you discount the fact that I have to put my big, flabby postpartum ass in a suit and then be surrounded by firm bods of steel attached to 18 year old, wrinkle-free faces.  Blech.  Oh, and you have to discount too the nagging fear of getting a clogged duct from smashing my enormous 40-I cup breasts into a tight bathing suit designed to perk me up a bit.  And the nursing on the beach.  That's always a bummer.  What with the sand and the salt water and the beach towel blowing off my shoulder revealing to all those bods of steel my mama juice udders.    But it was fun.  Fun for the two year old.  She had a blast.  The poor baby got the short end of the stick.  I forgot to pack his UV protection suit.  My kids are like their daddy in that they are the whitest people you've ever seen.  They really are in the wrong geographic area for their skin tone.  People that fair should never venture farther south than Dubuque, Iowa.  Not only for their skin's protection, but for the occular protection of others.  That white skin really glares in the hot, hot sun.  If you're not prepared for my husband to take his shirt off and you look directly at him, you could burn out a retina.  No kidding.  Anyway, so the baby didn't have his suit and I had to slather him top to bottom with an SPF50 and then keep him covered by towels and hats and the like.  He was hot and cranky.  I actually brought a little sun tent with us.  My mom gave it to us for the kids.  I took it out of its little carrying bag and instantly the thing sprang open.  At that very instant a nice gust of trade wind swooped upon us and the damn tent took flight.  I had to run after it to catch it.  Me.  In a bathing suit.  Running.  This was no Bay Watch scene.  Trust me.  In fact, all I could hear in my head was that Jello commercial "Watch it wiggle.  See it jiggle."    After several feeble attempts at getting the tent to stay put and serve its purpose, I resigned myself to holding it in place.  This lasted till Mike and Reilly came up out of the water and Mike took over the holding duties as I attempted to nurse the baby.  In Mike's words, we looked like "The Swiss Family Losers."      Reilly Kate had a blast, though.  She really dug the sand.  In fact, she discovered she likes to eat sand, throw it at others, and even dump whole buckets of it in her own face.  Sand.  I am quite certain I will be brushing it out of her hair for weeks.  Perhaps we might even have enough to make our own beach, in the back yard.  Minus, of course, the bods of steel.

      Nobody tells you motherhood is going to be this hard.  Nobody.  You hear about the sleepless nights and the stretchmarks, the "terrible twos" and teenager hell.  But it is always counter balanced by some amazingly drippy drivel about children being the light in what was previously a very dark and gloomy life.    I'll tell you right now, my children absolutely ARE the light of my life.  They are the most precious things I have ever been blessed to behold.  The love I feel for them is overpowering.  There are times, when I watch them sleeping peacefully after a full day, I can hardly believe such beauty has touched my life.  But I'm here to tell you right now, let there be no question, motherhood is DAMN hard work.  I've never worked so hard before and I doubt I ever will.  Those that claim otherwise are either childless, brainless, or memory-less.  Most older women I know are the latter.  I was walking through the commissary the other day and a woman came up to me and said, "Oh, your children are so cute.  I miss when my kids were that little.  My kids are off in college now."  My reply took her off guard.  I said, "I cannot wait for the day when I miss my kids being this little."  She was shocked, almost horrified that I would say something like that.  She walked off to check the ripeness of pineapple muttering, "You need to appreciate all those little cuddles.  They'll be too old to cuddle before you know it."  The thing is, I'm sure she's right.  They will be too old to cuddle before I know it.  I will look at them while they are sleeping and wonder where my babies went.  I already have that twinge of longing when Reilly Kate pushes me away to go and play with her friends.  And she is only two!    Yet, what that lady is forgetting, what we all forget as our children get older and more independent of us, is how hard it is, how much work it is, how much stress it is to be solely responsible for little ones too young to do a thing for themselves.  Quite frankly, it is probably the hardest job in the world.  You are constantly "on."  There is never a coffee break, let alone a decent night's sleep.  I cannot even remember the last time I was able to go the bathroom alone.  I shower now with the curtain open.  I cannot wait for a chance to go get away for an hour, but as soon as I am, all I can think of is "my babies" and then I rush home to get back to them.  It's like having the most stressful job with driven, sometimes difficult bosses.  All week long all you think of is the weekend.  If you could just get away, you think, then you could relax and recharge.  If you could only have a vacation, then you'd come back to your job with renewed energy.  Then on the weekend, all you can think of is getting back to work.  Only this is worse.  You love your bosses more than anything.  Your bosses are like the air you breathe.  You need them.  They need you.  A perfect match made in... HOMEMAKER HELL!!!  Saying stuff like this is very unpopular.  I remember once when Reilly was about 8 months old, Oprah did a show on it.  The whole show was dedicated to how difficult being a mother is.  There were many women on that show from all walks of life, all saying the same thing:  This is stinking' hard.  Each had her own story of woe.  While they all agreed that they loved their children and would never trade them in (who is willing to do a trade for kids anyway?  Could I, say, trade my kids in for a new car or something?), they still needed to let people know how very, very hard it is.  Something no one ever told them.  The negative response from viewers, men and women alike, was enough to warrant a second show.  A few weeks later they brought both sides together on the show.  I was shocked to hear how many older women were really angry with the younger moms for revealing the god awful truth about motherhood.  It was as if they were all June Cleaver and never had a bad day when their children were small.  The looked at the young mothers with dumbfounded looks on their faces.  Just could literally not understand what was so hard about motherhood.  Anyone who reads about my typical days around here knows exactly what I find so hard.  And I know I'm not alone.  Today I spent a great deal of time comforting, consoling, sharing, and supporting some fellow mother friends.  No two are alike in circumstance or personality and yet they all shared the same story.  Motherhood is hard.  It is isolating.  It is overwhelming.  There is a loss of self:  self worth, self esteem, physical self, spiritual self, emotional self.  All the while you are losing these, you are expected to do it with a smile, a clean house, and flat tummy.    There is a lot of judgment on mothers today.  More so than any generation before us.  It is not something that our mothers shared or will ever understand.  Back when I was an infant, formula was encouraged which took a lot of pressure off the new mom.  If a two week old wasn't sleeping through the night, you gave them some rice cereal.  If that didn't work, it was suggested you let them cry it out, "it stretches their lungs."  Napping was vital and television a good, educational babysitter.  There were no carseats to research, buy, and install.  Inoculations weren't questioned.  Cheese in a can was modern food, packed full of enriched nutrients.  Anyone remember Tang?  The modern new mother is breastfeeding her baby every two to three hours or more if the baby is fussy while squeezing fresh oranges in a juicer and making breastmilk yogurt for her toddler.  We don't let our babies wail in the bassinet.  We strap them to our bodies and "wear" them the way Dr. Sears told us to.  The television is monitored and controlled and when it is employed as a babysitter is the source of massive amounts of heavy laden guilt.  There are playdates and baby school, toddler dance class and gymnastics, Kindermusik, Gymboree, and the all important midday Le Leche League meetings.  All of which involve the necessary car rides in car seats which need to buckled up and unbuckled and buckled back up (it takes me ten minutes just to run into Blockbuster to return movies).  There's no time for naps.  Naps are done in the carseats while driving to the next activity.    It's different world today.  It'll be a different world tomorrow.  I just hope that when my daughter has children, she is well prepared for it to be this hard.  I hope I don't forget.  I have my video camera on a lot, trying to capture the difficult times as much as the fun times.  I want to remember all the times.    I want to long for a time when my kids were this little.  I want to long for a time when sleep wasn't an option.  I want to play those videos and long for the days.  But right now, those days are really, really LONG.

      I love to talk.  Talking is my game.  And there is no one I like better to talk with than a fellow talker.  The more you talk, the more I talk, the more we talk together.  It's a love fest.  But, my daughter takes talking to a whole new level.  The child does not shut up.  Not even for a minute.  Let alone five.  When I beg her to shut her trap for just a few minutes, just to relieve the pressure, just for a few, blissfully silent minutes, I am treated to a mouth noise similar to high pitched trills of Arab women in celebration.  She can keep this up for about three minutes before she then has to go back to the spoken word.    This ceaseless talking begins before the break of dawn.  Take this morning for example.  At precisely 5:49 am I hear her tramping through my room saying, "It's morning.  I'm aWAKE!!! [with the stress on the 'WAKE' part, of course] Still dark outside.  Mama, wake UP.  Mama, wake UP.  Where's my book?  I wanna read my book.  Wake UP!!!"  With only one eye opened halfway, I groan out to her, "Still dark means still sleep.  Come in here and go to sleep."  "I'm not sleeping. I'm aWAKE!!!  I want my book.  I want to see brother. Where is brother.  Touch him.  Touch him."  Now, this is serious.  There should be no touching of the baby prior to seven o'clock in the morning.  He needs to sleep.  And if I am going to be forced awake while it is still dark outside, I'll be damned if I'm going to be awake and juggling a cranky, woke-up-too-soon, four month old.  I intervene quickly just before she is about to lay on top of him.  "Here!!!  Your book is here!!!"  I reach for the book left on the night stand and hand it to her.  "Please read it  quietly . Do not talk.  Do not wake your brother.  It is still sleeping time."  And then my eyes slammed shut.    If only ears had lids.  And why the hell don't they?  Perhaps not all people need lids on their ears, but by God MOTHERS do.  They should magically appear after your first child is born.  Kind of like that flap that used to be your abdomen just suddenly appears after you give birth.  A belly flap is useless.  But ear lids... that would be heaven.  Anyway, no sooner did my eyes slam shut then the baby starts screaming out in pain.  Reilly has dropped the book on his head while he was sleeping.  Not only is he awake, but now he is hurt and pretty pissed off about it.  I reach out to move the book and soothe his aching head.  "I'm sorry Brother.  Brother, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I dropped the book.  I'm sorry. It's an accident.  Accident."  Sure, she's apologetic now.  It gives her something else to talk about.  But now I'm mad and tired and cranky and a bit hungry (postpartum dieting, ya know) and in my sternest not-even-6am-tone tell her to go back to her room.    As she sadly drags her feet back to her room, I feel a twinge of guilt.  She is still talking, apologizing profusely.  And talking about her book, it's whereabouts her main concern.  Her cute pink jammies and her ringlets of red were too much for my soft, mushy heart.  I tell her not to go. It  was   afterall an accident and I shouldn't have been upset with her.  Just as she is about to exit the doorway, she turns back, reaches out to the light switch and out from the ceiling pours the most blinding light I've ever seen.  "Read my book to me?" she asks.  "I wanna read my book.  I turned the lights on to read my book.  I hit brother with the book.  It is an accident.  I'm sorry brother.  Read my book now, Mama?"  I beg her to turn the light off.  "Brother is trying to sleep."  "No, Mama, Brother's awake.  He's aWAKE."  And with that she crawls into bed and lies on top of him, her entire two year old body on his slight four month old frame.  Over her shoulder, through her locks of bed head, I see his big toothless grin beaming ear to flapless ear with love and adoration.    "Yep.  He's awake now.  Brother certainly is awake."  With that, I climbed out of bed and we began our day... even though it was still dark outside.

      Grocery shopping has become a weekly chore.  I hate it.  I absolutely hate it.  I used to love to grocery shop.  Aisles and aisles of food.  Recipes swirling through my head.  Coupons neatly cut and sorted.  Dewy fruits and vegetables enticing me in the produce section.  Juicy thick steaks calling my name.  Chocolate.  Loaves of fresh baked bread screaming for butter which I would gladly add to my cart.  Oh, and the cleaning supplies aisle.  That was my favorite.  I am a god awful housekeeper, but I have every single cleaning solution ever invented.  In fact, I have three boxes of Swiffer pads and yet my floors haven't been mopped in well over a month.  I used to spend a half hour dwelling amongst the cleaners each time I went to the store.  Not anymore, though.  Now, I hate the grocery store.  It is all about zipping in and out of lanes as quickly as my little feet can carry my big load.  It is finding a place to nurse the baby and sitting next to a retired Drill sergeant none too keen on the advantages of breastfeeding.  It's finding that happy medium between keeping the toddler happy with fruity snacks and lollipops and having her so sugared up she leaps out of the cart and rampages through the store shrieking, "Captain Crunch.  Captain Crunch.  Where are you, my Captain Crunch?"   It's all about multi-tasking and I suck at multi-tasking.  When I multi-task the dogs get oil changes, the minivan gets a flu shot, and the I drop the kids off at the groomers.   Hence, grocery shopping as become a weekend chore to be done with my husband.  He  can  be a great help.  When he is in the mood.  Today he rocked.  We picked up a few things here and there, all the while he entertained the toddler and cooed at the baby.  We were in and out and ready to go home in a little over a half an hour.  Before our long car ride home, I wanted Reilly Kate to go potty.  She  was  potty trained.  But when the baby was born, she backslid severely.  We are now back to the train ing .  So off we go, Reilly Kate, Mama, and baby brother.  We get in and I get Reilly on the toilet.  As we are awaiting the poo poo she assures me is on its way out, she is rambling about the benefits of going poo poo on the potty.  "I go to school.  I get M&Ms.  I get MONIES!!!  Gimme monies, please.  Monies, Mama...."  On and on she rambles;  when she'll stop, nobody knows.  As she announced the arrival of her poop, she began gesticulating excitedly and out of her hand flew a Lego piece that she had been holding onto all day.  Wouldn't you know, that damn thing flew all the way over the wall and into the stall next to us.  This is my luck.  This is how things go for me.  Immediately, Reilly Kate begins asking about her toy's whereabouts.  "What happened to my toy?  Where is it?"  I told her it was in the stall next to us and then she demanded, "Get it.  Get it, please, Mama."    What exactly is the protocol on something like that?  I mean, do you knock on the dividing wall and say, "Excuse me.  Could you had me that toy that landed on the dirty floor behind the toilet you are sitting on?  My two year old is in desperate need of it."  Do you wait until the person is finished with the stall and then hop in and retrieve the toy?  Or do you simply leave the toy there?  This isn't the kind of thing that is addressed in Miss Manners column, although I think that things of this nature should be.  It would make life a lot less stressful for the likes of me.  Since Reilly was getting really worked up about her toy, I decided to knock softly and ask politely about the toy.  But the woman in the stall next to us was obviously doing some serious business in there and wasn't interested in through-the-wall conversation.  I knocked, but heard nothing in return.  I decided the best thing was to wait.    Reilly, however, didn't agree with my decision.  After I got her off the toilet, she bent over and proceeded to duck under the stall to retrieve her toy herself.  I had to drag her back and try to explain to her that we needed to wait.  Two year olds just don't think privacy is of any importance when in the bathroom.    Then as we are exiting our stall, a woman who was waiting to use the toilet, steps forward and Reilly Kate storms up to her and in a very accusatory tone of voice asks, "Where is my toy?  Where is it?  Where is my toy, lady?"  The woman, fortunately, thinks Reilly is a doll and doesn't take offense.  Really, who can resist a curly haired, red head with pink bows and a flowered dress accusing you of stealing a treasured blue Lego?   I tried to explain to Reilly that this was the wrong lady, that the toy was still in the stall, and that we had to wait.  She wasn't having any of it.  "Get my toy, please."  The woman laughed and went into our stall, closing the door.   "No, no.  The toy is in here, Reilly."  And I pointed.  Then, as I tried to get Reilly to come wash her hands, she began knocking on the door.  "Where's my toy?  Where's my toy?"  Knock, knock, knock.  And with that, out of her other hand flew the teddy bear she had also been dragging around all day.  The bear did a nose dive right into the sink, bounced and landed in the trash bin.    Now, I am digging in piles of damp, used paper towels, searching for her bear to the whine of Reilly Kate chanting, "Where's my bear?  Where's my toy?  Get it.  Where's my bear?  Mama gets it.  Where's my toy?  Lady has my toy."  Over and over and over.  Then the door opened and out came a little old Japanese lady.  Reilly went running up to her and again demanded, "Where's my toy?"  The lady looked at her, smiled and patted her on the head, saying, "How are you?  I am fine."  Reilly repeated her question, "Where's my toy?"  To which the little old Japanese lady repeated hers, "How are you?  I am fine."  She apparently spoke no English.  As these two were engaged in what one would think to be riveting dialogue, I went crawling into the stall to retrieve the toy.  After giving the Lego a good lick and a promise washing, I grabbed Reilly with one hand and the stroller with the other and out of the bathroom we went.  Of course, Reilly was now saying, "I got my toy.  Mama got my toy for me.  I got toy."  And the little old Japanese lady was right behind us saying, "How are you?  I am fine."  Ya know the best part of that trip the bathroom?  The baby didn't cry once.  Reilly went poo poo and the baby didn't cry.  Success.  The shopping trip, however, wasn't such a success.  I forgot to get carpet cleaner.  Actually, I didn't even walk down the cleaning supplies aisle.  To hell with it.  I probably wouldn't have cleaned my carpet anyway.

      Last night I attempted to sleep smashed in between two very small children who seem to take up three quarters of a queen sized bed.  "Attempted" would be the key word in that sentence.  And my king-sized husband slept on about three inches of space on the very edge of the bed.  Poor guy.  Yet he did in fact sleep.  His snoring added to my insomnia.  The worst part of the night was being hit in the face with my own boobs.  Yep.  That's right.  You read it.  I said it.  I get hit in the face with my very own mammary glands.  They are just that big and out of control.  Imagine it for yourself:  Sleeping with hardly any wiggle room.  You don't want to move a slumbering child for fear of awakening their inner beast.  So you just inch a little to your right and ::WHAM:: the left boob hits you square in the face.  It's not pleasant.   After this happened several times, I started thinking of a nice comfortable sleeping bra that wouldn't clog my ducts but would be gently supportive.  And breathable.  A brushed cotton, perhaps.  Heaven, thinks I.  But at a price.  A high price.  Bras in my size (a 40-I cup) don't come cheap.  They range between $35 and $80 and must be ordered online.  It's a serious, royal pain in the ass.  Then the thought hit me.  No, I am not thinking of making my own bras.  I'm thinking that bras and the like should be tax deductible for me.  My occupation is lactator, right?  Okay.  I'm a mother.  But a big part of my role as mother is lactator.  So just like an astronomer can deduct his telescope from his taxes, so should I be able to deduct my bras from my taxes.  And the cost difference between a queen sized bed and a king sized bed.  That should be tax deductible.  And nursing shirts (which, if you don't know, cost twice as much as normal shirts -- why?  It's a conspiracy between the textile workers and the formula makers, I'm quite sure).  And chocolate.   Yep. All this should be tax deductible.    I just hope that I get a better night's sleep tonight.  Brainstorms like that can really take a lot out of a person.  Especially a lactator.  With the breastmilk goes one's brain cells.  This is fact.  Ya see, DHA is a fatty acid that helps build and maintain one's brain.  Breastmilk is high in DHA.  So if a lot of DHA is leaving my body, but I'm not taking more in, I must be losing brain cells.  My kids are making me dense.  That too should be a tax deduction.  Moooo...

      Everyone keeps telling me that I should start a blog.  So tonight, blurry eyed and half asleep, I signed up.  And here it is.  I haven't a thing to type for today.  We stayed home.  No misadventure there.  Although...  ...there was the lunch incident.  Reilly Kate, my darling 27 month old daughter, and I were eating lunch.  With a very thoughtful look on her face, she places her fork down next to her plate and folds up her napkin.  She then looks at me and says, "What the f*%k, Mom?  What the f#*k?"  I told her that she is not allowed to say that.  Only Mama and Daddy can say that to which she replies, "I'm saying it for you."  And with that she pees her panties, picks up her fork, and continues eating.  What the f&%k, indeed, Reilly Kate.

      My kids are breatharians.   urlLink Breatharians  don't believe in eating.  They think that they can exist on nothing but some kind of light they derive from air.  Hence the name: breatharians.  I'm quite certain my kids know nothing about this light from air business, but I'm just as sure that they are practicing this form of nourishing oneself.  How else would I explain the amount of poop exiting two bodies that nothing but air enters?  Tonight, I tried to employ the old reverse psychology technique recommended by my friend Dana to get Reilly to eat some broccoli.  The trick, according to Dana, is to get the toddler to think that broccoli is something special, not to be had by the toddler.  Liken it to candy even.  I made a big to-do about the broccoli.  I talked out loud to myself as I washed and cut it.    "Mmmm... I love this stuff.  Broccoli is so good.  I like it almost as much as I like chocolate.  Yum.  I can't wait to eat this."  I was smacking my lips and licking my chops.  Even I knew this technique would not work without a healthy, or rather UNhealthy dose of good, old fashioned, full fat, homemade ranch dressing.  I put out a big bowl of the artery clogging concoction on the coffee table, where we munch snacks while watching Animal Planet.  "Don't touch this," I warned.  "This is for Mama only.  You can have some cheese and crackers while I eat this with my broccoli.  Don't touch it, please."  She didn't even look up from her beloved Crocodile Hunter (pronounced "crock-a-doddle" for those of you who don't know).  Steve was in the midst of getting bitten by a snake and Reilly Kate was enthralled.  "Hmmm... I can't decide if I want some chocolate or some broccoli.  I think I will have the broccoli.  You can't have it, though.  It's not for you.  You just eat crackers."   Still I got no response.  I sat down with a plate of broccoli, artistically presented in a pattern somewhat reminiscent of a star, and started noisily munching with the ranch as dip.  I was quite dramatic with my slurping and crunching and yummy yummy noises.  "I know you shouldn't have this till you are at least six.  But today is a special day.  It won't hurt if you have just a little.  Would you like --"  "NO!!!" She didn't even let me finish.  I was cut off before I could even finish making my case.  Not to be deterred, I forged on.   "Just as well.  It's not good for you anyway.  I just thought a little bite wouldn't really --"  "No!!!"  She interrupted again.  "I can't like that at all."  She gets her "can'ts" and "don'ts" and "won'ts" mixed up.  "I can't like that rrrrrrrright NOW!!!!"    She has picked up some of my speech habits.  I use "right now" quite often apparently.  As in "Come here right now," and "Put that down right now," and "We're leaving right now."  It gets reflected back to me and with the same tone of voice as well.  It's not flattering, let me tell you.  "Just try a little piece.  It's better than chocolate.  Much better.  Mmmmm..." I slowly wilting like a salad gone bad.  My ranch dressing ploy wasn't even working.  She had now put me on "ignore."  I sat silently crunching broccoli florets with ranch dressing as I contemplated my next move.  I waited till a commercial break and then I went and got her Easter candy off the kitchen counter and sat it down next to me.  "I'll tell you what," I was about to make a deal with my two year old, "You eat a few bites of this broccoli and you can have a piece of your chocolate."  Her little ears perked up.  I had gotten her attention.  "If not, I'll eat all the broccoli AND all the chocolate."  And to prove I was serious, I popped a ranch drenched floret in my mouth along with a fat chunk of chocolate Easter bunny ear.  I clenched my lips into what I hoped looked like a deliriously happy smile rather than the repulsed sour puss the combination was eliciting.  Reilly Kate leaned over me, picked up two big broccoli pieces, dredged them through the ranch dressing bowl and held them up in front of her face.  Before I could even suggest she take smaller, bite sized pieces, she shoved them both in her mouth. She chewed and chewed as I sat and fretted over the choking possibilities posed by that large an amount of roughage.  When she finished chewing, she turned to me and announced, "I did! Chocolate now, please.  May I please have my chocolate right now.  Rrrrriiiight NOW!!!"  "One more piece and then you can have some chocolate."  I was still wheeling and dealing, so I thought.  I extended a much smaller, toddler sized piece to her.  She again soaked it in the ranch and popped it in her mouth.  She chewed this piece for a much longer time.    "Isn't it good?" I asked as I crunched on some myself.  "Isn't it as good as chocolate?"  "Mmmm hmmmm," she agreed.  "You can't have too much, though.  It's for Mama."  I was still playing my game even if she didn't want to go along.  "Mmmmm hmmmmm," she nodded and began looking at her Easter basket.  "You want your chocolate now, huh?"  I needlessly asked and dug to find a nice small chocolate egg.  "Mmmm hmmm."  I handed her the chocolate and she merrily skipped away toward the kitchen.  I sat and watched Steve handle another snake on television while I grabbed some more of the green stuff.  I too was engrossed as I watched that crazy Crockadoddle Hunter take on a spitting cobra.  It was making my palms sweat.  Just as the cobra started hooding up to take a swipe at Steve, I hear the sinful sound of a toddler's delighted giggles coming from my kitchen.  I get up to take a look and this is what I see:  Reilly hunched over, as if she were puking, spitting out globules of gooey green sludge onto the floor where the awaiting Truman (our perpetually dieting dachshund) eagerly lapped them up.  It would seem that she hid the chewed up broccoli in her cheeks, fooling me with her bright smile and the "Mmmm hmmm."  I started to say something, but before I could even formulate a response, Reilly spat out all that was remaining in her mouth and shoveled in the chocolate.  Score one for the toddler.  She won that round. But I'll get her.  I'll get her tomorrow.  I'll fool her into eating eggs.  I'm going to hide them in a chocolate cake.  I have a recipe that calls for four large ones.  Roman's food refusal story tomorrow...

      Mike is off to Korea for 10 days.  He leaves tomorrow.  So I'm spending time with him before he goes.  I'll be back to regular blogging soon.  Till then, enjoy this one. I actually realized I should be doing a blog when I typed this one up.   I wrote it March 3, 2004 (I think)  Yesterday was another one of Heather's Days.  I'm thinking maybe this is my life plan.  To have shitty days and write them out for the entertainment of others.  So yesterday.  Got up.  Breakfasted without incident (RK fell back in love with french toast which thrilled me to no end) except I still have a fussy baby.  But that is nothing really.  Oh, and the ants.  The gnats are gone from all the rain.  But the ants have taken their place.  I got up and the counter was covered with them.  Thousands and thousands of little black ants.   They whole counter.  They had a highway built across the kitchen floor from the sliding glass door to the dogs’ food to the counter.  I’d call Terminex, but last time they came, they told me that I didn’t have a pest problem.  I was my own problem.  According to the guy they sent, I need to get rid of my dogs and my kids and all the stuff in my garage and then I wouldn’t have any bugs at all.  In his exact words, “I can spray all day long, but it is your lifestyle that causes your bug problems.”  Instead I put out those ant traps that they love so much.  I think they thrive on the stuff they put in them.  I had some phone errands to do.  So at about 8am I started on the phone.  I called the Cook County Clerk's Office about getting my absentee ballot sent to me via email.  I had checked the website and it had a whole page dedicated to military and how they will send you a ballot via email.  Look for yourself.    http://www.voterinfonet.com/sub/absentee_overseas_military.asp  The woman on the phone flat out said, "No."  What? What do you mean, "No?"  I don't get it.  The website says that you can.  "No."  I read directly off the site to this woman whose answer is... "No."  I read again.  "No."   I then talk to the supervisor who tells me that they have never done it that way.  They cannot do it that way.  And she cannot figure out how I would ever think that.  When I again read her the website she just says, "Well, it's wrong."  The bottom line is that military gets no easier way to vote than any other absentee.  Fine. I now have to fill out an APPLICATION  for a ballot and return that and then they'll send me the ballot.  This all needs to be completed by the 15th of March which means we'll be overnighting two applications and two ballots for a total of 60 bucks.  60 freakin' buck to fucking vote!!!  And then I still don't know if it'll get counted since it is cutting it so close.  That is of course easier than last year, though.  Last year I had to fill out an application for an application for a ballot.  Go figure that one.  I get off the phone and hear RK yelling, "Poo poo on the foot!!!  Poo poo on the foot!!!"  I go running to see whose foot and whose poo poo and find it to be Truman's poop on RK's foot.  It's all over the downstairs.  And Truman's long haired ass.  I decided to cut the poop and hair out.  He's got to go the groomer this week and get a chop chop.  More on this later.  But I get the poop cleaned up from all offending areas.  Then I called my house's builder.  You see, my driveway isn't flush to the asphalt so every time it rains, about an inch and a half of mud collects where the driveway meets the street.  Additionally, the driveway concrete is crumbling into little stones.  But my main point of calling was because the kick plate to my fridge has never been delivered.  They keep trying to tell me that the fridge doesn't come with a kick plate; that the motor is supposed to be exposed on the bottom of the fridge.  Dumbasses.  Anyway, I call and my customer care guy (Scott) is supposedly out of the office.  The woman I am talking, however, seems to have a bad case of the giggles.    Me:  My driveway needs to be run done. Her:  [giggles] Yes? Me:  The cement is crumbling. Her:  [giggles] Oh, that's bad.  [giggles]   Then I tell her about the fridge and this is high comedy to her.  It has gone from giggles to all out laughter. I finally ask again if Scott is there and she says, "Scott? No, he's not here."  Huh.  Okay.  Fine.  I move down my list of to dos.  The library.  I received two notices from them while I was on the mainland.  One for the book I ordered from another library.  It seems that it came in while I was out of town and since I wasn't there to pick it up, I must pay some kind of a fine.  The other notice is for that damn DVD The Land Before Time.  They claim I never turned it back in.   So I call.  They are not open until 1pm.  I ask you, what kind of a library doesn't open until 1pm on both Monday and Tuesday?  Especially since it is not only the local public library, but also the High School library.  And it doesn't open till 1pm?  I'll tell you what kind of library it is.  It's the kind that charges you to take anything out of there except books.  Books are free.  All else you pay for.  Can you believe it?    Next phone call is the post office.  This is an interesting one which requires me to give you some extensive background.  I sent out an invitation to Roman's christening to the mother of a very good friend of the family.  She wished to attend but would only do so if a formal invitation was extended to her (she wouldn't just come as a guest of her son).  So I sent one to her along with the 60 other invitees in the middle of January.  A week or so later, it was returned to me with a stamp saying, "Return to sender.  Attempted - Not Known."  This woman has lived at this address since ancient times.  I called the family and verified that the address was indeed correct and then I took it back to the post office.  I talked to the clerk and he wrote on it, "Retry" and then stuck it back in the mail (mind you, this was in the days of dragging two kids and my father in law everywhere I went so this was no easy trip to the post office).  By 4pm that very same afternoon, the damn letter was back in my freaking box!!!!  Back to the post office I went.  This time the clerk told me that since it was returned for a second time that is obviously is the incorrect address.  I try to explain to him that it never left Ewa Beach the second time and that they need to try it once more.  He calls in his supervisor he then tells me that I simply don’t understand the complex post system and that this letter just cannot be delivered.  “WHAT?  WHY?”  I ask in my most diplomatic stressed out fat housewife demeanor.  His answer: “Because you didn’t scratch out the postal bar codes stamped on the bottom from the first time it was returned.”  Huh?  Like this is MY damn job?  No, sir. My job is to clean up poop and pee and breastmilk spit up.  That’s my job.  My job doesn’t involve postal codes or bars or any of that nonsense.  Jackass.  Anyway, I scratched out the damn bar codes with a marker and sent it off for a third time.  At the suggestion of the supervisor, I followed this up with a phone call the post office for her zip code.  I talked to a guy there and he promised me that he would be on the look out for this letter and would personally make sure that it was delivered in time for the christening. On Monday, two weeks after the christening, it arrived back in my box.  This time stamped “Insufficient address.”  This was the reason for my post office phone call.  I called the Chicago post office and explained to a woman there the situation.  This, mind you, was the same number I called when the man assured me that he would make sure it got delivered.  This woman tells me that I have the wrong post office and gave me another number to call.  I call that number and explain to a man there what happened and he tells me that the woman I am sending to must have moved.  No, she didn’t.  Well, she must have forgotten to change her address when she moved.  No, she never moved.  Oh, well, then she didn’t come to our office and fill out a forwarding address form before she moved.  SHE NEVER EVER MOVED.  He then asked me for the name and address and went to look it up.  After fifteen minutes, he comes back and says, “Ummm…. She never moved.  I don’t know why it’s getting returned to you.  Just put it back in the mail and I’ll make sure it gets to her.” Sound familiar?  I’ll keep you posted on that one.  Minutes after that call my mom calls to tell me a few things about my grandma.  In the first few minutes of talking, RK comes up to me and says, "Mama, I'm all wet."  I asked her if she peed her panties and she proudly says, "Yep."  (the potting retraining is going like gangbusters, you can see)  I tell her to go change her panties and clean her yoni and off she goes to the bathroom and resume talking to my mom.  A few minutes go by and I realize that I hear her splashing in the toilet.  I investigate and find her dunking her panties in the potty, poop all over the floor (big hunks), smeared all over the toilet, the baby potty, even the tub.    I get off the phone with my mom, grab the disinfectant towels and start to clean.  I put RK in the tub to just stand.  Of course, she can't just stand so she is touching her poop smeared bum with her hands and then touching her hair, her face, even rubbing her eyes (to which she got my shrieking in her ear!!!)  When I finished cleaning up the mess (took about ten minutes -- it was that bad), I turn the shower on and we both go in the shower.  RK hates showers and screams so much and so loudly that she wakes Roman and he starts screaming.  By the end of the shower, all three of us are screaming.   Oh, and Truman peed on the carpet right outside the bathroom door.  I got to step in that when I exited the steamy scream chamber.  I am getting the kids dressed and the only clean clothes I have for them are new ones.  I picked out sort of matching outfits from a good friend of the family.  I’m not sure what possesses me to do this, but I decide to take some pictures of them in these outfits to email to the woman who got the clothes for them.  As I’m getting Roman diapered, he spouts a fountain and pees all over himself, the clothes, and the bedding.  I give him a bath (the pee got all over his little remaining hair) and strip and make the bed.  I get another outfit that’ll go with RK’s and set about taking pictures.  While I am snapping away, Reilly, who is bare bottomed (for potty retraining) pees all over my freshly made bed as well as her dress.  I strip the bed and the child and redress both.  I smartly decide to quit taking pictures.  I’m gathering our stuff up to get us out of the house.  I go to grab my cell phone which had been charging for several hours.  It is not charged.  In fact, the display says, “Unable to charge.”  I retry it a couple of times and then the thing just plain old dies.  Completely and totally dies.  Fine.  Not exactly a good day to leave the house without a cell phone, but I’ll throw the bones.  Everything in life is a gamble, right?  As I am pulling out of the garage, a bird flew in.  Yep.  A bird.  Flew right into my garage.  I get out of the car and try to shoo it out of there, but it’s scared and panics and flies about frantically.  The last I see of it is by a pile of Rubbermaid boxes filled with holiday decorations.  I couldn’t find it after that.  I decide to proceed with my leaving since it’ll probably fly out when I open the garage door upon our return.  Again, a gamble.  It is now 11:30am and we are off to Wal-Mart.  Ya see, on Thursday (the day of the storm) RK had to leave the house without shoes on because we have somehow lost all the shoes that fit her.  Well, that isn’t exactly true.  We have closed toe shoes, but she only owns several pairs of socks (since she is mostly in sandals) and she wore them on our trip so they were dirty.  Anyway, we had to go get her shoes.  And sunglasses (she broke her last pair and she screams if we’re in the car and the sun hits her eyes without sunglasses on).  Long story short with Wal-Mart is that they didn’t have sandals in her size so I bought her a size too big.  And the sunglasses fit fine, but she broke them before we even had left the store.  As I am putting our stuff into the van, RK says, “I gotta go poo poo, Mama.”  Luckily, my mom bought us a little tiny car potty.  It basically is a seat that you attach these bags to.  On the bottom of these bags is a pad thing to absorb pee.  So I set this up, but by the time I got it set up, she had already started to go in her panties.  Poor thing had diarrhea.  She went so much that she filled the bag and it started to pile up to her bum.  I had her get up and I changed the bag.  She filled two bags with poop.  So imagine it.  There I am in the parking lot with a baby on my boob (oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that by this point Roman was hungry and I had to nurse him) and a toddler on a bag car potty for about 20 minutes.  People would go in and come back out and we’d still be there.  I’m sure we were a sight to behold.  When we got home, I tried calling the library again.  I explained to them that we don’t have the movie and that I was out of town and unable to pick up the book I had ordered.  While they were busy calculating my fees, I just happened to think that maybe, just MAYBE, the movie had fallen behind our TV.  I look and can make out the shadow of something.  While still on hold, I try moving the TV and the wine cabinet that it rests on.  As I am heaving and hoeing, the top drawer in the wine cabinet falls out and hits my foot causing me to scream out in pain which for some reason startled Truman who starts barking his head off waking up Roman (Reilly Kate thankfully was still asleep having fallen asleep on the ride home from Wal-Mart).  But low and behold, I find the stinkin’ DVD.  When the lady comes back on the phone, I excitedly tell her that I found the movie.  She then tells me that the late fees for it are 20 bucks.  TWENTY BUCKS for a movie that my daughter couldn’t even watch to start with.  So all said and done, with rental fees and late fees, I will have spent 40 bucks at the library in just TWO stinkin’ visits!!!  It would be cheaper for me to just go to Borders and buy the damn books and DVDs!!!  Shortly thereafter, Mike comes home and I ask RK to show him her new shoes.  She puts them on and then tries to walk in them.  She fell flat on her face.  They are too big.  She cannot walk in them.  Great.  Guess who’s going to Kmart today for shoes and another pair of sunglasses.  For dinner, I cooked a pork roast according to the directions.  When I cut it open, it was still bleeding.  We nuked it and it tasted like shit.  We had chocolate ice cream instead.  Oh, and that bird in the garage?  Haven’t seen hide nor feather of it.  I imagine we’ll know for sure it’s fate in a few days when it starts to stink.

      Yesterday the kids and I were at one of those immense strip mall shopping plazas.  I had to go from one end to the other-- a two minute drive or a ten minute walk.  Most people would drive, of course.  Not mothers.  As any mother will tell you that a trip such as that is much easier, quieter, and more enjoyable when walked versus loading and unloading the stroller, strapping the kids into their carseats, and squeezing the minvan into another compact car spot.  I know, personally, once I've got my minivan shoehorned into one of those itsy bitsy spots, I never want to leave.  I've walked miles to avoid moving the van for that reason alone.  As we were walking past an Old Navy store, a sign caught my eye.  "Buy Your Old Navy Mother's Day Tee -- $5."  A Mother's Day tee?  I stopped in my tracks.  Be still my heart!  We've now got t-shirts dedicated to us.  Glory be!  Maybe next they'll have $5 Mother's Day bath towels.  Or a $5 oil change special.    When the baby started fussing and Reilly chimed in with her, "Whatchya doing, Mom?" interrogation chorus, I thought perhaps a $5 Mother's Day vodka gimlet would be a good idea.  Can't you just see it?  A little stand, like a lemonade stand, set up with a big sign, "Thank you, Moms.  For all that you do, this gimlet's for you!"    "Whatchya doing, Mom?" Reilly repeated for the 7th time in 30 seconds.  She's a very fast, repetitive talker.  "We're going in this store.  Come on," I answered her while trying to maneuver the stroller, loaded down with bags and baby, through the swinging door marked "Pull."  The shirts were there in a big display you couldn't miss as soon as you walked through the door.  There were piles of them in two different colors: pale pink and robin's egg blue.  Emblazon across the bust in a funky, retro 1970s t-shirt font was, "I [heart] Mom."  They were all in adult sizes.  Who would wear one of these, I wondered.  How absolutely bizarre would it be for a grown woman to walk around wearing a shirt that announced her adoration for "Mom."  I leaned down and picked one up.  They were made from that soft, silky, stretchy jersey cotton that is like calorie-free comfort food for your body.    "If ya didn't put that silly saying on the front, I would have bought one," I grumbled to the gum cracking teenager folding tiny little "American Idol" tank tops at the display next to me.  She shrugged.  "We've got some 4th of July shirts in back," gum cracker offered.    "Whatchya doing, Mom?"  Reilly asked again, over and over and over again.  "Looking at these shirts but now we're done.  Let's go," I answered her as I pulled the stroller into a U turn and headed toward the door.  The same door, mind you, that we entered through which despite the fact that we were now on the other side of it, still said "Pull."  Why do they do that?  Just to make it difficult on those of us with strollers?  They should come up with the Mother's Day Easy to Open Retail Shopping Door.  I'd pay five bucks for that.  Right outside the store was a bench.  Since Roman was still fussing in the stroller, I decided to try a little of what my friend Holly terms "Breast Attachment Therapy."  When they've got a boob in the mouth, it is difficult for them to keep on whining.    The strategy has to change a little when they are no longer interested in the boob.  Reilly Kate instead got some multicolored goldfish crackers as a follow up to her lollipop lunch.  With my boob in the mouth of one and unnaturally colored cheese crackers in the mouth of the other, I achieved a few minutes quiet to contemplate "I [heart] Mom."  So if I were to buy this shirt, which I definitely was NOT going to do, and wear it, which I absolutely, positively would NEVER do, who would I be referring to as "Mom?"  I'm a mom, but I certainly don't think I should be walking about saying I [heart] myself as a mom.  Especially given the fact that I was trekking my poor kids across three parking lots to avoid putting them in their carseats and had opted out of lunch, dismissing it as a distraction from the main goal which was to buy wallpaper boarder before the hallowed 2pm nap time.    Nope.  Not me.  I wasn't deserving of a $5 Motherhood Achievement award.  Not today at least.  I thought about my mom.  Maybe, if I were to wear it which I definitely was not going to do, I would be declaring my adulation and devotion to my own mother.  A single mother who gave up her social life to run us around to various activities.  I'd bet she gave up her sex life, too, since she had no privacy.  Our house had only two bedrooms and she gave one to each of us, my brother Danny and I, and slept on the couch for close to ten years.  She never even really got to celebrate Mother's Day until we were older.  She was always too busy making the holiday nice for her own mother and grandmother.  One year, we went to the Shedd Aquarium and disected squid.  My poor mother.  She hates gross stuff like that.  As I recall, the damn dead thing squirted ink in her face.  What a way to spend Mother's Day.  Maybe I would be wearing it for my grandma who, after having been diagnosed with  urlLink myelodysplastic syndrome , is fighting the battle of her life, for her life.  Reilly Kate just loves her "GG" (short for Great Grandma) and prays every night, "God bless GG.  Make her well."  She's never far from our thoughts nowadays.  Then I thought of the other mothers I have met since I became a mother myself.  I thought of a woman I used to know who was due at the same time I was with Reilly.  We communicated often during our pregnancies.  Unexpectedly, her son was born with Downs Syndrome.  He's a beautiful boy and she has always been such an incredible mom to him.    There was a woman I met at the baby gym who fosters drug addicted newborns.  She was in the middle of adopting two babies only three months apart in age.  She went through hormone therapy and months of pumping in order to produce milk for these babies.  Her son was born just a few hours after Roman.  She had so much patience and kindness.  Selfless.  My mind wandered to the more mundane.  All the moms in the world wipe snotty noses and kiss boo boos.  We yearn for our children to fly on their own, ache when they falter, and mourn when they leave the nest.  We hold little fat hands when crossing the street and spend sleepless nights rocking our babies and worrying over our teenagers.  We clean poopy hinies and do more laundry than a dry cleaners in China town.  It's an unglamorous job, really.  And at times utterly thankless.  I'm so proud to be a member of the sisterhood, to wear the label MOM.  It's really a blessing.  A blessing I really do love.  When the kids were done with the boob and goldfish, I marched right back into the store (yep, the door still said "Pull") and plunked down five bucks.  I got the  urlLink shirt .  It says, I [heart] Mom, and I do.  I really, really do.   I encourage you all to go out and get one.  And wear it.  I'll be wearing mine tomorrow to dance class.

      In the past few days, I have been the innocent victim of conservative blathering in the form of email.  Actually, it is my own fault.  So I’m not really a victim.  I read the damn thing and suffered the high blood pressure for it.   I now feel it necessary to purge my system of it, to wash off its cyber filth from my liberal conscience.  If I don’t, I fear my head will explode.  When I started this blog, I swore I wouldn’t wax poetic or political.  But change the name to “The Misadventures of a Fat, Opinionated, Liberal Bed-Wetting Housewife” because here I go:  The emails as they were in my hotmail account will appear in plain font.  My words will appear in bold.  A bit complicated for you ditto-heads out there.  I hope you can follow along.  A New Constitution   The following has been attributed  to State Representative Mitchell Kaye from GA. The guy should run for  President.....    This particular piece has been warped and changed and misattributed through its meandering from inbox to inbox.  The majority of the drivel here was written by Lewis Napper of Mississippi in 1993.  For more information, see  urlLink snopes .   "We, the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any  more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior, and secure the blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great-grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt-ridden,  delusional and other liberal bed-wetters. We hold these truths to be  self-evident: that a whole lot of people are confused by the Bill of Rights and  are so dim that they require a Bill of No Rights."    I’m prone to uncontrollable fits of giggling every time I’m called a liberal bed-wetter primarily, I guess, because it reveals the mentality of the name caller.  If I’m a bed-wetter, conservatives are diapers since they are full of dookie.  As a mom to two small children and the daughter of two big Republicans, I know of which I speak.   ARTICLE I:  You do not have the right to a new car, big  screen TV or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally  acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.    You also don’t have the right to pollute the air my kids breathe with deregulations and corporate exemptions.  You don’t have the right to clear cut forests and build redwood decks.  You don’t have the right to fill up your oversized luxury SUV with the cheapest gas in the world and whine that gas taxes are too high and the smog is too thick.     ARTICLE II:  You do not have the right to never be offended. This  country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just  you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be ... and like the rest of us you need to simply deal with it.    Agreed.  So the next time Janet Jackson flashes her tit on tv and you don’t like it, turn the channel!  Get your mind out of the gutter and the rest will follow.  My kids saw that and thought “LUNCH!”  Also, if gay marriage offends you, don’t attend the wedding.  If abortion offends you, don’t have one. And if multiculturalism offends you, stay at home and reread your copy of Mein Kampf.   ARTICLE III:  You do not have the right to be free from harm. If  you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful; do not expect the  tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy.   You don’t have the right to jeopardize the safety of my family to accumulate another dollar.  If the design for the product is faulty, don’t bring in bean counters to assess whether fixing the problem will cost more than the lawsuits.  Fix the problem because it is the right thing to do.   ARTICLE  IV:  You do not have the right to  free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and  will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing  generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing  more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes.   You do not have the right to flatter yourself into thinking we are the most charitable people around.  Sadly, we are not.  In terms of percentage of GNP, we are the least charitable of any industrialized nation in the world.  In order: Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, teeny tiny little Luxembourg, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, France, Finland, Switzerland, UK, Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, Portugal, New Zealand, Japan, Austria, Greece, and Italy are all more generous than the grand US of A.    You don’t have the right to belittle those stuck in a cycle of socio-economic poverty.  You haven’t a clue what it is like to be an inner city kid with parents addicted to drugs and gang bangers for neighbors.  These kids go to schools that lack adequate plumbing and lighting and are taught by teachers unable to give each child their own textbook.  They see violence and crime and no way out.  Try reaching out a hand to help them up rather than looking down your nose at them to make yourself feel better about your own pathetic accomplishments.    ARTICLE  V:  You do not have the right to  free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing,  we're just not interested in public health care.    I don’t think anyone is asking for free health care.  Nothing is free.  But equal access to quality health care regardless of income should be a basic right.  Those without health care are usually the working poor, meaning they are not your so-called professional couch potatoes but those people who due to their low pay cannot afford insurance.  The biggest sufferers?  The children of these workers.      Oh, and don’t think you don’t pay for it in the end.  Ultimately, we all do.  It is the reason why an aspirin at the hospital costs $15.  You see, these working class people without healthcare cannot get any preventative care or routine medicines.  They are forced to wait until an illness becomes life threatening and become an ER charity case which we all pick up the tab for.   Ain’t nothing free .  ARTICLE VI:  You do not have the right to physically harm other  people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill someone, don't be  surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair. (Yeah!)    What really bumfuzzles me is this asinine comment coming from the mouths of supposed Christians.  I have a couple of questions for those of you who call yourselves Christians and yet believe in capital punishment.  First, and foremost, what part of “Thou shalt not kill” is unclear?  Have you ever seen an exception or an addendum to that?  Second, which part of “Ye who is without sin cast the first stone” is confusing?  Is it the “ye” because I can clear that up for you right now.  It’s just a fancy way of saying “you.”  And lastly, how do you think a man who was wrongly put to death would feel about capital punishment?  Did you ever think to ask Jesus?   ARTICLE  VII: You do not have the right to  the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or  services of other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together  and lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big screen color TV, pool tables, etc.   Okay.  I’m good with this.  As long as we count corporate thieves as well.  Oh, oh, oh!  Can you say ENRON?  I know!  Let’s start with the crook that’s holding the White House hostage.  Martha Stewart ain’t got nothin’ on that guy.     This is where it gets really interesting.  The original Article VIII is what follows.  You’ll see why it was cut.  Remember, this was written in 1993 when Clinton was in office .    ARTICLE VIII: You don't have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate oppressive governments and won't lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if you'd like. However, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.   I would find this to be highly amusing given the current quagmire “W” has gotten us into if it weren’t for the men, women, and children in Iraq, both American and Iraqi, that are being killed each and every day.  Watching a six year old American accept a triangular folded flag from his father’s casket or a four year old Iraqi mourning the loss of her parents, grandparents, and two of her four limbs doesn’t make for amusement to me.    We do not have the right to invade other countries to settle Daddy’s debt, to make Haliburton richer, gas prices lower, boost our defense contractors’ bottom lines, or to flex our might.  We do not have the right to unilateral aggression simply because we have the brute strength to do so.  We do not have the right to set up a puppet government in underdeveloped nations and force our values and ideals on a people very different from ourselves.   We have a right to defend ourselves.  We should be focused on finding Osama Bin Laden and destroying Al Qaida and all its Taliban minions.  Then again, we should have been doing that 15 years ago when feminists in this country were protesting the Taliban’s harsh regime in Afghanistan and American oil companies’ monetary support of it.  Maybe if you conservatives would have seen it as preventive diplomatic care rather than “soothing a liberal conscience” or “nation building” thousands of Americans wouldn’t have had to die on 9-11.   ARTICLE  VIII:  You don't have the right to a  job. All of us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in  hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of part  time jobs, education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself  useful.    Let me see here.  You don’t have a right to a job.  But if you don’t have a job, then you are a slovenly couch potato, which you have no right to be.  Do you have a right to education and vocational training?  If so, do you have a right to a good, quality, public education with text books and adequate plumbing and lighting and teachers with up to date certifications?   ARTICLE  IX:  You do not have the right to  happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness  --which by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an overabundance  of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.    And pursuing happiness is a lot easier if you are allowed to love and marry whomever you please, see a doctor when you are sick, get a good education and have access to higher learning, breathe fresh air and drink clean water, and watch the Superbowl halftime show with a flash of guilt free boob.   ARTICLE  X:  This is an English speaking  country. We don't care where you are from. We welcome you here. English is our  language and like the one you left behind, we also have a culture. Learn it or  go back to the country and the living conditions you were  fleeing. If you agree, share this with a friend.  No, you don't have to, and nothing tragic will befall you if you don't. I just think it is about time common sense is allowed to flourish -- just call it "The  Age of Reason Revisited   I’m tempted to not even touch this one since it was added on to make up for conservative peace nik #8.  But there are so many misguided souls out there yapping about this English only garbage that I just have to.    Yes, the majority of us speak English here.  It would be a great advantage to any immigrant to learn the language.  But it is not necessary.  Ya know, I have personal experience with this.  I lived in Korea, a homogeneous society, for two years.  During that time, I learned just a tiny, little bit of Korean. Interestingly, not a single Korean thought I should speak their language or adopt their culture.  It was completely acceptable for me to just be me living and working there.    Why is it that we Americans, who for the most part are descendents of immigrants, expect newcomers to adopt the mainstream language and culture? Why do we so harshly judge those who don’t?  And why don’t we put an emphasis on our children being able to speak a foreign language?  Our children are at a distinct disadvantage competing in a global economy with a monolingual education.  The majority of the world does not speak English.   Our culture is unique.  It is multicultural.  Don’t squelch it.  Celebrate it.  Embrace it. Be proud of it.      And stop reading crap like this.  It’ll rot your brain and that warthog in the White House will get re-elected.   Ahhh... but alas, what do I know?  I'm just a fat housewife.

      On Tuesday I packed up a cooler and the kids (separately, of course) and sat out for seven and a half hours waiting in line to register Reilly Kate for preschool.  Now, seven hours ain't nothing when compared with our four day long vigil for the new house. That was insane.  I was newly pregnant and there wasn't a bathroom.  I had to pee in a disposable tupperware bowl, for crying out loud.  This time they at least had bathroom facilities.  But this was nonetheless tedious and hot hot hot.  Have I ever mentioned how dang hot Ewa Beach is?  When I was a teen, my parents didn't allow me to attend concerts.  So unlike my peers, I never had that teen rite of passage involving days in line for concert tickets.  I am getting it all in now as a parent.  I stand in line for real estate, preschool, and flu shots.    As we sat there, several people came up to discuss the school (which aside from requiring a crazy ass wait in line, requires the parents co-teach several days per trimester), including the teacher, Miss Maureen.    Any parent can tell you that a child will act up in precisely the situation that they absolutely should behave like an angel.  It's like some sort of parental physics.  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  Take me for example.  I just prayed that she wouldn't say or do anything outrageous while talking to her new teacher and her reaction was to poop her pants.  Parental physics.  As simple as New Math.  She also refused to talk to the teacher.  Yes.  Reilly Kate refused to talk.  When asked her name she responded with, "I'm two."  Then she shoved her finger up her nose and walked away.  I just stood there staring blankly at Miss Maureen and contemplating her clear resemblance to Olive Oil.  I was deep on this thought when we were interrupted by Reilly who came and stood between the two of us, fanny sticking out and stinking up.  It was obvious that she had pooped.  The number one rule of this preschool is that they must be potty trained.  Lovely, huh?  The good news is that school doesn't start till the end of July.  So we have plenty of time to straighten out the details of her potty training (like not pooping in your pants in front of the teacher).  If we fail in that, I'll just sue on the grounds of discrimination.   It's obvious that my child is anally challenged.

      I am still working on the Easter tale.  It's gonna be long.  Actually, maybe I should do it in installments.  Anyway...   Instead of not having anything for you to read until then, I thought I would post an oldie but a goodie.  I wrote this on March 22, 2002, when Reilly was just three months old.  Time sure flies...   Today. Fun day. I had an eye doctor appt. Fortunately, I had a sitter for Reilly since they dilated my eyes. Never telling me that I should have someone with to drive me. After the appt. I ask her when I can drive and she said whenever I want.  So I get in my car and drive. Of course, I live damn close to the equator so the sun is VERY VERY bright. And my eyes are dilated. So I put on  two  pairs of sunglasses and continue driving. Until I realize somehow I've gotten myself lost. I have no clue where I am nor can I see any street signs to help me. I reach for my cell phone....Where is it? AH HAH!!! No cell phone!! I forgot it at home.   Finally, with the help of God and a toothless dude named "Hi" at the Tesoro gas station, I get back on track. I stop at the Walmart to buy burner covers (I'm getting lazy in my motherhood -- faster to cover the burners than to clean them). Except, again, I cannot see. I ask one of the worker bees to help me. In order to see close up, I must take off my sunglasses which are prescription. I do so and the worker bee screams. My eyes are so dilated she thinks I'm a freak.   Now, I'm off to the grocery store. I wanted to pick up some bread and cheese. I pick up a block of cheddar for 3.95 and a loaf of french bread for 1.69. I take it to the counter and she rings me up. A wopping 12.78. WHAT?!?!? I asked her and she told me the cheese was 8.95!!!! Yes, I still cannot see. I take my almost 10 dollar cheese and go to the post office.   There is a line out the door at the post office. The lady in front of me has the cutest baby. I asked her and she said he's 5 months. He is so cute and I'm looking at him and he at me. He squeals. I squirt. Yep, my milk came POURING out. Right down the front of my shirt. When it's my turn, I am dripping wet, blind, and frustrated.  I was mailing some pictures home and the bill came to 10 bucks. I open my wallet and I am short. Why the hell am I short? Oh, yes. I have ten dollar cheese in my car.   I charge the postal bill.  Then I pick Reilly up, take her home, and am playing with her. She feels warm. I take her temp and it is 100 degrees. Is she sick or teething? I gave her some baby tylenol and will keep checking it to see if she's okay.   But what do I know about that stuff?  I think I'll go and have some cheese. Since my eyesight has come back, I've realized that I have a block of cheddar the size of the Big Island.

      I've been working on a little ditty on our Easter adventure.  But I haven't finished it and I'm pooped.  I just wanted to post something to let you all know that I am alive and well and just haven't the energy tonight to finish.  Stay tuned.  Oh, and tomorrow should be another good adventure.  We'll be sitting out in line for 7 hours.  What for?, you ask.  Concert tickets, perhaps?  Dora's autograph?  A picture with Sponge Bob?  No, no, no.  Nothing quite so fun.  We'll be in line for 7 hours to get Reilly Kate signed up for preschool.  It's the only one in the area that is decent and reasonably priced.    I'll have the cell phone on.  Take pity on me and give me a call.

      It's a safe bet that we will not be making any friends at dance class.    This was our second class with this particular group.  They've been together for several months, practicing a couple of routines that they'll be performing in the coming weeks.  All the little girls have their matching tutus and fairy wands and they all know the choreography.  All that is but the new girl and her mom -- that's us.  So we're already starting out on the outs.    There are other little things that also set us apart.  For example, all the other little girls are dressed head to toe in pink frills.  In our last class, Reilly was one of  the few in pink.  The other girls were in trendy streetwear black and glitz.  When she outgrew her old pink and frills, I bought her funky dance attire.  Then we switched classes.  She is now the only girl in black.  In contrast to the others, she looks like a two year old stripper.  Another difference:  the other moms are all thin and cute and seemingly have it all together.  One mom handed out birthday invitations to the class (sans us) which were hand made.  Another mom made Easter treats in little plastic eggs.  And another has her hair all neatly blown out and perfectly coifed.  These ladies are all smiles and Martha Stewart, pre-prison.  In we came, literally running in five minutes late, dropping baby toys and sippy cups as we went.  The quiet of their previously calm studio was shattered by my son doing his high pitched baby whine and the squeak of my stroller wheel saying, "WD 40.  WD 40.  WD 40," with every rotation.  My hair, untethered by a scrunchy, was free and wild and whipping around due to the industrial fan they have blowing to keep the studio cool.  And my daughter, in her glitter and glitz, black and silver, sexy toddler garb strutted in, stood in front of the whole class and announced, "I eat birdy poo poo!!"  "No, you do not, Reilly Kate," I lied in a desperate attempt to fool the others into thinking we're just a normal, have-it-all-together family simply having the odd, off day.  "Yes, I do. At the pool.  Mama say, 'Eeew, yucky.  It's gross.'  But I say, 'Isss goooood.  Mmmmmm.....'"  "Just get your shoes on, Reilly.  They're all waiting for you,"  I shut her up and temporarily shut her down.  They began the class with stretches.  Reilly was stretching with the other girls, trying to imitate the teacher with hands over the head lunges and pointy toed side bends.  Then they each sat down, knees bent, soles of the feet pressed together.  They bounced their knees up and down, making what the teacher calls a "butterfly."  Reilly was digging it.  She loves butterflies.  I'm thinking, at this point at least, she is really going to like this class.    The teacher then instructed them all to bend over and smell their toes.  She tells them this as a way of getting them all to stretch out.  All the little frilly pink girls bent over and sniffed and when they came back up said in the sweetest, daintiest, little voices, "Stinky feet!"   Reilly Kate bent over, didn't sniff, but instead lickrf her feet and said, "Mmmm... Smells good.  Smell it.  I smell it.  Smells good."  The entire class, frillies, Marthas, and teacher all looked at her like she was from the planet Gross.  And quite possibly, she is.  While they practiced plies, Reilly got bored and threw herself onto her belly in the middle of the room.  As she hit the wood floor with a thud, she bellowed, "Sucks!"  The normal reaction of any mother who hears a bad word escape from their child's mouth is to correct the child with a gentle, but firm, "We don't say words like that, honey."  I have learned that "normal" does not pertain to any mothering situation that comes my way.  Particularly when it comes to bad words.  Last week, we were in the religious section of the video department at Walmart.  I was looking at the old Jesus movies (as I've said before, Reilly loves Jesus).  Suddenly, unexpectedly, and seemingly out of nowhere, my beloved daughter, the one who is a big Jesus fan, yelled out, "These god damn stickers are always in my way!!!"  Then she threw out some stickers that I thought I had hidden in the cart so as to surprise her with them on Easter morning.  I caught the stickers and sweetly, gently, and kindly said to her, "Dear heart, we do not say such things.  Taking the name of our lord in vain is a sin.  Only say "God" when speaking to him while in prayer."    "Mama say that.  Mama say, 'god damn!'" All within earshot, a whole crowded aisle filled with pious Polynesians perusing the Easter movies, were staring straight at me, listening to the entire conversation.  So I did whatever any level headed mother in complete moral panic would do.  I lied.  "Well, then, I'm going to have to speak with your mother about that.  I don't want her saying stuff like that around you if you are going to repeat it.  I dislike that kind of nasty talk and will not allow it around me.  If it continues, I will refuse to babysit you and then where will your mother be?  I suggest you both clean up your mouths."  And with that, I hightailed it on outta there.  From this experience I gleaned I must lie in situations like this so as to cover my own potty mouth.  Better to lie than to reveal myself a toilet talking mama with no hopes of reforming.    "Socks?  No, no.  No, Socks, Reilly.  We don't wear socks to dance class, silly.  We wear tights.  You have on tights."  I was bailing as fast as I could.  "No socks.  SUCKS!!  Sucks.  Sucks.  Sucks, " insisted my clear speaking two year old as she began pounding on the floor with the toes of her tap shoes.  "We don't wear socks in Hawaii.  I don't have on socks.  No one here has on socks.  I didn't even bring you any socks.  But if you really, really want some socks, we'll buy you some after class."  I yanked her up and whispered in her ear, "Don't say 'sucks,' Reilly.  Please don't say it.  These other girls won't be your friend if you say 'sucks.'"  Replying in her loudest, most defiant voice, Reilly said, "Mama says "sucks."  Not socks.  No socks.  SUCKS!!!"  There could be no denying my maternity in this crowd.  I took the best path available to me at the time.  I just said nothing, hung my head in shame, and prayed that she would just let it drop.  Eventually, she did.  She moved on to picking her nose... and eating it.  What exactly is the proper way of correcting a child whose favorite snack is stored right up her nose?  All the experts suggest diversion.  I was leary of diverting her attention since the nose picking/booger eating had gotten her away from the "sucks" repetitions.  But I knew if I didn't do something, we'd be in for an all you can eat booger extravaganza.    Sadly, motherhood has left me little in the way of intellectually acuity.  My clunky thought processes are similar to the whirling emitted from George W's when he's in front of a Coke machine.  So many, many choices... hard to choose... what to do next... can't decide... forget Coke... invade another country.  I don't have an army, though, so I usually just sit blankly.  Basically, I'm about as sharp as a stick of butter these days.  So as I sat there, feeblely attempting to devise a diversionary tactic, my booger eating, potty mouthing, hoochy mama toddler comes up to me and says, "I love you soooo much!  I make you happy.  Are you happy, Mama?  I make you happy when I build you a sand castle. I build you a sand castle on the bed."  She was referring to an incident yesterday involving a load of clean clothes that were neatly folded and awaiting a chance for me to put them away.  She climbed on my bed, unfolded them, and stacked them up one on the other.  She insisted the mound was a sand castle and if you closed your right eye, and looked squinty with the left while cocking your head to one side, you could see the resemblance.  "Yes, Reilly Kate.  That sand castle made me very happy.  I love you, too."  "And I peed on Mama-Daddy's bed, too!" she added enthusiastically.  "I peed all over the bed.  Made Mama mad.  Made Mama angry.  Her yelled.  I peed on the bed," she sing-songed as she tapped on over to the teacher who was now asking me if she was wearing a diaper because they had just installed new Pergo flooring and it can't withstand wet messes.  But I cannot blame our lack of friendship possibilities solely on Reilly Kate.  No, I had my share in it as well.  While the girls were on stage performing their dress rehearsal, us moms all sat together to watch.  I noticed one little girl talking almost as much as Reilly, who, as you should know by now, does not shut up (I've actually taken the liberty of carving down most of her ramblings into nice, short, sound bites which actually fit into the story.  If I were to quote her word for word, you wouldn't leave my blog for days.)  I turned to her mother and with the hope of creating an ally said, "Wow.  It's really nice to meet another child who talks nonstop."  With a scowl on her face akin to receiving an oil change as an anniversary gift, she said, "I think that's normal for this age."  Thinking I could still save the situation with some of my infamous self deprecating humor, I continued.  "Yeah, right.  The rest of the class is quietly following the teacher's direction as our two just yammer away. And not even to each other.  Just bathering on and on to no one in particular..."  I dropped the rest in light of the daggers she shot my direction.  I had just dug myself a ten foot hole with both my feet in my mouth.  Yum.  I spent the rest of the practice rehearsal just trying to melt into the background, despite my still whining baby disrupting the mood and making it hard for the frillies to hear the music.  As soon as the practice rehearsal was over, while the frillies were on stage taking their bows, Reilly Kate climbed down and began running to me.  I bent down, thinking she was coming to give me a great big hug overcome with excitement in performing on stage.  As she got closer, I realized that she wasn't slowing down.  She was, in fact, increasing in speed.  It didn't look like she was planning on stopping.  In fact, it didn't look like she was coming to give me a hug at all.  Just as I was straightening up to brace myself for the hit, she tackled me.  Hard.  Down we went.  Both of us.  Almost taking Roman and the stroller with us.  There I was flat on my back, my child on top of me giggling with sheer delight.  It was, on all counts, an excellent tackle.  Maybe we should try football lessons.  I bet they'd love her black, glitzy get up.  I wonder if they make black helmets with glitter butterflies and rhinestone hearts...

      What's with all the bodily excretions?  My life as a mother is cluttered with bodily excretions.  Just today I had to deal with pee and poop, saliva, snot and boogers (yes, they are two different things -- ask any mom), regurgitated breastmilk, tears, sweat, and ear wax.  And this was an easy day.  I got out of blood, pus, eye boogers, vomit, toe cheese, and belly button gunk.  Lucky me.  The first time I noticed a booger in my bra, I was floored.  How could a  booger  have gotten in my  bra ?  Was someone sneaking in my room while I was asleep and using my uber expensive nursing bras to store nose goo?  Boogers don't just leap into bras, ya know.    I spent a couple of days perplexed and on high alert for the booger bandit.  Then while nursing Reilly, I saw it.  It was a big, fat rubbery baby booger perched at the very tip of her nose.  As she nursed, the thing rubbed off her nose and clung to my breast.  So this was how I was getting boogers in my bra.    Now that I solved that mystery, I had an even bigger problem to deal with:  What to do with said booger?  I was sitting down nursing, no where near a box of tissues.  No one else was home to get me a tissue.  And there it sat -- an ugly, gooey baby booger right on my breast, in full view.  Staring at me.  Mocking me.  Grossing me out.  A booger on my breast.  And not even my own booger.  I decided to fling it off with a finger thwack.  First, I needed to decide where to aim.  I didn't want it to go somewhere that would be obvious.  It needed to fly to a spot where it could live out it's short booger life in relative obscurity, drying into a nice crusty piece to be vacuumed up at a later date.  I decided that behind the television was as good a place as any.  I took careful aim and gave it my best finger thwack.    I didn't see it fly anywhere but it was no longer on my breast so I was satisfied.  Until I reached out to the remote control and saw the damn thing on my finger.  The booger hadn't flown anywhere.  It had just relocated to another part of  my  body.  Why hadn't it just stayed in its body of origin? I was starting to get more irritated than grossed out.  I attempted to flick it with a finger on my other hand, but that only resulted in it transferring over.  I tried shaking it off, but it was stuck to me like a barnacle to a barge.  I thought about relocating it to the recesses of the couch, but the image of a booger hiding out with the lost change and old M&Ms that reside there would have kept me from ever again sitting on it.  I even went so far as to try rubbing it into the fabric of my jeans.  But denim is no match for the rubbery consistency of a baby booger.  It just balled up and turned blue.  I must have sat there for ten minutes contemplating my next move.  That's when it happened.  I snapped.  I went from a normal person averse to the bodily fluids of others to a booger hiding miscreant devoid of all normal distaste for excretions.    I took the booger and hid it in my bra.  From there, it's been a steady decline into the realm of the disgusting.  I wipe snotty noses with the hem of my shirt.  I use spit as a facial cleanser on messy mouths.  Regurgitated breastmilk gets rubbed into the carpet.  Not even pee can scare me.  I just mop it up with whatever is handy and toss it into the dirty clothes bin.    And on any given day, you can almost guarantee I've got a booger in my bra.

      Yesterday, at the little Lutheran church down the street, a young mother made an announcement following the service.  She walked slowly and sadly up toward the front, paused, and then turned to face the congregation.  Her eyes were red and welled up with emotion.  Her voice, small and weak, trembled as did her bottom lip.  She looked so small and frightened.  Fragile.   She set her jaw and began, "I don't know how to tell you this, so I will just say it..."  And with that the tears started to stream down her face as she told us about the skull surgery her infant daughter must endure in a few weeks.  The gruesome details brought every mother in the room to the edge of her own world.  Not a one of us could hold back the tears.    We unconsciously grabbed our children to feel that they were still near us and physically well.  We silently prayed for little Anna Grace's well being while we secretly thanked God it wasn't our child.  I personally found myself flashing back to Reilly's first week of life.  All the IVs and the needles and the screaming and crying.  It all came crashing down on me, twisting my insides and torturing my soul.    For those that don't know, Reilly was hospitalized for a week following her birth due to an incompetent nurse's inability to take an accurate temperature and an overzealous pediatrician willing to sacrifice a new mother and her first born child to teach her students a lesson about infant sepsis.  The experience has colored every single moment of my motherhood.  It was my initiation into the sisterhood, wholly a baptism by fire.  Nothing, absolutely nothing can cut through a mother like the cry of her child.  There is something about motherhood that changes a woman.  I've described it before as a shift in your soul.  It is that profound.  You are never quite prepared for how different you will view the world or how much deeper you will feel.  The connection you have to your child is stronger than any connection you have ever made before.  It would actually baffle me at times that I couldn't feel her physical pain as they inserted yet another IV.  How could I be this connected, but feel nothing?  It was the worst anguish I have ever known.   There is a scene in Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion of the Christ, where Mary turned away so she wouldn't see her son stumble by carrying the cross to his death.  She turned away because she couldn't bear it.  But then she flashed back to a time when he was just a small boy and he fell.  The sound of his cries brought her running to his side, to kiss the scraped knee, to make it better, to dry his tears.  And so, Mary the mother of Jesus, turned toward her now grown son, to share in his pain as only a mother can.  Watching that scene stirred such emotion in me that I let out an audible sob.  I know that pain.  Every mother knows that pain.  So when this young mother looked into my eyes and asked me to please pray for her daughter, I did.  Immediately, I did.  And then she asked me to pray for the surgeons and I did also.  For the blood bank and for the blood donors and for the nurses and care staff and for her parents... on and on she went.  But she never once thought to ask for a prayer for herself.  And she is going to need them.    I pray that she finds the strength to smile at her scared infant daughter as they wheel her into surgery.  I will pray that she is given comfort while her daughter is away and I pray for her to have patience.  I pray that she has the endurance needed to cope with her own pain as she soothes her crying baby with sweet songs and strong arms.  And I pray that she lets this experience color her motherhood as it has mine.  For I appreciate my children's health and never take it for granted.  It is the greatest gift I could ask for.

      Yesterday, I paid 30 bucks so my kids could sit on a giant bunny's lap and I got the pictures to prove it.  It's like seasonal insanity.  Some holiday hits and I completely lose all grips on reality.  In reality, a teenage girl puts on a big fuzzy yellow bunny costume and lets my children sit on her lap whilst her girlfriend snaps crappy pictures with her digital camera and then prints them out on less than premium photo paper and I pay an outrageous sum of money which is sure to end up buying a Britney Spears CD.    So basically all I did this weekend was contribute to Britney's megamillions which supports her lavish lifestyle including trips to Vegas where she marries some poor sap only to divorce him hours later.  It all boils down to the destruction of American marriages and how the Easter bunny at the mall is, at least in some small part, responsible.    Falling prey to the Easter-Bunny-at-the-Mall trap isn't all I did this weekend.  I also dressed my kids up in pastel outfits with little duckies on them and forced bunny ears upon their heads.  Then I put them in various poses and bribed them to smile.  Reilly is easily bribed with candy or some such forbidden sweet.  Roman is harder to bribe.  Basically, I have to flash him a boob since breastmilk is the only thing he eats.  Picture it if you will:  My two kids in bunny ears and me shaking my bazongas and making yummy noises while dangling candy with one hand and snapping pictures with my other.  Yet another example of my maternal holiday insanity.    I also dyed Easter eggs with Reilly Kate.  She has quite the future in egg dying.  Straight away, she picked up an egg, eschewing the dipper and instead used her hands like an eggy Jackson Pollack or something.  Dip in here, dip in there, dip dip dip.  I really thought they'd turn out horribly.  Much to my surprise, however, they looked like a psychodelic, tie dye job.  Really quite colorful.  I watched her carefully for several minutes and tried to imitate her moves.  Every egg I made turned brown and ugly.  It's all in the wrist, I'm sure.  The problem with Reilly Kate and egg dying is really the drying part.  She thinks that once you finish with the dying you then pick up the egg and either throw it on the floor, crack it on the table, or just plain take a big old bite out of it, shell and all.  We now have a dozen beautifully colored but cracked and bitten eggs as well as the dozen ugly brown eggs I made.  We'll be eating a lot of egg salad in the next few days.    I am trying, though, to impart the spiritual meaning of Easter on my kids.  I want them to know that it is more than just giant fuzzy mall bunnies, psychodelic cracked eggs, and Mama's boobs.  Being that it is Palm Sunday, we took the kids to the local Lutheran church.  As I was busily snapping pictures of them in their bunny ears before we left, I must have told her we were going to God's house to see Jesus.  Reilly loves Jesus.  She's a big fan.  When we walked in, Reilly announced, "Jesus isn't here.  I don't see him.  He's not here."  I assured her that he was, that indeed this is Jesus' house.  "No, it's not," she stated most matter of factly, "I can't see him anywhere!  Where is him?"  "He's up there," I pointed to the altar.  "He's up by the cross."  "No, he's NOT!!!  Wheeeeere is heeeeeeeeeee?!?!?!"    She was starting to get agitated at this point and I didn't want to have a scene.  So I said, "Ask your father."  Mike answered without even looking up from the hymnal, "He's thinking."  Now, I'm not sure if it was Mike who was thinking or if it was Jesus, but it shut Reilly up for the moment which was the goal.  We all settled in and I thought the subject was forgotten about.  However, as soon as the processional began and she caught a glimpse of the pastor, she shouted, "There he is!! That's Jesus right there!!!"  "No," I corrected her.  "He works for Jesus.  Jesus is his boss.  Just like you are Mama's boss."  I let out a little chuckle at my snide witticism, thinking myself quite clever.  She nodded.  She is clear on the concept now.  Jesus is too busy thinking to actually appear in church and pastor is his Mama.   I should have just stuck to eggs, boobs, and bunnies.

      We're back from our vacation.  Who would have thought that our attempt to unwind would turn so stressful?  Here's a brief run down of events:  We arrived on the tiny island of Kauai, just north of our own little, tropical island, and found ourselves in an entirely different climate.  It was cold and raining.  Good thing I packed ONE inclimate weather outfit per child.  None for the Mom and Dad, however.  We froze our asses off.  This cold rain lasted the first three days of our trip.  Not to be outdone by the weather, we braved the elements and forged on with a boatride to the Fern Grotto and a round of golf.  On the fourth day we went to the beach to snorkel despite the cloudy, somewhat misty weather.  Fun, fish, coral, scenery.  A three quarter mile walk barefoot on hot sand carrying two children, food enough for a small, third world country, and just as many changes of clothes as Britney goes through in one of her shows.  It was almost paradise.  All that was missing was the sun.    Yet while we missed the sun due to the fact that it was kept well hidden behind the clouds, the sun found a way to touch us nonetheless.  You see, clouds are not only good for the sun to hide behind, but they act as a magnifier for the sun's burning rays.  My whiter than driven snow children, slathered in an SPF50 reapplied hourly, burned on that cool, cloudy day in Kauai.  Doesn't it sound like the punch line of a very bad joke?  Wait.  It gets worse.  The next day my dear husband, a devoted father who enjoys giving his daughter horsey back rides in spite of his bad back and who played the part of pack mule for our burning sand trek on the beach, awoke with a stiff and sore back.  No big deal, we thought.  Just take it easy for the day.  We went golfing and the only thing he drove was the cart.  When he went to bed, he was sure he'd wake up feeling much better.  And he did.  He felt great.  We spent a nice, relaxing day at the pool where he went in the jacuzzi and soaked his formerly sore back.  The weather had turned bright and shiny and warm.  All felt right with the world.  Until....  The day of our departure.  The pain in his back slipped down and over.  It had gone from his spine to his muscles in the form of severe spasms.  He was in incredible pain.  I packed us up and lugged us out.  And when our plane touched down here, on home sweet home, we went straight to the ER.    Since then he's gotten morphine and other fun pharmaceuticals.  We've taken him back to the ER twice and tomorrow we'll be going again. He cannot even walk to the bathroom.  At this point, there seems to be no end in sight.  All this and a vacation, too.  If I get any more relaxed, someone is gonna mistake me for a day trader on Wall Street.

      One of the first things that you notice when you become a mother is that while the job has some nice perks (slobbery kisses and soft baby snuggles are just a couple), time off is nonexistent.    Everyone knows there are sleepless nights involved, but no one thinks of getting sick.  If you get sick, you just suck it up and keep nursing, changing diapers, doing laundry, wiping chocolatey mouths and the hundreds of other daily chores that become almost painful while suffering the effects of whatever virus has come to roost.  And those viruses come more often when you have children in the house.    Children are moist breeding grounds with a deeply embedded bacterial magnet.  They are not just germ factories, they are more often than not Patient Zero.  So while you are caring for your sick child, they lovingly share (as you have been repeatedly telling them to do) and within hours you are suffering the same symptoms.   My friend Holly lived this a couple weeks ago.  She was comforting her 10 month old son when he baptized her in virulent puke.  In a matter of mere hours she was worshipping at the porcelain altar, catching quick little naps while laying on the cold tile of her bathroom.  Her son, in contrast, slept in peaceful comfort having rid himself of what ailed him.  He didn't just share.  He  gave .  Holly was less than proud.  The same goes for vacation time.  There is no such thing as a vacation when you are a mother.  Say you spend thousands of dollars on a tropical family trip.  Do you honestly think there will be any REST or RELAXATION for Mom in that R&R?  Nope.  In fact, family vacations are actually MORE work for Mom.   First, a mother must pack up everything packable.  Let's just talk clothing for example.  If you are gone 6 days, you'll need 9 pairs of pajamas per child (one for each day plus three extras in case of accidents).  A minimum of fifteen daytime outfits per child (that's 2 per day plus three extra in case of accidents).  Then you'll need several bathing suits per child and swim diapers if you are putting your little ones in the water.  Oh, and don't forget the shoes.  A pair of gym shoes, a pair of beach shoes, a pair of sandals, and their slippers.  That's four pairs -- per child.  Undergarments.  Well, just bring as many as you own if your child is not way, way, WAY past potty training.  Accidents always seem to happen when they are least convenient.  A hot, sticky, sandy beach with only a filthy 60 year old public bathroom used mainly by vagrants sums up inconvenient.  And that is just for clothing.  Then there are diapers and burp cloths, wipes and ointment, pacifiers, strollers and a sling, the Pack and Play, carseats, a breastpump and bottles, the baby food maker, sunblock, floaties, toys, toys, books, and toys, blankies, baby shampoo, a first aid kit, and DVDs.  Let's not forget Dad's golf clubs, either.  He is, afterall, on vacation.   Who ever set the airlines' 50lb per bag limit never went on vacation with children.  Wanna know what Mom gets to pack with that strict limit?  A frumpy skirted bathing suit, a toothbrush, and a t-shirt that reads, "I [heart] Mom."  This past week, I've been both suffering from a cold inherited from my generous children and packing up 30% of our household goods for a week long R&R.  Jail time with Martha Stewart is looking better every day.

      As many of you know, my children have inherited their father's skin tone.  White is not bright enough a color to describe their lack of pigmentation.  These poor kids literally are devoid of any melanin whatsoever.  They are negative factor melanin.  It is a huge detriment here on the equator.  Just to go outside for a short walk around the block requires me to slather loads of zinc oxide based skin block.  Last Saturday, we were supposed to go to the beach with another family.  After heaping the sunblock on both the kids, loading the car including a huge cooler with food and drink, and packing enough change of clothes to keep a small country in the latest aloha fashions, we wound up staying home and watching Animal Planet while eating fruity snacks.    How did that happen, you ask?  Well, Reilly rubbed her eyes.  A simple enough action that caused the ruin of an entire beautiful Hawaiian day.  She rubbed the sunblock straight into her eyes, irritating them so badly that it took 2 hours for her to stop crying and a 2 and a half hour nap for Mommy to recover from Mommy Guilt.  I'm in a damned if you do, damned if you don't quandary.  If I don't put the sunblock around her eyes, they burn.  I know.  I've avoided her eye areas before.  She burned.  As any high school drop out turned cosmetic counter salesperson can tell you, the skin surrounding the eyes is the most delicate skin on the body.  You burn that and, quite frankly people, you wind up looking like Katherine Hepburn by the age of 22.  I don't want that on my conscience.  But if I put the damn stuff around her eyes, she winds up rubbing it into her tear ducts.  Depending on how much of the gunk I slathered on, it can be a day breaker.  Saturday, I doubled coated her.  Yesterday we tried again to go to the beach.  It took a fifteen minute phone call with my mother to convince Reilly to even be in the room with me and the bottle of SPF 50.  It took another full hour to get it on her.  With a lot of care and cautious application, I did get the lotion on without it getting into her eyes or any other sensitive areas.  But here's the thing.  I used this line to convince her that she needs the lotion:  "You are special and need this lotion.  You are white.  White means you burn in the sun and you need lotion to protect you from burning."  I repeated this over and over, varying it a bit each time.    "You have special white skin."  "You can burn and need lotion because of your special white skin."  "If we don't put the lotion on, the sun could hurt you because you are special."  Do you see where I'm going with this yet?  By the time we got to the beach, Reilly Kate was repeating this to herself and anyone else who would listen.  "I am white.  I am special."    Huh?  That isn't what I meant.  Well, it is.  But it isn't.  Here in Hawaii, we haoles (white people in Hawaiian) are in the minority.  Bringing my children up with this unusual American experience is something I treasure.  I believe it will lend to them a unique perspective about race and justice.  I hope they come away richer, more textured, and more compassionate for it.  Yet here's my daughter announcing to an entire beach where we are among just a few other haoles that she is special because she is white.  I wanted to dig a sand hole with her little plastic shovel and crawl right into it.    In describing her as special I was meaning disadvantaged "special."  In this day of political correctness we use the word "special" in Special Education.  Special Education doesn't mean it is better or more elite.  In fact, if you want to get right down to it, it means disadvantaged.  There is no air of superiority surrounding a special ed class.  If you are in Special Ed it's because you just can't hack the regular ed.  We say quadriplegics are "special."  Nobody's envying them, right?    I remember a kid I went to kindergarten with, David.  David had horrible asthma and had to sit out games of kickball because he was "special."  We all knew that David wasn't "special" in a good way.  He was sickly and we sure as hell were glad we weren't him.  And this was back in the 70s before "special" hit its full stride.  But here I've got my "special" because she is white and lives on the equator and could get skin cancer or wrinkles without the protection of a high SPF daughter walking around telling all our various neighbors and local beach goers that she is special because she is white.  We're gonna be labeled "that KKK family."  I just know it.  I have visions of phone calls from her preschool teachers and angry parents of classmates.  She is a colorless girl living in a colored world.  And all I wanted to do was put her stinking sunblock on.  Maybe we should just stick to indoor activities.  Like mall walking.

      I had to go to Walmart this morning.  I had to go early because I wanted to get my Martha Stewart supplies to craft myself another glorious Mother's Day.  Read my post below for more on that.  We arrived around 8am.  I hadn't brushed my teeth or Reilly's hair, but we were there early and I planned on whizzing through the store like a bee in a flower bed and being back at the ranch before 10am.  That was the plan.  And ya know what they say about plans... the best laid plans of mice and housewives often go straight to hell.  I started off by going over to the t-shirt section. I needed to get some plain old white t-shirts.  As I am looking at the shirts, the bathing suits which were sinisterly displayed right behind me, caught my eye.  I really need a new suit since we have a beach date planned with some bikini clad skinny moms on Wednesday.  I look like a milk cow next to them, but at least if I had a new suit I could pretend like I fit in.    I was magnetically pulled over to the bathing suits with my daughter following behind me.  She was pushing a hand basket across the wood flooring, scraping and scratching it with each step she took.  "Reilly, please pick up the basket."  "No."  She no longer even pretends to obey me.    I was looking through bathing suits in sizes that a few years ago I didn't even know existed.  It was so depressing.  I wasn't in the mood to play around with my toddler and her shopping basket.  I leaned down to pick up the basket.  In an attempt to get away from my reach, she rammed my calf with it.    "Ouch!!"  I cried out in genuine pain.  "What's wrong, Mama?"  Her favorite question.  "You hit me with that basket.  Now give me that." I said and took the basket away.  "What's wrong, Mama?"  She asked again.  This question is only fun if asked a minimum of ten times preferably in a 30 second time span.  "I just told you what was wrong, Reilly.  Please, let me look at these bathing suits in quiet."  "What's wrong, Mama?"    "Please, Reilly."  "What's wrong, Mama?"  She continued on for about two minutes like this.  At about the one minute mark I quit playing.   Finally I found a couple of suits to try on and marched us all over to the fitting room.  As I was starting to undress, Reilly switched gears.  "Whatchya doing?" she asked.  "Trying on bathing suits." I informed her little inquisitive mind.  "Trying on bathing suits?" She was requesting confirmation.  Maybe I hadn't been as clear as I thought.  "Uh huh."  "Whatchya doing, Mama?"  This is her second favorite repetitive grilling.  This one also continues and is more fun when asked a minimum of 10 times in a 30 second time span.  "I just told you."  I wasn't going to fall into her toddler lair.  "Trying on bathing suits?"  I didn't respond.  I just fell silent and continued disrobing.  "Whatchya doing?  Whatchya doing, Mama?"  She continued, undaunted by my silence until she looked and saw Roman holding my bra up to his mouth.  "Roman!  Don't do that rrrrrriiiiight nooooow!!!!!  That's disgusting!!!" She ripped it out of his grasp so quickly that she didn't even have a good grip on it herself.  It tumbled onto the ground and slid across the freshly waxed, shiny tile floor of the changing room and landed, I assume, somewhere near the feet of the attendant who so kindly giggled and then handed it over the door to me.  With a new bathing suit in the basket that Reilly was now carrying despite the fact that it was almost half her height, we headed over to the craft aisle.  I needed felt for the inside of the never-to-be-made cigar box purses.  As I am looking around, Roman begins fussing.  I tried to sooth him by rocking the stroller a bit, but no dice.  I figured he was ready for a little morning nap so I flipped the back to the stroller to get him in a lying down position.  Unfortunately, the lever slid too quickly and fell backwards with a loud thunk and a shrieking cry.    All the other women in the craft department looked at me like I was Mommy Dearest or something.  I don't know what all those women were doing in the craft section at that hour in the morning anyway.  I don't know where  their  kids were.  But they were there, six of them, all shooting eye daggers in my direction.  One even gasped and then said to him, "Oh, my poor baby!"  Who's baby?  Who the hell are you, Miss Nosy Busy Body.  I picked up crying baby boy with the bonked head and that's when the smell hit me.  And every other nose in the joint.  He had a buttload of stink bomb poop in his diaper.    The same Miss Nosy Busy Body peeks over and says, "No wonder he was crying. I'd cry too if I had to sit in that."  Huh.  Then my daughter chimed in with her little rap that while painfully cute in the privacy of our own home is just plain painful in the craft section of Walmart at 8:30 in the morning with Miss Nosy Busy Body looking on.   "Who got the poops?  Say it!  Roman got the poops.  Roman got the poops.  Roman got the poops."    "How cute," drips Nosy Bee.  "Even your daughter is telling you to change his diaper."  I managed to squeak out a weak smile while positioning Roman so as to not leak the slimy, mustard yellow baby poop on my shirt.  I looked over at Reilly and she was now bouncing with her rhyme.    "Who's got the poops?  Say it!"  then she pointed to Nosy Bee who responded with,  "Roman's got the poops."    "Roman's got the poops.  Roman's got the poops."  The two, my traitor daughter and the childless Nosy Busy Body, rapped a poop duet to stinky, screaming, bonked head, dirty diaper boy with the unusually populated craft section looking on.      I clutched Reilly's hand mid rap and marched us all to the bathroom.  After I had Roman all cleaned up, I decided that it might be a good idea for Reilly Kate and I to use the toilet as well.  I put her on first amidst cries of "No!  Don't have to.  I can't do that right now!" and "I can't want to use the potty!!  I can't go pee pee!  I can't!"  There she sat as time ticked on and my bladder got fuller and fuller.  It is horrible to have to stand there waiting for your toddler to go while listening to other people going and toilets flushing and water running.  I swear one day I will wet my pants in that situation.    About five minutes into Reilly's toilet protest, a woman came in who had, from the sounds and smell of it, a bad case of diarrhea.  The poor woman must have been really suffering.  Public bathrooms echo horribly as it is, but this particular bathroom, located near the layaway counter in the dead middle of the store, has almost no privacy.  You can hear all that goes on inside from the outside.  Diarrhea woman let out volley number one followed by a courtesy flush.  The second volley hit the toilet as the smell of volley number one hit the air.  And then it hit Reilly.  "Mama!  Someone is pooping in here!!!" her voice smacked the walls and reverberated throughout the bathroom, echoing loud enough that the workers at the lay away counter heard it all, I'm sure.    "Yes, Roman did poop in here." I was hoping to redirect her attentions.  "No!  Not Roman.  Some lady.  She's in here.  She's pooping.  It's stinking.  Some lady got stinky poops."  I heard someone in the bathroom laugh.  I was crimson with embarrassment, my own and Diarrhea woman's.  "Roman did have stinky poops."  I'm not sure why I think I can pull this off.  Even if I succeeded in redirecting her attention, she speaks so clearly that no one would ever misunderstand her.  "Not Ro-MAN!  No!  Some lady.  Right there!" she pointed at the stall wall.  "Some lady right there has stinky poops.  I can hear 'em."  She loudly sniffed the air.  "I can smell 'em!!  Them's stinky!!"  There was more laughing from the bathroom.  I whispered in her ear in as harsh a tone a whisper will allow, "Stop that.  That isn't nice.  Just stop talking about it.  Please."  She whispered back, as loudly as a whisper will allow, "No.  Those are stinky poops.  I can smell 'em.  It's stinky in here."  Then back to her normal thunderous volume,  "Spray, Mama.  Spray in here!"   She pointed to some air freshener that was sitting on the toilet paper dispenser.  Unfortunately, it was empty.  There was nothing I could do at this point.  I quickly got her off the toilet and we left the bathroom with her talking about the stinky poops the whole time.  I, by the way, still had a full bladder having not yet used the toilet myself.  As we exit, there were some workers sitting on a bench next to the bathroom door laughing their heads off.  Reilly looked at them and pointed from where we just came.  "It's stinky in there.  Some lady's got some stinky poops in there.  Them's stinky!"   I pulled her arm and dragged her off as she was saying, "Spray's empty.  Mama's gonna buy some spray for that lady's stinky poops.  In there!!"  I didn't turn around, but I heard howling laughter behind me.  I just hoped that Diarrhea woman didn't work in Lay Away.  When we had almost completed our shopping trip, I told Reilly Kate that we could go through the toy department.  Reilly is very serious about toy shopping.  She went up to each toy that interested her and discussed it's merits.  "This one's blue."  "It's got dinosaurs on it." "The dog is pretty."  Then she saw it.  An African American baby doll with little pig tails and a purple back pack.  I immediately told her to put it back.  We have about 25 dolls at home and she plays with just one.  I was not about to buy and bring home another orphaned baby doll.  No way.  We were just about to get knee deep into toy negociations when I spotted Disney dress up dresses for $20.  My girlfriends have repeatedly told me to get Reilly Kate some dress up, pretend clothes and accessories.  "She'll play by herself for hours," they tell me.  "They may be expensive, but worth every penny," they reassure me.    I gravitated toward the Cinderella blue one with thoughts of a mini break this afternoon.  My vision is filled with Reilly in her room, dancing with an imaginary prince at a make believe ball while I miraculously craft the Mother's Day gifts together making the 4pm postal deadline.    With a far off, dream like look in my eyes, I ran my hand over the Snow White red and blue signature garment.  I only had one free hand, as I held a now clean diapered but still fussy Roman.  I balanced the Sleeping Beauty pink lacey sparkle gown on a pinky and the Cinderella shiny, pale blue one on my forefinger.  I turned toward Reilly and with a voice filled with hope and anticipation, I asked,  "Which princess gown would you like?  Cinderella or --"  I didn't get the chance to finish.  "No. I can't want that. I want my baby."  She cuddled the little baby doll with the purple backpack while glaring an evil glare at my hopeful handful of play garments.  I was losing my afternoon dream.  My chest started to tighten and my eyes filled with tears.  "No. No. No.  You want one of these.  You want one.  You like being the princess. These are princess dresses.  Here. We'll try one on you."  I quickly undid the velcro fasteners with trembling fingers and brimming eyes.  "I can't want that.  No!  No!  Aaaaahhhhh aaaaahhhhh...." She took off running at a break neck speed, racing against me through the toy aisles, dodging the books and stuffies strewn about.    I shifted Roman under my arm like a football, and chased after her with cheap taffeta and fake sequins flying along beside me.   "You love Cinderella!" I called out to her.  "Just try it on!!"  "My baby!!! My baby!! I want my baby" she answered, clinging desperately to the African American pigtailed doll as she sprinted through the video department.  I caught up with her over by electronics, right in front of the big screen TV's.  I held her tight between my knees since I had no free hands.  She was fighting like a crazed pig before the slaughter.  I had the Cinderella dress undone and ready to put over her bobbing head as she screeched.  "Please, no!!  I want my baby. No dress.  No Cinderella. NO!!!!"  A man's low, baritone voice stopped me as I was about to pop the pretend gown over her head.  "She don't want that."  I looked up and saw an old man standing in front of the biggest television in the store.  He was leaning against a rack of movies, wearing 100 year old flip flops and a t-shirt that read, "Eddie Would Go."    "She should watch this movie."  As he talked, I noticed that a couple of his front teeth were missing.  It made him lisp a little.  "It's like Hawaiian."  I stopped what I was doing and watched the screen.  It was a movie with ships and Russell Crowe.  I flipped through my memory banks and replied, "It's Master and Commander, isn't it?"  which is nothing like Hawaii, I wanted to add, but didn't.  "Yeah.  Just like Hawaii.  She don't want that thing.  You put it back.  She want to watch this movie.  It like Hawaii."  And that was that.  Reilly released the baby doll and I in turn released Reilly from the clutches of my knees.  I shoved the doll along with the dress up gowns in with the work out videos while Reilly sat in front of the huge television next to toothless, old Hawaiian dude.    "I told you.  She don't want that.  She like this movie."  He said again before drifting off to look at digital cameras.  I lured Reilly Kate away from the movie with the promise of a lollipop and we were back home a few minutes before noon.  So much for a quick, early morning Walmart trip, eh?

      Every damn year since Reilly Kate was born, I attempt to morph into Martha Stewart.  This year was no different.  No, I didn't do any insider trading or any other illegal activity.  I tried crafting some Mother's Day gifts.  It started out simple enough.  I was going to make a couple of nighties for my mom and grandma.  The plan was to put some pictures of the kids on t-shirt nightgowns.  I looked for months for the right kind of nighties, but could only find them on eBay for an outrageous sum of money.  I shelled out the cash only begrudgingly.  In my mind, crafting is not only supposed to personalize something.  It should also save you money.  I spent more than I intended and I still had to MAKE the damn things.  Then I got the brilliant idea to make totebags with the babes' photogenic mugs on them for their godmothers.  I bought the canvas bags, washed them as instructed and they literally fell apart.  I had to return them and buy different ones.  Sadly, after printing out all the iron ons, I discovered that the canvas bags that don't fall apart are too textured to receive an iron on.  The totes are now sitting in a pile under my bed.  The first Mother's Day of Reilly's life, I had done hand prints on polymer clay.  I decided that, in the interest of fairness, I needed to do the same for Roman's first Mother's Day. I bought the clay and brought it home.  I spent three hours kneading and rolling out, but the clay was too old and wouldn't soften up.  I had to take it back.  The teenager behind the counter said, "Nope.  It was a sale item.  All sales final.  It's old.  That's why it was on sale."  This I do not get.  I mean, if they were selling sushi could they just sell me rancid fish and forget about it?  I'm none too thrilled with this craft store.  Sadly, there aren't a lot of craft stores here for me to chose from.  I bought more of the stuff at full price and some liquid drops that supposedly soften old polymer clay.  It didn't' work.  I spent three more hours today kneading and rolling to no avail.  It is sitting in a technicolor clump in a ziplock baggy on my counter.  While at the craft store, I saw some cigar box purses.  I thought that I could do the kids' pictures on these instead of the tote bags.  I bought them at a hefty price.  Plus, there's the lacquer stuff.  Needed a gallon jug of that at a whopping price.  Lugged all that crap home to find the hinges on the purses broken and no good.  I'll have take those back to the same crap... I mean craft store.     At this point now I have no gifts for the godmothers.  I went today to Walmart and bought 80 more bucks worth of crafting supplies in an attempt to rectify some sort of gift for someone.  I got more iron on sheets and some t-shirts.  When I got them home, I realized I had bought the wrong iron ons.  I needed the sheets for white t-shirts.  These are for black shirts.  Oh, and I bought a coloring kit.  It has special paper and crayons and the kids can color it and then you iron it onto a shirt. I thought I'd do this for my mom's nightie.  Nope.  RK peeled all the labels off the crayons, broke most of them in half, and then mixed them up with her other crayons in her coloring box.  I'm not about to go through 457 crayons and crayon bits in an attempt to locate which are the special iron on crayons.  Another 15 bucks down the tubes.  So far, I'm down about 200 American greenbacks with nothing to send out for Mother's Day.  If you are some sort of maternal relation to my children, well, this is for you:  Happy Mother's Day.  I'll be wearing my I [Heart] Mom shirt on Sunday just for you.   That's all your getting.  Martha's in jail and I'm done.

      For some reason, I thought Roman would take to food much quicker and with more enthusiasm than Reilly Kate did.  I don't know why I thought this. I guess because he is a boy.  I figured that he would grow big and strong and eat whole tomatoes like his father before him.    I was wrong.  Very, very wrong.    Quite to the contrary, Roman's reaction to his first bit of food was actually much worse than Reilly's first bite.  She wasn't that interested, focused more on the picture of a rocking horse on her high chair than the spoon I was shoving in her mouth.  She pushed the rice cereal gruel out of her mouth with her tongue, but opened her mouth up for the next bite to push out.  Eventually, after weeks of this, she clammed her mouth shut to food and didn't open it again until she was almost a year old.  But at least for a small period of time, she willingly allowed food to enter her system.  Last week Roman turned 5 months and I bought a box of rice cereal.  I excitedly milked myself into a bowl (no, that is not a typo -- I did MILK myself -- think cow and pail but the cow has hands and no need of the farmer), mixed my milk with some of the cereal to form a soupy gruel, lined up the cameras, and spooned him his first bite of food.  Immediately, his face skewed up into a grimace as if I had just put a rotten, sour lemon into his mouth.  He pushed it all out of his mouth and let out a whine.  Undeterred, I tried again.  Again, he pushed it out and let out a bigger whine.  His facial expression had turned from a grimace into a look of pain.  I got concerned that perhaps there was something wrong with it so I took a bite.  No, nothing wrong with it provided you are a fan of raw human breastmilk -- which most assuredly Roman is.  I tried for a third time.  This time he shrieked, grabbed the spoon with his right hand, my hair in left and yanked hard on both.  I pried open the hand with my hair, worried that he might pull it out leaving me with a nice bald patch.  While I was occupied with that, Roman took the opportunity to steal the full spoon away from me.  Once I had my hair back, he looked right at me and flung the spoon across the room.  The soupy mess went flying all over the kitchen, dining area and even into the livingroom.  Again, Truman McFatty (the ever dieting dachshund) was there to lend a hand with the clean up.  I'm thinking that Roman is not so crazy about rice cereal.  Next I'm gonna try bananas.  Truman likes bananas, I think.

      On Sunday I was given a another Mom's Day (lucky me).  I took a nice long bath, shaved my legs, put on some nice clothes and make up then went to a showing of Michael Moore's  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 .  In a word it was wickedly entertaining.  Okay.  So that was two words.  Are you really counting?  As one might predict, I will leave the tales of housewifery for another day and indulge myself and perhaps a few readers in the ramblings of a former politico.  After all, I have been a liberal a lot longer than I have been a mom, and I've been politically minded longer than I have been a liberal.  It's in the blood.  After 12 years of Clinton bashing conservatives shouting over everyone about murder conspiracies and sex scandals, I am, of course, thrilled to see a film that puts them on the defense.  I've listened to enough Rush Limbaugh, Oliver North, and Bill O'Reilly to tell you that they had it coming.  Oh, they so had it coming.  To actually lump Michael Moore and his film in with these neocon clowns would be a drastic mischaracterization.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a far, far cry from the  urlLink Clinton Chronicles .  One could label it as left wing spin, but it certainly isn't filled with misleading information, outright lies, and preposterous conspiracy theories like the garbage that came from the right during the 90s (and still continues to this day).    Why is it that we now have a cable news channel dedicated to broadcasting right wing propaganda all day long ( urlLink Fox News ) and that doesn't sound any federal election violation alarm bells.  But when a movie is made unveiling the buffoonish nature of our commander in chief, suddenly the FEC is called in to rule on whether the ads for the movie are in some way  campaign  ads.  It's because they are scared.  The fact is that Moore is brilliant as an entertainer.  He creates some hilarious bits throughout the movie (like reading the Patriot Act to Congress from an ice cream truck), edits sound bites down to snippets, and verbally ambushes people to catch them off guard.  And yet, the truth is there in plain light for us all to see.  The truth is that the president  did  sit in that classroom for 7 full minutes after hearing the words "America is under attack."  It really doesn't matter how Moore edited those 7 minutes or what he voiced over the footage.  Watching Bush sit there reading "My Pet Goat" is enough for any halfwit to figure out that the leader of the free world was completely clueless as to what to do next.    Moore's sneak attack on Congressmen asking them to enlist their children in the Army is high comedy.  Seeing these wealthy elitists repulse the very thought of it is, for this military wife, giggle inducing.  Is it fair that Moore does this?  Perhaps not.  But is it fair that of all the Congressmen on th Hill only one has a child serving in Iraq?  Is it fair that the poor are expected to go out and fight wars that make the rich richer?  And what about Lila Lipscomb of Michael Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan who's son died in Iraq.  Is her pain any less real because Moore edited it into his film?  Because he showcased her and her family's loss is it somehow plastic grief?  No, it's real pain.  Something that the Bush administration doesn't want the voters here to be reminded of.  It is no wonder we don't see pictures of flag draped coffins or grieving widows held up by uncomfortable sargeants bearing grave news.  It's horribly easy to forget what's going on if we aren't bombarded with it every day.  This country is becoming more and more divided.  But don't blame Michael Moore or his movies.  Look at people like  urlLink Ann Coulter  whose books are not meant to entertain but to misinform.  Look at a president who jokingly refers to "his [political] base" as "the haves and the have mores."  Or to a news network who doesn't even make an attempt at unbiased coverage.  Anyway, go see the movie.  Enjoy it.  Take it in as you would an op/ed piece in the Sunday paper.  Glean from it some useful information, laugh at its brilliant humor, and cry at the heartbreak of a nation led into an unjust war by an undemocratically elected president in well over his head.  And if you still vote for Bush this November, I've got a beach here in Hawaii I'd like to sell you.

      We're in the midst of a mega family invasion.  My parents brought my neice here as her eighth grade graduation gift and my dad's cousin, her husband, and their three children are also here on our island paradise from Altoona, Pennsylvania.  Things are hectic, but fun and full of love.  Since I don't live near any family, I am always moved by the love I am enveloped in when they come to see us.  It's a warm and fuzzy, cozy kind of thing to see my children cared for by family they hardly know and rarely see.  Love truly is a wonderful thing.  On Father's Day we attended mass at Hickam Air Force Base.  During a quiet lull, my daughter who was sitting on my dad's lap, announces, "Pap's got dirty ears.  He didn't take a bath. Him's dirty.  He needs to take a bath!"  My poor dad heard all the people behind him tittering as the priest began to pray.    We later tried to explain to her that Pap indeed did take a bath and that his ears were not in fact dirty.  That what she thought was dirt was really hair.  But she didn't buy it.  "No.  No hair in ears.  Them's dirty!"  It would seem that my poor dad is the target of her comedic lashings.  She later announced, "Pap's got no muscles.  He needs to get some muscles."  And when asked why he has no muscles, she replied matter of factly, "Cuz he's got diarrhea in his pants!"  Oh, yes.  I see clearly, now, thank you.  Family bonding.  Insults and potty talk.  What could be more binding?  How 'bout a baptism with baby poop?  Roman had a total baby poop blow out, landing some of his excrement on his 12 year old cousin Katelyn and her mom, Lauri.  All three of them had poop everywhere.  Roman had it all the way up to his neck.  Katie had it on her swimming suit.  Lauri was still finding baby poop on her clothes and hands hours later, despite a good nurse's scrubbing (she's a NICU nurse) in hot soapy water.  It's a good family trip.  We're all feeling the love.  And who wouldn't with words and poop like that?

      Tonight, before saying night time prayers, Reilly Kate and I lit up a guardian angel candle that I'd bought Roman for his christening.  We had some extra special prayers to send up tonight, so the candle was important.  And Reilly was very impressed.  Immediately, once it was lit, she began singing Happy Birthday.  In her years of experience (2 years to be exact), candles are lit when birthdays are celebrated.  No matter I had been telling her that we would light the candle to give our prayers that little added something.  She still thought "Birthday."  I stopped her and then said, "Ni-Night prayers, Baby.  Let's start..."  The she clasped her hands together and put her chin to her fingers and began:    "Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep Angels watch me through the night And wake me with the morning light."  As always, she closed with:  "God bless GG.  Make her well.  Amen."  Then I told her we had to say some additional prayers for GG since she is really not feeling very well.  For those that don't know, "GG" is my Grandma Mallow ("GG" stands for "Great Grandma"). And GG is quite ill with a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome heading into leukemia.  She's been in the hospital for a week and we will find out tomorrow whether she'll be able to go home and continue with her current medicinal regiment or whether she'll be staying in the hospital for a month long mega-chemo session.   When I talked to her today, her sole request was to "keep those prayer wheels spinning."  So as promised, here I knelt with my young child in front of a burning candle, rusty on prayer, rustier on faith, and feeling a bit awkward.  "Please, God, help GG feel better," I prayed and prodded.  "Reilly, would you like to pray for GG, too?"  "God bless GG.  Make her well," was her response, eyes wide and focused on the candle's flame, looking a little unsure.  "Yes, make her well.  We love her and want her around for boat rides and golfing, buttons and the chicken dance, vacations to the far East and Ireland and snorkeling, gardening and quilting, floating in the lake..." my mind drifted off and I paused for a moment to choke back all the things still left to do with my daughter and her GG.    "God bless GG.  Make her well," she repeated with familiarity and uncertainty.  She saw my eyes welling up with tears.  This certainly was not our usual night time prayers.  I took a deep breath, then, and searched for words to explain to Reilly Kate that we had one more important prayer to add.  My friend Tami had just attended a memorial service in a labor and delivery room.  A baby boy whose family attends Tami's church was born still.  He never saw the world, the bright lights, the vivid colors.  He never took a breath.  He never cried.  Or laughed.  He never would look up at his Mama with a milky smile and a poopy diaper.  He would never grow to be a man.  How do you tell that to a young child?  "We need to pray for Baby Louie, Reilly Kate.  Baby Louie had to go to heaven to be with God and his mama and daddy and sisters are very sad because they miss him," I explained.  "Uh huh.  Them's sad."  Reilly Kate, hands still clasped in prayer, nodded.  "Yes, they are.  But we need to pray that their sadness goes away because baby Louie is in a good place with God.  Even though they will always miss him, we pray that their sadness goes away."  I felt like I was fumbling.  Not sure what to pray for or how to relate it to a child as young and tender as Reilly.  "Uh huh.  Them's sad."   I had her then bless herself and blow out the candle.  I thought she would be excited about blowing out the candle, but she remained somber and quiet.  As she hopped into bed, she looked at me and with a huge smile asked, "GG feel better now, Mama?"  "Oh, I don't know, Reilly Kate.  I hope so.  But I'm not sure."  "Yeah.  Yeah, she feels better.  She feels better."  She responded with a confidence that one could only describe as faith.  Pure and untarnished faith.  A faith I haven't seen or felt in a long, long time.  "And Baby Louie," she added, "He's with Jesus now.  His Mama Daddy not sad anymore.   He's with Jesus.  Them's happy."  With her faith wrapped warmly around her, she cuddled her dolly and snuggled down into her bed.  In minutes she was peacefully asleep.  To her, all is right with the world.    And really it is.

      I hate bad drivers.  Before I had kids, bad drivers only irritated me, eliciting a string of profanity the likes of which would make a rapper blush.  Now that I travel with my most precious cargo every single day, I hate them.  And I mean "hate" with all that goes with the word.  Not as in "I hate swiss cheese" or "I hate my hair."  I mean "hate" as in I wish a pox upon their house.  Do you realize that every car passing you on the road, or traveling along side you, or behind you, even if for just a split second, has your life in their hands?  I cannot help but think of that.  I cannot even see their face, but I appreciate them driving responsibly so that my children can see another day.    When I was a teen, I used to make fun of those stupid "Baby on Board" signs that were so popular with parents in the 80s.  What the hell is that supposed to mean? I wondered.  Should I actually be more careful around that car than I normally would?  Ummmm... HELL FUCKING YEAH!  There's a BABY in the car!!!  Kids just don't get it.  I wasn't paying any attention when I was driving.  I was too busy checking the mirror to see if my AquaNet was withstanding the wind from my open window.  Or wondering which of my Swatches had the correct time while cranking up my Beastie Boys tape.  Or spritzing myself with Giorgio perfume despite the lit cigarette hanging from my mouth.   I'm sick of the drag racing. I'm sick of seeing cars with kids in control, driving out of control, at 90 or 100 miles an hour.  Fuck the Fast and the Furious.  I'm FAT and I'm FURIOUS and I'd like to kick some puny little teenage ass every time I'm forced to plead to GOD to spare my family from a fiery death.    The fact is the legal minimum driving age should be raised to 18, with an automatic suspension till 21 for anyone getting a moving violation.  Even for just 5 miles over the speed limit.  End of story.  And while we're on the topic of age, let's talk about the living dead out there behind the wheel.  With all due respect for the elderly, they should not be driving.  How many times have you been stuck behind a Cadillac the size of a Hummer doing 25 in a 55?  Or been cut off by a tiny ancient barely peeking over the steering wheel?  If they cannot read the menu at Denny's because they forgot their reading glasses at home, they shouldn't be driving to the Denny's in the first place.  Look, they raised their children in a much safer, more secure world than I'm raising mine.  Their grandparents weren't out careening through the neighborhood while their kids were riding bikes.  They should relinquish their license with dignity rather than have it forcibly taken from them after they mixed up the brake and the gas pedals.  Make the maximum age limit for driving 75 and give them all free bus passes.  Especially before those baby boomers all hit the road in their 80s.  I dread the thought of my parents cruising in a convertible with the Beach Boys blaring, unable to see the signs or the road or even the speedometer.  The worst offenders, however, are those that drive drunk.  Many of us have done it.  I did it once and will never, ever do it again.  I only drove less than a mile away but it was the scariest thing I've ever done.  No control whatsoever.  No matter how hard I tried to stay within my lane, I swerved.  And I wasn't even that drunk.  A couple of months ago, we took Reilly Kate and Roman to the zoo down in Waikiki.  As we were walking back to our car, a drunken man walked by.  He was so inebriated that he could not walk.  He fell down, stumbled on the grass, and criss crossed his feet as he went.  Mike and I said it was a good thing he was walking and not driving, but then we saw him reach into his pocket and retrieve his keys.  I was in such a state of rage I had to stop myself from stomping my hooves and charging him with the full force of my weight.  The only thing that really did stop me was Mike.  He kept insisting that there was no way a man that drunk would actually pull out and drive.  But then he did.  Drunk man started his car, pulled it out of its parking space, and drove off.    I called the cops with his license plate number and the direction he was heading.  They didn't find him.  Of course, they didn't.  I doubt they even put much effort into finding him.  You know if I hadn't put the full buck-25 into the meter, I'd be sitting on a ticket.  But the drunk, he drives home to sleep it off, free and clear.  People who drink and drive should be punished.  And the punishment should fit the crime.  It should be so stiff that no one would ever consider it.  The police officers should be more concerned about drunk drivers than prostitutes and johns.  Whores and the middle aged, fat, bald men that enjoy them are amusing.  Drunks and cars are lethal.   Everyone wants to get rich quick, right?  But very few people rob banks.  Wanna know why?  Because you go to jail for a very long time if you rob a bank.  There isn't this, "Oh, it's a first offense" crap.  You go to PRISON for even just TRYING to take a bank's money.  So why the excuses for drunk drivers?  Why are they allowed to go and do it again and again?  Why is robbing a bank a bigger crime than driving drunk, I ask you?  This is what I propose:  First offense, you lose your license for 5 full years automatically.  Second offense, you go to jail for 5 full years, no parole.  And the third time you get caught drunk behind the wheel of a car you go to jail for the rest of your natural life.  So that's my rant.  Driving.  The young.  The old. The drunk.  I've been young and drunk.  I plan on being old and drunk.  And I plan on robbing a bank to pay for my chauffeur driven Lincoln Continental.

      There is little doubt, in my mind at least, that motherhood is fattening.  And as far as I know, there is no low carb version.  I was never really fat until becoming a mother.  Sure, I had had an encounter or two (more like 23) with unfriendly scales before, but it took motherhood to get me my membership in the Obesity Club.  It all started when I got that plus sign on the pregnancy test.  I was so excited that I simply had to celebrate with my two best buds: Ben & Jerry.  I didn't toast with champagne, instead I ate two pints of Chunky Monkey with a Chubby Hubby chaser.  Afterall, I did need to increase my calcium intake.  Strong bones and teeth and all that.  I quit smoking cold turkey so I also quit running.  The way I saw it, if I was no longer slowly poisoning my cardiovascular system with tobacco, then there was no need for me to kill myself on a treadmill.  I was even steven.  Besides, pregnancy has it's own aches and pains.  Why add to it with all that needless exercise?  When the queasiness of morning sickness popped in on me, I treated it to a full on banquet.  I stuffed everything in my mouth.  Nothing was too heavy or greasy for this sufferer.  Most people when sick to their stomach refuse to eat or they eat lightly.  No, not me.  When sick, I must eat, and eat  good  food.  I once spent the night in the ER hooked up to IV fluids since I couldn't keep even water down.  When discharged, I went home and demanded my mom order me a pizza.    "No," she said incredulously.  "You can have some broth and saltines."  I negociated my way up to a package of ramen noodles to which I added some ham and two slices of cheese when she wasn't looking.  I also grabbed several Pop Tarts, a box of Little Debbie brownies, and some Cheezits for dessert.  Hey, I was sick!  I needed to feel better and some shitty hot water bullion and crackers made of dried paste just wasn't going to cut it.  It didn't cut it when I was a kid with the stomach flu and it didn't cut it when I was (almost) a mom and miserable from the HCG poisoning my body suffered from for the first 13 weeks of pregnancy.  I basically ate nonstop right through the first trimester.  Oh, and forget diet pop.  No way was I going to expose my precious unborn child to potentially harmful chemicals.  Instead, I drank so much high fructose corn syrup that my pancreas went into shock I and developed Gestational Diabetes.  No surprise then, that precious babe was born so fat that she didn't need to gain any weight for 6 full weeks.  I gained 10lbs every month.  Month after month, for nine full months.  You do that math.  I was so big that when my friend Holly came to visit us, her husband Ron took one look at me and said, "Well, I guess we don't have to go anywhere for whale watching."    When I went home for my baby shower, my great, great, great aunt Doris (thin as a rail since she never had children) greeted everyone as they walked in the door with, "Look out!  She's as big as a house!" whispered as loud as a lion's roar.  She later embraced me in a fragile hug and said, "Don't worry, honey.  That weight'll come right off.  I've seen 'em all blow up like you.  Well, maybe not that big.  But they lost the weight.  You will, too."  And that's where they get you.  Everyone tells you that the weight will just "melt right off" after the baby is born.  Especially if you are breastfeeding.  Weightloss is touted as one of the magic benefits to breastfeeding by that lying Le Leche League.  Yeah, right.  And my tits are the size of mosquito bites and produce White Russians after 9pm.  The truth is that a nursing mother's body holds on to fat "like a bulldog to a bone," as my friend Michelle puts it.  You could eat nothing but lettuce and egg whites, exercise like an Olympic athlete in training, and pump yourself up on caffeine.  The only results you'll see is stomach upset, shin splints, and a cranky baby that only sleeps 10 minutes at a time due to the caffe latte coming from your udders.   It's some kind of evolved protection mechanism, to safeguard against famine.  Fat is like money in the bank and I got lots of twinkie investments stored up on my ass just in case the locusts descend upon Safeway.  My offspring and I could live off the interest of Doritos and Cherry Garcia for six complete months.  I guess I can take pride that in a "survival of the fittest" world, I would beat out Deborah Messing or Gwyneth Paltrow.  They and their offspring would shrivel and turn to dust since they didn't bank their food.  Silly ninnies.  There are those who encourage mothers to embrace and celebrate their new, softer, rounder bodies.  I will admit that if I were my child I would love that saggy piece of flesh that once was my abdomen.  It's so soft it's almost fluffy and makes the perfect pillow for watching Dora the Explorer.  I, however, am less than pleased.  I am not a pillow, I am a person.  I may be a mother, but I am also a woman who wants to be attractive.  I am human and I seek approval from society.  I need to be a normal weight.  I need to be a normal size again.  The time has come to buckle down.  All this extra baggage around my middle is only going to come off one way and it will be a hard road to success.  I know if I just stay the course, be persistent, unrelenting, and determined, I can achieve my dream.  Our dream.  The Fat Mamas' Dream.  We overweight mothers need to band together and work toward one goal:  Government Funded Plastic Surgery!!!  Ha.  You thought I was going to say "lose weight."  Like I said, that ain't happening.  Been there.  Done that.  Got the stretchmarks.  That weight isn't going to just melt off.  As long as I'm still nursing, the only thing that is melting around here is my Ben & Jerry's Half Baked.  I need to learn to eat quicker.

      Ya know, when one person in the house is sick or in some way incapacitated (such as Mike with this back thing), it throws everything off in the household.  It is like getting lost in your own neighborhood and you're not sure where the map is.  That's how I feel, at least.  Laundry piles up, dishes sit in the sink, and the kids are restless.    But we're plugging along.  Mike's back is still pretty bad and he's losing patience with it.  I feel for him.  I do.  Reilly Kate is... well... Reilly Kate.  Her newest bizarre thing is slapping my stomach and saying, "Fat belly.  Fat belly.  Fat belly."  I guess that is supposed to be motivating.  I downed three pints of Ben and Jerry's this weekend, though, so I'm not sure how effective she's really being.  She's started learning to steer her tricycle which is a huge relief to me.  I was starting to think she'd be 27 and still on training wheels, crashing into garbage cans while singing Twinkle Twinkle and wondering why the bike doesn't steer itself.    Roman is just about ready to crawl.  He's on the cusp of it.  He's mobile now with his scooting and rolling.  But the crawling is just a couple weeks off.  It seems he was slow to start, but he's exploded in development all of a sudden.  I'm convinced he is going to be painfully shy.  Today when faced with a baby girl a couple days older, he responded to her infant wails of joy with true, fearful tears.  He just cried and cried.  After comforting him, I sat him back up near her and he put his head down to his toes and cried some more.  Poor thing.  Girls scare him.  Of course they do.  Look at his sister.  I'd be scared too if she was the only girl I'd ever experienced.    Anyway, like I said.  It's hard to get back into the swing.  Hopefully, we will soon and I'll be back to regular posting on this here blog.  Oh, I might have made a new friend this weekend.  Stay tuned for that story.  It's a good one.

      I've come to the realization that in order for me to get a proper vacation (that is one that includes actual rest and relaxation) I will need a full body cast.    How I plan on acquiring said cast is still in the works, but I'm thinking that a Christmas ski trip might be my answer.  I'll have to jump off the ski lift, of course.  And it'll have to be on the first trip up the mountain.  If I wait at all, I run the risk of Mike somehow legitimately injuring himself while skiing, blowing all chances of any relaxation for myself.  With my luck, however, the doctor will crook my arms for baby holding, leave my hands free so I can wipe snotty noses and poopy behinds, and cast around my nipples so the baby can still nurse.  Mike would have to cook meaning we'd be eating grilled meat and over nuked tv dinners.  Reilly Kate would use me as a jungle gym and Roman would get slobber deep into my cast.  The laundry would pile up so high that I wouldn't be able to see the television and I'd probably gain 20 pounds.  On second thought, I think I'll just shave my head and join the Hare Krishnas.

      All who know me, know that I have the gift of the gab.&nbsp; But my dear, dear daughter is outshining me in this category.&nbsp; As I was driving down the road, clinging to my small shred of sanity like a dieter to a crumb cake, it occurred to me to share this with you.&nbsp; So here, to the best of my recollection, is a brief snippet of our conversation:   RK:&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; Mama?   Me:&nbsp; Yes.   RK:&nbsp; I need my teddy bear.&nbsp; Where's my teddy bear?&nbsp; My pink teddy bear.&nbsp; Where is it?&nbsp; I need it.&nbsp; Where is it?   Me:&nbsp; I don't --   RK:  (interrupting, not waiting for my response) &nbsp; It's at home.&nbsp; Turn this car around.&nbsp; Go home.&nbsp; I need my bear.&nbsp; Where is my bear?&nbsp; My pink teddy bear?&nbsp; Where is him?&nbsp; I need him.&nbsp; He's at home.&nbsp; Let's go home.&nbsp; Turn the car around NOW!&nbsp; Go home.&nbsp; Hooooooooome. ( starts crying and kicking the back of my seat as I'm driving) .&nbsp; Hooooooooome.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hooooooooome.&nbsp; I neeeeeeed my teddy bear.&nbsp;   Me:&nbsp; We're not going home.   RK:&nbsp; We're going home. YEAH!&nbsp; YEAH!&nbsp; We're going home. YEAH!&nbsp;  (kicks the back of my seat for emphasis)    Me:&nbsp; Do not kick my seat, please.   RK:&nbsp;  (continues kicking) &nbsp; I need my bear.&nbsp; Where's him?&nbsp; He's at home.&nbsp; We're going home.&nbsp; YEAH!&nbsp; I'm thirsty.&nbsp; I'm thirsty.&nbsp; I need some juice.&nbsp; Mama!&nbsp; I'm thirsty.&nbsp; I'm thirsty.&nbsp; I have a headache.&nbsp; I need some juice.   Me:&nbsp; You will get juice if you stop kicking me.   RK:&nbsp;  (kicks)  I neeeeeed juice!&nbsp; Gimme juice.&nbsp; I need some.&nbsp; I need it.&nbsp; I need juice.&nbsp; I have a headache.&nbsp; I need some water.&nbsp; I need water.&nbsp; Can I have some water now?&nbsp; I'm thirsty.&nbsp; I have a tummy ache.&nbsp; I'm hungry.&nbsp; I need some food.&nbsp; I need some crackers.&nbsp; Gimme some crackers.... PLEASE!&nbsp; Please, I need some crackers.    (I hand her a handful of crackers)    RK:&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I need just one cracker.&nbsp; Take these.&nbsp; I need ONE.&nbsp; Just ONE.&nbsp; One cracker.&nbsp;  (eats her cracker) &nbsp; Where're we going?&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; Mama, where're we going?&nbsp; Are we going home?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; We're not going home.&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; Where are we going?   Me:&nbsp; To the clinic.&nbsp; I need to get a blood test.   RK:&nbsp; To the clinic?&nbsp; Are we going to the clinic?&nbsp; We're not going home?&nbsp; We're going to the clinic?&nbsp; You need a test?&nbsp; You gonna get a shot?&nbsp; It's gonna hurt.&nbsp; You're gonna get a hurt.&nbsp; You are gonna get a boo boo.&nbsp; It's gonna hurt.&nbsp; I'm not getting a shot.&nbsp; Are you getting a shot?&nbsp; I'm getting a shot.&nbsp; The doctor's giving me a shot in the stomach because I have a stomach ache.&nbsp; I have a stomach ache.&nbsp; We're going to the doctor to get a shot for my stomach ache?&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp;   Me:&nbsp; No.   RK:&nbsp; Whatchya doing?&nbsp; Driving?&nbsp; Driving to the clinic?&nbsp; To get my stomach out?&nbsp; Is it raining?&nbsp; I see raining.&nbsp; It's raining.&nbsp; Them's storm clouds?&nbsp; Yeah, them's storm clouds.&nbsp; I see 'em.&nbsp; I don't look at the sun.&nbsp; The sun is bright.&nbsp; I don't have sungasses.&nbsp; Where's my sungasses?&nbsp; I need 'em.&nbsp; I don't look at the sun.&nbsp; I see the moon. There's the moon.&nbsp; He's sleeping.&nbsp; I'm not looking at the sun, though.&nbsp; I see the clouds.&nbsp; It's raining.&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; Is it raining?&nbsp; Where're we going?   Me:&nbsp; To the clinic.   RK:&nbsp; To the clinic?&nbsp; Where's Daddy?&nbsp; He's at the clinic?&nbsp; No, he's at work.&nbsp; He's in there?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; Is it raining?   Me:&nbsp; Please, for just 5 minutes, shut your mouth and be quiet.   RK:&nbsp;  (silent for&nbsp;a count of 20 then in whispered voice) &nbsp; Are you driving?&nbsp;&nbsp;I can drive.&nbsp;   Me:&nbsp; Reilly, please be quiet for just one minute.   RK:&nbsp;  (in a normal voice)  I did already.&nbsp; I did be quiet. I'm gonna be loudy.&nbsp; I'm loudy.&nbsp;  (screams)  Loudy.&nbsp;  (screams again) &nbsp; I'm gonna be loudy.&nbsp; I did be quiet but now I'm loudy.&nbsp; My teddy bear's not here. He's at home.&nbsp; We're not going home. We're going to the clinic.&nbsp; We're going to get my stomach out.&nbsp; Brother's not going to get a shot.&nbsp; I'm getting a shot.&nbsp; Are we driving?&nbsp; Are we driving in the rain?&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; Are we driving?&nbsp; I wanna get down.&nbsp; I'm done.&nbsp; I wanna get doooooooown!  (whining now)  I'm DONE!!! I'm DONE!!!&nbsp; I'm DONE!!!   Me:&nbsp; You can't get down till the car has stopped.   RK:&nbsp; The car is stopped.&nbsp; The car is stopped.&nbsp; Is the car stopped?&nbsp; We're driving to the clinic?&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; I want some fruity snacks.&nbsp; I want some fruity snacks.  (now singing)  I want some fruity snacks.&nbsp; I want some fruity snacks.  (getting louder)  I want some fruity snacks!&nbsp; I want some fruity snacks! I WANT SOME FRUITY SNACKS!!!   Me:&nbsp; We don't have any.   RK:&nbsp; I want some.&nbsp; I want some fruity snacks. We have some.&nbsp; We have fruity snacks.&nbsp; I want some.&nbsp; Whatchya talk to, Mama?   Me:&nbsp; Bad drivers.   RK:&nbsp; Bad drivers?&nbsp; Them's bad drivers?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; I see them.&nbsp; Bad drivers. You talked bad drivers?&nbsp; Mama?&nbsp; I see them.&nbsp; Them's bad.&nbsp; I have a tummy ache.&nbsp; I have a tummy ache.&nbsp; I want some fruity snacks.&nbsp; I need some.&nbsp; I want some.&nbsp; Where's Daddy?   Me:&nbsp; Reilly, you need to use your ears more and your mouth less.   RK:&nbsp; Yeah,&nbsp; I need to use my ears.&nbsp; I use 'em.&nbsp; Them's there.&nbsp; I can't eat them.&nbsp; I can't eat my ears.&nbsp; I can eat my lips.&nbsp; I can eat my boogers.&nbsp; I can't eat my ears.&nbsp; I have ears, though. I can't use 'em.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Need I go on?&nbsp;   The funny part is when strangers come up to the cute little thing.&nbsp; Like at the clinic.&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman came up to her and started a conversation simply by saying, "Is that your brother?"&nbsp; And Reilly Kate says:   "Yeah.&nbsp; I have an eyeball.&nbsp; I have an armpit.&nbsp; Brother has poops.&nbsp; Mama got a shot.&nbsp; Did you get a shot?&nbsp; It's a boo boo.&nbsp; The doctor's gonna take out my stomach.&nbsp; I can't take off my fingers.&nbsp; Them's stuck.&nbsp;  (pulling her fingers) &nbsp; I can't get them off.&nbsp; I can't get off my head.&nbsp; My neck is stuck  (pulls on her neck) &nbsp; I can't get my head off my neck.&nbsp; I have a throat.&nbsp; And a stomach. &nbsp;I have fruity snacks but my pink teddy bear is at home.&nbsp; Mama won't drive back home.&nbsp; My daddy is at work.&nbsp; His back hurts.&nbsp; He's got a bad back.&nbsp; My baby poked my eyeball.&nbsp; I have an eyeball."   I'm thinking perhaps she can get a job in talk radio.&nbsp; I listened to that dick Hannity today and Reilly Kate actually made more sense.&nbsp; Maybe Hannity ate his ears.&nbsp; Ya think?

      It's been a pretty crappy day.&nbsp; My van broke down and needed a new starter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Mike was in a car accident that pretty much totaled our convertible (yes, he's okay).&nbsp; Like I said, it's been a pretty crappy day.   But I heard something on the radio (NPR) this morning, something that is making me appreciate today.&nbsp; The piece was entitled urlLink  Remembering Lt. Brian Smith  (click on that link and you can listen to it).&nbsp; After 9-11, a&nbsp;30 year old lawyer from Austin, Texas joined the military, leaving his lucrative career and wife behind.&nbsp; He was killed last week.&nbsp; He was checking the tracks on his tank when he lifted his arm and&nbsp;a sniper shot him in the one spot that the bullet proof vest didn't protect him --&nbsp;under his arm.&nbsp; As his father said, "He had everything to lose."&nbsp; And it seems, he lost it all.   Like a toned down Pat Tillman, Brian Smith truly put his patriotism on his chest.&nbsp; He walked his talk.&nbsp; He carried the torch.&nbsp; He sacrificed.&nbsp; It amazes me how many in my generation are unwilling to do anything more than flap their gums.&nbsp; They've got opinions, but aren't even motivated enough to vote.&nbsp; It seems Brian Smith was different.&nbsp; Although, I never even knew he walked the earth until he no longer did, my heart seems a little empty with the knowledge of his passing.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;think of&nbsp;him over the years.&nbsp; I won't forget him.&nbsp; He left his mark.   As a mother, my heart just breaks.&nbsp; I cannot imagine the heartache his mother must be feeling.&nbsp; Just trying to brings a lump to my throat so big I cannot swallow it down.&nbsp; I read this quote from his dad on a message board.   "We were lucky enough to love him for 30 years, and I lived long enough to see the man he grew up to become," William Smith said. "I'm glad I did ... now I have the rest of my life to miss him."   I'm&nbsp;the wife&nbsp;of a&nbsp;soldier.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of my husband going off to war terrifies me.&nbsp; It is something that we, military wives, must&nbsp;visualize, plan for, and cope with.&nbsp; We've done the funeral plans and insurance papers.&nbsp; All the what ifs have been&nbsp;covered, especially given these turbulent times.&nbsp; It knots my insides, but it's part of the job description.&nbsp;   The prospect of doing this with my son, however, grips me&nbsp;deeply from within, making my head spin so fast I can hear insanity rattling around.&nbsp; Last week, my brother Darrell left for Iraq.&nbsp; His mother, my stepmother, told me that planning his funeral was "just unnatural.&nbsp; A mother shouldn't have&nbsp;to&nbsp;sit down with her son and plan his funeral."&nbsp; Even the planning must be heart wrenching, something from which, even when he comes back to us safe and sound, she will never fully recover.&nbsp; Such is it to be a mother.&nbsp; Strong, but so very, very fragile.   As I type this, I have my sleeping son in my arms.&nbsp; He is safe and sound and just a wee little baby.&nbsp; Yet all too soon he will be a man, with wild ideas of his own.&nbsp; Too soon he will leave the safety of my nest to venture forth in the big bad world to be big and bad himself.&nbsp; So today, I will cherish him.&nbsp; No matter how crappy the day, I will cherish him.   And for you, Lt. Brian Smith, I will wave my flag, vote my conscience, and put Dave's Insanity Hot Sauce all over my dinner.&nbsp; Rest in peace.

      It's been a busy week around here.&nbsp; Hard to imagine, huh?&nbsp; Reilly Kate starts school in a couple weeks at a cooperative preschool.&nbsp; Since no one wanted to be group leader for her class, guess who volunteered.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; Me.&nbsp; Plus, I'm trying to get all our paperwork together for her admission.&nbsp; You wouldn't believe the amount of paperwork to simply get my daughter in a preschool.&nbsp; And, it seems, I will be getting her the varicella (chicken pox) vaccine tomorrow morning, much to my sorrow.  &nbsp;  You see, this silly little island state has decided to  require  the varicella vaccine.&nbsp; In most states it is optional.&nbsp; I'd really rather her not get the varicella vaccine.&nbsp; I would much prefer she just get the chicken pox the old fashioned way.&nbsp; I fully intended to have her vaccinated for it by the age of ten had she not contracted the pox.&nbsp; Sadly, though, it looks like "pox parties" are a thing of the past.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I actually called the state's immunizations department and talked to a very nice, cheerful woman.&nbsp; She informed me that had I not had Reilly Kate vaccinated against  anything , then I could get an exemption.&nbsp; But since I only wanted an exemption for a shot that was, until recently, optional, I was out of luck.  &nbsp;  "Excuse me," I sputtered.&nbsp; "Do you mean that since I had my daughter&nbsp;immunized for the deadly diseases, the diseases that have caused widespread death, disability, and disfigurment, but do not wish to have her&nbsp;immunized for a fairly benign childhood disease with a vaccine whose efficacy is questionable, then I am up the proverbial creek?"  &nbsp;  "I'm sorry?&nbsp; A creek?"&nbsp; she questioned.  &nbsp;  "I'll rephrase.&nbsp; She cannot go to school unless she is completely immunized.&nbsp; Or completely NOT immunized.&nbsp; Is that correct?"  &nbsp;  "That's correct."  &nbsp;  I was stunned.&nbsp; What the hell kind of Catch 22 bullshit is that?&nbsp; This immunizations topic is really starting to burn me up.  &nbsp;  For those of you that don't know, there is a growing movement amongst middle class Americans to  NOT  vaccinate children.&nbsp; I'm sure to some of you who lived in fear of polio each summer during your childhood, that seems outrageous and unbelievable.&nbsp; But I assure you it is out there and growing.  &nbsp;  Growing thanks to a lot of baseless information poisoning the internet. I swear, I am gonna start a website about the cancer causing agents of red clothing and see what kind of following I get (especially from the Mothering.com crowd -- and before you flame me for that I subscribe and visit those boards so I'm amongst them). I can hear it now, "Oh, I don't allow my kids to wear red. Too risky. We stick with only neutral colors dyed with sweet potatoes and red dirt on hand-picked organic cotton woven by underprivileged mothers in Botswana. In the winter, I do allow my children the occasional wool sweater made from sheep who live in the Waldorf-Astoria and dine on organic grasses flown in daily from Scotland."  &nbsp;  "Really?&nbsp; Well, we've been red-free now for five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then&nbsp;our headaches have cleared up and my son no longer experiences those&nbsp;eye twitches that plagued him for so long.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't allow any red in my house whatsoever.&nbsp; Not even blood.&nbsp; We do all our bleeding outside, in our mulch pile.&nbsp; It's so much cleaner.&nbsp; But let me just suggest you do some reading on organic grasses grown in Scotland.&nbsp; They're full of lead.&nbsp; The soil in Scotland is so&nbsp;contaminated with&nbsp;lead that the sheep eating the grass are currently being tested for developmental delays."  &nbsp;  "[Gasp]&nbsp; I had no idea.&nbsp; I have to go and google that.&nbsp; Ciao."  &nbsp;  Barf.&nbsp; There's a culture of perfect parenting out there that is so obsessed they are no longer thinking clearly.&nbsp; Any ninny&nbsp;can go and post an internet site and blather on and on about whatever they choose, using real information or stuff they yanked out the pure, blue sky.&nbsp; It's dangerous.&nbsp; And even more dangerous are those that are too lazy to do the real research for themselves.&nbsp; Parents are just hopping on the internet and basing their parental decisions on cyber junk floating around.  &nbsp;  Now, I'm not saying that there is not risk involved with vaccinations.&nbsp; There are.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Real dangers.&nbsp; But if you put your kids in a car driving 50 miles per hour, there's danger.&nbsp; If you let your kids ride a bike, there's danger.&nbsp; Hell, I remember reading about an American child living in Japan who fell while walking down the street,&nbsp;hit his head on the curb and died.&nbsp; I'm sure somewhere there are parents pressuring government officials to demolish curbs.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I agonized over giving my precious children these shots.&nbsp; I agonized, prayed, sweated, and cried for days.&nbsp; And yet, I did it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it is a social contract we all must abide by.&nbsp; Just like when the traffic signals go out and everyone treats the intersection like a stop sign.&nbsp; It's a social contract.&nbsp; You stop.&nbsp; Then I stop.&nbsp; This way we don't have a collision.&nbsp; See?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What I don't understand is why these parents who are not getting their kids immunized are being allowed to put these kids in schools.&nbsp; Why should I subject my children to the hazards of vaccinations just to have the Smith family refuse and potentially expose my kids to outbreaks?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is arrogant and classist.&nbsp; ""Oh, not my child.&nbsp;Let them, those poor people living in unsanitary conditions vaccinate their children.&nbsp; But I won't do mine."&nbsp; Blech.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ya know, if you don't want to vaccinate your kids, fine.&nbsp; Go buy yourself a nice plot in the 100 Acre Wood and live there amongst other potential lepers and don't come out.&nbsp; Stay there and grow your own food and drink rainwater and make breastmilk cottage cheese.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just don't contaminate my kids, thankyouverymuch.  &nbsp;  Unless you happen to have an outbreak of the chicken pox.&nbsp; Then could you give me call?&nbsp;

      I thought I was going to get a day off.  Not a whole day off.  Just a got-a-cold, get-well kind of day off.  I was wrong.  You see, July 3rd was our tenth wedding anniversary.  In the great tradition of our engagement, we went bed shopping.  Back when Mike and I decided to marry, we began saving up for an engagement ring.  Just when we had enough money to put a substantial down payment on a nice hunk of sparkly rock, Mike's bad back started acting up.  We were sleeping on a cramped, old, rented double bed and Mike decided that a clean, factory new, queen sized bed would rectify what laser surgery on his disks had failed to.   Bad back trumps naked ring finger.  We bought the bed.  I bitterly referred to it as "the engagement bed" and swore that I would fashion a chain to attach the bed to my finger and lug it around for all to see what my betrothed had given me.  We did actually finance a small, cute, affordable little engagement ring for me with the promise that for our tenth anniversary we would do an upgrade.  Over the next ten years, while sleeping on that queen's bed, I would dream of our tenth anniversary.  With our cherubic little angels looking on, Mike would get down on one knee and present to me an brilliant, diamond studded token of his affection, professing his unwavering commitment and deepening love.  Romance would be thick in the air.  Roses on the table.  Barry White on the speakers.  Champagne and strawberries.  Maybe even he'd whisk me away for a weekend in downtown Waikiki, the place of our honeymoon.  But ten years of wedding bliss has broken down the engagement bed and Mike's back has never been worse.  Bad back trumps anniversary band.    We went shopping for a king sized bed this anniversary, lugging our two demonic offspring from furniture store to furniture store.  The anniversary bed is king sized, a true step up from the engagement bed.  And it's one of those Serta Sleepers, guaranteed to induce sleep despite having a suckling infant attached to one boob all night long.  Or at least that is what the salesperson alluded to.    Mike did present to me a small, cute, affordable, little Hawaiian plumeria ring with the smallest little sparkle of a diamond in the middle.  It's really all a girl could ask for.  I mean, throw in a Hawaiian cruise with a spa day and a $1,000 clothing allowance and I'm the Queen herself, ya know?  We had invited a couple and their year old daughter over for barbecue and margaritas on the 4th.  Since we were out hunting for the perfect anniversary bed the day before, we hadn't had time for the typical pre-guests spot dusting and vacuum running.  I set about that task in the early morning, 4th of July while Mike and the kids breakfasted.    Somehow, and I'm not clear exactly on the events that transpired, Roman poked Mike in the eye.  Immediately Mike had to go back to bed for several hours.  Now, here I was tired, cranky, and suffering from post traumatic anniversary stress and Mike was back in bed with a bum eye.  I was starting to wonder how early in the morning I needed to get up in order to be able to go back to bed.  He eventually did get up and enjoyed the day with us and our guests.  The kids played.  The adults ate and drank.  We watched the fireworks on the beach and almost got arrested for loitering (long story -- Let freedom ring).  It was a nice 4th.  The next morning, however, when I awoke, I felt a tightening in my chest, indicating an impending cold.  I swallowed and it stung.  I sneezed and my nose ran like a loose faucet.  My ears were ringing and I just felt like hell.    "HA!!!" thought I.  "Today is the day that I will get to sleep in.  Today is the day that I will nap and laze around in bed.  Today!!  Today is MY day to be sick and moan and groan and get cared for.  Today is MY SICK DAY!"  "Uhhhh..." groaned Mike.  "You better take a look at my eye.  It hurts like hell."  I look over and Mike's entire eye, the eye that Roman poked him in, was crusted over with goo.  What little I could see of his actual eye, was an angry, blood red.  He could hardly keep it open.  "I think you better take me to the ER."  Scratched cornea trumps common cold.  And so that is how I spent my sick day.  In the ER entertaining our two small children with Elmo toys and fruity snacks.  Bribing them with juice boxes, lollipops, and promises of movies and Chuck E Cheese.    At one point a nice older lady comes up to Reilly Kate and asks, "Who's sick?  You or your brother?"  "Daddy's back hurts," was Reilly's response.    "Oh, your Daddy is seeing the doctor because his back hurts?"  the old lady queried.  Reilly nodded.  "His knee hurts, too," Reilly Kate informed her.  "His back  and  his knee?  They  both  hurt?" she asked.  "Yep."  "So is the doctor making his back and his knee feel better?" asked the woman.  "No.  The doctor is making his eye feel better.  His back still hurts."  Reilly is well versed now.  The woman looked at me for confirmation and all I did was laugh and nod.  That's all I could do.  I still didn't feel very well myself.  On the drive home from the hospital, Mike informed me that they prescribed Vicodin for the pain and that when we got home he'd be taking one and going to bed.  "But I'm really sick.  I wanted to take a nap." I was desperately pleading now.  "They told me I have to lay down in a dark room and rest my eye for a couple of days," Mike explained with blood red, tear filled eyes. I really did feel sorry for him.  His eye looked horrible.  So he went to bed.  I stayed up with the kids and suffered through a cold that really wasn't half as bad as I had hoped it would be.  I did get a little nap later in the afternoon.  A nap with a suckling infant attached to one boob and a toddler sprawled out in more than her fair share of the queen sized engagement bed.  Not much of nap really.  Of course, this brings me back to my need for a body cast.  I will have to get up in the morning, earlier than Mike.  Say about 4am.  Then throw myself down the stairs.  What I'm banking on is a couple of broken ribs and maybe a sprained ankle.  Oh, a nice slight concussion would work well.  I'll have to do it, though, when Mike isn't having surgery.  I'm quite certain back surgery  and  knee surgery trumps self induced superficial injuries.  Anybody know where I can get a body cast?

      (After being interrupted by naps that ended prematurely, I was unable to finish the last entry.  Then there was our 10th anniversary celebration, the 4th of July, and finally a trip to the ER for Mike who is suffering from a scratched cornea, the work of his delightfully curious, but dangerously long nailed son.  I am now, I believe, ready to finish this story).  By the time we arrived at the commissary, it was 11 o'clock and raining.  Reilly Kate had to go potty and Roman needed a diaper change.  I pulled out the car potty and noticed that we only had a few bags for it left.  Instead of wasting them, I figured I'd just quickly change Roman, throw them all in the stroller, and hustle it on into the shopping center's bathroom.  And that's what I did.  Reilly Kate's new fascination is storm clouds.  I'm sure it is the work of that diabolical Dora and her possessed talking monkey Boots.  So while I'm weaving us in and out of traffic, jay walking in the rain with a stroller, running with my rather large breasts slapping up against my chin, I'm hearing, "Are these storm clouds?   Yeah, these are storm clouds.  Them's spitting on me."  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Of course, the shopping center's bathroom is closed for cleaning (why would I expect anything else?) so I had to run into the BX (Base Exchange) and use that bathroom.  I had a very good reason I did not want to go into this particular store, but it was much closer than the commissary and you never know how much time a two year old bladder is going to give you.  The problem is the placing of the book section.  It is right when you walk in and stretches the length of the store all the way to the back near the bathrooms.    "Books!  Mama!  Books!!  I want a Dora book!  I need a honu book!  Mama!  Mama!"  And thus is was until after we had used the potty and I allowed her to select for purchase one, single book.  After much deliberation she chose  Beauty & the Beast .  To pay for said book, we stood in a line that stretched so far back I wondered if they were giving away push up bras to fat housewives. The majority of time we spent in line was right next to the candy.  Why, oh why, do they do this to us mothers?  God have mercy on their capitalistic souls.  "Mama, I'm hungry.  I need a lollipop.  My tummy hurts.  I need some food.  I need some emineminems (M&Ms for those of you who don't know).  My tummy hurts."  With the promise of lunch, we left the BX to find the food court.  It was now 11:40. Yep.  I had just blown forty minutes on one trip to the bathroom and a Beauty and the Beast book.  Lunchtime was now upon us and I had to wrangle the masses for some Popeyes' chicken strips and a spot to feed my children in the cramped, hot and humid food court.    We had just sat down when Roman started to do his tired and cranky, hungry and hot whimper.  So while Reilly Kate ate, I nursed Roman (have I ever told you how much those military servicemen just love to see a woman breastfeeding her child while they eat?  Oh, the looks I got filled me with such fiery fuel it's what kept me running at peak efficiency for the rest of the day) and reviewed my shopping list.  With all these diversions and time wasters, I wanted to make my trip to the actual commissary as efficient as possible, afterall.   By the time we entered the commissary, the time was 12:25pm.  The rain had ceased and the sun was typically hot and bright.  Roman was asleep in the stroller and Reilly was reading her new book.  Despite the setbacks, I was in good spirits when I walked through the double doors of that grocery store.  I grabbed a cart (I was going to have to push the stroller and pull the cart through the store since Roman was sleeping in the stroller) and thus began our the actual  shopping  part of our shopping trip.  During the course of our afternoon in the commissary, we made three trips to the potty (only two were successful), one nursing session, and stops at every single food sampling counter in the store.  When I finally paid the cashier, I asked her what time it was:  2:45pm.  The day was almost spent and I had accomplished nothing but grocery shopping.  I guessed there would be no trip to the pool that day.  I was bemoaning this fact to a teenage couldn't-care-less bagger as we made our way out to the van.  She was smiling politely but I could tell her mind was adrift on such weighty topics as Britney's upcoming nuptials and Vin Diesel's true ethnicity.  It was only when we turned the corner to start down the aisle in which I parked the van, that I saw it.  My van with the lights on and the hatch up.    "Oh my god!  Oh my god!"  was all I could manage.  My outburst focused the attention of my bagger who seemed almost delighted with the situation.  I am sure the tragedy of a fat housewife and her miscreant offspring breaks up an otherwise humdrum existence.  "That's yours?" she almost giggled.  "I saw that when I started this morning?  You've been here the whole time?  I saw it when I went in to work this morning and it was still like that when I went to lunch.  It's been like that all day.  How long you been here today?"  "You saw the hatch up and you didn't do anything?  You couldn't close it?"  In my shock and disbelief this was all I could muster.  I feared any more than that leaving my mouth and this poor teenage bystander would be hit with a barrage of cursing the likes of which she had never heard nor from which would she fully recover.  "I... I thought that someone did that intentionally.  I thought maybe they wanted..." she drifted off I assume with the realization of her stupidity.  I finished her sentence under my breath, "...they wanted to run out their battery and be stuck with $200 worth of groceries rotting in the sweltering heat whilst their hot, hungry, and shopping weary children whine and cry?"  "Uh... do you... I mean, is there anything... uhh... Can I call someone for you?"  she sputtered while loading the bags into the van's open back.  I climbed into the driver's seat, inserted the ignition key and turned.  For a split second it sounded like all was good and fine with the world.  It almost turned over.  But then the wipers started going and the radio started playing and the car wouldn't turn over.  I guess I had left the wipers and radio on as well.    "Car's dead, Mama?  Car's dead?  Car's dead, Mama?  Car's dead, Mama?"  Poor little Reilly Kate had heard me muttering and was now repeating with worried look on her face much older than her years.    "Yes, baby.  The car's dead.  But it'll be fine.  I can fix this."  I reached into my wallet to give the teenage girl a tip (here's a damn tip for ya:  Next time you see a car with the hatch open, CLOSE IT!!!!)  and saw my AAA card.  I would just call AAA.  I grabbed for my phone and started to dial when I realized after 9/11, security was so tight that there was no way I'd be able to get a tow truck on base.  Scratch that.   I called Mike figuring he might be at work and his work is just a quick jaunt from where I was.  He could driven over to us and jumped me (the van that is, get your mind out of the gutter) before the groceries all went to pot.  Instead, I got his voicemail.  Figuring he was in a meeting, I was starting to panic.  I dialed his cell phone, just in case.  He answered. He had gotten out of work early and was a couple blocks from home.  Home which is over a half hour away from where I was now.  And as if that weren't enough, he said that I didn't even have any jumper cables in the van. He'd taken them out.    With a deep, cleansing breath, I said, "Just get here when you can.  I am going to take the kids and sit under a tree and I'll see you when you get here."  After hanging up, I peered around looking for a shade tree.  Just as I was sbout to start over toward the grass, two young college aged boys (men?) came out of the store and yelled, "Do you need help?"  Now, before I say anything more, let me reiterate the fact that I am a feminist.  I don't make any apologies for it.  I do, with all my heart and soul, believe that men and women  are equals.  Women can and do take care of themselves.  We always have.  I know I can.  But there are times when a man comes along to lend a hand that makes you really feel like a damsel in distress being saved by a prince.    This was one of those times.  I almost melted when I realized that these two men/boys were going to save my almost beyond repair day.  Within minutes they had my van out of the spot, hooked up to their car, and jumped.  They had it running.  The air conditioner was going and my groceries saved.    "Thank you.  Thank you so much," I gushed like a silly girl with a crush.  "You literally saved me.  Thank you.  I didn't know what I was going to do.  I had all these groceries... You saved me.  Thank you."  "Fank you," Reilly Kate mimicked.  "Fank you so much.  You saved me."  Like mother, like daughter.  She even did the sigh and smile hair flip that I had perfected in college.  It's so unflattering when your children mirror you.  I handed the guys all the money that was left in my wallet, seven bucks, and said, "Go buy yourselves some beers.  I'd buy you each a beer, but" I motioned toward the children "I'm kinda busy right now."    They thanked me and went off into the sunset.  My heroes.  My princes.  I was flying high.  It felt good to be saved.  Something about it literally made me feel young and cute again.    It wasn't until I got home that I realized I had baby spit up in my hair, milk leaking stains on my boobs, and ketchup on my shorts.  I must have been quite the sight for those young pups.  I bet I scared the hell out of them.  They're probably right now recounting the experience.  "Dude, that fat old chick was totally making eyes at you."  "No way.  She was so into you.  She gave you the money.  Man, she looked like my mom."  All said and done, the groceries were safe despite the long trip home, fighting rush hour traffic the whole way.    But I insist there must be an easier way of getting food in the house.

      I know I've already discussed my intense dislike of shopping with children in tow.  But for the sake of entertainment, let's review using yesterday as a prime example.  Yesterday morning began as any morning does around here:  Roman awoke at the crack of dark and I tried to persuade him into sleeping a little bit later.  My method is to lead by example.  While he lays there and babbles and pulls out my hair strand by strand, I doze in and out of an unfulfilling sleep.  What finally finally woke me up on this particular morning was a rather loud thud followed by a scared little boy's cry for his mama.  Yes, Roman is crawling now and crawled right out of the bed, did a double flip (I can only speculate on how he accomplished this) and landed flat on his face.  Good morning.  Reilly Kate woke up soon after and we proceeded downstairs for breakfast.  Much like Old Mother Hubbard, I went to my cupboard to give my poor girl some milk.  When I got there, the cupboard was bare and so the poor girl asked for some juice.  No juice.  Toast?  No bread.  Pancakes?  No mix.  Eggs?  None.  Nothing.  My poor girl got some dry Cheerios, an apple, and water.  She wasn't happy.  Time to go to the grocery store.  I began getting the kids and myself ready.  Never mind the fact that it was still just 6-ish and the store wouldn't open for another three hours.  I know how these things work and if I start the preparations early, I'll get to leave early.  No distractions.  Stay focused on the goal.  Heck, I figured, we'd be back for lunch and then do an afternoon pool break.  What a wonderful day I had planned.  Three loads of laundry, two baths, and a early morning nap followed by a major poopy blow out later, we were loaded up into the van  and ready to go.  It was ten o'clock.    As I drove through our pristine, brand new neighborhood I contemplate the recent rash of burglaries that is forcing us all to batten down the hatches.  This leads me to think about our own home and whether I actually accomplished the battening.  I couldn't remember if I'd hit the garage door button.  I racked my brain but came up blank.  I turned the van around to make sure.  Of course, the garage door was closed and I'd just made an extra turn around for nothing.  Better safe than sorry, though.  The time was then 10:05.    I head out of our development a little more hurried, trying to make up for those lost five minutes.  I sped up to three times the legal limit of 5 mph and out of no where something white hits my windshield.  I immediately thought it was a bird, but as I peered through it to view the road, I see that it is not a bird but a pair of panties.  Reilly Kate's panties.  When I was doing laundry I had put a pair on the hood of the van so as to remember to bring a spare pair for accidents.  I had forgotten all about them and with the additional speed, they flew off.    I rolled down the window and turned the windshield wipers on to try to catch them while driving.  It didn't work.  I'm no catcher.  They flew off and landed in the middle of the entrance to our complex.  I turned the van around and doubled back to pick up the panties.    With panties in hand, we were finally on the road.  The clock read 10:12.  I laughed to myself that is had taken me almost 15 minutes to get out of my housing development.  I laughed until I realized that I'd left my debit card and the grocery list sitting on the kitchen counter.  For the THIRD time, I pulled the van around and back we went.  This time a groundskeeper stopped weedwacking and waved at me.  I'm certain that the construction crew working on the last of the new houses must have thought I was lost.  I was frustrated and feeling foolish.  Back at the house, I left the car running and the kids safely buckled in their carseats as I popped in and grabbed the card and list.  Time of departure was now 10:18.    I put the van into reverse and then I heard, "Mama!!  I need my donkey!"    Without uttering a word, I put it back into park, ran inside and upstairs into Reilly Kate's room, grabbed her donkey and ran back down.  I handed her the donkey, put the van back in reverse and sarcastically asked, "Is there  ANYTHING  else we need before we go to the store?"  "My sun gasses," (not a typo, that's how she says it, "sungasses") Reilly Kate replied quite matter of factly.  And since I had asked, there was no way I could have said no to her.  Back in park went the van.  Back inside went I.  I grabbed sunglasses and decided to make a quick check around the house for any other item that just might be needed.  Nope.  I was confident this time.  We were going to be on our way.  And we were.  The time was now 10:24.  Almost a full 4 hours from when I started getting us ready to leave the house.  Not bad, eh?

      Roman is now a full fledged stink ass. Gone forever are those slimy pumpkin snot, breastfed baby poops that really don't smell all that bad. I'm not sure how that happened since he is still hardly ingesting any solids, but apparently the graham crackers dipped in organic turkey and barley baby food I've been shoving in his mouth are fermenting nicely within his intestines.  For those unfamiliar with the toilet habits of infants, particularly nursing infants, let me tell you, this is a milestone. It means no longer will I be able to finish eating before changing his poopies. The smell is so overpowering it can ruin even the best Shrek waffle sticks with green, maple flavored syrup. It means diapers must be stowed away in smell proofed containers decorated with Stick Up deodorizers. And look out if I forget a diaper in the minivan. The whole garage will smell like an overflowing septic tank.  This aromatic milestone has an even bigger significance for cloth diapering mamas like myself. See, breastfed baby, pumpkin snot poop rinses off in the washer. No need to do a thing with the poop. Magically, during the course of one cycle, the poop just vanishes. Not so solid food, stink bomb poop. It's more solid. It has bulk. It clings and clumps. It requires dunking. Diaper dunking is a skill. If ever there is a Mama Olympics, you can guarantee there will be a diaper dunking event. It'll be akin to the more obscure events such as biatholon or curling, but it'll be there and I'll be one of the gold medal favorites.  "Here comes Heather Peet representing the American diaper dunking team. As you know, the United States has been really lagging behind in the diaper dunking event due to widespread disposable usage. But Heather... she's a veteran of the sport. She's been dunking for almost 3 years and -- shhhh.... Let's just watch her now. There she takes hold of the corner. Notice she doesn't use any clips or holders. She says she is a traditionalist and she isn't afraid to get her hands dirty. Look at that form! That move is called "the dunk and flush" and it's her signature in this event. Followed off by a quadruple twist and wring! Wow. What a finish! Surely deserving of the gold!"  Hey, I can dream, right? It's the only way, even in my dreams, that I'd ever win a gold medal.  The worst part of this stage is that it has come to Roman while he is simultaneously also doing diaper self-removal. I cannot keep a diaper on him unless he is fully clothed, preferably in something with locks. In fact, his very first, stinky, big boy poop didn't land in his diaper, but rather all over my carpet. At first glance I thought our little dachshund, Truman, had left me a present. But then I saw him -- my beautiful baby boy and his gorgeous, teeny tiny, unblemished baby butt smeared with poop. Poop on his hands, under his finger nails, between his toes. I guess he was pretty impressed with the poop he can now produce and had to experience it, hands on so to speak.  He cleaned up nicely, but not so the stain on my carpet. If anyone has a good home remedy for baby poop on berber, let me know.  And the next time I say I had a shitty day, I mean real shit!
