        4re we not the ones who cre4te the mond4y blues; some feel is a long d4y to st4rt off a new week, others feel l4st week problems unsolve and new ones coming 4round; m4ny feels older every mond4ys comes 4round so f4st; 4nd I feel mond4y is my blue how soon is frid4y for our booze. Tips for getting out of this blues from your work - t4kes long te4 bre4ks, w4lk very slowly every step you t4ke in the office, ch4t long ch4t with colleques over topics you h4te not to 4rgue 4bout, p4y visit to the toilet 4nd just squ4t there, pl4y with your mobile and try deleting cont4cts you don't know who they 4re, t4lk to the cle4ning l4dy 4sk for her logic4l 4dvice, throw 4w4y unneccess4ry stuff in your work dr4wers, 4nd l4stly keep looking 4t your 4ttire (for men) check your zips, (for wom4n) check your m4ke-ups. Tips you should 4void doing on mond4y - going to your boss room or merely p4ssing by his/her office, 4nd re4ding mond4ys em4il.

        Over m4ny things in life, we sore bleed 4nd hope to recover. One 4fter 4nother c4me to term with us. Burning cells just to recover for 4while...here we go 4g4in. Work, f4mily, lovelife, $$$, UFO problems, etc. We live a d4y without soring, without the complic4tions, without pe4ce in mind. How do we m4int4in a good pe4ceful life in this 4ren4 of cultured, must beh4ve, politic4l binding society? Find a p4r4dise then or f4ce it we 4re build/born to withst4nd this torment for over 100 ye4rs if not less. Hopefully, our robot will t4ke over our roles in the next 20 ye4rs. But then we sh4ll f4ce a new er4 of soring.

       You 4re not the one, she is not the other. Life just me4ningless when you see you c4n't h4ve it 4ll. Feel 4t most you don't need 4nything in life, you could feel no pressure 4nd diss4tisf4ction. True enough we 4re born without 4nything on us...why we expect 4nything now? Sp4re the one 4nd l4ter the other...you will not be the other.

        is it not true... sky h4s no limits. Our life h4s a limit "We live for a 100 ye4rs" or lesser goes with so much stress in our life and is not getting e4sier e4ch d4y. Sounds neg4tive, but look 4round you 4re you seeing the light 4t the end of the tunnel? If you do, will you be 4lone there? Still life goes on but not just oneself...we need friends 4nd love ones. Here it is m4ke merry everyd4y sh4re your thoughts here. I would if you could, should we st4rt a d4y without the blues? Cheers to this kind of lifeline...:)
