						     Creative Expressions are a collection of poems that are written by Momdukes. These poems are also published with the National Poetry Society.    Each poem has a story to tell of my feelings, emotions, and life. When I cannot explain how I feel verbally, I do it by writing&nbsp;my feelings, emotions, and life experiences on paper.    Creative Expressions will be a forum for young artist as well, which, I have the pleasure of knowing.    Read, Enjoy, and post comments on what you think and all suggestions are welcome about &nbsp;Creative Expressions.

						      Teenagers, boy are they a trip. They can be SO complex, you just have to shake your head.   Let me tell you, I have three of them. Their ages are 16 (recently graduated from High School), 15 (entering high school), and 14 (currently in High School). The 16 and 15 year old are females and 14 year old is a male.  I have to deal with three (3) personalities plus my own and it is definitely a chore. There are times I want to pack my bags and leave. Most of time I am loving them generously. With the two girls, want to spread their wings and fly from the nest without thinking. I constantly ask them to inform me when they are leaving the block, call when they get to their destination, and when they are coming home. Sometimes they listen and their are times they try my patience.         Tonight for instance the 16 year old informed me she'll be home at 8:00 pm, so I'm waiting and waiting there is no 16 year old. Time is ticking away, I am becoming concerned, by the way it is 10:00 pm. At 10:15 I give her brother a call, who lives in Norristown, PA.. He&nbsp; says, "she left at 10:00 pm, which means she'll be coming into Philadelphia around 11:00pm. I am worrying now because she'll have to walk a distance in order to get home. What is she thinking, she can handle herself if someone&nbsp;comes up on her with&nbsp;a weapon or who is stronger than her. Tell me what is she going to do to defend herself. The way things are&nbsp;in today's society, especially in my neighborhood! Just two or three months ago two young girls on this block was attack by a young man who attempted to rape them. One (18) was attack coming home from work around Broad &amp; Wyoming area and the other (13) was attacked coming home from a friends house on our block. Should I not worry or should I just let it be?     My 16 year old knows these young ladies personally, we have discussed it and she knows how I feel and what I expect her to do.    Now, the 15&nbsp;year old has an agenda all her own. I guess she believes she is exempt, not in this lifetime. The 15 year old is my niece and she is used to doing things her way, such as, staying out as long as she wants and not telling anyone where she is going. Lately, it has been getting difficult to deal with her without being angry.         &nbsp;

						   I want to share somethings about myself. I am a forty-four (44) years old and single parent of one. I currently raising my niece and nephew. I live in the Philadelphia area. I enjoy reading, writing poetry, and laughing. I enjoy jazz, smooth R&B, some hip-hop, and light classical music. The types of books I read are written mostly by Afro-American authors. Also, I definitely enjoy and thrilling Stephen King book. I am really into sci-fi and Stephen King writes the best sci-fi books. My blog will consist of my various topics, which are interesting to me and hopefully my readers. I will discuss issues which concern us a society, people, and nation. My blog will most definitely discuss today's youth.
