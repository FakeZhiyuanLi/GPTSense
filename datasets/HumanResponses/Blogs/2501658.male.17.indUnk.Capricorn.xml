      today. Haaaaaaah.  Were do i start off. Today i slept until about 3 and ryan woke me up so i would have probly slept longer if he didnt but thats fine. Id rather not sleep until it gets dark. So i got up and looked at my phone and there were 3 messages and 6 missed calls and suprise! there all from my boss. Hurrrrraaaaaayyyy!!! so i called the piece of shit back and he of course wanted me to work and being the good person i am i agreed to work from 5 till 9. So me and ryan get ready and because my sister doesnt know the meaning of "share the van" she of course has it so me and ryan proceeded to walk from my house to ryans so we could have a car. about the time we get there we realize i need to go to work and i might as well have just walked to work. Im a retard and thats all that needs to be said. So i get to work and the place is just fucking trashed it looks someone came through with a vaccum and put it in reverse. So "Wes the cleaning Bitch" to the rescue. Yeah no more needs to be said, it sucked ass. I dont spend that much time cleaning my own damn house. So after all the cleaning duites and cashing out the registers its about 10 or so and beautiful mrs meghan calls me up to tell me some disasterous news. Ok for starters, me and ryan picked up meghan late last night and we went to the skatepark. Ryan was sleeping over so we didnt have to worry about him having to be home anytime soon.  So we go to the skatepark and poor maghan had to watch the single worst skate session ive ever had and she had to watch ryan and thats just bad in its self. I really felt bad for her but she is super hot so i still wanted her there. So once me and ryan gave up we left and drove around for about an hour and a half or so. And you know, I dont think ive had that much fun driving around ever. I seriously had a real good time. I was happy meghan called shot gun cause i like having her up there I feel like she is part of the conversation more. so anyway we drove around until like 3:30 or so and then we droped meghan off at her house. And oh yeah guess who got a birthday hug and some b-day kissed. Yup you guessed it, none others than yours truly. I was and still am so hyped on that part fo the evening. So thats what happed last night and we thought meghan had it in the bag but when she called me today she told me that the dogs barked when she came in and her mom came down the stairs so she got in some MAYJOR TROUBLE. God, when she said that on the phone my heart just sank down. I know its not all my fault but i still cant help but think that its somewhat my fault. IM SORRY MEGHAN!!!!!!!But she held strong and didnt tell her parents who she was out with so i guess thats the silver linning in it all. So after i got off the phone with poor meghan i went and tried to skate. Its been a long time since ive skated by myself and it feels damn good to have nobody there but me. I know it makes me a loser but i dont care. 2 things I hate are other ppl at the skatepark and school. 2 things I love are skating by myself and Meghan. I dont really know why but i guess it has to do with focusing on what the hell im doing. And i didnt have the best session but i did alright. I learned 2 new tricks and i got some other tricks better. Then some ragged looking friends of the janitor came in and skated and that pissed me off so i left. I cant go from just me being there to like 5 guys who really suck. So now im home and today is my christmas eve cause i get to open my presents tomorrow because my family is super helment special like that and we get the priveldge of not being normal. But whatever, excatly one year from this past monday i can offically move out! And ooooooo am i ready. In 1 year 4 out of the 5 ppl in our little moving in crew will be 18 and all we got to wait for is little Meghan.   but anywho i think im gone so until next time, dont skate with me   P.S. Meghan, recently you have said some really nice things about me in you blog, and i want you to know they mean alot to me. I also want you to know that when im around you im always having a good time and when im not, im looking forward to the next time I can hear your voice or the next time we will hang out. And dont forget i still got 2 ass kissings left so watch your back. Or, umm, watch you ass. Ill talk to you soon.

      Sometimes your best friends can really piss you off. and i guess thats apart of life, i guess. even more often just random people can make you mad.  No point.   Well i guess there sort of is. Recently ive been noticing that no one can take a compliment graciously. Everybody just thinks that your retarded and will never belive you. Some ppl shrug it off but actually take it to heart...   so how do you know who your wasting your breath on and who is actually worth your while? you dont and you cant ever know. Im reminded of this all the time because there are ppl i just casually give random compiments to and they just look at me like im the biggest moron ever. and i cant say that i love reciving that look. Maybe cause im not a good reciver, i like being the giver better. That pertty much goes with everything from presents to whatever. I have no idea what to tell people when they ask me what they should get for me. I dont even know what i need so how the hell are they soposed to give it to me?  ITs my birthday right now and im now into my 3rd hour of being 17 years young, of course i feel no different but im now legal age to see "R" movies. (get ready for some sarcasem)whooo hoo lets throw a party.(ok im done) What now. In 365 days i can move out and no one can say shit. yesterday was santuhs birthday and hes super hot so everyone give him a birthday hump or whatever. so come december 30th of next year all the boys are ready to move out and in together. kinda scary but extreamly exciting at the same time. now we just got to wait for young mrs. Brina to be able to join us. And we might have a joining party to our already 4 deep crew. Mrs. amanda gould the hooters girl is talking about maybe moving in with us to run us up to the total of 5 ppl sharing a place. DAMN! NOTE: hey meghan we need to talk about that by the way cause i bet no one told you yet. so amanda will be 19, ryan will be 18, me and kevin will both be 18 and meghan will be 18 after february 25th so the crew will all be set to move in together in feb. I really hope everyone fallows through with this shit cause we could potentially get a bangin new place with 5 ppl.   Girls and me. how do i fit in with this world full of couples? as of now i guess i dont. recently ive been thinking alot more about looking for a girlfriend now dont get me wrong, my standards have not lowered but im just looking more.  Stephine, 2 beccas, bretta, and monica are some girls that i could maybe have a chance with if i put in some effort and took away some acne. And me and meghan have been chillin alot lately so I dont know whats up with that or where that is going but whatever. So whats my problem? Im kinda insecure about myself but who isnt? And im being the biggest hipocrite lately becase ive talked against alcohol and i got pretty drunk at this party at 3rd. but other than that there is no reason not to go for any of the 6 of them. I always complain to myself that no girls like me and if i just would look around i could see that there are some nut balls out there that can stand me enough to have a relationship with. i just need less time spent in my ass and more time looking at other peoples.  "dont forgive yourslef ever, cause if you do, youll never forgive youslef"

      So what if it has been a while. So what? Im still here and so are you. And I guess thats all anyone can ask for is to still be here. I have a friend Nate and his mom resently died and even though hes 19 he still would have spent chrismas with her, and now shes gone. Im not gonna turn this into a "be thankful of what you have" or a "you dont know what you have until its gone" speech. But it is something to think about. Plus, both of those statments are true and need to be thought on. Once you have lost something it sucks and you want it back. But when it was around you took it for granted. So how do we avoid taking what is so important for granted? I think its just human nature to always want what we cant have. You know, fuck, everyone knows they've wanted something they cant have. wheather it be a new car or a better job or for school to be over or even to have a girlfriend/boyfriend. At some point in everyones life they want something they just simply cant have. As usual I have no point but i thought I would just throw that out there.  Well today is christmas eve and I suprizingly have no christmas hype. I already know what im gonna get because i picked all the shit out and all they did was rap it. But whatever. I guess i havent been on here for a while. I cant remember exactly what i did saturday-sunday but i know somewhere in there i skated alot and i worked for a while and i hung out with my non-school friends and it was great. Monday was the first day of my winter skate camp and it wasnt too bad. I got the more advanced kids in my group so that was cool and there are only four of the little bastards so it was ok. After the excitment of camp me, ryan, and santuh ate some pizza then peaced out of 3rd lair. We all went to ryans "pad" as he fondly likes to call it, and we just were chillin out then either i called meghan or meghan called me i cant remember. anywho in the end i perswaded her to come to ryans house and she finally gave in. So a while later BADOW showed up and we were all just chillin then ryan and kevin had the idea of playing minopoly. That sucked. And for about 2 or so hours was an array of bits of pillow fights (mainly against meghan, sorry sweety) and of ryan wrestling everyone there but kevin got the worst of it. So word of wisdom to all of you guys dont mess with ryan, he gets in these humping and wrestling moods and if your around him your fucked. But anyway I had a real good time, I guess its just a taste of what it will be like to live with all of them. And by the way i wanna speak on that note for a second. I am sooo ready to move out and I cant wait even more cause of the people who are gonna live with me. Me and ryan have been talking about living together ever sinse 8th or 9th grade. Then we became best friends with santuh (kevin) and the three of us have decided were all gonna move in together when the time comes. Our newest recruit is the finest of all of us. Mainly because its a girl. Thats right my own Meghan Beatty has now decided that she wants to move in with us and on behave of all of us we couldnt be more excited. Kevin is chill with it, ryan cant wait to mess with her 24/7/365, and I just really like her company. I think her sense of humor and sarcasticness will definatly add another level to our montley crue. It will take a bit of getting used to because of the numerous amounts of guy that she plays but i think me and the guys can eventually adapt to it, i mean we understand that every guy wants her so we just have to wait our turn. Actually i think me and ryan have already had out turn with her. I wonder if we can have seconds?  So tuesday not many of the kids showed up for skate camp so i got the opportunity to either go home and sleep or work and get payed. I should have gone home and slept but i stayed and wanted to work until like 12 but got duped into working until 3. (I hate you mark) I really really wanted to hang out with meghan but she started work at the same time i got off so that sucked. so i called her and asked if she would want to do something after she got off and she said that would be cool. so i went to Chipotle and ate alone because im the biggest looser i can think of and then deposited my check. Once i get out of the bank my boss calls and says he wants the entire miniroom painted so it will have time to dry because we are closed on wednessday and thursday. So yeah we close at 9 and he wants me to do it then. FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!!!! So once again i cant do anything with meghan.Twice in one day, yeah im a good friend. SO i get there and once we close i go out and sweep the mini room and get in completly prepared for paint. I go under the bowl and get what mark was supposed to set out for me and of course he didnt he forgot. So i call him up and he says all the paint is there i just need to get it out then mix it and im ready. sounds easy enough. NO NO NO, i mix it all together and find out im about 4 gallons too short! At this point im super pissed off mark calls me out of the blue and wants me to paint his god damn mini room i spend an hour preparing it and then we dont have enough paint so by the time i get it all cleaned up and put away and call mark and bitch at him as much as i can its about 11:15 and meghan can only be out until 12 so i saw no point to call her. Friends comes before work, lesson learned. MY usual buddies were at 3rd skating late so i joined them and we skated until about 12:30 then we decided to go back to jamille and Jr. Mint's place and chill. Jamille drank his newly obtained 40oz. and no im not talking about orange juice. Me and Da Guyzier stayed sober cause we had to drive so we worked on the box of ritz crackers while we all watched the movie Friday. That shit was funny as hell id like to watch the others. Jr. Mint had some girls over and they chilled with him. all in all my night turned out ok. Oh i just remembered on the way up to there house me and Jr. mint went damn fast on the freeway. I got the mini van to do 100! but hes got a 94' civic so he pased me easy doing 125mph. I was every impressed with the van i thought i would just shake to pieces and blow up but it didnt. preaty chill night after the whole mini room thing. Sorry Meghan for not being able to hang out with you i really was lookin forward to it but my boss is an duche bag. Call me real soon! 1-800-IM-SORRY  until next time, keep to yourself unless you would rather talk to me

      One day closer.  this week has gone by relitivley fast but i know tomorrow will just drag on forever. At least thats how these sort of things usually go. But whatever. Anyways today was quite the interesting day. Every other thursday we have a usuall company meeting and my bosses Mark and Steve have been warning us that they had a lot to go over in the meeting so we shold expect it to go until at least 11 or so. So I get there about an hour before the meeting started and skated a little bit and that didnt work out due to the fact im just to much of a homo to be good at something ive done for over 4 years of my life. So i got frushtrated and quit cause thats how real men deal with stress, they run away like little girls and sinse i seem to exibit girl like behavior when it comes to these kinds of things. So I head up to the front desk to chill out only to find a conversation with Steve about how pissed Mark is and how long this meeting will be so me being bummed out and then on top of that having a long bitch session with the owners just didnt seem like a great plan. Eventually one by one all the emplyees show up and they walk in super bummed cause they know what road lies ahead of us. So the meeting is started by Mark and we sign up for winter camps (we hold skate camps during the winter break and we teach kids how to skate for 3 days in a row) then he says "ok ill start with the good news cause we dont have any bad news. Were not having the meeting tonight its canceled and we are all going to Majors sports bar for a feast!" At first I didnt believe it but sure enough we all went to Majors and they reserved the entire game room just for us and we all have great food and had a very competitive championship of pool. Now im not too bad at pool but i was kinda nervous cause i havent played pool since the summer at Big Butts house. So the first round the teams were me and santuh against our bosses Mark and Steve. We thought we might as well give them the money and just move on the next round. BY the way we were gambling on each game. So Mark breaks and it was very powerful and it spread out all the balls and i think that was the best thing they did all game. ME and kevin just rapped there asses at pool. Kevin started and had some real good shots and i finished off the remaining 4 balls including the 8 ball in one turn, I was amazed on how well we did. (Thanks meghan for all the practice during the summer we should play again!?!) After we abliterated them we sat out the next couple games then went back, lost, played again against the bosses and lost then the last game of the night we did a tie breaker between us and the bosses. It was a close game the whole way through but in the end we pulled it together and then won. I was soo hyped i went in with 3 dollors and come out with 2. not too bad for 4 games of pool and the entire dinner was on them and it was seriously the best time ive ever had on any school night and it was high up there on the best night ive ever had. HAHAHAAAHAHAHA!!!! i just remembered we all got "christmas bonuses" and we all had to pull out something from a backpack! WE ALL GOT PORNO! I mean of course i threw mine away right away and im never gonna look at something like that so, ya know. But all in all i had a great time and i wish you guys (whoever might be reading this) were there because it was soo tight. Anywho im a gonner its 2 and i still got school.                        Later loosers                                    "pardon me while a burst and rise above the flame"  - what some rock and roll song for the mandatory quote? Yeah i guess so, meah oh well

      well, another day another dollar some say. unfortunatley it seems like resently I have been loosing that dollar rather than earning it. Even though some days are worse than others my outlook on life is still getting just a smiggin brighter. Winter break(once called Christmas break) is nearer than ever and the tv programs, the songs, and all the lights are only just starting to get anoying. I think there should be a rule on how long christmas lights should be allowed up on ppls houses and light up. Now dont get me wrong i like christmas lights but only for about 2-3 weeks. Ive been looking at the same damn lights sinse the day right after Thanksgiving. People and companies just seem to go overboard on these kind of hollidays, especially this time of year with Halloween, Thanksgiving, and then the combo of Christmas and all the jewish hollidays like Ramashamdama and Limshadishalola. Pardon my spelling but i think you get the drift. I'm tring to bring into light all of the ways companies try to make money. Oh its ALL about the money isint it? Everything costs money you cant go anywhere or do anything with out it. People must have it, and as much of it as possible because the more money you have the better a person you are, isnt that right? Well im here to tell you NO. Its not about the money and at this point your probly asking yourself "What is he talking about?" What im saying is that yes you need money to survive but those ppl who just try to get rich off of other ppl need to rot in hell. Just like with every fad there is a big "proud" sponsor and with all the hollidays everyone wants a piece of someone elses money. They all want your money and how do they acheve this? Who ever it is makes some 30 second commercial on the radio selling whatever crap is cool now-a-days.  The only reason i want to say anything about this is that im a part of what im complaining about. I work at a place that feeds and suports itself off of ppl who just dont know any better than to go to a damn skatepark to find little jimmy a present cause he plays a skateboarding game all the time. BULLSHIT! Parents today dont know shit about their kids or about anything that is going on around them. Especially those who go to a skatepark to find a gift idea. God, I cant wait until this skateboarding fad goes out and some other gay "extreme sport" can get all the coverage. Im so sick of everybody who comes to the skatepark and either just lurks around or who actually skates. More than 85% of those kids arent gonna ever step on a skateboard after they get out of high school. I know, im one of the few of my friends who ever really go and skate anymore. In 7th and 8th grade i had about 8 or so ppl i would go and skate with everyday after school and now look at them. Smoked stupid. Poached and lost forever. Andy quit, Paul quit, we have to make Andrew go and skate now, Danny quit, Mike quit, Alex and Vlad quit, Shanon quit, Chris quit. Do you see a pattern? And they all quit because they were never really into it at all they were just trying to fit in somewhere and thats where society put them for right then. Im not bitter or anything about all of my friends from the junior high school going seperate ways im giving examples from my first hand experience. I just hope that all the little kids who are just doing it for the same reasons that they were quit and quit soon. Im sick of the car pool of soccar moms at the skatepark.    haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......................ok thats off the chest and now im good.   ya know im usually a hip hopper but im listening to an incubus cd that i borrowed from maddie and its pretty damn good. i also heard some smashing pumpkins that i was really into so maybe this is it. im finally broudining my horizons with respect to music.   I learned a kinda cool way to deal with stress today. someone said "all you got to do is grow a funny bone" This pretty much means that you dont need to take life so seriously all the time. if we all were more like " meah whatever" and just laughed things off instead of getting all stressed and taking jokes to heart we would be alot happier ppl. i know i would be. so im gonna try to grow a funny bone about skating. I take it soo seriously and thats why i get upset. But in a way stress can work to your benifit. if im trying to land something and its not working out i might use that stress to push myself to get it done. Really...     i dont know what im talking about.    ever.          so just ill stop and you stop reading my blogs cause they will all be as sensless as this past one.  the following are lyrics from "Message Sent" and "Specialist" by Sage Francis they have nothing to do with anything so you dont even have to read them im just proving that i listen to some better rap than that G unit crap that gets played on the radio  "So its off to the floor because I can't sleep anywhere else That's where I write these letters to all of y'all but never send 'em It's better to just keep to myself  Its better to just keep to myself Its better to just keep to myself"  "The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing  And that's simply adorable  When my time is affordable Dimes pay the price I get abusive and that's the truth It's just a fucking shame this is how I choose to communicate Excuses I produce have their roots in the music I make She's not a fan nor am I famous I may just change and adjust when I branch out Leave, get off my damn couch and achieve What I dream about leave my house hand out my keys To the sleepless beauty who failed math class and can't count her Z's The tree dies She says that she's mine she's my proprietress Can't hold on to most of what I owned Besides she likes to kiss and that's cute I hug her till I start to hurt her She wants to dance to my pulse but I've got heart murmurs A shark circles our lifeboat till its fin folds The monster we created might choke in clothes I'm naked walking tight ropes without big toes Couldn't see this with the night-scope bid my skin glow Fallen Calling for a safety net The great white might train me on my life Bite into my veiny neck where dreams are falling asleep Could dry up once she sees that I bleed off beat Head over heels cause she's tripping on her own feet That puzzled look on her face still isn't complete She gives bits and pieces of herself  While I'm breaking myself open I pour my contents to her shelf Pardon me but is that me wearing my heart out on my sleeve With razor sharp teeth gnawing at my wrist how beautiful is this The most beautifullest thing in the world  Is making up words when I have none else left to say to a girl Making her curl up in a ball in a corner of my eye Taking a time out I don't want her to cry I don't ever want to be considered the sort of guy Who says, "I just might break your face tonight" I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple You dance around me like a fire blow me away blow me away I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple You dance around me like a fire blow me out When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals Over average marriage materialist mister righteous  A savage miscarriage of just us just us And a dust that never settles I'm restless spread some metal to make it weep Cause discussing the ugly nobody wants to fuck with Don't touch me Under appreciative with a with a hundred weaknesses What do I need to live? The blood I bleed is thicker than the skin I shoot people with Need a fist to the air Pretend to make believe she cares To open up old wounds and usual bruises ? I'm a low self-esteem engine in need of a horsepower Out of sleeping powder Dark clouds follow me with heat seekers I need a coke a shower To showboat when its ? Cause it won't float if it turns out these are permanent echoes in his chest I think its best to turn the reverb down Kill the delay  Get me the fuck out of this cave I could paint you pictures all day I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals that way I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals today The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing She thinks I'm something special  She's my specialist More beautiful than sex  Cause only something like sex Makes something so lovely turn ugly and fuck up shit I'm holding a sleepless beauty pageant  On my shark-infested waterbed until it's punctured I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until I pull a muscle I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until its see through Spread my love like the legs of a crack whore We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple You dance around me like a fire  Blow me away blow me away blow me away blow me away I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple You dance around me like a fire blow me out When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals

      so here i am at 4 in the morning, i just finished my paper and i thought i would mess with this blog thing for a while. But anyways. FUCK SCHOOL. Thats all that needs to be said. And by saying(or actually typing)that sentence I am just like everybody else who is at all like me. A failer in more than one way, though my failing days are almost over if you wanna find the sliver of a silver linning it posseses. And even tho I am failing in schoolastic achevements I am however acceling in a completle diferent kind of way. Yes of course i mean skatebording. Every day I find myself living at my second home(3rd lair)and staying there for hours upon end. It was a shocker that today I didnt go down to the skatepark. I guess i kinda got hurt on saturday after my long and relentless 3 hour shift.NOTE:Mark Muller is my ememy. I got cut early from my original 7 hour shift and decided to try to skate on a satuday, it just simply was not working out. So of course instead of quitting I kept going and got hurt. Life is a bitch, and sometimes so am I. I guess I just dont know when to quit skating cause I think in the end I will ultimately be better. But instead I just get hurt and I wake up way too sore the next day to walk for a while, I just hobble around like an 87 year old. But just when frushtration gets to my head I think, "Everything happens for a reason" Its my little on the spot motivational speach to myself. Maybe I got hurt so i couldnt skate on sunday so i could focus on some homework that i desperatly needed done. But just how i cant stop skating, I cant seem to get motivated enough to start my school work. So what do I do? what do i need? How do i need to approch this situation of me just not doing my homework? Well my parents seem to think its some deep personal demon that only a physcatrist can get out. While i belive, no, while i know that its just my life runs in priorities. #1Skating #2my own personal health #3 Others(such as freinds and family NOTE:girlfreinds can take place of #2 and even #1 depending on how serious they are) #4 any other thing in my life that i rather do(i.e. driving, working, sleeping, listing to music, cleaning out my cats litter box, diying) #5 and finally the gay act of going to school #6 and last and extreamly least doing some homowork. Thats usually the order of my life. In any given day only about two or maybe three of these things ever gets done because my life goes in a continuous cycle. I live in a constant ring. OR even i live in constant rings. some are daliy and some are just how things go. So here is the break down of some examples. I do the same shit daily. Get up, go to schoo or to work depending on the day, after that i skate until i get either hurt or frushtrated to the point where i think i will explode(its not very often i will leave thinking im cool or a good skater) after that i will hang out with who ever untill my mom calls me and says if i dont come home now im in "big trouble" whatever that means. Then i proceed home and do whatever, usually watch a little tv and then go online. i get off that anywhere from 11 to 1 and after that I take a shower and procrasinate on homowork untill i get to the point where im like " fuck it" and dont do it.  its a pretty good routine. Now, the other constant rings i seem to follow are cycles that are more than a day and can be more that a week or so. For example, I can never and i mean NEVER hold a solid girlfreind for more than a couple months. My longest real relationship was about 3 months. Am i really that physically and mentaly revolting that nobody can stand me for longer than a couple months? The answer is yes, yes i am. Somehow i have managed to intead of seeze the opportunity to talk to girls and actually try to get a well needed girlfriend, I just think that they would be the same. They would have some kind of annoying habbit or they would finally find my annoying quarks. I dont think i am a very well poised ladies man. I am kinda shy to new ppl especally girls most of the time. And when I do talk to them they all have boyfriends so whats the point? I am to the point now where im gonna keep my eyes and mind open but im not gonna be out there tring my hardest to get and type of ass i can.(see ryan aka hoe slayer) I dont really care, and i think thats the point of being a teenager. The media and all of my peers are gonna verbally beat my sensless untill i just couldnt care less even if i tried. Yes i want a girlfriend and i think it would do me well but I have to find someone who fits my personality and who dosent just "stand" me but embraces my tendancies and what i do and thinks of my higher than i do myself. I know i dont need or have to have a girlfriend but damn it would be nice. I also have the tendency to not talk to my ex-girlfriends for a while or not at all after we break up. Its really weird. I almost never talk to titus and i have just recently started to talk to meghan again. Difference is, titus is still akward and meghan is soo chill. Meghan has this certain amount of cerisma and spunk to her. And she is definatly bleesed with a great sence of humor and i think thats why we get along well. Laughter is one of the greatest things, and if you find a someone who makes you laugh you a really lucky bastard, and you better hold on. With laughter there is never a dull moment or an akward silence. titus was a perfect example of akward. I still to this day dont know why i went out with her. and as sad as that seems i really really wish i could go back in time and never even date her. She had no sinse of humor and her laugh was annoying from day one. Now if i see that in someone i just know i can never date her. Now dont get me wrong meghan dose have quite a laugh on her. when she laughs normal its attractive but if you really make her crack up holy shit you better run cause your gonna need to know sign launguage if she laughs in you ear. now for those who have been blessed to not ever hear her real loud laugh, your probly the only one left so be thankful.   Any way i think i should probly get off this blog deal and go to bed i mean it is 5 so untill next time, drive safely and always tip you pizza delivery guy real good cause if you dont they put you down as a "ungratful constomer" on your little file at the pizza place and you dont wanna make them made. They make your food.     -wes-

      so i guess its been like crazy long huh? Well when shit happens im not used to just running to my "online diary" and tell you guys all about it. If you were there than you know what happened if not, then i might tell you individually and maybe not. but i will tell you all this. im 90% sure im going to SHOC next semester i just got to talk to mrs listiak again and make sure. but i have filled out all the info for it and have talked to alot of ppl who go there and it sounds like something that can suite me more than the senior high.  I will be able to focus highly on skating and not bullshit like Foods or something. i just hope you will all still be my friend even if i do go to a different school.    you know sometimes your friends can piss you off by just not acting like you want them to. I dont mean to sit here and cry about it but/////zdasf vfd?@!(JD///// you know what, fuck it. i dont feel like writing in this bullshit tonight if you wanna know what i was gonna say, too bad. im too tired to write a god damn novel tonight. k bye

      it hasnt ended and it never will. the neverending search for my brain. i swear to God im the dumbest person that i know sometimes. Not saying much cause i dont know that many ppl but still, im borderline retarded. ok whew.  anyway today sucked. i always knew the weather hated me but today i hated it more, for sure. The stupid ass fucking wind was gay as fuck. whew  i have a lot of anger that i never do anything with so i think if i sit here and scream online or i scream at myself maybe i wont snap on anyone else. Note: Dont hang out with wes, he might snap on you. Note #2: scratch the last note. even if wes snaps on you he is too small/week/white/stupid to hurt you so go ahead, hang out with him.(952 200 7680:)       damn that was weird. ok whatever.  nothing much else here i guess. no luck on the girl scene even though i dont even bother check out the local girl scene, trust me its wack. you all should know Sage Francis is the tightest person ever. he is no doubt the best lyrisist on the planet. dont belive me, get some records. but dont make this purchase if you dont like poetry/rapping/art faggotry. but i dont care. I FUCKING LOVE THAT SHIT. im kinda hyped that i like music that other people hate. i think that means i see something in it that no one else sees. k im gone. i like sleep a little more than i like complaining. but just barley.  something you absolutly have to do is go watch these cartoons they are fucking halarious, im sooo serious. check them out here:  http://homestarrunner.com/tgsmenu.html   then pick whatever issue you want. 1 and 5 are funny as hell but so are all of them.  im gonna end this bullshit with lyrics i suggest you dont even bother reading them.  This is to the entertwined souls  the hands ive been trying to hold this is to the love that i lost and all the troubling thoughts on how i got double crossed  and this is to the divorced i was forced to settle with and the remorse i fought off with metal fists this is to the wet watery kiss i left you with on your porch when i watched your tremling lips  and this is to the memory of our early years the first girl i shared  feelings with and its the realest thing id experienced sinse my short existence i aint afraid to admit it cause love is one of the things that doesnt come  with an age limit now does it---------Sage Francis  i will get over it. im dedicated

      ok ok im finally gonna write in this piece of shit. I set this crap up a long time ago and i used it for a while and then stopped cause im lazy or nothing to say or something. Anyway I still dont wanna sit here for a while and type a lot of crap for ppl to read. Mainly cause my life is boring and i think i would put ppl to sleep.   Skateboarding is tight. I am so happy that i skateboard insteed of doing some other crap like football or baseball or soccar. I tried all of those sports and i hated them. Ive been skating for almost five years and ive been hyped on it the whole time. I just now have really fully understood why i do it. IT all has to do with me. I dont ever have to go to some practice and go to some field and play someone else. and if you think about it skateboarding is not even a sport. Baseball or football you say "yeah im gonna go PLAY football and baseball" You dont go and "play" skateboarding, you just decide where to go and go do it. I dont have to skate with anyone, I can just go by myself and do it whereever, whenever and however long i want to. TO me, that is the best part. Not relying on my whole team to get together to play skateboarding. I love it. for a while when i would get to know ppl i would say "yeah i do the whole skateboard thing" and i would kinda hide it from ppl. now, i dont care. if ppl ask what i do i will say "All i do is sleep,school,eat,skateboard, and hang out with meghan whenever she can"(more on that later) I love doing it and i have no problem saying it.  School. I go to shoc now, i dont think i did last time i wrote in here i went there. but shoc is chill except for the ppl. I dont really like school that much but no one does. Whatever, i got to do it but im done soon so whatever  I think ive decided that girls are gay. I dont understand how the ones i know think and i dont think i ever will. I start to get to know somegirl and then get all bummed on them for some reason and i just end up confused. I would go after this stephaine girl but i would rather not die from multipul HIV/AIDS infections so im way off of goin after her. I could try harder with this Monica girl but she is like the most popular girl in her high school and she is way to into what she looks like so she is pretty much the opposite from me. Yes they do say opposite attract but I jsut dont think it would work. Plus i cant figure out what she would want from me, i mean, c'mon. 2 options down. I am currently getting to know emily hatcher more and more. I like that she is kinda shy. I like the way she dresses. And when i hang around her i can detect some sort of humor and i really love humor in women, etc etc. you get the point. But now i hear she has a boyfriend, so i dont know what is gonna happen with that. If anything ill get another female friend and those are always good, i guess. not what im looking for excatly but, good. I know im not just gonna stop talking to her, i know that for sure. Now for Meghan. I know her more than any other girl even my sister or mom. When i hang out with her im happy and content with myself. I know i dont need anything but her but i also know the feeling is not mutual. We havent been considered a couple for like half a year but i would go back out with her in a heartbeat, there is no question. Im not good at reading ppl and so that leaves me with a girl that is perfect for me that im really good friends with but i still dont feel like i know what the hell she thinks about me! I know about this jake dude and im afraid that hes is super hot and he is perfect for her. Really, im just a jealous freak trying to hold on to an X that i still have overwelming feelings for. I wish i was over it sometimes. cause all it does is make me sick to think about it. I never thought she would actually succeed in finding someone else. Shows how smart i am. maybe something else i liked about her was that i felt "safe." Meaning that ppl who date celebreties have to somehow be supirior than everone else so the girl will stay with them and not leave him. I didnt really have that problem when i was dating her because most ppl are shallow and dont look further than freckles. But i think i was wrong in thinking that, obviously. I got more to say on her(i always do)but i dont think im ready to say them and i know she doesnt want to hear it. some how i have to get over her and just think of her as a friend but thats hard to do. Most ppl have a problem with finding someone they like a lot but I dont have that problem. my problem is to get that person to like me back. It wont happen, and i wish i would wake up and realize that but im still dreaming and no one can wake me up.    I hate being me sometimes.    so there i wrote in my blog now for another 2 months of silent hibronationZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

      Sometimes we make life very difficult for ourselfs. We may refuse to see the good in anything or anyone. We will criticize, judge or blame others because we forget when our choices were not wise. What we dont seem to realize is that when we voice words of struggle and strife, we draw more of it into our experience. We create our own well-being according to the way we conduct our mind, mouth, and heart. When we speak of good, we see it. When we cleanse our heart of fear, anger, and strife, we place ourselves on a higher level that before. Be possitive and supportive of the apparent, though, often thin, silver lining in our dark clouds. The best part is smiling in the rain.   haha better than bitching about myself huh?  we will talk later      wes

      whats up. i just redid my blog because i wanted to. it was time for something new to look at for me and for you (whoever "you" may be) and not to mention i saw meghans and hers was all cool and stuff so i wanted to change mine too. making no decisions on my own just following the pack. nothing unusual. well thats kinda it. my job still sucks and so does my park skating. i concentrated soooo much on flat ground that i stoped skating the park. so i did today and i was super rusty. ill get it back. i got some new compact disks today and i love then all soo much i swear to god i like underground/underated hip-hop so much i might as well make it. hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

      so i tried to call up monica today and see what she was up too, but instead got her sister and so i proceded to ask "is monica there?" and i got "hey wes" so me and amanda talked for a while and i guess monica's mom found alcohol in her room and she is at bootcamp! so for the next month i guess she is having a lot of fun. so thats over i think im done ever calling her again so there goes that. so instead me and amanda hung out and that was ok i guess. we saw the worst movie ever and then went to chipotle so i guess it turned out good. AFter i dropped her off i went to a meeting at 3rd and they are getting gayer by the day. I will quit that job before i graduate from high school im soooooo tired of that job i cant even tell you. I soooo just...          burned out. im tired of talking about and working around and giving lessons to little children who dont care about skateboarding. i want a job where i can come in, work, and leave and no one gives me shit and i can actually depend on the amount of money i need because the job is stable. im tired of not knowing when i work next. im tired of being schedualed once ever OTHER week. im tired of Mark. im tired of Steve. im tired of the employees who suck the dicks of my bosses just because thier new. im tired of being compared to them. im tired of everything at my gay ass job. i dont care if im a hospital janitor or something im not gonna work there to support myself. im soo done with that job.    ok im also tired in general, so ill see ya when i see ya. joke of the day.   IF you missed fifth grade graduation because you had joury duty, you might be a red neck.   P.S. im still waiting for that call meghan, haha im making you call me. c'mon lets do something.  wesley stephen hickman-  thats my name

      well, not much new to post as of yet.  met the new boyfriend and he seems like a REAL super dude!!!(sarcasim) I got told I suck at school a lot this week and for some reason or another had an overwelming feeling of just wanting to be alone. So i was. I dont mind being alone especially when im mad or whatever and Ive been spending too much time with ppl who are just to damn excited for me. Im not that excited all the damn time. So, yeah. Im kinda over this whole OUT competition I just want it to be over with. Sooooo many ppl are talking sooooo much about it and making suuuuch and big deal over it when really, nobody will care the next day. ITs a little pussy stupid contest that is blown WAY out of proportion. Maybe im just nevous about it cause i wanna do really well in it and maybe win again but the odds of that happening is slim to none. Idk, we'll see what happens. Seriously tho, if C.J. wins i will cry. just because he doesnt deserve to win. thats all. IT has nothing to do with how much hes an ass and how much I hate him, no nothing to do with any of those reasons at all.(more sarcasim) anyway im bout to go eat with the family and take my dearest daddy to the airport then im calling whats her head to see if she can hang out. so ill see ya when i see ya.  P.S. i wish i new how to spell "sarcasim"
