      Ever since I got a B- on a short story I wrote for English class back in 1971 I have had an unrelenting desire to get published. Over the past 35 years I have had an essay, a short story (The Coin) and a poem published. You may be thinking "He's not vey prolific", and you'd be right, but hey, I've been busy! As of July 1, 2004 I have begun work on a novel. A daunting task yet I feel confident that I can write it; it's just selling it that makes me nervous. Now that I know what a 'blog' is I will keep a diary telling you the reader all the mistakes...er....I mean all the great decisions I made culminating in the sale of the book.

      Mr. Novak pulled a gold watch out of his vest pocket as he strode down Main Street. As he had done countless times before he admired the engraved image of an Amtrak sleeper train on its lid before it popped open. It was a retirement gift for 40 years faithful service as an Amtrak conductor. It was his pride and joy. Unfortunately, his pride and joy still read 11:10 from the last time he checked it. The revolving clock that stood before the Frosty Hollow Credit Union read 12:10. He missed his doctor’s appointment by forty minutes. The man scowled at the thought that he would have to pay a ‘broken appointment’ fee. Mr. Novak tapped on the watch crystal. The second hand remained still. He twisted the crown backward and forward to rewind the watch movement then lifted the timepiece to his ear as he stepped into a crosswalk.  His distress over the watch’s mechanical failure was shattered by the sound of a powerful air horn. The startled railroad man jumped backward onto the sidewalk as a Road Wizard street sweeping machine thundered past him. Mr. Novak wiped perspiration off his brow with a handkerchief. He was suddenly struck by the notion that maybe he should go home and, as he was about to turn around to do just that, he saw the sign at Ye Olde Sweete Shoppe. He decided that a tasty treat would be better than a hasty retreat. Once safely across the road Mr. Novak first stopped at the coin shop which was adjacent to the candy store. The Coinucopia was a coin collector’s heaven on earth. The elderly gent peered into the storefront window and his eyes grew wide in astonishment. At the center of the display he saw a photograph of a coin from Germany. The coin had a stylized eagle perched atop a Swastika. The actual coin rested on a pedestal near the photo and an index card leaned against the pedestal. It read: Berlin 1941. I want that coin, thought Mr. Novak. He walked to the Coinucopia’s door and turned the handle; it would not open. He knocked on the door. Not a soul stirred inside the coin shop. “What is it with these people?” Mr. Novak said to himself. It was then that he saw a hastily written sign taped to the door. He lowered his head and peered over the top of his glasses to read the notice aloud: “ ’Closed due to death in family. Will reopen Thursday.’ That’s just great.” He sighed and walked to Ye Olde Sweete Shoppe. A silver bell tinkled as Mr. Novak entered the candy store. He inhaled an aromatic blend of chocolate, butterscotch, and cinnamon.  “Good morning, Mr. Novak,” the confectioner said cheerfully. Mr. Novak nodded his head and said, “Petersen.” Mr. Petersen poured half a dozen Hershey kisses from a plastic trowel into a small paper sack. “Anything else, Kenny?” The nine-year-old tapped a tooth with his finger as he looked at all the sweet opportunities before him. Peppermint sticks, nonpareils, candy buttons, and peanut butter cups tempted the youth. “No,” Kenny said. Mr. Petersen tallied up the sale and entered the amount on the cash register. “That’ll be eighty-nine cents, please.” Kenny dug into his pants pocket and pulled out a fistful of coins. Several coins fell from his hand and clattered on the floor. As the boy scurried to collect his stray coins he saw one quarter roll toward Mr. Novak who nonchalantly placed a wingtip shoe over the coin. Kenny looked up at the man. “Why aren’t you in school?” Mr. Novak said. “S-schools not till next week,” Kenny said. The boy stood up accepting the fact that his quarter was no longer his. He counted out eighty-nine cents on the glass counter then put the remainder of his money back into his pocket. Mr. Petersen pushed the coins off the edge of the counter; the coins fell into his hand. “Thanks, Kenny. Say ‘hi’ to your mom for me.” “Okay,” Kenny said. He picked up his bag of goodies. He glared at the coin thief as he left the store. “Enjoying the beautiful day, Mr. Novak? Mr. Petersen said. “I’ll have some of your overpriced candy.” The confectioner laughed. “Give me four of those,” Mr. Novak said, pointing at a glass jar filled with miniature peanut butter cups. “That’s all.” While Mr. Petersen scooped four peanut butter cups out of the glass jar Mr. Novak crouched to retrieve his ill-gotten gain. “That’ll be twenty-one cents please.” Mr. Petersen folded the top of the paper sack and handed it to his grumpy customer. Mr. Novak paid for his treat with Kenny’s quarter. The old cash register clanged and its drawer opened. “Four cents is your change,” Mr. Petersen placed four pennies in the center of Mr. Novak’s palm. “Thanks, have a wonderful day.” The tinkling of the silver bell was Mr. Novak’s reply. Mr. Novak popped a peanut butter cup into his mouth as he watched the traffic pass by. He rolled the candy wrapper into a tight ball and flicked it into the street. He savored the tasty blend of chocolate and peanut butter as he watched the wrapper fall between the slats of a storm drain.  A glint of light caught Mr. Novak’s attention. He stooped to get a better look into the drain. His bushy eyebrows lifted in surprise when he saw the arc of a golden coin protruding from the debris-riddled sand below. He noted the close proximity of the Coinucopia to the storm drain. His heart rate accelerated as he imagined some poor schmuck unknowingly dropping the coin. In his mind’s eye he saw the coin roll across the sidewalk and fall into the storm drain. That’s his tough luck, thought Mr. Novak. He unfolded his handkerchief; smoothed it out onto the sidewalk; then knelt on it. He rested his right hand on the edge of the curb as he tried to squeeze his other hand between the slats of the storm drain. The gap was too narrow. He noticed that the fingers of his right hand were folded into the curb. He stepped into the street and looked at the curb. There was a rectangular opening cut into the concrete curb. Mr. Novak knelt on the tarmac and reached into the opening. It was a tight fit but his hand was closer to his nearly buried treasure. An all-consuming desire for the coin impelled the man to do the unthinkable. He lied down on the road. As the afternoon traffic passed several feet from his head, Mr. Novak reached into the storm drain. He stretched his arm as far as it would go. The tip of his middle finger gently grazed the coin.  Two waitresses stood outside a McDonald’s restaurant as they shared a cigarette. They spoke about the plans they had for the weekend. “Hey, Elaine,” Carol said. “Look at that man in the street. Do you think he is hurt?” Elaine exhaled smoke and said, “That’s no man, that’s Mr. Novak.” “Maybe we should…” Elaine could not hear the rest of Carol’s comment because the roar of the street sweeping machine drowned it out as it turned onto Main Street. Its driver gave his undivided attention to the buxom waitresses. He blew his air horn and waved. The girls waved back and seemed to be yelling at him. The driver pointed at his ear and shook his head. Mr. Novak glanced over his shoulder and saw the hungry maw of the mechanical behemoth heading straight for him. Gripped by a profound fear the elderly gentleman tried to stand up but his movement was impeded by that the fact that he could not pull his arm out of the storm drain. The harder he pulled the arm the more firmly it remained wedged in place. Mr. Novak screamed. The Road Wizard hit a big bump. The driver reacted by slamming on the breaks. The street sweeping machine skidded to a halt. The driver got out of the truck and looked for the cause of the bump. There was nothing in the road. Elaine ran up to the driver. He asked her if she saw what just happened. “There was a man lying on the ground by that drain,” Elaine said. They both saw Carol staring into the drain; they ran to her. She was crying. “Christ,” the driver said. He saw the sinew from Mr. Novak’s shoulder sticking out of the storm drain. Elaine pulled Carol away from the storm drain. Mr. Novak’s arm was dangling over the gold coin. Blood trickled down the arm and dripped from all five fingers, creating a rough circle of blood around the coin. The driver looked back at his truck and understood where the rest of the man’s body was. He fell to his knees and vomited on the sidewalk. Mr. Novak’s arm swayed above the coin. It seemed to be reaching out for the coin as if determined to complete Mr. Novak’s original task. The arm suddenly fell to the bottom of the storm drain and, either out of reflex or desire, the hand closed around the coin.  The candy coin…   ©2004 Donald R Lamelin
