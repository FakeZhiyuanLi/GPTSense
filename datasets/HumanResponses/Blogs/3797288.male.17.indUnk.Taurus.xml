      So nothing goes as planned in my life, i was going to go to lowes and pick up some stuff for the basement and then hang drywall the rest of the day. But instead my dad decided to cut the grass this morning and the lawn mower broke, so i fixed it, but that took a while. Then on the way to the store i got stuck in traffic and in long lines in the store, so by the time i got home it was time for dinner. After i ate i dint fell like hanging any drywall because it is almost impossible to hang it on the ceiling by ur self, and i was the only one home. So know i guess i have to hang as much as i can tomorrow before i go to work, but who know if that will happen.

      Ok, so im sick of aim cutting off my profile, im sick of taking the time to update my sub profile, and im sick of my self hosted sub profiles getting shut down for having "illegal content" on the server, so i decided to give a blog a change. Its easier to update and i dont have to worry about it being shut down. Ive kind of been a lazy mother f****r for the last week, i didnt shave and i just sat around most of the day. Today i realized that doing that sucks, i cut the grass, went for a ride on my bike, and shaved, also im going to go to the store in the morning to get some stuff i need for the basement and then im going to work down there most of the day and try to get all that i can possibly get hung. I have to work on thursday, but im going to try to hang some before i have to go to work, b/c i dont have to go in late. I should have another post tomorrow, but in the mean time, keep in touch, jdim05, expertgamer428@yahoo.com

      I had to go to the hospital again to get some x-rays done, and it took around 2 HOURS!!! Ans during the x-rays the pain started to come back b/c the dye was pushing on some of the stones, and they could give me any pain killers so i had to lay there, not beeing aloud to move,&nbsp;feeling like some one was icking me in my nuts and i had a fat woman standing on top of me for 2 hours! And then when i got home i had to drink 10 glases of water to flush the dye out, b/c it can be toxic if left in the kidneys to long, so i have been going to the bathroom all day. But the only good thing was that the radiologist was hot, but that doesnt make up for the pain. i need to get out and just go do something for a while if anyone wants to do anything LET ME KNOW! Well im i dont have to much more to say, so i u want to talk to me about this extreme pain, im me.

      Today i got up and did NOTHING, i hate this. I had lunch, went to flashback, ran out to elyria, went to work, and now im sitting here doing nothing. Tomorrow i have to get up at 7 to go to the hospital and get another xray done to see if any of the stones moved and if i passes one or two of them, or none of them, trust me u dont want to get any of them, they hurt like hell. Besides that there not to much that new from the last post, and there probilly wont be anything new in the nexy one and then next one and so on for like a week and a half, lol. Well im out for now, going to go watch tv and then bed so i can get up at 7.

      Well lets see, ive spend the last 2 days in the hospital, and got out today at 2:30. I guess i have some kidney stones, lets just say they hurt like hell. I had to go to the er when i got up on sunday and then got admited to the hospital in the after noon. I spent most of the morning half&nbsp;out of it and didnt really know what was going on b/c they took so many blodd samples and were giving me so many drugs and stuff, so i guess u could say i was "drugged up". Seeing how they were weeling me around in the bed most of the morning giving me x-rays and cat scans and stuff, just to tell me i have some kidney stones and there is nothing they&nbsp;can really do, except give me some painkillers. Since the last pain killer i got was sunday after noon, they let me go home this afternoon, and guess what, after dinner, my kidney started hurting, so i took a pill, now that pill is going to wear off in alittle bit, and i hope the pain is gone., b/c when im on the pills in not aloud to drive, and i have things i want to do tomorrw. I missed work on sunday, so i lostbout $37 and i dont want to miss work tomorrow and lose some more money. Well, i have to get another x-ray with some dye shit, some time this week and then go to the doctor next monday. So hope fully things go well for the rest of the week, wish me luck, that these DAMN thing dont pass and stay were they are so the dont hurt like HELL!!!!

      I had the day off today, and what did i do, NOTHING. i hung some drywall in the base, which i hope to finish tomorw before work, and i took , i guess what u could call a lazy day, and watched tv and played video games for the rest of the day. I have done that in a while. I also started to download some of the movies i want to see, unless i end up getting a girlfriend and going to the movies with her, i probilly wont pay to go see them. They probilly wont finish for a couple of days, so we'll see how thing go. Tomorrw i plan on trying to finish the drywalling before work, but nothin goes as planned for me.   And i am still WAITING for my grandpa to pay me the $140 he owes me for cutting is grass, i hope he pays me soon, because i could use that money to&nbsp; buy some dvd and some pc games, cough cough, for those of u that know me, if u know what i mean. Im working 5 days again this week and ill probilly only end up with 21 hours b/c of the days i worked,so ill onyl make 130 this week, &nbsp;and next week i only work 4 days so ill only end up with like $100. I only need 3 more grand to get the car i really want, but that will take untill christmas, that is if i dont spen any money on anything else.

      Well, like all of my recent days, i didnt go out and do anything. Today i got up, had lunch, hung some dry wall downstairs, had dinner,&nbsp;went to work, and then came home b/c i was to tired to do anything else. im starting to get sick of working downstairs b/c it takes up to much of my time and between that and work i cant really do anything else. But tomorrow i should get the rest of the drywall hung, anf then after thiss week end i should have alot more time on my hands b/c i only work 4 days next week, so hopefully i be able to go out and do something.  And i REALLY NEED to get a GIRLFRIEND!!!

      I didnt get any drywall hung today, but i did break up all of the scraps that were left and cut up to rest of the wood, so i can throw all that away tomorrow. I dont know if ill get anything done tomorrow b/c i think im cutting my grandpa's grass tomorrow after lunch, and then maybe cutting mine. Then ill probilly go out and do some stuff, not sure yet so if u want to do anything im me or call. I lucked out today at work b/c we weren't busy ao i got to leave after i made dough so i was only there for like 2 hours. Its cool b/c i show up, make dough, and then get to leave (normally during the week), which pisses some ppl off (amber). But this also sucks ass b/c i dont make to much when im there for only 2 hours, and then i have to take a shower before i go anywere b/c i stink like angelos, but what can i do, quick and have no job, or keep this one and have something to complain about.

      well, i didnt do to much today, i went to the mall and wor, what a boring day. At work i had to cook for a while b/c charlie didnt show up and there was no one esle to cook. Keep in mind that i have never worked oves before, and i have only cooked one pizza there, but i guess i did ok, i didnt burn anything except for my thumb. But i only had to make 3 batches of dough tonight, so i bet i will be screwed tomorrow, but i cant do anyhting about it, except call of sick, lol, but i wouldnt do that b/c i need the money. I thin i will probily try to get the rest of the drywall hung in the basement before i have to go to work but fo some reason thing never go as planed for me.

      And as another day of work passes, i hate it even more, but those ppl make it worth it, lol. But i made dough yet again (8 batches), and it took me till 10:30 to finish, but oh well. I got some more drywall hung up in the basement today, but i think ill take a couple days off from doing that. &nbsp; My cousins are in from out of town, and the one that is my age brought his girlfriend with him, and she's hot, lucky bastard, i wish i had a girlfriend that looked like that, well i just wish i had a girlfriend. I might go bowling with them tomorrow before i have to work, but we have to fing somewhere that has open bowling before 5, so i dont know if well get to do that.&nbsp; but u want to go, let me know. Well, seeing as the is no one on aim, and i have nothing to do i guess ill go watch some tv.

      Finally i got some work done downstairs, and i will probilly get some more done tomorrow. Im off tomorrow, so i will most likely have some time to get some drywall hung. I still hate work, it was hot as hell in there tonight, and it will probilly be like that on thursday night to. Also i dont go in untill 7:30 so i bet i will have to stay to close, thats going to sucks, but the longer im there, the more cash ill get. But lets just say there are a couple of people that make it worth it!

      Work was so boring today b/c we were so slow, but i lucked out with dough tonight b/c i only had to make 3 batches, but this is going to screw me tomorrow, when i have to make dough. Also i hate my days off next week b/c the are separated, b/c im off monday and wednesday. But i get paid to hardly do anything on the week end so i really dont care about my days off.  I dint do to muchm i watched spiderman, so that took up most of the day, and then i spent the rest of the day trying to make a "back up" copy of it, and working.

      Well, i didnt do to much during the day, but after i went to work and made dough, i went to my uncles house for a party and to watch the fireworks. I thought i would get eatin alive by the bugs like i normally do, but i guess i lucked out for once because i only got one bite. Today im probilly going to work downstairs most of the day, and then i have to head to work at 7 to make dough again (i hate being "dough bitch"), and then i dont know what im going to do after that, or what im going to do on my two days off.

      Well i was sopposed to be at that pig roast all day, but that ended eairly, and there were no drunks for once. I didnt have any plans for tonight and i didnt want to stay home so i went to see spiderman 2. It was good, but it would have probilly helped if i would have seen the first one. Since im a cheap bastard ill probilly go rent the first one and then make a "back up" copy of it, lol. This next week is going to suck ass b/c i have to work 5 day, and im making dough all 5 days, so that is really going to tire me out and make me sore, but u gota do what u gota do for money. Well, theres not to muc on tv so im going to go take a shower and then probily go to bed.

      I got up, ate lunch, and then started to hang drywall downstairs. I got a couple of sheets up and then i was time to get ready for work. On the way to work I had to stop at Joels house to give him his game and 5 bucks. By the time i got back in the car and was on my way to work i looked at the clock and i only had 3 min to make a 10 min drive, so i was going like 50mph all the way there. When i got there my clock said it was 5:05, and i was like damn im late, abut when i walked in it was 4:55, so i guess the clock in the car was off, and i was speeding for nothing. Work was pretty easy today, and im off tomorrow b/c i have a pig roast im going to all day tomorrow, so i should have some good stores about the drunk people in my post tomorrow.

      Today i woke up and my back was killing me, but i still hung some drywall downstairs. Then i had to go to work just to make dough, so i was like this shouldnt take to long and it shouldnt make my back hute anymore. But there wasn't no 5 batchs like normal, there was f*****g 9 batchs. I tool my time so i could get some more money out of it, but that really made my back hurt even more. I hope it doesnt hurt tomorrw b/c i have to hang some more drywall, and i have to go to work at 5. I think im going to copy UT2K4 (dvd edition) i hope it works.

But rob said if i get good grades i can work 5 days a week again, since ive been getting strait a's i should be working 4 or 5 days a again pretty soon. I have to go get my senior picstures on tuesday, so thats going to sucks ass b/c i hate getting dressed up and i have to take three outfits, and its going to be in the studio and at some park somewhere, so i guess i will coperate so i can get it done with as fast as i can.  I bet u cant guess what ive been doing alot of lately, NOTHING, ive ben for f'ing bored lately, it just seems like theres nothin to do and no one wants to do anything, so ive resorted to riding my bike alot, i guess that good be a good thing seeing how i dont get any exercice except for that.

      Yesturday, i attempted to fix my uncles computer, and succeded! Then i started to back up all of his stuff, and i finished that today. Then i went to work at 5, and got screwed on dough b/c waller made it the day before and sorted it again, i want to kill that jackass, but i finished at 9:30, which was surprisingly early. I hate being so fast at doug b/c 2 days a week that all i go in for so its almost like a waste of my time when i only go in for an hour 1/2- 2 hours, but what am i going to do about it. I finally asked, i put it off for a while, im not sure why, but i got a yes.  And today, im bored out of my mind b/c no one wants to do anything b/c they all have to go to work. Hopefully my buiding trades class at school wont be to labor intensive b/c im going to be working 5 days a week again. I also hope the ms coco did fruck up my schedule again b/c im only sopossed to have 4 classes this year , and i dont wish to have to fight with her again, b/c she always says its not her fault! I got nothin else to say for now, c ya bitch's
