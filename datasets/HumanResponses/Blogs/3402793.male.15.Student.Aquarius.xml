      What would you do if you could cut reality in half? You make your dreams come true, your truest passions become a reality? But again, you can't so don't get your hopes up. But what if a simple sword, a cutlass if you will, could cut reality open, revealing its true secrets to the world. Could you truly alter your life to your pleasing, making everything happen your way? That brings me to my next point, your truest desires. Reality makes itself whole on creating these desires that are unreachable. Hence why reality isn't perfect. I truly cannot see what actually would happen to the world if reality would be in our power to control. I just cannot under any circumstances why we would want the perfect life. There would be nothing to live for, just a plain, expected world. Then, as my final word, take this into consideration-If you expect the unexpected, does the unexpected than become the expected? So long my fearless readers.

      This blog, my second, obviously, will be in dedication to my good friend Alex. She is always there for me, I that I appreciate. She is the true poet I know. She's an inspiration to many, and a friend to all. But, enough about her. My English class spawns much poetry in me. Yes, that may be corny, but its true. It also, in many other views, makes me say some funny things. One of these is "Imagine, if you will, a world without hypothetical situations." That, if you can't tell, is the basis of this entry. Here is where I announce my plans. If you have a quote, one completely original, e-mail it to me, and I will post it along with my thoughts. This, hypotetically, will spread your quote to make it widely know. Something all of us poets strive for. But, untill I recieve my first quote, I shall just write my peotry in these entries. Please send me these quotes, so that your inner poet can be revealed to the world.

      Well...where to begin. This being my first ever blog, I really don't know what to say. First, however, is the site title. You're probably wondering about it, and don't worry, it does make sense. While doing a creative writing for English, my friend Alex, the girl with a poet's soul, wrote one of the best things I've ever heard, but it had no title. So, I gave it the title "(untitled...thus far.)" This turned out to be a new era for my life. Those three little words and ellipses soon began to title nearly everything that was in association with my life. I know you are probably thinking I'm a freak, and I am. I don't care though. So many people think odd things of me, and I'm used to it. I am an active member of the National FFA Organization, and am going to nationals for the Parlimentary Procedure competition. Yeah, well, I'm really boring. As for me, I am 15, and live in Oxford, CT. My name is Pat, and I go to school at the Ellis Clark Regional Agri-Science and Technology Center. Well, now you know me, or so you may think. Take these next words as you will, for they may bring joy, sorrow, anger, or no emotion at all.  "Embrace the end as a beginning, and the beginning as an end, then your life will follow it's true course, and end up where you don't want it to go."
