      Ah yes, I finally got a tagboard up today with the help of my super-duper Mistro friend Shizhen!! Yeah thanks alot dude! If it we're not for you I would probably be phucking up this blog with indecipherable code. :p  But thats not the only thing i Got today! Oh no sir!   I got  A new Hairstyle...  Woo!Yeah! Gone was the look of a ravaged jungle savage, replaced with the look of a slightly less ravaging jungle savager! Yeah this is supposed to be for my so-called photo shoot next week. My sister's friend Elnie is using me as a model for her photos. Pretty weird huh? I'm so fugly! Why Me? A luoHan looks cuter than me!   Hahahas anyway i'm probably gonna be dressed up like a doll, a gothic doll. Complete with eye-liner and scary makeup foundation and shit. Look Forward to the photos People! Its an opportunity to laugh your ass off and Blackmail me at the sametime!  Yeah besides these things nothing much happened today...wanted to go jogging early this morning but i was glued to my bed as usual. Played a couple of games, brought my dog for a walk. Wanted to see a certain someones face but she wasn't there...sigh.  She went out to buy presents for teachers day...and a guy she liked. Ooooh I was so damn jealous!!! But nevertheless i could do nothing. Ah f*ck it. Let's get this sad shit out of the way and bring out the juicy part!! Slurp!!  Hahha If you read untill here it means that you've Waited for the Premiere Episode of my Bastard Plan! Which now will be officially Named:  [Think You're talking to a Girl? Think Again!]  Alrighty Then! let's get this show on the Road!  -The Intro-  It all started with my Friend Ridwan. You see, one day he was messaging his friend, but he typed in a wrong phone number. The difference was by 1 digit so he didnt noticed immediately. So off his message went to some Tom,Dick or Harry's phone. It was then he got a Reply from someone.   "Who r u?" , Replied the person.  "Oh sry, Wrg Num", Wan said. That would have been the end of it all, However the person Replied BACk!(insert Gasp sfx here)  "Its ok, may i noe ur name?" The freak asked.  "Ridwan. y?"  And so this smsing continued Untill the person was identified to be Jessica who is Sec 1 from some school i forgot and just dont give a shit for. It turns out that Jessica would msg Wan sumtimes, just to chat. Wan was just indifferent, and didnt really bother much.  And Then it Happened!(Insert scream sfx here) Another Message Came From Beyond!an Unknown Number!(x-files theme)  "How you know jessica?", The unknown guy messaged.  "Who r u? i just wrongly msg her tats all." Wan answered.  Just to speed things up...The prick who messaged Wan Started to act Tough!Saying he was 16 years old from Ang mo kio Sec. Asking Ridwans Age and where did he stay. He even TRIED to insult wan! OMG what a retard:  ACTUAL DOCUMENTATION: "Listen,HOMOSAPIEN, Your English is not even up to standard for you to be in SP."  Just tell me how immature and pathetic this brat is!?  Anyways, It turns out that this Pricklet is only 13 years old! Jesus! I would have kissed a donkeys ass if he was 16!   This kid is so dumb he'd look at an apple and ask "What is that?" Then Finally he told Wan not to disturb Jessica any more, and dont message her. He acts like he is Jessicas Bf, but the fact is-he's not!  So anyway i got pissed with this guy, cos this kid really needs to be taught a lesson! So we came up with an evil and devious Plan! I would message him and Pretend to be a Horny Slutty Sec 3 Mayflower Sec sch girl who is interested in young guy such as (retarded) Jeffery!  Ahhahahaha! Alright thats all for tonite! Stay Tuned for Next Episode of! [THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO A GIRL? THINK AGAIN]

      Let there Be light! Shineth unto thee...Almighty blog!  Well Well, Looks like i finally created this blog, because of my classmates. (Most of them have blogs...didn't want to be left out :p) Hehe, Now...How shall I start this significant Post? Ah okay, i'll talk about today then.  Today, I had a CYA (Changi Youth Ambassador) meeting today. I didn't go, despite multiple notices. Why? Maybe because I was too lazy...or i was glued to my bed. Then wan (ridwan, my best friend) annoyed me by calling me up, and trying to persuade me to get my ass up n off my bed.  "Hey, you bitch! Go cya ah!"  "Why?!"  "Cos...I'm your Friend(kerpal). No lah! Cos if you dun go then i got no fren lah, just go lah bitch!"  "Dun wan lah, f*ck."  "Aiyah you idiot...ah okay bye."  "Ah."  Sigh, so with the rest of the day free I had to do something, so I called up Kelvin and decided to Go DOWNTOWN! lah lah lah lah lah.(sorry, coulndt help it :p)  We went to bugis, parco around there. Played at the arcade-Ate-Played LAN-Ate-Plated Arcade again-ATE...OMFG! Kelvin sure eats alot! Jesus! we ate 3 times in less than 6 hours! first was Yoshinoya...then Delifrance...then Chicken on a stick...then Thai Beefkwayteow.  So after our last meal, we took the train home...and we we're talking about bastard(ing) people, blah blah. Kelvin started doing moonwalks and we were chatting about dance moves, then the train came. We boarded..and much later the voice announced next stop kallang..  Shit, we took the wrong train! haahha we were so caught up in talking about dance moves we took the wrong train towards changi side!We laughed so hard at our mistake.  god dammit...  Next Episode  I will introduce the very first bastard plan on this guy named Jeffery! who is sec 1 this year in Ang mo kio sec! muhahaha stay tuned ppl.
