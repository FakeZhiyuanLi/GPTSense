      Last night I received message from a friend in Minnesota. He told me he had had the same crush for years and had finally laid that to rest in pursuit of another woman. He said he cared for this other woman, and she cared for him as well. He thought he was lucky in love until he heard that this old crush had actually had feelings for him long ago. Now he is completely distraught because he thinks he may still have feelings for this old crush.  Sounds like a soap opera from 10th grade.  This man is an adult and it stresses me to hear him so upset at something so juvenile. Its completely forgivable considering he hasn't much experience with women, but still very frustrating for myself to relate to.  Since I’ve known this guy he seems to base his entire worth around whether he has someone to be with, or to crush on.  It’s a sad revelation, but he’s not alone.  What happened to the days where men were men, and women were women?  I don’t mean to rant, but as a woman I feel uncomfortable going against any of my sisters in the women’s rights movements, but something must be said. I am proud to call myself EQUAL and for that I thank you, but my soul aches when I think we’ve gone beyond equality and strait into dominance.  There is nothing more I can post about this topic at this time, but I assure you, I’m not done yet. If there is one thing I still hold near and dear to me is my right as a women to overanalyze every situation and beat dead horses with big fucking sticks!

      I've been on this road for a while now. I still have no idea where I’m going. I keep stopping and asking for directions, but nobody can seem to help me. I guess this is something I’m supposed to do alone, I’ve asked friends and family for guidance along my way, but they’ve all abandoned me. It’s ok, I'm strong, and where there is coffee there is a way.  WAIT.... I think that's supposed to be, "where there is a will there is a way". LOL, my bad, but this certainly is a long road, this "self-discovery", this carbon-copied mind-set we all get in when we hit 23.  I want out. Where’s the exit? What? No exit? Well, I guess I keep driving; after all, it beats walking.  What is it I’m supposed to be looking for on this road anyway? Is it religion, clarity, focus, expression, definition, fellowship? I have no idea. How about a friend, I think I could use one of those. Where does a grown woman find a friend these days anyway? Women are to catty and men all end up having crushes and when they find love they toss me aside.  Maybe I’ll just wait for my son to grow up and seduce his friends LOL. I’m totally kidding.  Maybe I’ll get a dog, one that doesn’t get car sick.

      A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge. -- Carl Sagan

      How about my favorite Einstein Quotes as they apply to Humanism.  ---- >>>  Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind. --Albert Einstein  Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one. --Albert Einstein  Human beings, vegetables, or comic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune intoned in the distance by an invisible player --Albert Einstein  Do you believe in immortality? No, and one life is enough for me --Albert Einstein  How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose we know not, though sometimes sense it. But we know from daily life that we exist for other people, first of all for whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends. --Albert Einstein  Scientists were rated as great heretics by the church, but they were truly religious men because of their faith in the orderliness of the universe. --Albert Einstein  A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. --Albert Einstein  A human being is part of the whole called by us   universe   , a part limited in time and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty... We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive. --Albert Einstein  I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. [He was speaking of Quantum Mechanics and the breaking down of determinism.] My religiosity consists in a humble admiratation of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance...but for us, not for God. --Albert Einstein The Human Side, 1954  ---->>>>
