      People nowadays just don't have it... Usually I can handle homework normally. But when it come's to a single Chinese homework, I can't seem to finish it... Well, either that or it'll take me 2 hours to finish it. I hadn't done that particular Chinese homework, which is about snipping an article from a Chinese daily, paste it in the excercise book, find words from the dictionary and lastly,  write your own opinion ... Aw crap, what Chinese opinions could come out of this English based brain?  I  thought  I could trust my friend to help me find 3 articles and write down a simple sentence about the article's opinions... I phoned him on Saturday to tell him about the homework, he said he could do it and phoned him on Monday, which was a holiday, to collect the homework...   I phoned him at 2pm, his grandmother said he had gone out to buy something... I phoned again at 5pm, his aunt said he wasn't at home and didn't know where he was... Phoned again at 7pm, his sister said that he went out with his mother... Dunno when he'll be back... Phoned again at 9pm, he stll wasn't back... Phoned again at 10pm, his little sister answered... She said he was busy and will phone me later... Phoned again at 10:30pm... One of his relatives answered... Can you believe he was asleep???  Honestly, I don't know why I should regard him as a friend anymore... He said he can help me and yet this is how he treats me? Grrrr....

      Sleep. That's it, place your forehead on the keyboard and close your eyes. Open them 8 hours later and tell me how you feel. No, aside from the silly key-prints on your forehead, how do you feel? Refreshed? Ah... that's correct...  Last Thursday was a total hell for me, the whole scene from my prespective looks like I keep "blacking out" every 10 minutes, except that the "blacking out" was actually me falling asleep at my desk, head bent down like a fisherman waiting for a fish to eat the bait.  I am totally skilled at this, nobody has caught me red-handed, at least for now... I'd be semi-alert all the time and had actually answered the teachers' questions 2 times on that day, despite me being in dreamland 7 seconds ago.  The whole damn episode started the day before. What? I can't believe that I had actually accepted to do my friend's homework. That was totally stupid of me. Started: 12:00 am. Finished: 2:00 am. Woke up: 7:00 am. Arngh...  The Blue House had the weekly practise on 8 am... 8 am??? Which freaking idiot set the time? I had wanted to study in the afternoon because I wanted to sleep late! What? Surat amaran (Warning letter)? Fail Disiplin (Discipline File)? WTF? Wait, that was the sleep-deprived side of me ranting. Sorry about that.  I was nearly running on empty, both in sleep and in food at that time. Time to refuel at 10 am. Went to the table outside the teacher's room, folded arms placed on table, sleep.  ZZZZzzzzzZZZZZzzzz..... Wha...? 12:30 pm... Crap... Time for class...  The whole day basically was me "blacking out" every 10 minutes, right until 6:30pm. The whole day in class was a total blur. I didn't learn anything on that day.  I was better off at home revising.

      Here I am, posting my first entry in my own blog. I've said this to Mellisa aka Glass Charm on ICQ before, I'm slow to respond to the blogging craze, actually about 1 year late. I've seen Live Journals before. Diary? Diary??? Oh dear god...  I'm sort of active on the internet, you can see me mostly on the  urlLink PPT forums  and  urlLink SPI forums . I have an alter ego which I will talk about sometime later...  BookCrossing? Yep, that's what I'm going to talk about for now. Ever heard about it before? If you haven't, I suggest hopping over to  urlLink BookCrossing.com  and check out the site.   urlLink This  is the article that appeared in the daily newspaper The Star on August 20, 2002.  From the main page:    The "3 Rs" of BookCrossing...       Read    a good book (you already know how to do that)     Register    it  urlLink here  (along with your journal comments), get a unique BCID ( B ook C rossing  ID  number), and  urlLink label the book       Release    it for someone else to read (give it to a friend, leave it on a park bench, donate it to charity, "forget" it in a coffee shop, etc.), and get notified by email each time someone comes here and records journal entries for that book. And if you make  urlLink Release Notes  on the book, others can  urlLink Go Hunting  for it and try to find it!

      A newspaper ran a competition asking for a rhyme with the most romantic first line... but the least romantic second line.  Here are some of the entries they received: ---------------------------------------------  I thought that I could love no other Until, that is, I met your brother.  Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you. But the roses are wilting, the violets are dead, the sugar bowl's empty and so is your head.  Of loving beauty you float with grace If only you could hide your face  Kind, intelligent, loving and hot; This describes everything you are not  I want to feel your sweet embrace But don't take that paper bag off of your face  I love your smile, your face, and your eyes - Damn, I'm good at telling lies!  My darling, my lover, my beautiful wife: Marrying you screwed up my life  I see your face when I am dreaming. That's why I always wake up screaming  My love, you take my breath away. What have you stepped in to smell this way  My feelings for you no words can tell, Except for maybe "go to hell"  What inspired this amorous rhyme? Two parts vodka, one part lime

      I'm almost at the end of the annual MSSPP chess tournament. Students from Primary, Secondary and even International schools participated in the tournament... It was pretty amazing seeing Malay, Chinese, Indians and Caucasians playing chess under one roof...  For the individual section, I had scored 5 points out of 8 games, placing me at 20th place in the under-18 tournament... W00t! It was the first time that I had got that high! Whoa... I'm feeling dizzy from the height...    25th to 27th January 2004   I had beaten 2 Penang Free School fellas which were actually in Form One during my first and third matches but lost to a senior one on the same day.... On the second day, I had beaten a Methodist Boys' School player in the sixth match and a SMJK Jit Sin player in the fifth match but lost to a SMK Hamid Khan player... On the third and last day, I had a very though match against a Chung Ling high School player... luckily and without me realising it, I won his queen and checkmated him in no time! After winning three matches in a row, it was no surprise that I lost to a player who was much better than me... The last match was against Micheal Koh from St. Xavier's Institute... We played evenly in the beginning but I didn't saw the fork coming as he captured my rook for a knight... Big disadvantage...  T_T  My dad said that I had actually given him quite of a fight before going down... But hey, that's a consolation... It wasn't much shame losing to an older opponent...    2nd and 3rd March 2004   The team tournament begins... In the first round, our school, which is SMJK Heng Ee or Heng Ee high School had managed to pull off a 2-2 draw with St. Xavier's Institute... They didn't field their best player, who was Micheal Koh and they almost lost... I could've won that match and we would've won... arngh... Anyway, we went on to crush SMK Hutchings 4-0 but slumped to a 0.5-3.5 loss to SMK Hamid Khan... I say we could have won an extra half point if it wasn't for my my bumbling teammate...  Second day, which is today... We started the day with a 2-0 lead against SMJK Chung Ling Butterworth but lost the lead as they won the 2 matches in the third and fourth board... Later in the day, after a little delay by 45 minutes, the 5th round started with us playing agaisnt Methodist Boys' School... My teammate playing on the second coard had actually won his match! Can you believe that my opponent had actually given me a free piece? And he goes "aw ****"... but I couldn't convert the extra piece to my advantage as we played to a draw... It was now up to my 2 other teammates... It all depend on them... I tell you, my bumbling teammate had rejected his opponent's offer for a draw... I couldn't believe it... -_-;; He later went on to lose his queen and the match... sigh... But then we rebounded and pounced Chung Ling Private High School 4-0, with the game on the 4th board lasting nearly 2 hours... The arbiter asked my chess teacher who was watching the game if his student wanted to win the match or torture him... hehehe...  And when it was time to go back, the teacher took a wrong turn and led us in one big circle in order to get back... hehehe...  Tomorrow would be the last day of the tounament... The top few lucky winners get to represent the state, which is Penang in the MSSM which will be held in Labuan...  [UPDATE]: We lost 4-0 to Chung Ling Penang :(

      First phobia: Bugs... i'm cool when it comes to one or two of them... But a giant swarm of them? Brrrr... *shudders* I have a book titled The Hidden Powers of Animals: Uncovering the Secrets of Nature by cryptozoologist Dr. Karl P. N. Shuker... It's a pretty cool book about animals and I really enjoyed it but there's 2 pages which is full of ladybugs... in colour... 2 full pages of ladybugs... It's creepy I tell you... They seem so real that I wouldn't be surprised if they crawled out of my book. I have to check that I don't accidentally flip to that 2 pages and give myself a rude shock...  Another phobia is about ceiling fans... I get uneasy when I sit under one... The rotating blades seem almost malicious as they rotate at 3 rotations per second and anybody sitting under one could almost lose their head if the fan drops from the ceiling and chops off the head... yeah, that's what I'm scared of... When the cover at the base of the ceiling fan in my house became loose, I was so scared that it would come crashing down on me if I was under it... Well, the repairman assured us that the fan couldn't fall down because it was hooked to the ceiling, and not at the base...  Sounds silly right? Well, that's what  urlLink phobias  are...

      I just founded out that the school's annual essay writing competition is going to be held next Tuesday, which is on 20th April...  Wish me luck... :)  After some ranting, life seems to be brighter after I scored a 37 out of 50 in the English oral exams, and my accountings teacher had smiled at me when I walked up to her and passed up my homework... God, I think this is the first time a teacher who I hadn't know well had smiled at me! Wow...  Even better news now, I passed by the school's chess club's notice board and saw that they had a new list of committee members for the year 2004 even before I knew about it! I also noticed that I was promoted from assistant secreatary to assistant chairman... w00t! Despite all of that power, I dread the responsibilities attatched... I mean, after all of that touble I had to go to when I was just an assistant secretary, assistant chairman is going to get even worse... *gulps*

      Well, not exactly dead... just left the chess club...  I just couldn't stand her telling me to arrive at this time and that time sharp... It's one of my pet peeves, people forcing me to do what I dislike... What I prefer is to let myself decide on things and if it doesn't come out right, I'll just blame myself. Sounds fair, right?  Another thing which I hate is the inability to be flexible... Dude, if you make the rule, you can break the rule. There's no disadvantage in being flexible, unless you have a strict routine and can be expected to go nuts at the first sign of disorder... And she does a sloppy work marking our exercise book, I bet she did it with both eyes closed... I mean, my graph was in an "n" shape but it should've been a "u" shape but I was not given time to correct it since she said that once she leaves the door, the book would be counted as being passed late and one mark out of the twenty available in our kerja kursus (coursework) marks are deducted... Take your strict routine and stuff it, asshole.

      Things have gone wrong for some of the people in the communities, one being Bookcrossing and the other being the Lofty-Bearing one... Damn it, can't we just get along? Suspicions were being aroused about the motives of the free book being offered by the Bookcrossing site, which is  urlLink Wild Animus ... Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with it... the only people who stirred up the controversy were just 3 particularly loud people, with them being unable to leave it aside and bashing the book and the author and even the publisher! I just don't understand... And this suggestion about "bookburning" and "virtual bookburning"??? When I saw the thread, I keep noticing that the ones on the anti-book side missing the pro-book side and vice-versa... WTF? Good thing there was Ron (screenname Reno), who was the founder of the site, stepped in to cool down the heated atmosphere... He said he was disappointed with the people there, I can understand him...  People are hard to understand... :|   See Black-Panther's blog for the other issue...

      I had tried to type this out a few days ago but it stalled and I was unable to finish it... So here is it again...  (Please forgive me if there's anything that doesn't seem right... my memory's currently a bit rusty...)  Some of you may have read from some of the local dalies about a teacher from Penang who was murdered recently... He was Mr. Pong and I certainly can say that he's one heck of a teacher and I'll never forget him...    I first met Mr. Pong when I was studying in class Form 2A (during 2002), which was the only Form 2 class in the morning session at that time... He usually wore branded clothes and because of that had an air of elegance around him... The most noticably was the smell of his cologne... He had that same cologne for the whole year... Everytime I caught a whiff of it reminded me that he was somewhere near me and possibly looking over my shoulder...   He would always tell us to bring a dictionary to class during each and every session of his English class... I tried bending the rules and brought a tiny thesaurus instead... hehe... And when someone forgot to do it, he'd order the student to copy "I must bring my dictionary to school every day" 100 times on a piece of paper... He'd then jot down the name of the student and the class that the student studies in a Reader's Digest organiser... It was the same routine for almost every punishment, whether it was forgetting to bring homework or not completing a homework, it was always 100 lines... He'd always counted the number of words and tried to make the sentence longer for the punishment...  Despite him being strict, he also encouraged us to strive ahead in learning English... He said that English wasn't a hard subject and if we'd put some effort in learning it, we couldn't fail... Every lesson was a fun for the class, well, actually it depends on his mood, which is usually good... hehe... He broke away from the normal teaching technique and implemented some of his own original ideas just so brighten up the class and make English easier to learn...  During some of our chats, I talked to him about Reader's Digest and books... Sadly, I never asked him about his cologne and I'm not so sure if I got another chance to get a whiff of it again... Some of my friends who have been in his class have said that his cologne is waaaay too "heavy"... I don't think so... it's another good way to keep some of the drowsy-during-morning students in class alert with some strong scents I say... He said that he bought a stack of novels for the school holidays but was unable to finish it... He aslo asked me about some of the author's books that I read, but I don't remember asking him about his choice... or was it just me...?  In class, he always accused the snotty-looking Lee Way-Joe (who is another student good in English) in the same class of acting "L-C-L-Y" or "Lan See Lan Yong" which is in Cantonese for being an "act-shot"... (I've heard that this student had moved to the US) When he entered class, he said once that this student didn't stand up when greeting... He was pissed because he was a stickler for good manners... hehe... After one of his rantings at class one time, he said this: "I am what I am, and you cannot change me..." And we never tried to make him pissed off anymore... except for the same student at the back of the class...  After the school's annual English composition at the Secondary 2 levels competition results had announced, he took a look at my paper and said that I deserved to get the first place instead of the "L-C-L-Y" kid... He said he don't know why would the other judges think otherwise... You know, when I was in class for the whole year, I honestly can say that he had raised the bar for the whole class in English... When he instrusted us to write essays, it wasn't about some children's bedtime stories, but instead it was on topics on current issues, like about road safety and how we should minimise accidents and stuff like that... It was a refreshing change since I was free in writing anything under the sun,and because of it, he'd give me higher marks than the rest of the class... I was thrilled when he gave a good comment to the class since I know that you couldn't force him to do or say anything he doesn't want to do or say...  During the whole 2002 under his wings, my English language skills had improved tremendously... I had deeply regretted for not trying my best to enter the top 3 classes in Form 3 and couldn't get to be in his class for 2003... But nevertheless, I had attended his tuition classes to boost my English and it has certainly paid off well...  I last saw him a few weeks ago... I think it was the week after the exams had ended... He was tutoring English to a group of students and I waved and called our "Sir!". He smiled back.  On April 7th, one day after his passing away was announced in The Star, there was one minute of silence during assembly in his honour.  Rest in peace, Mr. Pong.

      Uhh... As I'm typing this post at about 11pm, The last 7 hours in this day sucked.  Sigh...  Earlier in tha day, my pet flowerhorn fish jumped out of the bucket while I was cleaning the tank... Due to him flapping around on the floor, he had bled some blood (he's about 6 inches long and pretty big for a pet fish)... Partly in shock, since it's the first time he ever leaped out of anything since the time I bought him from the pet shop, and in concern, I had to wait until he stopped flipping and then only I could place him back into the tub... He bled a bit more in the tub but eventually the bleeding stopped in a short while and he was back to his normal aggresive and bubbly self...  Later, I went out with my mom to hunt for this book: http://bookcrossing.com/hunt/30/361/31958/171990  Total failure. We got into a taxi and searched the street... whoa... Lebuh Chulia was a darn long street and the place seemed to have an invisible shield around it... We got down at the end of the street and since we didn't want to waste the taxi fare, we went to the Chinese temple there to pray for health and luck... It was 6pm when we reached there and it started to rain! WTF? We had to wait 25 minutes until the rain became lighter... At 7pm, we walked back to Lebuh Chulia in the rain and then it dawned on me, I had lost my house keys! Oh my God... T_T Just at that moment, a man driving a trishaw and my mom called out for him... we made a big circle just to retrieve my keys at the temple since my mom was terrified of my safety if I had gone off alone... The rain beated heavily on the canvas of the trishaw and the wind blew hard and cold... To my surprise, the keys wasn't there and we had decided to go to Komtar, where the bus and taxi terminal was located... The trishaw took us to a junction and he went "uh uh uh uuuh"... He... was... a... mute... -_-;; and he had no idea where we wanted to go... My mom signaled to pull the trishaw beside Lebuh Chulia and since she took pity on him, she paid him RM10 for him effort... I had no objections about her decision though... We scouted the whole street and we couldn't find it!!! Arngh!!! The sky soon turned dark and we rested in a coffee shop for a short while and headed to Komtar... You know, from Lebuh Chulia to Komtar, we had walked over 2 kilometres to get there! And in the rain! Sigh... I knew I shouldn't have gone out today...

      Actually I'm going to Genting Highlands in Pahang in just less than 12 hours and I've haven't slept or packed my bags yet! Guess the procrastination bug really did bit me bad... XD  I'm going together with my mom, brother and sister's families, and I'm going to have fun! I don't think I could blog normally unless there's an internet cafe up there that offers cheap internet access. I've heard rumours that they charge up to RM20 per hour! Well, if it's true, expect the next few blog posts to be sent through cellphone e-mail... My poor fingers... XD

        Voyage 2 - The Essential World Beat Collection (EMI Recorded Music Asia Pacific + Warner Strategic Marketing | 2002)  Return To Innocence by Enigma (short version) ------------------------------- Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion  Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion   Don't be afraid to be weak Don't be too proud to be strong Just look into your heart my friend That will be the return to yourself The return to innocence   If you want, then start to laugh If you must, then start to cry Be yourself, don't hide Just believe in destiny  Don't care what people say Just follow your own way Don't give up and lose the chance To return to innocence  That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence -------------------------------  I remember when I was about 11 or 12 years old, I felt this strange sensation when I heard this song on a Singapore TV station. Maybe it was from a commercial, a movie or the video clip but I can't be sure where I heard it from. What I'm sure is that I was so spiritually relaxed and calmed that it left an imprint in my mind until today.  I played it on the VCD player for the umpteenth time in the row and I had finally realized the meaning of the song after a quick google, it made me realized that I  knew  there was something special about the song even though I was too young to comprehend the vague lyrics, it was somehow connected to my view on my life!  One of the video clips that was included when Enigma's DVD video clip collection was released in January 2004 is Return To Innocence. One of the reviews mentioned that the story of Return To Innocence was about a man's life in reverse compacted into a 4 minute clip. It starts off with him being old and he gets younger towards the end of the clip. Now, if the song made me think so hard, the video clip would even boggle my mind... Now I really want to watch the clip. NOW. Eheheh... too bad there's none available for download except for those in peer-to-peer programs like Kazaa and eMule, which I detest using.  Call me crazy but I believe in reincarnation, life after life. We get to live one lifetime as a human but some simply squander it away. There's so many things I've yet to experienced in the world, so many places to go to, so many things to do, so many things to learn. I've not only experienced happiness but pain, sadness and grief. Instead of them being an obstacle, I've felt that I've been motivated and determined to life my life to the max. Life is wonderful, treasure it.  I still remember that Mr. Pong once told us that one of his favourite songs is Lucky by Britney Spears. I don't know if anybody else had heard of the song before but I sure have. Mr Pong, I dedicate this song to you. Your murderers have been caught by the police and may you rest in peace.  Lucky by Britney Spears ------------------------------- This is a story about a girl named Lucky...  Early morning, she wakes up Knock, knock, knock on the door It's time for makeup, perfect smile It's you they're waiting for They go... "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"  CHORUS And they say... She's so lucky, she's a star But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking If there's nothing missing in my life Then why do these tears come at night?  Lost in an image (image), in a dream But there's no one there to wake her up And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning,  But tell me what happens when it stops? They go... "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"  CHORUS  "Best actress, and the winner is...Lucky!" "I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky!" "Oh, my God...here she comes!"  Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl? She is so lucky, but why does she cry? If there is nothing missing in her life Why do tears come at night?  CHORUS-repeat -------------------------------

I decided to post the lyrics to this song here, since it's hard to find sites with lyrics to this song...  From what I gathered, this song starts off with Hindi but the most of the rest are in Punjabi. It's about the grief of a daughter who's getting married and it's an old Punjabi folk song. The music is amazing, it sounds more like a "remix" song when the tunes are actually originally created by Karunesh. Karunesh (meaning "compassion" in Sanskrit) is a German man originally named  urlLink Bruno Reuter . You've got to hear it for yourself...

      And I thought I was doing my fish a favour, but the greedy fella ruined it all for me... It turns out he's a rock-eater. He bit the rocks that I bought on Wednesday to improve his surroundings and tried to chew it! XD Now I wonder what else I could do with a bag of white rocks worth 50 sen, hm...  Before the history paper was about to start on Thursday morning, some of the guys were shouting "si ka zhua!", which literally means "four-legged-snake" or lizard in Hokkien. I thought they were fooling around and ignored them. It wasn't until the guy sitting beside me pointed to the bottom of my chair that I noticed something was wrong. I looked around and couldn't see anything! So imagine the surprise I got when a 3-inch orangy-brown lizard jumped onto my left leg and hugged it! XD So I shook it and the lizard fell on the floor unhurt. I waved my hand in front of the lizard to shoo him away but it wasn't working, instead he climbed onto the leg of my chair and looked about to hop into my bag! He later came down and I accidentally scared him by shifting my foot. Although he ran, and he did ran  fast , he ran in the wrong direction and now was heading towards the girls at the back of the class!  I sat there at the front of the class, observing the girls and guys freak out at the lizard while the teacher stood stupidly at one corner of the classroom. Fearing that he could get squished by a stupid student, and that the paper was about to start in the next 5 minutes, I walked to the back coolly and calmly and scooped the lizard up! It seemed that he was not going down without a fight and wriggled out from my hands and onto another student's desk! Shrieks were heard from the students as I managed to transpot him from the desk to the balcony outside the classroom. I think everybody sighed with relief after that... XD  The immature kid said to me that I had got my hands dirty with germs and bacteria but I shrugged him off more than I had shrugged the lizard when he hugged my legs... heh... The words also came from the same immature twat who suggested him and me lure a pair of baby birds out from their nest in the ceiling of the classroom with a bait. He then told me to catch the birds before they hit the ground and go "splat". I got fumed and flamed him in Hokkien with a dash of insults. XD  After the paper was over, I tried to search for the lizard, maybe thinking about keeping him as a pet but he was already gone... Oh well, another creature encountered. :)

      I just got up from a disturbing dream this morning. After I woke up, I wept. I can't remember the last time I cried that hard...  The dream places me in my own house, my parents are at the dining room talking and chatting, my aunt stopped by for a visit and was in the living room and I was in one of the bedrooms... Normally the walls of this room are blank, save the few hooks used to hang up clothes, in my dreams, the wall was lined up with some potted plants, behind the cupboard and up to the other side of the room. I was standing beside the cupboard when a cat jumped up onto it and proceeded to jump into the crack between the wall and the cupboard. The cat went in with a "thud" sound. I was shocked! I quickly pulled back the cupboard and found the cat bleeding profusely. He had hit himself on a plant with thorns. I brought him to the living room to find something to stop the blood but the only item I could find was a roll of toilet paper. I was getting worried as my hands were quickly filled with blood. I checked to see if he was alive but found a small hole in his head. He was dead already.  I screamed and cried, shouting "why???" from the top of my lungs, if only I had stopped him, he'd still be alive. It was then I woke up feeling very sad, but also with a tinge of relief that it was only a dream...

      I was at the Internet Movie Database site to check out some info about TV show and movies until I had found this comment on NBC's  urlLink World's Most Amazing Videos . I was feeling sort of "oh wow, I can't believe that I agree with that guy so much!". It was then I realised that  I  was the person to write that comment one and a half years ago! Oh man... I was so different back then. So immature, so naive. XD

      It's 2:25am as I type the entry, my stomach is more towards hungry than full. I'm sleepy but I want to be connected to the internet! I don't feel like playing much on Neopets at the moment but I sure am interested in surfing more of the internet...  After being plagued by a bad thumping headache yesterday that left me so lethargic that I couldn't lift my school bag. Oh yeah, and then there was this thumping headache... So anyway, yesterday was the third, yes you didn't hear it wrongly, third day that I was absent from school since the start of school in the year of 2004. Now this could be considered an accomplishment for me as I had been absent from school for a total of 30 days during last year. Don't blame the internet for that problem as the problem actually lies in sleepy old me, who couldn't be bothered to wake up at 6:30am to obtain knowledge.  @_@"  Steering back on topic, I felt pretty lucky to not step out from my house at that time of the day, as there was a double funeral at the ground floor of my apartment block. One of the decesed was my grand-aunt, who passed away on Tuesday and cremated yesterday. And what surprising is that there was another fella who passed away a few days earlier and yet both of the coffins departed on the same day. My mom would call it vey unauspicious as funerals are very "yin" (yin and yang, geddit?) and could disrupt the "chi" of a person, therefore causing him or her to fall sick, or even in some serious cases, death through a spirit hooking onto and harassing the unlucky person. I prefer to believe that once a person is dead, he or she is d-e-d dead, I'm not that superstitious as my mom.  @_@"  Back on topic again, I felt tired and lifeless and this awful headache throughout the whole day. I wasn't until this morning that everything became fine, or so I was led to believe. I had doubts about whether the damn headache will strike again in school. Luckily the worst was not meant to happen today, as I went through the whole day at school without any problems. ^_^ I even managed to run full speed for a whopping half lap! XD

      Yesterday was Mother's Day, and in newspaper The Star, there was a comic especially for Mother's Day. This comic by Reggie Lee shows a mother cat carrying her kitten accross a busy highway, with cars and trucks blazing and the kitten saying "I ♥ you, Mom"... In my opinion, that was the most touching pic I had even saw in my whole life... To this animal lover, a pic of this cat touches me more than any pic of a human... I salute to you, Mom, and other Moms in this world, including animals... I'll post a pic of it when it appears online...

First, I got a chance to try out gmail before the public, and now, they've revamped and relaunched blogger, I love the new look! I've had doubts about LiveJournal, since it really isn't for me... To be honest, the only reason I own a LiveJournal acount is just to read my friends' blogs... >.>

      I'm dreading tomorrow... My Accountings and Economics Basics teachers will be replaced, Accountings by another experienced teacher and Economics Basics by a probation(?) teacher. Sad part is that the change for Accountings may be permanent, good part is that Economics Basics teacher will be back teaching us again on October the 8th... =(  I seriously hope that none of them are stuck ups...  On another note, it rained heavily today and the droplets flew into the classroom... It was darn fun! XD It rained throughout the whole day, and to make matters even freezing, some students were shooting water from the taps at each other in the toilet. With the additional water on the floor, instead of being slippery, it instead soaked up the water from the floor and left my feet a bit sore from the wet shoes... =|

      If you ask me, my top choice would be  urlLink Gmails.co.uk  (aka GoogleGmails). So, if you have any questions about Gmails or would like to discuss about it, Gmails.co.uk is a good place to do so...  On the other hand, although GmailForums are currently the biggest Gmails forum around. The admins there are very strict about the promotion aspect and they remove unauthorised links in threads. My guess would be that they're terrified that they'll lose their members... Hmph... The admins there rejected my request for authorisation to insert a link to Gmails.co.uk in my signature! The reason was that they didn't want a forum with a similar topic to be promoted in their forums. WTF?  Imho, a signature on forums is for signing out of a post, a spot for some creativity, or even a little piece of real estate on the internet for the owner to do whatever the hell he/she likes as long as it doesn't violates the Terms and Conditions of the forum (set by the creators of Invision forum, not the admins). It's personal space that's visible to the public. Everybody can see it but yet nobody should touch it. Despite the reject notice, I said "screw them all" and put the link in it. I also posted a topic that questioned the authorisation of promotions in GmailForums. 12 views, no replies yet, waiting for it to be deleted and me get banned from the forum)  Here's the  urlLink screenshot ,  I'm getting more and more guilty about my post actually... Hm...  [Edit]: Yeh, the overwhelming guilt has made me edit it and replace my piece of flame bait with an apology. Well, luckily for me, he accepted it... I feel stupid for doing it in the first place... >_

      [Warning, this post contains profanity 'cause I'm pissed off right now]   urlLink Article  from Voice of America  >"The South Korean government is vowing not to be intimidated by such terror tactics and will standby plans to send additional troops to help rebuild the war-torn country."  This is the typical government blindly following Goddammed George W. Fucking Bush. The South Korean government and those following their footsteps aren't considered heroes by remaining defiant, they're being an asshole for letting their own citizens killed for  absolutely nothing . Sometimes it's better to give and take, even with terrosists as long as nobody gets hurt.  >"South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun told his nation Wednesday he is heartsick and wrenched with grief over the beheading of translator Kim Sun-il."  That is a blatant, out and out 100% lie being told. The President wouldn't be "heartsick and wrenched" if he decided to pull out the troops in the first place. And oh yeah, and I'm guessing he's pouring out tears in buckets, grieving and bawling with sorrow in his office.  >"Mr. Roh says the execution of the 33-year-old South Korean worker is an act against humanity. He vowed not to let terrorism stop South Korea's dispatch of an additional 3,000 troops to join some 600 already there to help rebuild Iraq."  The Goddammed President's decision to let an innocent civilian get killed is clearly against humanity!  >"U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has praised the South Korean president for his refusal to allow the murder to alter the troop dispatch."  I now have absolutely no doubts that Colin Powell, together with George W. Bush, is pure evil. Praised??? Which sane human being would praise another person for murdering?  >"Asian nations also condemned the beheading of translator Kim Sun-il."  Don't condemn the beheading, condemn the President for God's sake! It's clearly his damn fault!  It's obviously clear in hostage situations that the government has the choice to comply with with the hostage takers' requests. It's their ego that stops them and it's their ego that causes an innocent man's life.  Impeach the bastard again!  I have never publicly expressed my opinions on the Goddammed "war on terrorism" before, and this news article has just pushed me over the edge. To be honest, I can never look at George W. Bush's face the same way again. I'm unable to laugh at the stupidities and tasteless jokes on David Letterman. Each and every time I see his face, I see a mass murderer as the President of the United States. I see him responsible for the estimated 3,000 Iraqi civilians killed in Iraq just because his Daddy can't topple Saddam by himself. I see his responsible for deaths of the 951 coalition soldiers in Iraq. I see him respnsible for each and every person killed or injured as a result of the conflict in Iraq!  The recent hostage executions have shown that the governments who wanted to suck up to George W. Bush are dragging themselves into shit-holes. People who were trying to help the Iraqi were treated as trespassers and they sure have proved that trespassers will be prosecuted and executed regardless of their agenda in Iraq. So what the fuck are those who say they "wanted to help" getting in return? It's times like this the idea of thinking for ourselves first before others might actually be a good idea. If the Iraqis don't want them to be there, then don't go! What's so hard to understand?  The whole war in Iraq situation is just as though if somebody barged into your own house, killed your family members, threw out the furniture, renovated the whole house, and then say it's for your own good. WTF?  I condemn this vile and evil person, and I condemn those who sucks up to his ass.

      ...or die!  That's what it says in some of the e-mails I received from my fellow "friends". Well, it isn't exactly like that, more like "if you don't pass this on to   X   number of your friends in   X   hours or days, you will die in a horrble accident / be forever lonely / have a ghost follow you for eternity  (delete where applicable) ."  I remember my first chain e-mail, it had something to do with a mushy story about friendship some roses, it looked pretty nice too... After I read it, I realised my situation, I don't know who to pass it on to! (I was a newbie to the internet at the time) Oh well, I'll just pick one or 2 of my friends... The next day, there was another one! Darn it. I had to do something about these e-mails. Then a lightbulb flashed above my head, it goes to the trash! From then onwards, every single one of them went into the trash, regardless of the concequences it said. Muahahahaha, I'm immune to chain e-mails.  Another notable incident was when my former classmate in 2003 sent me so many forwards and chain e-mails, most of with attatchments, that my Yahoo! account had to be shut down temporarily. Her address eventually went into my "block" list. Nevertheless, I think I haven't really got those gruesome ones yet, you know, with the decapitations, grostique deformities, bloody bodies and weird photoshopped ghosts. Luckily, I now have grown an "iron stomach" that'll make me resist the urge to vomit... Wait a minute, scratch that, it's more like I could shrug those photos aside. But I really take pity on those who actually got scared from it.  I got some forwards from one of my friends, I have to admit, not all of forwards are useless, some are about tips on self-protection and other advice. Just please not those silly trivia, nobody actually needs those. So the next time you receive a chain e-mail, please do something productive, do the opposite of what it tells you, trash it.

      One of the answers for a question in the Pendidikan Moral (Moral Studies) paper kept me thinking for a while...  The question is:    Soalan 2  Terdapat sesetengah remaja yang berselesih faham dengan keluarga and pihak sekolah masing-masing. b)Kebiasaannya perselisihan faham mungkin mencetuskan pergaduhan. Terangkan kesan pergaduhan terhadap: -diri sendiri -keluarga remaja -sekolah   Surpisingly the answer for that question is:    Akibat pergaduhan terhadap diri sendiri ialah berlaku kecederaan dan masa depan remaja itu terjejas. Kesan terhadap keluarga ialah nama keluarga tercemar dan ibu bapa dianggap tidak tahu mendidik anak. Kesan terhadap sekolah ialah imej sekolah terjejas dan ibu bapa tidak mahu menghantar anaknya ke sekolah tersebut.    Is image all that important nowadays? With all of the discipline problems reported in schools, is sweeping those cases under the carpet a good way to keep the school's image intact? Even in families in the middle east, there were reports of honour killings in the family in order to keep their family honour or image. Let's face it, people are people and problems are bound to appear one way or another. Image isn't the only problem. The problem is having trouble facing the problem.  [I scored the lowest marks for  soalan 2 , btw]

      More results were announced today and I now have shown improvements in 6 out of 10 subjects! So for now my total score would be 635 out of 1000, or an average of 63.5 compared with the 57.8 I got for the previous exam. The last page of the Maths paper was still missing and it was really very disappointing... Well, at least I got 12 marks added to it. I had to settle for 62. Darn.  Another disappointing result was English, I got 85 this time... but what's even worse was that the teacher doesn't seem suitable to teach English and I got 44 our of 50 for that section. Very disappointing. Up til now, I had only noticed 2 typos in it. Teacher's markings are in  red  and my opinions are in brackets. I could've write a better story but 2 hours isn't enough for me... o_O  The topic is  "write a story entitled 'The Stranger'" .         The story began  ^  one sunny afternoon when Mum received a phone call from the doctor at   the   Penang General Hospital. After hearing the news from the doctor, I saw   that   her facial expression changed dramatically. Instead of her   usually   cheerful self, she was now looking sad. It   turns   out that the doctor  ^  comfirmed  (first typo)   ^  our little sister, Tina  ,  had a small brain tumour and if it   isn't   removed soon, it   could cost her her life  . (Double "her" was indeed correct, according to some websites)         Mum and Dad were very worried. They   didn't   know how to get enough money for the operation, which   costs   a whopping RM10,000! I was worried for my little sister too, I   couldn't   bear the thought of a person that young  ^  undergoing an operation. When Tina herself heard about the news, she was surprisingly calm, and she accepted it. She was always the mature one, always thinking according to logic and not feelings.         Mum and Dad took out their saving and borrowed money from friends and relatives to raise funds for the operation. They even approached the offices of the local newspaper, The Star   to ask them for help   from their readers. The article appeared two days later, we had collected RM8,000 including our savings, loans and donations but we were RM2,000 short of the target. Hope was quickly slipping away as the deadline for the operation was approaching.         One early morning, we got up and opened the front door because somebody was ringing  the doorbell. But when we opened it, instead of a person, a small bag greeted us! As I picked up the bag, I caught a fleeting glimpse of a man running away. We were surprised that the   bad    (the other typo)  contained RM2,000 in RM100 notes! I noticed that there was also a note inside. I picked it up and read it. "I lost my son from a car accident two years ago. All the money I had   couldn't   save him. I missed him terribly and when I read about your plight, I figured that your family deserves to stay together. So please use this bag of money for the operation. Signed, The Stranger".          Mum broke down and wept tears of joy after hearing it. She hugged Tina and praised God that there are still good souls on Earth. I joined in and hugged both of them, as the mother-daughter hug quickly turned into a group hug.          Three days later, Tina was wheeled into the operating theatre and the doctors removed the tumour after a 7-hour operation. Everybody was waiting outside the operating theatre, including the aunts, uncles, Grandpa and Grandma. Some of us shouted with joy when the doctor told us that Tina's tumour was removed and her condition was currently stable. A few weeks after the operation, Tina was discharged from the hospital. We even received a get well card signed by The Stranger!          We are very grateful for what The Stranger did for us. We   would've   lose Tina if   it wasn't   for him. Every human's actions have impact on others. Although we never knew the identity of The Stranger, the family will always remember him and his kind deed.

      I was really nervous about my exam results after 2 weeks of school holidays. I'm not in a "story-teller" mood at the moment. So let's cut to the chase. Out of the 7 subjects' results that were announced today, I improved in 5 of them, including Additional Maths, Chinese and Moral Studies! I failed those 3 in the earlier exam but I got 61 for Chinese and 63 for Moral studies. I still flunked Additional Maths even though I got 10 marks more than the previous exam, which was 26 (sad isn't it?).  Accountings deteriorated by 7 marks but the stunner was Modern Maths, I don't know how it happened but the 2 last pages were not attached to the rest of the stack and the last page went missing! And just because it wasn't tied together with the rest, the teacher didn't include the marks for the seperate piece of paper. =( She later asked me to meet her tomorrow, hopefully to discuss adding it. I hope the other paper turns out somehow up at her desk because I did quite a few questions on it! I think the total of both papers would be 20 marks, it means a damn lot to me! I won't mind if I lose marks because of my stupidity, but I won't let it lose just because of a technicality!  [Note to self: practise more proper string-tying and bring along a stapler for the next exam.]

       urlLink    (104.4 FM Penang)   You Gotta Be  by  Des'Ree  ------------------------------------------------- Listen as your day unfolds Challenge what the future holds Try and keep your head up to the sky Lovers, they may cause you tears Go ahead release your fears Stand up and be counted Don't be ashamed to cry  (Chorus) You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold You gotta be wiser, you gotta be hard You gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm You gotta stay together All I know, all I know, love will save the day  Herald what your mother said Read the books your father read Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time Some may have more cash than you Others take a different view My oh my, hey hey  (Repeat chorus)  Don't ask no questions, it goes on without you Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace The world keeps on spinning You can't stop it, if you try to This time it's danger staring you in the face Oh oh  Remember  Listen as your day unfolds Challenge what the future holds Try and keep your head up to the sky Lovers, they may cause you tears Go ahead release your fears  My oh my, hey hey  (Repeat chorus) Yeah yeah yeah  (Repeat chorus) Yeah yeah  Got to be bold Got to be bad Got to be wise No one ever said  Got to be hard Not too too hard All I know is I never saved the day  (Repeat chorus)  You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold You gotta be wiser, you gotta be hard You gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm You gotta stay together -------------------------------------------------  After the meal, we went walking around the First World Plaza. Shopping heavily wasn't a good idea since prices tend to be higher than normal. Bright and colourful indoor rides, including the indoor rollercoaster, the Euro Express thundered overhead and left a trail of screaming patrons. We walked about, went into some shops to take a look, took a photo of the Eiffel Tower of Genting and other interesting stuff, and bought some popcorn for a light snack. We then went back to our rooms but on the way there, my mom slipped and fell on the floor! Owch... Bro-in-law, sis, the maid and me rushed to help her up. It turns out that her shoe wasn't suitable for the surface and I noticed there were little spots of water on the floor.  The maid and I helped my mom up, carrying her on each arm and we slowly walked down the steps (ramp would be more accurate) and we slowly walked back to our rooms. I found the water dispenser, which was the  only  thing that's free in the whole damn place while the maid helped my mom to rub some ointment on the sore parts. We pulled the top part of the second bed onto the floor and pushed some pieces of furniture and went to sleep.  Photos took on the first day:    The Venice ride and a section of the Euro Express track.    The wall!    The Eiffel Tower of Genting, mom is in the foreground.

      Here's 2 simple ways to get a nice cup of Mocha without burning a hole in your wallet at Starbucks...   Option #1  1. Take a packet of Milo 3-in-1 and a packet of Nescafe 3-in-1. 2. Empty both packet into cup and pour hot water. 3. Stir well and enjoy.   Option #2  1. Pour 2 tablespoons of Milo and one teaspoon of Nescafe coffee powder into cup. 2. Add creamer and sugar or just add a teaspoon of condensed milk. 3. Pour hot water, stir well and enjoy.  Credit goes to my youngest grand-aunt, who passed away 2 years ago, for introduding me to the wonderful world of mocha and coffee when I was a little kid! =)

      ...and into the fire! I just started reading   urlLink Sons of Heaven : A Novel   by Terrence Cheng mere hours after finishing and releasing   urlLink Vietnam Ground Zero - Soldier's Medal   by Eric Helm. I had wanted to release the latter when I was it Genting but I found out that I couldn't finish it in time.  Sons of Heaven : A Novel  is well, a novel! Actually the book's plot, which is part truth and part fiction, revolves around the Tiananmen Incident in Beijing during June 1989. I seriously hope that it's not as gruesome as the one about the Vietnam War.  Don't know why but I'm interested in studying about communism lately, perhaps it's because of the idea of the government, being led by a leader with usually an iron fist, leading the peasant people. Countries like the Soviet Union, North Korea and China fascinate me. Not that I'd like to live there, but just to study the concept of communism, where  everything  is supposed to be for the sake of the people but instead, the people are being rounded up and led like flocks of sheep following the shepard (government).  The other book I bought was   urlLink Ole Doc Methuselah  , by L. Ron Hubbard. Although the jacket is worn out, the hard cover is still perfectly fine. I noticed some omnibus novels (2 novels in one book) being sold at only RM19.90, and they have a 20% discount if you buy 2! Sigh, all these John Grisham and Jeffery Archer novels look tempting but my budget is very tight at the moment, so I had to settle with 2 outdated novels for a price of slightly more than RM10.

      According to the newest info on  urlLink Blogger Knowledge , a Blogger service called  urlLink Audioblogger  has been launched a few days ago and even though it seems cool, if I use it my phone bill is going to get heavier since Audioblogger's number is only for those in the US only. Anywhere else would be long-distance.  Anyway, I just listened to an audioblog by Biz Stone. But as cool as it seems, in my opinion, it isn't going to work out. "Oh look, at the sky! It's a bird! No, it's a plane! No, it's AUDIOBLOGGER!!!" (Okay, I'm tempted to use Audioblogger to blog that sentence... XD) I short, I hate hearing my voice coming out of speakers. Sometimes the speaker gods are cruel are I get sentenced to have my normal voice being garbled up and spat out like I've been possessed by the evil that lurks in the darkest parts of the internet.  Audioblogger also compromises the last pinch of personal privacy left on the internet - your voice. After having your thoughts, ideas, hopes and other stuff in your brain laid out neatly and nicely on your blog, the pictures you sometime share with other communities, you now have the option to have your voice being "sissified" and spread throughout the 4 corners of the internet. I think the only reason I'm rambling about Audioblogger is because I hate hearing recordings of my voice. I hope that's clear. >_

      ...for those people who regularly post mail from one place to another. It's even worse for Bookcrossers who send  books  from one place to another!  urlLink This  article reports about a postman who slacks off and dumps letters in a cemetery! I wouldn't be comfortable handling mail that slept with the dead overnight. Another dent in "reliable" Pos Malaysia's armour...  Goes to show that there's one born every minute.

      Actually I'm not talking about my mom, but my sister (half-sister to be exact). The event was held at Gurney Plaza on May 20, 2004 and scans of the newspaper article is available  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . I couldn't get the 2 parts to merge and instead screwed it up, heheh... My sister is Angie and wearing the pink top and pink shorts, sadly she didn't win any prize! I suspect something fishy with the organisers... And because of that, I'll let you judge. Here are some of the photos I took at the event!  I know it's not very clear, sorry lah, cheap camera...     urlLink The contestants strut their stuff with sport wear.    urlLink Again in sport wear.    urlLink (Clockwise from top left) The contestants line up, sis prepares, she walks to the microphone, she then delivers her short introduction speech.    urlLink Top 2 pics - My sis and her twins, kids of other contestants.    urlLink Participants line up again for the next round, the evening gown.    urlLink (Clockwise from top left) The participants eagerly wait for the results to be announced, second runner-up, first runner-up, the winner prepares to be seated.    urlLink The faces of the winners!     After that, a Bernama reporter and a cameraman interviewed the winner while me, mom, sis and second sis went back after dinner at the food court there. I heard from my mom that she cried for 2 days after she went home. She cried even harder after seeing that the story and photos were published in almost every Chinese daily in Penang! I knew she was unfairly judged but what to do? What could anybody do?  On another note, I released the book  urlLink A Child Called "It": One Child's Courage to Survive  in the flyer rack on the information counter facing the stage.

       urlLink    (104.4 FM Penang)  Fire  by  Babyface feat Des'ree   --------------------------------- You're riding in my car I turn on the radio I'm pulling you closer But you keep tellin' me no You say you don't like it But I know you're a liar 'Cause when we kiss Ooh...

Fire  When we kiss I'm on fire Your tenderness Gives me desire I can't resist Your tender lips When we kiss Ooh...  Fire  When we kiss I'm on fire Your tenderness Gives me desire I can't resist Your tender lips When we kiss Ooh...  Fire  Lyrics Copyright (c) 2004 Sony Music Entertainment (M) Sdn Bhd ---------------------------------  After a short nap in the car, I found myself somewhere in Hulu Selangor. I think this would be the first time in 3 years I had stepped out of Penang state land. Pretty long time, huh? Soon out of boredom, I noticed road markers incidating the listance left to Genting: 44 KMs left... sigh... Somewhere along the route, we passed by Gohtong Jaya, most probably named after the founder of Genting, Lim Goh Tong. One could imagine the effort and money invested in the building of this majestic structure in the middle of the mountains and the brilliance of the old fart. The construction in Genting has also led to the developement of housing estate, Gohtong Jaya.  The road became steeper and winding by the metre. Thank God nobody threw up on the way up. Mom closed her eyes to avoid looking at the road while the cute kid had his head put in the middle of the front seats and still smiling. We passed Ria Apartments and several Genting Hotels and we were approaching First World Hotel. We got off at the lobby and brought the bags together to the check-in counter. It was the first time since my brother's wedding I last saw my brother-in-law's nephew. He was a year younger and definately looking more stylish than me. The time was roughly 4pm while check-in time was 3pm. In short, we wasted an hour of our room time, I demand compensation! XD Okay, that was a lame joke...  So anyway after 30 minutes of waiting, we got our cards and headed towards our respective rooms. The 11°C written on the thermostats in the lobby reminded me how low the temperature was in Genting. I saw a flyer rack promoting Annie - The Musical and knew immediately that was my first choice to release a book! After an elevator ride to the 6th floor, we walked along the quiet corridors and pass the cleaners cleaning some of the rooms. When we got to rooms 6 616 and 6 617, it turns out that the cleaners haven't even cleaned it up yet! So much for the 3pm check-in, hmph... My brother, sister-in-law and their kid, Me and my mom were staying in room 6 616 while the rest slept in the other room. First thing we noticed about it was the view of the mountain side, woo it was cool!  Piles of rubbish thrown by the previous tenants were starting to collect at the window ledge. Those irresponsible people... Another thing we noticed was the doors that link to both rooms. It was almost sure that the 2 spoilt twats are going to give everybody a rousing wake-up each morning.  After we got all of the bags in the room and the kids got a chance to jump around on the mattress, it's off to the nearest restaurant! We took the escalator up to the 2nd floor and we stumbled upon a shopping complex in the same building! (Okay, it wasn't exactly "stumbled" but I didn't knew  that  much about Genting... XD ) The nearest restaurant in this case was the Hainan Kitchen. We were quickly seated at 2 different tables since the 10 of us couldn't fit in one table. I knew this was bad news, let's just say this was an instinct, heheh... Sister's family and maid was on the other table while I sat with brother's one.  4 plates of fried pork with sour sauce and rice, some bread arrived at the table. The pork was so tough I think it blunted the knives. The other table seemed to be very enjoying their meals. I suggested ordering the curry rice but the others wanted pork. Bad idea. Each plate costed RM10 and I felt really guilty to my brother-in-law, who was footing the bill if I didn't finish it. After all, rich people are known to be more stingier than less rich people and my bro-in-law doesn't waste food's still edible.  Desert came when we finished our meal and we got ice-cream! *Dances like a hyperactive kid on sugar* XD I think I'll skip the part where the incompetent waiters had forgotten about my ice-cream... >_

         urlLink Light & Easy , another local radio station. (104.4 FM in Penang)  Getaway Car by Hall & Oates  --------------------------------- Remembering when we first met We had that adventure in our eyes But something got away I guess In the everyday of our lives  And I don't know what keeps us here Let's disappear and start all over again  (Chorus) We can run away Baby come as you are You can look at my heart As your Getaway Car We can drive all night It will be alright Love can take us so far in my Getaway Car  All we need is the open road More fuel for the fire inside us Steer us onto lands unknown And we can leave this world behind us  And I don't know what keeps us here Let's disappear and start all over again  -Repeat Chorus- We can run away Baby come as you are You can look at my heart As your Getaway Car We can drive all night It will be alright Love can take us so far in my Getaway Car  Turn up the radio and don't look back again Let me put the pedal down, gonna leave this town Don't be afraid to ride  - Repeat Chorus - We can run away Baby come as you are You can look at my heart As your Getaway Car We can drive all night It will be alright Love can take us so far in my Getaway Car ---------------------------------  Mustn't... let... procrastination... hit... me... XD  I think I've expressed myself lately, I'm lazy. And that's why this blog will have a detailed report on my trip to Genting Highlands in many parts. So that means I'm gonna be  very  detailed. Photos would be ready by tomorrow I hope...  My summary of the trip would be this: Genting sucks, not too badly, but it still sucks.  Me and my mom crossed to the mainland through the ferry, me holding a plastic bag containing 3 books planned to release there, the latest issue of Reader's Digest, a plain notebook and a pen to jot down things in case I get inspiration. (Thanks Dei for the idea). We passed by the old bus burnt down bus terminal as we walked to the place where my brother fetched us. I'd hope  somebody  do  something  about it. Even though  the top part was burnt down, I believe that they could at least repair the bottom half and demolish the completely burnt top half. It's a waste seeing all of those space and shop lots rot away. It's pretty obvious that the Seberang Jaya part was less cared for compared to the island, seeing as each and every bus that entered the 1 year old "temporarily" bus terminal had their wheel suspension system tested by going through a 1 metre wide pothole... o_O So anyway, we were standing under the shoddily erected shack, an "ulck, ulck, ulck!" sound was coming from a cardboard box on the floor! Shortly after that, the box shifted a bit as something inside was trashing around. It seems that somebody wanted to transport a chicken along their trip! I was slightly amused by that thought... heheh...  So, after 30 minutes of waiting, a silver Kelisa pulled into the curb and we got in. My sister-in-law was sick from fever and flu. It was a bit nervous sitting in the same car and breathing the same air as her... *shivers* We were also greeted by my brother's kid with lots and lots of smiles. I swear he's one of the most cutest kids I have ever met! Sweet and bubbly, he's a stark contrast to my sister's twins, who are spoiled little twats... Hmph... We headed to me sister's family's house and set off together after a brief pit stop there.  The trip to there was a bit scary, as notions of mortality and morbid thoughts of accidents flashed though my mind. I was a little extra cautious and decided to bail out of the car if there was the first sign of something gone wrong. Luckily, that never happened and the worst part of the trip in that car was a bumped head, cramped left leg and numbed balls (no kidding). Me bro stopped at the Tapah (I think) rest stop for a toilet break and I changed seats with the sniffling sister-in-law in the front seat. You couldn't believe the relief I felt from my leg and balls... XD Picked up a small bag of pineapples and pomeloes for a light snack, and onwards to Genting!

Darn you url squatters!    If everything goes well, wittysquirrel.blogspot.com will redirect to the new address and I'll also be using a new template. But I'm wondering if this change is good, as my screenname just sounds real odd to other people, and I'm beginning to think that they're right... Hm...    Suggestions needed,    1. Should I change the title and url of the blog?  2. Should I use the new template at the new blog?    Help, anybody?

      I was watching David Letterman last night on NTV7 when I saw an commercial, some little bone-shaped biscuits and other stuff were being poured into a bowl. We then see the dog bowl from the top and it's seperated into 4 quarters of dog biscuits and milk. I immediately thought  "Must be another dog food ad, they're going to talk about the dog's diet or something" . It wasn't until the words  "Beamer needs food"  flashed on the screen did I realise we were looking at a BMW logo! The screen then fades to black with these words  "Helping the helpless is another luxury you can afford. Donate or adopt, you're in the driver's seat" . And it wasn't a commerical, it was actually a public service message brought by PAWS (PAWS Animal Welfare Shelter) and NTV7! Now that's an ad I appreciate!  As the show was nearing the end, there was another one showing 4 dog collars (interlocked?), imitating the Audi logo with the words  "Odie needs owner" . These creative folks have done a wonderful job in spreading awareness for  urlLink PAWS Malaysia  through the messages, kudos to them! =D Although there were no dogs used in both of the public service messages, the symbolism in using the bowl and collars still did it's job well!  And another thing, I'm beginning to have suspicions about subliminal advertising in a Toyota commercial. You see, there were several noticible blinks in the commercial for the Toyota Unser. Toyota is a filthy rich company, do you think that they'll accept using a commercial clip full of "blinking"? Although I don't see any words in the blinks, perhaps my brain isn't alert enough to read it, perhaps I'm going crazy...

      A dozen students in Form 1 and Form 2 in my school were punished after they were caught visiting internet cafes in the island. Some were even foolish enough to give in themselves! The punishment were all alike, 3 strokes of the rattan cane, except that some were caned in the teachers' office while some were caned publicly in the hall. Although I wasn't involved in this incident, it compelled me to blog about the jurisdiction of the school administration towards the students and where to draw the line.     First of all, I felt it was deeply unfair that the students were being punished even though a couple of them had permission from their parents to visit these internet cafes. The parents say yes but the school says no. The parents' decision on their children overrules the school's decision as technically as the decision makers in the child's life are the parents, not the school. The school doesn't have a right to overrule the parents' decision, as this is under the parents' control.     Secondly, the school doesn't have the right to prosecute students if they are outside school property, not skipping classes or not wearing uniforms. The crew cut #1 and #2 are not registered trademarks of SMJK Heng Ee (yes, I'm speaking out against my school), so the school cannot be held responsible just because the students who have crew cuts got themselves in trouble outside.     Thirdly, the school doesn't understand that a part of our lives have already been connected to the online community. Such is the closed mind. Couldn't it be possible that students might be researching information on the internet? What's wrong with playing games together with friends? It's not as if we're organising a triad group or distributing pornography, internet cafes are still legal in the country, you know...     With all of the encouragement and promotion of computers and IT knowledge everywhere, it's all going down the drain for this school. That's the way to go for regression! I for one am thankful that I do not have to rely on internet cafes for my online activities. As "right" as the school administration might be, it's technically wrong if they encroach over their jurisdiction. Our lives are runned by our parents, not the school. I'll gladly debate with the discipline teachers or headmaster over this if I have to.     I rest my case.     [Update, July 31]: You can also discuss about this at the  urlLink Velocity Media  forums. Will be penning the letter once I hear of more news about this...

       "You don't need to feed them much, just twice per day."      That's what the shopkeeper of the aquarium shop nearby said to my mum when she bought 5 little goldfishes to rear last week. I wasn't sure at first of her decision, as I already have an active Flowerhorn fish to take care of, but what the heck, the more the merrier and we now welcome the newest batch of fishes into the family.     Contrary to the shopkeeper's advice, the tiny goldfishes have the appetite of an elephant. They indicate that they're hungry by opening and closing their mouths at the surface of the water whenever someone's near them. I feed them about 4 to 5 times a day (in tiny amounts) and it's about the same for the flowerhorn fish (in bigger amounts though).     I could remember the first time we kept fishes, it was when the whole family was staying at a little town in Johore about 7 or 8 years ago. Mum was inexperienced in keeping fishes and used detergent in washing the tanks. She also neglected in setting up an air pump for the fishes. It wasn't surprising that the fishes never lived longer than a week or so. I wished I could've learned more about keeping fishes but I didn't know where to get the information, as nobody told my mum how to keep them. The interest soon waned after the last one passed away.     Fast forward to 2002 and we were armed with more knowledge and we were soon keeping a good looking flowerhorn fish. Keeping flowerhorn fishes were the "in" season at that time. He was an strong and active fella, he even survived a fall from a metre down after taking a bite at my finger, holding on as I pulled back my hand and then landing on the floor. He was a bit distraught, but he soon recovered.    Unfortunately, all of the time and effort in taking care and playing with him went to naught as he bumped his head on the plastic tank. I suspect his brain had been damaged as he was unable to swim upright despite the effort in guiding him. We took him out of the tank and placed him in a shallow tub with an electric air pump. Sadly he didn't live to see the next morning. Losing a pet felt real painful and just like a little child, I cried hard that night.    Another few months later on December 31st, 2002. It was another memorable date for me, no it doesn't have anything to do with New Year's Eve, it was the date when me and my mum were walking back from Taman Free School, since we were passing by the fish shop, we decided to take a look at the fishes there. Another flowerhorn fish caught my mum's eye. She asked me if I wanted to buy it but even though the stigma of losing the previous one made me hesitate for a while, I said yes.     Her first comment after bringing him back home was  "aiyoh, so black black yellow yellow one, wasted thirty ringgit only"  (translated from Hokkien). The little fish soon proved her wrong as the horrible colours gave way to a nice mix of pink, green, black and yellow. Now, after a year and almost 8 months later, his head is still normal, unlike the giant sized lump on usual flowerhorn fishes. In fact it was the lump that made those fishes popular in the first place! But then again, I don't prefer the enlarged forehead. He already looks good enough. =)     I had a scare last month when he knocked his head on the plastic tank. He almost ended up like the previous one when he started spinning out of control. It was as though he couldn't find where was the way up. I quickly put my hands in the tank to guide him while muttering  "no, no, no, no, no" , as the previous incident was starting to repeat itself. Luckily this time I noticed that he was determined in steadying himself as he struggled to stay upright. My worst fear didn't became a reality. Thank God.    Btw, my aunt's stepson loves this flowerhorn fish. He comes here once in a while and interacts with him. He even talks to the fish! XD

      Lucia's recent  urlLink entry  at her blog prompted me to blog about my own desk... =P     Here's a pic of my desk:      urlLink      (Click to see the larger pic)     First thing's first, actually I'm not sitting that close to the TV, I sit more like a tilt facing my CPU. As you can see, there's a radio near the floor, which I always tune in to Light & Easy. The door on the right leads to the balcony. My monitor is 17" and it weighs heavy (it left a deep imprint on the desk, btw). I've used this chair for about 7 or 8 years already, the cushion is all but gone and I place my royal butt on a pillow... XD The wooden chair is handy for placing snacks, the daily newspaper, my homework, or my legs... ;P     My mum places her decorative items, like the miniature dragon boat, along with the telephone on the desk. Since I don't use my printer much, I'll just chuck it in the spot there together with some piles of paper. The bookcrossing book (it's released long ago) is on my desk, as I usually place my bookcrossing supplies and the occasional book there.     My computer's specifications is pathetic... XD It's running on Intel Pentium 4 1.5GHz, 128MB SDRAM memory, 40GB Maxtor hard drive, 12x/8x/32x CD Burner, 52x CDROM drive, Nvidia GeForce2 MX 200 graphics card, Windows XP Home Edition. The 29" TV beside me is way cooler... =P     Just picture me placing my leg on the chair. Now you know where I blog from!

      If you have a sore throat, get ready for colds or the flu. After reading one of those health tips and handy tricks books 2 years ago, I noticed that each and every time my sore throat gets better (with or without Strepsils), I either get colds or the flu. o_O The book didn't explain about how sore throat and colds/flu go hand in hand in tormenting my day. Crap, my nose is now leaking like tap water, my eyes is watering and I'm sneezing rapidly. I command you to be gone forever, evil virus!  Last night I managed to invite roughly 80 new Malaysian members at  urlLink Bookcrossing.com  to the Yahoo! group! It was a month ago since I last invited the new-comers. Serves the procrastinator right! Eheheh... -_- I was planning to make inviting members a weekly routine but it gradually turned into a  bi-weekly   tri-weekly  monthly affair. Too bad there's no mass-PMing function. That'll motivate me to invite more frequently.. =P  I'm also a bit disappointed at first for not getting mentioned in an  urlLink article  at The Star's Youth2 section... But then I'd also rather let this blog be semi-conspicuous, I wouldn't want any of my school's teachers or even heck, the headmaster to be reading this blog!  Oh well, C'est la Vie...

      I got my ass busted today by the discipline teacher, Mr. Lim, because of the 4 times reaching school late. -_- It's not that I wanted to reach there late, but once in a while like Murphy's Law, shit happens and oh well... At least he gave the only and last warning that my parents would be called to the school the next time I get to school late. Most of the time, it's just less than one minute! Another thing I noticed is that there's another student in my school with the same name as mine (he's in Form 2 though) also being booked 4 times for the same offence! Well, that's a strange coincidence...

      My life is so unorganised that I rotate around what I like to do. I used to collect stamps, then I became interested in gardening, later I kept a fish, next I got online and started surfing like hell. Btw, I stopped the former 2 but I still collect first day covers at the  Taman Free School  mini post office.     And then on the internet, there's the several interests which I rotate. At the moment, it's blogging, previously it was reading novels, Gmail, Neopets, Bookcrossing, posting in forums. And then with forums, I rotate around several forums about the supernatural, Gmail, technology, anthropomorphology and the smattering of other various interesting forums.     The universe doesn't rotate around me, I rotate around the universe.    On other news, the posters and banners within a KM radius advertising the school's alumni's 35th anniversary celebrations just ended last night. Although I didn't attend the celebration, it was surely grand with several giant tents, one including a stage, erected on the school field. They even made a "gateway" out of branches and placed a "WELCOME" banner near the entrence of the school gate.  One thing odd is the choice of advertisers. You see, there's a small billboard promoting the celebration put up at the school fence facing the roundabout. I wouldn't blame people if they though it was for Father Julien's funeral or something like that at first glance, because next to a giant photo of him with the school in the background are 3 Chinese words in white letters with a black background that says "bu4 tiao2 wang2" (BanNer King). That part took 1/8 out of the billboard. Turns out that after a closer look, it was printed and sponsored by the same company. Real odd. And while I was thinking about it along to school last Thursday, I turned around and saw a funeral ceremony right next to the school. Somebody living in the condominium next to the school had just passed away. =/

         Yep, recently Google has  urlLink bought up  Picasa, the photo management software previously priced at US$29, and made it free for everyone! I tried it out after  urlLink downloading  it, the only thing I can say is that it's sweet! =D The interface is very neat and the photo loading is super fast! It even includes some simple photo editing features like red-eye removal, cropping, enhancing and rotating. It also provides a full-screen slideshow for you to present your family's recent vacation trip!    On another note, the blogger  urlLink text upgrade  is useful but the typing freezes once in a while... =/

      I always see them feral cats in the alley on my never-ending walk to school everyday. They're cautious towards people and it's hard for anyone to get near them, including the very people who feed them. I estimate the cat population in that alley to be 10-15 cats, including kittens. Now there's quite a lot of people who use the alley as a shortcut from Perak Road to Taman Free School since another small  lorong  had been cleared out together with quite a number of houses for developement.  I used to call out to the cats but as usual, they respond with a stare. A cautious stare. But one cat seemed to be different from the rest. He's a grey, striped cat with a whole of of affection. =) Not that I don't like my fish anymore, but I've always longed for a cat, my cat. Sadly the committee don't allow cats or dogs in the block, but I've seen a poodle and quite a few kinds of miniature dogs around the block... Go figure...  Back on topic, my mood has been lifted these recent weeks because of this same cat. He'll act like a domesticated kitty around me but hostile towards others. o_O Whenever I see that patch of grey fur and I call out, he walks towards me and and craves attention so much that he'd follow me for a few metres after I continue walking... heheh...  What a cat! =)

      Wikipedia is another proof that the internet will snuff out any other existing encyclopedia out there, whether in book form or software. =) Sales of Encarta and Brittanica are going to suffer.   urlLink Wikipedia  is a free internet encyclopedia that relies on everybody to contribute. Unlike the normal "Phd. or higher" requirement to contribute to encyclopedias, anybody can write, edit or update any article in the Wikipedia! Through  urlLink Wiki  technology, anybody can click on the "edit" button and contribute to Wikipedia regardless of Phd or not... =) So far the Wikipedia has over 299,409 articles in English and there are 186 languages being used in the Wikipedia, including  urlLink Malay  with 2555 articles. =)  So far, the only article I could say I really contributed is the  urlLink Bookcrossing  article. I just don't know much about the others... =P

      One of my friend from the chess club complained to me some time ago that one of the committee members of the chess club had flipped the chess board and sent the pieces flying after an arguement on the day that I wasn't there. He also said that a few members were sent to the co-curriculum headmaster's office. Hm... He said that this committe member had a different face when I didn't attend the meetings. I asked another member who's in Form 2 but he said he didn't see anything. Now, I don't completely trust this friend, but I did notice that this committee member always spoke to me softly and quietly but occasionally shouts at the others. o_O I just got reminded of this incident because I met him in the canteen today and he used that same, quiet tone to tell me that I should have my breakfast before the meetup starts because some students had complained about me... o_O  Anyway, just to cover my friend's back and avoid trouble from happening, I'll try to attend every meetup...

      Today at school seemed like a normal school day until I realised that nothing in this school is normal. Mr. Tan, the disciplinary teacher was making some announcements in the hall and the as usual, some of the unfortunate students were called to stand up on the stage for various offences like playing truant, uncompleted homework, being rowdy and the occasional money-laundering. Usual stuff.  One period before recess, Benny (unofficial first name), the monitor asked me to accompany him to the teachers' office to find something for the teacher and we saw that the mother of one of the students were walking there. She was holding a rattan cane. o_O I overheard her asking another teacher where she could find Mr. Tan.  Both of us sliped out of the teachers' office knowing what was about to happen next.  "Terrible" is the only thing I could describe the situation. :|

      "Chirp, chirp chirp, chirp, chirp!!!"  Repeat sound for next 5 days. That's how it's been going on here. If you lived around the Jelutong-Perak Road area or just passed by, there's this odd chirping noise somewhere around here. It chirps non-stop from dusk to dawn and dawn to dusk. My mother says that it's a recording, and I'm sure that she's right. If it was a real bird, it would've collapsed and died from all of that chirping.  "Chirp, chirp, chirp chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp!!!"  I have no idea why the person who wanted to play the recording 24/7. Maybe it's to attract birds? I myself think that the guy has gone completely loco. The others in the neighbourhood must've been insane for not complaining about the sound. An early morning chip is okay, but a shrill-sounding chirp throughout the night? I'm thankful that I live in an apartment and my room is at the other side of the unit. And even though it's about 300 metres away from my apartment block, the sound is still audible and very clear. Must be good quality speakers. :|   "Chirp chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp!!!"  Somebody please put an end to this!

      Just as I was about to step into the elevator to get to school last Friday noon, I noticed a tiny feather lying just outside of the door. Picked it up, looked at it and placed it pocket. Just as I left the apartment block, I saw another feather! But this time it's much larger than the earlier one. This freaky moment reminded me of the feather that appeared at the start and at the end of the movie Forrest Gump.   urlLink    (Click to see the enlarged version, smaller pic above is roughly about the same size as the real one)

      Here are some scans of the envelopes that used to contain books sent by some of my Bookcrossing friends to me as a requested RABCK... =)   urlLink     urlLink    (Click the pics to see the enlarged version. Addresses, including mine have been removed due to privacy reasons)  First one was  urlLink Wild Justice  by Philip Margolin, which was sent by Senorag and it traveled half-way around the world through surface mail from April 9, 2004 to June 23, 2004.  Second one was  urlLink Forrest Gump  by Winston Groom. It was kindly sent by Meshe and the trip lasted a short 13 days, which was from June 18, 2004 to June 30, 2004.  Thanks to both for the wonderful books! =)  Btw, contact me if you'd like to read any of books listed as "available" in my  urlLink bookshelf . I'd be glad to send them to anywhere in Malaysia! (Please register with Bookcrossing first though)

      The monitor was repaired and sent back to my home yesterday! But it costed RM80 for the fried components... T_T So anyway, I spent most of my free time (aka internetless time) reading some of the novels. I finished Sons of Heaven by Terrence Cheng, Forrest Gump by Winston Groom and Steroid Blue by Richard La Plant within 3 days! I was beginning to worry about finding time to finish the big stack of books... hehe...  Last Saturday was the first ever  urlLink BookCafe  -  urlLink Malaysian Bookcrossers  Meetup in Penang! After the countless joint meetups held in Kuala Lumpur, I was thrilled to attend one here. =) Anyways, the meetup was just tiny but not in anyway a disappointment. Well, 2 is the minimum number of people needed to hold a meetup, right? =)  Tim posted a question on BookCafe asking if we could hold a meetup in Penang but I didn't notice it until Zarina pointed it out to me (thanks!) but before I could give me any more information the darn monitor broke down. Hmph. So I had to go to my friend's house to get online for the next 3 days... It's as excruciating as being constipated using a 28.8Kbps dial-up connection... XD  So, big day: Saturday July 3, 2004. Time: 3:15pm - 5:15pm. Venue: Starbucks, Prangin Mall, Penang.  Me and Mom arrived at Prangin Mall at 3pm sharp and I went inside Starbucks to see if Tim had already arrived or not. I saw some suspicious faces but there's no books on the table, so if couldn't be him. After a quick glance, I SMSed Tim and he called back saying that he's already at the car park and he'll be there in 5 minutes. He also said that he wore a pair of blue jeans and beige shirt, but I somehow heard that as pink! XD So imagine the temporarily confusion when a guy carrying a backpack walked up to me and said "Are you Andy?"  "Ah... So you're Tim!" was the reply that escaped from my mouth. -_- Did I ever mention that I was nervous around people? So expect me to stutter a bit and sometimes seemingly talking a bit of incomprehensible sentences when meeting me in real life... XD  Formalities took over us it seems, as we stopped at the front door to let each other enter the shop first... I was nervous I tell you! XD Tim and I went to the counter and he ordered Starbucks brew of the day, and then he asked me what I'd like. He then passed the Bookcrossing label pin to me (gift from Emily in KL) and said "here's your pin". It was very cute, I have to say! (I was talking about the pin) Imagine me as the country bumpkin there as I haven't ordered from Starbucks before. "I'll have whatever you're getting..." I should've said "having". The jitterbug strikes again. I helped him carry the tray containing 2 very black mugs filled to the brim with coffee and we sat down at a table close to the entrance.  Okay, first thing's first. He took out the 2 books which were passed on to him from Denise at the recent meetup in Kuala Lumpur on June 27 and passed them to me!  urlLink The Love Hexagon  and  urlLink Time to Say Good-Bye  were the titles of the 2 books. We started off with a bit of chatting before he brought out his Dell Inspiron notebook and proceeded to insert a WiFi card to surf the internet wireless! The 2 books were then journaled and Tim posted his comments on the 2 books at the Bookcrossing site.  We then went about discussing about the sites on the internet that we frequently visit (if you're reading this right now Viewtru, we laughed out loud at the pic in your blog... XD) and checked our e-mail... =)  It went on until 5:15pm when Mom called me that it's time to go... =) I got up, shook hands and left the cafe. That ended the first meetup in Penang!

      I know that there's so many things to do, so many novels to read, so many games to play, so many things to blog, so many blogs to read and so many forums to participate. The internet is an abyss full of interesting and entertainting writing. Problem is that there's not enough time in a day. And to make things worse, my school's exams start in exactly a week and I'm feel that I'm not that prepared enough for it. Sigh...  Blogging and almost everything else takes a back seat until the exams end and as you can see...  Lastly, I'll leave you with this pic, which screams out what I'm thinking at the moment...

      According to the  urlLink Oddly Enough  section at Yahoo! News...  * More and more Finnish conscripts are being dismissed from the armed forces due to  urlLink internet addiction ! It states that they're not fit for duty because they can't adjust to army routine.  Are they just plain weak or is internet addiction a big problem? I'd prefer to go with the latter, as I've been there before and gotten back. Internet addiction did really screw up my life at that time.  Makes me wonder if I could use that as an excuse for putting off national service in 3 years time... =P  * I never thought there would be another case of  urlLink postmen slacking , but it did happen again! Another postman working for Pos Malaysia had kept 21,000 letters, which also included magazines, bills, bank statements in his room with some being kept as long for 4 years!  Guinness World Records, anyone?  * The owners of an Amazon orange-winged parrot have booked themselves into a clinic to  urlLink quit smoking  after their vet told them that it was the only way to save him...  That's so noble of them... Awww...  =)  Btw, been busy lately, exams coming, blogging infrequently. =(  Check LJ tomorrow for more yakking... XD          31.25 %            My weblog owns 31.25 % of me.  urlLink Does your weblog own you?    Got it from Lucia's  urlLink blog !
