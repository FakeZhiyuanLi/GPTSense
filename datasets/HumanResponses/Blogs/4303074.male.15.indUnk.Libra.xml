      *from Yahoo  --  urlLink Montreal Expos  first baseman  urlLink Nick Johnson  was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday with a broken right cheekbone and is probably out for the rest of the season. Johnson was injured Friday night when a hard shot by Colorado's  urlLink Royce Clayton  took a strange hop and hit him between his right cheek and jaw. Johnson immediately went down face first onto the infield dirt, kicking his feet up and down as Clayton rounded first for a double. The 25-year-old Johnson never lost consciousness and was taken to a hospital for X-rays that revealed a fracture.  ``My face is pretty sore and I've had to take a lot of pills,'' he said. ``They are telling me four to six weeks and the chances of me coming back this season aren't very good.''  ~~Johnson is batting .251 with seven home runs and 33 RBIs in 73 games.  Expos starting pitcher  urlLink Tony Armas  Jr. also left Friday night's game with an injury when a batted ball hit him on the shin. Montreal recalled outfielder Ryan Church from Triple-A Edmonton to take Johnson's roster spot. Church was hitting .343 with 17 home runs and 78 RBIs in 98 games for Edmonton.  *Good luck to the expos! urlLink

      Wayne Gretzky has again bestowed the honor of captain on  urlLink Mario Lemieux . Team Canada named Lemieux as its captain for the World Cup of Hockey, which begins August 30. The  urlLink Pittsburgh Penguins  superstar center served as captain for Canada's 2002 gold medal winning Olympic team in Salt Lake City. "Mario is a great leader and we are very happy to again name him as the captain of Team Canada," said Gretzky, Canada's executive director.  *from yahoo

      I may be posting a lot of news, scores and standings, but I will also be arguing. Ex: About some umpire calls made in a baseball game. Bud Selig (man do I hate him).....ect. I love hockey, i do but man they should fix this money budget! Insane the money players make in the game! Chris Pronger 10 Million, Jagr 11 Million and Forsberg 11 Million. Sure these players are well known and are good, but are they really worth that much! Jagr has been doing squat the last 2 years, Forsberg can put hell of numbers for you. Pronger is a great defenceman but gets hurt a lot. What's next, players being payed 20 million a year!!!! The way this is going, there won't be hockey for 2 years, a better chance at making it 3! I always asked myself this question whenever i would see players signed for 10+ million a year. What would Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, the Great be getting if they were still playing. They'd deserve more than 15 million a year thats for sure. All i'm saying is that the hockey league should have a payroll limit and they should give players more than 6 million! Thats way to much! Sports are fun to watch, but what they're payed is way to much!

      When they got him, they thought he'd help the team quite a bit, but now they realized that he's been doing nothing, his starts as a yankee have sucked. He only lasted 3 innings in his last start giving up 7 hits and 4 runs. Yanks have had second thoughts this weekend about trying to trade him to texas, off waivers of course. Yankees have been doing bad the last couple of weeks. They were ahead of boston by 10,5 and now they see that they are just 6,5 games ahead!

      This is my first movie report on this site. As you can see up ahead it says   Best damn sports blog ever.....and movie reports too  Anyways, i went to see the movie the village, where many people, i'm sure, were very anxious for it to come out. I know i was. Before i went to see the movie i checked up some reviews about the movie, even though it never affects me, i was just curious. Too my amaze i was shocked and let down. Many people have said it was garbage and not worth the money. But you know we all have our diferent opinions about everything, so i didn't mind. Hey! I was paying only 5 bucks that night, the theaters has specials on tuesdays and wednesdays. I still expected it too be scary and frightning. When the movie ahd finished, only one word to quote it....the  horror......   It wasn't scary at all, only like 2 small parts made me jump because of the loud noise as the camera turned. There were some chilling scenes, that made you sit at the edge but that was it. I was disappointed at the movie, but most of all at Shyamalan (hope i'm spelling it right). He made great movies: the  sixth sense, signs  ect. He was known for his twists, but this movie was given to you with 20 minutes in the movie, not good! It was obvious what the ending was, but you weren't sure, because of the way the actors responded at some point.   The acting wasn't that bad, Phoenix was good but the blind girl was better. Not bad of a cast for this kind of movie. I'm surprised he didn't chosoe Bruce willis to play leas role...lol. I don't know, does he love Bruce or what?  Anyways, i found this movie a disappointment and upsetting. This was at the bottom of the films he made. Litteraly it wasn't scary!  I give it 4.5/10....

      Every two days i will report what has gone in the nhl so far: signings, trades, the cba ect. ~Well my sources say that the  rangers  are interested in canes starter  kevin weeks.  He earned 2.35 million a year with Carolina. If he were to sign with the rangers, look for either dunham to be traded or to be the backup, while Blackburn will stay in the minors. If it would happen and Dunham would be traded than Blackburn would be #2.  ~Robert Reichel { Toronto maple leaf } is headed to latvinov for this season. Players aren't sure there'll be hockey this season, so why not! Since Toronto did not excercise his option he decided to go back to Latvinov {his home} , where his son can grow up.  He recently played there in 98-99 and 99-00.  ~Again with the leafs. Eddy "the eagle" belfour may miss more than expected. Toronto are expected to start the season (if there is one) without the Eagle. They (doctors) say that it has gotten worse and he may need surgery to repair a bulging disc in his back. For the past 3-4 years, maybe even more, eddy has missed games dew to back problems. Hopefully it won't affect the team......sure it will....toronto needs him.

      I know its been a while since it first came out to the theaters, yet it still impresses me in so many ways. I'm not a big fan of Sam Raimi but i got to admit he did a hell of a job on this movie. If you don't know, he was the one who made Evil dead series and he's very good friends with Bruce campbell (star of evil dead...aka: Ash) who also appears in spider-man 1 & 2. He's more of an extra, he had little parts in the movies. In the first one he was the announcer at the wrestling match, and the second one he was the man guarding the door while mary jane performed in her broadway. Anyways lets cut to the action......          Was the action good or what? Damn right it was! Superb effects that made your eyes pop out. If your a spidey fan, than you'd love this movie. I know people that went to see it 4 times already! The action was better than the first, more claw gripping fights.....{claw gripping? lol}.  Even when the action calmed down, it was still an exciting movie. Lots of funy joke, man i can say it was funnier than the first. I found it more entence, more suspence at some scenes.          I think the second movie had to be an all around movie. What i mean is it had to have more action, yet still have a great story and keep the audience alive whenever there wasn't any action, with jokes. I'm still impressed wiht this movie.          Did you notice that the sequels have been getting better so far? The Bourne Supremecy, Spider-Man 2, Kill Bill 2!          I give this movie 9.5/10   If you haven't seen it, then you aren't a spider-man fan!
