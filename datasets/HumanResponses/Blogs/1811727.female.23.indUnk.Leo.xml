      Ok, so I lied.  I'm posting again before this gets even more outdated... Most of you have probably seen it by now, but in case you haven't, ITP pointed me toward  urlLink the latest ad  on Bush's blog last week.  They have since then updated the video to have a little disclaimer thing at the beginning, but it doesn't help their case much.  If any of you out there can explain to me why  they  would want to publicize this, please let me know.  My first reaction was to bust out laughing.  I am not at all sure of their intentions, but I'm going to hazard a guess and say that they weren't trying to make me laugh.  I know I'm biased, but I can't imagine that anyone who was undecided before seeing that video would be swayed by it.  The things I noticed:  1. They're giving the Dems airtime. 2. They are talking about the things Bush has done wrong. 3. They include Nazis. 4. Bush looks creepy in that picture. 5. They show no clips of Bush saying anything at all. 6. Even including Nazis, they can't make Bush look like a good leader.  In response to the Kerry campaign saying:  "The fact that George Bush thinks it's appropriate to use images of Adolph Hitler in his campaign raises serious questions about his fitness to spend another four years in the White House. Adolph Hitler slaughtered millions of innocent people and has no place in a campaign that is supposed to be about the future and hope of this nation. The President's use of these images during a month that evoked the memory of World War II is remarkably insensitive to the sacrifices of the millions of people who lost their lives during Hitler's reign of terror.  "The Bush Campaign should immediately remove these hateful images from its website and apologize for using them. The use of Adolph Hitler by any campaign, politician or party is simply wrong."   the Bush campaign had this to say:  " We agree.      * Where was John Kerry's disgust when he hired Zack Exley - the man responsible for encouraging the production of these ads as part of a MoveOn contest - to run the Kerry campaign's internet operation?     * Where was John Kerry's sense of outrage when Al Gore, just Thursday afternoon, compared the Bush Administration to the Nazis saying, "The Administration works closely with a network of 'rapid response' digital Brown Shirts who work to pressure reporters and their editors for 'undermining support for our troops.'"     * Where was John Kerry's anger when Al Gore in May spoke of "Bush's Gulag"?     * Why has John Kerry not denounced billionaire and Democrat Party donor George Soros for comparing the Bush Administration to Nazis. Soros stated, "When I hear Bush say, 'You're either with us or against us,' it reminds me of the Germans. It conjures up memories of Nazi slogans on the walls, Der Feind Hort mit ('The enemy is listening')."     * Why has Kerry not spoken out against filmmaker Michael Moore who last October compared the Patriot Act to Mein Kampf. "The Patriot Act is the first step. 'Mein Kampf' - 'Mein Kampf' was written long before Hitler came to power."  We created this web video to show the depths to which these Kerry supporters will sink to win in November."   Right... but see, they didn't make the moveon ads.  The contest was for other people to make them.  Also, they're comparing him to a Nazi because of his actions.  Patriot Act:Mein Kempf :: Bush:Hitler.  Sure, they're being extreme in their comparisons, but not completely unfounded.  Now, the Bush campaign is grouping Hitler in with the dems, but on what grounds, exactly?  And, especially for those people who haven't seen the moveon ads, what message are they trying to convey?  I, myself, have not seen this ad, even though I have been to the  urlLink moveon.org  site to view the  urlLink contest ads .    And apparently, that ad was removed over 6 months ago.  urlLink PRESS RELEASE: Wes Boyd, Founder of MoveOn.org Voter Fund, Sets Republican National Committee Chair and Record Straight :   Said Boyd, "None of these was our ad, nor did their appearance constitute endorsement or sponsorship by MoveOn.org Voter Fund. They will not appear on TV. We do not support the sentiment expressed in the two Hitler submissions. They were voted down by our members and the public, who reviewed the ads and submitted nearly 3 million critiques in the process of choosing the 15 finalist entries."   Finally, in light of the psychological warfare in progress, I find it ironic that (courtesy of Fahrenheit 9/11) the current administration is constantly bombarding us with yellow, orange, and red alerts with things to be worried about and attacks on the horizon and then they proceed by concluding their argument with, "This is John Kerry's Coalition of the Wild-eyed, who have nothing to offer but fear-mongering."  Hey, Ben, is  that  ironic?  :) -E.

      LOTD from my sis:  urlLink SAT Scores   Ok, so I know there's the whole scaling thing now, so the scores aren't exactly comparable and standardized tests aren't always accurate in evaluating a person's intelligence.  But the kind of intelligence that this particular exam measures as it applies to skills necessary to run a country... I would really feel more comfortable if our President weren't so completely lacking when it comes to basic intelligence.  I would also be curious to know what the breakdown of his score was, but I guess that's really irrelevant anyway.  Bare minimum, I would like a president who is smarter than me.  (No way I think I'm smart enough or experienced enough to run a country, but come on... I know enough to know which one of these do not belong when we start looking at groups of international leaders and our president is the one on television saying "Bring it on!" when addressing a  war .)  But that aside, if you're going with the idea that the President is just a figure head and as long as his cabinet is intelligent and can keep the country in order, why would you pick some idiot riding along on his daddy's coattails?  Pick someone who has good stage presence and can pronounce two-syllable words correctly.  Anyway, enough of that.  Just came across another site a few minutes ago that seemed kind of interesting.  It's still a work in progress, but it's a website about how Kerry sucks, but people should still vote for him.  The lesser of two evils.

      I ventured out to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 last night and, as everyone else has been saying, it is a very powerful movie.  Most of the information provided I had heard about before, like the connection between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family, the financial reasons behind the war, and the fact that Bush has been wanting to attack Iraq since before 9/11.  I did not know that Bush sat around for almost 10 minutes reading  My Pet Goat  along with a class of kindergarteners (not even reading to them... Someone else was reading) after he was informed of the attack on the twin towers.  I also did not know that flights were approved to allow the members of the Bin Laden family currently in the US to leave and return to Afghanistan, while all other flights were canceled.  I think Moore did a good job of connecting the dots and, though the movie was definitely leading, it does force you to question the actions of the current administration, whether you agree with his conclusions or not.  It's hard to say, "Michael Moore is a liar" without actually doing research to prove what it was he was misrepresenting.  I believe that no matter how unflatteringly he portrayed people, those people did an equally poor job of portraying themselves.  For the most part, he merely compiled clips of things people said on camera.  To me, the striking part of the film came from the footage of the war, moreso than the conclusions he drew from the information he gathered.  Intellectually, I understand there's a war going on and this means that people get hurt, people hurt others, and people die.  But actually hearing some of the soldiers talk, the music they listen to to get them in the mood to kill, watching the civilians cart away the corpses of family members and neighbors, and then seeing children wounded from attacks and soldiers missing limbs and trying to live their lives when all they do is try to make it through the pain to face the next minute...  it's numbing.  When he first begins talking to the soldiers, I think they are portrayed very negatively, which, on the one hand is disrespectful to these people who are doing their best follow their orders, but on the other hand, he didn't bad-mouth them; he showed what they said.  It's not representative of all soldiers, and he does later show a more human[e] side of some other soldiers.  Psychologically, I understand that killing is not something we are normally raised to do.  So, in order to cope with this dissonance, they have to separate themselves from the lives that they're actually taking.  The way they do this is demonizing the people in their minds.  They're trying to help these people, and for some reason the people they're trying to help don't like Americans.  They must deserve what they get then.  It must all be justified.  Sure, civilians are hurt in the attacks, but those casualties are "worth" it in order to get the bad guys.  I did find it a little surprising that Hussein's actions toward the Iraqi people were completely glossed over.  Maybe the media has mislead me, but it seemed like things couldn't have been as completely happy and chipper as the film portrayed them to be prior to war.  Anyway, I don't think that I really had a point and I'm tired of writing now.  My opinion: I would recommend watching this movie.  If you don't like Michael Moore, you will know what was addressed so you can argue the points that he made to people who follow him blindly.  If you do like him, think and make your own conclusions.  Don't be a lemming.  :) -E.  Stolen from ROD: Counterbias.com--  urlLink Flawed but powerful, Fahrenheit 9/11 tells a heartbreaking story of war

      You ever play with those mouse trap games where you have a marble that slides down a bunch of ramps and then when it gets to the bottom, it releases a latch, and that causes a weighted cage to drop on a mouse or something like that?  So ok. There's this big on-going debate about evolution vs. creationism. And I understand that the Bible says what it says and all that. But science says what it says. And you believe in medicine and genetics, right? Now, is it really that blasphemous to believe that evolution and creationism both might exist? Yeah, ok, so the way they are explicitly described, yes, it is. But play along with me for a minute. What if God wanted to experiment? What if he wanted to have some fun on his journey to creating the world. Seven days, I mean... For an omnipotent being, that's practically an eternity. So, let's say, he thought he could start with another kind of animal and invent this thing that we call evolution, and see if he could make one turn into the other. Funny, right? How is that possible? Why would He do that? He can do whatever he wants, right? He's God. So, maybe people got it a little bit mixed up when they wrote the stories down. Maybe even back then, evolution sounded fantastic. But is it really impossible that this being that created the world may have even planned out a little change in his creatures?  And backing up a few steps to God having a sense of humor... Why do some Christians believe that only those few people who have accepted Jesus as their Lord and savior will go to Heaven? If one person spends their life doing good and helping their fellow inhabitants on this earth (regardless of race, religion, species, etc.), why should they go to Hell while someone else who accepts Jesus gets a free ticket in to Heaven even though he does not abide by any human laws or show any respect to other organisms? A truly benevolent God would not allow that to happen. And yet, if I am to understand this, basically all you have to do is be a sycophant and you get in, no questions. It seems to me if this being takes himself so seriously that anyone that may doubt his existence, or would even know his existence by any other name, is condemned to eternal damnation, maybe spending eternity with him won't be as pleasant as people make it out to be. Or maybe he doesn't take himself that seriously, but he does take his morality that seriously. And maybe actions speak louder than mere beliefs that may change with a passing whim.  Just a thought. :) -J.

      I don't know why this started happening, or even when it started, but angry people amuse me.  I don't think it's the way people look when they're angry, which, although funny, I cannot see when people write rants.  But I find written rants just as amusing as verbal ones.  It may be due to the fact that the only times I got responses when I started my blog was when I was angry and other people agreed with me.  So, I was then conditioned to write angry blogs.  Anyway, now it has gotten to the point where any time someone is angry, I just feel like laughing.  I like being angry because then I have stuff to rant about and then I can laugh at how angry I am.  Is that weird?  Oh well.  Whatever.  I was all worked up over TB being angry at everyone and then she wrote an entry about how we're all out of the triangle and that made my day.  I couldn't stop laughing, but I can't really explain why.  I mean, I knew she was angry.  Plenty of people told me how angry she was.  And, boy, was she angry.  But just that triangle thing made it all ok.  I mean, not ok in her eyes, I'm sure.  But it made things better to me.  As someone else mentioned to me, the triangle only applies if she wins the lottery.  So, odds are, it doesn't matter anyway.  Anyway, my sis has her angry blog and that's very entertaining.  Just today, her mother left a comment that was agreeably angry.  Angry people are just so funny.  I like to point and laugh.  It makes them angrier and it makes me laughier.  *points and laughs*  *giggle*  :) -E.

As far as you're concerned, if you can't see, touch and kick something, it's not real to you.

Lastly, if anyone chooses to preach at you otherwise, you will either leave or debate them until they finally shut up.   Hhaha I love that it says kick.  This is so me.

      Growing up, I had so little interest in politics and current events, but just in this past year, I have started transitioning into a news junkie.  I think part of it has to do with the fact that I have more time now.  I wouldn't take the time away from classes, studying, and homework to read up on the news and I was just cut off from the "real" world the whole time I was in school.  These people whom I never cared about getting elected before are affecting my life and the lives of those around me in ways I never even considered before.  It makes a difference whether the elected officials hold the same views as me.  Before, I just thought, "Stupid government... they never get anything done anyway.  Why does it matter who's in charge?"  But now I know better.  Just looking at the state of the economy and nothing else, it's obvious that certain presidents have more of a clue than others.  And the more I read, the more informed I become, and the more I discuss with people, the more opinionated I get.  I never thought I would be going to rallies and marches.  I never thought I would be active in walks and runs to raise money for charities.  I never thought I would give my money away to people I didn't think had "earned" it.  I find myself disagreeing more and more with the views of my family and extended family, I wonder how that happened.  Don't people normally get shaped by those around them?  Don't they learn their morals, beliefs, and principles from their parents early on?  So how is it that I don't think money is the end-all, be-all of the world and happiness?  How is it that I support women's rights to have abortions, but don't consider myself a baby-killer?  How is it that I support gay marriage and don't worry that I may catch it one day (homosexuality, not marriage... I'm not sure how you would "catch" either of those, but I guess I haven't really read up on that lately.  Or ever.)  How is it that they spend at least two days a week, that I know of, discussing the Bible and God, when I don't even believe in God?  How is it that I came to live an "immoral lifestyle" (gallivanting around with *boys* and carousing), when I, uh... well, don't?  I never really discussed these things with my family up until these past few months and I don't know why, but I was really surprised at how little I had in common with them.  It kind of explains why we've always kind of rubbed each other the wrong way.  I mean, sure... family's family.  But that doesn't mean you have to like each other or get along.  We'll always be what we are, and I have no disillusion that I will convince them otherwise in their beliefs.  It's just mindboggling to me some of the things they believe that are so completely contrary to what I believe.  And, as I try, but cannot understand how they could possibly believe the things that they do, I'm sure my opposing beliefs are equally absurd.  On the opposite spectrum, I'm finding more and more of the people I hang out with have similar opinions to mine (Though that really shouldn't come as a surprise... that's what people do.  They gravitate to those with whom they feel a common connection.).  As my uber-conservative family surprised me simply because I never really thought about what kind of stance they might have on certain topics, other people surprised me on how open-minded they were to discussion.  Specifically, I've been talking to BFF about certain things lately and I remember completely disagreeing with her on a number of topics in high school, especially psychological disorders, and now we've kind of swung past each other and she's way more understanding of people and mental illness that I am.  I've become cynical and hard in my old age.  Heh.  ;)  But really... the last time we talked, she has become a lot more liberal than she used to be.  I don't know if it was college or med school... or just meeting a wider variety of people going through life, but I was surprised.  I guess in having these discussions with my family and people with opposing views, that's kind of what I want to have happen.  I want someone who so strongly opposes what I believe to convince me that their opinion has merit.  I mean, ok sure, everyone has an opinion and they can believe whatever they want.  But I want them to convince me of the reasons they believe something.  I want to be able to say, I believe what I believe, but he believes that because of these x, y, and z reasons.  I disagree, but I completely respect those points.  Or even past that, maybe they'll say something that I had never considered before and I'll have a revelation.  Something so convincing that it outweighs all the things I had held as my top priorities and I'll change my mind on something.  Still waiting though.  Even in recent discussions, I can come up with my own reasons why those people's opinions are valid, but those aren't the ones they're using to support their side.  I guess other people don't believe in things the same way it would take for me to believe what they do.  Go ahead.  Convince me.  -E.

      I've figured it out.  I have finally figured it out.  It's not that people who believe Bush are stupid.  It's that they believe blindly.  They have faith.  This is something that I do not have.  They want to believe that the president has been telling the truth.  As such, if the president said that there were weapons of mass destruction, there were weapons of mass destruction.  If he says there was a link between Al Qaeda and Hussein, there was a link.  On the other hand, if the media tells me that the president lied, I will believe them blindly.  There is no evidence to the contrary, so I will believe what I have evidence of.  That is, in this case, a lack of evidence holds as my proof by contradiction.  Want to change my mind?  Very simple: show me weapons of mass destruction.  Show me a connection between Hussein and Al Qaeda.  I was thinking about this and relating it to religion.  There has been little convincing evidence for me to believe in God.  At least a god as seen by most Christians.  Granted, that is far from being the only religion, but that is the one I am the most familiar with.  Having said that, no evidence in god: I don't believe in one.  Anyway, in making this comparison, shouldn't it hold that people who have faith and believe blindly in religion, god, a higher being... something intangible that they have little proof of... Shouldn't those people be more likely to believe on faith what the president has told this country?  And as I thought this, I realized that he does have strong support from the religious right.  Those who are very religious (at least Christian) and don't plan to vote for the incumbent, I believe, are probably voting for other reasons besides the war.  In any case, I wonder why he might not necessarily have as strong support from other strongly religious groups.  Are other religions so different that they would not believe in the same way or hold the same kind of faith in the information they receive?  Is religion separate from politics, such that in one area you can believe on faith, but in others, such as science or medicine, you must rely on hard facts and data.  Ok, so I haven't figured it all out.  yet.  But at least, for now, I can lean on this to allow me to not think that my family is stupid.  They're not uninformed or uneducated.  They have faith, where I have none.  The cynic in me believes that this war was unnecessary.  I believe that we were lied to.  I believe that this is the worst president of modern times.

      Dear  urlLink Miss Manners :  I am recently divorced after 21 years. Family and friends have come up to me many times and have said, "We never liked him. Did you know that?" They may have thought they were trying to make me feel better, but I assure you, it hurt and still does. I consider it an insult. What can I say to them that will stop them dead in their tracks?  "Well, I did." And, presuming that you can reasonably add this, "as a matter of fact, I still do."  Miss Manners understands how galling it is to be told that people with whom you socialized were secretly disparaging your spouse all along, even when things were going well. Makes you wonder about their opinion of you, beginning with how naive you were not to see his undesirability when they did.

       urlLink Info on the soldiers in Afghanistan   I'm not sure why this makes it more personal, but the fact that they released the names made it more real to me.  I mean, I know that I don't know these people.  And at most, this affects me from two degrees away.  Yet, it just all seems very real, very dangerous, very unfair.  This is what the world is, I suppose.  A place where people make a commitment to defend their nation and they are sent to their deaths.  I know it's not all like that.  But really, why are there so many people in Iraq?  Why are there so  few  people in Afghanistan?  Why in the National Guard getting sent overseas?  Because no one wants to be active duty army anymore.  No one wants to be in the military with this president.  We have run out of soldiers.  We are running out of people.  We are running out of resources and funding and ... hope.  All the problems in my life seem so completely trivial now.  And yet, I know that that's all I have.  And they fight so we can preserve that.  We can live our lives as we choose because they go to defend that privilege.  In a way, I guess it is good that my brother is in the army.  Not necessarily him, specifically, but someone I know.  This makes it very personal.  I follow the news like it is personal.  Because this affects him.  This affects me.  This affects us all.  Without that, we're just sending bodies overseas.  We're fighting with our faceless, nameless soldiers against their faceless, nameless soldiers and civilians.  The children who die don't have futures.  Those who sacrifice for their country do it for nothing.  But when it's personal, people care.  When it's personal, people pay attention.  When it's personal, people react.  They get involved.  They get outraged.  They are activists with a cause.  When people find their way out of this apathetic haze that surrounds them, we all benefit.  No more people wasting votes.  No more people complaining about government while doing nothing to initiate change within it.  No more faceless, wasted deaths.  But that's just my little pipe dream.  Where the world leads, I will follow.  -J.

       urlLink Weapons of mass distraction  stolen from NPR:  Number 10: Corporate Show Trials  Watching Martha, Ken and the Fastows doing the perp walk is a great diversion from the real crime. These show trials divert our focus to a few criminal acts from what's really wrong -- rules written by corporate lobbyists that legalized corporate tax evasion, corporate welfare, corporate pollution and looting.  Number 9: Donald Trump's TV Show The Apprentice  It's got us focused on Trump as this financial wizard and corporate titan -- someone people would kill off their competition to work for. In real life, his casinos are on the verge of bankruptcy and receivership.  Number 8: Bush's Anti-Gay Marriage Amendment  You'd think that marriage were somehow in imminent danger from gay infidels. But this is nothing more than a cynical wedge issue to increase the voter turnout of Christian evangelicals and cover broad failures of the Bush administration -- three million jobs lost, the biggest deficits in U.S. history, a failed war in Iraq and Osama bin Laden stronger than ever. GOP operatives manufacture a fake constitutional crisis over imaginary gay insurgents, and they aim for the brain stem so that we won't think about the bigger failures.  Number 7: Tom Ridge's Terror Alerts  No one knows what they mean. The last one warning that Bin Laden intends to attack this summer made no sense -- except to disrupt the Kerry-Edwards rollout. They are now rolling out plans for postponing the November election if an attack occurs.  Number 6: Rush Limbaugh  He's a masterful circus barker so skilled that he can seduce millions into surrendering their privacy rights under the USA Patriot Act. At the same time, he and the ACLU fight to keep his own medical records from a criminal drug investigation.  Number 5: Tax Cuts  The Bush administration has average Americans believing they are overtaxed and will benefit from cuts -- cuts that go overwhelmingly to folk richer than them, and result in cuts in services that they need but the rich don't.  Number 4: Ralph Nader  The only issue discussed is his "spoiler" role, the only people funding his candidacy are pro-Bush Republicans and the only outcome of his run is that the people he claims to care about -- the poor and the dispossessed -- will be devastated if Bush gets four more years to practice his "compassion."  Number 3: The Cult of Celebrity and Entertainment  We're laughing and entertaining ourselves to death. While our kids watch eight hours of TV a day, and more adults vote for the next American Idol than do for the next president, our democracy is being looted by superpower corporations and other high-octane interests.  Number 2: The Invasion of Iraq  There clearly was no reason to invade, other than to hide the fact bin Laden still hasn't been captured, and likely to remain so -- and the fact that Bush needed to kick any Arab butt he could to show that America hits back. Hussein's butt was the only one he could safely kick, so he did. Meanwhile, the war against al Qaeda flounders while the United States diverts its resources to the Iraq quagmire.  Number 1: The Republican Convention Lineup  They're going to dig up the few moderates (including Guiliani, Schwarzenegger, McCain and Romney) and black people they know and put them on TV, along with a whole bunch of black and Latino musical acts, to hide the real face of the GOP and its reactionary platform. The last convention looked like Saturday night at the Apollo -- there were more black people on stage than in the entire convention.
