      It's the first time ever in my life that i've heard of this "blog" business.  After reading an article in one of the new york newspapers online, blogging was a phenomenon that i'm totally unaware of. our office has blocked friendster and messenger access.  however, blogging is not yet banned so here goes.  hope to post more stuff...

      next month i will embark on a 2-year journey...which is studying to get a masters degree in business.  im giddy yet scared at the prospect of what the future holds.  i do hope that this decision is the right one and this is the right path to take for me to attain my dreams...

      what is the meaning of my life?  why am i here?  why does the time pass by so quickly and i feel no sense of accomplishment?  is this the beginning of the rest of my life?  will it be this way forever?  sometimes its easier to be childish and pretend that i'm still 18 without a care in the universe.  however i'm 26 way too old, i dont feel like a teenager anymore.  i have to stick with being "grown up" with responsibilities.  i dont have any problems.  im just at the crossroads of my life where i have yet to determine if this is the career or job that would make me happy.

      today had been a baptism of fire.  im just in awe of everyone talking at the same time in order to survive.  must be like the real world wherein everyone has to fend for his/her own interests.    i dont know whether im cut for the real world yet.  i had been classified as a "feeler" in our mbti testing.  Feelers are appropriate for these fields:  relgion and care-giving.  Makes me recount the countless times I want to be a missionary and teach indigeneous people and the children of the NPA's...  i dont know what will happen or what will come out of this endeavor...all i know is that i want to make a difference in this world...and make a difference in the lives of people...to somehow uplift a person's life will be enough and i can die happy...

      it's difficult when you love someone so much that it hurts....and you have to make a choice...on whether to continue loving that person or you hurting yourself by loving him...  love is such a complicated emotion and i used to think that only weaklings fall in love.  those mushy stuff that you say to each other, i used to think they were kinda funny...but once love has taken hold of your very existence, it's like a straightjacket...and you have to exert a houdini-like technique to break free.  i long to be free from bondage.  i long to feel like one of 'em seahorses again...
