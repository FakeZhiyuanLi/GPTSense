      "All right," Damien said as he hurried up the stairs to the rooms where the Snow family and Joel lived above their store.  The bathroom was the second to last room at the end of the hall, right next to Damien's bedroom. He closed the door behind him, not bothering to lock since there was only Joel around. As he kicked off his flip flops, Damien also threw his beach towel into the clothes hamper beside the sink. The he finally pulled down his swimming trunks which were still wet and made a squeaky sound when brushed against the skin of his legs.  Those were also tossed in the clothes hamper. Damien stepped into the shower stall and turned the water on. A quick spray of cold water hit him before it finally turned warm.   Maybe we'll catch a movie on Pay-Per-View , the boy thought as he squeezed out some shampoo from a bottle that was close to being empty.  His face wore a happy expression as he thought of spending time with his big brother without his parents around to remind him that it was time to go to bed.  "I have him all to myself."  While Damien worked up a lather and scrubbed furiously to get the clorine out of his hair, he noticed how good it felt to have the warm water running down his prepubescent body after such a long day of carefree play. After rinsing his hair, Damien reached for the soap and when his mind wandered to thoughts of Joel he suddenly got a visual in his mind of Joel taking a shower. The boy's face burned with embarressment at the idea of such a thing.  "No... why am I thinking that?"  The bar of soap dropped from Damien's hands. He reached down to pick it up and tried to banish such thoughts of Joel from his mind, having no idea what caused them in the first place.  "What's wrong with me?" Damien whispered to himself as he rubbed his soapy hands over his body, cleansing physically despite his dirty mental state of mind.

       He really is rather childish,  Joel mused to himself when he heard Damien babble on and on about his adventures at the pool which mostly involved playing around with pushing the girls into the pool. He felt no jealousy or possessive nature towards the boy, and why would he? The college student wasn't in love nor did he have any particular strong feelings that would warrant him to be selfish like that. It was true that he liked Damien. He found the boy cute and refreshing to be around. When he had applied for a part time work at Sweet Delight, he could have never known that the little brunette would become his next "project".  And that's exactly what Damien was to Joel; a "project."  As a teenager, Joel discovered how thoroughly he was interested in playing around with people and the control that came along with it. There was something so delightfully splendid about the masquerade that was required in order to convince people of this and that. He would string them along with glorious lies and adapt to press what his current "project"  Occasionally Joel would wonder if, somewhere along the way, he'd eventually loose sight of who he really was since. What a funny notion...  He thought for a moment about the question. His mind could think of several plans of actions he could take.  "Well," Joel begun, "We can order pizza tonight since I'm lazy and don't want to cook."  "As for you, I think you should go take a bath or shower. I'm guessing you didn't wash your hair at the pool?"  Damien nodded.  "You need to get the chlorine out of it," he explained and checked his watch again. "It's closing time, so how you wait for me and then we go up shortly?"  Joel smiled, figuring that Damien would more than likely agree. The boy could be quite accommodating an, in certain ways, Damien looked like he had an innocent crush on the older male. That's what Joel thought anyway.

      Damien noticed Joel's eyes lingering on his body. Perhaps he was looking to see if the boy was sunburned, but Damien knew all he would see is the golden tan he had. This brought a blush to his cheeks, although he was unsure exactly why.  "It was fun. We kept throwing the girls into the deep end and they were screaming for us to stop."  His face lit up as he told of his escapades with his friends and he didn't let Joel's expression bother him in the least. He continued to relay the events of the afternoon in a bubbly tone that only a child could possess. Damien's thoughts were of innocent fun, completely impervious of the older man's unspoken intentions. After several minutes of recounting the day's events, Damien realized that he didn't know what was planned for this evening.  "What are we going to do tonight, Joel?"  Damien was excited that his parents had left him behind instead of dragging him along with them on vacation. They didn't realize how embarrassing it was for a twelve-year-old boy to hang out with his parents during such outings. Even though Joel was babysitting him while the rest of the family was away, Damien felt more independent. He still loved his parents yet he had reached that age where children begin to distance themselves from their family and spend more time with friends and role models. In this particular case, Joel was both. Even though Joel often babied him, Damien felt special since the college student genuinely wanted to spend a lot of time with him.

      Joel easily greeted the boy with kind, deceiving eyes and a very friendly expression. He'd been waiting for this type of situation for months now and just when he was beginning to despair, thinking that he'd never be able to finally be alone with Damien, he lucked out with the boy's parents feeling the need vacation. Proving himself as an upstanding, wholesome college student that truly cared for the Snow family (Damien especially) and their business had been quite a task for Joel. It also required patience on his part since the image he was portraying wasn't true to himself. Despite the charade he was currently taking part in, Joel found out what he was acting was enjoyable. It wasn't necessarily fun to be the nice and caring guy, but there was something appealing about it.  "Welcome back. How did the swimming go?" Joel asked, looking down and quickly shut off the radio after some horrible teeny bopper song had started. When he faced Damien again, Joel let his eyes licentiously roam over the boy's body. The twelve year old's medium brown hair was closer to a coffee color since it was still rather damp and in the process of drying off. It was messy and cutely sticking up in places. Obviously Damien hadn't bothered to do anything with it. A used towel was carelessly wrapped around his neck and currently was the only thing on his upper body. The boy was tanned, but not excessively so. Joel had never cared for the extremes concerning skin complexion. Wet, but not dripping swimming trunks clung to the boy's hips and legs. Damien's feet were in casual flip flops, which enhanced the boyish and easy going look.  Joel was all too aware that if he let his mind wonder, he'd end up getting aroused which may have caused problems. The blonde needed to be careful with how things were going to advance. He expected that some difficulty would result, but not a lot. The last two years the college student had been extremely observant of Damien and was fairly confident that he understood the boy. To assure success, Joel knew it depended on his controlled and thought out actions.

      The warm sun felt good to Damien as he was walking home and it slowly dried his wet body from where he had been swimming with his friends at the public pool.  He knew his parents would have already left by the time he'd arrive home so that's why he'd said his goodbyes before he'd left with his peers earlier.  His damp towel was draped around his shoulders and he carried his nearly empty bottle of sunblock in one hand, which reminded him that he'd have to ask Joel for some money to go get some more.   Joel ... Over time Damien had come to think of him as an older brother, someone to confide his deepest secrets to moreso than his own friends.  There were things in Damien's life that he would have felt embarressed discussing with his parents, but with Joel it seemed easier to talk about what was on his mind.  Lost in thought Damien suddenly found himself in front of Sweet Delight. He could see Joel inside listening to the radio and tapping to the beat. Damien knew it couldn't be Joel's preferred choice of music because the man refrained from listening to such harsh lyrics since there was a young child living there. A smile came to Damien's face as he opened the door and walked inside, causing the bell to jingle overhead and Joel to turn around.

      A sugary smile was on Joel's face as he pleasantly waved goodbye to the couple in the car. His current employers who also let him board with them had decided to leave for a vacation to the Virgin Islands. It was the twenty-one year old's second year working at Sweet Delight-- a lovely little candy store that was quite liked in the neighborhood. Over the time Joel had worked part time (he only worked full time in the summer since he was attending college) he'd demonstrated that he was more than able to handle the affairs for the next few weeks. Besides the responsibilities that came with completely taking care of the business, he was also babysitting their son, Damien, who was twelve.  When the car could no longer be seen, Joel turned around and headed back into the store, a bell ringing when the door opened. Light blue eyes glanced around the shop, making sure that everything was in order. Joel gave a content sigh, pleased that he didn't need to straighten up anything. He was also happy that the store would be closing soon. He strode over behind the counter and turned on the radio, tapping his fingers to the addicting pop beat. The song was sickeningly sweet and on the pathetic side. Joel preferred rock with angry, screamed lyrics, but obviously that wasn't suitable to be playing in this type of environment.  He looked down at his watch, growing a little impatient that he still had around thirty minutes left before he could begin closing up the store.  "Damien should be back soon," Joel commented.  And somehow that realization caused a small grin to form on his place.
