      Chu Records  I'll show you why they call me DaProfessa/ niggas get scared to battle, cuz they know not to test me/ I run up on em, straight killin a verse/ put a gun on em, and send em to the back of the universe/ rep for the 973, the only rapper truly blessed with a curse/ gotta drop rhymes heavily, like if my flow was to burst/ I got weaponry, from a tek to shotty/ and I'll never get ratted out, cuz I'm not trying to end up like Erv Gotti/ dying in jail, money aint a thing I come out on bail/ yall gotta recognize and stop bitin my raps/ cuz half the mc's who bite are whack/ niggas got problem? I'll fight em back/ I'm a big problem solver, big round revolver/ mess with me and I turn a battle into a slaughter/ better take cover/ DaProfessa, one and only, there aint no other/

      Wut up Pimps and Females? Well thinkin bout changing my nickname from Da Professa to Da Scientist cuz dat sounds better and im not copying the And1 guy Da Professa. If anyone is asking why I call myself this. its because I im the Human Beatboxer of Monroe. Hella people think so and thats what I love to do. Can you dig it? Well waiting for tommorrow so i can chill wit Haley haven't talked to her in hella long. Thinkin bout changin the song again for like the 3rd or 4th time shit. Man yesterday was tight. Me and Woody were boxing all day. Then we played hit for hit all over our body besides our face. My sides are hurting hella. Sydney's mad at me and there's nothin I can do bout it. She wont even talk to me or Woody. That shits hella gay, she's like a little sister to me.   Chu Preach, Signing out Da Scientist
