      Hi! I would like to share my opinions about this fantastic thing called- Frontier.. What is it?? My food, annadevatha, my hang out place, my fashion world telling me whats IN, what not.. it occupies an IMPORTANT place in our lives.. not just mine but the lives of desis here..  Frontier is the second place where I had food outside in USA (if Starbucks is not a eatery joint).. the first one being Taj Mahal.. Well whats so fantastic about Frontiers??  This is an amazing restaurant.. specializing in New Mexican food adjusted to American palate.. but just the right kinda flavors for Indian juntaa.. its a boon..its a miracle.. where else can you find belly filling food at the prices of 3-5 bucks (ofcourse 150-250 rupees is the first thing that creeped my mind in those initial days.. but nevermind.. consider desi food at Taj Mahal.. the cheapest one can get is a curry at 10 dollars.. parathas extra.. ok agreed buffet is cheap and filling but timings dont match.. McD sucks.. especially for veggies as they hardly have any veggie (except for Coke and french fries.. even those were under controversy that they have beef extracts.. oops)  But this paradise is open 24 hours a day.. my God.. thats awesome.. when I am returning from my lab.. tired.. I have this ready to serve.. when we have a "hadtaal" at our house and no food to eat.. bingo Frontiers comes to my mind.. and the statistics show that there is always a desi hanging around in Frontiers at any given time, any day.. its that IMPORTANT..  Now the desi juntaa also checks the latest fads.. the latest fashion as gorgeous babes come there flashing the best parts of their bodies.. we desis feed our eyes too alongwith our stomachs.. so you are drunk on a sat'nite and dont know where to go to eat at 3am? there is Frontiers!! andbelieveme.. there is a 40 feet+ line during peak times.. people wait for 15+mins (which is a rare phenomena here in US except for discotheques/strip bars) and desis are so famous here (mebbe me!!) that the counter people know my name.. dont check my ID and also guess my menu (the ubiqutous Bean n cheese burrito and a side of hash browns.. we know the price with taxes too.. it comes to a 2.47!!) and oh yeah.. there is complimentary water.. (anything free.. we desis dont miss.. we hardly invest on soft drinks/juices.. those are for amroos.. we get those from Costco.. and if a desi is buying that.. probably its his first day of pay/assistanship, or he has a date or he is badly drunk.. or its somebodyelse paying for him!!)  People spend hours sitting there like as if its some Irani joint having chaa biscoot.. chking out babes.. seeing wats hot on NBA/CNN (yeah there is a TV too with subtitles..) and oh yeah a special word about the parking.. desis       use this parking for other reasons.. like you come to visit somebody at Harvard (the Hyderabadi adda of Goltees) and there is noplace for parking.. Frontiers.. you wanna park for university.. dontpay for parking in universioty dude.. there is frontiers.. this is such a big craze that Frontiers has invested for a special job for a guy to lookafter to make sure only its customers park their cars and its not misused..  and Frontiers' owners are supposedly stinking rich.. each owning a handful of cars(oh yeah..all that is desi money.. hugh.. whats great? ;-) ) I heard some people were eyeing their daughters (its hard to differenciate rumors from facts here..)..  So thats Frontiers in short (I say short as its time for me to go to Frontiers now.. yeah my daily dose.. am kinda addicted!) and this thing is like a legend.. alumni talk about it when they meet.. before asking how that Prof is or how the bldgs are.. they ask if Frontiers is doing good..  Long Live Frontiers!!  PS: This part is a sponsored article and the author was paid for it (yeah an years supply of food+unlimited salsa!!)
