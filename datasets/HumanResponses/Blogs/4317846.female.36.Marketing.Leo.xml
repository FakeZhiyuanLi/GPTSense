      Whatever you want to call it...it's fun though. Saw some pretty interesting stuff. Especially looking at other peoples thought processes. There really is so much grey matter isn't there? My view on certain issues, and I am working on it, tends to be a bit more polarized. Is it so wrong though to ask for something black or white? Something definitive? I have a particular issue that I need that on. No more "I don't know's" or "I never gave it a chance" I want a "yes lets try it"...or "no it could never be."  I don't know that I will ever get that. It is one of those things that just lays out there in waiting. One site I saw, they talked about how timing was their nemesis. I would have to agree on that one. It seems to be thrown back at me on a constant rotation.   Sometimes it feels as if I am walking in circles and I keep coming back to the same road with a huge boulder blocking the path. I know beyond a doubt I am supposed to go down that way but I just keep trying to blaze a new trail cause it's easier than moving the huge flipping rock by myself.

      The question has been posed to me as to if or why I have/haven't done any community theatre. The first part of that question is an easy one. I haven't done any community theatre to date. It has been on my mind more and more this past year. The second part of that question is where I had to think on it a bit. There are many reasons I could give for why I haven't. But where is the line between an excuse or a justified reason? It is only this past year that I have gotten back to who I am. I know that sounds totally cliche. The whole finding yourself bit. But it is true. I got lost after college. Sort of swept up in the expectations of what I "should" do. Dreams and hopes were not practical or encouraged. I became a wife and mother. And that is what I thought my path was going to be. I almost didn't feel like I was allowed to pursue something that would be fullfilling to me. Not that my daughter wasn't fullfilling. But I am talking about that stuff inside of you that you just love to do. That stuff that brings out your true self. I let a lot of that go when I was younger. I figured there just wasn't time, after all, I had responsibilities. I chalked my hopes and dreams up to silly childhood fantasies. So, here I am...just turned 36 and am now realizing that they weren't silly fantasies. That I can make them a reality, if even in just a small way. So I will be doing community theatre this next season. Well, providing they would have me.

      Ok...So I am sitting here contemplating on whether or not I should change the design of this page...Thinking that this background reminds of the lighting equipment from my theatre days in school. Those were good times I must say. I was part of Play Production and as such, we put on all the performances in our school. Of course, it helped that my best friend William was also the Director. I seemed to get some really good parts. I like to think that they were well deserved and I actually had some talent. We did win some state wide competitions so I couldn't have been all that bad. I think it all started for me, my love for the arts, when I was in middle school. I went to a Theatre and Fine Arts Magnet school, Pacoima Jr High (yes its the one that Richie Valens' plane crashed into), which taught us all the aspects of producing...Art...I guess. I had dance classes, choir, music appreciation, film production and editing, drama, paint and writing. It was an awesome school. I feel fortunate now that I had that experience. I think my favorite then was drama and film production. I even got make my own commercial. I had to produce, film, block and edit it myself. If I remember right I got a good grade on it. I wish I had it now to see. Although, I did continue my theatre training in college, I never pursued it seriously. I had always wanted to be on Broadway though. My name in lights etc... Sometimes dreams are better when they are left as such. Who knows what would have happened. But life has its way of making adjustments to what we think is going to happen or have planned. It's all for good reason...I am sure..besides, there is always community theatre right?

      I thought I would post something that gave some insight to who I am. If you ever read any of my future posts', I may leave you wondering "What the heck was that about!". I do it quite often. I have been learning the art of connecting with people and the discernment of who you can and can't do that with, boundaries or whatever you would choose to label it. It is a tough lesson nevertheless. Especially, when you have become accustomed to believing that honesty is the best policy. Someone once told me, not too long ago, that I was so honest that it was painfully so. Basically, I crossed the line and hurt him. So, it has been my task to find a balance. Somewhere in the middle where I can communicate without shoving it down someones throat. Letting someone know my truth and have it be just that, My truth and nothing more.   There are so many things that touch my life. The most important being my daughter of course. Some others would be...  My music... "All music has something to offer" is what I have always said. My collection has been referred to as ecclectic, weird and interesting. Music moves me. It is what makes me tick and talks to me in ways that reach all the different aspects of me.    My growth... Is a life long journey for me I am realizing. Books have been my best friend this past couple years. I love anything technical or self help/awareness. I am not one for reading fiction, although, it's what I crave to write. Go figure...

      Well, I guess this would be my "first post" as it were. I learned of this site quite some time ago but never actually knew someone that did it until recently. I had tried other mediums in the past for my writing but they lacked the anonymity I suppose. I think I wanted something with a little more freedom of expression versus the constant critiques on what I had written in a gramatical sense. I have a journal that I write in daily, however it is pretty raw stuff. And I mean Raw...Ugly...Ethereal...and Hopeful. Whatever end of the spectrum of emotions one can conjure, is whats there. I sometimes go back to read past thoughts and am puzzled by my own expressions, sometimes frightened by them. I am hoping this will give me some more displine in my writing but with the freedom I crave as well. So until then...
