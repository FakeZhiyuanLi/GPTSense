      Men are the reason all of us are here.I mean yes they made us BUT  us women usually get stuck raising those kids.SO when a man says its the mothers that make a man the way he is well thats a lie.Most women dont know how to raise a man so if the man would take care of his kids the way he should maybe we would have less GAY men and more REAL men.Dont get me wrong not all men are bad but the majority id say 80-20 are.They get the girl pregnant and say "oh i dont want her anymore" then leave her high and dry.Then when she slap child support on his sorry ass he wanna act a fool.Then be gettin jealous when she find a man better than him that wanna take care of his kids.But see me I just want a man to be with me and except my kids.He aint gotta take care of them because they aint his,and they shouldnt call no other man daddy but at the same time why not when they real daddy aint doin shit but hoein around and talkin shit to u about who u with.So men if u want us to raise a strong man get ur asses in the picture and HELP.Of course it takes a man to raise a man and if u aint there for ur kids u aint a man to begin with.ANd by that I mean get a job support ur kids love aint gonna buy diapers and clothes and food.Love aint gonna put a roof over they head.Yall talk shit about a woman being on welfare well if the man was doing his job we wouldnt have to be.       Then u have these sorry ass men that think its fun to put they hands on a woman and they say they love u baby that aint love.Thats  a pussy." I love u thats why I hit you" What the fuck is that.I know all this from experience.Its horrible and degrading to the good men out there.Then while he putting them hands on u he also out there sticking his piece in every woman that he meet bringing u home STDs and shit then try to blame u for giving it to him.HA  thats what i mean - men are no good.No matter what race men are worthless.All they good for is a quick nut and satisfying a womans needs and if u want they there to mate.Thats it then u can raise that baby alone like u gonna be doing anyway.       For the good brothas out there i mean no harm towards u but damn  show these other brothas how to treat a woman!! All well I wont say all, most women are goddesses and we deserve to be treated like queens.There are some scandolous women out there too i know a few myself but thats the ones that deserve the sorry men.What about us that treat our men like kings  we deserve the same in return but most of the time we dont get it.So fellas if yall got a good woman hold onto her and ladies if yall got a good man hold on to him.

      LOVE????? What exactly is the meaning of love?Does anyone really know? I mean it happens and in my eyes almost ALWAYS ends in heartache,pain and misery.Who wants to feel all that.I damn sho dont.But I find myself falling again and again and enduring that pain over and over?WHY?  I ask myself that so many times but it never comes to me?Dont get me wrong it can be good and make u feel incredible and overwhelming happiness but I just wonder where is the man fa me?Is there even one out there?Im sho there is somewhere BUT will I be able to love that man?ANd if I do is he going to cause me just as much pain as the others? I guess the only real answer is just put my heart out there again and give it a shot.ANd for the meaning of love well i still dont have answer for that.

         Why ask why? Good question? In this world today u pretty much have to ask that question WHY? Why is there still prejudice and racism out there.Closed minded people is one of the answers.All the answeres well we might never know.Why does love hurt when its supposed to be good? Just a simple thing that we all go thru and heartbreak unfortunatley follows it most of the time but its life.Why everytime theres a birth we have a death? Who knows that one.Why  ask why?This is just another rough draft.IM practicing guys so be patient with me.
