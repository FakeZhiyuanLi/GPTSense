      I would just like to wish the thousands, no millions of readers who visit my Blog a very special Independence Day. This is coming from a man who misspelled Independence not once but twice on MS Word. God bless America and the genius who created the Spell Check, wherever she may be. Yes, I said it. It was a woman. Who else would take such joy in correcting your every mistake, huh?  Anyways, I am posting this early because my computer at home is dead so all my Blogger entries will be made from the computer at work. And since I have the weekend off, I won't be back online until Monday, July 5th. Hopefully, in the near future I will purchase a new computer but for the time being I am stuck on this historic PC running Windows 95! Woo!  *cue fireworks*

      There are just some songs that never leave your head no matter how much times passes by. This song is particular I heard for the first time about nine years ago. At the time I was in the last few years of my obsession with Hip-Hop/Rap. Up to then and on to about 1997, the genre was full of fresh, original talent. What Hip-Hop has become today is the equivalent to the Bubble Gum Pop that flooded the airwaves in the late 90’s. It’s sad that no one will ever pick up Goodie Mob’s Soul Food album, which I consider to be the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time. But that’s another post at another time.  The name of the song you must listen to before you die is Midnight. The artist? None other than Tracey Morrow, better known as Ice T. Now we know Ice T’s movie career hasn’t exactly been successful...unless your standards are about as low as a Mario Van Peebles fan. But back in his day, Ice T was pumping out Gangta’ tunes like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately, Mr. Morrow decided to sell his soul to Hollywood in exchange for some C-Movie acting gigs.  So please, go download the song "Midnight" by Ice T off whatever illegal program you favor and afterwards check out this urlLink  link  to the lyrics (provided by Ohhla.com). If you enjoy what you hear and read, drop me a line and let me know!  The First In Many More To Come, mc80

      Today we lost a true…hold up. Never mind. Fuck it.  I’m not going to write some bullshit article about a man I hardly knew. All I’m going to say is that I am a diehard movie fan and to this day have only had the pleasure of seeing three Marlon Brando films; On The Waterfront, The Godfather, and Don Juan DeMarco. Two of those three films, which I saw for the first time less than 3 months ago, are now in my top 10 favorites of all time.  From what I have read about Marlon Brando, I know that he was a rebel on screen and in real life. This is the man who actually turned down the Best Actor Academy Award for God sakes! It’s too bad his personal problems plagued him for so long. First his weight balloons, his legendary career stalls, his son murders a man, and finally his daughter commits suicide.  All I can say is that Marlon Brando will continue to live on in the hearts of  any  true movie fan. No, not the overweight, strange man from the last decade…but the Marlon who portrayed the over-the-hill boxer in On The Waterfront, or the one who not just portrayed but became Don Vito Corleone. I truly look forward to seeing the rest of his movie library.  With My Dying Respect, Mc80

      This morning I awoke with about 30 minutes left in my shift. My sole purpose this morning (and every morning) was to avoid running into my boss who was fresh from his two week vacation and busy doing paperwork downstairs. I hadn’t shaved in about 2 weeks (a no-no in the Funeral Industry) and I knew if he saw me, I would be in deep shit. I managed to creep down through the front stairs of the Funeral Home (dark and empty at that time of the day), pick up my plates from the kitchen, grab my time card, punch out and sneak out through the front, undetected. Success! Or so I thought…  After exiting the Funeral Home I began my long drive home. As usual I drove below the speed limit, with my seatbelt on just like my grandmother Ursula would approve of. Why, you ask? Because I have 30 miles to drive, on three separate highways. That wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the expired tag, on the car with no insurance, driven by the man with a suspended license  and  a criminal record. So yeah, once again the stereotype is correct. A Hispanic man with no insurance. What are the odds? Ha. Ha.  Anyways, once I got home and had some breakfast (rice, steak, biscuit) and played about an hour of Fight Night on the Xbox, I decided to take my usual nap of about five hours. Nothing really eventful happened in any of my first few dreams. No hot three-way action. No mc80 Vs. King Kong reoccurring dream that I usually get when I am stressed out. That is nothing interesting until my final dream. In this dream I see myself driving in my beat up, dirty, stinky, 2001 Pontiac Grand Am. I am minutes away from home on the I-75 observing the speed limit when a Florida State Trooper pulls up behind me. It didn’t take long for them to pull me over.  By this time I was sweating bullets. One walks up to my car on the driver side, while the other approaches on the passenger side. When I roll my tinted windows down to greet the officer I find it’s none other than my boss! On the other side, it’s his partner in crime (or the second boss at my work). My dream skips to them looking at my license and then telling me, “This license is suspended- you are under arrest”. The dream then skips again to me physically resisting arrest until I could no longer fight the 2-1 odds. I was dragged into the trooper’s car and hauled off to jail. At that time I was suddenly awakened by the horrible sounds of Lil’ Jon and Ludacris or something. All of the sudden I wished I were back in my nightmare. A lifetime sentence would be more satisfying than having to listen to what’s currently being pumped out by the hip hop industry. But that’s another post at another time.  Anyways, I didn’t think much of my dream until I arrived at work tonight (boss free, thankfully) and spoke to my only good friend at work, Chuck about it. He suggested that my being dragged by my bosses into the car might of been a metaphor for them trying to drag me into their gay lifestyle (which they have never tried to in the first place) and/or me disapproving of their lifestyle (which I don’t). Personally, I think my dream was just a window into my stress, worry, and fear about what I have to go through two times a day, Monday through Saturday. Sure, I wish I could pay for my SR-22 insurance, but it would cost me well over $500 dollars, which I really don’t have at the time. The worst part is the trip to jail, the tickets I would receive, and the fees I would have to pay to ever drive again if I were caught would be easily over $1,000 dollars! So for now, I will continue my fight to avoid my bosses  and  the authorities until the day I die…. or at least until I get fired for not being “well-groomed” and wind up in jail (once again!) for breaking the law.  Wish Me Luck, Mc80

      I said it would never happen. I mean, it seems like everyone and their creepy Uncle has a "Blog" so why would I want to add my name to that list? Well, here I am working on my first ever post and in what will eventually become my trademark style...I have absolutely nothing to say!  Alright, I'm only kidding. I am actually creating this Blog to keep from going insane in this big, lonely,  home . Seeing as I work the graveyard shift at a local South Florida funeral home, I figure I might have some interesting tales to post about.  In between the gory tales of death, I will also be adding movie and music reviews as well as something every single Blog on the planet has...PICTURES!  Brace Yourself, mc80

      Ok, so thousands if not millions have heard Eric Clapton’s Layla, right? It has been on albums that have gone infinity platinum ten times over, I know. But how many of you know the true story behind this great, bittersweet love song?  According to the official Eric Clapton FAQ, this is the full story on Layla:   Clapton wrote "Layla" in 1970 for Patti Boyd Harrison ( urlLink don't blame him ). He had fallen in love with her although she was married to his best friend, George Harrison. In the song, Clapton was trying to tell a romantic story about what was actually happening in his love life at that time.   “As a song just in itself I don’t think it’s got much going for it to be honest with you. I mean there’s a structure and there is a melody, but historically where it’s at in the scheme of things, at the end of the '60s with the kind of bands that were coming into being, with the way that music was changing, and with the historic little bit of life history, you know with me and George and Patti, that it’s got a life of its own.”(From a 1998 BBC interview)   So imagine being in love with your best friend’s wife. To me, this has happened not on just one occasion and it ended up in not only losing my friend, but my girlfriend as well. The lyrics in Layla are as significant today as they were when they were written. It is one of those rare occasions when a song is narrating my life (and maybe even yours) exactly as it is, did, or will happen. Another one of those songs would be “You Know You’re Right” by Nirvana. But that’s another post at another time.  So rev up your Peer-To-Peer programs and good luck finding any version of this song. It took me 32 different downloads of Layla to find a working version. If you can’t find one, don’t give up. Head over to Best Buy or whatever place you get your music and pick up The Cream Of Clapton, or any other cd that carries that song. Hmm, The Cream Of Clapton...sounds so dirty.  Sadly Reminiscent, Mc80

      Everybody has one. The one guy at work who’s just not right. Maybe he’s always staring at the female co-workers (for long, uncomfortable moments at a time). Perhaps he’s the type that has long, meaningful conversations…with himself! Or maybe he just takes abuse all day long from his boss and fellow co-workers until the moment he explodes. Yes, I have a crazy co-worker and his name is Michael.  Michael is a 49 year old former “assistant” to the stars. He drove his “classic” Corvette no one has ever seen all the way from Hollywood to Florida and now currently works the worst job at the funeral home, Support Staff. Basically, that’s a nice word for janitor/procession guy/ pee-on.  No one has ever seen his classic ride, his beautiful home in an expensive South Florida suburb, his 21 year old stay at home wife, or witnessed any of his so-called Hollywood connections. But I have personally worked at that shithole position with him for a year (until I got transferred/ promoted) and let me tell you something…he scares the shit out of me.  Here are just some of the offences I have heard about or witnessed:  1. While most funeral staff wash their vehicles once or twice a week he usually washes them up to three times a day! And sometimes they weren’t even used. A couple of times the man actually fainted in the hot Florida sun because of it. Another time he ended up in a hospital for repeated bee stings. All that for just $7.25 an hour. Scary.  2. He constantly snoops in on conversations between his boss/ funeral director, families of deceased, secretaries, and other support staff. He was on two different occasions seen looking through garbage cans for papers. Another time he was found to be in the funeral home by himself with no supervision on his day off. Needless to say, the security code was changed and he was never given access to it. So when he starts his shift at 7:30 AM, he has to wait in his classic Ford Focus or in the blazing sun until his boss arrives to open the doors at 8:15 AM. Classic stuff because this guy is an Albino who turns bright red, almost see-through if you’re chandelier bulbs are more than 25 Watts.  3. He is a married man with two kids, one from a previous marriage where his original wife died of Cancer, or so he tells us…constantly. He once met a secretary of another funeral home and introduced himself by saying, “You look just like my first wife, who is dead”. Seriously.  4. He actually tried to have an affair with the woman I was having an affair with! That dirty motherfucker cornered my ex (who worked part-time at my job) and talked her ear off for over 45 minutes. Jen was terrified because she was completely alone with him. She ended up giving him her number for fun and boy did that turn out to be a mistake.  5. During their three conversations, Michael told Jen that he hates his first child (5 year old girl) and doesn’t pay any attention to her because her mother is dead! Sick fuck. He also tried to get Jen to meet him for sex. At first, I was jealous and ready to meet this man instead of Jen for some old school ass whooping but the sad fact is that this man makes Larry King look like Orlando Bloom (or whoever the girls think is the shit right now).  6. He once mumbled to himself that he was going to “get everyone” for all the shit they have done to him…after his boss ate his shit up for fucking up a funeral. The man was about ready to cry. Thankfully, this was almost two years ago and he never kept his promise.  7. Another time while on a night visitation/wake, he ate his boss’s large pizza (about 7 slices) and blamed it on the secretary. He has recently stolen a 17 year-old co-workers brand new suit. He has already been written up 7 times just in the year that I worked with him (I don’t know what it’s up to now) so they obviously can’t fire him. This company has hired drugged out stoners, perverted weirdos, and even re-hired one girl who sued the company years back for sexual harassment and won. Shortly after she was paid, she quit. Now she’s back and sluttier than ever. Not even mc80 will stick it in that for fear it might rot and fall off.  Well, this latest incident was the last straw for his boss. He has transferred him out of there and into  MY   location. I wouldn’t be scared if it weren’t for the fact that I have passed along the Michael legends to every single employee here. Sometimes as a warning, others just for a quick laugh. Like for example, the time he was putting up the Christmas tree decorations and his pants ripped (about 10 inches) right from one check to the other. It wouldn’t have been so bad if not for the people there; his boss, the boss’s secretary, other support staff (many well into their 80’s) and his bosses’s mother who is 94 years old and now passed on.  I know what you’re thinking…so they saw his underwear, big fucking deal. Well, this time he happened to be wearing  NO  underwear and gave plain view of his red, hairy ass and nuts (he was on a ladder, remember) to everyone there. What a sight! Now I will be checking my back for this soon to be mass-murderer. I work all alone in the night shift. It’s bad enough there are on average 30 bodies on tables and in the cooler each night…now I have to fear Crazy Mikey around every corner of the funeral home.  Scared to death, mc80

      Let me give you a short glimpse into the nine months of hell that began July 13th of 2002 and ended March 30th, 2003. I met Jennifer through a mutual friend. Right away there was a strong sexual attraction but as I was told from the beginning she was “involved”. Basically, she had been with her boyfriend for 5 ½ years! The amazing thing was that she was only 21. That to me is shocking, seeing as my longest relationship before Jen lasted all of a month. Pathetic, I know.  From the beginning I showed no interest whatsoever. I ignored her for what seemed like 3 weeks straight which apparently sent her confidence spiralling downwards. She told me later, that the only reason she pursued me so hard was because I was not “into her”. Boy, would that change in a flash.  I can’t say no to a beautiful woman forever and after a few more days she finally clung on to me for good. We began our friendship by exchanging e-mails. What I noticed right away from her letters was that this woman was depressed like no one I have ever met. It appears that her boyfriend Allen physically and emotionally abused her, as well as neglected her. She in return bought him a car ($9,000 in cash), took him out to dinner and movies, paid for everything he owned, etc. In her letters she kept including her phone number and finally one day I called and the rest was history.  After about 2 weeks of talking (over 600 minutes on my cell phone), I get a call at about 11:45 PM one work night. It was Jen calling from her former bosses’ house where she happened to be dog sitting. She asked if I could please come over and immediately my head began to salivate (nope, not the one on my neck). I rushed over there and in a matter of minutes of arrival, we were having sex. That was July 13th.  The next morning I left for work, got pulled over by a cop for swerving in and out of traffic (not enough sleep, I suppose) and got a ticket. At lunchtime I purchased a dozen roses in a glass jar and drove over to her ex-bosses house. I knocked on the door and two men answered. I could hear Jen in the background laughing and giggling. I didn’t know it then but she later admitted to a “friend” that she was screwing one of them that very same afternoon. What a fool I was.  As time went by, our relationship became stronger and we soon were seeing each other every single day. We were practically married at that point. That was when I began to fall in love with her despite all the drama. If she was going out and I asked her where…I was controlling. If I didn’t want her to talk to her hurtful boyfriend…I was manipulative. If I wanted to spend time with her…I was possessive. This went on for 9 months.  It got to a point where all she wanted from me was sex. Perhaps this would have worked if it weren’t for the fact that I was a lovesick puppy at her control. By the time she broke up with Allen, her and I were only seeing each other once a week or less. When she told me about it, I almost celebrated out loud. Here was our chance to finally have a real relationship. Maybe we could even get married someday. Yeah, fat chance.  What she ended up doing was having a one-night stand with a police officer. I would have been able to walk away if it weren’t for the fact she told every single person she knew. All of the sudden, I was getting asked questions by everyone imaginable. This was truly hell.  Well, after her and the pig were through we begun seeing each other again, but it only lasted 2 weeks. One night she came over to the apartment we got together (she also lived with her father) and told me she was not ready to throw the 5 ½ year relationship with Allen away just yet. She gave me a kiss and hug and left me alone. I never saw or heard from her again. That was March 30th.  To say I suffered from her being gone would be an understatement. I sat at home every single day and drank nothing but Absolut for 3 months. Then I moved on to light-drugs. And finally found my weapon of choice; food. Since that day, I have gone from a healthy 185 Lbs. To 250. I ended up losing the apartment and nearly got fired from work for not showing up repeatedly. I also ran out of money and had to constantly park my car away from home in order to keep it from getting repossessed. Over a year has gone by and I have finally gotten over her but not after I found out a “friend” of mine had sex with her shortly after we split.  For the first time in my life, I was the nice guy. The one who cared, caressed, and listened and it was the reason I ended up in a downward spiral of depression. I still wonder what ever happened to Jen. She’s probably out somewhere in South Florida stringing along another poor sucker as I type this. I just hope he handles things better than I did.  Regretfully, Mc80

      First of all, we can now be found at www.mc80vstheman.com! Don’t ask where the name comes from because it just sort of came to me on a whim.  But seeing as my partner in Internet crime, Tweeq, also has a blog I guess we’ll call him “the man”. You can find a link to his blog at the top right hand side of Social Decline along with my Amazon Listmania Top Ten Lists. There is a movie, music, and TV show section. I am in no way affiliated with Amazon.com so if you do decide to purchase something from the SC Top Ten, I recommend Best Buy. What you lose in service you make up in price. It’s my home away from home away from home.  The Top Ten Movies  This is my current top ten favorite movies. If number one and two seem a bit peculiar (sympathy vote for Marlon Brando?), I should let you know I created this list about 3 weeks ago. This list contains only movies I own on DVD, so when The Passion Of The Christ comes out, Marlon….beware!  The Top Ten Albums  This list is not a Top Ten favorites of all-time but more of a current Top Ten of what’s getting played in my car. Expect this list to change very often.  The Top Ten TV Shows  This is my current Top Ten TV shows, with the exception of a few shows not available on DVD like Mad TV Seasons 1 and 2 which are the only good seasons of that show. This is the most reliable of Top Ten countdowns. For example, Newsradio has been the number one show for over half a decade now.  New Crucial Web Surfing Link added  On the bottom right hand of the page you will see a few links to websites you must check out no matter what. These are, IMO the best websites on the Internet. Ever get into an argument about who wrote a song? Paul or John? Go to All Music and find out. Ever see some corny TV movie that only stood out because of the hot girl in the shower scene? Surf over to IMDB and she will be listed along with a career guide and bio as well as a hundred other perverts talking about the size and color of her nipples on the message boards. Make sure to also check out Netflix, Game FAQs, and Video Game Museum if you’re into a movie rental alternative that puts Blockbuster to shame, as well as video game walkthroughs, and pictures of classic games and consoles.  Today’s new link comes from Superiorpics.com, a celebrity photo site. I’m not sure if they are a pay site or not because their official forums gives everything away for free. You don’t even have to register! Just check the forums, organized by alphabetical letters for your favorite FEMALE celebrity.  Enjoy, mc80

      I believe the first step is to admit you have a problem, right? Well, in that case…I have an addiction. I have had this ‘problem’ for about three years now. I am not proud of it. I have tried desperately to quit. I have even sought treatment for my dependence in the past, but nothing has worked. So maybe this blog of mine will help me clean out this filthy skeleton from my closet.  &nbsp;  Fellow readers of Social Decline, I, mc80 am addicted to shopping. There I said it! I know it’s not quite as socially accepted as heroin abuse but it’s something, right? Anyways, I’ve already been on several drugs and I walked away many, many years ago. Those habits never cost me the amounts of money I spend on a normal paycheck.  &nbsp;  Just to give you an example of my addiction: as many of you know, I work the graveyard shift at a funeral home, right? My job is to pick up the dead from hospitals, nursing homes, and even their residents. I have absolutely no other duties (if you got to see what I see, you would know why). So when there are no death calls, like for example right now…I actually have a dormitory with a bed and cable TV. So I could be sleeping right now (or whacking off to soft core porn), but here I am with Microsoft word typing this message, and a browser open to my Bank Of America account waiting for the exact moment my direct deposit is, well deposited. I could be sleeping right now but instead I want to sit up and wait to see how much I made because I have some serious shopping to do when I get off work in six hours. It’s currently 2:00 AM.  &nbsp;  How about yesterday when I was up at 4:00 AM having multiple orgasms to a Shop At Home Network broadcast. The annoyingly loud host was showing just how great their 3.0 GHZ, 80 GB, 512 MB, DVD-RW, CD-RW is. It was truly amazing and had me yelling about just how badly I want one. After the taping was done I ran downstairs and began my search for a notebook pc. I spent the next four hours browsing the websites&nbsp;of Best Buy, Circuit City, Comp USA, Office Depot, Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart, Target, K-Mart (who knew they had computers?), and Costco. I ended up printing about 100 + pages of each PC in my price range and took it upstairs to read. I should have been sleeping at the time.  &nbsp;  By the afternoon, I came to the conclusion that the notebook I wanted was about $1,500 dollars out of my price range of about $1,200 that I have to spend. So instead of rejoicing in the money I had saved by not buying a notebook, I am now in the middle of choosing between a Playstation 2 (I already own two Xbox’s!!!), a digital DVD Camcorder, a Nokia picture/video phone, a digital camera, or…well, I don’t know, maybe a DVD shopping spree.  &nbsp;  This all started three years ago while I was trying to woo my then sweetheart of a co-worker. I took her out to eat at the most expensive restaurants, bought a new outfit before every single date (clothes that don’t even fit me anymore), and spent a small fortune on a cell phone, which became technically obsolete within six months!&nbsp;   In a perfect world, Anne would still be here today. She would have realized despite my small vices, I was the right choice, not that grease ball, abusive scumbag she is with now. And on our dates I would take her out to Yesterday’s By The Inter-Coastal in my brand new clothes. On the way there we could fool around&nbsp;with my Digital Camcorder that records on DVD, and take pictures of ourselves on my $500 Nokia phone with only one phonebook listing…hers.  &nbsp;  As I begin to close this new blog post, my Bank Of America account is still in the negatives by about $52 dollars, thanks to Netflix.com but in a few minutes/hours (doesn’t matter because I will be waiting), I will know just how much I will be able to spend Saturday morning at Best Buy. It doesn’t matter that I am driving around with no car insurance, expired tag, and bald tires. It doesn’t matter that I am two-months late on my car payment. It doesn’t even matter that my Florida Light And Power bill is due today, because I can extend the due date till my next payday on July 30th. None of that really matters because if this purchase I make today can somehow give me an hour or two of enjoyment this weekend and help me forget just how meaningless and empty my life has become, then it is money well spent. &nbsp; Feeling&nbsp;Melancholy,  -mc80

      I never thought I would be asking myself this question. In my Jr. High and High School days I put every single Nerd in school through hell. Sometimes it was verbal but most times it was physical. I guess I was just another angry teenager taking my frustrations out on the weaker kids. You see, back then there was no Linkin Park to help us kids with our angst.  I was definitely not in the “cool” crowd. I also wasn’t a “Jock” or an “Outsider”. I would describe myself as a “Nomad”. To sum it up, I was basically the creepy guy who sat in the back that spoke to no one. As soon as you fell asleep (as most kids did in H.S), or when a movie would be played and the lights went out…I was digging in your backpack or purse for anything of value. Ok, Nomad is putting it nicely. I was a thief.  I stole everything from beepers (cell phones were a luxury in 95-98), those $40 dollar calculators for Algebra, music CDs, money (preferably bills, but I wasn’t picky), jewellery, etc. Basically, anything I could sell, I would take. And what I would do is sell these items during and prior to lunchtime. The money I would get daily, usually less than $20 dollars would be used to buy me and my other friends lunch.  It’s hard to find any good in what I did, although some might call me an entrepreneur. You see…there were always these kids (from the trailer parks) who couldn’t afford the mandatory calculators for algebra class, right? Well, I always sold them for $5 dollars, so it was sort of like stealing from the rich and giving to the poor (with a minimal profit for mc80). Ok, let’s face it…I was a dirt bag. You don’t have to spell it out for me. But I was also a kid and believe me, what went around, came around.  So let’s fast forward past the arrest, expulsion from school, loss of girlfriend, loss of vehicle, four year battle with depression and onto the mc80 of today (that other stuff in another article, for another time). Today, we see mc80 on a machine he would have never touched back in the 90's, a “computer”. He spends a good two or three hours a day on the Xbox “gaming system”, and even post on message boards about the 80’s TV show, “Transformers”.  So am I officially a nerd? How can that be? Is it nerdy to sit all day and play Grand Theft Auto? Or to post about how Optimus Prime’s best incarnation was as a gorilla in Beast Wars? In that case, I admit it…I am a Nerd. Shoot me already. But how do you explain the baseball leagues I play in and the boxing I do in my spare time? Most nerds from the Transformers message board I post at are unemployed (or work at Anime shops). They either live with their parents or…wait a minute, that’s the only option there. And they don’t see the sun for days at a time. That is definitely not me. I have been at the same job for almost three years; I live on my own in a two-bedroom apartment (use to live with Jen), and spend several hours attempting to get back in shape.  So there is my dilemma. Am I a nerd, jock, nomad, or…what?  Confused, mc80

      That was quick, wasn’t it? After just a couple of weeks and ten miserable posts I am now stuck with writer’s block. It’s really sad that when I’m out living my life, watching a movie, working, or just hanging out, that there is constantly that little voice inside my head giving me suggestions for my next post.  The truth is that I am not having a case of writer’s block it’s just that the only time I can post is at work, and occasionally people die and I have actual work to do. The first couple of weeks of Social Decline I was blessed with almost no stiffs. Unfortunately, this is Florida and people die in bunches. So here I am with maybe five hours of sleep in the last 48 hours bravely trying to type something up. My fingers are numb and I can barely concentrate.  But if you are the one, maybe two people who frequent this place you will notice a huge makeover. Social Decline has transformed from the plain, black Blogger layout to something much cooler (not really). I have added much more content to the sidebar like the Social Decline network, which consist of former members of the legendary (not really) Project X message board. So far there are only three members but I expect a few more to be added within a few weeks. I have also added more and more useful links to the Crucial Surfing list, not to mention a direct look into the mind of mc80! That’s right, just to the bottom right you will see some of the images that buzz through my head on a normal day. After a couple of weeks you will see them much less often as I plan add a Java Script which will rotate them every time you hit REFRESH on your browser.  Hopefully, this weekend I will make my official return to the Internet when I purchase a brand new Sony VAIO computer. That is, if everything goes well from today through Thursday. Seeing as I am a criminal, there is always that chance I could end up in jail and have to use my computer money for bond. Fuck the police! I’ll keep you updated. But one thing is certain, if I do get my computer that means great things for this blog like more private post. Remember, I can only type so much on this computer for fear it is scanned by my company but on my own PC, I will be free as a bird.  Now…as far as writer’s blog, I could always make a Top Ten list or discuss how much a movie or album sucked and hey, there is always Michael Moore, right? But that’s a bit low for me. Instead, I could post about the sickest dream I have ever had in my entire life, which just so happens to have occurred this evening.  This dream was about something that happened between me and a former co-worker of mine named Anne (who was three months into her marriage at the time). One week we ended up having the same days off from work and she begged me to take her to the beach because her husband Jose never took her anywhere. By the way, Jose was also my co-worker but he was a dick. Anyways, at the same time Jose is headed for work, I am on my way to Anne’s house. How these two ever hooked up in a mystery to me and the rest of the company. Jose looks like the guy that mows your lawn every morning and Anne is the spitting image of Marylyn Monroe (and racist) but WAY before she was famous. She looks more like plain and frumpy Norma Jean. But she is still perhaps the sexiest woman I have ever met in my life (and I have known much prettier women). Anyways, I go pick up this girl to take her to the beach and knock on her husband’s mother’s door (yup, he lives with his rich mother) and she opens the door with her 2-piece bathing suit on. Remember, she works at the funeral home with me so I’m use to seeing her with a big, dark suit and sometimes a white business shirt…so I was shocked at just what a hot body this woman has, especially at 34 years of age.  She grabs my hand and pulls me inside and says that she changed her mind about going to the beach. Instead, we should just lie out in the backyard (with swimming pool and all!). So as you can imagine, I lived out one of my biggest fantasies…I got to spread suntan lotion on her (she had a nice tattoo of an angel with the Jose’s name on her chest). One thing led to another and we made our way into the living room where we were trying to talk our way out of having sex. I know it sounds like a cop-out but this girl has four children and this guy took them all in. I didn’t want her to be kicked out and have her running to me. The day wasn’t a total waste, though. While she was on top of me on her couch she gave me the best fellatio of my entire life. It was unbelievable!  So this is where my dream picks up. I am lying back on the couch and Anne begins to softly kiss my penis. After a few pecks she begins to use her tongue, I lean my head back momentarily and notice the expensive chandelier dangling above me and when I look at Anne again my manhood has turned a nasty green color and is completely wrinkled (and only about half erect). In real life the room was as bright as could be because all the sliding doors were still open from us being out back in the morning Florida sun. But in this dream the room was almost completely black. As I look closer to see Anne’s face I notice to my horror that I am no longer receiving a blow job from Anne but instead from Jonathan Davis, Korn’s disgusting lead singer!!!     Needless to say, my horribly wrinkled and green penis went dead and within seconds began to really hurt. Christ, if that’s not a metaphor for something, I don’t know what is. Is it guilt? I’m not sure because next thing I know I was awakened by the pain of my dog’s claws making their way into my face. What a day this is going to be.  Swears He's Not Gay, mc80

      I have become my idol. I am Marlon Brando! Well, minus the talent, good looks, money, women, etc. You see, at one point Brando was on top of the world. He had it all. Money, women, and fame. For some reason only he knows, he decided to walk away from it all. He became a lonely, obese, and senile old man. He stayed that way until his death just a few weeks ago. What a sad way to go.  Today, I weighed in at 255 Lbs. On March 30th, of 2003 (or 16 months ago) I was 185 Lbs. That was the day that I lost my woman. It was that day that I began to live dangerously. At first I began to drink heavily but that didn’t really suit me, nor did the drugs. I had an image to keep up for my family and I didn’t want to go through the same things I went through when I was 14. So right away I knew that overeating was the way to go. Hey, it’s the most accepted of the addictions. If some guy is drunk or high on drugs, people will quickly intervene. But what about that guy who gains 5, 6, and 10 pounds a week? Nothing but a little joke once in a while like, “hey buddy, did you forget to hit the gym this week”?  So little by little I packed on 70 Lbs.! All the while I kept telling myself that it's depression over Anne leaving me. And up till last week I actually believed that garbage. It wasn’t till a few days ago that I had a revelation. I have been over Anne for almost a fucking year now. She destroyed my heart and then slept with a supposed friend of mine. I got over that slut a long time ago. So why is it that I am still so overweight? The answer is simple; STRESS!  It’s not the loss of trim that’s getting me down. It’s the idea of filing for bankruptcy. Or being sent to jail for a suspended license. Or not being able to pay my bills. The list goes on and on, except it’s not quite a list.  What happened to that kid in high school who weighed 165 Lbs.? The mean-looking boy who attracted all the hot, innocent white girls? The little badass who put fear into the hearts of all the redneck, trailer park trash kids at his school? Where has he gone? What killed his spirit? Who took away his youth? All it took was a few lousy relationships, a couple of horribly depressing jobs, and ol’ mc80 broke down.  Maybe it was the jobs that I took over the years like stock boy, maintenance man, funeral home attendant. All these jobs were filled with 30 and 40 year old men whose lives were 100% disappointment. My fear to become one of them took over my life. I settled for less and simply gave up the fight. “The Man” beat me to a bloody pulp. I never stood a chance after&nbsp;the age of sixteen.  So here I am, 26 years old. I am a few months away from a future. In August, a new semester rolls around at Miami International University of Art And Design. I have a spot reserved for me in the Film department. The question now is will I make it till then? Will I have the courage to get back into the fight after another embarrassing defeat? Only time will tell. But for now, my main goal is to shed a few pounds, ASAP. Mc80 can’t be going to no damn university of fine white women with a huge belly hanging out. Shit no. Time to hit the gym once more.  Waiting For August To Roll Around, -Mc80

      I really shouldn’t be doing this. I am oh, so proud of my 509.26 words per post I am averaging since I created this Blog and I know this new post, the first in a week will bring that count down.   You knew that sooner or later this would happen. It all hit me at once. Writer’s block, busy work schedule, sleepiness, laziness, stress, etc. As you may or may not know, I only post when I am at work because I don’t have a PC at home. The first few weeks of Social Decline were great because it was very slow at my job. But as of late we have been getting one death call after another, which meant any time not on call was a great time to get some rest or sleep. It took some time before I could write a post again, and by that time I just didn’t feel like it. It’s not that I don’t enjoy blogging, just that I had become quite lazy for going online at all. And not to mention my company cleaned off this computer (removed programs, Spyware, etc.) and made it clear that we are being watched at all times. So that, along with writer’s block makes it a bit difficult to open up about my problems, fears, uh, legal problems, and whatever else is on my dirty, little mind.   I expected to purchase a laptop last week with my paycheck, but unfortunately my pay was much less than I expected and the notebooks I saw for sale at Bestbuy.com were falsely advertised. I tried to purchase one of those fancy video/camera phones and was asked to deposit $500 dollars because my former cell phone company had not been paid off yet. The phone I was looking at was $400, so paying such a huge security deposit would have been sick. As I was walking out of the store I accidentally went by the camcorder section and ended up buying a JVC camcorder for $500, plus $129 for a 3-year warranty. What’s really bad about this purchase is that I am a complete shut-in with no real friends, so I have no use for a camcorder at all.   So anyways, the writer’s block and laziness are gone. I will have my next real post by tomorrow at the latest. In the meantime, go look at porn or something. I hear Cameron Diaz has a dirty, little tape being passed around online. Me, I’ll stick with the beautiful Carmen Luvana (google her).   Still Stressing, -mc80

      Dear Landlord,  I’m sorry for being late on my rent this month. I suppose a $60 dollar late fee is fair.  Here For Your Anal Pleasure, -mc80 ______________________________________________________  Dear Company Who Financed My Vehicle,  I’m sorry for yet another late payment. Could you please give me another extension? Just add yet another month to my already 62-month contract. Sorry for the horrible inconvenience of paying your 19% financing fee.  Ready To Eat Your Load, -mc80 ______________________________________________________&nbsp;  Dear Mother,  I’m sorry for not paying back that SR-22 insurance down payment of $700 dollars. I promise to stop by your house once a week to help run some errands for you. I know between picking up the nut hair from the bathroom and cleaning up your dog’s hardasarockshitbecausenooneeverpicksupafterhim shit…that I will find plenty of odd jobs to keep busy.  Your Loving Son, -mc80 ______________________________________________________  It sucks being a slave. I mean, here I am working 60, 70, and even 80 hours a week only to have over $300 dollars of my hard earned cash taken away after taxes each pay period. That’s it…I’m moving to Canada! Who cares if all their women are really men in disguise!  I barely make $2,000 dollars a month (gross!) and after my long list of bills, I have almost nothing left. This makes me wonder…just what is better? Living at home with mom, with no job, spending all day on the Internet? Or living on my own, barely surviving and eating leftover McDonald’s day in and day out?  Here are my bills, separated by my two paychecks I receive every month;  Paycheck 1  Netflix (DVD rental) - $36 Florida Power And Light (electric) - $85 (average) Advanced Cable Communication (cable TV) - $62 (with HBO) Triad Financial (my shitty car) - $351  Paycheck 2  Rent (shared apartment) - $600 Florida No-Fault (car insurance) - $183 ( urlLink SR-22 ) Sister’s Allowance - $200 (I gladly pay this) Advanced Cable Communications (fast-access internet) - $56  Total Spent Each Month $1,573!  That doesn’t even count the gas for my car (average gas price is $2.03 per gallon). It’s times like these wished I were unemployed and living in my mom’s basement like EVERY single Anime geek.  What’s the point of this article? Anime sucks. Word.  Ha-Ha, -mc80

      Have you ever wondered just what happens when you die? Does your life truly flash before your eyes like so many people believe? And what if music played a big part in your better days? Does that mean there will be music in the background?  Working at a funeral home for 2 ½ years has taken a toll on my imagination. I now spend just about every day wondering about my own impending doom. Just what does death feel like? Why is it so many people die on the toilet (those are the worst pick-ups)? Does death feel like having to take a dump? Who knows!  I am not a religious man, nor am I an Atheist. I hope that when I die, there is a Heaven. It sure would be nice. But what if not worshipping a “God” gets me sent to hell? Oh well, only time will tell, right? I mean, c’mon! I went to see The Passion Of The Christ on opening weekend! That MUST mean a one-way ticket to Heaven.  Death, if you are reading this…please don’t take me for at least another 20 years. Old age is a bitch that I don’t want to meet. Take me at 50. And when you do take me, make sure these songs are playing during the movie of my life.  Track 1- When I Grow Up (To Be A Man) – The Beach Boys  Track 2- Forever Young – Rod Stewart  Track 3- Don’t Worry Baby – The Beach Boys  Track 4- Creep – Radiohead  Track 5- Papa’z Song – 2pac  Track 6- Thought Process – Goodie MOB  Track 7- Suicidal Thoughts – Notorious BIG  Track 8- Under Pressure – Queen, David Bowie  Track 9- Solitary Man – Neil Diamond  Track 10- You Know You’re Right – Nirvana  Track 11- Vermillion Part Two – Slipknot  Track 12- Til’ I Die – The Beach Boys  Track 13- Hurt – Johnny Cash  Track 14- Jealous Guy – John Lennon  Track 15- Careless Whisper – Wham  Track 16- Cure My Tragedy- Cold  *Bonus Track*- Numb – U2  So there you have it. Now&nbsp;fire up&nbsp;whatever you use to get your music online and find these&nbsp;songs. While you're downloading, post a reply of what your soundtrack would be.  Feelin' Better, -mc80

      Ok, I can sit here and type out my top five movies of all-time and call it an article but that would be too easy. Besides, who’s to say you have the same perverted taste as me? Instead, I will type out an article about five movies which I thought would completely suck but turned out to be very entertaining and great films (within their own genre). I highly recommend renting or purchasing at least three of these films on a rainy and/or lonely day.   This list in not in any particular order:    5. Last Action Hero (1993)        From what I remember, this movie did very poorly at the US box office. I was one of the few in the theatre way back in 1993 (I was sick of Jurassic Park) and will honestly tell you I did not particularly like it back then (but I was only 13!). Last week while shopping at Wal-Mart (it was 7 AM and everything else was closed- DON’T JUDGE ME!&nbsp;:( ) I noticed this film in the $5 dollar bin. It has been the best $5 dollars I have ever spent on a film. It’s cheesy, over the top, and under produced but that’s what the director intended! It’s a parody of films like Terminator and other crazy action movies. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by the same man who made the original Die Hard (action classic!).    Last Action Hero Memorable Quote:    Danny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you? Jack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger.  Danny Madigan: Schwarzenegger!       4. Raising Victor Vargas (2002)            Maybe it’s the spic in me (we spics can use that word- whitey can’t!). Maybe it was the fact that I can relate to “Victor” a lot. Or maybe it was the damn cute “Juicy Judy” that did it for me but this is one of the sweetest, most sincere ghetto romance flicks I’ve ever seen (granted I’ve never watched any others). I expect that the star’s main actor, Victor Rasuk&nbsp;will get huge recognition after his next film opens, which happens to star Orlando Bloom. The one good thing about this is that Vic would kick Bloom’s girly man ass to the curb. Word.    Raising Victor Vargas Memorable Quote:     Judy: Okay, you're my new man... but I'm warning you, don't fuck with me!      3. Memento (2000)        I usually don’t buy into online movie hype. After all, who hasn’t been to a message board in the last few years only to see 20+ topics by Newbs on how great Fight Club and Requiem For A Dream was. It gets old. Memento had a lot of online hype when it arrived in my mailbox (thanks to Netflix) last week. Shit, by the time I had viewed all my other Netflix movies I almost returned Memento without even opening it! Big mistake. Please, check this movie out. I don’t want to give anything away.    Memento Memorable Quote:     Natalie: What's the last thing that you do remember?    Leonard Shelby: My wife...    Natalie: That's sweet.    Leonard Shelby: ...dying.&nbsp;      2. The Passion Of The Christ   (2003)        There are two reasons why I enjoyed this film. First off, I am not an Atheist. Second, I am not Catholic. I am not into religion but the story and controversy that the media used as bait…worked. This might be the most beautiful film I have ever seen not to mention the most violent. I will be first in line when this comes out on DVD, and I don’t even have a Jesus Fish on my car!    The Passion Of The Christ Memorable Quote:     Judas: Take back this silver. I have betrayed innocent blood. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Reservoir Dogs (1992)        What else can be said about the most overrated director of all-time? Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino’s first film as a director and he never again matched the brilliance of this movie. If you’ve only seen this movie, and then watch Kill Bill (his latest), you will be disgusted at just what has become of this director (last seen on American Idol!?!). So give this a try and then maybe Pulp Fiction but stay away from Jackie Brown and Kill Bill for your own good.    Reservoir Dogs Memorable Quote:     Mr. Brown: O.K., let me tell you what Like a Virgin's about. It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine, I'm talking morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick. &nbsp;

      Now I’m scared. The last two days have been kind of weird for me. I’ve been having very peculiar heart palpitations (irregular heartbeat?). For example, today I got home at about 9 AM from work. I had a large hamburger with about five Chips Ahoy chocolate cookies. I then sat down and watched some television, and later played about 30 minutes of Xbox. I did no exercise whatsoever. After a while I began to get sleepy so I decided it was time for my afternoon nap, which I always take before going into work at 7:30 PM.  When I laid down, I felt my heart beating very rapidly, like if I had just had a serious workout. Except, I had not done anything more than eat and watch TV. This went on for about two hours. I could not sleep at all because it began to worry me (just a bit). Could this be normal or is it a sign of future heart problems? I’m only 24 for God sakes! I have a 47 year old co-worker who weighs in over 400 Lbs and he’s doing fine. I would at least like to live until I am 40.  Well, I have a co-worker named Jeremy who has some kind of sick fetish for pain. He has asked me several times to kick his ass (hope it’s not a gay thing) and I have finally taken him up on his offer. I will be filming it on my camcorder so hopefully I can take some screencaps and post them here. This should be a decent workout in the meantime.  Just so you know, I really appreciate the comments on my previous post. I hope you all know they were really helpful. I can’t wait to get back into shape. My next post, which I hope to finish tonight won’t be so damn depressing, I promise.  Swears He Doesn’t Have A Death Wish, -Mc80

      As some of you may know, I work in a funeral home. I work the night shift and my job is pretty simple. If you or someone you know dies, and your/their family decides to use our facility…my partner (rarely) and I go and pick you or someone you know up and bring you or someone you know back to the funeral home. It’s a pretty uneventful job. Sometimes there are really horrible scenes but for the most part it’s me all by myself at 3 in the morning walking down empty hospital halls with my stretcher looking for the room of some poor old lady who kicked the bucked a few hours ago.  The great thing about this job (and only!) is that on a slow night I get to go upstairs into the dormitory and do absolutely nothing. I have worked a few night shifts in my life and never have I been allowed to do this. At first, I promised to be productive. I decided to read all those stupid books my ex-girlfriend tried to get me to read, like Clockwork Orange. That got old pretty quick and eventually I turned to the cable TV that gets ALL the movie channels. Did you know that after 11 PM that almost all those channels show soft porn at least once a night? It’s impossible to escape one of those cheesy plots, which then turns to bouncy boobs jumping up and down. Let’s just say that thank goodness the company I work for decided to cancel all those channels and stick to basic cable. My right hand thanks them privately. My libido mourns, but isn’t that what a funeral home is for?  So after a few weeks of just sleeping I decided to use the computer downstairs. No sleep on slow nights, instead I would have to find something to do on the Internet. I tried chat rooms but they are filled with idiots. I went back to the trusty message boards but I found they are also filled with idiots. That is when I decided to try Blogging, which so far has worked out well.  Well, one particular night last week after 4 death calls I decided to try and get at least a few hours of sleep before my shift was over. I went upstairs, took off my suit and stripped down only to my underwear and undershirt. I slept great on the nasty mattress (with no covers of any kind). At around 7:40 AM with less than half and hour before my shift ended I was awakened by someone slamming their locker. Talk about inconsiderate. I sit up on the bed and turn on the TV to channel 7 news and see my girlfriend Jackie Johnson (weather girl) reporting on yet another beautiful Florida day.  That was when panic struck me. I felt little tiny vibrations on the bed, which seemed to come from right behind me (where my head was previously laying). I turn around and see the biggest, ugliest, and hairiest cockroach I have ever seen!!! I swear to God it was almost as long as my palm and about as thick as my thumb! I immediately jump up and run towards the door.  As I am unlocking it I realize I am nearly nude and what is worse than seeing a fat man run? Seeing a fat naked man run! I turn around only to see that the cockroach was no longer on the bed. I look left and right and nothing. I look down and it was running towards me at incredible speeds and was less than a foot away. I stood there waiting to die of a heart attack when it suddenly made a quick left turn and headed for a wall. Once it hit the wall, it went underneath it and disappeared.  I know some of you are thinking that I must be some kind of a pussy but I’m not. I was severely traumatized as a kid living in the dark city of Caracas, Venezuela. That places makes New York City of the 80’s look like some retirement home in Boca Raton, Florida. Not only was it filled with rats and cockroaches (and even bats!) but there were also tons of crooks and one fine day we were even were held up at gunpoint. Who knows? Maybe if my family was gunned down that day I would have swore revenge on their killers and become…Batman?  Nah, I doubt it. I wouldn’t step one foot in no fucking Batcave.

      Why don’t people take the time to learn how to use a Peer-To-Peer programs like Limewire and Kazza? After a few months of use, I saw EVERY single kind of porn picture and movie you can possibly imagine and for FREE. Some of the stuff still gives me nightmares to this day. I have always searched out these women who have sex with dogs, snakes, and pigs. I mean, if they are willing to stick the end of a snake inside their holes…just how far would they be willing to go with me? And what if we meet up at some bar and she says no to me? How big of a bruise will that leave? She’ll suck off a horse until ejaculation but she won’t have sex with ME! Oh my God…what kind of freak am I?  I know what’s you’re thinking…mc80 what kind of weirdo looks at animal sex? Well, first of all…don’t judge me! Secondly, it wasn’t just that. I got to see things that almost turned me gay like shit eaters, and the occasional shoving a full size head inside an asshole.  Listen to me…I’m no weirdo, ok? I was just doing research. I don’t even look at porn and if I did, I sure as hell wouldn’t tell anyone about it. All I’m saying is I don’t pay for it and neither should you.  In Denial, -mc80
