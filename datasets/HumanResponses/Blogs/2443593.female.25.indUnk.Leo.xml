      Christmas has come and gone and now we're heading into a New Year.  My trip to Houston was nice although I came down with a nasty chest cold and was under the weather most of the time.  Andrew is now at home sick so I guess a lot of that is going around.  A friend of mine who works at a medical office was quarantined to her office this morning because she was feeling ill and they thought that she might have meningitis.  She doesn't but they are not taking any chances.  Too many sick people around.  Santa was very good to me this year.  I got  urlLink Tivo  which I am setting up tonight.  I also got a lovely Kate Spade bag.  Here it is below:       &nbsp;   Have I ever told you how much I LOVE  urlLink Kate Spade  bags?  Well I do, better than any other designer.  I think her simplicitic style closely matches mine.  Anyway, this is the bag I got but I saw a pink one at Neiman Marcus yesterday that I fell in love with.  Same style bag but in pink!  It really is a tough world.  Santa (aka Mom and Dad) also brought me a few CD's, a wall gallery frame set, massaging bath pillow and some books.  Grandma got me 1000 thread count cotton luxury sheets.  Only the best from grandma!  Work has been slow and busy.  It's slow because all of our clients are on vacation and it's busy because it's the end of the sales month and we've been booking orders all week.  The good thing is that I'm off Thursday and Friday!  Nothing exciting happening while I'm off.  Just taking the cat to the vet and getting fitted for eye glasses.  I also plan to do some much needed cleaning.

      Guess what folks?  Today we leave for the Lone Star State!  And that means no blogging until I get back so you'll have to live without it.  I know, I know.  It's hard to resist my blog because I am so witty and interesting.  But it's Christmas and you should be spending time with your family and friends and not blogging.  So have a happy holiday and I'll be back next week with more fun and adventures!  Well, it doesn't get that exciting.  Happy Holidays!        &nbsp;

      Three more days until Christmas!  Woo hoo!  One more day until we go home!  Woo hoo!  And even more exciting news is that we got upgraded to first class on our flight.  This week just can't get any better.  Well, if I was at home or somewhere else besides work, then I guess it could get better.  Nothing is going to get done anyway.    We had our Secret Santa party at work today.  I got a bottle of sparkling wine.  Tanya got an unwrapped vase.  She's not too happy about that.    One more day until we leave!  Yay for Christmas!

      Yay!  It's the weekend!  And tonight is Tanya's holiday party.  Andrew's employer sent us a huge honeybaked ham so we're bringing it to the party tonight.  I also got my Yankee swap gift all already and wrapped.  Fun times tonight!  So big news today.  The  urlLink Big Dig  finally opened this morning.  This is huge step for the city and now all they need to do is tear down the ugly green freeway and make room for parks and residential buildings.  The freeway you see in the picture below will be gone.  In fact, most of it is already.       &nbsp;   It truely is an engineering marvel and they have been working on it for over 10 years.  It is the largest construction project ever in US history (bigger than the Panama Canal).  Let's just hope it helps the traffic problem of getting through the city.  I'm off to shop for Andrew's Christmas present.  I have no clue what to get him.  Any ideas?

      Dear Thursday,  Why are you such a tease?  You are so close to Friday yet you are still one day away.  Why does it feel like Friday sometimes and then I realize it's only Thursday?  Your only positive is must see TV night and even then, that's not good enough.  Please, please, please stop teasing me and tell me it's Friday!  Signed, Your live for the weekend friend  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hee hee, I can't wait for the weekend because Tanya's Holiday Party is Saturday night and it's the last weekend before Christmas!  Cannot wait until we go home on Tuesday.  The first thing we always do when we get off the plane is go to Whataburger.  Yummmmm!  They have the BEST burgers and the BEST breakfast and they're open 24 hours.  Now only if Sonic was open that late...  So last night I went to my Junior League Provisional Group Holiday Party.  It was loads of fun.  We ate in the North End and had a Yankee Swap.  These Yankee Swaps must be big in the Northeast because I had four of them this year.  I had one of the last picks and got this really cute chocolate martini set, complete with liquor and hershey kisses.  It was super cute until the person after me took it and I got stuck with a crappy bottle of red table wine.  Oh well, I guess that's what its all about.  My wine rabbit was a huge hit so that's good.  Went to the doctor this morning and boy do my arms hurt!  I had to get all of these blood tests done, two shots and an EKG.  Ouch!  My doctor thinks I have either a heart condition or thyroid condition (more likely thyroid) and gave me some heart medication to slow down my heart rhythm.  A normal resting heartbeat is 80 and mine is at 160.  Yikes!  Now I know why I feel sick a lot.  Hopefully, this medication will do me some good.    I was doing a little research online about different types of thyroid disorders and  urlLink hyperthyroidism  is likely the one I have.  My mom has  urlLink hypothyroidism  so it must be hereditary.   urlLink WebMD  is such a great site.  I'm not a hypochondriac or anything but WebMD is a great site for finding information on any sympton.    I think I'm craving chinese for lunch today.  Hmmmmmm...

      This week is now "travel where becky has lived" week so it won't get too interesting but here are a few places that I have lived:  Houston, Texas 1978-1996, 1997-1998 Brenham, Texas 1996-1997 (one hour northwest of Houston) San Marcos, Texas 1998-1999 (30 minutes south of Austin) Austin, Texas 1999-2002 Boston, Mass 2002-present  Austin was my favorite place to live in Texas.  On Monday's post, I posted some facts about Houston so today I will post facts about Austin:  *Chartered in 1839 as the capital of the Republic of Texas, Austin became the state capital when Texas was admitted to the Union in 1846 as the twenty-eighth state.    *Austin was orginally named "Waterloo" but was renamed after Stephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas."    *Austin is now the second fastest growing city in the nation being the fourth largest city in the state and the sixteenth most populous city in the nation.   *Austin is home to the largest university in the nation,  urlLink The University of Texas at Austin .  UT-Austin enrolls more than 50,000 students a year.    *Austin has the highest educated populous of any U.S. city, with a full 35 % of adults having college degrees, more than half of these holding advanced degrees.   *Austin averages 300 days of sunshine a year. The average winter temperature is 42 - 62. Summer temperatures typically range from 75 - 95.   *Austin bills itself as "The Live Music Capital of the World." Over 100 live acts from blues to tejano appear on any given Saturday evening. Austin is ranked 6th in the U.S. in number of musicians and artists per capita.   *Congress Avenue Bridge is home to the world's largest urban bat colony.  Over 1.5 million Mexican Free Tail Bats make downtown Austin their home from mid-March to early November. They consume 10,000 to 30,000 pounds of insects nightly! Not too many mosquitoes in Austin.   *And this is kinda funny but according to one geographer, digging straight down from Austin will not get you to China but to Iraq.  Maybe that's why Bush calls Austin his home?  Austin, Texas       &nbsp;  San Marcos, Texas is home to my alma mater  urlLink Texas State University .  I only spent a few semesters living in San Marcos and then moved to Austin and commuted back and forth while working at the  urlLink Frank Erwin Center .  Good times in San Marcos but it was too small townish for me.  Andrew continued to live there and I moved in with  urlLink Tara .  There aren't too many facts about San Marcos but here are just a few that I came across:  *San Marcos is named after the famed Texas Ranger, Jack Hays.  The city is the home of San Marcos Baptist Academy; and the alma mater of  President Lyndon B. Johnson, Southwest Texas State University whose campus commands an impressive view of the city.    *The Austin-San Marcos-San Antonio corridor is located on a 30 mile fault line.  The fault line is no longer active but was once a hotbed for earthquakes.    *The largest waterpark in North America is just down the road in New Braunfels.   urlLink Schlitterbahn  is a 65 acre waterpark and megaresort and is built around a natural river.  Well that's all for today folks!

      Today I feel sick and I mean really sick.  I think it has something to do with my thyroid which is thankfully being tested on Thursday.  One day I feel great and the next I feel horrible.  Hopefully my doctor will make me feel better.  I better not be getting the flu.  Everyone has the flu and I've been lucky to not get it so far.  I used to get the flu every year and that was miserable.  I will just keep eating my oranges and drinking my vitamin water and I should be OK.    urlLink Vitamin Water    has become my new coffee.  I just can't live without it.  It comes in a multitude of flavors and is very refreshing.  Today I am drinking "revive" which is a fruit punch flavored water loaded with vitamin B and potassium.  It's very yummy.  I was perusing the web today and I came across the  urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  website.  If you haven't seen this show, it's about five gay men who makeover a straight man's home, body and style.  It's quite amusing although sometimes I think their style is a little out there.  Andrew wants to go on this show so bad but I don't think he would qualify.  I think his aspiration for going on the show is for the free Hugo Boss suits and the $5K shopping spree.  He is what we call  a "metrosexual."  According to  urlLink WordSpy.com , the word "metrosexual" is defined as "An urban male with a strong aesthetic sense who spends a great deal of time and money on his appearance and lifestyle."  Well then Andrew would not qualify but I do know plenty of men who would so I browsed their website for nominating someone and found this  urlLink application form .  So if a man in your life needs a little "housekeeping,"  fill out the form and send it in!  Also, on my journey around the web, I came across this website  urlLink How Stuff Works .  Check it out!

      Dear Blog,  Sorry I didn't write you this weekend but I was really busy, I swear.  Friday was a blur.  On saturday I had to take the car in for a little TLC (oil change), run about 1000 errands, finish my last minute Christmas shopping and then attend Jess's Christmas/Birthday/Engagement party.  Sunday was also filled with errands and more snow, yes more snow.  It wasn't as bad as last week's storm but it went from snow to sleet to rain so I guess that's pretty bad.  One week from tomorrow and we leave for Houston!  Yay!  I love going home for the holidays.  I can't imagine not going home for Christmas but I guess eventually, if we have our own family, we will need to stay at home for Santa Claus to come.  Every year since Andrew and I have been together, we go to Houston for Christmas eve and then fly to Colorado Christmas Day or the day after.  While in Colorado, we usually hang out at the Eckerman's for a few days and then head up to the slopes of Keystone.  We then come back to their house for New Year's Eve and head back to Houston the day following New Year's Day.  It's a grand ole time!  This year we're just heading to Houston and then back to Boston.  I spoke with my dad last night and he mentioned the possibility of the guys playing golf on Friday while the girls shop and then all of us driving to Lake Charles, Louisiana on Saturday to go gambling.  The weather should be nice, highs in the high 60's, lows in the mid 50's.  Sounds like a fun week to me!  In case you don't know anything about Houston, here are some facts:  *Houston is the eighth largest city in the world, the fourth largest in the United States (trust me, it's big)  *4.5 million people live in the Houston metro area and in Harris County, the third largest county in the nation  *Greater Houston area contains about 8,778 square miles - more than eight times the size of Rhode Island.  *The Port of Houston, a $15-billion petrochemical complex, is a major U.S. gateway for international trade, and ranks number one in the nation in foreign tonnage and second in total tonnage.   *The renowned Texas Medical Center, home to 42 non profit institutions on 675 acres, is the largest medical center in the world.   *Average high temperature in August is 94 degrees.  January is the coldest with a high of 61 degrees.  *The Houston Airport System is the fourth largest in the United States, the sixth largest in the world.   We like things BIG in Texas!       &nbsp;

      If you know me, you know that I LOVE cars.  I don't just mean any ole car.  I prefer sporty cars but I do like a nice classic car.  Selling my beloved Honda Del Sol when we moved to Boston was a tough decision for me but I had to do it.  There was no way to have two cars here, it's just too expensive to park them.  So, we took Andrew's Acura Integra and it worked out dandy until it started to have problems.  So we decided to upgrade to an Acura TSX.  We LOVE this car!  It comes fully equiped with everything for under $30K.  It even made the top 10 best cars list compiled annually by Car and Driver.  It also made the top of the list in a number of different magazines such as Money and Motor Trend.  The only option on the car is the navigation system that we, of course, had to have (I married gadget man).  It has proven to be extremely valuable in getting around the state as we still are learning our way around.  I now realize that we are spoiled with it and can't live without it.  It's just too great to have.  Here are a few pictues of our car and the nifty nav system:       &nbsp;        &nbsp;  When we do purchase another car, I want to get a sports coupe.  I've always loved small cars so I want my little sports car and Andrew can have his luxury sedan.  Here are some of my favorites:  Honda S2000 (all time fav)       &nbsp;   Audi TT Quattro       &nbsp;   Nissan 350Z       &nbsp;   BMW M-3       &nbsp;   MINI cooper (not a sports car but fun nonetheless!)       &nbsp;   Almost time for the weekend!

      Since we are the topic of traveling this week, I thought today I would share some great travel tips and websites with you.   Book your flight within the two month mark, don't book too far in advance unless you have to and book before the three week mark of your flight.  Airlines have different fare classes that they release during this period and the date of booking will have an affect on what fare class you are able to get.  Take full advantage of fare sales!  Looking for a discount code for Marriot or Avis or another hotel/car rental company?  Visit this site  urlLink http://www.flyertalk.com   It has an enormous amount of information on travel-related issues. I saved a lot of money on our rental car in Maui by looking for a discount code on this website and I visit it often to find promotions and special fares.  Looking for a last minute getaway?   urlLink Site59  is a great website for last minute travel deals to any destination.  I checked it out this morning and for $160/pp you can fly roundtrip from Boston to Philly this weekend and stay at the Sheraton in King of Prussia, PA (which has one of the largest malls in North America) and also get a midsize rental car.  That's a great deal!   urlLink SideStep  is a site that I recently discovered and it has already saved me a lot of time searching for travel deals.  The great thing about sidestep is that you just plug in the dates and location and it searches a database of websites for you such as travelocity, expedia, orbitz and also checks the websites of major carriers such as Delta, American and United.  So instead of searching multiple travel sites, sidestep will do this for you!  Before I found sidestep, I used to check low fares on expedia and travelocity and then book online through the lowest carrier.  I never book directly on expedia or travelocity because they are always $5-10 higher than booking directly through a carrier's website.  The additional $5-10 is a booking fee but browsing their site is a great way for finding the lowest fare available.  There is one feature of travelocity that I really like which is the "search all dates."  Just plug in a destination into this feature and it will show you the best deals for a certain time frame, usually up to three months out.  This feature is great to have if you can be flexible with your dates.  I've never used priceline because if you book a flight through them, you do not receive elite status qualifying miles (but you do receive frequent flyer miles).  I also do not like that fact that you buy your hotel room before you know what is it.  But if you like using priceline, here are a few sites that focus on the strategies of online bidding,  urlLink biddingfortravel    urlLink betterbidding   Once you have your plane ticket, or if you are at the step of the booking process where you can assign your own seat then check out  urlLink SeatGuru .  This is a great site for finding the best possible seat on a plane.  It only features domestic carriers but it has been useful in determining where to sit.  That's all my travel advice for today.  Hopefully this will help someone out when planning your next trip!  ~later on in the day~  While I was bored today, I took a quiz titled "which friends character are you most like?"  Here is what it told me:    urlLink      I'm Rachel Green from Friends!   urlLink Take the Friends Quiz here.        I don't know if I agree with this but oh well... I was bored.

      Sorry I haven't written.  I've been busy finishing my Christmas shopping and also trying to figure out our trip to Italy.  I love to travel and Italy is one of my top 10 places to visit before I perish so I think we're going to make a trip out of it next year.  We will be celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple and also celebrate Andrew's graduation as an MBA student.  We really wanted to go for our honeymoon but money was very limited so we used our miles and went to the Virgin Islands for pretty much free.  It was nice but I'm still itching to make it to the Mediterrean.  Speaking of traveling, here are the places I want to visit in my lifetime:  (not necessary in this order) 1. New Zealand            2. Australia                   3. Greece/Malta            4. Fiji/Bora Bora/Tahiti   5. Alaska                     6. Italy 7. Spain/France 8. African Safari 9. The Orient 10. Ireland/Denmark/The Netherlands/Holland/Switzerland  Over the years, I've learned to plan for trips and find the most cost-effective hotel rooms and airplane tickets.  There are some great resources on the web.  One of my favorites is flyertalk.com (link on the left).  It's a great forum where people share their itineraries, discount codes on hotels and rental cars and strategies for using your frequent flyer miles.  Through extensive online research and websites like these, we've been able to travel cheap and maximize our benefits as frequent flyers.  Continental Airlines is one of my favorite airlines.  Not only do they have great equipment, their customer service is unmatched.  I must say that I am disappointed in their recent changes to their One Pass program but I will continue to fly them because their largest hub is in Houston where my family is located.  We are silver elite members which entitles us to space available first-class upgrades as well as a 50% mileage bonus on every flight.  They also partner with major domestic carriers Delta and Northwest so we also receive the benefits on those airlines.    Ok, so back to Italy.  I have no clue where to start.  We plan to stay there about 10 nights so our time is limited.  Note to self: buy Italy guide book.  That should help get me started.  We are using our miles to get over there so air travel is taken care of.    Oh, here's a good tip of the day:  Get an American Express card and put everything you buy on it.  It's the greatest card because you get membership rewards points towards merchandise and travel for things you buy everyday.  AND you HAVE to pay it off every month no matter what (it's a "charge" card not a "credit" card)  so you do not acquire debt.  Andrew and I both have one and we have put everything we can on it since last May and have accumulated close to 50K points (no that doesn't mean we spent $50K to get 50K points).  50K points translates to 50K miles which is equal to two domestic air travel certificates or one international air travel certificate.  You just scored yourself a free trip for using it on everyday purchases!  That's how we do it folks.  Where should we go?       &nbsp;

      What a freaking mess!  Snow is cool and all but my gosh does it create a mess!  It took me and hour and a half to get to work this morning when it usually takes me 20 minutes.  The subway line I usually take was so backed up and most of the trains were out of service so I had to take another line which was even worse.  Oh well, at least I made it here safe and sound.    They are saying that this storm could be a top 10 "noreaster."  Last year, during President's Day weekend, we also had a top 10 noreaster.  Figures that when we move here, we have some of the biggest storms ever.  Oh and for those of you that don't know what a "noreaster" is (because I didn't either before I moved here), it's another word for big snow storm/blizzard.  Here is a picture of people digging their cars out of snow (we have yet to see our car):       &nbsp;  (from Boston.com)  However, the snow didn't stop the New England Patriots from playing yesterday.  An estimated 450,000 pounds of snow had to be removed from the football field at Gillette Stadium before the game yesterday (and yes the Patriots won against the Miami Dolphins yesterday and are now #1 in their division, go Pats!).  What boggles my mind is why in the world did they not build a stadium with a retractable roof like other cities (like Houston and Milwaukee)?  Hello!  This is New England, it snows here!  Oh well, I guess these crazy people like freezing their butts off and sitting in a cold wet seat.  Not me.  Here's a crazy picture of the fans throwing snow after a touchdown:       &nbsp;  (from Boston.com)

      Well, the snow finally stopped.  We were snowed in all weekend which was nice because we got to relax, sleep and finish a few errands that were not getting done.  The total snowfall in the city was 26 inches (a little over 2 feet) and just north of Boston got 36 inches.  That's a lot of snow!  We haven't even seen our car yet but I know it's buried.  Oh well, thank goodness for the subway.  We were supposed to have our work holiday party at the Museum of Science tonight but that has since been postponed.  That's ok, it's too cold to go outside anyway.  I'm such a wuss when it comes to the cold but hey, I'm from Texas!  So what can I tell you about me besides snow related stuff?  Well I did get accepted into graduate school for the Spring.  That's exciting!  The program I am considering is a Master of Arts in Integrated Marketing Communications.  Basically it covers all aspects of PR, Advertising, events and communications.  I think I want to go back and work in non-profit management (comm director or something) or market trade show events.  My experience thus far in my career has been good but I don't feel rewarded (and I don't mean monetarily rewarded).  I guess I am a giving back sort of person.  Anyway, I hope this program will help me get there.  Wish me luck!  I didn't get outside to take any pictures so today you will be getting a cool link.  I went to yahoo and typed in "snow" and guess what came up?  Snow.com...  surprise, surprise.  Actually, snow.com is the website of the ski resort we go to every year with Andrew's family.  They have excellent mountains and great runs there.  I strongly encourage you to go!  If you don't like skiing, they have great shops and yummy hot chocolate.  Here's the link:  urlLink Snow.com                                                         Oh and today is Tara's Birthday!  Happy Birthday Tara!!!

      Let it snow...  Today we got 8 inches of snow in the city and we're supposed to get 6 inches tonight.  It's quite chilly but the snow is gorgeous so I don't mind walking in the cold.  Andrew and I had to leave the apartment because around noonish the fire alarm started going off (false alarm) and the landlord of the building who had the key to turn it off was snowed in.  The noise of the alarm was too much so we left and went galloping in the snow (and at Gap).  While walking down our street, we ran into a familiar face:        &nbsp;  We are supposed to go to Chris and Flynn's Christmas party tonight but I have a feeling that our car is buried in snow.  I'm also not feeling too good so I'm going to take a nap now...  Good night!

      TGIF.  I never thought it would get here.  Saturday mornings are my favorite because they allow me to catch up on all the lost sleep from the week.  I seriously need a good 8-9 hours of sleep a night so sleeping for 10 hours on Saturday is no problem for me.  And I'm still not caught up from the jetlag of our trip home from Hawaii.  Our 21 hours of traveling back to Boston was so exhausting.  Tonight the girls and I are driving down to Providence to go Christmas shopping.  I'm very excited even though I'm pretty much done with my list of people to buy for.  We are taking the super car (the TSX for those of you that aren't in the know) and it's going to be snowy drive home.  I am a bit nervous because I've never driven in snow before but I'm sure we'll make it out of there before it hits.  The boys are going to Tommy's house to play video games so they'll have a good time too.     Christmas is only three weeks away!  Here is a cute site for the kiddies to explore (and kid-adults).   urlLink http://www.northpole.com   Happy Holidays!        &nbsp;

      Today is much warmer than yesterday.  When leaving the house yesterday morning, it was 16 degrees with a windchill of 1.  That's just way too cold!  Being a southern transplant to New England, I have decided that I am officially in hibernation.  This weekend we are supposed to get a good amount of snow and I plan to throw some snowballs at Andrew but otherwise, I'll be inside.  This might be a good chance to catch up on some of my netflix rentals.  Work is pretty slow today but this week in general has been crazy.  I'm still trying to catch up on things since I was in Hawaii last week.  The images of Mai Tai's and white sand beaches are dancing in my head right about now...  Here's a fun site to check out today: http://www.dailycandy.com

      Welcome to my first blog!  You might ask yourself... what is a blog?  Well, a blog is an online diary.  Life is busy so I've chosen to document my day-to-day life online.  I will include links and ideas that inspire me.  I hope you will visit often as I will have a lot to share.  Tootles for now!

      I am really sad right now.  I just found out that a volunteer that I worked very closely with when I worked at LLS has passed away.  Her name is Ashley Fenton and she had a terrible cancer called leukemia.  It's very common in young adults and unfortunately it finally took her life.  She was 22 years old.  We became somewhat close because she volunteered at a lot of my events and was always there when I needed her.  She came to Boston a lot for clinical trials and cancer treatments so whenever I moved here, we talked about getting together but then we lost touch.  When I left Austin, she was doing great and was in remission from her disease.  I just feel sad because she was so young and was one of the nicest girls I have ever met.  She wanted to be a nurse and had so many hopes and dreams.  She also had a wonderful boyfriend and family.  It just makes me wonder... why her?  Why do awful things happen to incredible people?  It also makes me realize that what I did at LLS wasn't so bad and that I really did help people whether it was through fundraising or by being there simply as a friend.  I never got a chance to talk to Ashley again but I know that she is in a better place.    In memory of Ashley Fenton, 2003  (Myself, Lance Armstrong and Ashley at the state capitol for the issuance of the "Texans Conquer Cancer" license plate, January 2002)

      Woo hoo! I LOVE skiing!  I just got finished reserving our plane tickets for skiing in Colorado the second week of March.  And Spring skiing is the BEST!  Every year since the Eckermans have lived in Colorado, we've always gone skiing at least once or twice a year.  It's usually at Christmas time but this year we didn't make it up there.  So, we decided to go during Spring Break so it's super warm and nice.  It gets so warm you can literally ski in a long sleeve T-shirt (believe me, we have).  We sorta do the same thing everytime where we fly into Denver, go to the Cherry Creek area for dinner (usually PF Changs), then hang out at the awesome mall for a few hours, spend a couple of days in Colorado Springs at the Eckerman house and then head up to the mountains for a few days of skiing. It's so much fun and incredibly relaxing.  And the Eckerman house is absolutely gorgeous.  It sits high on a hilly area and overlooks Pikes Peak.  Only one month and one week until we go!  Yippeeeeeeee!  It was my first night at my marketing research class last night.  I am even more amazed at how high tech this school is.  My class is in a computer lab because part of the class uses SPSS (Statiscal Package for the Social Sciences).  But I also realized how much work this is really going to be and why two classes are considered full time.  Basically, I have no life the rest of the semester.  Our marketing research project is going to be huge but I'm ready for the challenge!  We had to pick a product or service that is currently not in the Boston market that we could research the potential in the Boston market.  We picked IKEA.  The closest one is in NJ and NY although they have plans to build one right outside the city in Somerville.  So we are going to find out if IKEA will be a success in Boston.  The biggest part of our project is going out and surveying people and holding focus groups.  That will be the fun part though.  I've never been to IKEA so I'm thinking that I may have to make a trip down to NY to do a little research on the store.  Road trip!

      GREAT news!!!  We finally got our hot water back!  No more ice cold showers!  And I finally shaved my legs!  I'm sorry but if I am stuck taking an ice cold shower, shaving my legs is last priority.  But yesterday I was happy to do so and had the best shower ever!  This weekend was very low key as planned and I hardly spent any money (yay for me!).  The only money spent was $15 on a pizza Friday night which also turned into dinner Saturday night.  Oh, and I also spent $10 at a scrapbooking store on Saturday so I could complete my wedding scrapbook.  I bought some really cute paper and some stickers.  I finished my book yesterday morning and spent the rest of the day cleaning and organizing, making gumbo in my crockpot (which by the way was awesome!) and taking a loooooooong hoooooooot shower.  That was it, weekend over.  Now the countdown to this weekend is on.  4 days, 6 hours and 12 minutes.  This weekend's plans will also be low key.  The only thing I plan to do is school work, reorganize my file cabinet and watch the super bowl.  Go Pats!

      It's 9:50am and I'm officially done with my work for the day.  It's Friday and I'm ready to get the heck out of here so now I need to occupy my day with other things.  T just went home sick, her stomach isn't feeling so great and NO she's not pregnant.  I think it's funny that people think that because, #1 you're married and #2 you're a woman, that you're pregnant when you're stomach hurts.  Can't a girls stomach hurt??  What a common misconception.  Anyway, she went home for some R&R.  Hope you feel better T!  As mentioned in my previous post, last night was my first night of class.  It was very interesting.  It's going to be lots of work but I'm up for it.  I was talking to this girl next to me that is taking the same class that I am (research methods class) but on a different night and she was telling me about how that class will be a lot of work.  Oh well, that's what I'm here to do... work.  Anyway, my class last night was Marketing Management and because my undergrad is in marketing, this class will be a repeat of my undergrad degree.  I think I was the only one in the class last night with a business degree so I have a huge advantage over everyone else.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that my classmates were so diverse.  When I was at SWT, it was hardly a diverse school so it will be neat to network with people with very different backgrounds.  To name a few, one girl worked in marketing for Audi Latin America, another girl was the PR Director for Ralph Lauren NY (Rachel Green, anyone?), another person worked for a newspaper in DC, another person was a marketing director for EMC, someone was a marketing manager for a large construction company, the girl next to me was in marketing for a beauty supply distributor, a few people worked in non-profit, a couple of people in radio and my fav was my teacher who used to work in the entertainment industry.  He did a lot of PR work for Virgin Records and a few other music labels out in Los Angeles.  He nows consults the entertainment industry on various issues but is a full time lecturer.  He also coaches the AAF (American Advertising Federation) team at Emerson and is VERY familiar with my alma mater, Southwest Texas State.  In fact, he HATES SWT.  SWT has one of the top advertising departments in the nation and every year, the top finalists in the AAF competition compete for the first place prize, a job with one of the major AD firms in NYC.  SWT and UT-Austin battle it out every year but Emerson also makes it to the top 5.  Anyway, SWT or UT-Austin win pretty much every year so I think my teacher is a little bitter about that.  Oh well, gives us something to talk about.    This weekend is going to be really low key.  We are broke after paying two college tuition bills and still catching on Xmas bills so we're not spending any money the rest of the month.  Tomorrow Andrew has to meet with his group and also go into to work to finish a project.  Sunday, we may go over to Chris and Flynn's house so the boys can play hockey and Flynn and I can scrapbook.  Otherwise, I'll be at home NOT spending money.  It will be a good opportunity to catch up on my netflix movies.

      I'm at a loss for what to write about today.  Nothing really interesting has really happened so far.  Well, I guess something yummy happened today.  That's good to write about.  Food is always a good subject for me.  Well, today Julie (our VP of events who I'm dying to work for but will probably never happen) asked me and Tanya to take her intern to lunch today.  She wanted us to tell her intern about our jobs here, how we interact, how we got started, etc, etc.  We don't have the most interesting jobs in the world so that conversation was quick but we did score some yummy food with Julie's expense account!  We ventured over to PF Chang's (T's first time to go in person and I think she'll be back!) and ordered Chang's spicy chicken, Beef and broccolli, pan fried dumplings and the "Great Wall of Chocolate" which we shared with everyone when we got back.  I'm still hurting from this extravagant feast but it was sooooooo worth it!  I guess some other cool things happened.  When I got back to my desk, Andrew called me to let me know that I had a crapload of packages at home.  I got my ebay purchase (finally! I wasn't scammed), some scrapbooking supplies and my pics from ofoto.  Woo hoo!  Now I can finally finish my wedding scrapbook!  I've really gotten into this scrapbook thing but I feel like such a soccer mom.  I'm not really into the "cutsie" pages but the modern, simple look.  Anyway, it's fun to do and I am releasing my creative energies.  It's good to release those energies.  I also have my first class tonight!  Yippeeeeee!!!!  I'll have to let you know how it goes.  I just hope that I can find it! =)

      I have a very busy day ahead of me.  I have a few meetings, lots of work to catch up on and a Junior League meeting tonight.  Tomorrow will be busy as well but I start school tomorrow evening!  Woo hoo!  I am taking two classes which Emerson considers full time so I guess I'll be working full time and going to school full time.  My life is about to get crazy.  Anywho, I'm taking a Marketing Management class (easy) and a class on Research Methods (easy).  Since my undergrad was in Marketing, these classes should be a breeze.  From Andrew's experience as a professional grad student, graduate school classes are cases and group project intensive.  I will certainly thrive in this environment.  In my final classes as a undergrad, we had so many group projects and I took the lead on every one of them.  I hate getting together with a group and not being focused.  Nothing will ever get done.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to some challenging projects ahead of me!  It's cold today.  It was 15 degrees with a wind chill of 1.  But my honey went and got the car and picked me up so I wouldn't freeze.  For being such a sweetie, I treated him to a bagel sandwich that we picked up on the way to dropping me off.  I think that made him happy.  ;o)  I haven't posted a link in awhile but I wanted to share this website that I came across yesterday.  It's  urlLink addicted to scrapbooking .  It's a great site for ordering scrapbook supplies but the shopping part is a little tough to navigate.  You have to either start over or keep hitting your back button if you want to find something else.  Otherwise, it's a good site to check out.  I don't think I've mentioned this yet but I am on a scrapbooking kick.  I'm trying to scrapbook my entire wedding from how we met, our engagement to the second we leave for the honeymoon.  It's turning out super cute but it's very time consuming and costly.  I'm also going to start another album and include our pics from various trips and occassions: San Francisco/Wine Country, Schlitterbahn and San Antonio, Ski trips to Colorado, Scout and Lucy, Andrew E and Andrew P's 21st birthday parties and so on and so on.  Should be cute!

      Guess what happened at 5:30am today????  The fire alarm went off.... again.  This is getting ridiculous and no one in my building leaves anymore because everyone knows its false.  Well, except for me of course.  This time it only went off for 30 minutes so there has been some definite improvements but 5:30am?  Come on!!!  Anyway, this weekend really sucked.  I wish it could start over.   The only thing good is that I was off work today.  Another cruddy this is that I think I was scammed on ebay. More details on that later.  It's time for dinner!

      Fire alarms are SO annoying.  Especially when they are false.  That seems to be the case with my apartment building the two times a month that it goes off.  This morning it went off... again.  Last weekend it went off and right before Christmas it went off.  About 95% of the time it says that the 7-11 is on fire but usually it's because someone burnt something in the microwave at 7-11.  Soooooo annoying!!!!!!!!  This morning it had a good reason to go off.  The pipes in the basement burst this morning (which explains why I took an ice cold shower) so the alarm went off.  It's been so cold that our indoor pipes in the basement burst.  That's how cold it got.  Anyway, we have NO hot water (how fun for us) and they have called an emergency plumber and our water will be shut off most of the weekend.  SOOO annoying!!!!!  That was just the start to our wonderful day.  The alarm was too loud to stay home so we took the car and went and got some lunch.  Well, we double parked at a fire hydrant and ran inside to pick it up and as I was walking out to the car, a meter maid was writing me a $75 ticket for double parking.  She hadn't written the ticket when I walked out but told me she was going to give me a ticket.  Greeeeeaaaaaaattttt!  Thanks a lot!  Don't even give me a chance to move when you haven't even written the ticket yet.  Thanks and have a nice day you mean lady (I said something meaner than that).  So, lunch in tow with us, we decided to visit a friend's house north of the city.  As I mentioned, the big dig is finished so it should be a breeze to get around, right?  Wrong.  ALL of the entrance ramps are closed on the weekends because they are tearing down the old freeway so there's numerous detours.  30 minutes later we finally get to their house and chow down.   Now the only good thing that happened today is that this morning I scored some floor seats to see John Mayer in Providence.  Woo hoo!  I'm very excited about seeing him.  I think he rocks!  I also found out last night that one of my  friends from college is engaged!  Yeah!  More people getting married!  They always say it happens in clumps.  Here's a picture he sent me with his new fiance at the Galleria in Houston.  Tre and Julie

      It's freeeeeeeeeeezing!!!!!  The walk to the car this morning was brutal!!  It wasn't as bad as last night for some reason even though the actual temperature and wind chill was colder.  I'm going to hibernate all weekend which sucks because Monday is a holiday for us.  Oh well, I can at least catch up on my shows on Tivo.  So yesterday was my graduate school orientation.  It was nice.  I met a lot of new people and I can't wait to start classes next week.  I have been a little skeptical about this program because I really don't know too much about it but I think I will like it.  The campus is AMAZING!  I've never seen such a high tech campus.  I guess that's why it was voted #1 in the nation for the most wired/high tech campus.  It's a paperless school so every project is done online by file sharing. It's also completely wireless as most colleges are these days BUT I can get a wireless connection anywhere in that area and all throughout the Boston Common.  That's pretty cool!    My mom has informed me that her bosses were thinking about setting up a company blog so they were looking at mine.  So, I wanted to give a shout out to everyone in IT at Anadarko Petroleum.  Hello!

      Doesn't my blog look much prettier than last night?  I made a few improvements tonight so it looks a little more organized.  It was a royal pain in the rear but I think it looks SO much better.  I especially like the purple flowers! =)  So tonight was the coldest walk home in my life.  I got home and was in so much pain from the cold.  My legs, toes and fingers were completely numb and it took awhile for feeling to come back.  I had to go into the Junior League for a training on web design and also for the monthly communication committee meeting.  Have I mentioned that I'm a  urlLink Junior League of Boston member ?  Well, I joined this year and love it!  It's huge time commitment but I've met the nicest people and made a lot of connections for jobs.  I'm on the PR committee but I think I want to be on the development committee next year.  I like fundraising and "developing" annual funds, events, etc.  Anyway, the PR committee is new this year so there hasn't been a lot going on.  We are slowly building a media database and getting all of the logistical stuff done for next year.  We are also partnering with another non-profit,  urlLink Fairy Godmother  and putting on an internal event in April where Jr Leagers donate old dresses, shoes and costume jewelry for terminally ill high school students that don't have money to buy a nice dress for prom or whatever.  I'm really excited about it and we are going to do a lot of PR around it.  We also have a show house event coming up in May.  It's where we find a house and a bunch of designers come into the house and each one gets to decorate a different room.  It's a huge fundraiser and should be loads of fun.  We are required to do tours in each room.  There's also a big Gala the week of the opening so that's something to look forward to!  I just hope it doesn't fall on the same weekend as Andrew's graduation.  Time for bed.  I'm exhausted.  Goodnight!

      Today I had a revelation.  I want to start a women's wine club.  The club would be for women only and every month we would get together and learn about a different wine, it's region and the aromas.  We could start our own website, www.womenwinos.com or www.bostonwinos.com.  It would be fun!  But if you know me, I tend to start things and never finish them.  As an example of my procrastination, let's recall some things that were never/almost not completed:   If you visit,  urlLink www.hanoverevents.com , you will notice a "coming soon" message.  Yeah, I started this 6 months ago and it still isn't done.  I still need to register my business though but that's not a rush since I have no business yet (and haven't been pursuing).  Scrapbooking: this dates all the way back to my freshman year of college when I decided one night that I was going to scrapbook all of my high school pictures.  Well, scrapbooking supplies were not as adundant back then as they were now so I ended up buying some color paper and glueing my pictures onto the paper.  It turned out cute but it's still not done and sitting under my bed.   Filing: a neverending project that NEVER gets done.  I was proud of myself last weekend.  I went out and bought a shredder and shredded bills, receipts and misc. crap dating way back.  I still haven't re-organized the file cabinet and I'm sure it will take me another 4 years to do that.  Applying to graduate school: I like to think of this as a project because it is a huge undertaking.  You have to scout out schools, gather necessary forms, take the entrance tests (take a prep class), put together your application (including those dreaded essays), pull together recommendations and then send it off!  I put this off for many years but finally got the initiative to "just do it."  And I did.  And I start school next week!  Work: enough said.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Something struck me today while browsing my favorite website.  The internet has no limits.  I saw this post from a girl who wants people to pay for her wedding (can you guess what site I was on?).  She set up a simple, low budget website,  urlLink www.payforcynthiaswedding.com  and asked people to help contribute to her extravagant dream wedding.  She completely copied another internet panhandler,  urlLink www.savekaryn.com , who was deemed the first internet panhandler.  Karyn Bosnak is a girl, just like you and me, who got caught up in the lifestyle of NYC.  She moved there from Chicago and managed to rack up $20,000 worth of credit card debt.  She lost her job and couldn't pay her bills so she set up her website and asked strangers for money.  Within a few weeks, she was on the Today show and doing radio interviews because the traffic on her site soared.  Within three months, she paid off her debt entirely.  Ever since her success, there have many so many internet panhandling sites popping up all over the place.  Here's just a few:   urlLink http://www.paintmycarpink.com/   urlLink http://www.saveadream.com/   urlLink http://www.fayethekitty.com/   urlLink http://www.seanyg.com/   urlLink http://www.savebarbara.com/   urlLink http://www.mymansucks.com   And there are sooo many more:  urlLink http://savekaryn.com/OtherBrokeFolks.htm   This goes to show you that the internet has no limits and anything is possible, even if you want someone to contribute to painting your car pink.  Off to subway for lunch!

      Weekends are great.  I wish they would never end.  But they do.  And life goes on.  This weekend was pretty much low key for us.  Friday night we went out with our Greek friends, Alex and Michael.  They just got back from visiting family in Greece so they caught us up on their holiday adventures.  Michael has been in LA for the past six months working for Neutrogena on coop and Alex works for Gillette's oral care division.  Alex had some funny stories about the first time she met her boyfriend's parents while in Greece.    More giggles were on Saturday night at Tanya's birthday party at a local bar that she visits every year on her birthday.  We watched the Patriots win and had a few drinks.  Lucky for me and Andrew, this bar was at Fanuiel Hall, a mere 15 minute walk for us.  BUT it was a cold walk home in -3 degree temperatures.  BRRRR!!!!  We did have a good time despite the cold.  And some of us had too much to drink:       &nbsp;  I also played around with my digital camera and my fisheye lense.  My fisheye is the coolest thing ever.  Check out some pics of Scout and Lucy.       &nbsp;          &nbsp;          &nbsp;

      What a day.  There is exciting news in our building... a new Subway Sandwiches opened today!  This is huge for me because now I never have to leave the building.  We have a truffle/candy shop, a hallmark store, shoe repair place, furniture store, bank, frame store/art gallery, mini-market, four restaurants and a cell phone provider.  I'm all set!  No, seriously, I'm just flabergasted.  There is nothing like food to make you happy.  I love food.  I love to eat it, smell it, bathe in it... ok maybe not bathe in it.  But you know what I mean.  One of my favorite things to do is try a new restaurant.  If I had unlimited amounts of money, I would get a zagat guide and eat at every restaurant in that book.  Once I finished one city, I would move on to the next.  That would be fun.  :o)

      Have you ever had a cough so bad that it feels like it's tearing your insides apart?  I do and it's so painful.  Not only does it hurt my throat but also my chest.  Anyway, I stayed home sick yesterday but it was also an eventful day to be home.  Andrew took Scout into the vet for her teeth cleaning and our new couch was to be delivered that morning.  Andrew dropped off Scout with no problems but the couch delivery guys showed up and refused to deliver because they said it wouldn't fit going up the stairs.  Whatever.  We've done this a million times.  So Andrew told them to leave it otherwise they were going to take it back and refund our money.  After they left, it took us about 15 minutes tops to get it up with no problems.  Needless to say, I called and got my delivery fee back.  It turns out the place that we bought our couch from outsources their deliveries to a moving company that happens to be the moving company we used to move us from Austin to Boston.  Figures.  We had SO many problems with that moving company during our big move.  But we did get our new couch and it's very spiffy!  It's kinda hard to see but here is our sofa.  The chair and ottoman is our next our next purchase once we get a bigger place.     &nbsp;  Now back to Scout.  So we picked her up from the vet and she was woozy from the medication.  All evening she was running into things and falling off the couch and bed.  I would be in the other room and hear a big thump, run into the room and there she was laying on the floor confused.  She is such a witty cat so she was getting frustrated that she couldn't jump into the bed herself.  I would try and help her and she would let out a "I can do it myself!" meow.  This morning she was about 90% back to normal.  Poor kitty.

      Today sucks.  I am sick and at work.  My parents are in sunny Las Vegas, my cats are at home fasting and we threw away our two year old couch last night.  On the flipside, I start school next week, Scout gets her teeth cleaned in the morning, our new couch gets delivered tomorrow and my Tivo is at home recording Oprah and many other cool shows (Beverly Hills 90210 reruns anyone?).  I had this terrible cold when I was in Texas, it got better, got Andrew sick and then he gave it back to me and now I'm ill again.  Next year... two words, flu shot.  I've never had one before but I'm beginning to think that it's worth it.  I hate being sick but it's the price you have to pay for people spreading germs into the air.  Especially on the subway, that's the grossest.    To recap my "holiday,"  New Year's Eve we spent at a friend's house, New Year's Day we spent on the couch, Friday we spent at home and in furniture stores looking at couches, Saturday and Sunday we were pretty much at home because I felt too sick to leave.  We did sneak out on Saturday night and go out with some good friends of ours, Bruce and Mark.  Bruce is Andrew's old roommate at Berkelee and a couple of weeks before we moved to Boston, he joined the Navy and was shipped to Japan.  He's a drummer in the Navy Band so he doesn't do any fighting or anything like that.  He still has a full head of hair.  Anyway, he is stationed there until 2006 and then plans to return to the states.  His father is a ship pilot and lived in Newport, RI until he was moved over to the island of Trinidad.  Bruce now comes back to the states every six months or so but we always seem to miss him.  We hope to visit him in Japan by the time he gets out of the Navy.  How fun would it be to tour Japan with a local?  It's a vacation to-do that's been added to my list. *check*  Mark was one of the first friends we made when we moved to Boston.  He grew up with Bruce and is a graduate student at Emerson.  He lives with his girlfriend Lisa who is a sweetheart.  We don't see them as much as we want to because Mark plays the saxophone in a jazz band and gigs in Rhode Island every weekend.  I think we might have make the trip down there to see him play one weekend.  I'm always game for a road trip!  Speaking of trips, I need to book our ski trip for March.  We're dying to get on the slops this year.  I'm in ski withdrawel!!!!  And it's only $175pp to Denver direct from Boston on Jetblue.  That's a steal!  Thank goodness for low cost carriers.  And Spring skiiing is the best.  It's so warm you could ski in a T-shirt if you wanted to (I don't).  Tata for now!   Andrew, Bruce and Mark     &nbsp;

      So much for a busy day.  Today is the end of our sales month but it sure doesn't feel like it.  It's soooooo slow.  The good thing is we got free lunch and it was muy bueno (very good for those of you lacking spanish skills).  I did make it over to that intern fair at lunch and it was ok.  There were some great opportunities and companies there but most of it was geared towards undergrads (which I knew).  I did talk with the Boston Music Awards and they seemed very interested in talking with me further about an internship with them so that's good.  They put on the awards and a weeklong music industry conference (kinda like SXSW in Austin) in Sept which this person would help develop.  Sounds fun so hopefully I will hear back from them.    Here is something for you to do today.  Dictionary.com is a great site.  Use it to translate this phrase below from German to English:  Ein schneller Quiz über Becky. Lassen Sie uns sehen, wie gut man Sie mich kennt:   1. Was ist mein mittlerer Name?  2. Was war der Name meines ersten Haustieres?  3. Welche Stadt mein Bruder, der innen Phasen ist?  4. Was ist meine Lieblingsfarbe?  5. Was ist mein Vatiname?   (Antworten werden an einigen Tagen bekanntgegeben)  hee hee, good luck!

      Thanks Tara for reminding me to update.  OK, let's see.  On Monday, I went to work and school.  Tuesday, work and jr league meeting.  Wednesday, just work and last night severely proscrastinated my way out of studying for my tests next week.  Today, work and school.  Tomorrow, work and a yummy steak dinner with Tom and Tanya (we get our bonuses tomorrow!!!).    This weekend, study, study, study, cram, cram and more cramming.  The cruddy thing is that its supposed to be gorgeous and warm this weekend and I will be stuck inside with my nose in my books.  Oh well, this is what I signed up for and it will pay off in the end.  Last night, I was perusing the web and came across a resume from Emerson that was in my exact program.  It looks like she was in her last semester so I decided to email her to ask her thoughts on the program so far.  She responded very favorably and gave me some great advice on choosing my electives.  I also noticed that she had some great work experience before Emerson and was currently interning at Arnold Worldwide (one of the top ten ad agencies in the world) and asked her about her experience there.  She loves it.  She is currently working in brand planning and gets to work with well-known accounts such as Volkswagen, truth.com and McDonalds.  Through talking to her, I decided to pursue an internship in advertising.  It's something that I've always been interested in so I'm going to take this opportunity while I'm in school to try it out.  I'm heading to an internship recruiting event tomorrow so hopefully I will have some luck there.  I'm excited!  Something new and different!  You know me, I long for change.  And now for some sad news.  Jeremy and Dana broke up.  Yep, it's true.  I never saw this coming.  I'm sure they will be happy but I think I will secretly hope for them to get back together because I really like Dana.  Jeremy is coming skiing with us next week so maybe I can try to talk some sense in that boy!    One last thing, I picked up PF Changs to-go for dinner last night and they gave us five fortune cookies! (and not nearly enough rice- go figure)  Anyway, I LOVE fortune cookies so I ate 4 and andrew ate 1.  Fair trade right?  Whoever picks up the food gets more fortune cookies?  Anyway, my fortunes were so great!  They were like, "your dream will come true after a long awaited period," or "you are destined to be a rock star" and then "your body is the sexiest body on earth."  OK, not really but those cookies were sooooo good!

      Today is a really sad day.  I just watched the final episode of my favorite show in the whole world, Sex and the City.  I will admit, I cried throughout the entire show.  I now feel lost, like my best friend just moved away.  I've been addicted to this show ever since it first aired 6 years ago.  I bought every season on DVD the day it came out.  Heck, I even bought the book.  It's now a distant memory.  Now it's time to say good bye to "Friends" which I don't think it will be quite as hard as the show has gone down in recent years.  Still a favorite of mine so I will be sad.       As a tribute to the best show ever, here are some memories of SATC...

      What's up my bloggie friends?  Today has been busier than I thought.  There are a lot of organizational changes happening again and everything was downsized even more which means more work for me.  Yay!  That's ok because in exactly two weeks we'll be on a plane on the way to Colorado!  Yippee!  I can't wait to go skiing and our friends Andrew and Aranda might join us now (we're working on talking them into it).  It will be fun and relaxing either way and I know Andrew is looking forward to playing his drums.  Can't wait!  Everyone is talking about doggies lately so I thought I would share pictures of the dog I want to get eventually.  My fav dog is the border collie.  I love these dogs for their grace and how smart they are.  I would love to compete with it in agility competitions.  They are so darn cute too!   Short Hair Puppy     Long haired puppy     Full grown Bordie Collie     Woof!

      I'm so tired.  Zzzzzzzzzzzz.... I think I may actually fall asleep at my desk today.  I have a big part of my marketing research project due today so I was working on that last night.  We didn't wait until the last minute to do our project, we just needed to tweak it.  I also had a junior league meeting last night so I didn't get home until 9pm.  And I almost got hit by a car. It was very close.  Yikes!  Now isn't this the cutest thing you have ever seen!         That's my little nephew Ashton.  Michelle sent me an email letting me know that he turned over all by himself!  I guess he was pretty proud in this picture.  He's soooo adorable!  Tara has a new little something in her life.  Her name is Lucy (yes, my cats name is also Lucy).  She is an 8 week old Chihuahua/Shar Pei puppy and she's sooo cute.  Look how cute she is!

She got engaged (Heather for those of you that know her) on V-day and they are planning a March 2005 wedding.  I, of course, referred her to the knot.  :)  I'm really happy for her! Congrats Heather!  Yay for weddings!

      Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.  Men and women everywhere are rushing to get last minute cards and flowers for their loved ones.  Some people just love the holiday, some people totally hate it.  I'm kinda in the middle.  You see, I don't view Valentine's Day as a "hallmark" holiday (which it really is) but rather a special day to do something for your special someone.  Yes, I know we should do something special for our loved ones the other 364 days of the year but in reality, people are really busy and they tend to forget.  I view this holiday as a reminder that cupid struck us (which I am thankful for) and I should stop and take the time to show my appreciation for him in my life.  This doesn't mean I'm rushing out to buy Andrew $100 worth of flowers or candy, it means that it is a special day for us to spend together and share our love for one another.  That's it.  Plain and simple.  Holidays are what you make of it.  However, bosses and secretaries day are a whole other story..... just plain dumb.  Have you ever googled your name before?  Well, I decided to have a little fun and give it a try.  By doing so, I discovered that my name revealed an IBM product manager in Australia who is deaf.  Hmmmm... interesting.  I also decided to google Andrew's name and guess what?  He's an internet celebrity!  He had a project that he did at SWT come up and he also popped up on a record label's website.  Back in the day, my honey was playing all kinds of gigs and on people's albums.  This is the last one he did right before we moved to Boston.  Check it out!  I LOVE this CD he did and you should go out and buy it to support it!.  You can buy it through this link or through amazon.com.   urlLink Russell Bioarsky   You can listen to snippets of the tracks through this  urlLink link .  Happy Friday!  Friday the 13th at that!

      I'm extremely busy but I wanted to pop in and say hello to everyone.  I hope everyone is having a good week.  As mentioned before, I'm swamped with school and work has been busy so I haven't had much free time to do anything.  Still no decision on the hat.  But some good news is that my brother Jeremy and his girlfriend Dana are coming to Boston in May for Andrew's graduation.  I'm so excited! Yippee!!!!!!!!!  Cheers!

      Hello fellow bloggers and blog readers...  I do realize that I have neglected my blog for over a week now so I thought I would give you an update on what's been going on.  School.  That is what's been going on.  My teacher just dumped two huge projects that are due next week so you won't be seeing much of me on here.  I also have two big exams in a couple of weeks so that will keep me busy.  This weekend should be fun.  On saturday me, Kristyn and Tanya are driving down to the South Shore to this huge scrapbooking store to stock up on supplies.  The scrapbook stores are pretty disappointing here.  There aren't very many and they are teeny tiny.  The one we are going to on Saturday is supposed to be big but I'm not sure what that means.  Sunday, I am jetting over to Tanya's sisters house for pampered chef party. I've never been to one of those so I'm not sure of what to expect.  Monday is a holiday and I will either be at the library or at home working on my projects.  So much for a day off.  Tanya just bought a Von Dutch hat off ebay.  I've seen these before on celebrities but never really "noticed" them until she pointed them out.  Anyway, now she has me wanting one so which color do you like best?  Vote for the hat you think I should get.  Enter your response in my tag.  Thanks!   Hat #1     Hat #2     Hat #3     Hat #4     Hat #5     *New* Isn't this the cutest dog you've ever seen?  I want one of these!

      Shame on you Mr. Timberlake.  Shame on you Ms. Jackson.  That was so uncalled for!  If you watched the SuperBowl Halftime show, you know what I'm talking about.  I was so shocked when I saw Justin reach for her top that I had to rewind it (thanks to Tivo!) and watch it again and again just to see if it was real.  It seemed intentional until I saw Janet's look on her face but then I couldn't really tell.  In any case, it was uncalled for.    Other than that, the NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS WON!!!! YAHOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Andrew and I stayed home by ourselves to watch it and it was great.  I knew people would go crazy on the streets whether they won or lost so we decided to take our chances safe at home.  It was quite annoying because people were partying on the streets until the wee hours of the morning and honking horns.  One person was even killed when a car plumented through a crowd of people.  Ridiculous.  This town gets a little too hung up on sports.  There's no reason to overturn a car if your favorite team wins.  Give me a break.  But I guess a lot of it has to do with drunk college kids looking for trouble.  I guess I wouldn't call myself a die-hard sports fanatic.  I like to go to live games and have a good time.  In fact, we are going to a Boston Bruins hockey game tomorrow night when they play Andrew's favorite team, the Atlanta Thrashers.  I've never been to a NHL hockey game before so I think it will be fun.  I still don't know why Andrew loves the Thrashers so much.  He's never lived in Atlanta and has no affiliation with them.  Oh well, whatever makes him happy.  :o)

      So our realtor had NO clue as to how picky we were.  The two places she showed us were not that great so the search continues.  We did find a really nice place on Saturday that we are considering and going back to look at this weekend.  The big draw for this place is that its a brand new complex and it has a pool and workout room.  That is unheard of up here.  Anyway, we'll see how this weekend goes.    I decided to turn down that internship that I was offered for the summer.  They needed me to start before Memorial Day weekend and that just isn't possible yet.  I am hoping that they will offer it to me in the Fall but we'll have to see.  They really liked me so it would probably be a possibility.    Last night was probably my grossest dinner I've made yet but it wasn't my fault.  Yesterday we made a visit to the grocery store and saw that they had crawfish for sale!  Yummy!  I've never seen crawfish up here (and now I know why).  So I decided that I would make a crawfish boil the Louisiana way with potatoes and corn.  Well, I cooked the potatoes and corn in a big ole pot.  When it was time to add the crawfish, I opened the package and it smelled AWFUL!!!  I've made a crawfish boil many times and it had never smelled like that.  It smelled like they had been sitting in the garbage for weeks.  Yuck!  It definitely was not fresh from the bayou.  I decided to go ahead and clean them and add them to the pot and maybe it would smell better.  That made it worse.  Our place now reaked of rotting crawfish and seafood boil.  It was awful.  So we trashed the whole ordeal (after cooking the potatoes and corn for an hour already), disinfected the kitchen and made something else.  I learned my lesson about not buying crawfish up here.  Ewwww!  But you would think it would be OK since most of the shrimp up here comes from the Gulf.  Oh well.  We're going to make a trip to Pappadeaux when we go to Austin in June and have our fix.  Yesterday I was at school all day meeting my groups.  For one group, our project is to bring an energy drink to market so last night we each brought a different type of energy drink (red bull, etc.) and sampled them.  It didn't take long for us to be jumping off the walls!  It was quite funny.  This group is the most effective group I've had yet.  We are seven intelligent and strong women and the great ideas just kept pumping out.  We're having a lot of fun with this project.  We are even going shoot a commercial and radio spot for our drink.  Should be a blast!  I guess that's it for now.  I'm still feeling a little sick from that crawfish last night.  I didn't eat any of it but the smell made me incredibly sick.  And all those energy drinks!  It took me forever to fall asleep.  Ugh.  And it's Monday.  But it's almost April!  Yippee!

      It's Friday!  Yeah!  I was off on Monday but for some reason this week has been long.  I had a lot of school stuff going on this week and we have a busy weekend ahead.  Tonight we are going to meet with a realtor and she is going to show us some apartments and even a two story townhouse (I'm excited about that one).  We told her how picky we are and she said there were a lot of places available for what we want.  Yippee!  Maybe this apartment hunting won't be so bad.  Andrew has class on Saturday and then we'll be apartment hunting the rest of the day.  Sunday, I will be at school all day working on research and meeting with my groups.  Not a super exciting weekend.    I don't think I've mentioned this yet but I am working on a super cute Easter basket for Ashton.  Yes, I'm turning into my mom.  I know.  Anyway, I went to Pottery Barn kids a couple of weeks ago and found this super cute easter basket (the chick one):      Then I bought some bunny ears for him to wear and a little stuffed toy and some plastic easter eggs.  Since he's a baby, I can't fill the eggs with candy so I'm unsure of what to fill them with.  Any ideas?  It should be super cute!

      You know I almost forgot to mention the most important thing about my 1st anniversary.  The gift from the hubby!  Andrew got me the Venetian link necklace from Tiffany & Co.  Picture is below.  Isn't it pretty? (image deleted)

      Yawn...stretch... ahhhhhh... now I feel better!  What a great little break!  Our first anniversary was a good one.  Here's the recap of all of our exciting moments.  Grab the popcorn and some snuggly slippers because this is a long one folks...  On Friday after work I went and got my eyebrows waxed and the lady burnt me with the hot wax! (Tanya- don't use Lori!)  I had little bumps all over my forehead and they are just now going away.  After my waxing experience, I strolled down Newbury street in search of a cute top to wear for our anniversary dinner.  I found a cute little pink top at Jasmine Sola so I got that and headed home.  Andrew met me there and then realized as soon as he walked in the door that he had left my anniversary gift at work.  So he decided to head back up there and pick up pizza for dinner on the way back.  I originally had made a pot roast in the crockpot that night but we both got home too late to take it out so it was basically beef jerky by the time we opened it.  And it smelled funny.  Saturday morning Andrew headed to class at and I headed to the car wash to get the TSX all pretty for our road trip.  After a good soaking the car was ready and I drove over to my hair appointment with Daniel at Safar.  Daniel is great.  He is eastern european and is a perfectionist.  That's a good quality to have when you're a hairdresser.  He usually does an awesome job on my hair but you know how you go to the same person for so long that they get too comfortable with you and screw up your hair?  Well, that's what happened last time with Daniel so I wrote him off for awhile.  I decided to give him one more chance.  I really like him because I prefer male hairdressers.  I don't know why.  I don't like chatty hairdressers.  I like to sit there and relax and not feel like I have to talk to them.  Daniel is that way mainly because he is hard to understand.  LOL  But he does understand what I'm saying when it comes to hair.  It's a great relationship.  And my hair looks great this time!  I'm itching for some highlights so I think I'm going to try Tanya and Flynn's hairdresser for color.  She did a great job on their hair.    After meeting Andrew at Safar for his haircut, we headed out on the road to Providence.  It's a quick trip so we checked into the Marriott early and got in a great 3 hour nap before the concert.  We got ready to go and drove over to the Providence Place Mall for a quick bite to eat.  We got there and everywhere was at least a 2 hour wait and the concert started in 30 minutes so we resorted to the food court for a burger.  Ugh.  After finding our seats at the Dunkin Donuts Center, the show started and Guster performed a quick set.  They were an OK band but boy did I feel old!  Andrew and I were looking around and everyone around us was in their teens or early twenties!  We did scour and find some "older" couples (40+) but we did feel old.  You know you're getting old when the girl next to you is annoying you because she is loud and keeps taking your space.  LOL  Once John Mayer hit the stage, all was good.  He is a really great musician.  It's refreshing to see someone so talented and write their own music.  We were hoping that he would play our song (the one andrew read to me during his wedding speech) but he didn't.  He did play some good favorites and a little mix of some Justin Timberlake tunes (JT- who would think?).  After a great show, we proceeded to sit in traffic for what it seemed like forever.  We finally made it back to the hotel and settled into the hotel bar for a drink and some decent bar grub.  There must have been a wedding that night because there were a lot of drunk loud people there.  We finished our meal and "settled in" for the night....   Sunday morning we woke up and headed out to NYC.  The drive was fine until we got closer to the city.  There is heavy construction going on in Connecticut and we ended up taking a wrong turn.  It was a really wrong turn because it ended up taking us to Long Island.  After a 30 minute detour through Long Island and Queens we finally made it to the city.  We found great parking right away at 52nd and 5th so we parked and headed out for a stroll down Madison Avenue.  Have I ever said how much I LOVE New York?  It really is the greatest city on earth.  We spent hours going into the many amazing shops including the incredibly huge Bloomingdale's on Park Avenue (I'm talking 8+ stories people!).  I was on a mission for a new wallet but I didn't see the perfect one that afternoon.  We strolled into the Trump Tower and grabbed some coffee.  Trump Tower is pretty cool.  It's very tall and it's where they film "The Apprentice."  And of course, Trump had a large banner hanging from his building promoting his hugely successful show.  After we were pooped out from walking, we decided to grab the car and check into our hotel.  I had reserved us a room at the  urlLink Le Parker Meridien  hotel overlooking Central Park.  It was amazing.  They put us on the highest floor (by request) and we had the most amazing view of Central Park and the city. The hotel is very modern and was a fun place to stay at.  We relaxed for a bit and then got ready for a night out on the town.  One of my friends had recommended to us a place called  urlLink Tao Restaurant  on 58th street so I made a reservation.  We got there and it was a different mix of people.  It was definitely a "New York" type of place with the type of people that were there but there were also obvious tourists.  I like to call "obvious tourists" your typical American tourist because one thing sets them apart: jeans and tennis shoes.  I saw a few older couples that were probably from the midwest and one guy was even wearing a John Deere type of hat, farmer plaid shirt, dirty jeans and white tennis shoes.  Ugh.  When did people stop dressing up when they go out?  Of course, we were dressed to the nines.  Anyway, we had a few cocktails at the bar and then we were sat.  This place was SO cool!  It was three levels, the third level being a private party area.  The building was once a carriage house owned by the Vanderbilts.  There was a three story giant Buda with a cascading waterfall.  The place was amazing, the food was even better.  We ordered a bottle of Sake and started with the Peking Duck Spring Rolls and Lobster and Shrimp Dumplings.  I ordered the Wasabi encrusted Filet Mignon for dinner and Andrew ordered the Miso Glazed Sea Bass.  YUMMMM!  They both just melted in our mouths.  For dessert, we had the molten chocolate cake and I had some green tea.  It was a meal to die for.  After we had to be rolled out of the restaurant, we grabbed a taxi and headed back to the hotel to watch our wedding video.  The rest is history....  Now Monday.  I always hate to go home when you're having fun.  I could stay there forever!  Well, I could if it was free or we had an unlimited amount of money!  We slept in and then headed downstairs for some of the best breakfast in the city (voted #1 by New York Magazine), Norma's.  Yes it was true.  It was the best breakfast ever.  I had my usual breakfast fare, a belgium waffle with fruit on top but Andrew decided to order a creative dish.  He ordered the Chocolate French Toast.  It was three stacked pieces of french chocolate toast with chocolate syrup and strawberries in between each layer.  The top was a mess of goodies with fruit, cream and of course.. chocolate!  It looked very yummy.  After breakfast, we grabbed a taxi and headed to the Guggenheim Museum.  What a cool place!  We viewed and pondered over Picasso and some minimalists and impressionists.  It was quite a site.  Afterwards, we decided to metro it downtown for a little shopping in Soho.  I love Soho.  What a neat place!  There are so many good shops and the flagship store to who other than..... Kate Spade!  Of course, I HAD to go to Kate Spade so I did and I HAD to buy something so I did.  I got a really cute wallet!  I knew Kate wouldn't disappoint me!  After my splurge, we walked around Soho for awhile and went back to this suit shop that Andrew really loves.  He found a suit that was fairly priced and that he really wanted but he held back and bought a tie instead (a cool tie though).  A few more blocks of strolling and we decided to head back to the Metro station and start heading home.  We got back to the hotel and were starving so we decided to eat at this burger place that we heard about in the hotel.  Burger place, you ask?  In the Le Parker Meridien?  Yep there is, did I mention how much I love New York?  So you would never expect a burger joint to be in this hotel but if you look really closely behind a curtain behind the front desk, there is a small neon sign of a burger.  You follow the arrow behind the curtain and viola!  A burger joint!  Literally!  It was a small shack behind a curtain in a fine hotel.  Once you step inside this place, you feel like you are out in the woods in some small shack.  It was awesome!  They only serve burgers and fries but they are sooooooo good!  And cheap!  NYC rocks.  OK so I better wrap up this story...so after the awesome burgers, we grabbed our luggage from the bell stand and started to walk out to our car.  We got about half way and Andrew thought he had left the valet ticket to get our car inside the hotel.  So I swing around with my bag and guess who I run into???? Missy Elliot!!!  For those of you who don't know who she is, she is a very famous rap artist.  She is on MTV all the time.  I enclosed her pic below.  She just smiled at me and got into her Lincoln Navigators with her entourage of people.  It was cool!  I literally ran into Missy!  After my bout of excitement (she is really pretty by the way), we got our car and headed home.  On the way back, our Nav system acted up and accidentally took us on a 30 minute detour through Queens and Long Island, again.  We stopped at Cracker Barrel for dinner (yum!) and got home just in time to catch Las Vegas.  We had a great time and a wonderful anniversary!

      &^%&())&)(*_&$%#*&^*!!!!!!!!  That about sums up my week.  It has been absolutely crazy and stressful.  Sorry I haven't been on IM, I was trying to not get distracted.  And I promise to return some of your calls!  I had a huge case study due last night and some stuff due for my other class.  My teacher gave us another case study last night that's due next week so this next week will be another crazy one.  Agh!    I am soooo glad that it's Friday.  This weekend will be great!  Andrew and I are really looking forward to spending our anniversary together and having a little getaway.  I just wish it was somewhere tropical and warm!  It's so cold here this week.  My mom and dad were so sweet to overnight our cake to us.  We can't wait to enjoy it.  I did a little something special for Andrew yesterday and showed it to him last night.  He loved it!  I posted an online announcement on Boston.com which the online version of the Boston Globe.  Check it out  urlLink here .  Have a nice weekend everyone!

      So I know my post below sounded a little negative about Boston.  I have been negative lately because of the upcoming changes at my job and the fact that we are now crammed in our apartment and we need more space.  But let me tell you about all the GREAT things about Boston....  The culture, the history and the amazing people that live here Those crazy Boston accents  Best lobster in the world Everything is wicked cool- I still don't know what "wicked" means but its only unique to Boston! The food, the food, the food!   The diversity, its amazing Tanya's meatballs- to die for The passion people have for this city The North End- love it, love it, love it! LOTS of jobs- great job market New England Fall- absolutely gorgeous  I am forgetting a TON of stuff but this city is really great.  If only the cost of living would go down it would be perfect...  Oh yeah! and the RED SOX!

      Yeah I know.  Still no pictures.  I'm lazy.  And I won't be home much this week so you'll just have to wait!  This weekend went by so darn quick that I can't even remember what I did.  All I know is that I got 3 hours of sleep last night and I'm a zombie today.  I have class tonight so I need to get some caffeine pumping into my system. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Bare with me.  This is going to be long.  Hmmm, let's see.  Friday night, Andrew picked me up from work and we picked up Cheesecake Factory for dinner (i.e. no groceries in the house).  I am so frustrated at the Cheesecake Factory.  Their takeout people are idiots. While I am waiting in the car, Andrew goes in and they say our order isn't ready (even though it should have been 5 minutes ago).  Well, 30 minutes goes by and I go inside to see what the deal is and they had our order sitting on the counter the entire time!  We were both so mad.  The reason why I can call them idiots is because this is the 3rd time this has happened there.  The service is always cruddy and the food is not that great anyway (except for the salads, yummmmm) so it might be worth not going back there.  Well, at least until they bring back the Godiva chocolate cheesecake!  LOL  Saturday Andrew had a class so he headed out to school and I picked him after class.  We then drove out to Newton to go the newly opened Quiznos.  It's really funny, you never really know how much you miss something until its gone and Quiznos is no exception.  I used to eat there twice a week in Austin and they are just barely getting started in Boston.  Boston has really weird and strict zoning laws so they are always the last to get everything.  And my god!  Mass taxes everything!  We got a letter from Honda Finance "letting you know that you will be getting a $200 bill from the state for the annual auto excise tax."  Huh?  You've got to be kidding?  Where is my money going?  I already pay you a state income tax and you can't even patch up the roads around here?  I beginning to realize why this state is called "Taxachusetts."  Just ignore my frustrations.    So back to the lovely story....  We ate yummy Quiznos and then decided to drive around to different areas to start apartment hunting.  We are both so frustrated with the cost of housing here (aren't we all?) and how cruddy the housing is.  Our standards are very high because we keep comparing our old places in Texas (you know what I'm talking about Tara) and what you can get here.  We weren't going to move here back when the realtor was showing us around until we found the place we have now.  I cried when we were looking at places before we moved here.  They were UGLY, old and expensive.  It was horribly depressing but then the taxi took us lovely Hanover street and we were in love again.  Anyway, we checked out a few neighborhoods but none that super impressed us.  It's going to be a long, hard process for us both.  Saturday night I ran to the outlet mall to exchange something at the Banana Republic outlet (which is awesome) and realized that I need a super cool outfit to wear on our first anniversary this weekend.  No luck at the Bebe or Arden B outlets so I will have to keep searching this week.  I need something very "New Yorkish" since we will be in NYC the night of our anniversary.  Our current plans for the weekend are to see John Mayer in Providence Saturday night, stay at the Marriot Providence, drive to NYC the next morning and come home Monday evening.  I got us a great room in NYC at Le Parker Meridien overlooking Central Park so it should be a lot of fun.  My friend Melanie from school (the one who lived in NYC and was the PR person for Ralph Lauren) is getting us a reservation at this ultra hip Japanese restaurant that she went to last week.  Should be a nice treat!    Saturday evening I went and picked up Andrew after my quick outlet mall excursion and we grabbed a bite to eat at Pho Pasteur (still no groceries) and then we finally went to Whole Foods to pick up stuff for the week.  I just love Whole Foods.  I posted about it before so I wont rant and rave about it again but they are just so great.  Anyway, we got home and Andrew set up his drums.  Did I mention that Andrew re-arranged our living room so he could set up his drums?  We were crowded before but now we are really crowded!  It's ok.  I'll live with it until we move.  I know how bad he wants to play so I can deal with it.    Sunday, Andrew had to meet his group at 11am so I dropped him off and went to research a storage unit.  We have too much stuff so we decided to rent some storage space until we move this summer.  After doing my research I ran over to Target and the grocery store and then picked up Andrew from school.  We swapped places and he dropped me off at school.  I had two groups meeting so I was there pretty much the rest of the day.  I got home and we both made the best dinner!  We had bought some fresh Tuna steaks from Whole Foods so we grilled them with a wasabi and soy marinade and made a Greek salad.  We also bought some Sake from Whole Foods so we cracked that open and had the healthiest and yummiest dinner!  It was great.  I then had to work on some school stuff and finally drifted off to sleep at 3am after a weird phone call.  That's why I am a zombie today.  Not an eventful weekend but some frustrations to say the least.  This blog is so long it should count as 3 blog entries so I will write again later this week!  Have a great week everyone!

      I'm back!  And totally exhausted.  We had a great time and it was really hard to come back.  I should have pictures up tonight hopefully so stay tuned for those.    My test on Thursday night went great.  It was pretty easy as expected.  I got home from school that night and cleaned like a mad woman.  I ended up packing the next morning 10 minutes before we were supposed to leave for the airport so we cut it close to making our flight.  We met up with my brother in Denver and Andrew's parents picked us all up.  The weather was perfect!  Colorado has had a mild winter so Spring has sprung early.  Friday night we ate at PF Chang's in Park Meadows and then hung out at the Eckerman house.  Saturday morning, Tim, Jeremy and I drove down to Garden of the Gods to take some pictures.  Colorado Springs had gotten 4 inches of snow Thursday night so we thought the gardens would be gorgeous.  Well it was but we could hardly walk through it because it was so dang windy!  It had to be at least 50 mph winds.  The rest of the day we ran some errands and rented our skis.  Andrew ended up having to work all weekend so on Sunday morning, Tim, Jeremy and I drove up to Keystone and got a half day of skiing in.  The snow was powder, the weather was warm and the view was amazing.  We quit skiing around 4pm and decided to go snow tubing while we waited for Andrew and Cindy to drive up.  It was SOOOOO much fun!  Basically, you sit in a tube and they push/spin you down a really steep hill.  It was scary as hell but so fun!        Monday, we went skiing in Breckenridge which is where we were also staying.  The Mannings sold the house in Keystone so we no longer have a free place to stay.  No biggie.  We ended up staying for free at a hotel in Breckenridge just by attending a 90 minute timeshare presentation.  So the four of us (excluding Jeremy who stayed on the mountain skiing) went to the presentation.  Andrew and I had to attend a seperate one than Tim and Cindy because we lived in a different state.  I got to learn about how timeshares worked and what a great investment they were!  Basically you buy per week and you own that one week a year for the rest of your life!  It can even be passed down to someone in your will since it is deeded property.  And it doesn't cost that much.  For $10K, you can own one week every other year and it can be used at vacation properties all over the world. For that price, you get a one bedroom with a studio so if you "lock off" the studio, you actually get one week every year.  Not a bad deal I thought.  That investment pays for itself quick especially since some vacation properties are upwards of $400/night.  And you own it the rest of your life!  Sorry to be such a salesman but it sounded like a neat idea.  Tim and Cindy have two weeks in Hawaii and its been a great investment to them so far.    The skiiing in Breckenridge on Monday was OK, so on Tuesday we loaded up and went back to Keystone where the snow was perfect.  And it was hot!  Andrew ended up skiing in a T-shirt the entire time.  For lunch, we had a special treat at the top of the mountain at a super fine dining restaurant.  It's so high up that you have to take two Gondolas just to get there (I wonder how they get all the food up there?).  We had a nice 5 course lunch and then were well on our way to skiing back down.  I think we were too full from lunch because I fell like 3 times on the first run and had a case of the laughies (*new word- it means when you get lazy because you are laughing too hard).  Cindy, Andrew and I decided to ski to the bottom and Jeremy wanted to ski until the lifts closed.  Tim went off skiing with a friend and we all met up later that afternoon.  We then drove back to Colorado Springs that night and flew back home the next morning.    That about sums it up.  Vacations always go by way too fast.  And my face is really sunburn and peeling (ick).  I have the worst sunglass sunburn ever.  Oh well, back to the grind.

      Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  That's my update for today.  See ya.    Just kidding!  I know I need to update and it's about time I do so.  Well, nothing much is going on.  I stayed home and studied all weekend long.  Oh, did I mention that I *sneaked* out to the outlet mall on Sunday morning?  I couldn't help it, it was a warm and gorgeous weekend and I needed some sunshine.  I was home all day Saturday studying while the birds were chirping and people were walking their dogs and out and about.  I had to get out for awhile!  So we went for quick trip Sunday morning.  And this time, I didn't really buy much.  Andrew got some new shoes and I scored a cheap sweater from the Banana.  It was a nice break.  My first test was Monday and it was HARD!  I think I did OK but definitely did not make an A.  My hopes of graduating with a 4.0 are gone.  I just have too much going on right now.  But I love being busy.  I was so bored the first year we moved here mainly because we didn't know anyone but I also didn't have anything to do besides go to work.  I turned into a major homebody and got lazy.  I needed to turn that around.  Most of you know me!  I used to hate sitting around at home!  I always had to be doing something.  I think the older I get, the more I enjoy staying at home at relaxing.  And having Tivo definitely adds to relaxing.  Today is my second test and I think I will do pretty good.  I have a some notecards to memorize at work today but otherwise, I know my marketing concepts pretty well and it should be somewhat easy.  BUT tomorrow we leave for Colorado!  Yippee!  I am so excited.  I checked the snow forecast and its going to be perfect ski conditions.  They are getting pounded by snow now and it should be in the 40's next week which is PERFECT ski weather.  I'll be skiing in a long sleeve T-shirt!  I'm also really excited that my brother Jeremy is going with us.  I really miss him and it will be great spending some time with him.  This will be his second time skiing with us so I know he's excited too.  We are driving up Sunday night to go snow tubing in Breck and then we'll ski at either Breckenridge, Keystone or Vail depending on the snow accumulation at each.    Well that's all for now folks.  I won't be blogging until next Thursday when I am back to work so I hope everyone has an awesome weekend!  I will be sure to post some pics from Colorado when I return.  Tootles!     Oh- and I invented a new word this week.  I first used it at school with a bunch of friends and then yesterday at work.  Everyone thought it was a hoot.  Mind Fart = whenever your mind goes blank and you can't remember what you just thought about (hee hee)

      Super quick update since I'm about to head out of here.  My final class is tonight and we are presenting our project. I am really excited about this one!  It's awesome!  I will talk more about it next week when I get back into the office (I'm off work until Wednesday).  All the fam is on their way here and Andrew will be "officially" done with school on Saturday!  Yay!  Have a great weekend everyone!

      Wow, everyone's blogs are so outdated.  I guess we are all just very busy.  I am working on my final projects that are due next week and also trying to fix my stolen wallet situation.  Yep, my wallet was stolen.  It happened on the T on the way home on Tuesday.  It was obviously a professional and they were targeting someone and it just happened to be me.  I still don't know how it happened, it was so quick.  Tanya was even with me but we think we know who did it.  Well, not who but just what they look like.  Anyway, I had to cancel my cards, my checking account and get a new license and school ID.  They ran up $3000 on my cards in one hour.  They were good.  They hit CVS and bought $500 worth of cigarettes, some jewelry in Chinatown and junk at a gas station.  All within an hour!  It sucked.  But the good news is that everyone will be here next weekend for Andrew's graduation!  Yippee!  He's actually at school right now as I type presenting his last project and then he's done!  I still can't believe it.  He's been in school for so long.  Actually, since 1997 to be exact.  I always tease him that he's a professional student.  LOL  Anyway, everyone is getting here next Friday.  My parents are getting here late next Thursday evening but I won't get to see them until Friday since my final project is that same night.  And I think my group is going to have drinks afterwards.  We'll see.  I'll just be glad to be done with this semester!

      G' day everyone!  I am in somewhat of a good mood.  I took my final exam last night and its over with...  it's mid April which means it's almost summer...  Andrew finishes his MBA next week... my family will be here in two weeks... and we are going to Austin soon!  It's all good.  ;o)  Well, other than this cold and rainy month we are having.  Actually, we got snow the first week of April so that was a shocker.  But it's finally warming up (and by warming I mean into the 50's).  50 degrees isn't too bad around here.  It seems a lot colder when it's 50 in Texas but for some reason it's pretty warm here.  55 is jean jacket weather which ain't too bad.  I'm praying to the weather gods to make sure it's pretty and warm when my family gets here in a couple of weeks.  My mom already mentioned that she packed away her winter stuff (which means the few sweaters that she owns, lol) so I hope they don't freeze.  And Cindy will be coming from Hawaii (she's there now) so the temp change will be hard on her at first I'm sure.  Ah well.  I am finally able to hear again.  My head was completely clogged all last week.  My doctor gave me an antibiotic so maybe that helped.  Andrew has been sick with a nasty (and I mean nasty literally) viral infection.  He was in bed Friday through Sunday, part of the time with a fever.  Poor thing.  I think he works himself too hard and his body just shuts down sometimes.  I think he should just sleep more (4 hours a night ain't enough honey) and rest more but I know he's running a thousand miles a minute trying to finish up everything.  Ah well.  Back to the grind...

      I know I haven't been updating my blog but not much happened in the past week.  I've been home sick since last Thursday and finally made it to the doc this morning to get some antibiotics.  It's only a sinus infection but it made me ill all weekend.  I missed my class on Thursday and work on Friday due to this sickness so I'm playing catch up right now.    Only four more weeks of school for me and only three more for Andrew!  I know he is very ready to be done with school.  The man has been in school for over 7 years!  His graduation is coming up on May 1st and I'm hosting a dinner at his favorite restaurant for our friends and family who are coming into town to attend.  Should be fun.  I just hope it isn't cold.  It was snowing this morning (yes, snow) and is freeeeeeezing and very windy outside.  Not worth leaving the building.    The next few weeks are going to be insane so I won't be around as much.  I have a huge test in my research class next week and we are finishing up two big projects.  Agh!  Have a great week everyone!

      I am such a dope.  I still haven't booked a hotel and rental car for Austin and it's next weekend!  I thought it wouldn't be a big deal but everything is already sold out!  It's kinda odd that almost every hotel in Austin is sold out so I called a local Marriott and asked them about it.  They said there is a huge Harley Davidson rally in Austin next weekend and people will be here from all over the nation so most everyone is sold out.  Huh?!?!  We're screwed so I guess we'll be staying with my brother all weekend or I will have to use priceline.  :o(  Tonight is my first night of summer school.  I am taking a class on Consumer Behavior in Summer I and Intro to Marketing Communications in Summer II.  I am a bit nervous about the first class because I have so much going on this month so hopefully it won't be too demanding.  The only thing that sucks about my summer classes is that no one I know will be in them.  Oh well.  Good chance to meet more cool peeps.  Good news today!  There a Nordstrom finally coming to Boston!  Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's are my two favorite department stores.  I like them because they have the low to high end brands so you get a good selection at decent price ranges.  All I can think about is shopping today.  I get that way before big trips because I want to look my cutest but I've been good lately and haven't bought anything in awhile.  I am trying to prepare myself for being jobless and having no money.  But I have a job now so I got a cute springy green jacket at lunch today.  It's super duper cute and will match my seven jeans pretty good.  Watch out world!

      Good Monday everyone.  I am sitting here at my desk wearing my jacket because it's SOOO cold in here!  About two weeks ago, we had a little heat wave here in Boston and the inside sales guys thought it was too warm so they asked maintenance to turn down the AC.  They must have turned it to 40 degrees!  I am so cold.  My desk feels like an ice cube.  It's also because it's so darn cold outside.  We also had a really cold weekend (you really missed out Tanya).  It never got above 55 all weekend.  I had to work the Show House all day Saturday and got stuck outside in the cold and rain.  Yuck. Best part is I think I'm getting a cold now.  Yesterday was nothing exciting either.  We had someone come and look at the apartment so I had to clean and then I headed to Hunt's to pick up some film for my two big weekends coming up.  I also picked up a really cool camera bag that will hold all my lenses and my digital camera, all of it's parts and my SLR camera.  That was the big excitement for the day.  It's a pain in the rear to haul all my camera parts so I needed something for that.  I also picked up the new Sex & the City DVD: Season 6, Part 1 as well as the new Hoobastank CD and a cute book titled "The Devil wears Prada" for reading on the plane the next two weekends.  Very exciting weekend I must say.  The next two will be much better though. :o)  So on Friday Tara discovered the wonders of 7 for all mankind jeans.  She emails me and says "Aren't these jeans awesome?"  Why yes they are Tara.  They aren't cheap but they do wonders for your hips and butt.  I bought my first pair over a month ago and I must say it was the best decision.  They are amazing!  If you've never seen or heard of them,  urlLink check them out  for yourself.  The founders are the ex-Levi's creative director and the ex-Gap head of denim. Pretty cool.  My next pair will be the dark wash with the Pink stitching and pink "A" on the back pockets.  They are super cute.    Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Ugh, it's Monday but it's a going to be a great week!  Lots to do and lots of events coming up.  Jess and Paul's wedding is on Saturday so that's exciting even though we won't be there.  I have a lot of junior league meetings going on this week.  Tonight we have our general membership meeting where we can go to learn about all the projects for next year.  I haven't decided what to do yet so the meeting will be very informative.  On Thursday evening I have a junior league communications meeting at Summer Shack, all fun, no work.  Then on Saturday I will be working at our  urlLink Show House  all day long.  The junior league show house is really, really cool.  If you love home decorating or home shows like Trading Spaces, you would love the show house.  Basically, the junior league goes out and finds a large usually historic home and then designers all over New England bid on different rooms to decorate.  After it's all completed, we open up the house to the public and sell admission tickets.  It's our biggest fundraiser and it's a wonderful way to get ideas on home decorating.  The cool thing about every room is that everything is for sale.  Well this year it's at the Commandant's House at the Charlestown Navy Yard and I had to work it yesterday.  The rooms are amazing!!!!!  My job for four hours was the third floor (the house is four stories!!).  I was in charge of the bridal room, the nursery, the navigation room, the nautical room and the novel room.  Each room was so incredibly detailed and awesome.  Especially the bride's room.  The entire room was white with hints of lavender.  It was definitely my taste.  One designer downstairs dedicated an entire room as a modern looking martini room.  It was very cool.  Anyway, my job was to guard the third floor and make sure noone touched or stole anything.    When I got home last night, I checked my email and Becca had sent me some samples of her bridal pictures. Doesn't she look absolutely gorgeous?!?!

No, we're not going to Hawaii (I wish!), Michelle and Ashton are coming to Colorado for three weeks so we're going to pop in for a few days to visit them and I'm going to take a thousand pictures of him.  I'm bringing the entire camera set up!  And Becca's wedding is the weekend after.  We're going to be so exhausted and broke by the time July rolls around.  Oh well.  So that's my news for the day.  Hope everyone's day is going well!  Today it's a gorgeous 82 degrees in Boston!  Here's a recent cute picture of Ashton:

      Yeah, I know.  It's been awhile since I've updated so here I am.  Let's see, when I last left you I was about to head to class to present my final project.  Well, our presentation was awesome and we kicked some booty and I got an A in that class.  To celebrate, we all went out to PF Changs afterwards and stayed out way too late.  I didn't realize that PF Changs is open until midnight!  I got home to a super clean apartment that Andrew had been working on all day.  What a sweetie.  His parents were coming at 6am the next morning so we finished up some last minute things and fell to bed.  The next morning his parents got there at 6am sharp and crashed on our air mattress.  Their flight had left Denver at midnight so it was a long night for them.  That afternoon I met up with my parents for lunch and then we headed to the airport to pick up Jeremy.  The next day was Andrew's graduation.  We all slept in and made our way to the graduation.  It was nice but Boston College was definitely nicer.  They didn't even read the graduates names at the ceremony!  Who doesn't do that?!?!  Anyway, afterwards we headed to our fav restaurant for a dinner celebration with friends and family at Stephanie's on Newbury.  The next day, my fam, andrew's fam and of course, me and Andrew drove up to Salem to see witches and goblins.  We hung out there for the day touring the city then had a lavish dinner at Legal Seafood's that night.  My brother took off on Monday and the rest of the fam left on Tuesday.  We all had a great time.    This past weekend was pretty interesting.  Saturday night was Jessie's bachelorette party (see Tanya's blog for pics).  For Jessie's last hurrah, she wanted us all to dress up in goth clothing and go to this goth club.  Well, if you know me, you know that I don't own much black (and Tanya would NOT let me wear all pink!) so I had to do some shopping.  I scored a pretty cute outfit that I would wear again (but not together).  Tanya also planned a "kinky" toy party (if you know what I mean) beforehand which was a lot of fun.  The goth club turned out to be a gay club and it was 80's night.  I'm sure we looked pretty scary going in there but we had a lot of fun.  And I swear the bartender was a witch, she kinda looked like one.

      I know, I know.  This thing is sooooo outdated but I have a good excuse!  The past month has been so busy with school stuff.  Last night was my last class for Summer I and we presented our final project to the class.  It was really good!  I'm really enjoying this program but part of me still wants to get my MBA.  Maybe in time, we'll have to see.  I am at that point of my career where I need to make some choices on where to go and what to do next.  I'll be 26 this August and although I feel like Andrew and I are successful thus far in our lives, I feel like I need way more.  So that's my goal for the next two months, craft out a timeline and set goals for my life.  I've never had a "dream" job (well, other than being a rock star or race car driver, lol) so I think it's time to think of one and make it happen.  I'll keep you posted.  :o)  Summer II starts next Wednesday so I have one week off of school.  YG gave us Friday off for "employee appreciation day" so I now have a four day weekend!  I was trying to convince Tara to come visit like she did last year but we haven't found any cheap last minute fares.  Boo.  I think we'll just take it easy this weekend and maybe take a day trip up to Maine, Newport or something.  We're also going to look at new TVs for our bedroom.  We currently don't have one because our bedroom is not wired for cable but our new place is wired so we've decided to get one and a second TiVo (birthday idea mom!).  Andrew got a lot of birthday money this year so we decided to get a 21' flat-panel/widescreen HDTV for both of our birthdays.  Yay!  :D  One of the groups that presented last night talked about www.upromise.com.  I've heard of it but I didn't realize what a great program it is.  Basically, it's kinda like idine.com but instead they give you money towards college.  It's free to sign up and there are many participants in the program.  Here's how it works: You sign up for free on upromise.com and register all of your credit/debit cards, your store shopping cards (CVS, etc.) and everytime you make a purchase at a participating retailer, they will give you cash back into your upromise account.  Then you can use that cash back towards college expenses.  It can be for whoever you want: you, your brother, your mom, your cousin, even your future child!  It's not a huge savings and obviously it takes awhile for a decent amount to rack up but why not do it?  It's free!  They said on their presentation that an average American family making $60K a year and that will buy a house and car in the next 15-20 years will accumulate an average amount between $13-26K.  Not too shabby.  I urge you to sign up and put the money away towards someone who will attend college in the next 10-20 years (like grandchildren, mom?).  You can even roll that money into a 529 savings plan.  Nice!

      I know you're probably wondering what happened to my blog.  Well, the site that used to host my blog design went out of business so my blog didn't work anymore and all my links got deleted.  I grabbed this template from blogger but I need to go and change all my settings and I don't have time this week.  I have a huge test tonight that I am trying to cram for at work so I have to go.

      What a great weekend!  We just had a wonderful weekend visiting the Eckermans in Colorado and this weekend we will be at Becca's wedding which I am really looking forward to.  If you know Becca, you know she puts on a great party!  Anyway, this past weekend we flew into Denver where Tim and Cindy picked us up and then we got some lunch and headed to the Springs.  When we got home, Ashton was awake and happy as he could be to see us.  He has grown so much since we last saw him!  He is seven months and already has 5 teeth growing in and is on the verge of crawling.  We think he will skip crawling and go straight to walking because he is so determined.  The kid is so funny.  He thinks he can walk but when he tries, he falls on his butt!  I had a lot of fun playing with him.  We walked all over the house together and he was exploring everything.  We took a nap together on the couch, read his favorite books and I even taught him a few things on Andrew's drums.  I took a ton of pictures (of course!) so I will attach some when I get the chance.  It was hard to say goodbye to him because he is such a cutie!  Three more days until Texas!  Yay!

      First day of the DNC went pretty well. It was actually a ghost town around here. Kinda weird. No troubles getting into work or leaving school. Security was everywhere around our building but only because there were a lot of protestors marching down the street. Andrew came and met me for lunch and then he headed downtown to buy some books. He said there were protestors down there screaming using profanity at everyone for shopping while there was a war going on. Ridiculous. My only complaint about the DNC so far was the big fireworks show right above us at 12 AM!!!!!!!! I'm sorry but 10pm is ok, they did that the night before but 12 AM?!?! Come on. I awoke and thought there was a bomb dropping on Boston.  We had our first round of presentations last night and of course, we rocked. I love to do PowerPoint presentations and I make them damn good. It seems like noone else really puts forth a lot of effort these days on presenting. I don't know, maybe its the marketing in me or maybe its because I'm anal. We were polished and it went very smoothly. Next week we will be getting into the creative side of the campaign which will be a lot of fun. We are working on different guerilla marketing techniques. I am having a hard time thinking out of the box. Usually, I'm really good at that but I've had way too much on my mind (those of you know what I'm talking about) in the past two weeks. Hopefully, my group will come through with some break through ideas this week.   In honor of the DNC, check out this video. It's really, really, really funny. It will take awhile to load especially if you have dial-up but it's so worth it. Turn up the volume but be careful if you're at work, there are a few dirty words.

       I know, I'm outdated but its been a busy week!&nbsp; School&nbsp;and work are&nbsp;keeping me very busy.&nbsp; I'm actually at home on a Friday evening working on my project.&nbsp; Fun times.&nbsp; Tomorrow we'll be packing up the apartment and then&nbsp;we're heading to dinner in Cambridge with some friends.&nbsp; Sunday is filled with more packing and then I'm meeting my group in the PM to practice our first presentation (we have to give three total).&nbsp; This project is a ton of work but also lots of fun.&nbsp;   Downstairs there is an Italian festival going on and the concert stage is set up right below our window, literally.&nbsp; It's been hard to concentrate with all of that racket going on.&nbsp; Andrew also discovered that he could TiVo all of the old Beavis and Butthead episodes so guess what he's doing right now?&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; I've got my headphones on listening to one of my favorite CD's, Esthero.&nbsp; I've added it to my current listening list.&nbsp; It's a mix of lounge music and acid jazz.&nbsp; It's an awesome CD, I recommend it (and you can listen to clips on that amazon link).&nbsp; "Anywayz" is such a great driving song,&nbsp;"country living" is cool&nbsp;and "that girl" is just catchy.&nbsp; Well it's time to get back to work.&nbsp; I will write again next week when things hopefully slow down around here.&nbsp; Tootles!

      I forgot to mention that Andrew tried out for the Apprentice- Season 3 on Saturday! I went along just to see what it was all about. There weren't that many people there and they assigned you a wristband and took you in groups of 8 people for group interviews. The interviews were by Casting Directors and it seemed like they were looking for TV personalities rather than business people. Oh well, it was fun to see the spectacle. He has a "real" job interview this week with a company that he really wants to work for so we'll see how that goes. Wish him luck!

      Good day everyone! Mondays are never fun and today I am so tired. I think I pulled a muscle in my back this morning so that's no fun either. :o(   This weekend was very low key. We planned on moving everything out of our storage locker on Saturday in order to save some money but once we got there and remembered how much stuff was in there, we decided it was worth the money to keep it in there for two more weeks. Yep, less than two weeks before we move and we are so ready.   So nothing special going on but I did want to remind all of you to watch The Simple Life&nbsp;2 on Wednesday. Paris and Nicole will be in Austin working for the Round Rock Express (Austin's minor league baseball team). The previews look pretty funny! Ciao for now!  &nbsp;   urlLink  &nbsp;

      You know, what's the deal with this "low carb" fad diet that's going on?  Yeah I know that lower carbs will help you loose weight but it seems these days that everything is labeled as "low carb."  Most of you know that I'm really into nutrition and that I secretly wanted to be a private practice nutritionist but didn't want to go through all of the schooling.  Maybe someday when I have my midlife crisis I will change professions and that will be the one I choose.  But my plans still remain to become a very successful businesswoman and then leverage my skills and knowledge to open up my own small business.  We all have to create goals for ourselves or else we'll just float through life.  That's the plan for now.  It always changes though.  Last night my group had it's first call with Aloha Treasures.  For my summer II class, we had to choose a small business that needed a marketing plan put together so I thought Cindy's business would be perfect.  The call went very well and it was a great way to introduce the concept to the team.  I'm looking forward to this project and hopefully our campaign will match Cindy's goals and budget.  Should be fun.  You may have noticed on the right hand side that Bergdorf Blondes has been taken off my reading list.  That's because I finished it (duh).  It was pretty good.  If you like books about NYC society girls then you would love it.  It was a cute and fun read but not super inspiring.  I've now started on "Can you keep a secret?" which so far is really good.  It's about this girl who is a marketing professional and is on her way back from a meeting when she meets this stranger on the plane and tells him all of these secrets about her company and her life.  Most of which are really bad and really dirty.  When she arrives back to her office, she learns that he is the new CEO of her company!  I've only read one chapter but it's pretty cute so far.  I'm also reading my textbook for school which is not super exciting but so far it's pretty good and not your typical textbook.    Oh and one more thing.  I actually learned to play the drums this weekend!  For real!  Since Andrew is a drummer, he always has a kit set up and I like to tap and play around on it but this weekend we went further and he taught me how to play.  I can actually keep a beat with my hands and feet ladies and gents, just not very good timing.  The kick drum part is definitely the hardest part.  I'm working on it and soon enough I'll be on tour with Justin Timberlake.  Hee hee.

      What a nice weekend!  I didn’t do anything special but it was nice nonetheless.  Today Andrew and I went and saw Spiderman 2 which was really good.  I think it was better than the first one despite Kirsten’s attempt at acting again (I am so not a Kristen Dunst fan).  Anyway, I highly recommend seeing it in the theaters before it leaves because of some great action sequences.  Afterwards, we trotted over to Copley and did a little shopping.  Andrew got a really great tie for super cheap; I got some naughties at Victoria’s Secret and then my cool new laptop bag at Sony that I mentioned the other day.  I justified the cost of it because I did a really cool thing.  You see I bought my laptop in Mass last weekend and we got our TV in NH.  I decided that I was driving to NH to return and buy back my laptop in order to save $100 in taxes.  When I called to make sure that I could do that, the girl just went ahead and did it over the phone!  I got back $100!  Score!  So I decided to buy that bag I wanted.  Here it is:    I went with green because #1 I’m really into green right now and #2 it was the only cute one that my laptop would fit into to.  So I am really happy with it and it’s really hip and light with my computer in it.  After our little shopping spree, we headed over to PF Chang’s for dinner for some Chang’s Spicy Chicken and Moo Shoo Chicken.  It was very yummy.  :o)  Good evening!

      It's official.  I am addicted to reality TV.  I wasn't going to get myself dragged in but now I can't help it.  I should be checked in.  My two fav shows right now are The Simple Life 2 and Newlyweds.  Nicole Richie is so hilarious in Simple Life but Paris is so-so. She always says "that's hot" to everything which kinda gets on my nerves but Nicole is a riot.  Jessica is just plain blonde on Newlyweds but I like her because she's a Texas girl and her house is incredible (although she could use a decorator).   On this past week's show, Jessica and her BF (lingo for best friend) went and got lasik eye surgery.  I was seriously considering getting that done in August but after seeing the show, I'm having second thoughts. It was so gross!  Mom and dad are moving into their rent house tomorrow.  Looks like they will be stuck there until the end of January.  But that's ok because they are moving into Vic's subdivision and next one down from Tara's parents.  Score!  Wish I was there to help you guys move!  Good luck!  I don't have much going this weekend other than not spend money because of our little technology investments from last weekend.  I think we'll catch a movie or two or I'll start working on my next school project.  Speaking of working, Tanya and I found the cutest laptop bags at the Sony store in the mall today.  Check them out  urlLink here .  I think I want the pink circles bag.  They are pretty expensive but they are guaranteed for life with a one year money back guarantee so that's pretty cool.  I think I might score one this weekend (so much for not spending money, right?).  Smile and have a good one everyone!

      What a nice weekend.  Didn't really do much but got a lot accomplished in four days.  Here's a recap of my weekend:  Friday:  Slept in (ahhhh, nice!).  Andrew had an interview downtown so we grabbed some lunch at the Living Room and I headed down to the Theater District to pick up our movie tickets for that evening.  As I got off the T to walk home, it started to pour and I didn't have an umbrella.  And it was raining cats and dogs.  I jumped from store to store trying to make it during the small breaks between showers and eventually it started to hail so I had to hang out under a liquor store until it stopped.  Needless to say, I got home drenched.  That evening, we met the TP's (code name for Tanya and Tommy Pimental) for dinner and went to see Dodgeball.  Great movie, I recommend seeing it.    Saturday:  Slept in (again, nice).  Ran and got lunch at Sorelle.  For those Bostonians, we have a new fav sandwich place in Charlestown, Sorelle.  They make the BEST sandwiches.  It's over close to Olives next to the new Marriott.  It's now our weekend lunch addiction AND there is a cold stone creamery next door.  :o)  Anyway, we had an apppointment to finally see our new apartment at 1pm so we grabbed lunch quickly and headed over to Cambridge.  Our new apartment is pretty nifty.  It's definitely bigger than our current place and we will finally have more closet room and our own W/D.  The kitchen has a lot of cabinet space which I'm very excited about and it has a full size dishwasher (yay!).  They redid the pool area this year and it looks pretty awesome!  Can't wait to get out there.  I'm finally excited and ready to move even though we'll miss our quaint little neighborhood.    After we finished up at our new place, we headed over to Circuit City to look at TV's again.  I think I mentioned before that we've decided to get a new LCD flat panel TV for our bedroom.  We're checking out the stores every weekend until we find a really great deal before we buy.  We didn't find a great deal so we headed over to look at the laptops.  I have been in great need of a new computer for a very long time.  I have my dad's hand-me-down notebook which I am extremely grateful for but it's getting close to being 6 years old and is having some major problems.  I decided to use my tuition reimbursement money from work and get a new one.  I was looking around at all of them and this very nice sales person came over to help.  Turns out he is from Corpus Christi and went to Texas A&M so we had a lot to chat about.  I wasn't too impressed with the selection they had so I decided to hold off and look online at the Dells again until he told me that they had a shipment come in that day and to hold off a sec.  I'm glad that I waited because he brought out two beautiful Sony Vaio's that were introduced last week.  To sum everything up, I got the new Sony Vaio S-series widescreen notebook.  I am so in love with it and it weighs only four pounds!  Seriously, it weighs the same as my purse!  I am very happy with it.  Here's a  urlLink link  to it.  We really didn't do anything that evening other than play around with my laptop which was fine by me.  :o)  Sunday:  Slept in (see a theme?).  We also made blueberry waffles and bacon for breakfast(YUM!).  We decided that we didn't want to be around Boston the fourth of July because of the crowds so we wanted to get away for the day somewhere.  I told Andrew to choose somewhere we haven't been before to explore and he chose New Hampshire.  Our plans were to drive into Manchester for lunch and the head up to Concord to see the capital and the drive through Portsmouth for dinner on the way home.  Well, NH was a joke, at least on a holiday like the 4th.  Manchester was not that nice and everything was closed.  We ended up having lunch at Jillians (kinda like a Dave & Busters) and then we headed up to Concord.  That was also not too exciting.  Noone there, nothing to do.  I could see NH being really nice during the Fall but we just picked the wrong time to come.  After our little excursion, we decided to head back home but then I remembered the greatest thing about NH, NO sales tax on anything!  We had to stop here and look at TV's, it would save us a great deal of money if we didn't have to pay tax.  So we stopped at Circuit City and found the exact TV we were looking for AND it was on sale AND no tax!  We couldn't pass it up and we could easily return it to our local CC if we changed our mind or found it cheaper somewhere else.  When we got home, we searched the net like crazy and eventually found out that we got an amazing deal at CC so we decided to keep it.  It is a 22 inch  urlLink Samsung LCD  Flat Panel TV with HDTV.  We watched some movies on it last night and the picture quality is unbelievable.  When we move, we will request a special cable box from our cable company that will be a HDTV compatible box so we can get the HDTV channels.  Can't wait to see what they look like!  The rest of the evening was low key.  We watched the fireworks on TV and from our window and played with our new toys. :o)  Monday:  Monday was very low key.  The weather was cruddy so Andrew worked and I finished up some last minute paper source projects, packed away my winter clothes to put in storage and cleaned up our place a bit.  That's about it.  Now I am back at work and ready for the weekend.    Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday weekend!

      Happy July!  It's finally here!  And today I have good news.  My parents are building a new house!!  They sold their house last week and are moving next Saturday into a rent house until their new house is built.  I am so excited for them that I had to share the floor plans with you all.  Here it is:   urlLink The New House   They are getting the 1st house (elevation #1) and should be in by Jan/Feb.  Yay mom and dad!  :o)  So today we celebrated my boss's birthday and Tanya and I decorated his cube.  Tanya and I have this thing for decorating people's cubes.  We decided that we are now cube decorators for hire in case anyone wants to hire us on our office.  What a fun job that would be!  Anyway, our boss (Rob) was completely surprised and thankful.  We also walked over to Krispy Kreme at lunch and picked up a dozen glazed donuts and some vanilla ice cream for making my new dessert invention: the Krispy Kreme Sundae.  Basically, its a heated up glazed donut with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and then whatever topping you want.  Today we choose chocolate chips.  YUM!
