      muzik: "Warsaw" -Swing Kids  so, ive recently been reading this book from crimethinc. called Evasion. is short, its the raddest, most illinest, and all-around tubular book i have read in a long, long time. as my first act of non-english class mandatory drudgery, i think im off to a good start.   its about a nineteen year-old straight edge punk who travels from Oregon to Minnesota by himself starting out with just under 40$. he hops freight trains and chills with hoboes, all the while shoplifting and dumpstering about ninety percent of his food. when it rains, he goes through back doors into college computer labs and listens to Chain of Strength while using the internet. god. i wish i was that guy. even though that sort of life is unsustainable, what not having a job, or a house... or money... it would be a nice challenge to see if i could survive like that for a little bit. when i turn 18 and graduate, its on!  so, keeping with that ghetto-ass theme, my grunge-master friend and i decided to do some salvaging of our own... illegal-style. we heard of this store, Big Lots on Mendo, that supposedly throws out DVD players and other cool, useful things. we walked across town and hit that shit up. opening a truck trailer, we were dismayed to find it empty, and promptly got the hell out of compton seeing as how the store wasnt even closed yet and we made a fairly large amount of noize. as consollation, we found a half used can of spray paint behind Community Market and proceded to... paint the town! actually, we both deathly suck at doing that sort of thing so it actually wasnt that epic. but still ridiculously fun, only heightened because of its blatant illegality. accomplices are welcome for our next expedition; partners in crime are always appreciated.  life is good for the moment. being more ghetto and loitering on corners is the way to enjoy summer. now we just need some 40's... hmmm. that and more crew members to be ghetto with. anyway, sign up now, itll be fun.  in other news: today is a nice day, all grey and cold. there need to be more days like this. going to get F-9/11 presale tickets today. somebody ILL, come with me.

      time to open some windows, its dark in here.  "cassini is the most sophisticated interplanetary space probe ever. it will embark on a four year mission to survery saturn's moons, even passing by phoebe and titan." i want to work for NASA. space travel is hott!  so, summer certainly has kicked off with a bang. actually no, but it doesnt really matter. i cant wait for nikos and sean to get back from korea. then hopefully things will pick up... they cant help to. theres nowhere to go but up. if going to the JC means these first two weeks of summer stretched out over two years, i really dont think that i want any part of that. i think id rather die than have such a huge expanse of dead time. maybe doing school for one year really does outweigh being comatosely bored for two. hmmm.  i dont even know. there are like 6 more weeks or something of summer. leaving santa rosa needs to be in order. perhaps, if the necessary permission slips are returned, some sort of a road trip to like... washington... could be done. if not, maybe i should just blow my savings account on a trip to like tokyo. now THAT would be awesome.   speaking of which, i need to move to japan.  but yeah. this summer painfully illustrates the extent to which i have no actual connections to anybody in my life. friends are friends, and nothing really more. the notion of best friends is kind of dead now, nor does it really even matter. nothing ever gets done and feelings are never expressed. its sad, but for that at least, there is nobody to blame but myself. over the years ive never done enough to establish stong bonds with people, friends or otherwise. things simply drag on and i accept them, even when they make me miserable or cross. life is a series of drifting into peoples' orbits, and then drifting back out, never really taking or feeling any different than you did going in. which isnt to say that things remain unchanged. simply, its not an external movement, all of this. its a matter of changing inside, but the failing to relate that to how i deal with other people. people never really know whats going on, which is probably a good thing, but doing that makes life a hollow repetition of feeling dead and being alone. i dont know. i need to leave this shit. everything about this town, this state, the people i know- all of it makes me hate myself and everybody else for making me feel that way. its not their fault, its mine, and i just cant wait for this goddamn year to be over and be able to leave this all behind me. this really shouldnt be written online, but i dont mind. we fight our own wars, thank you very much.  muzik: converge "a farewell note to this city"

      muzik: my own damn heartbeat (beating fast now because of stress and caffeine) and iron monkey.  if there were one person in the world whose life i could have, well, there would be many, but at the top of my list would be james bond.   nothing much more to say in regard to that.  oh, but wait: dad says that its high time that either a: i get some fucking zoloft, or b: shut the fuck up. pleasant. having parents that wish you were someone else is awesome, though i'm aware that im not the only person in that situation. life is iLL when people dont give a shit about you.  anyway, third hand information is great. i wish that was the only kind that i ever heard, but, with the way that things are going, it probably will be before not too terribly long. everybody hates everybody and nobody talks shit to anybodies face. this makes sense, but wouldnt life be so much easier if people just shut the fuck up and said what they thought. i think so, but then again, i suppose im not really involved in such business anymore anyway. cheers to being discarded.  A DREAM DEFERRED. not only a langston hughes poem, i can make it a lifestyle.  being passive is kind of an odd affliction. you don't generate direct anger towards yourself because nobody really has a reason to if you never involve yourself. on the other hand, resentment can build if somebody takes issue with how you act, or dont act. e nonaction is worse because you leave people in the dark about where they stand in a situation. very recently ive gotten myself into trouble by living like this. my take: people are stupid and i hate them!  catharsis is supposed to make you feel better. after writing this, i feel a lot worse. thus, i think stopping this is in order. judge me as you will; "you can take my life, but you'll never take my freedom." i love braveheart. le fin.

      Madness! best damn ska band ever to come out of England in the 80's. "dont look at that [remember, you're LISTENING to it] look at this... for all of you coming off the street, now you feel the heat, and its time that you moved your feet to the monster, nutziest rock steady beat of Madness... one step beyond..."  so, as above mentioned, today was a day of punkass hijinks on the streetz of santa rosa. my grunge-master friend was there as we were biking through Indian Village and the "187" 7-11 over by Piner. We got the mad looks from all of the gangsta kidz that were riding their chromed-out bikes with the chain steering wheels and rimz. i was wearing yellow so i wasn't quite sweatin' it in terms of the Sur 13's versus the Norte 14's, that is, unless there were some CRX's or Integra's crusing around with some 1337 Azn's inside... but they're on my side secretly cause im japanese. [yakuza-style biatch.]  then we weaved in and out of traffic making our way back to the east side, avoiding random bums and huge burly dudes along the way. pausing, we got slurpies and sat alongside the freeway drinking them. then we ran across the freeway and maneuvered through bushes, fences, and cars trying to reach a sidewalk. when we got back, we listened to Madness while we watched "The Complete History of No Doubt" on VH1 and "Pimp My Ride." No Doubt was soo cool when they were an actual ska band in the 80's and early 90's. then, after the Return of Saturn everything went to hell. Now Gwen Stefani is all Eve'd out glam GhettoFabulous and they make whaack dance-pop-reggae eurotrashmuzik. Tony Kanal is by far the coolest member, even now, cause his fashion is HELLA ILL!  anywayz, yeah, this day was pretty iLL in termns of having insane amounts of fun for the entire day. should be iLLness going on tomorrow as well, but we'll take each day one at a time. i can't wait for the used clothing store to open on Mendo, that store will be where its at! managed to spend 1.34$ today, at the same time making 5.00$, so, unlike so many other days, i made a profit. oh yeah, being cheapass has its benefits. tomorrow will probably hit me up for some mad ca$h though, oh well, what you going to do? uemployed is the coolest status ever. like the beastie boys say, "your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk, everyday i drink Old E and i don't go to work." i live by that. or not. whateva pays the billz i suppose.  iLLness all around. much happiness to ya'llz. thanks!

      word to having temporary (or now come to think of it, its so iLL maybe it'll stay) identities. how much sense does a day have to make... not much. but hey, that's half the fun. this summer is long, and its going to be longer. most days i get up and feel as though i have no purpose in doing so. like, getting up, taking a shower and eating LEFTOVER cherios breakfast... its the routine and doesn't count, after all of that is when the day actually begins.  i thought that getting up at 9 would help out the process. previously, it was all about getting up at 11 and not getting going until around noon. that suxz. getting up when the sun is already shining on your face (and you're not outdoors) is not a good thing.  there are so many things to do, and so many people to do them with. it would seem as though this would be so exciting and new, everyday a fresh adventure of some sort... definitely not the case.   tomorrow i'd like to walk down the railroad tracks from santa rosa to... wherever they lead to, and sometime else this week, to take the bus down to frisco C and be punkass for the day, and sometime in between to have some hardcore doing nothing time with assorted people. i don't know, maybe some more exploring time in the "wilderness" would be nice, or some Xtreme urban biking through the hood... or just around steele lane, whichever. it needs to get hott, and the days need to get long...  in the meantime, i just got notice that i am never allowed in my friend's house ever again with a pen. after being bored and tagging everything in sight (and out of sight for that matter) with a sharpie, this makes sense. damn that was fun.  as calvin and hobbes said, "the days are just packed." that doesn't really apply at the moment, but hopefully before too terribly long it will. in the meantime... its time to watch the tapes of Peet and Peet that i made last summer. iLLin'

      man alive,   summer is HOTT! i can barely walk outside before turning into the liquid silver puddle thing from the Secret World of Alex Mack. That would be kind of a nifty thing to be able to do, but whatever, having that happen randomly would actually be a bad thing. eh, drunking ballplaying of some sort should be happening pretty soon. that'll be iLL provided we don't all die of heat stroke.   southern cross  never, ever bike across town in the daytime ever again! biking at night, however, is quite another story. here's to vandalism and hijinks on the streetz late at night... with spray paint!

           oh my god i think i need to vomit.      you know when you have that feeling that things have gotten so complicated and fucked up as that your stomach feels knotted up and full. like really, really full, even though you haven't eaten anything all day. i need alcohol and a lot of it... it's right about now that i wish my friends were really the punk kids that we all aspired to be so many years ago... where the hell did that ever go to? sitting around, ditching school everyday, swillin' down 40's of King Cobra and Old E walking along the railraod tracks and hanging around outside of the phoenix after a show late at night on week days... if people chilled out from this university bullshit long enough to realize that they ruin their own lives and the lives of others around them, the state of, and mental health of teenagers would be saved so much needless drama and general shit. college admission's officers are the worst people alive. it's their jobs to ruin the lives of kids, crushing their dreams because they didn't volunteer at the local animal shelter or become a member of key club. i hate it so much. countless pricks and terrible people have gotten into colleges riding on the strength of their "made for resume" superficial key club bullshit. and then shit, then there are people like me who can't or won't deal with the shit that comes with the whole deal. seventeen years old and it just pains me to think that i could have been not doing shit for the passed three years or more and still end up going down the path that i've ended up on. direction, it would seem is relative, and i don't know... maybe things are better this way. i have one year to finally live the life that i have idealized and fetishized over for so long, or at least partially. viva.  muzik: modern enlgish "melt with you," INDK "east coast rising" iLL

      blatant  converge rip off... oh well.  muszik: a trance loop i made (kamikaze 5)  anyway, the year is now over. no more FISH kids running around, no more Bryce being a stoner, and no more getting to school at 8:15 everyday and getting mad amounts of tardies in english. no more sophomore p.e. class with all of the suddenly cool kidz, no more kelly O.C. and i getting yelled at by mrs. fishman everyday, no more mr. wheeler being such a mack with the freshman girls, and no more pact of steel with Imoto between the Swedish-Finnish and Japanese empires. oh well though, better times ahead.  mad grad party action tomorrow, always fun. mad show tonight, have to leave for that. holla back at nikos and the girls in suede.  hmm... what's with tonight, tonight? after school today should have been mayhem. like last year, burning signs and talking shit. instead, sean and i walked around wondering what to do with ourselves... feeling kind of unnatural and uneasy about the massive silence that had befallen the school. we sat on the newly vacated senior steps and talked shit about student gov't kids... the school was empty complete and dead. we moved to the shade and watched workers set up for project grad. even though everybody says that it's lame, everybody still goes to it year after year... like salmon. anyway, mad amounts of debatchery should be in the works for the immediate future... need to explore sean's house cause it's sooo rad.  time to go to the show.  fun, fun. ...

      fuck ya'll, school is almost out! just one more day left, i can't believe it. this year has been so hideous on so many different levels, eh, who needs to go to university anyway. shit. anyway, the ashes of once grandiose dreams aside, i am more than ready for the summer to begin. this year has been, academically anyway, one constant and prolonged stint of holding my head inside an oven. i thought that i could take it this year, i knew my classes were going to be hard, and full of arrogant pricks that secretly are idiots but like to front like they have smarts. whatever, honor is to not play that game; fronting is a terrible activity to engage in, and my respect for such individuals crashes through the floor, just like my heart will when i see my grades a few weeks from now. that will suck, but, it's over, and even though i may have done irrepairable damage to my career in future acadamia, i have won a few important battles. let's recap:  1. biggest victory. parents officially don't care about me. this year they decided to give up completely on pushing me to do my best, and instead have adopted the classic policy of "it's your life, deal with it when it bites you in the ass." right on, at least i think. its a tradeoff i suppose: buy yourself freedom at least in the short term in exchange for   different   scenarios at graduation time... i don't know, moving out had crossed my mind seriously more than a few times this passed semester, so maybe this is better than creating a permanent rift with the old parents. i don't know, i guess i'm kind of fucked either way.  2. getting over people.   3. living life. getting out, doing things... spending less time indoors, less time sleeping, less time doing antisocial activities. not quite on par with nikos, but making progress.  4. breaking ties with people. certain people, who aren't inherently bad or anything causing undue amounts of stress and trauma in daily life.   5. meeting iLL people.  6. burying the idea of sXe.  7. coming to terms with living on own. more freedom, more troubles. eh, libra power.  8. becoming a world-class techno/trance producer/dj.

      muzik: dj tiesto, "blue sky" trance like what  ...i still can't help thinking of what i am leaving behind as this year draws to a close. good friends, and yeah,   better  friends leaving... and of course, not coming back. kind of sad, kind of bitter, but there isn't really anything to be done at this point. eh, time to let certain things go, you can't do any better than that i suppose.  i feel like i am in a trance... speaking of which, i wish that there was an ill venue for electronic music in santa rosa proper, or closeby. going to forestville is mad lame, and those are all hardcore raves. no ecstasy for me, haha, but i still think that going to a mad techno show would be the coolest thing ever.  did i mention... a short treatise on high school as it relates to life in general:  i honestly don't know what high school is and/or what it means. suffice to say, it is both the lifespring and cemetary of lives, myself included. as for meaning, i derive none. nothing decent, warm, or good finds its origin there. well, perhaps a few, isolated things... but alas, such things are as fragile as they are beautiful, and with each passing day and night, realization of its prefect vice convulses the body. coughing up blood, i don't know, and inasmuch, probably never will. high school and its exestential hearts desire something with substance and gravity, something that is meaningful, tangible, and can be cared for. finding none, or at least... yes... but having already attained freedom... it waits, wilts, dies.

      muzik: iron and wine - "faded from the winter"  &nbsp;  today was almost perfect.  &nbsp;  it started out in a most horrible fashion though, as i got rousted out of bed at 600AM by dad saying that i better shower fast or else feel like a skank all the way to OAKLAND!  oh yes, i was driving dad's girlfriend to the airport whether i liked it or not.  i also dont know how to get there. today had the potential to really suck. but didnt.  &nbsp;  so, hours later after rush hour traffik, our hero departs the airport with only a vague idea of how, in fact, you actually get back to highway 101 from Alameda. (where IS Alameda?!)  &nbsp;  deciding not to go back to boring ole' santa rosa just yet, i decided to stop off i berkeley to face down navigational demons and hopefully pick up some cd's/records at Ameoba. suffice to say, i never did find Ameoba, just some college prepz and street people&nbsp;and the legendary Gilman Street venue.&nbsp;nothing too terribly exciting... and it was only 1030!  &nbsp;  taking a brief detour towards Sacramento, it was time to play the musik loud and roll the windows down, drawing the ire of passing cars as they see you yelling along.  &nbsp;  it was magic, and yet, the most surreal and karmic moment came when driving back from the Sacramento area across the Richmond Bridge. blue sky everywhere, ships passing under the bridge, high white clouds, beautiful ocean, and the city, all while listening to The Faint. the city, and the world for that matter was fucking mine at that moment, and nobody was in a position to tell me otherwise.&nbsp; should i drive off of the guardrail and die, it didnt matter; what mattered was the spectacle at hand and the muzik in the stereo, and suddenly i&nbsp;thought that&nbsp;the world made just a little bit more sense. i was happy, and i was in love.  &nbsp;  i thought though- people really dont give the whole nature/cityscape scene the respect it deserves. personally, i love industrial sectors in cities. from the abandoned warehouse buildings and cement plants in santa rosa to the awesome shipyard/rail depot of the richmond area, its all beautiful, just not in a classical sense. i dont know, perhaps im just full of shit and dont know anything, but sometimes at night, coming back from san francisco, theres nothing that id rather see than the bay bridge at night- and while crossing it, looking back across the water at the city. city lights are hyped, but they never get old. i could walk down (and have) city streets at night, just not doing anything- walking with no purpose other than to observe. and big cities are all the better. cities never die, and hell, most never truly sleep either. walk out of a hotel room at 4Am and yeah, youll find something going on. it may not be art, but itll be something damn close to it. asthetics is all relative, and i know that im rather biased, but for my time, ill take the city any day (or night for that matter) even over its classically beautiful counterpart.  &nbsp;  ..............................................................................................................  &nbsp;  spent the rest of the day in petaluma visiting my relatives and playing DDR (thats Dance Dance Revolution) with my cousins for hours. god i love that game.  &nbsp;  then i drove back on 101 until Rohnert Park where there was a mad accident and i got off the freeway. after being lost in Rohnert Park for about a half hour (so many dead end streetz and courts!), and then finally got home about 20 minz ago.  &nbsp;  so, with 43 more minutes left in my day- i doubt it can get any better,&nbsp;though i wouldnt mind being proven wrong. ha. that was obvious.  &nbsp;  yours,  -nick

      or something. my french skills are lacking, dangerously. &nbsp; dc was ill, however... &nbsp; xxavrilcorexx: how have things been since i have been away? (dc was fucking hottttt! humidity at 100% means your clothes STICk) to you &nbsp; yes. that would be the one serious (!!!) drawback of the east coast. massive humidity and massive heat combine for - biblical conditions where you wander suffering delusions and mirage from lack of decent tasting water and shade. dc itself is very nice and clean. nothing compared to the hideousness that is san fransisco where the crack zombies and needles can be found side by side in front of any buidling. in dc, i think they  shoot  their homeless people if they get too close to the nice buildings. oh sure, there are crack zombies in dc, but&nbsp;they are all in one little zone far removed from where tourists are.&nbsp; sirens blare all day and night, and secret service mobiles drive by interections without stopping (or looking out for pedestrians) escorting black tinted blue limosoines (?) full of people&nbsp;who seem important.  &nbsp; as for me. i kicked it in the (oh yeah! jay-z eat your heart out)  executive premier  level of the capitol hilton. sippin' on french bubbly sparkled water that ive never heard of but looks cool and spending hours a day in the jacuzzi tub with more bottled water with sharpie written "cristale" tagged on the side.&nbsp; oh yes, even though i dont quite look the part, it was fun having the bellhops and other people bend to your desires&nbsp;because... youre a customer with money! suckaz. as Evasion says, "i was  living  a gansta rap song!" well, that and having to walk miles&nbsp;upon miles a day in the heat, but you know... the hotel was worth it in the end. &nbsp; the rest of dc was nice. all the momuments and buildings,&nbsp;and i must say,&nbsp;i am glad that i went. went through the white house which was ill, and the capitol, and talked to what?! random congressmen!? how did this happen?! yeah, had to meet some of those too, whom my uncle apparenetly has some mad connex with, and as a consquence, was able to hook me up with all access passes (not really, because they dont exist) to meet the president!~ ha. now im lying. but running up a 578$ bill at a 4.5 star restaurant certainly isnt... and having a congressman pay for it all... hey, i guess that power really does have some cool points. that guy was really cool. my guess is that he wrote it off of his own taxes or something so he didnt pay for it either, which leads me to believe that... the taxpayers did!!! now i  am  important. i used taxpayer dollars to order a 25$ dessert that i got to set on fire! how cool is that?! ah yes. i love dc. but most of all, i love its people... i think we all know why. and when the dust settled and it was all said and done, my overarching lesson for the trip was: become a congressman! &nbsp; god bless the u.s.a.

(weather gods be warned, we've had lame weather so far and its almost mid-july).  .........  dc is such a mad ghetto outside of the capitol part of it. ive read that the average life expectancy for a black male there is 26 years old. so... not going over into that part of town. sticking with the congressmen and the tourists on that one.   .........  anyway, so i am out of commission for a week. how will people survive with out me around?! haha. pretty easily i'd think.  i get to come back on saturday, hopefully (if the plane isnt delayed) in time for the... uh, velvet teen and/or polar bears show that night.  ...changes in latitutudes, changes in attitudes... ...wastin' away again in margharittaville...  use a coathanger, -nick

      hmmm.  "you're resume here is quite impressive. the board and i are very pleased by the work that you do. now tell me again, what exactly is it that you do?" "professional assassin, for hire." "of course. for hire, i like that. yes, i think you'll fit in quite nicely with our little... operation." "i see." "yes, are you familiar with our protocol?" "i understand that you are airtight... that the authorities have been trying to penetrate your outfit for a long time... quite unsuccessfully." "quite." "it helps to own half of the cities elected officials. it cuts down on the amount of, shall we say, attention, that is paid to you from the law enforcement." "i see." "yes, in fact, we have never been on the wrong side of a trial verdict. do you think that is a coincidence?" "i suspect not." "then you are correct. no, loyalty is demanded of all of our... 'employees' above all else. failure to conduct yourself accordingly..." "yes, i understand most fully. loyalty above all else." "excellent. i see we have reached an agreement then?" "yes, your offer was most generous." "...and there is more where that came from. you see, our people, provided they are efficient, are treated very, very well." "i see."  ha. loyal assassins are indeed the future, and i aim to prove it...

      not to be confused with CCCP or CCLA or even UNICEF for that matter. ha, if nobody understands, good. my work here is done.  breaking news:  [19:25 PCT.] from the office of the High Court of the Joint Chiefs... ... of parents.  pvt. nick butler is ordered to counseling. expected to report at 6.7.04 on assignment.  that is all. this message will self destruct.  ............  so, thats fun! ive gone before and its been threatened for ages. itll be just like meeting an old friend...  actually, i dont dread it. its better than what was going on. i am secretly pleased.  ............  as for CCD. haha. i had a dream last night. it was good. and then it was bad, and i got sad. then it was back to being awesome. and no, for the record, it had nothing even slightly pornographic in it. just that today, i awoke initially being sad that it was all a dream, dont you just hate that? but then i was like, "goddamn it nick, youve got to take action here unless youre going to be all sad and shit even longer if you let this go by." so, nick is mobilized and strategizing, trying to play his cardz.. and hopefully end up happy.  wish me luck.  roger that, -nick

      aye carumba. my family (me, my dad, and my mom) is dysfunctional. thats for damn sure.  no need to stress the details here, but use your imagination of the most bitter and draining family setups youve seen on tv dramas (that usually end in a crime) and yeah, superimpose it on me. fun stuff.  ..........  cant really go back to moms house for a while, even dad is pissed. everything in life is pointless and unnecessary. as for this, i dont know. if i had any alternatives to turn to in these times, theres no doubt in my mind that i would take them.  to give all of this life up, and actually do something. in the meantime, time to start lining up houses to stay at, just in case.  ..........  i dont know. am i really this down and out? am i really this desperate? once again, i dont know.  i dont know anything anymore.  which leads me to believe, i probably never did.  ..........  so, heres to living life one day at a time. not knowing where or when life is finally going to catch up with you.  over and out, -nick

      first of all, its time for:  the good-  2 weeks in hawaii = fun, fun. glad to be back though.  the bad-  house broken into, computer/other stuff stolen, room pillaged mad beastie boys style (along with the rest of the house).  the good-  robbers didnt take my money stash/other things that would have sucked if they had taken.  the bad-  suspicions placed on my friends/my possible DRUG habbits (wtf?!?!) by parents and police.  the good-  evidence points to street trash, not me or anybody i know (except that shady machanic).  ------------------------------------  the other-  having your house tossed really sucks! in addition to taking all sorts of stuff, knowing that some punkass bitch was all up in my room is kind of disconcerting. will they come back? probably not, but if they do, im sleeping with the kitchen knives for the next couple of weeks just in case. the important thing though is that it is all just stuff. the computer theft is lame, but its not like it cant be replaced. property is property and nothing more, i suppose its finally time for me to actually live up to that statement. so, time to count my money and go shopping (hopefully with some nice insurance money!).  "im a sniper with a hell of a scope, taking out a BURGLAR or two- they cant cope with me."  -nick
