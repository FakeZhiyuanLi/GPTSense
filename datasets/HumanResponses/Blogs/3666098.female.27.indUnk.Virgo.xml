      Hi everyone,  Ever have one of those weeks where the days kind of blend into one another because nothing really happened?  I just had one of those weeks.  Haven't really had anything of merit to post for the last couple of days. I really can't believe that its Friday already. I've been sat here reading my NY State highway code book so I can take my permit test in a couple of weeks. Its pretty straightforward stuff really, mostly common sense.  I called Dolphin today - all my stuff should arrive on a ship next Wednesday, which will be nice. I needs my books and my PC and stuff; I'm tired of not having any of my possessions.  I actually think I'm a bit depressed at the moment. It really sucks to not be able to partake in any of your hobbies, like gaming or roleplaying or art or anything. Its like being stuck in a weird kind of limbo, except I have Cable and a swimming pool to mess around with.  I think the pool is keeping me sane right now, since its nice to swim and relax, and maybe work out some too. I've been eating a lot better since I came here and I think I've lost some weight. I've dropped down a clothes size anyway, so I guess thats a good thing.  Blondie and Billy are going upstate this weekend without Diane and I. We may actually get some private time together, so thats something I'm looking forward to. I've been wondering about trying to get out to a cinema since there are so many things I'd like to see, like the Riddick movie and Fahrenheit 9/11, but Diane hates to go to the local Crossbay cinema and we have no way of getting anywhere else. Oh, well.  Back to HBO On Demand, I guess.  Oh, and to people that have our phone number: We haven't dropped off the planet, you know. It'd be nice if someone called us.  ~Martin

      Hi all.  Rain, rain, rain. Its raining a  lot  today, but its still hot. Gah.  Its about 1 in the afternoon here and I just got done eating lunch. Diane and I have been applying for jobs this morning, so I thought I'd post about some of the amusing things we saw.  Since we're applying for work in Virginia and the surrounding area, we get quite a lot of civilian contracts for the military coming up. (There is a big military presence in VA, especially the Navy) So I saw a couple of things that made me laugh today. One is geeky, one is just strange.  The strange one was for a position called 'Weapon System Help Desk Technician'. In my experience, a Help Desk, like an IT Help Desk is where you call when your equipment is broken and you need it fixed. Like, "Hi, this is Martin down in DCS, my mouse is broken, please send someone to fix it."  What the hell does a 'Weapon System Help Desk Technician' do?  Let me paint you a picture, that I have in my mind:  (Phone rings)  Technician :  "Good morning, you've reached the Weapon System help desk. My name is John, how may I help you?"  Caller :  "Sir! My rifle has malfunctioned! The enemy is advancing on my position! I need help ASAP, Sir!"  Technician :  (Breaks out technical manual) "Well, let me see here, whats first...Private, did you ensure that your rifle is loaded with 7.62mm standard issue ammunition and you're holding your weapon in the correct position?"  Caller :  {Sounds of gunfire} "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!!"  *click*   Technician :  "Gee, he hung up on me. Asshole."  I mean, really. Its probably completely different to that, but my imagination is a little odd.  The second (geeky) job I couldn't apply for either. You see, most of these military jobs require Citizenship and some degree of security clearance. I have neither. Heh.  The second job made me laugh because it required:  A) Advanced knowledge of networking and telephony switching systems B) Cryptographic experience (Thats codebreaking, folks) C) Top Secret level clearance.  And the US Government says that the  urlLink Echelon system  doesn't exist. What-ever.  Here's where my visa is mysteriously revoked and I get deported by angry men in dark glasses...  Maybe I'll post more later.  ~Martin

        Ah, I have become cryptic like Martin with my titles. So let me explain.   Diane receives an email from monster.com, we're interested in your resume (CV) and would like you to forward us a copy of it. The address is an AOL account, the phone number in Manhattan. Diane takes the leap (with prodding from Martin, of course) and sends her resume.   I just got off the phone with Mr Al Levinger. I'm not sure which agency he's from but he'd like an appointment to see me tomorrow. He doesn't have his own office right now so he's sharing with someone else but doesn't want to use their phone. He gives a cell phone number. Which has a 516 area code. For all you non-USs out there 516 is a land line in Long Island. After a slightly strange conversation of :    me :  "what positions do you have available?"   Al :  "standing positions, standing on one leg. you know?"   me :  {hesitant} "ha ha"   Al :  "what kind of salary are you looking for?"   me :  "over $30,000."   Al :  "i have a position with a well paid horse (reference my summers at a dude ranch). it pays $2,000 a year. how does that sound?"   me :  {slight nervous giggle} "not so good."   Al :  "you can have all the oats you can eat. it's a good deal and a well paying horse."   So readers, after a small conversation with Martin and my mom over the validity of this Mr Levinger's proposal, I ring his 516 number to cancel my appointment for tomorrow. Cue voicemail :   "Hi, this is Al. Please leave your name and number and I'll get back to you."   Hmm.. not really a very professional sounding employment agency.   Ah, the life that I live. You have to love people who contact you and try to convince you that you want something they may not even be offering.   Back to the drawing board I say. Tomorrow, in lieu of my 10am appointment with Mr. Not So Kool I'll be applying for an admin position with family services in Charlottesville, Virginia.   Wish me luck. And if any of you can find time to use your fingers, try leaving some comments!!!   Lots of love.   Diane

      Hi everyone.  Today was shopping day! Woohooo! I just  love  walking around New York in 90 plus degree heat!  Oh, wait. No, I don't.  Especially  when I'm shopping for clothes.  So today I bought suits.  Three  suits, to be exact - Nice suits, with color co-ordinated ties and shirts and stuff. One dark, One mid-grey/brown, one light grey. I swear I look like an Italian pimp in the light suit; its pretty awesome. Heh.  Anyway, so these suits set me back about $500 with all the alterations, since the sleeves are all too long - I'll post pictures since I'm sure Mum would  love  to see me in a new suit. All of this, of course, when my USB cable arrives.  I also applied for a new job today, down in Chesapeake in Virginia. Its with Siemens (oh god, not again) for an entry-level system analyst - the kind of stuff they want is very similar to work I've done at NTL and some of the project management work I did at Siemens during our integration. I have no idea how much it pays, or anything; but hey, maybe they'll give me an interview.  I watered the plants in the back yard today, and I suddenly became acutely aware of all the air traffic that comes by here. I never really noticed it before but a large jet takes off or lands at JFK like every 15-20 seconds, and our house really isn't that far away. Its weird to see so many big planes close up. Shame that Concorde doesn't fly anymore, but most of the residents here in the Channel are happy about that - Concorde is  really ,  really  loud.  Tomorrow I get to sit on the PC with Diane and look for jobs. Its forecast to be nastily hot and humid tomorrow, so I'm going to sit in an air conditioned bedroom and get my employment-seeking on. Should be fun.  Oh, I have a new favorite soda as of today. The new orange flavor Mountain Dew  kicks ass !  Until later!  ~Martin

      Got back from upstate a few hours ago.  It was  very  interesting to spend a couple of days up at the trailer. I feel like something of a buffet at the moment, since my legs are covered in a patina of mosquito bites. I didn't get any the first two nights but was practically eaten alive on the third. Apparently Englishmen are an acquired taste to the local insects.  I kind of took on a personal challenge to photograph as much wildlife as possible whilst I was upstate, but I can't post my pictures until my USB cable gets here. My camera has been getting a lot of use recently and its running out of power  again , so I've bought some rechargeable Nickel-Metal-Hydride batteries for it. (What a mouthful)  I managed to get decent snapshots of wild deer, a chipmunk, and a couple of cool butterflies. Getting a close up shot of a chipmunk requires immense patience, let me tell you. I swear the bastards will run away if you move more than a centimetre towards them! We eventually managed to fool one by putting some food out, then I hid in the shed at the trailer about 5 feet away, and snapped a couple of good pictures of him from inside the doorway before he ran off.  One thing that I missed because of it's speed and the fact I didn't have my camera in my hand was a Bald Eagle that glided over the camp site. That was really nice to see. About the only thing on my list that I didn't see was a bear, but apparently they're pretty rare.  Thursday afternoon and night it rained  all  night. Rain like I've never seen in England;  huge  drops and utterly relentless. The thunder and lightning was quite amazing, with green and purple bolts as well as the white/blue that I'm used to. And really, really loud thunder. I captured a half decent AVI movie on my camera that I'll post when I can.  I made friends with the family bird, Peekaboo, during this trip. He's a parrot about 10 inches from tip to tail, and bites the hell out of everyone in the family except for Diane's mom Blondie. I managed to gain a degree of trust over the weekend to the point where Peekaboo would sit on my shoulder and I could pet him without getting chewed up. I have learned not to get to complacent, since I tried to pet him when we got back home and got a nice bite and a bruise on my thumb as a result. It hurts when I use the spacebar now. Ouch.  I called my Mum and Dad today to wish my Dad a happy Father's day. Everything seems to be going well back in England and my house should be sold soon. Mum and Dad apparently cleaned everything, which was nice of them since they didn't have to.  I have to head up to Jamaica Avenue tomorrow, since I'm buying myself a suit and I need to be measured. I need a decent suit for job hunting, so I'm rather looking forward to going. I got myself a bunch of new clothes upstate from Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart is an interesting store, as I was telling my friend Andrew in an email today. It still seems weird that I can buy food, clothing, jewelry and  firearms  (!) all in the same store. Maybe I'll buy myself a crossbow or something...  I'll post more soon. Right now I'm considering reading some of the book I picked up in Monticello. Its basically the NY Highway Code, and I need to memorise it for my written test when I start learning to drive in the next couple of weeks.   ~Martin

      Today I experienced the joy of American bureaucracy. We took a trip to the social security office in Far Rockaway - Damn, thats a sorry place. Graffitti and busted up buildings all over, and I did not feel comfortable  at all  walking down the street amongst a multitude of angry looking folks. Fortunately Nan and Pop drove Diane and I down.  You know things are going to be bad when your family jokes about you getting shot on your second day in New York, and they make you take off all your jewelry before you head out the door. Thank god thats over with, thats all I have to say. I should get my card in about two weeks.  We're heading upstate later today, which kinda sucks in one way because it means I probably can't call my best friend Chris to wish him happy birthday. Happy Birthday Chris! (if you're reading this, and not too busy playing Unreal Tournament 2004 or Ninja Gaiden)  I'm going to take my camera upstate and take some pictures of the trailer and Mountaindale, but I won't be able to post them until my USB cable arrives here from England. Trust retarded me to pack my camera but have the shipping company ship the USB cable. Dumbass.  This will probably be my last post until Sunday night. Have a good weekend everyone!  ~Martin

       Well, Martin has dragged me into the back bedroom for a little naughty computer time. So here I am trying to figure out how to post on  his  webpage. It's way too weird. I guess I'm just happy with a few emails now and then. But for those of you who would like to learn all about our wonderful transition from UK to US feel free to browse.   For now I'm off to sort out some cleaning before we head Upstate.   Laters taters!   Diane

      So today has been my first full day living out of the UK.  I can't really say its been that eventful. Its hot as hell here in New York. I didn't do much today except figure out how I'm getting my Social Security card. I have to head out to Far Rockaway tomorrow and get it processed; I already filled out all the applications and stuff. I should get my card after 7-10 days, then I can really start looking for work in earnest. I can also get my permit from the DMV after I pass my written test so I can learn to drive. Sweet!  I was going to apply for a job today with the FDNY. Thats the New York Fire Department. Apparently City jobs like this one can take several MONTHS to process you, and I also have to send my resume and stuff to an external company so they can vet my 'foreign education'. I really don't think I'm going to bother since I don't intend to stay in NYC for very long. Diane says she may apply though - one of the jobs is for a dispatcher, and I think she could do it. City jobs also apparently have really, really great medical and pension benefits.  I never did get a chance to swim in the pool today. I got in and helped guide the aquadroid but it wasn't really a swim. For those that don't know, an aquadroid is a little automated robot that cleans the bottom of the pool. It missed a spot, so I had to get in the pool and kick it a bit till it cleaned it properly...  Thats all for today, maybe I'll have something more interesting to write tomorrow!  ~Martin

      Hi all,   Our stuff is here! Yay!  Its only taken a month and a half, but yesterday all our belongings finally arrived. Despite some minor cosmetic damage to some furniture it generally seems intact so we now have the daunting task of unpacking everything on Monday.  We dumped all the stuff at Diane's Grandma's house since its pretty much vacant right now. (as well as being absolutely huge - its about 3 times bigger than my old house in England)   We've grabbed a couple of important things out of packages to bring back here, which is why I'm posting this blog in glorious 1280 x 960 resolution as I now have my computer back. Finally.   All that is left to do now is sort out my house so I can get it sold. I want to close on September 1st so that I'll have no penalty fees from my mortgage, and thats only a month away so I think its probably feasible. Still no news on the job front at this time, although the job fair I went to in Manhattan this week had some promising leads.   I really hope someone calls me back soon, I think I'm going stir crazy. Having my stuff should help though - its nice to have things like Diane's&nbsp;quilt back, since we've been sleeping under it for the last 5 years its the kind of thing you miss.   We're heading upstate today again; still doing the whole 'every other week' deal. Its been rainy and miserable all week so I'm hoping it will brighten up a bit, otherwise I imagine the weekend will be a bit depressing.   Oh well. Maybe we'll go to Mighty M and win some more cash. We'll see.   ~Martin

      Hi everyone.  Yeah, its been a while since we updated. Aunt Helen's funeral was kind of a weird experience for me. She was laid out for a day before the funeral, which essentially means she was literally laid out in an open casket in a chapel for a whole day so that people could come and visit her and say goodbye. As family we stayed around the entire day, talking to everyone who came by. In fact, it was about 90% family so most of the 20-or-so people there hung around for the entire day, just mainly standing around talking.   I cannot overstate how much it freaked me out, standing around talking for 8 hours with a dead person in the room.   It wouldn't have seemed so weird if everyone had seemed sad, but we didn't. It appears that family funerals here are like Irish funerals. Its like the joke Uncle&nbsp;Al told me:   "Whats the difference between an Irish Wedding and an Irish Funeral?"    &nbsp;  "One less drunk guy."   Its all done now though. The funeral itself was kind of sad, although it was a glorious sunny day and there were some really nice flowers. Aunt Helen was buried in St Johns Cemetary in Middle Village amongst the likes of Harry Houdini, so I guess she's in good company.  I never really knew her all that well but she was always kind to me. I think she liked me and she thought that Diane and I make a good couple. I'm glad we went and saw her a couple of times since we got here, even though she had no real clue who we were. She was always happy to see visitors, and never complained about anything even though she was really in a bad way.  Hopefully now she's in a better place, wherever that may be.  ~Martin

        Well, it's been a rough week here. My aunt, my grandmother's sister, passed away. I wouldn't say we were as close as we could have been but she's the woman I spent a lot of my childhood with. She had this great four poster bed and we'd sit up and watch Murder She Wrote on weekends when I stayed at my grandmother's house. I guess it's good that I think of the all the fun we had because towards the end she was in a bad way.     &nbsp;   My mom had to put her in a nursing home a while back because she had some brain damage thanx to one of her doctors. Then she fell and broke her shoulder and she needed dialysis for her kidneys. When we'd go to see her in the home she didn't know who we were but she was still very polite to us. We saw her a few days before she passed. My mom brought her some cherry tomatoes and some small bananas. She was so happy. So that was the last good time she had. I'm glad we were there for it.     &nbsp;   Hmm.. So, that's it from me. Just an update on what's going on here. It's just a little slow when you're going through this kind of thing.     &nbsp;   Laters.     &nbsp;   Diane

        To start, my brother didn't hit my mom with a firework. It was my dad. And second the mortars were awesome! Granted there were some which didn't go as nicely, some that only had silver and gold crackles, but the rest were great. My brother even picked some up specially for me. Tiny little mortars about the size of a grape. They went pretty high up and had a lot of bang for the buck. Very cute!   Other than the $1000 worth of fireworks it was a pretty normal get together. We ate a lot, they drank a lot, and the fire was going for about three days straight (thanx to some tree trunks they all lugged down to the fire pit).   So, we're back to the normality of the city. And again searching for the ever elusive bed. I think we may have struck pay dirt yesterday. King size, very comfortable, for about $1000. For all you UKers a king size in America is much bigger than a king size in the UK. So lots of elbow room.   Then there are the jobs. Well, I had an email from a company I applied with (Assistant Editor) but Yahoo! kicked it as having a virus so I've had to contact the company and am now awaiting any news they may have. For all I know the email could have been telling me to bugger off. Bleh.   Ok, that's it for me. Laters!   Diane   PS - Just to let you all know, because I'm sure you're all waiting with baited breath, we ordered our very own after I posted this. $899 for a king size plush pillow top bed to be delivered tomorrow. Let's just hope it comes!

      I guess I should be writing this as Day 22, since it just turned Midnight here. But hey, I wrote the title at 11:59, so Day 21 it is.  4th July is over. Man, we let off a whole lot of fireworks. We also had a visit from a  New York State Trooper  who wanted to ask us about our illegal fireworks. Unfortunately he arrived about 20 minutes after we let off the last one, so we'd kinda  blown up  all the evidence...  Anyway, so the fireworks were  really  amazing. The stars of the show were definately the cakes instead of the mortars. Cakes are packs of multi-shot fireworks that you let off with a single fuse - like I bought a couple of 16-shot cakes that fired off  enormous  plumes of silver sparks shot through with multicoloured balls, that went off in big spreads across the sky. Stuff like that. They were much less hassle than individually letting off our mortars, which were pretty but a whole lot of hassle.  We had a couple of close calls. Diane's brother Will let off a UFO firework that shot way up, did its whole spinning and burning routine then promptly fell back to earth onto Diane's mother. Couple that with Will's girlfriend Clarice doing the  not-so-bright  thing of loading a mortar upside down into the tube, therefore blowing the tube and mortar-bits all over the place at ground level. Uncle Dominic got a  nice  piece of shrapnel in his leg from that. I mean - what a dumb thing to do,  really .  Despite the mishaps we had a really great time, and the weather stayed great. Fireworks on a warm, starlit summer evening are really nice, which may sound strange coming from an Englishman since I always equate them drizzle and freezing cold in November. We also had some great food, so 4th July is officially one of my favourite public holidays now.   Thats the Gunpowder bit. The video slots thing is a bit different.  So there is this new Gambling place upstate in Monticello. Gambling is technically illegal in New York State, so with a bit of legal jiggery-pokery this place gets to operate video slot machines that are all centrally linked to the New York State Lottery computers. I'm not 100% sure how they get around the law, but the point is this place is absolutely  packed  with slot machines. I mean, its like a friggin  maze .  urlLink Click here for the web site.   Anyway, so Blondie and Uncle Dominic's wife Irene are begging and begging to go to this place all day Friday, but everyone has been drinking so noone can drive. So they wind up heading out there on Saturday instead at about 9pm. Monticello is about 20 minutes drive from the trailer, and Blondie, Irene, Susan, and Clarice all head out with Will driving.  At 11pm they come back, raving about how much of a great time they had. Everyone seemed to have lost a  shitload  of money (like between $50 and $100) except Blondie who is up $49 bucks. They then announce that they're  going back  there since the place closes at 2am and they obviously want to spend some more cash.  Guess which idiot jumps in the car with them?  Yeah. Me. I don't even know why I went.  Oh, wait. I remember why:  The reason I went is because  (first the first couple of months its open, we predict)  this place has a payout percentage of 92%. This means that the house only takes 8% of the takings; the rest is given out in payouts. As far as casinos and slots go, this is  extremely  good odds. The average fruit machine in an English bar has a payout of about 75%, meaning that  on average  if you put 100 quid in it, you'd only get 75 quid back.  I figure I'll spend 20 bucks and try my luck. Blondie came out $49 up, so I'll aim a little higher. I wanted to win enough money to buy myself an XBox, since  I want one, damnit  and this is the only legitimate way I could do it until I get myself a job.   I did it.   It took me  15 Minutes .  15 Minutes. On the first machine I sat down on. Lay down some extra cash each spin to increase my winnings, and I'm up to 50 bucks.  Sweet , I think. So then I start betting $3.60  per spin . Thats pretty risky.    Bam . $140 is mine.  So thats it. I'm done. I get up and I  walk away , which was surprisingly difficult to do. I stood around for the next two hours, high as a kite, watching the live band and watching the rest of the bunch lose their money. Which kind of put a damper on the whole night. But anyway, I walk away with enough cash to get me my XBox...Heh heh heh...  It has been a really,  really  good weekend.  ~Martin

      Hi everyone.  Wow, I didn't update in a  whole  week almost.   This week has been a  total  non-event. No jobs news or anything at this point, although the Department of Homeland Security has informed me that my visa has been completely processed and I should get my bona-fide plastic green card in the next couple of weeks. Sweet.  I've been ill this week; in fact we all seem to have been a bit under the weather. On Wednesday night I went to bed at about 8pm and slept fitfully for 13 hours, tossing and turning the night through. Not good at all. I feel much better now though, and I'm looking forward to the weekend.  Regarding the title of today's journal - the Buffalo wings refer to what I'll be eating a lot of this weekend. Blondie made 25 pounds (!!) of wings for 4th July so I'll be happily munching away on my favourite food for the next couple of days. There are quite a few of us heading up to the trailer this weekend for fun, food and fireworks. Well, not fireworks, since they're  illegal  in New York state.  Since we're such  good , law abiding citizens, we wouldn't  dream  of, say, popping across the state border and buying fireworks to bring with us. No. We'd  never  do that.  I'll try and get pictures with my camera.  Anyway, the other part of title - the  bomb  part - refers to an apparent bomb scare we had today at the Broad Channel Subway Station. It was interesting in that we saw the Police, Paramedics and the Fire Department heading down there, they stopped all the trains, and apparently also grounded the flights at JFK for a little while. The Channel is right in one of the main flightpaths out of JFK, and when you live by an airport (like we do) it becomes quite obvious when the traffic is grounded, since you can't see or hear any of it. I'm used to 747s flying low every minute or so, and the silence was eerie. While we were outside we head  faint  aircraft, but Blondie said it sounded more like when the F-16s were out on patrol after 9/11 than a regular Commercial airliner. Odd. I haven't seen anything on the news yet, maybe it won't make the news. Its not like anything actually  went off  there.  So that was my excitement for the day. Billy is coming home soon and then we're driving up to the trailer. I'm hoping that traffic won't be too bad but I bet it will  royally  suck, what with it being a holiday weekend and all. Oh, well. Wish us luck.  Until later.  ~Martin

       Well, I have finally made the reservations for our little trip to Richmond, Virginia. Wow. We'll be flying down to Dulles airport then renting a car and driving down to Richmond, about two hours. Seeing as how I've only driven twice since I'm back in the States I imagine this will be a big adventure.   *Martin whispers from the sidelines that King's Dominion theme park is only half an hour from Richmond and we'll be in Richmond for two whole days!*    Anyway, back to the point. We're trying, yet again, to get on the employment train. Ok, to be fair we could have gone to McDonald's or somewhere like that. But we're trying to get something a little more substantial.    Hmm.. It appears that that's about all that's going on right now. We move through the days waiting for the next big step. And it kind of feels like I'm ready to fall off.    Watch for the pool of body parts. If there is none, then we've made it through.    Laters!    Diane
