      I have found myself in You, the purpose for my life I discover who I am, as Your spirit touches mine Every step I take, every move I make You are by my side And I will be strong, my strength is in You  I will go where You want me to go I will do what You want me to do Yes I will go where You want me to go I will be who You want me to be Anything for You  When You ask me I will go You show the way before me In Your word I find the truth You lead me on this journey  Those who trust in You, ever praising You Will find their strength renewed They're gonna make it happen I will trust in You, never stop praising You Will find my strength renewed I'm gonna make it, make it happen ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I felt that this song is a very good song as it kinds of show how much that one is willing to do for God and the amount of trust one has in Him. I really like this song a lot as this allows me to tell Him how i felt and the things that i want to do for Him.

       You've probably heard the old saying, "don't get mad, get even." Well, here's some good advice for you: don't do either. Anger robs people of the joy of the Christian life. On the other hand, being quick to forgive will help you defeat those angry feelings.    &nbsp;   Adapted From: The Bible Promise Book For Teens     &nbsp;  Anger will not only cause hurt in you but on the other hand, the person that you vent your anger or have an anger with is in turn not as well as you think he or she is. Though people will make us angry in a way or another, the only right thing for us to do is to forgive them and to ask God for the strength to change your anger to joy. By changing your anger to joy, you can actually change a person thinking as they know that you are a forgiving person and it will also allow you to glorify God. Therefore, be slow to anger. -Abigail    &nbsp;  For every minute you are angry, you lose sixty seconds of happiness. -Ralph Waldo Emerson

      F riends are Friends Forever     &nbsp;   Packing up the dreams God planted    In the fertile soil of you    Can't believe the hope He's granted    Means a chapter in your life is through    But we'll keep you close as always    It won't even seem you've gone  Cause our hearts in big and small ways    Will keep the love that keeps us strong     &nbsp;   And friends are friends forever    If the Lord is the Lord of them    And a friend will not say never    Cause the welcome will not end    Though it's hard to let you go    In the Father's hands we know    That a lifetime's not too long    To live as friends     &nbsp;   With the faith and love God's given    Springing from the hope we know    We will pray the joy you'll live in    Is the strength that now you show    But we'll keep you close as always    It won't even seem you've gone    Cause our hearts in big and small ways    Will keep the love that keeps us strong    After hearing this song, there is 2 things about this song on my&nbsp;mind...firstly, it is that one's best friend is leaving due to some reasons and the feeling of sadness&nbsp;were there and this songs show that&nbsp;both the parties will miss each other. The other interpretation of this song that i've is that one's best friend is&nbsp;doing what God wants him or her to do...that is to go somewhere to become a missionary or other stuff...and as the friend obeys what the Lord&nbsp;has told him or her, both the friends knew that they will still remember&nbsp;each other forever. Friends are an important part of our lives. They either build us or destroy us. The choice is ours to decide. -Abigail

       One of &nbsp; satan's biggest falsehoods is that Christian life should be free from adversity. The longer you live, the more you'll realize that adversity is the rule in life, not the exception. But don't look at problems as things to be avoided: These are the things that test your character, patience, and faith. Sure, we might suffer grief and pain, but with Christ we can endure any hardship.  Adapted from: The Bible Promise Book for Teens   &nbsp;   Give glory to God even when you are in your deepest darkest times. -Abigail   When everything seems to be going against you, remember that an airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford

       Always there  When I'm alone, In the darkest alley,  And needed someone to guide me through,  You are always there, You hold me tight, and wipe my tears away.  When i'm feeling down,  You are always there to catch me when I fall When i'm alone, And needed a friend,  To help me through, You are always there, By my side.  When i thought i'm losing it all, Your hands of love they guide me through, The good and the bad, You're the bestest friend that i've ever had, Whenever i need You, You're always there  Whenever i needed love, YOu always shine Your light upon my face. Through the darkest times, You are always there, Towards me, to guide me, In my heart, I'll always know,  That You are always there.

      Just last week, lots of things have happened to me and when i'm at my darkest times, i prayed and seek God and i really want to thank God for the strength and for comforting me. I prayed for a Word and God gave me Psalm 18:16-19:  Ps 18:16-19: He sent from above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me, For they were too strong for me. They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the Lord was my support. He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.  I really want to thank God for this verse as this is the verse that i have been holding tightly and that through this verse, i found my strength to go through what i'm going through. Praise the Lord!

      "If you're a teen in the twenty-first century, you have almost limitless opportunity. YOu have chances to learn and grow, see and do, experience and enjoy life that other generations  only dreamed of. Now, what will you do with that opportunity?  Thats an important question, because opportunity is a two-sided coin. You can choose wisely wisely and chart for a happy and successful life...or pain and regret. With such stark alternatives, the choice is clear.  You want the good life-and that's what God wants for you, too. He's given you all the direction you need in His Word, the Bible."

      Modern society, through television, movies, and popular music, will give you plenty of advice- most all of it bad. Taking counsel from God and committed Christians, though, will provide an entirely different perspective- the right one. Choose to follow God's counsel-He is perfect and has laid out clear instructions to obey in His Word, the Bible. He'll also use other Christians to help guide you in the decisions that you must take-and you'll have plenty.  Courage is contagious. When a brave man takes a stand, the spines of others are oftened stiffened. -Billy Graham   When we are down, who do we turn to? Friends that is equally having the amount of problems that you have? Or friends that will spread your problems like wildfire to the whole world? Or will you turn to God, whom you trust? The decision lies in you. Therefore, seek counsel from God...from our Father..because He is the one that really knows how you feel, how you are struggling and stuff. He will be there for you always and therefore, seek Him and you will be able to seek comfort from Him. Therefore, who are you gonna turned to? -Abigail

      Like a comic book superhero, you possess an amazing power- the words you say. With words, you can affect another person's life dramatically- in either a positice or a negative way. Think hard about the words you say before you say them, those words can't be earsed once they've been spoken. Make it a point always to speak positively- words of kindness, helpfulness, and mercy. Use your "power" for good!  Kinds words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless. -Mother Teresa  Words are the things that we use to communicate with people. So in order to communicate well with people, not only our body language is important, the describing words and emotional words that we use are useful too. Whether we build someone up or not depends on our words. Therefore, God gave us a mouth and two ears in a way that we will hear more than we say. -Abigail
