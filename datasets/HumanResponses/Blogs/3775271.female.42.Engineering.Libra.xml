      First:  A bit of trivia.  John O'Tuomy* (1706-1775) owned an inn (pub?) in Limerick, Ireland, and was a well-known poet in his day.  Here's one of his poems, actually a limerick!      I sell the best brandy and sherry      To make good customers merry;           But at times their finances           Run short, as it chances,      And then I feel very sad, very.   *O'Tuomy is one of the spellings of the Toomey name.  Second:  The above limerick is perfect, as it relates so well to the props seen in many of the...  urlLink MORE PHOTOS!!    Woo-hoo.  Many thanks to Jim for these outstanding shots.   Anyone else have photos?  Let me know, I can either post them for you or you can provide the web link to them here.  Seems like the membership in ToomeyBlog continues to grow...let's hope we get everyone on board eventually.

      OK, so I am a slow learner.   Shannon and I recently returned from our Nation's Capital. I will save all the gory details about the plane travel in light of the fact that we visited the WWII Memorial, so we should not be complaining about the minor setbacks we experienced. The most impressive features of the memorial are the 24 bronze bas relief sculptures along the ceremonial entrance. Each one tells a different story about the war. If you go take the Metro to the Smithsonian stop and wear your walking shoes.    urlLink

      So far, 7 Toomeys are members of ToomeyBlog.  There are 22 more Toomeys/Dugans (with e-mail addresses) who we're waiting to join us here...hopefully soon!  I know there are questions about how to use this blog.  It's a little confusing at first; it took me a while to figure it out me-self.  So one of the big question marks is:  Commenting vs. Posting?  COMMENTING -- If you read something here at ToomeyBlog and want to add your two cents, just look for the "Comments" link at the end of that topic and click.  (If you're not logged in, you will be so prompted, then you can post your comments and you're all set.)  POSTING -- This is trickier.  Say you just got back from a trip and want to share a report with the rest of us.  This is just one example of when you'd want to create a new post (which others can then read and comment on).  So, where do you post your NEW story?  Doesn't look like there's any way to do it here, does it?  You're probably thinking the policy here is, "No ticky, no laundry."  Well...not so fast there, pardner.  You CAN get there from here.  First, you need to go to a different web page (meaning:  different than toomeyblog.blogspot.com).    That other page is known as your "Dashboard" page which is like a control panel.  To get there, go to   urlLink http://www.blogger.com/home    -- once you're logged in, you will see your "Dashboard" and you can create new posts from there, edit your own posts, or you can modify your profile if you want, etc.  And it will show up here.  (Important:  Be sure to add that page to your favorites/bookmarks so you can find it again.)    When you're at   urlLink your "Dashboard" page   you should see the "Create New Post" option.  Using that, you can type your post, preview it if you want, add hyperlinks in your text if needed, and publish it for all to see here.  Even though I set up the ToomeyBlog, it's for all of us to fully participate.  This is a team effort.  ToomeyBlog is all about TeamToomey, knowwhatI'msayin'?  Questions?  Comments?  Go ahead and add 'em here.

      Thanks to my dad & Jane,   urlLink here's the first round   of what hopefully will be quite a few batches of photos from ToomeyPalooza held June 5, 2004.  (Another album at the link has some historical/archival Toomey family photos, including the Toomey Coat-of-Arms.)  If anyone else has photos from the 2004 reunion please share!  Whether links to your web photo albums, or files that you'd like me to add to the album at the link above, or printed photos (I can scan, and will reimburse you for prints/shipping), the more the merrier. Post comments to this topic if you've got 'em.

      On June 5, 2004, about 100 Toomeys & Dugans -- all of the surviving children of Dr Gilbert and Frances Toomey, and their children, plus spouses/significant others and more children -- gathered at Aunt Peggy's condo for a long-overdue get-together which included much laughter, food, drink (and more drink), a marathon double-elimination Texas horseshoes tournament, and numerous photo-ops.  Uncle Bill provided free T-shirts with a great design: white shirt, with large green centered Shamrock, and the orange/yellow words saying: "Too Many Toomeys - June 5, 2004". Uncle Bob came with a Regis Toomey DVD. Uncle Pat held court and told stories until people's stomachs ached from laughing. Uncle Jack hosted a cookout at his home the next day.  The late Uncle Jim's wife and kids provided the extremely valuable family tree information and photos on CD-ROM and put on a PowerPoint slideshow. All three of the late Uncle Gil's kids traveled all the way from California for this special event.  A grand time was had by all. Some of the cousins are in discussion about a family web site; this blog can be one element of it.  This blog provides an immediate way for communication, discussion, comments, planning, news, updates, etc. All you have to do is create a free login ID and then youâ€™re free to comment away...

      Robert-thanks for your patience and getting me blogged on. Wanted to give a quick synopsis of our Alaskan cruise last month. Joe and I went with our neighbors, Rich & Shelly.  Uncle Bill has a great story about meeting our neighbor Rich in a bar,while watching a Cleveland Indians game. Back to the trip:if you ever have the opportunity to visit Alaska, we highly recommend. The scenery was breathtaking and we had the best weather, per The Weather Channel, in 80 years. We were on the Carnival Spirit: 6/16 departed Vancouver B.C.; 6/17 sail day-incredible scenery, Joe & I got a little sunburned; 6/18 arrived in Ketchikan-went kayaking, saw a ton of bald eagles; 6/19 arrived in Juneau-did white water raft trip, saw Mendenhall Glacier; 6/20 arrived in Skagway-did a train trip-amazing views and history of the area is fascinating; 6/21 arrived in Sitka-shopped, walked a lot, visited Raptor Center where heal injured eagles, owls, various other birds; 6/22 set sail, stopped at Harvard Glacier, saw some minor caving; 6/23 disembarked in Whittier, bus to Anchorage;6/24 took float plane ride; then back to Columbus. Hope to add some photos soon.

      I just returned from&nbsp;hiking Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the lower 48 states at 14,996 feet high.&nbsp; It was quite an adventure! The thin air is pretty nasty to deal with, and I experienced a good dose&nbsp;of&nbsp;altitude sickness. Aside from that, though, it was a neat experience.  urlLink Click here to see pictures . The first two pictures are looking out from the trail crest, which marks the final ascent to the peak. The 3rd picture is of a bristlecone pine tree. These are the oldest trees in the world. Many of them are over 4,000 years old, with one found to be over 4,600 years old. They look extremely gnarled and frail, but ironically their diminutive stature contributes to their longevity.

      Dissatisfied by separations,  Long absences unexplained, We gathered remnants of what remained. &nbsp; We passed the day together with divers Entertainments, (the lake nearby) Where cars collected, and their drivers &nbsp; We drank the breeze and tasted the water, Marking its slow decline: our own Reflections carved in sand and stone. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Robert Regis will fly this weekend into Madison, Wisconsin for a job interview on Monday with Imago.&nbsp; Robert John says he will attempt to have the three Bob Toomeys together on Sunday.&nbsp; Regis will leave Madison on Monday, return to Boston, leave on Tuesday for Taiwan for his present job.&nbsp; He will stop in Oahu to spend some time with his children and grandchildren on the way to Taiwan.&nbsp; He is also taking his diving equipment&nbsp;to use in Oahu and maybe Taiwan.&nbsp; If Regis should take the job in Madison, he will have to hire a management company to oversee his rental property in Worcester.&nbsp; The job with Imago will require international and domestic travel.&nbsp; Maybe he will be able to use the blog and keep us informed of his comings and goings.

      Hi Toomey clan,  Sorry I missed out on all the reunion activities but this Blog will keep me up-to-date on that event and future events. My big excitement for the week in Kabul was going to a bank seminar where the introductory speaker was no less than President Karzai. He was quite dynamic in his speech [although this was through a translator who could not capture that enthusiasm]!! His security detail is lots of burly American men --- quite interesting really.  This is a short 'blog' for my first attempt.   Until next time, Fran

      A few more   urlLink historical photos   have been posted -- in addition to all the   urlLink Reunion '04 photos   that keep pouring in (keep 'em coming).    Here's an interesting reunion idea that may spark some discussion.  Every year, the third weekend in August, Milwaukee hosts the largest Irish festival in the world --   urlLink Irish Fest  .  It's a great time with music, words & stories, food and much drink, crafts, dance, dogs!, and there's even a Mass on Sunday with a food drive.  All Toomeys & Dugans are more than welcome to visit Milwaukee if interested (this year it's August 19-22).  I'll be there Saturday August 21.  Every year, there is a massive Irish clan reunion for a particular name; this year it's the Murphys.  Inspired by our June 5 get-together, I contacted the festival organizers and asked how they select which clan is designated for that year's festival.  They said a family representative usually contacts them and requests it; they stressed it's a lot of work.    Wouldn't it be great if we could get the Toomey clan to be the designated Irish clan for Irish Fest next year or sometime in the near future?  I'd be willing to coordinate, or if someone else really is interested in taking it on I can give you the contact info for the Irish Fest folks.  Thoughts, comments, ideas?

       urlLink Photos from the trip to the Homeland.   Written by Shannon -  The United Kingdom Vacation was okay, but all in all more hurried and less relaxing than I had hoped. We did get a good flavor of Ireland, England, and Scotland. We learned many things about ourselves, relish all the comforts America offers and at times we take for granted. Day 1 Our first day we walked around and booked a rail/bus tour for the next day. We then went to check into our hotel and take a nap--totally exhausted from the flight and time change. They are 5 hours ahead of us. We got up and went to a local pub to eat dinner and then back to sleep since we had to be at the bus station at 7am the next day. Day 2 We boarded a train for Belfast where we caught a bus for the North coast tour. The tour included Carrick-a-rede- Rope Bridge; Giantâ€™s Causeway and the Bushmills Whiskey Distillery. We saw all the sights, but it was a hurried trip. The Rope Bridge is 300 years old and they change the ropes every year. We only had an hour at the Carrick-a-rede- Rope Bridge and it took 15 minutes each way to walk out to the bridge, plus there was a line of people. So we got as close as we could to take pictures, since we were still recovering from jet lag. Now off to lunch at of course a pub, unfortunately we had a bus full of 50 people and the pub could only seat 30. Nothing like a fast paced lunch with a bunch of people we donâ€™t know, scrunching 5 around a table for two. Basically, we got to know some of the people in our group really well during that time period. Survival skills were kicking inâ€¦â€¦â€¦Off to The Giantâ€™s Causeway, which is a rock formation from lava. It is basically steps out to sea, looks man-made, but really nature made. The legends say the prince used these steps to meet up with his long lost love. Now after that walking we sure needed some ice-cold whiskey! The distillery said how they run it through the whiskey process 3 times, but it still tasted like fuel to me. We ran to our train and found out we were 5 minutes to late and the next and last train came in at 8pm, which would mean another 2-hour wait. So we were not thrilled to have to hurry, then wait. Luckily we missed the train though because after further inspection I realized I left my purse on the bus with all my fatigue and running around. Anyway, I continued to run back to the Hilton where we caught the bus in the morning, but of course it was nowhere to be found. Dave and I went into the Hilton and the front desk person made some calls and got us a taxi and we were off to the main office of this tour place. Really at that point I was hysterical and not comprehending the dayâ€™s events very well. Fortunately, the purse was there, someone had turned it in! It was retrieved in about an hour. So we went back to the train station to wait it out the last hourâ€¦â€¦. Day 3 We slept inâ€¦â€¦and inâ€¦â€¦.and in. We decided to take it easy walking around in Dublin and not venturing too far from homebase. We went to Saint Patricks Cathedral and a lady a tour ahead of us farted and we were down wind of thatâ€”sacrilegious what do you think? Now Dave is not impressed that I view this as a highlight so I will add more to the Cathedral part. This church dates back to 1190 and the spire soars nearly 225 feet. Patrick was enslaved at around age 16 and had to watch sheep for his owners for years. During that desperate time in his life he found religion, much like me when I realized I lost my purse and then found it an hour later as I yelled out "Thank God!". Anyway the important people of the church were actually buried on the church grounds. It was a beautiful church with a lot of history! All that walking was made us thirsty and the day was beautiful with warm sunshine so off to the oldest pub, Brazenhead built in the 1190 range (about the same time as St. Pat's). We had Guinness and desserts, which are known as puddings in this part of the world. All desserts are called puddings. Who cares, just keep them coming! Day 4 Now off to London, to meet up with our friends Kathy and George, whose family is from Scotland. He knows the area and is familiar with driving on the wrong side of the road, which is good for us. Then off to meet the husband to be which is Georgeâ€™s youngest brother. Everyone is at this uppity English Private school at the HeadMasterâ€™s house. The HeadMaster is like the Dean or Principal who runs the school, and is also the Father of the Bride. He and his family threw a barbecue that night. We had chicken, burgers, dogs, and lotsa puddings! Although the Headmasterâ€™s family was very pleasant, I could tell you donâ€™t mess with dear ole dad. He makes my dad seem like a puppy dog. He uses all that English talk and could probably tell you off and the ordinary person would be none the wiser. The day before the wedding we went to London with our friends for a brief tour of the sights downtown. This included the London Bridge, Big Ben, and West Minster Abbey. We took a ferry down the river to see most of those sights. All of us went into Winston Churchillâ€™s Cabinet War Rooms. This is where he would make decisions during WWII and he and his key persons would be safe and secure. In August 1939 one week before the war began these rooms became operational. Britainâ€™s most senior leaders worked slept and survived the ferocious air attacks on London during WWII. There was an eerie feeling about it though; as we walked through, recorded sounds of bombs were going off in the distance. I canâ€™t imagine knowing you are safe underground and all of the human destruction that would have been going on above ground at that time. Day 5 The wedding was beautiful! The ceremony was in an old church in a town called Godalming. Later the reception was outside with champagne, tiny sandwiches, and cute little deserts. It was a wonderful day, low 80s and sunshine. Of course the English felt is was too hot, but we loved it. The HeadMaster said all men could take off their jackets at one point and hoped that the ladies would forgive them. By that time though Dave had already taken off his jacket and loosened his tie. The guys in kilts had it made! The reception was outside with a white tent with tables decorated fancy. The newlyweds went off to Malaysia after the best manâ€™s speech. After they left, some beer was brought out with a roasted hog, salads, rolls, and all the fixins. Yee haw!! Day 6 Our last stop was Edinburgh Scotland. The weather on the whole trip was wonderful and better than expected. Around 70-75 and cloudy to partly sunny. We saw the castle in Edinburgh and the Royal Mile, although I think we walked 10 miles that day. It was hard for us to keep up with George, he has too much energy. We made it to his home (2 hrs south) later that day and we stayed in a small cottage on the property, it was cute and all we needed. There were sheep and rock walls all around. Day 7-10 The next day George took us up a mountain. It was the actual spot where he proposed to Kathy 8 years ago. When you make it to the top it is tradition to put a rock on the huge pile of rocks indicating all of those who have climbed before you. By the time I got to the top I was ready for some pizza! Later we went back to the house and his family fixed us bread, cheese, and fruit for our lunch. Georgeâ€™s mother is a vegetarian and we were hungry wanting some meat and pudding after all that climbing! We went to see a couple of castles. One was castle Threaves home of Archie the Grim who was a military leader and another castle I canâ€™t remember the name right now. We had lotsa tea or at least I did and crumpets which are like a sweet biscuit with raisins. On the last day we walked along the coast of Scotland near a town called Rockcliffe. Anyway, we did see a lot of the countryside and did get some good pictures
