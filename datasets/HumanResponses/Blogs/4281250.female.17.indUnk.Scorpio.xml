        OZZFEST was amazing!!!  The best bands were Judas Priest and of course Black Sabbath.  It was so much fun.  There were so many people smoking pot, it was hilarious.  Then there was also a grass fight with half the stadium, not cool.  I'm so surprised that grass is stil growing there after all of those concerts.  And the other great part was this drunk guy next to us kept passing out, but his wife was pregnant and drinking and smoking.  That kid is going to be severly screwed up.  But hey, it's not my kid.  But, i can't believe that school starts in 3 DAYS!!!!  I don't really want school to start.  AAHHHH.......waking up early, doing homework, marching band rehersal everyday after school, then go to work after marching band rehersal.  Oh the joys of working.  Oh well, only 1 year left and then seniors are out of here.  YAY.  But still so much to do before we get out of here, it really sucks.

        Today was an amazing day.  It was great seeing people at registration.  I have 2 classes with krista, 1 with kimmer, and 1 with thurston.  And lunch with kimmer and aaron.  YAY!!!  But no one has 6th period gym with me, if you do write me a comment telling me so.  Kimmer, Lola and I also went to the new target and played with a football and tried on clothes.  It was fun, we were throwing the football everywhere, but eachother. ha.  I'm not so worried about getting accepted now, I think I'll do fine for the colleges I'm applying to.  But what if i don't?  I would die.  Well actually my mom would kill me.  It's such a long process to send off an application, it really sucks.  I hate writing essays and filling out information, damn college.  But oh well.  Oh, but tomorrow i get to go to Oz Fest!!!  I'm so excited, but i have to skip work.  Shh...don't tell jewel.  And tomorrow it will be a year with aaron.  Damn that sure is a long time, for me atleast.  Anyone will tell you.  My normal relationship time is about 3 days to a week.  I realize i don't really like the guys when i start to date them so i end it early.  I think that's the smart thing to do.  Don't you?  But it didn't turn out that way with aaron, amazing enough. haha.  Kidding.  But tomorrow will be the best day ever.  OZ FEST!!!  Can't wait.

       OMG!!!!!  Only 6 days till school starts!!!!!  AAHHHHHH.......  This summer has gone by so fast.  Damn.  Then marching band ruined the whole month of august for me.  Yay.  This year's show really REALLY sucks.  I hate it.  And then my section hates eachother.  Actually that's pretty funny.  There was a bitch fight between jo and vuk and it was great.  Ahh...great times in band already. ha.  Well, i really can't wait until the TEXAS TRIP.  That will rock..... frank, steve and his garter, the llloooonnnnnnngggggg bus ride with fellow band nerds, and all of the other exciting activities that go on.  The two band things with my life right now are my friends (you know who you are) and college.  My friends all hate me for the decisions that i make and i don't understand why.  Why do they care so much?  I can take care of myself and i'll do what i think is best for me, so please stop worrying and being mad at me.  We shouldn't be fighting over something that doesn't concern you guys at all.  And then college.  I'm to dumb to go to.  Aaron is #9 in our class.  yes, now everyone knows aaron.  I'm probably #675.  I know that i don't do horrible and i got a decent score on my act, but it's still not good compared to everyone else above me.  Damn i'm dumb.  I'm not going to get into Western or U of I.  I'm to dumb.  Oh well, those are my two problems for the day.  Tomorrow is registration, the real start of school.  NNNNOOOOOOOOO........kill me now : )

      Thanks to Lola, Dima, Kim, Krista, Mandy, Mike, Ben, Katie, and my mom for helping out at our table during registration!  We gave out over 300 mini-flyers, so hopefully we will have  a few new members this year.  :)  Our next goal is to make and put up posters around North.  Dima has already started making them and we would like to get together before school starts to finish some and then hang them up.  Here is a website I found that has env. poster winners on it so perhaps we can look at them for inspiration:   urlLink http://www.epa.state.il.us/kids/contest/index.html   Also, let's plan a date for the picnic.  Does anyone have a prefer Saturday over Sunday or vice versa?

       Welcome to the first Environmental Club blog!   The purpose of this blog is to keep people updated about activities in our club, to brainstorm ideas, to increase knowledge of worldwide environmental issues, and of course, to have fun. In the future, there will be many people allowed to post here which will also improve communication within our club.  Our first event of the year will be at Freshman Registration this Tuesday, August 17. We will have a table just outside of the main office and I am currently typing up a short flyer to hand out to interested freshmen. A major goal of this club for the year is to recruit underclassmen so that our club doesn't die next year when all of the seniors are gone.  I'll leave you with that for now, but feel free to post/comment.  Who is in favor of an Environmental Club picnic??  :)
