      Another day, another life. As i have said, my life is never uneventful, and ive just helped (hopefully) a friend who is going through it bad. I care and worry about him alot, i really hope he is ok. I have many friends, but they are all so important, i couldn't live without any of them. He tells me im seen as best friends, im happy to know that i can help him out, aparently im good at advice. Its beena week of scaryness. The last time i talked to him, he was talking like he was suicidal it freaked me so much, and i was worried and scared and i cried alot for i didnt see him for a week. He came back today and even though he's still not good, at least he's a live, thats alot to be thankful for. I hope he sorts it out i really do, he tells me he feels worthless and dark, but i need to make sure he never loses sight of the fact he does have many people who love him, even if we cant literally be there for him. in the words of my friend "Life sucks".. with my reply of "Yes, i gotta agree, even though i stay optimistic through even the worse times, life does suck sometimes". Another day, another life.  "*~-.I can remember the very first time i cried, how i wiped my eyes, and buried the pain inside, all of my meories good and bad thats past, didnt even take the time to realise, staring at the cracks in the walls, cos im waiting for it all to come an end.-~*"

      Alot goes on in my life, more than i probably have time to think about let alone write it down, but when things get that little bit harder, sometimes its escapism. A place to think calmly with no mind interuptions. A guess maybe i'm just running, away from the problem? is it a problem though? It's my life, i hope to fuck that my life isn't one big problem, otherwise whats the point? I guess i should blame myself. It's my fault my life is as complicated as it is, i didn't ask for this, but i did go searching for it. "be careful of what you wish for, you may just get it", damn that sentance is so true. A just needed something, got it, and then decided after to think about it. Wrong order to say the least, but contradictory to that, im happy i am where i am. I know so many great people, never does a day go by uneventful (is this a good thing or not? im yet to decide...), and in all honesty, i wouldn't be happy any other way. I guess i'm just difficult ;).   "*~-.Strumming my pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words, killing my softly with his song, killing me softly, with his song, telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly.-~*"

      Lifes fucked but don't have time right now to give details... Am going to Live Nickelback concert :D... i need something to take my mind off all this shit. It's amazing that when you care for every... you end up scared of how they will react to something.. amazing that you wouldn't believe that i cared really.. caring forever one is hard and an impossible task but i cant stop myself from doing it. As always, it involves a guy, and whats a story without someone messed up. I fear for them, i care for them, i don't know them. The way im acting doesn't look like i care, but its sad when someones got it so bad, that they turn to pain as comfort. I can't really deal with this. At 15, the group of us shouldn't go through this shit. Friends who love other friends and friends who care for other friends, dont know who to love or care for the most. there has to be a point in which you would have to choose. It's unfair, but unfortunatly it's true. When your told something, you've got to think what is for the best. It's hard... so hard... but... inevitable part of life. A Player perhaps... but i like him. It's so screwed up, and i do trust him as a friend. something true, non-the-less. i wish i was stronger, but to friendship and love, no one can be strong.  "*~-.Fell in love with boy, i fell in love once and almost completely, he's in love with the world, and sometimes these feelings can be so misleading.-~*"

       m... this entry is about a guy. Lmao! *thinks: they always are*. This is a slightly happier entry, and less stressed as you may notice from my spelling being slightly more accurate. Well i gotta admit, i never thought this diary would keep this far, they never do. I know my friend is trying to find my diary, but i havent' told any one. I'd be happy to know someone i dont know is reading it, otherwise whats the point of it being online?? ne ways that guy. A guy i love, meh, you think im stupid dumb whatever, but that don't change ne thing. He's sweet, and can read my mind as well as i can. And its the same back. a real connection, but as always, theres barriers. I love him but theres nothing i can do. He loves me too... *thinks: sounds big-headed*.. but he's told me, he's told me so much, i feel that im competing with who loves who more, and he's winning. I wish that not to be true... Life is full of surprises.. seems like ive got too many corners down my route...   "*~-.You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life You're still the one that I love The only one I dream of You're still the one I kiss good night.-~*"

      I haven't given this address to my online diary to anyone. And This is an apology to a certain guy (if i decide to give him the address) for anything i have done. I Have Noticed. I Have. All i've ever wanted was to be ther to help you. Hasn't that been clear enough? Well damn me if it hasn't.. Maybe you have noticed, but you don't trust me. I can't really change that, but if it helps, i may even trust you with my life. call me stupid if you want, theres not been much length of a friendship between us, but i can't seem to make it clear enough to you, i do really wanna be there for you alex, to help you through any shit. I know its not a automatic thing for anyone to trust any one, that does include me. but i'm here arms wide open if you need a shoulder to cry on... athough by the sounds of it ther are bound ot be other people u'd go to.  I Like you. I Like your interests. I Like your sense of humour. I Like your ability to insult yet not offend. I Like your laugh. I Like your eyes. I Like your mischevious grin. I Like your way of walking *dont ask*. I Like the way you can make a girl feel special, but i also dispise this of you too. I Like basically everything about... as a friend. I wanna say this before you think i'm hitting on you :)  I have to admit though. Even though all those things are true, there are some things that i dont like. i dont like the way you just sign off msn with no goodbye. i dont like teh way you just get up and leave at a lunchtime. i dont like the way i never know where i stand. But most of all, i dont like the way I lap it all up anyway. I still love you Alex, i wanna be here for you when ever you need me. And i am sorry for anything i have ever done to you in any way, or anything that i DO ever do to you.   "*-. This isn't a song, but for a change something from me: Even if it seems every where is dark, i will always try to hold a light for you, in the right direction.-*"

      I'm growing to like my work experience place. Yesterday it started and i was totally whacked, who ever said children were good for you? The Terrible Four. The ringleader, you can always tell. It's an amazing thing how girls and boys play differently. Girls have more patience.. and you can tell their more mature. Women are the stronger sex. This proves it i'm afraid guys :P. I now have majority of the day.. to revise and work -.- Hopefully i'll get time to talk to Alex again today *smiles, knowing Alex is probably reading this*. I did give him this address in the end, i hope ive made it clear enough for him now. The ball's in his court now. I'm ok at advice.. But im terrible at avoiding a problem, trying to get a person away from it. I try, i really do, i hope that is good enough, but normally, it isn't. I fear for my friends... all of them. And the terrible thig is, it isn't just a few that need to be worried about. Everywhere i turn, there is someone else. I'm scared I will pay a little less atention to one, and it will all go downhill, and never be able to get back up because it was my fault. I may take too much on sometimes, and not think about how to deal with my own problems. But when i'm helping someone else, it helps me to forget. But if anyone dares tell anyone who i am trying to help, that they should back off and not lay all their problems on me, i swear, i'll have no responsibilty for my actions. What business is it of theirs, when there not in anyway invovled but aparently just "looking out" for me. Well thankyou very much, but i dont need your fake sympathy. You've screwed up your own relationship with a very special guy, so who are u to be giving advice to others, or telling them what to do or not what to do? i helped you get back on track with each other, and this may seem egostistical, but you would never have done without that help. It was a bad idea. Maybe what you wanted at the time, but now, it isn't. I wish i never helped you, ever. Your a backstabbing, two faced, lying bitch. So don't you ever try telling people, who need help, that they shouldn't come to me with their problems. I'm sorry if i can make them happy and you can't, i'm sorry if i give better support than you, but deal with it. You just want them to trust you with their problems. give them one god damn reason why they should. Your like the queen bitch of chinese whispers. You glory in other peoples private lives, and then pretend it wasn't you fault that "so-and-so" knows about "them". Just admit it. At least to yourself, that there is no reason why anyone should trust you.  "*~-.I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you.-~*"

      I dont have a fucking clue what i'm gunna do. theres two guys, one i use to love, then one who fell in love with me and now ive fallen in love with him. the orginal guy still loves me to pieces and it's gunna break his fucking heart when he opens that email thats waiting in his inbox right now. The first guy, he loves me and yes deep down i love him to, but he's never around, he cant be due to work and loads of other shit. but i dont know him any more. I dont knwo fuck all about him, and i'll bet my backside he doesn't know anythign about me either. I love him still, but it looks like its gunna have to be just as a friend. I want to be there for him, but can't he see for a relationship to grow and to work, it needs time. not only length of time in genreal.. but time with each other. that doesn't exist anymore. I wish it was all different. I'm such a fucked person, i dont deserve for either guy to love me.  I dreamt last night... i dreamt i was talking to this first guy... it was so real, and i wanted it so bad, when i woke up, i tried to get right back to sleep so the dream could carry on. when i knew it couldnt, i ramed my head in my pillow and cried. i cried so much, ive cried so much for both of them. Everywhere i mentally and physcially turn, their constantly on my mind, my conscience, i can almost feel them attached to me by my back. I'm such a bitch, i dont want to hurt them, so i do nothing, but even doing nothing is killing them. lmao... "if life was easy"... if life was easy... if life was... i was gunna think of a smart remark.. but thers nothing. blank. emptyness. look what ive come down to. to help me surive ive always made jokes about life, but i cant even do that anymore. shit.. whats gunna happen? I Love Them.. and i dont know who i love more. and i cant be with either.. ever again.. for what i have done, will do, or anythign else that i may have hurt them by.  Someone help me escape please... I know what ive got to do... but the "right" thing will hurt people. It doesn't make sense anymore. As Alex says.. how can it be the right thing if it still hurts people? The lesser of two evils? fuck that. theres gotta be a way out.  "*~-.I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in his eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and he got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart.-~*"

      Sure, a word i made up, but many have this. Your reading this, thinking, yeah this girl has it. But is all this really melodramatic? MElodramtic seems to be "the word" at the moment, so many people going on about it. What if this word didn't exist? Sure, another word would be made for it, but would people try to understand help others before a word was made? Would people care more? Would you? Everyone around me is like this. Weather their complaining about others being melodramatic, they are being melodramatic too. this includes me too i guess huh? *every time i try to fly, i fall without my wings* When i write entries on this, there is alwasy music in the back ground. Right now it's the same one that was added onto the end of my last entry. Britney Spears, ok, maybe not the best kind of music, but this song is telling me how i feel right now. Melodramtic, go on, call me it, i dare ya ;). Another day at the work experience, ot covered in red paint. Every time i looked at it over my arms.. the only word running through my head was "blood". It was too damn similar, but completely different in so many ways. illogical i know. No cuts, but my wrists ache. I don't understand. Everytime i cry for a friend about it, everytime i think about what they must be going through, my wrists ache too, as if, as if i can feel there pain too? No sense i know, but still.   No ones perfect. No one. No one. So you out there, the one hiding behind that mask, don't try and believe you are. Cause your really not. What happens when that mask breaks? Crumbles to dust along with all the lies that have swamped around like a disease? Maybe it's too late. For you. But don't bring other people down with you. No one deserves that, even if they are not perfect.  People say that life would be boring if everything was.. was.. shit.. i've forgotten the word.. and.. it's not even on the tip of my tongue. Life would be boring if.. it wasn't how it is? Thats true, but not what i was looking for. Got it. Everything would be boring if everything was Easy. lmao, that paragraph kinda proves it. You wouldn't have read a load of bullshit if i hadn't have forgotten the word. It would have been easier. Do you want an easy life? If so, find somewhere else. But trust me, youll search and search, and when it finally hits you that there IS no easy way, your life would have gone, wasted, because of your stupidity. Or if u think that the easy way is to end it all, your stupid, foolish. Life may not be a bed of roses, but can u think of anything better? think about all the good times you have had, even though maybe the bad may swamp them over in pain and numbers. Something good will alwasy prevail, a Lover, a Friend, Someone Cares. Someone Really Cares About You. I don't give a flying fuck if you stand there telling me, "no, no one loves me, or if they do i dont deserve it". There is love out there, and most of us have unconditional love from someone.   I'm feeling i have more to type, as if, i could carry on forever in this entry. It may bore you, but this isn't for you. this is my life, and my life will not end until it does. Your gunna have to give me a fucking good kick to get me out of it at that. I won't let teenage depression, teenage stupidity, teenage "common sense", teenage LIFE GET THE FUCKING BETTER OFF ME. In the words of sarah "BECAUSE IF IT DOES, IT MEANS THEY'VE WON"... AND FUCK ME, I'M IN CONTROL OF MY LIFE, NOT MY EMOTIONS, NOT MY MIND, BUT ME. I AM NOT JUST A MASS OF RUNNING BLOOD, A MIX OF EMOTIONS, FEELINGS, DEPRESSION. I'M A PERSON, AND A PERSON HAS NO DEFINITION BUT "themselves"...

      Teenage life, yes katy, is full of "i hate this about me".."i'm so in love oh what am i to do". But think it through this way. It could be worse. Sometimes these are things we can't but help feel about ourselves. By the time we are older, we will see clearly who managed to struggle through of that and survive life. Life hasn't started for us, desipte all the stuff we say about how our parents have it easy etc. We're young, we do know right from wrong, doesn't mean we know how to handle each of those choices. We understand, but clearly, we don't always know how to deal with it. With all the people around me, and its a scary number who cut, who see it as an escape. I'm trying to feel i could never do that. But each day it gets closer. A year ago i thought people were crazy who would stupidly harm themselves... so why am i understanding now? it scares me, i don't want to understand this, cause what if then i find a reason? I feel each day i'm fighting it. I don't want to be like "them". It seems my other route to escapism.. which i thought was safer, isn't enough. It's caused a whole lot more problems. It comes ot stand there Is No escapism from any of it, and someone has got to stand up to it, fight it strong even if they are losing. Escapism is an excuse, and it never helps. We look for another route to take, to take us away from our previous one. Can any us actually say this has made it better? Cutting brings more problems, and my route thati took was different to cutting, but has brought just as many problems, maybe even more than my previous path. You can't escape it, so deal with it. I guess i've jsut figured that, for all the intelligence, common sense, nothing can buy or earn or learn realisation. IT's something that jsut suddenly dawns on you. Some people may feel realisation has dawned on them, only to find the next day, that they realise something else. We will never know the truth, and we will never be able to handle the truth in a right way. What is the "right" way? Tell me please. Before i do something stupid. Something i'll regret.  "*~-.Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby. And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby.-~*"

      Dontcha just love big brown bags? There mainly seen as an American thing, but when I know a shop gives you your items in a big brown bag, I just go in to buy something to get that brown bag  :D. dumb I know ;), but fun all the same :D.   Big spring clean today. Maybe it will clear my mind. A tidy room is a tidy mind they say. **rolls eyes** that’s probably something we’re just told to get us to clean. I admit, im not the tidiest person in the world, but id rather being DOING something than be cleaning up after something else. It’s such a bore. There’s so much work in here, all over the place. Most of it is probably important coursework, hidden under the depths of all the junk. I’ve re-set out my music system, now I got the speakers right in my direction, so it’s a loud and clear as could be. I love improvising! There propped up by books to there tilted backwards. You probably don’t want to know all this, so I’ll try think of a diff. Subject to talk about whilst I’m cleaning.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5 mins later~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I’ve started like a memory board, due to the cleaning out. Everything small thing like a concert ticket, a message from a friend, anything that has sentimental value, is stuck on my wardrobe door. 8 things so far, its looks quite pretty. I guess it’s like a good times memory board. When you look at it, you can’t help but smile, or at least feel sad in a good way. Lots of stuff flies by in your memory, friends, family, past, future, good times. We all need to be brought back to our past at  some points, especially if the present is getting to us.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~15 mins later~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Ok, tidying done. The music’s still going on the background, no-ones online. I think I’ll end this one, and no doubt, as soon as it’s published, I may think of something else to post, so I’ll just have to do another one ; ).  “*~-.And now I know who you, it wasn’t that hard, just to figure you out, and now I know who you are, it wasn’t that hard, just the figure you out”*~-.

      Ok, this is a day late, but simply because, my parents are fucktards. They friggin well have to d/c the Internet, WITHOUT telling me somewhere around 9. WHAT IS THEIR FUCKING PROBLEM?! So this is being typed in word, and will be pasted tomorrow when I get down stairs and turn the fucking thing back on.  Stats exam today. I got a D in my mock, so I hope to fuck its better than that I certainly revised more, and hope I scraped a C… maybe a B if I’m really lucky. I don’t think I could do with re-sitting it next year, it would KILL me. It’s bad enough we have as many exams as we do now, without this extra bloody one, which may I add, I have no interest in going into maths as a career.   Sometime I get so angry with my parents I wanna do something stupid, so they’d feel guilty. So they’d understand what the fuck they do to me. Sure I get friends telling how safe they are about exams. Exams are exams, and even if they weren’t safe about them, it wouldn’t do as much to me as what they do do now. They don’t understand I have a life outside work, despite them saying all I can do is my best. It pisses me off so much. I hate them sometimes so much that i just feel like smashing the closest thing next to me. Unfortunately this tends to be my monitor screen. They wonder why I spend so much time on my comp. Can’t they see? If I was down stairs with them, id go crazy, mental, do something that I would regret later.. if I was still alive to regret it later. The computers my escape. I know I talked about escapism causing more problems. But if I didn’t even have the choice to escape, I do something. Something, something.   I can’t wait to get out of here. When I’m old enough, I’m out. I don’t know how my brothers lasted until 21. I’d have gone at 18. Which I will. I cant stay here. I cant. I feel like screaming. Screaming as loud as I can. But I cant, if I do, even in a pillow, they’ll hear me ad wonder what the fuck is going on. I’ve tried to talk to them about it, but they dismiss it as a teenage tantrum.  My Mum reckons she doesn’t need to justify her decision. When she says that when I ask for an explanation on what she has decided. And she says to me, “I don’t need to justify myself Sarah, I’ve said no, so no” It Makes My Blood Boil SO FUCKING MUCH. I just wanna flip and smash something so hard. Just cos she’s older than me, doesn’t mean it gives her to the right to decide something without a reason. AGE IS JUST A NUMBER, most of the time I’ve got more bloody maturity than her. Admittedly not all the time. She understands stuff that I don’t really need her to understand. Like exams and work.. if she went on about it wouldn’t make ne difference. But she doesn’t understand the things I need her to. Like friends, my social life ( I DO HAVE ONE ). WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO MAKE HER SEE, TO MAKE IT CLEARER? It seems getting older is the only way, and there’s no way I can speed that up except grit my teeth and wait.   When I get out, I’m getting OUT. I don’t think I can stick around this country anymore. Sure it’s my entire life home place. But its brought so much shit, I wanna get away from that. “Somewhere Else! Here I Come!”.. Somewhere Else cause I don’t know the place name yet… America perhaps, maybe. Anywhere that’s isn’t HERE. Somewhere that isn’t a car journey for my parents to be able to come and visit…  Have you ever noticed how stress balls make you even angrier? The fact that u Fail to tear it, to smash it, to rip it, to destroy its existence, gets me so much angrier. Stress balls are SHIT. Normally sometimes paper works... Just ripping it and ripping it and ripping it… I haven’t hit anything, REALLY hit anything for days, and its getting to me. Hitting the keys hard on my keyboard helps a little, but if u fuck up your typing and u have to keep going back and back over and over and over again to correct it is infuriating. If I wrote this much in my coursework and essays id get A*’s all over the place. It flows when I’m talking about my feelings, but it doesn’t when I have to write about something that they’ve told me to write about. Your probably so bored and tired of this, or have stopped reading altogether. Wouldn’t blame you, but that isn’t gunna stop me. I could type for ages, and I might, or I might finish it right now… But I Won’t ; )  All this stress, hate, infuriation, anger is getting to me bad.. You may have noticed. I’ve been clenching my fists recently quite a lot, it helps temporarily.. But when you open your fist, see the nail indentations on your palm. You get angry again… and again…. And again. I feel like a timed bomb, and the fuse is getting shorter and shorter, I feel it even closer as each day goes by. Maybe it’s the PMS, I’m not too sure anymore. I have a feeling this will carry on, this hatred feeling about something, even after my PMS is gone. I think I know.. I think I know what it is.. I think I know what it is that I need. I need to be held. A safe hug, a safe pair of arms around me, someone who’s a male, im sorry all my girlfriends, I love you all, and we all hug each other, but it’s not the same. A hug that will last longer than a few minutes.. but for like a lifetime.. ok realistically. Just a long hug, a long hold. For about 10mins. Just so I know it will all be ok. I think it will dissolve all this anger and hatred. Please let me know if you can do this. Anyone? Thought not… This is why it gets back to the BF situation. Sure, people can love me, and I can love other people. But how comes you never love the one who loves you, and they never love you when you love them? It'’ unfair. You can't really learn to love someone… or can you? When you know someone loves you, do you get a stirring sensation in your tummy, telling you, “this persons loves you, and now, I can see that I love them too.”. I hope that it can work like that sometimes. True love or normal love? What’s the difference? True love you know, when you both love each other the same time, and you can’t live without them. If true love is that special, then how comes everyone feels like that when they’re in love? True love, normal love. There is no difference that’s what makes it so special.   I love him, he doesn’t know. I guess he never will. Can’t risk it. Maybe he does know, maybe he does. But fails to say anything. What can I do? I supposedly love someone else, but there can’t be the holding and the hugging and the kissing from that. It’s impossible.  “*~-.Hands one the mirror, can’t get much clearer, can’t make this all go away. Now that you’re bleeding, You stare at the ceiling, and watch as it all fades away.-~*”

      I think i dream most nights, but lasts nights one will stay in my memory for a very long time. I had more than one dream last night, but this one, has scared me so much. I can't remember who i was, why i was doing what i was doing, or even where i was. But put simply, i was killing everyone i've ever loved and known. A blade carried around in my hand, i struck people from the back and the front, right through their chest, killing them, thinking i was causing them minimum pain though. There were a few, the aim was missplaced and i had to stand there and watch how the pain effected their last few seconds of life. I reached out screaming when i knew they were feeling pain, through the mis-placed stabs. All i was thinking that.. if they were out of the way.. no one would know. No one would know anything anymore. Information is a dangerous thing. One of the most dangerous things in the world. You can fuck your weapons, your nucleur bombs. Your mind can be your most dangerous weapon in the world. Learn how to protect it, because not only can you use it against your enemy, but they can hit you right back with it. This dream has freaked me, and sure, it's just a dream. But from what i can remember, There was a reason i was killing everyone. If their was no reason, then i could just pass it off as another dream, meaning nothing, but when you do something as scary as that purposely?   When i was younger, everything was so much easier, the biggest complaint was "so-and-so" took my rubber, the biggest worry was what i was gunna get for christmas. Oh how i wish for those days now. We were innnocent. I don't mean that in the way when people say "oh sure your innocent, she has no dirty little secrets". i don't mean it in a sexual way. But in the way, we were oblivious to everything dangerous to us, hell we were oblvious to everything around us. Then as realisation sets in as each year goes by, you feel your losing ground, and as you stretch out for your past, it slips through your hands like grains of sand.  The whole package and posting of getting older i guess. It's true, A Lot Can Change In A Few Years... A Lot Can Happen In A Few Days. Scary but true. Can you look back, and see a part of your life, where everything just flipped upside down in a matter of days, and it seemed totally out of your control? I'm sure you can. And i bet you regret it.

      I know theres so much i have to say, so much to type, but so much that its all gone into one big blurry mess, and i dont even know where the beginning is in my mind anymore. I know i should sit down, think it all through in order, then type, but ive got this urging feeling that i have to do it now, weather i know it or not.   I guess in a way, its on the equilibrium of it worried and feeling guilty about... to it all being sorted out. It's been cleared but not completely. There are still loose ends that need to be tied. Thats the best way i can describe it. Loose ends... But the thing about loose ends... if u dont tie them up, they fray, discintergrate, breakdown and split, until u can't use them anymore. But what if him leaving will cause the loose ends to fray? What if they can't be fixed. I guess i'll just have to hold onto those ends as tightly as possible, to avoid any more damage.   I'm started to get really seriously worried about my weight. With the worrying about loads of shit, to the kids at my work experience job, to the constant "something or other" on my mind, i guess the stress burns more calories than i can fit into my mouth.  I'm getting so tired recently, and its not like normal. i'm sleeping like 9-10 horus a night, and i'm still waking up tired. It's got to be the weight. 7 stone and falling... I'm trying, so hard, so hard, to put that extra little bit of weight on, that hopefully will make the difference. Maybe thats why my cycle was shorter this time *sorry guys, u didn't wanna know*.. but the girls will understand, you know what i'm normlly like, it was only a week this time.   i get tired at the most menial jobs, and my wrists ache after only a little while typing. I'm falling apart, almost disspearing and there doesn't seem to be anything i can do about it. Wouldn't that be weird.. if one day.. i'd just.. disspeared? i just literally didn't exist. Who would notice?  "*~-.Spinning, laughing, dancing, to her favourite song, a little girl with nothing wrong is all alone.

      Theres so much has happened since my last post.. and its not like i posted a month ago, or hell even a week! is it just a day? or two perhaps? goes to show why i write here on average once a day.  Remember when i said about "the email is laying in his inbox right this second".. well he only got it a week later.. which was.. last night, or the night before. i can't remember, the days mould together on here and i lose track of time completely. He came online and i started asking him if he was ok, only to find out he hadnt actually read it. as i feared, he's gone now. dont know how long, but he will be back. i've really hurt him, weather its an act or not, if it is, hes a pretty damn good actor. I fear "the family" blame me for him not being around, everyone loves him. I never wanted to hurt him, but the circumstances were not the easiest. I might seem insensitive, but i hope we can still be friends. We were like really good friends before it kinda became something more. I'm scared he's gunna hate me for this, or even if he says he doesnt, deep down he always will. And i'm also scared that there will absolutly nothing i can do about that, but let it be. but i can't do that, or at least i don't want to, because he is and alwasy will be a important part of my life. The only good thing that came out of this, is that there is ony one guy in the picture right now. God knows whats that gunna go like, seems irrelevant now.

No one gives a fuck sucking damn about it, so why the fuck do you think I would be happy to deal with you bitching about me. Look around you bitch, do you see what i see? Do you see the truth and the real reason why people deal with your shit? Cause their scared, that's it. Their fucking scared to stand up to a fucktard, well guess what... You've just found one bitch who won't deal with your shit any longer. Someone will and has to make a stand, and i'm feeling sorry for those who try to stand in my way...

      Ah it's good to be back with the noisy neighbours, the polluted roads, the odd piece of dog shit for every foot you walk down the road. As i said, it's good to be back. This weekend has been terrible. I've caught a damn cold from one of the kids at the work experience place, this has developed to a kind of fever. I stupidly drank on the saturday night. Woke up at 5am the sunday morning and was puking down the toilet. What a lovely way to start the day. I have now suffered a bad hangover headache the whole of today, only being able to eat dry biscuits and milk. The moral of this story... Never Drink... when your ill ;). That is definatly a lesson to learn. On top of all of that i've still got teh constant guilt feeling in my stomach at the amount of coursework that i have to do for Grad. I think i'll resign myself to the hall for next week, im more likely to get quality work done then.   Your probably not interested in this part of the entry but it's about the "first guy".. cast your memories back, i'm sure you'll remeber him. Well him saing he wasn't gunna be back for a while, he was back yesterday aprently, and i was away. I guess its for the best, im not gunna be his favourite person atm. But he said he wasn't back for good, but he stayed his usual amount of time (15 mins), then took off again, just like always. I hope he comes on again soon, am missing him, i don't want him to hate me for this. I'm sure thats a hard thing to ask for, but i hope it's not impossible. I hope he doesn't some how resent me for being there, we've gotta find a away to be around eahc other at least, for the rest of them. I still love him, do i want him to see this? Maybe yes, maybe no. Which would cause more damage?

      Back to school. What pleasure it brings me to smell the smell of coffee, the musty scent of rain from all the childrens raincoats, the slip of mud on the floor from the build up of shoes... I haven't posted much, and even when i have, recently they haven't been long. This is due to the horrid amount of coursework that i have to do for graduation. And even thought right now, i have about 5 pieces on my back, i'm determind to get a good posting in here, since it started off so well.  Sitting here, i can see the raindrops on my window faintly through my nets. The tree is fighting a battle against the wicked whip of the wind, you can almost see a character out of it... a real struggle. The cars all look dank and lonely, in one straight line, kept in control. Everything have a greyish haze about it, despite the colour.   Thankyou for yesterday :D you know who you are. and despite katys remark of, "what if they don't actually know who they are", i assure, this person does ;). I'm sorry if i seemed, i dunno, kind of stand offish today, guess i didn't know what to say, maybe enough had been said yesterday, i'd run out of words :).  When you claim that someone is two faced, does this mean that one of them is the real them? What if, the real one is hidden, and they still have two extra sides. Some people refuse to let you dig deeper to find their real selves, and the cover that you get, you find it hard to believe a word they say to you. You bitch about me behind my back, but tell me you see me as a friend? What's that about? If you don't like me, don't pretend you do for my sake. Just tell me. Or do you have a problem with honesty? I'm not as feeble or weak as you may think, so don't think it would destroy me to know the truth. Just spit it out, and it let it be over with.  "*~-.If you see walking down the street staring at the sky draggin my two feet, you just past me by it still makes me cry but u can make me whole again, and if u see me with another man, laughing and joking doing what i can, i wont put you down cause i want you around, you can make me whole again.-~*"

      ...In the words of Joey :D. In past short past, i guess me and Joey have perhaps avoided each other? Maybe not avoid... but never gave each other the chance to get to know each other i guess? I don't know from her point of view, but it seems we're hitting it off ok. I'm aware she's wary of me, maybe for reasons i know, maybe not. but hopefully i can somehow reassure her that there isn't any reason to be :). I'm just a normal gal after all, and Joey is an exceptionally beautiful person. I'm not hitting on her guys!   Thats all i guess, just smiling all the way this evening despite the brink of graduation on my back for tomorow, which btw, i will not pass! I'll do work at the weekend, i'm just really not in the mood this evening, am too happy! Mondays my grad. day, and the worst thing will be, is i'll miss the first part of my Art day, IF that is still happening *rolls eyes*. Some teachers have never heard of communication! They senior staff do not know about our Art day! i think miss Evans is leading a one man army for this day! lol!  "*~-.I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm the world's greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my back's against the ropes I can feel it, hmm I'm the world's greatest.-~*"

      Today was good, made a friend very happy (I hope). She has a crush on my bro, and since he's leaving work at the school, i got him to come over and give her a big hug. she was ecstatic!  Rainy day today, he kind of ignored me, i wonder why. Did i do something wrong? Feelings and emotional expressions are strange little things. What would we do without them though?   Sitting in the R.S lesson, watching everyone around me. All staring at a computer screen. Some people playing games and some simply getting on with something of mild entertainment. Peace and tranquility compared to most lessons. Why can't it always be like this? But no, somethings gotta ruin it, somehow, somehow.

      Thank Fuck it's the weekend, that's all i can say. Despite I have to go to work this evening.... from 7:30-11:00... AND i'll be doing physics coursework during that time (babysitting), It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling through my tummy that there is no school tomorow!  Eeeee! I have my clothes ALL sorted for next Thrusday (Non-uniform day), which consists of my new black boots and skirt :P, t-shirt and jacket thing. I'm so excited, only ever worn a skirt once at school before, and that was with tights ANd a uniform skirt so it didn't do much for me! :D ~Does a lil dance~.. Is it possible to be in love with something materialistic? *sigh* My Boots...  Well despite the *suppose to* of graduating today, i, put simply, didn'. I'll get the rest of the work done this weekend and get graduated Monday no problemo! :D. Although there is ICT, Physics and Tech... We have another Tech day next Thrusday, so none of us will graduate until next Thursday Anyway! :D.  Am concerned for a friend right now, and from this, he'll probably know who he is. I read his diary, i'm worried that he'll get trapped where he is, in this depression mode of hating himself, or hating stuff about himself, and he won't be able to get out. If it IS any conselation, i can see tings good about you. Even if you can't see them, at least try to see tht has to be a reason why i see them?? It's logical. Take care sweetie.  "*~-.Let me sleep For when I sleep I dream that you are here. You're mine And all my fear is left behind I float On air So I can see the face I long to touch To kiss But only dreams can bring me this So let the moon shine Softly on the boy I long to see And maybe when he dreams He'll dream of me.-~*"

      So much that i should be doing, and i'm doing my... third? entry for today. I'm wasting extremly precious time i know. This is a great chance to graduate all lessons except Tech this Monday... But.. i just can't. I have the incapability to do this... This was the other poem i wrote, before i wrote the other one earlier.  Peace The sound of silence The breaking of spells The insecurity The arrogance wells  Love The eternal message The emotional dream The pain in your chest That rips from the seam  Escapism The ticket to release The run away train The self blinding thoughts Of what this will gain  We want all three But detest them too And push them away When they come near you  What do these poems show? What kind of person i am? From these would you say im deep? Melodramtic? Typical teenager?.. Or would you hold complete different view? that i know what i'm on about? That i talk from experience? Does this all seem melodramtic to you? Yes, From life on from death after.  Breaking through i'm letting my mind do the word forming for me. Why is it so true, why do we want people to know something without actually telling them? Why can't life be all of this.  I love the music, i hate the beat. I love my friends, i hate to sleep. I love the taste, I hate the food. I love the feeling, I hate the mood. I love to rhyme, I hate to write. I love to escape, I hate the height. I love to think, I hate to know. I love to love... just ain't that so...

      Blood rushing round me I stare in disbelief Of how someone could do this Just for their own release.  So what do they gain? From all this self hating What does the cutting do for them? For death, they are just waiting  Something starts to ease itself Into my concious mind I'm trying to tell myself something But i left myself behind  What is it, that is so important That's raw to my ear Its getting closer, i can't escape My ignorance starts to hear  Wide eyed it finally hits me That blood, that's rushing round Isn't from anyone else ...But mine, i make no sound  I think it's too late for regrets My time is running short The grains of sand that pass my time Deep breathing my breath is caught  I look around, i'm lying down No energy to stand I close my eyes, and simply wait Too late for a helping hand...  ...Before you say anything, this is not a suicide note...

      Saturday. And i just woke up about an hour ago :D. its 1:13pm. I guess the reason of late sleepies was the fact i didn't GO to sleep until 2-3am last night/this morning. Freshly showered and well.. refreshed! I know have the thought of all the wonderful coursework that i have to do, that i didn't do to graduate this Friday -.- Hmm... i should get dressed...  The online list is pretty empty on both messengers today. Where is everyone?? Meh.. i think i'll go out to get some lunch soon, can't be bothered to cook!  Tomorow is gunna be a long day :P. Sarahs' sis' Bda party rite? Correct me if i am wrong, for i do not want to turn up at your house, with no party! :D Thats just not right!  ...Ever tried to understand someone, and feel that your either intruding into their private life, or to Them, throught Their eyes, looks like you just want to be nosy. What do you do, when your trying to understand someone, because you want to help them, but they just don't realise that? Is it Losing battle? Will you lose the War... If it takes over them, then they will be the ones losing the war. Tranquility.

A long exausting day, was helping out with Sarahs lil sis' Bday party. 13 kids. mostly 7 yr olds.. or a slight variation. It was tiring but fun.. thankyou So So So Much Sarahs Mum and Dad :D... The £20 was so nice you, you shouldn't have!! The chocolates are so yummy!  There are wonders and secrets and all things glam *giggles* about having a converted loft... Especially one that has a plasterboard floor.. in which case any hard banging *Flicks head again* Will surely either be heard or at least create some sort of dent or hole in the floor below you. I'll never let you forget that day, just like you'll never let me forget teh karaoke we did for ENTERTAINMENT.. Was ENTERAINMENT.. We PURPOSELY SANG BADLY PEOPLE.  I know have the worry of two pieces of coursework for tomorow. which yes, i should be doign right now... I think i'll achieve the physics for tomorow, but the ICt.. I'll be in the hall. I guess i don;t mind too much, but it's gunna be full of the rudes pratting about while they take the piss outta me. There arn't that many people who i know closely that will be in there, except sarah. Please Sarah I Beg You.. don't do the ICT tonight, be with me tomorow! I know we'll be on diff. tables but just knowing someone else will be there! Please! On this note, i shall leave a an appropriate song lyric, that i hope will help me :D lmao!

      Oh the joys of no sports day... are very few... -.- I start to madly rush around this morning, trying to make myself look Half decent... I walk outside... it is raining. I jump in the car.. race round to katy to pick her up... It is still raining. We drive up the to common, park in the car park, and guess what? yes your right, it is Still Raining. Me and katy trudge over to the track... wet.. surprise surprise.. It Is STILL RAINING. We then hear a voice... on the loud speaker... Sports is cancelled. The cheers are enormous... and the delight on peoples faces, until everyone freezes, and the joy is no more... We would return to school.. to presume our period 2 lessons. After intially shock, everyone smiles, thinking "ah he's kidding".. He is not. So we walk through the park back to school (yes, Still Raining).  Ah.. We arrive at our beloved school... I wish i could take a moment here to.. to.. describe the wonderful surroundings that our school carries, yet, due to the.. FUCKING RAIN... i am sadly left to say, that i cannot...  We enter our form room, one which may i take a moment to say... will only be our form rom for a few more days. Oh how i'm gunna miss that room... Evan doing the monkey bars across the supporting bar on the ceiling... The table jumping on a wet afternoon... The moisterising cream being plastered against the walls... ah memories... anyway, where was i? oh yes...  So we enter our form room. Only people there are a few guys from our class plus Me Katy and Mary. Everyone else is either not competiting.. or have taken a short cut... home... from the track to school. We finally get a call to our rom syaing, IF you would LIKE to go home.. go to the year office then you cnn call your parents asking them if it's alright for you to go home. YEY the freedom.. i walk out of the school down welham.. oh how i wish i coudl end that by saying i arrived home. I cannot. We got stopped by Bitch Queen of the Century, Miss Hamal. (sp? dont give a shit). She seemed unbelieving that me and Mary were allowed to go home.. and said to us.. "are you sure you wouldn't like to go back to the year office, to double check that you can go home, to you have a clear conscience?" i was like.. "No.".. We walked off... leaving her behind. Don't give a flying fuck, I hate her. She tried to take my freedom away from me.  Alas, i arrive at home.. FINALLY.. and guess what? It has STOPPED rainging... I sit here eating my lunch that was made for sports day.. including a high amount of sugar for teh races.. which i will feel the effects of later.  Went to Rockburst last night, was really really good. My bros group were having a laugh and some of the bands were actually ok. One minor slip up... "the Plan" didn't really go...well... according to plan. It was fixed though.. I called my brother he came BACK... and gave Joey his favourite Guitar Pick to keep. It was funny, she wouldn't let any one touch it.. infact.. she wouldn't let any one LOOK at it, in fear it would destroy some sort of "Samness" about it!  Anyway, i still have coursework for graduation *cries* Better get on before i regret it... Love ya guys *mwah*  "*~-.I could have lied, i'm such a fool, my eyes could never never never keep their cool, I showed her and i told her how she struck me but i'm fucked up now.-~*"

      End of school. End of the year. 7 weeks of Holiday...  locked in my own mind .  &nbsp;    ...Now that you did this, you ask for forgiveness, doctor will you be my priest. You say your mistaken but look what you've taken, you laugh as you lie through you teeth...  &nbsp;  Sure, school finshed at midday, but my day didn't end until around 5pm. 5 hours of mainly.. depressivness. Not to offend you guys, it's not that you were boring or destroyed my day, but you know what i mean, i knwo you know what i mean.  &nbsp;  As they get closer to me, trying to find out more, trying to be less obvious about it,  they fail . I push them away furthur. They can't see me, not really, they see a teenager. That Is All. They refuse refuse refuse to believe i am who i am, i hate them for this. It's too late for them now.  It's too late.  You can't decide to walk back into my life, when you want to be nosy, to know about who i am when it   suits you.   You had your chance, you've blown it, i'm going far away when i can. Maybe we'll patch things up, but you've missed out this stage.  &nbsp;    ...From what you do. Because of you...  &nbsp;  I've figured out what i'm doing. I realised in woolworths  (of all places)  This "escapism" isn't really what i thought it was. I'm not free. I'm... It's like... I locked in a sqaure, a small box. Inside this box ive made another smaller box, this is the one  in which i hide.  I stay in this smaller box with everyone else, apart from the peopel i let in, kept in between the outside box and the smaller box. " They " are trying to dig their way through the wall that i have put up.. and from the inside i build this way back up again. At the expense my space is now smaller.. and will get smaller and  smaller  as i avoid it.  &nbsp;    ...You know i can't be there each time that you call, i swore not to come but i'm here after all...  &nbsp;  Adam, i've tried.  Talking.. Talking  God knows i've tried talking... and guess what? She reacted JUST as i expected... and the fact is... When i tried to say something to clear up a certain issue... The result brought MORe issues and the old one became stale, left alone, and the point of all was now destroyed and had caused mroe problems. Its a vicious loop, that i cant escape. Everytime i hit out to push through those walls, they rebound back, pushing me in.  &nbsp;    ...I know by the look that I see In your eyes I won't stand around and I won't watch you die...  &nbsp;  I'm not free. I never was, i never will be... No thats not true.. I will be, weather  they  like it or not. They can call it teenage tantrums, whatever. I want them to understand, i want them to know. You can't have everything in life, so i'll just have to wait for it... and it  will  come.  &nbsp;    ...From what you do...     &nbsp;

      Am back! It was easier enough. they were both asleep and stayed that was so i was well lucky. Watch stars in their eyes.. i know.. i was BORED. Also experiemented around with my makeup! I think this style works on me : ). The headache is building up from a long, hot, stressful day, so i think i may takea time out break tommorow&nbsp;despite the work that i wuold like to get out of the way so i can properly enjoy my hols. I was just curious. Kaalia (is tht the name?), did you like my&nbsp;diary because of all the depressiveness??? or the typical teenagerisms?? hm... it made me think, am i that typical? Or is it because i&nbsp;try&nbsp;to explain these things, why we all look like typical teenagers, but when really, we are individual people, with individual emotions and feelings. Sounds all melodramatic again doesn't it? *sigh*&nbsp;I guess thats something i will nevre escape from. Until. I. Get. Older. And honestly? i don't want to. &nbsp; Yeah, i've tried changing the template. That is the main reason why i lost all the individual tweaks i made to my prev. one. Didn't make ne difference. Damn techonology, and i call myself a ICT student *rolls eyes* HTML coding isn't one of my strongest points :P I perfer the graphical side of a webpage, instead of the "behind the scenes". &nbsp; Is it just me? or is anyone else here dying of the heat? I love summer, but whats the point in goign thru humidity, at night? When you can't even get a tan?! How crazy is that? *smirks: knowing Katy and Sarah shall by rolling eyes at such a typical "saz" remark* &nbsp; I guess thats all. Theres nothing exciting having happened today... oh wait. &nbsp; At the birthday thing... i'm sad to say one of the elder family has Alzeimas (sp?). It gets worse by the year and you feel so sorry for him. Today, he dissapeared whilst we were at this birthday. The whole entire family became a search party. People jumped in their cars and drove around the entire area, the people who couldn't drive (e.g. me) walked around. Despite the danger he was in, and due to the fact i was walking and not concertraint on driving, i realised at what a great family he has. Everyone just dropped EVERYTHING. It was a beautiful moment. This is not meant in disrespect. We found him, thank god. He was safe. &nbsp; "*~-.&nbsp;Let me sleep For when I sleep I dream that you are here You're mine And all my fear is left behind.-~*"
