      Quick entry.  I'm SO blessed, it's amazing. I've this wonderful senior, yu hui, who has been such a great help to me. I have to do an essential graphics research paper, and I just asked him if he had his last year's paper, he said no, but instead of just stopping there, he went on to help me decide on what to do, tell me how to score, and basically what to cover! (Ok now I find out he's up rushing to complete an assignment he has to hand in tmr. That just makes it so much more lovely. =))  Everything's just landing in place. Just right. And I'm just loving how everything is going great. I'm not worried about my deadlines, as near as they are. Taking one day at a time. Great great great!!  This peace too, it's supernal. Peace isn't milk, honey, water, aroma therapy, the sound of waves.. that's not peace. Cos then once you get out of that, and into the real world, then you lose your peace! But noo, this peace in me, is there, regardless of the circumstance, the surrounding, the situation. It's just mind boggling. I don't understand how anyone can feel this sort of rest in such worrisome times. But with God all the unexpected and unexplainable happen. And I'm not complaining.  Now I can really sleep in peace. Everything's going well, with God's grace. :)  Man, i'm loving it.

      Sha la la.. Everybody should be happy. Sha la la.. aahhhh. =)  I think this is a fantastic idea. To have a blog, that no one knows of. With no tagboard. So that no one can leave silly comments. I won't have to worry about what I write, who I write about, who reads what I write. Awesome.   OK so ziliang you know about this. Let me know if you're reading this, cos then if I want to write something about you.. heh. Anyway I doubt you even took note of this address of mine, of maybe you did. Hm.  Anyway! I'm giving up on OD. Because, well, as much as I miss the people who have 'journeyed' with me, I feel that sometimes, I'm writing for them to read, and not entirely what I want to write. Sometimes I make sure I write something.. deep and insightful, or something well written at least, because I feel that they expect that from me. Whereas here, I can be as candid as I want! yahoo! =)  From the last time I wrote, quite a number of things have happened. National Day for one. I felt particularly blessed on that day. It was, amazing. Just being able to be there to soak in the singaporeanism was perfect. The mood was so revved up. Not from my side of course, I'm secretly patriotic. heh. But just seeing the children, the familes, the couples, coming together in red just to celebrate our country's birthday warms my heart. The Kallang Wave, the national anthem, the pledge, seeing the cabinet ministers, all these country related things, they can make me cry! But i'd never participate in it. I don't know, maybe it's my detached personality? I have all these emotions that I find so hard to express. Or am just reluctant to express. Always so shy, so reserved, so protected and guarded. I try, I try to tell people when I appreciate them. I guess I'm just learning how to do that. He's my first 'experiment'. but then when I start saying how I feel I start feeling vulnerable. It's complicating, my self. But anyway, National day was one of those days. When I felt my spirit rise up, when I saw myself juts joining in the fun, but yet there I was, just happy to observe such innocent joy. I love Singapore. I love what this country has done for me. For my ability to go home at 3 in the morning, and not be worried that someone might've planted a bomb in my taxi. I love that is has given me a peace of mind, an opportunity for an education, and I love the effort they put in. Into things like raising funds for the aged, the disabled, the sick. Into trying to make sure everyone gets heard. Into trying their best to carry out their job as protective 'parent'. Just the trying makes a difference. Not everyone can do things perfectly, and for that I feel defensive when I hear someone say something, anything negative about the government. We're just common people. And running a country is not an easy task.  The day after that. Photoshoot with Carolyn Strover. We did some amazing shots. It was for an art piece, and it tied in with the glamour fashion VS glutton sloth theme. Heavy make up, raw meat, kidneys, and rolls and rolls of film. I'm beginning to get used to posing for the camera. haha. :) Yes, I want it. I want to be a model. I want it to be a paying job. As a sideline. Dream. And the first step of success is dreaming! Hmmmm. :)  Wednesday was a self time day for me. I watched the first VCD of Love Actually (He lent it to me witih no disc 2! That was kinda disappointing.), had instant noodles, and basically did... nothing. I missed that feeling. Haha.  Thursday. Group meeting. Breakfast with Zhen. Mid week bible study. Zhen and I had our last meal for like, a year. She's off to Canada, and she's not even coming back for this christmas because the flight home'll be really expensive. So she's spending it in London. It's so strange, just listening to the conversations we have. 'So Clare was doing this this this and this.' 'Oh really? How come I don't remember this? Where was I?' 'You were in Hong Kong.. No wait, I think that was the time you were backpacking in Vietnam.' 'Right. Sigh, my next christmas will probably be in London. Raine might be there too!' 'Great, I'll be in Angmokio.' 'Aw bel maybe you can come along to London! Clare might be going to Spain.' ... What happened to 'I'll be in changi, want to meet me in pasir ris?' Globalisation. I hate it. It's stealing my friends. Group meeting went quite well. As much as some people in my class irritate me, I must say that my group members and I work quite well. Every single thing has been a blessing. The place I'm at, the time, they're truly outcomes of God's grace. I'm just so in awe everyday. Every single moment is a living testimony to this amazing God that has blessed me in so many incredible ways. Bible study. I brought Charles along. I keep wanting to bring zl but, well, i don't know. It's like I'm practically scared to talk to him about religion just because like he said, it's a touchy subject. And I don't think I want to risk getting anyone uncomfortable so I try to just shut up. BUT. I keep praying. and praying. and praying. And once the time is right, I'm confident he'll embrace God's gift. Sometimes I want to just shout it out, I want to tell teh mountains that I'm deepy loved by the creator of this universe. It's overwhelming. And I want to spread this good and joyous news. But you know me, inexpressive-able. heh. Slowly, slowly.  Today.. Friday. I went for a meeting with Darryl David, Tania and Grace. It was about this tuesday's talk in IJ about CMM. I can't wait for that. I miss IJ so much. The teachers, the family atmosphere, my school friends. Even though they won't be there, the thought of IJ just brings me back to them of course. Our canteen scavenger days.. Sigh. Anyway. We're going back to IJ to give a talk. And I'm going to be talking for awhile! yay.  After the meeting I headed down to town, yes, by myself, to just walk around. I ended up spending 50 dollars! On this gorgeous scarf, some rings, and that's it I think. I must say I'm pretty impulsive. But it's a personality characteristic too! It makes me feel, special. Self love. :) Then, it was the FCBC's Spook Show. I didn't see a point in it, and I didn't agree with the way they portrayed it either. It was like the devil had more screen time than Jesus did. The best way to reign victorious over the devil is by ignoring him. The most painful rejection is ignorance. Don't tell us what ghosts are. Don't tell us what the ouija board can do. Don't tell me how many witches there are, how many vampire wannabes exist. I don't want to know. What we need to know is that Jesus died for our sins. And he did not just die to redeem us for our sins, but also to give us wholeness. Jesus is IT. That is IT. There is no more devil. What devil?! The devil cannot even touch the hem of Jesus' garment. He cannot even smell the ground Jesus walks on. The devil fails to even be in the same picture as Jesus. So I really didn't agree with how they chose to present Jesus. He was such a 'by the way'. And he's not a by the way. He's IT. He's all there is, all there should be. Ahhh i love Jesus. I love you so so much. Because you died for me, because in you I have everything, because you gave me righteousness as a gift, and because you have shown me that I can do all things through you, I can be all I want to be in you, and I can have all I want    with your righteousness. I can reign in life. :) Yet, I was glad I went. I needed to know what went on in other churches. I pray zl was at least touched, in some way. I can arleady see it, the day.. that day.. that.. well.. i just want everyone I love to have this amazing experience. Life can be so great. The journey can be so smooth. It can be enjoyable, un-stressful, and blessed, blessed, and blessed. I have this life, and I just want him to have it too. zl, and ping, and jess.. and even min juli and mabel, those who believe there's a God but don't have the clear picture. I'm so glad I'm in new creation, it's been the answer to all my questions. See, there you go, i'm blessed. :)  Well. i should probably head off to bed. This has been quite a lengthy entry. I must've gotten carried away. heh. Goodnight everyone.  Shalom!  Noise: Live Out Loud by Steven Curtis Chapman.

      It's a saturday night, 11.59pm, and I sit here feeling slightly lonely, a bit more delighted, grateful by the basketful, doing some late night reconnaissance of the Christabel military base.  The week has run by as smooth as clockwork, but much faster. Two days of studying, two days of tests, one day of work, one day of rest, one day of weekend. My two papers, Journalism:NewsWriting and Media and Society went perfectly. The studying days were trying, but successful. My Friday, that was more interesting.  Friday morning I was talking to a friend of mine, Field, online. It was a highlight just because we had a conversation. A conversation! I haven't had a conversation with him for like, eternity. He's always either not replying me, or giving me mono-syllabic answers, or making me feel absolutely dumb. So it was a very refreshing change. I know this might seem so out of point, but God is so good. I've had a silent prayer, that field and I would go back to being friends. And that favour might rest upon him. We'll see how it progresses. Friday evening, was work at the Ritz Carlton. Nadya Hutagalung (the MTV vj) and her mom were having a joint exhibition and because I work for the art management, I was helping out. It was, interesting. This guy who's at least 35 asked me for my number. I don't get it, I always attract the people I don't want to attract. Either old old men, or guys my age. I'm not complaining, it's very flattering, but still. When it comes to guys I actually want to go out with, my presence feels just about as welcomed as a nagging knot in a shoulder or a clog in a lymphatic node. Such is life. After work I met Charles for a drink. We headed down to Boat Quay and just 'chilled'. And he stole my hair clip. Hmm. Got home, was online for awhile.  Today was more fructuous. After nonsense with my dad, which I don't feel like writing about, I headed to church for our live recording. We had 2 solid hours of praise and worship, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I just keep feeling like there is so much to thank God for. I wouldn't be where I am today, nor what I am today if not for God's grace. It's been just providential, and I feel so special every single day, even if there are just small things that make me smile. I wasn't always like this, but recently it's just been so.. real. I've always been a cynical skeptic, but I've learnt that once you just poke a hole in that barrier, God's grace can flood you. It happened to me at least. And if anything that great can happen to me, it can happen to anybody. Anyhow, let's get back to the day. When I was about, 11 or 12, I stayed in the Good Shepherd Crisis Centre, which is basically for women and children of...broken up or breaking up families. It's a small humble place, where I grew the most. During my stay there my brother and I made friends with this awesome guy, Arnold. He's my age and was my brother's best friend at that time. Well after he left the centre we've searched for him but never found him. I knew he was in SJI (the school) so i looked through the yearbooks, asked my friends from there, but I couldn't remember his surname so, couldn't find him. Now. Today, at the live recording, my mom was sitting alone cos my caregroup had an extra ticket for her. I reserved a seat for her, and went off. When I went back to look for, I found her talking to this.. boy. I went up and, after much staring and wondering, found out that it was Arnold! AND, that his mom was there too, sitting just 3 seats away from the seat I reserved for my mom! These people are such a precious part of my memory, because I did things with them when I was nothing. Having friends when you're something isn't that exciting, because you know they're friends with you because of.. well, something. But knowing people when there's nothing to you is just, magnificent. Well he's in NJC (junior college) now doing triple science and math. He's always been a bright kid. I'm still overwhelmed with joy! I haven't seen him in 5 years, and now I find out he's in my church, and that his mom's been going there since 1998. I was as happy as a moonbeam! It was just such a thrill. I don't think anyone'll understand it till they actually experience it. It's wondrous. Then I went for a concert-the Singapore Wind Symphony, a friend of mine, Aloysius, plays the drums for it and it was so so good. Aloysius is just so... genuine. I'm so thankful to have classmates like him and not some crazy lost and superficial bunch of wannabe teenagers, but rightfully kids. Well.  Reflection. -I cannot stand un-gentlemanly guys. I just can't, and this week i've seen so many. It exasperates me. -Time alone is time best spent. Sometimes just getting away from the elegiac sadness hidden in the eaves of the world does best for the spirit. I spend much of my time in school alone, and I treasure it. Yes I have friends, but time alone is calming. -I don't understand why people get drunk. Is throwing up on your jeans really THAT cool? -I'm addicted to Third Day's Love Song. -I miss you, but you don't know it. I've said this before, if you don't understand my silence you will not understand my words. It disappoints sometimes. -Promiscuity is a childish, immature, and desperate cry for recognition. I wish I could tell her to just give it up. Sleeping with one extra person doesn't make you anymore whole a person. Only God can do that. -I'm honestly scared. Scared of losing my friends. Domi's gone to India, and she was the 'bridge' between me and the rest, just because I was closer to her. Ping, juli, mabel, jess, daph, mori, lange, min, I love them all but not all of them realise that friendship requires effort. Some are just starting school, some are leaving for uni, some are just here in the flesh but nothing more. Terrifies me. I'm 17, and growing up. Blessed in all ways imagineable, complete and satisfied to my last drop. Reflections are just a presentation of all the funny-sad effluvia of maturity. My days have been good, but reality sometimes gets to harsh, and dampening. But! The joy of the Lord is my strength. =) I just like to rant once in awhile, and be a little more...worldly.
