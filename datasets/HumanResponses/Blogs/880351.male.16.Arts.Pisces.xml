      BLOODY HELL IM DAMN PISSED. MY PIANO STRING BROKE. not one, but TWO!!!! AND BOTH ARE MY C2 STRINGS!!!! now how the hell am i supposed to play huang he!? WTF IM GONA LOSE LYK MONTHS OF PRACTICE!!!!! DAMN!!! I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT!!!! WHY ARE ALL MY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS PIECES OF SHIT!? I HATE IT!!!!! MY MICROPIPETTE TIPS ARE EITHER CONTAMINATED OR BROKEN OR DIRTY LOST. my stupid harmonica only has 20 notes, cant play the top B and the bottom D. so pissing off. my stupid piano ive lots to say about it. i havent tuned it for 7 years already. (6 years and 10.5 months to be abit more precise) my C2 just broke, alot of the keys are very unresponsive and too mellow in tone, my F3 sometimes sticks to the bottom, my G5 also got problem, one of the most pissing ones is C7. its lyk sunken halfway and i cant make nuts of a sound out of it. neighbouring keys lyk B6 C#7 D7 all have this kind of lag time lor. and den alot of the keys are lyk, sounds HORRIBLE. my notes at the end are going out. and worse off is my sheng. at its "best" my F#5 was in effect perpetually on the deathbed, my D6 was dead indeed, Eb4 was bad, Eb5 was worse- sounds as if it got pneumonia. E5 also cranking up, B5 was really bad after it took 2 falls, B4 was even worse off. yet, kudos to mr ong who tried to get the FB to buy another sheng (though, even with the combined efforts of me and andrew, still failed) :( in fact, yihao is gona inherit my rubbish and were not gona get gold for syf already. kiss it goodbye. listening to tchaikovsky's 1st to drown my sorrows... the melody is lyk so overwhelming and overpowering.. i love it.im now gona pester my mum to change piano. either a solid grand piano which she wil NEVA agree to cuz im gona hafta knock down the damn walls for the piano to enter. OR a silent piano, you know the type which you can damp the thing and play silently and wear headphones? thats also quite cool. but on the other hand im wonderin whether wearin the headphones will get in my way of playing. sigh. sometimes this is lyk so pissing off. lyf's lyk that. btw, i won the tahan competition lolz.my mei complaining how hard huanledecaoyuan is. no one said its easy rite. even andrew and i cant play it properly, but thats cuz our shengs suck. lolz!

      mega concert has already come to a close. the opening fanfare by lim kiong pin- harmony- by sim boon yew, movement- by quek ling kiong, expressions- by sim boon yew, precision- by yeo puay hian, synergy- by ho chee kong, our people, our music- phoon yew tien. ah well. it was rather tiring performing there. i got to know some ppl from pasir ris. (den i realised they got gold last yr for syf!?) and den er, i found out that they really started off as a ruan ensemble (wdf!?) ah well im gona skip open house todae cuz im lyk really really sick and coming down wif a flu. and im not gona lead parents ard wif a flu man. no wayz. i'll juz have to sorry ms tang and get some mc. arr.during standby time andrew and i were lyk sitting together recallin the good times. in sec2 he came in and took 2 mths to learn the "Thirty-Six Reeds" (directly translated from san shi liu huang). and as he progressed my attendance regressed =D but thats another matter altogether.. and lin yundi bullied him.. and how i taught him how to wash the pipe... and in my sec3 i had to practise very hard over 2 weeks for the upcoming concert, how lin yundi finally gave me a chance to perform... and about how we got silver for syf.. sigh, the good old times.. and then in 2004 (the more recent ones)- when our relationship really got veh close- lyk almost brothers liao.. and den how i waited and waited for my sheng in dewan sri pinang, 18 march 2004... and how i screamed in delight when i finally got it... how my chuiguan was held together by chopsticks, wood, ice cream sticks and scotch tape... on 24/4.. how we played all those songs together.. how the both of us played fei tian when we werent supposed to (after discussing what wld lao zhou do if he found us onstage beforehand). ah well it was so fun...i was so sad when lyk mega concert ended.. its lyk, the last time im performing together wif you for a long time...that was the farewell to most of those ppls... in the end andrew and mi sorta lyk briefly hug each other gdbyez... farewells are lyk, so sad!! ): cant stand it. im lyk not the type who can really control mi tears lor.. sigh. what a weakling i am. sigh, till then, andrew. (see, im lyk alr so sad now :( sigh..)sigh. perhaps i shall drown my sorrows in the flooding torrents of huang he... im lyk alr in no mood to blog. its lyk so.. er.. yar. im sure some can understand how im feelin now..

      hahz. my work on huang he is coming under way. im attempting to polish up my huang he lor, wif all those notes i keep on missing, i hate running notes, i hate parallel thirds. Lolz. i nva liked parallel thirds at all lar. Its dem spastic, the parallel thirds, they only piss ppl off and do nothing elz. I carn play parallel thirds for nuts I hate it. (as in, on one hand lar) sigh. Sux0rz. But I reli wana have a dae where I can acherli plae huang he so well lorz… one day, I shall perform huang he… and den I will have lyk.. erm, a raving review =). He plays with excellent flair and unsurpassed technique.. his cadenzas are brilliant and sparkling and inspiring, and his playing is lyrical, he ends off brilliantly, the first movement, with the much desired gusto. His cantabile is warm and rich in tone in the 2nd movement, valiant and bold in the large chords. In the third movement he captures the melody very well. His patetico and agitato was breathtaking and his arpeggios were brilliant and fitted in with the passionate con fuoco at the end… for the fourth movement he plays with excellent power, and his octaves are solid and sure- comparable to that of martha argerich’s. And den im gona have standing ovation, multiple bravos and curtain calls? (I wish man).. and how many bouquets of flowers im gona receive? None?- I hope not man. That wld reli suck. Hehz. I really wonder who the blardi impersonator is. When I catch him im gona mince him up. aniwae pause here lar.

      euw.  for those who really wanna see the nittygritties of my piano's bad shape, here are some of them. for those who are too lazy to visit  urlLink http://burobbipiano1.mypicgallery.com/  to see the full range of pictures.. there are some samples below.  First.   My C2 string broke, and the hammer gets wedged in between the B2 and C#1 strings everytime I play the note. i either have to hit B2 or C#1 string a number of times before the hammer dislodges itself, or i have to release the hammer manually.  Secondly,   As you can see, the A3, C#5, Bb5, A6, B6, C7, C#7 hammers all do not return properly. the C7 is the worst of them all, if you can see, I have attached an extra weight to the hammer to make it return more properly. The C7 and C#7 really are the most annoying of the lot. B7 and C8 are super sticky but still return.  Thirdly,   Very obvious what this is. My F5 and F#5 have gone case. The technician just pulled out the hammer like that. Of course he added to the damage, because, before that I still could play those keys properly; they didn't go out. but after he meddled with it it got worse. Now periodically it goes out. Especially if it gets deflected by my hammering of the strings =_+ (bruised eye)  Fourth,   Hmmz. Look at this. An example of attrition (geography! weathering on a small scale..). Felt deposits have been found on all 88 keys of my piano. The felt came not from the part that hits the string, but from the lever system! Howz about that.  These are just 4 samples, you have other pictures showing my C2 key getting jammed and sunken in, as well as the remnants of my C2 string on the tuning peg. ah well. i suppose its time for me to get down to work =_="

      to 0wnz the octaves, there are a variety of methods. according to which kinds of octaves, you will need different kinds of training.  types of octaves you may want to consider 0wnzing:   Beethoven octaves: Somewhat legato, bouncing. Fingering, ironically is 15 throughout. (example: sonata no. 21 in C "waldstein" - movt 3: allegretto-presto)  Chopin octaves: Legato, with hold-on notes in between, fingering is generally 15 and 14, although as in the case with chromatic scales, there may be 13 fingering. (example given: étude in b minor, op. 25 no. 11, etude in Gb major "butterfly", op. 25 no. 9)  Lisztian octaves: Bravura and fortissimo. Octave scales and patterns. will 0wnz you if not careful. (example given: sonata in b minor)  Rachmaninov octaves: Non legato, detached, bravura. fingering is 15 throughout. (example given: ending to rachmaninov's piano concerto no. 3 in d minor [movt. 3 - alla breve])  Tchaikovsky octaves:  either  big chords jumping the compass of the keyboard  or  legato in small groups, fingering stands at 14 and 15  or  alternating hands, fingering 15 throughout. (example given: tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto in b b  minor)  Yellow River octaves: crazy octaves, generally jumping all over the place. (example given: all 4 movements of the yellow river piano concerto)  to ownz them respectively:   practice bouncing octaves on the keyboard. (grand pianos work wonders somehow) (according to sutini goh) slowly you will get it. but till date i havent practised much and i havent got my octaves well done.  good job. you simply have to lengthen your fingers until they can play it. you either can or cannot. there is no in between. if you can: well done. if you cannot: go home.  lift weights everyday. Practise all sorts of octave techniques like bouncing, running octaves etc. better if practice on a heavy piano and plays on a light piano.  ppmp- practice, practice and more practice. not much more i can suggest =_="  you must do 100 IPU's or 40 PU's. Next, you must lift weights. After that, you must take up 2 years of bodybuilding =_=" (unless you're female AND/OR have the abilities of martha argerich). you must practise very hard, as is the case with 1, 3 and 4. finally, one day you may discover that you make the mark (-:  As an addition to 5: practice dohnányi, czerny and hanon like hell.  simply practice. feel energetic. if you feel lethargic there is no point in playing yellow river because it drains you of your energy. if you are lethargic have a sugar rush, then start playing. it will work well. personally i play yellow river better if i have the energy.  ah well. so much for 0wnzing octaves. my octaves are coming along quite well. im very happy to say tt i played octaves very well today. although i have not broken any strings, the hammers are looser than ever. my F5 and F#5 hammer are virtually gone case. ah wellx.  good job. i wish all who wish to 0wnz octaves the best of luck.  Advertisement:   Use the HCD Method!    THE HCD METHOD - PROVEN!   HCD - Hanon, Czerny and Dohnányi The HCD method has been proven effective to all who wish to master octaves. By practising Hanon, your octaves become solid and polished (although side effect (as diagnosed by thomas ang) may include becoming gay like hanon himself). By practising Czerny your octaves will be bravura but your side effect may be losing your life (you may need to get one back later on). Dohnányi is the ultimate. By practising dohnanyi you may become crazy but you will pwnz all.   =) haha finished crapping. gtg lunch =P

      oh man. my room is,  horrid.  theres no other word for it. apparently termites have eaten up my cupboards and floor. =_=" and my mum sprayed insecticide and now it smells of piped gas (lyk, u noe, when you turn on the gas tap in your sci labs in sch?) oh man it stinkx. its supposed to be odourless. but as they say "effect on non-target organisms is unknown" i tink its fair they have a slight smell so tt at least you know its there, and not that you die of insecticide. wowz. (tt has gotta b potent) and damn it, the one of the XO bottles behind my table was leaking. why? the termites ate up the cork. blardi hell. but the consolation was tt: you nva drank it and will probably not drink it anyway, so you dint really lyk lose alot of $... =D how $) my family members are.  sigh. luks lyk my dreams of getting grand piano dis yr is dashed.  man, that sucks. arh well, nvmz. o yar i juz rmbed, cousin cherie also got piano at home, she dont plae piano lolx. its lyk there stoning too =D arh nvmz lar, that one young chang. sounds quite okay for an upright. BUT I WANT A GRAND. do you understand?  no one understands. no one. huang he is not a vision anymore. it has progressed; it is not even merely a dream, it is almost becoming an obsession. a dangerous one. one that could take charge of my life. i have absolutely no idea when im going to play it.. i have no idea how i am going to play it. all i know that is i have a duty to practise it now, for when that day comes, i will be prepared and i will face the challenges easily.  "when you work hard, the results are easy. when you work easy, the results are hard." - Charles W. Cosby  makes some sense, huh?  lol ri boys if you find it familiar, check your mathematics activity worksheets =D TCM and mustafa ali gives all these funky quotes =P  ah well hmv sucks, actually. their murray perahia etudes is severely overpriced, S$28.50!? oh manz. and they dont have stock of huang he. at least tower records "ran out of stock". man. the last time sum1 bought huang he was in 2001? r0x0rz. arh nvm. sigh. i wonder if shihui knows this is the blog im writing into now... =P or is she still at freewebs.com/burobbi?  lolx. nvm lar, not tt i haf to bother much about, anyway. okay, i tink i shall stop here. -wonders what kind of dinner buro is gona haf-  PS:   join    urlLink   http://burobbi.proboards33.com/    =) my new forum!! lalala~ anyone can join!! join and start talking rubbish!! =D =D =D

      take care of your index finger. it, surprisingly, is one of the most fragile fingers.  through my playing of huang he, i have theorized that the thumb is the most resistant finger, but of course. the index, in fact, is the most susceptible to damage. for a long period of time, the fingernails of my index finger has chipped because i kept on whacking the piano. one will not care to fathom why my string broke when he sees me play the piano. when i play huang he's 4th movement, i bang as though the piano were something of equivalence to H, and my fingers were cast iron hammers. and the cadenzas and the ending of the 1st movement is also crazy banging. well i can do it, im heavy enough. well, my whacking is apparently a tad too heavy for the piano. everything's coming apart now.  well, i alr got my uncle to agree to swop pianos. well, its not my uncle's anyway, its my late cousin's piano. -sigh- dun ask how she died, it was a car accident in melbourne and it hit the headlines, i dont wish to go on any further. she was the only other person within my extended family who had a musical background... ah well. and she had an upright grand.  the thing im acherli most scared of is tt i lyk kill off her piano. im sure she'd be really upset... it was her treasure, though im not sure if it received maintenance at my uncle's place. i need something of equivalence to a grand piano. the sound board, i dont want too deep a sound, i want clarity and a slightly shallower tone. if its too deep everything becomes muddled and my pedalling will be really tiresome...    "...and the wrath of the yellow river reaches a peak; its waters gushes with a surge of unparalleled agitation and passion, it heaves a final sigh, and the movement comes to a close..."  ah wellz. den in tt case i haf no idea when my new piano will come. after i break my cousin's piano? oh man. -sigh-  meimei is going to malaysia. bon voyage, hope she dont lose my scores again ^^ veh tiring to write them out =_=" maybe i shld teach her how to read xianpu den i wun haf to transcribe animorez~ lalala.. im so lazy =D  harharx.

      the yellow river is the cradle of our chinese civilisation, it has thousands of years of history. generation after generation boatmen have braved the storms and ravages of the yellow river. poets have sung a common ode to the yellow river, praising it for what it is; the yellow river has seen torrents of water gushing down the channel, a rushing, flowing melody filled with a flaming passion fueled by the ravaging waters... and yet the chinese civilisation must protect the yellow river and safeguard it from the damn invaders, for without the yellow river the better part of chinese culture, chinese civilisation and chinese roots will be gone.  seems like listening to the yellow river has really made me something lyk a chinese communist, or sth along those lines. here are the wonderful lyrics of the yellow river boatmen's song (黄河船夫曲). for those who dunnoe this is taken from the yellow river cantata by xian xinghai.      《黄河大合唱第一乐章---黄河船夫曲》 --- 冼星海

      man.  id simply love to haf a boesendorfer imperial concert grand (at home lar) its impossible though. maybe im wishing upon the wrong thing. its really. er, wow.. if i can fit a grand piano. a conservatory size one, yes, but other than that, not really, esp since my corridor is chao narrow... and yeah.. (okay, after surveying it for a while i finally figured out how to manoeuvre the piano in and out of the corridor into the room. den i found that there was a fixture there that wld probably block the thingey. okay that pisses me off. ar. but i tink if a grand piano isnt lyk too thick, it shldnt have any problem getting in.  am i tinking too much? am i wanting too much?  im so worried i will start destroying my future pianos with this barbaric playing.. if i ever get a new piano tt is. i can be guaranteed at least a new upright/silent/grand OR my late cousin's upright grand. im juz wonderin how can an upright grand exist? if its an upright grand its an upright, not a grand. grands are different from uprights because grands have a more quick response to a touch, and can play a roll on a note easier than if it were an upright, and the hammer is immediately returned, unlike the upright, where the hammer takes a longer time to return... and of course the grand has a larger soundboard. considering the Boesendorfer 290- it has 9 extra keys.. 168cm wide (fortunately im taller than this piano is wide :D) budden its super long lor.. 9'6"!? = 290cm!? thats chao long. 570 kg! means at each wheel theres 190kg at each wheel =) not bad. 1255 pounds. wowz. thats lyk 104.5 of my bowlin balls =) whee~  but im definitely gonna have to train for my atcl/certGsm/dipAbrsm/glcm whatnot. i muz get at least ltcl/lgsm/lrsm/llcm... by say, 25? i wanna get my fellowship soon.. fellowship is lyk so prestigious :D but will nid alot of trg. its the sort of thing hardcore pianists wanna do. but imagine if i plae huang he with only grade 8 merit. what will ppl tink of mi :p what im a despo whos waiting to show off sth i carn even plae? wad crap. ar wellz.  dipAbrsm is actually quite good lar, but you have to lyk choose from the list of repertoire, and not that i really lyk the repertoire.. but its worth considering though. ah wellz.  i dunnoe. perhaps, someday, then.  till then.

      everything is pissing mi off todae. why?  as if im not vexed enough. i cant stand it when ppl make sport of mi. it seems lyk everything in this world is against mi. EVEN MY FRENZ. okay, then i shldnt call them friends. like i had those reli true friends in the first place. okay, maybe that few, three or four real frenz. i really feel hopeless and disgusted wif myself. why haf i landed myself in this sticky mess? why haf i implicated my friends into this shit ive landed myself in? why is everything i own rubbish? why is my lyf so screwed up? sometimes i carn fathom why im here. why im living here. right here in this junkyard. im tired, i dont wanna pick up the pieces.  no sir, no, im not picking up the pieces. punish me if you must, then, if you see the purpose in punishing me. if you take joy in punishing me. if i even deserve to be punished at all.  how i hate you. you are the culmination of my misery and shortcomings, the epitome of anger and hatred... go away and bother someone else. not me, please, no.  someone else take the rap for me?  no?  never mind...  when the mind is driven into desperation it is capable of thoughts never before; these thoughts can drive the body to do things never done before, in this state of semiconsciousness, with this numbing effect like that of a drunken stupor... one will not remember what he has done, where he has been, why he was there, there will only be this time lapse through which many things happened, not one will be known to the mind. the force of the mind is very powerful, yes i know that. i jolly well know that. no one can deny it. the force of the mind is simply the reason why many great things were achieved. mahler's nine symphonies, the epitome of symphonic writing, was not achieved by accident.  "to go down into posterity, i must write great things."  - gustav mahler.  i believe in the force of the mind. it will drive me to do great things.  what, i dont know.  when, i dont know.  it simply happens, and when it does i'll know. yeah.

      no way man.  no way am i gonna pay 1000 bucks to get my stupid piano repaired. if it costs that much... i'd rather have my piano status quo. my mum actually paid that idiot 57 bucks to come down to assess the piano's problems. his assessment? not worth saving the piano. saving the money wld be better? i could have come up with that assessment myself. though i must congratulate that person on assessing that my playing of huang he would have led to the loosening of the piano hammers, the breaking of both my C2 strings, the stickiness of Bb4, F3, C#7, C7, B7, C8. and the erosion of the felt. after all i havent serviced it all these 7 years, 10 months and 22 days. im gonna keep it at 8 years, after that im gonna sell it in for a thousand bux (yes, the repairs cost as much as the piano is worth!?) man. that completely sucks, ya noe. i wldnt have paid that much to save my piano even if its worth a whole childhood of memories to me. to me, that "first class handmade asahi upright" is only a second piano. there are so many other models. of course, the man also correctly assessed that if i buy a grand piano, i cant play at night simply because its too loud. thats a completely correct assessment and i believe that too. on the other hand i doubt im ever going to purchase a bösendorfer imperial concert grand within the next, what? 15 years? no sir, no. it costs 95k, a used one, and 161 to 185k, a brand new one, yah. thats lyk so expensive. i heard some guy ate taco bell and drove a tinpot car to save up for a boesendorfer. man. i admire that guy. i may hafta follow in his footsteps. i dont even know whether a boesendorfer imperial concert grand (model 290!) exists in singapore. i know the model 225, which goes down to F, exists, and is in quite a good condition in the auditorium of nanyang high girl's school. which is quite an odd place to be, because i doubt anyone there would ever play those notes. model 225 is actually quite sufficient for my purpose, cuz i wanna plae the low G instead of the low C, in the opening of baoweihuanghe. ah wellz.  i realised that opening up the piano would actually make it sound alot like a grand because its lyk so loud when you open the front and then you lyk face it its gonna be super loud and youre really gonna lyk the sound. of course, all the mistakes and all the imperfections of the piano and your playing will inevitably be magnified. but its really inspirational. i played baoweihuanghe the first part, the animoso, it was brilliant. man i love it. on a broken down asahi upright? (oh btw wcw was telling me about the worst piano he'd ever played on- the one in the string ensemble room in TCHS- all out of tune and the Eb4 was sunken in because part of the key broke off) sighz. i really hope to play it on a boesendorfer 225, if i cant play on a 290. 290 is really ridiculous come to think of it. if i really can get my hands on one, good luck to me man. sigh. 225 is actually good enough, a half concert grand. but if i wanna plae at a concert i want a concert grand =D and that means model 290! one can see the boesendorfer 290  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  or the boesendorfer 225  urlLink here  or  urlLink here  ah well. its really er. w0w. man i'd love to have a boesendorfer.  orh gawd. i got big plans for dis holiday. im gona either get a silent piano or a grand piano. grand piano is good. grand piano is the only thing i can survive on. im gonna soon bang as hard as liszt liaoz. not many ppl can bang as hard as liszt. i need to constantly train and lift wts ^^ and im gonna be able to whack the piano silly, just like liszt did.  Quote boesendorfer.com   It is the only concert grand in the world to have nine sub-bass notes, down to bottom C, giving it a full eight octave compass keyboard. These extra notes enable some compositions to be accurately performed, which were originally scored with lower notes, by composers such as Bartók, Debussy, Ravel and Busoni. Special construction features have a very positive influence on the overtones produced when the piano is played, and helps to create the maximum range of both power and volume, and allows the smallest subtle variations in sound to be heard, across the whole range of the piano.   Quote boesendorfer.uk.com   The incomparable Bosendorfer Imperial Concert Grand is arguably the finest piano available anywhere today. Acclaimed by the World’s top artists, it is a joy to hear and play.The Bosendorfer Imperial has one of the largest sound boards of any concert instrument, being some 30% larger than most typical recital pianos. This helps to produce the immense dynamic range for which the piano is famous. No matter how loudly it is played, it responds without loss of sound quality, and there are always great reserves.   man, i'd love to play on a boesendorfer. its heaven on earth.. jeez. my dream piano... a piano company with a history of 176 years (since 1828!)... long history yar! probably by the time i can buy the piano it will be celebrating 200 years of history... man. a long way to go. arr... if i ever get my hands on one i willl.. die happy X)  ah well i tink thats sufficient blogging for now =) will blog l8r perhaps if i got the time =P

       wahahax cant stand them big bad octaves. they appear everywhere.  big bad octaves.  naughty naughty.  they appear in all sorts of places. they appear in solo pieces, they appear in piano concertoes, they appear in piano sonatas, they appear in nocturnes, they appear as a commodity. they occur in pedagogical works like "get a lyfe" czerny, "what the hell" dohnányi, and even hanon, which thomas ang quite simply sums up (accurately, too!) as "gay". who the hell will train running octaves on a day-to-day basis? not many. these big bad octaves require you to stretch your fingers to the correct length. for those scrawny people, stretching your hand quite fully will enable you to play an octave (C to C) or perhaps C to D. but there you have it, your octave. for big handed shits like mi i haf to position my hand for an octave as i can easily play C-D. and jumping octaves are really crap. argh i hate octaves. shld have sth lyk can press one note and play octaves one =D that'd be so kewL, lyk the black keys on a zhongyin sheng you noe. hhax. anwz lyk hmmz. my octaves are improving i tink. i can play most of the octave passages very well. but still my hand will get lyk super tired from playing 保卫黄河 but its completely worth the effort. AND it gives me that thrill, that rush of adrenaline, you know. the sense of satisfaction playing huang he. all the octaves. quaver triplet octaves at minim=84!? thats nuts. (quote some website, nuckin futs, but thats quite rude, so..) ah well. octaves are veh fun to plae =D its even more fun when ppl praise you for them and admire the amount of time you took to learn and master them. of course if you want to be an octave playing shit like argerich you can lar, if not you can also lie to those ppl and say its "innate".  i found myself making plans to redo my entire home after o lvls. gona try and get my parents to move my comp and whatnot into the small rm. much better rm =D veh nice rm to stay in man i love that rm. imagine if i cld have my piano in there. talkin abt piano i hope my piano can get fixed. veh pissed abt the breaking of the string manz. two strings from the same note. argh nothin can get more pissin than that. and the assessment of the damage costs 57 bucks when tuning only costs 52!? i haf this feelin theyre extortin me. im gona make sure that they assess everything im gona make sure they assess every damn problem with my piano and im gona try to make it feel lyk its a grand piano. im gona open up the lid and everything. and im gonna bang on the piano lyk no one's business man that r0cks. ah wellz.   owing ppls:  wellx i still owe shuting her bdae prezzie hope shes not too pissed wif mi. alot of wcw's stuff including huang he orchestral score and some cd's.. whoops.   due to collect:  scores from tzw and p156-junior (z.c.).   feeling:  depressed and dejected. ah well i suppose meimei can understand how im feeling now.. sigh.  not feeling veh happy now, even tho im supposedly listening to this happy song called 北京喜讯传边寨 yeah its nice and it has a very wonderful gaosheng part (listen to it its obv a zhao hong liang sheng) still im feelin veh dejected. lyk growin up has all this nasty implications that you really dont like, but have to admit it, we hafta face it. quote hagrid  "what will come will come, and we will have to meet it when it does."  ah wellz. well said. man i lyk that quote. i believe everyone will simply get his just deserts and rewards as he is deserving. for those impostors god bless them if they still say they have a clear conscience. god bless them, too, if they have a guilty conscience and are willing to stop it. sigh.  arh well, maybe i shall stop bloggin here for tonite, im so shag abit pissed wif myself i was listenin to music until past midnite last nite. i shall make it a pt to sleep by 1130 todae. ah wellz. 2226.

      sigh. listening to rachmaninov's 3rd now. feelin sianz. acherli i was supposed to go bowling wif timwee. okay, not go bowling wif him. but go bowling then purposely meet him at the alley.. which is quite spastic. acherli i wanted to check wif him whether he cld make it lorz. den he din answer de fone until i called from the alley den he said he was at home cuz he had a fever. how really pissing off. that was really uncalled for, i have to say. sigh. in the end i bowl myself lor i felt so sian while bowling. no energy to bowl. to cap it all i havent bowled for 2 wks, .'. my bowling skills will haf sucked and will haf regressed. .'. i will have a really really lousy score. well, not quite i managed to bowl 2 130's and a 140 although i played rubbish in between and ended up 70s 70s 80s. lol. see the diff? 60 pts apart when i play properly from when i play rubbish. but still, before that i used to have practically no problem getting 100 pts its lyk so easy? i can take 100 pts for granted, in fact, even 115 pts for granted also no problem, on good days i can even do up to (wth!?) 120 no problem. my avg will b lyk 140+ or 150+ and thats lyk pwnz all =D but ah wellZ. nvm. i was so pissed off, okay lar, not reali pissed, cuz i can forgive tim =) he got fever mahz. must rest at home. anwz i sms my mei saying i was depressed den l8r she ask "kor! are you okay?" den i was lyk relac, i hafnt died yet =D. kor is still alive~ lolz. hhaz happy ending? perhaps.still alot of things are weighing on my mind. the troubles wif growing up. sometimes i really feel growing up is a burden. so many things happen to you when you grow up. its really a trouble. i cant stand it. i hate growing up. on the other hand, you carn expect me to remain a child all my lyf rite? sigh. as you grow up you know more and more things. some things turn out the way you want it, others dont. and some facts turn out the way you would have hoped it to be, some dont; they are ugly facts that you have to concede to much as you dont like it. you will get to know more ppl. as you befriend one person the next day, you will grow distant from a few others. you start to have opinions about things, others start to have opinions of you. the world is ridden with suspicion. just that you dont feel it at first, you start to feel it when you get older. sigh. and of course, when those youve grown close to are about to leave you, it pains your heart. seems like sth somewhere has been detached from you. of course, i have been entrusted by some not to say certain things, you will forgive me if i have to oblige by their wishes.on the other hand, there are some things that are simply fated in lyf. as they say, tian xia wu bu san zhi yan xi. sigh. how i wish that wld nva b true. sigh. it pains mi to part wif ppl ive grown so close to. say, andrew for example. yar lar i can still visit him during practise. but reli lar, means i will have alot less fun times. i carn count the number of jokes we cracked lolz~ all dose sick jokes lolx~ dem farniez. hez been a gr8 fren. ah wellz.and so ends another day- im reli wonderin whether i shld base my webbie at blogger instead. at least blogger is more reliable when it comes to protecting data and publishing parts of the blog. freewebs told me its impossible to recover the data what the hell. im pissed with them. if i were running a company id haf made millions of dollars of losses abish. nvmz. ah well. maybe i shld also consider changing my blog layout. ive used this blog layout for eons! since last year i tink, cuz i went on a super long hiatus wif nothing written in between nth has changed here lorz. im still lyk using this blog layout. louis alr change his. sigh his is veh nice. but so typical of a blog. hhaz. (isnt tt the pt) nvm. suggestions for new layout? pls tell mi! =D i need suggestions for a new design and layout =Pand oh. er, i wont be makin the changes until after o lvls lolz. when i haf all the time in the world. hope my piano gets fixed soon, cant stand a broken key. im alr starting to play my octaves not bad. need to train still. i will train czerny dohnanyi (if i can find scores) and hanon. quote thomas ang "hanon is gay" =D its quite obvious. lol. the 60 excercises for the virtuoso pianist: pwnZ all. yeah man.
