       Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror   Mahmood Mamdani  Pantheon (a division of Random House) (ISBN 0-375-42285-4)  $24.00   Wow.&nbsp; There are a lot of things I didn't know about Vietnam and the Cold War, about things going on in the world and Reagan's rollback the communists strategy...i am amazed.&nbsp; There are some things I knew (CIA training of the mujahideen & the Taliban in Afghanistan), there are things I have sorta heard of (drug trafficking funding wars around the world) but didn't know the extent of till I have read this book.&nbsp;   After reading it, I wanted to scream.&nbsp; I couldn't believe I was living in a country where people in the government would do such injustice out of their own self-interest.&nbsp; It makes me want to change the world even more.&nbsp; It makes me more serious into possibly doing grad work in middle eastern/islamic studies.&nbsp; (if i can get myself even more motivated and getting over the fear of so much work and reading to earn that degree)   Some things learned from reading this book:     the terms "good" and "bad" muslims are political rather than religious designations.&nbsp;   Between Vietnam & the Invasion of Iraq, the US were fighting wars against communists by proxy.  Remember in the movie  The Gods Must Be Crazy 2  that there was a Cuban fighting against the African?&nbsp; Example of a proxy war (the Cubans were sent to fight the US-supported fighters in Angola).  The "veterans" of the fighting in Afghanistan usually came back to fight in their homeland: i.e. in Algeria, the civil war fighting that was very bloody were between the government and the veterans of Afghanistan.  These veterans were trained by the CIA.   and so on and so on.&nbsp; It's truely amazing.  I do recommend it to anyone who wants to see another view of what happened during the cold war and the rise of people of al-Qaida.

       Islam Under Seige  Akbar S. Ahmed Polity (ISBN 0-7456-2210-0) $19.95  This is an anthropologist's and muslim's explanation of what is happening in the Islamic world today.&nbsp; His main emphasis is that we are living in a post-honor world and that there are two practices of islam, inclusive islam - which stresses tolerance and dialogues between religions - and exclusive islam - the opposite.  It is very informative and inspiring, when someone is looking for the good of what Islam can offer.&nbsp; It calls for an understanding of Islam as a whole.&nbsp; It refutes the claims of islamophobic scholars such as Bernard Lewis & Samuel Hutchinson (you might as well call him xenophobic).  I recommend this book for all those trying to understand what is going on in the world today.

      Ok, I am anxiously awaiting for the arrival of the 9/11 report at the book shop I work at, but we haven't received it yet.&nbsp; Hopefully we will get it tomorrow, because I want to start on it right away.  I want to see what it says and see how well it goes against what I am familiar with in the realm of Middle Eastern/Islamic studies.&nbsp;  Sure, I could print it out online or read the pdf, but that could kill my eyes, and I want to make notes.    Where is it??

       She Had Some Horses  by Joy Harjo  Thunder Mouth's Press (ISBN 1-56025-119-0)  Poetry   I've read this several years ago.&nbsp; I was turned on to Joy Harjo by purchasing her band's (Joy Harjo & Poetic Justice) CD, during a period when I was into music by Native Americans.&nbsp; Only after did I realize she was a poet and had several books published (her poems were turned into song on the CD).&nbsp; So I bought them all that was available, and this is just one of them.   Her poetry is based on being a woman and Native American (of the Muscogee "Creek" tribe). It is really beautiful, powerful, moving stuff.&nbsp; Some of my favorite lines...    ...know that our dreams don't end here...  ("Anchorage)    &nbsp;      Everyone laughed at the impossiblity of it,    but also the truth.&nbsp; Because who would believe    the fantastic and terrible story&nbsp;of all our survival    those who were never meant    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to survive?

      Hi,   Well, if I had a brain I would have brought the next book I was going to review,  Islam Under Siege  by Akbar S. Ahmed or  Good Muslim, Bad Muslim : America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror  by Mahmood Mamdani to review, but of course I left them at home.&nbsp; These are very interesting and informative books and hope to spead the word about them.   I did bring a book I could review, so I will create a new post for it.

       Land That Moves, Land That Stands Still   Kent Nelson  Viking Penguin (ISBN 0-670-03226-3)  Retail Value: $24.95 hardcover (paperback upcoming on July 27)  &nbsp;  Ok, I picked up this book because the cover seemed very interesting & the plot summary on the inside cover perked my ears up.&nbsp; I am interested in the setting and was hoping it becames part of the characterization of the book.  &nbsp;  Plot summary: The husband of Mattie Remmel died in an farming accident on their alfalfa ranch in South Dakota, leaving Mattie and her daughter, Shelley, to work the ranch themselves. A hired hand, Dawn, and a runaway native boy, Elton, comes on to help the family.&nbsp; Things happen; a secret about Mattie's husband revealed, Dawn's ex comes back to haunt her, Elton runs away again.&nbsp; In the end everything works out.  &nbsp;  My reactions: I am glad I didn't pay full price for this book (got it used).&nbsp; I had to keep reading because I wanted to know what happened in the end, but that was the only reason I kept reading.&nbsp; To me, it seemed like the author was writing this book to let the ladies know that there are good guys out there, and bad ones too.&nbsp; It was like a smushy Robert Redford movie or something.&nbsp; I mean, even the author looks like Robert Redford.&nbsp; I was not confortable with what I want to call soft porn.&nbsp; Yes, I am liberal, but&nbsp;I really don't want to read about this stuff. The dialogues had no real significance to the story and seem to be very jumpy and unrealistic.&nbsp; Time jumps rather quickly and it is hard to follow.&nbsp; I don't think he's a very good writer, in my opinion.  &nbsp;  My moral of the story: Never buy a book written by a guy who looks like Robert Redford.

      Yes, only a week left before classes start again, even though it has very little direct impact on me.  I only take classes part time and work full time.  But the town is getting crowded again, students and parents coming back, traffic is getting worse, idiots re-emerge from their hibernation.  The ability of trying to cross the street safely that the summer offers us has now come to the end, till winter break.  One more week of free time reading.  Next week will be hell on earth.  I don't want it to come.  The summer came and went so quickly, and I got stuck working weekends, so I didn't have a lot of time going outdoors like I want to.  Oh well,  maybe next summer.  I better enjoy the week left while it's here.

       urlLink Writer Asra Nomani faces ban from the mosqued founded by her father for protesting unequal treatment of women. -- Beliefnet.com   I also heard about this on NPR's Morning Edition.  I hope this family and others like them prevail.  I had a similar reaction at the local mosque.  I was infuriated.  Equality is a part of Islam.  Implement it.

      As'ad AbuKhalil  The Battle for Saudi Arabia: Royalty, Fundamentalism, and Global Power  Seven Stories Press ISBN 1-58322-610-9 $9.95  I am still in the middle of reading this book. He is still a bit to the left (or possibly Arab nationalistic) for my tastes but that is his perogative, I have no right to say he is right or wrong. He does provide with more information about the Saudi regime then we could ever hope to get out of a Michael Moore film. Anyways here are some things I have come across so far....  Man, the Saudi Royal Family should be more careful about choosing names for sons. There are 3 Saud's who were kings at different times in history (plus the patriarch Saud who was not king but was influential at the beginning), 2 Abd al Aziz, 2 Faysal. It is all very confusing. The weird thing was that King Faysal (ruled 1964-75) was assassinated by Prince Faysal (p. 104). This is enough to give people headaches for a long time.  Ok, to something more serious, just ponder on this passage.....[Italics are my own for emphasis]   ...The United States were pleased with those developments and did not seem to mind the militant ideology and rhetoric of King Faysal.  The United States, as will be seen later, was on the side of Islamic fundamentalism in the holy war against communism and Arab nationalism. At the time, Faysal spoke the same militant Islamic languages spoken today by Bin Ladin . In a speech he gave in 1969, he stated that "it is a call for jihad for God, for our religion and doctrine, in the defense of our holy places and sanctuaries. And I ask god to will for me death, as a martyr for God." But he also, in line with other fanatical fundamentalists, did not miss an opportunity to attack the left: "We have to struggle outselves to purify [ourselves] from the tumors, and from the corrupt doctrines, and destructive currents." That latter phrase was always a euphemism for leftism.      it is a bit shameful how much we do not know about world affairs and our own foreign policy.  I always though of us Americans as caring and understanding people, but I suppose it is not like that in areas of power.

      Hi/Salaam  So, now that I am Muslim (as probabaly indicated on my last posting), I am having difficulties because I am a rather political, liberal, highly involved American.  Which it seems most online places for Muslims tend NOT to be.  But I did find some that should be good, and I wanted to spread the news around.   urlLink http://muslimwakeup.com/  is one such place online. It has a meet-up sight, so if you live in a place that has a high population of progressive muslims, you can meet each other (in Indiana there are not many progressive people period.)   urlLink http://www.altmuslim.com/  is billed as the muslim news source.  Again progressive.   urlLink http://www.theamericanmuslim.org/  are the American Muslims (i.e., progressive i suppose).  Ok, slightly off the subject (not dealing with Islam really).  I am currently reading this book called "The Battle for Saudi Arabia: Royalty, Fundamentalism, &amp; Global Power" by As'ad AbuKhalil. It's a very interesting book, slightly too far to the left for me (it is published by Seven Stories Press in the Open Media series), but it is full of interesting information about the rise of the Saudi family and Wahabiyyah Islam. The author has a blog at  urlLink http://angryarab.blogspot.com . It's called the Angry Arab New Service (A source on politics, war, the Middle East, Arabic poetry, and Chicken McNuggets).

      Hi,  I am writing this out of frustration. I thought I would go visit some islamic chatrooms because I want bored and wanted to talk to other Muslims. I wanted to scream.  Chatrooms bring out the worse of people. Or they attract not-so-good people. I don't know, but going to chatrooms is not a great experience.  It's like all the self-proclaim, self-righteous, i-am-better-than-thou co-religionists all congregate onto these chatrooms.  Ok, there are three things about me: 1) I am Muslim. I bear witness that there is no God by God, and Muhammad is his Messenger. 2) I am American, born and raised with the good ethics that most Americans should have. 3) Politically I'm liberal (I voted for Nader in 2000 and will vote for Kerry in 2004). I believe liberalism is the only way to acheive true equality in this country for everyone.  All these three identities together are an integral part of who I am. Separating these three identities would destroy who I am and can potentially turn me into a monster I wish not to be. These three identities together are VERY important to me.  But this isn't good enough for some. It seems that identity is only a one-way street, though they fail to realize who much of their identity is meshed with their cultural origins as well as Islam.  You know, it seems to me that being an American and being proud of who I am (that doesn't mean that I support the government or some of the morality, in fact I am almost counter-culture) is a sin in these people's eyes.  It reminds me of what Ahmed S. Abkar wrote in his book,  Islam Under Seige , about two modes of thought within Islam: inclusivist thinking and excluvisit thinking.  Inclusivists is willing to make dialogues with Christians and Jews and see similarities between these three religions.  Excluvisits wants no part of the greater community.  Maybe the chatrooms are a hanging place for the exclusivists.  I had to just blow off some steam there.  What do you think?

       Chasing Vemeer  Blue Balliett Scholastic Press  Ok, it's a kid's book, but it much more than that.  It's a book for geeky kids (I was one).  One who love puzzles and asking questions that mainstream kids don't want to even think about.   What is art?  What makes an object a peice of art?   Do you see kids wearing Abercrombie & Fitch thinking about these kind of questions? Do many of us adults?  It's a good book, one that forces us to ask such questions.  I think the moral lessons learned from this book will help us adults view the world in a different light, and not take for granted that what we see is what we get. And it's a great story and puzzler for kids.  Even Picasso got quoted:  Art is a lie that tells the truth.     Oh, it's one of several fictional works floating out there that has Vermeer as a center piece:    Girl with a Pearl Earring  by Tracy Chevalier   Girl in Hyacinth Blue  by Susan Vreeland    I'm sure there are more out there.
