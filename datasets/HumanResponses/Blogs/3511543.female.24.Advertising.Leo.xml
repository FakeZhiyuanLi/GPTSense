      Taking the cue from Miss Universe contestants, maybe the trick to a good introduction is unabashed confidence and enthusiasm! *beauty pageant smile* ... And of course, world peace.

      That's one thing I learnt from advertising. The effort doesn't matter, the struggles in getting the job done mean jack and everyone's going to judge you by the results: a grotesque communication piece that's more often than not been butchered by external forces.  Took me 24 years to see this but it seems that people are getting the game early on. Cause I was just watching America's Funniest Home Videos and there was a clip of this 4-year-old was on the computer bawling "I don't wanna lose! I wanna win! I wanna always win!"  Which was terribly endearing until I realised that he might end up being a bloody good blood-sucking client some day.

      When I meet someone for the first time, I'm usually dumb-founded. Don't know what to say. Don't know how to react. What makes a good  urlLink introduction ? And what counts as one? And do I make a better impression being a {swanky occupation here} or having done {awesome achievement here}? Should I smile a lot? Or am I better off hiding my not-so-perfect teeth? Ah, the dilemma!  Do I talk current affairs? Too politically incorrect. Speak Sesame Street? Get banished to loser central. Challenge them to Pool? Hopeless at the game.  And if I'm supposed to talk about myself, where do I draw the line? Occupation? Interests? Hopeless penchant for white cotton tees? I mean, if you know everything about me, we might as well be married! No, that is NOT a proposal.  Sometimes, I try to prep myself before a meeting or party. Which would actually help if I didn't pack too much into my mind and don't know where to start. Then there are the times where I keep having to remind myself that deliberately wearing a loud, stripe jumper wouldn't give me a conversation piece.  Or maybe I should just keep quiet altogether and let the other person goof up? But then there's that really uncomfortable silence. Which feels like that game grown-ups used to get you to play to shut up. Suckers will be suckers. Thinking that it's my civic duty to fill the void, I'll open my trap and...  "Hey there. How's it going? You know, sometimes I fart in bookstores."  Oops.  ---   *Alice? Who the f*** is Alice? Certainly not me.
