      Ok. Just like the title of this blog, I just post one entry for every day that I get online.  First of all, why roninsword.blogspot.com?  ro= Ro ehl Nin= Niñ o minus the '-' above the 'n'. the 'sword' has two meanings:  Ronin's Word: stands for my opinion  Ronin Sword: stands for my weapon  Basically, it means that my opinion is my weapon, and that is all. I do not wish to be held for libel, and I do not wish to open another 'damn' chain letter in Friendster. I promise, from this day on, I will only open those posts from rico, panji, jiguli and other trusted people who post surveys (you can say if it is a chain letter)  5. Stupid chain letter which you will open because it is the spell that killed Harry's parents (wrong thing to open folks, nothing related with Harry Potter, and it will strike fear to your hearts.  Okay, enough of the stupid thing. So what basically made this day different:  4. Noli me Tangere. 15th chapter. Ahead of schedule actually  3. 4. Tanglaw Eliminations Final Round. And they thought they will be eliminated until...  2. Club Selling. I was made to speak for our club (tatak tanglaw, the club of our school paper. I am the associate managing editor for the 2nd year in the row.) and...  1. Tanglaw Meeting. We got suggestions fomr the Photo Editor of the school paper of DLSU, an alumnus of CSQC. We got lots of ideas. We hope the admin approves it.  So that wraps it up. Be careful with opening bulletin board chain letters and be happy.  The campus journalism act of 1991 was great.  P.S. Bakit webteam si Rico?

      Experience is the best teacher. What you see around you teaches many things, you just need to  watch ...  1.&nbsp;People don't mind other people's business, unless you are famous, or you are strange. 2. People only read something that interests them, and each person has different interests. 3. Concluding from the statement above, it makes  urlLink our  job more complicated, and the admin wants to put their interest which leads to... 4. Interesting for them,  BORING  for us... 5. Unless you read the editorials and look for an opiion that really rocks...  I'll continue this one later. _________________________________________- I just made this one this week. Check it out...  &nbsp; Division  In our terminal years as editors in our school paper, there are some revisions that needs to be considered regarding the quality of our school paper from the system of the organization to the paper itself:  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each member of the staff should belong to a group for them to have a definite subject to focus on. The editor concerned will lead them. e.g.: Photo Staff, News Staff, etc, etc.  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Editorial Board should be composed of skilled people in the field of writing. Tried and tested in different scenarios.  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tanglaw office should be extended to give adequate space for many people to work on. The board is composed of many students, but as of present, there is a lack of space.  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we be given necessary equipment (e.g.: camera, ream of paper, computer programs, etc.). It will be of great help to those assigned to cover special events, as it will avoid them from spending extra money for the purchase/developing of film, wasted time for bringing various computer programs to school and the like. The computer must be installed with anti-virus scans to avoid infection of the hard drive to avoid work delay.  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid speculations of favoritism, the outgoing Editorial Board members must do the process of promotion of incoming Editorial Board members. They shall nominate editors/staffers to fill in their place, with the notice of the editor/staffer concerned. The editor/staffer may decline the promotion. They shall base their decision from the performance and dedication given by each, the experience accumulated, and the responsibility and time dedicated to the organization.  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole board should be trained for the enhancement of skills. Remember: skill x training = competitive and talented student while talent – training = average student. If Claret School wants to produce competitive students, then the side of our campus journalists should never be put aside. Claret, as a private school should be able to at least have a stand in local writing competitions.  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanglaw, like any other school paper/ organization, should have their fund. The accumulated school paper fee paid in the tuition fee may be considered as the fund of the organization. Students, and their parents, may want to get their money’s worth&nbsp;.&nbsp;  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book “Campus Journalism” by Ceciliano Cruz contains useful tips as well as guidelines in the field of campus journalism. Focused on different kinds of writing, cases, scenarios which a journalist/ school paper may face. It is the reference book used by Quezon City Science High School students in their journalism elective, “The Electron” and “Ang Banyuhay” which topped and won many awards in the interschool journalism contest, considered as the battle of the school papers in their respective divisions last school year. It is recommended that we also use this book as a reference to enhance the different elements that comprise our paper.  It is now requested that these proposals may be considered. It is for the benefit of our school paper, to make a stand and be known, and to be competitive, as our alma mater wishes us to be. Given the best, we will definitely produce the best.  We hope for your kind consideration  _____________________________ Enriquito Ramon Rosales Editor in Chief (last year’s Associate Editor in Chief)  _____________________________ Robel Dabandan Managing Editor (last year’s Features Editor)  _____________________________ Roehl Niño Bautista Associate Managing Editor for two years  _____________________________ Tristan Joshua Arcinue Lay-out Editor for two years  _____________________________ Karlo Nobleza Chief Photographer for two years

        First of all, I would like you to visit blogs of my other friends who also visited this blog.    urlLink  http://bloodstainedpolearm.blogspot.com   &nbsp; ---blog of Rico and   urlLink  http://www.xanga.com/friday_cone  &nbsp; ---- EJ's blog. These are the some of the few who visit my blog, and keeps the flame alive in my journalistic acumen.     &nbsp;   So, what  did  happen today?     &nbsp;   &nbsp;As other Claretians probably did their own projects and most are probably in front of their PC's wasting another 50 pesos or so for their weekly (or rather daily) dose of Ragnarok Online, we were their at our school to serve as the eyes for our school paper. A journalist's job is never done, and so is the webteam's. So Jiggy, TJ and I were at the church, for it was the Claretian Missionaries' Day. Nobleza and EJ was not able to come. EJ had to do his AP project, and Nobleza did not arrive for an unknown reason. &nbsp;

      I already told this to JosCo (Joseph Rasco) and he told me I have a point. Here it goes…  I really envy those guys who have girl friends (note the space between). They have friends who they can share their innermost secrets. Friends whom they can ask about their crushes and maybe have a crush on one of them. I wonder how somebody got to have girl friends, how they become barkada, how they become ease with each other and hang out with each other. I on the other hand had no girl friend. Only acquaintances who know me as the brother of their former schoolmate and batch valedictorian, his brother who did not choose to go to the same school and the guy who is a huge torpe. It is in being a girl friend that one becomes a girlfriend. The long relationship as friends developed into something more intimate and special…   So the practice today was canceled, my glasses are missing, and I\m getting depressed again. Hope you like my new lay-out…

       This is an essay I just found in my journal...      ___________________________________________________________________     It is the post modern age. It is the era where life is made easier, if not more complicated. It is where people depend on technology, latest gizmos and gadgets and other things Science has to offer. When asked on what things never leave their pockets or bags whenever you go out with friends, classmates, outings, etc, most people would rank their latest cellphone models, palm tops, and MP3 players as an aid in helping them pass by time. When I’m the one asked, my journal and pen never leaves my bag and a tickler and a spare pen to place in my pocket. They would ask me why, and I have a simple answer. I’m a journalist. But wouldn’t it be interesting to know the history behind this reason?  The paper and pencil are two of the products of the progression of human civilization. To date back in history, there were illustrations found in caves, believed to be the work of pre-historic men inscribing what they see during their days. The Sumerians, titled to be the oldest civilization that existed, introduced a formal writing system called Cuneiform. The infamous Ancient Egypt decorated chambers, walls, halls and infrastructures with hieroglyphics, used to narrate about mythology, literature. They also used papyrus, utilized as early paper. The Chinese on the other hand introduced calligraphy. These were the foundation of two of the basic necessities of people of all ages. The rest is history.  As early as the pre-historic era, pre-historic men already took down notes of what happened around them. Putting the things they witnessed into illustrated media. The Bible has eyewitness accounts and stories passed on orally, written down to formalize it. Written accounts during important events that made a mark in history are read in search of more information, referring on what the writer knew, saw, and wrote. Take the Diary of Anne Frank as an example.  The pen is the bullet and the paper is the gun, it aims to shoot information to the readers. With these elements in the hands of a skilled fellow, we can expect exceptional writings from this person. As a young journalist, it is my aim to inform the readers of what I see as how I see it, or of something they knew little of.  The practicality of the trusty pen and notebook arises. Anything you’ve written is written. It is an event, thought, and talent fused to a medium. Writing down events might someday be a basis of the future generation. What happens now will be history in the future.  The center of journalism is life, divided into different branches. From theories and mythology to politics and Popsicle sticks. Compounding my thought in written form is my passion. It has been my friend, my sword and my voice.  We can see that broadcast journalists bring too a notebook and pen to jot down essential information. With this information, they report it to the viewers in another form of media. It is an evolved form of journalism, taking it to another level. Keeping it in my dreams, and having my pen and notebook in my pocket and knapsack will surely help. So as you pack your things for an exciting day ahead, together with family, friends, or even just alone, what item never leaves you?

      can anybody tell me more info on MSN messenger? thanks.  Ok, so what happened today?  1. I'm back with my place!!! Associate Managing Editor once again. This illegitimate post will be gone next year so better stick with it.  2. There's a chance to fulfill my high school dream (and that's not getting a girlfriend)!!! If things will go well, I may be the EIC next school year??? As explained by Ms. Ma. Cristina Anasta. Oh God, I really need it for college. Being the EIC will fulfill my journalistic dreams!!! My dream? to be a broadcast journalist. Think, Howie Severino and Reporter's Notebook.  3. Abel will be trained. He needs it. Being AE means a lot of responsibilities. A LOT!!!  At least hindi na ako ang mangungulit sa staff. Mwahahahaha!!!   4. Memories. Sol, Tj and me reminisced the old times, singing theme songs from Voltes V, Bioman, Power Rangers, Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon and the like. Forgive us, we have an unfulfilled childhood.  5. My journal. No, not this one, the notebook. Ms. Arboleda already added her own love quote.  Roommates nga sila ni Ms. Anasta. Pakita ko next time.   Darn, I just found that there is an army of ants under my seat. Time to kill!!!
