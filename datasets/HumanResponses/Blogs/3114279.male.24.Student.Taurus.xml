      "As a lower-class kid, I was raised to think success would be owning stuff. Having that great job, too. Now I find my parents' dream was wrong. You never really own anything. And you're never really finished as a person. Still, you can be stuck, trapped by possessions and an outdated self image. Other than that, I think humanity is perfect. We're making the same mistakes we made 1,000 years ago. So they must be the right ones. So relax." - Chuck Palahniuk

      I went jogging last night, for the first time in months.  I was pretty appalled at how completely exhausted I got and how sore I am today.  I used to be able to jog for a few hours like it was nothing.  I was so tired that I could barely speak to order my soda at the express afterwards.  I'm going to go again tonight and hopefully get back into some sort of shape.   As I was jogging, some guy drove up next to me, leaned out of his truck, and told me I was "going seven."  There is a really great  urlLink interview with Richard Kelly , the guy who wrote/directed Donnie Darko, about that movie, and his amazing-sounding upcoming projects, as well as the possibility of a Donnie Darko : Director's Cut.  Also really cool to hear about the possibility of Terry Gilliam directing a film adaptation of the book  urlLink Good Omens  by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.  There aren't any movies out currently that I'm dying to see, except maybe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which I guess I'll have to drive to Jacksonville to see.

      Oh, physics. That class is the bane of my existence. It forces me to use tired old cliches when describing it. Is tired old cliche a tired old cliche? I don't know. Anyway, my poor Senators were eliminated by the stinking Toronto Maple Leafs yesterday. Learn to use proper grammar, you CN tower bastards. It's   leaves  , not leafs. Morons. Anyway, this weekend is the last day of shooting for my T.A.P, including a scene with Nick and Ryan, an outdoor scene, and the infamous Punk Rock Amy scene. We'll see how it all goes.   On the other side of things, I met my opposite yesterday. Now, as all of those who know me know, I am in this premed thing to become a forensic pathologist. My reasons are trifold; first, I hate people, and this way I don't have to deal with people whining "my arm hurts," "I have a rash," "I can't breathe," or "I'm bleeding." Wah, wah, wah. This way nobody talks, and I don't have to listen to their trash. Secondly, I don't think I could deal with the pressure that my decisions could result in somebody living or dying. This way they come to me dead, they leave me dead, anything other than that happens and it's just a bonus. Third, I kind of want to one day be that old crusty pathologist you see in the movies, unshaven, eating a baloney sandwich, when the sheriff busts in and says "Shaheen, I don't like you and you don't like me, but we've got a killer on the loose and you're the only one with the know-how to stop him." So that's basically all laid out. This guy in a couple of classes starts talking to me the other day about how he wants to be a doctor not for the money, but so he can help people. He just loves people. He wants to do mission trips and crap. He says one of the greatest things he'd like to say to somebody would be "I'm sorry, but I can't help you anymore, but Jesus Christ can." Now, I don't know about you, dear reader, but that's about the goddamned last thing I'd ever want to hear come out of a doctor's mouth. Take two Jesi and call me in the morning. Fuck that! He said he wants to witness miracles. I told him I don't want to see any miracles in the morgue, or I'd high tail it out of there. Yikes.  Been on a Sergio Leone kick lately. One of the greatest filmmakers in history. His best film is easily Once Upon a Time in the West. Excellent.  Three people show up to meet Charlie Bronson at a train station, all of them with guns drawn. Charlie: "You bring a horse for me?" Bad Guy: "Looks like we're one horse short." Charlie: "No. You brought two too many."

      Yo yo yo. We shot some scenes for my awful movie this weekend. Turned out really damn funny. Got reminded constantly that I am a bad director and actor, but that's how it is. It's just for fun. Also saw Kill Bill Vol. 2. Fucking awesome movie, no matter what my friend Ryan may say. I can't let forth any details, because certain people who also write in this blog haven't even seen vol. 1 yet. And they rhyme with ick. And start with an N. Senators tied their series. Go, O-town.

      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn, the lazy guy who never posts. Service zone sucks, yadayadayada. Anyway, heading to the great lake today for some shootage of my movie, which is tentatively called "Glenn's terrible-ass project where he proves he made the right decision in not attending film school." Ha ha, just kidding. It's called "T.A.P." for short. Looking forward to spending my tax return on pointless crap. And food. I'm going to go eat at Mori (local sushi place) when that republican money starts coming in. Screw social betterment, Imma git me an xbox. Nick is going to see KBV2 with us tonight, whether he likes it or not. If he's broke we'll scrounge the cash, or make him sell his body. I think a Tarantino flick in the theater, even if it is the crappy ass lake city theater, is worth the abandonment of scruples.   So in poetry club last night this girl who was workshopping her poem was almost in tears by the end. I felt bad, but you shouldn't bring in a poem you completely love to be workshopped. You bring it in because you need help with it. I think a lot of people have the attitude that they'll bring in a poem and wow everybody with it and will get the response "Well, I quit writing. This is amazing and needs no work." Hell, even I used to bring in poems based on that thought. Now I realize a poem is done when the writer thinks it's done, so don't bring in that poem to get workshopped. Bring in a poem you don't like so much, or have trouble with. People can always critique anything, so leave the stuff you don't want critiqued at home. She's a good writer, but some people don't respond well to criticism.   My new musical collaborator and I started working on our music. Sounds pretty good so far. I listend to "Nice Ass" by Free Kitten and loved the sloppy sound. I think that's what I want. Anyway, I gotsta get going to Psycho class.  In health news, I feel fine. - Kevin Nealon

      You know, lots of people warned me not to work at Service Zone. Lots and lots of people. But I didn't listen to them, and worked at that dank pit of stupidity for just three days before quitting. Nobody there knows about computers. It's amazing Dell sells anything whatsoever. In that three days that I was there I was yelled at by the payroll lady for Service Zone's errors three times, because I didn't do things they didn't tell me I was supposed to do, and I was lied to about how much I was going to be paid. So I quit. No big deal. I'd find another job. Little did I know that same lady would lie to unemployment about my status, preventing me from going back to that, and then even after two months of calling not send me my w-2. I thought it wouldn't matter, because I only received one paycheck and it has all the tax info, so no big deal. Anyway, I needed the employer number, so I had to call several times once again before I finally talked to her, and she got very angry and told me she had to call corporate for the number and it would take about 5 days. 5 days? What does she have to use, the fucking pony express? And this is a computer place we're talking about here! So I called corporate myself and gave them the what how, and then this lady calls me back today yelling at me to stop calling corporate, like I was some type of stalker. I called them once. Argh! I got the number, which kind of irritates me cuz I wanted to report service zone to the IRS. Anyway, the point of this long and boring story is that Nick and I should start an enemies list. So here it is thus far:  ENEMIES: Jill Milton, employee of Service Zone Adolf Hitler, fascist dictator and murderer of millions.  We'll add to it as we go on.   My next post will be funnier. I just had to vent.

      Well,  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  was incredible.  I expected it to be good, but it was even better than I expected.  It was heartbreaking and uplifting.  To me it is the best kind of movie, the kind where I felt a little different after seeing it.  I saw it in my favorite theatre in the world, the Royal Park Stadium.  It was pretty empty last night, and I think I counted 15 people in Eternal Sunshine.  I saw a trailer for a movie called  urlLink Garden State , which looks good.  I killed some time in Borders after the movie, and spent my last bit of money on the new  urlLink Death Cab for Cutie , which is fantastic.  The Borders in Gainesville has the best men's room wall grafitti.  Glad to hear you had a good Easter weekend.  I spent the day with family.  We had a big family lunch at my great aunt's, who lives in the middle of nowhere, and I mean literally the middle of nowhere, twenty minutes plus away from "civilization."  There's the true story of my great uncle who had a heart attack that we always wonder if it would have been completely fatal, except that it took the ambulance so long to get to him because he lives just in the middle of nothing.  So I saw lots of family, some of which I hadn't seen since I was younger ("Our little boys all growns up"), and ate lots of food, and had some very rural times.  No drinking for me, and no cops breaking anything up.  So now that's all over, and I guess the next holiday we have to look forward to is, what, 4th of July?  Fight restroom advertising!

      So, here I am, lazy bastard extraordinaire, posting again. The easter weekend was a lazy extravaganza, but if I was religious then I'd say Jesus spent most of easter weekend being lazy. Really lazy. I mean dead. Anyway, I saw Spartan, David Mamet's new film (one of the joys of living in a college town is that I don't have to drive 45 minutes to see new movies). It was really damn good. Sucker can write some scripts. Nick, I hope you like eternal sunshine. It is also damn good. Charlie Kaufman can write him some scripts too. I learned a valuable lesson about drinking on Saturday, which I've learned before, and that is don't drink too much because it sucks. The party I left (which only turned into a party as all of our friends progressively showed up troughout the night) was eventually busted up by the police, I guess, which is bizarre because none of my friends are really the busted by the police types. Nobody went to jail, which I guess is all you can ask for when it comes down to it.   So, in the spirit of this boring boring post, I am going to tell a story about my dream woman, whom I saw on campus the other day. This supercool black chick dressed as a skater and wearing an "I Love Nerds" shirt walked by (too hot in my opinion. I guess that makes me a racist. My bad), talking to her friend about this psycho guy who kept calling her. "He won't leave me alone. He's psycho," she said. Her friend left, and then this other black guy out of nowhere just comes up and tries hitting on her. He goes "This guy won't leave you alone? Let's see what I can do about that. I'm James," (I'm guessing the name.  I can't remember.) She kind of looks at him incredulously and goes "I'm Suzie." (again, the name is a guess). So she starts walking and he is following her and he just starts talking crap like "Oh, I'll take care of this guy. What do you want me to do to him?" and she just says "Stop following me!" The guy stops, obviously shocked that his smoove-mo-b routine didn't pan out and yells "I ain't following you! You're psycho!" So she turns around, super-cool and says "I am psycho. I'm not afraid to admit it!" Then she walked out of my life. Oh man! I've never seen anybody shot down like that. But what I want to know is what the hell this guy was thinking. I mean, did he think to himself "Oh, I'll show this poor timid girl I can kick dudes' asses. Then she'll be mine." Give me a break. This isn't 1954, hoss. I bet she would have kicked both of their asses in a fight. And to end with a quote:  "I love you dream woman!" - Garth in Wayne's World

      So this is the first post by me, Glenn Shaheen. Man, this is kind of like a job interview or something. I have to be really funny or people are going to say "That Glenn, I don't like his posts. He gots no wit." Well. I just hope I don't spel anything wrong. Oh, damn! That should be spell anything incorrectly! I'm so screwed. But I have to give props to Nick for showing me this thing.  Do we get emo points for having a weblog? I hope not. Next thing you know I'll be listening to Jimmy Eat World and snobbing my way through Jim Morrison's poetry book. I'll start pretending I'll never get old, and that MTV bands really suck, even though my entire cd collection will be on heavy rotation. I'm so bitter. I once liked a girl who ended up liking some guy in a band with influences including "AFI, Our Lady Peace, and Dashboard Confessional," although they're really original, she swears. I just want to know when the jocks took back rock and roll. They had it in the 80s with hair metal, but the losers took it back briefly in the early 90s for grunge. Now all this noise. I guess I have to live with the fact that I'll never be in a band because I don't work out three times a day and don't look like I should be in a CK ad. But c'est la vie, au jour d'hui, at least.  I am happy Easter is here, though. It has the best candy of any holiday. Hooray for dying Jesus! I think I'd even see the Jesus Chainsaw Massacre again if I got a couple of free cadbury creme eggs out of the deal.  Nick always has quotes on his, so I guess I'll dig one out of "A Far Rockaway of the Heart," a book of poems by Lawrence Ferlenghetti. "So rent a museum     and see yourself in mirrors--  In every room an exposition  of a different phase in your life  with all your figures and faces and pictures of all the people who passed through you and all the scenes you passed through all the landscapes of living and longing and desiring and spending and getting and doing and dying and sighing and laughing and crying."  I really had to stop myself from putting the whole thing in. Damn good book.

      Spaceballs was a blast last night.  The place was packed.  I didn't mind that a very cute girl sat next to me and laughed with me and even ended up kind of snuggling up against me.  I'll never see her ever again I'm sure, but those sort of little fleeting moments are wonderful, even if they are only temporary.  Everything is temporary, I guess.  Very tired today, lost an hour last night due to daylight savings.

      Yo yo yo. My tyrannical reign as poetry club president continues. I held an officer meeting last night, but used my executive power to have it at a bar where we could watch the stanley cup game. We didn't get much done. Nah, we're going to try to have a reading in a month or so, so I have to get on that ball. I also have to get on the ball of sending out some more poetriums to places and things. Nick, I know you like Eternal Sunshine, but you can't make something your favorite movie until it's been out for a year, at least. You need perspective and a further eye. I'm sorry, but them's the rules. In fact, I won't even supplant Jackie Brown as my favorite Tarantino movie with Kill Bill until I have a year's respite. There are guidelines for these things, you know.  I'm starting to feel really sorry for one of my roommates boyfriends, because he's so nice and naivish and knows nothing about her other boyfriend. Once upon a time I had feelings that could be hurt, so I kind of feel sorry for the kid. There's nothing I can do to help that is within my boundaries, though. On the friend scale Laurie definitely ranks higher than this guy whom I don't even know that well.  You know, I was going to try to comedy up this post, and then I was going to try to serious up this post, but I think I've decided to nerd it up. I am sick and tired of trying to explain all of the reasons why the original Star Trek is much better than Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now, don't get me wrong; the next generation is all well and good, but when it comes down to it it is some goody two-shoes brit flying around putting flowers places, smiling at everybody, some dumb sweet in-joke happens and the strings swell and everybody smiles warmly like it's goddamned Jane Austen in space! Data is D'arcy. I really like it, and I watch it, so people who are about to get offended please don't (Jane), but it pales to the original. In the original the Enterprise strutted through the galaxy finding weird shit on fucked up planets. That's what's so scientific cool about that. There was a cowboy planet, a gangster planet, a roman planet, a nazi planet - you name it! Sure, it didn't make any sense, but it was strange as a motherfucker, and that's what I liked. I love the way when they went to a barren world there was this kind of wind-chimey sound in the background, or how the special effects were the kind of bad level they ended up being good. Just fucked up shit all the time. It couldn't exist in the real universe, but it didn't have to and recognized that. That's the problem with 80s+ trek. It tries to be too realistic. Maybe that's why I like Q episodes so much in the next generation. I don't know. Anyway, that's my rant.  "From Hell's hot, I stab at thee. For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." - Khan from Star Trek II, quoting some high-falootin' literature

      It seems there have been some new terms being thrown around that I did not previously know about.  These are new terms to me, well, new as in I've only heard them as of this year.  I don't live in an urban area, and though I visit an urban area often, and other larger cities, I live in a smaller town, so the hip bullshit takes a little longer to get to me.  That is also due to me not watching MTV or getting on chatrooms, or whatever.  Back in January, after spilling my soul to a friend of mine about my romantic troubles, she says to me "Maybe you are  urlLink QuirkyAlone !"  QuirkyAlone I guess is someone too neurotic or insecure or just plain strange to be in a relationship.  Or maybe that's just in my case.  I did some research, and I guess it is people who are not into the dating as sport kind of thing, or just getting into a relationship just because that's the thing to do, etc. etc.  I'm on board with that, I suppose.  I'd never heard of that, and most of my "big city" friends hadn't heard of that either.  Apparently there is a big movement or QuirkyAlones.  Then a guy friend of mine accused me of being a " urlLink metrosexual ".  I had never heard this before, and I was offended.  I went and looked up the definition, and I was still offended.  Basically this is a gay guy who is straight.  I have some macho and some typical male in me.  Just because I am more sensitive and sentimental and introspective and neat and emotional and... Okay. I guess I am on board with that too.  Isn't this whole metrosexual thing in vogue now?  Don't girls like that kind of thing these days?  And aren't girls attracted to loners?  So I should have a lot going for me at this point.

      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn with a gross-out story for all to hear. So, gather round, kiddies, for the latest Publix adventure. Last night, the same as many nights at Publix, I was bagging groceries, when I notice this woman doing her shopping. She is in her early twenties, and very heavy, but wearing these short short shorts with a slit up the side. I couldn't turn away. When there is that much skin it is impossible to avoid it. I don't know what it is. Even if she was a guy I couldn't have turned away. It's just human nature. Anyway, she picks my aisle (of course) and the first four items she slides down are two boxes of condoms and two tubes of astroglide. Then the smell hit me. The smell of hours of gross, slapping, unwashed sex. Ugh! I almost gagged right there. She asked me to help her out, and on the way she says, very flirtily, "Pretty sad that the only thing I have to do on a Friday night is grocery shop, huh?" I just got the fuck out of dodge as quickly as I could. And that is the story of how the very last of my libido was destroyed.

      Yo yo yo. So poetry club went ok. My brief tenure as president will probably be eventless, as we have few people attending over the summer, so my rule of the iron fist will be fairly short. I've got a new movie brewing. There will be no script for this one. Hopefully it won't turn into a full fledged disaster, but I guess it'd be kind of cool if it did. I like watching that Hindenburg footage, after all. After talking with my roommate the other day I came to the conclusion that if I don't get some kind of for rizzle dizzle girlfriend soon my neuroses will probably just completely envelope my mind and I'll never ever get a girlfriend. Now, this is in the dangerous territory known as settling for whomever one may find, but I don't know. I'm in a rough spot, I think. I guess I really don't need a girlfriend, in the long run, since most of the stuff I like doing is solitary in nature, but there will be a time when all of my friends are married, engaged, or otherwise entangled romantically, and then when they have their dinner parties I'll be the guest everybody feels awkward around. I don't get why society demands we have to hook up with somebody. Why the hell can't I just be alone, goddamnit? Well, I'll stop ranting.  Nick Dalie, I don't think I'd call Eternal Sunshine my favorite movie, but it's definitely a damned good one. I think I prefer adaptation, even. Not to detract from it, and people should go see it, although it's gone from the regular theater now. It'll probably be in dollarland pretty soon. On the flip flop of things, there are no prostitutes wandering my street anymore. I am so fucking happy.

Nick :   
      If you have asked me recently or ask me now what my favorite movie is, I have replied and will continue to reply  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  I knew as soon as the credits rolled at the end that it was my favorite movie; I don't think I've ever had quite that strong of a reaction to a film.  But I've noticed that a lot of people do not like this movie.  Glenn, I know you liked it.  But you are actually the only person I personally know who saw the film and liked it.  Everyone else I have talked to either did not like it, or has resisted seeing it because their friends or family didn't like it, for whatever reason.  I could be a movie snob and say that they just "didn't understand it," or that it was too "arty" or whatever. But I don't think that is actually it.  But I think it was a fantastic movie that had me thinking about it and feeling it since I've watched it.  So here is my sort of personal "review" of the film.  If you haven't seen it, I'll try not to ruin it for you.  First, I think how you see and feel about this film actually depends partially on your own life experience.  If you have never been in "love," or you are shallow in your relationships, just for sex or whatever, you may not be able to seriously relate.  But the film, for me, mirrored some of my own life experiences.  About six months ago the most serious relationship I had ever been involved in, and the most heartbreaking, ended.  There is a scene in the film where the Jim Carrey character gathered all of the things his ex had given him and even the things that reminded him of her into a plastic trash bag- a few months ago I had done the exact same thing.  The central idea of the movie is the two people go and get all memories of each other erased.  This is obviously sci-fi, and a bit unrealistic, sure, but you can take that as two people trying to forget each other.  God knows I've tried to just forget all of my relationships, especially the last one.  As the film goes on, you start to realize certain things the movie is trying to say:  that maybe it is better to have "loved and lost," that even if a relationship doesn't last forever (and in reality, what  does  last forever?), it is better to have the great memories to savor over time as the hurt (hopefully and usually) wears off.  Most importantly, the film is saying that without facing your past mistakes, you are doomed to repeat them.  You could say that even when you do realize your mistakes, you will likely repeat them.  Would you erase the memories of a hurtful relationship?  In the month or two after she and I broke up, I might have liked that idea.  In the movie, after having all memories of each other erased, they get back together again, though you get a feeling that it might just turn sour again eventually.  If you read the  urlLink script , you'll see the authors original intended ending, which is even more bleak:  it shows the couple as elderly people, getting themselves erased from each others memories again, having had the procedure done dozens of times over the years.  These are themes not typically done in movies, but it's what life is  really  like.  Life is never "happily ever after."  Life is flaws and disagreements and some very dark, hurtful moments.  Even love is like that; shit, sometimes  especially  love is like that.  I obviously saw a lot of the scenes in a personal way because of my own recent experience.  You'll relate to this film if you've ever broken up with anybody, or if you look at love as more than just the typical Hollywood and Nicholas Sparks bullshit.  Love is a terrifying thing, and it fucking hurts.  But, as it is in real life, and as the movie shows through all the cynicism, love is still something that, I believe, human beings need.  Romantic love especially.  I have never felt as shattered and desperately heartbroken and lonely in my life as I did those months ago, but six short months later, I'm still the same hopeless romantic who would still fall in love in a heartbeat.  So there you go.  It's amazing that Charlie Kaufman works in the Hollywood system and gets these movies made.  Adaptation was another amazing movie, and Being John Malkovich before that.  Human Nature was pretty cool, too.  Those movies are thinkers.  Eternal Sunshine is not nearly as much of a brain thinker as his previous movies;  it's a movie you have to think and feel with your heart more than your brain.  Obviously, it is recommended.  Go see it, if it's still playing.

      Yo yo yo. So, with this blog thing I guess one of the main things is whom exactly should one tell about it? Cuz maybe I want to talk trash about somebody, but then I'd forget and tell them, they'd go and read my blog and then fireworks! Well, I'm going to talk trash about my roommate. Not really trash, but the other day I was commenting about how cool her bed was, and she said if I was her sex slave for the summer I could use it. She was totally serious. I'm not talking bad about her though. I would have taken the offer if it meant I could have been the sole user of her bed, but the offer meant I could sleep with her in the bed. Fuck that! It's already hot as a motherfucker up in this mug. Besides, being a sex slave would be totally inconvenient. I'd have to drop whatever I'd be doing just to please her. If I was out with friends she could call me up and be like "Glenn. Head. Now." I couldn't get out of it. After all, it is sex   slave  , not sex   employee  . I don't think we'll avoid each other sexually all summer long. We've been drinking a lot. A lot. Plus I'm frayed pretty thin, because I haven't had a girlfriend in many a moon. At some point one's brain just says "fuck it. it's worth it." Hm. Well, Nick Daleeeeeeeeeeeeeey, I hope you're feeling better. Me, I'm tired and sluggish, and I have to go be president of poetry club in a few short minutes. I don't even have a prompt. So, gotsta go. Come up with something interesting next time.

      Yo yo yo. I am Glenn, an irritated person trying to pay some bills. Not like it's working. That's what I get for having too many online passwords. Watched Blade Runner again last night. I find it difficult to believe that even now, 22 years after it was made, with all of the so-called advances in cinema technology, that it would look any better. What an awesome fucking movie. I can't believe I don't own it. So I've decided to have people over to my house this weekend, since I no longer live in a disgusting prostitute infested hellhole. Should be pretty fun, although I don't really want the upstairs neighbors to call the cops, since we could be evicted for not alerting the landlord to our sublease. Meh. I figured at this late point in the week at least one interesting thing would have happened to me, but no dice. Just moving and class, and as of 7 o'clock today work. Yay. My favorite place. Not really. Well, catch you peeps on the flip flop. I have to go and try to start organizing for poetry club.  Glenn

      I have added a little "comments" thingy on the site, just for Jane.  I will do a guestbook later, when I find one I like.  I like the comments thing, though.  I'm pretty shocked that people are reading this!  I'll have to try to be more interesting.  Promise Ring???

Glenn :   
      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn, lazoid supreme. I have now entered my mid 20s. 24. The beginning of the prologue of the introduction to the pre-end. I feel kind of old. True, I am only in my early-mid-twenties, but next year I'll be in my mid-mid-twenties, and before I know it I'll be in my early-late-twenties. Aging is a scientific bitch. Classes have again started. The people in my classes are still whiney retards, but I only have to put up with them in one class this semester, so it shouldn't be too bad. The songs I have started for my summer project are beginning to take shape, and I am very happy about that. Moving this weekend also, a definite plus since my roommate caught a prostitute having sex on our porch the other night. Oh, I wish that was a joke. If I post more often, maybe it would be less uninteresting events in my life and more humorous observations. Hm. So the last week of class a bunch of scientific geniuses started circulating emails complaining about our chemistry professor, and how it was his fault they were failing, and blah blah blah. One guy responded by saying the whole system of chemistry was at fault, but students aren't powerless, and our voices can change how it is taught, and how the textbooks are written, etc. Here is the email I sent him in return.    Hmm. You raise an interesting point. But then again, perhaps it's not the  book or the professor. Perhaps it's chemistry itself! We, the students of  FSU, should unite together to change the science of chemistry! After all,  with all of these fancy equations, and numberamas, and thingamabobs, it gets mighty peculiar. Why, if we just changed it so it was much simpler, we'd have all gotten much better grades! What's the point for all them high-falootin' elements up there on that brainy-brained e-lem-ental tabular? We only need about ten of those. When you gonna see cesium in the real world? Matter o' fact, when you gonna see electrons in the real world? Never. Electrons ain't a gonna git me a brand new porsche, no siree bob. Chemistry should be a one-two buckle my shoe science. Just addition and subtraction. What do you get when you put hydrochloric acid with ammonium hydroxide? Simple. Hydrochloricacidammoniumhydroxide. One and one is two. Ain't no blip nor blap bout it. So what say you, fellow students? We gotta git this ball a rollin, otherwise it'll be football season and we won't have no time 'tall.    Man, I hate my classmates.  In a story of typical Glennluck, I was walking to pay my tuition today when a malfunctioning sprinkler turned on next to me and directly sprayed me with water. I'm not talking a little bit of sub-stream, but a full on geyser. It was a really hot day out, so I didn't care that much.

Glenn :   
      Yo yo yo, Nick. Good to hear things are going ok in Naples, Italy. I mean, Sofla. I also saw Fahrenheit 9/11 the other night. I really enjoyed it, but it was kind of propagandaish, right? I mean, don't get me wrong, I love propaganda if I agree with its message, but he may come across as a bully to those who don't agree with him. Anyway, I really hope Bush doesn't get reelected, although I can't do anything about it. Of course, my general sense of disillusionment about the government as a whole makes me think that nobody has pure ideals when they go into politics. I guess you just have to vote based on which pocket the candidate is in is worse. Should I even be saying this stuff? I don't really want to be carted off to Guantanamo Bay or anything.   So it's been a little while since I posted, and I am sorry, although I have done a better job keeping up with this thing than I thought. I guess I have one last little ranty list that I want to put together more for my own benefit than the 3 or 4 readers this weblog may have. So this is the top 5 things I want out of life. After I write this out I'll start being funny again.   1. A house in the country and an apartment in a major metropolis.  I guess I could take either-or, but both is ideal. I love how when you're in the country night is so silent, and the stars just jump out at you. No airplanes or ghetto birds buzzing you at night, no drunk sorority girls singing 80s songs in the street, and no yellowey street lights washing out the sky. Of course, I also kind of like the hustle and bustle of big cities. Not that I've been to too many, just St. Louis, Atlanta, and Chicago, but I really loved the pace of Chicago. I think that's a place I'd like to live if I ever had the money and half a choice.   2. Money  This seems so banal, but it would just make things so much easier. I know you hear a lot of famous people saying "Oh, money doesn't make life easy," or fairy tales that teach us "It isn't what you own," but yeah, it kind of is what you own, or that you don't have to worry about things, like paying for the hospital, or where the next meal is coming from. In fact, this should maybe be number one. That would just make me look like some 1986 greed dealer. Oh well. Anybody who has been in the real world knows a million dollars would make everything a hell of a lot easier. Fuck those lying Hollywood fucks.  3. Time to travel  I was reading the Alphabet of Desire by Barbara Hamby the other day and there are a ton of poems in there that just have to do with jetting off to Europe for a few months or whatever. This is the kind of thing I'd like to be able to do. But maybe not just this, but also the ability to just get up and say, yeah, I'm going to take work off for the next week and drive to Nebraska. I guess I want my job to be a side note.  4. Somebody to love  Man, my list is so cliche, but aren't cliches sometimes true? I don't care how supposedly "quirky-alone" I am, or how much some infantile relationship would destroy my entire life right now, at some point I would like a girl who could just stop and look at things with me, take a week off work to drive to Nebraska (not that I have some fixation with Nebraska, but that's just the example), or feed me alphabet soup when I run out of words. I cheated on that last one, because I used that line in a poem a long time ago. It's still true, though. Also, after attending Megacon I realized the kind of girl for me is the kind of girl who'd dress up as a comic book character. In fact, the kind of girl for me would buy a bunch of different comics than me every week so we could switch around on wednesday. Man, I'm such a picky nerd.  5. Fame  Ok, so my list is the lamest list in the history of lists. These are exactly the same five things that everybody probably wants. But let me justify this fame thing. I don't necessarily want to have people shouting my name on the street or asking me for my autograph, but I would like respect in my field. That is, I would like people I've never met reading my work and citing me as an influence. When I do a reading somewhere I would like for there to be a good sized audience, and to have sycophants come up to me and say how moved they were by whatever the hell it was that I read. This all sounds so trite, but it'd be kind of affirming, right? I mean, it would mean I'm good at what I do, which I guess I shouldn't tip toe around saying, because it's obvious I'm leaning toward the writing thing. But that would facilitate all of these, if I was good enough. I had better start really trying.   Gots to see me some Spider-man 2 tomorrow.

      Wow.  It's been awhile since anyone has posted anything here.  Sorry about that.  I'm here in Naples.  I obviously made it here alright, and I've just been hanging out, getting settled in and becoming more acquainted with the area, waiting to start work next week.  I have managed to go swimming, though the weather has been too lousy to really go out to the beach or anything.  I caught Farenheit 9/11 today at the theatre, which was really excellent.  I bought some new clothes, and have patronized the local used record store.  That's about it.    Nothing much new to report.  It's still a little strange being here, and not the most comfortable situation as the house I am staying in is still in the process of being furnished and fixed up, and it is also not going to be my permanent residence.  Nothing too interesting is coming to mind to post right this second, but I plan to get back into being online and hopefully posting more often very soon.  And hopefully Glenn will post something soon as well.  Later.

Nick :   
      Today was my last day of work at the Library. I've felt&nbsp;only a twinge&nbsp;of sentimentality. As much as I've felt unfulfilled with that job for a while now, and as much as certain people have grated on my nerves or whatever, it has been like a second family in some respects for me for the last five years. I feel like I've grown up there, and I kind of have; I was 18 when I started there. I won't miss it, though.&nbsp; This job just replaced high school for me.&nbsp; It's time to grow up.&nbsp; And actually, when I really think about it, I hate the job now.&nbsp; It was fun for the first couple of years, and it was nice to say "I work at the library," you know, that was good for the girl's parents or whatever, but these last two years I've hated my job, and except for maybe four or five people, I won't really miss anyone.&nbsp; There, now I look like an asshole, but I don't care.&nbsp; This job blows, it's boring, no challenge, the people are uptight (well, that's to be expected, it is a library).&nbsp; I really can't wait to leave.&nbsp; I take it back, I feel no sentimentality.  I found out that I won't be starting work on Monday, due to the difficulties with getting things together from such a distance, and also some of Lake City's "slowness." So I'll have a week in Naples with pretty much nothing to do. I'm trying to see this as a positive, as I'll be able to go swimming, get settled in, get more familiar with the area, go to the movies, etc. etc. I was anxious to start work right away. I'll just have to watch my money.

Glenn :   
      So here's my last venting rant for a while. I need to kind of organize things for the state of mind I'm in right now, so I've made a couple of lists. The first is a ripoff of what Rob does in High Fidelity (great book and great movie. I spent 9/11 watching this with a friend). So, here it is, for my benefit, my top 5 job list.  1. Professional Writer  At first my job list was just a conglomeration of writing jobs, like screenwriter, or poet, or comic book writer, but really all of these would be great. I mean, I'll do this no matter what I end up doing, so it'd be fantastic to get paid for it as well. As of today I've only made about $150 off of writing, and that's just contests. I wonder if my moral and ethic code would allow me to write some Tom Clancy crap for the bucks. I mean, these books they have at publix are utter shit. There are literally 15 or so books about jet pilots with names like "Punk's Run" and "Blue Skies." Somebody gets paid for this? Who wants to read these flattened out rolls of toilet paper? Old bald guys with a beer gut who like to make believe they'd strangle commies and arabs with old glory if they got the chance? And don't get me started on Harlequin romances. I can think of 20 synonyms for glistening cock. I can write a book like that. Urgh. I guess I just need to start sending out non stop.  2. The Creative Force In A Band  I know, I know. I'm not hip enough. I don't buy my entire wardrobe at Hot Topic, and I don't roll my eyes at anybody who owns Michael Jackson's Thriller (which is a fucking awesome album that I do own). So how could I ever be in a band? It would still be a great gig, to have people want to listen to your music and get paid for it. My problem is organizing the people for the band, though. I can never quite get enough. Also, pretty much every local scene is just rife with nepotism. You don't play unless you know somebody. You don't come back unless you have an entourage of about 30 mall punk girls who think you're the greatest musician since Ludwig Van, and you're so poetic when you sing about "The girl who took my rotten heart/and stepped on it in the dark." Agh! Open a book! Use a thesaurus! Don't sing about the same goddamned shit everybody's been singing about for 200 fucking years! On a side note, Mrs. Keeler, if you're reading this I'd just like to say that the profanity is as much a comedic and rhythmic element as a device for emphasis, so I don't really mean to offend. Unless of course, the person reading it is in some stupid indie band who's in it for fucking girls and money. Agh! *On a side note I was going to make another entry on my list "record label owner," but I think I'll throw it here as a side note. This way I could reject all of these dumb avril lavigne fucks when they send me their demos that daddy paid for. Grrrr.   3. Comic Shop Owner  This'd be ok. I could read comics all day long and talk to people about comics all day long and be surrounded by comics all day long. I'm a nerd. I'd also be a better comic shop owner than the owner of my comic shop, who doesn't know blip bout blap bout comics. The cute girl who works there does, though. Not that I want to ask her out or anything. Well, maybe I do, but so does every other nerd who walks into that store. I went to Megacon in march, which is a massive Orlando based comic book convention, and I realized that whenever I do get a serious girlfriend again I would really like it if she was into comics and would dress up with me to go to one of those conventions. That's totally hot. And I'm a nerd. Did I mention that already?  4. College Professor  I almost cracked and put teacher. Ha ha, just kidding. But college professor would be alright. I mean, I guess if I made it as a writer I could do this in conjunction, but it would be great to always be in an academic environment, surrounded by intelligent people all of the time. The real world really doesn't have a whole lot of them.  5. Forensic Pathologist  Ok, ok. So this job would be pretty fucking sweet. It's just the getting there that irritates me. I hate all of my smug classmates, I hate all of my boring classes, and I hate all of my boring homework. But I blow all of my smug classmates out of the water on tests, I ace all of my boring classes, and I don't really have homework, I just had to stick a number three in there for the rhythmic triad rule. I also really love when I tell somebody I'm going to be a doctor and they get this brightened expression on their face and say "Oh really? Family practice?" and I say "No. Forensic Pathologist. I'll be cutting up dead people." Ha ha ha ha! You don't want me marrying your daughter anymore! Oh, old publix people. Hilarious.    So that helps me a bit. Actually, I have a little bit more ranting to do, but this is a long post, so I'll hold off for a couple of days. Until then, l8r sk8rs.

      Glenn, nice list.  I feel somewhat justified now for having Eternal Sunshine on my list since you put Kill Bill on yours.  Though I did not see it five times at the theatre.  I don't have that kind of money to throw down.  I don't feel the way you do about Lake City.  Of course I haven't really lived anywhere else.  I'll be very glad to get out of here, and I mean very glad.   Looking forward to your venting.

Glenn :   
      So Lake City for five days was ok. Every time I end up going there I try to reevaluate my life and what I'm doing. Would I like to live in a small town? I guess, if I could write, and obtain some kind of notoriety. Not like the fame is the most important part of it all, but at least recognition would justify it a bit. I still don't really know what I want out of life. Every now and then it'll be like something clicks, for just a second, and everything almost seems clear and I can almost cling to some kind of direction, but that fades and I'm left where I started. It's usually landscapes or sunsets that trigger this. I think it reminds me of home, like Nova Scotia home. Maybe some kind of pilgrimage would help clarify things a bit, or maybe I just need to sit down and think what I want out of life. Not my parents, not my friends, but me. Hm. I had a nice and funny long diatribe about umbrella holding, but I'll wait on that. Sometimes you just need to vent, regardless of whether or not it would make for an interesting post. So, you want a classic top ten list? But what about the seven out of my top ten movies which were already earlier than 1980? Well, that ain't gonna fly. So I'll tell you what. I'll make a top 10 movie list of movies that I watch the most often, regardless of how much I appreciate them as cinematic. So here it is, my "Nick Dalyesque Top Ten Movie List"  1. 2001: A Space Odyssey  Sorry, but I watched this movie every night for like an entire year. It still makes number one.  2. Dawn Of The Dead  And this one is also a repeat. My bad.  3. Revenge of the Nerds  I just put this one at number three to get all the repeats out of the way. No matter how cheesy this movie is I still almost choke up at the end.  4. Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan  Yeah yeah, this is everybody's favorite, but it's still damn good. I don't even think Shatner's acting is that bad, to tell you the truth. And it's not just a space shoot-em-up; the getting old theme really plays through it quite well, and even now I can start to identify. James Horner's great score is also a plus.  5. The Big Lebowski  There are few movies I can quote to the same degree as this movie. I haven't seen it in a little while because somebody has my copy, but if I wanted I could probably just act out the whole damn movie anyway. I have a feeling this top ten list is going to be mostly comedies. Oh well.  6. Wayne's World  This is one of said few movies I can quote as much as Big Lebowski. Yeah, it's stupid and immature and adolescent and aimed at a target audience of 13 year old boys, but it's still goddamned funny.  7. American Grafitti  If I was in some other mood this wouldn't make the list, although it is still great movie. I get these weird kind of nostalgic chills watching this movie. Not 60s nostalgic, because I wasn't even alive then, but nostalgic for some era in my own life I can never go back to. Almost like I missed out on something. This is the kind of mood I've been in. I'm being pushed in a direction by everybody else I don't want to go in, and yet I have no idea what direction would be better. Watching this movie makes me think about how great a filmmaker George Lucas could have been if he didn't get wrapped up in almost thirty years of star wars.  8. Back to the Future  I saw part III first, but this is the best of the trilogy. I still love all of the repeat stuff they did in part two. You really don't find filmmaking this joyful that often anymore. Ahh, the 1980s.  9. Kill Bill (both parts)  Ok, here's my recent movie. I saw each part five fucking times in the movie theater, so I figured it justified it being on this list. Both parts never got old, either. Great movie.  10. Army of Darkness  Heh heh heh, what a ridiculous concept. I love that this all spawned from a low budget practically student film. Yeah, it's not the best made movie out there, but it certainly is enjoyable.  So there yous have it, another ten movies I like. On a lighter note, Jane convinced me to wear a coral (pinkish) shirt to the wedding on saturday, which was cool. It was much less boring than my grey shirt with grey suit. Anyway, I stopped in lake city to fill up on gas on the way home, when this truck filled with locals starts whistling and saying "hey, look at that fag." Ahh, lake city. Where does the time go?

Nick :   
      Lots of things have been said about my top 10 favorite movie list, as far as almost all of my movies being more recent.  Apparently you're supposed to have some rules to your favorite movies and whatnot, and I'm supposed to include "classics" or something.  Those 10 movies just happen to be the movies I identify with for one reason or another, and movies that have made me feel something and have affected me, and I am into movies like that more than movies that are just entertaining or cinematically interesting.  I tend to think with my heart with movies more.  But I do like classic movies, so here is my list of my top 10 "classic" movies, classic being pre-1980.  I'm sure no one will like this list either.  Nick's Top 10 "Classic" Movie List:  1.   urlLink To Kill A Mockingbird    I adore this movie.  I still get chills when Scout sees Boo Radley behind the door at the end.  When I was in high school my girlfriend at the time made me watch this, and I've loved it ever since.  Not the most profound movie, or the artiest movie, and not really particularly relevant these days, but still a beautiful movie.  2.   urlLink A Boy Named Charlie Brown    I was asked a few years ago which character from Peanuts I would be, and I didn't hesitate to answer "Charlie Brown."  These days I'd still say I identify with Charlie Brown, but I think I lean more towards Linus Van Pelt these days.  I must have seen this movie fifty times since I was little.  I'm a huge fan of Vince Guaraldi's music.  I have a real soft spot for Peanuts, and a lot of the feelings that come across;  it's so bittersweet, and there's the unrequited love, and as I watch classic Peanuts cartoons, and especially this movies, I find myself sighing throughout the entire thing; it's just wonderful, and I *adore* this one.  I identify and feel for this cartoon more than most live action films.   3.   urlLink No Time For Seargents    Fucking hilarious.  A pre-Andy Griffith show Andy Griffith (and Don Knotts as well) plays a complete idiot who joins the army.  I laugh harder at this movie than most.  If I did a top ten favorite comedies this one would definitely be there.  Another movie a lot of people have not heard of.  4.   urlLink Silver Streak    I'm not totally sure, but I think this is the first movie with both Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor.  Very very funny, and also a bit of a thriller.  Gene Wilder falls in love with a girl on the Silver Streak train, and turns out people are out to kill the girl, so he tries to save her.  Richard Pryor plays a theif who tries to help Gene Wilder.  Not as silly at all like some of their later collaborations, but really hilarious, with a bit of action.  5.   urlLink Dog Day Afternoon   I'm surprised at how few people I know who have actually seen this film.  Al Pacino and John Cazale (Michael Corleone and Fredo from the Godfather) hold up a bank, and start a media frenzy.  Based on a true story.  You really actually start to root for the "bad guys" in this movie, and feel really sorry for their pitiful situation.  Funny in parts, sad in others.   6.   urlLink That Obscure Object of Desire    Luis Bunuel's last film.  This one is hard to explain.  Fernando Rey (who was in The French Connection) plays a guy who lusts after a girl named Conchita.  Conchita is played by two very different actresses in the film, apparently to visualize her shifts in mood and personality.  Conchita teases him and leads him on, but he keeps coming back.  Very surreal.  Pretty good "surprise" ending.  7.   urlLink Sleeper    I'm not totally a fan of Woody Allen; I like a lot of his films, and a lot of them I can live without.  But this film is one of Allen's earlier films, which seem to be funnier and sillier than his more recent films.  Very funny, and I have always loved the retro-future stuff.  My dad showed me this movie when I was little, and I did not get it then.   8.   urlLink One Flew Over the Cucko's Nest    This movie probably needs to explanation.  Just a great movie, and very affecting.   9.   urlLink The Black Hole    All sci-fi is cheesy.  (Star Wars is cheesy (I've never liked Star Wars much).  Even Star Trek is cheesy.  2001 is kind of cheesy, but much less so than most sci-fi.) But I love The Black Hole.  And it is cheesy.  But it's still cool.  When I was little, I loved this movie- the bad robots were scary.    10.   urlLink The Odd Couple    This movie was on my other list.  I don't care.  This is a great movie.  I love Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon together.  I love the Grumpy Old Men movies.  I love The Odd Couple II (though it's more Grumpy Old Men than classic Odd Couple).  I have never gotten tired of this movie.  When I can't think of a movie to watch, I go for this movie.    Top 10 lists are difficult.  There are lots of classic movies I love: Taxi Driver, The Shining, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Bad News Bears, Arsenic and Old Lace, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Alice in Wonderland (the Disney version), The Out-of-Towners (the original 1970 version), 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Casablanca, Vertigo, Kiss Me Deadly, The Big Clock, etc. etc. etc.  I look forward to seeing Glenn's list; though he had some classics on his last list.  There are a few entries I would probably change on my first list; I'd most definitely take In the Company of Men off, and as I realize after doing this list, I'd add A Boy Named Charlie Brown.  Actually, I'd be tempted to stick that even in my top 5.  Top 10 lists are hard, and really only the top 5 are pretty solid, the rest really fluctuates.  I do prefer more recent movies to older ones; as stupid as it sounds, I tend to love movies that I feel the most for and that I relate to, ones that go a little beyond entertainment, or something.    That's all for now.  More things to pack up into boxes and bags, more things to throw out.  This time next week I will be moved and living somewhere else.

      Yo yo yo, bowling motherfuckers.  Our scores all stayed pretty consistently low.  The highest score of the night was Jeremy's 117.  I stayed pretty consistent, I probably averaged about 90. (I only broke 100 once.)  We were all pretty bad.  It was good to have Glenn, Ryan, Jeremy, and Matt all together.  A nice little going-away thing.  And we got to see someone carried away on a stretcher.  Good times.

      I finally got something done. I got quite a few things packed and a lot of stuff thrown out.  I also found my  urlLink CQ  DVD, which I thought was long gone, in my trunk.  Now I'm relaxing and doing some around the house type stuff before tonight's bowling.  Went out to lunch with Ryan and Glenn, and ran into an ex, which I was afraid of, but it turned out to be not strange, as I thought it might.  One more week...

      Yo yo yo, you whippersnapper motherfuckers. 60 year old man? Whatever. You'll hit the big 24 soon, and then you'll feel just like I do. Congratulations on quitting and everything. I've only ever quit from one job, service zone, and I didn't really do it in any interesting manner. I wasn't going to post today, since I have two million things to do before I go to work, but a comic book webpage I was trying to read wouldn't work. But now it is working. And I don't have anything interesting to say. Oh, speaking of that gay bar I went to the other night, there were actually a couple of straight girls there (or really goddamned convincing drag queens, but hopefully the former) who were pretty nice and intelligent and flirty. Of course, me and my neuroses didn't actually click with this until I was long gone from the bar, so it didn't matter. They told me if I was a character from friends (which I hate and don't watch and hate) then I would probably be Joey. He's the stupid one, I guess, which I immediately mentioned, so they changed me to Ross, the whiney one. Urgh. I guess I should be happy with any of them, since they can all apparently hook up with Jennifer Anniston. Watch out, Brad Pitt. I'm a-comin for ya. This is the lamest post I've ever done.

      Well, though I'd like to use some of your job-quitting tactics, I'll just be typing up a nice, semi-heartfelt letter of resignation.  Two weeks from this Saturday, I'll be packing up and moving to Naples.  It looks like I'll be staying with my family in their new house for a month or so until I get settled in, get some money saved, and find my own place.  I'll be working at the  urlLink David Lawrence Center , as a Behavior Technician.  I'm not completely sure if I'll be attending school in the fall, or wait until the spring when I'll be more settled in and secure.  I got real lucky, this was the second job I applied for, and the first that I interviewed for, and it is the one I really wanted.  I'm waiting to feel all sentimental about leaving Lake City, but it doesn't seem to be happening.  This is what I've been waiting for.  It looks like I'll be having a couple of "parties," so Glenn, let me know again when you are planning to be in town, so we can all get together.  Maybe go bowling, eat dinner.  Your treat, right? :p    Went to the porch to have a thought, got to the door and again I couldn't stop.

      Well, Glenn's list is pretty impressive, sorta hip (lowercase h : not as hip as I figured), even if it does make him seem like a 60 year old.  Most of them I can agree with, though I hate Singin' in the Rain, and I could barely get through 2001; I could feel myself aging as I tried to sit still and watch the movie (read: boring).  I usually personally rate movies based on how they make me feel, and how I relate to them;  I guess I'm not as interested in cinema as I am feeling and thinking.  Lawrence of Arabia is completely magnificent to watch, but there is not a thing that I can relate to in that film;  Roder Dodger looks like it was just shot by a couple of guys with video cameras following people around, and it probably was, but it rings true with me.  I would also say that my favorite movies are ones I can watch over and over and over; rewatchability.  Between the two of us, we have some taste.  I'm surprised Once Upon a Time in the West and Wrath of Kahn were not in the top ten.  Also surprised that Howard the Duck or Battlefield: Earth didn't make the cut.

Glenn :   
      Hmm. My top ten movie list of all time. Hard to say, really. I usually just leave it at three, but even those have been fluctuating lately. So, let me try and top Nick and all of his 90s movies with a bit of variety. Of course, maybe I'm lying to appear more in the so-called know. Anyway, here it is from 1 to 10, Glenn's top 10 movies of all time.  1. 2001: A Space Oddysey  That's cheating for Nick to make a "guess" that this would be on the list, since he knows for a fact it's my goddamned favorite movie. Some people may think it's boring (Jane), but I think it's just a complete exercise in film craft. Hypnotic, and for me it's impossible to turn away from. And I don't even know if at this point in time any films have really beat it in the special effects department.  2. The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly  Fucking brilliant. This movie destroys the entire concept of westerns. Eli Wallach is my favorite as the Ugly. It's obvious he had the most fun shooting of all of the main characters. Movies don't get much prettier than this.  3. Dawn of the Dead  I love the color in this movie. It just all seems so surreal. None of it is really in shadows, every bit of horror and satire is right up front. True, some of the social commentary is a bit blaring, but I never, ever get bored watching this movie. Kids these days would probably complain because there are a lot of slow parts, and not enough nu metal, but those are the best parts. Like when you don't see zombies for 20 minutes of the movie and you kind of forget what kind of terrible situation they're in. Fantastic.  4. Lawrence of Arabia  Ok, so here's where my list starts to get a bit fuddled. I know for a fact the first three movies are my favorite three movies, but these next seven may be awesome movies which hover around my top twenty of all time. It's so hard to pick, I think. Nevertheless, Lawrence of Arabia is an awesome movie. Once I almost had an opportunity to see this in the theater, but I had to do some other boring shit. Man, I really hope I get the chance to redeem myself for that one. You might say, how could one make the desert look beautiful? Well, watch this movie and find out.  5. Singin' in the Rain  Uh oh. I may have just thrown this one in for variety. This is, however, one of the funniest fucking movies you will ever see in your life. I don't give a good god damn how many times my roommate claims Fred Astaire is better at dancing, Gene Kelley is a better actor, director, and knows how to make a dance scene work. I've always said I'd trade my heterosexuality to be able to dance like this cat. I'll stick to that still, but maybe only because deep down inside I know there's no way I could ever dance like him. Oh well.  6. Jackie Brown  See? See? I have a semi-recent movie up here too. Few other movies make me know characters as well as this movie here. Everything just comes to life for me, and I find the older I get the more solidified this is as Tarantino's best flick. Now, maybe I waver on this whenever the full Kill Bill comes out, but for now this stands.   7. Apocalypse Now  Hm. This is probably higher up than seven on my list, I just didn't think about it first. Like I said, these all shake around. I got the opportunity to see this in the movie theater when it was rereleased, and even though I thought every additional scene sucked scientific balls, this was the most incredible looking movie I have ever seen in my life. The bridge scene in the theater was worth the price of admission alone.  8. Duck Soup  There have never been a more coherent and talented group of comedians as the Marx brothers, and this movie is solid proof. I can watch this movie three times in a row and it never gets less funny. Taxes? I have an uncle who lives in taxes. No, taxes as in dollars. Yeah, that's where he lives. Dollars, taxes.  9. Raging Bull  I couldn't not have Scorsese up here. Then again, I only have one space left, and I have no Spielberg, no Hitchcock, no Lee, no Scott... aaaagh! But this is easily Scorsese's best picture. Less flash than Taxi Driver, but way more know-how. De Niro is flawless in this movie as well. Very depressing. He should have won best director, but instead he was doomed to edit crap for the oscars for all eternity.  10. Revenge of the Nerds  I had to have one "what the fuck" entry up here. But seriously, there is no better movie that exemplifies all of the eighties "geeks fight back" extravaganzas. I wonder, though, if the main girl was supposed to look good naked, because to me she looks more like a fucking skeleton. Eat something, girl.  Oh, man. I missed a bunch. Let me just throw a few other masterpieces out, just to round out my top twenty.  11. Raiders of the Lost Ark 12. Vertigo 13. Blade Runner 14. Once Upon A Time in the West 15. Malcolm X 16. The Godfather 17. Touch of Evil 18. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan 19. Dr. Strangelove 20. American Grafitti  Even that isn't enough. So many movies, so little time. On the lighter side of things, I read a poem at a local poetry night last night that one of my friends hosts. It's held in a gay bar, which was weird at first because whenever I got there this creepy old guy started making eyes at me. Now, I'm not gay, but if I was gay I think I'd be out of that guys league. I mean, come on. I could do much better than that wrinkled old fool. Also, the poem I read has the word "gaytarded" in it (my own concoction), which I don't think went over too well with the crowd. Oh well. Exposure is exposure.

Nick :   
      I'm in a list-making mood, and there has been a lot of conversations I've been in about favorite movies, usually in the form of a top ten.  I have compiled my list.  I'm sure Glenn's list would be more Hip (capital H), and I'm sure I've broken some of the "rules."  And I'm sure I don't have enough "older" or "classic" movies.  So here goes.   Nick's Top Ten Movies    1.  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind    (I don't care if this movie is "new," I have never been as affected by any other movie in my life.  I was completely taken with this movie, and as stupid as it sounds, I have thought about something to do with this movie quite often since I saw it.  It's very possible that it's because of my own very recent personal life; besides the sci-fi memory erasing plot, the movie very closely parallels my own most recent and most serious romantic break-up.)     2.  urlLink Punch-Drunk Love    (Although I probably shouldn't admit this, I relate quite a bit to the Adam Sandler character in this movie.  I've managed to usually act pretty normal and even sometimes very confident and outgoing, but on the inside I've always been extremely awkward and insecure, and I'm usually one inch away from completely stumbling over myself.  Not really a comedy to me; more of a story about a very lonely, sensitive, and socially awkward guy who finds a girl who loves him not only despite his quirks, but maybe even because of them, and this love changes him, makes him stronger and able to finally stand up for himself.)   3.  urlLink Swingers     4.  urlLink Donnie Darko     5.  urlLink Roger Dodger     6.  urlLink The Odd Couple    (I don't know how many times I've seen this movie.  Doesn't really require any explanation.  I have more Oscar in me these days than I used to, but I'm probably leaning more towards Felix.)     7.  urlLink Magnolia    (I couldn't believe this movie when I first saw it.  Even though the movie is more than three hours long and is mostly all talk, I couldn't move for those three hours.  I love the characters in this movie.  I love the ideas of everything being connected, I love the ideas of retribution (except for the Philip Baker Hall character), I love the divine intervention (I knew nothing of this film or the "frog" scene before I saw it, so I was completely blown away).  After the movie was over, I felt a little bit different, like I'd been through something.  That's about the best thing a movie, and any art for that matter, could do.)   8.  urlLink Free Enterprise    When I first let Glenn borrow this movie a few years ago, after he saw it he said "only people like us would like this movie."  What he meant by "people like us," I'm guessing, is "nerds."  I have been a Star Trek fan since I was little (original series, motherfucker!), but as I've gotten older I'm not as into it.  But I do have a shameful amount of knowledge in my brain about the Star Trek universe, and other sci-fi and cult films.  I've had the very same conversations and arguments in real life that are in this film, and I've been in the same romantic situations (though mine never turned out very happily ever after in real life).  And William Shatner is hilarious.  This is basically Swingers for geeks.   9.  urlLink In the Company of Men     10.  urlLink Northfork    There you have it.  Most of these are "newer" movies, as in the past decade.  I can only guess what films are on Glenn's list.  2001?  Once Upon a Time in the West?  Howard the Duck?  Cool Runnings?

Glenn :   
      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn. Tampa bay sucks. Calgary rules. See, I'm no fair-weather fan. Speaking of which, it is raining, and on the way from my chem lab to the computer lab I decided that instead of walking about 10 feet on pavement I would cut across some mud, and just be really careful. Of course I slipped, but only enough to cover about six inches of the bottom of my jeans in mud. Drat. I need to come up with some more poetry club fliers, but I'm blanking right now, plus it's still raining. Once again I have managed to start a post when I don't actually have anything to post about. This friend of mine runs local poetry night here in Tallahassee every Tuesday at Brother's a gay bar. It's not gay poetry night or anything, just anybody who can read. After running the gamut of every other one of my writing friends he has finally managed to ask me to go, although deep down inside I don't want to go. The main reason is that it starts at 11 o'clock, and the crowd is supposed to be harsh, especially on those who aren't gay. Meh, any exposure is good exposure, I guess.  Glenn

      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn, posting without any particular reason yet again, to probably make for a boringtastic blog entry. Anyway, welcs to John Titor, prophet to the new century and all around great guy. Isn't he great? He's great. I saw the new Harry Potter movie, which I enjoyed, although my roommate said it was terrible because they strayed from the book so much. Whatever. I guess I win out because I didn't read any of those books. Glad to see you made it back to the old Lake safe and sound, Nick. Two days of shooting on my new movie have been thwarted by weather. I hope this isn't a recurring thing. I can probably predict that I will be horribly injured by the end of shooting though, as a result of my thinking that I can wrestle, kung-fu fight, and bo staff fight. I can't do any of those things. We beat Megaman 1 last night, the hardest of all megaman games, and least fun. I don't think I'll ever even start it up again, now. What a fucking bitch of a game. I guess I should go and get ready for the stanley cup game, now. My team will probably lose anyway.

      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn. I'm posting when I have nothing to say, so expect boredom. Last time I was in the computer lab I got scientifically drenched, so here's to hoping it won't happen again. Man, today it was blunder of blunders when my cellphone went off during class. I am usually good about turning that thing off, but today I fucked up. Drat. Apparently giant fucking spiders are invading our house. You know, although I don't like spiders on me or appearing suddenly when I don't expect them, I kind of like them. I definitely won't kill them, because of spider karma. I mean, anything that could possibly eat a roach for me isn't all bad. Which is why I like my cat Xerxes. Anyway, I'm boring today.

Glenn :   
      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn, Duke of New York A # 1. Three smiling cents for the person who checks that reference. It has been a boring couple of days. I went to Lake City on Saturday, to converse with my editor on my old movie project and get some equipment for my new movie project. So much wasting of the time. I also picked up a dvd collection of world war II Walt Disney cartoons. Very interesting stuff. The gem in said collection is definitely Der Fuhrer's Face, otherwise known as "Donald Duck in Naziland." He wakes up in Nazi germany and has to work in a munitions factory for Hitler. Of course it's miserable and hilarious, but then he wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. He hugs his little statue of liberty and says "I'm so thankful to be a citizen of the United States of America!" Ahh, nazis. Comic gold! On Sunday, work. Not so good. I don't understand how people can just keep assuming I'm so stupid they have to tell me "Don't put my bread on the bottom." Like what, I'm from some kind of alternate baggers universe where bread can't be crushed by conventional means? Man, I must quit my job a thousand times in my head every time I work. The trick is to have it just right, the quitting. Let me break down the science of it.   1 - You have to do it in a way that is noticeable, but not completely over the top.  You can't just slink into the back, tell the manager you're gone, and then wave good-    bye to everybody on your way out. That's boring. On the other hand, you can't just yell "FUCK EVERYTHING, MOTHERFUCKERS!" at the top of your lungs and jump through a plate glass window. Firstly, that injures you, and secondly, it's very bohemian. You raise your voice to very audible conversation level, and say something like "Check the lot? Check the lot? No, I think instead I'll be checking out, bitch." It plays on words, while it is still insulting to some aspect of management. Which brings me to...   2 - Try to insult somebody who deserves it on your way out.  Keep the deserve it in mind, though. If some old lady says "Could you please double bag that one?" you shouldn't respond with "I'll double bag your coffin when you die in a few weeks, you old hag!" She has lived a while, and any bitterness is probably caused by brain leakage or wrinkle fungus or some other gross old person disease. Instead wait for the forty year old white fuck who says "Wait! Don't put those cans on the bottom, goddamnit! Hurry up! Son of a bitch, why did I get the retard bagger." Then it's fair game to pick any of the following possible responses; a) "Your wife doesn't mind when I line the bottom of your bed with cans, you dumb fuck," b) "Sir, you do realize we carry this tube of asshole cream in extra large, do you not?" or c) "Fuck you, you degenerate half-sunken, monkey-flaying, shitsmoke-dragging, cerebellum-gaping fuckasaurus." That last one can basically be any chain of slightly creative profanities. Make sure that this is not a person who could kick your ass before you say any of these choices. If they can, go with the more simple "Bag the shit your motherfuckin self; I quit," or just "Fuck this, I'm outta here." The colorful expletives are important because that helps you secure your non-returning to the job. Otherwise you may inadvertantly leave your door open and be back as soon as you need some cash. This is how prostitutes get trapped.   3 - Check the time of your exit.  Don't quit when you only have one minute left. That's retarded. Just finish that shift out and go out with a bang the next time you work. Also, don't quit just after you've done some horrible and degrading piece of work, like cleaning fucking shit off the walls of the bathroom. Do it before you do that, so you don't have to do it. Duh.   4 - Be cool.  Don't just say I quit, and don't just get yourself fired. Have some ready responses to your boss' possible prompts. Example:                  Boss - "Glenn, some dumb brat kid puked all over aisle 8. Clean it up."                 Glenn - "Fuck no, bitch."                Boss - "Excuse me? What did you say?"                Glenn - "I said get a hearing aid. Clean that nasty shit up yourself, because I ain't the bitch of Publix central anymore. I'm out."   Now, that example does not appear to have a whole lot of wit buried within, but it gets the job done. It's funny and unflinching, and it pushes the boundary to getting fired level, but doesn't let the boss get the firing in before the quitting enters. Simple, but somewhat perfect.   5 - Have no regrets.  Your job sucks. No bones about it. Almost everybody's job sucks, except for my friend Todd who gets to sit on his ass and drink wine all day. That job rules. Also, comic book writer is a good job, and so is fortune heir. But those aren't your jobs and your job sucks. So whenever you reach your boiling point and initiate the quitting sequence, don't turn back. Don't apologize and don't look back to your place as anything other than some massive building made of dog shit filled with pieces of dog shit with dog shit for brains. Quit and smile. You'll get another job. In fact, whenever you pick up your last paycheck walk in with a big smile on your face so all those poor dumb fucks who still shop or work at that hellhole know you had the brains to pull off the escape. And knock something over so somebody has to clean it up. That's also cool.  So, faithful readers, bear these thoughts in mind. And just change all of the grocery crap to whatever your job has. Anyway, I'm out for now. Peace to the east.

Glenn :   
      Yo yo yo, this is a banner fucking day in the weblog, when I post twice in a row with out Nick to buffer things out with a little bit of sense. Not that I have anything entirely interesting to say, but I'll post some rambledambles. I saw the Bourne Supremacy last night. Apparently the first movie didn't stick with me that much, because I really didn't care about any of the characters in this one, as they didn't build any of them back up. Really boring. Plus there was the preview for a new great movie coming out called "Paparazzi." The plot is this actor gets really rich and famous, and then the paparazzi start hanging out all the time and taking his picture. Well you know what? He has had enough, and decides to take matters into his own hands. I say it's about time the actors struck back. How long have we, the public, been giving them so much shit and millions of dollars, and they have just been silent? Yeah, we deserve it. Not that I agree with paparazzi, but give me a break. It's like the actors all just decided to get together and hatch a way to get the public on their side. Well, I'm not going to feel sorry for these whiny millionaires. This is a movie? I've seen better film on teeth, to quote Get Shorty. It's produced by Mel "Bloody Jesus" Gibson. Nice follow up, jackass. Michael Moore was on O'Reilly the other night. It was hilarious. Like a couple of brat kids just screaming their sound bites at each other.   I was with a friend who got pulled over yesterday by campus cops. What a bunch of cowboy assaholics. First off he took 15 minutes running my friends license, since I guess he got stuck with the old car with the telegraph machine inside, and then he told my friend the reason he was pulled over was because he had a brake light out, and gave him an $80 ticket. When we checked later it was one of the little side lights. Agh! Why won't cops ever  help  me out? They always just cause problems. Anyway, enough negativity for one night. Peace to the East.

Glenn :   
      Yo yo yo. I am so far behind on this crap. I don't have the internet at all anymore. That really throws a kink into everything. I have no idea what I'd do if I couldn't just pop over to FSU and use a computer lab. If things go my way and I'm not in class in the fall I won't be able to do even that. Shudder. I've finally moved into my new, clean, maggot-less, carpeted place. It's so nice. I actually cooked myself dinner the other day rather than just stare disgusted at a mess of a kitchen. It's really a design flaw to have the main door lead into the kitchen anyway, I think. Mud gets in there, and flies spontaneously generate, and bees and roaches-- gross.&nbsp; Now my kitchen is off to the side. No disgustingness. I'm so happy.   I really used to like Dennis Miller, but recently he just seems to be some kind of right-wing voxbox. He just yells on his show how it's ridiculous to think that if America is the strongest country in the world we still need to listen to what the rest of the world thinks. Well, I say you can't bully people, or eventually they're just going to hit back. I mean, the concept may seem ridiculous, but there could be a EU USA conflict at some point in the future. I also don't like the uberpatriotism that really took hold after 9-11. The kind where liberals have to qualify every thing they say that may be against the administration. This so-called "United we stand" mentality is extreme to the point of massive excess. If you have a different opinion that Bush, you are against America and may as well sign up with the terrorists. The right-wing has really forced the left into a corner in which they can only meekly make suggestions while prefacing everything with "Now, I love America," or "America is the greatest country in the world," like somehow what they say negates that fact. It's really shrewd politicking. &nbsp;I'm not American, but you know what? I love America, and it is the greatest country in the world, but Bush and crew have done&nbsp;too many&nbsp;messed up things and it's time we mended what wounds we have with other nations and lead by example, not force. Sorry to get all political in this blog. That's more of a Jane Blah thing, I guess.   I've now gotten to the point where my extreme fear of roaches is ridiculous. When I was cleaning out the old apartment the other day there was this huge dead roach in the tub, but I refused to go near it, out of the fear that it may suddenly come back to life just to run along my arm and say "Hiya, pally!" I swear, they know I hate them and just come to hang out on purpose. I'll go to friends' houses and hang out, and then there will suddenly be a roach near me when they haven't seen one for months. I have always been a fan of comic books, and deep down inside always wanted a superpower. Only now in my mid twenties do I realize my superpower is the ability to attract roaches. Hooray. I'm the Disgusting Roach-Man. Look out crime.

Glenn :   
      Yo yo yo, it's me, the internetless random poster. I have nothing of interest to say right now, so if your name is Jane and you complain about such things you may as well stop reading right now. I just wanted to post something so that people wouldn't think this is a solo act. I mean, who else would be the Laurel to Nick's Hardy? The Keaton to Nick's Chaplin? The Yin to Nick's way too Yang? Well, Spider-Man 2 is very awesome, and I'll have to recommend it to everybody right off the bat. Conversely, Dodgeball sucks really hard. Seriously, somebody got paid WGA minimum $35,000 to write this script at the very least. That's ridiculous! I could have written this standing on my head. Hell, I could have written this with somebody else standing on my head. What an awful piece of shit. I'm sorry, Nick, but your boy Vince Vaughn has a stigma on his hands that he will be hard pressed to wash off. On the bright side I paid nothing for it, so I'm not too mad.  I don't get people who take their minimum wage jobs so seriously. Take for example, say... Publix. Terrible job! Nobody in their right mind would want to stay there, right? And nobody in their right mind would definitely care about procedure or any other stupid crap, right? Well, the other day, bogged down by homework and studying I decided to call in to work. I'm not the president. I'm not the ER doctor. I'm a fucking bagger. So the manager sighs, pauses, and then, legitimately angry, says "Man, this is the second time you've done this." True, I called in 5 months ago, but it is the second or fifth time I've called in, but then he says "You called in last week, too." I say he is mistaken, after which point he grumbles and says goodbye. I didn't call in last week, but if I did, who cares? It's a damn grocery store. It's a stupid job. I'm not working my way up the corporate ladder. Urgh. The story didn't exactly go all of the places I wanted it to, but that's sometimes ok.  My roommate has left, and once again I am scared of ghosts and murderers. I was certain by the time I was in my mid twenties this fear would have subsided, but not so. Now, don't get me wrong, I would like to see a ghost, but I would prefer a notice via mail explaining exactly when, where, and how I will see said ghost. Tuesday, the 23rd, 8pm. They will not look fucked up, rotten, spooky, or ghastly in anyway, will enter through the west wall and exit through the east, and there will be no children's laughter, music, or anything else twisted, and definitely no eye contact. Simple. Oh well. I've probably told that to everybody who reads this blog anyway.

      All those things I planned to get done today...I did *nothing.*  I didn't even get up until eleven.  I got nothing done.  No apartment hunting.  No cleaning.  No laundry.  No grocery shopping.  Nothing.   So I have nothing to blog about.  Goodnight.

      Tomorrow is my only day off.  Next weekend I will have three days off in a row.  I don't know what I will do with myself.  Right now I have no life, so work is becoming my life.  If I were completely trained, I'd even volunteer to work tomorrow.  After next week I'll be pretty much considered trained, or trained enough.  There is a week of training that new employees have to have, but it won't happen until the middle of next month.  Next week I work the evening shift, so I'll get a shift differential.  After next week I can work some overtime, which pays time and a half, which I plan to take advantage of.  I need all the money I can get.  I'm still doing some apartment hunting, and I have a few prospects.  It all depends on what I've got to have up front.  I've got to get my own place.  If I have to, I'll wait another month to get some money saved.  But I'd prefer to be out by the beginning of next month.  Tomorrow is my only day off, so I'm going to call some places.  I know all of this is really boring.  Work today was pretty nice.  I got to take the kids who earned at least 80% of their goal points during the week to a rec room where we watched a movie.  So I got to sit through Spy Kids, which I had never seen, and will be perfectly happy if I never see it again.  I probably could have dozed off, if not for my boss sitting next to me on the couch snoring loudly.  We played some kickball as well.  That's always fun, especially when the kids get competitive.  It's still a little surprising to me (and admittedly somewhat amusing) to hear children yell "Fuck you" at each other; I suppose I'll get desensitized to it eventually.  Tonight I put on Mallrats, which I had never seen, and I fell asleep about midway through.  What I did see was not great.  That's all I've got for today.

      I guess everyone is too busy to post lately.  I haven't really had the time or reliable internet access.  I've started looking around for apartments here in Naples.  I was planning on staying where I'm living now until the end of August, but I'm not sure I can do that.  I'd really like to have my own place.  There are some pretty decent sounding places in Golden Gate, which is the area of Naples where I work.  I'm going to check a few places out; it all depends on what kind of money I can get together.  Work has been going well.  So far it's been glorified babysitting.  I haven't been able to participate in group sessions yet or really get to know the kids and get into their heads.  I really like the job so far, and I'm sure I'll like it more when I no longer feel so new and overwhelmed.  Tomorrow will finish my first week of work and my second week living in Naples.  Not much else to write.

      Today was my first day at work.  I'm sure I could think of a lot of things to say, but I'm completely exhausted.  I plan on being in bed within the next hour.  I will say that I really love the place and the people I will be working with, and I like the work so far.  I had become so used to sleeping in and staying up late that I didn't go to bed as early as I should have, and was up quite early.  Add that fact to the three hours of paperwork I had to go through this morning and then the overwhelming training this afternoon, and I'm fucking pooped.  I'll post more in the next day or two.

      The comments are back!  You all can now continue to not comment.  Today I was asked an interesting question: If I had a Theme Song, what would it be?  I'm guessing Theme Song as in, a song that would represent me as a person and my personality.  I take music very seriously.  I usually don't just listen to music as just entertainment.  My roommate used to say some stupid thing about good music speaking to your soul or something, and though I wouldn't put it in such cheesy terms, I agree with that sentiment.  My favorite songs make me feel a certain way, a specific way, and the best songs (just like the best movies) give me chills and make me feel incredible things.  I don't really have a favorite song, and I don't really have a favorite band or artist, although if I were pressed, I will usually say Stereolab is my favorite band, based on the fact that I have listened to them for years, since junior high, through all the changes and phases.  But a Theme Song would be hard to choose.  Not just a song that I like or that makes me feel something, or whatever.  A song that says something about me in the best way.  In high school psychology class, one class project was that each student had to turn in a tape or a CD and pick one song to be played to the class, and the class had to guess which student had picked which song.  Most of the class, of course, picked the generic music that was popular at the time, the class guessed mine right away, since I had different tastes.  I'm not sure what the point of that project was.  It's going to take some thought to pick a Theme Song, but I'm going to try.  I'm sure you'd have an interesting Theme Song.  My first week living in Naples is over, and I just have to say, I really love it here.  I was a little worried about being homesick (not very homesick at all), or being broke (I  am  broke), or being intimidated (only a little intimidated), or whatever.  But I love being here, more than I thought I would.  It's definitely been worth it all to move here.  I'm really excited to be starting work, doing what I've really wanted to do, and I'll be excited to start school here.  I like to get to go swimming whenever I want, I like laying around the house with Chud and Samson (my cousin's cat and chocolate lab, both of which I've started to grow attached to), I like going to the pier, I like just driving around, I like hanging out at the used record store, I even like going to the Coastland Center Mall.  I usually hate malls, possibly because of the sorry "mall" back in Lake City.  I'm happier than I thought I'd be.  Sorry to be so positive here, I hate to break the trend of negativity.  There are things I dislike here, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.  I finally escaped Lake City.  "We Built This City" by Starship is the #1 worst song according to VH1.  I'm on board with that.

      Happy 4th.  Today I slept in, went swimming and laid by the pool, had a cookout with my family here, drove through town and saw some fireworks, and now I'm watching VH1's 50 worst songs ever I think it's called.  Hope everyone has had a good and safe day.  I keep having Lake City dreams at night.  A few nights ago I dreamt about dozens of people that I haven't seen since high school.  I haven't seen these people or thought about them in more than five years.  I was just surrounded by these people, hanging out with them, and then playing sports with them.  Dozens of people.  What the hell?  And then last night I dreamt about being in Lake City, just going around town or something, and again seeing people I haven't seen and really should have completely forgotten about.  When I woke up, it took me a minute to realize that I'm not in Lake City anymore.  I don't exactly know why I would have these dreams.  I certainly don't miss Lake City, and I haven't thought about some of these people in several years.   Oh wow, Crash Test Dummies "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm," that is a terrible song.  I commented a while back that I wasn't crazy about the Soderbergh version of Solaris.  I picked it up at the used record store for very cheap (and it was brand new, not used!), and watched it again.  Now I have to change my opinion and saw that it is quite good.  Maybe it's because I had only seen it once.  Maybe also because I recently finally saw the original Russian version, and skimmed the Stanislaw Lem book that both films were based on.  The Lem book is very spread out and the Russian film, I think, tried to tackle as much of the book and as many of the themes as it could, while I think Soderbergh pretty much picked one thing and went with it.  I think he picked the strongest theme of the book and the original film, and it really is outstanding.  This is another film that most people I know dislike, possibly because it is so slow moving, I don't know.  I hate it when people claim that the reason that someone didn't like a movie is because "they didn't understand it."  How snobby.  Though, truly, a lot of times that may be the case.  Anyways, this film asks some of the same questions as Vanilla Sky, about memory and reality and whatnot.  But the George Cloony character comes to a different decision in the end than that of the Tom Cruise character.  Tom Cruise chose to wake up from his dream reality and live a real life, which in the past was what I would have most agreed with, where the George Clooney character chose to go into the Solaris planet and live a dream in order to be with his deceased wife (and by the way, Solaris is much better than Vanilla Sky, and the way Solaris shows Clooney's characters decision is much much better).  Really, why is the decision to live in a dream a bad decision?  Why would a "real reality" be better?  Wouldn't a dream reality be just as real?  Would you rather live in the Matrix, or live in the sewers.  What's the difference?  The Matrix is just as real.  By the way, I hate the Matrix.  Maybe I would choose to go into the Solaris planet.  What would you choose, Glenn?    I now have 50 horrible songs stuck in my head, courtsey of VH1.

      Having very little to do this past week as I wait for next week, and my first days of work, to arrive, I think I've watched more television in one week than I have in the past year.  I've become particularly interested in watching Celebrity Poker Showdown.  Along with Court TV and all these investigation shows.  I have made it out to the pool and Naples pier, which is fantastic.  I also saw Farenheit 9/11 a second time, going with my very Republican Aunt and Uncle, which was amusing.  And I agree that Michael Moore is very slanted, and as he says, much of the movie is his opinion, and it is propaganda, and it is at times very heavy-handed, but there are still facts there.  Facts that can't be ignored.  The propaganda is pretty entertaining in itself, but beyond that are actual proven facts.  The movie hopefully will encourage people to do some actual research for themselves.  And as a bumper sticker I saw recently says, "let's not vote for W again in 2004."  I enjoyed your list, Glenn.  And for the most part I can agree with it.  I don't have the ambitions you have, though.  I'd like enough money to be comfortable, but having been here in Naples, which is half a pretty normal town, but the other half is very wealthy.  And wealth seems to equal snobbery, at least as much as I have encountered.  Of course, I'm having to work towards something, and I imagine that earning wealth by working hard as opposed to just being handed down wealth probably builds better character.  But I don't think I'd ever want to be wealthy.  I'd like to have enough to be secure, as you said, in paying my bills and being able to swing an emergency if that were to happen.  One home is enough for me.  I don't have the same motivations to compile such a list, but just for fun, here is mine:  1. Companionship:  As in a female companion.  I've been called "quirky-alone," though I'm not sure how much I agree with that label, but I am comfortable being alone, and I am "holding out" for that "special someone."  I don't want to ever end up with someone out of desperation or just because it's what people do.  But I seriously have hope and believe that I will one day meet that special someone.  I am really a hopeless romantic, and one day I'll get to put that to use.  2. Career:  I want to have a career, not a job.  I want to do something that I really want to do, regardless of what anyone else thinks I should do, and regardless of money.  I want to do something fulfilling.  I'm about to start work in the field that I am most interested in, so maybe this will be the start of what I am hoping for.  3. Financial security:  I can't imagine ever just wanting to be "wealthy."  But I want to be secure.  I want to know that my bills will be paid.  I want to know that I have some money in the bank in case of emergency.  I want to be able to afford some luxuries, which for someone like myself is not much at all.  As I've moved here, I have put myself in the position of being very low on money, really almost completely broke.  I've always lived paycheck to paycheck, as I'm sure you have, Glenn.  I hope to one day be a little more secure, one day soon, hopefully.  4. Circle of friends:  As cheesy as that sounds, friends are important.  I've been fortunate enough to have a few really great friends, ones that I always look forward to talking to and seeing.  Unfortunately, I've just left them five hours away.  I know nobody here in Naples, besides my family, but as time goes on I'll make new friends.  And now I want to play poker.  So I can only think of four right off the top of my head.  I'm not really in much of an existential crisis right now.  I am a little nervous about starting this new job.  For some reason, it feels a little like it used to feel right before a new year of school started when I was in high school.  Strange.  I went out and bought a shitload of clothes, basically half a whole wardrobe.  I've found a few spots locally to hang out.  And I picked up an amazing Antonio Carlos Jobim CD that I have listened to completely non-stop all week, for $5 at the local used CD store.  And I plan to see Spider Man 2 Monday.  So I guess that's all to report for now.  Back to Celebrity Poker Showdown.

      It's a little after 9 in the AM, and I got home from work just a short while ago.  I'm pulling midnite shifts all this month.  I've been up for something like 26 hours.  Yesterday I worked until 4PM and then had to be back at midnite.  Being that I'm not used to being up all night and sleeping during the day, I couldn't sleep yesterday afternoon.  I ended up watching Futurama all evening.  Now I'm exhausted, but I don't want to sleep, it's a nice day out and I feel like I should be up.  I'm sure I'll get used to being up all night.  This is only for a month.  Plus the shift differential is nice.  But it's playing tricks on my body.  I'm tired, yet I want to stay awake.  And I didn't eat dinner until after midnite, so it's obviously got my digestion out of whack, as I now have a slight case of the sqirting ass-gremlins.  It's obviously messing with my judgement too, as evidenced by what I just posted.  Good to see Glenn is poting on here, what an effort.  I think I should get to bed now befoe I starrt makeng tieping mifstakes.
