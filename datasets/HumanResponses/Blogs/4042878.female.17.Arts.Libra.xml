      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other day I was driving with my boyfriend to play put-put golf. I was thinking in my head "Ya know, I have not seen (ex-boyfriend) Ryan in a long time, even just driving around like I used to." Then, BOOM I see him. Literally&nbsp;two seconds after that thought ran through my head. I saw him and this rush of "oh my god" ran through my head. It really startled me. I soon got over it, but it all keeps running through my mind how strange that was.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than that, something also very creepy happened.... I was at work, normal day and all and my first love (Mike) waltzes in. Creepy shit. I said "Aloha!" all stupid and stuff and immediately turned around and went to the back. My face had turned bright red! So, I tried to chill my self out and kept working. I wanted to ring him up for his sandwich, maybe catch up a little but this other girl already had. Before I knew it he was saying "Nice to see you Ashley" and was gone. The rest of the day I was again, very surprised. I hope he comes in again, now that he knows where I work so we can talk a little. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer is almost over and I've done jack shit. All I've done this summer is work and party. I've saved   NO   money, which was my goal. My car needs to be fixed badly, which is going to cost me around $500-$600. I've saved $15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really nervous to start my senior year. I'm not going to graduate on time, that's for sure. I kind of knew that all along. I've got to call my counselor very very soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   CALL YOUR AGENT!!!!!!!!   Tell him you're saving up money for pictures. ASAP!!!!!! I really would like to start working, even if it's just hair shows: that's $175 insantly! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember: Pete owes me $100 dollars for my phone. Gotta get that!!! I'll get a nicer one.  Ok, I'm goin....

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever woken up crying?   Dreams.... weird little movies our mind creates all for it's own pleasure. Some people claim they don't dream. I don't believe any of them. How can one not dream? I understand if you passout drunk, but even then that is when I have my craziest, most frequent dreams.   My dreams always have something in common. For example, it could be very similar dreams for about a week. Then,&nbsp;everything will change and the next week I'm fucking someone new. Possible someone I don't even know.&nbsp; What's weird is that it is VERY hard to lucid dream. Lucid dreaming is where in your dream, you KNOW you're dreaming. I have yet to accomplish this but it will be marvelous when it happens. How come when we do dream we believe everything. We don't stop and say, this is impossible. It could never happen!! When one says that in a dream, they begin to lucid dream. Maybe I'm just too lazy. Yeah, that's it.   My dreams always make me think. They're kind of nice too. I get to see people I haven't seen in a while. Like old boyfriends or girlfriends. That's always nice. What's weird is that I always dream about these two ex-boyfriends. The two guys that I mentioned in my first blog, Ryan and Mike. All week I've dreamed about them without even trying (nor wanting) to.   Alright, enough of&nbsp;the unexplainable (although I can never get enough of it). My dream is to be very successful in whatever I do.&nbsp; What I want to do it ACT. Act professionally. I want to be able to pay my bills with money I earn from acting. This is a very hard thing to come by. I have many goals to accomplish this, hence it being my ultimate goal. I plan on bartending all the while taking acting classes, working out, studying on my own, living out of a teeny, tiny really expensive apartment. Maybe in Chicago at first, then move on to New York or Los Angelos. I think to start Chicago will be good. Not as expensive as N.Y and L.A., but big enough to feel broke and helpless as hell. I want to jump out of my skin and into the lives of characters. REALLY LEARN about myself AND acting. I want to portray myself as a professional. I want to make mistakes and learn from them. I want to go to auditions everyday, read scripts everyday, get rejected a LOT. Maybe even get a job once in a while. Struggling Actor. That is what I will be... until I am a Successful Actor. Every star there is today was once a Struggling Actor. (Unless they were born with parents that were already famous, or already had money... that helps very much so!)&nbsp;   I will be 18 in... let's see...2 months. At that time I will become a certified bartender. I will try and try and try to get a job bartending. Hopefully raking in the big bucks doin that. Then I MUST save.   SAVE SAVE SAVE   my money. I'll need to save for  acting classes  (possible a small community college),&nbsp; a car, an apartment, gym membership,&nbsp; ect.     Shit, I'm peacin....
