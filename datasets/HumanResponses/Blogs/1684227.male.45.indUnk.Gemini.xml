      Well ... I guess somebody's reading my blog! Betcha didn't know I had that much pull with the Bush Administration, eh what?  Hmmmm ... what shall I demand next? I know; let's give former Yugoslavia Most Favored Nation status.  I'll see what I can do.

       Retirement For A Legend!  So,  urlLink Anna Kournikova may retire?  You mean she had a sports career?   26-Year Reunion? Huh?  Had a 26-year class reunion this past weekend. Yeah, I know ... 26th??  Well ... we  tried  to have a 25-year reunion last fall, but the deadbeats in my class didn't sign up, so it had to be canceled. Out of 307 graduating students, with about 295 still alive, only 16 signed up. Pathetic. Guess they heard  I  might be there.  So last fall, about seven of us met at  urlLink Cobblestones  for a mini-reunion, mostly because  urlLink Miles  flew in from California. You see, he had already booked his flight when they canceled the reunion. Poor guy ... but he's a Liberal, so who cares *grin*. You know Liberals ... they love being  victims  of something -- anything. *big smile*  So Jed Strausbaugh, just a regular guy, put together a 26-year "off year" picnic reunion. Well, about 30 classmates signed up, and about 45 people total (spouses and girlfriends, that's the difference) showed up. It was fantastic. The small size meant you could really talk to people instead of just idle chit-chat. The picnic format was nice. Also, we didn't have music, which meant you could actually talk instead of yelling "HUH?" all night.  I'd recommend this format.   Cigars  I started smoking cigars on August 19, 2002 -- almost a year ago. In that short time I've become quite the  urlLink aficionado.  Premium cigars, mind you. The textures, the flavors, the shapes and sizes ... it's the flaming equivalent of fine wine (another hobby). Cigars are the ultimate reward, the status symbol that screams  I Am Successful!  ... and they're just plain good. I buy them  urlLink online  in boxes or bundles, and one at a time at Self Serve Beverage in York.  Send any and all premium cigars to me; I'll appreciate it. Did I mention that I was a mooch?    urlLink Fewer Air Marshalls   Great ... just great. This is Homeland Security?

      Okay, I'll stray into the political arena a bit here, but this opinion is something I've been carrying around for many, many years.  Consumerism is killing this country. It's nearly a foundational problem; that is, it's almost the root of all our ills (hey! Didn't someone once say "... for the love of money is the root of all evil"?). Let me give some examples and some insight.  You buy a house. You get a mortage. Let's say the mortage is $140,000 (my house -- four bedrooms, two baths, two-car garage, fireplace, pool). You pay about $800 a month for 30 years. That's $288,000. Sick, eh?  Why do we do it?  Because that's just they way we do it here in America . It's downright  stupid!   Better idea: Graduate school, get a job. Live with parents for four years, and save $1,000 a month. In four years, you have $50,000. Buy a simple house for cash. Save four more, move up.  No debt. Get it? In eight years, you have nearly the house you'd pay $288,000 for over 30 years.  Six years into it all, you get laid off. Guess what ... you can take a minimum wage job and still get by. Why? Because you're not saddled with a huge mortgage.  What happens in the grand scheme of things? More people are paying cash. More people can pursue their  passions  instead of the Almight Dollar. More people are happy. Families are stronger. Couples fight a lot less about money. Layoffs are seen as a nusance instead of a horrible, life-altering experience.  Okay, so maybe I haven't fleshed this all out yet ... but you see the trap we've fallen into? It's not just "get out of debt"; no, it's more "don't go into debt in the first place".  The older I get (dumb saying, really -- I mean ... what am I gonna say, "the younger I get"?), the more I realize that Modern America is built on a sick idea of money money money instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

       urlLink The Harry Schenck Memorial Eagle Scout Project  is done.  I was only able to work for about three hours on Saturday morning, before heading to my 26th class reunion. Twenty-sixth? Yeah ... more about that later.   urlLink Harry  was my nephew, and about as fine a young man as you would ever meet. I guy that loved life, and loved people, and had that infectious sort of grin, and air of joy that permeated everyone around him. He and his dad were like this (fingers crossed). I can't imagine losing a child like that ... I just can't.  But the project is incredible. The pictures don't do it justice; in particular, the pictures can't capture the workday on Saturday. People everywhere, doing everything needed. Reminds one of an Amish barn raising. It was beautiful beyond words.  My dad, The World's Greatest Engineer (retired), designed everything, right down to all the drilling and assembly jigs. Patrick remarked that my dad did an unbelievable job; "This thing went together like Legos".  Harry, we miss you. We know that this past weekend's work effort is what you would want.

      I love the music by Cake. I mean, if I had to listen to one group the rest of my life, it'd be The Academy of St. Martin-In-The-Field, but Cake would be next. Cake's bouncy, sing-along, hip and "up" sounds just lift my spirits every time. And their lyrics are great, to wit:  I am intrinsically no good I have a heart that's made of wood I am only biding time Only reciting memorized lines And i'm not fit to touch The hem of your garment   Good stuff.

      Just too much to do. Wow. Work is incredible; I have over 80 projects in front of me. Granted, some are one-hour projects ... but it's still overwhelming when you try to take it all in.  Divide and conquer, that's what I do ... divide and conquer.  It's tough to keep up to the day-to-day workload and at the same time attempt to prepare a strategic three-year plan for our I.T. department (I'm a CIO).  Meanwhile, the work piles up at home. The garage shelves ... gardening ... landscaping ... painting ... working on my car (God I hope my wife lets me get the GTI -- I haven't asked her yet, but she likes the mantra "No More Classics", so signs aren't good).  On top of that, my high school 26-year reunion is Saturday. That's right, 26 years. Nobody -- bunch of deadbeats -- wanted to attend the 25-year reunion. Poor Miles, flew all the way in from California and we had to have a tiny meeting (seven of us?) at a local sports bar. Enjoyed it ... but it was lacking something. Oh,  I know ... people.  Been in e-mail contact with Rich Shambaugh. He's in California now, big shot producer or something, and probably won't get back to York for a while.  He probably has ... Too Much To Do.

      Coming soon to a big city near you: Congestion Area Fees!  That's right -- you will be charged to drive through a known congestion area. They have this in  urlLink London , and it's so "successful" (Translation: "It brings in so much money") that New York and some other large cities in the United States are eyeing it. It  will  happen.  Just what we need; more Big Brother, more surveillance, more of the government reaching into our wallets.

      My desk at work is a disaster. Stuff everywhere. I need to get organized. Funny, I'm normally an extremely organized guy at work.  Likewise, my garage is full of projects to finish, foremost the shelving I'm building. And there's that living room wall that needs painted. Gonna have to borrow Bruce's 30-foot ladder to reach that high part above the steps down to the family room.  Ever feel out of control? I certainly do. And stressed. Terribly stressed.  I need a vacation, but can't take one. Just cannot. You know what that means, don't you:  Time to hit the gym tonight.

      So yesterday I'm driving to work, wearing one of my better Eddie Bauer dress shirts. I'm two miles from the office, got a good cigar going, sunroof open (Saab 900!),  urlLink WXPN  on the radio (world's greatest station), when all of a sudden my travel mug decides to become a dribble cup. ARGH ... coffee on my good shirt.  Get to work and grab a new  urlLink company logo golf shirt . Not too bad ... I'm wearing the company colors (I'm the CIO there), makin' it look good. But the coffee stains on my good shirt. ARGH.  So this morning will be better, right? I mean ... gotta be.  Roll out at 6:10 -- rats, it's late -- and head to the kitchen. OUCH! My legs are so sore from Tuesday nights killer squats. Get to the kitchen and assemble our  urlLink way cool coffee maker . It's bangin' ... dump in the water, dump in the beans, and go. It grinds and brews.  Up to the bathroom and quick shower. Get dressed -- hey, the pants are a little looser and the shirts getting filled out a bit better ... the weights are paying off! -- and head down for some   coffee! ALL OVER THE FLOOR!   Uh ... yeah ... listen ... next time, you're gonna have to put the thermos mug thingie actually  into  the coffee maker ... yeah.  Rats! Coffee all over the countertop and on the rug (an aside: I'll never complain about that rug to my wife again -- it soaked up the coffee Real Well).  So instead of coffee for the household, I'm out on the desk hosing off the rug.  Mister Coffee. Yeah. Right.

      I'm barely walking today ... killer squat routine last night. But that's a  good  kind of sore.  There's nothing like hitting the gym (it's in my house) and busting my 44-year old butt to the point where I'm huffing, feel like I'm gonna puke, sweating like a whore in a church, and can barely walk. Then suck down a protein-rich shake and watch the muscles g-r-o-w.  Pumping iron ranks right up there with surfing as far as being relaxing and, yet, invigorating. Warming up is like paddling out ... getting pumped is like catching a wave ... and breaking through a plateau is like mastering a cutback.  I keep threatening to get into fly fishing ... seems very blissful and all that ... but I keep coming back to anything that makes me feel like a dish towel that's been wrung out and left hanging on the little hooks inside the cabinet door under the sink, right in front of the trash can. I often wonder what I'll do when I'm too old to be active. Probably shuffleboard.  For now, it's Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Repeat. Put down the Big Mac Meal -- "Supersize it, please" -- and give it a try.

      WARNING: You tailgate me when I'm driving, and I may slam on my brakes. I just might! Don't tempt me, moron.  I will  not  speed up for you, got that? Unless you're willing to pay my speeding ticket and my increase in insurance premium. Back off. If you'd get your lazy ass out of bed a bit earlier, you sloth, then perhaps you wouldn't need to fly along at 75 in a 65 zone. I'll drive 60 if I want to. You tailgate me, and I'll slow down until my speed matches the "distance calculation" -- one car length per 10 miles per hour. So if you're four car lengths behind me, I'm going 40 ... got it?  You're the jerk, not me. You want to speed, pass me! Oh ... wait ... you don't want to get a ticket?   Neither do I,  sped!

      Those words ... sheesh. As I sit and wait for Blogger to create my blog, I'm warned.  Do not close your browser or click anything!  Whoa ... I wonder what would happen if I did? Would I disappear? Would I be arrested by the he-clicked-something Police? Would I be transported to another universe, where the virtual homeless sleep on tagless mattresses and push around unused virtual shopping carts?  I didn't click. But I wish I had. "Wet Paint" syndrome, I guess.

      Is there any better music than Israel Kamakawiwo'ole?  So my bride might have a detached retina. Not only is this scary, but it really riles me, because I'm sure it was from the accident ... the one where the drunk woman crashed into my wife's car, pushing it 120 feet, resulting in a bad back, a short-circuited career as a chef (she had just finished culinary school five days earlier) and a very, very low settlement from the insurance company. Yes, we had a lawyer, and no, we don't think he fought hard enough.  So the radiator went on my Saab. It has a tiny hole, easily identified, but Craig (my friend who owns an auto parts store) talked me into getting a new radiator. Get it this evening, and I'll install it then. No biggee.  I really, really want a sports car. I miss the Spyder, and have constant second thoughts about selling it. Oh well ... *sigh*. Patti says we can get a new Thunderbird after the Rendezvous is paid off. I dunno ... I love the styling of the Thunderbird, but it's not a five- or six-speed, it's an automatic. Yuck.  Honda S2000. Yeah. Or Nissan 350Z Roadster.  What sports car do  you  suggest? Email me and let me know.  Isn't internet radio about the greatest thing about the "information highway"? No commercials, gotta love that.  Speaking of which ... you go to the movies and you sit through commercials now! What the ...?? I love watching previews of coming attractions (because, no matter how stinky the movies -- think Gigli -- the best parts will at least be in the trailer), but sitting through and ad for Pepsi? Come on.  Oh oh oh ... and is anyone else glad to see that Pepsi finally stopped using that annoying little brat girl in their commercials? No, not Britney Spears ... that little 11-year old punk girl. Oh MAN I HATED those ads. ARGH!  I ordered 100 handmade premium cigars yesterday from J. R. Cigars! They'll be here by Wednesday I'm thinking. Woo-hoo! Last night I had some red wine and a cheap (but handmade) cigar and it was fantastic. What a great way to celebrate life. Patti and I were waiting for the chicken to finish on the grill (Patti is the world's greatest chef, hands down no question eat your heart out Emeril and I'm so spoiled) and wiled the time away watching the spiders by our pond. They build webs over the water and catch gnats (yay!). It's fascinating!  www.Mele.com. Check it out.  Gotta run. More later.

      So, the British have found a  urlLink way to keep miscreants out  of their country. Hmmmm ... perhaps we could sure up our own borders by applying this idea. I can see it now ...  "Yes, I want to come into your country. I want to come here to meet with others of my mind-set to pursue our agenda."  "Whoa there towel-head ... first you gotta answer some questions to prove you an honest-ta-goodness Fine American, or at least you've searched the internet uh-nuff to figure dis here stuff out."  "Yes, sure."  "Okay ... lemme see ... hmmmm ... oh! ... I got one! Which state is about to elect a totally ass-kicking, RE-PUB-LICK-IN, Fine, Conservative, REAL AMERICAN, bodybuildin', cigar-smokin', movie-makin' Austrian as their gov'ner?"  "Ummm ... California?!"  "Hmmm ... that's pretty good there, camel-jockey. Now ... hmmm ... okay okay ... here's one: Who's prettier ... Shania Twain or Faith Hill?"  "What?"  "Ha! Okay okay trick question ... just testin' ya. There's no wrong answer there, if'n ya know what uh mean *wink*".  "Uh ... okay ..."  "Okay ... final question before I let anyone darker than Bill Gates past our border. Ready?"  "Yes I'm ready."  "Okay ... hmmm ... let's see ... nothin' more American than baseball ... so ... okay okay I got one: Name five starting players for the Detroit Tigers!"  "What? WHAT!?"  "Ah-HA! I knowed you was one of them there terra-rists! No can do, no passie, understand? Back to the desert for your! By the way, what's yer name there dress-wearin' guy?"  " urlLink Yusuf Islam  ... and that's MY song they're playin' on the Muzak, jerkface!"   Okay, so maybe it's not such a great idea.

      Some of you are really dumb. I mean like "sucker born every minute" stupid. To wit:  Seen the ... man, I can't even find an adjective strong enough ... seen the REALLY, REALLY STUPID ads (they make me so angry I could spit nails!) for Nextel's push-to-talk feature (they call it "Direct Connect". What? ... and another phone is somehow indirect? What, you call Joe and ask him to talk to Sally for you? Give me a break!)? I cannot explain how ANGRY I get when those ads come on TV.  "Sheesh Don ... back off. It's only a TV ad, for cryin' out loud. Get over it."  Oh yeah? Well it insults my intelligence to no end. If that's not the most insulting commercial you ever saw, then you just don't "get it", do you.  Let me break it down for you: George Lopez needs to use him BMW, but his daughter has it, right? So he calls her cell and there's no answer. Poor George, should have used Nextel's Direct Connect feature, because when he does, she answers right away and "I'll be home in 10 minutes".  The difference between driving a BMW and a 60's-style VW Beetle (never mind which one *I* would rather drive).  Right?  Sheesh. You believe that and you're a moron. A total doofus. A Send-Your-Money-To-Benny-Hinn idiot.  Tell me, bright eyes, what's the difference between the "call her cell phone" scenario and the Direct Connect one? Is it the quickness of Direct Connect?  The difference is: in the first scenario she doesn't have her phone turned on; in the second, she does. That's it. THAT IS IT! That's ALL it is. Has NOTHING to do with Direct Connect, it has to do with keeping you frickin' phone turned on and available. Sheesh. DUH!  Let's go back and turn off his daughter's phone. Now, Georgie Boy tries to Direct Connect, and nothing happens. Oh ... oh ... wassa matter George, cat got your tongue? Can't connect? Wish she had a Cingular phone and had it turned on? Oh ... oh ... where's your Direct Connect now, VW-boy?  And the kicker is: Direct Connect is a GREAT feature in an environment where you need to make frequent connections, such as the campus of a large corporation, or even over to the warehouse in a smaller company (such as where I am CIO). In that environment, Direct Connect rules. But to get ahold of your daughter to get your BMW back? Come on, bonehead, don't kid me; I'm not that stupid. Maybe Miranda is, but I'm not. :-)  COME ON PEOPLE, wise up! Don't be so stupid.

      Well ... I was gonna name names ... but then I got to thinking (I do that ocassionally): if I  don't  name names, I can write anything I want and don't have to worry about it. Kinda like working for the New York Times.  Let me start by saying I use the word "friends" loosely. I don't have any enemies -- all my friends hate me.  Okay, I'll name names. Let's start with ... hmmmm ... "Rich".  Rich has been my friend since 1975. Yep ...  that  long. He's a wirey little guy, about three years my junior, and about two inches shorter than I am. Imagine that ...  shorter  that I am! Why, Rich would be turned away at a carnival ride ... in Japan.  He's also a very complex kind of person. His politics are all over the place, although his constant, annoying, tiring, over-the-top rant is "anti-government". No, he won't  vote , no, that would require too much effort I guess ... but he'll complain to no end. I mean NO end. Rich, you're my best friend, and I love you like a brother, but it's getting old already. Just do like the rest of us and take your money and run.  And run he does. All over the frickin' place. The guy has the world by the short hairs, if'n ya know what ah mean. He's self-employed; cuts grass and does handyman work. Lives below the poverty level, too, yet spends about three weeks on vacation in Florida every winter (he lives in Maryland). How does he do it?  In 1987, I helped him build a log cabin back up a logging trail in the mountains outside of a small Maryland town. Solar electric, spring-fed water supply, pretty much self-sufficient (except for food. Sheesh ... "except for food" ... is that like saying "except for AIR"?). Everything he owns he owns. Everything's paid off, even the tractor he bought (it caught on fire, too, while he was on -- yep, you guessed it --  another  vacation in the Boston area recently). He even goes Dumpster Diving in the winter. Don't laugh ... you'd be amazed at what supermarkets throw out. Perfectly good stuff. One bottle of ketchup breaks and gets the other bottles in the crate messy, and they just toss the whole crate. That's a sin, but to him it's a windfall.  "Hey honey! There's a run on Oodles Of Noodles down at the Food Lion! Get the flashlight and let's get next week's groceries!"  Don't get me wrong; he's a great guy. Super. Can fix just about anything, and isn't afraid of anyone. He'll speak his mind no matter where or when. I've seen him get up and walk out of a church service because the pastor or someone else up there was being a jerk. He just does not care what people think. Really. We all like to  say  that about ourselves, but he really doesn't care (my father's the same way ... and my son pretty much, too. I *think* I'm there, too. That doesn't bother you, does it?).  Married 20 years, he's seen a lot and done a lot. He's one of those people who enjoy life. I wish I could get him to smoke cigars, but he's too busy drinking beer and cheap wine. Oh ... and griping about the government.  All the time.

      We all (I guess "all") complain about something from time to time. There's usually something that gets under our skin, or worse.  Personally, complaining and whining are two of my favorite hobbies. If I ain't complaining about something, I ain't happy. I think I got that from my grandmother (she was too cool).  But how often do we stop and think about the Good Things ... the things we can't get too much off? Not often enough, methinks (Hey! That was an infinite loop -- can't get too much thinking about the things we can't get too much of!).  Here are some things I can't get too much off:     God's Grace. THANK GOD for God's Grace! Whew ... makes me want to "take a lap" (Sorry ... that's the old Baptist coming out in me)   My children   Sunsets   Sitting outside on a cool, clear evening and watching satellites   Wine   Cigars! Oh yeah ... cigars!

      Think I'll just ramble a bit today.   A Boost For My Fragile Male Ego  Got an email today from a female -- former classmate (that's  class mate!) -- and it started "You are a total hottie!". Yeah! ... that'll make this old wannabe feel good! Take  that , Ann Van Roden! I haven't been complimented by a woman like that since ... well ... ever?   Lightning!  Had a lightning storm on Wednesday morning, about 3 a.m. The most incredible display of lightning I've ever witnessed. Being a true geek and obsessive-compulsive counter, I kept track: we averaged one lightning strike every two seconds over a period of 20 minutes! That's right ... over 600 lightning flashes! Never saw anything like it! Amazing! I love exclamation points! I really do!  (sorry)  Hey Miles, I bet you miss lightning, huh? That's okay, I miss earthquakes, so we're even (ha! ... what a trade. Don't tell Miles, he's kinda slow that way).   I'll Be In Vegas  I'm making a personal appearance at Las Vegas in February (that was cool; I wrote that like I'm a celebrity or something. Wow ... talk about stroking your ego!). I'll be there February 11-16. If you want to meet up and have dinner and some cigars (or just dinner), email me. I'm sure "my people" can arrange something.  (Wow ... my ego's  almost  big enough to support a run for Governor of California)   California  Giving Florida a run for the money in the "Most Goofed Up State" contest, are ya? Sheesh. What a circus, that recall. Next thing you know, the Left Coast will be banning indoor smoking and permitting marijuana.  Uh ... wait.   And About That Hemp ...  Hemp is illegal to grow in this *cough* free *cough* country of our's right? Yeah ... now  that's  a good idea ... yeah. Can't have a product that is longer-lasting than cotton, less expensive, warmer than wool,  not  able to get you high if you smoke it ... nope ... better not let that happen. Who is the  Total Moron  that is in charge of this idea and law? I want to kick his ass.  By the way, why is alcohol legal and marijuana illegal? Another moron who deserves to have their ass kicked.  My son and I have it all figured out: The government wants enough drugs to make you feel  better  (aspirin, asthma medication, Prozac, Viagra, etc etc), but not enough to make you feel  too  good (marijuana, LSD, etc).  Makes me want to scream! And drink some wine! And smoke a cigar! And toss around some more exclamation points!  !!!!!

       urlLink This  is just  wrong!  I don't think you should change 2,000 years of history and religion to fit the whims of society. Isn't religion supposed to be the bedrock? I mean ... if it was a sin 1,500 years ago, do you think God changed His mind?  Or did we correct 2,000 years of misunderstanding? Was He "okay" with homosexuality all this time, and we finally got it right?  E-mail your comments to me.

      They connected the phone in my office this morning. Rats ... two months of solitude broken by loud pages over the intercom. Can I turn this thing off? I can always unplug it! :-)  Rich bought an old tractor ... a Ferguson (that's even  before  they became  urlLink Massey-Ferguson ) from the 1950's. Apparently it runs good. He also bought a bushhog, and he'll use the combo to make money cutting fields and stuff like that. He can also use the front-end loader when building his new house.  Funny, he being all excited about a tractor. A sign of old age? I'm still stinging over the loss of my  urlLink Spyder . I  will  have a sports car again.  Are  urlLink Consuegra's  great or what? Wow ... I can't get over how good they are. And affordable. A double Espresso of a cigar, if you will.  I want a small snowblower. Just a simple, small one.  I had a dream last night that Kobe was found guilty. You heard it hear first.  Finally, went to see  urlLink Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life  on Friday night. Yeah, it's hokey ... but I like the action and intrique. Besides ... Angelina Jolie? Wow. :-)

      I'm pretty much a political conservative, at least on most issues. I've got this weird idea about individual liberty, personal responsibility, goofy stuff like that. You know the type: the kind of person who, for example, thinks that  illegal  aliens should be treated as ... oh ... I dunno ... illegal aliens? You know, deny them a driver's license, stuff like that.  But I can be liberal on some issues. For example, I'm in favor of Affirmative Action. Oh yeah ... you gotta email me on that one.  I guess you could say I'm a moving target! Ha ha ... makes it hard for you to pin me down, eh? You little runt. Go ahead and try - I'm smarter than you!  *grin*  So given that, it's either no surprise or a huge surprise that I'm against the California recall election. Surprised?  Folks, it's a bad idea for many reasons. Yeah, Gray Davis isn't doing a very good job, but that's why he lost last year's election ... oh ... wait ... he  won  that election! Silly me ... and here I thought Californian's didn't want the guy.  The Governorship isn't a defect bicycle pump that you can return, people. It's an elected office, a  part  of the government of California. Oh yeah ... a part ... not the entire thing. Don't you good folks out there on the Left Coast have, say, a Legislature? Any Judicial Branch of your State? Yeah?  Oh ... I see ... you just want to toss Davis because it's nice to have a scapegoat, eh?  Let's break it down: YOU ELECTED THE GUY, FAIR AND SQUARE. DEAL WITH IT! Jonah Goldberg, a Conservative columnist, has a take on this. Check it out  urlLink here .  Is this what we want? Do we *really* want to toss a guy out of office for poor performance? We can put up with a President who was impeached for lying under oath -- issues of character, integrity and honesty -- but can't tolerate a guy who botches taxes?  Granted, I know about Davis' "pay for play" politics. Sheesh ... you'd think he was a politician.  Oh ... wait ... he  is . At least for another two weeks.

      Here's a little experiment for all you capital-L Liberals out there: Try blaming yourself just once. Just one time. I know it won't be easy ... it'll probably hurt your fragile ego ... but give it a try for, say a month. Or a year. Or better yet -- a lifetime.  So next time you don't get your way, or something goes wrong (like, say, losing your job), how about you look inward? Lose your job and can't pay your bills? Well perhaps you shouldn't have gotten so deeply in debt.  (Disclaimer: If I were to lose my job I'd lose everything. But I'd blame myself, so there.)  Aren't you fed up with the "blame someone else" mentality that is ruining our country? You know; Maurice Clarett gets caught lying, and all of a sudden Jim Brown is blaming Ohio State? Say what?  You know what's happening? People are becoming basically sissies. Oh oh ... you don't have air conditioning? Suck it up; your grandparents didn't. Sheesh.  The one that gets me is the big flap about obese kids. Oh yeah, it's a problem, no doubt. Perhaps you should encourage junior to get off his lazy rear and actually  do  something. Go biking ... hiking ... swimming ... skateboarding. No ... wait ... skateboarding is frickin' illegal in Red Lion, Pennsylvania! Can you believe that?  "Our little pissant town is not as nice because of ... uh ... the skateboarders, yeah!"  Give me a break.  Anyhow ... don't blame McDonalds; blame yourself for feeding them that crap while you were too busy to cook. Get off your fat duff and grow a garden; you only need a small area, so don't give me any excuses.  I'm just so sick and tired of everyone blaming everyone else for their problems. Buck up and face the music, you mental midget. Don't be a wuss all your life.  And how is it that at age 44 I can still do 25 pushups ... one-handed, that is. You mean ... you mean ... you mean I actually take care of myself? You mean  you  can complain about my cigars (you fat, lazy, whining sack of blubber) but you can't keep up with me in the gym? How can that be? Could it be ... COULD IT BE? ... that I take care of myself, while you are too busy looking for someone else to blame for your miserable condition?  Thyroid problem my foot. Get out there and Play Outside.  Blame yourself; it's refreshing. And it'll make lawyers get a  real  job.

      Just some stuff I feel like tossing out there ... memes, I guess.  (HA HA ... now you gotta google "Memes" to see what it means ... ha ha ... yet more evidence of my superior intellect and overall coolness)  The Rolling Stones rule. Frickin' RULE. Your favorite group? ... they're the roadies for the Stones.  I remember about six or seven years ago, my children were telling me that Oasis was supposed to be The Next Big Think, like the Second Coming of the Beatles.  Hmmm ... Oasis ... don't they make dehumidifiers?  My Spyder's not fast enough. I need a turbo. Not gonna happen -- it's called "priorities" -- but I'd love a turbo. A seven-second 0-60 time might have been fast in 1980, but not now. A turbo would put "Anna" (the car's name; my wife named her, after Anna Kournikova *smile*) in the 4.4 second range for 0-60 ... that's Ferrari territory, pal! A $25,000 supercar!  Penn State versus the Pittsburgh Steelers. They'd both find a way to lose. *frown*  The Yankees? Oh yeah ... them ... they lost to my Marlins!!  *BIG GRIN*  Had some carpal tunnel problems last week, so I took what Steve Crump insisted works like a charm: vitamin B Complex. Guess what ... works wonders! Pain gone the same day ... amazing!  Remember that group, the three brothers, Hanson? They had that infectious "Mmm-bop" song (which I love because of a story I'll relate later). Well ... these guys are incredibly talented.  No ... wait ... hear me out.  They've reinvented themselves as an acoustic/folk group, and they're really, really, really great! I'm dead serious; check out  urlLink their website  and listen to some clips. I'm buying that CD today, it's THAT good.  I heard them on the greatest radio station God ever invented --  urlLink WXPN  -- and I'm amazed. Hats off to them.  Another good Hanson is Beck ... Beck Hanson. Love that music. And Phish. And The White Stripes, especially their song "7 Nation Army". And I'll aways enjoy old stuff by J. Geils Band. I have fond memories of riding with my brother in his Pinto, heading to Otter Creek, listening to J. Geils Band on the 8 Track.  (To this day, I *love* the styling of the Pinto)  Had some veggies leftover from last weekend's "The Light Of Don's Life Got Married" party, and my wife -- trained as a chef and incredible with food! -- made some out-of-this-world homemade (what else?) broccoli and cheddar soup last night. Enjoyed it with some organic bread. Wow ... what a great life.  Oh oh oh ... but BEFORE that, I had to work a little late (until 6:20, big woop) and while talking on the speaker phone with our software vendor who was installing and upgrade and showing me around (thank you Microsoft for Net Meeting) via remote desktop, I enjoyed a  urlLink Camacho . Uber-great.  I've been getting up at 5:00 or so and making it to work plenty early (my commute is one hour, or "one robusto cigar" in the Saab *smile*). Been rather nice, but then again I'm heading to bed at 9:30.  I missed the Aurora Borealis last night! ARGH! I'll hope for it again tonight.  Okay, why do I like the song "Mmm-Bop"? I went to Dubai in 1997 (with another guy, Van) on a bidness trip to install some software. Long flight to a strange place. Middle East. Muslim. Definitely NOT York.  (NOTE: I LOVED the place, absolutely loved it. The people were fantastic and wonderful. You want world peace? ... make everyone travel to other cultures. You *cannot* travel to foreign lands and remain racist/nationalist/wacko -- with a few notable exceptions)  So we get there -- did I mention it was 115 degree during the day and 95 at night? NINETY-FIVE DEGREES at night? Anyhow, we get there and are immediately immersed into a foreign culture. Looking for something to remind us of home.  We get into a cab, and what song is playing? It will forever have a lasting connection to that moment, and for that reason will always be a "good song" to me.  Finally, thank you LeBron James for getting Kobe out of the headlines.

      So a Lands' End catalog ends up on my desk -- I'm the CIO of a company -- a catalog out of which businesses can order logoed items to give away.  What does it say on the front? "Merry Business To All!".  ARGH! ... not surprised ... but ...  this  is what Christmas has come down to? A blatant ploy to improve business?  Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. I mean ... you sort of *expect* it from the retailers ... but now it's a Business-To-Business thing (B2B ... what a buzzword).  Next thing you know, they'll try to associate bunny rabbits and colored eggs with the resurrection of Christ.  Oh ... wait ...  Thanksgiving is about my favorite holiday; it's not been hijacked by the money-grubbing retailers and stupid follow-me-over-a-cliff "consumers" of this world. It's still a good holiday, and a truly religious occasion: A chance to thank God for His blessings.  You don't believe in God? That's  your  problem. Convenient, too; no God, no judgment -- "Hey! ... I can act like I want and never have to give account for it!" ... yeah ... you better pray -- oops --  hope  you're right!   LAWSUIT  Someone will sue someone for giving out Peanut M&M's this halloween, mark my words. Peanut allergies, "they didn't warn my son", etc etc. I'm just waiting for it to happen.

      (You can tell I went to school to be a Baptist preacher, with my three C's alliteration there)  While driving to work in my Spyder (!!!) this morning, I saw a Chevy Cavalier. You can't get a Cavalier with a six-cylinder motor any more. Why? Probably because of CAFE -- Corporate Average Fuel Economy laws.   urlLink CAFE  laws were started in 1975 in an effort to use less oil and reduce pollution. It works okay, although the standard -- 27.5 mpg -- hasn't been raised since 1986 as the automakers have been lobbying hard to keep it from being raised.  Score one for Big Oil, Big Money and line-my-pockets politicians. They win ... we lose.  As automakers sell more and more gas-guzzling cars (disclaimer: I own a 24-mpg Buick Rendezvous), the "only way" to meet CAFE standards is to sell more and more fuel-efficient vehicles. In some cases, the small cars are sold with little or no profit just in order to get them out the door; the Corvette sales make up the profits and, at the same time, pull the corporate average fuel economy down down down. Takes a couple of Cavaliers to make up for one 'Vette.  (I'd use SUVs in the above paragraph, but SUV's are considered 'light trucks' and fall under a less stringent standard. Surprised? No?)  The CAFE standard needs to be raised. I'd say 30 for 2005, and then up up up until it reaches 50 mpg in, say, 20 years.  "Fifty miles per gallon? Are you nuts, Don? That's impossible."  Yeah ... impossible ... right. Loser.  The problem isn't technology, the problem is getting people to think of solutions that require a different CONTEXT!  ("I was wonderin' when he was going to bring 'context' into this lame diatribe against society of his")  You see, you need to think outside of the current context in order to arrive at forward-thinking solutions. You can't limit your thinking to our current society if you expect to change and improve it. And trust me; it needs to change to improve.  For example, the  urlLink Hypercar  forces you to consider a change in context, as does the idea of H2 cars in general (H2 ... hydrogen ... ya remember chem class? ... sheesh). One argument against H2 is that there's no infrastructure. Yeah ... there's not *now* ... but that will change. Change ... a new context ... you catching on yet?  So another change would be lighter -- much lighter -- vehicles. Safer to boot.  "What's that? Safer? You've got to be kidding, Don. I don't want to be driving a 1,000-pound SUV and get into a collision with another SUV."  Listen, doofus ... go learn about Kinetic Energy, will ya? Dummie.  So a huge change in context (if I were a buzzword idiot I'd say "paradigm shift" and "outside the box", but I'm not in California so I won't do that) will be needed.  Can you picture it? No? Then get lost, will ya ... you're hindering the rest of us.  Community?  Yeah ... imagine a huge shift in context ... working closer to home or even at home ... wider sidewalks ... areas where cars are banned in favor of walking, cycling, Segway-ing. You could walk or bike to the store, the barber shop, to coffee shop. Less driving, more people out and about ... recreational drugs legalized to reduce crime (thought I'd toss that in there so you hyper-conservatives could have a conniption fit) ... get to know your neighbors ... COMMUNITY!  It can happen. And, contrary to the ranting antics of hyper Right-Wingers who'd rather O.D. on pain killers than admit their mistakes, it will be driven -- or at least started -- by more government involvement and regulation.  Get over it, and never forget: it's not "them" in Washington.  We  are the government, and we get the laws we deserve and ask for.

      In January of 2002, my income dropped by 40 percent. Yeah ... *you* try it.  To meet my "shifting paradigm", I sold my  urlLink Spyder  (scroll down, you'll see it). It was a Rock Star car; everyone looked at you. And for an attention-seeking narcissist such as I, it was the perfect "accessory".  So on January 26, 2002, at 11:30 am, I sold My Precious to Hanover Toyota. A rough time for me.  I was finally able, emotionally, to put that behind me this past spring. When it was nice and I wanted a drive, I had my Saab. Granted, not a convertible, and not quite as fast and fun, but fun nonetheless.  Expensive to keep repaired, but fun.  Last week, while driving past the dealer, guess what I saw on their lot?  Checked the VIN ... yup ... my old Spyder. Only 6,000 miles added to her odometer.  Long story short: I stopped, we talked, I get it tonight (Tuesday). Certified Used Car, too, which means a 6-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.  Vroom! I'm BACK!!!

      What more can I ask for?  I'll answer that: Nothing.  This weekend my daughter is getting married to the most wonderful young man you could imagine. You could not hand-pick a finer young man. He's about the only guy good enough for my little girl.  I cannot describe how happy I am about this. I know I'll miss her, but it's all a father could hope for.  You can bet some GOOD cigars will be enjoyed on this occasion!

      Saturday morning I awoke to a cold rain outside. The cold front was moving in and putting down even more rain on our already-soaked ground. But I was determined; I would not be denied.  You see, the wifey was away, and this was my chance, my opportunity, my clear path to ...  ... kayaking on the river!  After cooking myself a great breakfast burrito (Two eggs, cheddar cheese, chile peppers, onions, taco sauce in a huge tortilla -- I'm a   urlLink metrosexual , I can cook!), I loaded the  urlLink soft rack kayak carrier  onto my Saab. My  urlLink Perception Acadia 12.5  was next, strapped down and ready to go. Picked out a change of clothing -- just in case -- and a few cigars, and headed down to Long Level by the Susquehanna River. I parked across from Shank's Mare and put it. By then, the rain had ceased its taunting, and the wind was answering with a shout of waves. Looking around, I noticed that the motor boaters were ... absent. Ah yes ... 50 degrees, threat of rain, some wind, some waves ... perfect for keeping those noisy, dangerous ne'er-do-wells away from *my* morning.  Unloading the Saab, my heart was racing. Finally, after many months of my kayak begging me from its loft in the garage, it was our time. Donning my pfd, then my  urlLink Mountain Hardware vest , then covering with my CRL windbreaker, I tested my whistle before putting in.  The feeling of freedom that comes when you move out from the shore is something that cannot be explained, only experienced. The cares of the world stay ashore when you kayak. The only elements are you, the boat and the water. Well, the wind quickly becomes a concern, too :-).  I paddled straight out about 1/8 mile to get my "sea legs" and to assess the situation. Okay ... wind from the south, current moving toward the south, waves from the south. Got it.  Dipped my hand into the water ... good ... it's warmer than the air. The "adds up to 100" safety rule was passed (the air temp and the water temp should add up to 100 in order to avoid hypothermia).  I turned back toward shore and then headed north toward the creek. Probably 3/4 mile away, it would be a quick but lively trip. As I began to move out, I tried to keep up with the wind and waves, but couldn't. Rising up on a wave was great -- a push from behind -- but then you slide down the back of the wave. Still, with the wind at my back, paddling seemed rather easy.  And quiet. No phones (I did have my cell phone in my waterproof bag, again, just in case), no keyboards, no dog, no one else. Finally ... the solitude I need but never seem to get. Ahhhh ...  The debris along the shore from Isabel was noticeable, but not bad. Some logs, but not much else.  I reached the creek, crossed under the road, and cruised into the crystal clear stillness of the creek. Just like that, the waves and wind were gone, and I was greeted with a calmness that belies the day. Paddling slowly upstream, trying to conserve some energy for the rough trip back against the wind, I observed vacation homes made empty by Autumn's chill. Gone are the weekend rousers ... the backyard grills ... the noisy boat. The summer's frivolity were gone, replaced by falling leaves and long, uncut lawns.  I paddled until I reached the eddies, where the kayak's four-inch draft began to touch bottom. It was then that I saw a blue heron -- one of my favorites, along with the red-wing blackbird -- fishing in the cool waters. *This* is what makes life worth living. You cannot, CANNOT, kayak and be depressed.  Turning around, I let the slow current lift my kayak and my spirits even higher. Floating now, with the occasional correction for steering, I watched tens of thousands of minnows scurrying along the bottom, waiting their turn at maturity and their chance to play against Spring's anglers.  Crossing under the overpass, I mentally braced myself for the onslaught of the wind. I conservatively figured it would take an hour to cover that final 3/4 mile back to my car, given the wind.  What a pleasant surprise! The wind, to be sure, was still blowing, but the current was pushing me as it was fighting a winning battle agains the wind. The elements were grappling, and I was feeling the victory.  Bouyed by the current, I began paddling with enthusiasm and vigor. This was too good to miss. The waves would sometimes break over the bow of the kayak, the spray hitting me, and the moment was  robust  and filled with life! It was as though this moment had been set aside to encourage me, to challenge me, to lift my spirits and carry me. And indeed it did.  Arriving at the car, I was giddy and "pumped". The adrenalin rush was the drug of choice and I was overdosing. God I LOVE this!  Loaded up the car and then did what anyone would have done: Coffee and an  urlLink El Rey Del Mundo Originale .  Sometime's life is good, sometime's it's bad. But on this day, this moment, it was  perfect .  Thank you, God, for those moments.

      Wife doesn't have a detached retina. That's good news.  Remember the bad radiator on my Saab (blog entry, August 26, 2003)? I said "no biggee", didn't I? What a fool!  The short story is this: While replacing the radiator, I punctured the air conditioner condensor. ARGH! So my "do it yourself" repair to save, say, $100, will end up costing me $200 for a new condensor. That's it, I'm not working on cars again, ever. Ever.  I thought I had Patti talked into getting me a new car. She said "we can look at one while we pick up my Buick" -- it was in for service. Well ... pssshhh ... yeah ... we  looked  at one ... yeah. Lot of good that did. She won't budge on the 2003 Focus SVT (competition orange with the European Appearance Package). Black leather interior, moonroof, six speed manual, hi output engine ... so sweet ... so not mine. :-(  Saw "The Rundown" starring "the Rock", that rassler-turned-actor. One of the more entertaining movies I've ever seen. The operative word is "entertaining", okay, so don't bug me when you figure out that it's not Gone With The Wind or Glitter (Miles loved Glitter ... figures).  My daughter gets married in eight days. Wow.  Work is overbearing. Just too much to do. Seriously too much. I need to figure out a way to hide from everyone so I can get some work done.  The wife's away tonight, and I got paid today ... woo-hoo! Can you say "cigar bar after work"? ... I knew that you could. Then, home to watch some playoff baseball and kayaking  early  on Saturday morning. Then back to reality: cut the grass, fix stuff ...  You know, owning a home is 80 percent work.  Got the garage straightened up last weekend, put stuff on the shelves. Now, two cars can fit in it ... imagine that. Perfect space for a Toyota MR2 Spyder! Hear that, Patti!! I should just bring one home; what's she gonna do?  "YORK MAN FOUND DEAD, RUN OVER BY SPYDER"  Hmmm ... nooo ... better not.  Finally; since Patti got a part-time job, I cook two nights a week. I'm becoming quite the chef, I tell ya. Many people have said I'm the gay-est straight guy they know!  Gotta run; my hair's messed.

      On the right side of this screen (Over here, stupid --->) you'll see a link to Miles' totally boring blog. I went to high school while Miles (although I'll never know how  he  ever graduated). After that, I showed my superior intellect by getting my first job (janitor) while he obviously needed more education and got a Masters Degree in some silly Chemical Engineering or something, I dunno.  Point is, Miles recently misrepresented me -- he's a typical don't-bother-me-with-the-facts Liberal -- and I want to clear it up.  I *do* like the Push-To-Talk feature of cell phones. It's great. As I so eloquently stated in a previous blog entry (August 21, 2003), it's not the feature itself I don't like ... it's the stupid, insult-your-intelligence ads (this assumes you actually  have  some intelligence, so I'll give you "American Idol" fans a pass). And the feature works best in an environment where you need frequent point-to-point conversations, similar to a walkie-talkie.  I mean ... really ... your kid needs Push-To-Talk to call you from Penn State on Sunday morning to ask "what do you do about a hangover?" (the answer, of course, is two words: Bloody Mary).  Come on, Miles ... I expect better from you! You're the best skateboarder I know and your sisters are hot. But you gotta work on your fact-checking before getting into a pissing contest with me. Remember; I'm the Stupid Conservative, you're the Elitist Liberal.  Finally, I'm ending my love affair with exclamation points (they're just too much). However, I'm quite fond of paratheses (they're great for interjecting comments, ya know?)!

Let me break it down for all you NASCAR fans; Nessie doesn't exist. UFO's are  not  from "outer space" or anything weird like that. Ghosts are caused by gases and radiation and magnetism and  urlLink sounds  and some unknown gravity-related phenomena and fantasies of the human mind. There's no Bigfoot. Folks, X-Files was fiction, okay?  Get real. Quit reading  urlLink Weekly World News  (Hey, Elvis is dead, OKAY?), quit listening to country music, quit watching "floor it and turn left" NASCAR [You want auto racing?

      It's true, much to my chagrin. And here, all along, I thought I was a dyed-in-the-SUV capital "C" Conservative. I mean ... I try ... I try. I like guns. I hate paying taxes. Heck, I used to act like I hated cats just to be Conservative. Now,  urlLink this Political Compass quiz  goes and ruins me.  I scored a 1.25 on the Economic Left/Right scale -- slightly economically conservative, and a spot-on ZERO on the Libertarian/Authoritarian scale. Call me boring; worse, call me Joe Lieberman Junior.  I was so bummed about this. How can I rant against Liberals (who I'm still convinced are the biggest bunch of wussies around) when I'm not even a Conservative (who traded their IQ points for increased testosterone).  Then, it hit me! I'm in the middle; I can complain about  both  sides! YEE-HAW ... what a windfall! I can slam Liberals for being weak on defense; or, just being weak (you don't generally find Liberals by the squat rack at the gym). I can slam Conservatives for thinking that everyone who has any kind of problem is weak, without character, or just not working hard enough (you don't generally find Conservatives working at soup kitchens). I can drive my SUV while wearing my Birkenstocks!  Sweet nectar of life! I'm in the perfect position to rant, whine and criticize!  Join me in the middle, won't you? The world could use more like me! *big grin*

      Attributed to Bill Gates (I doubt it), but nonetheless good stuff:  Rule 1:  Life is not fair—get used to it.   Rule 2:  The world won’t care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something before you feel good about yourself.   Rule 3:  You will not make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of school. You won’t be a vice president with a car phone until you earn both.   Rule 4:  If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.   Rule 5:  Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping—they called it opportunity.   Rule 6:  If you mess up, it’s not your parent’s fault, so don’t whine about your mistakes, learn from them.   Rule 7:  Before you were born, your parents weren’t as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parent’s generation, try delousing the closets in your own room.   Rule 8:  Your school may have done away with winners and losers but life has not. In some schools they’ll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn’t bear the slightest resemblance to anything in real life.   Rule 9:  Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off, and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time.   Rule 10:  Television is not real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.   Rule 11:  Be nice to nerds. Chances are you’ll end up working for one.

      We went to Target the other day, which we affectionately refer to as "The 100-Dollar Club", because we can never seem to get out of that place under $100. For example, we go for paper towels and come home with new patio furniture. I love the store, but it's killing me.  So we first stop by Customer (non-) Service, where we need to exchange, of all things, resealable sandwich bags which didn't, in fact, re-seal. Imagine how I felt when I discovered that the zip lock tops didn't zip, nor lock, after picking up Penny's poop (our dog; got her name because she's the same color as my  urlLink Pittsburgh Penguins  cap). I had to carry an unsealed bag of dog poop home from the schoolyard.  (Pittsburgh. P-I-T-T-S-B-U-R-G-H ... there's an "H" on the end. Penguin. P-E-N-G-U-I-N ... that's a gee, not a queue)  So while we're waiting our turn to complete our $1.58 transaction, the moron ... excuse me ... woman in front of us is causing a scene because "this software won't run on our computer and I want to return it".  Well, as you probably know, returning software is up there with removing sofa tags and skateboarding on the "OH MY GOD YOU WANT TO DO WHAT?" list. I mean ... RETURN SOFTWARE? ARE YOU CRAZY?!! You may have loaded it and are now returning it to rip us off!  Actually, in this instance, I have to side with Target. She was Just Plain STOOPID. Hear me out.  The guy behind the counter points out that the licensing agreement prohibits returning software. Further, it's on the box, with the system requirements. That's when she get's frustrated and says "But some of aren't computer literate; I have no idea what my computer has!".  Uh ... excuse me ... HELLO? YOU ARE TOTALLY STUPID! You DON'T KNOW what your computer is, yet you go and buy software for it? Does anyone else see how totally assinine this is?  "Uh ... yeah ... I'd like a new transmission for my car. What kind? Dunno ... just give me one ..."  Sheesh. If you're THAT computer illiterate -- and there's NOTHING WRONG with being computer illiterate -- then for the Love Of God please DO NOT go shopping without help! SHEESH!  Sorry lady, but YOU have to take some responsibility for the things you own and buy.  ARGH!!! ... probably a Clinton-voting soccer mom dumbo-crat.  *BIG GRIN*  --------------------------------------  Don't look now, but Howard Dean is  urlLink promising to BUY THE ELECTION!

      Unless you've ever suffered from depression, you have no idea what it's like. Because it's not an easily-seen or outwardly visible illness -- no runny nose or swollen ankles -- it's misunderstood. People who never suffer from depression can be the cruelest and most hateful "friends" of those who do suffer ... while never even knowing how hurtful they are being. That, in turn, just makes the depression worse.  Comments such as "snap out of it", "it's a spiritual problem" and "why don't you quit feeling sorry for yourself" (or, my favorite, "if you get depressed again I'm leaving you") are verbal salts rubbed on a life-threatening wound.  Depression can come and go like low pressure systems over Lake Erie; one minute you're feeling fine, next you're depressed. Sometimes even a very small event can trigger depression; a word, a memory, even a song.  I know, because I've been suffering for years. YEARS.  It started with a "sleep disorder". That's putting it quite mildly. In 10 years, I slept all night only eight times. Yeah, you read that right, it's not a typo -- eight times in 10 years. During that time I didn't "feel" depressed -- at least not nearly as despondent as I sometimes get now.  Back in 1998 things got really really bad for me. Now follow closely, and see if you can realize that your outward situation isn't always an indication of depression: At that time, my income has just doubled. Yeah, DOUBLED! That's depressing, right? Okay ... so that's not the problem. Also, I had started back to Penn State to finally finish my degree work (which my advisor that I've known for 20+ years said "why bother? You already have a great career, you're successful, and you alreadly know all this stuff?"). My home life was fine.  So what was the problem? Let's just say I had managed to isolate and then dwell on some decisions that I made that I thought I could have done better. THAT'S ALL IT TAKES!  During that time, I nosedived into depression like a Kamikaze pilot over Midway. No matter what happened, I managed to find fault with my decision-making and blame myself (N.B. to this day I blame all, ALL, of my problems on myself -- and I'm totally convinced that they ARE my fault. Name ONE problem that's NOT my fault; you can't). This downward cycle combined with well-meaning but misunderstanding friends culminated one day while driving home.  I'll never forget the moment. I was driving around 55 mph down a long stretch of two-lane blacktop when I saw a stone wall. Thoughts raced through my mind, and it seemed so tempting to put an end to this misery once and for all. As I grew closer and closer, my mind raced faster than you can even imagine. All I had to do was pull my steering wheel to the right and it'd be over; no depression ... freedom at last from this misery that I had created.  At the last minute, one thought raced through my mind, and I literally had to fight -- to force myself -- to continue on the road. My heart raced as I pulled over and started to sob. I couldn't believe that I had come *that* close to the edge. It scared me beyond anything I'd ever experienced, and was stronger than any medicine.  The thought? I could not bare the thought of my daughter at my funeral. She who understands me like no one else, who loves me more than anyone else, had just saved my life!  My wife? She's older, she'd recover, she'd do well. And -- as callous as this may sound -- she'd be better off financially. Plus, she's drop-dead gorgeous and would never have a problem finding a new (and better) husband.  My son? He's a guy. He'll pull through. He'd just chalk it up to "my dad was a doofus"-kind of thinking.  I'm NOT saying those last two paragraphs are CORRECT thinking, but those were my thoughts at the time.  ---------  So, I had hit rock bottom (my son, since then, has given me some of the best advice and encouragement of my life: "Dad, resiliency is how high you bounce when you hit bottom". Thanks, Ian, you'll never know how often I tell myself that). I went to the doctor with a few days and was prescribed Prozac. Things then improved rather quickly, partly because the cat was out of the bag.  After a few weeks I started sleeping. "Wow ... so THIS is what it's like to sleep all night and be rested? WOW!"  After a few months, I was able to forgo the Prozac in favor of a natural supplement, St. John's Wort.  I continued to improve, and have not had anything *near* that depth of despair since.  ----------------  Prelude: I do get depressed from time to time (for example, as I write this), but I've learned to manage it quite well. The number one thing is that I now know that it *will* go away, and it's temporary. Also, I'm VERY quick to mention it to anyone that will understand. For example, I'll tell my wife "I'm feeling depressed", and it puts us both on guard. Also, I'll call in or leave work, telling them "I'm not feeling well" -- which is true. As odd as it may seem, sometimes the best thing is for me to go home and sit quietly. I reflect on my life, my mistakes, and rather than get even more depressed, I get encouraged. How's that? Because instead of beating myself up, I analyze my mistakes and then purpose to learn from them.  One of the best anti-suicide quotes I've ever read has been the most helpful: "Once you're dead, you won't *feel* anything, so you won't *feel* better". May sound crazy to you, but it strikes me as quite logical.  -----------------------  The debate rages between whether depression is caused by a medical condition, or whether the psychological aspect of depression causes the medical problem. I believe, in my experience, it's most psychological.  ----------------------  Why am I sharing this? Why am I bareing my soul like this? Well ... now you know. If I seem "down", you now may have an idea as to what's going on inside my head. And you can talk to me without worrying about offending me. You won't have to walk on eggs.  Also, and most importantly, you may know someone who suffers from depression. Worse, someone you know may suffer from depression *and you don't know it*. Work to lift the stigma of this killer illness. Work to support that person. Suggest, lovingly, that they get medical help.  Finally, if you suffer, GET HELP! If you don't know what to start, email me.  All the best -- Don

      HA HA ... This is side-splitting stuff ... they sell stuff at  urlLink this  site! Now  that  is funny.  Cue the band ... we're about to start the NFL playoffs, when normally sane American males abandon all sense of reality and start migrating to the TV set like a third-world slave worker during break time.  Don't get me wrong; I like football. Well ... it's okay. But the hype associated with football rivals only that of Average Joe 2.  (If you watch Average Joe 2, do me a huge favor, k? DON'T VOTE!)  No ... Americans are  not  stupid -- contrary to what Johnny Depp and Michael "Fat Man" Moore say. No ... they're just lazy. And, after all, laziness (NOT necessity) is the mother of invention. You think the TV remote was  necessary ?  Okay, I don't really believe we're lazy. But I couldn't have written my last paragraph about invention and all that stuff without positing that idea.  In other news ... would it have been okay to say to Iran, "We'll help you with earthquake relief  after  you give us complete access to your WMDs"? Moral and ethical question. Discuss.  Another Christmas come and gone. I survived. It was my worst Christmas ever. The first time I really, really did not enjoy the holiday. I think I'm slipping into a mild depression again. Great ... just great. Guess I better hit the gym.  Resolutions! You do 'em? What are yours?  I don't make "resolutions", instead I play with semantics and "set goals" for the year. Whatever.  Mine for 2004: Become more assertive and less nice. I'm too easy "stepped on" and I tend to give in and keep quiet, which isn't good. I sometimes wonder if I'll explode. Kinda like that scene from Life Of Brian.  So I gotta learn to be not so nice. I know that sounds bad, but it's not really. I mean, I just have to be more selfish and carve out *my* life -- since I don't have one -- and let those around me love me for who I am (that's what others tell me all the time, so ...). I'm 44 years old and don't take any opportunities to do some things  just for me .  Enough about that; what are  your  goals or resolutions?  Oh; I worry about people that don't do anything like goals or resolutions. How do you grow?  Does Dean have a chance against Bush? Is Dean a shoe-in to win he Democrat nomination?  Politics in America has become so uncivilized and so uncouth, it's no wonder that more and more people are tuning it out. The Left is the worst. They are incredibly racist and so dishonest. It's truly disgusting. They have no moral compass -- many of them being atheists -- and so anything goes. At least the Right, no matter how extreme, have a sense of right and wrong and justice.  Except, of course, for the late not-great Strom Thurmond. Bastard.

      Hey! I just noticed something!  Ever notice that the singer Roger Whittaker and the actor Patrick Stewart sound  exactly  alike?  Strange. And I've never seen them together. Hmmmmm ...  (Makes as much sense as  urlLink Howard Dean's suggestion that President Bush knew about the September 11 attacks beforehand )

      " Congress shall make no law  respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;  or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. "  They just did! To think that our Founder Fathers died  and killed  to preserve that right, and wrote it down so we'd never forget it ... and then the current failed regime (and I mean the  entire  regime: Congress, Senate, Executive, Judicial) comes along and spits on the blood of young men and women who died.  If we pulled out of Iraq right now  and let Saddam's regime have a part in the government , people would scream that our troops "died in vain!". Yet, you don't hear much about our Founding Fathers dying in vain now do you? I mean ... given that part of our First Admendment  Right  was just erased, I'd say there's a bit of "in vain" in their struggle against The Crown.  Just think:  You can now be put in jail for political speech  in the United States!!  Don't believe me? Break the law -- run a negative ad a week before the election -- and then don't pay the fine. What will happen? Into the slammer you go!  United States Constitution: RIP, December 10, 2003.

       urlLink Bush poised to end steel tariffs.   What you  hope  happened:  GW: "I gotta lift this tariff; it's just not right in the context of fair and free trade."   What  probably  happened:  GW: "If I lift the tariff, what happens?" Rove: "We calculate you'll lose seven electoral college vote because of the Unions, but gain thirteen because of the help to the economy". GW: "Okay, let's go ahead."

      There's a blog that I frequent called  urlLink Signal vs. Noise . I often mention cigars, surfing and -- of course -- Anna (Anna is the name of my Spyder, silly ... my wife named the car after Anna Kournikova).  Yesterday, while discussing something, a person made my day with  urlLink this  piece of humor entitled "Next week's Newsweek cover".  Can't remember the last time I laughed so hard.

      This will shock everyone that knows me ... but I'm hoping for  urlLink Dennis Kucinich For President .  Why?  He's all about  Peace , and idea whose time has come. Kucinich even wants a Peace Department set up within the U.S. Government.  Also, he's a man of character, ideals and integrity, not driven by polling data and focus groups.  Which, sadly, is why you won't vote for him. You are led around by the nose by the media, not stopping to study the candidates' positions. You have yielded your brain to ad campaigns and sound bites.  Sorry if that seems mean, but it needs to be stated.  My brother is a local politician, and he can testify to how ignorant the averge citizen is. No, he hasn't  said  that, I don't want to put words in his mouth ... but the stories. Some people (most, I think) just Don't Get It.  *sigh*  So if Bush wins (*shudder*) or Kerry (perhaps a bit better), it will mark another victory for special interests and big business  in either case . Of the two, I'll vote for Kerry.  But Dennis Kucinich is my man for President.  You see, Miles ... you  can  be in favor of the 2nd Admendment and still want a peaceful world. It's all about sport and (hopefully never used) self-defense.  Join me: Vote Kucinich.

      I'm a CIO -- that's Chief Information Officer -- the top exec in our company's IT group. Exciting stuff, eh?  That is, until you realize you have to read and learn about stuff like  urlLink this .  More snow tonight, piled on top of the single-digit temps lately. Can I scream loud enough, "I WANT TO LIVE IN KEY WEST!"??  Ian's off to Penn State (University Park), and off to a great start. His Comp Sci 120 (data structures) prof told him today, "You don't need to come to this class ... ever". He can email in the work. Ian was worried, because it's a data structure class (something Ian mastered in 10th grade in AP Programming) and yet they don't even get to  urlLink tertiary trees .  Miles, silly Miles, is delusional enough to think that the Sex Pistols or the Ramones could hold a candle to The Rolling Stones. Gimme a break. Granted, they're good (especially the Ramones) ... but come on. I think that California sun is getting to Miles.  Here's a good question: "Do you REALLY need a Hummer H2 or a Suburban to commute to work?"  Ever heard of oil? Do you realize we import over 50 percent of our oil? Did you ever think that, perhaps, we should cut back?  Just a thought. Something for you to think about while barreling down Rt. 95 at 85 mph in your 11 mpg Dakota.  Our cultural calendar is not up to snuff this year. We've only scheduled a concert -- going to hear "Windham Hill's Winter Solstice" this weekend. Other than that, we've not locked anything in place. To be honest, there's not enough to see and/or hear around this place.  I'd love to see  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep , but it's not in our area. ARGH!  The NFL season will soon be over, and I've yet to watch an entire game. Probably has something to do with the fact that my favorite team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, stunk up the league. Yuck. Well ... and the fact that I'd rather watch Jamie Oliver or Alton Brown whip something up.  My favorite network is  urlLink Fine Living , which I don't even get at home on my lame Suscom cable. I watch it at the cigar lounge on Saturday mornings while enjoying one (or, usually, two) premium cigars. Between Andrea Immer's wine show and the Napa Lifestyle show, I'm lovin' it.  Last weekend, while watching those two shows, I thoroughly enjoyed a Montecristo White and a Macanudo Robust. Both excellent, although the Mac was better (a surprise). I'm anxious to try the Montecristo Afrique -- all African tobacco. Could be the newest "thing" in cigars.  If you don't smoke cigars, you should. Really.  Gotta run; gotta go home and read about Business Intelligence and Data Cubes. *sigh*

       urlLink Steep  is good tea, no doubt. We enjoy it at times.  But, I'm convinced that given  good packaging  and a  great web site , you can sell any item and make a great living. Add to that the fact that "exclusivity sells", and you're on your way.  Tell you what; email me with some ideas of items to be sold over the internet, and I'll sort through and pick one; I'll set up a web site, put together good packaging, and cut you in 20 percent of my first two years' profit.  Seriously.  Then I'll be living in Naples or West Palm Beach or Napa Valley.

      Exclamation Points RULE!!!!   I predict: The Baltimore Ravens will win the Super Bowl. Yup. Best defense in the playoffs. I don't particularly like the Ravens, but gotta give 'em props.   I'm very glad to put 2003 behind me. It was too emotional, what with the tragic loss of one of the finest people I've ever met -- that being my nephew, Harry -- and the graduation of the light of my life (my daughter, Erika) from college, her marriage to The Guy You Pray Your Daughter Brings Home (you could not hand-pick a better man for your daughter), to the decision by my son to leave his incredible job (where's he's been successful beyond any expectations) to attend Penn State.  Wow ... I need a breather.   I set goals around this time of year. So far I've come up with the following goals:  1. Read two books about being more assertive; one by end of March, other by end of July. 2. Read an average of one book every two months. 3. Lift Weights at least two times a week. 4. Purge my old clothing. 5. Finish painting the living room by end of February. 6. Finish garage shelves by end of March.   I'll have more to follow.   Take note!!  Here's a tip to use at work that will earn you some points: when you have a list, always always  always  make it a numbered list (as I did above, thankyewverymush). That way, in a meeting, people can easily refer to it by number.  Didn't learn that in college, did ya? Nope! You can thank me by sending me one or more cigars.   Hey Miles! Nice web site ... NOT! (it's down). Stinkin' skateboarding liberal.   Shambaugh and Grichten came over for New Year's Eve. Had a great time, better than expected. We hung out, mostly in the garage with me smoking three cigars (not at once ... duh), and had some adult beverages and just talked and -- mostly -- laughed. So great to see some friends from times gone by, still friends, still doing well.  At one point, Shambaugh remarked at our lives (my bride and I) being "about perfect". He named great kids, lovely house, good jobs, 25 years plus of marriage ... and reminded us how great that all is.  That was encouraging. Having someone from the outside, looking in, tell you that you have a great life ... it means a lot.  After reaching middle age, it dawns on you just how important relationships are. You lose that 20-something aggressiveness and that 30-something ego and just mellow out. It's great, it really is. And despite what most of the losers out there would have you believe, you can be in very good physical shape at age 45 and still enjoy kayaking, biking, surfing, golfing, lifting weights ... I could go on ad nauseum.  Point is: as Frank sang, "The Best Is Yet To Come".

      We recently got rid of the piano that we purchased back in 1989. We paid $900 for it back then, and it's still in excellent shape, but rather than try to sell it we "gifted" it to my friend, Matt.  (I love verbing a word; gifted, efforted, etc etc)  Matt offered his old console color TV in exchange, and my daugher expressed an interested in the TV.  Soooooo ... being the nice guy I am (read: Stupid), I accepted the TV site unseen.  Picked up the TV last Sunday, and then went to deliver it on Monday evening. Weeelllll ... as you can guess by now, my daughter and her hubby decided that the TV would totally clash with their interior design.  I have to agree. The TV is a wood grain console, while their apartment is uber modern design. It would clash like George Bush and Michael Moore at a nude beach.  So, no problem, I'll just take the TV to the Salvation Army store. On Saturday ... five days later.  So my wife, bless her heart, is driving her rich and luxurious Buick Rendezvous CXL all week with a TV in the back.  Finally, Saturday arrives and I take the TV over to the Salvation Army store. This is great ... I mean ... some family down on their luck will at least get a good color TV for cheap, right?  So I pull up and what does the "We Will Not Accept" sign say? Right there ... number two ... "B/W TV or ANY KIND OF CONSOLES (working or not)".  Grrrrrr.  I try my charm, but the chubby "Marty" guy says no-can-do. How anyone can resist my charm is beyond explanation, but apparently the Salvation Army trains their minions to be immune to Don Schenck Charm. Amazing. Just hope they don't train anyone else (Like, say, my wife, my employer, the IRS ...).  So now I have a TV in my garage, waiting for our townships Spring Cleanup Day, when I can put it by the curb with a sign "Works Great" and watch the Junk Buzzards swoop down and take it.  Moral: Don't do favors. No good deed goes unpunished.

      Tony Kornheiser wrote a book,  urlLink Back For More Cash , and putting across a play on words, I'm back with more cash.  You see, I recently attended  urlLink SHOT Show 2004  in sunny Las Vegas. Sunny it was, about 60 degrees every day. Not that I got outside during the day ... except when I'd step outside for a break and simply close my eyes and put my face toward the sun. This, while it was four degrees back home.  *big grin*  I did gamble a tiny bit, and I did end up ahead about $80. That's not worth mentioning except that at least I didn't lose. One person in our group won over $5,000 playing blackjack.  That  would be worth mentioning.  There was a progressive slot machine, "Mega Bucks", that was up to $10 million. I kept saying I was going to play it and win ... but I just never got around to it.  Well ... two -- count 'em, two -- people  did  hit the jackpot while I was there! ARGH! Two people are off with my $10 million!  We stayed at the MGM Grand hotel, and the suite was on the 25th floor, with a balcony overlooking the strip. Had a hot tub on the balcony, too. Did I mention it was Real Nice?  Vegas is a charicature of The Good Life or Entertainment -- pick one. While at the MGM, Tony Bennett and Bette Midler performed (not together, one separate evenings). Meanwhile, it was during Valentine's Day, so you saw many, many brides and grooms walking about, waiting their turn at the chapel.  What a way to start a marriage; I'm not sure it's such a good idea.  Saw only one "Elvis", walking through the casino. That was cool.  All in all, I worked very hard (on my feet from 8 to 5:30 every day, working a booth), played very hard, and have a good time. Nice place to visit, but ... you know the rest.  -- Don

      I'm leaving for Las Vegas and  urlLink SHOT Show  in a few hours. I'm always nervous about flying. I know it's safe, but seriously ... wouldn't you rather drive into a cornfield at 50 mph than auger in at, say, 650?  :-)  Good site here:  urlLink Market 314 . Check it out and contribute! I'll be sending my pizza recipes over, as well as my best-in-the-world French Onion soup.  Got my haircut this morning at  urlLink American Male  at Lancaster. Great experience; more than just a haircut. I got my hands dipped in parafin, got a face massage with tea tree oil and then a hot towel treatment. Quite the relaxing experience.  I'm so metrosexual it's not funny. Miles, you wish you were as hip. In your dreams, buddy.  Kucinich is still hanging in there!  Seen the  urlLink Dennis Miller show  on CNBC yet? I like it. He's intelligent and quick-witted, and his down-to-earth ideals are refreshing. Check it out.  Gotta run ... airport security can take a while.  Peace,  -- Don

      Numbers have meaning, and some numbers have special meaning given a certain context. I'm convinced that if you delve deep enough into number theory and high math, you can reduce the physical world -- yes, the  physical  world -- to a series of numbers and equations.  A lot of number and equations, to be sure, but nonetheless I'll stand by my theory until proven otherwise.  (How's  that  for reverse-scientific-principal; I say it's true and ask you to disprove it. Sheesh, I'm so scientifically dishonest ...)  And, no, I haven't been watching  urlLink PI  again.  Think about certain contexts, and meaningful numbers pop into to your head.  For example ... human age. Thirteen, 16, 18 and 21 all pop into your head. Teen years, driving, voting and/or leaving home, and drinking.  See what I mean?  I think a woman reaches her peak, beauty-wise, at age 32. That's not to say a 45-year old isn't beautiful (see my wife for details), but it peaks at age 32  typically . She's matured, got a few lines and maybe some emerging gray hairs (which can be attractive, see Emilou Harris for further particulars) and has a sense of herself. An air of confidence.  Driving. 20 miles per gallon ... seems to be the cutoff between horrible fuel economy and not-too-bad, particularly for a large automobile.  Football, these are easy. 100 yards rushing or receiving in a game ... 300 yards passing ... these are no-brainers.  How about money? $1,000 a week is a nice level. Then it goes to $2,000 a week ... then if shifts from weekly to annual. The next step is $250,000 a year, after that $500,000, then a cool million. After that, the next number is 83 ... which is the average daily temperature of Tahiti *smile*.  Water. 104 degrees to wash your hands, 110 to shower (a HOT shower). Okay ... 64 to play in the ocean, 75 to enjoy the ocean, 80 to enjoy the backyard pool.  Air temps; 60 seems a lot warmer than 59. Fifty-nine is a warm March day, 60 seems like spring.  You get the idea.  ------------------------------------  A lot has been said and written about the Super Bowl halftime fiasco, so I might as well chime in since I'm more intelligent than most of the other commentators.  *COUGH*  First of all, if you were stupid enough to believe the original "it was a mistake" claim, then please turn in your brain at the nearest Good Humor truck, since you obviously aren't using it. Never, *never*, put anything past the entertainment crowd. These people need attention like Al Franken needs a makeover. They are so full of themselves that they can't see anything they do as wrong as long as it gets them some attention.  Second, what is being missed is the entire disgusting behavior of the entire show. The crotch grabbing, the bumping and grinding. Hey, you want to watch that stuff on MTV, help yourself. But a football halftime show? Excuse me, but did you even *think* that perhaps, just perhaps, that Joe and Sally Lutheran from Flyovertown, Indiana, might be watching the show with their two school-age children?  Finally, it's too bad that most of you weren't as smart as I was about the whole thing (I guess it is a bit unfair of me to expect people to be as smart as I am, I mean ...); I didn't watch it!  Wow ... what a concept?  I saw the advance advertising -- more like "warning" -- and switched over to watch Howard Dean being interviewed by Tim Russert on Meet The Press. Gee ... I traded 30 minutes of depravity for a half hour of knowledge about the possible future leader of the world.  Told ya I was smart. Now don't you feel stupid?  ---------------------------------------  How come hypochondriacs never think they have hypochondria?

      Music.  The international language.  I love music. No, I mean I  love  music. Love it as in I listen to it all the time, and all types. You like music ... I  love  music.  Got that?  I've observed a lot about music and have some "interesting opinions" about it (to quote Miles when speaking charitably about me).  I'm 44 years old, and grew up listening to Motown. Nothing better, it is (was?) great music. It taught me how to dance (something I stopped doing about age 35 -- a bit too late *smile*) and always plants a smile inside me.  But folks our age have the youth of today confused and in a tizzy. You see, when *we* were kids, our fathers would complain about the volume ("TURN THAT DOWN!") and the singing ("You can't understand a word they're saying") and the rhythms ("sounds like a bunch of jungle music").  But we, on the other hand,  like  the music that our children listen to. And it drives them crazy!  Yesterday I listened to Reggae dance music. I like alternative rock. I like punk at times (don't tell Miles; he thinks punk music is the cat's meow). Hip-hop? Heck, I like Outkast, Jean Paul, the whole crew yo.  Point is, we've reached a point in societal evolution where everyone can listen to the same music and enjoy it, and it drives teens nuts. They would like nothing better than to shock us and make us scream about their music, and they can't.  Sorry kiddies ... we've seen it all, heard it all, and quite frankly we're not impressed.  Marilyn Manson? We had Alice Cooper and Ozzie before Marilyn was even born. B-O-R-I-N-G!  (an aside: Don't get uptight about "shock" acts like Manson (who is a has-been by now); it's all AN ACT. It's done to shock and get publicity. Understand that, and it won't bother you)  Explicit lyrics and sexual overtones? Ha! ... don't make me laugh. Back In The Day, we'd put on Barry White (R.I.P.) and ... well ... we didn't need some coked-up street thug to tell us what to do! We made our own lyrics, if ya know what I mean.  *BIG GRIN*  So music's cool. Even punk, which is just random guitar licks and drums with someone screaming lyrics about everyday life.  "I eat burritos when I'm hungry ..."  But punk has its place. Like when you want to get amped for something, like skateboarding (tip of the hat to Miles there) or surfing (aside: skateboarding is to surfing as Carmen San Diego is to Carmen Electra) or driving the Solar Yellow Spyder.  (Oh, I'm sorry; you don't have a Solar Yellow Spyder! My bad)  *laugh*  So next time your 15-year old daughter gets in the passenger seat and turns on "Hey Ya", don't say anything. Just reach down and turn it up.  She'll be stunned and quiet.  And that'll be music to your ears.  -- Don

      Well, like many others, I went to see  urlLink The Passion of The Christ  over the weekend.  I don't know where to start, there are so many aspects to discuss.  For starters, it's a movie that assumes a certain level of Christian faith going in, and at least a working knowledge of the four gospels of the New Testament. Without that base, it's nothing but two hours of some good guy getting beat up by Roman soldiers. Going deeper -- and I went to Bible school for four plus years -- it's amazing how accurate and "correct" the movie is.  I guess I shouldn't be amazed, since scholars were used as consultants. But it's refreshing to see some adherence to actual practices.  For example, just as is historically correct -- but known by few -- when the Romans wash their hands, the plunge them into a bowl of water. The Jews, on the other hand (guided by the teaching of the Old Testament!), put their hands under running water.  Bet ya didn't know that, did ya?  But beyond the history and the violence (which didn't affect me and I'll explain why later), this film is much, much more. Again ... if you're a follower of Christ.  The graphic nature of the violence against the Lord is not just accurate, but very moving. The movie starts with a quote from Isaiah that pretty much lays down the meaning of the next two hours: Christ took the our sins upon Him. Knowing that, could the gore be any less? How ugly, unkind and downright sick can people be? And yet, here's the Son Of Man taking it all upon Himself in order to bring forgiveness.  I saw myself in the movie at one point, and it hit me pretty hard. As one of the Roman soldiers was mocking, laughing and hitting Christ, I saw my (former) self. That was me, before my conversion to Christianity.  Wow.  Why didn't the violence affect me? Having gone to a fundamental Bible school, I had been taught (in graphic detail) every aspect of the Passion of Christ, right down to the cause of death (drowning; the lungs fill with fluid. In fact, the victim has to push up with their legs to expand the chest enough to get a breath, which is why the Romans broke the legs of the other two victims at the end of the crucifixion; if they could not lift themselves, they could not get a breath of air and would die quickly. By being able to lift themselves, they prolong their own agony).  There is so much I could write, and I could give you several hours' worth of Bible teaching on this.  In the end, I'd rather suggest you read The Book. It is, after all, the number one all-time best seller.  -- Don

      Okay, here's something we can  all  agree that we hate: That fake ad-hoc question that the news anchor asks the reporter at the end of the report.  " ... and so, for now, there won't be a new Wal-Mark in Lancaster County. Live, from Warwick High School, this is Blahblah Talkinghead reporting."  "Blahblah, what about the proposed Target store in that same area?"  "Forrest, Authorities here say that the same restrictions will apply to any store over 10,000 square feet, so for now, the new Target store is also on hold."  "Thank you, Blahblah. In other news ..."  Folks, you  do  know that the entire "I'll-ask-a-question-and-it'll-sound-impromptu" thing  is  scripted, don't you?  ARGH! I HATE that. What an insult. What? ... we're to believe that you just *happen* to ask a question and the reporter is just SOOOO smart that they know the answer?  Sheesh. Whatever happened to just reporting the facts? Stinkin' ratings game.  P.S. My neighbor and a lady at work call it "Wal-Mark", so it's used here. The lady at work also says "Discovery card" for the Discover credit card and calls the office supply place "Office Mack".

      The clock on my system tray (that little indented box in the lower, right corner of your Windows XP screen) shows 6:17 PM, and I'm sitting on the deck. The birds are auditioning for their summer song series, and the sun is reflecting off the pool that I opened yesterday.  To my left, one of the finest cigars made: an Ashton Virgin Sun Grown. A Churchill. It's one of the most flavorful and strongest non-Cuban cigars going. I'm tasting some serious cinnamon and chocolate right now in this masterful stogie. I'm chasing it with some Canada Dry ginger ale.  It's 83 degrees, and I just took a quick dip in the pool. Fifty six degrees! That's right, 5-6! Whew ... talk about  cold! . But, the tradition must continue: I get in the pool when I open it in April and when I close it in September. Tradition isn't always meant to be easy, but it's always meaningful.  What's pretty cool is that thanks to the wonderful invention of wireless networking, I'm able to sit here by the deck and surf the web, make this blog entry, and do some late Sunday evening work while 45 miles from the office.  That's sweet.  (I just realized: there's not a single cloud in the sky!)  Had quite a weekend, with all the beautiful weather and such. Friday night I stopped to see Erik, my mechanic and high school classmate all those years ago (Lennon!). People hang out at his garage on Friday evenings. I smoked a big cigar, several people fawned over my Spyder, and then I headed home to see one of the most beautiful women on the planet, dressed to kill and taking me out to dinner.  My favorite restaurant, bar none: Blue Moon. What a fantastic dinner. Great French wine (Vouvray); smooth as silk, very light body, very delicate (but not understated) finish with a hint of lemons. Outstanding.  While the older gentlemen played classic crooner tunes on the piano (with our encouragement), we dined. I had what would translate to "Casserole of the sea", and Patti enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass in a sauce that can only be described as "perfect". It could also, I suppose, be described by it's ingredients, which the server would not share with us. So, donning our food detective hats, we did our best to conjure up the recipe via deliberate tasting.  I finally nailed it down: butter (of course), cream, shallots, a hint of roasted red peppers, and the coup de grace -- rosemary.  "Nope. Thyme!"  I was puzzled? Thyme? But Patti ... I  know  the flavor of rosemary, and it's rosemary.  "Thyme."  Come on. I mean ... yeah ... she has a culinary degree ... but she was wrong this time. Aha! ... I couldn't wait to win this battle.  Another server stopped by, and we asked for the ingredients. She didn't hesitate to share them:  "Butter, cream, shallots, roasted red pepper and thyme."  ARGH!!!!  Humbled (ME! Humbled! Can you believe it????), I ordered the caramel cream custard (she, the red raspberry sorbet) and sheepishly admitted that she was right.  Again.  As usual.  *sigh*  -----------  Didn't see my son for Easter. Haven't seen him for a while. We communicate on an almost-daily basis, but haven't seen him. He's too busy at Penn State. I miss him, and am anxious to see him, but I'm even happier that he's making the right decision to stay there and do his school work and research (he's in the Cognitive Science research department there, you know ... computers that think and all that stuff).  Good job, Ian. Keep it up. You have no idea how proud we are of you: myself, your mom, your sister, Chris, Jane, my parents, Bob & Carol. You da man!  -----------  Saturday I got up at the usual weekend time -- 5:45 -- and went down to Philadelphia to pick up some 16-inch wheels for my Saab 900S ... my "beater". What's cool is that I was walking around the house at 11 in the morning thinking "I've been to Philly and back already today and I still have the entire day ahead of me! Cool!".  Opened the pool, drove the Spyder a bit (to run some errands). Erika came over to continue to try to migrate her *stuff* over to her apartment, and then my dad invited himself over to sit around my fire pit and smoke cigars (it's cool, he and my mom pronounce it "CI-gars"). Nice evening.  Sunday, I sharpened the blade on my lawnmower (Thanks for tip, Rich! I used a belt sander as you suggested and it works  great! ) and then made sure it was exactly 3 inches cutting height as mandated by Patti, who is also a Penn State Master Gardener!  (In case you haven't noticed by now, she's a driven over-achiever; Penn State Master Gardener, degree in Culinary Arts, certificate in Baking and Pastry, home-schooled our children for seven years, is in very good shape and is drop-dead gorgeous. Now that I think about it ... pretty much a good match for me ...)  *cough*  So get this: The first time I cut the grass, Patti says "it's too short; raise the mower. It should be three inches high". Now, I know "cut it high and let it lie" is the mantra for a healthy lawn, but how could she know that it wasn't three inches high, but rather two and three-quarters inches?  Come on! No way! No way she could have been able to tell that the lawn was 1/4-inch too short.  See what I'm up against? It's a good thing I have the talent, intelligence, good looks and awesome physique needed to keep up with my perfectionist wife.  *cough*  Man, you have no idea how great this cigar is. I mean absolutely wonderful.  -----------  Go ahead and laugh, but on April 8th we went to the 1st Mariner Arena at Baltimore to see Yanni in concert. It was, hands down, the   Best.  Concert.  Ever.  You may think you don't like his kind of music (he's described as the "first New Age superstar"), but when it's performed live it's awe-inspiring. We had great seats near the front, and could see the musicians' facial expressions. During the course of the three hour performance, nearly every artist had the opportunity to perform a solo. Talent beyond description. Just unbelievable.  So, our 2003-2004 winter cultural calendar winds to a close. We went to see the Windham Hills Winter Solstice concert, Yanni, and we're tossing in an IMAX movie about the coral reefs (and how, sadly, we're losing them because of chemical farming and over-harvesting of trees) to make it three events. We do three events every year.  Next year will include the Cirque de Soleil "O" at the Bellagio hotel and casino at Las Vegas. I went to see it two years ago and was so overwhelmed that I insist that Patti accompany me to Las Vegas next January (during  urlLink SHOT Show 2005 ) just to see "O". It is the greatest cultural event I've ever attended ... well ... I guess it's a tie with Les Miserables, which is a life-changing experience.  ----------  My son-in-law is the second-best son-in-law in the world (I hold the title of "Best", thank you very much) and has a great job. He helps lower income people with housing, particularly when they have a problem with their landlord and can't afford an attorney. He also helps make sure housing discrimination is held in check.  Fantastic, Chris. It's extremely important work, and we're proud of you. I know how much Chris believes in fairness and civil (and human) rights. Very important issues that many well-to-do people (read hard core Republicans) just don't seem to care about.  Keep up the great work.  ------------  My daughter (she's married to Chris -- figure that out yet?) is going through that stage in your life where everyone you know is getting married. It can be a bit of a drag, and quite costly. This outfit, that gift, this party ... it stops being fun when people are insisting that you spend $100 on an outfit "so it will match the usher's sister's outfit".  Chin up, Erika. Just muddle through when you need to, put your foot down only when necessary (but then don't budge), and smile a lot. Only wish those other weddings could be as great (and as COOL) as your wedding.  -------  7:02 PM now, and the cigar is half done. It's still fantastic. Wish I could have another when this one is finished, but Patti gets a bit upset when I have three or four cigars one right after the other. She will ask me "How many cigars have you had?", and I very carefully give a sneaky answer: "This is my last one".  And that, my friend, is the application of  urlLink 1 Peter 3:7 .  -------------  Finally, if you're a spiritual person, please remember to pray for peace, especially in Iraq. If you're not a believer, then please send out some good karma.  Seriously.  -- Don

      If you are using Microsoft SQL Server, never prefix your stored procedures with 'sp_', unless you are storing the procedure in the master database. If you call a stored procedure prefixed with sp_, SQL Server always looks for this procedure in the master database. Only after checking in the master database (if not found) it searches the current database.  Just thought you'd want to know that. *laugh*  -- Don, aka "That geek in the messy office who listens to folk music all day"

      As mention  urlLink elsewhere on the web , Thursday, May 27, was my 45th birthday. Finally, I felt the "oh man, I'm gettin' old" pangs that one is supposed to suffer at 40. At 40 I was too busy working out, driving a hot car and enjoying life in general.  Now, however ... I ... uh ... hey! ... I'm still working out, driving a hot car, and enjoying life in general. I'm not getting older, I'm ... you know the cliche.  "He is in the music business, he is calling you 'DUDE!'"  Cut to the chase, Don; whaja get?  from Patti: Two music CD's; Steve Miller Band's Greatest Hits and "Underneath" by Hanson. Yeah, laugh all you want, but Hanson's newest CD is full of really, really good music. No "Mmm-Bop" on this one; sorry Miles, but no "Blitzkrieg Bop" either. Both are great driving music.  from Jane & Mike: $10 to get a good cigar. YEAH! Hmmmm ... Ashton VSG? Padron Anniversario? Decisions, decisions.  from Rich: A black T-shirt that reads "Got Old?". Oh how nice. I wish it were white so I could wear it at the shore while surfing. How cool would that be? A guy wearing an old guy t-shirt while surfing.  from Ian: TBA. from Erika & Chris: TBA  Got nice cards, and tons and tons of email wishes. You folks are all too kind.  So I get home from work and Erika (visiting) and Patti are cooking. Marinated flank steak, roasted potatoes and green beans sauted with red peppers and almonds. An absolutely perfect dinner. I paired it with a good Zinfandel (Red, NOT white! Never white Zin. *shudder*). Followed by Patti's Best-In-The-World made-from-scratch German Chocolate Cake. Hmmmm ... can I go back and put more hyphens in that sentence.  Oh; A HYPHEN is NOT a DASH! Sheesh.  Followed dinner with an $85 cigar, a Fuente Fuente Opus X Perfexion X. Okay, it's normally perhaps $30, but they were pushing them for $85 in Vegas last February, which is where I got it. Nope, I didn't buy it ... did I ever mention how I'm GREAT at being a total mooch?  The John Walton school -- a charter school -- in the Atlanta area just improved quite a bit! They picked up a fantastic teacher; it'll benefit the students to no end. I'm quite happy for that school.  Oh ... sheesh ... did I mention? It's my sister! Your sister? I'm sure she's a fine teacher.  *laugh*  I have one serious question: With terrorists attacking and/or threatening to attack, what, exactly, is it they want? Seriously?  All the best,  -- Don

      I was born.  Yup ... today (May 27th) is my 45th birthday! Email me (donschenck at hotmail dot com) and wish me a happy 45th - it'd mean worlds to me.  Ocean water temperature is 65.8 degrees. I  might  go surfing on Monday; depends on whether I want to fight the traffic. I really miss self-employment, where I could take a Tuesday or Wednesday off work and go surfing. No traffic, no crowds (both on the beach and the lineup), just wonderful.  *sigh*  Need any project management, software development, software architecture work done?  This past Sunday I had to mow the field behind our house (it's not our property, but we mow part of it to keep that blasted burdock down), and I figured it would be best to don long pants. Ticks and stuff like that.  Despite it being about 90 degrees, I managed to cut the weeds in long pants. What I did was pretend I was back in my hard-cord, fundamentalist Baptist days, when men didn't wear shorts (I sometimes did -- I was bad, I know). I played a mind game, that is. I figured I take the "hard path" and see how "tough" I was back then. You know.  Know what? ... It wasn't hard at all. Not nearly as hard as, say, loving your neighbor as yourself or praying for those who despitefully use you (Matthew 5:44).  :-)  Got in the pool several times over the weekend. The water is 76 degrees -- nice! Very nice. Also enjoyed several good cigars. In retrospect, not a bad weekend.  Found  urlLink this   cool website the other day. Fun stuff.  Not much more to say. I really want to go surfing *SIGH*.  All the best,  -- Don

      It appears as though some Democrat senators are trying to  urlLink change religion  rather than let religion change them.  Senators, you are dead  wrong  on this one. You're not even close. Your arrogance is appalling. Imagine the self-inflated egos of these pseudo-Catholics, thinking that their own opinions are enough to change almost 2,000 years of teaching.  It's not all about you, Mr. Kerry and friends. It's about a church standing for something and not changing. It's not up to the church to moderate their moral teachings; rather, it's up to you to either; 1. Change your views on abortion, or; 2. Change your religious affiliation.  (Disclaimer: I'm not a Roman Catholic, never have been, never will be. I have some major differences with their teachings. However, they have the right -- no, obligation -- to hold fast to their moral teachings, regardless of what egotistical amoralists think)  I applaud the church for withholding Communion to these politicians. It's in keeping with church teaching. What? ... should they give Communion to a known rapist or serial killer? To an admitted adulterer (who is still "adultering")?  No, no, a thousand times no.  Change your view, Senators. You're either Catholic or not; you can't have it both ways.  (Disclaimer: I stopped being a "Baptist" when I realized their very racist beliefs.)   If your religious beliefs don't change your actions, what good are they?   Finally; A man's  morality  will dictate his  theology .

      Doesn't every home have a "junk drawer", where mismatched items that have no other home end up? This entry is my Junk Drawer of Opinions.  (Miles, the only man my age who is even more stubborn about ageing than I am, says almost all of my opinion are "junk". *smile*)  The water temperature is 56.1 degrees. Surf weather is slowly approaching. Want to go surfing with me? Email me: DonSchenck@hotmail.com.  A female friend of mine, from way back in high school, recently called me a "smart, sexy man". Wow ... that feels good. I live for that.  Patti and I are doing the  Body For Life  routine. We didn't enter the contest -- I'm just *not* that competitive -- but we are carefully planning our six small meals a day, working out six days a week, and generally being all positive. So upbeat that it must be sickening to be around us. We're all about rising at 5:30, lifting or biking, having breakfast together (I cook the best eggs ...), all that "oh look at us we're healthy and have it all together" stuff that makes people hate us.  I love that.  I *finally* have some of my shape back, which is nice. I don't look like a former lifter any more ... I'm getting more defined while adding muscle. Nice. If I can get the rotator cuff under control (surfing injury), I'll be good to go for surfing.  To that end, we are selling our power rack, Olympic-style weights and incline-able bench. Instead, we purchased a Crossbow, which is a Bowflex wannabe. I know it sounds corny and perhaps stupid, but that Crossbow is fantastic. Takes very little room, is quiet, is safe, and we can do so many different exercises while changing resistance very quickly. We're pleased, and it shows.  Having breakfast with your bride every morning is the best thing. It's wonderful to look across the table at the woman who knows me better than anyone else on this planet. We talk about the day ahead, our plans, our schedules ... our life. Wonderful to be married over 25 years and still have longing for each other.  In case you didn't guess, I'm sitting on the deck as I write this, listening to the ocean and smoking a premium cigar. Life should be this good for everyone.  Work is hectic; perhaps too hectic. Then again, the days fly by, and we are getting a lot done. We are transforming a company, changing it from a one-man operation with helpers into an efficient machine. It's challenging, with personality conflicts all the way, but it's one of the more rewarding challenges of my life.  Your job? You sleep all day compared to what I do. I make you look like you're standing still. Sorry, but you'll have to catch me when I'm gassing up the Spyder. Otherwise ... WHOOOOSH ... I'm by you and surging ahead.  (okay ... so I do have a competitive streak in me)  Patti made salmon steaks, collard greens with mushrooms and baked yams for dinner. Perfectly done, of course (www.yorkchef.com was where she went to school and ran their cafe).  Ian was home for six days after finishing his first semester at Penn State -- the best college, bar none. I think the bartenders at Penn State graduated from YOUR college.  Ian has *two* Fellowships this summer, doing Cognitive Science research. Awesome stuff. He's the smartest person I know.  Happy Belated Birthday to the best sister ever ... Jane. My sister has been an inspiration to me, a role model and a person that I look at as a picture of what a person should be. Intelligent, witty, great sense of humor, attractive (she's a Schenck, what else?). Sorry guys, but she's also married to the second-best husband in the world. Maybe third, since my daughter's hubby is fantastic.  It's a tie!  May 16 is a big day. That's the day of the dedication of Harry's Eagle Scout Project. Harry was my nephew; he died on April 13, 2003 just shy of his 17th birthday. A wonderful young man, full of life and a joy to be around.  While one never "get's over" something like this, I think May 16 will be a significant marker in this ordeal. As much as a grave marker signifies one's time on this earth, his project is the place I go to to remember Harry, to appreciate his contributions, and to think about my own mortality. While we'll never be able to put this behind us, May 16 will be the time I finally "settle" his passing in my mind. Up until now, it's still unbelievable. You keep hoping, thinking, praying that this has all been a bad dream.  Erika and Chris worked in their garden this past weekend, and Erika says "we have the sunburn to prove it". A young couple, just starting out; what could be more fun to watch? It's exciting to see them discover life together.  Parents are doing well. Mom with her Red Hat Society, dad still designing machines. I've been told by those that build his designs that "Donny, your dad is the best engineer ever". I was told of a story of a conveyor he built. It was 1/4 mile long, with turns and other complications. They built it according to his design, fired it up, and it worked flawlessly.  Ask any field engineer; that is truly rare.  Just heard a jet ski whiz by. Noisy things. You don't mind them until you get a kayak; then, all of a sudden, you're a Birkenstock-wearing environmentalist who hates motorboats.  (I just realized; I am, in fact, wearing my Birkenstocks right now!)  Talked to Shambaugh the other day. He just got back from six days in the hills of Utah, hiking and shooting. Boy, that sounds like a blast. Nothing more natural than the stars, the fresh air, and .45's.  ?  While the pool (I'm looking into it right now) is crystal clear, it's also a bit chilly outside -- about 70. Think I'll pass. I did take a quick dip on Saturday.  Had some terrible thunderstorms two nights ago. 1,500 lightning strikes during the night in York! Tragically, a woman and her four year-old child lost their life when their car got swept away. Remember: DO NOT drive through standing water that covers the road. How tragic.  Prisoner abuse in Iraq? I have no opinion. Seriously. Like any good lawyer, I have to say "I don't know all the facts". AND NEITHER DO YOU. Will we ever?  9:43; better get to bed.  All the best,  -- Don

      The ocean water temperature, 20 miles off the coast of Delaware's Indian River Inlet, is a balmy 58.5 degrees today! Wow ... you West-coasters probably think it's a hot tub (the Pacific is SOOOO cold, FYI).  It won't be long before my funboard is in the foam! Woo-hoo!

      Water temp today is 51.4.  Bush or Kerry? Two clowns. It's a lose-lose situation, folks. Once again, the two major political parties in this land have offered up two idiots and/or liars. Bush is too "soft" to be considered a good Conservative, and Kerry is too flip-floppy to be considered a good man.  Where is John Edwards when you need him?  I won't vote for Bush; I can't vote for Kerry. I hate to sit one out ... so I guess I'll vote Libertarian. Or  urlLink this .  *sigh*  All the best,  -- Don

      Water temperature today, May 3, is 52.7. Also, I visited  urlLink the web cam at the Kite Loft  and saw a guy surfing this morning. Had to be SOOO cold, but the conditions looked half decent.

      What's worse and/or scarier? Right-wingers basing their votes on the obviously slanted comments of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, or left-wingers basing their votes on Michael Moore's fact-distorting movie?  Most people are too lazy to do the math themselves. You let others think for you, and you know what happens? That's right ... you end up the mindless follower of a cult-like leader.  *sigh*  For the record, I abhor both the Republican  and  the Democrat parties. Both are shrill, lying and power-hungry. Dennis Kucinich was my Dem candidate, John McCain my Republican. Both got shut down by "The Machines".  Nader 2004?  All the best,  -- Don

      Could be a lot worse. Check out the following quote about Marlon Brando:   Marlon Brando is no longer a contender.  The screen legend, once among the most influential actors in the world, is living in poverty and getting by with the help of government aid, according to a forthcoming book.  The 80-year-old actor lives in a one-room bungalow, owes banks nearly $20 million, and is so fearful of bill collectors that he’s hidden the Oscars he won for “On the Waterfront” and “The Godfather,” reports the Sunday Times of London.  And according to the book, “Brando in Twilight” which is scheduled to be published this fall, author Patricia Ruiz claims that a former maid is threatening to sue, saying the star has broken an agreement to pay about $10,000 a month in child support for their three children.    Yikes. I suddenly feel quite blessed.  All the best,  -- Don

      I love public speaking, and have quite a bit of knowledge and experience to offer when it comes to technology.  So, I ask you: How can I find public speaking engagements? I'd like to get paid -- at least eventually -- but am willing to speak gratis at first.  I'd prefer to bypass Toastmasters and groups such as that.  Ideas? Email to don.schenck@gmail.com.  Thanks, and all the best,  -- Don

      Since losing my full-time job and becoming somewhat self-employed again, I've not been able to muster any self-confidence. That's quite unusual for me, as I'm normally loaded with gusto and bravado.  Yet, right now, I feel like a complete and utter failure. Seems like everything I put my hand to turns out to fail, break, or give up on me.  (My children notwithstanding; they are both a great success and the only source of pride in a job well done that I have.)  So here I am, 45 years old, and feeling like the best years are past ... my chances at success are gone ... and I'll be living out my remaining years as a pawn instead of as a king.  *sigh*  I know I'm suffering some depression right now, and I know I'll get over it. But it really does suck. I have absolutely *no* desire to do *anything*. None. Nadda. Zilch.   Surfing? Who cares?  Work? Give me a break.  I can't sleep at night either. ARGH!  Ya know ... being depressed is ... depressing! *smile*  Perhaps my best bet it to get a stupid software developer job making mid-60's and then coast through the next 25 years to retirement. Sounds pretty lame, but it's probably realistic given my past track record.  Dunno ... what do you think?  All the best,  -- Don

      Okay, as of about an hour ago, I'm no longer a CIO.  :-(  I'm working as a consultant; have a gig that's four days a week as a Rent-A-CIO until I figure out what to do next.  Should I restart -- and this time do it right! -- Xceeda, my company to do software development, technology consulting, network administration, etc etc?  Or do I look for another CIO job?  What's  your  advice? Comments ...  please .  Need any software development done? Need a once-a -week or -month CIO?  Oh boy ... here we go ... never a dull moment!

      Whew ... cooler heads have prevailed, and Anna (my Spyder) is staying in our garage.  Meanwhile, I guess I'll have to either: Get the Saab back, or take Ian's VW Rabbit and restore it to running condition.  --------------------------  I have the Reagan funeral on the screen via internet ... and a guy is singing "Amazing Grace" ... and I'm about to have what's known as a "Baptist Fit".  What a great song! What a great hope! What great Grace! Hallelujia ... we will meet again.  All the best,  -- Don

      Funny thing ... about a week ago, I got the idea to trade in my Spyder for a small SUV. Something that can haul my surfboard, mountain bike or kayaks (that's "kayaks", plural, Matt ... I'm getting one for my wife).  I gave the Saab to my son, so I'm without a car that can haul stuff. Besides, I think I scratched my sports car itch.  Stay tuned.

      Got the word at work yesterday that times are tough and I'm being forced to take another pay cut. Ugh. That's 55 percent cut in the past two and a half years.  *sigh*  If you know of anyone looking for a CIO, IT Director, Software Architect or contract development, let me know ... please.  don.schenck@gmail.com  Thanks, and all the best,  -- Don

      I went golfing with my son-in-law this past Saturday evening. Crossgates, at Millersville.  Nice course. Very hilly. Extremely hilly. But not the toughest course in the world.  So I hadn't golfed in two or possibly three years, and didn't have very high expectations.  Started off bad. On the first tee, I drove the ball just left of center, toward the green. But it wasn't until we drove down course that I realized that the fairway went toward the right and then did a slight dogleg back to the left. Oops. So instead of being on the left of the fairway, I was in the rough. Not what I intended.  I managed to right myself and struggle to a very bad first hole. But at least I had one under my belt, and was about to enjoy some time with my daughter's husband.  We continued. I won the next hole. Good ... confidence building.  As we played, the day melted away into the evening, while the moist summer air moved in from the south. It threatened to rain but didn't. But it was very humid and uncomfortable. The blister on my thumb was painful, but I pushed it out of my mind. I wanted to hit the ball well.  As we played the holes by the creek, we were amazed at how the water had risen. It's been a terribly rainy season, the drought of two years ago now a distant, soggy memory.  As we moved on, I couldn't believe how I was playing. It had been three years, but I was surprising myself. Was  this  really my level of skill? I surprised myself.  Drivers ... irons ... the short game ... putts (my, the green were so fast!) ... golfing's more than just "grip it and rip it". It's the only game where you penalize yourself.  Finally, we tallied up the score. I was flabbergasted! I did a double-take at my score.  75!  The worst nine holes of my life.  All the best,  -- Don

      Homeland Security ... Patriot Act ... that's  nothing  compared to  urlLink this fiasco .  I cannot believe this. I cannot believe that something like this happened in the United States of America. Yet, I should not surprised. I mean, we have companies being enlisted as an arm of law enforcement (aka drug testing at work), we have states such as Pennsylvania where  you cannot own property  (you are required to rent it from the state government), and on and on.  Washington, Jefferson, et al must be turning over in their graves.  All the best,  -- Don

      Can you believe  urlLink this?   Somehow, for some strange reason, this is funny to me. I know it shouldn't be ... but I can just see some shadowy guy, in a dark alley ...
