      Well, today i went out with Chiou Pyng. It is kind of funny at first. I was kind of hoping that she is the kind of cute girl that&nbsp;i always wanted. But i was disappointed. She has pretty eyes, big and bright eyes. However it doesnt really matches her face. And something extra, she doesnt really have nice body shape. We went to Popular to buy some books at first, then we met Shueh Hao. He is the kind of annoying guy that i hate a lot. Then she went to meet her friend and i went to see some posters. Then she, her friend and i, went to buy posters together. Well we went to her friend's working place to buy. It was kind of embarassing there. Her friend thought that i was her boy friend. And we picked a lot of things together. Her friend, i thk she is called Qiu Ling or what so ever. Chiou Pyng kind of held my arms when we were going through tides of people. It was kind of embarassing for me and her. Well i tried to hold her arms nearer to me, she loosened her hand though. Explaining. Hahaha. After that, we went to the arcade. We met her classmates there. So funny.

      Finally, my team Diablos, won at least 1 match. We had a very good game against Scavengers. They are indeed a strong team. However just lack of a little luck. Well Jing Chung's team won Chong Beng's team. There are four teams in the semifinals, they are - Zhen Xing, LA 6ers, Councilor Unit and Revenge. I think the team that will win the champion, will be Revenge. However, they will not be at their full power as their four school team members, are banned from the games. As the rules stated, one team can only have 2 school team members or so. Well Zhen Xing claimed that they were not at their peek performance before semifinals, let us wait and see what Ming Chew will do on his team. LA 6ers, which plays dirty strategies, will have trouble. Councilor Unit will have a great chance as there are many ex- school team members, like Soo Thing, Heng Wei and Ge Ren. Well may the best win.

      Well at this time of the year, July, it will be our school's PIBG Cup Basketball Tournament. We actually need to form our own team, find players to enter, and then order jerseys to compete with other teams. We have about 12 teams this time. 6 in each group. A group, which is also m\y team's group, can be counted as the Death Group. Well, we have Ming Chew's(a state player, centre) team, a combination of outside shooters and a great lansi centre. The next team, will be Jing Chung, the super handsome cutter guy in our school. His team is packed with tall people like Guang Beng and Alvin. Then it will be our team, of course it will be me!!! Haih~~~&nbsp;I know I suck, but give me a little bit of face, at least i am the best in my team. hahaha. Another strong team, will be Chun Kee's team. He is the best shooter in CLHS, and his team is strong too. Packed with tall and speedy people. Another good team, will be Hello Kitty!!! Don't get me wrong, there is really this team. Chong Beng, Qiang Yao and Chan Ren are the aces in this team. The last team, which everyone hates, will be the form 6 team. They play cheat, play dirty. Everyone hates them. Now I will post up all the results of the group. Ming Chew's team = Zhen Xing, Jing Chung's team = Mystics, Cody's team = Diablos, Chong Beng's team = Hello Kitty, Chun Kee's team = JKR, nonono, i mean Scavengers, Form 6 team = LA 6ers.  Diablos vs Hello Kitty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Diablos lost 2 points Diablos vs LA 6ers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; --- Diablos lost 21 points Diablos vs Zhen Xing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; --- Diablos lost 2 points Diablos vs Mystics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;--- Diablos lost 2 points Diablos vs Scavengers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- 3pm, 22th July, CLHS Basketball Court Hello Kitty vs Zhen Xing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Hello Kitty lost 58 points Hello Kitty vs LA 6ers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Hello Kitty lost Hello Kitty vs Mystics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Hello Kitty lost Hello Kitty vs Scavengers&nbsp; &nbsp;--- Hello Kitty lost LA 6ers vs Zhen Xing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;--- LA 6ers won 2 points LA 6ers vs Mystics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- LA 6ers won 11 points LA 6ers vs Scavengers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- LA 6ers won 18 points Mystics vs Zhen Xing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- Mystics lost 5 points Mystics vs Scavengers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;--- Mystics won Zhen Xing vs Scavengers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;--- Zhen Xing won 7 points
