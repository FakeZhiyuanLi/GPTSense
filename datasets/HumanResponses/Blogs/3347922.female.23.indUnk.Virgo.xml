      I've finally decided to put Kay, Diamond, Cres and lil cCes in the past where they belong.  Letting go for me is a hard thing to do.  But with the help of God as the author and finisher of my faith. Plus, me steadily motivating, pushing and encouraging myself I know that this blog will be a blessing and NOT a curseing to my life.  This book was created with the intentions of letting go and finally letting the healing process begin.  This book is intended for helping me bring forth suppressed thoughts, wishes, past failures and desires.  This blog was not intended for me to hold onto the memories and slip in some type of sucidial depression. THE DEVIL IS A LIAR!  "Four souls inner-changed within me..."

      Wow... it's been almost a month since my life has changed forever. Whew, inhale xhale... n its just like dat. Tormented by a vision a memory that use to be me//us//we. I see her pictures in my head and on the net and its just still like wow. WoW cus its ova and wow cus that was my past... my history. It's crazy yo, to feel like you have loved a thousand loves in and through one person. To one day wake up and see she's not the person you thought she was. I'mma trip off dat one for a lil min. Ion know why he did it. was it cus of the prayers i prayed as a kid? was it cus of the prayers my fam and friends prayed. was it cus of my spirit man and how it cried out? What Made GOD decide within himself to take me out of my personal hell// delusional heaven? i mean i prolly could of lived in that hell for a few more months... ion know. It hurts to know that i'm no longer able to know what goes on in the life of my ex otha half.   Soul ties... STD's... whew whatever you call it. It's tryin to hold onto a sista with a lock. it's crazy almost driving me insane... i'm not gonna give in! I'm stronger and she's stronger. I realize that at that time we found what we had been lookin for through each other. AT THAT TIME. But GOD has taken his rightful spot and she continues to look for something to fill her GOD spot.. not only her GOD spot but the dull ache that i left. (i could cry) but i will not anymore.  After the many convos about GOD and how he helped me get ova the really rough spots with her, I sincerely hope she lefts him do the same. I got so much on my plate, i really don't even know what to focus on... Christ... im back at that don't know what else to say just say Jesus. I trust GOD with my life (its hard)... i trust GOD with her life(thas really hard) but i know... if i continue in His will for my life... he will blessed the desire of my hart and that is for her to be made whole, for Him to save her soul and for us to talk about the goodness of GOD together atleast once.   He is something so genuine. To be like Jesus... something truthful, something real, and just genuine.   Current Mood:  calm Current Music: be me.. and some gospel jamz

      iono... it seems like wednesdays are the night, i seem to cry out most to GOD. "if you really love me, if you really cant live without me.. why you only call me when you need me..." that song just sings and digs deep into my spirit. who am i? who is me? T aka star. I feel like beyonce a lil bit... lol "in the end all i have is me myself and i." well of course J.Christ... too fa sho.  iono where i'm going with tonites post. i'mma come real. let some peeps see it and see what comes of it.   blah. i'm blank my mind is in a daze... amazed at the circle that i have almost completed. it must be midnight. i'm a push away from the edge. I'm so glad for knowledge... its my keeper. (truth.. the spirit of truth rather) He... he holds me close to him. i feel like that dude in the footprints poem.. i am not walking GOD is so carrying me.   whew, the thoughts are there but they are captive maybe its good... dont wanna spill the beans and give the devil and in... i feel many things at the moment (known for which i care to share) i'm in this whole daze like.. ion care... ion care... i REALLY JUST DONT CARE... CANT U SEE I DONT CARE. well leave me alone then. yeah thas where i am.  i got ppl whispering things in my ear, into my spirit, and jus tellin me in general... oh by the way incase u didn't know this is a blog of a ex lesbian... yup.. i'mma ex. not jus an ex but the head ex in some cases. change? choice? yes change is possible. yes it is a choice. umm hum but back on point. GOD. when u cant find the words to say just say JESUS. yeah...   i wanna talk a lil about an experience that i had to endure and i'm fa sho uncertain how i did it.. (lookin at GOD). i was MADLY in love with this female... yup, stone cold crazy about her. i mean she... wow. she was my world.. erithing i did revolved around her... which is crazy i mean we was only together for 4 months and we was only in the physical presence of each other a month out of all them months we was together. well anyways, we had something. it was kind of special to me. i cherished it BUT as a human i had to ruin it. i tell ya truthfully... through her i realized alot of things that love was not and i realized alot of things it was. and THEN i realized to have the real thing i'd have to leave her and seek it out... lol. many ppl who know my story only see her side of it. das cool u know... ur intitled to ur own opinion but know this... (opinions... they are like armpits.. we all have em but some of em stink) so on with the thoughts... i gave this girl pretty close to my all in all. i mean we was on a level i thought i'd never get to know.  yeah the devil had me trapped in a real good illusion... but i was dieing inside, i was trapped, i was bound, i was chained... wild harts can't be broken. As much as i wanted and felt i needed to be with her.. being with her was killing me... spiritual, mentally, and in some instances physically. GOD being the awesome GOD that he is.... saw my pain.. saw my hart... saw i wanted to do right but i just wasnt strong enough. he let the devil put her in arm's way... lol. (kind of wanna cry... gotta laugh so i wont) yeah he took his hand off of her for a min...  that was then and this is now... months later.. not just months but almost a year since our break-up. i sit here.. STILL being tempted by her (in eri way shape and form but physically) finally finally i took her out of my equations... and now i jus deal with the memory of her and the absence of her instead of her presence. what does the fortune cookie say... "absence makes the hart grow fonder" its tru if u let it.  GOD delivered me, he healed me, he took this weight.. these chains.. this spirit that torments me off of me. and i.. let her smooth talk her way back into my life. to sit her tormented, with a weight on me again. i'm telling you i'm feeling like a brian mcknight song... which one?? all of em. lol (FOR REAL)   but here is the tricky part. i'm in some way shape/ form whatever responsible for alot of other ppl. how many? the numbers say 95 but i'm thinking... 75 (he he he) yeah that ain't right huh? naw it is. whew.. okay how can i explain the rest. point blank. this chick was it... end all to be all.. THE ONE (period) we was on some... we gone be together  type stuff. she lol. she's funny.. i mean chick was like silent when i asked her if she was willin to go to hell for me. then when i broke up with her oh oh oh THEN she was willing... rofling. i still laugh about that almost a year later. but the big picture is why do i bring her up?? this is my test.. my torment... my temptation. man i'm not moved by females. mental stimulation (fa sho) but can't no female get me on some... puttin her on a pedestal type joint the way the ex did.i let the unecessary occur. so now i gotta change clothes and move around. but i think GOD for the fact that i no longer will be able to say.. "i got 99 problems and she's all of them plus one." Praise GOD for the lil things, u kno.  squash all dat and lets get on some real stuff. is it me? or is it that ppl only want me for my pimp juice? the anointing its a most powerful thing. it makes ppl expect more from me then (i think) i'm able to give at this point. I'm in spiritual warefare like u wouldn't believe in my mind. and i cant blame anyone but me. I got alot on my plate. and i'm trying to give up the plate to GOD.. but im slowly grabbin stuff back off the plate. lol. I thank GOD for the women of GOD who have motivated me and pushed me to the next level. cus things aren't looking good buddy. houston we have a problem. the biggest test to date.. and i know if i dont do something i'm going to fail it miserably. let go. i gotta learn how to just let Go... and LET GOD... build a bridge n get ova it.  my thoughts are so jumbled... lol. oh well... i pray the best for the one whose hart i broke. she lookin for love n ALL the wrong places... and its fustrating me and hurting me to watch her do so. but its in GOD's hands now.. she has her own testimony to create. I believe she will get it together...  i really do. GOD knows thats the desire of my hart. he wont fail me in this. she will fail me (eritime) but he wont. so i cant wait for the day we cross paths again.. and she's an awesome women of GOD. nhale-xhale. yup. i want that so desparately. i've known many forms of pain but the worse pain i have ever felt was leaving her in the state i left her in. watching her pull the peices back together to have a pretty screwed up picture anyways. n dat hurts too.. knowin the part i played n all this. all the things i did. all the times i had to apologize. how i fustrated her trust.. her love. this is something i have a hard time dealing with.. forgivin myself for the way i hurted the one i claim to love. i wished death on her life. i'm always prayin asking GOD to restore her back to life.. and in the heat of the moment.. i do the unthinkable.   we are... it is... in GOD's hands now. i must put aside what i'm going through and focus on the vision GOD has given me. I GOTTA LEAVE THEM LESBIANS i kick it wit occasionally alone. they trying to speak homosexuality back into my spirit. THE DEVIL IS SO A LIE. if i wasnt so smart i'd play dumb like i did in high school.. and do it all over again... NOT. i pitty the fool who lets anyone talk them into.. back into... or stayin in the deathstyle aka homosexuality.  changing clothes for 2004... one day.. one moment at a time.

      Finally finally... It seems my thoughts are censored, if i speak to much then i give the devil too much credit. oh no it wont be that! It seems also that certain ppl in my life. think they know me... man i'm with moet on this one... angels and devils look alike to me. its the ones that you love the most who often hurt you the most. bet on that can't trust nobody, i have no friends. just JESUS! inhale-xhale... ((suckin teeth)) it ain't easy being Tizzy. I got yet anotha health scare, which will be yet anotha testimony. i'm only 20 years old and if you would of told me at 12 that i would have more strangers pickin and prodding at me then i'd know what to do with... yeah what i was thinkin back then, i really would of been thinkin. GOD has been there the only constant figure on my life. more constant then my mia father... and my stay at work mother. a lil resentment? not really... i let it go but i mean the past is the past they did what they did. and i became what i was ... and i am who i am now. alot of ppl up on this (she aint changed stuff) lmbo.... you couldn't do what i do EVEN if you tried... I can barely live the life that i've been giving. DO YOU KNOW BEING A SAINT IS HARDER THEN BEING AN AIN'T/Sinner? DUDE, i could cry... but you are my dwelling place, my father, i will rest in you, i will trust you, i love you... you are the real real... YOU ARE GOD ALONE.   its kind of hard to be negative after that... so i won't. i love GOD. I really do, and nothing not life, nor death, nor powers to come, powers that be, NOTHING (let me reiterate) NOTHING shall EVER separate me from the love of GOD. you fa sho with it. SO yeah i'm on hell's hot list... I'm wanted in hell for the destruction of his kingdom and you know what? I like it. that has been my dream since 13 to destroy the devil's kingdom. I was a lil young for thoughts like that? I always knew i was special. Especially when i had my date with the devil... one day i'll get up on this joint and tell my testimony... until then GOD bless and peace be still....   Just wanna serve you (Lord) only!  makin em inhale-xhale (WHAT!)   Current Mood: in spiritual warfare. Current Music: serve you only by joann rosario

      SELFISH... ITS A WORD I GET TO HEAR OFTEN. IN REFERENCE TO ME. I WAS SELFISH WHEN I BROKE UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND THE DAY SHE HAD A CAR ACCIDENT. I WAS SELFISH WHEN I PUSHED HER OUT OF MY LIFE. I WAS SELFISH WHEN I DECIDED TO GIVE CHRIST MY LIFE AND DENY THE PLETHORA OF FEMALES THE CHANCE TO LOVE ME AND BREAK MY HEART OF VICE VERSA. I WAS SELFISH WHEN I HAD PROBLEMS AND I BACKED AWAY FROM MY GROUP AND TODAY AGAIN I'M SELFISH. BECAUSE AFTER COUNTLESS PEOPLE TOLD ME. "HOW CAN TWO WALK TOGETHER LEAST THEY AGREE" SO... AFTER MUCH PRAYER GOD GAVE ME THE STRENGTH TO BEGIN LETTING GO OF THE FRIEDNS WHO MEANT ME NO GOOD (IN THE VERY END). I'M SELFISH, INSANE, CONFUSED, LOST, AND HOPELESS. I HAVE NO ONE IN MY LIFE SAYING STAR, I'M PROUD OF YOU. YOUR DOING A GREAT THING. KEEP THE FAITH GOD IS PROUD OF YOU. ALL PEOPLE SEE IS THAT I'M SELFISH. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ITS FAR MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE CHRIST IN MY LIFE THEN THERE FRIENDSHIP. HOW CAN THE CLAY SAY TO THE POTTER YOU MADE ME WRONG? I'M TIRED, I'M FUSTRATED, AND THIS IS A EVERYDAY STRUGGLE. CONSTANT INNER BATTLING TO KEEP ON. NOBODY KNOWS ME... I DONT EVEN KNOW MYSELF ANYMORE. AM I GROWIN IN CHRIST OR AM I DIEING INSIDE?   EVERYTIME I GO TO CHURCH THE BISHOP LAYS HANDS ON ME AND PRAYERS FOR ME. (LORD KNOWS I COULD USE THE PRAYER) GOT THE DEVIL ATTACHIN ME ON EVERYSIDE AND I HAVE NO FRIENDS. NOPE, NOT EVEN ONE. NOBODY WHO JUST TRULY BELIEVES IN THE GOD IN ME AND THAT I'M DOING WHATS RIGHT FOR ME? I GAVE UP THE WOMAN (I THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME I WOULD SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH) TO BE LEAD OF THE LORD TO HELP OTHERS LIKE ME. I'M SELFISH. COUNTLESS TIMES I WANTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BUT I KNEW GOD HAD A PURPOSE AND A PLAN FOR MY LIFE SO I STAYED THAT THROUGH ME OTHERS WOULD HAVE THE SEED PLANTED SO THEY COULD BE SAVED. I'M FUSTRASTED, UPSET, AND HURT. BECAUSE AS THEY SAID... I'M SELFISH.  IF I'M SO SELFISH MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE UP THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH AND DO WHAT I WANT TO DO... GO BACK TO BEING GAY OR BISEXUAL WHATEVER COMES FIRST. SEE HOW LIFE PANS OUT FOR ME THEN. SINCE I'M SO SELFISH I'LL PROLLY COMMIT SUICIDE. CUS I'M SELFISH AFTER ALL. I'M BETTER THEN THAT AND I'M STRONGER THEN THAT. I'M A SURIVIOR, I'M STICKING WITH WHAT I KNOW. JESUS. NOTHING BUT SWEET JESUS.   I HAD A FRIEND RIGHT A SONG ABOUT "BEING ME" SHE SHOUTED ME OUT ON THE SONG. TOLD ME TO SHAKE THE HATERS OFF AND JUST DO ME. LIKE SHE SAID... I JUS WANNA BE ME... CAN A GIRL BE ME... CAN I PLEASE BE ME? SO MANY PEOPLE WANT ME TO BE WHO THEY SEE ME AS. MILITARY, PARENTS, OTHERS, FREAKIN STRANGERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY GOD. LIKE I SAID YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A STRUGGLE IS UNTIL YOU LIVED IN MY SHOES. I'M NOT JUST A WOMAN, I'M NOT JUST A WOMAN OF GOD, BUT I'M AN ANOINTED WOMAN OF GOD WHO HAS A CALLING A PURPOSE AND A PLAN PLACED ON HER LIFE. I'M A LEADER FOR CHRIST. SO WHAT PURPOSE DOES LIGHT HAVE WITH DARKNESS? MY ONLY SOLACE, MY ONLY TRUE FRIENDS, I FOUND THEY WERE LIVING THE LIFE I NOW USE TO LEAD. THE ONLY ONES WHO UNDERSTOOD ME. THE ONLY ONES WHO TRULY TRIED TO "BE THERE" TO HELP ME. YET THEY ARE THE ONES I HAVE TO RUN MY BACK ON. WHAT KIND OF SENSE DOES THAT MAKE? FOR SOME CHRISTIANS WHO DON'T KNOW ME FROM ADAM, THEY CARE ABOUT ME EVEN LESS AND THEY NEVER TOOK THE TIME OUT TO JUST BE THERE. SUCKS.. LIFE IS ALL KINDS OF SCREWED UP.   BUT ITS ALL GOOD... CUS AS USUAL I RAGE, RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT. I RAGE OUT AND FIGHT AGAINST THE CHAINS THAT ARE TRYING TO BE BROUGHT BACK ON ME. I'M SPIRITUALLY FREE.   MY ONLY FRIEND... GOD THE FATHER, GOD THE SON, AND GOD THE HOLY GHOST FOR WHICH NONE WILL EVER COME BEFORE THEM. SELFISH? FOR THEM ILL BE THAT.

       and the one my flesh wants.   God, I say your the greatest light of my life.  It's been and continues to be the fight of my life to get at you.  It's going to be the fight of my life to grow in you. Tonight at church the Bishop said something so profound.  Basically he said that if you still hanging around homosexuals your still gay, if your still hanging around crackheads your still a crackhead. It really caught me off guard but it did catch my attention.  I mean I don't know anybody else that was at church tonight who was/is dealing with homosexuality otha then me. He gave us some really great scriptures to grab ahold to.  I know fa sho they are going to help me.   His or Mines: Wants, Needs and Desires...   I am the clay he is the potter he wants to make me and mold me HIS way but first i must allow him to have his way.  Things between us truly can't work out until my desires become his desires for me also.  Whoever said living for the Lord would be easy.. LIED.  Ain't nuttin easy bout taking up my cross and following him.  Daily I die, daily I sacrifice: my wants, needs and desires and submit myself to him.  I give of my self in every aspect of my life.  My finances, my time, and my talents.  I've sacrificed friendships, relationships and things i wanted to do for myself.  Sometimes it can be pretty fustrating but I know in my KNOWER,  Jerermiah 29:11 is whats up.  Although it seems as if God is a selfish God and he only wants what he wants for me.  I know in my knower that His will for my life is better than anything i can imagine.  No matter how much it may hurt to give up things and people, if i do it as he asks of me, in due time he'll make it easier he always does.  I might have to cry sometimes but Jesus is worth it.  His not worried about the path some much as the end of the race.  If i follow his will my end will lead to eternal life but if I follow my choices then my end will lead to a second death and eternal damnation.  I think I might wanna choose Christ.  Jesus...Tweety... Star...Whose will First??  After much thought and consideration with prayer.  I came into the knowledge of why we couldn't be friends.  It was right there in my face but I chose to ignore it.  Friday I could no longer igonre the truth.  So I went to her and told her and she didn't disagree.  We somehow still have feelings for each other.  Um... I...we... yeah... we still aren't talking she thought it would be best if we did keep our distance(she didn't want too) but she felt it was best.  I felt the same and God has eased the pain of it (thank you JESUS).  Made it much easier to do.  Maybe oneday... oneday sweet day we will be able to be friends in a normal natural way.  Until then God only knows...  God's will is good, acceptable and perfect.   NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.   Love is obedience and sacrifice... that's what love means to me.  I love him enough to trust him and obey and i love her enough to sacrifice our friendship for his will for our lives.   Destiny... my destiny and the distractions   Their are so many things that can distract a person from there destiny.  Sickness, proverty, opression, depression, and addictions.  Sometimes it gets hard, distraction comes, torment comes do you face it do you run?  So many distractions to my destiny... so many distractions to my purpose.  Psalms 139... whew what else David says you are a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.  If I seek FIRST the kingdom of God ... seek it FIRST, all things shall be added unto me.  So much is going on in the atmosphere... so much is going on in my life... i don't understand but I just say yes to his will, no matter what it is.  Church was awesome today and it's time for me to grow up.  Destiny and the distractions to it.... Questions...Questions... please answer my questions...  Thought of the day: If you love something or someone with your whole heart and your whole being and it's not God (trust, if you suppose to be a christian and your not married to that person...)chances are your going to have to give them up!

       I hate the thought of me having feelings for females.    I'm so sick of it all of it.  The torment, the lustful feelings, the unnatural desires, the smell, the memories, and the vain dreams that he torments me with.  I hate it all.  I hate being drawn to women, I hate not knowing how to act around them, I hate the fact that I get nervous and I don't know what to say, I hate being tormented, I hate being called gay, I hate people saying your still gay you haven't changed, I hate having to loose friends because somehow we let the devil slip in.  I hate it all... Why? Why? did I ever have to be gay? Out of all the millions of billions of trillions plus people who have never been gay or even let the thought cross there way why me?  why?  why?  why?  I mean could it be possible that someone in my family or close to my family rubbed this demon off onto me?  Why can't I shake this demon... why won't God take this cup from me. Maybe I was born this way? No that can't be it... that thought isn't even okay.  But I mean we were born into sin, so maybe this is my sin to face.  People can tell that something is different about me.  That some demon is on me trying to get back his "supposed" rightful place.  Ugh, I could scream, I could cry, I can sleep it off but sleep is no better then being awake.  Being awake is no better then being sleep.  I'm just here mindless in a daze, amazed at the sights and lights i've been blessed to see.  It's times like these that I need Jesus to come comfort me.  To reassure me that this is his will, reassure me that it's over and I'll never go back again.  To reassure me that there won't be anotha female trying to tempt me back into this lustful.  To reassure me that one day tweety and I could maybe finally be friends. Why... why... Why... but I don't wanna question God, You say I could pick your brain if I pick your book up.  I did and James 1:13-14 is what you gave me.  I realize what went wrong, I realize where I sinned but come on' why can't we be friends.  I hated being gay... I hated being me... right now my life isn't the best... there's nothing great about being me. If i can learn to accept the things i cant change, and learn to never question God maybe I'd be better off.  Maybe so but not today.  i hate the thought of me being gay.  I hate the thought of those who dismissed my claim and said i was never this way and i hate the fact that there are those who still claim I'm gay.  I'm chilling cus trust I don't wanna be this way.

       It's suppose to get better, NOT worse.   Tell my storm that because it obviously didn't catch the sticky tab.  Maybe it was time for the storms of life to rise up, I mean lately things have been pretty good.  Finances were finally coming around, I found the car I wanted, no more women trying to tempt me, and the devil seemed quieted.  HUMMM... Now all seems to be wrong with the world.  This requires the insight of Romans 8:28 All things work together for the good of those who love the Lord who are called according to his purpose. What the devil meant for bad God meant for good.  And when all else fails this is (another one of) my Job experiences...the devil is praying for me.  But like JOB though he slay me; yet will i TRUST in him SURELY i will defend my ways to his face.  I will NOT curse God to his face...I TRUST YOU LORD.  Jesus said cast your cares on me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.  God knows what I have need of even before I know.  I know that to live is Christ but to die is gain.  I just have to sacrifice a little more.  I won't cry... I won't let the devil see me sweat.    Maybe I'm just in line for my next blessing   I was rather restless last night, my counselor suggest I read this book called "pure desires".  So I finally started last night after a few pages (as usual) I turned over and fell asleep. I went to sleep after 6 woke up after 11 (I guess).  Didn't lay my head to the bed again until after 3. Where I struggled to get out until after 7.  In the midst of it al, maybe somebody might guess it.  But I had a dream... what? Iono but like the past few days Ms. Tweety was on the mind and in the dream. The devil gonna try to fake her voice and tell me to call her at 2 in the morning (I must have stoopid on my forehead).  I think okay what's really going on.  Now my "twinny twin" enchante2004[on here], told me that the reason why I feel like there is a void in my life is because she was filling my Godspot.  Lord please forgive me for that, I certainly wasn't trying to give her your place.  I mean... just gotta really be careful.  As someone who use to be a lesbian I must be careful who I get close too.  I mean we are drawn to each other.  In absence just like in presence... but you know what things was better with us being friends then they are now that we are apart.  I hope she takes comfort in what I told her.   "Let it burn...God's will is good, acceptable and it's perfect."   Last night was all together really weird... I don't do r&b but I was really feeling Usher's Burn and Anita Baker's I apologize.  Maybe that opened the door for the enemy to do what he did last nite.  All I know is he was talking, he was there, and I can't act like he doesn't exist cus I know...  Just like Jesus is REAL so is the devil.    To everything there is a season.   No point on dwelling on the past or worrying about the present.  Matthew 6 is whats up!   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all things shall be added unto you!   It's my time to emerge in my relationship with God.  It's my time to get my gear out of neutral and put it back into drive.  Work on my book(s), get more active in my church, fa sho get more personal with God, and work on my personal appearance and health.  I'm not a stud anymore so my walk, talk, and posture should show that. My season for being a lesbian is over.   My season for hanging around chickens is over... It's time to soar with eagles.   I'm more then a conqueror.      The Prayer of Jabez.     Oh God Bless me indeed, enlarge my territory, let your hand be with me at all times, keep me from harm so that i may be free from pain. and God granted him his request.   The Prayer of Jabez   1CHRONICLES 4:9-10   I'm not one who was big into the prayer of Jabez.  I'm sorry I mean, that worked for him, yeah it can work for me too but how I know that's what God wants for me at this time?  But I was feeling the song in my spirit by D.Lawrence today so I was just singing it and listening to it.  The one part that really caught my attention was  "God keep your hand upon me so that no evil may not harm."   I really felt that in my spirit,  I NEED Jesus to be a fence all around me.  When this lady that goes to my church came to my job yesterday she told me a story about this guy who went to a Joyce.Meyers conference with his wife.  The Lord opened his eyes and he saw angels encamping around Joyce.  It really softened his heart towards God.  Hearing that story really increased my faith, it ministered to me [even if she doesn't know it].  But I do know I was able to minister to her and be a blessing to her.   You can tell a true leader, when...   For one they have the natural abilities.  When they don't won't the burden.  But just because your a true leader that doesn't mean you are effective.  I've shied away from that but I'm seeing God drawing me back in other ways.  I don't know how I feel about this but I'll just put it out there.  I feel kind of upset when People don't respect me for the God in me or the anointing on my life.  But at the sametime... it annoys me when I feel like people are around me only to steal my pimp juice (anointing).  Touching on me hoping it will rub off or something.  I guess in the smaller scheme of things that's another reason why I shied away from God.  That and the fact that I don't feel ready to bare this cup.  I've been feeling that way since 13.  I just push it away... and he just pushes it back.  Saturday I will take on full responsibility.  I'll be 21 no more excuses, no more games, no more ignorance. I've had 8 years to play the fool.  It's my season.  When I was 13 I hated life... I mean I literally hated MY life.  I wanted to die, I had thoughts of suicide and I've even attempted, came close once[but God].  I use to cry myself to sleep praying GOD don't let me live past 21. In 2 days I'll be 21.  I've never really thought life out past 21 cus I never hoped to make it past that point.  So may 30 is going to be the first day of the best days of my life.   I've already got it in my mind that my birthday is going to be calm and I'm happy with that.  But after may 30 the best is only YET TO COME.  I ain't seen nuttin yet.   Thought for the day:    If we are so busy focusing on what is wrong with our lives then we will miss out on the little things that are good about our life.

       Tweety...Kay...Tweety...K   They seem so inner-mingled or entwined.  I remember right before I met Tweety I was still dealing with some issues with Kay.  Then I met Tweety and I like forgot about Kay.  Then it became Tweety and Kay... Then we ended the friendship and it was just Kay again.  Kind of the same thing now, Tweety is gone and so now the torment via Kay begins again.  I mean seriously, I couldn't even get a break of atleast one day.  But nope the devil on his job (as usual) right there tormenting me with thoughts of Kay.  Then for extra measure slipping in thoughts of Tweety.   Maybe I was wrong for thinking that we could be friends maybe like forever. I mean I've never even seen this chick [just a photo] she's in cali and i'm in arkansas. How much damage could a close knit long distance friendship really impact us.  I guess more then we will ever know.  I do realize if we try to be friends at this point that would be a selfish act.  We just wanted to be friends and nothing more.  But God [being the creator of us all] can do what he like, he can say "it is finished" and we have to accept and agree and move away from each other.  Maybe just maybe we may not ever meet, but we will see each other on tv.  Then finally we will see what does end up happening to each other. I'm just like God You know what's best.  We had to do what's been done.  Even though it wasn't what we wanted, it's what we needed.  Tweety and I got a close knit relationship, I believe in absence just like in presence we'll always wonder and kind of know how the other one is doing.  Since I'll prolly never see, hear from or talk to eitha one of them again.  I pray they become whatever it is that God has called them to be. In Jesus matchless name, Amen.   All alone again.   I've come to realize this is my season of solitude.  Just Christ and me.  I can't keep any close knit friendships.  Thank you Father.   Such an Honor and a privilege to be in the presence of the king...   So I'm just going to take time away to get into the presence of the king. -Star   B 1152   His will is good and acceptable...it's perfect.   I'm a photographer by trade.  Well I happen to be helping a friend out so i'm working in the studio.  There was only one morning studio and the lady happen to go to my church.  So she was going through something and the Lord used me to give her a word for her life.  Before she left I prayed for her and i just know that was so God.  The whole situation really increased my faith, God used me and I let him do it.  I spoke an ontime word into her life. The anointing a beautiful thing... the presence of the king... Priceless.  Last night I told one of my friends that I use to be a lesbian and it was kind of like a relief.  She knew I was dealing with something but she didn't know what.  Now she does.  It's funny how I'm like dealing with my own thing, kind of grieved about my own situation but in the midst of it all... God still used me to bless someone else.  It just goes to show that in the spiritual realm there really is no logic.  Now I could of let my situation distract me from giving her, her word from the Lord.  But praise be to God that I didn't.  E 1214

       and pressing towards what is ahead -Philippians 3:13   Paul said it so eloquently so easily as if it wasn't harder in action then it was in words.  But how do I not know that he didn't struggle to forget his past as one who was climbing fast and very high into the Jewish religion.  Today has been a weird day mixed, chopped up full of emotion.  Can life get any better then this? It can... it can... my mother's birthday was today.  I called her up and just talked with her for a minute.  She could sense in my voice that all was not right in my world.  I told her what happened and for once she didn't say anything.  No more I'm sick of you and these girls... No more when you gon leave gay girls alone.  Nothing at all... She just answered my question.  I said is this her way of saying its over without saying it? and she replied "yes."  I've really wanted to just dwell in my sorrows, dwell on my losts, and the emptiness my heart now feels. But the day has left me like... what's really going on. I went to work like 45 mins late, I walked around looking like I had lost my best friend [and in away I have] and for a second [I can't believe it, eitha] I cried.  I mean the tears formed, the eyes watered but not one tear fell from my eye.  How do you just get up and bounce back from a blow like this?   I just need to get somewhere and put my face to the flo'.    Ex-gays don't exist and the national health association.   Late last night I began to start getting e-mails about a Ms. Weaver who (apologized today) for her comments on ex-gays not existing.  Then I get more e-mails talking about national mental health association denies claims from pfox ex-gay.  So not that I even care about eitha one of these situations, I realize that this too is my battle to fight.   If one ex- same sex attracted person turns a deaf ear on this situation then there's one more gay person who won't.   Gays and lesbians are only 2% of the population but because they have came together in away that no other community has, they are really making an impact. The bible says 1 can slay a thousand, and 2 ten thousand.  The devil knows that unity is the key.  The Bible says  in Psalm 133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! Yet Christians, black people, men and women, and women an women haven't quite caught onto this idea.   UNITY  believe it or not its how things get done.  If the ex- ssa community could come together in unity like the glbt has MAN... the power of God could be so strong and God could show up and show out.  Now personally i'm not trippin off what all has happened. A little appauled but not trippin...  it's the end ya'll.   So this all has to come to past but I tell you this much I'm trying to be on my p and q's to please God.  The world doesn't know or love God and its sending little children to hell in a handbasket.  Changing the very nature of the family.  In Genesis 2 when God was done creating everything that he made he saw it and said that it was very good.  Now the world is in a worse shape then in the days of Noah.  Rainbow means what? NOT GAY PRIDE but a promise that the world will not be destroyed again by water but by fire.  I realize that broken homes are rapmant gay or str8.  I realize that gay people stay together usually for no longer then 5 years.  I also understand that heterosexual marriages have a short spand these days too.  But as Yolanda Adams sings in her song "What about the Children?"  I SEE how not having a father in my home impacted my life and know it does the same for others.  My bestfriend's mom is bisexual and she lives with her live in partner.  I SEE how it affected her she moved out with her boyfriend and now they just got married at the county courthouse.  It's like the BLIND leading the BLIND.  We can go on and on about how it's time to make that change... but nothing is gonna change.  Better read the books of Daniel, 1 John and Revelation.  Things aren't going to get better but worse.  So I'm chilling working on my personal relationship with God and when it's my time to shyne [I'll shine as bright as the western star]  With God deep down on the inside... i'mma be something like a untouchable.   I was created for such a time as this.   I'm just waiting for my time to shyne.    let it burn... God's will is good, acceptable and perfect.   Oh Lord help me say... YES to your will... YES to your way. I don't even understand, i can't quite put it together but I KNOW its working for my good. Through everyday through all my pain, when i'm down and out i'll say YES TO YOUR WILL. No matter what comes way.   James 1 13   Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 14   But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.   1 John 4:4   Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.  James 4:7   Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8   Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

      B 0831   You don't have to worry about a thang if your holy and righteous.   Many people just don't get how serious this thing is... I mean me staying away from sin [rather falling back into my old ways].  I take heart in knowing that when it came down to it, when I could of sinned I didn't want too.  I truly wanted to please him[God].  I mean tweety was like Sleep talking and I was just talking.  I want so much for him to be proud of me and the changes he has made in me.  I realize when I asked him to make me something beautiful it was going to take me coming out of myself; living out of the flesh and NOW in the spirit.    The devil was your best friend so of course it was easy to listen to him, but now your trying to listen to God and you can't distinguish the voices.   When I was told that on Sunday I was blown away.  It's true tho, I was decent at pleasing the devil and he still tried to kill me.  Yeah GOD has a lot of purpose for my life.  BUT a RELATIONSHIP w/ him is more important.  I've fell out of my love relationship with the Lord now I need to go GET MY LIFE BACK!  The devil tried to kill me but God's trying to give me eternal life.  I truly don't get whats up with the masses... God wants SO VERY MUCH to be the one we run too in our time of needs.  He wants soo much to just love on us and show us just how very much he loves us [Just how we are]. As we begin to know God, fall in love with God and his commands; we will see ourselves beginning to change.  Not because we HAVE too NO but because we want to please him.  Jesus said "He who keeps my commands is he that loves me."  People running around here talking about they love God and they sin religiously.  Yeah we sin everyday but we make the choice to sin.  When you are in God you are dead to sin.   It's my time!   My birthday is in 4 days...  it's Star's time to shine.   I give my heart, my mind, my soul and my very being to God's most perfect will.     Wanna get Rich QUICK? Want the GOOD LIFE?  TRY CHRIST! FALL into a love relationship with the Lord!   I have a vision of me... weak and frail but as I begin to seek God out through the word, prayer and fasting I become stronger.  I mean almost super human like big and strong, just muscles bulging everywhere [because no area of my life is unused by God].  The Bible says that He wants us to prosper as our souls prosper.   It's an honor and privilege to be in the presence of the king   I'm listening to my D.Lawrence greatest hits cd and track 12 [the presence of the king] my spirit was singing this song and so I began to play it.  I listened to the words and I let them minister to me.  Once again it all goes back to Psalms 27:4-6 [Being in the Lord's presence].  Nothing is more important to him then me spending time with him.  When I spend time with him I get so much... A peace that surpasses understanding, fullness of joy, healing, and so much more.  I've decided that in November when my contract is up, I'm going to get rid of my DSL.  That way I can go back to where I first loved him.  Get back to my roots... I love God oh my goodness so much.  Sunday night when I thought I was about to sin apart of me just wanting to run from God.  But he wouldn't let me and I just began to call on him, in this midst of my trying situation... I just began to talk about him.  The urges to sin began to cease and it really increased my faith.  It really just showed me just how much a situation can change when YOU bring God into it.  SO from now on, I'm going to tell my problems and situations about God and NOT tell GOD so much about my problems.  No more running to others I'm going to run to the maker of the heavens and earth, the ruler of the universe, the creator of man, my Lord and savior, my life giver- The King.  JESUS.   JESUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS   Thank you.  You didn't have to do it but you did.  You could of let me die, you could of killed me, you could of turned your face away from me.  But you exposed my sins, you exposed my weak areas, you exposed the enemies and you said give it to me, let me fix it.  When I was hurt, when I wanted to cry and die, you were right there holding me.  I felt your touch, I saw you in my spirit.  Even when the devil tries to confuse me and confound me into thinking you don't exist, I KNOW. I KNOW IN MY KNOWER THAT GOD IS A GOOD GOD AND JESUS DOES EXIST. You came down from Heaven to dwell in me, you came down from Heaven to work on me, to use me and call me your daughter in whom you were well pleased.  I never knew a love like this could exist before.  I searched for a love like this in woman [all along it was YOU].  I needed YOU. I NEED YOU.  I feel your presence, I feel your touch, I know how it feels to be in the presence of the king. Hallejuah, Hosanna in the highest.    E 1040  You've got to know in your KNOWER that you  can't replace Jesus with anything .   JESUS is the answer  and the cure to any addiction, sickness or situation.   STOP PUTTING JESUS IN A SMALL BOX WITH A BIG LOCK  and you only take him out when you get ready cus you need him.  STOP WAITING TILL MIDNIGHT TO CALL ON GOD. get in the presence of the king!

      So why am I  not  praying for myself?   ALOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THE WRONG PICTURE OF GOD.  To know God is to love him, to love God is to obey.  So if you really loved God you would obey his commands... to obey his commands you'd have to know him.  It's time to redeem the times.   Take me back dear Lord where I first believed!  B Recap:1200pm   Literati, Naval Command and Checkers ...  Who ever knew [mos def God] that playing games on yahoo would  almost  get me caught back up?  I didn't... I HAD NO IDeA. None whatsoever...  SO WHAT HAPPENED?  Well as I've already established I got this one friend and we are DRAWN to each other [since the beginning].  At first it was more so of a sexual nature, we use to flirt in between the lines and in the chatrooms and I mean... I wasn't by no means gay... I just was blinded for a sec [our friendship at that time only lasted for a week]. So back to REPRESENT DAY, Tweety and I... We've been friends I guess for almost a month now. The first 3 weeks were GOOD real GOOD.  NO NUTTIN [peace and tranquility]. However NOW 052404, everything is so questionable; I mean we are both going through and we find solace in each others company.  So we was on yahoo games last night. Playing "Literati" and umm the second game got kind of heated.  We had some r-rated/nc-17 rated words up on that board.  LET ME TELL YOU NOTHING HAPPENS BY HAPPENSTANCE.   We got played by the ultimate pimp, the devil. Now as much as I hate to say it things took a turn for the worse, Naval Command was cool but checkers...iono [confusion stepped in].  Almost was some strife going on... But we talked cleared the air and she logged off.  I call my homey shae and I'm telling her the bi-z.  We cracking up but in the back of my mind, tweety is on the brain and I couldn't, I just couldn't go to bed with things sore between us. So about 30 mins after she logged off I called her up to see if she was upset with me. Of course she gets all dramatic and is like umm no we aren't talking right now and I'm like uhh yes we is.  So she was half sleep mind you... matter fact before it was over she was on the phone snoring. But in between the pick-up and hang-up of our conversation.  Enticement/temptation/testing only for me was going on... cus she was cool doing her thing you know.  It was me that Had to call on the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost.  but I'm glad I did.  I almost sinned early this morning.  Something so innocent... has taken a turn for the worse... Jacky-o said it best "this friendship ain't looking to good. Get out! Get out NOW."  But if I did that... I wouldn't have all the great material for my book.  Not only that I refuse to loose this test or in this situation.  She was my temptation once[the only temptation I passed up] so of course it's test time again and YES class is in.  OH how did she end up back in my life.  Funny thing happened right... my great grandmother died and well I hit her up and it's been like kismit since baby.   Build a barn yard fire and throw me on it...   Why... Why... Oh Lord help me to understand WHY. We want our friendship to work/to last. I'm not trying to recreate past mistakes from my past. Can I just put the devil on blast and expose him for what he is?  Why must it seem like I fustrate the grace of God everytime because of him?  Why did he confuse the word with his 'Adam and Steve' lingo.  I mean can I win something, atleast a game of bingo?  I don't wanna go but I obviously can't stay.  This isn't the life I chose this isn't my price to pay. If I hadn't focused on your name and the same games I've been through before.  I'd be somewhere else right now with my face on the flo'.  Repenting for touching myself in that unnatural way, repenting for thinking of her in such an ungodly way and ready all along to be with her anyday, place or time.  My one true lover I kicked to the curb and prostituted myself one mo' time.  I need the strength to bare the cross I must face.  I need the strength to utter the words that gonna hurt.  To tell my buddy yo this drama has got to end.  I love you but I love him more and hey I'm not trying to sin.  You playing games and I can see right through your lies.  Your not serious your not focused on the prize.  The Lord said end it and I said just wait, you'll see.  I'll do better I'll be like you instead of me.  Now I feel confused and at a lost for words.  If I hadn't called on Jesus, I'd be saying GOD was for the birds.  But your word says "you'll never leave me nor forsake me."  Why can't I leave well enough of love and proved that I've been saved and allow you to work fully in my life.  Instead of going back to my mess I called my life.  The greatest deception I know this should be.  I'm going to work harder at focusing on you and forgetting about me.  I shoulda' listened.  Thank God... I'm still free.  Round 3 looks like its gonna be just you and me.  Tweety and Star for a season it will be.  E Recap:1236  B 1208pm   Carnal Knowledge   Like wo.... that's how i feel right now.  Tweety and I, we dialogued on what happened this morning.  She didn't remember a thing, so I kind of filled it in for her a lil bit.  She apologized and was like she was going to try harder next time. humm... no comment on that.  A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP W/ GOD  That is the rest of the years focus for my church, every sermon has been about that.  You would think after 4/5 sermons over pretty much the same thing i'd finally get mines together.  Well no, but I'm working something out.  I gotta hit the bed.  I went to sleep at 5 something and hopped back up at 7.  The word from the Lord was awesome if I only could of stayed awake and focused to hear it.  E 1212

       Any area in my life I'm NOT using dust has formed there.    Mark 12 30   And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.   Today's day... Sunday Beginning 9.09pm   TASHEMAAAAAAAAAAAAA   I've been holding out on this but today I must speak on it.  Someone I've known since I was like in middle school got into a really bad car accident last week.  I mean so bad she was thrown from the car.  She broke her neck in two places, broke her leg and had ecoli in her knee.  BUT BECAUSE A LOT OF SOMEBODY'S was praying for her she is making a speedy recovery.  They say her neck is going to heal on its own without the need for a full body brace. PRAISE GOD!!!! I'm for real when you believe in God, when you OBEY God, When you pray and seek God's face and NOT just his hand.  Whatever you ask of him, if its HIS will he'll make it happen.  He will show up and show out the bible says that he will open up the windows of heaven and pore you out a blessing you have not room enough to receive, the bible says that it will be pressed down, shaken together and still yet running over.  God just likes to show up and show out.  But people don't give him a chance much.  I choose God first and I'm going to give him that chance in my life... I want him to take me and make something beautiful out of it.  What can I say... He has my heart [but he doesn't have all of my heart].  I was completely muffled at lunch today.  After church we went out to G.C. to eat and I just began to ask Questions about God.  They was blown away by the seriousness and the capacity of the deepness of my questions. I mean I really had the desire, hunger and thirst for this knowledge.  Questions that I've wanted answers for since i was a kid... I finally GOT ANSWERS.  It only took oh about  9 years  to get the answer tho.  Hey I rather now at 20 then later at 45, feel me?  So as I sit here eatin my warm Micky D's apple pie. I realize I'm ONE answer closer to being brought into ALL TRUTH. Oh Thank You Lord!  Your So wonderful... Even when I don't deserve your grace, your mercy, or your blessings... YOU STILL WANNA DRAW CLOSER TO ME.  I feel you pulling but I know that if I come its gonna take everything I've got to be the person you see me as. Only those who know me, know that I'm really unhappy.  I mean my counselor thinks I'm depressed [it's not that bad].  I'm just fustrated and disappointed with myself.   JESUS YOUR MY ONLY ANSWER... ONLY YOU ARE THE ANSWER!   Revelation 12 11   And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.    That's my motivation... That and a lil John 8:32-36.   TWEETY  So while I was asking all my deep questions [I'm so deep they call me billy ocean.] I realized that this tweety and I thing.  It's not all that serious.  People come into our lives for a reason, a season or a lifetime. now very few people come into our lives for a lifetime.  I wish she could stay around for like forever.  But I'm sure by mid 05 (maybe sooner) we will out grow each other.  Now I've planted some seeds in her and I've seen them come to fruition.  But I believe we was only allowed to come together again for a season and do some more seed planting.  I'm her transition person to her next level in God.    Nothing happens by happenstance...Every persons presence in your life is for a purpose; rather it be for a reason, a season, or a lifetime...      DiD YoU eVER CoNSiDeR...  I use to run a group on yahoo for lesbians and reformed same sex attracted females to come together and learn and help each other.  Well one of them THANKED ME yesterday.  For bringing her her bestfriend.  [inhale-exhale] It's gonna take God to make people realize that what I did wasn't for nothing.  I've (all my life actually) brought people together in a crazy kind of way.  Whether I introduced them to there bestfriend or their next lover. STaR has unfortunately/fortunately been the middle man.  I just wish that oneday someone could do that for me.  But it's not my season for fellowship and close knit friendships.  God wants me ALL TO HIMSELF.  So people can't or don't stay around me to long and if they do they don't get too close you know.  I don't complain... Well I do concerning tweety cus its like I'm drawn to her and its not even sexual anymore.  It's like our spirits are knit but maybe like I said before I'm just puttin too much emphasis on nuttin. I dunno all I do know IZ.  I have no reason at all still battling the same issues that God delivered me from last year or the year before that.  I'm suppose to go from Glory to Glory.  Not do some Aaliyah back back forth and forth dramatics.  Which brings me back to the beginning for which I must go to get back closer to the Lord. [take me back dear Lord where I first believed].   People ask em why did I decide to give up the lesbian activities...  I mean I had a lot of reasons; God said it was finished, my girl had got into a serious car accident, I was tired/depressed/oppressed and suicidal, and the thing that pulled me out the fire the  most was I didn't want peoples blood on my hands.    I'm not gay and I don't care what YOU say!   Somebody always got something to say you know.  That's cool but I'm not feeling this one tho.  That's why I decided to keep it a secret [for the most part] that I use to partake in the lesbian "deathstyle". I'm already delivered [it's been a year] I'm just battling with some debri, some residue, some dust.  That don't make me no lesbian.  I put the word of God on it.   Whom the son has set free is truly free indeed.   HE said I WAS FREE and I believed it and received it [even tho I didn't want too at first].  Now if you think that is real then peep this.    John 6:65He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him."    It's not my will... But God's will that I be saved... It's not  your  will  but God's will  that you be saved.  This thing is so real. I gotta prayer I want to pray and then I'm out for the night.    Father God from whom all blessings flow... I thank you not for what you've done or what you're doing but just for who you are. I come to you seeking your face and not your hand.. Asking you to first forgive me of my sins known and unknown and help me to not do them anymore. I ask that you let your spirit of truth rest on me and that you bring me into all truths I ask that you give me understanding so that confusion cannot stand.  The bible says he that lacks wisdom ask of God who gives to all men liberal. David said you are a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.  Show me the way to you... Show me how to stay focused on you help me to draw closer to you for it is the desire of my heart. I give you my heart, my mind, my body and my soul for your glory alone... Make My Will Your will and make Your Will My Will.  I want my desires to be the desires you have for me and I don't want any dust in my heart anymore, I choose u!!!  In Jesus name I confess believe and pray... Amen    It's the end ya'll... 10.10pm

       2   And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3   And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.  --Genesis 2   After a trying thursday and a fustrating friday it was nice to have a slumber filled saturday.  Don't get me wrong there was some dramatics.  I still don't understand... My co-worker came over (which never happens) and I was on my computer talking to tweety.  Tweety makes a comment about her ex-gf and my co-worker all up in the screen talking about she gay! she gay! she gay! Going on and on... saying she a fat hoe, she got a mustash, she was ugly and etc.  I mean she aint NEVA seen, talk too or heard me discuss this girl before.  But she was going off like she knew her.  Then she gets upset and leaves and says "I need to repent for hanging around her cus she gay."  Now if anybody knew that the girl was still gay I think I would.  Not cus she told me but cus i got a divine connection and if she got that demon on her... he fa sho gonna come after me.     Shane...shane... stop stalking me shane!   I was somewhat engaged... talking to this guy and some stuff happened and we fell out.  He wanted friendship and i wanted to be through.  He kept on calling me... i wasn't answering. He tm me. I said i'd call him later.  I did and siad i was through.  A week later he comes tming and calling me again... talking abuot he wanna make sure its ova.  And he is apologizing for the part he has played in all this.  Last nite he pm's me on bp.com and i listen to him for about two hours talk crazy.  he called me last nite i rejecteed his calls and just turned off my phone.  He called me today again REJECT and then he had the audacity to call with the id withheld... I answered heard his voice and smooth hung up.  he talking all this blaze about when he through with ppl he is through. I'm through with him LET ME BE THROUGH.  As crazy as this situation has been from the beginning... I dont wish to be back with females.  I'm just gonna be a lil more careful about the men and WOMeN I allow in my life. Especially if they from the internet i'm gonna wait awhile before I let them talk me into meeting them.  That's all I got for now... mo' lata....   What you need is something genuine, something truthful, something pure... I know thats what you need because I need HIM too....   7 days till my 21st Birthday... and NO I'm NOT seventh day adventist.  I'm Non denominational with Pentacostal/Holiness background.

      umm... yeah last night was a close one... whew i had to pray.  To make matters worse, this guy I use to talk too or whatever is acting psychotic... . I don't know what's worse a man or a woman.  Humphf at any rate.  I praise God for keeping me throughout the stiuation.  Maybe I was a bit hasty i mean i spent almost two hours listening to what he had to say.  But he just didn't seem right in the head.  Strange thing is... he is a minister.  Love... Relationships... Sexual relations. Whew star gone do it. I'm through.  I'm going to worker HARDER and SMARTER about focusing on God.  That is where it is at.   One Second   For one second my ex was online.  It was really weird i went into shellshock I couldn't believe it.  Maybe it wasn't her... I don't know.  I know I still care and in my heart I'm gonna wanna always be there.  But the best thing for the both of us is we just stay away from each other.  It's been almost 6 months... and whew It sho' did pass by fast.Your girl gon do it boy...  I renounced her, the gay lifestyle and I have me something to focus on. Philippians 3:13 "Forgetting what is behind me and pressing towards what is ahead..."   What you want is for me to obey And if I cant give that then I cant give jack You dont want just my hands without my heart attached With out a heart to match, my lip service is dead as artifacts though I call it worship

       Star, I know your works and you are at the top of my respect list, so the email was not to you but I have a lot of lazy complainers on my email lists who Im tired of hearing about their struggles and problems, but they will do NO work. We (former gays) complain and moan about the church's mistreatment but we have no fruit or works to show them we are serious about overcoming. You keep doing what you are doing. Like me you dont have a lot, but I'll be darn if I sit somewhere crying when my Father has blessed me to maximize what I do have. Gays have taken this fight to the next level and we are still sitting around crying about we "struggling" instead of getting a weapon and getting to the frontlines. Im sick of it. Pray for me that I remain faithful. Love you and stay on the line!    DL    Finally somebody who respects me... i dont see it too often. (it happens but not often)um...I'm feeling this bloggin thing maybe make it into a book one day... lol.  Whew DL... that is my big bro there.  He is like my role model these days.  His fire and passion for God is like whew... I want to take it to the next level.  He is on the front lines and i'm in the mix of things... quietly but loudly letting the world know.   JESUS SAVES  I'm working on an autobiography, eventually i'll do a journal [all for the kids], conferences... who knows maybe next the world.  Sounds nice...  But first thing first.... I'm gonna seek God's face instead of his hands. I know fa sho I'm going to lose a friend.  I know fa sho God is gonna judge sin.   Sacrifice   Something as Christians we find ourselves doing often.  That's gotta be a word that is well known in your vocabulary; like persecution, judgement, sin, redemption, holiness and etc... .  I don't have much, I gave it away.  I have few things that mean much to me.  No point of gettin excited about much.    I made a mistake and got excited about something [rather someone].  I could end up losing her friendship again because I slack in my relationship with him.  Wasn't her... wasn't me in the sense that we wanted to be a “we”.  More like a he the devil I mean, he's trying to plant seeds.  Most defiantly I love the kid with my heart but I mean it isn’t the same thing.  We been cooling it for a hot second, shawty I mean hot.  Yeah she is a fine blend of everything I admired in my ex's.  But I haven’t seen her bad side yet.  Is that deceiving, misleading or maybe I tripping and she still feeling me.  Maybe it’s me that is the stranger in this house.  Maybe I've lied and my feelings have taken control down south.  My mind is a maze, erratic and in a daze.  The girl is addictive... intoxicating more to say.  This foreign territory has me wishing I was laced.  But I'd have to begin again and repent from the same ole sin.  I must stop the madness, stop the drastics, and stop hurting those I love and just focus on the man above.  What is it that has me so drawn, to consider her more than a friend?  Got me writing poetry and some otha stuff, but wait come again.  The bond we share... is tempting... almost erotic.  She knows me in ways that it's got to stop, familiar from the beginning.  Her voice tempting me to sinnin'... knowing what I want before I say.  If I were to let him take me there, this would BE my dieing day.  How could this be when it’s been a year that I’ve been free?  My one temptation... my one indiscretion...  That I passed up has now got my flesh lusting but only if I’m accepting.  Maybe that’s it that’s the secret to this test; I passed up and chose anotha.  So its test time again, yeah now class is in.  No more pedestrian circles, no more races to run; no more confusion Christ he is the winner… I refuse to lose, I choose to gain.  I choose Christ, his spirit and the anointing I have gained.  I must stop the madness, stop the drastics, stop hurting those I love and JUST focus on the man of above.   --For J.C and Tweety    8 Days till I turn 21

      I'm not a fan of Britney Spears but umm she on point with these lyrics tho.   With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride You're toxic I'm slippin' under With the taste of the poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic? Don't you know that you're toxic?   So your thinking okay STAR how does that affect you?  Well here is how...  JESUS... J.CHRIST... CHRIST... Yaweh...  Whatever  you  call the son of man.  He is outlawed, illegal and ppl just don't like Christians.  God is like the ultimate cure to any addiction, one REAL hit and your gone under. Toxic? So good it must be bad. Now some Christian fundamentalist might see this and be like well I never. I'd rather be addicted to God then some woman. Or anything else for that matter.  NOW that is real...   Next Topic...     "Goodness gracious Lord has anyone in the hood ever tasted this before?"    God Keeps on doing great things for me.  I certainly DON'T deserve what I've been giving and what I am allowed to receive but I count it all joy through everything.  I have a calling on my life... let me say it again I HAVE A CALLING ON MY LIFE AND I'M ONLY 20 AND I KNOW.  HE DIDN'T WAIT TILL I WAS 30/40 OR 50 TO USE ME... HE IS USING ME NOW.  I've met a lot of people in my life and it was Lisa McClendon who said it best...  Sometimes its the ones who u love the most who hurt you the most   It's hard for me to just open up to people, we have to be spiritually connected before I really even consider showing you my inner being.  I don't mean no soul ties/familiar spirits eitha.  I mean the real thing like David and Jonathan our souls have to be knit as one.  I have yet to meet someone who truly qualifies so I'm going to continue to do and be me.  Too many fakers trying to be in my inner court... FALL BACK before you get slapped back...(my new motto) NO MORE GAMES... NO MORE DRAMA... Just peace and tranquility.  Can I scream it any lower... (((THEY ONLY WANT ME FOR MY PIMP JUICE))) Every body want the Jesus Juice... People fail to understand if you not living right hanging around someone who does live right won't bless you it will actually curse them.  THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD... GET SOME!     Chang3... Chang... Jaki Chang   Change... whew I think Lashaun Pace said it best "I know I've been changed" I still say it, it's not a complete 360 but I KNOW I've been changed.  I want some dreadlocks and I know if I listen to everyone else I'll never get them. So I'm going to just chill on the thought until I'm confident in my decision about the thing.   Questions... Questions     God, I say you're the greatest light of my life Your cross the greatest sight of my life When I believed, the greatest night of my life Since then itÂs the fight of my life, to get at You    Thank You JESUS.  For Grace and Mercy... I know I shouldn't question in all things but this is one time I trust I can question you.  I can't figure out this whole love thing.  How can two people who talked about getting married now can't stand to be around each other.  I don't have anything against the guy..Butut his presence upsets me.  The way the whole situation went down was wild from the jump.  But I refuse to let unforgiveness fester inside of me and block my blessing.  I never really cared that much for him from the jump.  Lord forgive me I know NOT what I do the trials and tribs of life sometimes make me come unglued.  I thoughI i wanted to be marriedI i thoughI i wanted to be in loveI i thought i wanted a mate... meeting him as killed marriage for me.  If i die and ole lady who celibate it's ALLL GOOD!  I'm gon be paid, laying up in the shade REGARDLESS.  I'm seeking after GOD first and not some man.  That is what is up.  MATTHEW 6:30-34 it keeps ya so righteous.   Matthew 6:30   Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? 31   Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32   (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33   But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 34   Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.      TWEETY   I don't think anyone has had a bigger impact on my life then this person here.  Whew, through her I saw just how strong I really was.  God saved both of us from one of the biggest mistakes we could of EVER MADE...(getting together).  Everday I thank God for that!  He is an ontime God and because I stayed focused on God she...(getting excited just thinking about it). She recommited her life to the Lord.  I speak Life into her life, peace into her soul and truth into her mind.  Soultie/familiar spirit/possible knit spirits... iono. It's on that level tho. Our meeting is a made for tv movie on the lifetime channel.  She fa sho gonna be in my book... lol.  Should our friendship have to end again, for whatever reasons. Thank You Lord for the little time we was afforded (again) and this time there was peace instead of uneasyness and spiritual warfare.                               THANK YOU   TIGGER   Now this girl MUST be special cus she in my blog... lol.  Um I'd never tell her this to her face but I KNOW HER SECRET.  Got that spirit of discernment... In the short few weeks that I've come to know her... I've grown to love her like a third cousin who i only heard about and just finally met. We... whew.... we connect on a level that I know it ain't right.  She give me that same familiar feeling I had when i met all my [NOW] ex's and after Tweety... I'm able to brush my shoulders off and continue focusing on God.  I know NOW that I don't have to focus on my feelings I focus on what I know.  So i see her merely as anotha test and altho I kind of wilded out [cus i was tipsy] when we met.  It's all good. REPENT, REGROUP and DON'T DO IT AGAIN. AMEN.   I'm serious about this thang... I mean I've told my friends about this situation and without hesitation they ask me... how could you even consider her [i don't but smoke-screens, mirrors; anybody can be decieved atleast for a second].  This is all together trippy cus she has all the qualities I admire in a person and we shouldn't even be friends cus last time I checked she was still gay and i'm not.    Some situations might have me singing... Shoulda' listened... but oh this won't be that!

       "My ex girlfriend(s) Not jus ONE but all as a whole. Whew, a mighty force to be reckon with. I can pick em boi. But i love each and eri one of them the same... i love em unconditionally and i dont even wanna imagine life without them in it. thas how deep this thing is. who is the real star? do u kno? i dont think so... cus i barely know. but i plan on spending 2004 finding out."   My ex girlfriend(s) and not just ONE of them but all of them as a whole... ARE GONE. They are gone.... I don't know what they are doing.. I don't talk to them and i'm not really trying too. For the most part i have a way to contact each and everyone of them. BUT i'm not. even the one who i don't know where she is... i know where to begin to look for her. It's okay that they aren't physically present in my life. I never thought i'd be able to say that but again... GOD HAS MADE THE DIFFERENCE.  Reading back through my old posts is so.. wow. It's power, I can see the change God has made in me even if no one else can. From the fact that I don't speak internet slang as much. To the fact that my conversation have changed. It's more contemplative then enraged. I'm more at peace now. I still don't know exactly who I am... or my purpose but i'm starting to get a pretty good idea.  A mighty woman of God with an awesome purpose and plan for her life.   I don't even think that summarizes it good enough.  Thank you for the open doors and the ways you have made and so much more. Thank you for everything i needed to overcome and the knowledge that i know its already inside of me. I overcome by the words i say, i overcome by pressing my way, i overcome by faith....

      Words cannot express how blessed I've been since the day I met you. Nope... no words can. Unfortunately, It is you... that I hide from, it is you that i often ignore and it is you that I rebell against. But I love you with my very life. I have sacrificed and gave up pretty much everything i ever loved or cared about.. BUT IT STILL ISN'T ENOUGH. I want and need and crave to be closer to you. You didn't let me fall but here I stand. You have changed me... I'm at a 180 right now. I went from pretty boy stud to almost prissy female. Goodness Gracious has anyone tasted you before. Can't nobody do what you have done in me to themselves. I threw away all my mens clothes, I pushed away all my ex's and i broke up with my girlfriend. Said I didn't want other ppl's blood to be on my hands. But now I'm saddened... It seems as if everything I've done has been in vain.  Although i'm so in love with you... i'm pushing you away. Although I've planted all these seeds... ppl STILL reject you and for what?? They want to go back into the mess that you had JUST delivered them from. (I know and I understand... i've been there) and Like I say... when you are ready... they'll come out until then they have to stay in the lion's den.  For a long time I doubted myself and if i could really kick the habit... if i could really just stop being gay. But here it is a year later and i'm in a much better place. not quite 100% delivered i still got some residue but for the most part i'm good. I thought fa sho that when girls would hit on me, I would be tempted and sin... i thought fa sho that I would give in. But you showed me just how strong I really was... THANK YOU. For that I can never be the same.  There is sooo very much on my mind... from my friends getting into the car accident... to not knowing where my ex is. That is bothering me. Maybe it shouldn't but it does. Before we were involved we were friends first. That will never change. I wish we could of been friends with no drama. But I realized I had to let Go when I was ready to beat her with that bat that night. I shoulda listened and stayed away .. I wouldn't have lost my temper that day. All I can say is because of how u used her... i will never be the same. We both had to fall so that I could get up and come back stronger. I pray so much for her and the rest of them... I SPEAK LIFE and I SPEAK the spirit of truth into their lives even right now.  Thoughts jumbled together... Dreams... visions... of things that don't even seem.... you say that you love me and that you cant live without me but why do u only call me when u need me...I'm a believer. "Open the windows of heaven and let it rain"... if it's not you i dont want it at all... here's my heart if u want it you can have it i will give it all to u because u love me... without your anoiting and your spirit i have nothing at all... books... two books... changed lives... change clothes... game is over because it has changed..... unbreak my heart... JESUS is the only answer.  Some say i'm transparent... i beg to differ... i switch up my style as much as dennis rodman changes his hair.

       Carnal Knowledge...MAN!  It's like whoa after the conversation I had with my girl Shae last night.  Shae is one person who I can truly say, I don't feel any ill feelings towards like she has a hidden agenda or whatever.  Shae and I, we've only been chilling for a minute.  But we met up like last year when I was still gay and she was still gay.  I wasn't really interest in a friendship at the time and so we kind of drifted apart.  Then one day we was in the lesbian chatroom together and we started talking and I gave her my testimony and she said she was ready for that change.  Just not at that second and so I said cool, well whenever you ready I'll be here.  So like a month or so later she came back ready to make that change.  She was like me you know all studded out in the H-T, faded never braided and sweatband wearing to the side, always gotta hard look on her face in a picture but get on the phone with her and the feminine ways come out.  Now it's funny how things work out sometimes because Tigger (whose real name shall remain out of this) re-introduced us.  The three of us use to kick it really hard on the phone every once and a while.  Still do sometimes but everything has changed none of us are no longer the same.  i know I'm not fa sho and I've gained a little knowledge that I just can't shake.  I put this on everything and I don't care if Tigger still be reading this journal or not but Shae and I agree, Ms. Tigger got a thang for me.  Now if I was still gay (which I'm not) I may have been kind of flattered I might even would of ran game on her.  However, that isn't me anymore, I'm worry about her soul (period).  Maybe she not worried about the hell she trying to put herself in but uh I am.  I really genuinely care for her, but you can't help a person who won't help themself.  So as usually I bow out gracefully and just say a prayer and let her work it out with the Lord.  My mom and my grandmother... The two women whose lifestyles have almost shaped mines.  My mom man she raised my on her own with out someone to really just call daddy.  She did a great job for what she did but nonetheless as much as she hated her, for a little while her child was a lesbian.  Things are better between us and that's all that matters.  I'm trying to follow in the example my grandmother has been to me, not BC but AD after the transfomation and renewing of the mind/ lifestyle change.  I got some big shoes to fill... I come from a long line of female ministers.  yeah that's whatsup!  All them otha chicks that came inbetween (My Exs) Well what can I say... nuttin really, Jesus did exactly what he said he would do.  I said remove everything, anything, and everything that isn't pleasing to you out of my life right now.  He did it and he continues to do it.  I have no regrets for my past cus that's what it is my past and it has made me a much better person today.  I can't change what happened and so I'm not going to dwell on it. I'm going to dwell on Phil. 3:13.  Finally finally the one whose presence sticks out the most. TwEeTy!  She isn't what she use to be and I'm sure this isn't the end to who she is going to be.  These days I feel like she's a star cus man it's like we have to clear our schedules just to chill for a minute and talk with out distractions.  After almost oh 6 months of saying yeah we gon meet, one day we are going to meet.  Last night we made it officially unofficial we are going to meet in September.  I kind of DON'T want to meet her, I kinda do... I don't know what I want.  All I do know iz I don't want her coming out here bring demons for me to have to fight off, she can keep that in Cali.  Or take her getaway vacation somewhere else instead of Arkansas.  Seriously though on a more serious thought, I can be rather callous, blunt and just down right rude.  I feel like a little child who sees someone ugly and says mommie that person is ugly.  I might not say it but my face sho will!  Some friendships are better kept with out face to face contact cus sometimes when you meet you mess up that good thing.  That is what happened with robin and me, and so many other bp planeteers that I have met.  Was it like that for me and Tigger?  Um... NO.  I did better then I thought I would in that situation, I was sooo nice.  But within a few days Shae and I was ROLLING off of what happened.  So these are the women whose presence really impact my life.  Although their are more females in my life then these none of them impact my life the way these 6 do.  Tigger should feel so special... awe, get a handy wipe, I'm about to bust, a tear that is.   My voice is silenced without the activity of my limbs.   Working on my book has caused some seriously undue stress on my poor little hands, carpal tunnel? Tendonitis?  I DON'T KNOW!! All I know I'm officially on hiatus from writing the book, talking on Instant Messenger and returning a lot of e-mails.  I prayed, I put blessed oil on my hands and seriously the pain has went away.  God is soo good  I don't know the reason I just know that everything happens for a reason.  For those who don't know what my book is about and they want to know... stay tune  on more information.

       Sounds like something Kayne West would say... however I said it!!!     I used it in reference to Tigger last month and now i'm using it again this month for my prase of the month.  It is the phrase that pays!     Tweety... Tigger... and my EX-girlfriends.  There is a funny thing about life, it's call truth.  Once you've known it it sets you free.  I've a VERY loving person, I've got so much love inside of me to give, but I find it hard to believe that others love me.  That's one of those things about me people would never think.  That is my insecurity the thought of not being loved.  It causes me to shut down and push the world out for fear of guess what? NOT BEING LOVED.   So how does this reflect back to the title?   I spent so many months which turned into years hurting because eitha my ex-girlfriends didn't love me or they did but they had a odd way of showing it.  It took a really long time for me to get secure enough in myself were it didn't matter what they said, did, or didn't say or do.  I'm finally to a place of security in the fact that I don't know were some of them are and I don't know how to find them. I spoke with Diamond earlier this week (i'm sure we won't be speaking again, PTL), I had my best friend call Kay's parents house (no response from that... but I already knew that), I saw Cres online but I didn't speak, and Lil Ces well she deleted her blackplanet page (maybe she got a new one or maybe she finally got off).  Who knows? Who knows what each of them are doing... I don't and THAT's what matters.  Tweety and Tigger... Lets make Tigger feel special and add her to blog one more gin.  It's not that I like her or that I have an attraction, I'm drawn to her.  Since the very beginning before I even knew her name and she was just a face on my computer screen that I continued to see.  Their is something their that God is trying to protect me from.  So I stay away for the most part, we don't talk much (we never have) I don't put much imphasis on our friendship (rather close association).  I'd just like some clarity as to why... for ONE why is she even remotely in my life and TWO  why we having dreams about each other and in them we getting intimate.  Devil trying to plant seeds or something. It's like she's gone for a minute and then she comes back... the yo-yo appearance.  Okay God as the screenwriter of my life (as the lead actress in this dramedy) I demand that you give sister, her walking papers.  Tell her to exit stage left and make sure the security guards exscort her off the studio lot.  A BIT MUCH BUT WE GET THE POINT.  I don't get her presence in my life and so again that makes me hesitant.  AGAIN, the girl is still LAST time I checked Gay... so cus socializing is a NO!  In the bigger scheme of things her demons put my life in danger.  Meeting the way we did... I just don't know kid. However, I gotta thank my bestest friend in the whole world for Tiggers bestest friend in the whole world, maybe she hasn't caught it but almost everytime we talk her bestfriend calls.  An since I'm not anybody oh she gotta go.  Their is something their that God is trying to protect me from.  I don't know what it is... what i do know is this.  They say when you got demons they can make you do anything and you won't catch it.  She could be flirting with me and she not catch it or vice versa.  The spiritual realm MAKES NO SENSE!!!! However, they gotta hiarchy and oh trust GOD... Jehovah is the head of this thang.   Tweety... I'm a new TRUE friendship prospect.  She hates the idea of loosing friends and she doesn't even lack them.  Okay but again the question I asked was what makes our friendship so special?  That is how she answered and so I'm feeling like it isn't special she just doesn't like loosing friends.  So the wheels of darkness are beginning to turn in my head on how I can be evil to her.  That ain't God and that has most def got to go.    Distractions ... distractions all distractions to my destiny.

      I had to work today on this lovely saturday at the gym, taking photos of a weight lifting competition.  My my MY my MY!!! I saw some chiselled, fine, any word to mean built and looking sexy with it, I saw it!!! I met me some awesome military men, who was again let me add built.  Their was this one chick, she was a little too swole just a lil.  But she came out with her hair did up and her little makeup she wasn't playing any games. I'm really feeling what they did and I'm thinking about getting into body building.  it's something I've always wanted to do but I was never motivated enough to do it.  Talk about a great way to meet men and get to touch on them.  This is it girlfriends!  So get your weight gloves, your helts and your chalk and baby powder cus its raining men!!! Fine specimens FINE.  I was invited to the after party and I couldn't go because it was off base and I don't have a car yet.  Which was a good thing though too.   So how's the book coming along?  The book is great.. great... I'm done with the journal portion now i'm on to the life changing portion of it.  Four more chapters to do and I'm through, I have to get someone to edit it and then send it off to the publishers and see what happens. If they reject my book then I'll pray and see what happens. Hopefully I won't have to do a POD but I mean I gotta operate in faith... 2 Corinthians 5:7 We walk by FAITH, and not by sight!    How's Tweety? Great... great... we don't talk like we use too but we talk every so often.  She seems to be good as well as can be expected.  I have great expections for the life of her child.  I really believe God is going to do something awesome in this child's life.  Maybe Tweety was only born for this reason to be the mother of this child.  Who knows you know?  I bought a book from amazon.com on emotional dependency and I can't wait to get it.  I plan to sit down and read this book (seriously unlike most).     Wild child or good girl... that is the question?  I believe in all of us their is a desire to just wild out and be adventerous and do things we've never done before.  I believe that inside of us there is a desire to just be good and be pleasing in the sight of God.  I believe all of us tread a thin line inbetween the two were some of us choose the wild child and some of us choose to be good and pleasing in the sight of God.  It's so frustrating to be me right now.  I don't have much in the area of friends... the best friends I have, i had to back away from because of confusion on my mental part.  Then the other decent friends I have I have to back away from them because they aren't trying to live right and one of them isn't even a christian.  My friends ex-boyfriend gave me a ride home tonight and as I went to shake his hand good night he wanted a hug instead and he grabbed my butt.  Maybe I shouldn't have been as polite in my saying no.  All I do know is my first thought is as always to run back to the baggy clothes, baseball caps and tennis shoes way of life.  It was my security blanket, and although now i'm wearing my body fitting clothes my body is saying hey... we are going to be seen we are (my assests) BIG.  I just can't win for losing in that regard.  I think weight lifting or body building will do me some good.  Men think they can just grab and touch and feel on me just like when I was a child.. i'm not trying to return to that way of life.  It's a cycle I'm not trying to begin again ... where i'm pushed back into the arms of women and then the cycle continues further downward until this time I decide to kill myself for real seriously and I go somewhere were it is IMPOSSIBLE for somebody other then a God sent ANGEL from Heaven to come and rescue me.  Men touching on me brings me back to a place in my mind a place I don't dare return too.  I think body building WILL BE GOOD FOR ME.  A great way for me to release some anger and tension and just come home after I'm done and sleep it off.

       Thank you for the open doors, the ways you've made and so much more   Everything I need, everything in order to believe is already inside of me.  And we overcome by the words we say, we overcome by pressing our way and we overcome by faith.--Joann Rosario.  I don't think anyone can accurately understand how much I love this song, or how much this song ministers to me.  I just don't think anyone can unless they've heard me play it on repeat day in and day out, unless they've heard me sing with it with all the faith and belief in God that I have in me.  No matter what hardships we face we will not be defeated no way!  So what am I so adamant about overcoming, that I sing this song with such intensity?  LIFE.  I must know in my knower that God has given me the ability to overcome everything.  Now unfortunately, this song also reminds me of my ex.  Which I was hoping would kind of stopped by now... but it hasn't.  Probably because I've been using it to push myself to work on this book.  I've been having weird dreams on and off.  I think the strangest one is the one I had right before I woke up.  I dreamed that I was in an apartment and I was watching these two burglers in black and white jump from roof to roof until finally they was on my building the women was just standing on my balcony and I heard keys or some sort of noise coming from the back. I guess where the man was.  I stood there kind of crunk like you not going to get in.  She just stood there unfazed by seeing me.  I began to get scared thinking they were going to come in and tie me up or worse hurt me.  Yet they never did and I woke up.  What does the dream mean?  Who knows... I just know in my knower that it partly means nobody can hurt me unless God allows and God is protecting me so I should never be afraid of anything.  Which is let me say easier said then done.   a year of change... the book  I've been working on my book for a few days.  I'm already at 60 plus pages.  When I started out doing this... the power of suggestion was strong in my ear.  I heard who will read this, this won't help anybody, and it won't even get published.  But I knew that wasn't God, and I ignored and pressed on.  I really believe my book will help someone.  Even if it's just to stay that my book is another installment in the books for the ex-ssa people or people who want to become that way.  The Bible says Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  I really want to minister too and encourage somebody to overcome and COME OUT!!!  IF it takes my life story to make it happen... hey it is all good, it's already alright!  God has not forgot and if he said that he would do it, it will come to pass.  I'm not too worried about how people will recieve it, I know I will have a lot of critics  who will say that I am confused, don't know what I want or simply that I am still gay.  However, God knows... God said it and so I believe it and that is that I've been delivered.  I am the redeemed of the Lord!  The kind of stuff I went through oh it only is really talked about on TV.  All the good stuff that I overcame oh that isn't even in the book (YET).  My biggest concern and the only critics that I will even consider listening too are those who the book happen to be about.  them 5 people... their opinions is not going to be the be it and end all to my view of the situation but I feel like, they are going to know how I truly feel about them and I'm going to know exactly what they think of me.  Since I'm just not out there talking to any of them like that oh well nuttin to really be lost.

      I have a lot of people around me who don't need to be.  Some I should of gotten rid of a long time ago.  But I didn't and now the Lord is like, getting rid of them one way or another.  Tigger and I, we've been talking a little bit more.  Turns out she isn't going to Canada because of school.  I had a dream about her yesterday and in my dream, she kissed me.  Now she had a dream about me and she did the same thing.  It means something but we don't know what it means.  I know I need to just step up and be a woman and just ask God.  Well we was talking about it last night and I was like well it could eitha mean you like me or your going to betray me with a kiss.  Then she said naw it could be the other way around, I was rolling on the floor laying (okay layin in my bed laughing) we was text messaging each other.  Let me give you a lil taste of how she responded to my comments after that.  Tigger said  "That applies as well but until I am ready I need you not to judge me."   I wanted to get crunk and all that but I just chilled said something stoopid and went on to bed.  Like Kirk Franklin say "Till we meet again."  Play on playa...   WHAT'S NU?   I'm working on the long awaited, much anticipated book from ME.  Yeah yeah I know... I know... I'm thinking it ain't "deep" enough but who knows God may use it and someone else say I'm wrong.  be on the look out for that in say 05-06... if I procrastinate 07.  Tweety: Star Star: yes  Tweety: I'm PREGNANT.  okay hold up, before anybody gets any ideas... It isn't me that's pregnant.  Just a real good friend of mines.  I had to call my best friend and ask her what to do cus I sure didn't know.  I'm good with words but babies? unwanted pregnancies? other than you better not kill it! I'm good for nuttin (on my own). I screamed and freaked like... not her no not her, a mommy? NO.  but I of course didn't tell her that. I just encouraged her and I told her everything happens for a reason and it's gonna work out (eventually) and I'm really glad I'm able to be a friend to her right now.  Lately, I haven't been able too and I know now it's prolly gonna get worse but well God knows.

      It's been a few days since I've posted... I didn't have much to say... I mean a lot has happened don't get me wrong.  I just wasn't ready to talk about it.  Among the mental strain and drain that working on my new book is causing me.  I just want to stay away from people and do my thing.  Beyond the underlining thoughts and voices that say this book must not be written, it won't be read, and no one will care.  I'm having dreams again... two of them actually one about me chilling with Tigger and she just ups and kissed me all in my mouth.  I was just like whoa afterwards.  I just kind of acted like it didn't happen.  Then I had a dream about Kay and one of her bestfriends was in it and she handed me a bag of things that Kay had bought for me.  Said she didn't know where she was and all that jazz so i went off to go look for her and the dream ended.  Somewhere in the midst of all that my bestfriend was in the dream and she was doing somethings I don't quite remember.  BUT i'm still trippin off this tigger kissin me thing... whoa.  That was pretty intense and if that's suppose to be a sign of what's to come.  Yeah I can see her having a more prevalent role in my book but NOT my life.   Closer to you...  the only person I need and will be getting Close to these days is Jesus.  It seems as much as i'd like to think I could have a friend that I could be close too... I can not.  It's all good though cus I realize that this is God and me time.  I'm special to him and he needs his time alone with me more then anyone else.  Grant it there isn't anyone just bangin on my door to spend time with me anyways but It's all good cus that is a good thing.  Loonie's birthday was yesterday she's now 27... mami getting old... lol.  I didn't make any real attempts to wish her a happy birthday but i did send her an e-card but i put from secret.  hopefully she won't think back to me but who knows.  I really got love for her, through and through.  I mean this chick had pictures of me up in her crib.  We wasn't together, she was like my play moms more than anything.  It's hard to believe it's 2004 and she's no longer physically present in my life.  But I press (philippians 3:14) I've got too.  among and admist all the adversity and trials and tribulations I've had to deal with the BIG Guy has been right there comforting and consoleing me.  Jesus... man I can't put any words on that.  So i won't... I am somebody in Jesus, I'm already delivered because of Jesus and I will help others by the power of Jesus bloodshed and name.   ONE MILLION SOULS ...  but i'll accept touching a trillion souls.

       Disillusioned once again... Star vs Star   The choice is yours... eitha i can give up and lay down or i can get back up and say like i always say "You ain't seen bouncing back!" But I have two choices... I always have two choices, I just want my dad to be proud of me... I just want to hear God say "well done"... I just want to feel complete and lacking nothing and I just want to know pure unadulterated bliss. I'm always hearing voices and i'm always seeing things.  Total Chaos right now it's one of those nights were i just need to go to bed.  I'm being pulled in different directions and its just like man.   You will know my name but you will NEVER KNOW ME!  Their is a woman by the name of Yvette Flunders she supposedly an ordained Bishop and here church is like a bapta-metho-costal type situoso not so much "non-demon" but all those three i said.  She is as I've learned to day, she's my biggest threat.  WHY? Because her church goes against everything I stand for.  She's decieving many and calling it God.  This chick is a lesbian in a 20/10?? year relationship.  She's educated.. i mean EDUCATED!!!  Old enough to be my momma but she's my opposition... my adversary.  Now it's a sin to compare myself to her so I won't.  I just want her to know my name... If she knows my name then i'm happy.  But I don't ever want to meet the chick, that would again go against bible teachings.  I just want my chance in the sun to nationally and internationally cast down the very appearance of evil.  I don't care how I feel...  My mind is made up and I'm willing to follow you, Lord!    One year and one month.   Yup on the 10th I made one year and one month... I'm on my way now!  God is truly doing some awesome things in my life and when I get over myself he can do even more. He has saturated my life with grace and mercy.  I owe him so much... so very much.  Nothing can take away all that God has done for me, been to me and how he continues to cease to amaze me.  He has me sprung... a lit bit afraid but sprung.  Why? am i afraid of God?  Allowing God to be the lover and lord of your life isn't exactly the easiest thing. To entrust my life in his hands alone.  Man that is stress on the brain until you finally realize hey ... he's got this... i'm ok.  I'm still in that area i know... i've been there for a while but i'm slowly allowing God full and complete reign of my life. Just Jesus and me like when i was a kid... yeah it's just like old times but now i'm older and a lil wiser.

       Look how God moves...    one night when i was surfin the net i came across  a web site for Fantasia Barrino the latest American Idol winner and i found myself saying dag she fine and i kept looking at different articles about her and finding myself having those feelings toward women that i use to have even though she is a celebrity i started feeling her when she made it to the finals of American Idol and when she won i was all glad wishing i could meet her and all types of stuff. however on one of the web sites for her she was talking about her relationship with God and how he really helped her through the competion and all this stuff  anyhow i closed that web site out and i typed in "deliverance from homosexuality" and a whole bunch of stuff came up and i came to a web site called witness ministry's (it's at http://www.witnessfortheworld.org/enter.html) and on the left hand side of the web site it says "First Person" and i clicked on that it was about 8 different people with testimonies about their struggle through homosexuality and it had ya'll pictures so i clicked on u cause u got on your BDU's and i fin to go to the service so i was interested in what u had to say and that site had other links to reach u like the RFL4CHRIST web site and it had that other e-mail address i wrote u at first but at RFL4CHRIST is where i got the gods_dyme e-mail from.   I just sit and watch tv sometimes and wonder how people became the Hollywood "it" people.  How did they propel to the top all this time they've been in hollywood and never really made a name for themselves until whenever.  Or how when they win an award sometimes they thank God or sometimes they don't or sometimes they just say God bless you know.  Makes me wonder... For a little while I was jealous of Beyonce' but I don't like her all the same.  She is a very bad role model for young girls.  She says she's a christian and she compromises her "christianity" daily. I don't even worry myself her anymore.  I don't want to be the IT person... I know in my time I'll be were I need to be.  I'll be representing Christ to the fullest... cus after all...  If you gon represent Christ you gotsta represent him right!   That's heart, mind, body and soul, the total being of a man.   Same sex Marriage Debunked as a Civil Right by Black Ministers     I can't believe the audacity of the devil to try to call same-sex marriage a civil rights.  Black people died for me and others like me to have the ability to vote, get an education, have rights and homosexuals talk about its the same thing.  I understand and I have empathy for what they are going through but you know what.  It's not even the same.  I met this girl off of blackplanet and she is now stationed her with me.  She came over to the crib one time and we was just talking about how she thinks its unfair that she has to struggle to take care of her family (her wifey and son) and how two heterosexuals don't have to struggle as much in the military.  I didn't say nothing i just looked at her and was like whatever.  But when the time was right i just remind her that all this ain't God and if you think God is going to allow you to just get it your way you better wake up and smell the coffee cus God ain't Burger King and You CAN'T have it your way!  My ex and I both were put into situations where we could of lost our lives... you can't have it your way and think God is gonna just bless you.  GOD will turn his back on you and the devil will begin to bless you... yeah.   Welcome to FREEDOM!   When I went to go visit my therapist yesterday that was the last thing he said to me.  I told him about how people only seeing same-sex relations as two same sex people who just want to be together.  But i said it goes deeper... nobody will truly ever know or understand the depths of what someone who has been a homosexual or bi-sexual goes through unless they have been there too.  The pain, confession, anger, desparation, frustration, hate, self-loatheing, and all the other things that come from it or with it.  Maybe if more people would stop and seek why or how a person got into the lifestyle in the first place maybe it would be easier for them to get out. you can't just say oh i want to get out but ignore the problems that got you there in the first place.  You gotta tackle what brought you to that place in the first place.  That's what i'm doing now.  Tackling the voids of emptiness, the emotional dependency issues and all the other reasons why i got into the deathstyle in the first place.  As i began to spend more time with my parents especially my mom.  All the hurt and pain... the empiness and the void... GOD he is just taking it and he's doing a healing in me.  All my sins are washed away and it was nothing but the blood of Jesus.   Me a silent wife or am I already the silent wife?  Their is this family that I care about... they've kind of adopted me into there family.  It just kind of happened and i'm looking at the situation and it seems as if i've became the silent wife.  The one the husband goes to to get a feeling of self worth and apreciation.  He talks to me in a very inapropriate way... He calls me "beautiful" and he talks about how he loves and misses me. Goodness gracious i just walked blindly into a situation or maybe i knew this was a possiblity and i just hoped against hope that this wouldn't be.   Even Christians let the devil use them too.      Oh Tigger!  Well after a few weeks, I finally talked with Miss Tigger... she's suppose to be moving to Canada cus her mom is going to marry some guy.  I called her up last night to see when she was moving and when she returned my call she didn't even remember my voice.  I found that pretty interesting... what i found to be MORE interesting was how she was like "she missed me... and she looks at our picture together..."  LMBBOOT!!! Whew... Hallejuah... our convo didn't even last fifteen mins between the holy spirit warning me to get off... someone calling me and then her best friend calling her.  Oh how i love Jesus...   The commericalism that is Jesus and the controversy behind the Rainbow...  As I sit and listen to the Kirk Franklin Christmas cd I realize that we should celebrate the birth, life, death and ressurection power of Christ EVERDAY not just on Sunday or on easter. Anyways... it rained here and i just looked at the rainbow.  It's amazing how something so beautiful that signifies a promise could be taunted and turned into something else. Gay PRIDE? What is that... nothing more then an oxymoron.. do murders, liars and thieves have pride or there own churches? NO I don't think so. No back to Jesus.  I saw a shirt today that has a photo of Jesus and it says "Jesus is my homeboy" Grant it i wasn't feeling the one with the photo of him on it.  But i was feeling the hat and the one without the photo.  It just amazes me how people can sell on the commericializm that is the reason for my new life.  I mean sure I sell Jesus ALSO. BUTTTTTTT I'm selling it for the winning of souls and not for a profit of monetary gain.  But i really wanna get that hat and shirt. I haven't been to the mall in a LONG time and it just amazes me what's instyle now.  They had a pink tank that said "Dulce" i bout freaked out cus i really wanted that shirt and i know someone else who if they've seen it they want it or already have it too. (my ex... that's her nickname.)  Then the Holy Spirit dealt with me and reminded me why i didn't want that shirt and so i didn't get it.  So i went into another store and saw a shirt that said "Sorry i don't date girls." I wanted that one too.  My friend didn't get why i wanted that shirt so... but i did. I mean to be able to say that with true meaning now. yeah... anyways so i didn't get any of that stuff i just merely brought some flipflops and a pair of mens jeans from old navy.  i'll prolly take the pants back... i'm not trying to start wearing mens clothes again i got a good thing here and i'm not trying to go backwards.  God hasn't brought me this far to leave me... or allow me to turn backwards...   Thought of the day:   Flee the very appearance of evil.

       but I also don't want to walk out of Heaven...   It's been a while since i've last posted a few thangs have been going on here and there. I've been dealing with some small issues and when i took communion last week I saw first hand just how powerful communion was.  After I took it all those lil issues with my eating habits and certain relationships ceased.  I chose the title that i chose today for sentimental reasons... I'm having a JaggedEdge moment.  I really don't to say goodbye to tweety but at the same time i dont want to walk feel like i've walked out of heaven. Eitha way... and God truly has been gracious enough to let us end without us truly ending.  we just stopped talking to each other and when we do talk its not the same.  It's sad and amazing all in one how God can take something that was at one time so near and dear to your heart and you thought that you could or would die without it and now it's all gone (all of it has as the group grits would say "they've all fall down!")  It's crazy... all the anguish and confusion and feeling disillusioned it's gone.  but the choice to go back is only mines.  If she's not pressing to talk to me then i'm not gonna press the issue and just try to talk to her. Sometimes you gotta let it go... you just gotta let it go.     CHANGE.   I'm still in awe at the changes God has made in me.  Nobody truly will ever understand the change he has made in my life but me.  They say that the true evidence of the holy spirit on the inside is a change in lifestyles.  Well my lifestyle has changed drastically.  From the clothes i wear, the food i eat, the people i hang around, to even the things that i allow myself to think.  I have/i try to bring all things under subjection to God.  I realized just how important it was that early morning my body was sexually fustrated and i just began to call on Jesus and talk to him... and within a matter of mins the feeling was gone, i mean as strong as it was it was gone.  Jesus makes not only the wind and waves behave but he alone can make flesh behave.      I think I've found me a winner... Jesus Christ for which there can never be no other contender.      They all cross my mind sometime...   Yeah no doubt all my ex's cross my mind at sometime, but i mean i don't let myself get caught up in the thoughts. I realize that it is what it is the past and i'm sure that none of them are worried about me, i mean yeah i may cross there mind (eri once and a while) but I know in my KNOWER... that it's better this way.  I can't get what i need from them I can only get it from God!   Thought of the day:   Take it all to the Lord in prayer, better yet tell your problems about the Lord instead of telling the Lord about your problems!

       Goodness Gracious!!!   Praise God! I was getting kind of nervous for a second life was getting to be a lil dull. I thought I have been slacking in making the devil mad.  Not that I try but If i'm pleasing God then of course he's gonna be mad.  I've got this overwhelming sense of unhappiness sitting on me, like Dorothy Norwood say...  "Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake the devil off."  Although tonight I just settle for my usual melodies of jazzy, urban "Gospel".  But Tonight is one of them serious nights where I gotta switch it up and bring it back to the old school choir gospel when the songs be like 8 mins plus long.  yeah one of them nights.. and nothing  but the anointing on Hezekiah Walker will do.  But if it gets worse I'm going to have to get personal... turn OFF the music and put my face to the floor... or the bed(which ever i come to first).  I'm slightly tired.  I worked 12 hours again today... I ain't mad nor will I brag about it.  Tomorrow I'm prolly gonna do it again... go for the long haul and do 13 hours! Ha! Show my boss i do care...   Passions... desires... zeal or fire   I have none so i gotta get some... now the Bible says that the JOY of the Lord is my Strength then what of the Lord is my passion? Or is that basically the same thing?  Iono but I'm feeling like reading some Psalms or Job two brothers I can identify with.  NOT depressed just sadden at the state of there lifestyles...YET they still PRAISE THE MOST HIGH GOD.  and because they never give up on God... God NEVER gives up on them.   It's my blessing NOT yours!   Visions and dreams and voices and I mean just wilding out.  Blood on my hands... blocked blessings and i'm ignorant to it all.  Or am i?  I'm ready to put my tostitos chips and dip back in the fridge and just go to bed.  Pray and yeah make it a night... I'm no good to anyone right now... not even me.  I'm hearing voices and I'm seeing things... it's about that time. G'nite.  Thought of the night: His will good... it is acceptable and its perfect.

      I've been sitting on this title since the 2nd here it is the 7th... lol.  It's been that long since I've posted, between work and my emotions, I just haven't been feeling like sharing.  Friday I go see my counselour, I'm starting to think maybe just maybe iono ... i wonder if this really was a good idea.  It's funny cus in the last few days it's been one of those Tamia "Stranger in my house moments"  I feel like everything around me is changing when all along it was me.  There is a shift in the spirit.  I'm having wild dreams... whew, WILD!!!  God is truly trying to do somethings.  I'm just like iono... is this God? is that God? Why are all those major figures from my past coming back... it's like my life is on blast you know.  I just sat in looked at myself in the mirror and i thought. How can i write an autobiography about my life? who would actually want to read it? I've gon from being a lesbian, to bisexual to "a married man's other woman."  I just seem to dig the ditch deeper and here comes Jesus... on his clean white horse... No wait! let me make it plain(ghetto) for you...Here come Jesus in a brand spanking new Navigator with all the buttons on 23's forget 22's.  Bumping some Hallejuah Chorus, he gets out the ride and he puts his hand out and he reaches down to me in the ditch and says look at the nail prints in my hand... for this reason i have died.  So that you could be free NOT so that i could make you free and continually make you free from the same ole' sin again and again.  Now i'm going to clean you off one more time.  BUT THIS TIME I'mma NEED For you to do better!  Yeah, that's how i feel right about now.   Someone so familiar is now a mystery...   Tweety and I said we would always say what was on our mind, say what we meant and mean what we say.  So even though I agreed i can't do nothing but hide the truth. I'm soo unhappy... and it has NOTHING to do with her.  I know the last time i posted I said we wasn't friends anymore... (as she would say) "I know... I know... BUT"  It's like God is like this ain't even me and you continuing in it anyways. Not that its a sin, her presence is just a weight on your life.  We had communion at church last night.  I took it and i know if i choose to sin habitually it's over his blood and his body is on my hands and i bring damnation onto myself.  I've learned in the past few days that I have a thing called "emotional dependency"  I was reading the article on that and it was like mind-blowing cus that's how i felt about her. Now the article suggest that you don't tell the person right. So I didn't... but ever since that article I've slowing been backing away.  I mean the kid and me we use to talk like everyday and now... it's not as often but we chit-chat and all that.   Have you seen her?   Have you seen the new me? Naw I don't think you have... but this much I do know... God loved me before he even created me in human form.  He knew me before he formed me in my mother's womb.  So that means that lil babies come from and return to heaven.  Jesus loves the lil children... Children are so special to Jesus.  I bet you think I'm going off somewhere else but I'm not.  The Bible says that anyone who hurts a lil child it was better that they had a mildstone tied around there neck and they be thrown into the sea.  Jesus don't play with people mistreating kids. I bring this up cus I know very soon (sooner then I think) I gotta start working on my autobiography again... and alot of people hurt me when I was a lil kid. Maybe one day I'll actually be able to see a true change in me.  I'm not saying I haven't been changed because I HAVE!  But there are some deep-seeded issues, wounds, hurts and pangs that ONLY Jesus can heal.  My favorite quote as a kid (one of em) "My heart hurts..." as an adult... "I'm stomach broken." Your heart doesn't hurt, your heart doesn't break (maybe your chest but not your heart) and your stomach is what really drops or feels broken when someone hurts you.   Though you slay me, yet will I trust in you and I will SURELY defend my ways to your face.   God is not going to bring me or you out of something and allow us to go back into it, so we can blame him.  The Bible even speaks of not returning to the same bondage from which God broke us from.  I mean more today then 6 months ago... I see a difference. I KNOW TRUTH.  I KNOW in my knower that God didn't make me a lesbian and that I don't have to die that way.  More then anything I don't have to be tormented all my life with thoughts of she and me... her and me... she and then we.  All them lesbians/bi-sexuals who said they tried they obviously didn't try hard enough. The Bible says "Oh taste and see that the Lord is good."  I've been set free... I have the truth in me... and when you KNOW the truth... you are set free. Cus you have attained wisdom to not return to the same ole sin. Yet and I've been here before... some of us are too scared to go on in good and like the children of isreal we would rather see destruction then make it to the promise land.  Well God was a good God, he didn't allow them to return to Egypt and die... nope they died in the wilderness... ain't God just good??? Yes he is.  Now don't get it twisted everyone didn't die... Caleb and Joshua did indeed make it to the promise land.   God loves.   Goodness gracious Lord has anyone in the hood ever tasted this before? Ever been chased by the Lord and submerged in the warmth of the son and then have there face to the floor? I love that verse.  It is sooo very important as people of God that we constantly remind ourselves that  GOD LOVES US!   He loves us just as we are... but he wants to help us change.   Thought of the day:   If you believe you can, you can .

       My birthday has came and gone and I'm Still Alive.   I truly thought my world was going to stop as a kid when I thought of me turning 21.  Such is NOT the case.  God's been talking to me in my dreams and boy he's painting some pretty pictures; of a scared lil girl who isn't ready for his proposal.   I miss you and I KNOW I shouldn't   The unofficial officialness of this situation has left me rather in a hesitation.  To do much of anything these days... thoughts of she... thoughts of we... and a friendship that can never be.  I could just slap myself silly for letting something like this be, again.  We knew from the beginning that us together would most def be some sinning but we continue on hoping to go strong. Hoping to last long and do this thing for the long haul.  No seasonal friendship but something that was going to last a lifetime.  No dramatics no broken hearts and no misconceptions of the feelings we both felt.  Maybe one day we can be friends, maybe one day sister girl will be born again. Maybe one day God will be my husband instead of my best friend.  Maybe I'm trippin and I'll burn in hell in the end.  I don't know... All I do know is that I'm not trying to turn the truth of God into a life, worship the creation more then creator and tell the brotha so what if u did die.  I mean this is my life and who cares if you died for it.  Kill me now cus I'm going forth in it. The mess imagine the hope that is lasting and a chance to seek the unattainable dream.  Yup, that's the lies the devil has been whispering to me. Too many people got me on my knees when they giving me they advice, too many people talking negative causing me some strife.  Can I get a witness to the goodness of God?  Or must I just continue to read my bible since no one wants to praise God?  Iono man... just dramatics is all I see... I want Jesus but I want my friendship back with Tweety.  How do you choose between the one your heart needs and the one your flesh desires?  How do I put out this unquenchable fire.  While all along I know the past and the end of it that I can't allow to be me.  I must put the past behind me and look to newer and better things.  Better days, brighter days... Worship GOD and see what about me will change.  My thoughts my life and the quiet moments it takes me to get there.     It's official... I'm out there... I'm prevalent.   My big bro in Christ... PDL, he put the link to my blog on his site.  Okay sooo.. He has my testimony, he has my online group for women (which right now is chilling slowly) and now he has my blog.  YEAH, we are pretty serious about taking this thing to the masses.  I can see it now... PDL and me our faces on the cover of a TIME magazine, our testimonies being up for reviewing, our lives being looked at under a microscope, the hate begins and the terrorist threats begin and finally finally the world knows THERE IS A SUCH THING AS A FORMER SAME SEX ATTRACTED PERSON.  Humm.. who knew? (God of course)  Before we got here he had a plan.  I just don't see any other female being able to rise up in this thing and do what I'm about to do in the way I'm about to do it.  I just do see any otha brotha doing what PDL is doing, about to do, and is gonna continue to do.  I mean in us we have a powerful, double packed, anointed, appointed, awesome on fire movement ready to burst from the inside of us.  I don't think anybody wants it as bad as us... I could be wrong.  All I do know is... I gotta really start diggin deeper and working on that autobiography.  ALSO... I gotta start typing out the otha book I'm working on.  Within a few weeks it will be a year to the day I started my journal and finally/finally it will be time to umm... unseal the scrolls and let the world know... who star reaLLy is.  I don't think they ready.  I know somebody will buy my book... I'm not down with all that autographing stuff though.  Humm and the question remains will I... Change names and do the star alias or will I use my real name??? humm... Let us (GOD and I) think on these things... LOL.   My thoughts, feelings and reactions on being attracted to another female as of Today.   It just doesn't seem realistic.  My ex's... yeah that's what they are EXACTLY (ex's).  Tweety... humm I'm sure I had some of ya'll worried there for a min.  Well she's (just like my ex's...) never gonna be out the picture but she's not necessarily in the picture, also.  I mean and unlike the rest... I'VE NEVER SEEN THE WOMAN!  Nope, never once...Ever have I seen her in person.  Just email, chat, messenger and phone conversations (if all that can cause me to want to sin) what type of battle you think we really in?  One that is NOT carnal but spiritual.  Let me also add... an attraction to a person does not make you necessarily gay (unless u allow it) I saw it... as merely... Two people who spirits were "knit" we were drawn to each other, possibly consumed/tormented with thoughts of each other... really didn't feel comfortable unless the other one was around.  BUT AGAIN let me reiterate this... We chose GOD... umm hum yup we chose God.  We realized that although we didn't want to lose each others friendship it would be in our best interest.  Now... We didn't stop being friends... We just decided to pull away from each other (DEAL WITH OUR FEELINGS) and if God allows come back and see what's really good.  Now that maybe oh '05 or '06 hey it maybe NEVER.  Point is... We cared enough about each other to realize that if you care about someone, if you REALLY love someone, and you want nothing but the best for them.  Then you are going to realize that giving them the best means (in a situation with circumstances such as this) the best thing is to BAGG-bACK and give each other oh at least 90 feet.  Ohk.. really more but that's only if it's not mutual and you are in a situation were a restraining order, phone number changed and other such precautions are needed.   Thought of the day :  GOD knows what is best... SO just SAY YES!  Read(study) your bible, pray and fast like everyday (okay not fasting though)

      Today has been good... yeah I liked today, today was one of those days I wish I could see again.&nbsp; No drama no nuttin... it was gravy baby!&nbsp; I was so fresh and so clean.&nbsp; I went to my counselor today and he finally figured me out.&nbsp; He was soo happy, I mean he even smiled I just refused to let this man figure me out.&nbsp; Then today he just kind of stumbled on the truth.&nbsp; Now that the truth is out their like darkness to light I have to step up to the plate, seriously.&nbsp; No more being a ministry... I gotta open up like I was a game of chess or some scientifice chemistry.&nbsp; Whew.. okay no.&nbsp; I'm not feeling that one but i'm selling myself short if I don't do so.  I need more space... I'm freaking out feeling bottled up in this small hole I call a room.&nbsp; I need space to breathe a bigger place or something.  Check out something someone said to me today... wow. "i do enjoy reading, knowing and getting to know more about you because your experience is valuable to me."

      Wow... Today was really nice, I had some good church and then I had some even more good church.&nbsp; Today in Sunday School I was asked to give the review, okay I was nervous... but I went up and I said "Praise the Lord." I could of got crunk but i was a lil too nervous for all that.&nbsp; It's only my second time speaking before the church like that.&nbsp; So I just put my head down and read what i wrote down.&nbsp; People were surprised and clapped and all that.&nbsp; After church was over and we was over in the main sanctuary this one guy corrects me on what i said.&nbsp; He didn't agree so I guess he called himself sharing/flexing his godly muscle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now my flesh was crunk i mean i really wanted to rage out but I didn't I just showed loved and realized that this was going to be the norm for me in the near/distance future.&nbsp; During night service we learned about stirring up the gift.&nbsp; Before God can stir up the gift you must repent and be cleansed of your sins.&nbsp; So Bishop called people up to get prayed for and I went down there and the power of God was so strong I almost fell before Bishop even touched me.&nbsp; I was slaid in the spirit down for the count for about close to 15 mins or more.&nbsp; Now here is the exciting part that just shows how REAL GOD is.&nbsp; He said don't get up until you stop speaking in tongues so I didn't.&nbsp; When I did eventually get up I was like weak and almost dizzy.&nbsp; Ready to fall back down and I just don't understand how a man can lay hands on you, you fall back, people help you down to the floor and when you do get up your weak and dizzy.&nbsp; In the natural sense of things he'd have to have pushed me down but he didn't he laid hands on me to stir up the gift inside of me.&nbsp; That's biblical 2 Tim. 1 and I was the first person he laid hands on too.&nbsp; Out of all the people he passed up he touched me first.&nbsp; Truly the Lord loves me and I have to continue to run the race no matter what.   The ministry and me...  I'm developing (the Holy Spirit really) a ministry geared toward helping to give awareness to the ex-gay movement, to empower people to know how to minister to homosexuals and to help homosexuals become delivered.&nbsp; So i'm really excited about that but I realize it's not me nor is it my thing its his. I'm just the "yes" person.&nbsp;&nbsp; Same thing with the book I'm really nervous about them reading my book but they have to before they can write a foreword for it.&nbsp; I let PDL read it so he didn't trip he said it was diamite for what it is for... the youth.&nbsp; All for the kids... lol. So I shouldn't be nervous, it's real. It's my life and nobody elses... ugh&nbsp; mann... this is so the next level.&nbsp; The gifts&nbsp;AND favor of the Lord come without repentence.&nbsp; I could do this in my own doing but I want to do it in his... this is his baby, I am his child.&nbsp; My life (his presence in it) is touching lives and souls everday.&nbsp; I'm planting seeds, souls are getting saved, and God is so getting the glory.&nbsp; I'm just sitting back in awe... at the sight I see.&nbsp; This brotha is really doing some awesome things. "Who woulda thought I'd get to know you this way?"&nbsp; I take peace in that.   Tweety: The truth has been exposed like darkness to light.  I don't have a view on this yet, the jury is still out in my mind.&nbsp; However my girl Dani, she's made her verdict clear and SET in stone.&nbsp; Tweety is dangerous, poison, and NOT delivered.&nbsp; I've come to learn to not go on what others say but to go on what God says.&nbsp; She says I'm sweet on her, I think she's reading into the situation a little TOO much.&nbsp; I like her like a friend; I'm playful, goofy and thats it.&nbsp; However Dani is my twanky, my twinnytwin and she's says different.&nbsp; So Labor Day weekend it's suppose to go down... Cali and Texas about to meet in Da Rock, Arkansas.&nbsp; Dani again the caring individual she is says I shouldn't persue this situation.&nbsp; I should back down.&nbsp; I told her I wasn't and said yeah I'm just saying that but chances are i'm not gonna meet her anyways.&nbsp; We haven't talked about meeting in a while.&nbsp; Maybe she knows/feels&nbsp;like I'm feeling that might not be a good idea.&nbsp; I mean Dani told me this story I'm still wilding off of it.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;prego chick asks her to masage her breast.&nbsp; Okay prego woman are real&nbsp;emotional true BUT "massage her breast" that so&nbsp;ain't God thas the devil.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Tweety is a real emotional female&nbsp;I mean she was emotional before she got prego but now... oh Lord, help us TODAY!&nbsp; She&nbsp;"awed" at the fact that I had a carebear cup with my two favorite characters.&nbsp; We have problems&nbsp;talking on the phone so the jury is hung on the verdict of how it would go down in person.&nbsp; Could&nbsp;two days together really be so bad?&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean a Friday, Saturday and Sunday?&nbsp; Maybe just a Saturday and Sunday&nbsp;type situation.&nbsp; The anointing... it's a high price tag on it.&nbsp; You can't buy this stuff in&nbsp;Wal-Mart.. you have to sacrifice if you think your going&nbsp;to get it.&nbsp; You can't hang around someone and think it's really just gonna rub off like dat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah...&nbsp;I'm going to have to do some more praying on this here situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Their is always that one person who puts a dent in your joy.&nbsp; Who can just by looking at you different ruin your whole day.&nbsp; Now it shouldn't be that way but for some people it is.&nbsp; I can sometimes be one of those people.&nbsp; I'm struggling to stay intact with a situation that occured earlier.&nbsp; My ex Kay found out that I was looking for&nbsp; her ... I really don't know what happen but the jist of it is that she said i was stalking her, she was surprised that I called and that she was upset with what i had to say.&nbsp; I didn't talk to her and I'm not going too.&nbsp; I'm going to continue to allow her to lead her life ... so much went wrong in our relationship I think the only three things I did do right was break up with her, leave her completely alone and just pray for her.&nbsp; Now for anyone who has ever loved (not been in love ... just really have a lot of love for someone) understands that to see someone you care about in this situation its very dishearting.&nbsp; It's a situation I didn't want to have to bare... I was better off not knowing how she was but I had to persue the situation.&nbsp; I had a good reason to persue the situation but I have better reasons to leave it alone.  My little situation has brought a lot to light, it's made me seek out people I wouldn't have otherwise wanted to talk too.&nbsp; I mean I love my ex's all of them and they ... they "care" for me not as much as i care for them.&nbsp; I mean i don't know... we all have to live our lives and we all have decisions and mistakes to make, that don't seem right but whatever.&nbsp; Maybe I used my situation with Tweety to hide the obvious which is I don't know right now.&nbsp; I don't know... I'd give anything to make things right for Kay. I'd fly down to Houston and bring her back with me and let her stay with me and be a freaking sponge until she got her head back together.&nbsp; I'd do my best to keep her away from the people of her past.&nbsp; Then I realized nobody did that for me and that only makes you want what you can't have more.&nbsp; Their is no logic in this situation... she would rather spend her money on weed then pay her rent. She's about to get evicted because she can't pay all her rent but she wants to buy weed.&nbsp; Her roomate doesn't even have a job and her roomate is a waste... I mean literally.&nbsp; Her life is a waste.&nbsp; She doesn't have a job, she doesn't go to school and she don't even have a car.&nbsp; I think the only thing she's doing right now is keeping Kay out of some trouble so for that I thank her.&nbsp; But for the extra unneccesary drama she's adding into her life... save that there!  God! Yo, this is one of those times I don't understand why things gotta be this way.&nbsp; I realize she's gotta make the choices the decisions but at the same time you can stop her from going this way.&nbsp; It's God alone that keeps me from going back.&nbsp; I want to go back... I do.&nbsp; Not to the lifestyle but to attempt to rescue her... ugh i gotta go...

        u were the 1st to plant that "seed" in my head and it actually flowered and blossomed into something. U were the 1st person i've ever been drawn to over the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Im sure there are others.... Star let me tell u something. I'm the last person u should feel nervous with over this. I understand more than what u think i do. I know u a little bit better than what u think i do. I'm not easily shocked when it comes to u for one reason or another, trust me. Anyway, u r special Ms. Star. U must be extra special to be a major character in the bestseller Book of Ms. Tweety's life!!! Dont forget that okay? -Tweety      Well their you have it, Tweety has read my blog now. So everything is out in the open and everything is everything.&nbsp; I was stressing myself for nothing... lol.&nbsp; To make this situation extra special i want to break out with a poem, hey I gotta sharpen my skills daily, feel me?  JuLy 20, 2004   The truth has been exposed like darkness to light    no longer am I hiding everything is plainly in sight    no more power of suggestion because     their isn't anything else to suggest     &nbsp;   I've been hiding the truth    and on the inside i've felt like a mess    how can someone be the epitome of my everything?    is it possible to find your mr. or misses everything?     &nbsp;   To see through this deception    this disillusion    that caused me so much confusion    finally i rise, no I stand!     &nbsp;   For, the truth has been exposed like darkness to the light.     &nbsp;   Just a little something something I put together yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;      How's life right now?&nbsp;  It's real vague right now... I have so much going on you know.&nbsp; Few things are constant and fewer things seem bareable right now.&nbsp; Work... I loathe it! Play... I loathe it more!&nbsp; Temptations man.. that's all it is a brotha(satan) always trying to set someone up for failure.&nbsp; However what most people don't know is that you have to be tempted first before he can set you up.&nbsp; So for that individual it was their bad first on their part.&nbsp;      Tweety ... everything is "Everything." &nbsp;    &nbsp;iono I just feel like banging my head into a steel pipe until something their makes sense.&nbsp; Have i gained or have I lost?&nbsp; That is the question...&nbsp; She read this is here blog (I just wanted to add it again.)&nbsp; It doesn't sit bad with me so i guess it sits well... lol.&nbsp; My thoughts on her never cease to amaze me, I mean they just flow like a ocean and deep... whew they be deep.&nbsp; I'm talking you can stand in them deep.&nbsp; I feel like, no I'm sure everything is going fairly well in my life right now and it's like the enemy wants to hang this one little thing over my head.&nbsp; Not cool not cool at all.&nbsp; You can only push people way for so long until one day they stop coming back.&nbsp; So I choose not to push her away I'm just going to back up again and see what comes to the light.&nbsp; That way I can keep myself focused on HIM and allow myself to stay in his perfect peace.&nbsp;    One of the things I find myself questioning myself about... knowledge is power.&nbsp; When you have a lot of knowledge about a situation you have a lot of power.&nbsp; You can use that to your advantage, you can ruin people, i mean you can destroy lives and families, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody but God should have that kind of power.&nbsp; So why did I give it to Tweety?&nbsp; Right now I'm so blind-sided to most of the things that are going on around me.&nbsp; I have "acquired" some issues in my life that I don't want to freely talk on yet.&nbsp; It's on a need to know basis (more like I need you to know).&nbsp; My parents don't even know and I may not ever tell them.&nbsp; So I have to avoid my parents to keep my mouth shut and after a while that's gonna get stressful.&nbsp; Secrets they ruin peoples health.  The thing I question myself on the most (and if your in my predicament you should be too).&nbsp; Is it better to feel it alone or for both of you to feel the same way?&nbsp; Is it better to feel it alone and not tell the other person or tell the other person even though they don't feel the same way?&nbsp; Now if they do feel the same do you change your situation and persue whatever you thought you felt? Do you try to continue to make things the same? or do you just simple back away and say goodbye?&nbsp; Questions... questions... so many questions.&nbsp; What I will say is this, when you can't find the words to say... when you've run out of words to say... when you've tried everything else...  just say the name of Jesus.    Seasons... seasons...   It's my time, the wait is over... I can finally walk into my season.&nbsp; I've talked to 3 of my ex(s) their is only one I have yet to talk too.&nbsp; Man... if you read back in January you'll see the frustration I had behind her and&nbsp;now&nbsp;I'm totally at peace.&nbsp; So talking to her isn't sitting to well with me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;NEED TOO... but I don't want too.&nbsp; She so far off into sin man... I need her to get on my level before I go there.&nbsp; I'm not going&nbsp;down to her level not again... never no more!&nbsp; So how do I accurately tell her the things I need to say without&nbsp;actually saying them to her?&nbsp; Write a letter?&nbsp; Work the situation to were I can get her address I'm like so close to getting in contact with her its ashame.&nbsp; It's so God!&nbsp; For the past umpteen months (a little over six think back to january) I haven't talked to her nor have&nbsp;we had away to communicate with each other. NOW WE DO... come on that's God.&nbsp; The more&nbsp;I seek out his face I get to see just who this Jesus really is.&nbsp; An&nbsp; I just need to brag for a second... he got ALLLLLL&nbsp;POWER...&nbsp;I mean ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL POWer in his hands.&nbsp; He can make the winds and waves behave, he can&nbsp;make&nbsp;the devil flee, he can raise the dead and he delivered me.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;people just don't understand.&nbsp; I'm still learning.&nbsp; I'm not perfect naw not even close but he loves&nbsp;me (he doesn't love my sin).&nbsp; I'm tired now... so I'm going&nbsp;to go to bed.   Thought&nbsp;for the day:   Take the worse situation you've been in and just remember somebody else has been through something worser then you. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

          It was the biggest blow ever to my stomach!       What can I say?&nbsp; I feel like I've had the wind punched out of me and I'm choking on my own poisons.&nbsp; How do you jump back up and just live life?&nbsp; You don't or rather you feel like you can't but you can and you MUST!&nbsp; Goodness ...wow.      the words are there... they just their stuck in the midst of my anguish, pain, and shame.&nbsp; My book is with the publishing company and they are looking over it.&nbsp; So in a few days/weeks I'll be getting an answer and then I can go back to my ex-s and say "Well girls looks like your going to be famous."&nbsp; Just not under your own names... lol.&nbsp; I've told two of them and they both said that they were cool with it as long as I didn't use their real names.&nbsp; However they have no idea that in this book real names used or not it doesn't matter, the truth will be told.&nbsp; So I guess since I know where to find the other one I'll tell her while other people try to help me find the last one.      thats all i got.          &nbsp;

       Why ask for help if you just choose to punk out anyway?   That's what has seem to have happened, this female sends me a note on my blackplanet page asking for help.  Then today I go on blackplanet and I see she has hooked back up her gay personal page.  Is not that something?  Yes it is!  Like I tell them, though... you can not do what I do even if you tried!  I can barely do it, it takes Jesus God's only son.  If you think okay I'm going to leave females alone break up with my exs and that's the end of it.  You have been D-E-C-I-E-V-E!  yup, I put that on everything, if this is truly your battle you are going to have to face the war.  I can't hate on her or all the others like her, everybody is not going to be able to walk away from homosexuality just like that.  but um.. I'mma gon brush my shoulder off!  Cus umm I did that!  Working on a year and six months... ha!  My potnah said that she might of just been asking for help to see if I would try to holla at her or something, I don't know what her motives are but uh, all these lesbians trying to step to a sista like they got something I want... Puhlease.  I've already got what I want, I've already got who I want, and I've already got the friends that I need.      oh yeah for all the chicks who thinking or stepping to me like I want their man... Puhlease move around.  That seems to be the new course of action, he can't tempt me with women so agravate me by have other women's men or just men in general come at me like they have losted their mind.  I don't even wanna go any deeper on that just know PRAY FOR ME!!! A girl going through.   So explosive: the truth is...  Tweety and I just can't seem to get this thing right.  Last night she was online doing her thing, talking to her people and I was doing the same.  So right at 12am she hits me up wanting to talk to me.  I'm thinking okay this whole time you've been on you've only said three sentences to me, so why NOW you wanna shoot the breeze with me? So I came off a lil defensive and she was just like okay wait whats wrong?  I didn't want to tell her and I figured "comes to the light...everything."  If I expose the devil NOW then that will give him less room to move around in this area of my life.  So I said what I had to say and she did the same and she got real quiet for like 15 mins... okay HELLO at 100am you DONT do that! Especially when I have to be up by oh atleast 630/645 so I was just like I'm tired so I'mma holla be easy. I didn't give her a chance to say bye I just bounced, rather I went inivisble but I was still their.  Sooo after I leave then she leaves, I'm not trying to push her away, or even hurt her nothing like that.  I just wanted her to get a full eyes view of what I'm going through.  Love her like a twin sister (thats some love) but sometimes you just gotta... back away and see what comes to light, or more so back up and see if this situation is healthy for both people involved. I don't want to loose her friendship, I don't.  However, I know if I have too God will ease the pain, and then again maybe their won't be any pain at all.  It's wild though, I don't get the devil no props!! God already got this here on lock.   Texas Justice: the tv show.  I was watching it today while I was getting my hair done and you know what... they said at the end does somebody own you some money and they don't want to pay up? Yo I was smooth thinking of BLACK.  I sho wanted to take her on that show for that money.  I just know in my heart of hearts that that issues isn't resolved within me.  I just know I need to be a woman about mines and step up and say something to her. Just be like I want you to say "Star, I lied I had no intentions of paying you back nor will I ever, I bascially used you for your money and your a fool for not seeing it.  (ya'll don't want to know what I'm thinking in my mind. lets just say its RATED R for LANGUAGE and VOILENT CONTENT.)  Yo, she yelling she a christian so as my sister in Christ... I gotta let it go.  Periodz.  I'm going to pray about that thing on a serious tip.  At this time I have no comments on my book.  It is what it is and yeah I'm working on it, I don't have a publisher or a editor, but I know who I'd like to use.  So I'm just patiently waiting, fasting and praying that God moves by his spirit and as he commands me to go forth in whatever direction, I go.    Thought of the day:  The Christian walk is a daily fight you have to fight.

      They say that the storm must come before the rainbow comes.  I know this to be true, I also know that no matter what comes my way God has my best interest at heart.  So it is hard for me to shake the pain and frustration I feel.  A friend of mines, who I really could be close too (but I can't) her boyfriend/ex-boyfriend (their label is really undefined right now) He hit on me a few weeks ago, I guess about two weeks now.  I wanted to tell her and I wasn't going too but she said to me, do you have something to tell me?  It was like she knew and I mean we haven't talked since before today and I haven't said a word.  So I told her... I kind of struggled with it but I did.  This further frustrates me because it seems as if I've spent a good part of my life being a homewrecker.  Or rather the object of men's affection and they (most of them) go about it the wrong way.  Iono...  I just refuse to allow this situation get me down.  It is bad enough that I had to give my friend some bad news about her boy.  They was having problems already but I mean, I Don't want any part in that at all.  God knows what's best you know... so I'll try to just give it up and let it go.   Feels like I've walked out of Heaven...  As I was sitting in the car with my friend, the radio began to play "walked out of Heaven."  Now for those that don't know words have more then power, music is a spirit and songs bring back memories, trigger incidents or feelings and sometimes that ain't even cool.  For instance, everytime I hear "Walked Out of Heaven" I imediately think back to Kay when she sent me this video.  It gripped me like huh?  I just began to tune my friend out and really just think about the words to that song, for a second.  Then I went to thoughts of Kay and then I came back to the world and my friends conversation.   other lil misc. facts of the day...  I guess someone forgot to tell me but it seems a certain ex of mines is pregnant.  I found this bit of information out today and I took it quite well.  I mean I have too, I'm just taken by surprise that's all I don't have any other way to feel.    my book- A Year of Change.  The game is so shady and cut throat.  It's hard to get a chance, ultimately I am frustrated with the way the situation looks.  However, the Holy Spirit brought back to my mind something someone said once or twice, YOU MUST BE A INSTRUMENT RATED CHRISTIAN.  Meaning you must know what to do in any kind of weather or situation.  When the world tells me no and God tells me yes, I must walk by faith and not by sight.  Obey God's voice and continue on even in the merky waters of this situation.  I have to come up with $2000 dollars to get the editor I want to work on my book.  After being frustrated because I thought I was never going to find her, then I find her and I hit this stumbling block.  God has brought me too far to leave me and I'll continue on in faith.  I'm not even going to think a head to work will happen when I get to the publishers.  I must keep myself surrounded by positive people who have God's best interest at heart for me.  It seems to be time to do some more weeding out.   The funny thing about health After doing some reading on displayia, I found out that all I really have to do is take my vitamens and eat 5 fruits and veggies a day to basically keep it away.  Something so serious that could eventually lead to cancer can be stopped by something so simple.  I can't do 5 veggies or fruits a day and I'm struggling to take my vitamens everyday.  However now that I know that my health is on the line.  I'm going to work harder, I'm going to attempt to work harder.  As my girl JAM would say..."Flawless days... flawless ways." I'm waiting on that to be self evident for me.    Thought of the day: I trust you Lord, alone.

       is in my dreams  I had a dream about Shawna this morning, it was rather Rated-R for sexual content (girl on girl action).  It was weird... I... we... were kissing and I was thinking you know why am I kissing her? I was thinking I don't like going back with people who have been with other people. So I couldn't understand why I kept on kissing her.  It wasn't like a I just started kissing her, I was laying on top of her and I was talking to her and kissing on her and then we eventually started kissing.  Weird dream... but it doesn't mean anything because the only way I'll be seeing Shawna these days is just in MY DREAMS.   I finally faced Amy...  I sent her a note today apologizing for what I said and what I did the last time we spoke.  Believe it or not I feel better, and I know when she reads it she's going to be like what tha?  I know.  Negative and positive energy I put the negative energy ball into her court and I put the positive energy ball back into mines.     Pray for me... the spirit is trying to attack me.  Maybe I shouldn't have been braggin about the fact that I'm free from the spirit of homosexuality.  Lately, just really today and a little bit of yesterday the spirit of homosexuality has been attacking me.  Through the power of suggestion... suggesting I give up the fight and the ghost and go back to my flawless life.  Wasn't nothing flawless about my life, it was only flawless in my head.  Trying to draw me back in with pictures of happy gay couples, my stomach cringes at a photo of two girls kissing, or the sight of a nekked women (I don't want no part of that anymore) So you know what time it is... time to POWER-UP get a double dose of the formula cus just one dose won't do.  Go Mach 3 and put on the full armour of God, its war time again... yup and I do as the Bible commands again, Therefore Now submit yourself to God, and the devil will flee.  Bring my thoughts into the obedience of Christ and keep all things subject to him.     What I've learned  What I've learned in this whole process of things is that your not going to change over night, change is gradual, consistant and God is going to guide and direct you to it.  If you allow him entrance into every area of your life he will expose all those things to  you and he will guide you through the process of healing.  I understand how completely easy it is to lose your way as you attempt to come out of this life.  You just gotta have faith and Lnow that God is bigger then any obstacle you have to climb. I refuse to allow my past to dictate my future any longer.  True deliverance comes when you have secured a personal relationship with God, it is through that relationship that the desire to change will come.  it is through that relationship that you will want to cling to him and should when test or trials come, you know where your help comes from it comes from the Lord.  You will focus on him and focus on pleasing him.  You say your eyes are on God, but your not obeying the law.  What god is your eyes really on?   Some Christians just as bad as the world.  I positively don't like that, it gives the real men and women of God a bad name.  Before people tack on the label "I AM A CHRISTIAN." Someone with some truth needs to sit them down and tell them what being a christian is really about.  It isn't just accepting Christ into your life and then you continue doing the same ole things.  When you accept Christ into your life, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU CHANGES. LET ME REPEAT IT AGAIN SO I CAN HELP MYSELF... EVERYTHING.  Nothing should stay the same, that's why I constantly pray "Lord, anything that is in me that isn't like you take it out, anything that I do that isn't pleasing you, show me.  Give me clarity so I can hear from you and only you."  Their is so much heresy and confusion even the saints of God are getting disillusioned. Thank God for the Holy Spirit.   Thought of the day ...  We can't do anything on our own it takes God alone.

      Yeah that's a good way to start it off, Andrea... whew.  Her words man, words have power, if you take the right person with the right words anything is possible.  Look at the history books, Black Panther Party, Adolph Hitler, Malcom X, Stalin, and all them other wacked out phsyco people out in the world.  Now I'd never tell her this but her words those words, deep man.  She wants to be a singer one day, forget singing man! Get out their into the poetry community it's all about spoken word the free verse.  She's such a mystery, even with all our history and it amazes me that I have been allowed entrance into her soul...  I kind of just chilled today and wrote a poem to kind of spin off these thoughts and our conversation last night.  I'm feeling really poetic lately here goes...  Reading in between the lines not quite paying attention to the actual words hoping somehow not to be confined by our poetic offerings to each other  Speechless sometimes amazed to how close our thoughts are or how much closer they could be sometimes hearing the same voices sometimes thinking the same things  Still quite the mystery even with our bit of history finally unreserve you allow me entrance into your soul as you inhale-exhale let your thoughts go through your words  Can I go a little deeper, exposing my inner being? Their isn't anyone else all my references and thoughts are souly on you  Our eternal essences combined together to show this to be proof. Questions cloud my head with confusion The power of suggestion suggest we should be a union  We constantly push each other away to only come back closer am I the antidote to your ailment or are you this black womens kryptonite  Nothing is forever except forever we swear up and down no feelings are their so are you tempting me or am I tempting me?  Give me a second and let me rewind back through time, in your mind to a place were better days exist, but  allow me to expose the confusion that has us both disillusioned were we will... Repent, regroup, don't do it again, and say amen.  Through deception you entered, but through truth you will leave.  Welcome to freedom.     Comes to light... comes to light  I can't get this chick out my head!  Maybe I should pray for her and hopefully the thoughts of her  will pass my way.  I don't know but it has been a rather strange two days.  Amy is in my head not in the back not in the front but somewhere in the middle just kind of hanging around.  It's amazing what you learn about people when you just read their thoughts or even have real profound conversations with them.  I didn't know that she lost her father, kind of makes me not want to take mine for granted so much.  Their is still a lot of pain their and I know more then anything God wants to be allowed entrance into my soul to heal it.  All that excess baggage you hold onto it for so long its kind of hard to imagine letting it go.  You should never leave things salty you never know when people are going to need you.  Unfortunately, I was reading 2 Corinthians 6 today and I was feeling really convicted about the part were it says do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.  Now in the world we live in everyone (almost) is basically just an unfruitful work of darkness.  I already sit in my room alone, to myself, twiddling my thumbs most of the time. But I plan on making better use of my time, read all these books I bought last year and maybe study for this test, that if I don't pass I will be getting kicked out of the military.  Oh well... I'm really feeling that Jill Scott song "comes to light" its so real because everything does come to light, whatever is done in darkness is going to be exposed to the light.  Being exposed although it hurts when you get caught its good for the soul because it brings about confession which gives for the opportunity for repentence.   I'm in love with the idea of being in love  That hasn't changed in one days time.  I think or rather I know men are slowly trying to step to me.  No matter how interested I might be I always feel like I'm settling and you can't be completely happy with someone if in the back of your mind you feel like you are settling.  Besides every man that approaches me I see them as the same thing, distractions.  I'm not ready for love, relationships or anything close to dating.  I want to know who God is and who I am and who I can be in God.  I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, I've flat out sinned a lot in my life.  That feeling so does not feel good to know I've just disobeyed God and I can't fix whatever it was he wanted me to do.  I just try to draw strength from Romans 8:28 everything happens for a reason, the good and the bad.

       ALL I DO IS SECOND GUESS HER...  Whew, okay now that I have gotten that out of the way I can go on to talk about other thangs.  Tweety, Amy,  Tigger, my health and some other things.  First real quick topic, Tweety... It has come to my attention that (she ain't going no where) not that I wanted her too.  It's more a I be thinking we done, we through and then here she pops up like "Hey Star" throwing a girl off.  However, I'm realizing her pattern, we talk a few days straight we go a few more days straight with no talking and hey here she pops up again. (Like a normal friendship, right?) Right.  So today was one of those days were we talk about the deeper things, without really talking about them.  We kind of (I think) we talked in between the lines got beyond the surface more to the shape of things, turning circles into squares and squares into circles.  Seriously it wasn't quite that deep but it took her one sentence to just floor me. She said and I quote for verbatim "yea i know u like that huh?"  I was shook well beyond words, I was jaw-dropped and I just started laughing.  Who knew that a conversation about poetry could end up flooring me. All I did was ask her what she thought the poem was about then I responded yeah I like the way you worded that and then she responded "yeah i know you like that huh?"  It was kind of a surprise to me that's all.  Personally I'm feeling 10,000 pounds lighter because I shared my poems "Sacrifice"  and "I'm in love with the idea of being in love" with her.  It truly is hard to not like her personality, I mean she read the poem sacrifice (which is about her) and saw it for what it was exactly without adding or taking away anything from it.  She never once mentioned that the poem was about her, I mean of course she knew... she had too.  I think I'm pretty sure she knows, I made comments about it at least.  The part that trips me out is that she was speechless beyond words on that poem,  she had nothing to say, she couldn't even read it more then once.  I know the feeling that poem is so surreal, it really grips you and exposes the hidden things and makes you ashamed to even read it again because it's like hey this is about me.  I'm the one doing this and I know I shouldn't be, I can't read this again.  Then the one I wrote today, "I'm in love with the idea of being in love."  That one more so keeps it real with how society is so infactuated with the idea of love, thinking its the real thing.  She was really feeling that one too, she's a true artististic artist... my she has a way with words.  She wasn't the only one either, Lisa, she's out their making a name for herself writing books of poetry.  Shawna and Tina, their writing really has potential if they really explored their artistic depths.  I like to wait until the words hit me and I let them flow and I let them go.  So even though writing is relaxing it, poetry just like fictional books it's a seasonal thing for me.   A picture is like a flashback into the past...  I want to open up and talk about someone I never really spoke on, except in passing.  She was one of the three people whose essence really got to me.  Who is she?  lets just call her Amy.  Just like all the rest I met her in the lesbian chatroom.  After sitting down and rereading my thoughts, I realized just how important it was for me to stay away from the lesbian chatroom.  That is where I met every single one of my exs except Rachel.  Amy sticks out to me in away that no other has not even Tweety.  Amy appeals to me in the sense that I wanted to be were she is by the time I turn 22.  As far as having a college degree, computer saavy, made funny, just really all around goofy, tell it like it is, knows the words to like every gospel sing (really the old negro spirituals) and she from the durty durty ATLSHAWTY.  So for these reasons and more we clicked, and again my old arch nemesis saw a oportunity to get an in (on the inside of me).  I told an associate what I was going through and she comforted me and told me that I hadn't done anything wrong.  I wasn't sexually attracted to her, I was mentally attracted to her intelligence.  Which is the truth and nuttin but the truth.  So I was like whew, brush the sweat off my brow.  We need we could of had something... and after what Andrea and I went through, I really wasn't trying to get close to anyone.  So we realized since she was gay and I was not that a friendship between us (a close one) it just wasn't going to work.  I was looking at some old pictures today, kind of checking my progress seeing who picture I look at and I still have some type of emotional pangs.  Today it was her picture, I don't think I ever really dealt with the issues of the hurt that she caused.  I mean she's a great person but ultimately she isn't so great for me.  She's like one of those religious lesbians wanna talk about keeping her eyes on God, and God keeping his eyes on  her when by her being gay she is so totally blinded she can't even see him.  Sure she following god (the devil) she ain't following or keeping her eyes focused on Jesus.  I'm just glad I'm not blackmoses (Harriet Tubman) leading all the lesbians to freedom.  Don't get me wrong I'm going to tell it like it is, but sometimes its hard to tell certain the truth and that the truth is they are worshipping a lie.  So that's my little spill on Amy, I was drawn to her I am no longer drawn to her.  She ruined a good thing with me and I'm glad for it.  Cus her being gay could of ruined me.   What would my posts be without a thought on Tigger.  okay that's all I have that is my thought.   My life... my health and my faith in the Lord.  Very few people know that I am as soon would say "Sick" but I don't receive it.  My grandmother and I have prayed about it and I'm good, delivered from the hand of the enemy.  I found out in January that I had a disease called dysplasia (I can't spell it).  I had a surgery to remove the abnormal cells on my cervix that were causing the disease to find out last week.  The cells had came back but not as bad, in times like these their are only two people I can run to and only one actually gives me comfort and peace.  The Holy Spirit! That is my best friend... ya'll don't understand, he has given me a peace that surpasses all understanding.  I'm only 21 years old and I've had to deal with a lot of things and some of it I have brought on myself (a lot actually) but GREAT is the price of the anointing of God on my life.  This ain't no cake walk, no tea party, no lets pretend and play house situation.  This is life or death... my life or my death.  So the question I hear him say is, "when will you let me into your soul?" and the soul is what? Mind, intellect and conscience.  After a long hard day of doing nothing, I'm tired again.

      I'm in love with the idea of being in love but love isn't in love with me I can no longer see myself loving  another human being I can no longer see myself taking on the pain he will bring to love someone takes  strength, trust, and full heart no emptiness, not someone wounded, not someone broken from the start see thats the thing about people and love  they think that two broken halfs can make a whole can lift up a soul and give them back  what was once stolen from them but no  I'm just in love with the idea of being love I'm not ready to take that path again to lose yet another friend and end up running to God to mend my heart again can't you see that love is more then words its something that you mean it's not just words you say it's an action that you show everyday selfless sacrifice, obedience, communication one in the same love as musiq would say so many people use your name in vain thinking by finding someone else you'll find love thinking that sleeping with someone you'll get love thinking that by uttering those words someone will love you but no, again you are playing yourself like a fool  So yeah I'm just in love with the idea of being in love the moonlit walks on the beach holding hands strolling through the park cards and flowers that come from the heart saying I love you and it really meaning something hearing I love you and you know its true with no doubts from the start  that the one who is saying it isn't true  I think I'll stay in love with the idea of being in love for the ideal of it is soo surreal less drama and the less pain i'll have to feel it's when you allow yourself to love you must allow yourself to feel pain i'm not ready for that strain  or the mental drain that a man will bring into my life worrying if he loves me and will one day want me as his wife worried if he will cheat on me and leave me for another man scared of that more then another women even though both could leave me with a disease leaving me with more unease having to explain to our children why daddy left mommy having to explain to our children why they think daddy don't love em having to explain to our children why daddy don't love me man hold up, thank God its just a dream  I think I'll stay in love with the ideal of being in love can't pay the price just yet, still trying to get my life right still dealing with the fact that I use to crave women steal dealing with the fact that here I am 21 and i'm still living  Love regardless to the pain, I still will choose you first. Just know I'm only in love with the idea of being in love.

      Tonight I did one of those few things I've said I wouldn't do. Not because it's so much a sin, but because it isn't good for me. I chilled with one of the girls in my dorm and we watched movies. We watched romantic comedies and you know how those are sweet and sappy. Then you watch the happy couple go off together into the wind. I'm not keen on the idea of being in love, I'm more in love with the idea of being in love. I don't want to confuse lust with love, people seem to do that and in the process change partners because of it. I've come to realize and understand that I have to first learn how to love God before I can understand how to love myself or anyone else. All this self-esteem, self-love, self-improvement, self-loathing... self, self, self. That isn't how God operates, and I see that and that's key. So yeah I'm in love with the idea of being in love, but I'm not neccessarily ready to be in lust/love with someone else.

       So much... to say... so much has been done!  I've been waiting for a minute to do this one... get out my thoughts and feelings and just bam put it on the page. Yeah but I didn't know how to start it off, were to being or even what to say. Right now I'm upset and I can't even tell you why. Something so stoopid and untrivial went down with Tweety yesterday and its lasted into today. She's all like don't be upset about things that aren't worth being upset about. WELL she's only looking at the small picture I'm looking at the bigger picuture. I'm a giver and I have to give... I HAVE too and it's like I can't give anything really to our friendship. I can't put in much time, ain't no more effort needed, and all that. So I'm like okay well she's prego I'll get her something. I bought her two books right and I told her all excited thinking she'd be like wow thanks, Star (which she was). But before she did she drop this bomb on me that someone gave her a hundred dollar gift certificate to get some stuff. So today she was like yeah you can take the books back. I throw up my hands of that situation. Then cus I went shopping yesterday I bought the first lady of my church some books too that I know she wanted to read. She was like really happy and excited because she wanted those books but she forgot to get them. I felt blessed because I was able to bless her, you know. She appreciated my gift, she WANTED my gift and it's like i look at Tweety and me and WE suppose to be closer then that... cooler then that and she was just like you know thank you soooo much BUT I don't need it. As usual I'm sure I'm over reacting but this is a usual with her and I. I TRY to do something nice and it ALWAYS blows up in my fast. I've only seemed to been able to do ONE thing right in our whole friendship. That was ENDING IT and praying for her soul salvation. Kinda makes you wonder where our friendship is going from here.  I mean for the longest time we've been on the same page just different level... I sent her a IM that said if no one else said I love you today.. the I do and look how she responded "awww. how sweet. thank u. i love u 2. "  She's all cool with everything and I'm all stressing and getting upset for nothing.  People don't understand if you get the devil and his angels and inch they gonna go for that mile.  I just gotta put my flesh unda subjection and PRAISE GOD!   Shane... is gone WAY south of the border.   He should be in the Domician Republic by now and if not he'll be there soon.  I was suppose to go to his going away/birthday pary last weekend but I didn't. I didn't really wanna go I mean God wanted me to go and all. I just didn't want to see him... I don't do goodbye's really well and I know he was mad because he wanted to see me but he has his oportunity to see me and well he chose different. I was nice enough that when I came to Memphis two weekends before I told him I was there. Knowing Shane has showed me I'm not ready for marriage in the slightest. He was everything I wanted and more (of what I didn't) in a husband. Apart of us really wanted to be each others ONE. Well thank God that is over now. I pray God uses him mightily in the Domician Republic he is gonna be there for a WHOLE year! He might enjoy himself so much and stay longer... lol.   Nothing else matters... having God THERE is all that makes a difference!   The heart of a man.... while most judge on outer appearance God judges on the heart.  Emotional rollercoaster life feels like... I'm saying I should be on cloud 9 right now. My book is getting published, I went on this MAD shopping spree yesterday. i mean MAD! I went to church today (although I was way late to second service) it was off the chain. Nothing else matters.. don't none of that mean anything to me if I don't have peace inside of me. I LOVE GOD WITH MY HEART, My mind, and My soul! So why don't my actions portray that? Why do I feel like I'm faking the funk or that the funk has taken over me? I'm doing things I said I wouldn't do.. I'm allowing people to curse around me, I'm allowing people to listen to secular music around me, I'm listening to secular music, I'm buying men's clothes, i'm buying hoochie mama clothes, I'm drinking, and I'm flirting with women. What is WRONG With me? and then I went to church and I found out what was wrong with me. My lack of quality time in worship with the Lord has made me weak, allowing the enemy to come in and do whatever to me. I'm saying... it's time for consecration. Avoiding EVERYBODY as much as I can. Saving my money so I can get my car so I don't have to depend on ANYBODY else but God alone. I have God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit on my side I'm ride or die, carrying my cross for life. God is trying to bless me and it isn't because i deserve it cus TRUST ME I DON'T. I'm just a ripple in a pound of showing GOD's goodness upon man.  This lady in my church God blessed her with a BRAND NEW CAR... he wanted me to go to her so I could hear her testimony. It really increased my faith, she had no money, no intentions of buying a car and she walked smack dab into her miracle through obedience (eventually). I'm trying to get it right the FIRST time. October 1st... focus on getting my car... but first I must focus on passing my EOC. If I don't I will get kicked out the air force and back in Houston with no idea what I'm going to do. I refuse to go out like a failure, I hate the air force with a passion, I so want to get out BUT not like this. I'm not a failure, I'm not a quitter and I'm not a slacker *when I care* it's really hard to get myself to care about the air force. That's a whole notha story why for anotha day.  Surely I would lose my mind if I didn't focus on Jesus. Thank you JESUS for all the ways you've made and so much more... like dying on the cross for my sins... you didn't have to do it but I'm SO VERY GLAD you DID! i'm out. more erratic thoughts, more senseless nonesense, and more drama from my life.. stay tune until next time.

       but don't think I'm just able to dance in the sun  I'm taking my freedom and putting it in God's hands. A lot of people are ignorant to the truth, seriously ignorant. I got the greatest news since the last bit of good news. Not even 30 mins later, I get to my job and my boss is killing my good mood. I haven't gotten to that place where i can just push the negativity to the side and focus on the positives. Can't nobody bask in my joy with me right now the way I want them too. So i'm going to just praise GOD cus he can... allow his presence to premiate my body and allow the Holy Spirit to comfort me.   Do I look like a bank?  I don't know any other way to say it. First my best friend asks me for $20 dollars, then my mom asks me for $100 and NOW Tigger asked me for $30. Grant it because of where I was I was unable to get into it with her on the details and when I called her back she didn't answer nor did she call me back. I simply said I DON'T mix friendship with money. However, I feel the Lord is like "go a head and give it to her no matter what it is. I supply all your needs, you don't have to worry about a thang." That's what he is saying.  I asked her about it and now its like she got amnesia or something she don't know or recall it. She say she was sleep when she called me. So I tried to call her back and you know see what was up, humm. She gave me the usual umm i'mma call you back. The next time that happens i'mma be like NAW, how about you NOT call me back and just delete my number out your phone. This so called friendship is a waste of my time, energy and its messing with the anointing of God on my life. I can get crunk now that the truth is out there. I can be like and besides you already stepped up to the plate and told me how u felt about me so for real for reals I don't need to be around you. Bottom line, your gay and you like me, I'm not and I don't like you like that. Fall back!   It's offically OFFICIAL.... I'm on my wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!  First and foremost giving honor to God, from whom all blessings flow. My pastor for being my pastoral covering, whew I go to an awesome Church!!! EMC... Evangelistic Ministries Church!!! God is doing things for me.. not because I deserve because I don't, not because I have need of it because I don't, not because I asked it for my own good cus I didn't. But because it perfects his will for my life and it's gonna benefit others. The way I see my life right now.. I'm prolly gonna end up being one of those awesome woman of God who win many souls for God and still end up in hell. I know I shouldn't feel that way but I do... I found out yesterday that they are gonna publish my book, I should be excited right? So why am I not?? It's hard to get that joy you know...     So I told Tweety the good news and this is what she had to say about it... "  I never had any doubts, that is great. I am so very happy for you!" It helps when you have people who believe in you but it helps more when you believe in God and yourself.     As far as our friendship goes i realize that when she isn't around, like when we haven't talked for a while, I'm good, I'm GREAT even. But if we talk .. like if we start a convo and mid convo she just stops talking I get kinda paturb about it. I won't say nothing.. I won't say a word... like if it's been a week or so that we haven't talked I won't say nuttin. I don't say nothing about nothing really. I want our friendship to work and if it means putting aside all the lil things that bother me then I will. Don't get me wrong if I told her what was on my mind she'd listen and she'd be like "what's wrong... do I do something wrong?" She'd be concerned. Its just kinda frustrating when you care about someone a lot and you really value their friendship and you want to nurture it and help it grow but circumstances say otherwise. We are two different people in two different area codes, two different states, in two different time zones, and our lives are going in two different directions. She's almost 5 months pregnant and I'm about to start making transitions to focus more on my ministry and my Air Force Career.  Dani said something a few days back that the Holy Spirit is bringing back to my rememberance. I always catergorize her in the list with my ex(s) as if she was one also. Which is SO not... we never even talked on that level but the attraction was there... the emotional feelings was there. Now we are good we don't talk on the phone, we barely talk to each other and we've pretty much gotten rid of the emotional attachment we had to each other. I mean i could sit her and let my whole blog be about her and how we met. We were drawn to each other I mean, I mean I was drawn to her from like the moment I saw her. We was in the chatroom and she was talking to people and her convo was annoying me... I didn't know her or nothing and I started talking about Popeye's Chicken and she jumped on my conversation and started talking to me and it's been kesmit every since!!! I use to say dumb stuff like she had me U.S. Wide open... (It was a pun off the pun that Jamie Foxx had on the espy awards last year to Serena Williams, he did a remix to it this year.) It was mad crazy, I've dreamed dreams... she's dreamed dreams... heard voices, seen things and we've fell out and what not but we really just wanna be friends. For me why? I don't know... For her? She says because she doesn't like losing friends... but i'm special to her and I make her laugh and for that she has love for me.  I'm tired I've worked night shift like all week.. i'm out. more erratic thoughts, more senseless nonesense, and more drama from my life.. stay tune until next time.  Godspeed and remember... every mountain and every hill is gonna come tumblin down. doesn't matter how u feel or negative things that people say.

       You won't try to make me fail at the best thing i've ever had in life!  I wish all my people nuttin but life and that more abundantly so why they can't wish the same for me? It's like my girl Dani said they not thinking with the mindset of God. God's mindset says,  "I know the plans i have for you, to prosper you, for good and not evil."  They on some otha stuff selfishness... making me realize why I gotta back away. "How can darkness have fellowship with light?" IT CAN'T. It's just like after a while of being alone you get frustrated with your circumstances and you want to take them into your hands, and snatch them outta God's. How can he truly be the Lover and Lord of my life If i'm running my life? I'm trying to run away from my responsiblity, the anointing of GOD has a price to pay and honest to goodness, I don't wanna pay that price. I could never do what Jesus done, I could never get up on that cross and die, and I thank God for not asking me too. Even though he didn't ask me to hang on the cross he is asking me to bare my cross. Yeah he said take up your cross and follow me. He never said it would be easy but he said that I could cast my cares on him cus his yoke is easy and his burden is light. I bought a book the other day it's a children's book but it was so cute. It's called a heart for Jesus by Juanita Bynum I tell you it put it into its most simplest form of how to have a heart for Jesus. You allow Jesus into your life and your thoughts become his, your actions become what he would do... "to be like Jesus." When you look at it like that it's kind of mind blowing because you become more likeable... people want to be around you more... they are drawn to you even. The anointing of God comes over you so strong.   Twiddle liddle lit... Tweety  I've never really stopped and thought about why I call her tweety. I think it was because she said something about liking tweety and I was like yeah. I'mma nickname her that, she read my bloggy and she was like, "'Tweety'... huh. That's funny another one of my ex's use to call me that because i'm yellow with a big forehead." So things between us are good... good.. we been playing IM tag... she im's me and I hit her back hours later and then vice versa. Hated it... This two shall pass though, it's like I miss talking to my homie but I know that I won't die if I don't talk to her. Getting to that place is how you know your on the overcoming side of emotional dependency and that's where I want to be! NO DRAMA! inhale-exhale...   Being around lesbians puts things in perspective for me   The Bible says try the spirit by the spirit...  well I lack wisdom on which spirit I'm suppose to try it by, the Holy Spirit or the demon that once was in me to see if thats the same demon on somebody else. LeZBiaNs... love em or hate 'em they are still in my life! I can't escape the homosexual lifestyle but I don't have to be apart of it anymore. The chicks in the lesbian chatroom wild out when they find out my not gay, they don't quite understand why I'd hang around them if I'm not that way anymore. Well the Bible says go into the highways and biways and preach the gospel. I have my own method of preaching the gospel... I give it nice and easy to draw them in and then I put it all out on the table to allow the Holy Spirit to bring forth conviction. I DON'T wanna be a lesbian... I don't know how else to say it... I don't want to be gay! I'm Loud, I'm proud and I'm a not queer! Umm... lets see what else... maybe you wanna get down with the get down, but i wanna stay up, so I gotta man up! So many ways to say it but I'mma take it back home to when I was a young lil scrappa wet behind the ears for knowledge, finding homosexuality the only way I knew how.   "I don't go that way cus I don't flow that way cus I ain't going to hell for the gayness!"   Now that's whats up!  That is how I got down when I was only in the seventh grade, I came up with that one myself. Yeah... that's the joint! I've been drawn to many things and many people I can honestly say although some think that I'm drawn to lesbians... I'm really not. Yeah I've met a few peoples over the last week who are in that way. I know its for a greater purpose though... one of them brought me back to someone who I use to mentor last year. She's starting to understand that God is in this thing because she keeps on crossing my path again.  "Five"  that one is weird... I'm really feeling the idea of a friendship with her... no other words explain it right now... I'm sure she's wondering... matter fact I know she's wondering what is my motives because she was asked me yesterday. I'm saying I'mma let it ride, chill out see what happens. She say she don't believe in the Holy Spirit and she ain't neva been saved she just got baptized when she was 14 and she a lesbian... okay, what! So me being enlightened by the father of heavenly lights.. I want her to peep game on how she's being decieved. She may not accept the seed (that is cool) but i'm going to plant a seed though! I really hope I can give her a word from the Lord. I'll feel cheated if I don't plant a seed, I'm a salesman... I'm selling Jesus. Memba that.   The Cry of a Little Boy by Tracy J. Sipp  How can I accurately bring this one? It's a book that I just finished reading and let me say... MANNNN that joint was something else it takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions through the life of Tracy. My former lifestyle don't have nothing on his! He has lived the soap opera dramatics that you only see on TV. The only difference is that this drama is for homosexuals.   I thought I told ya I was a star!

       All this love, joy and peace I got from Jesus that's what they loving about me.  Their isn't a thing special about me that Jesus didn't create in me.  I learned that lesson earlier this year that it isn't my flawless ways or my sexy gaze that had the girls going wild, it was Jesus.  That lil bit of Jesus in me, everybody is searching for the real thing feel me.  That is the only reason why people do drugs, become alcoholics,  become addicted to sex and etc.  People looking... searching... for ways to abtain godliness or better yet a moment of heavenly bliss on earth.  I ain't gonna lie there is a very euphoric feeling right as you climax during sex and it can become addictive even.  Having sex so much just to have that one little feeling that may only last if your lucky 5 mins.  To have to get all worked up just to hope who ever you are with can give it to you again... multiple times.   MAN... THE ONLY CONSTANT IS CHANGE!  How can I explain this one?  Well my c0-worker left for Korea today... I took it really well... she was truly a god-sent person.  She wasn't no were near saved but God blessed me through her A LOT.  I pray that through her time in Korea she will begin to have a desire to have a heart for God.  I'm changing... I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing yet. I just feel like there is a stranger in this house, i got that whole "ichy neck feel" were things just don't seem right.  I really believe the Lord is talking to me through others and basically through his precious Holy Spirit... what is he saying? "you don't need this... you don't need any of this... all you need is me.  Let go of it all... I care for you... rest in me... let me hold you now... think of me... focus on me... I died and now i'm revived... have faith in me... Trust me... leave them lesbians alone... leave the alcohol alone... leave the men alone... don't let that girl trick you into thinking you need to be with her... don't allow the devil to bring condemnation... you are free and delivered from the hand of the enemy... the anointing comes with a price... you have to pay the price, you have too... or you will die." That sums up my head thoughts... people say I'm crazy and you know what sometimes I wish it was that easy but it isn't.  Juanita Bynum, T.D. Jakes, Joyce Meyers, Paula White, and Darryl L. Foster didn't get where they are just by coasting... they had to pay the price.  Now some people (a lot.. a few... okay enough people) seem to think that I have the "greatness" in me to be the next biggest thing.  They are right and as my counselor and I discussed last week, I'm my worse enemy... I'm stopping myself from reaching my full potential in God.  Some of you are lacking what you need from God (what God wanted me to give you) because i'm slacking in my relationship with him.  It happens a time will come were you just wanna give up... the faith, the ghost, the race, the anointing all of that.  You just wanna be YOU, not the person that God has called you to be but you... the messed up, confused person who is just coasting through life until death does you and this world part.  Well listen that AIN'T GOD, that is the power of suggestion via the devil and his angels(demons).  Now situations come... do you face them do you run?  That is when you put the Word of God on it.   I've been holding out so let me enlighten you...  Tiggy and Tweety...smh. It's a scary thought when you compare your friendship to a married couples relationship.  SCARIER then that is when that friendship hits a place of complacency where it leaves one wanting out.  That is the last thing I need, it's crazy I mean I spent all this time fighting to make  Tweety  and I's friendship work to be like... blah now.  It isn't her fault nor is it mines... it's just that we are changing and our lives are going in different directions (okay mine is).  This week i'm working 12's from 6 at night till 6 in the morning.  Maybe if things were different and I wasn't working the grave yard shift we'd talk more.  It's just that our conversations lately have been non-existant, i mean I tried to go deep see where our heads were at in comparison to how things were going in our lives and well that didn't go the way I planned.  So guess what happens then?  A few hours before I meet "Five" and about thirty mins later I'm on the phone on the conference call with Brit, Toya, Joka, and Ghostface aka Star.  Now come to find out yesterday Toya is this chick who I use to deal with, she was in my group.  She was so confused when it came to God, I mean she had a heart to seek out the knowledge but you know what the Bible says... "The devil wants to sift you out as wheat, but I have prayed for you."  She flipped the script went from fem to stud!  She only 16, Lord bless the child who has its own.  I guess it was better to have one day in his court then none at all?  So Tweety and I haven't talked much since Saturday matter fact she's only spoken to me once.  She said, "Okay Star." now... depending on which thing that I said that she was saying okay to we might have a problemo.  But uh... God got this... the whole world is in his hands... I still gotta be careful what i say to her, she's prego and she's very emotional right now more then usual.  Tiggy  ... Tigger, tigger, tigger... got a thang for the pooh bear!  It is officially offical she said it last night, I dragged the truth right up on out of her.  She didn't want to say it but i'm saying she brought it up, so you know i'm going to ask questions.  An when I got that text message at approx. 12.45 in the morning a sigh of relief came over me.  Cus what has obviously been festering in the darkness has finally came to light.  The devil been suggesting that we should be a we... and now that he has been exposed I can go into battle mode.  It's praying time!  I've been real good about the situation, I haven't gotten upset, acted different, or told shae shae... cus whew I SO WANT TOO! This is like the day that Shae and I have waited for... (a lil immature, sure) but this is like the biggest thing since the atomic bomb, in our lives.  I'mma continue to let her keep her distance from me... demons are catchy like colds.   Singin' sitting in the Harris County jail... wasting all my little time.  I was introduced through a friend, to this guy name Lenny.  I got my first letter today from Lenny.  He's in jail and they trying to give him life, for murder.  Now this is a really big thing for me cus I've never known anyone in his position.  His letter was so clear and whew "mind blowing" brotha been able to spend sometime with the Lord.  Jail does that sometimes... he said in his letter that his brotha's on the inside asked if he was gonna marry me.  I was like whoa... i don't even know him like that you know.  I'm just doing a friend a favor by writing him but I have a feeling that I'm going to learn a thing or two from him.  Maybe I can get a letter with some drawings on it.  You know those jailhouse letters be the best.  That is what kept me when I was in basic training the little drawings that I got.  It's more personal, it takes time.   Put it all together now...   We've got new lesbians in the picture, some carnal knowledge, a friendship that just seems weird and then there's me.        Who am I underneath it all?   Who am I? Who is me?    Without GOD there can't be a me.   That's mind blowing...

       That's how God is understand the whole world's in his hands  man what is really going on in the firmament? I hate it when i'm the last to get the memos on what's going on in my life. I'm befriending a lot of lesbians here right now... and I know that the spirit that causes homosexuality causes all sexual sins and that it's catchy like the common cold. So why am I still hanging around these females? iono... I guess I just really enjoy there company right now, they understand me and I understand them, I don't agree but I don't understand. Grant it all these friendships are basic internet friendships but some have developed to the point where we've talked on the phone, talked about meeting in person, and one i've even met. I've got too much to loose right now to just trade it all for the deathstyle again.   I almost lost my cool because of a foolish person  Nita and I've been cool for almost a year, I knew that the spirit of perversion that was on me was going to try to jump on her. Her best friend is curious too so that didn't help and now she' s curious ready to burn for a taste of the forbidden fruit. ( I think it was grapes and NOT apples) That really had me heated on HOT, and I was just like you know its your life you gotta live it, you gotta make your own mistakes whatever. So grant it she's been there with me through almost everything with Kay and this girl gonna indulge her own self. There's more to this story like she has an adopted daughter, and a fiancee out at sea in the Navy. She's just gonna mess with women for the "sex" of it. It's like pringles baby once you pop you can't stop. So are lucky enough to not get burned but I just don't think she's one of those ppl... sorry. She knows it is sin and there is no sacrifice when you know that it is sin.   "You know you want it, you know you want it..."  Where to begin on this one... Tweety, Five, Britni, Tigger and etc.... humm iono people love me and it's not for me that they love me but the God in me, they don't know that. I do though, tat's why my motto is if it ain't broke, why fix it. Trying to date me is like asking to get your heart broken. I've had a few choice females try to like me or whatever and ended up getting they feelings hurt for various reasons. Now one person actually did succeed at getting me to like them back. She did but how long did that friendship last a week. So if you didn't know NOW you know. I still have some debris to work on, a few lesbian tendencies here and there to overcome. But having them around helps because I can guage where I'm at and know exactly where and what I need to work on next. I've always been a big flirt, that is something that's gonna require a lot of time and thought to change on my part. So pray for me about that one if you can. I don't want nobody assuming i'm switching teams again because it aint that serious. It never will be... It's time to draw nearer to the cross. Focus on Jesus and not on what i'm going through.  I'm feeling like time is passing away just like that, i'm feeling like things have changed just like that. From my ex's (NOW ex) girlfriend telling me she will sue me if i put her in my book, to still no response from the publishers, to my EOC test, to these new lesbian friendships, to the whole hanging around lesbians science period. Gotta be careful the anointing has a price on it, a high one that i'm slacking in.  extra thought to add for myself, my best friend hasn't called me since she got the money. I know how i'm feeling and I know were it's going and I don't wanna go that route, feeling worthless and used. Naw never that. God's got what I want and he has exactly what I need. I NEED HIM.   Thought of the day:   You can run try to hide but the fact you can't deny all creation sings of the artistry of his (G0d) majesty just like 2+2=4 whether you believe or if you don't that's how God is understand the whole world is in his hands .

       First thing first how i'm feeling... shorty sometimes things change, people change and well yeah i'm changing iono if its for the best yet but daily im changing and i hope you can accept it if i back away..      I  t's raining pr's seriously...    umm well it's been a few days since I sat down and really hit the keyboard with my thoughts. I ain't been feeling opening up and what not, but stuff has been going down don't doubt the seriousness of my lifestyle. Last week was really chill, nothing overt everything was on the sly. The devil was there doing what he do and I was doing what I do. It gets to a point where spiritual warfare gets redundit and something has to change about the situation. Add in some otha stuff to the equation... I've done that brought back some minor figures (tigger) and adding in some new figures... "Brit-brit" and "five" both half peurto ricans. It's like it's raining pr's up in here seriously. I still got Tweety and ana mae a major figure who turned less then minor is slightly back. We finally on talking terms again and I'll leave it at that.  How do I really feel about all of this?  The whole world is in God's hands and I'm not trying to be too pretentous or get too close to any of these people. I'm trying to keep my word above everything that I won't open myself up to anyone and that Tweety is the last female that I allow myself to have to deal with on that "level." However, I've come to realize you cannot garauntee a promise you know your heart won't keep. Spirits... homosexuality isn't the exclusion but especially the inclusion. It's catchable like a cold I kid you not. So that's why Paul said, "that darkness hath no fellowship with light." Sometimes I get so high minded that I forget you know very easily that could be me again back in the style. Lesbians ask me all the time why I gave up the style and I never really have an answer I just say there is a lot of reasons and giving one isn't enough.   I don't know how long Brit and Five will be around in my life  but I wanna set a mark for a reminder regardless what happens there. Brit is 17 year old lesbian who has a strong love for the Lord. It's like my job to enlighten her to the truth of God and expose to her that her truth isn't his truth. I'm seeing that my truth isn't his truth eitha so it's time for me to change clothes and renew my mind. Brit is awesome don't get me wrong, our personalities click like beans and rice... we differen't but we taste great together. We work well together and we had a conference call this morning it was like 4 lesbians and me. Can you say interesting? It really was. I really just sat and listened to the conversation and the Holy Spirit brought back to my rememberance something that Dani said. She said that we have different mindsets. A friendship between the two we be a game of "settling and conforming" on my part. I'd have to allow alot of their imperfections go because somethings aren't going to change like cursing, talking about sex, talking about how good a woman looks, and etc. Which wasn't the basis of our whole convo this morning believe it or not but it was in there. Brit and I was on the net in a chatroom wilding out together. She was like "say my name?" and she was talking about she was "biting me on my ankle and back" and she was "putting her finger in my open mouth." I paid her no attention for the most part and I tried to limit how much I appeased her. On top of that she was wilding out and I was like i'm going to tell so and so, the chick she suppose to be talking too. She says she like someone else and not the otha chick so I'm like oh okay well you know cool. We said a few other words and parted for the morning. We was all wilding out in chat like ALL NIGHT AND ALL MORNING LONG and we didn't get off the phone till almost 8 in the morn. She's a sweet girl and she's intrigued by me... i'm not gonna lie i'm drawn to her (like all the others but it ain't no thang.) Like all things only time can tell.   I put this on EVERYTHING when I say that CAN't NO FEMALE  have me out there like Lisa, Kay, and Tweety. I know this to be truth because I've changed since I've met them but I met anotha yesterday who has possiblities of opening up a whole new world to me.  Five  her presence is real fresh from the start, and we clicked almost instantly I got her y! messenger name. She has a lot to offer, I'm saying she brings a lot to the table, and I'm saying she's willing to listen to what I have to say. So I'm saying this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. So I'm saying, what is so special about Peurto Ricans that catch my attention like no other? It isn't all pr's just certain ones, the ones who reflect my personality the most, the ones who reflect my idea of the "inperfect/perfect whatever...." I don't wanna say perfect woman cus that just ain't the case. During the phone conference we had two half pr's on the phone, one was Brit and the only was this chick who was cool but I wasn't paying no mind too. Which has me wondering why was I paying attention to Brit and not the otha? They both half pr, what makes one more special then the other. We weren't vibing... I've met a lot of women, a few of them half pr's and out of all of them only 9 of them had/have me out there wondering what's the attraction why am i so drawn. I'm not attracted to them in a sexual way cus I don't know them like that these newer few but the others I was i mean i dated 3 of them, talked to 2 of them, crushed on 1 of them, was really cool friends with 1 of them and just getting introduced to 2 of them. I'm like discrations will comem that's evident the devil ain't gon let me slide through the cracks. However he can't be everywhere like God, he has his lil demons stepping to me with all this nonsense. I've come to learn a few things and i wanna enlighten someone with it. Take whatever the devil gives you and turn it around for Good so GOD can get ALL the glory!   Tweety and Tigger... Tigger and Tweety   I'll be the first to admit that Tigger has touched a soft spot with me.  As much as I push her away out of my life, I continue to pull her back in. This morning as I tried to go to sleep after I got off the net she said something so profound on a tm.  "You know what I realized that I have love for you for real ain't that something? I don't know i just got this feelin that you really care and it's not a front unlike some ppl that claim they my friends and trust this is a rare thing 4 me."  Yeah... it's all about God's love, turning what the devil meant for bad into Good so that GOD could get the glory! Now that's whats up! She's the only chick that i've cut for who ain't pr... lol. I remember when we first met, she had mad 21 questions. Trying to feel me out and I put this on everything my homie Shae and me use to talk bad about her. Not in the sense that we was talking bad about her, we would be telling the truth and just laughing at it. We have an understanding we care about Tigger and I'll be the first to step up and say I got her back. I know Shae does too, regardless to what we say we don't care we will talk about her in front of her cus it's love like that. I met Tigger in person, so it ain't like this is just some chick I don't know like them rest off bp. We have mutual friends and we've been in the physical presence of each other. I've let her read my journal *the real one and this one*, I've let her meet my parents and my play parents, and I've even had her over for my birthday party.   Real love is like GOD's love.. unfailing and long suffering... etc.  I have that for everybody but it's more evident in some more then others. I'm wilding out cus Tweety and I are STILL friends! We haven't had any issues since May and after those two times we've been good. Letting my darkness be exposed to the light has truly helped us. She's read this journal too... lol. I was nervous about that but she reassured me that it would be okay and it has... it really has. After all we've been through it truly has only made our friendship stronger and it has helped me become more secure as a person. I don't trust people, I don't trust my parents, i don't trust my counselor so what makes YOU think i'm gonna trust her? yeah.. lol. I don't have much to say about her our once fresh, new, hip and exciting friendship has turned into a regular run of the mill association. Association isn't strong enough and she'd be hurt if she read that so I'll say we've settled for complacency in our friendship. We don't talk on the phone anymore, we don't tell the other whats going on in our lives, we don't tell the other how the devil torments us and we don't talk about anything serious and deep like we use too. We've gon from the deeper things in life like talking about spirituality and carnality to talking about prego women's food cravings and why we still awake at 3(her)/5(me) in the morning. but like the gay negro spiritual go... " Iiiiiiahiiiiii I won't complain!" I tried to get us back on that level and she wasn't able to go "deep with me." I need that I need to talk about deep things, i hate wasting my breath on meaningless untrivial banter! Are we still meeting... i'm gonna give it to you the way she gave it to me... "I don't know yet!" and just leave it at that.   Other tidbits of info...  Amy's mom died earlier last week... when I read that i wanted to cry for her. She had already lost her dad and now she's lost her mom. How do you begin to heal from that? How do you bounce back? I sent my condolenscences you know cus she's been on my mind lately and I hadn't seen her around. Now I know why, it just really puts my relationship with my parentals back in perspective I need to seriously get down on my knees and seek out God for perspective for her as well as for me. [R/i/P]  your pain is finally over.       A year of change: the book    My book is umm... with the publishing company.  Within the next few weeks I'll be getting a response from them.. after the two weeks I've had while waiting. I know I NEED that book to be published by this company. I need my testimony to get out their I mean this is so serious. I need that it's gonna help a lot of folxs and a few of them who know me who don't understand me they are gonna get a chance too. My prayer is God's will be done and this is God's will for my life. Whether I like it or feel I'm ready for it. It's gonna give me the closure I need with my ex(S) that i couldn't get any other way. I've talked to most of them about it and they are cool.. lol. Okay 2 are cool.. one is like give me a name that really sticks out and makes me special don't give me no blah name like "Lisa" So I was like aight.. and I came up with, with her help of course... Quimarrah Jones. Pretty huh? I know I know.. L-boogie and star got skills... poppin collas.   Thoughts on my ex's since I've talked to and AT them  Lisa and Tweety are pretty close in their months of pregnancy... it's weird. One night i was talking to both of them and it was getting gross talking about food cravings. One is having a boy and the other is having a girl and the names they chose.. they would be some creative somebodies... such a way with words and syllabuls. L-boogie aka Lisa is ready and waiting to read it. So that makes me feel like so... so naw it makes me feel excited! Tina was umm.. as usual "3C" calm, cool, collected.. lol. Diamond igged me as usual.. lol. The shocker was Kay.. she wasn't trying to here me she didn't want to talk to me and she didn't know what I had to say. I pray that everything works out on her behalf, and since I prolly won't try again to talk to her. I hope when my book does come out I can have one of those cardboard cut outs with my face on it. N one of her friends see it when they go to the mall pick up a copy of the book, well two one for kay and one for them...lol. Yeah, no matter what happens when you love someone you ALWAYS love them. The way you love may change but you never stop loving or you never loved at all. Period.   My Jerry Springer final thought: Everything happens for a reason and I don't understand that but I trust God. I don't get why my best friend called ME friday and asked me for some money to get food. She got parents... and then right now my mom just asked me for some money. Now these ppl don't ask me for much so you would think i wouldn't have a problem with it but I DO. When you ask someone for some money well when u ask me, that's an instant turn off, my money in other ppls hands do not mix. I have no problem giving don't get it twisted but giving is when YOU decide to give of yourself not when someone else decides they screwed up so now they want you to come bail them out. Because this is what this is. I've screwed you u know and i never asked anything from any body. I never asked anybody for money. Now I'm not being harsh about my mom asking for money, i'm being harsh cus she said she'd give me the money back and well I've heard that one before and I still ain't seen the money so just don't say you gonna give it back. My best friend I settled that issue easily I said i'm gonna give it to you as a birthday present because if I don't i'm not gonna like you as a friend anymore. Their was a situation around this time last year were this girl asked me for some money. Being nice and trusting her I gave her more then she asked for. She never paid me back... and that upset me you know cus we was suppose to be like really close friends. Well we fell out because of that and she's like i'll give you your money back now and i'm like now i dont even want it because if you do give it back to me now its only gonna make me more upset. This women who I don't know from adam gonna try to ask me for some money... what i look like? I got bills too you know? I'm trying to save for a car and I can't because i keep on spending the money and now others are asking me for it. if you can't tell i'm agg'd i mean my chest is beginning to burn. I just tell myself it's better to give then to recieve and i take solace in that. God's got the whole world in his hands...      Thought of the day:   2+2=4 just like that God holds the whole world in his hand...
