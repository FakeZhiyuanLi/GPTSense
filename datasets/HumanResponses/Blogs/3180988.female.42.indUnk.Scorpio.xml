      http://hispanicatheistintexasforgodssake.blogspot.com/atom.xml    i just got in..it's about 9pm right now...  there is this asimov humanist group that meets socially..usually for eating out..lunch or dinner...anyway..i didn't have anything to do tonight and wore makeup today..i didn't want to waste it so i decided to go to the dinner meeting..  it was farther from my work than i thought it would be...a good fifteen miles or so...but the traffic wasn't bad...before i took off from work i changed from the skirt i'd worn to the blue jeans i had in the back of my truck.....i was glad i was too lazy to take them in the house after i'd washed them about a WEEK ago....i was wearing pantyhose that rubbed yet ANOTHER rash between my fat thighs..and i did NOT want to wear that uncomfortable ensemble to dinner...i squeezed myself in the back of my blazer struggled to take off my shoes and my pantyhose...skirt...and into my jeans..right there in the parking lot..it was too painfully far to walk back into the building to change..the inside of my thighs were on fire.....but i did  ..i emerged from the back seat and into the parking lot in nice fresh comfortable jeans....ahhhh...  it was hot and humid today..and my ac isn't working..so i was tired and huffing and puffing from the change of clothing exercise and no ac to help..had to power down my windows...  and then i was off..the dinner gathering begins at around 6pm..but i got there around 6:40 or so.. i new i'd be pretty late..but wanted to go anyway..even if it meant just sipping a glass of cold ice tea...i just wanted to chat..meet people..talk...show my face.. be "social" ..instead of coming home..being alone..reading..writing and then..chatting online...  i had a nice time..when i got there..everyone had already eaten..there must have been about nine maybe ten attendees...  some faces i'd seen before at other "munches" ..and a couple of new ones.....  all the seats were taken except one for the chair at the head of the table..so i took it...sitting to my right was valerie..and vickie to my left...  valerie'd remembered me..but not my name..we reintroduced ourselves...and i met vickie...she said she'd seen me before at one other gathering...i didn't remember her ...i don't think we actually met...  at any rate...i mentioned to valerie that i'd gotten off of work late tonight and that i'd just order tea..i was pretty hot and thirsty...but vickie insisted i should order and that she was going to have a dessert..that made me feel better..i hate eating alone and especially when i'm at a table no one else is eating at...  so, i got up..ordered a greek salad and got some rasberry iced tea...mmmm...  when i got back to the table..(it was a "go-to-the-counter-and-order-your-food-and-then-get-your-drink-at-the-fountain" kinda' set up..) valerie asked where i worked..i told her i work near a mall at a call center..for an international insurance company...i mentioned the name...and then vickie says i work there too! and i was nooooooo..really???? and she said yes! and i did a double take at her and realized that i'm the one who helped her find the snack bar at the building across the parking lot  at work a couple weeks ago! ..and that we chatted and i found that she was new to the company...i noticed..and never forgot the humongous burrito she ordered...  i mentioned this to her and then she realized that she'd seen me BEFORE she met me at work at one of the humanist "dinner's out"! and couldn't quite place me the day i helped her find the snack bar....but that yes! she remembered when i helped her find that snack bar...  so i  was so ecstatic about meeting and WORKING with an atheist/humanist like me! i just wanted to hug her i was so happy that among all the praisin' jesus's, and the bibles on desks, and the "i'll pray for you's" there was someone at work ..just like me! i went on about "ohhh..kindred spirits!" .."at work!! someone like meeee! .."i'm so happy to meet youuuuuu" i was really happy...i mean..i was gushing...thinking that i was NOT alone after all...at work i mean.......  then she said..well...i'm not an atheist....and i said ...i c...a humanist then? she said nooo..i do have religion...and well at that point i said how i was just jumping to conclusions and making assumptions..i was apologetic..i asked a christian? she said..i'm a wiccan... i'm a witch....  of course..i think  that is just as silly as a christian or any other kind of theist..but i had to appear as though i was very agreeable and accepting of that..and i put on this phony uncontrollable shit eatin' grin..i'd put my big fat foot in my mouth..and every time i opened my lips to speak...heel, arch, and more toes were exposed...sticking out from between my lips..and i couldn't stop..i couldn't help it...and it was so obvious that i was trying to walk backwards..take back my reaction...embarrassed that i might have offended her..with my silly jumping to conclusions..and i though to myself...hey..she can't be all that bad..at least she's not a CHRISTIAN and she's HERRRE..and she's obviously tolerant of atheists and humanists ..etc...so i still felt happy...kinda' like i'd met a secret and mutual conspirator..  she kinda' chuckled when she saw that was embarrassed and confused and tried to make up for making my assumptions about her......i said something like "oh i see..well at least your not a christian..after all that i go throught at work! i have no probs with you being a wiccan...i'm sorry i jumped to a conclusion" and had the look of a person who says "how interestingggg" with a big smile but really i must have looked as though i was thinking...what a WAckO...  i'm still so embarrassed when i think about how silly i must have looked..she did say..i was raised by atheists..my entire family..my parents were atheist.....she said that she enjoyed hanging out with humanist and atheist..i think she was trying to make me feel better...and it worked...sorta'..i'm such an idiot..    so, i met a witch tonight..she's a "wiccan" ..okieee dokieee....  and i met her for the 2nd FIRST time...   ultimately..we had a very nice conversation..she's very sweet..and valerie..is soo hilarious..great sense of humor that woman has...  valerie asked me if i had a degree at one point..she was interested in my background..who i was ..i'm still new and i s'pose a bit of a mystery still...and i told her that i didn't..have a degree that is..i matter of factly said that i  was just a normal..non degree holding "joe"...who also was an atheist.. she was curious how i'd managed to conclude atheism..i explained that it just..inately absurd to me..the notion that a ghost in the clouds dwells and directs every thing and every one..and that a few years ago i'd met justin...who opened my eyes... and how i like reading...and how i never really believed in real gods dwelling in the sky...and how even my young..i'd always had a kind of sub concious belief in the theories of evolution and big bang..i've never thought that a real god made woman from the rib of man etc..and how i believed that those myths are based on ignorance..and the early attempt ..of early man..who had no scientific method yet..to understand his natural world..and well, now we know why it rains..and it's not because god is crying..  i explained that on my father's side there are catholics and my mother...resented catholism shoved down her throat as a girl and really just let her kids find their own ways...my mom was NEVER religious..ever..though..she , like i did, like everyone conditioned the same way, believed in a god in the sky..in jesus ..etc..  as a kid...if the baptist church school bus drove into the projects? we got on to go...not that i or any of my syblings were particularly religious..i think  it was more an adventure...it was getting out of the house...and doing something new on sunday...  all told..i had a nice time tonight.. at the humanist dinner meeting...valerie and vickie were nice and kind..and seemed to accept me..and well, i was a little more comfortable about myself..i think it was the make up..it made me feel less self concious about my lack of education...if i look good..i can feel good..and i can feel more confident.. i don't know... i feel so embarrased lots of time concerning that fact that i'm 42 with very little education..no degree..i would have loved it...education...a degree....but i kept myself from educational success and so i suffer the consequences now..  :0/

      I'm Mexican American.  I'm a Texan (born and raised) and I'm an atheist for God's sake! I always feel uncomfortable about capitalizing the word "god". But really I suppose it's O.K.. I'd capitalize "Tinkerbell".  *shrug*  I've been an athiest for about four years....or so.  I say "or so"  mostly because I've not been able to determine the exact precise point in space/time in which I accepted and ackowledged that I simply lacked the belief a spirit or ghost floating around in the sky called God existed.  I think though, it all started when I met a young man,Justin, about nine years my junior, at work.  He, one day , proclaimed he was an atheist after I'd suggested he "pray" about "it". Something I can't even remember was troubling him.  The thing about me suggesting he "pray", frankly , was just a means that I used to try to flirt and show concern.  I had an enormously passionate crush on this young man. I've never EVER been any kind of a fanatic or religious zealot.  Nor have I ever really thought about "god" as intensely as some do.  Back to Justin, he very matter-of-factly said he was an atheist. And really? I just , felt , respect.  And I also felt that I was not far behind.  That I too was probably an atheist but was never self aware enough, or brave enough, or thoughtful enough to say so.  Or really, even to believe so.    I just went with the conditioning flow I and the rest of American society flows with.  I accepted was what given to me.  "Oh praise Jesus! He can be  your savior! He can help you in your hardships".  Line hook and sinker.  I'd never had a real problem with it all until I met Justin. And he got me to thinking.  I saw him as "normal",as a "regular" kinda' guy.  Not some blood sucking wild eyed ATHEIST with horns growing from his skull.     I'm sleepy.  It's late.  And yes! Atheists need sleep like every one else!   More later...
