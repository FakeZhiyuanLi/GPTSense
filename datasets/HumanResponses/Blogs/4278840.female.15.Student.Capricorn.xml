      How lovely it is to live To live a life of sadness To live a life of eternal darkness  How lovely it is to see To see the man I love To see his girlfriends with him To see him making out  How lovely it is to think To think about him To think about the truth To think about never having a chance  How lovely it is to know To know the truth To know the fact To know he'll never be mine

      Can your heart make mistakes? I feel like it can I'm in love with someone who doesn't love me  Can love make a mistake? I have a feeling it can I want to let go but it won't let me  Can the present make a mistake? Of course it can It's making a big mistake right now

      I'm in a trance when I see you When I'm near you I can't seem to think straight  I'm in deep though When you come 'round I can't seem to clear my thoughts of you  I'm in a dream When you call my name How can you make me like this with such a simple word  I'm in a different place When we're together My world seems a lot brighter when your around Like no troubles can bring you down  All I know is that I'm different round you I have a smile on my face Life in my eyes A hope that the day will get better

      I always wish to have you here I wish to hold you and feel your lips on mine If I could have one wish granted It would be to feel your lips just once  When I dream I dream of being with you Feeling you touch Hearing these words  I'm a destined To only have my wishes granted in my dreams What did I do to deserve this fate? I wish I knew  I wish youwere here right now To comfort me To allow me to relax All I have to say is that I have only on wish And that is to feel your lips on mine

      Why can't I tell you? Why can't I just say those words? How can I let you slip?  Never have I not though of you Never have I not wished for you Never will I long for you so much  I want to feel you touch I want to feel the lingering sensation of your lips I want to have you  But why can't I find my voice? And why can't I just tell you how I feel? This is the only thing wish for The only thing at all

      Here she goes again Ranting no about her boyfriend Like I don't have other worries  She worries to much and she also came to close To closes to losing her purity This is what I get for being friends with her  She's hoping to be in the same classes as him I hope I'm not I hate that guy now Nothing left for me to say but I hate him

      Well mama told me When I was young Said sit beside And listen closely To what I say  Oh take your time Trouble will come And they will past You'll find the man And you'll find love  But I bet she never betide on this I feel in love And there's troubles on my plate  I would love to do as she said but nothing works ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The first 2 paragraphs are from "simple man" by Shinedown. Hence not mine

      I know i'm a girl but I can't help but hate them They walk around in their slutty clothes The flaunt their bodies because they can  Then there is the few girl The girls that cover up They get picked on I find that's no fair  Then theres the guys The guy go for all the skinny girls The girls that show the most boob showing They stare clear from the decnet ones  That is why i hate the "popular" girls

        There is a rosebud in every child  The rosebud means puraty of soul  When we grow the rose blums  Depending on how pure you are  Depends on the color of your rose   The white rose the purest The red rose the passion  The blue rose the sadest  And the black rose the worst   Which on are you  Pure or passionate  Sad or bad  The rose will always blossom  No matter what you are

      Slippery, slid-dy Is how I describe it Falling, tumbling on the black ice Lake freeze solid Streams that rush Stay the same Can't see it on ash-felt But feel yourself glide Many people fall Many people die When ice is thin You fall through Into the icy water below Very rarely survive

      When you know someone who is right for you Who would never turns away Who would stay with you trough thick and thin A true friend they are indeed  For few this is hard to find They always turn away For the other few who's decision Will never sway For that is a true friend  For i have found that someone but not in a girl But in a boy, Jeramie is his name For he is my twin soul And for i Never have to search again

      soul gives life Yet a life is taken people who live their life well are not afraid of death people who lose their way try to find it again  Souls can grow the more hope you have your soul can't survive without hope you may live forever with hope  During your life you spirit grows if your hopes are high your soul won't be lowyou live your life well no worries will pass you plate life is suppose to be funand not a war  Be proud you were born a human It's most precious gift you can be given

      Where are you when I'm sad Where are you when I need to talk to some one Where are you when I call  You always say with my parents Or out with my brother But what can I believe anymore  Where will you be when you know you love me Where will I be when I'm laughing at you One day you'll know what I went through  One day you'll love me like I love you One day you'll need me like I need you Someday you'll want me like I want you But when those days come around it might be to late I might not feel for you
