       Livejournal sucks bigtime. Why pay for a service that is unstable? *sighs*

       We're off on a Cruise tomorrow! It's a  urlLink Viking Line  cruise on their  big  ship called Cinderella :o)  I've been using my  urlLink livejournal  more; I like the friends page feature and hope someday blogger has a similar thing. I may just end up using this thing more and more in the future as I grow out of livejournal, as my  urlLink hubby  has. ;o)  Guten Nacht! Godnatt! Good Night!

             Denn du bist was du isst und ihr wisst was es ist  Es ist mein Teil –  nein  Mein Teil –  nein  Denn das ist mein Teil –  nein  Mein Teil –  nein   Ist doch so gut gewürzt und so schön flambiert und so liebevoll auf Porzellan serviert Dazu ein guter Wein und zarter Kerzenschein Ja da lass ich mir Zeit Etwas Kultur muss sein

       Well, a good thing about On/Off is that when my X-box is in for repair, I have the chance to get a temporary one to use while I wait. :o) That's nice! We got a Stockholm number to call for tracking our X-box.  One game I need to get is  The Chronicles Of Riddick - Escape From Butcher Bay . I also want one of the Tony Hawke games. My fave game so far is Project Gotham City Racing 2. I  love  fast cars! I want to also get Need For Speed Underground... I have another one in that series called Hot Persuit. It's O.K. :oP   current music:  Rammstein ~ Asche Zu Asche

I can't wait until Fall and Winter arrive! :o)  My brother in law, Andreas, has a  urlLink blog . Congrats on your new dvd burner... hope you have as much fun as your brother Magnus does! :o)  I    current music:   Rammstein ~ Mein Teil

        Hi , everyone!  Well, this is quite a change from my  urlLink livejournal  :o) But I figured since my hubby got himself a blog (due to his little brother having one) I figured I'd get one, too.  Today is our 5th wedding anniversary - and we went to McDonald's. He had a QP Burger Combo, and I had a McFlurry (yes, bad me, since I'm not allowed to eat these whilst on Atkins) w/Daim and Caramel in it. But since I am around 8,000 steps after hiking 2 hours with a girlfriend and our dogs around half of Dalälven in this 28*C weather, I figured I deserved a nice cold ice cream. :oP""   Happy Anniversary, Sweetie!     That's all for now... ttyl!
