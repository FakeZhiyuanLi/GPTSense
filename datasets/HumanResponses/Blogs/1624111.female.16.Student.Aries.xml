      Im watching pleasantville. (with subtitles so i dont miss a quote) good movie. possibly my favorite movie. which would mean it beats monty python which i guess used to be my favorite movie...its still funny and all, but it doesnt have much meaning. gotta love pleasantville for meaning. its got all the things i love in a movie...an excellent score, nice cinematography, a good script (very important), decent actors (i liked toby before he was in spiderman...and reese is okay, she has some good lines...nice deliverly. and then theres whilliam h macy whos great...and oh, i think paul walker...who gets points for hotness...hate him in fast & the furious though. jeff daniels is pretty good. and the wife, dont know her name, joan allen? but shes a nice actress.) and meaning. so many movies lack meaning. its sad. all the teen movies lack meaning...but i see them anyway. sad, i know. so, anyway, im watching pleasantville and im writing one of these cause i do enjoy rambling, i enjoy it ever so much. so i decided since its such an awesome movie and it has a pretty good script id make a list of quotes i like...possibly explain them, explain why i like them, how they relate to me... all that. (all that. i keep saying that. crazy.) here goes:  okay, there are lots of good lines, but here are the absolute best ones and i am too tired to explain them, plus whoever looks at this is probably my friend and therefore not a moron, so just read the quotes:  Betty: "I told you george, im not going to that meeting." George: "Sure you are." Betty: "No, im not. Look at me george, look at my face, that meeting's not for me." George: "You'll put on some makeup." Betty: "I don't want to put on some makeup."  George: "It goes away. It'll go away." Betty: "I don't want it to go away."  George: "Now you listen to me. You're coming to this meeting. Youre going to put on some makeup. Youre going to be home at 6:00 every night and youre going to have dinner ready on this table." Betty: "No, I'm not sweetie."   George: "What happened? One minute everythings fine. The next... what went wrong?" Bud: "Nothing went wrong, people change." George: "People change?" Bud: "Yeah, people change." George: "Can they change back?" Bud: "I dont know. I think its harder ...You okay?" George: "It's, it's not fair you know, you get used to one thing--" Bud: "I know, it's not."   Bud: "You dont have a right to do this. I mean, I know you want it to stay pleasant around here but  there are so many things that are so much better. Like silly or sexy or dangerous or brief. And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them."      David: "What's wrong?" David's Mom: "I dunno, everything's just so f***** up. I got halfway down there and thought, 'What am I doing? He's 9 years younger than I am.' Doesn't make me feel younger. Makes me feel older. When your father was here,  I used to think this was it. This was the way it was always going to be. I had the right house, the right car, the right life--" David: "There is no right house, there is no right car ." David's Mom: "God, my face must be a mess." David: "It looks great." David's Mom: "Honey, thats really sweet of you but im sure it does not look great." David: "Sure it does. Come here"  David's Mom: "  Im fourty years old. Its not supposed to be like this." David: "Its not supposed to be anything . Hold still"  David's Mom:  " How'd you get so smart all of a sudden?" David: "I had a good day ."

      Im pretty bored and i've never had a little "sub-journal" thing before, so what the hell? I'm kinda mad at myself right now cause i was gonna look up something on el internet and i dont remember what it was. i hate it when somethings right on the tip of your brain but you cant think of it....hate that feeling. Anyway, im entertaining myself with this while my brother Alex has his birthday party. Theyre in his room right now. Its pretty dangerous to be outside of my own room...theyre all hyper and boyish and they already shot me with a nerf gun, so im avoiding them until they leave to go see thier stupid movie. Hulk or something. big deal to them. Why do men like movies like that? Some big muscley guy that gets angry and smashes things...i know i sure wish i could turn into one of those. if only I had been hit by gama rays! Oh... but, seriously, the hulk is one superhero i just dont understand. First of all, what kind of superpowers are these: jumping, greeness, bigness, strongness, anger? oooh, thatll keep those criminals at bay. And arent superheros supposed to be all noble and courageous and righteous? sorry, i just dont find anything all that admirable about some guy who gets angry and strong and makes things go smash....ooooh, noble. People like Atticus Finch are 5000 times better heros. Finchy made the list of top 100 heros of the movies too...guess which place he got! #1! cool, eh? Not that he's exactly a SUPERhero...but hes sort of the quintessencial good guy, almost superhuman in his morality or something. i dunno, maybe im just crazy. probably am. ive been told that many many times. So anyway, whats nwe with me? um...i just got back from Tucson AZ on vacation...emily came with me. we had fun. saw some movies, spilled some water, splashed some water, drank some water, (there was lots of water), saw the fires, played some truth or dare, had a fun and exciting day, played some 20 questions...fun stuff. we learned some great lessons from the wise Malfron...good old malfron. i miss him. um, what else? Im almost done with Catcher in the Rye but i havent been taking notes so ill have to reread it. poor holden...so lonely. Thats one of the reasons im so lucky. I dont feel terribly alone and misunderstood like a lot of teenagers. I got some good friends that keep me pretty sane. :-D. I'm really very lucky. I mean, i dont win the lottery and all that crap, but im lucky. I've got a loving family and everyone i love is pretty healthy, and ive got great friends, as previously mentioned, and i go to a great school, and i have a roof over my head and i live in a nice neighborhood and im not facing a lot of pressure at school to do drugs or have sex or any of that, i dunno, lifes good. Even if i do get bored a lot. Im very lucky. i try to be grateful for that. and im not saying all this so i can brag about how much better my life is than yours or anything, cause being so lucky kinda bothers me in a way. Ive never really believed there is such a thing as luck because...everything happens for a reason right? people get what they deserve in the end. God. all that. and if i get all this already, well, i havent been any saint or anything, so why? what do i have to do to be worthy of all this? gotta live a worthwhile life and do something great. thats scares me... i mean, what makes me more deserving of all this...this "luck" than some poor, starving kid in india? Why do i get it and he doesnt? I dont think im a better person than he is. So i guess i feel like i gotta do something extrordinary to perhaps make myself more deserving. scary though, scary. makes me hope life is fair. i figure the leats i can do is live my life trying to make it fair...not just for myself either. for those of us who deserve that night on that hill, and everyone else. Um, anyway, that got a little deep, didnt it? well, i only got like 120 spaces left, so i guess ill end this now. Maybe this would've been better as a nitwit. oh well. bye all. never stop thinking. Mood: "thinking....always." Music: "Seven Nation Army" & "Hardest Button to Button" & "Love of my life" (damn you emily, you have way too much influence on me)  there you go, theres my sub-journal i wrote earlier today.

      Okay, ive never done this before, so...yeah. ive heard about these blog things before and im pretty bored so i decided to try one out. tell me what you think. tell me if you want info on how to get one or something. basically, if you have any thoughts while reading this, tell me. I figured i could have fun with this over the summer...like a little piece of my mind for everyone to read if they get that bored. Okay, so, i just wrote a subjournal on my profile (which is starting to bore me, anyway) and i didnt like it cause it was mean and only let me ramble for 3000 characters (which goes quickly if youre me) and i didnt like it too much, so this is my frist "blog" or whatever. (why is it even called a blog? what a funny name...maybe its a combo word...like smog...something that starts in bl and somethign that ends in og...thing about it. or maybe just something that starts with b and the word log...cause this certainly is logish.) and after i finish this introductiony thing, ill copy my subjournal into one instead and put a link on my profile. enjoy.

      as some of you may notice, theres now a "links" section...which i created by screwing with the html...ill add more links later. and ill see if i can get a space between the last archives month and the word "links"...im working on it, dotn worry. and theres also a counter at the bottom that provides me with many useful statistics. i just hope it doesnt get above 1500 or 15000 or something cause then it deletes my acount because im using too much bandwidth or something...but i doubt that many people actually read this. besides, i dont need the counter...and i could always get a new one. anyway, just thought id update everyone so that i dont have to yell at you for not noticing my changes.

      What is reality? I talked a little in my world entry about what is real…but I didn’t fully explain my concept of reality. I don’t really have the generally accepted definition of reality. I mean, its not that I don’t understand when someone talks about reality as being everything you can see and touch, because I understand that that is what a lot of people define as reality. But that’s not really what I think is real. My real is not textbook real. My real is not “1. a. being or occurring in fact or actuality; having verifiable existence: real objects; a real illness. b. true and actual; not imaginary, alleged or ideal: real people, not ghosts; a film based on real life.” And I could go on with the dictionary definition, but I think that’s enough to prove that my real is not the conventional real. My real is...having substance ...mattering...  having depth....existing beyond existence (ooh, i like that one)... reality is not what you can touch and feel and mathematically prove to take up space in the universe. reality is what is true when 2+2 does not equal 4 and its what you can feel and see when you close your eyes and touch nothing. It is far beyond the physical. it is the things that would still be if the physical world exploded into a million pieces and disintegrated tomorrow morning. in this way, reality (at least my definition) is contradictory, because it is not what is touchable and provable. it is not what has verifiable existence as an actual object. it is your ideas, your emotions, your understandings, your bonds, your beliefs, your...feelings. its what would still be true if all life was an illusion...its not the pencil on your desk...its all the things that exist only in the mind and only in the heart. i mean, i was thinking about this once when i was walking home from summer school last year...like...what if all those crazy people are right and life is really like the matrix or something and we live in some sort of fantasy world but really were in boxes somewhere with wires attached to our brains and bodies and some alien race or something is living off our body heat? well, thats crazy, for one, but...i was thinking about...and i was asking myself what is real...beyond everything what is real? The only thing I could come up with was my feelings. My feelings are real. How I feel about something is real, whether the thing itself is real or not. (not that the worlds not real…just…hypothetically) And so when I talk about things as being real I don’t mean…like…this keyboard is real…well, yeah, it’s real. But it is not a part of me that I can feel when im alone in darkness away from everything physical that ever existed. Those are the things that are real. People are real. A lot of times another person is the most real thing you know. And I think some people can be more real to you than others. Not that the other ones are fake or something, the just aren’t as…aren’t as real to you. Or something. And I cant really explain what I mean when I say someone can be “more real to you” than someone else. But I think its true. Because there are people who you can feel when you close your eyes and then there are the people you don’t feel…not that they aren’t real, because they are…but not to you. Yeah, so anyway, I just felt like explaining my real and a little bit about how some people can be more real than others. I explained that a long time ago on my profile…although I don’t know if I did a good job. It was before fencing one day…it was probably rushed. Maybe ill write some more on the concept of “real people” vs. “non-real people” but the point of this was to explain what I meant when I said “real.” Hope this makes sense. -adapted from an emily email

      As i last informed you, im crazy. and ive created a new blog to show you my crazyness in an entirely new way. This blog i use more for like...real thoughts i feel like sharing with the world. however, my new blog, which i share and co-operate with my fellow mild-mannered reporter turned valiant righter of wrongs, kailey, will offer more of a comedic view of things and more than the occasional odd rant on...whatever strikes us. Hopefully this will be entertaining.If anything, its something to do with my boring summer days. This blog i think will be more of us just talking and being weird and funny, as opposed to this one which is strictly an outlet for my ideas...this is like a big log of speeches i would have made from a soapbox on a corner with no one listening to me. not that theres anyone listening now, but anyway.... so check out my new blog.  ill still be updating this one too, its just...a different part of me for you to laugh at and shake your head at and say "well, at least im not that pathetic...." anyway, since there are no links on this blog and i dont want to change the template because i like this style better than the rest of them (save jellyfish...but thats what i use on my other blog...and they cant both be the same, thats maddness!) i'll just have to tell you the site:   Visit  urlLink "Sombrero de *fashon*"  (pronounced "fah-shone")

      Im crazy. Honestly. This isn’t something new though, ive always been crazy. Well, maybe not always. But…at least since junior high. Im not exactly sure what caused it. Probably a combination of the two things that have the biggest influence on what I think and believe...and that would be my friends and my books. Yes, books. Its probably a bad thing, but I tend to put a lot of credence in what I read. I try to only read good books, though. I mean, when I have a choice. So anyway, im crazy, right? And im not crazy in that psycho-lives-in-a-shack-in-the-woods-wants-to-kill-everyone kind of way. Im more crazy in a way where im too idealistic and too dependant and too…I don’t know. All I know is, I don’t even live in this world. I live in a word made of select pieces of this one. I live in a world where anything is possible if you try hard enough. Anything. I mean, not things like “I want to build a skyscraper so high it reaches the moon” because that’s impossible. But things like keeping a friend for your entire life. Things like changing the world. Real things. You could say a skyscraper is more real than a friendship, but its not. Really, its not. Its much much much less real. A building does not comfort you, a building does not make you laugh, a building does not make you feel like you make a difference, a skyscraper is a solid structure built so people could have more space to work. sure, you can touch it, it exists in space and time, but it does not touch you. When you close your eyes it disappears, when you lie in bed alone at night, you cannot feel it. This is what it is like to be real. A friendship is real. My world is made of realities and unrealities as well, as they are necessary. But anything is possible in my world. And nothing ever changes without your permission. And no one ever has anything better to do on Friday night than sleepover with you and stay up till 3 am…or better yet, never sleep at all. And it doesn’t matter that you don’t have anything to talk about. All that matters is that its worth it to you to deny your body rest in favor of something much more valuable…time with the people you love. Because although your body might hold a grudge for a few days, your peace of mind will thank you. And its always worth taking a break from your homework to send a few emails. And its never dangerous or foolish to stand out in a thunderstorm and get soaking wet and just have fun. And you always keep talking even if you only get one word answers, because even if no ones listening, at least youre trying, and at least you care enough to try, and as long as you still care, its still worth it. And in my world life is fair. Bad things don’t happen to good people. As long as you always try to be the best person you can be, try to make the right choices, try to do whats right, and make a difference in a few peoples’ lives, then you’ve lived a worthwhile life and you deserve whatever it is you want. And no one in my world ever wants something stupid…like 103 million dollars…all anyone ever wants is to love and be loved. And theres no Stevenson, no society, no…world to ever get in the way and make it hard for something to exist that was never anything but beneficial to the growth and happiness of the citizens of my world. And no ones ever without someone else they can always talk to, without someone else who can understand them without any explanation. And you can read minds in my world. It isn’t even that hard. And everyone understands whats really important to you, and whats really important in life, and you don’t have to do the things that are pointless and stupid. And when you don’t want people to ask you whats wrong, they don’t. and you can cry if you wan to, and no one will think youre depressed and no one will try to get you to explain if you don’t want to. And in my world, you never lose that glint of excitement in your eyes that tells whoever bothers to look that youre infatuated to the core. And youre always missed when you go on vacation. And there are always lots of emails waiting for you when you come back. And one will always say “youre coming home tomorrow!” and you always have a note to read on the airplane because that’s when you start to realize its going to be lonely. And if all you want to do is dream, then you can dream, and no one will tell you its stupid. And you can be idealistic, and you never have to worry about facing the real world, and the fact that people arent always nice, and things don’t always work out the way you want them to. And you are always loved and you can always close your eyes and smile because you know, deep down, that you matter to someone. And its of no importance how far away this person is, or how long its been since you saw them, or anything. Because you still matter to them, and they still love you because its impossible for them not to. But in my world we don’t believe in possibles and impossibles. There is only what matters and what doesn’t matter. All things that matter and that are deeply important are possible. And in my world, “Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7) and if you wish to do something out of love, it will always be possible.   	I could go on, but I think ive talked enough about my world. Maybe ill tell you some more about it later. it’s a wonderful place, its really quite a shame it isn’t entirely real. But who would want things this way anyway? I must be crazy, huh?

      okay, i dont really want to quote this cause emily already did, so i feel like im stealing...and i sort of am, but too bad. this will always be here, and eventually shell have to change her profile, so...ha. I read The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros. it was okay. this is my favorite passage and i felt like putting it somewhere, so here:  "And you could laugh, Sally. You could go to sleep and wake up and never have to think who likes and doesn't like you. You could close your eyes and you wouldn't have to worry what people said because you never belonged here anyway and nobody could make you sad and nobody would think you're strange because you like to dream and dream. And no one could yell at you if they saw you out in the dark leaning against a car, leaning against somebody without someone thinking you are bad, without somebody saying it is wrong, without the whole world waiting for you to make a mistake when all you wanted, all you wanted, Sally, was to love and to love and to love and to love, and no one could call that crazy."

      have you ever been seeing a movie and you remember, for a second, that youre sitting in a theater surrounded my lots of other people and not in the story istelf, and you look over at your friend next to you who's paying attention to the movie...or at least is looking at the screen, because you know from expierience that this friend doesnt always concentrate on the movie shes watching, and you just look at this other person and you think how amazing it is that this person is not just a part of your life... a part of the story unraveling before your eyes...but has her own eyes...and is a complete and separate being...and what would it be like to witness things through someone else? what would it be like to think her thoughts? everything youve ever known youve known the way you experienced it...and heres this other person who isnt you...and you sit there for a minute in awe of the complexity of every single human being and amount of work and compassion it takes to fully understand just one person and you wonder what shes thinking...whether shes following the movie or not...and you ask her "what are you thinking?" and she doesnt answer you, and you dont exactly know why...but you want to know...so you keep looking at her for a minute...and you poke her in the arm several times and then get this bright idea to keep poking her until she tells you...and so you keep poking her for a good ten or 15 minutes until the movies over and then you feel bad cause you just annoyed her and it was kind of pointless and you dont really want to annoy her and wonder why you do stupid things like that and you just end up calling yourself a crazy idiot? yeah, me too.

      I was watching pirates of the caribbean yesterday (and wednesday…) and i was thinking...caues id already see it once, so i wasnt paying too much attention to the movie. and have you ever noticed how none of the main characters in any movies ever have any friends? like in pirates...elizabeth has no friends....will has no friends...i guess jack has some friends... but name any other movie...in a lot movies the main characters have no friends...like, take...aladdin (first movie that came to my mind)...aladdin, does he have any friends? nope. abu maybe (the monkey...however you spell his name)...but hes not a person...and the geenie...but hes also not a real person. and then jasmine has no friends... its very sad. the characters were supposed to be rooting for...the characters were identifying with or whatever...they never have any friends and i think if they had some friends...maybe they wouldnt have so many problems. thats my solution to a lot of problems "he/she needs better friends" (i have been told not so say that, though) seems to me a good friend could solve a lot of problems. but then again theyre just movies and the point is to make money right? sigh...

      I hate this thing.  the last four times...count them...FOUR...ive tried to post something it has killed it...one way or another. and ive rewritten than thing on love three times now and ill have to write it a fourth if i want a good version published...unfortunatly...this may take a while because im am VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY pissed off at the moment because i had it just the way i wanted it and i go to publsih it and the internet decides to stop working so guess what. i lose the entire thing. yep. all my work. gone. it didnt save it. at all. didnt even email it to me like its supposed to. its like writing a whole essay for school and then having word die and having not saved it (except there is no way for me to save...so its not my fault) and then rewriting it badly but turning it in anyway and then having your teacher tell you it sucks so write it again and maybe shell grade that one instead so then you do except word kills it again. and now youre really pissed off. except this isnt for a grade. i do this because i like it...its something i acutally care about. which makes it even worse that im going to have to rewrite it AGAIN. im so angry right now i could...do...irrational things. gimme that butterfly or whatever the hell it was and ill rip its wings off...want to go to florida? seriously, im very angry. if there was a person responsible for each failure to publish my text i would punch them in the face right now. im not kidding. i cant even punch that well, but id do it all the same. this site owes me my time and my work and i want it back. this is not fair. i hate this thing.

      okay, i dont want to give a lengthy tirade...or harangue...whichever it turns out to be...on what love is because im no expert and i dont want to pretend to be. i know what i know and thats all. i dont even know if ill tell you exactly what it is i know...but i can tell you what i think something should be like, or needs to be...of course, thats not fact. im telling you this and telling myself this because i dont want to make an ass of myself now and look back in 10 years  actually  knowing these things and think "why did i think i knew everything?" because i dont. that said, heres what im going to preach about:      we were doing this...um...activity in confirmation once. I dont remember what it was called "Circle of..." something. What it was was all these circles laid out with a tiny one that said (me) in the center (it was like a dart board or something) and we were supposed to put our friends in the circles. our friends, our parents, our neighbors, basically anybody we knew. and the circles (there must have been like…7) went in order…like…the circle closest to the (me) was for the people you knew the best. and then you put arrows on the people you wanted to “move” and youd point the arrow to the circle you wanted them to be in. and eventually we had to put God in one of our circles. the point of this whole activitiy was for all of us to go “wow, God is only in circle 6.” and to draw a little arrow from Him pointing to the inner circle. something like that. but the thing I remember about this stupid confirmation thing was what my teacher said. now I never really liked this woman all that much or thought she was incredibly intelligent, but for some reason I haven’t forgotten something she said. she was talking about that inner circle…the one closest to you. and she said that in your entire life…you only really get a few people who ever truly belong in that inner circle. I think she said two or three. and she wasn’t saying this to scold us for putting too many people in our closest circles…she was just kind of saying it reflectively. like…if at the end of your life you look back and do this exercise, youd only have a handful of people who really belong in that circle. well, that inst exactly what she said, but that’s an explanation. and im not exactly sure why I remember that… i guess it just got me thinking. and that was a long time ago, so ive been thinking for quite a while. I was just thinking that those are the people that you really truly love…the people in your closest circle. not that you don’t love other people…and not that it isn’t real…but, there’s like “I love you, youre a great person, im gald I know you” and then theres like “I love you, I cant live without you” and theres a difference. Like monica said, "to love someone, you have to know them. And I don’t mean you have to know what kind of food they like, or what their favorite song is. You have to understand them; deeper than any preference, you have to know...their soul" and I don’t think you can do that with just anyone. i think the people that you really really love are the people who mean everything to you...those few people. like your husband or your wife or your closest friends. like...i was thinking about souls a while ago... there are the people who youre like "yeah, im pretty sure they have a soul..." but you dont really know them all that well. (not that anybody doesnt have a soul, but...) and then there are the people who youre like "i know they have a soul." and you just know it. but then there are the people who...whos souls youve...known. whos souls youve...felt. people who...even if you doubted the basic goodness of humanity you could say "this person has a soul." and...i dunno. you can just...look in their eyes and feel it. that reminds me of this bible passage..."...the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of david, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul." (1 Samuel 18:1) i think thats real love (friendshipwise, at least). to actually have your soul be "knit" with the soul of another. i think you have to have an incredibly deep understanding of another person to have something like that. and i think you only really get to know a few people that well in your entire lifetime. I think there are very few people you ever truly fully understand. what was it dickens said? "every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other" (Tale of Two Cities, chapter 3, my page 21) yeah...so i think you only really ever know a few people so well as to know...their souls. And those are the people in your “inner circle” of relationships. Those are the people who change your life…those are the people you really love. the people you understand beyond any knowledge of likes and dislikes…the people you care about more than anything. And I guess…my point is…well, I have to be careful not to take those people for granted. I have to be careful not to lose them, because you get so very few in an entire lifetime. You have to remember that these are the people who make you…whole. I remember part of one of my Pleasantville quotes I omitted was “Maybe you only know it when its gone. Maybe its like theres a whole piece of you thats missing too.” That’s when bud’s talking to his dad and hes making his dad (george) realize that he really does love betty and that “maybe it isn’t just the cooking or the cleaning” that he misses. And I think those few people almost become such an important, necessary part of your life, that they become a part of who you are, that they, as I said, make you…whole. and those are the people in your “inner circle” (or…perhaps they overlap with the (me) a little bit) those are the people you  really  love. and that’s all im going to say about love because that’s all I’m prepared to defend. So…just…remember you only get a few and remember to let them know you really care about them. appreciate those people for me, okay? Thanks.

      (i dont know why it deleted this...im really starting to hate this thing)  i dont care who you are, its every kids dream to have superpowers. its every kids dream to wake up one day and be able to fly. its every kids dream to have xray vision and shoot web from his wrists. i remember when i was little kid come home from seeing some movie or somethng and id run around my room imagining what itd be like to have superpowers and id try to discover my own powers. but now im older and ive learned comic books and movies and superheros in general sell because its all a gaint metaphor. the sudden change and power and responsibility is all a metaphor for puberty. everyone can relate. except i never really thought of it that way when i was little. all i wanted, i think, was to be special. i felt like there was this great potential inside everyone to have some sort of power to do great things with and i couldnt find mine. when i was little i thought that might be superpowers. im older now. i dont wish i had superpowers. i dont need them. im older now. i know lots of real heros. people who dont have magic powers from some freak accident, but people who are just genuinely good people who do all they can to make the world a better place and they do it cause its the right thing to do. people who cant lift 10000 times their own weight or fly or...shoot web from their wrists. but heros all the same. gaints among the rest of us. im working on being one of those now. but heres to the real heros. and heres to all my heros. they may not have rescued me from a burning building and flown me to safety. but ive been saved quite a few times. so heres to all the heros i know. youre bigger than the rest of us. stand tall. (Micheles wrong. I am not the bigger person.)

      Well, we're all at Amanda's house for a sleepover and i just found out what a blog thingy was while i'm listening to "TROGDOR!!!!"  We're having great fun playing scrabble...the play of the day "nad" then with an 's' added and then finally "go" added so it was "gonads".  Very ingenious.  Now we're all listening to the time warp...It's just a jump to the left,  THEN A STEP TO THE RIGHT , put your hands on your hips,  AND BRING YOUR KNEES IN TIGHT, NOW THE PELVIC THRUST, IT REALLY DRIVES YOU INSANE!!!!! LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!!!!! .  That's a really good song in a really creepy movie/musical.  While trying to decide whether to watch Daria or not, My Favorite Things plays in the background.  Eh, they're all wondering what I'm writing about but I'LL NEVER TE-E-ELLLLL!!!! AHAHAHAHAH, but Amanda's gunna have to proof read it anyway and check that it's not full of lewd or inappropriate things anyway but whateva, i do what i want!  (Clevland rocks, clevland rocks, clevland rocks, clevland rocks, clevland rocks...clevland rocks OHIO)   Now there's a little aerosmith playing....ahhhh YEAH. Aerosmith is a truly great band...i mean seeing as they're still going when they should be getting hip replacements has to say something for their greatness.  No one know's what to do..."Truth or dare?" was suggested by amanda and i promptly exclaimed "Oh, I WILL!" but somehow that didn't work out.  The "Lets go outside" suggestion was quickly squashed.  I wouldn't want to anyway, i mena there are loads of bugs out there.   (Did you know if you were famous and you killed your wife, there' s no such thing as 25 to life as long as you got the cash for Cochrin")    Somehow the misquitos seem to know where my main veins are...stupid bugs, i mean get a life, "blood-sucker" isn't exactly impressive on a resume (i don't know how to make accent-ma-bobs on the computer, eh, whateva, i do what i want).  Well i'm being sucked into truth or dare and amanda keeps hitting my leg with the cord. shreky

      i didnt know where to write this..either in blog or in profile or in email to emily or in my diary. probalby in the diary but id rather type. and i dont want to email emily because...i dont feel like making her read this and deal with me. i make her deal with me too much. i make her do too many things. i should leave her alone. let her be. sometimes i wonder if im even trying to be a good friend. am i trying to do whats right? or am i just doing what i think i want to do and assuming its the right thing...because, even though i may do it with the purest intentions, i still may not be doing the right thing. that doesnt probably make sense unless youre me. what i mean is...i try to be a good friend in that i want to be a good friend...so i want to be helpful and all that...but is that the right thing to do? i suppose so. but maybe what i want to do isnt really being the good friend i should be...being. but i dont know. im not getting into that. all i know is...countless times ive put up an away message that says "dont ever love anyone, it just screws things up" and it does. it does. it does. it does. and in my case it makes me crazy. today i have basicaly admited to myself that i am not normal and its a bad kind of not normal. at least in this particular relm. because somehow, somewhere between...the begining of 8th grade and now...probably before now considering i was already crazy a long time ago...i think somewhere between july before 9th and march of 9th i went crazy. i dont know when or exactly why. but i did. and im still crazy. and i appologize so much for being this way. im sorry. im sorry. im sorry. but i dont know if i want to fix it so much either. because, for the most part, i make sense to me and i agree with me. and i will die and go crazy...really crazy when i graduate, but ive still got 3 good years till then.  [this above part typed wednesday...this below part typed saturday] like...holden crazy. well, maybe not. id go holden crazy if emily died. kinda like losing an allie, no? but thats a different story. ive been scaring myself lately with how much holden can remind me of myself...or make sense to me. like the whole prostitue thing...we were talking about it in english...both at my table and in our little card groups. people are like "hes crazy...he orders this prostitue then he ends up not sleeping with her and paying her anyway...and he was just complaining about how hes still a virgin" and im like...how do they not understand that? he wants to still be a virgin...but anyway. maybe thats just a reading thing and not a holden thing...but, like, how voelker said that he feels guilty for allies death...like he should have been able to stop it, even though that completely illogical, part of his brain thinks he could have been able to do something...and like how he thinks its not fair that allie died...that all makes perfect sense to me...especially the thinking he should have been able to do something part. ive probably actually thought that before...but i cant think of a good example. but thats so something i would think and i can understand how hed think that. and people are like "thats crazy"...but, hey, maybe im crazy. well, i am. and like...the whole coward thing with holden...that i get...and the jane gallegar or whatever her name was...that makes sense...and a bunch of other stuff...its kinda creeping me out... especially the allie thing though. being an older child and having noticed the need to protect and be responsible for those i care about in myself. ive written many emails explaining that too. anyway...my point in writing this was cause i was freaking out about how crazy i am...but now im better. im still crazy, but...i dunno. its not such a bad kind of crazy. its a good way to live when youre happy...but it freaks you out and makes you doubt your way of thinking when youre not. most of the time im fairly happy. i dunno what was up with me this week...its not like i was incredibly sad...i just...i dunno. i felt weird...like...unwell, sort of...but not physically. but im okay. i think i just need something else to be worried and concerned with besides my own thoughts and craziness and dependencies... i need a boyfriend. thats what i need. i could take a break from all this pensive crap and just be infatuated...thatd be alright.  hint hint.  *looks hopefully at heart* mmm...nothing yet. maybe im too pensive and insightful and all that...or am i even those things in the first place? i spent a lot of time thinking about crazy things...and important things...and all that....so i guess thats why people call me "deep"...and according to kara that means im insightful and smart. i dunno about smart. brilliant perhaps...but not necessarily smart. :-D. well, insane or brilliant. i wrote a poem about that....that was kind of a weird poem. well all i know is im not normal. im pretty crazy. ive yet to determine if this is a good thing. ill ask emily. hopefully she can provide me with some sort of help....though i might only get an "i dunno" i get too many of those. she has time this weekend...i want answers, dammit. if she wanted a normal friend that asked normal questions, she shouldntve ever talked to me. granted she probably didnt know what she was getting into...but oh well. anyway, this is kind of rambling and getting off topic now....most of my entries arent like this...well...a change then. i havent written anything in a while either...too busy with school and such. ill write again later. probably this weekend or by next. but...yeah...hoped you enjoyed reading about my craziness.

      okay, i never actually meant to publsih the thing on change and the thing on faith in change or whatever...i just kind of wrote them and "post"ed them (which means it shouldnt show up when other people read my blog, but i can see it) so that i could decide later how i wanted to rewrite them or if i wanted to actually publish them, cept it seems to somehow have posted them both for me...i tried to get rid of the faith one cause i didnt even finish typing that (it was late...i fell asleep) but i dont know if it worked...so basically im just informing everyone who bothers to read this that i didnt mean for those to be on here, but if they still are, well...i tried getting rid of them and it didnt work. so just ignore it or read it anyway...do what you want.

      I was looking at my profile a few days ago to make sure I changed it as I wanted. And I was looking over everything that’s always there and I read my “random proverb” and usually I don’t think much about them…they’re obvious things like “its better to light a candle than curse the darkness” or something. But that day I got a proverb I really thought about. “Live your own life, for you will die your own death”-Latin Proverb. And I didn’t like it. Because I don’t think we really live our own lives. I don’t think we’re put on earth to live for ourselves. I don’t live for myself. I don’t even own my own life. Other people own me. My family owns my life, my friends own my life, people I have yet to meet own my life. It’s not mine. It’s theirs. I think a person lives to touch others, to change lives, to be there for those who need them. Like George Eliot said, “What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?” So I don’t think I live my own life. I don’t think I want to live my own life. My life is not mine, it was never mine. It belongs to anyone who’s life is better now because I exist. It belongs to every stranger I’ve ever smiled at, and it belongs to those few people who will never be the same because of me. That’s why I have absolutely no problem with giving away pieces of myself-pieces of my soul. My soul was never mine, anyway. I told someone once in gym that I sold part of my soul earlier in the morning for free. I got the weirdest look. Like “either you’re joking, or you’re sick.” And I just laughed because…well, just cause I gave away a piece of paper (well, 2) that says “A piece of Amanda” doesn’t mean I’ve lost a part of myself and will now never be a whole and real person. Nothing of the sort! I gave away that part of myself a long time ago talking between bus seats in the rain thousands of miles from home…and boom, it was gone. Maybe I didn’t know it then, but it was. But as i said, it wasn’t mine, it didn’t ever belong to me, it was always someone else’s. I was just kind of holding it till I could give it away. From the day I was born, it wasn’t mine, I just didn’t know who it belonged to yet. Well, there were a lot of things I didn’t know about myself the day I was born. But I’m not getting into that. So I refuse to live my own life, for I do not live for myself. I mean, what am I? what will I be when I am gone? Once i die and am buried in the earth, people will not remember me as I was. Only I will ever know who and what I truly am. People will remember what I did for them, what I was to them…what part of myself is now a part of them. And is not that also what I am? Oh, the question of what I am… “Tell me who admires you and loves you, and I will tell you who you are.” said Charles Augustin Sanite-Beauve. Who am I then, but all I mean to others? And if that is what I am, then I think it is those others who own me. And if I do not own myself, then I cannot live my own life. I will live for the people I love…I will live to love them! And I will live not my own life, but a life I owe to them! And I will die not my own death, but the death of the person who was loved and who meant so much to all these other people. I will not die my own death in that it is not mine! It cannot be mine if my life is not mine. I don’t own my death as I don’t own my life. So screw the proverb, I will not live my own life, and I will not die my own death! A life doesn’t belong to the one who lives it. One is not made only of his own substance. He is made of all things he has ever seen, ever heard, ever felt, ever experienced. And I am not made of myself. I am made of all things I have ever lived. I am made, mostly, of other people. And if that is so, how can I say that I have my own life? I do not.

      i think, if youre ever truly happy for a long period of time (you know, like...not just one day...but...a month or more, maybe), your worst enemy is change. if you can be mostly at peace with the world, the only thing you have to fear is change. because one day, you wont be this happy anymore, and itll just be a memory. nothing lasts forever. all things come to an end. happiness is fleeting. all that. so you fear change, you avoid it, you hide from it, you pray it wont come. but it does. it has to. and then youre just left bitter and hating the world for putting an end to something that made your life so perfect and balanced. and then you just go on hiding from change because it burned you before, and you dont want to give it a second chance. but you know you have to. life changes, people change, whether you want them to or not. and you know deep down that its stupid because not all change is bad. a life without any change at all would be horrible. even a life with bad change is worth it because you get the good change. but still, its hard and you fight change even though you know it has the potential to be wonderful. and you hate yourself for it. but you do it anyway. and your friends tell you its stupid and you shouldnt live your whole life hating change and avoiding it. and you know, and you agree, but its hard. its just...so hard. especially when things keep changing...and you dont know whether its gonna be a good change or a bad change. all you know is the uncertainty. and uncertainty is a scary thing. and you dont think its fair because all you wanted, all you ever really wanted, was just to be happy and to love and to be loved and just...be at peace. but things change. and it doesnt matter what you wanted or if you deserved it or how much you appreciated it while you had it. things change anyway. and you feel like it doesnt matter who you are or if youre even a good person...change doesnt care at all. its not going to stop and listen to you and decide to hold itself back simply because you want it to, even if you deserve it. it just...does its thing and changes. and you sigh and bear it. but its so hard to embrace change after that. its just...its so hard.

      just got back from seeing Luther with Michele and Emily and Martha. it was okay. bad ending... just kinda ended. they went from "oh, know, youre gonna die" "i love you" to "yay, im not gonna die" "yay" and then it faded to black and the credits came on. it was a bad ending. fiennes wasnt as bad looking as i thought hed be....still not too attractive though. learned a bit about the reformation. mostly i enjoyed it because now on monday when people ask me "so whatd you do this weekend?" i can say with pride "oh, i went to see a movie with my friends" "really? which movie?" "Luther." ...yep, this is what i do with my life. i go see historical movies because were learning about that in school...even though i dont get extra credit...yeah...i dunno. i mostly went cause of all things we study...the reformation does kind of interest me. its about all i remember from world history, anyway. and i did think joseph fiennes was really good in Shakespeare in Love...and hey, i get to see Emily...which is reason enough in itself to do just about anything. and i feel better now... and that is good. and i was reminded that emily and i sort of still have our little secrets from everyone else... which i guess is not necessarily a good thing...but it is because...i dunno, because it is. hopefully i can get her to sleepover next weekend or the one after... depends when erics gonna want her... but it was decided that emily should be jasmine for halloween. and eric should be aladdin. and its funny...just because emily dressed up as jasmine is an amusing mental image. and...mm, im tired. i think im just gonna go. ill have to actually write something on this in a few days. cause now im starting to use it as a real blog which was never my intention. ill write a nice little passionate speech or something...eventually...maybe after i get back from the confirmation kick off class thing tomorrow. maybe ill be annoyed by the lack of piety among my classmates and ill be spurred to write...or something. who knows? but here...picture emily like this:

      so, i feel like i should write in this. have yet to decide if i will delete my ramblings on emilys soul. i have a little deal with jessica to settle about that, i think. well see based on the results.   so, ive been obsessed with Joseph Fiennes yesterday and today. obsessed and disappointed. cause he was pretty hot in Shakespeare in Love and ive seen pictures from Luther which im going to see tomorrow probably and he...just...the hotness is gone. he was pretty hot in Shakespeare in Love though. i think thats because he was playing a poet and playwrite and....incredibly romantic guy...which makes him look even better. Why cant i get one of those? arent there sexy, brilliant 15 year old poets out there somewhere? i want them!!!!! i could use a boyfriend... meh...my love life...now theres a sad story.   ah, now im watching shakespeare in love... yay. the romance.  oh, had an interesting conversation with jessica yesterday...i wont get into it, but i thought this amusing: PangMasterJayJ: But to be honest, if you haven't told me last year that you weren't gay, I probably would've started wondering about now... haha...as i write about how i find fiennes attractive...  okay, i have nothing else to say, so im going to post this. gotta watch my movie, right?  heres a picture of the very good looking mr. joseph fiennes:

Haha...think of all the things i think but never write down... all the crazy things. anyway. i think im gonna take that away. at least the soul part. maybe keep the picture...i dunno. dont want to creep out emily if she actually reads this. i need to go get some sleep now... as always.   night.

      alright, alright. ive been meaning to write in this for a while. i got a cool new thing that helps me do blogging. called "Bloggar" or something. Yes, blogg ar  different from brogg er . its some free downloadable software that lets you type stuff in a different window thing and you can save and it isnt online...its basicaly like a word processor version of the website. i like it cause i got pissed off with the website for deleting some of my previous entries. so wahts up with me? schools annoying. too much work. i have an english speech to write. erg. on how holdens admirable. its not that bad, i do think holden is admirable. i just dont want to work on it. i changed my mind. mr johnson is pretty cool. and i get to bribe my freshmen this week. "bribe." im not realy bribing them...im just brining candy cause im a nice sophomore. or something. euro is a little less mind-bolging. no news otherwise. still havent had emily sleepover like i wanted to. grr... sometime... she said..well, i dont remember exactly what she said, but something somewhat comforting yesterday... along the lines of "sometime soon, i promise" and was actually listening to me when i said theres a three day weekend soon. good signs? methinks yes. i hope, anyway. its ("it"...) getting bad. to the point where other people are noticing. michele...heather...martha somewhat...caitlin...my mom sort of...crazy. theyre all like "is it hard not seeing her so much now that she has a boyfriend?" and what am i supposed to say? i dont want to blame eric...i dont know that it is erics fault...probably partially. she does sit with him in the mornings now... and he is the reason shes busy some weekends. but, i dunno. i just gotta deal with it. being sad and wishing it was last year or 8th grade or summer school or...anything but what it is, doesnt do any good, does it? i keep telling myself to just not worry about it and keep doing all i can to talk to her...thats the best i can do. better to light a flame than curse the darkness. optimism. power of human will. if i put my all into something, i cant fail. all that. but...ive already talked too much about this. dont want to creep emily out if she reads this. ...so what have i been up to?  well, this weekend...mmm, i worked in the church garden on sunday morning. with michele and andrew. it was okay. dont really know what that has anything to do with God, but whatever. community service is good. was awkward with andrew. dont really know him that well. used to talk to him sometimes...not anymore. no classes or anything. hes a good guy, though. michele told me im a romantic...or that i am romantic...one of those. something along the lines of "you wouldnt know it, but youre such a romantic." i thought that was interesting. that was after we were arguing about which is the best disney movie and i said beauty and the beast and she said lion king and i said "but beauty and the beast is a love story." i suppose shes right. depends how you define romantic. those kinds of things are things almost no one knows about me, and the ones who do know them dont know much. im not at all what i appear to be. not deep on the squish inside, anyway.   most people arent everything they appear to be, though. but what can you say a person appears to be? you cant tell much about anyone from their appearence. the connection between a physical person and what you know them to be has always been something i never quite liked. partially cause i dislike the physical world. like, on my profile, it says "a soul is worth a million times the flesh." and i really believe that. but then its weird...cause yesterday, when i went out with cait and kara and jessica...i was at caits, right? and i look over at jessica...and i dunno what i was thinking...but i was looking at her teeth and i was just realizing i have no idea what her teeth look like. ive never payed attention to her teeth before. not that this shocked me or anything. just...i dunno. reminded me of when i was just looking at emily for a while in arziona and she was all like "stop staring at me, its creepy"... its good to memorize people though. its amazing how different people are. how unique each person is. i got to thinking about that when i was looking at jessica's teeth. not just their teeth though...and i dont really mean that physically at all... everyones soul is quite different. then that got me thinking about how incredible just one person is... and it got me wanting to know my friends better. and thinking about how emily said "it feels like you hardly know me anymore"...and i dont know if she meant that or not, but i feel like i want to know more about her now...ive always been up for learning new things about her. makes me  really  want to get to know her though. makes me want to say i know her soul. and do i? i dont know. hopefully partially. but how do you go about knowing someones soul? i have no idea... you have to really talk to them, i think. like, really. and i havent been doing enough of that. but i want to....i really want to. ...stupid friends and their busyness. thats not an unreasonable request, is it? "Emily, please come sleep over so i can try to understand your soul, so i can know you beyond all facts and opinions and preferneces...so i can know what you are...those things that you are that you cant even explain. i want ot know those things." on one hand, how do you say no to that? but on the other...what  do  you say to something like that? maybe im just really crazy... but its hard to know that, to you, someone exists beyond mere existence, but that you do not fully understand everything that this person really is... its hard to be in awe of everything someone is and not want so badly to know all of those things.  and, wow, ive got to finish my homework and get to bed. so screwed for my english speech. damn. oh well. night.   urlLink

      This is gonna sound really weird...But i was thinking about it for some reason...and i decided that, although, in general, blood doesnt creep me out too much, there are certain situations where it would really creep me out and certain ones where it wouldnt at all.  Like if i came upon some stranger bleeding to death or something, that would really scare me. to see the wounds and everything. or severed body parts....ewwww.  But when i bleed, that doesnt bother me...not really. i guess ive never had a major injury where ive bled a lot, so maybe i dunno how id feel then... but i do cut myself and stuff...and there is that crazy time once a month when my body decides to rip itself apart...theres some blood involved in that... none of that really creeps me out.  And heres the reason i really wrote this...cause i was thinking about this... I dont think it would bother me to get Emilys blood all over me. I mean, itd bother me in that "Oh, God, Emilys bleeding! Call 911!" afraid for her safety sort of way, of course...but the actual bleeding and grossness... dont think itd care, really. i wouldnt be like "ew, emilys blood is on me! gross! get it off! get it off!" and im not saying it would make me cringe but id push that nauseas feeling out of my mind and just deal with thinking through first aid or whatever...not that... i mean, in all honestly, it wouldnt bother me. well, i wouldnt enjoy it, but i wouldnt really dislike it especially (ignoring the fact that id be freaking out cause its not healthy to just bleed everywhere all the time). just all indifferent, like "yeah, blood, thats nice." kinda like how mr. mattucci was talking about when people throw up on you a few days ago....though this is blood cause id rather get blood on me. and im probably more likely to get blood on me. i dunno...i just dont think it would bother me. it would bother me less to get emilys blood on me than a strangers blood or even some of my other friends' blood on me. werid, huh? maybe its psychological... i mean, if you love someone for who they are, for everything they are... everything  they are... then i dont think it should bother you. ....emilys blood is just a part of emily. i dunno...   blood...have my posts come to this? im afraid so...     look, magnified blood! platelets! (this is me taking advantage of the fact that i can post pictures in here)

      There is no such thing as a "self-made" man. We are made up of thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us, or spoken one word of encouragement to us, has entered into the make-up of our character and of our thoughts, as well as our success. - George Matthew Adams  hmmm...that sounds familiar, no? George Matthew Adams stole my thoughts!

      health projects stuck. especially this one. stupid personal trainer plan. i do  not   want to be a personal trainer. none of this interests me... you know what id rather think about/learn about? id rather be writing or something... or learning about how people think... mmm, i gotta figure out what im gonna submit to half wit too.. arg, and i have to talk to julie... too much to do. and i gotta figure out what of olivias im wearing on friday...  and...fencing stuff to order... and a confirmation retreat to sign up for. and dinner i should have eaten by now... and... hmmm, too many other things to be thinking about. and you know what id like to be doing? more than anything in the world? yeah, thatd be nice... a little staring at the stars and playing truth or dare and getting splashed and then some beauty and the beast and finally sleeping, perhaps? mostly the truth or dare though.. its weird though, cause its not that that was the most fun thing ive ever done...but it was so... peaceful. i dunno, i havent felt like that in a while. and scaring little kids in the rain... that was great too. i love rain. ive always loved rain. that was also very peaceful... and my mental vacation... to my bed and bob and tiredness... peaceful. thats what i want... i want to feel peaceful like that, to feel happy and loved and...like all is right in the world. the "i love life" kind of happiness. mmmm... *closes eyes, smiles and hugs bob (whom she has just fetched)* what i wouldnt give to feel like that again... oh, well... soon enough, right? eventually... after all, emily might be able to sleep over in 2 weeks. and whats it been? a long time... 5 months? 6 months? thats way too long... or did she sleepover after arizona? i dunno, but either way its been forever. of course now its been built up too much anyway... been waiting too long... but oh well... i just really really hope she can in 2 weeks. and...and...and... i gotta get working on that health project. grr...    an artsy rain painting called "Spring Rain" by John Sloan... i dunno, i was just looking through google images for rain pictures... mmm, rain.

      you know, maybe my first 2 periods are just depressing? or...maybe its just that im so tired and theyre so boring that all i do is let whatevers bothering me drive me crazy... and by the time i get to math i have to pay attention, so it helps me think about something else...   lyrics/quotes of mind circulation: "he says, 'Bill, i believe this is killing me.' as the smile ran away from his face" -Paino Man "I won't miss your arms around me / holding me tight" -Dont Turn around "Your flowers of flaming truths" -Frank Sinatra "in love? Out. of love? of her favor where i am in love!" -Romeo and Juliet "I am afeared being in night all this is but a dream" -Romeo and Juliet but really Shakespeare in Love "If i could write the beauty of her eyes i was born to look in them and know myself" -Shakespeare in Love "This is not life, Will. This is a stolen season" -Shakespare in Love "I wish i had a pot [belly]... if i had one, id wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it" -Pulp Fiction "'Millie? Does the White Clown love you?' No answer. 'Millie, does--' He licked his lips. 'Does your 'family' love you, love you  very  much, love you with all their heart and soul, Millie?" -Fahrenheit 451 "Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out." -Protestant martyr Lancaster? i dont remember how to spell his name or if that was his name for sure...so ill look it up and fix it later.  yeah...those are just things ive been thinking about lately...i dunno... some profound...some not.

      "sometimes i wish things would ask permission before they changed, even if your answer didnt make a difference in the end, because at least they would have cared enough to ask. and to know that life gave a damn what i needed to be happy...that would be so nice"  add that to my perfect world. if it isnt there already. is it? eh, im too lazy to look. i thought this was nice wording though.

      okay...abortion. i was thinking about it. not really sure why. and i dont exactly know whether im pro-life or pro-choice. i think im pro-choice... but theres no way id ever have an abortion. i think its morally wrong...but i do think people have the right to choose. i mean, if you get raped or something and you cant have the child and you can live with having an abortion, then i guess its your choice. i wont condemn you for choosing it, although i dont think its right. i dont think the government should enforce my morals on everyone...they can do what they want... i just dont think its right. there are a lot of things that arent illegal that i dont think are right. adultery isnt illegal. betrayal isnt illegal. smoking isnt illegal. infidelity isnt illegal. blasphemy isnt illegal. sex before marriage isnt illegal... and some more stuff. doesnt mean that should all be illegal. but... i dunno... its a human life, man. in my opinion, no man has the right to end another mans life. and you can say an unborn child doenst count as a man or whatever...but it definitely does. you know what?  Day 21 - The embryo's body is approximately 1/10 of an inch long. The brain has two lobes. At some point during this week, before the mother's period is one week late, the embryo's heart will begin to beat.  before you even know for sure that youre pregnant...your kid has a heartbeat! now that doesnt count as a living human being? bah...craziness. heartbeats are such a human thing... i dunno man, how do you silence a heartbeat?  **i listened to your heart beat as i held you in my arms**  all i know is, i couldnt do it.

      ive decided this weeks theme will be: dont let it bother you, be blinded by your determination. let nothing make you sad as long as you truly believe in yourself and wont let yourself fail. focus only on what you can do to make it better and not how much it sucks. no one ever acomplished anything by just wanting it. i am a soldier. i was never content to let the world steal from me what i wanted with all my heart. if you want something, you have to go out and fight for it, because no one is just gonna hand it to you. and it takes a hell of a lot out of you to go full force against something, but i think, in the end, itll be worth it. what, after all, can you regret if you tried your hardest? so, watch out you bastard of a world. youve pissed me off enough already, and im not gonna just sit and be sad about it anymore. im declaring war.   wow, times liek these i wish i had a punching bag or something...i could really go to town on one of those about now. "die you stupid [punch] bastard world! You cant  [punch] take this [punch] away from me. i wont [punch] let you. i will  [punch]  not  let this die [punch]. i'll be damned [punch] if you steal my friend [punch] my peace [punch] my sanity [punch] my emotional stability [punch] my happines [punch] my way of life [punch]. im [punch] stronger than [punch] this. and i will [punch] kick your [punch] ass. [spits and takes a drink of water] you cant have her [kick]" >:o  thats how you know when you have a real friend... you know, when they beat the crap out of an imaginary punching bag because theyre mad that they dont feel very close to you anymore.     or...maybe thats just me.

      "anyway, i guess what im saying is...if you really love someone...it doesnt matter what kind of changes life throws at you...you do whatever you can to stay close to that person...and maybe that sounds crazy and like a whole lotta work...but if love 'em, its worth it."  i am not a hypocrite, i am not a hypocrite, i am not a hypocrite, i am not a hypocrite...  its a hell of a lot easier to say that crap then it is to live it. but im workin on it. and actually, i have a new motivation... im on heather miller's profile...band drum major. emilys sisters good friend. i think i told her i was gonna steal her cape once...when i didnt recognize her and i didnt think i knew her. eh, oh well. but anyway, if shes gonna go through the trouble of appreciating the crazy rants ive made... then i damn well better stick to what i say.   my quotes that have been on her xanga (that i know of, anyway):   "They say nothing can be perfect...but you can have the perfect friend, the perfect day, the perfect piece of advice, the perfect...a lot of things. Things...as well as people, can be perfect in their imperfection. Perfection is not so much the total absence of flaws as it is the presence of  the most desireable characteristics according to the situation. My perfect day is not the perfect day. Perfection is pretty personal anyway."  "if the world does not see fit to give you out of life all that you deserve, those closest to you will be sure to make up for all the times the world fell short."  "look at your friends and tell me there's no God...if you can, get new friends"      and, that, actually, is misquoted... assuming shes quoting me, which i think that she is. its really, "Just look at your friends and tell me there's not a God...If you can honestly do that, get new friends" but it doesnt matter, its the same message.  yeah, so thats not a big deal or anything... but, i dunno... it made me feel better cause it makes me seem less crazy... and i feel so crazy nowadays.

      oh, wow... definitely going crazy and complaining to julie.  yellowfuzz13: and the emily withdrawal is starting to take over yellowfuzz13: and one day....im just gonna snap ... yellowfuzz13: but i might like totally freak out and just be like "ahhh, f*** everything!" and go curl up in a ball and throw bob across the room and lay in bed and just...not even think. yellowfuzz13: which would be pretty bad yellowfuzz13: thats me going crazy yellowfuzz13: i can see that...me trying to think about nothing... being like "you cant hide from whats bothering you" "shut up, shut up, shut up" "this doesnt solve anything" "i dont care, im sick of thinking about it...im sick of thinking" "youll just have to think about it later" "i said, shut up!" and then i squish all thoughts and try to still think about nothing yellowfuzz13: while bob mocks me with his plastic eyes yellowfuzz13: yeah...i just typed this whole imagined conversation with the bear...but you dont need to read that yellowfuzz13: see? im crazy now... yellowfuzz13: planning my conversations with inanimate objects i will resent for their connection to people i miss and am sick of missing.... thats not normal, is it?  i seriously did type bob and is conversation:  Bob: "you used to love me"  Me: "yeah, well, youre not the symbol you used to be"  Bob:"so i mean nothing to you now?"  Me: "i dont know...i dont know..."  Bear:"we had so many happy memories together"  Me: "back when i actually knew who emily was" Bear: "you can still love me"  Me: "love you for what?" Bear: "the memory i am"  Me: "that would just be clinging on to the past"  Bear: "a past you loved"  Me: "one ought not to live in the past" Bear:  "you can still appreciate it"  Me: "dont sugar coat it, bear"  [turns around in bed so that she can no longer see Bob]  thats kinda werid, isnt it? ah, i dunno... i dont want to be mad at bob. poor bob...everyone used to love bob. thats my mental vacation... just like i used to do so many times over the summer before 9th. my mental vacation is...me, having arived home from a fun and tiring sleepover, curingly up in a compact ball of warmth and tirendess in my bed squeezing tight little bob and feeling really happy and content and loved and, just, hugigng that bear for all the wonderful things it represents...loving its touch, its feel, its sight, its smell... breathing bear, breathing memories... and just... feeling so peacefully tired. in a way where everything felt good and right and all i had to do all day was sleep and sleep and sleep... tranquil sleep. and i havent felt like that in soooo long. i guess sort of in arizona...but emily was there so it wasnt the same. my mental vacation does not involve being in the same bed with emily...haha, no. maybe erics does though... (or, brandon's, rather) but...i dunno... good old bob isnt so much the proud symbol he used to be. i guess he still stands for my memories, which are good... but i shouldnt lie in bed at night with bob needing the small amount of peace he affords me to have some content sleep. thats like a drug or something... crazy. and, in truth, i dont need that to fall asleep...but its a happier, better sleep if i do than if i just fall alseep due to fatigue...which i end up doing most nights. i fall asleep in the middle of my thoughts. a lot of the time its like, "our father, who art i-zzzzzzzzz" yep.   but anyway, i think im seriously gonna go a little crazy sometime soon...cause its insane...all this waiting and im already soooooooooooooo incredibly sick of waiting and being lonely and wanting to know more... and having none of that quenched...and weekend after weekend goes by and it just builds and builds and...i dunno... either im gonna go emotionless and give up and all that crap or im gonna totally freak out and get really sad and really stressed out and just be all "i cant take it anymore" and run away and sleep and sleep and sleep and read and read and read and just try to escape into anything i can escape into. and thats a horrible way to live. either way this sucks...its kinda weird...im freaking out now cause im too detached from a person i depend on for soooooo many things...which isnt necessarily good, cause im probably overly dependant....but then i go from dependant to psycho....wheres teh ahppy medium? and if that was dependant...dependant wasnt so bad...it was pretty damn good, if you want to know. and wow ive said dependant a lot of times. dependant dependant dependant. weee. okay, i need my sleep now...   just...i miss emily a lot still...a whole lot...always. but sometimes more than others...like when im reminded of how little we talk and how little i know about her... today wasnt so bad until tonight though. was good stealing the jacket and wearing it around all day...so what if it gives me a somewhat false sense of being close to her? false or not, ill take what i can get. annoying assembly, but no big deal... she got online which was good too, got to laugh at the stupid field hockey people who dont think shes a virgin... but then theres this california business which steals her from me on the one night i had sort of thought was gauranteed id get her...halloween... but, nope, cant sleepover. its horrible! at the begining of the year it was like "jsut wait a few weeks, she can tdo something then" and i waited and i waited..and nothing and then finally it was like "ooooh, 3 day weekends, surely she could sleepover then"....but no.  both   are a no. and then it was like "well, theres still halloween" ...but no! i dont even get that! grrrrrrr. so theres that aspect to it, but then she says shes going to california and that she thought she told me and that shes been telling everyone....why am i the last to hear about this? thats how little i talk to her... i dont even know when shes leaving the goddam state anymore... eric knows soooooooooooo much more than i do about her! *long, painful, hopeless sigh* i know nothing... i try so hard, too. and still...nothing. this sucks. this sucks sooo much. im so sick of it too. i want my happiness back. its like i cant be truly happy until things are good between us...and theyre not now and they havent been...and i just...i can be happy...but not really truly happy where you feel so good about life and everything. its a life sucks kind of happy. i want an "i love life! there is a God! Olivia's crazy!" kind of happy... or, i dunno... at least complete and fully penetrating happiness... which i dont think i can get until that voice in the back of my head that has been worrying now for weeks and weeks and weeks and...well, at least a month...probably months...  going like "i miss emily" all the time and...other stuff too... and i cant be truly happy until that voice is silenced...not forgotten or ignored, but silenced...as in the problem has been fixed...and i have no worrys and no concerns whatsoever and i can just be happy. and if i wanna silence that voice, i gotta see emily more... but i cant becuase shes so freaking busy. so, that, emily, is why your busyness is detrimental to my happiness. not like i can never be happy unless im with you, because thats wrong, but... this craziness caused by my lack of...you is pretty all consuming and its making it hard for me to be totaly at peace with things....wich means i cant be really happy... which means im sooooooooooooooooooo sick of waiting for things to get better. and...im so tired. both of this and physically right now.  so i think im gonna go to bed... sigh... i wonder if shell read this... ah, i dont care.  This is what i want:

      Man, what is wrong with me? i click on this guy "Tom"s blog off of Jessicas blog...and im reading it and im like "hey, he seems like a cool guy" cause hes sorta senstive and whatnot and i dont know any truly sensitive guys and im kinda like "aw..." and hes not bad looking  (looked him up in the year book) and im all like "this is the kind of guy you should like..." except i cant like him cause i dont know anything about him and ive never met or seen him in real life...or, if i did, i didnt know it was him. my head is always doing stupid stuff like that to me... as soon as i think some guys an interesting person little warning lights go off in my brain and i think "hey, you could like him..." cause i havent liked anyone in so goddman long and i really wish i did. At first it didnt bother me at all that i didnt like anyone... i just didnt know anyone who seemed special to me. nothing wrong with that, right? of course not. i dont need to have a guy to like all the time... those people who like someone new every week and who cant go 2 days without having some stupid meaningless crush...those people...are definitely not who i want to be. but, man, its been such a long time... and im not seeing a whole lot of my friends now... and i think maybe one of the reasons it didnt bother me before...like this time last year... because i was too concerned with other friend-related matters and happy enough and loved enough to not be totally lonely (not that im incredibly lonely now)...and not to spend too much time thinking about it. i mean, i think i was too happy with things as they were to preoccupy myself with thinking too much about my romatnic life. and then i was too deeply involved with preserving certain friendships the begining of last year to really worry about it, i think... but now...i dunno. its bugging me cause its been soooo long. and a little cause peopleve asked if i was gay and i can say "no" but in truth havent liked anyone in a while... and its a little creepy. i mean, i know im not a lesbian or anything, but its just weird... and then emilys got eric now... and so i get to be jealous of her. and read those happily infatuated emails and sigh... (not that i dont want those emails...i do...but...you know...) i mean, she deserves him and all...she does. i just...wish i had someone to hope doesnt lose our homecoming tickets.  and  i just watched Shakespeare In Love... which is a stupid thing to do if you want someone to love/like. its a great movie though. so romantic. but im more likely to fall madly in love with joseph fiennes than i am with anyone i actually see every day at school and anyone whom id have a slight chance of dating or anything.... arg. i wish i had someone to like. but ic ant do that...cause i cant force myself to like someone...i dont want to and i just cant. but, man... i need someone to hug. i need someone to dream about. i need someone to be distracted with in class. i need someone who i can hope ill day ill see. i need someone my friends can make fun of me for liking. i need someone whod laugh to hear my planned out sports bra theory. i need... i need to go crazy for some guy! grrr...damn my heart.   "when all you wanted, all you wantes, sally, was to love and to love and to love and to love, and no one could call that crazy" damn i love that quote.  someone...please...save me from this craziness. make me like you.

      Things i need to stay moderately sane: -to not be sucking entirely at fencing -to be getting A's (but a b+ in math is okay) in my classes -enough good food -enough sleep -enough time talking to friends -enough emily -some sort of spiritual filfillment...this can be any number of things -at least a few christmas songs a day -something to look forward to  i dunno, probably more... but those are the main things.  its hard to get them all.... usually i end up losing the sleep one and the emily one and the spiritual one... which i guess makes them seem like the most important... a lot of those are connected too... hmm... sad cause i feel like i cant get all of them...and when i dont get all of them my performance lacks in teh rest or wahtever...so...yeah. kinda feels impossible. but whatever.  break soon. then break soon after that.   cant wait until christmas.  time for homework...

      this most likely will make no sense:  to be young and one who thinks is not easy. when you can think about what matters to you, and what your philosophy on life is and what relationships really mean to you and so fourth, when you can figure that all out for yourself...and you spout wise words backed up by small (though not without their substance) experiences... and you make idealistic promises to yourself and to others.... and then you go through a period where many of the things you believed to be true are tested... you have to stick to what you said, because you do not wish to be a hypocrite, and you want to stick to your values... its...just...hard..cause...ah, i dunno.  The burden of the wise youth is that he will not allow himself the luxury of learning things the hard way.  something like that.

OptiMist 23 6: whose friend? OptiMist 23 6: ur friend's firend? yellowfuzz13: my friend yellowfuzz13: any friend OptiMist 23 6: ok OptiMist 23 6: how can u be a friend tho OptiMist 23 6: what defines being a friend? yellowfuzz13: lots of things OptiMist 23 6: such as/// yellowfuzz13: i suppose loving someone so much as to want to offer them anything you have to give if they should need it, not expecting or desiring recompensation OptiMist 23 6: wow OptiMist 23 6: ok OptiMist 23 6: there go a lot of my friends... OptiMist 23 6: they at least want friendship in return OptiMist 23 6: :-) as do i OptiMist 23 6: i'd say OptiMist 23 6: ... yellowfuzz13: see, thats the thing... i mean, i think that, but then i think "is it so much to want time with someone? to want to be with them? talking to them? that is not asking for anything beyond what is expected of a friend, is it?" but then... i dunno. its not unreasonable to want that, of course, friends see each other. friends talk. right? however...its better to think about it like...its not about caring about each other equally and being as good a friend as the other person or whatever... if you love the person, then you give them all you have to offer.  i think it is better to have the attitude--especially if you feel like maybe youre not seeing someone enough or losing them or wahtever--of, like, "this is what i promise i will do for you whenever you want me to. i dont know how much you care about me, but it doesnt make a difference, i'm here should you want anything." ...i dunno. something like that. OptiMist 23 6: that's wonderful yellowfuzz13: because love, real love anyway, is always selfless.  aw, me on friends...

      yay. back from my emilyparty. was fun. i like emily. shes a pretty cool kid. by far the best part was talking to sheri...or maybe the box opening...that was definitely very entertaining. haha, boxes... she seemed to enjoy that. but sheri... and eric too i guess... it was great. not so much what we said but the way it was said... there was just like this acknowledgement that we both were her best friends, former and present... something like that. i dunno, i cant describe it... but there was this weird friendly thing... like we were kinda bonded in our love of emily. sort of... its odd because she was her very best friend when they were little but they dont talk so much now... though theyre not not friends... they just kinda grew apart. and me... i suppose im her current best friend. i dunno, it was weird but good... good because i felt like sheri really respected me as emilys close, trusted friend. like not a crazy friend you just think is funny and like to hang out with... like a genuine, cares for you deeply kind of friend. and that was nice. eric and sheri and i though...that was cool...when we were talking about emily... and there was just this knowledge that we all were very good friends with her...or were at some point... and were the closest of the close... but its weird because its not like i know eric very well or i know sheri very well or either of them know me very well or know each other very well... i dunno. it was nice to be respected and included as emilys really really good friend, because sometimes im afraid were not very close... yeah... anyway, talking to sheri = good. because.....i dunno, i cant even really get into it. but it was cool. and the boxes of course...fun stuff. and...mmm...im in such a good mood.   i suppose last year sheri asked me when emilys birthday was. me...out of all people. i suppose that was an acknolwedgement of our closeness. but not the same as this...  oh, and it was cool that her mom told me i was in charge of that table...cause even if she was joking, it means she sort of trusts me... which is cool. and i felt important plugging in the cds and stuff and messing around with stuff in her room. ah, emilys house... a place i have not been all that many times... but one i should know by memory so i can answer when people ask me things. yeah...uh...i dunno.  im so tired....and i have to get up at 5:00 am. damn. stupid fencing.  gonna stalk heather! ha...microwave.  i need to sleep.  i didnt sign emiys card. dammit. oh well. at least she knows my handwriting.   no robbie/julie fights...aw...  stupid those guys going after her box of memories...leave it alone.  and..and...yeah, id unno. her bible is way different than mine.  so tired. must sleep now. need set alarm. need pack stuff. need bring eyre. need bring music. need bring pen. need bring food money. need eat good breakfast. need...  *tired, content smile* i love emily. :-D. shes an awesome kid.

      CrAzY weekend. and week too, really. too busy. too much homework. too much homework today too, but oh well. Didnt have a chance to update what with fencing and homework and being in a pretty decent mood...having spent time with emily recently...  yeah. so friday i had fencing set up for the tournament yesterday and i had to go to school at 6:30 (this is friday) to tape strips and carry boxes and arrange reels and plug in reel cords and what not... and i was really tired so as soon as i got home from school at 4:15 or whatever i slept until 6:05ish and then got up and ate a bunch of goldfish and went to set up and came home and looked up T-mobile cell phone plans cause i want a new cell phone and my dad says before i can get a new phone he wants to switch to some new plan so that everyone in my family who has a cell phone (my dad, my mom, me, and soon to be alex) can call each others phones for free...sine thats mostly what i use my cell phone for. then i went to bed at like 11. got up at 6 on saturday to be at school by 7. SHS fencing invitational. Fenced five girls in my pool. lets see... i won 2 lost 3. i figured that wasnt too bad. considering it was forever till i beat anybody last year. well, i beat this one girl 5-0, this other 5-3, then lost 2-5 and 3-5. so i had a -3 indicatior. which is fairly good, right? i dunno, i wasnt too disappointed in myself. i mean, its not great, not really taht good...but its not totally sucky. was automatically in top 32. lost my DE though... however, it was close... i was winning for a while... ended up losing 11-15 which is pretty close. the girl was at least a year older than me, i believe. i dunno. culver. Erin lost to her, so... haha. i think i probably couldve beaten her in a 5 touch bout. but whatever... nobody who actually reads this blog (ha, does anybody?) cares about my fencing stuff anyway. so...i ended up staying at shs until maybe 5:35? then my dad picked me up and i ran home and showered as quick as possible and left with caitlin to go see musical. How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. it was pretty good. some good humor. Pit was cool. a little to long though... or maybe it seemed so because i was so freaking tired. i dunno. didnt go to bed till like 12:30 cause it didnt end till 11:30 and i didnt get home till 12. long day. im sore now from fencing. grrr. It was Pang's birthday yesterday. happy birthday pang. poor jessica...had to spend her birthday fencing and musicaling. and sick. i hope she didnt have a horrible day. Julies birthday too. but she apprently got to go shopping with heather and stuff... probably had more fun than pang. and guess whos birthday it is on tuesday? Emilys! which reminds me i gotta go to the mall today... eh. i wonder if she wants balloons? maybe i should ask. and if im getting her something...do i give it friday or tuesday? hmmm...decissions decissions. i wonder what eric'll do. maybe i should ask? ah, too much to think about. and cards... grr. write a card? did last year... i just wrote her an email... one of those "youre a great friend" emails... seems kinda soon to say all that again. hmmm.... well, ill have to do some sort of card... but then...give it friday or tuesday? hmm... and are we gonna do taht box thing? bah. too much to plan. good news is no fencing for me on tuesday. bad news is its because of sports awards...so shes gotta go to those so i cant spend my free time talking to her. :-( oh well. no fencing is good no matter what.   haha...caitin...(this wasnt our conversation...but something like this) "underwood-grobarek....underarek....underEric! haha, Emily undereric. get it?" ...she laughs... i laugh a little... she continues to laugh... i make a face like *id rather not think about that*. she says something like "well, not really i mean...but...hahaha" and im just like "its not fun to imagine" and shes like "i know, but its funny" and im like "think about it seriously though...just do it. seriously. imagine it" and she kinda stops laughing... "ew, no" and im like "just think them having sex. see it? see it?" and shes like "no, ew, stop." so i did. i think i proved my point though. its probably not the same for her as it is for me though... but maybe it is? shes known her since she was really little... i dunno. very unfun thought though. not until shes married! and...i dunno...i dont feel like thinking about this anymore.  bottle cap. "your dreams will come true"... or was it "your fantasy will come true?" oh well. either way... i wonder if that worked/will work? hope so. deserves it.  "i ask for nothing but that you accept what i give you and know that i am happy in giving it to you." -what is that describing?

      okay, totally watching this 6 hour movie "Angles in America" on HBO on december 7th. Thank you, newsweek.  "I dont want you to be impressed. I want you to understand. This is not sophistry. And this is not hypocrisy. This is reality. I have sex with men. But unlike every other man of whom this is true, i bring the guy i'm screwing to the White House and President Reagan smiles at us and shakes his hand. Because what i am is defined entirely by who i am. Roy Cohn is not a homosexual. Roy Cohn is a heterosexual man, Henry, who f***s around with guys." - a quote.

      Funny whats entertaining to people. I guess its all in what they value. Most teenagers like parties, most like concerts, most like sleepovers, most like attending sports games, some like seeing plays, most like going to the movies... i dunno, most teenagers generally like lots of things. But its funny how you can do the exact same thing with one of your friends and not have as much fun...not that you wouldnt have any fun, just.. like...the difference between "how was it?" "it was cool" and "how was it?" "omg that was the greatest thing ever!!! when can we go again?"... mmm, i dunno. just..,funny how Martha prefers fun like a Good Charolette concert..and i much perfer fun like talking and laughing with friends at 2:00 in the morning. eh, what you value... or maybe its not so much the "fun" but just... how it makes you feel... sure, concerts are fun...cool music and stuff... but...donde esta la paz? it feels good to talk to your friends late into the night. better than it does to jump around while sining along to music so loud you cant hear anything when you leave. not that thats not fun, cause it is, its just... i dunno. i like the former.  yeah, im done rambling. basically sleepover>concert.

      Man, when youre as crazy and mentally/emtionally fried as i am... you just... you cant more than one bad day in a row. bad days are hard enough... but a bad week? forget about it. youre screwed. fortunately i dont think ive had a completely bad week... ive had my share of several bad days... thankfully there are the small good parts of every day which sustain me. if it werent for those, i think id be reading and sleeping and drinking tea and doing nothing else. whcih, ironically, sounds like a better alternative to what i did all day today...watch movies and listen to music and complain on here and brood.  but its worse than it sounds... because when/if i totally freak out, i wont like... kill myself or whatever, ill never do that... especially over something like this...something this small... but id never kill myslef in the first place so it doesnt really make a difference over what... and thats for lots of reasons... but... anyway, i wont like...totally crack and go REALLY insane and start killing people and thinking the martians are out to get us and refuse to wear anything but tin foil or invent my own language and only speak it or... or anything like that. i think if i totally did freak out... well, i really have no idea what id do... but my best guess is that id turn to escapism. ie try to forget about everything i cant take anymore by drowning myself in other things. this is why there are alcoholics... but id never touch a drop, least not while im under 21, and id never do drugs or smoke or nothing... so my escapism would probably be reading and sleeping... cause the more you sleep the more time passes and the more rested yoru body feels... and the more you dream. fake reality...dreaming. and reading... losing yourself in the worries and concerns and struggles of a fictional progatonist. but anyway...  my point in this was: perhaps im so moody because i obssess over the small things and i overanalyize things and... well, i try to make nothing into everything and whatnot... but thats because im crazy right now and when i dont get any good conversation with her for more than a few days, then, yeah, im gonna freak out.... and over things that probably mean nothing. i cant help it... when i get so little... i dunno. when i get so little i cant afford to waste the time with my bad mood or with hers or whatever... i dunno, i just.... if i get several bad days in a row... then it builds and it crazies me. ...even though it may mean nothing...  just...yeah. i cant have very many bad conversations in a row without freaking out. i hope im just overreacting. i pray that i am.

      **So quiet another wasted night, the television steals the conversation exhale, another wasted breath, again it goes unnoticed.  Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break out of touch, out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed casue I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?  Close lipped another goodnight kiss is robbed of all it's passion, your grip another time, is slack it leaves me feeling empty.  Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break out of touch, out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed casue I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?  I'll wait until tomorrow maybe you'll feel better then maybe we'll be better then so what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts  of going on without you? this mood of yours is temporary it seems worth the wait to see you smile again out of the corner of your eye wont be the only way you're looking at me then.** "Again i go unnoticed"-Dashboard Confessional  hmmm....especially that last verse... "Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break...i'll wait until tomorrow. Maybe you'll feel better then, maybe we'll be better then. So whats another day? when i cant bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you... This mood of yours is temporary.

      how odd it is...to wet an ordinary object with tears on accident... and to think...how no one will ever know of that evidence...that once someone was crying. no one will ever suspect, ever think for just a second, that once there was sadness there, once there was fear, once there was love... and its all right there. proof... perhaps long dried and wiped away, but there in spirit. and no one will ever know. no one will ever wonder. no one will ever realize that right there, in their hands...is a witness to what is valued above all, to what tears apart, to what moves. a witness to the undeniable truths at the core of a human soul.  ...the secrets my chem book could tell.

      hmmm... do you know what its like to value something so much? to think everyone else is totally crazy for not believing so much in something? to be so much at peace with things and comfortable to think when you were sad "it doesnt matter, ive got whats really important" ... to exalt the virtues of something and pretty much just live for it? and that was you last year. and this year you still believe everything just as you did... but you dont really have it anymore. not as much, anyway, not what you had. and it kills you because this is what made you so happy last year and you still love it but... its not the same...and it might not ever be the same. and it starts to be that thats all you want anymore... thats the only thing you want... you just want what mattered so much to you last year, what still matters to you... you want to love it so much you go crazy and wonder how everyone could live without this! you want that back... but... but... stevenson didnt give you much, and youre busy and shes busy and theres not time and it drives you crazy cause you just miss her so much and you miss it so much and you want it back so badly... you just wanna be happy and at peace with things like you were before... thats all you want. all you want... is to feel close to her. and world wont let you and its driving you crazy cause that used to be so great, and it felt so good to be close to someone and matter to someone and have someone matter to you and you dont even know how much of that you still have anymore but you want it... you want it so much... and you just...   you miss her. and you miss knowing her inside out.  do you know what thats like? yeah, me too.

      Smell and Memory....wow. you know how it drives you crazy when you just catch a sent for a second and it brings back some vague memory and you cant quite remember what it is and all you know is that you have to smell it again? yeah... weird. My mom and my brother sititng in leather chairs playing monoploy chewing orbit gum in my parents bedroom in arizona...that smells like the Grattons house. when they lived in illinois. you know how peoples houses sometimes just have smells? and its not an uncleanliness thing...its not a gross smell kind of thing...its just like...a characteristic smell. you know what im talking about? yeah. just so weird... how smells can remind you of other smells and bring back all these memories and sensations and feelings and...just, wow.  and...i dunno...i could give more examples...but... itd get kinda creepy... just because of the subject matter and stuff...   but yeah...i dunno...smells...crazy.  "Sometimes a man will walk by who smells of my ex...He smelled of hot sand. I am always tempted to follow these people wherever they are going. To catch their elbows before they disappear into the crowd at a tube station, or scribble a note to slip into their pockets. I want to know what scent they use. To ask what right they have to smell like what, for me, will always be sex itself." -not exactly what im talking about, because...yeah...sex...but i dunno. ill include it cause i feel like it. from that "call girl"s blog.

           "socially incorrect" i think i should coin that term. unless its already been coined.... like "politically incorrect" but in reference to social situations. its probably already in use. but i want it for myself. mostly when im talking about the words "best friend" haha. hate those words for their social delicacy. fragile. gotta handle them with rubber gloves. but you know what? ill tell you a secret. sometimes i just feel like ripping off my gloves, taking that God dammed eggshell of a phrase, and shmashing it to peices. Then picking up the pieces and elmer's glueing them back together to make some sort of quirky, newfangled sculpture. Then tossing out the uncomfortably antiseptic gloves. In that cool 10 feet from the garbage can basketball free throw way. yeah.  Hey Emily, want an eggshell sculpture?

      right, anyway...so i started writing this with the intention of getting onto talking about how i was planning to do some constructive stuff today but i didnt get much done... and how i wanted to make a list of things to ask in truth or consequences... and how i wanted to make a list of things for dicussion. so that when im talking so someone and we hit a point where theres nothing to say, i can pull out my list and start an interesting, intellectual or philosophical or...whatever it ends up disucssion. just...a real conversation. so i was on this website looking at topics people had discussed (some supposed intellecual discussion board) and one of them was the meaning of life...surprise, surprise...cliche, cliche. anyway. so i was reading it and i was thinking about what heather told me about xia and what some hedonists (dorian again for everybody) and some nonhedonists, good ol fashioned americans think about life- that you should just do what makes you happy and not worry so much about making a difference in the world or being the best person you can be or helping other people or anything-jus tdo what makes you happy, they say. we just...exist. make the most of the time youve got. use it to do what you can to be happy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now to a certain extent, ive thought about this before and hes right... all any human wants is happiness, and all any human ever does is towards achieving this goal. sometimes this is the selfish kind of happiness...the "ill rape this woman because shes beautiful and it would make me happy to have sex with her" kind of thing... which is what i tend to think of when people tell me the meaning of life is to be happy...theres the "im gonna do cocaine because it makes me feel good which makes me happy" thing.  but then theres also... "im going to go feed the homeless"-alright. go, feed the homeless. thats good. but why are you feeding the homeless? isnt it ultimately because you enjoy helping other people? because it makes you happy? and would you still help them if you didnt get any satisfaction out of it? and what if you, like me, look to love as an answer to that question-what am i living for? love is a respectable answer. "all you need is love..." but, in the end, why do we want love? because it makes us feel good! and when i was thinking about all this it kinda bothered me...because it made me think about humans as so selfish...that no matter how hard you want to do things for other people and be a good person-youre still really only doing everything for yourself. but then...i dunno...thats crazy. for one thing, God wants people to be happy, right? theres nothing wrong with being happy at all! do what makes you happy. but...you know...do that while still abiding by your principles and what not. though the subjectivity of morals is another discussion topic entirely. (perhaps i should start my own disucssion forum. who would disucss though? i would. pang? maybe? olivia? maybe? i wonder if people would...hmmm...) i dunno... i basically decided that it wasnt wrong to want to be happy, to be truly, comfortably happy. and that kind of happiness, im positive, only comes from leading a good life...thats the love kind of happiness and the helping others kind of happiness. much more real than the drug happiness and the sex happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but anyway, i still digress...i was thinking about that, right? but then i still disagre that the meaning of life is just to do what makes you happy...at least not in the way most people mean it. because you need more in life than just happy feelings. you need real happiness...which is not just happy feelings...but feeling that your life has meaning and that you matter and that youve made a difference..a.nd..i dunno, its hard to describe what i mean, but theres more to life than just feeling happy. even though, by my deffinition real, true happiness is an okay thing to live for, because, even though its contradictory, real, true happiness isnt soley happiness...its happiness and other things. sort of.  but...well...anyway. to those who say that the meaning of life is to do what makes you happy, i have a question for you: If you could plug yourself into a machine that would make yourself happy, would you? (if it hypothetically existed?) Would you be satisfied, at the end of your life, knowing you had lived entirely for this feeling? would you feel your life was worthwile? would you, ultimately, be happy? would that make life everything you wanted?

      so i was thinking that my vacations are always such a waste of time cause i never do anything. this particular type of vacation, anyway. where i go down and stay in arizona and do nothing but play xbox and go to the mall and swim and wait for people to get online. and i guess it is a vacation...because im letting myself forget the stress of normal life...nonlinving in place of living...which is a vacation, no? but do i really enjoy it? i dunno... its alright. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ive said before, time and time again, to myself and to friends, that i dislike traveling all the time whenever we get time off from school because, in my mind, a vacation from my normal school life would be a time where i could not stress out about projects and work and stuff and take some time to reward myself for working hard by giving myself more of  the things i never get enough of normally: sleep and friends. because school life is good but what would make it perfect would be more sleep and more contact with my friends.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think what i want my life to be centered around is my relationships with other people... because a single person is so much more interesting than any class at school. i have so much reverence for the complexity, individuality and... inante goodness of all people. and the fact that everyone has something unique and amazing about them totally specific to only them. i dunno. i just love all that.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which  is, im sure, why i annoy the hell out of emily trying to ask her all these crazy questions...wanting to learn everything...wanting a complete picture of a human soul... but why e- makes her seem like the glorified subject of a portrait or something, doesnt it? that cant be all there is to this craziness... because there is not just curiosity and reverence... there are those damned emotions... and there is friendship. and how does that change things? well, i dunno... whoevers reading this probably donest even really understand what im talking about, and thats okay...because im tired and im not explaining too well...but i think it all comes down to the soul in general. and allthat it is. and all that it is not. whatd you ask me that one time, pang? what draws me? the soul. and why this particular one?  well, to be both poetic and disrespectful... i caught a taste of it once...and it was pretty damn intoxicating.  something like that.  mmm, pictures...painitngs..reminds me of dorian gray. cringe. never finished reading that...i expect ill like it. bit too complicated for me during the school year while i have other thigns to worry about, though. the whole dorian thing mightve been the reason i wrote that leonard poem... i mean, its not based on the book, obvisouly, but...got me thinking.  mmm, ill continue this post in another post because i digressed so much that this should be separate.

      Friends...cant live with 'em, cant live without 'em.  They'll drive you crazy, squeeze so many tears from unwilling eyes that the body shrivels up entirely-from the inside-out. They insane you. no kidding.  'course, without friends, what meaning would my life have? thats a scary question...  bah! you kill me, you kill me...  is it so much to want to...i guess "bond" with one of your friends? Is it so much to want to actually disucss an idea instead of the usual monotony? is it so much to expect that maybe you could have some sort of fulfilling conversation worth remembering, instead of...of, i dunno, just getting what little contact you need to maintain in order to keep from going psycho? What if your soul is hungry, dammit! What if you hate these two weeks and you want to lose yourself in philosophy? in comprehension of another's spirit? what.... why cant i have the kind of conversations that are actually good for me? intellectual analyzation of life? i can talk to myself all i want, but... its not the same.  oh, i wish i didnt get so many "i dunno"s. i really do. take a moment to think, will you? Why wont you  talk  to me, God dammit? Why does this all have to die? I want to understand you! i really do! i sincerely do! and i can ask and ask and ask but it does no good at all if you arent gonna answer. its hard if you learn more about you if you arent willing to give me a hand...  maybe thats what i want for Christmas... not exactly something i can tell my mom though. well, i can hope, right? eh, its useless to refer to all this indirectly but i dont feel like being obvious, so screw you, jessica. and anyone else who happens to ever read this.   i dunno, i dunno, i dunno... i worry too much.

      i always forget how much i love Alanis Morissette. Some people hate her for being so whiny and complainy and all that, but... a lot of her songs just kick ass. Like "You Outta Know" and "Head Over Feet" and "21 Things" and... i dunno, lots more. "Jagged Little Pill" is one of the best CDs. Go feminist rock! wooot.      "Head over Feet" was one of my favorite songs when i was a kid too. like in 4th grade. i dunno...ive just always liked that song. its great.  ...the kinds of things that influence my conception of love... crazy.      "Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are / I couldn't help it / It's all your fault" thats the best. Something id think, too... haha, blaming people for things like that... mmm. :-). "i love you for all that you are" thats good too. "for all that you are." nice. cause its not just "i love you" its..."i love every part of you" thats great, man. great.      "You are the bearer of unconditional things"that too. i love the wording of that. its cool. "unconditional things"...haha, love!      "I've never felt this healthy before / I've never wanted something rational / I am aware now"...thats good too. cause...  its that "im in love and everything seems to make sense now!" kind of thing. which is nice. i dunno. im just kind of rambling now.... lalaladadi.   and " 'Good-night my---' he stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me." i love that part. thats the best part of the whole book. poor rochester!   im in such a randomly good mood.  wow, i really need to do my homework....really really really.

      home from fencing. am tired. am sick. waaaaaaaaaay too much work/homework to do this weekend. toooooo many projects. im gonna die.  die . and emilys at erics now so i dont even get that bit of peace. perhaps tomorrow.   heres hoping i dont suck entirely at maine west tomorrow. yay. go fencing. woo...woo...yeah...  fun times with the breast protectors! oh yeah!  what else? oh, im gonna get us chem shirts at the end of the year. Here's the link:  urlLink    Chemistry Power!  yeah, so, michele,....well intentioned as she might be... that reassures me not one bit. Its not that im afraid it will be regreted...im sure if it happens, it will be...for the right reasons. something like that. but i dont know how im gonna accept that if it does happen...even if it wasn't in...a bad kinda way. i still dont know how im gonna accept it. Not that it makes you a slut or whatever if you do, cause...yeah...definitely not. i just...i dont want it to. i really dont want it to. and the likelyhood is that it will not happen.... but im not sure that it wont happen. and i cant be certain anymore now... it was a relief before to know it hadnt yet... i suppose i should just ask... bah. why is the whole thing such a big deal to me? i dont know! i wish i knew! maybe we should talk about it... ha. like we ever end up talking about anything i decide we should talk about. too many "i dunnos"...damn her. okay, anyway, enough thinking about that. my worrying wont change whatever happens right now. so ill just hope.  i want to talk though. real talk. i need some of that.  real  talk. like...intellectual conversation. philosophy. soul proding. haha, soul proding..well, i mean...learning things about the other person...below surface layer things. you know? i need some of that. i never get enough of that. can you ever get enough of that? i dunno... i dunno...  i need a boyfriend too. id take one of those... itd be worth it just to have something else to think about all the time. instead of constantly worrying about lots of different things...like i do now! well, at least its better now than it was...man, i was so f**king crazy earlier this year. im so glad thats over. that was horrible.  seriously  horrible. i never wanna do that again. but...i guess...ill have to. wont i? track starts soon... 5 aps next year. and field hockey. and marching band. and pit. :-/. im never gonna see...sigh...why did i have to pick such a masochistic one? damn! damndamndamn.   see? look. im worrying again. and...now...im worrying about college...just like i was earlier...sigh...its the car. i want a car in college. then, at least....or maybe i could live with public trans...well, nah. if only we lived in europe....  anyway, i need sleep so i should go now.  goodnight all.

      "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."  -- George Bernard Shaw  i think that makes me unreasonable.   i dotn care though. some of the greatest men were unreasonable. no f**king way im going to "adapt myself" to some of the things the world throws at me. no, i refuse to adapt. if you want something bad enough, you cant allow yourself to adapt. you cant give in. and ill be damnned if i give up anytime soon.   g...ahh. im so...frustrated with this right now. i dont want to be angry though, i really really dont want to be angry. and i dont want to yell at anyone... i dont want to be afraid. but im so scared. and i hurt. and i... i want my friend back! what happened to my friend?  i dont feel good. im thinking irrational things too. caitlin made some comment this morning about her changing too much...and all i could think was "i know! stop changing!" and then i said something like "maybe if i just grap her and shake some sense into her" *hand motion of me vigorously shaking an imaginary person by the shoulders* caitlin "What???" me, realizing im being senselessly violent in my frustration, "oh, God, what am i even doing?" i dont want to hurt anyone...  ahhh, this whole thing f**king sucks.  f**king sucks  f**king sucks so much you go mad and hate the world for being unforgiving and suspect people you love dearly of being mean on purpose and...ah, God. i hate this. i just... it hurts.  it hurts because i miss the..."feeling necessary" (to be topical)...and because i want sooooo badly to be close... and because i feel so defeated... and because im asking for help and getting nothing... and because im paranoid looking for signs that its going downhill... and because i have to watch other people get closer as i slip away. it, just... it f**king hurts.  and thats why im broken and bitter and unhappy. and i dont know what to do about it because i definitely dotn want a replacement...and im trying to do constructive things...but...sigh. i dont know what to f**king do...  its killing me. everyone knows it. im back to the pre-sleepover craziness. its just fact. if i go too long without having a nice long period of time to actually talk to her, i go crazy. huzzah for going crazy. because its sooooo f**king fun.   ohohohohooo....i hate this i hate this ihatethisihatethisihatethis. i dont like to use the f word, but...man... f**k. f**k the world for tearing from me just about the only thing i ever really really cared about. life can go f**k itself.   i dont know. maybe i shouldnt care so much about a few stupid emails. why does it bother me so mcuh? i just wish we talked more... and the fact that ive asked her repeatedly and explicitly told her i really wanted email... and now im having other people tell her...and i still have no email. i mean...how can you ignore that? its not cool. all i want is an effort at communication. thats not a hell of a lot, is it? and i dont know... ever since i realized she hasnt emailed me in an entire month its just like "so this is what your friendship is now. well, thats just f**king swell."  watching yourself grow apart from the person you love more than anyone else and watching other people get closer and fighting as hard as you can to stay up there, to stay close, to stay important...but watching the distance grow anyway. that. that f**king hurts like nothing else i know.  "This is where I say I've had enough And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises And I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any better.  Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful thing" -Saints and Sailors, Dashboard Confessional.

      you know, maybe a lot of this ranting and complaining and all things i put on here that i normally wouldnt tell people i just a way of like...well, i was thinking about changing the tagline to "things i have to say otherwise ill explode" or a variant. because... well, once michele told me i needed to talk to a social worker and verablly tell my story and explain why i dislike sophmore year so much because just telling someone would make me feel better...but there was no way in hell i was gonna do that, so i guess thats part of it... why i have this. because otherwise id drive my friends crazy with complaining and wanting help and stuff.  i still need to complain to actual people sometimes though. like heather today. in retrospect, i probably shouldntve said anything because i dont want her to feel like she has to give me solutions... but... i dont know. sometimes one of the reasons i feel like complaining to real people is just so i can varify that in fact i am not crazy and that these are commonly held morals and its right to suffer for what i believe in or...you know, stuff like that. to varify that the world is just mean and its not me whos a misfit. well, actually i am a misfit. but... a righteous one? eh, whatever.   i suppose this is not a revelation as we all know we ranting makes us feel better.   but i was just wondering why itd be so hard to stop making this so personal...because i probably should, but itd be hard... maybe if emily emails me more i will start dealing with these things by emailing her instead of blogging so much. maybe this blogging crap is a replacement email. hmm... id rather have the emails. confirms my thoughts that my emails are like my dairy entires too.   well, anyway. thats my justification for why im not going to stop with the personal stuff (unless i get back in the email habbit, which i guess is possible if anythings possible...0 this month though. like i said. so things arent looking good.)...because if i do, then i lose an outlet for ranting and then ill have to go to real people which has more potential for damage to relationships and stuff... at leats no one reads this very often, right? sure. so, in a nutshell...im still gonna talk about everything i want to because: if i dont, ill explode.  im already on the verge of explosion from many other things...so lets not test me.   explode...die...break my heart...go crazy...be sad. those are all things i say and they mean the same thing. "do this or ill explode" or "if you dont do this i will be sad" thats the same thing, really. for future reference.  anyway, really need to get to bed. in class essay tomorrow. *loud gulp*  night.

      (quoting from her profile) yellowfuzz13:  Those who care about you are supposed to know what's written on your heart.   what if you really care about someone but you dont know them as well as you used to and its hard to know those kinds of things? JuMP1115: supposed to know yellowfuzz13: supposed to's arent very forgiving JuMP1115: you worry way too much  even julie thinks so! i guess thats comforting...in a way.  but then again... you know what i realized today? i havent gotten any emails from her in a whole month. an entire month without emails. look what my life has become. and just out of curiosity, i counted the number of emails i got from her during july before freshman year. want to know how many? 148. 148 versus 0. huzzah for sophomore year.

      i was thinking about trying out livejournal... so i went to go make an account, right? but its stupid and wont let me do it for some reason. for one thing, it says your password has to be a dictionary word. thats unfair. a password is harder to guess if it isnt a word. and i use the same password for a lot of things. and it isnt a word. so i have to pick a new one. i do. apparently its not a word. i cant find any password that are words. apple isnt a word. oh, and it doesnt want to let me use "yellowfuzz13" as my name because its over 15 characters and contains letters that arent a-z and it contains numbers that arent 0-9. right. i gave up. obviously God does not want me to have a livejournal.  i should really be doing my homework. but im lazy and i dont feel like it. so...im not.  emily got her license yesterday. yay for emily.  might  drive over to see me today for a few minutes. "we'll see." dont know if thats more of a maybe or a no. but, hey, it is on the way home from lauries. (and why is laurie so special? no...dont want to ask that...probably no reason. im just paranoid.) so that could be a nice break from homework. im hoping for it, though i dont know how likely it is.   i ordered girl scout cookies from heather today. apparently all together my family has ordered 15 boxes. 15! seems like a lot. i guess theyll go quickly, though. have ordered from heather, michele, and my moms pto friend's daughter. irked me when michele said something innocently enough but with an impied statement of "you only bought cookies from heather last year, dont forget im selling them too. youre my friend too. my neighbor too. its not fair." blah blah blah... of course shes not that mean, but i know she meant to make me feel guilty or something. in an innocent sort of way. bah! human interaction. crazy. reminds me of that thing on julies profile:  Why do we speak in songs?  she asked, and my only response was to shrug and remind her that often it is easier to take words from others, let others speak that which is in our hearts.  But who is willing to bend his emotions to those of someone else? she asked.  All of us and none of us, I said.  We wish for people to read between the lines.  Subtext, she exclaimed.  In a way, I said.  Those who care about you are supposed to know what's written on your heart.  interesting, no? [sadness alert] mmm, but... what if, try as you may, you dont know everything about those you care about? and its hard to read their heart? not for lack of trying... sigh. i wish i was better at knowing what people really mean when they say things. or what they really mean when they do things. what they truly feel and think. and ive taken to just asking sometimes. but hten i get "i dunnos" which is bad cause, hell, what else am i supposed to do if you wont tell me and i cant figure it out myself? but then again, maybe im just trying to read into things too much and theres really nothing of any significance thought and felt but unsaid. in which case we can just conclude that i worry too much and should calm down and enjoy life and what happiness it gives me instead of making myself unhappy thinking about the happiness it wont give me and how much i want it. or something. i dont know. you can word that differently so that it sounds like either side is a good option. i could say what i just said, which makes it sound like im crazy for killing myself over something i should just forget about. or i could something to the effect of its crazy for me to give up and stop trying to acheive something i want so much, so...passionately, because just the fact that i want to keep trying is worth something, and i know i could give up and make life easier, but i dont want to because its so important to me, and isnt that sort of honorable? to sacrifice happiness for...ideals? sort of? or something? you know what i mean? yeah. i know exactly what i mean...  "Big Balls" by ACDC is a good song. funny. now thats one long double entendre.  i think ive decided for certain that im not goign to turnabout. for myriad reasons. and there is, in fact, heatherandmichele weirdness as i suspected there would be. which, before anything else, makes me feel bad for emily. who shouldnt have to deal with that. emily who just wanted people to go with her and eric to turnabout. maybe it wont be a big deal and no one will get mad or anything. thatd be nice. but thast one of the reasons i didnt want to go. i dont want to deal with that. because even if it doesnt bother emily, itd bother me. me who worries too much.       and then there are a million other reasons why i dont want to go. well, as i told martha who is/has been bothering me about this. (and is a (if not  the ) source of the michele problems...which annoys me)  martha:  kara:  just because she doesn't have a date doesn't mean she can't come...we can just have some extras...a lot of groups have that me: i know that. i just...the reasons for going arent tipping the scale when i try to weigh them with the reasons for not going martha: :-( me: and this michele thing...doesnt motivate me. Martha: what would motivate u?? me: i dont know me: if i had a guy i wanted to go with...who wanted to go wtih me... and if i would get to talk to emily lots without awkward eric-ness... and if i didnt have to deal with anit-michele (and heather) weirdness... and if i didnt have to dislike any band friends...and if caitlin was going... and if jessica was going... and if i had a dress i wanted to wear...and... if all the guys we were going with got along well... and... i dont know. stuff. me: probably more. Martha: ya me: if you can solve all of those problems for me, id probably go. me: but good luck with that.  those are some of the reasons i dont want to go. yes, some of them are vague. some actually less vague than i originally intented them to be. but thats why i dont want to go in a nutshell. two main reasons: 1. no guy. 2. although i may see emily, i dont think it will be a comforting "yay, we ARE good and happy friends! why do i worry?" kind of thing. i fear it may be the reverse, which is to be avoided at all costs if i value my sanity. and maybe that makes me a coward or means im avoiding the problem, or something. but oh well. maybe it means nothign and there is no problem and im just worrying too much. maybe thats it!  or maybe im crazy and paranoid and need medication or something. always a possibility...  though ive always thought i wouldnt want medication if they gave me medication to make me sane. i dont trust people screwing with my thoughts and my emotions and my reality. its all i have that no one can take away from me. and its all that is me, really. they cant mess with who i am. never.  mm, arguing morality with martha again. reminicent of the "love" conversation. mmm, never should have started that one... although... all this anti-michele business from the girl who said money can buy love. i dont get her. shes a good kid, i know it...but...i just dont completely get her. i wonder if i still get emily? mmm, i hope so. maybe i can again.  i tried making an omlette for breakfast/lunch. it came out kinda badly. tasted okay but it was a little too liquidy for my tastes. i always have that problem with omlettes...the inside part doestn cook all the way through. oh, and another problem i have is putting what physically are too many ingredients...though as far as taste goes, its usually dead on. crazy omlettles. my hand still smell like onions.  i think maybe ive been thinking too much today...maybe its a sign that i shouldnt give myself so much free time. though its good to think, right? sure...  ooh, now this conversation is deep. im probably making her sad and confused, actually. at least i hope im not. criticizing her philosophy on life...her lack of motivation for trying...and wondering if this is because she doesnt have a good reason for living...you know how everyone needs something to work towards to get up in the mroning? to make the bad days worth it? all taht....yeah... thats what were talking about now. depressing if youre just realizing these things and they shock you...which i dont think im doing to her, but...well, lets hope not. eh, i dont think i am. martha: u said the if u have nothing to work towards then ur life isnt fulfilling...so why does it have to be fulfilling??  sigh... some people i just dont get.   i feel like chinese food. i need to do my homework. i need to listen to some cool music. ive been blogging too long. i wish emily checked her email more often and actually sent me more email. that would make me happier. among other things. i wonder how it feels to know simple things like that...or just your actions in general affect another persons mood so profoudnly. i wonder if its overwhelming. i wonder if she even realizes it.  i decide today that i really want to be able to make people feel guilty. i want to know how to word things so delicately that they sound like an innocent comment but really they kindle a fire of guilt in the back of the mind...and then you drop little comments here and there...and the fire grows...and grows...and... maybe its cruel...it probably is. but sometimes i just want people to know how they should feel. like, dammit, that hurt, you dont feel guilty but you should! you know? ah, i dunno. i shouldnt wish things like this.  i wish...*closes eyes*... i wish...if you know me well at all, you know what i just wished for.  ha...and if you dont know me: its not a guy, its not money, its not my license, its not a grade, its not...anything matieral or stupid.  although...as someone wise once said, "i wish: for trivial things, i pray for everything else" or something like that. right? perhaps i shouldnt wish for something so important.  im going to get a cookie.  by the way, who all is reading my blog now? should i stop talking about emily? originally no one read this at all and i didnt talk about people or school...just...ideas. but now its more of a real blog for me. and apparently several people read it now...and jessica i dont care about so much cause she knows me and the people i tend to talk about well enough not to take anything the wrong way or anything. not that i dont trust my other friends who raed this, but... bah. i dunno. dont go crazy or think me insane over things i write. or think the people i write about are insane. or something. wow, i could have written this much more eloquently if i had more time and wasnt as distracted. oh well. basically: some of this is my private life you wouldnt normally hear about, i dont always freely tell anyone everything written on my heart, and maybe theres a reason for that. so keep that in mind while reading.

      haha. and the porn music inside joke is born. ah, how i long for an awkward pause... or a poorly worded phrase. muh ha ha ha ha ha.  did nothing at fencing today. score. i hate when they make us fence the guys...i dunno what it is about it...but i just dont like it.   so far i do not like drivers ed. am afraid i will fail this class/test...and then im gonna hit someone and die...or kill the passengers...which is worse. ahhhh. scary.  and i leanred my counselor (or however you spell that...it always looks wrong no matter how i spell it) is stupid and doesnt know the rules of shs. cause i know them better than he does. idiot man. Smith. what kind of name is Smith anyway? have some individuality! some identity! eh...lets hope he knows who he is... unlike mr. whats his name in our english book. poor guy. i feel bad for people who are confused as to who they are. but i guess we are all wondering that to some extent....especially teenagers. this is when were really finding out who we are, right? sure... i think i know who i am for the most part. except for the parts of me that i have not yet had much experience with. if i can say that and not sound like i have another meaning or am crazy. I know whats important to me though. And...ive thought about the whole "what is a person?" thing...how the hell do you define a person? what am i? not "omg, i dont understand who i am!" but...more like...how does one go about defining himself anyway... and i decided on my own fairly suitable answer and im working towards it and all that good thinking crap. i think a lot. about real kinds of things. like that. perhaps i think too much. thats why i worry too much. cause i dont like to ignore my problems. they bother me. make me feel guilty. i hate feeling guilty. its one of the worst feelings. but by far one of the worst feelings ever [bitterness alert] is when you want something with all your heart and soul and you see no cosmic reason why you should be denied of it (no "maybe i deserve to not get this...." kinds of thoughts)...and you know that nothing but good- and when i say that i mean... you will come out a better person, a more devout (if were talking God) person, a more whole person, a more moral person... and you will be doing something to better the world (either on a large scale or a small scale)- and youre working towards getting that... and youre doing everything you can think of, everything you can physically do, everything you understand that you must do...trying to acheive this... get this thing you want so badly... and you keep hitting walls... where fate...where..."the way things have to be"...where the world gets in the way. and these walls are preventing you from getting what you want, and try as you can, with all your heart and soul...you cant come up with good ways around them. so youre stuck. willing to do whatever you can, trying, still, to come up with any solutions youve got....as to how to get what you want... but nothing works and you just feel helpless...and you refuse to believe theres nothing you can do to work towards getting it...because you dont understand why it should ever be that you dont deserve to have it. you dont understand what cosmic, right, just reason tehre is that you should die without ever having it. (as i said befcore, nothing but good will come of this. if anything, the cosmos should be helping you get it) so you think there has to be a way. there has to be some way. somet thing you can do. and youve just got nothing. and you wont let yourself give up because its so important to you, and becaus eyou know youll regret it if you do. now, that...that is a horrible feeling. when youre trying your hardest for something you want so badly and for something that for no reason should be kept from you...and your hardest, your best effort...just isnt cutting it. that hurts. i had a question iw as asking people a long time ago which was "if you try your hardest at something, can you still fail?"...and i meant this kind of thing. and...i dunno...i guess you shouldnt fail. you dont deserve to fail. but do you ever fail? can you fail? i dont know. physically, i guess... and thats sad. but you never really fail in that true failure would be when you stop trying. something like that. anyway. rant over. as usual, moral of the story: lack of contact with emily sucks.  i like our Danton movie. dont know why. barely understand it.  get to take the spanish final tomorrow. heard its easy. got a 100% on my asessment alternativo or whatever. so no worries.  chem on friday though... and i dont know chem so well. mmm... ill bum some facts for my card off of emily and heather and kelly and lauren at lunch. methinks.  and euro! God, i think im gonna fail euro... the final... and this dbq business...and the french rev i really need to review cause im confused now because of this movie... and... ap exam in may...yikes. crazy crazy crazy euro. it will be the death of me.  no, what will actually be the death of me is too little emily. but for now, those things are good, and i will spare you the bitter comments*. because i sit next to her in english! score! woooooot! huzzah.  though she should get online more...id be really pissed if i didnt sit next to her in enlish...which is probably why i sit next to her in english...just to give me the little contact i need to keep from going crazy. far be it for fate to give me that and some occasional aim-ige. no, thatd be too nice. [bitterness altert] we dont want to spoil amanda, now do we? stupid fate. i hate you.  but im okay. english is nice. i am thankful. thankful that she changed our seats again. thankful that perhaps the higher power does care about my mental/emotional sanity. i could never deside if lack of emily craziness was a mental insanity or an emotional insanity. youd think itd be emotional...but then that affects the mental part. but it seems too cold to say its only mental... because i dont feel with my brain, now do i? i refuse to give too much credit to the brain for love. and all subsequent feelings and emotions. it comes from the heart man. the heart and soul. not the goddam brain. the brain is for thinking. thinking and feeling are completely different. though sometimes you can think and feel the same thing.  haha. want to hear my metaphor for euro? (screenames omitted for security reasons)  Michele:  euro is a combination of horrid and wonderful Me: yeah Me: like chocolate cake with a layer of monkey feces Michele: so totally true Me: and you dont get any silverware Me: and the plates they give you are really flimsy paper ones Michele: hehe Michele: so totally true Me: and they give you a huge thing of it and tell you you cant leave till you eat it all Me: even the feces Me: and then youre just locked in a room  Michele: it's a wealth of info covered by a random teacher... Me: with no silverware Me: and flimsy paper plates Me: and chocolate cake Me: and ape excrement Michele: ok ur done Me: and some sadistic officer of cake-eating Michele: lol Me: possibly a chair or table of some sort Michele: lol Me: but if there was a chair or a table...it would be for the cake or the officer of cake-eating. not for you. you wouldnt get one. Me: also there would be no ceiling Me: only cold air Michele: amanda. Me: so youd be like "oh great... Me: " Me: but then there would still be cake Michele: ur imagination is running away with u. Me: well the original cake with monkey feces just didnt have enough evil in it Me: i had to add some  haha. im so funny.  oh, so, i was at the party store Monday cause my mom wanted to stop after i was done at the dentist and get some stuff for some party shes having later this week... and i saw all the cute little valentines and im wondeirng 'so what will i do for valentines day this year?' because i totally slacked off on Christmas. and the only person i've gotten anything real for birthdays is emily... well... i suppose that is expected, right? so i can get away with the birthday thing. unless i get invited to parties of course, in which case there will be present buying. but anyway. i decided i want to give my friends valentines but i missed the ordering from the cool valentines cataloge cause my mom did that last week and i was busy and she asked me but i said "ill do it later" and never did so now i cant do that... so my options are to make valentines or print them or buy some. the ones you buy at the grocery store suck. (oh, or i could just give candy...which i did last year. not a bad option...but since im making up for Vhristmas here...) and when i think of making my own i think doiles and rubber stamps and elmers glue. *shudder* but then i realized i could combine my affinity for making crude stick-like drawings in crayon or water colors with valentines day! ha-ho-haha! (victorious laugh) so think ill make little heart valentines on note-book paper and draw pictures and make up stupid sayings or poetry or whatever and sign my name and each will be special and theyll be awesome. so. totally. awesome.  eee. fun funess for me. i excite.   why am i in such a good mood? i have homework to do... and a final to take tomorrow.   must be the emily in english. maybe this will be a good 6 weeks.   ooh, and then we get to pick our seats after that... so.... perhaps a whole semester of emily? dare i hope? *crosses fingers*  mmm, i should stop crossing my fingers though. that doesnt seem to work. like my prayer box. [bitterness alert] no good prayerbox.    though then am i any better than those people who insist certain gestures or objects are lucky just cause they did them once before a test or something and then they got 100? following that logic, if i sleep 1 hour every night... i should always ace every test! ha... or not. stupid people and their luck. *glances guilty at ankle* well...its not like thats really lucky anyway. its more of a symbol of my crazy deditation. cause im crazy dedicated to things i believe in/for/am passionate about. stuff like that.  wow, needs to dos my homework now. night.  its increidbly thereputic to rant about my day on my blog though. and although some people are always like "why do i have a blog, no one wants to read about my boring life..." A. my life isnt  that  boring. therse all the crazy emily drama. thats kind of interesting...no? sometimes i rant about real things. things that dont just pertain to my life. sometimes i have comedic value. and B. screw you people. i keep this for me. not to entertain. because im too lazy for a diary. ive tried. though this does lack that privacy...eh...oh well. as long as not too many people read this. which i dont think they do. anyway. for me. so i can rant and vent and denounce and endorse and...thank. and...condemn. i guess condemn is like denounce. well, anyway. sorry that this is mostly complaining. there are some good things though.  maybe every time i post...that same day i should make sure i post a positive comment. doenst have to be related...just so im saying something positiv eeach day.   wow, now i really am sounding crazy. time for work.  lets see if i can do this math...  *haha, a whole big long post with only 3! one was pretty big though... but at least i tried to make it a little general. eh.

      yeah, so i typed up this whole big, long thing and it got deleted. :-(  here were the lighlights:  i wasnt excited about today because i was bothered about the no-emily business.  ha, and mr. pasch doesnt know my name. doesnt really matter to me, just kinda funny... well, not a good sign if i wanna be all obsessed about that. but i dont want to be. it just amused me.  yeah, so day was nog so good...but then...  we got new seats in enligh and even though i contained my enthusiasm today...this rocks. amanda gets to sit next to emily now! woot! extreme goodness there. perhaps the world is not screwing me over as much as i assumed it to be. or perhaps it is screwing me over very much and someone nice and big and powerful and merciful is interfering and adjusting things to my favor so i dont die.  yeah, so then i was in a better mood...and my day was good.  and i suppose it was good until fencing.  although talking to teachers about final make ups wasnt funny. oh, and drivers ed seems unfun and a little scary.  and my parents better get the new car soon if they want me to stay away from their cars.  and then i talked to kaiely which was nice cause i dont get to talk to her very often anymore.  yeah, so then fencing...which was okay in itself, but... the bathroom thing. and im incredibly paranoid now. and scared. and guilty. and cowardly. and i guess i shouldnt  be... if they want to give me detention or saturday school for "go pats" then i guess whatever, maybe i deserve it.... after all, we cant be teenagers and do little crazy things like that in highschool. ill be mad if they kill me, only cause its stupid for me to get a mark on my record for something as unimportant as this... and because my parents will be pissed. but.. i dunno. i guess ill tell them what they want if they call me in in question me or wahtever. erg. im nervous and guilty now. im gonna be avoiding the security guide's eyes for weeks and weeks. and its crazy. bah. guilt for me. maybe i deserve it... whatever. i dislike stevenson.  so now its not such a good day.  and i realized emily has consortium so no chance of talking to her tonight, probably.  at least i dont have a crazy amount of homework. i have finals i should be studying for though. stupid finals.  hmm... perhaps life really doesnt want me happy? oh, whatever. im gonna go finish watching gilmore girls and finish my homework and then stay up at least till 10:00 and then sleep.  what to do in study hall tomorrow... oooh, maybe ill write? fun fun. i never write. dunno what id write about.   ooooh, i forgot the other unpleasantness: my moms mad at me for having to drive me in early thursday and friday so i can take finals.   anyway, night.

      wanted emily to sleep over today. we all knew that. she has her little party thing with caitlin and rhidi (sp?) today and told me she didnt think she could. but... f**k that. ive waited since winter break and before that...the waiting is crazy....im not gonna let a stupid party ruin my plans. shes gonna come sleep over after her party. so she may be a little late, oh well. ill talke what i can get. she was supposed to call me when she found out how long she was gonna be at this party...but then my familys all like "youre only getting dinner and lunch if you come out right now to eat with us" so i have to go, right? yeah, she calls while im gone and doesnt leave a message and i call when i get back but no one answers so i assume shes at this party...so now im in a great position. i get to wait until she gets home and she calls me or gets online (or comes back from being away, actually) and i have no idea when that'll be. homefully any minute now. (hint, hint, emily...) but every minute that goes by is a minute later she'll come over...or, more accurately, i fear...every minute is another reason why she shouldnt sleep over. who comes to sleep over at 10:00, right? she knows (or should know) that the later she comes over, the later im gonna want to keep her up. but, oh, i keep hoping in vain... pleasepleasepleaseplease  ahhhh. this is the stuff that drives me crazy...the hoping in vain and the let down after the hope is gone.. and... ahhh, i hate it. it makes me feel like...well, i get this image if an inflatable clown dummy that someone just keeps punching like a punching bag and the clown just keeps coming back each time....just to get punched in the face again. its kinda like that. and i wish it wasnt. makes me wanna scream that i hate the world...in that stupid teeanger way. and im not a stupid teenager, i just...i just want my friend. is that so much to ask for? dont i deserve it?  anyone who reads this...come on...dont i deserve to see emily more often? doesnt it drive me crazy when i never get to see her...never get to talk to her? cant i just get what i want? what ill comes of it? i just want to see my friend! dont i deserve that?  ahhh.  lets hope she calls/gets online soon.  pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease *crossing fingers*

      Auto response from Amasochisticsock: "Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." 1 Corinthians 13:4-7  Auto response from SweetMnM111: "Love never fails." 1 Corinthians 13:8  she often has that away message but i felt like...complimenting it...I'm so cool. :-)  haha, i love this movie!!

      Yesterday, around...4 o'clock i start feeling really cold, right? and i figure its just the whether and stuff...so i get my sweatshirt...and then i feel really hot so i have to take it off...and i keep varrying in temperatures. All this while trying to do my fmp apps which i totally forgot about until yestereday...and trying to do them as fast as i can because i still have 3 possible english in class essays to prep for. And then i realize i have to go to confirmation class-i'd skip it, but i dont have time to make it up later. At confirmation, i realize im incredibly freakin' cold and i start to fear the worst--am i sick? The night before an in-class essay? The night before the only day to turn in fmp apps? The week of finals? Oh crap! So i get home and i take my temperature--100.3. Holy Shit! Nooooooo! Well, i know i cant go to bed yet cause i have a ton of work to finish, so i take an advil and keep working until im done with fmp and 2 essay preps-at about 1:00. All this while shivering my ass off and trying really hard to concentrate...My fever goes up too...bouncing up and down between 101.2 and 103.0 (a good majority of the time it was 102.3 though). I decide i'll get up early-5:00 to finish my essay preps...can i probably do at least a whole one in an hour, right? And maybe it's okay if i only get 3 done, because the chances that she'll pick the two i dont do are 1/20 and the two i would have chosen not do do are very similar...i figure my english teacher isn't gonna pick both of those because all of her essays would be the almost the same. So i get up at 5:00 and start working...having not been able to sleep very well because i kept waking up shivering... i get about halfway through one of my essay preps before my mom comes in to make sure im awake like she always does at 6:00 and she asks me how im feeling. i can't lie...i tell her i still feel awful and she makes me take my temperature again--102.5. and to tell the truth, now my stomach hurts and im coughing a lot (well, i was coughing before too). She tells me shes not going to let me go to school. I beg her...literally... to let me go...suggest maybe ill just come home after the first 2 periods (my health test and my in class essay). She refuses to allow it. she lectures me on how important my health is and how ill probably do bad on the essay if i go to school sick anyway. I really truly beg her to let me go...crying, even...because im so frustrated that i have to be sick. She tells me my teachers arent going to kill me if i miss a silly test, i can make it up later. I explain that its the end of the semester and the essay is part of my final...and finals are incredibly important...and i dont know the procedure for making up an inclass essay but im sure its very unpleasant and Ms. Voelker is going to be very angry with me. She tells me again that i cant help being sick and that my teachers are going to have to understand, picks up my fmp applications and tells me she'll give them to heather to hand in, and that theres no way shes letting me go to school. She says this one final time and leaves my room saying "Go back to bed."   Ahhh! im so pissed i have to miss this day. I mean, i am sick...but...ar!...God dammit. I dunno how im gonna make this stuff up... I guess i have free periods during finals...and no fencing after school...maybe i can do it then. But then i lose a lot of my free time...time to study. which i need. ahhh...this sucks. a hell of a lot.   how did i get sick anyway? It just appeared yesterday. Probably result of the crappy food saturday and the fact that i got no sleep the night before...and that i was really exherting myself and stuff... and my stomach did hurt for a while that day... hmmm... God dammed Culver! Why did we have to go to indiana the weekend before finals? Whyyyyyy!?!?  oh, i really hope i didnt get pang sick. *loud, nervous swallow*  *Sigh* I guess i might as well go back to bed...  i hope everyone else is having a better day than me. this sucks. this f**king sucks. and i'd better not still be sick tomorrow...cause...oh crap. this is so not good. i hate this! arrrrrr!  im so pissed right now... just so...so pissed. This is anger mostly not based on sadness, if youre wondering... unlike the anger resulting from no emily...which is entirely based on sadness. if anyone wants to know.  okay...bed.  and did i mention this sucks?

      *sigh of contented relief followed by smile* to think...i only had euro to do tonight and its 10:40 and i havent done it. haha, im such an idiot. oh well...  damn that girl and her ability to keep me from my work. well...damn her and her ability to make it seem like a far better choice to talk to her than do my homework.....which it  definitely  is.   haha...definitely. so its worth it...but...it amuses me that i can make such a decision so easily and not fear the consequences so much. lose a little sleep if i get to talk to emily? hell yes.

      Des'Ree- "You Gotta Be" (i think thats what its called)  Listen as your day unfoldes Challenge what the future holds Try and keep your head up to the sky Lovers, they may cause you tears Go ahead release your fears Stand up and be counted Don't be ashamed to cry  You gotta be You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold You gotta be wiser, you gotta be hard You gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm You gotta stay together All I know, all I know, love will save the day  Herald what your mother said Readin' the books your father read Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time  Some may have more cash than you Others take a different view my oh my heh, hey ...  (repeat)  Don't ask no questions, it goes on without you Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace The world keeps on spinning You can't stop it, if you try to This time it's danger staring you in the face oh oh oh  Remember (repeat)  My oh my heh, hey (repea, fade)   i dunno... "love will save the day" thats nice... you think it will? hmmm...  you know what else?  Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high, There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby.  Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue, And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true.  Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far Behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh why can't I?  If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Why, oh why can't I?    escapism! im gonna go live over the rainbow!  ooooooh, nvm, emilys online! woot!

      emily things dont feel cool.  i am afraid.  this doesnt particularly relate, but:  "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus." (Philippians 2.3-5)  just think about it. are you putting the needs of others before your own often enough?

      So, since i dont feel like doing my spanish essay right now...  Things ive done and enjoyed so far: -labeling people/things. jejeje. -i drew emily a spiffy picture of eric crarle's "the very hungry caterpillar" eating through my hand. it rocked my socks. even had moving parts! man, if theres a measure of love...it should be in the quality and inginuity of the childish drawings your friends make for you. ha...or not.  yellowfuzz13: little kids draw their parents pictures yellowfuzz13: why do they do that? runismylife24: because they are little  which leads me to another thing...ive realized i act very much like a child sometimes. like with this picture drawing business...and in crayon...why do i insist on crayon? very childish. and the dandelion business last year... and how i sometimes make things to give to people for no reason...and how i bring random "toys" into school to amuse me... and how i tell crazy stories sometimes... and how i want to do small things to make people happy and stuff... i dunno. its kinda like a little kid. especially the drawing though. because...its like... little kids draw their parents (or friends) pictures and give them to them as kind of like an "here, i drew a cool picture i want you to have becauise i love you." ...and...i dunno...its kinda the same idea with me, i guess... im drawing for fun, but i give them to emily cause...not cause i want to get rid of them and cause i dont want them anymore...but...cause...i dunno...its like a friendly loving thing. you know? like..."i feel like giving you something because i like you" and so you give a drawing because its somethign personal you put work into and no one else can draw exactly your picture just like you. i dunno. you know what i mean?  so then i was trying to figure out why im so childish...and my only theory at the moment has to do with unconditional love and the methods most familiar (or those i consider most appropriate) to me of expressing said emotion...but i kind of dont feel like getting into that because...thats a whole...pandora's box...can of worms...kinda thing. what unconditional love is, and how does one love someone unconditionally, and in what kind of relationships is unconditional love possible, and what "unconditional" literally means and what it implies and where friends fit in the spectrum of love and unconditional love and...yeah, i dont want to get into that. too much for me. now and...probatly not for a while if ever i do write about it. mmm, reminds me of olivia and is conversation. but anyway...  what else have i done? still havent stolen the jacket, possibly tomorrow...possibly not... still definitely havent had a sleepover...next weekend though...next weekend i hope.  oooh, watching shakespeare in love on the culver bus this weekend, that im looking forward too as well.  my friends are all failing drivers ed tests! nooo! poor them. i feel bad for them. i know they really want to drive. not just emily...i feel bad for pang too. not for heather though, passing bastard.  and caitlins verdict is still undecided. until friday!  and now for that ensayo...  maladiciones.  hasta luego. -andrea.

      So i was looking at some of my old emails today...  Wow. we used to be soooooo close. like it was a bad day if i only got 3 emails from her. I miss that... That was so nice. Can i have it back? i dunno. i dont think so... Oh well... im working at it.  I decided i  do  know a lot though. Maybe not  everything  but, a hell of a lot compared to other friends. Will start trying to learn more again as opposed to regular conversation this week. perhaps. i dunno. we'll see.  Labelmaker though. hahaha.  im just avoiding euro again...nevermind me.

      "no ones any more real than anyone else..." ha. that was funny... and i dont know why. maybe just cause i can imagine the way it was said and it reminds me of something you would say to a child telling you crazy stories.   why am i always the child?  eh, oh well... maybe not  always .  I'm Amanda, thats what i am.

      Its time to go home. im getting really annoyed with my family and i wish i had some big cool friend thing to look forward to... i guess i haver that possible emily sleepover... and heathers party...  and eventually i'll probably have a birthday "party"... planning for that might be tricky though. damn stevenson and its ways of making it really hard to have a small, tightnit group of friends you do everything with and know everything about. you got, or at least i got... friends like that from jr. high who im not as close to now as i was and as i wish i was... and then i have my new friends ive made who are my close friends now but theyre still not as close as i consider those old friends to be even though in reality theyre more so and...i dunno...the whole friends dynamic is screwed up. maybe that has something to do with my lack-of-emily craziness too.  bah. i want my friends.

      I am in the process of changing my blog template and this seems to be a rather complicated process. It make take a while. I have to tinker with it so my blog post titles are back in bold and i have to add links and stuff and i gotta get my comments back and i have to somehow get my title back. cause what is this "Unexpected Liberation" stuff. wheres my "yellowfuzz13's deep thoughts!?!" eh, oh well. its coming. it looks better now than it did an hour ago, trust me. Tell me if you like the changes. i saved my old template so i can always go back to it if i really want. i felt like shaking things up a bit, though. new year...new style. it was starting to look boring. Now i got a fancy goldfish. mmm, fancy.

      So let's hear it for  bastardasswhole  brothers who brake your laptop on new years eve about 5 minutes before midnight and try to blame you for it because the cord was in the way.  Hey, you have eyes MORON, use them.  Dont tell me its my fault because you tripped on the cord and knocked the laptop onto the hard tile floor and subsequently busted up the side of it. Its your goddamn fault.  grr...i hate brothers... sometimes i really wish i had sisters instead.  new years is an overrated holliday.  and i didnt get to talk to emily right before like last year, either. not that i expected to, but...it was nice.  so im pissed cause my laptop is broken and i didnt do anything worthwhile today and i still have a shitload of homework to do (not to mention that no one from my chem group has emailed me back yet. apparently theyre unconcerned about our presentation. bastards.) and i didnt do anything fun for new years and no ones online and have to wait like 3 weeks for emily to maybe sleepover which is the only frickin thing i even cared about doing this whole break. make that the only frickin thing i care about at all anymore. at least care a hell of a lot more about it than i do about anything else. and i probably shouldnt, but screw what i should do and fixing myself and everything.   maybe i should just stop caring about everything. period. and i woudlnt ever have to ask anyone for anything again. and that way i would never be disappointed. ever.  too bad i could never do that. sigh.  and i have no idea about who im going to bring down here when i finally get that chance again. theres the mind decision and the heart decision and there probably shouldnt be and hopefully reality will help me a bit in solving that but who the hell knows?  i was in a better mood earlier. hopefully i will be tomorrow. im going to bed.  at least i have bob. and that "just in case." some comfort there.

      yeah, so i got a livejournal thing. which i intend to use somewhat frequently. because i want a blog im not afraid to let people read. this one... i am. what with the emily business and the general candour (british style) of my rants. i dunno...i just dont want everyone reading it. you know what im talking about? of course you do. ill try to still update this one frequently, but i might be writing a lot on the other now. this one can still keep my rants though, my good ones.  so the url is: http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzysoapbox/  it wouldnt let me have the username yellowfuzz13 for whatever reason. so, since i like to get up on my soapbox... fuzzysoapbox. i dunno. just go read it. leave me comments. livejournal is all about the comments.

God, i dunno.

      I purchased this handy dandy new philosophy book last night at Barnes and Noble when i was loitering with Martha and Kara. Its one of those "the dummys guide" thigns... well, actually, the real title is,  The Complete Idiot's Guide To Understanding Ethics . well, i think most people would be on my side if i were to say im no idiot when it comes to morals, but... i was flipping through it and it had some simple explanations of many theories...which is cool. so i was reading it this morning...i read about psychological egoists and actually wasnt very convinced with their argument against them, but then again i just cant find it in me to believe (like, really  believe) in psychological egoism anyway, so what does it matter? Its one of those things i wonder about sometimes.       Psychological egoism is, for anyone whos wondering, the theory that humans always act out of self-interested motives and can't help but do so. "In all cases, where people do things both good and bad, they are only doing things that they really want to do....doing good acts makes us feel really good about ourselves; our brains release pheromones, we feel a sense of self-worth, and it makes us happy" (Ingram & Parks, 67). And for even mor explanation... "Physchological egoists claim that (1) we only do things because we really want to, so we shouldn't be praised for good acts and (2) we want the good feelinging that come with doing good things, so doing good acts is really self-serving" (Ingram & Parks 67). So its kinda like that. The theory that, no matter what you do, no matter how selfless and "right" it is... no matter how little you benefit from a certain act tangibly... youre still only really doing it because its going to make you feel good. like consoling a friend on the phone until 1 in the morning on a school night when shes just feeling awful and like life sucks and that nothing will ever get better.... why are you doing that? why waste your time when you need to be sleeping and doing homework and... its just stupid. well, youre doing it because you want to help your friend, right? well... psychological egoism says sure, youre doing it because you want to help your friend, but you want to help your friend because it makes you feel good inside when you help people. so really youre only doing it for that warm, fuzzy feeling. you know what im talking about?      Yeah, so my book talked about that and refuted it unsuccessfully in my opinion, but... the only thing that really stuck out as a good point against it was that "The assertation that, 'Everything we do is done because we want to,' would be true by definition: To do something is to do something we choose to do; and to choose to do something is to want to do it. So, 'Everything that is done is done because we want to do it,' would mean nothing more than the empty claim that, 'everything that is done is done because it is done'" (Ingram & Parks, 68). So, duh, we only do everything because itll make us feel good...because we want to.  Making a choice in favor of something is always means you want to do it, and if you want to do it, it means it has to be making you feel good about somethign in some way. you know? So maybe the whole theory isnt saying very much at all... being ethical is about making the best choices regarding those fuzzy feelings, i guess. I dunno. it doesnt completely satisfy me... there are still "But!"s in my brain saying psychological egoism is true, and then there are the "oh, shut up"s from the moralists in my head saying "so what? doesnt take the dignity away from making good decisions." and stuff... so yeah...  and it talked about moral subjectivity and stuff... but im not gonna get into that.  anyway, what i really meant to write about on here, was about Jeremy Bentham's idea of Utilitarianism....the idea that morality has nothign to do with pleasing God or being commited to absolute rules; rather, morality comes down to nothing more than the attempt to create as much happiness in the world as possible. which...well im not endorsing that or condeming it, but this Bentham guy set up this system for judging how much good will come from your actions. You have to rate things on a scale of 1-10 in 7 categories and tally up the points. Categories: 1. Intensity: How intense is the pleasure? 2. Duration: How long does the pleasure last? 3. Certainty: How certain are you that the pleasure will occur? 4. Proximity: How soon will the pleasure be experienced? 5. Fecundity: How many more pleasures will happen because of this one? 6. Purity: How free from pain is the pleasure? 7. Extent: How many of us will experience the pleasure?  (whoa...just got totally sidetracked for like an hour looking up slam poetry and trying to figure out of there are places/clubs in tucson that have weekly open mike nights or whatever... hey, its a college town. there are crazies. and where there are crazies, there are poets. how cool would it be to go to a poetry slam thing with the friend im gonna get to take over the summer? way cool indeed.)  So let me justify, using Bentham's method, what always seems to leave people shaking their heads...   SLEEP  (on a school night)  1. Intensity: mmm, sleeping's not incredibly intense, but the feeling of tiredness and will to sleep are sometimes, so ill give it a 5 2. Duration: Depends on how long I sleep, but say im gonna get 7 hours.... you know what? im still gonna be tired in the morning cause ill have to get up for school... though it will keep me from dying in class the next day... so im gonna go with 3 3. Certainty: How certain am i that im gonna get a nice, deep sleep? depends if i have something on my mind, but seeing as how i cant fully relax most school nights because therere always tests to worry about...lets go with 6 4. Proximity: the pleasure in sleeping is pretty much the moment you lay down and that period as youre falling asleep...when you know you can just sleep. so its pretty instantly gratifying, i guess. so...8 5. Frecundity: well i'll be fairly well rested for the next day, and thats good, so...maybe...6 6. Purity: I could have nightmares or bad dreams... if i have good dreams its very good... but not always...i tend to dream about things im worrying about... so... maybe... 6 7. Extent: aside from the fact that not as many people will hear me complain about how tired i am, my sleeping helps no one...so 1.  Total: 1+6+6+8++6+3+5= 35   STAYING UP LATER THAN I SHOULD TALKING TO EMILY ONLINE  (on a school night)  1. Intensity: :-) well, i do greatly enjoy my emily conversation...but in person or on the phone is better...so... 7.5 2. Duration: It will keep me happy until the next time i get to talk to her, because we know that the longer the gaps between fulfilling conversations, the crazier i get, so 7. 3. Certainty: mmm...this isnt that high because sometimes she isnt so willing to talk to me...what with homework and stuff...so 5. 4. Proximity: well its good to talk to her when i talk to her, so...um...9? 5. Frecundity: this is kind of a weird question...but... the more we talk, the more we know about each other and the better friends we are...so...8? 6. Purity: this might be lower too cause maybe wed have a serious conversation that wasnt necessarily free from all unfun thoughts...and...sometimes i realize things id rather not realize...so maybe...4...although not always...but...oh, i dunno, i should score this lower on something, shouldnt i? what the hell, ill just stick with 4. 7. Extent: well me and her get to have fun. and people get to be spared from hearing me complain as much about not talking to her... so... but still thats not very many people, so 3.  Total: 7.5+7+5+9+8+4+3= 43.5  35   Ha. Mathematically proven. sort of. But there. im not crazy. its just...true...for me. Id rather talk to emily than sleep. Now dont ever tell me you dont understand why i make that decision time after time.  and we also have an explanation for why i never used to get any sleep at sleepovers. and that was when her score would have been higher. cause 2, 5, 6, and 7 all would have been a little higher, methinks.  Crazy philosophy book. i wonder if it talks about love... perhaps i should look it up...  oh, you know what else i decided? when i take my friend to arizona were actually gonna do cool stuff. like possibly see some spoken word poetry preformances, visit carchner caverns, kit peak observatory... mmm... see a movie? i dunno, thats about all ive got so far... oh, go on a night hike in the desert with the ranger peoples. and go swimming and build forts in the guest house and capture lizards and... um... if she be emily, do some of the looking at the stars, feet in the pool truth or dare stuff...followed by a movie. of course. lovely routine, that.  mmm...vacation... i look forward to taking my friend. mmm, friend. frined(s) i should say. considering my parents never definitely said no about taking more than one. although...hmm... the issue of who is a rather large one this time. i dunno. it can wait at least until after spring break though.   i think i might go drive up to blockbuster and rent something. maybe. im scared of the roads again though. damned lane changes. i hate lange changing. im gonna get killed.  i really wanted to talk to emily too.... perhaps i should call... mmm, after my movie though. if mis padres permiten.  adios para ahora.

      this was one of those days where there were so many things i wanted to do that i couldnt decide what to do and then i just ended up doing nothing.  i was gonna make another origami creature and possibly even write emily a note and then make it into a creature and use the origami as a new creative folding technique. but...  and i really feel like talking to emily and i havent yet. i could email her but she never replies and i could write her a note, but its so much faster to type...so why write? i guess im just lazy. and id call but she had track and then dinner and now homework, so shes probably busy. and so im just waiting now, like always, for her to get online. cause im like that.  and i thought about making cookies. but i didnt.  and i have homework i ought to do, but havent done yet. cause im a lazy idiot. just euro and math though, so...not too bad. and theres always study hall.  and i was gonna drive up to coldstone to get ice cream...but... well i guess its my moms fault we didnt do that one.  and i was gonna write...and i wanted to.. but i kinda lost the spirit... i had it after that awesome "Rhythm and Rhyme" class with this dude Danny McKleever. That was the coolest thing ever! Spoken word poetry preformances...poetry slam kinda stuff. all his own work. it was amazing. moving, i should say. he was kinda cute too. i mean, he was like mid-twenties to early thirties or something in age, so obviously not right for me or anything. He still had a certain charm though. And he had long dark eyelashes. haha, maybe i have a thing for poets with long dark eyelashes (fiennes as Shakespeare). mmm, poets. :-) its like "Oh my God,  you think!  you speak so eloquently! you care so passionately about things! you have a heart! i think i love you!" *swoon* mmm...i want a boyfriend...  odyssey today was alright.   dia numero dos:  1. Tales Told True (Jessica and Casey)- pretty boring. im not really one for story tellers...unless...well i just wasn interested in his stories. i dunno. they didnt thrill me.  2. Neo-Futurists (Brittany?)- This was pretty cool. a little weird, but cool. too political at times, but very humorous at others. i respect the players.  3. Rhythm and Rhyme (uh...well...catia?)- This was amazing. so cool. especially his emphasis on love and hearts and souls and...all that good stuff. the real stuff. ill bet he understands my concept of real. and i decided im gonna hang out in poetry slam coffee houses when im in college. and im gonna date a poet. and were gonna live happily ever after. and im gonna drive up and visit emily every month or so and we will be awesome friends for the rest of our lives.  4. Lunch (*deep breath* kara, heather, lauren, emily, emily, monica, kelly, jessica, sara, olga, and some people i dont know)- lunch was okay... it was better yesterday though. when i had better emily talk.  5. Blues Brothers (Caitlin and Jessica and Kara and Brittany and Emily and...well, Eric)- the thing was pretty boring. had an okay time i guess. wish i could have actually talked to emily though. did mess with her guidebook, however, good fun in that. but...eric...  eric...garg. i cant take it when its hes with her and were all in a group or something. i guess...i guess its just a jealousy thing...im jealous because hes the one she wants to talk to...more than she wants to talk to me. and its...accepted and expected that they sit next to each other hold hands and talk and giggle and stuff. theyre going out, right? yeah, they are. she has a right to like him, doesnt she? yes, she does. but...i hate... its like being teased. Its like shes right...there...infrontof me...but i...just...cantquitetouch...her...no matter...how...close...always...just. out.of.reach. Here she is, heres this person who means the world to me, and i spend so much time waiting to talk to her, waiting to have these chances...and for what? so i can watch him put his head on her shoulder and know its not a good time to...know shes not in my world right now. But its so hard not to want so badly...       I cant ignore it. its like...theres Emily! my friend i love more than anything. and everything inside of me jumps towards her, begging me to talk to her, laugh with her, learn all i can about her. watch her heart beat. understand what invisible forces keep her together, keep her looking up and moving foward. memorize what color thread binds her heart to her mind, her mind to her body, and her body to her soul. I want to trace the contours of that soul like lines on the inside of her palm as she laughs and tells me to stop tickling her. *breath* And all of that, all of that complex, raw emotion and raging passion roars and riots insatiable inside me. and its everything i can do to calm and quiet the calmity of cacophony with a subtle, soothing "shh, now is not the time, nor the place for such things."....and i sigh. pushing it all back and telling it to wait...just wait... eventually there will be a time. but push enough of that back and you get this horrible build up of pressure and thats what gets to me sometimes. but sunday released a lot of that, so im not in danger of exploding any time soon. polaski day weekend is near, anyway...   i figured out what i should have said today. caitlin with "but ive known her the longest" eric with "but im her boyfriend" kara with "but im the reason youre going out" and me with...nothing... nothing but the most candid, sincere, devoted thought--or feeling, rather-- of "but i love you!" and i kinda laughed and said "uh...ive got nothing" but i shouldve said...i really should have said "but i love her the most" and gotten into whatever arguments would follow (even if we were semi-joking in the first place), because im pretty goddamn sure i love her more deeply than any of them do, even eric. i mean, i guess its different because its a crush kind of thing, but if you could somehow measure my love against erics, i think id still win. and maybe thats ignorance speaking, but oh well. let see which of us goes most crazy if you take her away. ill bet you anything its me.   well anyway...  Thats what i dont like about this boyfriend business. That she has less time for me because of him and that i dont feel like i can talk to her when hes around. And thats a big reason i didnt go to homecoming or turnabout. do i want to deal with that crap all night? hell no.  but dont get me wrong. eric is a good kid. and if he makes emily happy, so be it. she deserves to be happy.   ...and wow. i spent too long writing this. and its probably a little more personal than id like...but...oh well, i guess. i felt like ranting, i suppose. and in a bombastic, emotional sort of way. been a while since i had a good rant. unless you count that thing from sunday. but happiness rants dont count as much. theyre not...emotional/moral unrest rants. which i specialize in.  or something.  i dunno. i need to do my homework.

      dia numero uno:  "Homeroom"...english...emily and jessica and jenna and lany and other cool people. yay.  Actors Gymnasium (jenna and brittany)- this was kinda weird, but somewhat entertaining. actors/acrobats dancing around and doing mimeish things. the doll girls were cool.  Secrets of Swashbuckling (lauren and nikki)- undeniably the best class of the day. didnt actually get to swashbuckle meself, but i sat up close, second row, and watched some awesome demonstrations and was captivated by their lecture. cool guys. funny. learned.  Lunch (michele and heather and emily and jessica and caitlin and rita and olga and...karen)- fun times. Emily!!! thats about all i have to say.  Musical! the musical (emily and kara and jessica and heather and...well, eric)- a little boring, moderately entertaining at times. eric-business very uncool.  i dont feel like explaining that though. damned band friends. and she wonders why i dislike them...  Najawa Dance Corps (jessica and emily and abby)- boring. not very good jessica or emily conversation either. oh well though.   two classes, lunch, and homeroom with emily!!! whoa! amazenering! especially when you consider how random this is and how many people there are! soo yay for that!  and...hmm...what else to say? i dunno. i decided i want to go to the mall with alex and tell him what he should wear if he wants to look good. cause he doesnt now. and...he could. he just wont listen to me. if only!  hmm...and...i dunno. i dont have much to say, really. i need something to look forward to, also. i need to make crazy fun plans for polaski day weekend so that i can wait impatiently for that.  ill have to do all my stupid homework tomorrow, though. erg. oh well. it was worth it to have free days today and yesterday. woo! free!  hehe, and its friday when i have school again, so no homework until sunday. woooooooo.  im gonna go sleep. odyssey is fun. i like seeing emily. i wonder if shell sleepover next weekend? i can hope. dum dee dum dum dum. im tired. i should go to bed.  but im also thirsty. i think ill go have a drink. and then lay out clothes for tomorrow. and then go to bed.  and i wonder if i should bring my backpack tomorrow? i did today and i didnt use it at all...hmmm... i guess ill be needing those siscors. bah. well see.  um...night, then.

      ...and it was almost three! dios mio. a veces, ojala que no fuera la verdad, pero, todo vale la pena, vez despues de vez. maldecido amor.  first off, an awesome song: "Somewhere over the Rainbow/What a wonderful world" by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. Hes hawaiian. Its an amazingly beautiful song though. peaceful. and we know how i love my peace.  "and i think to myself, what a wonderful world..."  yeah, so...update. Friday i went to see 50 first dates. which didnt suck as bad as i thought it would. it was kinda cute. and adam sandler didnt make as big of an ass out of himself as he usually does, so it was good. and i went with kara and cait and martha. i originally wasnt going to do anything on friday, so...fun times.  saturday i went driving for an hour and a half finally. i havent had hardly any driving practice. im not as scared about driving now. because of that. and because i went driving with emily three times and we didnt crash and die and i felt pretty safe. anyway, after driving i went to micheles for pizza and...to my great surprise...emily was there...what the hell? why isnt she with eric? i know, i know... i thought that too. but eric was sick. too sick to go out with emily, i guess. they didnt do anything for valentines day! how sad is that? thats sad. poor emily. emily didnt care very much though...because apparently she dislikes valentines day for whatever reason. so it was just any other day to her and she was indifferent about not being showered with romantic gifts or anything. so shes weird. whatever. it was great though, because i got surprise emily! which i never get. its amazing. and then we went to see "Morning Star" at school and it was incredibly good! James and Kim were especially good! Amazing! those kids have crazy talent. i think it was better than "you cant take it with you"...although "you cant take it with you" was funnier. well, it was good. and cait and i danced during the scene changes. in the front row.       and emily drove me there. which was cool. michele does this thing sometimes which always makes me laugh... when were all together and we go to sit down at tables or in a theater or its being decided whos next to who or whos pared with who or whatever...sometimes, when michele sees, say, kara and i are both going for the same spot next to emily, shell say something like "let amanda sit next to emily, she never gets to talk to her"...which is nice, but i cant help but laugh abecause...i dont know...because its funny taht she does that. and it was between me and kara...as to who was gonna ride with emily there...michele had her say and i rode with emily. nicenesss.  today i didnt do much of anything...got up late and went to church late. almost drunk the wine. but i didnt. cause im a coward. and because i hadnt swallowed my host. i came home then... talked to emily about what we were doing...gave up on teh sleepover business and we spent the next several hours trying to decide what we were gonna do which was kinda nice because i was basically just talking to her on the phone for an hour about nothing... eventually...after a long while... we decided to go to red robin for drinks or smoothies or shakes or something. so we did. and she drove me. and it was nice. we sat tehre and talked some more for like 2 hours. very nice. nice. why do i keep using that word? well, beats me...but tahts what it was. nice. calming. peaceful. happy. comfortable. and i feel good. and she drove me home and i messed with the radio. and...hmm...i dont know. it was nice.  i didnt ask her either of the 2 things i was going to, but i guess tahts okay...i didnt want to ruin the conversation as it was. i can learn later. maybe i dont want to know now anyway. it needs to be in a more private setting. like maybe when she sleeps over next...which might be a while, but oh well. maybe soon, though. polaski day weekends coming up. high hopes for then.  i am happy right now. :-D.   Ive said it before and ill say it again... there are times...there are times when i really really wish it wasnt true... but it is... it always is... its worth it to have lived through those tears and bad days and lonely, frustrated times... its worth it for how nice it feels to actually talk to her every once in a while. its so worth it.  and maybe that makes me crazy...well, hell, i am crazy...  but i dont really care. screw it. friendship is amazing. i love emily. :-D.  "...and i think to myself, what a wonderful world"

So as far as we know im perfectly normal and im not insane, right? and we dont know about the sudden appearance of the eyeliner? good.  ...too bad blogger doesnt work so i couldnt see if anyone commented on that. *shifty eyes*...im gonna be so mad at myself if that was actually posted and read. damn.  anyway, i guess its not that big of a deal... i just get mad when i do stupid things and let people know things i didnt intend for them to know. you know? well, haha, you dont. but...yes...   let all just pretend this never happened.  10 second tom.

      Yesterday and Monday were craptacular days. im not exactly sure why, but... it just got to me, i guess. things get to me some times. not for any specific reason. but im okay now.  yeah, so i feel better today. im not exactly sure why. maybe cause im actually talking to emily? maybe cause i know shes listening? i dont know. i feel better though. much better. and late arrival tomorrow. yay!  and i have to get emily to say shell sleepover sunday. because i would love that. and i will play happy music and we will talk about nothing and i will learn more about her and we will play truth or dare and never leave my room and the velcro will be reattatched instead of slowly but steadily being ripped apart. and you know that ugly noise velcro makes when you rip it.   the velcro will be reatatched. and it will reinforced with superglue and staples and duct tape and... what other adhesive material could i use? spirit gum? haha, i wonder if we could stick our thumbs together with spirit gum... *strokes nonexistant beard thoughtfully and smiles*... shed never let me though. oh well.  still need to talk to her about a little bit more of the unpleasantness, but i think im done for the time... think ive made most of the points ive wanted to make and asked the questions ive wanted to ask... i just want her to give me her word on a few things.   im hungry. i think im going to eat some corn and other foods. and chocolate.  i should write more. i wish i still had time for it.  i hope everyone has a nice valentines day. i have to make valentines tonight and tomorrow night and plan something for saturady (and sunday...emily?). and i hope eric and emily dont do things they shouldnt (no, not that)....well, things i think they shouldnt. actually, you know how proud of her i would be if they go out for, say, 9 months and she never did anything more than hug him and kiss him? that would be awesome. id make her a present. some sort of award. well see though. she has a right to do what she wants to her in her life. well see how things turn out.  a song that made me feel a lot better today in that way songs can: "Cange your Mind" by sister hazel. it was on the announcements.  im gonna go eat.  heres to hoping emily and i get a little closer. *raises glass*

      wow... is it bad to feel better because youve made someone feel guilty? like a twinge of satisfaction because its being acknowledged that you didnt deserve "that." like maybe they understand...  hmmph. im too tired and formerly miserable to feel guilty about making people feel guilty. let them deal with it for once.  hmm....odd that i should feel better now... maybe just cause i feel like progress was made.  but was it? and what the hell am i going to do tomorrow? *sigh*...guess we just wait and pray and see...  crazy, crazy life. why is my life so crazy?

People who have made me feel better: -Heather -Liz -Kailey -Andrew -Emily (on the good days) -My cat -Julie ...more people im forgetting...   if youre not on the list, dont worry...it doesnt mean you put me in a bad mood or anything.  eh, i have to go continue cleaning my room and then go to blockbuster...  heres to eric keeping his hands to himself tonight! i wonder if i even want to know? sigh... it would be just perfect if it happened during this period of time when i feel like i dont know her very well too. just perfect. gar. stupid life.  anyway, cleaning and then blockbuster and then grocery store.  i wonder if liz will get my directions?  id put my pizza tiger on here, but its not possible if its not hosted by some site or something. it was a nice picture though. which reminds me... i have to send jenna and dana and erin and olga and jessica those pictures... hmm....gotta get to that.  i wonder what my parents would say if-- ha, i dont even want to think about that... too crazy and too improbable and too far in the future.  you know what i was thinking about this morning? im such a crazy hopeless/helpless (which one is it?) romantic. urlLink      urlLink Quiz By Lady Paje    urlLink

      Okay, a real update. yay.  I was going to write about this Andrew Shirman business, but i sort of dont want to because its kind of like an invasion of his privacy or something. Like how when i write/complain about Emily its a violation of her privacy...cept i dont care as much cause shes waved most rights already by willingly befriending me and continuing to asosciate with me, despite my annoyingness and other less enjoyable qualities. But anyway, my point: Andrew = new friend. Emily = old friend. New friends are easier to scare, piss-off, freak out, and lose than old friends. They arent used to you yet and theres not as much unconditional trust, you know? Not that this is a big deal, whether i explain about Andrew, but im just justifying the lack of information.  Ill just do it shortly: This week has been amusing because i found out a foilist from Marian Central has a crush on me and hes been talking to me onlin3. He's nice. funny, actually.  not saying anything beyond that. not to you. you public, you. if you want to know, ask me.  talked to emily yesterday. was happy. good thing, too, cause if she hadnt gotten online i mightve had to be serious on her today and complain and look sad. which wouldntve gone well cause there wasnt time to talk in english, as it turns out.  ive been discovering this week and last what its like to unwittingly be too forceful with people you love dearly and would never, ever, ever want to hurt. I never really believed it...you know, like in books and stuff... when the man is so frustrated with things hes just squeezes a little to hard and the wifes like "let go of me!" and hes like "i didnt mea-im sorry, i dont know whats wrong with me" you know what im talking about? yeah, i always thought that was weird, but.... man, its true. Sometimes when you get passionate about something, and youre so frustrated and theres so much intense emotion bound up in it and you care so much about something, not knowing what to do or feeling helpless or unwanted or something, it can really make you be more physically violent than normal, even to people you would never want to hurt. and im not talkign when youre mad at the person and youre trying to contain your anger, i just mean...if youre mad at a situation or at the fact that you cant change something so incredibly important thats ruining everything. So yeah. I pulled emily sweatshirt harder than i should have and i did some crazy shaking gesture last week that was totally uncalled for. No, i didnt hurt anybody or anything real like that. These are just small things and i realize a second later "Whoa, what the hell am i doing?" and you know what caused both of those? caitlin's talk of friends changing too much...and my fear of my friends changing... and then emily saying she thinks aim is a waste of time...implying that shes not going to get online very often anymore. so when the hell am i going to talk to her!?!? never! thats when. huzzah.   but anyway. im not a violent kid, i swear. sometimes you build up so much frustration and so much intensity and passionte emotion and stuff... it comes out in ways you would rather it not. story over.  i imagined graduation again today... dont know what makes me think about that. i decided i want my friends to write me letters--real, physical letters-- once were all in college and stuff. I mean, maybe not  all  my friends, but the really good ones. Because letters are cool cause you can keep them and reread them later and stuff.   hmm...what else to say? i have a crazy euro test tomorrow that i dont want to take. but its an activity period. so 40 fabulous minutes to get yelled at to stop distracting emily from her physics homework. i have hope.  and assembly friday! huzzah for wastes of time!  and yay for no more fencing and free time for amanda!  nothing else to say. 'cept that i want to learn random things to tell emily to tell her frenchie. cause im weird like that. oh well. maybe ill get lany to help me in english.   oh, and if i ever do end up falling for this andrew character, i decided i will write "Andrew Shirman rocks my socks!!!" on my profile. sexy? definitely.  weird out of context comment of the day: amasochisticsock: there are only so many inappropriate things you can do with a banana

      Andrew Shirman is detremental to my blogging.  Actually, so is Emily, in a contradictory way. Cause when i  do  talk to her, theres less to complain about, and less reason to blog.   In conclusion: I talked to andrew and emily for a while today and now i no longer have the motivation to update. perhaps tomorrow.

       key feelings/thoughts/things   THE FACTS  -I saw emily drive this morning...that was funny.  -I arrived to see them watching a movie so i wasted all my excitement in sitting and staring at a box moving pictures...but whatever. i came late, what do i expect?  -Heather's scrapbook turned out cool.  -Emily's not pregnant...though she has no proof.  -Kelly made awesome cookies that spelled out "Happy Birthday Heather!!! From Kelly" it was sweet.  -Emily didnt stay up and talk to me for a while after everyone else was asleep. But i didnt pressure her to, either. Because i was so tired myself and because i didnt feel like making her do something she didnt want to do.  -We played taboo. Im much worse at taboo now than i used to be. Lack of inside jokes? i think so.  -Kara and Kelly and Emily talked about band for a long time  -Kelly and Heather and Caitlin and Emily and Kara and Me all talked about driving for a while...or i guess more so about drivers ed.  -I learned kara talks to eric a hell of a lot.  "AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?"  It was fun, it really was. Nice talking to my friends who i dont always get a chance to talk to. Talked to Caitlin for what seemed like more than usual and im glad because i want to be better friends with Caitlin and talk to her more and know her better and stuff. She's cool. Got to know Kelly a little better. Kelly's cool too. She should talk more at lunch.   I caught myself being a jealous bastard, though. Listening to Kara and Emily talk...mostly about Band. Kara probably talked to emily more than i did. That was kind of uncool. But then again, do i have any right to think "No! She's mine!"? Of course not. I want her all to myself... and is that rational and fair, amanda? Is that smart? Does that make any sense? Are you respecting other people's feelings? No. Don't be selfish. You can't do that with people.   Then again...is it selfish to want to give your time and help and love and...self (as in like...sharing who you are...sort of) to one specific person and not others? I guess its a twised kind of selfish. Or, i guess thats not the selfish part of it...the selfish part is the "is it selfish to want a specifc person to spend time with only you?" hmmm... i still think its a twisted sort of selfish. selfish jealousy.  The sad theme of the night was me feeling like something was missing. I mean, it was fun. i had fun. i really did. But it wasnt the all-consuming, happyfeeling fun from the sleepovers of olde. I felt...like i didnt know everyone very well. Our little group used to be so close, and now...compared to how close i used to feel, i feel kinda like were strangers now. I mean, we're not, but... i dont know. I felt kind of lonely, i guess. Kind of...uncomfortable? Kind of...like i was there but no one needed me. Like they wouldntve been sad if i left. Which is crazy because they would have, definitely. Its not like they dont love me...they do. I got called like 3 times yesterday to make sure/ask if i was going and stuff. Maybe i just... maybe my niche is gone. My place. My home. My...my talking to Emily the whole time and giggling a lot and staying up till crazy hours of the morning joking and talking about weird things and real things alike. I used to do that all the time. That was my thing that i did at sleepovers...and now its kind of gone. Not that i dont want to talk to Emily, of course. It just feels kind of awkward i guess. Or maybe i shouldnt worry about it. But id be afraid to insist on sitting next to her all night and stuff... afraid of what? i dont know. maybe having to fight kara for a spot and pretend like its not a big deal if she gets her way. its just a seat, right? who cares about that... just a friendship, right? Who needs one of those...       Anyway, so there was that. Feeling out of place because my job disappeared. Like happily showing up for another day of fulfilling work at your beloved family law firm and discovering that you now work for a new (jackass) boss and your job is to place the heads on bobblehead dolls in an assembly line. In the dark in Chicago winter with no heat. And they take your shoes. Well, maybe not exactly like that. More like...at 1:00, gently tossing Bob over to a trying-to-sleep Emily who's facing the other direction and ignoring you because she wants to get to bed and watching her remove him from ontop of her head, set him aside, unwanted and unembraced, and go back to her attempted slumber. without a word. When...once...i could have tossed that over, and she would have gone "Bob!" and hugged it tight, and then it would have disappeared into her sleeping bag to be all warm and cosy and had anyone tried to wrentch it from her grip...she would have complained and looked lonely until he was returned. But i guess i shouldnt complain about that... because... its not like i dont understand. Still kinda sad though... ill never get a real mental vacation again. And kara... oh, man. That was bad. When she was like "Emily doesnt want bob anymore. Why hold bob if she can hold Eric? No one needs bob. Hes been replaced." or something to that effect. I think i laughed when she said that because of how cruel it would have been had she meant it in the metaphorical Bob way. then again, i guess hes only a symbol for that for me. But enough about missing the old sleepovers...  People grow up, people change, things wont always stay the same. K, fine. But i didnt even get any real talking with Emily! Man, i wanted that. I guess its hard to get that when youre in a group. And if she isnt gonna stay up... its not really gonna happen.  Ah, i need Real talking. learning more about you talking. bonding talking. words with feelings and thoughts attatched. Words weighed down with all the subtext. not meaningless talk of scales and arpegios (not spelled right) for Slepak. Words so heavy it makes you smile to remember them because of how many different things were implied and understood in a single sentence. You know? real talking. so i can be happy and feel like i actually know this girl. I want that. (in a related topic: this is a big reason why i like English/books/writing)  So the next time i could get some of that talking would be....the weekend after valentine's weekend. so, now we're gonna cross our fingers for the 21st or 22nd. okay? And we're going to hope there isnt track that saturday morning. And we're going to hope there is no babysitting to be done. Or basketball games to attend. Or anything like that.   you know what i want? i think thats one of my three wishes...i want...i want to truly feel peaceful and comfortable. Every once in a while. It's been a while since i felt that way. Since there wasn't a worry hovering in the back of my mind, since there wasnt Want screaming his head off, since i could sleep without thinking about all the things i wish i could do or all teh things i wish i didnt have to do. Since i could pray a genuine prayer of thanks free from the guilt of knowing that i cant just be happy with everything i have. Since life wasnt running after me like that cop with the liquid metal arms from Terminator 2, and love trying to recite sonnets on secrets of my heart like when little kids scream words underwater in a pool to see if their friends can make out what theyre saying, and reason dangling limp and mute from the hangman's nuse while lynching emotion raves fanatically, and sanity falling ever so admirably on his own sword. Faith and idealism are sick, tired and weak with fever. About the only thing in tact is morlaity, a solemn guard...but even he's been seen nodding off now and then.  So what do i need? A faster car, to pick love up out of the water and give her lessons in annunciation, a sheriff and a doctor to round up emotion and resuscitate reason, a shrink for sanity, tylenol, chicken soup, and time for idealism and faith, and some caffine for morality. Or, to put it simply: i need to  talk  to Emily and feel better about how well i know her.  and how do i get that? i dont know. by waiting and hoping for 3 weeks, i guess. But if i dont get it then...damn will i be depressed.  Or am i already depressed? mmm, who knows, who knows. Im just crazy, thats waht i am. pure and simple crazy.  Im gonna go sleep now for a few hours. Ill write about fencing eventually. later today or tomorrow. Maybe post some pictures. gotta email those pictures to jenna and jessica and dana and erin and olga too. well, eventually.... oh, and remind me to talk about eyeliner sometime.  Final thought: its oddly comforting to watch people breathe. Or to watch sleeping people in general. People you actually like, anyway.

      so while here ive been thinking about who i want to take with me when i come this summer and my parents let me take a friend. last year, as we all know, i took emily. it was fun. lots of fun. felt pretty close. so its coming time again to make my choice again.   last year there was much debate in my head between caitlin and emily because i thought cait would have fun out here and i didnt see her much last year and...i dunno, i wouldve had fun with her, i know i wouldve. but i took emily cause...i dont know, cause i just wanted it more.   and i made that choice with every intention of "switching off" between who i took...as in this year i would take, say, caitlin, and next year i would take, say, martha...and the year after that...just...different people each time. because thats fair. and i want to be fair.  cept now im stuck between caitlin and emily again. cause i miss emily soooo much and to spend an entire week with her again would be awesome...but then i also kind of promised myself i would take cait...and it still would be fun to take cait. i dont doubt we would have fun down here.  so...i dunno. im stuck a little, i guess.   i dont know if emily would want to come again though...she probably would, i guess. just the same boring stuff as last time though. but id make sure we did some more fun things...different than we did last time. and i know shes gonna be busy...with job and stuff...  but i could still try, right?  and i have no idea what caits doing this summer...i dont even know if shes taking summer school...but were going after 1st semester summer school anyway cause alex and i are taking first semester.  so...as i believe i mentioned before...theres kind of like a mind vs. heart decision to make my heart says "take emily! you love emily! you miss emily! take every chance you get to spend more time with her!" and my brain says "take turns, caitlins a good friend too, she would have a lot of fun out here and so would you, dont waste all your life just with emily. it would probably mean a lot to her too, since she expects you to take emily again."  they both make good points.  and then im like "well, you could bring both..." cause i think if i argued long enough, theyd let me take both cait and emily... cept cait would feel left out, i think... that or i could cultivate a cool cait and amanda and emily threesome friendship thing. except do i want that? i dont know... i want my best frien d  to be emily. which is selfish and stupid. and it also makes me want to just take emily again.  and...yeah...i dunno  michele told me to take caitlin. but she  would , wouldnt she? and that makes me want to take emily even more...just to spite her. caitlin told me to take emily...and that makes me want to take caitlin. because she would be selfless and nice and want me to be happiest...and automatically suggest i take emily even when i mention im considering taking her or someone else... i havent asked emily, but shed probably tell me to take caitlin...which would make me want to take emily for the same reason caitlin telling me to take emily makes me want to take caitlin eric told me to take emily. but he  would . but that makes me want to take emily more, i guess. because he was trying to come up with things to help me get closer to her. i cant remember things anyone else has told me if theyve given me thier opinions.  im thinking ill end up asking emily. because i would feel bad if i was here with caitlin and thinking "i miss emily"...feel bad as in...feel guilty...that i took caitlin and i cant just be happy that im here with caitlin. if that makes any sense.  and because i cant help jumping at every opportunity i have to get closer to emily. and because i love emily more. i just do. no offense to caitlin. i love her too. i just...what can i say? we all know how much i care about emily. i cant help but want to spend time with her so badly.  and stuff.  i dunno.  i dont even know really why im writing this. but i felt like it should be written.  and thers a giant bug flying around my room and its freaking me out and i think i might go kill it.  and mayb eill write later about my disgust with the abortion adds in the phonebook. probably not though. already did that once today.  and heres hopnig for winfield. cause that would be cool.  off to kill the mystery bug. night.

      so i love how im in such a good mood yesterday and saturday and this morning and then i get to school and its all downhill from there... and i love how i was relatively happy about emily things until this ms walk buisness which bugged me. because its like shes choosing new friends over old friends, over me.... like she always does. but then i was thinking on teh bus on the way home and im like "you know, this is stupid, give her some respect, im sure she has her reasons. you trust her enough to know shes not choosing to not go just to spite you. ask her why she wants to go to special olymics so badly." so i called her about an hour ago just to talk and i only got to talk for like 15 minutes cuase she made me leave so she could do her homework, but i asked her why and she said "because special olympics was one of the things i had the most fun doing last year" or something... so i guess thats some justification. if she truly enjoyed it a lot, then fine, let her go. amanda wants emily to be happy, right? maybe amanda will call emily from the ms walk to bother her at special olympics.  i love how something like that can totally ruin my moderately good mood though... how i can never just be free from worrying about emily stuff. i want freedom!  amanda has been calling emily a lot lately.  because amanda wants to have a real conversation with emily at least once a week or so, otherwise she feels lonely. and i was pretty much busy all weekend, which sucks, so i didnt get to call her on saturday when she can actually talk. :'(. but, oh well, i guess. i think i might have to call her from arizona. i just might have to. ive never called anyone here from az before, but i just might do it. if she doesnt get online, what other choice do i have? be lonely or forget about normal life? ha, no. my vacations from normal life would are the times when i actually see emily.  i was just thinking about how im going to visit colleges in california this summer...and mudd is in california. not that i want to go to mudd, cause im pretty sure i dont from what ive heard, but if i do find a college i really like, that might be cool. what if emily and i went to college in the same state? thatd be awesome. but...no... dont think about that. im not going to choose my college based on my friends' colleges. thats not hte way to go about it... and i know it.  yeah, so other people have been really annoying me lately. i dont know what the deal is, i guess its just getting to mehow much life has changed and how much time i spend with people i dont want to see/talk to...and how i really really wish i could be spending that time with other people i  do  want to talk to.  like mornings when i want our old mornings back an di want emily back.   ...but i always want emily back.  so speaking of wants... hmm...this might go on my lj...but...i intend to write about wants.

      oh wow, this is weird... i think im going crazy.  read passage to india, am a little annoyed cause i have so much work to do. and i need an extra day cause i lost my weekend. i just called emily and basically said nothing...i just wanted to talk to her but now is not a good time, so i called and said i wanted to talk to her but i cant cause i have homework and she has homework. and then i mumbled about being tired and stuff for 5 minutes and left her alone so we could do our respective homework and told her id call her tomorrow or tuesday to talk cause i want to actually talk to her at least once a week. so i hung up the phone and now im like half crying and i really dont know why cause im in a pretty good mood... and i dont feel bad...so theyre not sad tears... but they dont exactly feel like "im so happy i love life!" tears cause nothing marvelous just happened...  so im confused. i dont like it when i dont know why i feel the way i feel. maybe...my best guess is that its just been an emotional weekend cause of this retreat thing and im kind of worn out and i call emily and the little people in my heart are like "hey! emily! we love emily!" and then that little tiny bit of emotion just kinda pushed me over into emotional exhaustion. so those were tears of "oh wow, too much to think about, too much to feel, too much to handle"  but im okay now...  and time for my euro...

      theyd better let me use my phone on this retreat thing or im going to go psycho insane and start kiling people. probably not, but ill be pissed and cynical. if they want me at my spiritual fitest, then itd be in their best interest to let me use my cell phone so that i can talk to people i like instead of having to deal with all these other people who annoy me all the time...it just might keep me from going crazy. and they couldnt understand how important it is that i talk to emily often enough. otherwise i dont work right. and if im supposed to be having a spiritual revelation or something, then id better be satisfied enough with emily matters to think deeply about God or Life or whatnot. becaus eif im missing emily therell be that little nagging thought of "why doesnt God advocate my friendship with emily? cause if he did, i think hed be a little easier on me..." which i know i shouldnt think and i know is the wrong thing to think for a million different reasons. i know it. iknowitiknowitiknowit. but i cant help but think it sometimes. because i dont understand this whole thing very well....and no one knows how to explain it to me either. and its "for everything there is a season" vs. "[love] bears all things, believes all things, hopes all thigns, endures all thing. love never ends." and the general praise of persistance and giving of the self for something you believe in...  and who wins? and its "let it be" vs. "all you need is love" vs.... i dont know. so many conflicting theories. and... and... all i want is my friend back and my crazy, idealistic, love-goggled words and proclamations that heather can quote to her hearts content.  and, that. is why i should be able to use my cell phone.  thank you.

      love is a crazy, crazy, crazy thing. powerful and crazy. and blind. and confusing. and forceful. and presistent. and all consuming. and...just, crazy.  some hate it, some think its wonderful. some see its deep connections with the soul, some blame it on chemicals and pheremones. either way, though, i think it deserves a great deal of reverence.  anyway, the point of this post was to say....      no emily this weekend. :'(. i tried though, i tried. not a good day on friday. i was sad. i lied in bed and slept and brooded and cried for a while. my mom gave me a talk that i didnt especially enjoy... about the exact opposite of encouraging as far as keeping my beloved friends... basically telling me that if people dont have time for me, and wont make time for me, they arent worth it. and...some other things i dont care to repeat because i prefer not to dignify their existance by recording them. not that my mom said anything horrible, but...just...things i wish she hadnt. i dont blame her, i might say the same thing in her position, but... she doesnt exactly understand the state of affairs and how i feel about the matter, so her generalities are sometimes off and slightly offensive. and heather made a noteworthy comment on my livejournal. thats all i really have to say about that.       so no seeing emily, but i did talk to her on the phone every day this weekend. i did on friday...somewhat hopelessly and helplessly. probably the most desperate sounding phone call ive made thus far in my life. first time ive ever cried while talking to her on the phone (or any of my friends for that matter, i think). made her pizza get cold. sorry about that. i talked to her yesterday morning about nothing in particular...random things, actually...gay marriage and how she cant think about her plans in the near future and whatnot. *shakes fist* dont go anywhere for easter. or the 4th of july. and somewhat briefly last night when i advised her not to go to third with eric for reasons concerning her braces... that was a regretible piece of advice. but i was hyper and caffeinated, so what can i say? and i talked to her today...online for a few minutes... on the phone for 20 minutes or so before confirmation, and then on the phone for like a half an hour after confirmation. trying to resolve my problem. or...something.   no solution reached, really... but i feel better, somehow. maybe cause she at least now should know without a doubt that this is making me miserable and i really really want to fix it. and i need her to help me fix it because i cant do it by myself. and... hopefully hopefully she will put some more effort into this.   and heres hoping i get my journal back--written in. and heres hoping things improve. and heres hoping my rereat isnt horrible and that my cell phone gets reception. and heres hoping for the weekend after my birthday. and heres hoping for summer. and heres hoping for arizona. and heres hoping for life.  "dont take life too seriously, youll never get out alive"-bugs bunny. sorry, giving oscar wilde a little too much credit i guess.  i dont know if i agree with that quote or not... i prefer something like "life is what you make of it. live each moment fully. breathe deeply. sing loudly. write in italics. love with all your heart. " or something. just made that up. i dunno  gotta go finish india reading and evnetually sleep...  i mean:  gotta go finish india reading and evetually sleep...   living life fully and writing in italics, amanda.

      pleasepleasepleasepleasepelase let this journal thing work out and let me feel a little better about how often i talk to her because i dont sit next to her in english anymore and its going to be a long six weeks. at least there is a vocab quiz on wednesday and i can sit next o her then... i guess i ought to up the study hall notes if i dont get to talk to her in english anymore. ic ant decide if i want to think about life as cruel now because i lost my time in english which was really all i had (although she was online last night and i called her on saturday...a fluke)...or just be grateful that i got to sit next to her in english at all. the thing is completely random, after all. i should be grateful. will i be though? i guess we have to wait and see. maybe shell get online more since she cant use the excuse that i get to talk to her in english. haha...maybe. but then in study hall...when its me and nothing to do and i can either write her a note or write in the journal, which am i gonna do? how are the mechanics of this thing going to even work? can i hear from her sooner than once every two weeks? is that pushing for too much? i dont know, i dont know. i shuldnt think too much about it like im assuming is a reality. its not...not yet. i hope she agrees though. i hope. and i hope we can do somethign this weekend. please? pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease? pleasepleasepelasepleaseplease? it would make me happy and i would appreciate it. its a relatively small thing to ask for, isnt it? a few hours of my [best] friends time on the weekend? it would make me happier than anything else i can think of. alturism...greatest good for greatest number of people... or...just... pitty, or getting what i deserve? no, i shouldnt say that. i dont know what i deserve and i am not going to be the one to proclaim that i am owed while there are children starving in foreign countries who would thank God morning, noon, and night just for the simple luxuries of life if they were in my place. So thank you for my fuzzy sweater and my warm house and caring family and school that wants me to learn and friends who good people and little stalkers who are sweet, and chocolate teddy grams...and...blogs...and...livejournals...and naps... and the chance to take a class as hard as AP euro. and... thank you. and i know i dont deserve it, but please can i spend some time with a girl i miss dearly and love like crazy? it would make my week. it would make my lent jar. i would be thankful. please consider it. thank you.

      okay, so today i was writing emily a note in euro during our movie and michele looks over and...when she was knew i was aware that she had noticed the "emily-" at the top, she unexpectedly said: "its futile" and i dont think i said anything...just a thoughtful, determined silence...but i looked at her to acknowledge her comment "does she ever write back?" "no" "you know, ill bet somewhere up in heaven theres this big pile of all the good things amanda does for emily" and there might have been a bit more to that conversation but i dont remember it.  i hardly said anything. i almost told her i didnt care if it was futile and that i only truly fail if i give up, but i didnt. silence is good too, sometimes.  it was kind of depressing though...cause here i was...all decided that i wouldnt be too sad that i couldnt see emily tonight, because i was gonna call her and talk to her on the phone for a while...and that would be good in its own way. after all, its not the action of us going somewhere to do something that i care about, its talking to her. and phones help with that. too bad she never gets online anymore. and so i was writing this note to her and being all....not mopey.... and being constructive and thinking positive and trying to do all i can to fix everything and....and...all that. but then out of nowhere micheles like "you know, its not going to help" and what?!? nononono. dont tell me that. i mean, her opinion doesnt motivate me to give up or anything, but... it kind of made me sad. though she did say the bit about God keeping track of all the things i do to try and be a good friend to emily, so maybe that balances out the negativity of the first comment... if shes going to praise my efforts that would mean she thinks its good that i keep trying at it, right? i dunno, man, i dunno...   You think God smiles on my efforts at being a good friend...however fruitless?   i dunno...just...an interesting interaction....  and i wish they werent so negative on emily... be a little understanding--im trying to be. she has her own life. she has a right to be concerned with her life...gotta deal with your life before other peoples'. stuff like that. i dunno. she doesnt mean to hurt me....and its not her that ever does...its lack of her. you know? i dunno. i dont understand what she does sometimes, and i dont always like it, but i respect her waaaaaaaaaaay too much to be mad at  her  for this unpleasantness. shes still a good kid. if she wasnt, i woudlnt care so much about seeing her. and she deserves her sleep. and her boyfriend. and maybe not her homework, but she deserves to take what accelerated honors ap crazy hard classes she wants and be as busy as she can stand if it makes her happy. so lets not hate emily because amanda misses her and never gets to see her. hate her schedule and her desire to be busy, but dont hate her.  not that anyone does...but... i dunno.   and i dont know ho much sense this makes anymore cause im really tired and im going to bed.  since she was sleeping when i called tonight, i think im gonna call tomorrow just to talk and propose the journal idea. heres hoping it is well received.

      occasionally when ive brooded about the subject for an extensvie period of time, or when ive grown sick of thinking about it or when im just frustrated...especially after a study hall of worrying and i see emily in the hallway on her way to english when im going to meet jessica... i have the strongest urge to hug the life out of her. i mean...not just "hi emily!" *hug*... like... "Oh! iloveyouiloveyouiloveyou! i dont ever want to lose you!" holding on to her so tight like i could keep us from drifting apart if i never let go...like my grasp alone could keep everything from falling to pieces... and just stand there stuck like that for a long time (or what would seem like a long time when you rush up to someone and take them by surprise and with such intensity during passing periods) until i reassured myself that when i relaxed my grip she would still be there and we would still be friends and still in highschool with 2 and some years left to reapply the cement between our souls.   but then again that would probably freak her out....and it would freak out the other people in the hallway... and i dont have enough courage to do something crazy like that... or, at least, i havent been worried so intensely and i havent had emotions running so high during study hall to rev up my adrenaline for that kind of insanity. plus it would be weird cause im not really a random hug kind of gal. and with my luck id probably end up knocking both of us to the floor, with me on top of her....and then that would just be a really uncomfortable situation. and what do you say after that? "um...sorry... i was kinda going for one of those crazy passionate, intense hugs...but i was a little off." riiight.   it is for these reasons and more i cannot think of that i have never executed such a gesture of affection, though i have on many an occasion felt everything inside of me jump towards her (referencing pervious entry) and ive ignored it because...you cant just go around doing everything you feel like all the time. i dunno.   maybe some day i should just have a day of doing whatever i feel like when i feel like. just a day. and if i felt like saying something i normally would have kept to myself, then ill say it. and if i feel like hugging the life out of emily, then i will. and if i feel like drawing during class when i should be taking notes, tehn im gonna draw. and if i feel like swearing, i will. and if i feel like telling the blatant, ugly, not polite, socially incorrect truth, then i will. and people will have to deal with it because it will be my special day.   see? this is one of those entries i cant put on the othe blog. i really dont want anyone and his brother reading it. id like to spare most people from knowing im crazy like this.   and now i have to go finsih passage to india reading. stupid blog and its time consumsion.

      i am sitting in my chair facing the window watching the sun set without my glasses on leaning against a blanket tuning out the sounds of "that seventies show" from downstairs and ignoring that nagging feeling that i should do my homework because i cant help but wish with all my heart... over and over again... that we could be cool, totally awesome friends again and i wouldnt have to care so much when i couldnt see her... because we would be close enough and talk often enough that it would be like hanging out with her every day. and the sun would shine every day and it would be a perfect 72* with a tropical breeze and there would be no war and no homework and no insensitivity between people and... and the homeless would have homes. and everyone would recycle. and... the world...my world...would be a much more peaceful place if this emily pasch character and our narrator were friends like they used to be.   you know...monica had this thing on her profile once...about what she would wish for if she had one wish...and how she wants very much to help the world...but there are times....there are times when it gets to you and you might just take those tickets.  its kinda like taht with me and my one wish. cept i dont want to go to romania.   sigh.  i guess i just ought to remind myself its worth it....its always worth it. so suck it up and wait it out.  and do constructive things along the way. hmm...constructive things... i wonder waht i should do....  and for some reason i think im mad at eric. i dont know why... but the last couple times anyones mentioned him or ive though about it its kinda been like "oh,  eric ..." *rolls eyes*. i wonder why im mad at him? maybe for his lent suggestion... maybe cause im jealous...maybe.... saturday? ah, who knows...  that was something else i was going to tell her: 6 people!  and 18 words... i wanted to know what those 18 words were  i should make a list of these things. is that constructive? hmmm....study hall tomorrow.  a month and five days till i get my questions. 36 days. im counting down. i want those.

      Well... talked to pasch... *sigh* Lets just say i didnt get the answer i wanted. She has a family reunion during some of the days wed be gone  and  she doesnt...i dont want to say "she doesnt want to go" because the way she talking about it... it was more like an "i feel like i shouldnt go" which i guess means she doesnt want to go since thats how she feels... but it was more of... i dunno. she wouldnt exactly tell me why she wasnt going to go either. I think the best i got out of her was "it doesnt seem right" or something like that. which could mean lots of things and she couldnt explain. Which i  think  means she didnt know how to explain, as opposed to just not wanting to explain. So that sucks. Because i miss her and i wanted some more of that stars and pool and truth or dare and movie stuff. That was so peaceful. I could really use some peace. And we could be somehwere where it would just be me and her and there wouldnt be other friends or boyfriends or school or anything to make me jealous or to take her time or to take my time or to annoy me or... it would just be me and her.       And thats another thing...ive kind of decided (actually i think i decided this a while ago) that Emily and I are only good friends outside of school and away from most other people that we know...especially eric. Or i only feel like we're actually good friends then. Because then there arent all these other people talking to her to remind me "i have lots of best friends" and because then there isnt homework and school to be taking her away from me... and then... she's not erics boyfriend, shes not liz's friend, shes not 20468, shes not mattucci's student, shes not a distance runner, shes not a clarinet in honor band first.... she can be amanda's friend first. sort of. i dunno. i guess its more of a feeling kind of thing. which is one of the reasons whenever i want to do something with her, id much rather do it alone. I mean, first of all, cause if emilys the one i want to talk to, why bother with other people? and more people means less time talking to emily and more people means i cant say anything i want to her, and more people means more people to remind me im just one of lots of friends. and thats why its hard to talk to her at school too. so that makes calling worth something. which ive definitely started doing more so now. But, hey, if shes never going to get online and never going to email me and i hardly get to see her at school...then howthe heck do i ever talk to her if i dont call? yeah, thats right, i dont.     but anyway. i wanted all that time to spend getting to know her better... but... after begging (which i did  not  want to do but always end up doing because i want these things sooooooooooo much i forget i have any dignity) and trying to get a better reason for her not going for like an hour and a half, she had to go and then i called caitlin...      i really wish she had more explanation though. because... its like... i know she's not saying no just to be mean and hurt me cause she knows its i want it so badly. but... if all i have "it just doesnt seem right"...then i dont understand well enough why she is saying that... and it makes it hard to deal with. i need....i dont want to say i need a "good enough" reason, because thats too subjective, but... i need... an understanding of her reasoning before i can have a decent answer for "and what makes it worth denying me what i want so badly?" you know? its like...when your eally really really really want something and you arent allowed to have it and you ask why and all you get is "Because." gee, that makes it real easy to just accept, doesnt it? but if maybe there was a good reason you could understand why it was more important that you not get what you want?      or maybe im asking her to tell me why its fair that its so hard to be good friends with her no matter how much effort i put into it? and i dont think anyone can really answer that...  and here we go with the scarring...  i swear, this whole thing this year has like... damaged me. i hope everythings okay in the end.   i dunno...  i did ask caitlin though. and she can go. and i dont doubt that caitlin and i will have fun. we will. ill have a good time. she will too. i know she'll really appreciate it. i probably dont sound sincere but i am. i just... i dont know. i miss emily. and i want that...whatd i call it? "safety"...sure...  but....aside from that disappointment...which i guess i can blame on the reunion thing cause maybe she wouldve changed her mind had that not be an issue... emily and amanda are going to have an awesome summer. And i dont know if she'll promise me, but she sort of has said yes she's gonna do lots of stuff with me this summer and i hope to get her to say so in a more convincing way... but... yeah.   so the constructive thing ive been doing instead of brooding about her not going to arizona (Which...another reason why thats bad...it proves my parents right in their minds because they said she probably wouldnt want to go... althouth the real reasons she doesnt want to vs. why they think she doesnt want to arent the same) is trying to make other plans for the summer/future...try to still keep moving with teh whole taking advantage of summer thing.  so i was trying to come up with as many cool things we could/should do over the summer as i could...my list so far: -Take her to Winfield if she wants to go (i think this would be great fun) -Great America (not just her though...a bunch of people) -Field Museum (preferably just her but...well see) -lots of sleep overs! at least one where we stay up  all  night because i miss those -Woodlawn in the rain, although thats kind of a whilestillinschool kind of thing. but whatever. -lots of truth or dare games -mini golf? -heather suggests goign to the chocolate factory -going to get ice cream! this can be repeated several times -picnic? -JFK health world -the whole...church thing.... -firefly catching -sidewalk chalk drawing -...  i dunno. i need more stuff. suggest some more things.  and i gotta go to bed now. but ill write some later.  since this...no emily in arizona thing... other peopleve been annoying me a lot. one of those things where its like "shut up...i dont want to talk to you...why is it i have all this time with you when the people i  really  want to talk to are so far away?" and i kind of did that with friends too....which... ah, i dunno.   i really wanted to do one of those crazy hug things the day after i talked to her about tucson...just like...a "okay, fine, but please tell me it wont always be like this. please tell me you'll talk to me a lot over the summer and you'll do lots of fun things with me and we'll be great friends." ....but then she wasnt there before school...nor was she there after band cause apparently she missed 1st for whatever reason which i was gonna askher about but forgot. i always forget to ask her about things. never talk to her.  :'( and i didnt see her after schoool. so...not really a good opportunity. and i suppose i had a chance today after school but... i dunno, the mood had passed a little.  i gotta call her tomorrow. havent talked to her on the phone about nothing in a while. not for lack of trying, of course.  but i really should sleep now. so goodnight.

      somebody asked me where the changing rooms were the other day when i was at Abercrombie and Fitch cause they thought i worked there. that was funny. especially considering i wasnt wearing anything from abercrombie that day. i did, however, know where the dressing rooms were.  i think its that aura of responsibility pang was talking about. ha.   yeah...so i talked to my mom about taking emily. *gulps loudly* ...that...did not go well. i knew it wouldnt. it didnt go  horribly  because i havent been forbidden from taking her. there was, though, the anti-emily talk. sigh. not so much anti-emily, though, i guess... as...trying to look out for me. Its totally my mom, though. and...i really dont feel like explaining the whole conversation...but it basically ended with "go ahead and ask her, but just understand why we're a little concerned" sigh.  am i the only one in the world who would, having lived through the last year never seeing her enough, still love this girl? that cant be. Gosh, sometimes it feels like the whole world is pushing me away from her, whispering into my ear "you know, you should hate her. what has she done for you this last year?" you know what? shut up! shut up, mom. shut up, world. i know what im doing. you think id still be trying if it wasnt worth it to me? You think id waste all this time and energy on her if i didnt care...i mean, really care? Maybe i do! maybe its not that im stupid and i dont get it and im letting her take advantage of me... mabye she just really is busy all the time and doesnt have much time for getting together with any of her friends, let alone me. Sure she sees and talks to other friends and her boyfriend more than she sees and talk to me, but thats not because shes purposely avoiding me, its cause those are the people she happens to see a lot at school.   grrr... i hope she can go not only cause i want to spend time with her, but so i can spite my mother.  and i gotta wait till after confirmation to call her and ask her. out to dinner now.

      Guess who got to hang out with Emily today! wooo. happiness abound. it was too short though. :'(. damned "Tenebrae" church thing. oh well. i need to talk to that girl more often, man. and i dont mean talk about real, deep things... i mean talk about completely unimportant trivial life facts. random conversations about nothing. like we used to all the time. because that stuff is necessary too. and its easy. and its comfortable. i definitely think i ought to make myself a rule about calling her every saturday. unless shes on vacation or something. and even if im on vacation. because arizona shouldnt count.   and speaking of arizona. i think ive made my decision. in light of said recent activities. in light of the fun had. in light of my calm, happy mood. in light of the wanting more.  my parents may not like it, but its not their choice.  but who knows if she can go? we'll see...we'll see... i'll hope... i'll hope.

I just have to make sure i finish this cause i dont want to be writing an essay tomorrow during lunch. blegh! not on my birthday. Its okay though, cause for once its a pretty easy essay. woooooooooo easy essay. i slept for like 3 hours after school today which is why im still up writing this essay cause i didnt actually have that much homework...i should have done it earlier and then gone to bed early, but oh well. i got up at like 7:30  and ate dinner and started "working" at 8. haha. I'm so excited though, man. I dont want any presents though. Not from my friends. their love is the best present of all! my family can get me stuff cause they feel obligated to and i guess tehres some material stuff i sort of want.. but i dont want my friends to buy me anything. i just want those questions. actually, to tell the truth, what would i want if i could have anything for my birthday? to be closer to emily! but nobody can exactly give that to me, not even pasch. questions are sort of in that vein though. and so is doing something on friday. and so is getting that journal back. so any of those things i guess are great presents. i can deal with balloons i guess...just not a million of them. im afraid of carrying a million balloons/extra thigns around.  oooh, and i have drivers ed free tomorrow. forgot about that. woo.   thanks in advance, guys. cause im sure ill have a great day tomorrow.  and now i should work on my euro...

      So school is almost over! Crazy! I can't believe it. There were so many times when this year seemed like it would never, ever, ever, ever end. but its almost over. and summer's almost here. summer with its freedom. from school and from homework and work in general and from never being able to see emily! Im soooo looking forward to that. seeing emily often. cant wait, cant wait, cant wait.       so lets see... this week has been pretty good...in that last week of school kind of way. I had a lot of homework last night, but i conquered it. Wrote an in-class essay today that i was satisfied with. Lost my watch though. :'(. hopefully voelker still has it. and...hmm...we got yearbooks. despite what some people say, i like the ones this year better than last year. At least in terms of cover. I gotta  figure out when im signing emilys yearbook...hopefully i can take it home. but i dunno what she wants to do about mine. we'll see i guess. And i gotta get soooo many people to sign my yearbook tomorrow! i only have a few and i gotta get like a million more of my good friends cause ive been lazy and putting it off. And...hmm...      today i didnt have any homework and that was nice...so i went out to dinner with caitlin. we went to benigans. good times. and...hmm...chem shirt day tomorrow! wooooo. cant wait. They are truly awesome shirts.  hmm...wow...not a whole lot to say, actually. i might go see shrek 2 tomorrow ith caitlin and lingus. i want to see troy. maybe my mommy will take me? itd be cool to see pasch again too...cause thad be like 3, maybe even 4 weeks in a row. which is CRAZY. but definitely in a good way. oh well. at least, there will be calling.     ooooh, and i gotta figure out about the assembly tomorrow too. crazy crazy assembly. hmmm...  i think im gonna go now...ill write more later. i promise.

      so...thinking about disney...  i wanna get people stuff from disney. cause disney is awesome! ill get me a keychain and a hat and various other items that i shouldnt spend my money on but will... but what should i get for my friends? perhaps those hats, depending how much they are... not for emily though... since... hmm... i guess i have a while to think about it.    im going to bed. goodnight.

      So i did succeed in getting Emily to come over. yay! That was fun...what with the Life and yearbooks and general talking and all... that was nice. I love that girl. :-D. I dunno what it is, I dunno... but i definitely still like her better than (most?) other people. life is crazy like that i guess. with the not explaining to you why you feel certain ways... but thats okay. And i like this "coming over" concept... as opposed to spending forever trying to come up with something to do. perhaps i shall make use of this this summer. that will mean i have to clean my room thuogh....hmmm...  But you know what else i decided? If she and i only talked on a fairly regular basis we could still be really really crazy close. its not that any major change in either of us is keeping us apart or anything, its just...we need to talk more. and no classes/few classes/no mornings/big long list i could continue forever...makes it hard for us to talk a lot. so thats what im hoping for this summer. that we talk a lot. often. i want to have an amazlingly fun summer. with photo. and caitlin. and vacation. and Emily. and life in general. i hope, i hope, i hope. no big, bad shs to really get in the way too much.  and i love thunderstorms and im scared to drive on monday. test. yikes.  and...wow...so tired. i cant think if want i wanted to say on here...  i guess the main thing was to express my contentedness cause of seeing emily. yay. i love Emily. :-)

If you love anyone, and I mean you can say "I love you" without cringing a little on the inside because you know it's not absolutely true beyond a doubt... then you love them unconditionally. Because, although love can arguably have many faces, love...in its pure, elemental form is the only kind of love that deserves to be called love. Infatuation is not love. Lust is not love. Fear is not love. Familiarity is not love. Fondness is not love. None of those are even types of love. Love oughtn't to have types! Save, perhaps, the distinction between romantic love and nonromantic love. Because i do believe you can love someone with all your heart and soul and yet have no desire to kiss them passionately in the pouring rain. But i think if you love anyone, and have any right to use the word love, then by definition you love them unconditionally. Because what is love with limitations? I love you except when you get on my nerves? I love you only when you tell me i'm beautiful? I love you only if you'll let me cheat on you? I love you only on Tuesdays? I love you only when you're in a good mood? I love you only when Im in a good mood? What is that? You ought to love someone always, even when you feel like you never want to see them again...you still ought to close your eyes and look past all that anger deep inside your heart and know with certainty that, no matter how much you dislike them right now, its nothing compared to how much you really like them for everything they are. For everyting they are! When you love someone, you're supposed to love them for everything they are! And isn't that, in itself, unconditional love? I love everything you are, no exceptions? If you love anyone, and love them without a conscience driven "but..." you love them unconditionally. Don't you? Doesn't "unconditionally" mean in good times, in bad times, in sickness, and in health, for richer or poorer? Doesnt "unconditionally" mean you love them when youre happy, you love them when youre sad, you love them when they make life wonderful, you love them when they drive you crazy, you love them when you're their world, you love them when theyre upset with you, you love them when they're with you, you love them when you're apart?      Id venture to say love doesn't always last, because life gets in the way. But doesn't a part of you always love them anyway? Despite life? Despite how hard you try not to?  I dont know... im no expert. I dont pretend to be... i just... was thinking. About why it's so hard to be mad at Emily...actually.   but anyway. leave me some comments. perhaps ill post this on lj too. Just cause i havent put anything on there in a while

      i changed my template. yay. havent quite figured out how to get my links up though. im working on it. and i mean to post a picture at some point. and fix my description. here at Yellowfuzz13's deep thoughts, we're getting a makeover.      in honor of my recently clensed soul, as well. or something. In honor of my acceptance as in integral part of the Catholic Community. with a capital C. ha...something like that.       yeah, so i got confirmed today. It was fun. The bishop was nice. Not some old fogey like i expected. He  did  have a shiny gold ring on his pinky though...which made me think of Luther and Catholic Church monetary power abuses and all that reformation/euro stuff. But he was still nice. So maybe he deserved his ring. And he wore a cool red robe that looked like id be fun to wear. and his pointy bishops hat. ha. And...lets see... i got to do the big important job of lighting my row's candles. stupid open door almost blowing out my candle. And...Father Ron had to tell me to blow out my candle when the bishop started to come over to talk to me cause i was confused because i thought i had to blow it out but i looked around and no one else was blowing their out and i turned to Michele and i was like "am i supposed to blow this out?" and shes like "i dunno" so i didnt and then...he whispered "you can blow out the candle"... so i did. and...yeah. damn being first. oh well. got it over with quickly. And i got annointed with some fancy oil on my forehead. its still there, actually. mmm, fancy oil. holy oil, actually.      and...mmm...it was funny when my aunt/sponsor Libby confessed that she could only say the Hail Mary in spanish because it was just like automatic and it was weird and took thinking-through to start saying it in english. Apparently she prays all prayers only in spanish except the Our Father which she forced herself to learn in English. haha. funny to me. Crazy Spanish.       And i got 2 new rosaries. and a watch. and a book. and some jewelry. and...a keychain? i dunno, its not important what i got.       And i saw laurie there with Eric! aw, that was so cute. haha. You think Eric would go to Emilys confirmation if she was getting confirmed this year? i dunno. It'd be weird to have my boyfriend there with my parents and grandparents and all... i guess itd be weird to have a boyfriend in the first place. i cant imagine so many things related to that.      And im really tired and i soooo dont want to go work on our chem project tomorrow and i soooo dont want to do all the million pieces of homework i have. like those 2 essays. arg. i should force myself to do at least one of them this weekend. maybe the spanish one? oh, bah. well see. i wonder if i ever took my english stuff home? i hope so.       And i hope i get to do something with Emily next weekend or at least talk to her on the phone for a while. Then again, when am i not hoping to talk to her? Gosh...i could talk to that girl for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and days... and not get sick of it. Thats why id be perfect to take her to Tucson! but...alas.      Maybe that should be my goal this summer... to see if i can ever get sick of her. When ive talked to her so much im tired of it...then...ironicly...i can celebrate. With party hats and streamers and cake and everything. Minifiesta. And there will be much love. and happiness. abound.      I'm such a loser. I need a life. This is my life? this is what i write about on my blog? ha... im so weird. oh well... ill blame it on chemicals. Seeing emily engouh and talking to her often enough stabilizes some sort of chemical balance in my brain. Without that contact--> imbalance---> :'(. Damned chemicals.  right.  actually...f**k chemicals...love isnt chemicals! i refuse! my soul loves her soul. ha. eat that, science. *does show-off-y dance with fingers and girations*  anyway...  im going to bed. Goodnight, world. Goodnight, God. Goodnight, Emily. Goodnight, everyone who wishes i would individually mention them, because they probably deserve it for one reason or another but im a jerk and only mention Emily cause i like to think she's "special". Goodnight.

      this is driving me crazy... my moms reading this book called "my sister's keeper" which involves a 13 and 17 year old, both sisters, i believe..well, i could tell you the whole story cause my mom told me, but nobody cares... whats creepy is that the picture on the cover (of the two girls) freaks me out in a "nostalgia" kind of way. if you know what i mean. which you dont. Actually, it makes me think of Emily in a...nostalgic for the summer before freshman year kind of way. which is creepy for one because...why does that cover remind me of emily? and 2) stop thinking about Emily! so anyway...why does it remind me of emily? i think cause she has/had (havent seen her wear it yet this spring) a shirt like the one girl does on the cover and the other girl sort of kind of looks like emily a little... or...like she used to look... like she could look if she was 13 again? sort of? the hair's close... and... the nose a little... and... gosh, i dunno. and theres this "soft" thing going on...and...remember the "angelic moments" talk on livejournal? yeah...  wow, im crazy.

      Since when do i need something to talk about? Can't i just want to talk to you? Can't i just want to do something with you without having anything i want to do?  why do you need a reason? how 'bout cause youre my friend? and i wish i could talk to you more? and i love you like crazy? sounds good enough to me.     and i probably shouldnt write this on here cause people'll think im mad or that i got yelled at or whatever and neither of those are the case, just... yeah. life's too busy sometimes for 2 people to be as good of friends as theyd like to be. i wish that wasn't true. but...life cant always stay busy. theres summer... there're breaks... there are weekends...   i dont know where im going with that. I want to do one of those crazy hugs though. i seriously do. before schools out... or maybe before school starts next year. whichever turns out to be a more realistic goal. maybe the last day of school this year? like in a celebratory, determined way? like.... "we made it... and things could be so much worse and theyre not and i love you and we have the whole summer to stay just like this...nice and close." or...thats bad wording, but you get the jist. and then we will go to the zoo!  and take crazy pictures.  and be cool friends. :-D.  and i need to write a spanish essay... but first...perhaps i shall eat some corn?

      To life: You see this? Look at this! I could be happy! All it takes... all it takes, man... It's not impossible. How unreasonable is that? Please? Do me a favor and make this a trend?   "oh brawling love, oh loving hate"     And on an unrelated topic... i will be changing my template soon, as blogger has revamped itself and new ones are available. Hold on to your hats. *savors mental image of Indiana Jones*     (sorry, unrelated to post, but i need more pictures on this)

      im in a pretty good mood. i didnt have  that  much homework tonight. so i am happy. i need to study for euro... and i probably should be working on my math review sheet...but...*sigh* i like my free time when i can get it.      so im also sort of in a randomly good mood. dunno whats up with that. maybe cause im not feeling like i miss emily a whole lot at the moment? cause...wrote in that journal last night...kinda feels good to talk about random life things...and i know she'll read it. and...i have hope cause aps are almost over and track is almost over and... maybe i can get some of my eventuallies. and...oh, i cant wait for school to be over so i can hang out with emily (during the shortest summer of my highschool life. convenient, huh?).       and...my my...what am i to do about this party thing? i  wanted  to have one... but... life got in the way. you know? too busy.   so even though im a good mood... certain people were annoying me today. in that...way that they always do. in the "why arent you someone i WANT to talk to!?!?" which genearlly happens when a) i miss those  certain  (cough, cough) people a lot, or b) when im happy about things with those certain people and have been reminded why i like them better than others  i guess its kind of lose, lose for most people. im sad? you lose. im happy? you lose. sorry, boys.  im crazy, i know.  haha, so want to know what im amused by? im amused by myself...the fact that i can take pride in saying i dont weigh enough to give blood. cause last time i weighed myself was a while ago... like middle of the summer? and i weighed like 106 or something? and i dunno...i guess i was just being pessimistic and assumed i gained weight...especially after seeing peoples' licenses and gaining secret weight information. (cackles maniacally) but no. i weigh 107! woooo. even after all that cake and ice cream and pie. ...or maybe that hits me later? well, we'll see.   i shouldnt be proud of that, because im still not in very good shape(/as good as id like to be) as evident from my achey feet from the walk yesterday. and i shouldnt care about weight in general because what does it matter? im healthy. dont be a stupid body-image obsessed teenager, amanda. yeah, yeah...id like to think im really not.  for whatever reason though, it makes me happy to know i dont weight enough to give blood.   and...okay, i should go do my english homework and im emilys away message.

      yeah, sorry. either theres nothing interesting going on or too much fun going on to bother taking a break to type about it.      so how's life going since the last time i updated? hmmm... i gave emily her colorforms. they were appreciated, i think. in that "you're crazy to have bothered" kind of way.     oh, the wednesday before last cait and i sold raffle tickets for her volleyball team. that was fun. i met danny (see? i learned his name!) and found out rob's gonna be a supersenior and... showed caitlin my sponge dinosaurs. and...we sent a postcard to conan o'brien demanding the walker texas ranger lever back. and... then kara and i went to the mall... and did nothing. and i got a cool oscar the grouch shirt. and... i stopped by woodlawn on the way home just to walk around and think for a bit. then the cop car came and i felt suspicious and i left. and then mrs. juster was over and home and her and my mommy were gossiping loudly and i think they had a little too much wine...     Heather and i went out to lunch that friday. That was fun. good to see heather. and we got new library cards! highlight of my day!!! and i checked out the knights book to research that head bashy thing.       and... then... i didnt really do anything that weekend, i dont think? i dont remember. oh, i went to see Troy on sunday. good movie, good movie. Bloom is soooooooooooo hot. *melts* i want him.      and then... hmm.. we started environmental portraits so on tuesday i took pictures of caitlin and Emily and almost got ice cream from the ice cream man and saw emily's saxophone and...some other stuff. found out you cant play the saxophone lying down...or at least emily wont. nor will she put a book on her head. for reasons beyond my comprehension. and after that... i went to go take pictures of the country medows playground equipment. for shadows and reflections redo. that was okay.     and... i developed my shadows and reflections stuff...A- and B. might redo the B one if i have extra time this week. we shall see. and... i develpoed some of the cait and Emily ones for enviornmental portraits. i have a cool cait one and an okay emily one. I developed and awesome one of emily playing the saxophone and i colored the sax and it looks awesome and we practiced mounting so i mounted it and gave it to her. yay. plus some other practice ones i didnt end up using.      and... yesterday i gave her those. and tried to get her to sleep over after sailing but she wounldn't and then i tried not leaving her house until she agreed but then i had to go otherwise i wouldve been late for sailing. i was late, actually. but... not horribly. that was...uh...interesting. she's right... i am like a five-year-old. but am i supposed to act like i dont care when its something i want soooo much? i guess im supposed to act like an adult. but can't i act like a child when i love her like a child? in that unconditional...safety...kind...of way... i dont know what im talking about. but it makes sense to me.      anyway..then i went sailing. that was fun. very fun. cool times. good to talk with lauren and emily cause i havent in a while. theyre cool kids. and...then we went to taste of chicago which is something ive always wanted to do but never have. that was awesome. delicious! food is yummy. i got yelled at for taking peoples pictures though. which was actually very amusing.   and...i dunno.  today i went to get bagels. mmmmmm, bagels. and i called emily. ive called her every day for a week + 1! hehehe. poor mrs. pasch probably rolls her eyes every time she hears me say "hi, can i talk to Emily?" but thats okay. mrs. pasch and i are cool. ha... probably less so now that i keep dropping by. but oh well. i think she liked my photos.   and then i went to target and bought stuff for my awesome party on wednesday! woooo, party.  aaaaaaand... then i took some pictures of heather for photo. weee. and now i think im gonna go start my movie...

      Okay, so my computer's been virused-up for most of the past week and my laptop's been acting funny...but in a battery-life sort of way. So i havent been online much or posting much. or emailing much. but now my daddy killed the evil virus so we're good. Let see...this has been a pretty good week. I got my license...summer school started and photo is fun. My teacher is cool. And im making some new friends. yay! i took most of my pictures for my fragmentation project today, i have about 4 subject left to come up with tomorrow...unless i want to shoot 2 rolls...but we'll see how it goes. another good thing about photo: hardly any homework! im loving it. cause i acutually get to do stuff after school. unlike with world history. but that was  completely  different. especially with the Emilyness of it all.       so what other fun stuff did i do this week? i went to liz/sam/cathy/whoever's party on tuesday after i got my license and then cait and emily and i went to the mall for a little (very little) bit and hung out and i found out where bookids is. and i got a yummy cookie. wednesday i didnt do much, i drove to school for the first time alone. after school i slept and eventually ran to dominicks to get a new camera battery and pick up some cool mini/emergency stuff for the car. and visited heather on the way home. :-D. thursday i got lost coming home from einstein but its okay cause now i know how to get to city park! and i got jamba juice. and i went to jimmy johns (surprisingly tasty) and then to see starsky and hutch after school with cait and kara and rita. i picked up kara at her dads, drove to buffalo grove theaters, and dropped kara off at her moms. i didnt know how to get to any of those places. but i lived. and kara didnt laugh at me  too  much. friday i got caribou on the way to school cause my mommy got me a caribou card with like 30 bucks on it. wooo. then i came home and called emily to find out what we were doing and then i slept and then i called her again to figure out which ice cream place we were going to and eventually we ended up at taste freeze (or however they spell it) and we had milkshakes and talked and then tried to go to the library but it was closed cause it was past hours and it was the day of mourning for reagan. so then we went to the park illegally cause i didnt have an h-pass or something so im not allowed in the park cause i dont live in lake zurich or something  and  it was past dusk. but no cops came and arrested us so we played on the swings and talked about narnia and some other things... and then we went to dominicks and walked around for an hour trying to decide what to buy and emily showed me that there are gummy bear vitamins that apparently taste really good. eventually we bought real gummy bears and a cookie on a stick for prostate cancer. and payed for it entirely in change. cause the tastefreeze man told us to. sort of. and then emilys car temporarily broke and we had to go sit suspiciously by the bank for mr. pasch to come save us (and i got extra time to talk to emily and eat gummy bears. score.) and then the car was magically fine but emily drove me home in her dads car anyway because we were all still suspicious. and this was just after she told me her dad never lets her drive his car. the irony. so im probably the only person emilys ever going to drive in her dads car. cool, huh? and then i went home and i never called my mommy to tell her that emilys car broke cause i thought she would worry unncessarily. and i still havent told her. i dont think she needs to know. right? i dont want her to be uneasy next time emily drives me.  and...what else? i shot some pictures today for my fragmentation but i already said that. and now i have to go drive see SAVED! with martha and kara and bobby. and kara called to get me to leave. so i shall. ill let you know how that goes.

      so today i got my license. weeeeeeeeee. and it was the first day of summer school. not so weeeeee, but not horrible. and i would write a long, comprehensive description of my day if i had time, but its 10:30 and i gotta get up at 6 so i dont have time. the short version: -photo was boring, cool door, mr. myers is cool -license test was nerve-wraking and i totally thought i was gonna fail but my driving dude (deryl) was SUPER nice and i love him for the rest of my life for passing me -long line though, boring, but i beat jenna! -went to crazy liz-sam-cathy-joana party. first place i drove alone with license ever: Cathy's house. (but that shouldn't count cause its not magical). party was okay. -then spent a while working out plans and evetually went to hawthorn with cait and emily. drove by myslef there (2nd place ever). was lonely. -mall was short and not long enough. found the bookstore. cait had fun in a chair. i bought a cookie. went back to caits. took too long to drive home cause i had to turn around at least 5 times, though only 2 not in cait/emily's neighborhood. i dont know if id call that a successful drive. the first two definitely were though.  -drove home successfully. emily laughed at me. got my journal back.  now im tired and must sleep and have to get up early to leave at 7:10 (!!!!!!!!) to drive to school which starts at 8:10. i keep telling my mom thats crazy and that ill have nothing to do tomorrow morning but sit all alone somewhere and listen to music like a loser. but shes being mean so its that or take the bus. *cringe*  well im out for now. more later. huzzah for the book and kyle.

      i had a dream a really really hot version of kyle pekovitch (you know how in dreams people can only sort of be who you "know" them to be in your dreams? it was kind of like that...)seduced me. with ice cubes and dancing and hugging and cologne and sexy stares and...ahh... weird.  just to be clear, by "seduced" i dont mean i dreamt we had sex. cause i didnt. i just mean he like... i dont have a crush on him or anything and i really didnt in the dream either, but i found myself thinking "i want him"... but in a "i really really want to be hugging him right now" kind of way. sort of. ah, hard to explain. but it was weird. kyle pekovitch seduced me. ha. funny.

      Things to complain about: -the martha/michele stuff. Whats with that? Martha's an ass about it. I dont understand how she can pass up being with all of us even if it means she has to spend time with michele and it has to be on her birthday. suck it up, martha. shes not evil. shes your friend. be nice. -the olivia/martha stuff. Calm down, olivia. you won't get invited to every party you want to be invited to. It doesnt mean she doesnt like you. You're not her best friend and she could only invite so many people. dont be so offended.  -Olvia or was it kara? when olivia had marshmallow on her pants and im like "what is that, marshmallow?" and shes like "no, its semen...or is it marshmallow? taste it and find out" and im like "how am i supposed to know what semen tastes like?" and karas like "Ask a guy" and then someones like "no, ask emily, she should know, right?" ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! gross. thats worse than suggesting shes...been doing that. because then youre going farther to say that shes...in...her mouth...ewwww. *cringe* not my pure, sweet, innocent emily! noooooooooo -bobby when he called emily a whore and i kicked him and he told me im too posessive and its creepy. shut up, bobby. i didnt like your tone, alright? i know you werent serious, but it was weird and you dont know her well enough to joke about it knowing for sure that shed never do it, so don't say anything. and expect me not to...uh..."defend her honor" -Bobby and Olivia teasing me and telling me to go run up to emily and greet her when she came back from babysitting. "Go. Go. Run, you know you want to. its so hard to resist." Shut up, guys. I guess i dont mind olivia so much because i get the feeling she likes to tease me, but she still respects me and how i feel about Emily. But bobby...i dunno...i dont get no respect from him. He just doesn't understand... not that anyone really does, and i dont expect them to...but...i dunno, whatever. leave me alone, alright? do i love her? yes. was i glad she came back? yes. did i want to talk to her right away? yes. am i going to run up to the car and make a fool of myself? mmm...i think you gotta pick the kind of stuff youre gonna be crazy about like that. Run after her when she's coming to talk to you anyway? Run after her when kara's already doing it? Run after her in front of a bunch of people who know we're friends but don't know the specifics? Run after her when im fairly content about Emily things and i just got to see her and im gonna get to see her for another few hours? mmm... i dunno if thats quite hte running-after set up. After APs, however...yeah. I did run after her then. But thats cause she was walking away, no kara or anyone else, i wasn't gonna get to talk to her until monday, probably... i wanted to know how the test was for her and what questions she did...we had just finished the hardest class of the year and part of her aps were over and part of her free time restored and that means more time for me and of course im happy about that. and its an empty hallway and i didnt have anywhere to be for a while. i dunno, theres a difference. i dunno why the bobby/olivia thing bothered me so much... just dont make fun of me for something i care a lot about, k?  Things to be happy/amused about: -michele didn't find out! hahahaha. we have a secreto. jajaja. -67 notes! -i burned for emilylessness and related feelings/issues. that felt good. -riding in Emilys car when she pulled in. hehe. -talking with heather who i never see anymore -nice summer weather  Just...things: -my dreams...and the emily-hugging business. really gotta get to that. before i explode.or forget about it.  -Feffer -Hal   mmm...i get distracted and run out of things to say. good news is that tomorrow when i get bored...i can drive!!!!  where should i drive first? i cant decide.

      So i havent been updating recently cause i was busy with 8th grade graduation and finals and harry potter and martha's party and all... and i get to go to michele's tomorrow. and...i also havent been updating cause ive been happy. and when im happy i have less of a need to complain. but summer school starts tuesday. so dont worry, loyal readers (ha, like i have loyal readers). So finals were blah. i was just like "let me outta here" all week. none of them were spectacularly hard. maybe cause i didnt have euro. hardest tests ive ever taken were in euro. crazy euro.      wednesday after school heather and michele and i had lunch at Fridays with our cute, nice waiter dude who we talked about the whole time afterwards and then we went to Oberweis (or however you spell it) for ice cream and then my mommy picked us up and i almost broke her keys and she got mad but its all okay now.      8th grade graduation was cute but kind of a waste of time cause i needed to be studying for chem. I was annoyed by the talkative people in front and behind me. And andrew got in big trouble for causing a scene. which was amusing i guess. And i got to see Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Julis and Mrs. Hayna. that was kind of fun. Aw, woodlawn... i had some great times there.      On thursday i had chem and spanish and chem wasnt murder, but wasnt easy, and spanish, of course, was a joke. I had excruciating cramps though...which made me really angry and made it hard to take the finals...so hard i had to go to the nurse during spanish and lie down for 20 minutes then come back and finish the final. the lying down helped a lot, actually. i was so pissed at my body for giving me inconvenient pain on my last final of the year though. bah.       Lets see...then i came home and called emily to ask her what was up with this saxophone business... and then i went to the mall... and i got some candy and a cool harry potter shirt to wear to the movie last night (albeit from Hot Topic...ewww...but harry potter. so appropriate i just had to live with the fact that it was from hot topic). and..."The Bell Jar" which i intend to read at some point...and...i thought at least one other thing but i forget. Then i came home and slept and then i went to marthas.      Martha's party was fun...got some nice time talking to people (especially emily...though i still like it better when its just me and her) and some good laughs and a fun harry potter wand which i can now not find. :'(. And we saw harry potter at midnight and it was AWESOME! i loved it. i thought it was amazing. better than the first 2. i like the new director. it had some cool moments. And now i totally wish i went to hogwarts and had a robe and all... and i really want to be a harry potter character for halloween. im thinking of going for a slytherin house member witch person. cause i dont want to be hermoine or however you spell her name. and i dont want to be a gryfindor house person cause gryfindor is the house everybody loves cause its harrys house... and i dont want to be ravenclaw or hufflepuff cause nobody cares about those loser houses...therefore, even though it is a tad evil, i think i shall be a slytherin girl. Like with a Harry Potter (R) Slytherin House Robe costume... if they sell those... i wonder if i fit in child sizes? hmmm...i could try. And i totally want a green and silver tie. And theres this cool place online that sells harry potter patches... and i want a slythin house crest thing to put on whatever shirt im gonna wear under my cloak... and i want a harry potter student hat. and...and...and... aw, thats gonna be so much money. oh well. remind me, guys, that i wanna be a slytherin for halloween. (sorry if ive been spelling syltherin wrong this whole time but i dont feel like looking it up and slytherine looks funny and thats the only other spelling i can conjure, so deal with it)      And emily woudlnt stay up late to talk with me, but its okay, i guess, theres pleanty of time for that later this summer.   And...today i came home and slept and looked at harry potter merchandise on the internet and watched Batman and galled liz to find out whats up with this party on tuesday. and... hmm...i dunno.   i gotta figure out if emily'll sleep over next weekend and when her engineering thing is and all this other stuff for planning my fantastic mr. fox summer. and the field museum and brookfiled zoo and churches and 6 flags and more sleepovers and the park and fireflies and... and..  i also intend to buy the harry potter soundtrack. to either the first or secnd film. not hte 3rd though, it was good, but hte music was somewhat unimpressive. so it should say a lot htat i liked the second one even if the music wasnt amazing to me, as amazing music is something i find key in a good movie.   and now im gonna go see if they have slytherin key chains...  muh ha ha ha ha ha ha.  i go for my driving test on monday. watch out.  i am happy. :-)  ITS SUMMER!

      So how am i?      I'm...  Excited to go to california. and DISNEYLAND! cause i'm in love with my childish side.  Annoyed with my family. Cause they're annoying.  Happy...in that "the world doesn't owe me anything" way. right now. which...is a very different feeling compared to regular happy. its better. and maybe you dont know what im talking about... but its a much more complete, rejuvinating happiness than happiness when you still feel like "life is unfair". you know? i dunno... but happy. in just about the best way possible.  Scared... because this vacation means summer's almost over. And when summer's over... I don't get to see Emily anymore. And i don't want to not see Emily anymore and i don't want to go crazy and i don't want to...hurt.  Worried/sad that i won't get an airplane note and...much more importantly...that i won't get to see Emily again before school/right after school starts. sometime around there. Which i want. So i can freak out on her and tell her im scared and hug her. hard. and a lot. and tell her i love her and hopefully she'll say something encouraging, but even if she doesnt...just telling her everything im afraid of and how much i loved this summer and how important to me it is to stay good friends and... and... everything. in person. and before anything really happens yet. just to tell her that would be comforting. and to hug her. she doesnt have to say anything. just...come...and listen...and hug me. even if she never said anything the entire time i would still feel much better afterwards. i would. And i was afraid...a little while ago... that i couldn't talk about it without crying... but... you know what? i dont care if i cry. she can see me cry. i dont have anything to hide from her. if anything, maybe the image would stick with her and...i dunno...shed be less inclined to make decissions that would result in me being sad and missing her? i dunno... something like that.  we'll see though. but im thinking maybe ill get a my good chance to hug the life out of her. and that would be nice.  ..... BUT.... i'll never get any of that if i don't  get to see her the first week of school. or around that time frame. so im worried about that.  i guess those two are kinda the same but theres the BIG FEAR and then tehres the fear i wont get to have a little more fun and comfort before THE BIG FEAR. ha... if that makes any sense at all. it doesnt even make sense to me...really...  amused... cause im talking to julie right now. and yelling at her.  heatherless...cause shes in EUROPE. ive been missing heather this summer. i love you heather!  anxious about all that homework i havent done... damn you school! *shakes fist*  the is the first time i have ever dreaded school soooooooooooooooooooo much. freshman year i dreaded it a lot... but im thinking this time its more because junior year is crappy and freshman year...well...i dunno. i take that back. this year and freshman year were the worst. i dont know which was worse. they both go back to essensially the same basic fear though... which is interesting... but im crazy dreading school.  and... i dunno. more stuff. but i need to pack for vacation so ill quickly talk about 6 flags.  we went to great america yesterday. me and emily and jenna and caitlin and kara. everyone (woodlonians) else was busy/on vacation. Marthas probably mad cause she wanted us to go with her this weekend, but im gonna be gone and karas working and emily couldnt today cause of taking jenna home...and... craziness. poor martha, but oh well. i got my great america. so yay.  jennas mom was mean though. cause she said emily could drive jenna, and then the night before she changes her mind. whats up with that? so mrs. pasch had to drive us there and my dad drove us back. less fun. but i still had a blast.  we talked about sex, drugs, and violence. i poked emily in her birth defect and called her a whore for wearing a shirt that was kinda short so you could see a very small part of her stomach. shes not a whore though. she's a good kid. and...i met jenna. shes cool. emily and jenna have the same laugh...except jennas is deeper, louder, and more evil. but they're very similar. and the quote of the night was when me, jenna, and emily (seated in that order) were on raging bull in the front row going up the thing before the big drop and i yell over to emily "we're still at war!" (i had declared war on her earlier) and she yells back "I am  not  a whore!" hahaha. you kinda had to be there or at least know who emily is (as decided at lunch today, pang). but it was hillarious. and.... i wore my sandals. which was stupid. but oh well. and.... cait and i had a blast while everyone else rode giant drop. aaaand...hmmm... i dunno. i could write more but my mom's hassling me to pack. so i should. i'll type more from tucson/LA

      so i visited my grandparents today. both sets. and my great grandma who is in the old people house now. :'(. (i prefer "old people house" to nursing home or... retirement home...or...whatever...) she seemed very happy to see us though. which is good. cause sometimes my mom and grandma talk about how she's kind of losing her... with-it-ness.&nbsp; times like these make me kind of sad i dont know much about her, though. about her life, i mean. she lived to 9...5? shes like 95 or 94 now or something and thats pretty impressive. she must've seen some cool things in life and had some awesome experiences. but i dont know much about any of that. cause when it was convenient to ask her i was too young to care. ah well... maybe someday my grandpa will tell me. or something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my dad talks funny when he talks to his parents. with his ugly, uneducated southern accent. makes him sound dumb. i dislike it. i also dislike that he has been bugging me all day because i accidentially got him regular dr. pepper yesterday instead of diet. i know, i forgot. i realized it when i got home. im sorry. but hes been yelling at me all day..."gee, i wish i had some DIET pop to go with these pretzles".&nbsp; one thing i hate about my dad is it seems like if you screw up one little thing he'll be mad at you for a week for it, but if he ever screws up anything for you, you're not allowed to be mad, because, hey, that would be making a big deal out of it. and he screws up my sandwich every f**king time at subway. every time. grrrr. and the tripod business. thats just anal. im mad at him. for the time being. hes being an ass. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so anyway. thats what i did today. went to talk to my grandparents. and quinn. quinn talked a lot. that kid...ha. and aiden was amusing himself in a way that was hillarious to onlookers. ah, little kids... theyre so cute. emily would have laughed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yesterday i filmed some movie stuff with caitlin and vicki and jessica and pang and rita. good times. especially with the behind the scenes goofing off that went on. hehe. tapes for conan! can't wait for that...&nbsp; and then afterwards cait and i went to ckp for dinner and then to barnes and noble so i could buy chocolate and then back to my house to play her game cube games since joey needed some quiet time. and then eventually i drove her home. yay.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day before yesterday...friday... i had that meeting at ritas. that was okay. we made crazy shirts for python. and i showed off my fancy swords. then i drove kara back to work and i got free cookies and had a hard time finding my way back to ritas...to find everyone had left... so then iw ent home. and watched a lot of history channel. and got bored. and called caitlin. and then went to go help her babysit joey with pang. good times, that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and... hmm...didnt really do much any other day this week. called emily a lot. but shes been&nbsp;in indiana since friday and&nbsp;till tomorrow morning. so..yay. emily comes back tomorrow! and jenna comes tuesday. yay for jenna. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; im excited. ...to meet my best friends cousin? apparently, yes.&nbsp; my life is just  that  boring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and i really really hope we can go to great america. though im getting the feeling like either 1) we wont be able to go or 2) even if we can go, it wont be a ton of fun because not everyone can go. but i dont want to wait till like 2 days before school because then everybody's busy! and im busy! and i gotta come home and do homework. whereas, now, i can just come home...and sleep. yay for sleep. (which i need to do in a few minutes)  also... fencing buddy andrew just got his license. so now hes gonna get more serious about wanting to meet with me sometime. and this weeks the only week i got left till those few precious days after vacation. should i try to coax my parents into letting me meet with him? hmm... i do have lots of other stuff to do this week as tehres filming left on the python movie and jenna and emily are gonna be around...  this troubles me because i dunno what my parents will say. and because emily seems to think andrew is creepy. is he creepy? i dunno. hes a nice guy, he really is. i should talk to pang. see what she thinks. shes an inside man on all this andrew business.  anyway, im very tired. and i want not to get up at 12 tomorrow. so im off.  ps other people seem not to like this summer because they miss their friends and never get to see them. hahahahahahahaha. i love being able to see emily. i love it sooooooooooooooo much. i dont have a way to indicate the level of my happiness due to the emily seeing ness...but trust me...its high. higher than its been in a looong time. at least since last summer. a year? its been a year? i went a year without being really happy? thats like a 16th of my life. no fair. anyway, i shouldnt get twisted pleasure out of other peoples sadness in missing their friends. but... anywyay. party on. summers not over yet. :-D

      okay, so i forget what i was either watching the news or reading the news online or...something... and they had some crazy christian fundamentalist guy explaining why there shouldnt be gay marriage and why homosexuality is wrong and some other stuff... and this one guy was like "but many people explain homosexuality as something they do not have a choice about--that's just the way they are" and the guy went off on some speech about how homosexuality isnt who they are, its what they do. and they have a choice about what they do. and that made me mad because this guy is basically telling everyone who has feelings for someone of the&nbsp;same sex to ignore them and never act on any attraction towards someone of the same sex. which is basically like denying who you are. repressing your personality and individualityl. and keeping you from loving another human being to the best of your ability. which is horrible. being gay is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide or repress. its just... who you are. because im sure if it was a choice thing...thered be a lot less homosexuals. because who wants to be gay in a world where people are gona commit hate crimes against you? er... i dunno. i just think its not a choice thing. because... ask a straight person... did they choose to be straight? could they choose to be gay if they wanted? would it work? would they be happy?

       Hey, now they got these crazy fonts and  colors and stuff check that out. amazenering.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, i thought i should post. as i have some free time waiting for eSTEVE to get out of the shower and then tell me whats going on tonight.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp;Tuesday i got myself out of fencing, but into trouble, so that wasnt so great. but i did get to watch i love the 90s. so...score? i dunno. i didnt do much on tuesday. i almost got together with emily (pasch) but not cause after she did her stuff she didnt feel like going out again or something. but i did get to talk to her and hear her talk back to me after having not done that for almost 2 weeks. which was nice. i got a new game boy game cause i recently decided im going to start actually using my game boy some more cause soem of the games i have are genuinely entertaining and i did pay good money for them at some point.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday... ah yes, Emily drove me to the library. MY library. and i returned my pirate book and we looked at the kids books and adult books and neither of us got anything and i discovered theyre selling a bag full of 12 romance novels for only $1.00! how cool is that? i told liz. shes excited. i hope one of us buys them before theyre gone. hehe. aaaaaand... hmm... emily drove me to the cool park by the mall. Deerpath park? or something? but they have this awesome playground called "Kids Castle" and it had monkey bars and so much cool stuff. and a tire swing! and emily and i...especially emily... and fun on the tire swing and got dizzy and sick. so then we played on the regular swings. and we laughed at the little kids. and then the big kids came and talked to us and we made a friend...oh, what was her name? christine? crystal? something like that... aaand... the one kid didnt believe we were 16 so we showed him our drivers licenses but he said he was older than us anyway. (and where was his license? exactly.) aaaaaaaaaand...then we went to the mall to get smoothies which werent really all that great but its okay cause we were both thirsty after the hot park and the hot car ride to the mall. and theeeeeeen... we went to kb toys to look at the little kids toys and we laughed at the new hard games and talked about toys we had when we were little and it was fun. and then we got candy from the candy store. and then i showed emily that american eagle moved a long time ago and then we argued about whether aeropostale moved or not and what happened to that corner? and then i went home and slept and then i went to fencing which was not fun but not horrible cause we fixed weapons for a while. and then on the way home i stopped at caribou and got a mint cooler or something and i saw jenna so i stopped and talked to jenna and her friend liz for a little bit. which was cool. and then i went home and slept some more.   and then THURSDAY... i didnt do much either... i figured out what was going on with great america and was happy that everybody wasnt going without me and emily still might be able to take us later. i went to the dentist. that was boring. i came home and slept. then i went to fencing and it sucked and i didnt like it. then i came home and read all quiet on the western front and watched i love the 90s from wednesday and thursday.   Friday... i got up and showered and went downstairs and found my mom looking at old pictures of me when i was little so i looked too for a little bit... and then i called emily to see if she was sleeping over or not... and then i went to deerpark and got my hair cut... and then i came home and slept. and then i called emily again. and then she said she was going to sleep over. and i was very happy. and then i cleaned my room and watched mrs. doubtfire till she came over and then we talked for a little while and listened to her los lonely boys cd cause its like the only cd shes ever bought. and then i showed her my pictures and then we played outburst and i learned julie would never play games with emily when they were little cause julie was always reading. stupid julie. and i learned... that emily doesnt really like martha. but not really. and that kara's a bad musician. (not kara kara, other kara) and...that Emily&nbsp;doesnt like evan enough to say theyre&nbsp;good friends with evan... poor evan...and that she hates julie. but not really. but i already&nbsp;knew that.&nbsp;then we listened to some more music and talked some more and i learned a bunch more stuff. and eventually we&nbsp;slept. and bob magically appeared next to me during the night.&nbsp;sounds boring, but i enjoyed it mucho.   and today we got up at 9:30 and talked some more and she went home at 11 and i let her borrow Shakespeare in Love cause apparently they have a DVD player now and i cant stand watching movies with her cause i then i cant talk to her...so the only movies i ever want her to watch are the really good ones... but those are the ones i really cant talk through or shell miss it and i want her to see it. so i didnt want to watch sakespeare in love cause i would lose 2 hours of talking aaaaaand it would probably make her sleepy. i tried to get her to watch it in tucson but she fell asleep. stupid emily. you only had to pay attention for 2 movies! bah! but its okay cause i told her to take it home and watch it. huzzah. i solved my problem. and then today i went out and bought some bagels cause i really wanted to yesterday but 22 and its closedness&nbsp;scared me. and...then...later im gonna do something with emily and heather i think. not sure whats up with that yet. but we'll find out. and now since emilys in the shower and emilys not online and heather doenst know whats up, im gonna go sleep for a little bit. or osmething. cause im tired. cause i had emily sleep over. yaaaaaay! :-D    &nbsp;  As for the important questions: one no, and one maybe. which is good.

      So im back from Arizona now and its 11 but it feels like 9 to me, so im not too tired. Cait went home a few hours ago and im alone for the first time in...a while. which is good and bad. Caitlin and i had some fun adventures with the creepy bugs and the trip to the observatory and the fireworks and the george forman grill and the many many moives and bond wars and... i dunno. fun stuff. I like Caitlin. She's a cool kid. But its been a while since i felt so much like i had a best friend...and i wasn't with her. if that makes any sense. which it might not. and i dont mean that i wasnt having fun with caitlin, cause i definitely was. but... i dunno, certain things... its....really hard to explain. i dont just mean that i was missing emily. i mean...i would just feel sometimes that, although i love Caitlin and we're close friends, its not the same. Wow, tahts a horrible explanation. sorry. suffice to say it hammered in the notion that Emily is my best friend. I don't/didn't like to think about her that way... cause... im not her best friend. im  one  of her best friends. so shes just...Emily. And that means a hell of a lot of things as opposed to "best friend" which only means one...so its a more suitible title, right? I dunno. but anyone who knows me well will understand... i have an Emily. are we best friends? well, lets not bother with all that. she's Emily. 'nuff said. and i used to think about it like that all the time. not that i would ever call you a liar if you said she was my best friend, but i...didnt like to htink about it like that. i guess. i dunno. But this trip... i dunno, it seems so much more apparent that i have a best friend. maybe Emily doesnt have  a  best friend, but i do. and... i dunno, it just seems easier to think about our friendship now in comparison to my friendships with other people...like...now its not so weird to say best friend, whearas before...well, she kind of had her own category or something. and i guess she still does. im not gonna go shouting to all the world "Emily's my best friend!" but... i dunno. just...somehow... im thinking about it differently now.  aaaaaaaaand... i was good until Tuesday. but i dont really want to talk about that here.  i dunno what to say about my trip.  my brothers annoyed me. a lot.  i really dont want to go to fencing.  i really want to see Emily tommorrow or wednesday and get on with our crazy fun summer.  cant wait to go to church. ;-)  I love Caitlin in such a different way than i love Emily. Or anyone, for that matter. I dont think you really love people more or less than other people...just...differently. but there can be quite a difference.  I love looking up at the stars. I should really get to that poem...  I hope she comes next summer.
