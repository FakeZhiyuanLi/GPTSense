      Bored! Today was another boring day. I had to wake up @ 10 this morning because I had to go out to lunch with my grandparents...that was interesting. We went to the Cheesecake Factory. The food was really good. I had Godiva chocolate cheesecake for dessert...Oh man, I'll never eat again! Lol, anyways, thats really all that happened today. Tomorrow will be a little more fun because my mom has to go to work, which mean I have partial reign of the house...hopefully my brother will leave. Oh I am so bored its ridiculous. I might have to resort to talking to Chris...oh boy.

      You may have noticed I changed the template a little here. Cool, huh? Anyways, today was exceptionally boring. Woke up around 11, ate, watched TV, showered. Then Jasmine came over around 3 to watch the Cavaliers DVD John let me borrow. That was fun. Their 2000 show is so good, its ridiculous. Seriously, we watched like 5 times because it was so awesome. Then we called Emily to see if she wanted to do anything, but she wasn't home, so whatever. Jasmine and I then decided to aimlessly walk the streets of Bloomingdale and somehow ended up at the McDonald's by the mall. So we ate and went home. Yeah and then I watched like 5 episodes of Law and Order. And so here I am. Bored and tired. Ugh, yucky. Tomorrow I'm being forced to go to lunch with my grandparents. They're going to Italy on Tuesday. They always go to really random places at really random times. Whatever. I'll have to do something tomorrow or else I think I will go insane.

      Today was actually really fun. I slept until noon, and right after I woke up, John Kasper called me and asked if he and a bunch of other people could come over to play halo. So I cleaned the whole house and showered in 2 hours, and they came over around 2. Matt Miller, Rob Pyde, John Kasper, Mike Fanizza, Kelly Kennedy, and Jasmine all came. We actually had a really good time. They stayed until like 7:30 (I know, crazy) at which point I kicked them out because Kelly and I wanted to go to the LP basketball game, which we did. Apparently the rest of them went to Mike's to play more halo. After 5 hours, they still hadn't had enough. I swear, they're like animals. It was quite interesting actually, because I sort of had a little problem with the oven when I was making pizza. Our oven hasn't been cleaned in like forever, so whenever we cook stuff, it gets really smoky. So, every time I opened the oven door, the smoke detector went off. It was crazy. Plus, John Kasper let me borrow his Cavaliers DVD. Sweet, I was excited. Anyways, it was real fun. And LP won the game too. Yay for them.

      Why do short days always feel really long? We had a half day today, but it didn't feel like one. Ugh, I am sooo tired. I came home, watched a movie, went grocery shopping with my mom and now I think I am going to go take a long nap. So Noah comes up to me in wind ensemble this morning and he's like "Congratulations, are you ready to go make out?" I was like uh....okay. It was funny. So I'm telling my friends about how I have to kiss Noah on stage in algebra, and my teacher, Mr.Zizzo was listening to our conversation and starts asking me all these questions like, How old is he?, Do you have a boyfriend?, Make out?! Is it a passionate kiss or a friendly kiss? Oh my God, I almost died right there!!! It was like, okay, stop talking please! Ugh weird. Anyways, I'm writing this piano accompaniment for One Acts, and its really coming along well. I played it for my voice teacher yesterday, and she really liked it. I've finally started writing it out, which is taking FOREVER. It took me an hour to write the first verse. Stupid finale. I wish I had something where it wrote it out as I played it. You know, like in the movie Drumline? That would be so cool. Oh well.

      I got a lead!!! Yay for me! Its double cast with Kelly, but I really don't mind, because its just so cool. I'm Hope, of course. All the female roles are double-cast, but heres the leads as I know them: Hope: me, Kelly Reuter. Reno: Courteny Hildebrand, Lizz Hansen. Bonnie: Suzie Bilek, Kim Kozeny. Billy: Noah Myrent. Moonface: Eric Zuber. Sir Evelyn: Steve Heldt. Its so awesome, band people totally dominated the leads. Theres like 5 of us, including Suzie because shes color guard. Awesome! I was soo excited, you have no idea. Plus, a bunch of my friends like Jasmine, Cathie, Laurel and other people made the chorus. This musical is going to be so much fun! I can't wait, our first cast meeting on March 4. That's really all that happened today. Yay! So yeah...I guess I'm engaged to marry Steve, but Noah is my lover....meaning I will probably have to kiss him. Lovely. And also, I still don't quite know how I'm going to work with Kelly. I don't know her very well, but from what I do know and what I have heard from other people...she's not the most pleasant person in the world. And supposedly she was mad that she had to share the part with me. We'll see how that goes.

      Pretty ordinary day. I got bitched at by Miss Alexander in gym for sitting in between 2 sets of parallel bars. I had nothing to do. Besides, I had no idea that sitting in between parallel bars was a sin that would damn me to eternal hell fire. Speaking of hell fire, Kelly Kennedy wrote this awesome article on religious extremists in the LP Perspective. Jeff and Cory got all pissed off because of what she said, and they said they were going to go to the Dean. Yeah, right. I say go Kelly. If you can piss anyone off that much with an article in your school newspaper, then you must really be talented! Lol, but really it was a great article. Anyways, I had east ensemble after school. Its really not that bad as long as we're not learning new choreography. Otherwise, its fine. I told Ms. Gibson that I wasn't going to play piano for one of the songs we're doing, and much to my surprise, she was really nice about it. She even told me I could come in early and practice on the piano in the chorus room, which I can't do anyway because I have wind ensemble in the morning, but I thought it was nice of her to offer. This is Ms. Gibson I'm talking about, too. Interesting.

      Wow. I have lot to write about today. I just did the stupidest thing I've done in a really long time. So I've been trying to get online for the longest time and it just wouldn't let me on. I tried for like an hour. I did the whole repair thing, restarted my computer, everything. Then, I realize I've been typing the wrong password in the whole time. DUH!!! Man, total blonde moment. So anyways, my day started out really well, wind ensemble was good today, and I got a call back for Anything Goes. Plus, I got a solo in Wizard of Oz! I get to sing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", which is really cool because everyone in all 4 choruses in the school got to audition for it. Nice, huh? But then, I was supposed to go to the Computer Lab for gym, but I forgot my god damn ID at home, so I couldn't go. I was sooo pissed. But anyway, the rest of my day was ok. Went to callbacks after school. Those are so much fun. I swear, that entire play is about sex! Its crazy- "All through the night, your love brings me ecstasy!" Thats a sample of some lyrics from the show. Man! I had to like snuggle up to this guy John who I was singing with. And then I had to read with Noah and he had to be all like "I love you and I want to marry you!" Oh man, it was sooo hard to keep a straight face. But I think I did an okay job. There were 4 girls who tried out for the same character I did, Hope, and I think my only competition is Kelly Reuter. My best friend, Kelly Reuter. NOT! I honestly don't know who will get it. She probably will just because she's older. Damn, I hate that. We'll see. I have to wait until Wednesday to find out, because dance callbacks are tomorrow. I want that part so bad! If God loves me.....

      And, I'm back. I was in Glen Ellyn this weekend. Meh, it wasn't that bad. I slept until like 12:45 on Saturday....oh man it was AWESOME. Michelle and I did some shopping on Friday night. I love having friends who can drive, lol. We got to go to Woodfield, it was fun. Slept most of Saturday. We went out to dinner Saturday night to Japan 77. I love Japanese food. And today...there was a Law and Order marathon on TNT for most of the afternoon, so that kept me occupied. Other than that, pretty uneventful. Tomorrow, I have One Acts until 6:30. Not cool. Besides, I know I'll just sit there for most of the time. Whatever. At least I'll get my homework done.

      Another decent day. We did absolutely nothing in wind ensemble again. In our "sectional", Richie decided to lay down behind the timpani and talk on his cell phone, so John Kasper, Pyde and I went into the hall and played a little. We had fun. Then it was off to east campus and chorale, which was cool because I got to do the solo for Somewhere Over the Rainbow, and I totally belted and it was really good. We played volleyball in gym for the millionith time, but my team was good so it was okay. We just stood there and made fun of Miss Alexander (aka Miss Piggy) the whole time, it was great. And then there was biology in which we had to make Punnet Squares until our eyes and fingers bled. Spanish was fun because we had this sub, and subs are always fun. We watched La Bamba. Finally, we get to watch a movie in English. Anyways, then came algebra, and I had a very large test, which was very easy. I think I got an A. Which I need. In English, we got to watch the Odyssey again. Fun stuff. I will be sooo glad when we're done with Greek Mythology. I hate it! After school, I practiced my duet with Laura, which is awesome. Then Dylan and I talked for like a half an hour while waiting for the bus. And that is a summary of my day. Now I have to go to my Dad's in Glen Ellyn. I've been dreading this weekend just because of how bad last week's was. Michelle and I might do something, so its all good. Call me if you wanna, I'll probably be bored: 942-0998!

      Okay, something must be wrong because today was a good day, too. Man, I'm loving this! Plus , this weather we're having is awesome! Its like 45 degrees outside, which is really warm for February in Chicago. I got my hair low-lighted on Tuesday. It looks good, but you can barely tell that I got it done, especially for paying $75. Oh man, I was watching "America's Next Top Model" yesterday. That show is hysterical! They had to go to this acting class thing, and pretend this piece of paper was a letter from someone they had issues with. They all started crying uncontrollably, and it was SO FUNNY. It was just so dramatic and overdone. It was hilarious. They took one look at this blank sheet of paper and started crying. Now that is good television, my friends. Anyways, I think thats it. I have a massive algebra test tomorrow. Yuck. Mr.Snoeck is in Kentucky, so all we do in wind ensemble is "sectionals", in which we do absolutley nothing. Its fun. Meh. So Jasmine and I are going to the Westfield Solo and Ensemble recital tonight. It well, should be interesting at least.

      Today was almost too good. I don't know, it's kind of weird. Nothing went wrong, like at all. And I'm in a really good mood, and I have no idea why!!! It feels good to feel good. Hehe. Anyways, there was actually one thing that sort of pissed me off today. So I'm walking to Spanish and Greg Abell pulls me aside and he was like " Yeah, we don't really...uh...post on the BOA forums".  And then the bell rang, making me late, so we didn't get a chance to talk anymore. The reason he said this was because I had posted a reply to someone who had posted about our director situation. And it wasn't even bad or anything, its not like I said anything anyone wouldn't find out from someone else. I've posted on the forums before and no one has ever said anything. What really makes me angry is that Greg HAS posted on the forums, and has no right to tell me not to. And seriously....there was nothing inappropriate or stupid that I said. So, in two words: Fuck off. Anywho, I went to One Acts today for the first time in a week or so because they told me that they would have blocked up to my enterance. NOT! They decided to start from the beginning again! Thanks, guys. It didn't really matter, though, because I just read someone else's part that wasn't there. And theres this super duper cute guy in the play thats real nice. And he's in a band! Say no more! He plays piano, too. He's sorta got that punk thing goin on, too. Not goth, but punk. Very sexy. So we were all talking about my song, and how I'm playing piano and stuff and he looked me right in the eye and said "That's going to be really cool." Oh my goodness, I almost melted! Lol, it was really nice. So yeah, I've sort of decided this whole thespian thing probably isn't happening this year. I'm just too lazy to do set construction right now. Whatever. Hopefully tomorrow will be as good as today!

      Today was a ton better than last weekend. I did my audition today for Anything Goes and it was really good. I have miraculously recovered from the cold that had been plauging me the past few days. I'm lucky. I'm really mad because I wanted to go to the jazz concert last night, but I'm getting my hair done, so I can't. Grr, lots of my friends are in it and I really wanted to go. Damn, that sucks. Anyways, I'm getting highlights and lowlights in my hair tonight, so it should look real cool tomorrow. I was angry today because I got a B+ on my Biology test. I was sure I was going to get an A. Yuck. Looks like my grades won't be as great as they were last semester at this time. I think I'll have 2 Bs. That really, really sucks. That's ok, I'll bring them up before the semester ends. Today in wind ensemble, Mr. Snoeck told us that Perkins left because he "didn't think he could be successful." What does that mean? There had to be a bigger reason than that. Whatever. I guess they have to redo the entire interview process again. That sounds like fun. Not.

      Okay, my weekend has officially sucked. Soooo bad. I went to John Kasper's last night. God knows I love the boys, but X-Box is just not my idea of a good time. At ALL. Plus, they're not very nice to a person like me who's only played the game like 3 times. Except John Kasper. He's my hero.  So I left after like 2.5 hours and told them I didn't feel good. Which wasn't a total lie because it was sorta true I guess. It doesn't exactly help that I haven't slept past 8:00 for the past 3 days. Yeah, so I was the BOA forums last night and this guy Zac told me to IM him. He sounds cool. Plus, I think he goes to Lincoln-Way which may or may not be a good thing. Meh, I don't have much hope in today either. I can't do anything because my Mom is at work and Emily is sick and Jasmine is grounded for not doing laundry. Yay.  Oh yeah, and I just decided not to go to set construction. Whatever. I'm one of those 'I don't care about anything' depressed moods. Someone feel free to cheer me up anytime. Anyone? Anyone?

      So John Kasper has called me like 3 million times in the last hour. I guess I'm going to his house tonight to play Halo. Woo hoo. Jasmine can't go, and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do without her. I think it'll be the first time I'll actually be with the guys without her. Weird. Only John, Pyde and possibly Miller are going to be there. The Wronski's are grounded because of their grades and Richie's not answering his phone. Wronski? Bad grades? Am I supposed to act surprised? Slackers. And Richie's probably too stoned to hear the phone ring. Hehe this is fun. Anyways, Emily is sick and Jasmine is in trouble I guess, so those plans sort of went out the window. Oh well. I have like 3 hours to burn until I go over to John's. Oh boy.

      Woke up really early again today. Its this damn cold. I went to bed at like 9:30 last night though, so whatever. Ugh, lame. Hopefully today will be better, the boys were talking about getting together to play Halo. But you never know with them. So if they don't call I'm going to get out and do something with Emily and Jasmine, hopefully. I must get out of the house!!! Okay...kind of grossed out by Chris's away message which says that he is "playing the Valentine's Day game" with his girlfriend....um, ew! *shudder* Anyways, yeah. Still not sure if I'm going to set construction tomorrow. I'm so lazy. Dammit, I am so bored. Meh, whatever.

      I'm posting again because I'm bored out of my mind! I was supposed to work the concessions at brother's tournament, but it turned out that my mom got the time wrong so we were like 2 hours early. I wasn't about to wait two hours for it, so I said screw that and went home. You know you're a loser when the highlight of your day is working concessions at your brother's basketball tournament, on Valentine's Day no less. I want someone to buy me flowers and take me out. Lol, can you say pathetic?! Meh, there's like 4 episodes of Law and Order on tonight so its all good. There I go again...LOSER!!!

      Happy Valentine's Day everyone! Sigh. Valentine's Day sucks when you don't have a boyfriend. Anyways, still really not feeling good. My throat isn't as sore, which is good I suppose. I'm not doing anything at all this weekend, except possibly going to set construction on Monday. I really don't want to, but I have to in order to get my Thespian points. Meh. I woke up at 7:30 today. Yuck! I hate being sick. Anyways, this whole new director situation is just a mess. I'm really disappointed in the way everyone is handling this. People are making this way more difficult than it needs to be. So much for a smooth transition.

      Oh, drama. Here's a good story for ya'll- So we all met Mr. Perkins this morning. He seemed kinda weird but whatever. Anyways, so I'm in 7th period today and I got this letter that said: "All meetings with Mr. Perkins scheduled for today and tomorrow have been canceled. Mr. Perkins has withdrawn his acceptance of the position." Right there is where I almost fall over in front of my entire English class. Man, I was apalled. Crazy, crazy stuff. So I wonder who will be our director now. Anyways, my cold is still here. That sucks majorly. After wind ensemble Jeff, Cory, Renee, Kelly and I had this great biblical debate about whether being gay is wrong or not. That was interesting. I say if you wanna be gay, you be gay. If two people who happen to be gay love each other and they want to be together, then let 'em. What the hell.

      Ugh, so I'm officially sick. I woke up with a stuffy nose and a really bad sore throat. Yuck. So I've been shoving these Cold-eez things in my mouth all day in hopes I can get rid of this thing by Tuesday for my audition. Oh man, the worst thing happened in Wind Ensemble today! Mr.Buchenot (I think he's an administrator or something...he doesn't seem to do much of anything) came in and he's like "Congratulations on a great concert last night. Mr. Perkins is coming to see you tomorrow and all Mr. Snoeck needs to do is take attendance. I want to thank you guys for making this transition go well." Just by watching Mr. Snoeck's face, you could totally tell that he was super pissed off. After Mr. Buchenot left he said "I take great offense that he said that there has already been a transition, I have had no part in this, and he (meaning Mr. Perkins) has been alienating me and the rest of the staff for the past four days. And you know I don't lie to you guys." Then Kelly Scott started crying and we all got real depressed. It made this new guys sound like a real ass. Plus, Mr. Buchenot, what the hell were you thinking, coming in here and telling us what's going on, when really you have no part in the band?! If Mr. Snoeck wanted to tell us about anything, he would. We really didn't need you coming in and talking to us about anything. And so now the whole wind ensemble is upset, there's talk of us all ditching tomorrow and all sorts of stuff. We're also not crazy about the fact that Mr. Snoeck isn't going to be there when Mr. Perkins is there. I'm not really ready to have anyone else standing in front of me in class besides Mr. Snoeck. Also, its almost like Mr. Snoeck is being pushed out of the picture before the year is even over. I mean, he's still here until June! Come on. Its crazy. Tomorrow shall be very interesting. I'm not holding anything back tomorrow either. I'm definitely speaking my mind. Anyways, thats all that really happened today. The whole thing kinda ruined my day, but whatever.

      Busy, busy, busy. Today was very busy. School was fine, it actually wasn't that bad today. We watched the Odyssey in English which was moderately entertaining. Then it was off to the workshop for the Spring Play, "Anything Goes". Its cool because its jazz music, but we had to learn a very difficult dance to audition with. It was really hard, like no one knew what to do. I'm totally going to butcher it in myt audition and make up my own dance. Anywho, then I had voice lessons. I recorded the National Anthem on a tape which I am planning on sending to various local baseball teams like the Cubs, Sox, Flyers, etc. Fun. I think if I have to sing the national anthem one more time today I will fall over. We did it like 20 times, it was crazy. Then after that, I went home, got my shoes and pantyhose and then went to my band concert which I ended up being slightly late for, I had to dress in the bathroom in a minute flat. I think I set the record for putting on pantyhose. I put them on in like 20 seconds, resulting in a massive bunch. Yeah, pantyhose = not cool. I got to the band room in time, though, and we played a good concert. Steve Pyter was there, but I didn't get a chance to talk to him. Also, Mr. Snoeck is now in the BOA Director's Hall of Fame, so yay for him. That's awesome. So tomorrow, I have East Ensemble after school and then I am planning on going to Contest Play Construction, which was moved from today to tomorrow. I'll probably definitely go to that because apparently we get double thespian points or something. Very cool. Oh and I do not understand my algebra assignment AT ALL. This stuff is crazy. Meh, I'll ask someone tomorrow. Guess what?! I got into Honors Chemistry next year!!! YAY FOR ME!!! I still don't know if I'm taking it because I've heard its a rather difficult course, but I'm still thinking about it. We'll see. Tootles!

      Ugh, today = not fun. I suppose it wasn't entirely bad, besides the fact that I amost fell asleep in 6th period. I hate classes after lunch. It would be better if we could just eat lunch and then go home. Anyways, East Ensemble sucked yet again. We worked on "Shoshone Love Song" which I volunteered to play the piano for. That was a really bad decison. There's some really funky chords, and my fingers just didn't work today. Ugh. It was really bad. Then, to make matters worse, we choreographed more of "Razamajazz". Again, not fun. I honestly don't know why I'm still in East Ensemble. I hate it.  Yeah, so today in Spanish, A.J. and I were talking about band, and suddenly before I know it, everyones giving me crap about how we didn't actually win state and how we didn't make finals. I was this close to decking every single one of them. Grr. Not to mention we did win state. So tomorrow, I'm supposed to be doing three things after school. 1- One Act rehearsal, 2- Contest Play Set Construction, 3- Spring Play Workshop. I haven't actually decided which I'm going to yet. I figure I can probably get out of One Acts considering the size of my part. I should go to set construction because its the first meeting, but then I'll have to miss the workshop, and if I miss the workshop, that means I'll have to go tomorrow which means I'll miss East Ensemble, which means that Ms. Gibson will murder me. Hmm. There's something to ponder.

      Today was a relatively good day, I suppose. Didn't puke like yesterday. That's a start. Wind Ensemble kind of sucked this morning though- I was really off. Speaking of which, we have a concert on Wednesday and you should come! We're actually playing some decent stuff- the Carnival movement from "La Fiesta Mexicana", "Tatarian Dances", and "Galop", which I get to play the bass part on. Yeah I totally rock at that song. Anyways, my One-Act song is really coming along. (Hey it rhymes! hehe) The song is cool, but pretty much everything else about the play is horrible. THe humor is cheesy and I have like 2 lines. And a song. Can't forget the song. So during rehearsal, I pretty much sit there and do nothing until its times for 2 lines and song. Yeah. Meh, I have a lot of homework tonight. Not cool. Ugh, and I got a C on my algebra quiz on exponents. Grr I hate exponents! Oh and yes, notify the authorities, Liz got a C! Whateva. I had to sing the National Anthem in biology today. Fun stuff. We had work time and these two kids said, "Hey Liz, we'll give you a piece of gum if you sing." So I said okay, sang and got some gum. Sweet deal. I think I scared the teacher a little. He was a sub... but its fun to scare subs lol. I had a good time. Until tomorrow.

      Yes, I have returned from the terrible hell that is Glen Ellyn. It sucked, like it always does. I got to go to the library though, which was mildly entertaining. Got 2 CDs- Abra Moore and The Best of Gershwin. Yep, I'm a nerd. So it turns out this Alan D. Perkins (new band director) guy is coming for a little visit this week. I can't wait. Its really scary because this year is a huge turning point in Lake Park Marching Band history. We're either gonna end up sucking really bad, being really mediocre or being really awesome, and no one really knows where we're headed. This guy must be good, though. We'll just have to go with the flow and hopefully everything will turn out well. Today kinda sucked though, I puked 3 times this morning. Damn bagel. Meh.

      Wow. All I can say is hooray for Fridays. Its been a hellish week. Well, I made One Acts! I'm in "Uncool". Plus, I get to sing an entire song, all by myself. I am excited. The song is kind of lame though. I have no recording, no accompaniment, not even a tempo marking. Just the melody. The chords are marked in though, so I'll take a stab at writing a piano part. It is very "uncool" (haha) that I have to go to my Dad's this weekend. He does not own a computer that has internet access. I know you're all thinking "Oh no, I won't get to read Liz's blog for the next two days!". And sadly, you are correct. No internet means no blogging, sorry kids. Oh well. You know what else sucks? Snowball Ball is tonight and I am not going. Yeah, kind of depressing. Boys suck anyway. Unfortunitely, I will miss seeing if Mike Wronski is crowned "Prince". I would have paid the 25 bucks or whatever it was to go. Haha, soooo funny. Oh well.

      Very. Long. Day. School was fine, same old, same old. But then once again, East Ensemble was absolutely ridiculous. No one showed up for practice, including the choreographers which makes it suck even worse. And then I FINALLY auditioned for One Acts today and it went very well, despite the fact that I had to wait there for like an hour. Mrs. Saeger and Laura decided they were going to schedule a rehearsal for today at 5:30, and not tell me about it until this morning. Grr, I was angry. Especially since I had a hair appointment scheduled for 6. I tried to find Laura after school at her play rehearsal, but she wasn't there, so I just decided not to go. Not my fault. They didn't even give me directions to her house, so whatever. Then I got my hair cut. Nothing drastic, my hair is still as boring as it was before. And the hairdresser was running late so I had to sit there for a half hour. Annoying! Yes, and I was going to take a mental health day tomorrow, but turns out I have an algebra quiz (yes, on exponents), an English test and a Spanish test. So much for that. Meh, I catch up on sleep this weekend, considering I'm doing absolutely NOTHING. I'm going to my Dad's so its not like I could do anything anyway. Whatever. Tomorrow's friday, WOO HOO!!!

      Just got home from a half day at school! Yay! The tests were pretty bad though. I like the Learning Styles Inventory because I didn't really have to think at all. But the other one sucked pretty bad. I guess it was like a pre-act test or something crazy like that. Heres a sample question: "How many squares would have a numerically greater perimeter than area of any other squares, in square inches?" When I got to the question, I just started laughing. I don't think that was the exact question though. Something similar. I'm sure they used the word square at least 3 more times. Are they trying to tell me something? I know I'm white and all, but man! And then we had to look at these pictures of turtles and robots and decide whether they were the same or different. And they were all the same! It was really bizarre. We didn't get any breaks in the three hours that we were there either. So Jeff Woz and I are going to Westfield after school today to see everyone. I'm excited, it should be entertaining. And then I have voice lessons, which is definitely a good thing considering I got bitched out by Ms. Gibson last week for not knowing the notes for my IHSA duet with Laura Waters. Grr, I was so pissed after that, someone almost had to physically restrain me. And I'm not a violent person. Oh well, I'm over it now. Also, I'm going to see this play tonight at Drury Lane called "A Man Came to Dinner" or something crazy like that. My Mom got free tickets through her work so I thought I might as well go. I think that's it...tootles!

      Today was very tiring. And very boring. Nothin really happened today, at all. Except that I went to East Ensemble which was absolutely horrible. We have to learn really stupid choreography to a really stupid song. Don't believe me? The song is called "Razamajazz". Yeah its pretty bad. And the people who make up the steps always have to explain it in the most complicated way possible. Didn't try out for One Acts today like I thought, too lazy so I just came home. Meh, I'll go Thursday. So we have testing tomorrow which is cool because we get a half day. Not cool because testing sucks. I honestly wouldn't mind if we had to take something that was required by the state or something, but seriously, a Learning Styles Inventory? Come on now. Can you say waste of time? Anyways Jeff and I might go to Westfield jazz band tomorrow. And I might go to this play at Drury Lane. Still just trying to get through the week, as usual. Oh, and I talked to Chris Barnum online tonight. EXCITING! Lol, he's a pretty cool guy for being a teacher and all. Meh.

      Whee! My first post! Yeah...life is pretty crazy lately, Mikado just ended, so I'm trying out for One Acts tomorrow, fun stuff. So yeah....Alex W. totally asked me out yesterday. And I totally said no. Lol he's not really my type. And I hope hes not reading this right now because that would be weird. Eh, we'll see where that goes. You know what I really, really hate? Algebra. Algebra sucks. God damn exponents. When am I ever going to have to use exponents in my adult life? How about never? Its all a conspiracy to confuse the living hell out of teenagers. I'm telling you its a conspiracy. Anywho, had set strike tonight for Mikado, which sucked almost as bad as exponents. Not quite though. It was very, very boring. We had to take the big pagoda dealy down and all the ribbons and stuff. But Josh was there and he's a sexy beast so it made it all worth it lol. Josh is the best, he's my hero. I gave him the answers to a biology lab and he got all the answers wrong. It was funny because my teacher marked all of mine right and he copied word for word. I laughed. A lot. I think that's it. Oh yeah, I went to the most kick ass party Saturday at Adam Sherman's house. Yay for cast parties. Mike Wronski and Noah BOTH took their shirts off so it made it worth my while, Lol j/k. Who wants to see Mike Wronski with his shirt off anyway?!

      Yay for spring break! Today was actually fun because most of my teachers didn't really care what we did today. Mr. Snoeck actually talked to us today which was interesting. So Emily and I went to the Mr. Lancer competition last night, which was sort of a beauty pagent for guys. It was hilarious. And Andy played and sang the North Dakota song...and OMG....ahh. He was awesome. We melted. Well anyways, he won, and that was pretty cool. Yes, well I've been writing a lot of music lately..and its turning out really well. Especially the one I wrote today called Bright Eyes, its really, really good. I don't know how I did it. But yeah, I'm thinking thats what I'll play for the talent show next year. We're going car shopping tomorrow, yay. No, the car is not for me. But its fun to shop anyways. Ugh, I have a ton of work to do this week...wind ensemble music, lines memorized, the whole bit. It'll be fun! Not...

      Looooong day. I was in one of those fuck-it moods too, which didn't help much. *rewind* Yeah, so on Saturday, I babysitting until like 2 in the morning. Well actually, I was babysitting for like 3 hours, and sleeping watching TV for the rest. But that's not the point. The point is that I made $40, which I really needed. So now officially, I have $61.38. Yay. So, back to today. Yeah, it was incredibly boring and tedious. Yuck, we even had to watch Beethoven's 4th in Spanish. Grr! What the hell?! I AM SO SICK OF BEING TREATED LIKE I'M 5!!! Sometimes I wish I could fast-forward the next 3 years of my life, and go straight to college and be treated like the adult that I am. Ugh. Spring Break is next week and I'm excited, yay!

      Ga! I hate babysitting! Why do I put myself through such utter torment? Oh wait, I remember now, its for the money! Right-o. Anyways, I have to go in like 15 minutes. That sucks. yeah well. I went to Mike Fanizza's house last night. It was fun, he's cool. You see, I didn't actually play Halo because there were already 8 people that wanted to play...so yeah. It didn't bother me that much anyway. Oh yeah...so this really weird guy called my cell phone twice last night and I had no idea who it was! He sounded old and Italian. The caller ID said private. It was funny because I had Jasmine answer it the 2nd time because I was a little freaked out. She told them we were having a mass orgy, it was hilarious. And of course John Kasper felt it was his duty to yell out things like "Bend over!". That's our John. I seriously think he is the single funniest person I've ever met. He makes me laugh so much! Grr, off to babysitting.

      We Anything Goes rehearsal for what seemed like the longest time today. First, we just had a regular music rehearsal for like an hour and half and then we learned blocking which is really, really weird. This sucks because not only do I have to learn Hope's part, but I also have to learn all the chorus blocking too! I have no idea how I'm going to do it. Yeah, and I guess I have to have my lines memorized for AG the same week as my wind ensemble audition. That sucks royally. Anyways, my algebra grade is steadily falling. I have a B-. Grr, I must pull that up. I have so much shit on my plate lately. Well enough complaining. I saw contest play and GI last night, and they were so funny! Steve had to like shove these cucumber sandwiches in his mouth, and I laughed so I hard I cried. Yeah. That's pretty much it for now.

      Oh my God, the funniest thing happened today. I guess the construction workers at school were welding or something, and they set off smoke detectors, which in turn set off the fire alarm, which caused the entire school to go outside. (Lucky me, I was in my gym uniform) So we're all standing outside and its snowing, its like 35 degrees. All of a sudden, about 20 minutes after we came outside, you see this guy running around without his shirt on! Ok, whatever, the teachers caught him, he put his shirt back on, end of story. So about 5 minutes later, you see another guy running across the field, WITH NO PANTS ON! He ran a little, dropped his tighty-whities pulled them up again, and then started running again! Finally he was caught by a teacher, and I guess he was arrested for indecent exposure or something like that. Needless to say, we won't be seeing hin for a while. But oh, so funny! That made my day. Anywho, I practiced my music with Ms. Gibson today. She told Kelly and I that we were starting at 3:05, but Kelly wasn't there because they don't let cars in while the buses are still there. So she missed it and Gibson was NOT happy. Ha, what now Kelly? What now? Hehe, I can't help if I don't like her, its just she's my competition...meh, I try. But yeah. So I have a voice lesson today, and then I going to see Contest Play and GI. Fun stuff. Speaking of GI, Noah broke up with his girlfriend, Alyssa! When I heard that, I looked out the window just to make sure the sky wasn't falling. Seriously, I never in my wildest dreams thought they would ever break up. That's too bad, I guess. Oh well.

      Long, long day. Ugh. I slept until like 6:40, which was a problem because I had to be out the door at 6:55, giving me about 15 minutes to get ready and eat. That was probably the reason I forgot my gym uniform. Anyways, wind ensemble was fine, chorus was ok, we were sight-reading this one song, and I guess I was singing too loud, because she told me not to sing. OMG, they sucked really, really bad. Yuck. She said I have to blend more, which is hard to do because I'm like the only one who sings with vibrato in the sopranos. I'm not about to change the way I sing to compensate for those who aren't at my level yet. Hehe, that makes me sound like a pompous bitch, doesn't it? Sorry about that. Anyways, Jeff was being such an ass today. He said "Liz, you're such a freshman." Ugh. Coming from Jeff?! Well, excuse me. And he said this because I didn't know if some upperclassmen couple had broken up or not. Grr, he makes me so mad. So yeah, my day wasn't that bad except for the fact that I couldn't change in gym due to the fact that I forgot my uniform. So I had to sit out with all the delinquents and watch everyone else play pickleball. Fun stuff.

      Okay, Catchstone officially rocks my world! The concert was awesome, even though they only got to play like 5 songs. Melanie finally met Andy! After he shook her hand, so licked it....yeah thats our Mel. I talked to Noah and Andy, they're both so cool. So then Mel and I spent the night at Emily's and we watched the Catchstone video in which Noah raps in Hebrew and we see Marc and Andy in their boxers. Nice. It was really funny. Ugh, Emily got me up at 7:30 that morning. Grr, Liz needs her sleep. So then Saturday afternoon, Jasmine and I volunteered at the LP Winterguard Competition, which was fun I guess. Steve Pyter was there, and we hung out with him for a while. Anthony was there, too. We were talking about the whole director situation. He said that Anthony had a decent chance. Do you have any idea how awesome that would be if Anthony was our director?! OMG, we would have so much fun if would be ridiculous. Ok, anywho, LP got 3rd I think. Nice. That was pretty much my weekend, because I pretty much did nothing today. I did write 2 songs this weekend, they're pretty cool, too.

      And I'm back. Thank goodness for Fridays. Finally, one acts is over. Praise the Lord! I'm so glad. So yeah, we had our performance last night, and people actually laughed, so that was good. And then I played my song. It was really cool, because they forgot to put that I wrote the music in the program, so they announced it. It was like "In tonight's performance of 'Uncool', the music was composed by Liz Hutchinson." It was really nice to be recognized for that. Anyways, I played I few wrong chords, but overall it went really well. Emily, Melanie and I are going to the Catchstone concert tonight and I'm really excited. I'm also volunteering at the LP Winterguard competition tomorrow afternoon. That should be amusing. I thought it would be good to support them, as a member of the marching band. Plus, its not like I have anything better to do on a Saturday afternoon. Yeah, so I think thats it. Yeah...

      Alright....you know something's up when you're at school for 13 hours in one day.... Yeah. I was. The day was fairly uneventful...except for chorus which is always interesting. After school was when the fun began. So we had our tech rehearsal for one acts today. I got to west campus about 3:30 and didn't actually go on stage until about 8:00. Yeah...not cool. I was so upset, I thought I was seriously going to cry. It was horrible. Sam, Tamara and I went to Wendy's to buy our cast food, which was fun. We spent $32 there. Fun times. But anyway, I'm tired as all hell, and I really must be going to bed. By the way, I saw the other night of one acts last night, and they were really funny. I laughed my ass off. You should have been there...that's ok, just come see me tomorrow, 7:00, LP west campus!

      Pretty typical day....Richie wasn't stoned this morning....this is the first time in a while...so that was nice lol. So anyways, Josh (Moeller) is all pissed off at me because I didn't wave to him yesterday. So he spent the entire hour telling me how I wasn't his favorite Liz anymore. And then Megan was totally being a bitch, so I stole her pen and ran away with it....dude she totally violated me trying to get it back. Anyways, I threw it away in the locker room. It was funny because I never liked her in the first place. Hehe, anyways, I'm going to the first night of one acts tonight. Fun stuff. Ugh, 2 days and counting until its over...Ok, I'm off.

      Okay, I officially hate one acts. Soooo much. I absolutely cannot wait until its over on Thursday. I seriously spent hours writing that accompaniment part and I got no gratification at all. None whatsoever. That pisses me off. You know what else pisses me off? The fact that I have to miss our first Anything Goes rehearsal for the stupid play tomorrow. Ugh, I would much rather be at Anything Goes, but whatever. So I was reading through the script a while ago...oh man. I have lots of lines to memorize. Plus, I have to learn my wind ensemble audition music, which is really hard. WE auditions are like April 16, and the play is April 30. I am going to have a lot of work to do in the next month. Oh yeah and I made the font bigger. Just for you Jasmine, :).

      I'm in a bad mood for some reason. Whatever. I saw Dirty Dancing Havana Nights today. It was good I guess. Not as good as the original, of course. "Nobody puts Baby in a corner!". Hehe, classic. Anyways, I babysat last night, and then slept over at their house. It wasn't that hard. I pretty much fell asleep on the couch watching the Disney channel while the girls played. Kinda sucked, though. I did make $32. Thats cool. I'm so tired. I cannot wait for one acts to end. I am so sick of it. It will be really nice starting next week when I can focus only on Anything Goes.

      I am so tired. You have no idea. I was at school at 7:00 this morning for solo and ensemble contest. I know I got a 1 on my solo, and I didn't see what Laura and I got on our duet, but I'm just going to assume we got a 1. Come on, its me and Laura Waters. How could we not get a 1? Anyways, the judges were really stupid. They talked forever and ever, and then practically wrote books on the comment sheets, so each room was running like an hour behind. Crazy. So yesterday, we had our first read-through for Anything Goes. Some people in the cast can barely read. Not kidding. It was...bad. And you know what I found out? Not only does Noah have to kiss me, he also has to slap my ass! Wow, how wonderful is that? And I thought the kissing was bad. Man this play is going to be interesting!

      Ugh, long day, yet again. First, we had the Honor Roll Assembly in the morning, which was a bore, and I had to miss wind ensemble which sucked real bad. It just felt wrong not to have it. I missed it a lot, which is kinda weird. We got to watch Wizard of Oz in chorus which was fun. That was pretty much all that happened today I think. Oh yeah, I sang my solo at the chorus concert last night, and I kicked some major ass! Yeah, I was good. Lol, so 2 people quit our play today.  A WEEK BEFORE THE SHOW! Yeah, losers. And one of them was Owen, the cute guy. But he turned out to be a total ass, so whatever. He never tried, and whenever he actually showed up to practice, he would always complain. When they quit today, I thought poor Kendra was going to have a heart attack. (Kendra = director) Yeah, and then I went to "Recital Night" and sang my solo and my duet with Laura, and we both rocked. Our first meeting for "Anything Goes" is tomorrow, I am very excited. Hehe, we get to do a read through, so yay. I wonder how that is going to work with double-casting....that reminds me, I will probably have to associate with Kelly tomorrow....woo hoo.

      Oh man, busy, busy, busy. Today I had one acts until 5, a voice lesson at 5:30 and then I had to be at LP for the chorus concert at 6:45. Craziness. Anyways, my stepmonster totally went off the deep end yesterday. She went NUTS! Long story, but anyways, I ended up leaving at like 10 because she was acting so weird. And then today in algebra, Mr. Zizzo brought up the whole kissing thing again. Now hes started asking questions like "Is he taller than you?" and crazy stuff like that. Ugh. Yuck. Leave me alone. Tomorrow is sure to be interesting because I have the honor roll assembly 1st period. I don't really know where I have to go because I don't have a 1st period at east campus. So yeah, I'll have to figure that one out. Luckily, east ensemble is officially over for the year, so all I have now is one acts, and anything goes starting friday. Oh boy. So solo & ensemble contest is on saturday. And then I'm babysitting saturday night, and I spending the night at their house or something. They better be paying me well. Hehe.

      Is it bad that I'm looking forward to going back to school tomorrow? This whole doing nothing thing is getting slightly old. Ugh, my mom is such a loser. She called 20 times at 10:30 to wake me up. Seriously, she would call, and when I didn't answer, she would hang up and call again. And she did this over and over again. I eventually answered, hung up on her and unplugged my phone. So I'm in for it when I get home. Looking back, it would have been really smart to just pick up the phone and leave it there so it rang busy. Oh well. So anyways, I decided to go for a bike ride today and I ended up at the forest preserve in roselle. It was probably around 2.5/3 miles there and back. It was fun I guess. I ran into Emily, her sister and her mom. Weird. Yeah. She said she would call me about going to the barn tonight. She hasn't called yet so whatever. So how about those Oscars? All I can say is that its about damn time Lord of the Rings got recognized. Yay! I was happy. Anyways, I'm super excited for this week. I get to do my solo at the chorus concert and then anything goes starts Thursday. I am so excited for that. Chris said he might be able to come see it. That would be cool, I guess.

      Grr. I'm having a grr day. Yeah. Anything Goes opens today. Yay for that, even though I'm not performing tonight. Yesterday we had our last dress rehearsal, which for me, was horrible. I performed like I always did, like I've been rehearsing for the past 2 weeks, but suddenly, my acting isn't good enough! I need to laugh more, have more chemistry with Noah, I need to gesture more here, blah, blah, blah. I love how she waits to tell me these things THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW OPENS!!!!!!!!! Dammit! I was so mad. Ugh. Anyways, we got our results from wind ensemble back. Hehe...yeah. Last chair, woo hoo! Looks like we'll have about 5 trombones in w/e next year. I wouldn't be that pissed, but Miller beat me! What the hell?! Ga, I am so much better than Miller! Not fair. I'm going to challenge like no one has ever challenged before! You watch, I'll be second chair before the month of September is over! Muhahahaha...ha. Anyways...I'm going to see that drama thing at Westfield today. That is, if Laura decides to pick me up...we'll see. So yeah, come and see Anything Goes, Friday April 30, at 7:30 and Sunday, May 2 at 2pm. Lake Park east campus auditorium. Yay!

      Pretty boring weekend actually. Yesterday was mildly entertaining I guess. We had tech for AG, which was utterly POINTLESS! We sat around for like 2 hours and then went from cue to cue which was really confusing and not cool. Then I had my audition for the Schaumburg Flyers, and that went really well. After tech, Michelle, Jasmine and I went to Aurelio's for lunch. Jasmine and I....we aren't really friends anymore. At least not like we used to be. Meh. I hate to say it, but the truth is, I don't rely on her for companionship as much as I used to. And I'm fine with that. I have a lot of friends that care about me and share the same values that I do. Jasmine and I just don't anymore. Anyways, Mel, Emily and I went to Battle of the Bands to see Richie Ribando and the Swingin Six, which was hysterical. They were actually really good for putting it together in two weeks. After that I went home. I felt really lame coming home at 8:30 on a Saturday night. A bunch of people were going out afterwards, but no one really invited me, and I didn't want to ask to go with them...so yeah. I felt left out :(. Whatever. I caught up on my sleep which was nice. We went to church this morning and there was this musical thing they did which was really cool. A bunch of people I know were in it like Cathie, Jenna, Josh, Kelly, and Lizz. It was really good. So I think I'm going to get involved with the choir there at Trinity. Fun stuff. I'm going to buy new hot rollers for the play today. I'm really happy because I'm doing two dress rehearsals on Monday and Wednesday. Lucky me. I'm excited to see my costume, too. Its coming tomorrow. I hope its not ugly. That wouldn't be fun. Busy week coming up.

      I think that when Anything Goes ends, I will be both very happy and absolutely devastated. It definitely marks the end of this school year for me. And that means having to finally say goodbye to all of of my senior friends who are leaving....I am going to CRY! Ugh, I can't imagine going to school and not seeing them every day. Its going to be hard. Anyways, its coming along, although this week was a little stressful. And by a little I mean a lot. I've caught a nasty cold, and I stayed home on Wednesday. This whole double casting thing is just...not cool. It just makes it twice as hard to get your part down. A lot of us are really getting annoyed with it all, especially since the cast will not shut up. Meh, thats what Weber gets for casting 80 people. The chorus would have been just fine if she had taken out about 15-20 of them. They can barely fit on the stage! Oh well. We have our tech rehearsal tomorrow, and I have an audition to sing the national anthem at the Schaumburg Flyers game. And then I'm going to Battle of the Bands to see Richie Ribando and the Swingin Six. That should be very entertaining. Busy day tomorrow.

      So. I'm actually updating. I can tell you care. Today was icky. Why? I'm not quite sure. Maybe it was because we had to go outside for gym today. Maybe it was because I sat on my ass for 3 hours after school for play practice. Maybe it was just because it was Monday. Anyways, it just kinda sucked. Play practice was mildly interesting. Wronski gave me a massage...don't ask. And then he pretended to write something bad on my neck, and I smacked really hard in the head. I felt bad afterwards though, because he wasn't really writing anything. Oh well. He probably deserved it for something else. I got my character chart for Romeo and Juliet back in English, and my teacher really liked it. I got 100, yay. I spent a really long time on it, so whatever. Eh, tomorrow should be better for me, I'll actually get to go onstage for practice. Its a little sad when thats the highlight of your day, but hey, I'm lame. Meh.

      And I'm back. I know you've all been anxiously awaiting my return...not. Well, I'm doing it because of a special request from Noah. Possibly the only one who actually reads this...haha. Anywho, its been kinda crazy lately. Anything Goes opens a week from Thursday. Woo hoo. We still don't have a new band director. And we won't for another few weeks. Speaking of band, I completely bombed my wind ensemble audition. Thats what you get for leaving your horn in the garage every night. I mean...not practicing....yeah. Anyway, I had an audition with the head of the voice department at U of I yesterday. I forgot the words so I kept repeating the first verse over and over again. Yeah, it was funny. But other than that I nailed it. He said he was impressed my my high range. Thats right, I kicked ass. Yeah and for my monologue, I took a bunch of lines from Anything Goes, the part where Billy and I are talking about how we spent 12 hours in the back of a taxi. That probably freaked him out a little, but hey, whatever. So it looks like I'll be going to a musical theatre camp in Champaign this summer, yay. And then I have another audition to sing the national anthem at a Schaumburg Flyers game this summer. And Wronski's working there, too. Speaking of baseball, the cubs lost today which really sucked. I actually watched the ENTIRE game. Usually I can't sit still that long, but I did. Yeah. And I've started going to church. I've found one I actually like. So me and jesus are tight now and it looks like I might not be going to hell after all. Lol. And Catchstone rocks my world. Yep, thats been my life for the last two weeks.

       Yesterday was fun. Marching band in the morning....that was interesting. This time we had two entire rows screaming "Left! Left! Left!" It was pretty bad. I wonder how we're gonna make it through the parade tomorrow. That is assuming there is a parade. Its been raining like crazy here lately. We were driving to church and I thought we were gonna die. Yeah and so after church we went to IHOP for breakfast. Fun stuff. So I think today me and my Mom might stop by the mall and see what prom dresses are on sale. I want to get a cheap one for homecoming next year. I don't know if they'll have any good ones though. We'll see. Paul came over last night :-). We watched The Breakfast Club. And then we sorta just sat around in my basement and tried not to fall asleep. We had a really fun time. Anyways, I start my babysitting job on June 8. Exciting. Its actually really good because I don't have to do anything! They don't even need babysitter. And they're paying me well too. So yay for that. And then parade tomorrow, two more days of finals. Reminds me I have to study for biology. Boo for that.

       Pretty tired tonight. Long day. My jury went awesome, I got a 92. Seems like 92 is my lucky number lately. Anywho, we got out at like 11. And then Emily, Bob, Melanie, Jasmine, Paul and I went to see Shrek 2. It was really cute, I had a really good time. And then we had to go to dinner for my brother's birthday. Yeah, I honestly don't think it could have been any worse. My Mom made a huge scene because the waiter didn't tell her there wasn't free refills. Then she told him that she wouldn't give him a tip if he didn't take all the extra drinks off our bill. Ugh. I don't understand why people just can't relax and let things go. Whether or not you pay a couple extra bucks for drinks is not going to impact your life that much. Plus, what really made me angry is that she was proud of the fact that she made a huge deal of everything and then got her way. I'll never be like that. Yeah and I guess my Mom told my Grandma that Paul was coming over tomorrow, and she goes "So your boyfriends coming over tomorrow?". Um, no. And if you bring it up one more time, I will throw my iced tea in you face. Lol, I was in a bad mood the whole time. Anyways, marching band tomorrow morning. Hopefully people will learn to tell their left foot from their right so I don't have to scream "LEFT! LEFT! LEFT!" the whole time. Oh well. Paul's coming over tomorrow, yay. We're going to watch The Breakfast Club. Fun stuff.

       Yay! We're done! Just have to worry about finals, and then its totally over. Speaking of finals, I got a 92% on my written algebra final. Yay for me. Wind ensemble was really sad today. Everyone was signing autograph books and there was just this feeling like something huge is coming to an end. And Andy was handing out these CDs of a song he wrote called "Four Year Blue". I listened to it after school and its REALLY good. He had a sheet of lyrics at the end and he put a message at the end of it: "Thank you for everything. Let this song be a reflection of every chapter of your life. May it touch your heart the way you have touched mine. May your lives be filled with happiness, and hope that someday we will meet again. This song is for you. Never let the colors fade away for if we shall never speak again, we will always be melted together by a four year blue." And thats where I was so close to crying it wasn't even funny. And then I gave it to Renee and she almost started crying. Yeah we were all just really sad. But the song was awesome. "So don't leave without crying/ Cause beautful friendships shed tears/ And let's scream to our futures/ Together an ending we will love/ Our beautful unborn lives..." Wow. Deep. I guess this the end of something big. But with every end comes a new beginning, we'll begin to watch our "beautiful unborn lives" unfold before our eyes...

       Another decent day. The only period that sucked, as usual was gym...we played volleyball outside and it cold and rainy and icky. Meh, one more day! And we're in the weight room, so I'll go in the hall and do "situps". Lol. But we get to end early to go clean out our lockers. Fun. Ugh, I swear, in every class we're doing study guide, upon study guide, upon study guide! Its crazy. Half the time I just sit there and write notes. Yeah in algebra, my teacher gave us this little mini quiz thing for the written final, and I got 3 out of 4 right, so yay for me. But after he gave us the answer to one problem, hes like "Ok, raise your hand if you didn't get this right". And so a bunch of kids raised their hands, and then he goes "Three fourths of you will fail the final". O...k...thats good news. Yeah, me and AJ did our Spanish oral today and actually we didn't do so bad. We had to pick out a random picture and just talk about it. I think we got 100, so thats good. I'm not even going to study for Spanish....seriously, I did the entire study guide in like 2 minutes without even using the book. And I would have to get like a D or F on it to lose my A, so whatever. One more day of actual classes! YAY! *Dances around* ;)

      Today I feel a lot better. My jury is sounding a lot better, and plus I picked 28, so I'm going last. Nice. I got my English assignment in that was due like 2 weeks ago, yay. I was officially accepted into the ISYM Musical Theatre camp, so yay for that. So I get to go down to Champaign for a week this summer. And musical theatre is one of my favorite things in the whole wide world, so it should be awesome. The only 2 things that I really have to worry about right now are my algebra written final (on Thursday, AH!!!) and my jury, which I can practice tomorrow and Thursday. I'll be fine I guess. Paul wrote me a note and gave me a sucker and his lucky guitar pick! I walked into English after he gave it to me with the biggest smile on my face and Kelly goes "What did Paul do this time?". Lol, it was so funny. But yeah, that was really sweet of him :-).

      Quite frankly, it will be a miracle if I don't die by the time finals are over. I just can't take it anymore. I hate everything so much...its just horrible. I have my jury in like two days...theres a potential disaster right there. Then I have my algebra final, which I have to get at least a 91% on the get an A. And I really need that A in case I mess my jury up. Then theres my gym final...I'm right on the border of an A and a B, so there another thing I have to worry about. Just three more days...three more days. Oh and to add on top of that, I have a parade in a week! I'm supposed to have memorized music that I've barely looked at twice! What kind of example am I setting? Seriously! I know the stupid brass guy is gonna make us do something stupid to show we memorized it, and I'm going to fall on my ass because I don't have a clue. Ok. Just three more days, three more days....

      Consider this a post from yesterday....I tried updating yesterday, but it wouldn't work. Anyways, Emily and I went to Mr. Snoeck's "Retirement Open House" thingy....now, let me tell you, THAT was a party, lol. We just kinda sat there and ate cake the whole time, it was great. We talked to a few people, but other than that, we just ate. Fun. And so then I went over to Emily's for a while, mostly just because I didn't want to go home, but yeah. We sorta sat around and listened to classical music and talked. Yeah, we're lame, but whatever. So then it was off to Paul's, yay! We watched Sleepy Hollow and then just talked. It was too bad I had to leave at 10 because I would have wanted to stay longer. I think he's comin over here next weekend, good times. And today, I have to learn my jury, yuck. And I should memorize my marching band music, but I don't really know where it is at the moment...yeah. That sucks. Oh well. Whatcha gonna do?

      Thank God this week is over, oh its been soooo long. We're pretty much not doing anything in classes. Filed music in wind ensemble today, that was fun. And then in chorus, Gibson totally bitched anthony out today, I felt so sorry for the kid. I think she heard me talking about her, too. Meh, its ok, she never liked me anyway. So yeah, thats pretty much it. I'm going to Bob's tonight...its going to be me, emily, paul and possibly jasmine. Fun stuff. I heard something about roasting peeps....whatever, lol. And then Paul's tomorrow. Fun. So I'm working the concession stand at Springfield Park three nights this summer. Nice.

      So...tired. Thank god tomorrow's friday. Not that much happened today. I didn't bring my music to wind ensemble today and we were supposed to turn it in. Oops. Oh well. In chorus we did absolutely nothing, I don't even see the point of going to that class anymore. The rest of the day was just boring. Yeah, so I'm going over to Paul's on Saturday, yay! I'm excited. Grr, I got a C- on my final essay for english, just because I puncuated all my dialogue wrong. I guess its ok though, because shes letting me correct it in class tomorrow. Nice.

      Long day. I suppose I'll start from the beginning, which was actually last night....the chorus concert. It was disatrous....three hours long....yeah. It was just bad and long and not fun. Today was ok, I guess...except for gym which always sucks. I'm getting to talk to Paul more, which is making me very happy, gives me something to look forward to every day. So then we had our band concert tonight, man was that intense. It was Snoeck's last concert, so everyone was really sad and crying and stuff. It took a lot for me not to cry. Plus, I knew that Kasper and Pyde would make fun of me if I did, so whatever. Ok, totally off subject, but yeah. Matt Wronski is going to wish he was never born. Lol, he told Paul that I liked Noah! Which is totally and completely untrue. It just amazes me how people can take acting and turn it into so much more. Whatever, I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. I think thats it for now...

      Yay for updating your blog during class! Lol, I hope I don't get caught....oh well. I feel a little better today. Still real tired though. It didn't help that I stayed up late last night talking to Paul. It was worth it though. I wasn't supposed to be on, and my Mom sorta found out. Uh oh. Didn't seem like she really cared though, so whatever. Yeah so, the only reason I'm really updating now is because I have to babysit after school and I won't have any time after school. Grr, weight training tomorrow. And chorus concert tonight! Not fun at all. Wish me luck in surviving the next few days...oh yeah, Paul is giving me a picture today...interesting....

      *Sigh* Not a particularly good day. I'm just kinda down today. And on top of that, I have marching band rehearsal....and I really don't feel like going. Last week, I was motivated....this week I'm definitely not. And plus, tomorrow I have babysitting after school and then a chorus concert right after that. And then on Wednesday, I have a band concert, and then after that, juries start, and I've only practiced mine like once. I'm just so sick of everything. I just want to hide out in my room for the next three weeks. Ugh, I'm in such an icky mood. I suddenly feel like crying and I have no idea why. Grr.

      For some reason, I don't like Sundays. Its like, the weekend is over, but the week hasn't really started yet. Sunday is just kinda...there. You're happy because you had a good weekend, but you're sad because you have to face the world tomorrow at school. That's kinda how I feel today. Anyways, last night was awesome! Emily, Bob, Paul and I went to see Troy and then went for pizza afterwards, it was a lot of fun. Then I came home and talked to Paul for like an hour...*sigh*. I can't describe the feeling...its like the best feeling when I'm talking to him, but it hurts at the same time. A good hurt though, I suppose. So yeah, that was fun. I still have to finish my spanish project today. I think I might just blow AJ off and do it myself. I know I'll get a lot more done if he's not there anyway. Besides, I worked on it a little on Friday, so all I really have to do is find some more pictures and highlight vocab words, and verbs and stuff. Yeah. Marching Band tomorrow. I don't know...the first rehearsal excitment has kinda worn off. To be totally honest, I'd rather just stay home and talk to Paul all night...unfortunately I don't think that will happen....oh well. I think thats it for now....I really, really do not want to go to school tomorrow. Grr. Only like 2 weeks left...I'll have to hold on until then.

      Whee! I'm in English class right now...and I'm really not supposed to be doing this right now, but you know what? I'm gonna do it anyway. Its okay, my teacher likes me. Anyways, Richie was high AGAIN! It was really funny because I guess he had this big presentation to do in Music Theory, yet he decided to get high...whatever. He started walking around the band room without shoes on, yep that's our Richie! Lol. So yeah, Emily, Bob, Paul and I are going to see Troy tomorrow and then maybe to Aurelio's to get something to eat. I'm so excited...I'm getting butterflies just talking about it. Is that supposed to happen? Oh well. Finals start two weeks from today, thank god! I'm so ready for this year to be over...I'm really starting to slack off. I don't know. I am seriously about to shoot myself in chorus. Its just soooo remedial! I feel like I'm learning my ABC's all over again. I've been reading music since I was five, I really don't need to be doing worksheets on note names and time signatures. Grr. And its going to be just as bad next year. So I'm thinking I MIGHT get an A in algebra, if I try really hard. I'm like 2 percentage points below an A, and I took a quiz today that was really easy. So if I do well on the quiz and ace my final...maybe. Just maybe...

      Yay for half days! Each period was like 20 minutes long today...very nice. So the first band rehearsal went well, I suppose. I got first part, which was fun, but if they go off wind ensemble placment, I suspect I won't be on first for the show music. Bummer. Oh well. It was kinda bittersweet, because I really missed the seniors-Richie, Mike, Steve, Noah, etc. It was different. Very different. I guess I better get used to it. I'm being placed in Honors English next year, yay! So now, two honors classes. Sweet. AJ's coming over on Saturday so we can do our Spanish final project. Or so I can do our Spanish final project. As soon as we finish the project, he's leaving. And if he asks if we can have sex while he's over one more time, I will castrate him with a spoon, lol. Grr. I can't believe I agreed to be his partner. Whatever. So it looks like Suzie, Mickey and Bob are going with us on our road trip to Indy...sweet. It'll be one big partay, lol. Speaking of Bob, Emily, Bob, Paul and I were talking about doing something this weekend. I don't know what, though. Whatever we do, I'm sure it will be fun...yay I'm excited!

      Yay for band! That pretty much sums up today, in a little less than 2 hours, the 2004 Marching Season starts here at LP. Nice, huh? I'm excited. Also, today was exciting because I got to see Paul for the first time, yay! He's so cool, I'm really glad I met him. I wonder if he's reading this...that would be awkward...Hi Paul! Lol. So anyway, I really hope that baritone player comes, we really need him. So, in conclusion, a very good day, and with marching band, its only about to get better!

      Not a bad day at all. Slept until about 11, which I really needed. I went shopping with my Mom at woodfield...we spent an obscene amount of money. Or rather, she spent, it didn't cost me anything, lol. I got a few shirts, a skirt and pink capris. Nice. Most of the stuff we bought was for my Mom. But yeah, anyways, I didn't end up going to Pyde's. Jasmine was grounded and I was relying on her for a ride. That and I just didn't really feel like going. I called the freshmen about marching band today. One trombone wasn't home, another is going to a Carol Stream school. The other trombone, a girl, was doing swimming. So far we're 0 for 3. Then I called the baritone and left a message. Hopefully he'll come because we REALLY need baritones. We'll see. Tomorrow we have to go to church early, and then we're going out to brunch for Mother's Day. It kinda sucks because I'd rather sleep, but I can't complain because its Mother's Day. I guess I'll just have to to tough it out, lol.

      Oh man, thank goodness its Friday! This week has been soooo long. So yeah, Noah invited me to go to this girl Katie's house to watch friends last night. An experience I didn't particularly enjoy. I knew everyone there, but not well enough to really have a conversation with, so it was kind of awkward. I felt a little out of place the whole time. Oh well. Friends was good. Eric Zuber asked me for my screen name so his brother Paul could im me. I guess he saw me in the play and wanted to talk to me, lol. We talked for almost 2 hours, and he seems really sweet. He said he sees me in the hall, but hes too shy to say hi! How cool is that? We'll see where that goes. So I'm thinking Michelle and I might do something tonight, and then we're going to Pyde's tomorrow. Fun stuff. I think we only have like 12 days of school left. Thats crazy! Plus, marching band starts on monday. Yay for band! Lol.

      Pretty normal, average day. Ran the mile, I got 10:53, which was about :30 under what I thought I would get. I thought I was gonna die of a heart attack afterwards. I think thats like a C-, too. Which sucks because I really tried. Oh well. Its cinco de mayo today, so we ate a bunch of food in spanish which was cool. We were supposed to walk around the room in a circle yelling this chant, which was not cool. Oh well, I just sort a pretended to do it and it worked. It was Johnny K's 16th birthday today. Fun stuff. I think we're going to Pyde's house on Saturday for a little shindig. Fun. I'm thinking about inviting tyhe freshmen from marching band to come, but I'm afraid we might scare them off...the boys get a little crazy when they come into contact with caffeine and x-box at the same time. Yeah, maybe thats not such a great idea, lol. You gotta love em though, they're a lot of fun. Oh well. I have a voice lesson...I gotta go now. Wow, I'm talking to my blog...

      Wow. Ok. Hi. The last few days have been...interesting, to say the least. Anything Goes is finally over. I think that because it was my first lead, I really got attached to the play, and the people involved as well. I felt like a little piece of me died on Sunday when it ended. I just felt like crawling up into a little ball and crying. Yeah...so...Anyway, the last performance went really well. And the last performance is never the last performance without pranks...trust me, we had our fair share of those. A lot of the guys put dresses on and danced backstage in the alcoves during Heaven Hop. That was quite amusing. Also, just to freak Noah out a bit in the Finale, I put my head on his shoulder and started kissing his neck. Lol, it was priceless. Unfortunately, I received some unwanted comments from certain people about it...*cough cough*....and for a while I was a little upset about the reactions of certain people, but then realized that I don't really give a rat's ass about what these certain people think about me. The fact of the matter is, that all it was was a little prank on a senior the last day of the show. Nothing more, nothing less. And I'm done. Moving on, we had our organizational meeting for marching band last night. As of right now, in the 2004 Lake Park Trombone and Baritone Section, we have a male to female ratio of...drum roll...5:5!!! 5 girls, 5 boys! THE CHICKS ARE TAKING OVER! Lol, its gonna rock. We can finally have our own sleepovers, too. I'm really excited. And, its John Kasper's birthday tomorrow. Unfortunately, the day will kind of suck because I have to run the mile, and we have to do a lot of stupid shit for cinco de mayo in spanish...gotta love that Spanish 1.

      Yesterday kicked ass. School sucked, I was literally counting down the minutes until I could go home. Then I went home, showered put rollers in my hair and went back to school for the performance. I was really nervous, a ton of my friends were there. But it went awesome, it was the best I've ever done it. I think it was the best I've ever sang, not just in this play, but ever. I was really happy. No forgotton lines or entrances. It was awesome. Kasper and Pyde came, too. So anyways, after the performance we all went to the cast party at Alex's and that was soooo much fun. It was really, really hot though. There were like 80 people in his basement, kinda scary. It was fun though. Noah, Wronski and Zuber all stripped, so it made everything totally worth it, lol. I was dancing next to Zuber and the whole time I was thinking "Oh God, I cannot believe I'm dancing next to a shirtless man." It was interesting. Richie was stoned off his ass, which was hysterical. They started dumping water on everyone, too, that was kinda weird. It did kinda suck that I had to be home at midnight, I really wanted to stay. Suzie wanted to leave anyway, and she was my ride home, so whatever. I think I'll have to find another ride for the party tonight though, because Suzie was saying she might not even go. I was thinking about asking Laura or Wronski. I'm trying to get the parentals to let me stay out later tonight, too. Hopefully they'll let me.

       Sorry, haven't updated in a while...just haven't felt like it lately. Anywho, schools done for the year, finally. We finished finals last wednesday. I got a C+ on my algebra scantron, dammit. I was so close to getting an A in that class. Oh well. There are a lot more important things in my life now than algebra grades, wink, wink :-). I've just been laying around lately...doing a whole lot of nothing. I have to work the concession stand at Springfield Park tonight. Thats an easy $15. Yeah speaking of jobs and stuff, I'm giving a 6th grade girl trombone lessons this summer. Her Mom said she got my name from Mr. Snoeck. That will be good for me I think, since I'm thinking about going into music education. Meh. I don't know how that will turn out, but its a steady $10 a week, add that to my babysitting money, $132 a week, thats a good $142 a week for Liz. I am going to be soooo rich this summer, lol. Too bad my Mom's making me put half in the bank. Oh well. Last parade for the year tomorrow, yay. Thats definitely something to celebrate.

       2 days of finals down, 1 to go. Looks like I'm gonna have a B in gym, dammit. I got a stupid C on my stupid essay so even if I ace the test I don't think it will happen. Dammit. Not my fault...Alexanders stupid. Anyways, as long as I get at least a %91 on my algebra scantron it won't be a problem. I guess we'll see. Ugh, we had the parade yesterday for marching band....boo for parades. My arms hurt soooo bad. Not cool. I invited Paul over for memorial day but he couldn't come so I ended up going to Emily's instead. Yeah we watched Return of the King. I can't believe I sat through that again. Gah. So yeah, I bought a homecoming dress on sunday. It was ridiculously cheap-$42. Originally $169. Sweet. And plus, its red and strapless. Its awesome. No marching band this week, yay! I can't wait till we get our show music and start the good stuff. Parades suck. Anyways, Paul has a surprise for me tomorrow. I have no idea what it is. Emily knows, and she said its something to do with music, but she wouldn't tell me anything else. I'm excited...I wonder what it could be....

       Just got back from babysitting. It was really easy, as usual. I saw I, Robot with Paul last night...it was really good. And we weren't wearing the same shirt like we did last week, so that was a plus. I have band tonight, boo. Really don't want to go. Oh well. Just band tonight, babysitting tomorrow and then Catchstone concert! I'm super duper excited for that. It should be really fun. Its close, and they have a 2 hour set. Its gonna be one big party, lol. I have to go get ready for band now. Boo!

       I just finished giving a trombone lesson. I really like doing that. It makes me feel really good when I teach them something and they do it right, lol. I just taught this girl the G scale. Woo hoo, g scale. It was cool though. And of course I babysat all day. I am just a money makin machine this summer, lol. Its incredibly boring. Oh well. It works I guess.&nbsp; So thats pretty much all I'm doing this week. Babysitting. Meh. Yeah...and thats pretty much it. I'm just full of excitement. I have to go take my crazy dog for a walk. Catch ya later :-).

       Happy Sunday everyone. I'm really bored. I woke up this morning and ran errands with my Mom. And I've pretty much just been sitting here the whole day. I have to go back to "work" tomorrow. Lol, I don't do anything, but I get paid for it. Not a bad deal, but its very boring. Oh well. I need the money.&nbsp; Grr. I'm so unbelievably bored. Just sitting here blasting John Mayer. Fun stuff. Paul came over last night. This is pretty much how we spent the entire night.     Me: "I'm bored. Let's do something."    Paul: "Ok, what do you want to do?"    Me: "I don't know. What do you want to do?"    Paul: "I don't know."    Lol. We had this conversation like 15 times.&nbsp; But we&nbsp;actually did &nbsp;find the cure for hiccups. Don't ask.&nbsp; Yeah...so. Catchstone concert on Friday. I'm super excited. They have a 2 hour set. Its going to be one big party :-). Yay. And thats pretty much it. I'm done now, lol.

      I just got back like an hour ago from Magic Waters. Paul and I went with a 2 of his brothers and their girlfriends. We had so much fun! Even though my sunscreen doesn't work AT ALL. I look like a freaking lobster right now I'm so sunburnt. Damn. The only bad thing that happened besides that was that poor Paul got carsick. :-( Boo. And you know what else really sucks? I have to go back to band camp tomorrow morning. God! Boo for band camp. I think they should just move band camp to Paul's house ;-) lol. I was reading over my old old posts, and I just kept thinking, "God, I was really funny. I guess I'm just not very funny anymore." Lol, its so true. My recent posts kinda suck. Sorry. Just have a lot going on. If my brother has a sleepover here tonight, I will be royally pissed. I have to wake up super duper early for band tomorrow, I really don't want a bunch of strange 13 year old boys roaming around my house. Grr. Anyways, Catchstone had their last show before college on Friday. *tear* I'm gonna miss those guys. Oh boy, my brother just set something on fire. No, I'm not kidding. Lol.
