      You probably already know the Christopher Walken starring  urlLink music video  for Fatboy Slim's "Weapon Of Choice,"   and thanks to the magic that is the internet I just discovered a faithful  urlLink stick figure  flash version of the video.  It's amazing what's out there.

      Tired of hype for the season finale of "American Idol" I've become obsessed with Ryan Seacrest's shocking resemblance to former mtv pretty boy Brian McFayden (hosting on the TV Guide channel these days, and WB's idol parody).

      Today may have had a presidential speech as it's major headline, but this story is what caught my eye.  Here's a bit of the story from  urlLink  SF Gate  : A radio traffic reporter became part of the traffic report Monday morning when the small plane he was in made an emergency landing on an East Bay freeway -- causing a traffic slowdown.   No one was injured in the incident, which happened at about 8:30 a.m. when the Cessna 172 apparently ran out of gas while en route to the Hayward municipal airport and landed on westbound Interstate 580 at Highway 238 in Castro Valley, authorities said.   With the help of a motorist who slowed cars on the freeway, the pilot managed to land in the far right lane and come to a stop in the right shoulder. No cars were hit, and a monumental traffic jam was averted, but traffic slowed as motorists gawked at the spectacle of the red-striped plane on the freeway.   :  My wife used to commute past that area, admittedly heading the other direction, at that time of day until a little over a month ago.  It's just such a surreal scene.   .   Also I'm a bit bummed that  urlLink Morrissey  won't be making all of his  urlLink Kilborn  residency.  Why must I always be so miserable?

      Thanks to a generous donor, I've had a chance to listen to the new  urlLink Miss Kittin   album.  It's a bit of an overwhelming album on the first listen because it is completely uncompromising.  It was my feeling that Miss Kittin would go a bit more pop and accessible than her work with The Hacker, but she went the other direction.  I still have to develop my thoughts and I expect to write out a formal review for  urlLink synthpop.net , but on first listen it is a very interesting album.  It's always good to find albums where people push themselves artistically. If you’re interested in some great photography, then check out the work of  urlLink Electro Swank .  She’s done some great things with models and electronic pop bands.

      A buddy of mine passed the following article from  urlLink The Onion :  Film-School Graduate Goes Straight To  Video-Store Job SANTA MONICA, CA—The theatrical career of recent USC School of Cinema-Television graduate Neil Hemmitt was put on hold indefinitely as the aspiring director went straight to video-store clerking Monday. "The big studios never gave me a chance," Hemmitt said, as he shelved a Big Fish DVD at Blockbuster. "But it's because they didn't understand me." Hemmitt's producers, Harold and Francine Hemmitt, pulled his financial support in March, after calling his predicament "hardly original."  :  As someone with a completely useless associates film degree, this says more about film school than anything else.  I know so many more film professors than people working making films, and all those people I know get paid to work on films volunteered for a decade before getting paying jobs.  What a complete waste.

      I had the pleasure of the seeing the legendary Kraftwerk live in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago.  It was an amazing show and I was fortunate enough to bump into mp3s of their appearance two days later at the Cochella festival at this  urlLink secret location  which I saw on the boards on  urlLink NewOrderOnline .   Speaking of New Order, today is the anniversary of the death of Joy Division's singer Ian Curtis.  A sad time, and I've been listening to a bit of JD to mark the occasion.  Interesting note, Curtis was a bit of a Kraftwerk obsessive and had his band listen to Kraftwerk before taking the stage for live shows years before they would fully adopt electronics as New Order.

      Welcome to my first blog posting.  Let me begin with the obvious question. Who am I?  An avid electronic music fan and internet radio dj.   urlLink Daft Monk's Boombox  is my station and I invite you to check it out.  Beyond that I spend time on the  urlLink Synthpop.net  (where I also do occasional reviews),  urlLink Electro Culture  , and  urlLink SlothRadio  forums.  I also run the  urlLink ElectroPop  group on urlLink Audioscrobbler .

      Score another point for the 80's revival, because tv's favorite cat eating alien is to start hosting a  urlLink talk show .  Well at the very least, Alf is hosting a one-off special on TV Land.  What can I say, it's a strange world.

      I had the chance to see "The Terminal" yesterday and it was interesting film.  I can't say that I loved it, but it was completely involving and a much better than could ever be expected from a stupid premise about a man stuck in an airport.  I had been tracking the films progress and didn't think it would actually get made, but I'm glad that it did.  Hmm, I'm rambling.  The movie is essentially about people who are waiting, which is not the most cinematic of subjects.  The best part of the film is the performances.  The most consistent criticism, other than sentimentality, is that he doesn't do characters, but he did an excellent job getting great performances out of every actor in the film and giving all the characters their humanity.  I'm obviously not expressing my thoughts well, but Ebert did an  urlLink insightful review  that is a little more enthusiastic than my thoughts.  Definitely a movie that reasonable people can have different opinions of, but one I enjoyed.

      If it's good enough for Puff Daddy, then why not?  I just read in  urlLink nme  that Madonna is changing her name to Esther because she "wanted to attach myself to the energy of a different name."  How well did that work for Symbol-Man, oh wait... he just changed his name back to Prince and had his biggest hit in years.  The big M went on comment on others reaction to her recent devotion to Kabbalah saying that "I'm a little bit irritated that people think that it's like some celebrity bandwagon that I've jumped on."  It is so not like Madonna to just jump aboard the latest fad.  She's always dedicated herself to her singular vision of classical style. The latest in the wave of summer concert cancellations comes to us courtesy of Missy Elliot.  She is apparently unable to make  urlLink her UK appearances  because of a shortage of busses for her tour.  At least it's more originally than spraining a leg or something…

      ...Saw this coming.  Courtney Love just  urlLink pulled out of her tour  that was due to start in a few days.  It's amazing that woman can remember to breathe with many, many legal problems (her motto: every week a new court case). And is anyone else "shocked" that Britney Spears also  urlLink pulled out of her tour  because of her recent knee injury.  I just don't know what to do with my summer anymore since Christina Aguilera started this trend of canceling summer tours.  It just breaks me heart :(

      I always thought that Nickelback's boring songs sounded exactly the same and I pointed this out to my wife once as we switched back and forth between their two songs on different stations at the same time.  Well, I was browsing the forums over at  urlLink Pocky Bot  and saw that someone posted a link to an almost mash-up where the separated their two hit songs in different stereo channels and played them at the same time.  It's  urlLink scary  how close they are, getting loud and quiet in the same parts.  Down with bad music!

      What does it take to get national news coverage?  The dominate news story of the week is President Reagan’s death, which is legitimate since the man ended the Cold War, although cable news networks running constant live coverage of the man’s coffin is totally unnecessary.  Talk about morbid.  Beyond Reagan, the country is still at war and the two highest members of the CIA resigned last week.  Is there anything more we need to know about our spy agency soon to have new management?  That might be a big story.  So what story did I hear lead the hourly news brief on ABC radio two hours in a row?  An anti-war protest in Washington of what they said was only about 50 people. urlLink  Here is the only print story  I can find about it (not that I looked too hard).  Hmm, 50 people drum on cans and make the national news.  I’ll gather up my family and friends for a barbaque and see if we make the news!  Also Roger Clemens just  urlLink won  his 9th game this season with no losses yet.  That man is a working legend and one best things to ever to happen to baseball (and he always strikes my team out).

      Tonight I was suckered into even more reality with the new season of “Last Comic Standing.”  I had strong reservations about watching the show, since all I remember from the ads for last season was the idea that it was comics living in a house together (that’s all I need in my life is another snooze-fest like “Big Brother” with people who think they’re funny).  Fortunately this was just people doing their acts, with an odd mix of established comics with tv gigs (the guy from the  urlLink Nick At Nite Road Crew  and that guy who’s always on Collin Quin’s politically incorrect rip-off) and total amateurs.  There were some good acts, and it was nice to see Will Durst, who is a Bay Area comedy staple, win a spot as a semi-finalist at the San Francisco stop.  Once the show the living in a house together part I’ll probably tune out, but who knows, the extremely unfunny yet constantly employed  urlLink Jay Mohr  is the show’s host and producer which might force me to bail earlier.

      It was just announced that Creed are  urlLink disbanding .  This is the best news I've heard in ages, since their bland uninpired blah rock has held radio hostage for far too many years.  I have all the hope in the world that the band's offspring won't have any success and we will all be rid of this horrible plague that is Creed's music. In even better news is that  urlLink Cause & Effect  will be  urlLink visiting San Francisco  in July.  I have been wanting to see the band live for more than a decade now and I'm so happy to finally have the chance.  It almost makes for my not being able to make the   urlLink Freezepop  show next week.

      I happen to flip past C-Span earlier this evening while Bill Clinton was giving a  urlLink speech  promoting his soon to be released memoir.  It was interesting to see him speak, since it has been a few years since he left office, and what a difference there is between his speeches and Bush’s style.  Perhaps it was just the freedom to not be “presidential” but Clinton was really engaging and got a number of deserved laughs out of the crowd.  What I saw of his speech reflected on the creation of the current political climate, and how the 60’s and Vietnam War created much of the divide between the parties.  Nothing too shocking there, but he went on to describe the post-Cold War Republican party as a unified front, as opposed to what he considered himself to be a part of, the tradition of individual politicians working with members of both parties in the spirit of compromise.  It’s my impression, in online discussions and listening to much of talk radio that people have become so polarized politically that common sense and critical thinking goes out the door when politics are involved.  Critical thinking and the ability to analyze is the core of what makes democracy work, so why not use it when it comes to your political views?  Just a thought that I believe more Americans will rediscover soon, although it may take another four years.  (I caught a bit of “Crossfire” earlier this week and was shocked by the complete devotion to partisanship since both sides were taking cheap shots at the other candidate’s Memorial Day activities as being contrived.) Overall, I was left inspired by Clinton’s speech, and was impressed at his willingness to admit his faults, both personal and political.

      It just occurred to me, in the tradition of so many other great thoughts that occur at nearly 2am, that I’ve had Pet Shop Boy’s “Actually” album on my brain today.  I was thinking about the lyrics to “Hit Music” and how it mentions “Tainted Love” and “Love Is Strange” which is the cross referencing you don’t often hear in most pop music.  Then I got “I Want To Wake Up” stuck in my head, probably because of the whole new Morrissey album who was in The Smiths with Johnny Marr who works with PSB and “IWTWU” is his favorite PSB song.  Oh, then I heard “What Have I Done To Deserve This?” on the radio while I was picking up dinner this evening, which is a duet with Dusty Springfield who’s 60’s hit “I Just Don’t Know To Do With Myself” was recently covered and released as a fantastic single by the White Stripes.  So I checked my computer, and for whatever reason I hadn’t ripped “Actually” on to my computer and so I did it and I’m listening to it and writing about it, and it really is a great album.  Also it has one of the best album covers of all time (which they claim wasn’t staged, it was just the result of a long photo shoot).

      My wife and I caught “Shrek 2” over this past weekend and we both really enjoyed the movie.  I was flipping through the imdb  urlLink comments  and someone was talking about the first “Shrek” being, “lauded by both critics and audiences: an uncommon occurrence in today's society” which I find to be amazingly short sighted statement.  Popular movies and critical acclaim have almost always had about the same ratio over time, and things have only improved in relative popularity of critical hits with commercial success with the availability reviews and the rise of the information age.  It helps to think of things in perspective. Anyways back to “Shrek 2,” one of my favorite lines (just a side note; I don’t warn about spoilers, because there are no surprises in life) is the giant gingerbread man’s last line in the movie’s narrative.  For some reason he quotes ET’s final message and tells the Gingerbread Man to “Be good.”  It was just so odd, but I’m into movie referencing overkill, so it’s a good thing.

      Generally speaking, I think the claims that "the media" is left-biased are blown out of proportion, but  urlLink this story  has way too much coverage for something so small.&nbsp; Why is it, that 40 people seeing "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a news story that's been run for over a day on ABC network radio news?&nbsp; So some guy paid for a showing in a 500 seat theater and 40-ish people who are Republicans showed up.&nbsp; What does this prove?&nbsp; That republicans are cheap?&nbsp; Talk about a pointless "news" story.

      The folks at Slim-Fast have apparently  urlLink dropped the ad campaign  featuring Whoopi Goldberg because the were "unhappy" with her recent jabs at Bush during a political fundraiser.  If they were smart, they would have dropped the ads because she hasn't done any watch able work in a decade.  It's time to take some time off Whoopi; you couldn't possibly need more money.  Besides these Slim-Fast ads were the worst featuring a celebrity since the terrifyingly bad Pier One ads with Kirstie Alley.  Why bother spending extra money on a name, when all you're going to do is make them as annoying as possible?

      Saturday night I had the chance to finally see  urlLink Cause & Effect  live after about a decade of wanting to, and it was an interesting experience.  The band put on a good show, and it was obvious why they were signed to a major label back when electronic pop got some exposure from major labels (which it is again, after years of neglect).   I got there, after finding an amazingly close parking spot, as  urlLink Subimage  were finishing their set.  Chris, Subimage's singer/songwriter, did some great dancing and did as well as I've ever seen an opening band do in getting the crowd involved.  I was impressed, and picked up their album after the show.  It's a great album, and they had a real massive sound on stage, so they are well worth checking out live. Cause & Effect did a lengthy set, and played most of their recent release,  urlLink The Sunrise EP  which is a return to form after their miserable guitary "Innermoststation" album from the late 90's.  The band looked fit, and keyboardist Keith was wearing a  urlLink Halou  shirt, and since Halou are from San Francisco and have worked with C&E I assume their were in the crowd somewhere.  Rob was a great front man, and I appreciated his attempts at getting the crowd to dance, but his guitar was way too loud.  I've noticed this problem at many an electronic show, where the guitars are mixed way too loud.  It's not the bands fault, but when your synths are providing a minimum of four instruments at a given time, it seems odd that the guitar would be louder than all of them.  Hard to pick one highlight from the show, but I really loved the ballad-y "Stay" off "The Sunrise" EP, and the contemporary re-working of "You Think You Know Her" was great.  It's just a shame they lost so much of the crowd to the time of night by the end of their set.  We all get older I guess...

      Photographic pictures.  Bright light. Dark room...Oh sorry, got lost in an early Depeche Mode reference there.  So a while back I was at the  urlLink Dekadance Radio Show  20th Anniversary Concert with bands like  urlLink Faith Assembly ,  urlLink Regenerator ,  urlLink Bizarre Love Triangle , and my favorite Bay Area synthpop group  urlLink Moonlife  and while I was there I took a few pictures.  I hadn't used my digital camera in the dark before, so almost nothing came out.  However, I emailed a couple pictures each out and much to my suprise one of my pictures end up on the Moonlife site (slightly lightened up by the band so you can see them).

      It's not very often that I get excited about commercial radio, but recently I've really been enjoying the  urlLink Chill  blocks on  urlLink Alice .  The station usually plays tons of Dave Matthews Band, Nickleback, and Train that is the sort of music I can't stand.  However, during the weeknight and Sunday morning Chill blocks they mostly play calmer electronic music, mostly trip hop and ambient along with some mellow britpop.  The best thing about the program is that it isn't as tightly formatted as most commercial radio because they go beyond the singles.  Even better is that the other night they played a set that included Fatboy Slim ("The Weekend Starts Here") and Dubstar ("Stars") played back-to-back, which were two of my most played artists (and songs) on my college radio show back in 1996.  I didn't think I'd ever hear my musical tastes so faithfully duplicated, especially when no commercial radio around the Bay Area at the time would play those two.
