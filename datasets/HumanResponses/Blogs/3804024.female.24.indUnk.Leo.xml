      Ok, this day just keeps getting worse and worse. I am tempted to just crawl under the covers until tomorrow. Or perhaps even until Friday when my vacation starts! My second trainee did not show up this afternoon. She was in a training all day, but I didnt find that out until sitting and waiting on her for 2 hours. There are also rumors flying around about our unit being...disassembled, ambushed, forgotten. But there will be no warning, and we will go where they put us. Which for me means, probably back into investigations. I feel as though I did my time in that department, but would probably be thrown back to the wolves. Who knows...But then it gets better. I go to Target to spend money (because it helps me feel better right? haha...) I wanted to buy Cold Mountain on DVD and a few groceries. So, I get up to the checkout line, write a check, and..."Im sorry mam, your check has been declined. " His words seem to echo...loudly. Everyone stares of course and im mortified. So, he gives me the number to call and the people say I have an outstanding check to Wal Mart for 208 dollars on May the 8th.  Now, there are several problems with this. One, I dont think I have EVER written a check to Wal Mart for 200 dollars. And two, I was in Las Vegas on May 8th. So, I call Wal Mart. "Oh Im sorry mam, its not your name on the check, but it IS your drivers license number." So, apparently either the cashier wrote it wrong, or someone is using my number. Either way, I got screwed. Needless to say I left the store without anything, besides fumes coming out of my ears. Then I get home, and HE is here. Of course, they are in the bedroom, door shut. My mom comes out and tells me to order pizza, and goes back in the room. The pizza arrives, and they take the entire thing in to their room. UGH. Its just the little stupid things about the whole situation that make me crazy. Mostly, I miss my dad. What he must be thinking..haha. I can only imagine.

      Well, I figured that today was as good as any to start..again..my online journaling. I have journaled almost all of my life in some form or other. It is sometimes the only place I have to vent, or to express my feelings.  It is the one place I can ramble on and on, and no one really cares. It is a reflection of my true, inner self...a side of me that not many people get to see. So, someone has inspired me to restart my online journal, and here I am.   I would almost swear that today was Monday, with the way things have gone. I drove halfway to Houston, before realizing I was supposed to be going to Galveston.  My vacation request was not fully approved. And after driving all the way to Galveston, my trainee did not show up! No phone call, no email..she just decided not to be here. Nice. Workers are dropping like flies. Most days I am grateful to have a job, but some days, I wonder why I am here. Somewhere along the way, between graduation and now, I seem to have lost my purpose. My reasons for starting this job no longer seem to be in the near future, and the thought of failing, has completely overwhelmed me. My desire in life, my dreams, seem so far out of reach at this point; but I must continue to go forward, and be hopeful that one day I will get there. In the meanwhile, I just try to make a difference.

      I heard this on the radio today, and I thought of Cris. I really miss him, and I just wish he would call....  I miss the look of surrender in your eyes The way your soft brown hair would fall I miss the power of your kiss when we made love Oh, but baby most of all  I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again And let the light back in I miss my friend  I miss the colors that you brought into my life Your golden smile, those blue-green eyes I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now Saying it'll be alright  I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again And let the light back in I miss my friend  I miss those times I miss those nights I even miss our silly fights The making up The morning talks And those late afternoon walks  I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again let the light back in I miss my friend

      Yesterday was Sarahs birthday, so Gary and I got together and planned a party for her. I was thinking it would be a small gathering for dinner and dancing. Sarahs favorite things in the world are cheese, margaritas, and dancing-so there ya go! However, it grew rapidly, and we ended up with about 35 people!! It was pretty crazy! We met for dinner at Chuys, and then went to Wild West. I danced like 6 or 7 times. Gary and I danced to Wave on Wave of course-thats our song..haha. Sarah doesnt seem to mind that I steal him for one or two. Clay and I danced to one. And then the rest I danced with Clays brother, Joey. Hes rather cute, but quite the flirt. Hes a lot of fun though, and made the evening interesting to say the least..haha. :)Sarah seemed to have a great time, so thats what counts!! :) Happy birthday Sarah- you made it to the big 3-0! :)

      Well, I havent posted in a few days. One, I have been extremely busy at work. And two, just been in a really blah mood.  After the conversation with Michael, I kind of withdrew from a lot, feeling really low about myself in general. When I got back to work I found out that one of my coworkers is in ICU. He had a massive heart attack, and is unable to speak at this time. CPS will do it to ya I guess. I need to go see him, just not sure I can. Im selfish when it comes to stuff like that, afraid of how it will effect ME. I should go. Today Jimmy got in a wreck, so my sister calls me frantic, as if I know what to do. He is ok, just shaken up I guess. Luckily, Jaden was not with him. Work has been crap. We were out in the EXTREME heat all day today, and it made me sick. I didnt get to eat or drink anything for hours, mixed with high 90 temps...its not a good combo. I was in Galveston all day. I swore on like 10 occassions I saw Cris. My poor trainee probably thinks Im psychotic. Ive picked up the phone to call him at least a dozen times but I dont. And, I dont know why. I miss him a lot these days, probably because I miss him more when things are going crappy. I hope he is ok. And I honestly hope I hear from him soon. It hurts too much to think that I wont. My mom bought a new truck. A Ford F150, extended cab, fully loaded, brand new. Must be nice..haha. She should be bringing it home soon, so Ill get to see. Of course, Ricardo had to go with her. Blah, blah. I dont know what it is about him that gets under my skin.  Hes a nice guy. He makes my mom smile which is a good thing. I just miss my time with her I guess. Things are just wierd in my life right now. If wierd is even the word to describe it.

      Curtis came by today. It makes me sick, he makes me sick. He never knocks and just seeing him is enough to make me repulsed. It makes me nervous when he comes by and my mom is not here. He picked up his bill, and of course had to take two shots of tequila, that my mother found it necessary to provide for him. Ive never understood why she would buy alcohol for an alcoholic who can never stay sober more than a few weeks at a time. (I think he is the reason why that to this day, the smell of tequila repulses me...except in margaritas of course.) I hate him. Ive never felt hatred in my heart for anyone, because I dont think it is our place to hate anyone...but I hate him. And its something that at some point in my life, I will have to let go of. Because he has already ruined so much of me, and my life. I just dont know how to do that yet. I guess its considered "baggage". He is getting remarried this weekend, and all I can think to myself is...is she stupid? You see, the real victim in all of this is her. Just like my mom was...just like I was. And its almost funny to me that he is upset that we wont go to the wedding. Id rather die. He was only here 5 minutes and it was enough to upset me. What a day today has been.  And, of course. Ricardo is coming over for dinner. Im almost glad to go back to work tomorrow, back to the routine, back to the busy life.

      Well, it is hard for me to write this post knowing that the person it is about will more than likely read it. But, on the flip side, I am not going to hide my feelings, as he already knows what they are.  I had felt for a while now, at least a week, or since we had the last "talk" that the feelings I had for him were not mutual. And, I kept wanting him to tell me. But he didnt, which made me hopeful that perhaps he did like me, and just wasnt sure. Or something. But, of course, I was wrong. I got the "I still want to be friends" talk today. And being who I am, I cried. I became upset and probably said some things I wouldnt have said normally. I dont know. Now he didnt bring it up, I did. And I knew the answer, just wanted him to say it. And he did. This has happened so many times in my life, I almost become numb. So, I guess this segment is over. It pushed me to want to call Cris, but I didnt. I left the house to keep from doing so. I guess its kind of stupid, as long as things are going great, Im not tempted to call him. But, whats the big deal. Why cant I just pick up the phone and call. I guess Im trying to prove a point. Which will not be made no matter what, because he wont get it. No one gets it. I dont know what will happen with Michael, if we will still talk or not. I want his friendship, I think I just may have screwed that up today.

      Today is my last day of vacation. I woke up at 7:30am, got all dressed up, and drove to Westheimer and the Beltway for my job interview. I spent 30 minutes filling out an application and taking a personality test. Then, I go in for the invterview. The lady is really nice, and it appears to be going well. Until she looks at my salary history. She says that she can not go on with the interview unless I agree that I can take almost an 8,000 dollar paycut! OUCH. I think not. So, she wishes me well, and I am on my way. I drove 55 miles, and payed 5 dollars in tolls, for nothing. Oh well. :( So much for that...

      Well, I realized a few moments ago, that yesterday was officially one month with no word from Cris. I know that he is alive and well, because I have seen him get online, so he cant use that excuse. And I know he went to Cancun, for ONE week, so he cant use that excuse. But, I know what he WILL say, if he ever says anything. By saying this, I am assuming that I WILL talk to him at some point, which is really sad. But, he will say that he has been really busy, and has not had time for ANY of his friends. Bullshit. Im really hurt by it. I miss his friendship, I really do. I could lie and say that I dont, but who would I be fooling. There are plenty of things that I DONT miss, but unfortunately the good memories seem to outweigh the bad ones in my mind. Its so easy to forget when he was a jerk. Im not sure why that is. I miss his hugs, and his stupid stories, hanging out and watching tv, being silly. Why cant he realize this. Why do I care.

      Well, I am just now writing this post, because last night when I got home, I was too incoherent and brain dead to type anything, much less have any thought processes.  The madness began Friday at 11am. We met at Freebirds for lunch, because we always do before a road trip...who knows why:) We were on the road by noon. 6 of us in Trolls truck..what an adventure. The 5 of us always travel together, but we had a newby. Poor thing. He had no idea what he was getting into. :) We made it to New Braunfels in a few hours, and didnt run in to much bad weather so that was good. We got our room, unloaded all our stuff, and headed over to the clubhouse to help out. It was sunny and nice, so people were out by the pool. The drama started early however, because Tina and I wanted to go to the Grismill, but Sarah and Gary did not. So, we took a stand, and went without them:) We took a cab, which was an adventure in and of itself. I cant even explain the experience we had. But me, Tina, Greg, Angela, Troll, and Jenny all went. It was a nice dinner. Yummy food, nice weather, and great friends. Troll was wound up though, I have never ever seen him like that. WOW is all I can say. People probably wondered if he was on medication...and forgot to take it...haha. We got back to the condo, and Kara had made it. It was great to see her!!! We all changed and headed to the pool. They kicked us out about 11, and then we just hung out in random peoples rooms. Trish got mad, because we were making too much noise, and slept in the car. How stupid. Everyone wanted to kill her. Then, Greg got mad at Troll, because was being really really annoying. More drama. I think we finally went to sleep sometime after 3am. Saturday was the river, then rest, then the dinner. Tina and I got volunteers of the year!!! WHOOOP! That was really cool, very excited. I also finally learned how to play 42. After playing dominoes they were getting ready to close down the pavillion, and Clay asked me to dance. He is such a mess. We danced a few songs, and then we decided to leave. A lot of people went to bed, but Tina and I wandered the grounds, meeting up with various people, talking. Good times, good times. :) We crawled into bed sometime after 2- of course after attempting to wake everyone up:) Got up Sunday, cleaned up, packed up,a nd hit the road. Had lunch, and headed back to Houston. I spent the afternoon at Tinas, as I was going to a wedding with Michael last night at 8. I was so tired, it was miserable. I got all dressed up, and headed to the medical center, where the wedding was. When I got there, I felt really sick. Probably a mixture of being nervous(I have no idea why), no sleep, too much sun, etc. I finally found a place to park(the garage was all messed up) and run upstairs. I threw up. I was washing my face, when Michael called...he was frustrated with the parking garage situation as well. He seemed in a really bad mood. I did not mention to him that I had gotten sick, for many reasons. I felt ok after that anyway. I went downstairs to wait on him. He then called and said that he didnt want to go to the wedding. I wasnt upset or anything, since I didnt know the people that were getting married. My reasoning for going was to see him, and he had asked me to go. Simple as that. So, he asked if we could go to dinner instead, which was ok. I think he would have just assumed go home. I really enjoyed dinner with him, we talked, everything seemed fine. Of course, I spent the first 10 minutes on the phone with my sister, talking about my brother, who got in trouble AGAIN. So, I felt bad about that, since it was kinda rude of me. Michael is really hard to read. Sometimes I feel this connection with him, but I dont think he does. He hugged me when we left which really took me by surprise. I wasnt going to, as I have scared him off enough as it is. It was nice though. Its nice just being with him, even if doing nothing. He just makes me smile, inside and out. But, I g uess thats not really mutual. So, we will see what happens.  This has been another long entry, mostly because I went so long without doing one. It will get better. :) I have a job interview tomorrow morning with the Bair Foundation, which is a private adoption agency. She said they got my resume like a month ago. Interviews never hurt, and im off work anyway, so Im going. :) More later on that.....

      Im determined that peoples behaviors reflect the moon change, or something. There is some cosmic force that makes people do strange things. What a day. I spoke to my friend Aaron this morning, which is a miracle in and of itself. We rarely catch each other online, and when we do, its for just a few seconds. He is officialy a dentist. I asked him to be my dentist but I would have to drive to Dallas twice a year...haha. Anyway, they have postponed the wedding until March 26- a very significatn day in my life if anyone knows. I drove to meet my sister for lunch this morning. Let the strangeness begin. Apparently my brother got thrown in jail over memorial day weekend in new braunfels, and come to find out..he has an oustanding warrant in Galveston County. So, my sister asked for me to find out what its for. UGH. I never understand him, and I hurt for him, becuase he needs help. But you cant help people who dont want help. Its a never ending cycle. Im not sure what me getting in the middle of it will help, but I will do it, because he is my brother-and despite not having talked to him...really..in several years, I love him. I always will, no matter what stupid things he does.  After lunch, I went to Target. More stuff for Toob Trip. Towel, new bathing suit, sunscreen (even though there may not be any sun), tylenol...nothing too exciting. Then I get home, and Im between the computer and my room, trying to get stuff together and start some laundry. I get an IM on yahoo. Its Val. I almost had a heart attack...literally. He acted as if we had never stopped talking....like he never skipped a beat. I, on the other hand, did not have much to say. Strange. Thats all I can say at this point..strange. He apologized, said he is seeing someone, and asked how I was. That was basically the extent of the conversation. I think he halfway expected me to go off on him, but I did not. Then he got a phone call or something and had to go. About ten minutes later, my phone rang, and it was him. Hearing his voice was also really strange. I keep using that word a lot ..hmm..Anyway, we didnt talk long. I didnt know what to say. I will have to ponder this one and write more later. I havent talked to Michael today, he was going to have friends over and such. Hopefully he is enjoying that. :) This evening I shall finish packing, and being lazy. Leaving for toob trip tomorrow morning! WHOOP! :) It should be fun, hopefully the weather cooperates. Well Ive managed to ramble on forever again..about nothing. Ill write more later. Possibly not until I get back from New Braunfels. Sunday night I am going to a wedding with Michael, so we shall see. Later.....

      Well, I managed to watch two movies tonight. I watched Somethings Gotta Give with Jack Nicholson first. It was a great movie, very funny. He is always hillarious though. I probably should have watched it first. I watched Runaway Jury second, which is based on the John Grisham novel. Ive read the book which is good, I love John Grisham in general. The movie was great, kept me interested. Definitely worth seeing. The ending was very well done, and not really predictable at all. Its definitely a thinker movie, which is always good. :)  No other significant news since my last post. If my last post is even there, since it wouldnt show up on the page. Strange.   My thoughts are very rambled at the moment. Just finished the movie, talking to Michael, and listening to Sarah McLachlan's angel. I enjoy our nightly talks. Though, I get the feeling he is leaning more towards us just being friends. Im not sure. I am not going to push anything. Ive told him how I feel, and thats all I can do. But no matter what, I will be his friend....

      I have not posted anything since Monday afternoon so this is probably going to be a long one. Just a warning for anyone brave enough to endure this post.  On Monday after everyone left, I went to get dressed, only to realize I was missing one of my contacts. Which, might not have been that big of a deal, except for the fact that they were my last pair. I had been putting off getting them refilled, because they are so expensive. So, with one eye, I drove to the Pearl Vision place where my prescription is, only to find a sign on the door which read..."closed July 5th in observance of 4th of July. Will reopen on July 6th at 9am." Great. So, then I was forced to go all day with one eye. I went and got my truck washed finally. It needed it really really bad. But, then of course it rained the next day!!! While I was getting the truck washed, I was informed by mom that I would be babysitting my 4 and 5 year old cousins that evening. Ugh. They are pretty good kids. Just not what I had planned for, especially considering how tired  I was. So...rather than be cooped in the house with them all evening, I took them to see Shrek 2. I had already seen it, but it was ok..I knew they would enjoy it. While watching the movie this time, I began comparing myself to the Ogre (sp?). Is there happily ever after?? Does it exist only in fairy tales? Me being the hopeless romantic that I am, have always imagined that happily ever after does exist, and that there is someone out there for everyone. But as I put my heart on the line over and over, I start to wonder. Thoughts to ponder I guess.  I had an interesting talk with Michael Monday night. I asked the question, wanted an honest answer, but then when I got it..I felt somewhat rejected. I know that was not his intention. I appreciated his honesty. But I felt like I screwed up. Like I had done something wrong, as it tends to be my fault in relationships that guys go running...right? So that evening as I layed there, trying to fall asleep...I began having really horrible feelings. Hard to explain feelings. I havent been like that in along time, where I just cried, and felt a hurt in my heart. It was not because of Michael. I know he thinks it is. I think my conversation with him, and the feeling of rejection, somehow triggered it. But, not his fault, nevertheless. Just all these thoughts of my childhood, which was really screwed up by the way, and was ruined and taken from me, because of one horrible person. And I have such feelings of hate for him sometimes. And, when that happens, then I start really missing my dad. So, all of this makes me sound extremely screwed up. But, I have dealt with all of it, gone to counseling-severeal times, forgiven, confronted, let go...etc. But, sometimes, its still there. So, I prayed. And, asked for prayer. And, suddenly, I felt a sense of resolve, and was able to fall asleep. I had strange dreams, and slept kind of off and on. But, that could have been caffeine and lack of sleep. :)  Tuesday I tried to sleep in...after all, I am on vacation. But, no such luck. My mom woke me up to tell me she was leaving and the boys were still there. So, I had to get up. I took a shower, and when I got out, I was getting onto them, and putting them in time out for something stupid, when the door opened. It was Curtis. I feel nauseated just looking at him. I told him my mom wasnt home but he came in anyway. I just pretended to be doing stuff. He, of course went over and took a shot of tequila. Maybe two. I just said nothing, praying he would leave soon. Eventually he did. He makes me so sick. I dont understand why my mom continues to allow him in our house. I guess because she doesnt know all of the truth.  In the afternoon, I met Sarah for lunch. Then we did random stuff to get ready for Toob Trip-groceries, etc. Rob, Tina, and Gary joined us later, adn we had dinner, watched TV. Nothing too exciting.  I talked to Michael again last night. He explained his hesitations to me, and everything made much more sense than the night before. I felt at ease about everything. I have shared my feelings with him, and thats all I can do- just be honest. I have to give him time to sort things out. It was a nice conversation, and I felt better after. It sounds as if he still wants me to go on Sunday to the wedding, so we will see...Hes really great, I wish he would see that someone else really does think so. :)  So here we are at today. I probably left out a million things. But, its hard to remember all your thoughts and feelings for 3 days! That just means I need to be better at doing this at least once a day. Such a slacker Ive been! :) I went and worked out this morning. 45 minutes of cardio. It felt good to get some exercise, since I hadnt been in about a week. I went and got my nails done, and eyebrows waxed (ouccccccccccch by the way). They say that the more you do it, the less it will hurt. I think not.  It still hurts like hell every time! The things we do :) I also got 3 movies to watch today/tonight. Runaway Jury, Somethings Gotta Give, and Big Fish. :) We will see how they go. My mom is making homemade enchiladas tonight..not really for me, but for Ricardo, as usual. He will be here shortly...can you hear how excited I am??? NOT. Well, off to watch movies or something. Will post more soon. If you have read this entire thing, you are probably sleeping by now:) Later...

      Well the gang just left. We had a pretty good time last night, though by the time it was over, I was exhausted! We went to Boondoggles for dinner, which was good. I hadnt been there in ages. After that we went to Seabrook Beach Club. We managed to snag a table and just hung out and talked until the fireworks came on about 9:30.  They were nice, but I think the ones the night before were much better:) But, the weather was nice, and the company was good. So, no complaints from me:) About midnight we were all kinda tired so we came back to my place and watched a movie. Us five together is always pure entertainment anyway..haha. This morning we got up and my mom cooked us a huge breakfast...it was yummy, but oh so evil.  It feels so wierd not to be at work right now. And I still have several days off!! Its great. :) If only I could get some sleep!!! Well Im kinda brain dead and have run out of things to say. I will write more later when my life is more eventful...haha.

      Well I did not crawl out of bed until almost 11:30 today. My bed was just way too comfy, and my eyes way too heavy. But, I managed to get up, and had to start cleaning up around the house. Apparently, everyone is going to come and stay here. We are going to go to Kemah to watch the fireworks, and probably go out somewhere in Clear Lake. It should be fun. Its kind of a nice change for me, as I dont have to drive anywhere!! I think this is the first time EVER. Its kinda crazy how that works. Now, everyone will get to see how far I drive all the time:) It should be a good time though. The weather is nice again:) Although, the rumor is that Brian and Trish, who are Garys friends, are meeting us out. Brian is a great guy, however he is engaged to a not so nice girl? We had the pleasure of meeting her at girls night a few months ago. Shes engaged, and she was flirting with all these guys, and we suspect she even went home with one of them. I just dont agree with stuff like that. It made us all furious, as we apparently have different views on relationships and such. So, it will be interesting to see how tonight goes with her there. But, I will not let her ruin my 4th of July.  Havent heard from Michael today, I believe he was going to lunch with his mom. Hopefully he was able to get some sleep last night, and is having a good day. Time to go get ready......Happy 4th of July!

      If there were ever a time that I were going to ramble on and not make much sense, it would probably be now...  The day started about 10:30am-had breakfast, cleaned up around the house, and did a whole lot of nothing. I left for Tinas about noon, and we spent most of the afternoon laying out by the pool. It was a bit hot, but the fact that the weather was nice, and there was no rain, was very enjoyable! We also ran into Krisna, another friend, at the pool. And Troll brought us food later, which was great as well:)  A little tan, a little food, a lot of sun, and great friends..what more could you ask for on a Saturday afternoon. :)  Tonight I went with Michael to his church for a 4th of July celebration. They had a service to honor all those who fight for our country, and it seems ever so important now, as we have so many troops in Iraq.  Parts of the service were emotional to me, but I tried not to be too much of a big baby:) It was really nice though, I thoroughly enjoyed it. After church we sat on the bed of his truck and watched the fireworks show they had. It was a nice night, and the fireworks were beautiful. The icing on the cake :) After that, we went to Babins for a late dinner. The food was awesome, and I ate way too much. The bread pudding was evil, absolutely evil..haha. I got to hang out with Michael even for a while after dinner. Weve had several conversations about the Shawshank Redemption, and it was actually on tv, so we watched the end. I had a TERRIBLE headache, so I probably wasnt very good company. That and the fact that Tina and Rob kept calling me. They are such a mess.  I had a really great time tonight. I have all these thoughts, feelings, insecurities. I worry that he didnt have a good time, just a feeling I got. But, Im tired...so that could be a lot of things. I should just go to bed. Will write more later.....

      So, I was in the restroom (not that anyone would ever want to know that..), and I was thinking to myself...why do I care that I have not heard from Cris. (If you dont know who Cris is, Im sure you will find out very soon) Sunday will be 3 weeks, but why do I even know that. Why do I count the days. I try to convince myself that I dont care at all, but I do. In my heart, I know I do. Because people who dont care, dont count the days that they havent heard from someone...right? Suddenly, it dawned on me. He is in Cancun with his parents. So then I start to use that as an excuse for him. So, because he was in Cancun or is in Cancun for 7 days, that gives him an excuse not to talk to me for 3 weeks? Not hardly. Not even a little. Why cant I just forget him, completely. No one, except for Tina, really understands my friendship with Cris-if thats what you want to call it. And sometimes, she even doubts me..or him. But, why do I care about someone who cares about me so little? I would never treat my friends the way he has treated me, and yet...I continue to forgive him, and go right back to where we started. My efforts usually go unnoticed, and we pretend that nothing has ever happened, and that everything has always been the way it is at that moment. At the moment when he is caring, and funny, and hugs me as if he is really my friend. And so then at that moment, I thought of Michael. He is such a nice guy- and he puts a smile on my face like no one has in a long time. And just in the short time I have known him, he treats me better than Cris has in the past however many years we've been friends...or whatever we were, or are, or arent. We arent anything, I must clarify that now. I try to be his friend, but he pretends to be that even minimally. So, there is nothing else. I am nothing to him, yet he tugs at my heart. I just want to let it go, let him go....

      Why is it that certain events in your life always seem like such a great idea at the time, but when they are over, you really dont understand WHY you did them.  If only you had known how you would feel the next day?  Yesterday I arrived home only to find HIM there again. Surprise, surprise. So when my friend Rob called and said we are all(me, him, Tina) going to the movies, I jumped on the chance. An escape!We are like the Three Stooges, or Threes Company...or something. However, when I said yes, and jumped in my car, I did not even contemplate the idea that I would not get home until after midnight. And, that I had to get up rather early this morning to come to work, and finish my reports in order to be able to go on vacation. Nope, didnt think at all.  So, we went to Little Pappasitos (which I found, some people are extremely critical of:))...and then we went to see Spider Man 2. Great movie!! There is a part in the movie that I really liked, where Spidermans aunt tells him- "there is a hero within us all." Her comment really struck close to my heart as I struggle with my job, and what my purpose really is, and if Im really making a difference. Perhaps my sentiment was because of the margarita that I had at dinner, but was there, nevertheless.:) So, I arrived home after midnight, and talked to Michael for a while. :) I think I was falling asleep on the phone or something, but he endured it...such a sweetie:) This morning came around much too quickly, and I found myself hitting the snooze button a few times, then inducing large amounts of caffeine as well as vitamins. UGH.  Now I am here, forced to use brain cells that are not fully activated. But, hey....its Friday!!!!:) And in about 6 hours, I will officially be on vacation! WOOHOO!! :) Back to work I go.....

      In three years, Ive said it over and over again.  Some people should just now be allowed to produce children. I mean, we have to have a license to drive a car, to hunt, to fish.  We have to meet certain criteria to go to college, to buy a house, or to get a car. But, anyone, with the right hormonal properties, can have a child.  They are not required to be able to financially support the child, and there is surely no screening process. No class you have to take. Nothing. So there are people out in this world, and trust me, I meet them every day, who have children just for the sake of having them, or for a bigger check from the welfare department, or just to have someone to love them. Its heart wrenching, and when I hear these kids talk about what they have lived through, and managed to survive with even just an ounce of love in their hearts, I hate their parents for what they have done. You try to have empathy, to place yourself in their shoes. But, sometimes, you lose all sense of empathy for people. After interviewing a 12 year old girl, who came to tears when talking about how she tried to dress "ugly" for her moms boyfriends so they wouldnt touch her; and who knew what kind of drugs her mom did; and talked about her moms boyfriend who punched her mom in the face, and she had to watch; and then turn around and talk about how much she loves her mom, and she only wishes she would call her. At that moment, you realize that so many things in your own life are trivial, and stupid. And there are the times when I wonder if my job makes any difference- because the scars are already there, and were merely put bandaids on a bleeding wound. CPS is just one big band-aid.

      Well, apparently the omen from yesterday has carried over into today. HAHA.  I woke up this morning with such a positive, "its a new day" attitude. I had a text message from Michael at 12:15am stating he had just gotten the text I sent him like 4 hours prior..:) But seeing a text message from him first thing in the morning, added a smile. :)So, I thought to myself...SURELY today will be better than yesterday...Riiiiight. They sent my paycheck to Murworth again, so I was off to there first thing this morning. I really still dont understand WHY they keep doing that, but I go pick it up nevertheless. Thats my money!!!  I talked to Tina this morning. Her date with Michael went quite well last night. No, not the SAME Michael, a different one than I know..what a coincidence?:) They went to some fancy italian place. Shes all excited. She tries not to be, but I can hear it in her voice, which cracks me up. We are so much the same sometimes.  Still no definite plans for July 4th. No one ever wants to make a decision, and then of course, we end up doing nothing. Tina wants to go to Bar Houston tomorrow night, which would be fun. We havent been in a while. Plus I will officially be on vacation, so watch out! :) Saturday Im going to church with Michael and to see fireworks...Im really looking forward to it. Ill be happy to see him again. He makes me laugh and smile so much. Sometimes my heart just races a million miles a minute.  Well, its only noon and Ive already- gotten splashed with mud by a speeding vehicle, gotten locked out of my building, and gotten all kinds of crappy email about what I did and didnt do. What a fun Thursday! :) I need to go type up some reports and then head to Clear Lake for an interview this afternoon with one of my new trainees. Will post more later....
