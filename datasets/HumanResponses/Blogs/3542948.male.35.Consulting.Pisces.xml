      You know, France would be a really nice place, if it weren't for all the !@#*& French people.  Germany, ditto. Notwithstanding these hypocritical, backstabbing coward's stance on Iraq, these "Allies" are anything but.  Oh, and the UN, what a farcical attempt at something meaningful.  Talk about a toothless tiger.  I can't even type correctly this topic makes me so angry.  Spain - what a joke eh, cowards play right into the hands of the bad guys.  The whole of Europe, with only a few exceptions, is content with sticking their heads in the sand [if not their rear-ends] and hoping the problem [terrorism] goes away, but it won't.  What a shame.  Love the Italians, the Brits, the Poles, new NATO members.  I suggest a boycott of all things French.  Well, enough said as no one is likely listening.

      Ronald Reagan has died.  Thankfully he can now rest.  When he was President, I hated him.  I hated everything about him.  However, there were two events that I reluctantly commended him for during his Presidency; defeating communism and getting the Wall torn down, and thumping Libya and sending that country into isolation, that only recently yielded fruits.  There is still much I hate about what our country did under his administrations, not the least of which, was the support of the genocidal governments of Central America during that time, however, I can now see the wisdom and courage in so many things he did and attempted to do.  He was truly a unique person for a difficult time in our country's history.  Thanks Ronny and farewell.

      PETA [ you know, the animal freaks ] is a terrorist organization.  Even if it is not listed by the FBI as one, when you apply the same criteria to PETA as is applied to other groups formally listed as terrorist organization, how can they not be classified as a terrorist group.  Their aims, albeit, highly politicized, are to intimidate and instill terror into their targets until those targets succumb to PETA's demands.  I was recently on a domestic airline flight [United], and PETA had managed to place an advertisement in the in-flight entertainment program.  I found it entirely offensive that United would accept their money.  The content was tame enough, but the simple fact that United would take their money concerns me.  Most PETA people are "evolutionist" and also "tree-hugger" types.  So, I find it rather ironic that as individuals, PETA members believe the concept that humans have evolved from a single-cell organism over gazillions of years [yeah, right...], to the top of the evolutionary food-chain, only to eat grass ? Ok, well, when I see someone who is a PETA nut, I like to get a big honkin juicy hamburger, medium rare, and chew with my mouth open, right in their face.

      I hate cigarette companies, cigarettes and smokers.  It is child abuse when parents choose to smoke in front of, near or around children, whether in the privacy of their own homes, in their cars, in public places or anywhere else.  Aside from the fact that smoking is disgusting, unhealthy, damaging to others who have to breath the same air, and a demonstration of a lack of self-discipline and psychological weakness, it imposes known carcinogen on little ones who do not have a choice.  It sets a truly terrible example to children, it defiles the body, and teaches children to use a mental "crutch" to deal with life's issues.  In addition, health insurance rates for smokers are simply not high enough.  Non-smokers end up subsidizing smoker's insurance policies and medical costs in a variety of ways.  I'm tired of seeing little blue-haired old ladies in motorized carts, lugging an oxygen tank while sucking on a cancer stick.  My taxes are going to pay for health care for these irresponsible people of all ages, and I am tired of it.

      I'm not a Democrat, Republican, Libertarian or whatever.  I am registered to vote.  I think voting is not only a priviledge, but a fundamental right & a civic duty.  I've traveled in many parts of the world where this priviledge is not available.  However, here in the US, voter turn-out is pretty pathetic.  We've got an election coming up this year, one that perhaps is more important that some in the recent past, and likely more important the some in the near future.  While I don't buy the propaganda that any candidate would seek to feed me, I've concluded that making a choice of who to vote for in November 2004 is one of choosing the lesser to available evils.  No candidate is perfect, all candidates have essentially prostituted themselves and will continue to do so in an effort to retain, gain or influence the power structure.  This is nothing new, nor should it be a shock to even the village idiots in this country.  I'm voting for Bush.  Consider carefully the world, or at least, the USA, with a choice other than Bush.  On gas prices:  I think the price of a gallon of gas should be $5 or more.  I've felt that way for more than 10 years.  The last 5-6 years has seen an really stupid trend in the US and in other countries to build really, really big vehicles, commonly called "SUVs", although, for 99% of their owners, their is nothing "sporty" or "utilitarian" about those gas hogs.  I feel absolutely no sympathy for SUV owners that are now whining about having to spend $70USD to fill up their tank.  Especially when these people traveling at 80mph, alone in their SUV to work in bumper to bumper traffic, in an urban environment.  Aside from my dislike of these people's vehicles, there is a much bigger issue with wanting to force conservation; long-term security and environmental integrity.  China has just displaced Japan as the world's second biggest consumer of petroleum, right behind the #1 consumer, the USA.  It doesn't take a Rhode Scholar, or even a 5th Grader to see the curve on this ranking over the next 5-10 years.  If we don't curb our appetite, and find alternative, sustainable sources of energy for industry, automotives, and general energy consumption, we will find ourselves in a situation where we would actually have to consider physically securing a diminishing, non-renewable natural resource, even at the expense of military actions.  The sublime motives in Iraq aside, we are in no way really feeling the true crunch.  It will come, sooner or later, it certainly will come to fruition.  On the environmental side, I am no tree-hugging vegan, but the true cost of producing and consuming a gallon of gas is probably close to $10 per gallon.  I have no scientific of even anecdotal evidence to support this claim, just a hunch.  If you break down all the pieces parts from cradle-to-grave (from oil well to exhause pipe) the cost is incalculable.  What is the cost of one lost tree, one more case of lung cancer, skin cancer, one more insurance claim for hurricane damage, flood, drought, or loss of one acre of cropland.  I'm no EarthFirst advocate, but these things, scaled to a global level have enormous costs on our daily lives.  The single biggest contributor to these losses; petroleum-based pollution.

      I've started this blog to make available some of my random and miscellaneous thoughts, pictures from travels, newsworthy items I think are compelling, interesting or just fun.  Not that anyone has asked me to venture into this forum, but, if you know anything about me, you know I have an opinion about most everything and so since I don't work for any major publication, this is a suitable alternative for now.  Hope you enjoy, if you don't then you can tell me why if you feel like it, either way, I sleep well at night.  Anthony
