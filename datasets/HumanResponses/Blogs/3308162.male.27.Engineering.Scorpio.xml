      "There is no so-called blessing. The blessing must come from within. To expect that blessing from others, it is nonsense."  It was on my calendar today. Just tickled my sense of atheism.

      I love Florida and I've never seen it... Strange it is, I know.  I don't know why... Maybe because of Colleen that always talks about it as if it is a piece of heaven itself; Or because of it being so close to Cuba, with her strange past and present, her tobacco fields and cigars I adore; Maybe because of its people, mostly with that pleasant Spanish accent in their behaviour and tongue.   Maybe because of it's shallow clear seasides, at least the way I've heard of... Or maybe because of Hemingway and his love with Key West and all those stories which I get intoxicated every time I think of...

      Being "cool" and funny, needs some very special talents: lot heck of intelligence, good gene and excellent sense of timing. If at least one of these is lacking, the outcome will be being "ridiculous", instead.  ...unless you are in a bar, sitting next to a sexually desperate fella.

      Hey I like it when people share their intimate feelings online. It makes me feel that people have more freedom these days; Not of the "freedom" with its formal definition, but of that kind that empowers them to be more "relaxed", even with their own beings.  Although I wanted to put some links I've been reading lately here, I don't know how to play with the templates to be able to put some. I used to have no problem with that with the old templates, since they were simpler and not as "black-boxed" as the recent elaborate ones are.  Anyways, my first "counteraction": How can I put links on the left hand bar? People?

      It always sucks when you start a new blog. You just don't have anything to say. O well; But it is always exciting. That's why I'm here again: An Iranian from the south Bay with its amazing birds and ponds which fascinate me...

       This is a really interesting thing about this country: If you look in the cookery of this nation, culinary as an art to be, almost could find no sophisticated thing; They invented the love of BBQ and roasted turkey and mashed potato and stuffing. Nothing much left to say.   But they gave out almost all sounds which shook the world: I'm talking about music baby, not war. They invented New Era's music: All the people that were melting in this pot for such a short time, produced the new way which modern man listens to his world.   Fly high, Ray Charles. Shine on. You're never gonna die.

      One week ago, I promised Artmis to start "tha French" with her if I could keep up with my  lingophile  plan for two weeks. The first week is over and I only know five more words: supposed to be five every day and five slangs at the same time...  I'm in love with words and the complications of language. Can't help it.
