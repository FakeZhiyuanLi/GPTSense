						   Okay, so this is new.  Tell me what you think? Should I continue this new blog thingy?  Well, if you are ever wondering what is up with me, and you just have no idea, and you really wanna know (like this is ever going to happen... ptshh) then you can just come here!!!  Cool huh!!?  You should also put my cell phone into your little 'remember these numbers' list, because I don't have any callers, and I'm quite lonely. (like anyone is going to do that one too..[rolls eyes])    So today is June 25th, 2004.  It's my mother's birthday and she is 46.  I actually just turned 16 myself on the 21st, so that feels good. :)    I currently have a job that is really time consuming, and I feel as if I have no free time what-so-ever.  I think I actually need some caffeine.  Basically all I do is call people and ask if they would like a web demonstration of either the BlueWare Wellness Connection, which is an electronic medical records system, or the BlueWare Transcription System.  Or I just do whatever my superiors tell me to do.  Either way, I get paid a decent $6.50 an hour, which is better than most other places I could work.  And yes, my mother is my boss... Which makes it fun both at home and at the office.  But I love her, I don't know what I'm saying.    Hmm... a little about me, I suppose would be good.  Let's see...  I was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I'm 16 years old, I have blue eyes, and blondish hair.  I had metal in my mouth for 7 years with a result of straight, beautiful teeth, :D.  I've been to Japan twice for certain exchange programs.  I'm very much interested in Europe, art, and music.  I play drumset, trumpet, and piano.  I like to sing, but unfortunately lack talent.  And I dance in my bedroom when no one's looking. (they all make fun of me when I do it in public.)  So yeah.  You can e-mail me at misskaitlinrose@hotmail.com if you'd like.  :)  Love, Kaitlin Rose Catherine.

						   Hello everyone!  So yeah, I decided to pursue this cool blog thing.  I think I like it so far.  It's cute, and it's easy, and I get unlimited image storage space.  So that's cool.    Below are pictures from my Japan trip all the way home.  So if you're interested, you can take a look.  Just click on the picture for a larger view.  :) Maybe this one I'll post recently, who knows?  Anyway, enjoy the pictures, and maybe I'll come up with something witty to talk about.  Love,  Kaitlin Rose Catherine.

						   So it's really early right now, and I'm writing online.  I'm supposed to be cleaning my room for the Catch 22/Rx Bandits/Reel Big Fish concert right now, but I just don't have the willpower.  I'm not even sure if I want to go anymore, honestly...    Recently I have been feeling really down on myself.  I feel childish, stupid, naive, and little.  I don't know why either.  I've been doing really good as of late, but I don't know.  It could be because of lack of sleep.  But who knows.  Sigh...  I have no love interests anymore.  That could be it.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just lonely.  I wish I could find out a way so this blog wasn't all on one page...    Things just seem so hard lately.  Work being really stressful, no time to do anything I used to do in my freetime.  All my late romantic interests have girlfriends...  Life just isn't going my way.    Ugh.  I should just get over myself.  I miss Brie.  Love, Kaitlin Rose Catherine.

						   Okay.  So I took my driver's test and am now an eligable driver.  And I'm going to celebrate by picking Mark up and going to lunch at the local place that I really like: The Bistro.    Afterwards, Mark will teach me how to CG my drawings so I can start creating my online comic.  And it will be successful, and it shall go into my art college portfolio.  And I will go to college in Europe.  That is my dream.  Next week I'm going to be in Lansing for tennis camp.  It should be fun, it was last year.  I just hope I have someone cool staying with me like last year.  Otherwise, I wouldn't find it that cool if I were lonerish.  Friends are fun.  Perhaps Mother will let me do something with Jon or Brian during my stay, as they live in Lansing.    Last time I posted, I was really unhappy with myself, but now I'm happy.  And it's good.  I'm really really really excited about my upcoming web comic, and I just can't wait to get started.  I also just bought my brother's present on eBay for lots of money.  I hope he likes it, even IF he doesn't deserve it--the ass.  I miss Japan.  I want to go to Europe.  I'm going to Washington DC soon.  I've been to 25 states.  I think I like traveling.    Wandering Stars, by Portishead is my favourite song.  I don't know why I like it so much.  Maybe because the lyrics are just so... I don't know.  I really like them.  I just dance whenever the song comes up randomly on my playlist.  Does anyone else have that sort of song that they just like ever so much?    I should leave now to pick up Mark.  You should leave comments.  Thy are fun for Kaitlin.  :)  Kaitlin Rose Catherine.

						   Alright.&nbsp; As few of you&nbsp;may know, I spent a week at Michigan State University to study in the arts of Tennis.&nbsp; I improved a bit, and I enjoyed myself for the most part.&nbsp;   A lot of it was, in fact, tennis.&nbsp; And I learned again, what it was like to use a forehand, backhand, overheads, volleys, and serves.&nbsp; They touched lobs, but I don't approve of lobs.&nbsp;   Now they had bad food.&nbsp; They didn't really have healthy food at our disposal unless you're into having salad every single meal.&nbsp; And I didn't really like that aspect.&nbsp;   The dorms are small, but that is to be expected.&nbsp;   The people... ugh.&nbsp; The people.&nbsp; All of them, save for one or two, were all into rap and Ashley Simpson-the poser.&nbsp; Including my room-mate.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; I honestly do not like rap.&nbsp; But that is not the topic of discussion.&nbsp; We could get into it later if anyone feels the need.  The coaches felt responsible to make kids that didn't want to participate in the evening programmes (ahem, me) participate anyway.&nbsp; I was forced to go out any supposedly play Ultimate Frisby. (I read.)&nbsp; The next day I was forced to spend $4 bus fare to the mall and back; I didn't want to go.&nbsp; But I bought a book. :D&nbsp; The day after, I was forced to go bowling.&nbsp; I do not know the reason of this.&nbsp; It seemed ridiculous to me.&nbsp; Some of us just wanted to be anti-social and get the week over.&nbsp;   But I got out of it for a night, thankfully.&nbsp; I went out with my brother Brian, Jon, and Fred.&nbsp; We were to attend a movie that night.&nbsp; They were told to pick me up at 6:00, and drop me off at 8:30...&nbsp; Well, they picked me up at 5:20.&nbsp; We went to Jon and Fred's apartment, (where Jon made me a Portishead CD) then Jon, Brian, and I went to see the Terminal after getting Chinese food.&nbsp; I was really thankful to Brian because he paid for my food and my movie when he is running short on money.&nbsp; He is a really fine brother, if I do say.&nbsp; And Jon is a really good fellow.&nbsp; I like him a lot.&nbsp; After the movie, Jon took us back to the apartment, and Brian and I left to go back to the university.&nbsp; Before I left, Jon gave me a hug.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; That made my day.&nbsp; Unexpected surprises like that are most certainly welcome.  The next day, Mother was to come at 9am to watch me play...&nbsp; Well, she left Cadillac at 9:30... meaning she wouldn't be in Lansing until 12ish.&nbsp; That was a disappointment if I ever saw one.&nbsp; She never saw me play.&nbsp; But I had a pulled hamstring, so it was good because I didn't have to run 2 miles.&nbsp; (happy!)&nbsp;   After that, we went off on our Boston trip!!&nbsp; Which I'll save for the next entry!  Good eve to you.  Love, Kaitlin Rose Catherine.
