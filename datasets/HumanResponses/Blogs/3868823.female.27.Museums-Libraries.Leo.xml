           My heart is broken.  I didn't think that I could feel this way again, but I am.  There is something about the consistency of not being in love that energizes me, so I tried to avoid it, and it happened by accident anyway...because of my d*mn curiosity.  I even tried to dislike him...to get him to treat me badly so that I would dislike him...but to no avail, save him not wanting to talk to me.  Now I have the power of wonder hovering over me, weighing me down with a stack of what-ifs...day after day after day of what-ifs.      It started with my thirst for knowledge.  I'm one of those kids that never grew out of wanting to save the world from itself.  In him I found a kindred; however, at the time, he had no idea that I existed.  So, as I was reading his work, slowly, with pencil in hand ready to write in the margins, that longing to get to know someone crept up on me and injected itself into my heart and mind.  I didn't want to know him at first.  I stayed away from his website for more than a year.  Then I needed some information that I knew that he had because of a third party who knew him, and I looked it up on his website.  I needed further explanation, and very formally e-mailed him about it.  After his erudite reply, I returned to his website and read and read and read, while I fell.      I kept e-mailing him, and, for a while, it seemed like he showed genuine interest in me as a person.  So I went to him and introduced myself.   How do you get into someone's life who has no time for anyone?    Around campus, when he looked at me, it seemed like he was interested --like he wanted to talk to me.  Then, when I would try, he would appear to want to run away.  After a few months, I could feel it when he looked at me.   I would get this sudden feeling, look around, and it was always him looking at me from across the street, down the street, etc.        I started showing up at a cafe that he frequents with one of my friends.  He talked to us the first night.  Then tried to stay away afterwards.  We talked about books. I don't know what went wrong.      His e-mails became brief, he stopped addressing me by name and signing his own.  Then finally, he told me that he didn't want to talk to me anymore other than saying hi at the cafe as we pass each other.  He said that I was too friendly with him when he barely even knows me.  I never once said anything sexual, nothing even about his appearance as pleasing.  I guess I did feel like I knew him from his writing.  He did write some personal information into his articles, and the rest spelled out his view of the world.      I cannot stop thinking about him.  I wish he would give me another chance.  I wish I could tell him everything, but I'm afraid.  I have nothing to lose, but I'm still afraid.  Did you ever meet someone (one way or another) and were bursting to say, "well it's about time you showed up in my life!"  Everyone you ever dated before meeting him made you realize that you were looking for him.      Now, everything reminds me of him: the photos I'm cataloging at work are of where he received his doctorate and where he vacations, the smell of coffee, writing papers, reading anything about society,etc.  I am in hell...a hell that I created, yet I cannot find the exit.  Sartre, DeBeauvoir, where are you when I need you?
