      Well, Tuesday I promised a special GIANT treat, and here it is! I'm kicking off a new section of my site, Song of the Week, with a They Might Be Giants song. Its from their new album, The Spine. Eeach week I plan on adding a new song. The song will include lyrics and an mp3 download. The mp3 download is under trial period for now. I want to see how hard it hits me on my monthly bandwidth. If my host can handle the downloads, I'll keep them up. If not, then I'll have to think of some thing else. So,  urlLink heres the new page . Enjoy!  (PS - Thanks to my LJ friend  urlLink  EnidJane  for the idea.)

      First off,  urlLink here is the latest H*R update .&nbsp; Its a Strong Bad&nbsp;email, and as usual, its great.&nbsp; Homestar is farking hilarious in this one.&nbsp; Poor lil' brudder.. *sniff* so sad.&nbsp; He's got the heart of a champion...&nbsp;  I forgot to post&nbsp;last weeks H*R updates, so since they are a week old already,&nbsp;I won't talk about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the&nbsp;lazy, here are links to them:  urlLink SB&nbsp;Email  and  urlLink game&nbsp;preview .&nbsp;&nbsp;  Also, if you got a chance to check out the  urlLink They Might Be Giants video , you may want to check it out again.&nbsp; If you click on "Directed by" in the video credits at the beginning you'll hear a commentary by Strong Sad and The Cheat.&nbsp; If you didn't&nbsp;the video at all&nbsp;yet, DO IT NOW!&nbsp; Then watch it again, and again, and again. And then again with the commentary!   Speaking of  urlLink They Might Be Giants , I've been on a total They Might Be Giants kick lately.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like Experimental Film and heard some good things about their new CD,  urlLink The Spine , so I went out and purchased it this weekend.&nbsp; Its only my second TMBG CD.&nbsp; I absolutely love their album, Flood, which is the other one I have.&nbsp; The Spine is just as great, and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; Stay tuned for a special Giant treat later this week.  I also got&nbsp;the Guster CD&nbsp; urlLink Goldfly .&nbsp; I've listened to it, and its till growing on me.&nbsp; It's not as good as the other two CDs I have, Lost and Gone Forever and Keep it Together in my opinion.&nbsp; Then again, after a two or twenty listens or so, I may change my mind.&nbsp; Ask me again in a few weeks.&nbsp; Actually I'm kinda digging it now while I'm writing this.&nbsp; Guster&nbsp;has such great harmonies when they sing, and I really like that in music.&nbsp; Plus they have the best conguero ever.  My kitten Charlee has ass-breath.&nbsp; I can smell it from accross the room.&nbsp; See, at first when I got a whiff of it, I thought him or Hanna pooped somewhere in the living room.&nbsp; Then when I got up to investigate, he was just being cute cleaning himself.&nbsp; Then when I picked him up I smelled it more.&nbsp; Then he meowed.&nbsp; I never smelled anything so nasty come out of a cats mouth.&nbsp; I mean, I've smelled some bad kitty breath but this takes the cake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if he is actually eating poop, or just has a bad case of halitosis.&nbsp; I'll have to keep a watch out.

      Much to talk about today.&nbsp; I'm at work, so lets hope I don't get too many interruptions....&nbsp; Wouldn't you know it, I got interrupted during that sentence.&nbsp; Anyway, I guess I'll write chronologically since Friday.    &nbsp;  Friday I had that therapy session.&nbsp; I'm still not too sure about it.&nbsp; I was told that I have very bad posture.&nbsp; Which I agree on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the theory is that I'm putting strain on my neck and shoulder muscles, which causes my headaches.&nbsp; The therapist&nbsp;lectured me about my posture.&nbsp; She gave me tips on how to sit in my chair at work and sleep at night.&nbsp; Then she did this thing where she put her fingers on different pressure points on my head and neck.&nbsp; The best part was probably the neck and shoulder massage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also that she was pretty hot, too&nbsp; =D.&nbsp; I have another session next month, so I'll be seeing her again.  I got back from therapy and started to get ready for our camping trip.&nbsp; I went out to Jackson the night before and picked up my sister, so she was already in Madison.&nbsp; A huge storm ripped through Madison while I was getting ready to go, but luckily it stopped in the afternoon before we got there.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, we had a pretty big group.&nbsp; Myself and&nbsp;my Sister Aly, my friends Tom and Artemis and their boys Gaelen and Eli,&nbsp; and also our new friends Rich and Mindy with their daughter Lyric and two dogs Fenris and Kismet.&nbsp; We got there in the late afternoon.&nbsp; It wasn't raining, but the ground was still pretty wet.&nbsp; The sun was going down, but it got darker much sooner in the woods.&nbsp; That's okay though, it wasn't the first time we set up camp in the dark.&nbsp; Its usually what happens on our camping trips.&nbsp;  We got camp up, and decided to start a fire.&nbsp; Because of the afternoon rain, there was not&nbsp;a dry piece of kindling in the park, which made starting a fire difficult.&nbsp; Tom and Rich went to get some firewood and some friendly camp neighbors also&nbsp;gave us some dry wood to use.&nbsp; We got a fire going.&nbsp; Well, Tom did.&nbsp; After it was going for a bit&nbsp;I promptly put it out.&nbsp; See I have this thing where I can't leave a fire alone.&nbsp; I always have to stir it, poke it, or turn it.&nbsp; I had this idea that&nbsp;I would turn some logs to get the fire going better.&nbsp; Well, like&nbsp;I said, I only succeeded in putting it out.&nbsp; Not to worry though because Tom started it back up again.&nbsp; He's our hero!&nbsp; After a couple of hours most of us went to bed.&nbsp; Aly and I stayed up and talked.&nbsp; We went for a walk so we could see the brightly starlit sky.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's nothing like the night sky when your out of the city.&nbsp; You can see every star in the sky.&nbsp; When you look out at the night and see so many stars you can't help but feel insignificant.  Saturday morning&nbsp;I woke up with my back flat on the ground, which was a bad thing.&nbsp; It seems that my air mattress developed some holes.&nbsp; I had brought a mending kit with me and the holes were not hard to fix, so it was okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon we all&nbsp;went for a little hike down to the lake.&nbsp; When we got there I wanted to wade around in the lake.&nbsp; I had my pants on but that didn't stop me.&nbsp; What did stop me were the   razor sharp rocks   on the bottom of the swimming area.&nbsp; Not to mention the water condition advisories.&nbsp; That's right friends, there were actually signs that said to watch out for green algae and not to swallow the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was weird because there were some kids swimming around, apparently they&nbsp;couldn't read,&nbsp;or&nbsp;just didn't care. &nbsp;We got back from the hike, had supper and had another fire.&nbsp; This time we had much better luck and much better wood, and I didn't make it go out either.&nbsp; Around the fire we told stories and anecdotes of past camping experiences.&nbsp; Then we scared each other by sharing some paranormal and ghost experiences.&nbsp; When everyone was scared enough, we went to bed.&nbsp; But not without thinking what could be out there...&nbsp; Out in the darkness...&nbsp;&nbsp;Out in the dark, quiet woods...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Sunday we got up, had another fire and some breakfast.&nbsp; Then broke down camp and packed up.&nbsp; We had a great time but were both sad to leave, and eager to get home at the same time.&nbsp; I love camping and having campfires, but I cant stand the bugs, which there was plenty of.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got home and took a shower and headed back to Jackson to take Aly home.&nbsp; When I got there, my Mom got me a little cake and gave me my Birthday presents.&nbsp; We had dinner and watched some  I Love the 90's  (which is a great show).&nbsp;&nbsp;After that I drove back home.&nbsp; I was beat tired.&nbsp; Its funny how you do things to relax and enjoy yourself but end up wearing yourself out.&nbsp;   Today is my Birthday.&nbsp; I had to work, but its okay.&nbsp; Before work I went to Pegasus Games to get myself some presents.&nbsp; I picked up the new D&D book&nbsp;  urlLink Eberron  &nbsp;and a new board game,  urlLink Risk: Godstorm .&nbsp; Fun, fun stuff!&nbsp; Plus they were 20% off because its my birthday.&nbsp; At lunch time I&nbsp;stopped at Wal-Mart&nbsp;to get some treats to pass out at work.&nbsp; I saw some  urlLink new Lego sets  and couldn't resist not getting them.&nbsp; I mean, it  is  my birthday after all, and I&nbsp;love Legos!&nbsp; =D  Work is almost over.&nbsp; My friends and I are going to Denny's afterwards for a bit of b-day fun.&nbsp; Got about 5&nbsp;minutes to go, so&nbsp;I'm going to&nbsp;wrap this up.&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of having to work&nbsp;on my b-day,&nbsp;I had a pretty good day.   &nbsp;  One last thing.&nbsp; I noticed that someone is leaving creepy replies in my comments.&nbsp; I'd appreciate&nbsp;that if you'd like to post, please&nbsp;identify yourself.&nbsp; I'd hate to have to block anonymous posts.&nbsp; By the way, whoever you are,&nbsp;nice writing....&nbsp; and if you are who I think you are, its good to hear from you again.

      Just a short update tonight.  I've been staying up way too late lately playing around with this site.  I finished that Chuck Palahniuk book,  Choke .  I think I found a new favorite author.  I liked it a lot.  It was sick and twisted, and funny as hell in ways that its not supposed to be.  If you don't remember me saying, its about a dude that fakes choking in restaurants to be "saved".  Then the people that save him send him money to support him.  He uses the money to pay for his dying crazy mothers medical bills.  He's also a sexaholic and attends 12 step meetings to have sex with the women that he meets there.  Some of the parts are very R rated, if not downright pornographic.  I don't see a movie deal out of this one friends, but its definitely a good read.  Friday, I have that therapy session that is supposed to cure my headaches.  I'll let you know how that goes.  So far I haven't had a big headache all week.  I've generally felt pretty good and full of pep.  Lets hope it continues...  I'm going camping this weekend.  Myself, my sister, Tom and Artemis and the kids, and another family that we made friends with are all going.  I know, that's a big group. So we've gotten two sites.  We're going to Lake Kengonsa State Park, not too far from Madison.  I'm really looking forward to this.  It's been a long time since I've gone camping with my best friends.  Well, thats all for now.

      I have a new Banter board. I got rid of that Tagboard crap.  It was causing Pop-ups.  Now with the help of my friend Shane, I found a much better replacement.  So, uh, banter away!  I made a revelation today.  I was petting my kitten Charlee on the belly and I noticed that, well, her junk is bit too outside for her to be a girl.  Yep.  I've discovered that she's a little boy kitty.  Good thing I gave him a boys name when I thought he was a girl.  Charlee still works for him because of his resemblence to Charlie Chaplin.  I guess I'm a tiny bit dissapointed because I wanted a girl.  I thought Hanna would get along better with a girl kitty.  That would explain their constant wrestling and bickering.  Oh well, I still love my Charlee Kitty!  Here are some new photos of the little guy.  (Man, is it weird saying that...)     Click them to make them bigger.    urlLink      urlLink      urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        Christ, I want to write more, but its 5am.  I'll try to update later.

      Okay there are two H*R updates today.  urlLink Decemberween in July?  You betcha!  Loads of goodies in this one. And...  urlLink A They Might Be Giants Video!  This kicks so much ass!  I had a feeling something like this was coming up since the the Bros. Chaps started doing the H*R puppet jams with TMBG.  Check it out; very cool.  On a side note.  I'm getting rid of the Tag-Board because it gives pop-ups. I'll be finding an alternative soon.

      I meant to write an update earlier.  Like a couple of days ago, but I've had a raging headache for the last few days.  I ended up not going to Gamefest Milwaukee because of it.  I'm starting to doubt my doc's diagnosis of stress headaches.  When I go to bed with a headache and wake up the next day with the same headache, I just don't know.  I mean, can you think of a less stressful activity than sleep?  Well okay, maybe there's one, but I don't see me doing that anytime soon.  Whatever, though.  I'm yet to go to this therapy thing, so we'll see what happens.     urlLink This is how I feel sometimes.   I didn't let my head totally ruin my weekend. Yesterday I went out and got some DVD's for my ever growing collection.  On recommendation from my sister Aly, I got Donnie Darko.  Its very dark, and very weird, I enjoyed it.  There were some scenes that were directed beautifully, and the music was terrific.  I'll have to watch it again, now that I'm over the total weirdness of it.  I also got season one of  urlLink Upright Citizens Brigade  which is a very funny short lived sketch comedy show that was on Comedy Central.   urlLink Very funny stuff .  Not quite Kids in the Hall caliber, but very close. Today I went to see Spider-Man 2.   AWESOME  flick.  If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out.  If you're not a fan of Spider-Man, well I'm sorry, you're  truly  missing out.  Great action cinema, folks.    As I had promised, here is part two of my GenCon story: So there we were, on our way to Milwaukee.  This is when we realized that the brakes didn't work.  I don't think any of us really cared.  After all we were going to GenCon.  And because the car was unequipped of a radio, Jason had brought his CD boombox with.  I held it on my lap while Jason piloted, and Bill manned the parking brake.  The other kid, well, he must not have done anything, otherwise I'd probably remember his name.  Anyway, we got to Brew-town and found a place to park.  We were still very far away from the Mecca Arena.   I don't quite remember if it was on the radio, or just a song that was in someone's head, but somehow we all started singing  Blister in the Sun  by the Violent Femmes.  At the time we didn't know it but that would become our GenCon anthem.  There we all were, skipping down the street like Laverne and Shirley singing, "LEMME GO O-ONNN, LIKE A BLISTER IN THE SUN!" at the top of our lungs like we were crazy people.  We weren't crazy, though.  We were going to GenCon.  We got there, and naturally there was a line.  While in line, Bill gave Jason some of his Ritalin.  Yeah, real smart move there. Cuz everyone knows that for someone that doesn't need Ritalin, it has the opposite effect.  So now Jason was hopping up and down as we moved along in the line.  Bill was trying to calm him down, while I was just laughing my ass off.   We finally got in and bought passes, and still had time before they opened the doors to the exhibit hall at 10am.  We had split up from Bill and The Kid.  Jason and I managed to mingle our ways through the crowd of Dice Chuckers, Card Floppers, and LARPers right up to the doors.  It was minutes before 10. The crowd of was growing restless.  They began chanting, like it was some rock concert.  Except instead of calling for a band to come out on stage, it was to open the doors to the largest gaming spectacle in the world.  "OPEN THE DOORS! OPEN THE DOORS! OPEN THE DOORS!" we chanted.  Then slowly, the doors cracked open.  The crowd cheered, it was finally time.   Jason and I hurried in, to be greeted by a local news crew.  They were filming the chaos that is The Opening.  We hardly paid attention.  We were there to play games.  If you watched the news that night you would have seen a blur of us zooming past the camera, bewildered expressions on our faces.  Like kids in candy stores, we went from booth to booth to see what fun they had on display.  There were demos, handouts, and previews.  Freebies, giv-a-ways, and of course booth babes.  Jason and I stuck together for the first hour, but then decided to split up and meet later.  After my first few purchases I noticed that my wallet, bulging with twenty dollar bills, would be a pick-pockets dream.  I took out $100 and put it in a counter pouch that I tied to my belt, then tucked it into my pocket.  Then I went on my merry way. I met back up with Jason.  He said, "I've got something to show you."  "What is it?" I asked.  Then he revealed a mint condition Beta Edition Black Lotus. Now this puppy was the grand-daddy of Magic cards.  Very powerful, and extremely rare, it was a wonder in its own.  "Holy. Shit." was all I could say.  I think he paid about $200 for it.  Maybe less, I don't quite remember, but it wasn't cheap.  We learned that Christopher Rush, the artist that did the art for the card, was at the Con.  We met him and Jason had him autograph the card.  A move that would make collectors cringe.  But what did we know, being the dumbass teenagers that we were. After that, we met up with Bill and The Kid again and we all showed each other our spoils.  We all opened dozens of packs of Magic cards, scanned pages of game books, and sorted through the free stuff handed out.  We talked about what booths had the best games.  We looked through the schedule to see what events we could to.  Then Jason and I remembered that we wanted to be at a booth at a certain time to play a game, so we hurried back to the exhibit hall.  It was at this time when I noticed something was missing.  My little pouch.  It was gone.  Along with the dice, game counters, and  $100  that was in it.  I couldn't believe it.  There went an entire paycheck.  Two whole weeks of washing dishes, gone.  I could have dropped it anywhere.  We retraced our steps.  We asked lost and found.  We came up with nothing.  I mean, who would claim a pouch with $100 in it? After my loss and Jason's purchase we didn't have much money left to do anything, so we decided it was time to leave.  We were tired, exhausted, and our feet hurt.  We meandered back to the car still buzzing about the days events.  We collapsed back into the Sky Blue Chevette of Death and headed back home.  We were leaving GenCon.  Even though I lost the money, I still had a great time.  I still had a bunch of neat stuff that I did buy, too.  It was a day I will never forget, well maybe except for The Kids name.  For the life of me, I still can't remember him.

      This weekend is  urlLink Gamefest Milwaukee .  I really want to go but I can't find anyone to go with me, and I'm a dork and don't want to go alone.  I've asked everyone, they're either busy, broke, or not interested.  Well, my sister might go, if she can scrounge up some cash.  And Jason may be able to go, so I don't know.  It's at the Midwest Express Center, where  urlLink GenCon  used to be.  Gamefest is no GenCon, but its also not 500 miles away and not as expensive.  So it's something at least.    I remember the first year I went to GenCon... (Cue Flashback) I think I was about 16 or 17.  My best friend Jason and I really dug Magic: The Gathering at the time.  It was my first real introduction to gaming.  I had a mild interest in D&D, and other RPGs, but Magic was really fun, and easy, and also very addicting.  Jason told me about this GenCon.  He said it was the greatest place in the world, and I would love it.  "We HAVE to go!" he said, and I said "Okay."   The only trouble was, being poor teenagers without cars, we had to figure out how to get there.  Well as it happens, Jason managed to come up with a car. It was this sky blue Chevette that was in his yard.  Where it came from, I have no idea.  It had flat tires and four foot tall weeds growing around it.  "Does it run" I asked him.  "I don't know.  It's supposed to" he replied." "Cool" I said.  So we spent a day cleaning it out, and sure enough it ran.  Now, this Chevette, was a death trap.  What at piece of shit.  The brakes hardly worked.  In order to stop we had to use the parking brake.  The speedometer was off, and I don't think the gas gauge worked at all.  Come to think of it, I don't even think it was registered.  And worst of all: NO RADIO.  But, being stupid teenagers with a goal, we had no idea how dangerous this car was. There is no way I'd get in that car today. Now we had to figure out how to get money.  Jason had a job and some money saved up, and I had a job washing dishes at Buchel's Colonial Haus.  I needed some money so I asked my boss for a  $100 advance on my paycheck. He asked "What do you needit for?" I said, "Um, I'm going to GenCon."  Then he said, "Okay then".  I managed to have another $100 in the bank, so I had a total of $200 bucks to spend.  I was RICH.   So, now we had a ride, and we had money, so we're all set to go.  The night before the Con we went to get Jasons friend Bill, and some other kid I don't remember.  We stayed up late playing Magic, and talking about what we wanted to do at the Con.  We were giddy as hell.  It was like the day before Christmas.  The next day, we woke up bright and early piled into the Sky Blue Chevette of Death and headed to Milwaukee to (fanfare) GENCON!!!    Tune in tomorrow for Part 2.  Its late and I should go to bed.   Some Previews: Jason buys a Black Lotus!  Tim loses $100!  We don't die in the Chevette!

      Well, my new blog is done now.  For the most part, at least.  I still have a bit of tweaking to do here and there, but I'm satisfied with the way it looks.  I think its nice and spacious, and the view is terrific  =) .  So, what do you think?  I'm a bit concerned about the overall visibility of it.  I've managed to find a translucent background to go behind the text ( urlLink thanks to someone that was kind enough to make them ).  That way you can read the text but still see the background image. There is still some areas where the text is a bit messed up, but if you scroll a bit it will show up better.  But, if you find that its unreadable, let me know. My intention is for this site to be a bit more than a blog.  Although that will be its main function, I'll also have photo's, music, gaming and hobby stuff, and things I generally think are cool.  Stay tuned for more in the future.  On my way to work today I saw quite possibly the greatest redneck invention ever.  Have you ever seen when someone takes the back end of a pick-up truck and converts it into a trailer?  Usually its missing a bumper or is rusted all to hell, and is some godawful color.  The one I saw, was this calf shit yellow color and was indeed missing the bumper.  So what is that called, a pick-up trailer?  Remember that little  urlLink rant from the other day  about not having a Gmail account?  Well, luck would have it that I was graced with not one, but  two  Gmail invites today.  One from Amber and one from Shane.  I already set up the one Amber gave me, and will be emailing all my important people to let them know my new address.  The one Shane gave me I'll probably give back to him.  Unless he lets me keep the invite, then I'll give it to someone else.  It just goes to show that if you whine - er, rant about something enough, you'll get what you want.  Either that or I have very nice friends =D .

      Welcome to August, the fastest month of Summer. August is the month that you do everything that you put off all Summer in. And it all goes by so fast. Before you know it, its September, and you still haven't done anything you've put off all Summer to do. So, I'm not even going to kid myself into thinking that I'll get anything accomplished this Summer. Or even this year for that matter, because before we know it will be October, and too cold to do all those Summer activities. Sometimes I wish I weren't so damn lazy. This update, in fact, is three days later than I wanted it to be. Among the things I'd still like to do while the weather is still nice are: Go to Six Flags, go to The Dells, camp at Nicolet National Forest, ghost hunt with my sister, my Fantasy Football League live draft, and get my brakes fixed. I'll be lucky if I do three of those things. Oh yeah, not to mention a dozen or so movies I want to see.  The greatest. game. evar. just came out this week. No, not Doom3. I'm talking about...  urlLink PEASANTS QUEST!  It's put out by the Bros. Chaps, the guys that do  urlLink Homestar Runner . If you've ever played any of Sierra's old  urlLink Kings Quest games , this is kinda like that, with Bros. Chaps twist. I finished the game with a 134 out of 150. There's probably a lot more secrets to get that I still have to figure out. If you need any tips, lemme know! Also, H*R has an new games page.  urlLink Check it out  its cool.  There's a new  urlLink Song of the Week  up. It's a version of Call and Answer by Barenaked Ladies that was recorded at their concert in Milwaukee last month. I know you're thinking "So what, it's Call and Answer" or even "So what, its Barenaked Ladies," but I assure you that this recording is worth the listen.  One last thing...  There's a girl at work that I like.  I may actually have a chance with her, only I'm too chicken shit to ask her out.  ARGH!!  That is all.

Meat and mead for ever more, well until Ragnarok, anyway, when you will do battle with giants, giantesses, dwarfs, elves and Nidhug, a dragon who likes to nibble trees. Odin is great!

      Well we have been back from camping for a couple of days now. I did not write sooner, because of thr fact I was, and still am completely exhausted. Camping is supposed to be R&R, but for some reason I am just wiped out. Tom was wiped out as well. Maybe, because I am pregnant and the fact that we went on a super long hike may have something to do with it. Tom was hangingout cuddleing with Gaelen and noticed a bump at the base of his skull. Turns out it was a FUCKING TICK! What the hell? Tom pulled off the tick right away, and extinguished all life out of the dirty little bastard. How dare it try to eat my son! He is almost three years old for christs sake! Hehehehe.... Anyway Tom crushed it, and it had no blood in its body so we think that it had not been attached for long at all. It did come with a piece of Gaelen's skin though. To top it off the Mensen's daughter wound up getting poison ivy....My legs got eaten alive by natures favorite vampire (the mosquito). I counted today, and there are about 25-30 below my knee on each leg. We had fun though, and I look forward to camping again soon! Except maybe....when people decide to tell scary stories....I just freak myself out alot. Nothing like a nice scary story to get the blood pumping.

      We are going camping this weekend. Myself, Tom, our boys, Tim, and the Mensens, another family that we have become friends with are all going. It's a big ass group, but the Mensens got their own site. We're going to Lake Kengonsa State Park, it's not to far from Madison. I'm really looking forward to this, except maybe the part where the Mensens bring their HUGE FUCKING DOGS! One is a wolf and the other is like a lab mix. I love dogs, but these should be left at home, especially when Tim is not fond of dogs. However....it is not my call. It's been a long time since we have gone camping with our Timmy...Our best friend. Wo0t...this will be some much fun...I hope.....

      Well how do I start? Sorry it has been so long since my last update, but things have been a bit off center lately. We found out on the 10th of this month, that we are going to be having another child. This will make our third. I took a home pregnancy test on the 10th and thats how we found out. We were not going to have another child until our oldest (Gaelen) was five, but as the fates would have it...we are now going to have a third. I told Tom, and he just kind of blinked...(blink, blink, blink). After the initial blinking was finished, he became uber excited. The only downside is that we need to start all over with baby things. You know things like cribs, clothes, bottles, and the like. I am VERY excited about the idea of another member to the family. Tim gets to be uncle Timmy and Godfather to yet another of the Wetzel clan. WILL TIM SURVIVE????? You are a great guy Tim and we love you lots, thanks for being our friend, member of the family, and Godfather to the kids.....You ROCK!!!!

      Mmmmm bacon.......It is so yummy! I put it in the microwave so it could soak up lots of  radiation, then ate it all. Maybe I will mutate now! Actually microwaves have microwaves that are actually radiowaves. Sounds confusing....At any rate it would still be cool to mutate.    This nonsensical ramble was brought to you by:.........BACON

      Some would say that I am long winded....but I just love to write.  Did anyone tell David Eddings that he was long winded?  How about Stephen King?  So why then am I considered "long winded?"  Its ok...I guess I do not mind, because I am doing what I enjoy.

      First no one really reads my LiveJournal, except maybe a select few. So then I come here and creata a blog....I did this in the hope that maybe I would get more exposure here. However...all this has really done is create more work for me. Its a good thing that I love to write, otherwise I would just say "fuck it" and shut this blog down. I went to work today...I am amazed that I still like this job, but it is only Subway. If you can fog up glass you can work at Subway. I actually do not mind the work, and I get free food all the time. When I got home today I noticed that the light fixture in my kitchen was falling off of the ceiling. I'm thinking "boy that would really suck if it fell on my boys". Actually it would really piss me off. I would wonder about the stability of our townhouse. I feel like I have had a crappy day, but it has been pretty good thus far. I'm not really sure what put me in this mood. I think it was the light fixture. Anyway...I got home today and I was greeted by a barrage of hugs and kisses from my guys. I love my family, and it is so awesome to come home to my husband and my two boys. Now I am hanging out listening to the local lawnmower guy, and taking deep breaths of freshly mown grass. I love that smell. I am looking forward to going camping on the 16th of this month. The only draw back to that day is that I will be missing the season premiere of Stargate Atlantis. Maybe I can get Shane to record it for me?  I am sure that it will be on the Friday after next, but its not the same! Tomarrow on July 9th the season premiere of Stargate SG-1 comes on. Wo0t...I am excited! I'm sitting here typing away crazy right? Well I look down at my keyboard, and I notice that the keys have some kind of weird looking substance on them. It appears to be pizza sauce, but the last time I had pizza was last week sometime. Now I tend to be very anal about some things in my life, and my electronics/computer area is one of them. So anyway...I was getting irritated at the thought of my being careless with my keyboard. Upon further investigation, I notice that it is not pizza sauce at all, but in fact it is (dun, dun, dun) my very own crimson life force splattered upon my keys. I am now sitting here stunned, trying to figure out when, and how I cut myself. Its annoying, because here I was ready to blame my kids, when it is my own self neglect, and not paying myself any mind at all. But hey...my kids are always touching my electronics. I freak out when anyone goes near any of my toys. If they get broke, then I want to know that I was the one who broke it. Well there you have it...A classic example of the chaos that is me. Now that I have sucked you all in and brought you all to the darkside, I can just sit back have some chips and a soda and watch as the future unfolds. You have used all your darkside points, and if you have not then you gain 4. Muwhahahahahahahahahaha.

      One Bad Ass Superhero    Before Xena, Buffy, or the amazing Lara Croft there was Wonder Woman, the hottest superhero ever to grace my television.   Some of you probably watched the show during its three-year run on ABC. Based on the 1940s  "Wonder Woman" comic books, the TV series was born in 1976. Set during World War II, the show found Wonder Woman working undercover as mild-mannered Diana Prince, a War Department employee.   Wonder Woman sprang into action, whenever duty called. Diana would spin to transform into Wonder Woman, and being armed with a magic belt giving her tremendous strength, bullet proof bracelets, a tiara that could be thrown as a returning weapon, and a lasso that could force the strongest willed individual to tell the truth. To top it all off she would proceed to kick some serious villain ass.  I grew up watching the show and was in absolute awe of Wonder Woman. She was a true role model for girls in the '70s. Back then; everyone wanted to be Wonder Woman on Halloween. Actually, kids… not to mention adults (both men and women) still dress up as the all-American superhero to this day. Sadly, I couldn't get my hands on a Wonder Woman costume as a child, and my mother was so not a skilled seamstress to be able to make me one, so I had to settle for some rag tag bum outfit. Sad, isn't it?    Anyway, all the memories and feelings I have associated with that astounding show, it's interesting to watch again "Wonder Woman" as an adult. While I took the stories to be oh-so-true as a kid, they seem pretty silly now. Case in point: Episode #6, entitled "Wonder Woman vs. Gargantua!" Wonder Woman battles a powerful circus ape that's been secretly trained by the Nazis to nab a highly valued United States informant. The series special effects…  particularly the sequences in which we see Wonder Woman flying in her invisible plane…  just can't compare to what's possible now.    Having said that, "Wonder Woman" still totally… beyond a shadow of a doubt is way kick ass after all these years. The key to the show's enduring appeal is the actress at the heart of it all: Lynda Carter. Carter who was a former Miss USA with very little acting experience when she was cast in the title role, and watching the show again all these years later, you come to love and respect what a great job she really did. Even though the situations were often somewhat outrageous and the special effects were unconvincing, the charismatic and charming…not to mention gorgeous… Carter somehow made it all believable. Wonder Woman had to have at least a 30 charisma.   It's pretty hard to imagine any other actress playing the role of Wonder Woman. That would probably explain why a big screen movie has only been discussed and yet to be made, any despite talk about the potential project over the years. There was a "Wonder Woman" TV movie made in 1974 with Cathy Lee Crosby in the lead role, but it was awful (no offense to the lovely Cathy Lee Crosby). It’s just that no one plays Wonder Woman like Lynda Carter. Long may the memory of Wonder Woman always live on, in the hearts and minds of those who will remember and those who will discover the LEGANDAY…WONDER WOMAN!!!

                                                                               I did the unthinkable today; I actually shut my TV off when I went to try and sleep. I never shut this thing off unless I’m going to be out of the house for an eon of hours. It’s on twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, which is actually better for it than repeated offings and onings. At least that’s what I tell myself. Still, you can imagine what an event it is for me to actually hit the off switch. So, I curled up to sleep, and found I couldn’t. I heard every little noise; every creak of floorboards, every settling of windowsills, every crick, and crack. I resorted to turning the radio on very low, just so I could have something going. Even that wasn’t enough. Apparently, as annoying as it is to be addicted to, it’s a sort of lullaby to me, in a way. I’m so used to it, that I’m not certain how to sleep without it. The noises, I suppose, wouldn’t have been quite so deafening to my nerves, if I hadn’t experienced the joys of finding a squirrel in my house yesterday; so every time I hear a noise, now, I think it’s another one. I like squirrels just as much as anyone else, but my boys would try to catch it. I’m sure there’s nothing in here, I’m sure it’s just my imagination, but I still want to go back to the days when all I had to worry over was whether Mulder and Scully were going to kiss or not!

                                                           The Hero   The times we have are few, and they should be valued.  Never forsake those whom you love in your life, for they are the ones who will carry you in your time of greatest need. Like those who have come before, lets us hold onto the hope that one day we will all see each other again. Let us hope that we have the knowledge to repair that, which is broken, and forever forge on into stories of legends.   Heroes come in all forms, and it is sometimes the smallest that prevail, and shine through the darkest times. I shall walk with you into death, and accompany you into the halls of heroes. And they shall call your name from the highest mountain, and it will be heard from one end of the world to the other. They will call you friend…  Monuments shall be fashioned where your boots have trod, and your deeds will be taught in the halls of learning. For you have brought peace, and restored the light that had faded.
