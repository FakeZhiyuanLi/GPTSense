						   Before I start ranting, I've decided to use this 2nd entry as a bit of an introduction.  I'm not in a habit of using my name online, but my nickname/stage first name is Liz. So you can call me that. My e-mail address is at mcprincess31@yahoo.com (drop me a line whenever-) and you can IM me at PrincessSlamDunk (AIM).  I'm a 17 year old Republican girl. Wow. Right? As if I wasn't strange enough- I'm also an aspiring actress. It's hard to walk into work and everyone is like "Hi, Liz. KILL BUSH!" It's seriously the only sentence they utter when they discuss politics.  It's like "Dammit, the coffee machine broke!" *shake fist for extra drama, remember, we're in a theater* "DAMN YOU, BUSH!"  And I look at them from the corner where I'm reading a copy of  Letters To A Young Conservative  (by Dinesh D'Souza, wonderful book by the way!) and just go on reading. Sometimes they're intelligent enough to look at my book for five minutes, and go "You're a conservative?" But that's unless I don't argue with them about politics first.  Due to my political affiliation, a lot of the people I work with regard me strangely or don't talk to me. I mean, really. Like, once they find out that I'm a conservative, they give me that smile like "Oh, another naive one" and ignore the topic. Although that may be because I don't shut up once I'm started.  They also wonder how I can be pretty religious and be an actress. I will strip onstage if I had to, kiss another woman, anything, because that's acting to me. But I will never say anything against my religion, and I don't mean religion jokes- because, hey, I love race and religion jokes, but anything really bad. I won't do it. I guess it's strange, but that's just...moi.  I sometimes feel the need to stretch the fact that I'm a log cabin Republican, especially when I'm talking to my gay friends. Honestly, some of my friends have no political compass whatsoever and become liberals simply because they want to be married. And I could have been like that, except I looked at all the other issues that I believed in, and decided that I was too anti-liberal. I'm glad that I found a group that has my beliefs.  And I do a lot of reading on history and politics. And although I read, watch the news, and research much more than you're average teenager, I don't KNOW everything. And I'll admit that. I hate getting into arguments with adult liberals, that name one fact that I didn't know. And when I'm pondering it silently, they go "AHAHAHAH! Got you, conservative!"   (Yes, these are adults doing that.) Do they think that in order to win an argument, I have to answer every second? I could probably just spit off random words, and win, as long as I'm talking faster.  I really could have became a liberal (there was a chance), if the party was like it was during John F. Kennedy's presidency. I believe that after that, the Democratic party began to slowly corrupt and stray away from what it originally stood for. People tell me that it was after Lyndon B. Johnson (don't know enough about him to make a well-researched statement) that it started to happen. Maybe so, I've got a biography of him next on my reading list.  Anyway, any more questions- I'll probably write more later, but there's me, in an extremely big nutshell. :) ~Liz

						     urlLink michaelmoorehatesamerica.com    I just started to research this documentary a few days ago. I had heard of it awhile ago, and never looked into it.   Even though the movie is not out yet, backlash is definitely starting. They condemn Michael Wilson, the director of the film. Reading some of these comments, I believe that the people defending Michael Moore are complete hypocrites. Why is Michael Moore, a man who practically admits that his film is liberal propaganda, allowed to make such a film, while a man who challenges him is  stupid ? If you're allowed to speak against our government, why can't we speak against YOU?   Here are some lovely quotes that I have collected from message boards and such. The quotes are in italics.   "Absolute fool. If you are so behind Bush then tell me why, and explain what has driven you to feel so aggravated by Moore that you have devoted a whole site to a malicious pack of innuendo and lies???"   Number one, I try not to say this to people, but you are an idiot.  I'm not sure if this is directed to another post writer or Wilson himself. But I will go with my intuition (which may be wrong); I think that she is referring to the site owner. Anyway, here's my take: Michael Moore has made his movies and books on matters that have aggravated him.  He has made millions of dollars making anti-American statements, challenging the government that aggravates him so much, in books, films, everything. I don't understand what makes it so bad when people challenge him. Why can't we do that?! Jesus Christ. And so what if the site makers dedicated a site to that? Uh, that's the lovely free speech that liberals embrace...yeah, we like free speech too.  *from the same site:  "No wonder the world thinks Americans are a pack of nincompoops."   Yes. When a child doesn't get what they want, they think that their parents are total 'nincompoops' too. When America doesn't go your way, we're idiots. I bet that if we did every single thing you wanted us too, it would all be okay. Right?   "Michael Moore is just one man with one man's opinion, that's all. No one has to agree with it. It seems to me that everyone doing the *****ing about him is just jealous that they don't have the same outlets and publicity he does."   Michael Moore is one man with his opinion, okay. We don't have to agree with it, but of course, we're not allowed to make a movie that's against him. Because we're just jealous. Nyah nyah nyah nyah. *end sarcasm*  I'll go find more and post on this. I promise you, I will see this movie, and I may even disagree with points on it. People think that just because I'm conservative and am a Bush supporter means that I kiss his ass.  No, I don't agree with his immigration policies, and I'm a Log Cabin Republican, so I don't like all the whoo-hah about marriage only between a man and a woman (although they do have a point, but I can't agree).  But I can't wait for this movie, I don't think that this is just a conservative thing, it's for people to finally see the truth about it. I'm researching the film Fahrenheit 9/11 and such before I even see it, and even this new film I'm researching. I keep hearing friends call me and telling me that they loved the film F 9/11 when they don't know anything about our government. It saddens me that some people just won't go out and research, and buy everything that's laid out before them on the screen.
