      The time is 8:58 a.m.   The location is the ninth floor of a building on West Third Street.  All I hear is the occasional ringing of the phones and muted conversations from the reception area.    The only activity going on around me is the tissue paper under me, moving as I shift to get myself comfortable.   I hear a light knock at the door, followed by a gentle entrance by Dr. Golden, an orthopedist.    This is how my morning started off.  Due to my "spranged" arm I was forced to go see a doctor to make sure that things were as they seemed.  As I told Dr. Golden what had happened to my arm/elbow he nodded and took out my x-rays.  He took a look at them for about ten seconds before announcing, "You broke it."  I gasped and blurted out, "What??? Are you serious?"  What I thought to be a spranged arm ended up being a broken bone that had miraculously healed in place.  He reassured me that I didn't need any surgery because it had healed properly but that I might need to see a physical therapist because my range of motion might be greatly affected if I didn't exercise it.  Then he started joking about how he feels so bad about how much he has to charge for people to see him; that it's ridiculous.  It made me laugh.  I always thought those things but it was refreshing to hear one of them say it.  I thanked him and made my way down to the street below.    As I waited for my sister, I felt so much lighter than I had before seeing Dr. Golden.  I held up my head a bit higher and smiled more.  When my sister pulled up, I was so glad to see her and couldn't wait to share the news with her.  She said that it's quite odd how God puts so much on me sometimes, especially physically, but how He provides that much more for me to get through it.  The fact that my arm had healed in place despite my lack of careful treatment, thinking it was just a sprang at first, blew me away...how God is always in my midst even if I don't FEEL Him there.   I left my sister smiling, spent some time at Starbucks Coffee writing my thoughts out and thinking of all the great times I've had at coffee shops...and I couldn't help being overcome with gratitude to the God that had been there starting from the past when I didn't know Him, had seen me through my various trials, and continues to love me apart from the fact that I've been nothing but rebellious, disobedient, and displeasing to Him...  As I walked to work from Starbucks, my face started to become warm thinking with sorrow at how wretched I am, yet how He blesses me and allows miracles to occur in my life...why He does, I will never be able to fully grasp...

      Today, my sister and I ran some errands in and around 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica...  It was the first time in a REALLY long time that I had a great time, without much attitude towards my sister, while shopping...  I usually HATE (yes, hate) shopping in Los Angeles but the Lord provided comfortably nice weather, no paths crossed with blatantly rude people, and much more patience towards my sister and from her as well.  We dropped her car off at the Toyota dealership to get an oil change and I met her "car guy", who just had gotten married a week or so ago and is a Christian.  Watching them converse about her future plans of moving to N.Y. with so much trust, fearlessness, and joy brought an unusually overwhelming feeling of calm over my heart...  I haven't felt that in a long time...  Following my sister into her favorite stores (i.e. Anthropologie, J.Crew), watching her shuffling her way back and forth through the racks...it made me realize how wonderfully lovely she is...while I waiting for her to pay for her things in Barnes & Noble I felt my eyes beginning to burn from the thought of life without her next year...not too long ago I remember feeling that our time of being roommates was coming to an end because I couldn't stand being around her...I know, now, why...my heart, being so full of filth and selfishness, could only be repelled by something as beautiful as the love that God has and continues to build up in her...  Lately, I am full of wonder as to where the Lord will lead me (geographically) once our lease is up (come September)...  San Francisco?    San Diego?    to remain in Los Angeles?    I don't know...as I think about the reality of moving, I am full of hope for change and refreshment...yet so fearful of heartache...  If I move to S.F., I'll rarely see Nathan...or be able to be a part of his life...or have him be a part of mine...maybe I'll change dramatically; maybe he will.  It hurts to think that seeing him will be an occasion instead of a regular pleasure.    If I move to S.D., I'll rarely see my family...I might end up feeling so alone due to how spread out and impersonal the city is...my parents might grow bitter towards me for moving away from them and closer to Nathan...    If I stay in L.A., I might continue to grow hardened towards God and life...and face endless health issues...  What will determine where He will lead me?  My health?  My family?  My own selfish desires?  or my convictions?  I would hope that I would be walking in the Spirit while making such a life-changing decision but I know how much I've been walking in the flesh, which is what brings me to tremble with fear, yet look to Him with faith...

      I messed up my arm just a few days ago and have finally healed enough to type out my thoughts.    This morning I woke up, washed up, gulped down 1/4 of a gallon of water, and sat in front of our faithfully functioning, at times quirky, DELL PC and I clicked on the internet in search for some refreshment.  I came across a sermon by Chris Seland titled, "The Secret of the Contented Life"--Philippians 4:10-13.  It spoke upon the subject of how contentment should not be dependent on your circumstances.  How in every condition, we need to joyfully submit to Him, gladly trust Him, and yield to His sovereignty.  Rather than praying for relief from a certain trial, he encouraged one to ask for contentment in the midst of the hardship.   It really spoke to me...thinking about my seemingly endless streak of physical ailments I began to see how much I had been in sin in my attitude and response to them.  It's so easy to think, "Why me?" and "When will things EVER be good for me?"...that kind of thinking needs to be done away with.  I'm slowly realizing what it means when people say that this life is not our own...it is the Lord's...no matter how unfaithful and foolish I am and have been lately, He remains ever-so-faithful, allowing me to find Him even when I'm not seeking to...

      I set this thing up because my sister just got signed up for it and it seemed like a neat idea...just recording your thoughts for all to see.  In a way, it puts into practice what it means to be truly transparent with one another.  I've decided to use it mainly to record thoughts that lead me to praise God more.    Lately, I've been so full of thought...maybe TOO full of thought...don't know.  Something that's been on my mind all day has been the thought of truly loving others the way that God commands us to.  I was listening to one of Pastor John Kim's sermon's online titled "Are You A Stretcher Bearer?"--Galatians 6:1-2, which presented the way in which we, as believers, need to be restoring one another to a right relationship with God...but how we, on the contrary, tend to judge, be jealous of, gossip and slander against others...and even rejoice in others' failures and sufferings...  I've been slandered against...  I've slandered against others...  Pastor John Kim presented the idea that we tend to go to others in the name of getting some "counsel" on how to approach a fellow brother or sister in sin when our intent is usually far from that--merely an attempt to seem concerned when it is an excuse to gossip about another.    I remember countless times when I feared rebuking a fellow believer either because I felt inside, "Who am I to judge?" since I am so sinful myself or because I didn't feel close enough to them to rebuke them without them thinking I was judging them...either way, the goal is to "win back your brother", not make a spectacle out of their time of suffering and grief.  This sermon really hit home for me because my health, physically and spiritually, has not been in the greatest state for quite some time now and many could assume much (falsely) about me but God's been so gracious to surround me with brothers and sisters that embrace, encourage, and have genuine concern for me...they show me God's unconditional and undiscriminating love in the flesh...I praise God for that...

      Today was extremely tiring. I drank a bit too much green tea last night while I was writing letters and was wide awake until 7:00 a.m.  I wrote three letters in total.  I got into the kitchen and whipped up some turkey meatloaf.  I thought of how I would decorate my tiny room if and when I move to San Francisco.  I do such random things when I'm up and fading in and out of delirium.  Unfortunately, when I started to get tired I was afraid to fall asleep because I knew I had to leave for work in a few hours. I took a little nap but felt totally out of it all day at work--kids tugging at me, yelling out, "Ji Young, Ji Young, Ji Young....", and occasionally showering me with tight hugs around the waist. Simone, a second-grader-to-be, gave me a hug every time I scolded her for having a bad attitude while playing games with other kids. One of the times, she put her head on my stomach,looked up at me, and said, "I want to you to be my mommy. I want to be Korean just like you." She's African-American. I couldn't help but smile. God sends me little reminders throughout the draining day why He has placed me where I am. It's all in a hard day's work. Hehe~  After work, I went straight home, took a quick shower, and instantly knocked out on my bed for a good thirty minutes. Then I had to get up to go see Nathan off at LAX since he was leaving for the Czech Republic missions trip today. Traffic was awful [as it always is in Los Angeles] and nothing good was on any of the radio stations. Blah! To top it all off, I got this HUGE pimple on my upper mouth area that looks like a huge pink mole. Lovely.  I felt so tense and tired...but as I approached the departure area where Nathan was standing and waving his hand in order for me to see him, I felt a calm come over me. I got to take one last look at him, hug him, and send him off with a smile. It was weird because it was the first time we showed physical affection of any kind in front of others. Surprisingly, it felt really natural and comforting. It's a foreign thing for me, being a part of a genuine relationship without the games and drama.  To go on a tangent, seeing all the people getting on and off planes at LAX made me think about all the change that those closest to me are experiencing lately.   Wendy's off to Virginia for medical school.  Jun Phil, my cousin, is off in Korea as we speak.  My sister is almost certain that she will be off to New York within a couple of months.  I am mostly likely moving back home to San Francisco to live with my parents [once again].   It's quite scary, all the change, yet exciting...to see how God will unfold His will for our lives...spread all over the country, yet one through the bond that we have through Jesus Christ...may He do amazing things...

      As I take a look behind me, I see her sleeping peacefully.   My sister's back from her trip to New York.&nbsp; It was all that she dreamed it would be, maybe more.&nbsp;   All I know is that it's so nice have her back home.&nbsp; Knowing that if I wake up in the middle of the night from a bad dream she'll be there in the bed next to me is so amazingly comforting.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It's a weird feeling, thinking that soon we might not be waking up in the same room...   As far as I could remember, we've shared a room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The times&nbsp;I cried hysterically thinking I had lost a school assignment, only to find it in the crevices of my backpack, she was there.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the years of superficial&nbsp;phone conversations I had with various characters for hours on end, she was there.&nbsp;   The panic attacks, hyper spells, dramatic relational episodes, "I am a singer so see me dance and sing" sprees, random acts of annoyance and mental torture&nbsp;(i.e. burping, making animal noises, playing sappy love songs, using a syrupy sweet version of my voice when talking to guys on the phone, not being up to par with her level of personal hygiene)...through it all, she was right there next to me.&nbsp; She didn't have much of a choice...but hey, that's NOT the point!&nbsp; Hehe~   All in all, I love her and am thankful that she had a safe, refreshing, and thoughtful trip...but mostly, that her bed is filled by her warmth again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise the Lord for sisters!

      Met him by His grace.  &nbsp;  The place:&nbsp;According to him,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;at San Diego's LBC's collegian bonfire; According to me, it was at LBC's Family Camp just a month or two after that bonfire.  &nbsp;  The time: The year of 2001. We both concur.  &nbsp;  My first impression: Rough on the outside.&nbsp;Hawaiian to the core. A man of few words. Still very much in love with the world.  &nbsp;  First, brother and sister through&nbsp;the blood of Christ.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then, on-again-off-again acquaintances through both being LBC attendees and UC San Diego collegiates.  &nbsp;  Unexpectedly,&nbsp;sincere friends through God-given opportunities--endless conversations about the similarity of our dissimilarities, intense sessions of coffee and cramming, random and questionable acts [probably a result of the excessive amounts of coffee intake] such as eating steak that someone had not finished while studying at a diner...don't ask!&nbsp;Hehe~  &nbsp;  Gradually, by His grace [after much hairpulling from frustration due to not being able to figure out his feelings], one another's "special" friend.  &nbsp;  Witnessing the&nbsp;man the Lord has allowed for him to grow into over the past 2+ years has been such a rich and gratifying journey.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My thoughts on him as of today: Still a bit rough on the outside. Hawaiian pride still in tact. A man of much more words and&nbsp;layers than initially&nbsp;assumed. Much more in love with&nbsp;His&nbsp;Creator and Savior; less so with the world that promises much but delivers so little...  &nbsp;

      Walking up the oh-too-familiar Van Ness Avenue, checking out the nooks and crannies of Polk Street, and rediscovering the perpetual sea breezes all around me no matter what time of the day it is...that is the sweetness of San Francisco, my hometown. Leaving it after a blissful weekend, for Los Angeles for that matter, was surprisingly much more difficult this time around. My sister was putting the Maroon5 CD on heavy rotation as we drove along the 5, which slowly led us to the infamous 405. The minute we saw the signs for Anaheim-Los Angeles my relaxed face began to fade, transforming into a tense stare, out at the repelling loom of smog ahead of us.  Being in San Francisco allowed me to see all that I had taken for granted while I was there some four to five years ago--the small mom and pop business, bookstores named after cute objects or phrases [such as Acorn Books, Great Expectations Bookstore, and my favorite: A Clean Well-Lighted Place For Books], the Victorian houses--ya know, the ones from Full House, the clean air & water, and even the unbelievably impossible-to-run-up-without-looking-like-an-idiot-that-has-his-feet-stuck-in-tar hills. All of it.  The joy.  The sorrow.  Oh, the memories...

      The first week of July has already flown by. As I reflect back on this year, I can't help but sigh with disbelief as to how my assumptions coming to Los Angeles were rudely shaken. Nothing turned out the way I had planned. I prayed about where the Lord would want me to go after I graduated college for the duration of my last year at UC San Diego. He burdened my heart to pick up my things and leave behind my comfortable life in San Diego, full of sweet times spent with Nathan taking in God's creation--beaches, parks, and such--to enter the smog-filled world of Los Angeles once again. I believed that it was to help out at Hope Bible Church and reconnect with the sisters that I had such sweet fellowship with years before.  On the contrary, many of the faces I had anticipated to be present were long gone or on their way out. Sitting at home each day in an unfamiliar and uninviting city, jobless, left me in a state of depression. It wasn't a hopeless kind of depression but a logical kind. I knew in my heart that the Lord would use this time to build me up and that this too would pass but I couldn't help but feel useless, unmotivated, down on myself, and heavy with sorrow. Three months flew by with a blink of an eye until the Lord provided me with a job. I thought that would be the turning point of my apathy and lifelessness...but I assumed too much. I just became more apathetic with the daily grind of getting up, going to work, coming home, eating dinner, and falling into bed exhausted. Soon, physical trials came my way, one right after another, and I started to feel resentment and bitterness. I don't know who it was towards...maybe it was towards myself and my weak flesh...  Lately, there is much change in the air. My sister is going to visit New York in less than two weeks, which will determine her decision on if it is where she feels the Lord wants her to be. As for me, San Francisco seems to be where the Lord is pushing me towards so far. I don't know for sure. My parents came to visit us this past weekend and it made me think much more urgently about where I could be the most effective for His kingdom. It scares me...all this change...a new place to adjust to [again], a new job to obtain and get used to [yet again], and more aching from being far from the ones I've come to love and adore...but we'll have to see where God would have me be because I know that, ultimately, it is not for me to lead, but to follow...  Whew...almost an year has flown by now and there is so much that has happened. I look back on this year and realize that God had His own plan for my time in Los Angeles. He made me see how utterly sinful I truly am and am capable of being. He opened my eyes to see how I had done things from my own strength for way too long. The harder I tried to fight the temptation to be short with people, get upset about all my physical ailments, and have a total lack of joy in Him the deeper I fell.   I'm not saying that everything has turned around as I've been hoping for, but I see more clearly the nature of who I am in relation to God...which brings me much rest in a time of transition and uncertainty...  "He must increase, but I must decrease." (John 3:30)

      I work at S.T.A.R. Education five days a week.  I used to work solely with the kinders but have recently been promoted to having a rotation of my own, teaching grades K-5.    We went to go watch "Around the World in 80 Days" with the kids as their weekly field trip.  Most of the previews made them giggle and laugh out loud but once the preview for King Arthur came on many of them started covering their eyes and whimpering with fear from all the action, swords being swung, and people getting hurt.  Lupe, one of the soon-to-be first graders, walked up to my isle seat from the row ahead, crying and trembling with fright.  She crawled onto my lap and I held her as close as I could, pressing her right ear against my chest and holding my hand over the left so she wouldn't be able to hear the battle scenes, which seemed to last for much too long.  Even after the preview was over she was breathing hard and holding onto me really tight.  I put my cheek on her little head and gently said, "Shhh..." until I felt her breathing slow down.  She had fallen asleep.  I held her, wanting so much to protect her from all the evils of the world...and it made me think about the day I might have kids of my own.  I usually don't think too much about wanting kids because I feel like a kid myself...but I felt really thoughtful about that because of what happened at the theater.  There's something about a little being fully trusting you and feeling completely safe in your arms that makes you want, that much more, to live up to their expectations...

      Good news: Nathan's back from his missions trip. Bad news: He spranged his ankle, not once, but twice. [Ooh] He got a dent on his head from accidently ramming into a part of a building that was sticking out. [Ouch] To top it off, he sounded like he was coming down with a cold. [Man] It broke my heart to hear that he was not physically in one piece but it was so amazing to hear his voice again...=]  Another voice I hadn't heard in a while was Wendy's. She called me back the other day and it was an amazing time of catching up and sharing our burdens with one another. Life in Virginia has treated her well so far, which is such a relief. She has been through too much already and it would kill me if her life over there started off on the wrong foot.  On a brighter note, she started her first day of medical school the other day. I am so incredibly beaming with pride to see her take one more step towards her dreams. She's had the same dream ever since I first met her back in 6th grade: to be a pediatrician, a caregiver to children. Amazing, that lady. =]  Last night, after I got off the phone with Nathan, another familiar voice decided to bless me with a call: Carol. It was so refreshing talking with her. If there is one thing I can say about this girl, it's that she is real. She never sugar coats anything. She'll tell it to you like it is. That's what I love about her. As far as I could remember, she's been the one to yell, "Ji, SHUT UP!" without offending me, which is weird because it hurts me deeply when anyone else says it. Hehe~ She is the only person that has that ability. Don't ask me how she does it.  Talking with her, I realized that she will definitely be someone I could grow with in San Francisco once I move back. It's odd, because we're both still Ji Young and Carol from Lowell High School, but we're not. Life has stripped away the innocence, or more like ignorance, we once possessed and replaced it with the harsh reality that life is a struggle and, at times, a battlefield. She's faced so much over the past few years, as have I.  Nathan. Wendy. Carol. They all come from such different walks of life, yet they all manage to touch a deep part of me. I pondered for a minute as to why that is. After only a few seconds I figured out why: they are all real. Nathan and his past lifestyle, his dad's battle with liver cancer, his adjustment to the mainland after only knowing Hawaii for most of his life...Wendy and her often-so complex family life, past insecurities and struggles, immense exhaustion from her pursuit for her profession...Carol and her constant lack of rest, heart-wrenching situation with her dad this past year, endless daily responsibilities to tend to...these things make them so real.  They embrace me, "worts and all" [as my sister always says]. They don't look down upon, judge, condemn, or hold things against me. But they do challenge me. They humble me. They point me back to He who loved me first. They love me, even if at times it may come in the form of tough love. That's what I love about them; they love me enough to be keep it real.

      I can't believe it's already the beginning of the second week of August. Only about a month left until I'm on my way back home, good ol' San Francisco. I'm going to give Ryan, my boss, the dreaded "two weeks notice" some time this week or the next. I told most of the first and second graders that I was moving, since they asked me if I was coming back for the school year, and it breaks my heart every single time...to see the shock on their faces, then the disappointment in their eyes...I wish I could just take them with me...  I find myself being much more emotional lately. I think about things at night when my sister's sound asleep and I just tear up. I listen to old songs that I used to put on heavy rotation at some point in time and it makes me hot in the face. I look at my sister and feel so dizzy with wonder as to where He will lead her.  Nathan's been away for about 1 1/2 weeks now [in the Czech Republic for missions]. It's been a good time of reflection and realization. He called me this past Saturday and my heart melted when I heard his voice on the other end. I've never felt so glad to hear his voice. To hear about all the great things that happened at the English Camp there and how much fun he was having working with the children there made me so...happy...  Also, Ellice came back to L.A. for the first time since she moved to N.Y. this past weekend. Sadly, I didn't get to really see her for too long or talk with her extensively, but it was still so overwhelming sweet to see her. It was just nice hugging her, seeing her face-to-face, and feeling her warmth...I really miss her presence at HBC...  Hmm...with only a month or so left in this city, there is so much I want to do: 1. meet up for lunch with a gem of a co-worker from the school year, Dorothy 2. go to Magic Mountain since I've never been 3. check out Universal Studios [City Walk] with Nathan 4. meet for coffee and conversation with Catherine, a lovely friend I met in Seattle through Sharon 5. visit Ju-Im in San Diego 6. see Nathan's new place and hit up some of the places we used to frequent together 7. grab some dinner with Esther Yun, as well as another date with Sakura 8. spend as much down time with my sister, hitting up all the chic areas and happenin' restaurants that will remind me of her, even if I would usually dread it  So much I want to do...so little time...it's a scary, yet exciting, feeling to know that another chapter of my life is coming to a close, as a new one is in the making...what will be of me...only time will tell.

      Unlike my usual self [in L.A., anyway], I decided to venture out after a work day yesterday. Sakura and I decided to head over to the much-talked-about restaurant, Newsroom, in the heart of what comes to mind when one thinks of "Los Angeles."  To be honest, I was really exhausted from a full eight-hour day with the kids. Also, I ended up waiting for an hour outside for Sakura to arrive because of unexpected events such as last minute work-related tasks, traffic, and unfamiliarity with the streets. I was a bit doubtful that it would end up being a sweet time because I was having a bad attitude inside and was not feeling that great physically, but God graciously melted away all of that when I saw Sakura's smile through her windshield as she pulled up.  It was the first time to Newsroom for the both of us. The food was completely fulfilling and YUMMY! I couldn't help lightly "mmm"ing while I was eating and listening to Sakura fill me in on her life. I recommend it to anyone who loves a fresh and flavorful bite for a little less than an arm and a leg. Hehe~  As we finished off our dinner, our conversation lingered. The waiter had to fill our water cups several times. When we first arrived there, it was bustling outside in the patio dining area with numerous diners but soon we realized that it was really quiet and there were only about one or two couples remaining. That was our cue to call it a night. That, and our very full bladders from drinking several cups of water.  We laughed, then laughed some more. We shared our hearts and our burdens.  My sister always says, "Every time I choose love, I never lose." Words to live by.  I chose to put aside my fatigue and desire for solitude after a long day of noise, endless requests, and constant physical contact. I chose to meet up with a dear sister, despite my selfish tendency to keep to myself lately, and I gained so much. I was encouraged, moved, humbled, and built up by the time that the Lord allowed for us to finally have last night. I pray for more opportunities like that.
