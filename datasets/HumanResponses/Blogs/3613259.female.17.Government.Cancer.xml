       Leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again, leaving on a jet plane, oh babe, I hate to go...  Anyways I decided to blog since I'm flying to Reno tomorrow at 1800 so that means I have to be at the airport at 1600... :P I feel like talking in army time because I'm wearing army pants. Well, maybe they're hunting pants because they are BRIGHT FREAKING ORANGE! That's right. I really love them... my buddy Nathan lent them to me this weekend while we were in Camrose for a friend's wedding. Good days! And now I have bright pants!  Tonight I'm going to see Shakespeare in the park with a boy who likes me... I don't know whether or not I like him... I blogged about this already though, so whatev. I dont' feel like repeating myself.  I don't know what it is, but I just LOVE catching up with people. Sometimes I stop talking with them for long periods of time, just so I can randomly catch up with them later. I did quite a bit of catching up in the midst of exams... I dunno. Maybe one day I'll learn to keep in touch with people, so I don't have to go through having to catch up with them and appologizing for not keeping in touch with them. Or... I'll just stay in my natural state and keep on keepin' on.  I watched Moonstruck - part of it yesterday and the rest today. It's not a great film... but you could tell that by looking at the cast. It stars Cher and Nicholas Cage, and don't get me wrong, I'm not slamming Nicholas Cage... I just don't like Cher as an actress. I respect some of her music... like  Gypsies, Tramps, and Theives ... those were good days. But :S ehn. As an actress, she's so-so. But now that I've watched it, I have "That's Amore" stuck in my head...    When the moon hits you eye like a big pizza pie That's amore When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine That's amore Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling And you'll sing "Vita bella" Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay Like a gay tarantella  When the stars make you drool just like a pasta fagiole That's amore When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet You're in love When you walk down in a dream but you know you're not Dreaming signore Scuzza me, but you see, back in old Napoli That's amore Lucky fella  And so I think I have had enough of this for today. I hope you liked my blog, and I'll have a bunch to blog when I get home 'round the 10th! (Just after I turn 17)

       Things are... good... now. It feels weird to say that, but it's true. Exams are over - they all went really well. I had my interview at the Legislature on Tuesday, and I think that went pretty well too, but I won't find out abou tthat until mid- to late-July.  I was telling a friend of the male persuasion about how my life is going good right now, but I included the fact that I'm happy -even without a boyfriend. Then he told me that fact might be different if I wasn't travelling so much this summer...  Well I was in the middle of agreeing with him when what he had said full sunk in. I proceeded to ask how he knew, when he responded that he "was going to ask me [out]" *blushes*  The twist on this one is that I liked this boy a while back, but always figured he never really thought of me as more than a friend. I never really thought about him all the much... In fact, I've been thinking of this one's best friend for a while now. But that one is away til the end of the summer, which would have been great timing on my part... but the best friend is sort of involved-ish with an awful right-wing girl who thinks homeless people should be shot. He only likes her because she reminds him of his ex. Yeah and how bad would it look if I hooked up with the best friend of the one who told me he likes me? And why did he have to tell me now? I'll probably end up thinking about him ALL summer.  From "Love Stinks" as performed by Adam Sandler in  The Wedding Singer  (Written by J. Geils Band) :   You love her  But she loves him  And he loves somebody else  You just can't win  And so it goes  Till the day you die  This thing they call love  It's gonna make you cry  I've had the blues  The reds and the pinks  One thing for sure LOVE STINKS   I think that explains my situation pretty well. Whatev. I dunno. I think the only thing I hate more than guy problems is girl problems. I hate being a girl. It's not fair that I have to spend an hour in the bathroom in the early morning (before the sun is up) once a month just because my goddamn uteris is bleeding. (Sorry if you didn't want to read that, but you'll get over it.) But it's not so bad that I'm getting it now, because it won't be the worst at the wedding, and I won't have it while we're in the States, then I'll have it only once in Japan.  Harry Potter 3 is an alright movie. I had two friends complain to me for about 15 minutes about how much it isn't like the book, how it has a different feel because of the new director, and how all the new actors are annoying. Well, I didn't read the books, or notice that much of a change in the feeling of the movie, and I didn't find any of the actors annoying. So really, it's alright.  I'm super excited for the wedding I'm going to this weekend! I just don't know how to do my hair! :P Oh, woe is me! But it's going to be great fun! :D yay yay yay! The only sad thing is that my best friend isn't coming, because she didn't know the groom when he was inviting people to the wedding, and yeah. So she's sad that everyone's going to be gone this weekend, when she is finally ungrounded from last weekend. She'll get over it though, everyone will be back Sunday.

       So last night all I did was study physics and procrastinate. I'm  really  happy that I spent all of last night on physics, because I think I did pretty well on that exam today, and I didn't really need to study for bio:P I mean... yeah. Whatev.   Things for the next couple of weeks are falling into place, which I am very pleased about. My parents aren't very against any of them, which is also quite pleasing! Yay for things working. :D  My friend Murray is really creepy... and not only to me, but I don't have the heart to tell him that I find it uncomforatble, because he's kind of emotionally unstable... So yeah I really don't know what to do about that. Perhaps I can get some good advice from a wise friend ? I have a couple of wise friends, which is ALWAYS good.  Three exams down, three to go. I wrote two today, and they went well... but I already talked about this so why am I speaking again? Tomorrow I'm going for lunch with my youth leader to talk about how much I hate youth group. It just isn't any good anymore. Blah. I can't explain it... but yeah. No good.

       Yeah, so I have my English Exam. But as anyone who talks to me on MSN knows, I am the self-proclaimed Princess of Procrastination. Yeah, baby! It's amazing the multitude of things I can get done when I want to avoid doing one specific thing. You can tell when it's exam season by the amount of garbage in the can in my room- I've cleaned out a bunch of old crap. Yesterday, I made an award for my maths teacher, because she's just amazing. On the weekend I wrote a letter to my friend who's at camp all summer. I still haven't mailed it yet though:P Oh well, he'll get it all in good time... It's not like he's leaving there any time soon. So what should my next project be? I've got a scrapbook from grade 9 I could actually put some effort into... Or cleaning out old just from the basement. Hey, it's not like you can study for English exams anyways! It's a personal response!   I guess it might be beneficial for me to study for my physics 20 and bio 20 exams - I have both of those tomorrow. Bio's first, at 8:45 AM and physics is at 12:45 PM. But I already know I'm going to fail physics no matter what (if I get 100% on my final, I'll finish physics 20 with a mark of 74.4%, and if I get 50% on the final, I'll finish physics 20 with a mark of 64.4%)... so what's the point? I mean, I'll probably do some reviewing tonight and tomorrow between exams, assuming I don't happen to notice that everything in my room is covered in dust and needs to be cleaned (or any other possible distraction). Perhaps I just need a new study space, one where I cannot be distracted away from studying that I *really* need to be doing. But to be fair (to me) I AM getting quite a bit of stuff done that should happen. It just shouldn't be taking precidence over my studying. Oh well! Thus is the way of my life, and it's too hard to change now. What is a girl to do?

       Well, to be fair, today was only mediocre up until about 6:00 when I went to the Faculty Club with my family for a big banquet for the Japanese visitors. Good food, good friends... yeah I feel really bad for ditching my new buddy Justin, but I have a math test... that I should be studying for right now. Yay! Guess who's not sleeping tonight! I have appointed myself the Princess of Procrastination. I only wish I had gotten Justin's email to keep in touch with him. Oh well, he works for my dad, so it shouldn't be too much trouble to get that later. I really really really should be studying though...

       So the cantata is finally over! Phew! Am I glad or what? Today was a very interesting day... as I finished that damn play once and for all! I raced out of church to get to the airport to meet the flight in from Vancouver, but it was delayed like an hour and a half, so I talked to the nephew of one of the other member's of my dad's Lion's Club. That was good times. Justin's cool. He kept forgetting that I'm sixteen:P (He thought I was eighteen- yay me!) So the Japanese Lion's Club members finally arrived, and we all went to their hotel to drop of their bags and let them freshen up. My was taking me and my brother home to get things ready for our mass barbeque, and then we saw a 3-lane parkinglot named the Whitemud Freeway... :S bah, so my dad drove as far as he could out to the residential edge at the top of Rainbow Valley, so Gavin and I (in my dress clothes) made our way down the muddy hill- I almost got my pants muddy! but I managed to get away with only muddy hands, shoes, and purse. Which is all easily cleanable, especially compared to my dry-clean only pants and hand-wash only shirt. Then I got Gavin to roll up the bottom of my pants so I couldn't get them dirty. After that he decided to run on ahead and help out my mom (because she was surely going mad trying to get things organized by herself). I was hiking up the other side of Rainbow Valley in the shoes for which I was  very  greatful I had already broken in, and did not have heels on them, when I noticed my calve muscles starting to hurt. At that point in time, I decided it would be a good idea to run the rest of the way up. Wrong. I was going up there and it was tough- I was saying to myself through clenched teeth "Japan better be the friggin awesomest time ever" Yeah. I'm not worried that it won't be. Justin and Gavin told me ALL about how awesome it's going to be. Then they got mad that I get to go and they don't. But they've already been! So :P on them!   And I got a little taste of what things will be like while I'm in Japan. Broken bits of English and Japanese in attempts to make conversation, or get ideas across. Yeah so that four weeks I have in Japan will be pretty quiet... It's so frustrating when you can't get across the ideas that you want to! And when I go there I won't have Justin to talk to when I'm sick of speaking broken English. I'm scared! I hope Gavin teaches me lots of Japanese before I go!

      Well... I'm still on the whole procrastinating thing. I spent my day at play rehersal, and then with Alexei downtown. The play we are doing is stupid and pointless. It's "Final Performance" was on the first weekend of May, and when we were finished, everyone was rejoicing in the fact that it was over. Unfortunately, later that week our director called everyone up to inform them another church had asked her to reperform it. She agree - without asking  ONE  member from the cast. Of course, if she had, they would have told her it was a silly idea, as everyone is crazy stressed with exams and whatever else is going on in their lives. So, now we all waste our time at rehersals because no one wants to be there, so nothing productive happens, and well, we're showing it to 300 people tomorrow morning. It's going to be an awful Gong Show, and quite frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!  Hanging with Lex is great. I miss that kid... and I'm probably not going to see him much this summer. So that's why we spent the afternoon together! We went to see Shrek 2 - it's an alright movie, I guess. He'd already seen it, and we both *really* wanted to see The Stepford Wives, but that didn't start until 3:30, and I didn't want to make him late for work.   Today really reminded me of Vancouver - I did spend it downtown, afterall. All the trees are finally green here, and well, as it is in Vancouver - it was rainy all day. I was in V-City last on the Victoria Day Long Weekend, at UBC and it's unbelievably gorgeous there. Like, absolutely breathtaking.  But I'm tired now, so I think I'll go take a nap. Or eat dinner or something. Toodles poodles :)

      Wow! Okay this is crazy mad... I'm all, "Whoa, it's exam time... This means I have to do something new and creative to procrastinate with!" Well, I've got dress rehersals for re-performance of Cantata tomorrow, then the performance on Sunday morning, as well as exams, then Japanese people coming, and about a million other things to do, so why not waste my precious sleep time with something as fun as a blog?  Today I spent most of my classes studying for my Social Part A (essay portion of the final) exam, then wrote it in last block. I had a great lunch with Suz and Phoebs, but I got food on my t/kitty ;) ... That was fun times. Then, afterschool I just wanted to go home and sleep on account of the whole stressing and being tired bit, but I had a coffee date with an old pal from Junior High that I randomly ran into last Saturday at a BBQ. It's good times catching up with old friends...

       I'm leaving for Japan tomorrow morning at 10:00AM. I'll be back in a month. Actually, I've decided that "Home For a Rest" (by Spirit of the West) will be my theme song for this trip.
