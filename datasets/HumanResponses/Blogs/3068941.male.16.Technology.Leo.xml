       Birthdays Suck   So today was my little brothers b-day, and OMFG, he woke every one up at 8:00 and had the whole day planned out in an email, it was REALLY FUCKING BORING, first we played basket ball(I hate sports), Then I had to go weight lifting with my dad, after that we had lucnh and went to his(my littel brothers)base ball game(which, by the way, WAS  FOUR  HOURS LONG) And then..... Never mind, it drives me insane even thinking about it, I mean if I even thought about waking my parents up and forcing them to play baseball for 2 hours they would KILL me, but my little brother is different. Any who my parents and HE are watiching Lion King One and One Half(BTY he is TWELVE, Is t just me or is that just a little old to be jumping up and down when seeing that they have the movie.) Any way I gonna go passout now, Ill be hanging out a Barnes And Nobles tomorrow so i'll blog bout that tomorrow.

       Work Work Work   Wow, yesterday was quite a day I went to my internship/ job shadow and I worked more then EVER we where trying to fix a website that pulled information form a database and showed it as a negative number, and in the end it was because of the order we called the variables we spent THREE HOURS to figure that out, So then we had to leave and I usually hitch a ride with the guy I'm interning under but he forgot that he left his car at his house which is ONE MILE from the Clarke County Tech Services building(which is where I am interning) so we ended up running to his car. It was hilarious there was me(a student with a backpack) chasing him(a teacher with a school milk in his hands). It would have made a great got milk commercial.  OH OH OH  and I finally saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and OMFG is it awesome I LOVED IT and am going to buy the DVD. But now the songs have burrowed even deeper into my head AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. But I will survive(I hope.)   Nothing intresting has happend yet today, wait thats not true, someone at my school was arrested for having a box cutter.(which he was showing off to teachers whose OBLIGATION is to report it. Can you say STUPID) He "resisted arrest" and broke a policemans hand. Thats pretty much all that happend today, at least up to now. Update L8ter

       Blogging   I just recentally looked at a blog and a question came to me, what is blogging really abour is it sharing your feelings to every one is it just stress relief is it a way to tell the world  I AM HERE , or maby another form of art or maby it's a way to tell people that even though they can't see you that you are there. Or maby its just like putting your footprint on the web.  Some people are very careful about what they say on their blog but some are not, and those who are not may hurt some people but help more people in finding what their life is really about and finding out thet the emotions that they experience are not the only ones like them that there are people who like the same things they do that they feel the same way they do.  Well there is my philosophical moment fot the week

       WEEKEND  Yeah so I went to Pittsburgh(is that how you spell it) this weekend. It's a 12 hour drive there and 11 hours back luckily I had my lovely I-Pod to entertain me, Once there I got to fly a Cessna and it was AWESOME I CAN FLY, actually I cant but when I get my license I will. Oh and I got my hair cut this weekend, It looks like a Lamas Ass, actually it's not that bad, But IT MUST BE CHANGED so I shall dye it blue and call it FLUFFY and it shall be my pet.   Also I finally an going to see The Rocky Horror Picture show, whose soundtrack has been stuck in my head for weeks and well not that it's a bad soundtrack cause If it where I wouldn't have it stuck in my head but the fact that I have random urges to sing Sweet Transvestite during school scare me because I can barely resist the urge.

That decision has taken five months to make, arggggggg, I really don't want to go, but It'll be fun(I hope). Oh and today has been one of those rainy days where you feel like all depressed and stuffs, I have been feeling really stressed and pressured this semester, I have 4 classes two of which are online, and the other two are at school, I can come with Lit/Comp but Math, umm no, even though I like math, I suck at it, unless it's something like math that is needed when I am programming a Java program, oh yeah, I am working on learning JDBC(the Java database connectivity language) so that I can, well, so I can know it and say I know it, I am also trying to learn Assembly because it seems like something fun to know. Right now my list of languages to learn is(in no piticular order): Assembly, VB, ASP, SQL, C, C++, and JDBC.  Well thats all till tomorrow.

       Indi update and weekend   So I have 15 pages in my script, and I noticed that I forgot to format it, for those of you who dont know ther is a way that a scipt has to be formatted do that it's easy to read. So  I had to re write the entire script to fit the formatting, it sounds like a bad thing but it turned out to be good, there where some parts that made no sense or that where just completly random, or just sounded just plain STUPID. So I did a lot of that today. This weekend I had to do LOTS of school work, I ha behind 3 weeks in my phsycology calss and I only have 3 days of school left. Do, yeah, that will be taking up alot of my time. I am also trying to find someone who has a good camera and is willing to let my filming team to burrow it. I also have to finish the sctipt in a month so we can cast and shoot it before I go to Germany at the end of July, then there is a website that I have to help make, that will take a wile, but will be worth it($$ need i say more). But the Indo film will be my personal top o' the list project. Thats all.

       Love Sucks   It is a proven fact, damn, I cant belive that I am 15 almost 16 and not ONCE in my life have I been in any relationship of any kind, there have been and still are girls that I really really like but cant ever get up the nerve to ask them out, ofr example there is this one girl that I have the biggest crush on ever, and I keep saying, I'm gonna ask her out one of these days, but I am soooo sooo scared of being turned down, and that if I ask her that she will hate me or just laugh or somthing, and now I am off to germany and I'll probally never get to ask her, but one of these days I will. And one of my personal goals is to ask her out this summer.

       Boring Life   Well I haven't posted in a while (not that it matters). My life has been really boring, just sleeping. Latley it has been acting up:  My cousins from Austria showed up.  I bought an X-Box, which BTY used up every dollar I had(and then some). I quickly remade the money. Fixed/Built a computer for this dude for 115 bucks, and got some money from some other stuff. Bringing the grand total up to around 200. And bla bla bla bla. Ohhhhhhh I saw Chronicles Of Riddick (My friend and I had a Riddick day, Played the game saw pitch black then Chronicles.) Which was an awesome!!! IGNORE THE REVIEWS THEY ARE SOOOO F***ING WRONG!!   Umm, OH YEAH. so that Indi Film I made turend out to be a flip. Special effects and casting and otherstuff. We (Neon Productions)are making a "Mocumentary" about stupid people. The website can be found urlLink  here . This one will actually happen.  thats all for now.  OH one quick note, I leave for Germany on the seventh of August. ^_^ YEAH

And only three weeks left till i am leaving the U, S, OF AAAAAAAAAA. w00t, w00t. I am getting a little nervous, but not a much as I expected, it will all come out at the airport, one of those delayed phsycological thingamabobbers, There was somthing about it in my Phsycology course, but I dod the whole course in two weeks so I'll be damned if I remember all of it. Or even parts of it. I hope I can get a good camera before than, or atleast get my old one fixed. I do know that I will have a computer there of fot those non existant people who actrually READ my blog there will br crazy German thoughts in English. That makes no sense now but it will soon. I want to get me a Belkin I-Pod battery expantion thinga mabobber for the flight so i can listen to my newly aquired Silent Hill CD's. Till l8ter

That will be fun. Oh and the Silent Hill 3 OST is CRAZY GOOD so are the Silent hill 1,2, and 4 OST's. I love Akira Yamaoka and Melissa Williamson. They have been doing the Silent Hill OST's since the begining. At least Akira has Melissa Williamson only started on the Silent Hill 3 OST. She truly rocks in the Silent Hill 4 OST. They are damn good Soundtracks. Very addicting. I just bought them all. Good stuff.   I also have plans to go and buy Splinter Cell 2 today, possibly along with the first one.

       Love vs. Friendship   I just realised today the reason I have never been able to ask a girl out. Because every girl that I would consider asking out is a friend of mine. And to tell you the truth, I rather have a friend for life the a girlfriend for a few months than loose both my heart and a friend. I was really depressed for a few weeks after this girl I really liked was asked out, at first I thought "naw, I would have never had a chance". But then I tought, well se is happy, and to tell you the truth, if you really love someone you have to let go. One day I will ask a girl out. Bue when I do I want it to be the perfect girl. I dont want to get stuck with a preppy, i want to get stuck with someone who I can spend the rest of my life with. Any way if you red this far than sorry for wastign your time. But I would just like to end this by saying that the saying "Nice guys finish last." can't be more true.
