      I think I got the flu.  I'm just kinda weird feeling right now.  Not tired or anything, but I have the whole stomach ache thing going on.  Who really knows though.  I'm thinking it's not a good thing for me to be this sick though.  I didn't eat yesterday.  (haha, y'all are like -GASP-)  I almost hurled at breakfast; eggs are not your friend when sick.  Then I struggled though to the night on just Diet Coke.  But when I saw The RunDown at 7.00 I felt much better and ate a ton of Nibs.  And some of Tiff's popcorn.  And a lot of Rootbeer.  Yea that's a healthy day's worth of food.  Oh, did I mention that I turned down my Dad's pear pie.  That's how shitty I felt.  I'm feeling quite a bit better today though.  I'm still not eating.  Maybe I'm just having one of my unintentional food boycotts.  I do that from time to time.

       'Infatuate' - It doesn't look like a simple word- Not a word that's short, concise-  'Like' -  'Friend' - Their simple- To the point- They have no baggage- Not the way  'Infatuation'  does- Heavy on the palate- You know there's something more- Something lurking beneath the letters-  'Bryce' -  'Infatuation' - Similar, aren't they- In a complexity sense- Neither has a  'best described as....' - Both unknown- Both frustrating as hell-

      This is a good day.   GOB has decided to grace this dreary little town of Victoria with their presence.   I'm so going to see them at Legends, unless my parents decide to be cute and drag me up to Cowichan for the Thanksgiving weekend, making me miss the show.   Would it be childish to give them the silent treatment if they make me miss it?   Are they going to use the Warped Tour against me?   I miss Janine. Come home sis.

      In a technical sense that mean the Day Of Manda, seeing as my Dad's nick name for me is Boo, but anyways.  Hallowe'en here today, as I'm sure all y'all know.  Totally gonig trick-or-treating today with Maimes and Gena. I also have two goals for tonight.  1) Break Justine out of her house (she got grounded for the simple reason that her muther went temperarily insane) so she can some and the shit scared out of her with the three of us, and 2) Make some random little kid cry.  I have decided that I'm going to scare all of the little kids who come to get candy.  (and it's mearly a bonus that that will leave us kids with ample amounts of candy).  Yea,  I also have it under good authority that Shane (Maimes' older brother) and his friend Scott(y) will be spending the night, here with us, at Maimes'.  Off I go now to pick up a movie with the girlies, and because Gena hasta talk to her boy...... Gottta run before violence ensues.  Late,

      Just siting here listening to Good Charlotte's Kylie Minogue Tribute.  I still wet myself everytime I hear it.  Joel in the background "You're an Idiot, You're a jackass, lalalalala, You talk to much"  It's quite possibly the funniest tribute I've ever heard.  For all y'all with the blank expressions, just ask Afra, she knows all about it.   -In other news-  I have it under good authority that our boys from Simple Plan will be in Vancouver this November.  First off AHHHHH OMG!!  IT"S ABOUT TIME!!! BAND-AIDS UNITE!!  And secondly,  Emmy, your leaving Walla Walla for the day and partying Canada Style.  Hard COre, all the way, and yea, Af, Kylie, lets recreate Warped shall we?  We'll have a hoot and a half stalking David and Seb and Pierre.  Their playing with GOB again, so you know it's a good show.  Can't wait.  Off to continue with my 6 hours of homework.  Late,

      Amy's house will never be the same again.  It's now covered by three of the four members of the "itos Family".  (By "itos" I mean Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos and Tostitos.)  (We didn't have Tostios though)  The computer is action packed with web cam footage (over an hours worth too) and some 50 odd digicam pics.  Shane probably got no sleep thanks to me screaming because of the movie (What Lies Beneath-- Things kept popping out of nowhere!!!), and I will never think the same way about a cell phone ever again ("Ahhh, my crotch is is vibrating!!!).  We had good times, scaring people in their cars as we take 'artsy' pictures on Searidge Rd in the middle of the night, and lying down under a tree and getting something wet in my hair!!  (That was just a little bit grosse!)  So there's me, Amy, Tiffany and Lindy crashing here at Maimes'.  Oh, and did i mention Tiffany's cake from hell.  Or, what was supposed to be a cake.  First off she forgot the baking powder so it was only 1/2 inch high, and it was supposed to be an orange cake, but it tasted an aweful lot like walnuts.  They were crunchy and nutty tasting, but TIff assures me that there was only orange peels in it.  I totally thought that it would kill me.  That was truly interesting.  So we went out side at like midnight or so and we're all running around the road taking pictures and whatnot.  (the pics are on my website)  Then we came home and turned on the webcam and were complete dumbasses for an hour or so.  It t'was good fun.  Anyhoo, more later, I gotta run, theres a line up for Amy's computer.  Late

      If you are my friend, I need you to promise me that you will never let me stay with a guy who a) abuses me, b) cheats on me and c) doesn't treat me as good a I deserve.  I will not be some weak woman who is to afraid to leave a man who treats her like shit just because she is afraid to be alone.  I will not stay with a jackass, and if i even concider it, slap me, beat me, anything; just don't let me do that to myself.

      I found this on some random Blog.  Sick and twisted, but absolutly hilarious when you think about it!  Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like?  Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high  heels. I work out every day, I'm toned and perfect. My measurements  are 36-24-36. What do you look like?  Wellhung: I'm 6'3" and about 250 pounds.I wear glasses and I have on  a pair of blue sweat pants I just bought from Walmart.I'm also  wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from  dinner...it smells funny.  Sweetheart: I want you.Would you like to screw me?  Wellhung: OK  Sweetheart: We're in my bedroom.There's soft music playing on the  stereo and candles on my dresser and night table.I'm looking up into  your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and  begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge.  Wellhung: I'm gulping, I'm beginning to sweat.  Sweetheart: I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.  Wellhung: Now I'm unbuttoning your blouse.My hands are trembling.  Sweetheart: I'm moaning softly.  Wellhung: I'm taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.  Sweetheart: I'm throwing my head back in pleasure.The cool silk  slides off my warm skin.I'm rubbing your bulge faster, pulling and  rubbing.  Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally rips a  hole in your blouse.I'm sorry.  Sweetheart: That's OK, it wasn't really too expensive.  Wellhung: I'll pay for it. Sweetheart: Don't worry about it.I'm wearing a lacy black bra.My soft  breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder.  Wellhung: I'm fumbling with the clasp on your bra.I think it's stuck.  Do you have any scissors?  Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly.I'm reaching back  undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my  breasts. My nipples are erect for you.  Wellhung: How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting  the clasp.  Sweetheart: I'm arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your  tongue all over me.  Wellhung: I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know,  breasts. They're neat!  Sweetheart: I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm  nibbling your ear.  Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit and  phlegm.  Sweetheart: What?  Wellhung: I'm so sorry. Really.  Sweetheart: I'm wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the remains of  my blouse.  Wellhung: I'm taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with  a plop.  Sweetheart: OK. I'm pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing your  hard tool.  Wellhung: I'm screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!  Sweetheart: I'm pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties.  Wellhung: I'm pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over,  in and out nibbling on you...umm... wait a minute.  Sweetheart: What's the matter?  Wellhung: I've got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I'm choking.  Sweetheart: Are you OK?  Wellhung: I'm having a coughing fit. I'm turning all red.  Sweetheart: Can I help?  Wellhung: I'm running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I'm fumbling  through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?  Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink.  Wellhung: I'm drinking a cup of water. There, that's better.  Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover.  Wellhung: I'm washing the cup now.  Sweetheart: I'm on the bed arching for you.  Wellhung: I'm drying the cup. Now I'm putting it back in the cabinet.  And now I'm walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it's dark, I'm lost.  Where's the bedroom?  Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.  Wellhung: I found it.  Sweetheart: I'm tuggin' off your pants. I'm moaning. I want you so  badly.  Wellhung: Me too.  Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our naked  bodies pressing each other.  Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.  Sweetheart Why don't you take off your glasses?  Wellhung: OK, but I can't see very well without them. I place the  glasses on the night table.  Sweetheart: I'm bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby!  Wellhung: I have to pee. I'm fumbling my way blindly across the room  and toward the bathroom.  Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover.  Wellhung: I find the bathroom and it's dark. I'm feeling around for  the toilet. I lift the lid.  Sweetheart: I'm waiting eagerly for your return.  Wellhung: I'm done going. I'm feeling around for the flush handle,  but I can't find it. Uh-oh!  Sweetheart: What's the matter now?  Wellhung: I've realized that I've peed into your laundry hamper.  Sorry again. I'm walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my  way.  Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on.  Wellhung: OK, now I'm going to put my...you know ...thing...in  your...you know...woman's thing.  Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it!  Wellhung: I'm touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss  your neck. Umm, I'm having a little trouble here.  Sweetheart: I'm moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can't stand  it another second! Slide in! Screw me now!  Wellhung: I'm flaccid.  Sweetheart: What?  Wellhung: I'm limp. I can't sustain an erection.  Sweetheart: I'm standing up and turning around; an incredulous look  on my face.  Wellhung: I'm shrugging with a sad look on my face, my weiner all  floppy. I'm going to get my glasses and see what's wrong.  Sweetheart: No, never mind. I'm getting dressed. I'm putting on my  underwear. Now I'm putting on my wet nasty blouse.  Wellhung: No wait! Now I'm squinting, trying to find the night table.  I'm feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray,  picture frames and your candles.  Sweetheart: I'm buttoning my blouse. Now I'm putting on my shoes.  Wellhung: I've found my glasses. I'm putting them on. My God! One of  our candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I'm pointing  at it, a shocked look on my face.  Sweetheart: Go to hell. I'm logging off, you loser!  Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!  Sweetheart:

      I've had coffee.  I'm in a better mood than I was an hour ago.  I think it was all the turkey... and the fact that I'm going def.  So, GOB today.  That was madness, and except from the bitch that tried to murder me, it was mad fun.  Theo gave me his pick (Gotta love that Theo.  Little trooper, coming out with larengitus and all) and the bald dude from Jersey mercifully gave me a water bottle.  (I would have done anything me asked me to.  That water totally saved my life)  Kootose to Dasani!  Happy Thanksgiving y'all.  Happy happy turkey day. (A.D.D. moment there.  lmao Oooh, a butterfly!)  Back to the concert.  Props to GOB/Legends for doing the all ager thing.  Fuck anyone who thinks they're to good for the kids.  You don't even know! -shake my fist at the fuckers-  Jeers to Afra's mum for not letting her come.  She should have been there, moshing her wee little heart out!  Cheers to the hottie in the AFI t-shirt.  You can have your way with me in a closet ANYTIME!!  (Gotta love the guys who stalk you with their eyes) (Tom from GOB was a little to pro with the eye stalking.  He wouldn't look away from me!!) (Granted I was directly infront of him....)  I'm off to bed, but will someone (Amy/Leslee) remind me to write about the sugar epidemic.  That was quality humor and the peanuts deserve to hear the story.

      So I'm rocking hard with all the kidlets who came out to see GOB/Jersery/Vasectomy's Child, when I start witnessing concert conduct gone awry.  I' fine with hard moshing, hell, I even promote it, but when you purposly go out to steal things from people BUTTONED pockets and purposly hit/bite/scratch/pinch/grab them, I got problems.  I'm wondering why we like music.  Do we love it because it makes us happy, or it relaxes it, or maybe we just like the sound of it?  Do we like music because we can mosh to it? I think it's a bonus.  Why do we go to concerts?  To mosh and relieve stress and to see.hear our favorite bands in person.  I don't know about you, but I've never attended a concert to be robbed and beaten.  (Yes I know that accidents happen at concerts, but things are getting out of control latley.)  I've always felt safe at shows, until recently that is.  Take the Warped Tour for instance.  I felt safe, 1) becasue I was with friends who watched by back, and 2) the people there were sane.  No one was mugged at the tour, why you ask, because people there were there for the music.  You go to a festival like that with good reason.  I don't think many people spend $50-60 to go and be dicks to people and get yelled at.  WHY ARE PEOPLE SO STUPID???  Love the music.  Respect the music.  Respect the people.  Go to a concert, and please, please, don't be an ass.

         In a world of full of american idols and pop icons it becomes increasingly difficult to be yourself.  Criticized for individuality and praised and accepted for for conformity, being youself becomes less and less of a natural thing.  In a land of corn flakes, you are the lone fruit loop.  Proud, but terrified.  Will you smother in the milk of society or climb the spoon of inner peace and just be the fruit loop that you are?    Dickies, sweatbands, spiked hair and new vans.  Which is you, and which is them.  Are you proud od who you are or do you wish to change?  Change to break free of them, or change to become them.  Change to fit in.    'One of them'.  It's a phrase that is envied and loathed, both.  It's quite funny that we lable ourselves actually.  "I'm not like them, and I never will be!"  By saying that, you just put yourself in a category.  You're not like them, but you are like someone else.  You like all the others who 'Aren't like them.'      Individualism is such bullshit.

      Peace of mind has beem restored to my little world.  I'm such a drama queen, but hey, thats how I was feeling at the time, so.....  Anyhoo, things are mostly back to normal.  I'm good with all my friends now, I'm still a struggling lover, seeing as I have no one to love as of right now, and at this point I could care less if I'm with someone.  I finally know what I'm getting my sister for Christmas (a Far Side calendar amongst some other things) and I got 68% on my Socials exam, and I don't know what I got on my English exam, but on my huge project worth like 15% of my grade, I got a freaking 96%!!  Yep, nearly peed my pants there!  So essentally I've cured myself as always, and I'm in the process of straighting out the lives of several of my friends.  I'm the Guru and everyone knows it.  I think they might be abusing the fact that I'll help just about anyone.  But I don't really care, aslong as they get the help, I'm glad to do it. Let's just let life take a vacation.  Take a break and we can all relax in our Soap Opera free worlds.  Yea, that'd be real nice.

      Allow me to vent: I have one truley good friend who I think I like better than she likes me. I've lost most of my contact with all my old friends for various reasons: Their fault and mine. I'm being shafted straight up the ass (non-sexually) by someone who I used to be inseperable from. I'm evidentally not talking to my best friend for the simple reason that sarcasm is dam near impossible to get across over MSN. I'm a hopless romantic who's to afraid of rejection to do a dam thing about it. I'm about to fail half of my course load. I'm quite sure I just failed my English and Social Studies exams. I have no idea what to get my sister for Christmas. And speaking of my sister: She evidentally doesn't want me as a bride's maid for her wedding. And so much more that I can't even think of right now. Everything is so fucked up right now and I don't know how to fix it. I wish I knew what was bothering my friend.  I wish I could help her.  I wish I knew why she's mad at me. I wish my mum would butt out of my sister's life.  I wish my sister would have told me that she wanted Vanessa as her bride's maid and not me.  I wish I were good at school and that I could do well on my tests instead of bullshitting my way though.   I wish I knew what to do...

      Maimes and me saw Elf with Will Farrel last night.  That was bloody hilarious.  Ahh good times.  Oh and ***MANDA'S RECOMMENDATION OF THE DAY***  Go out and get yourself an Eggnog Latte.  That is the best new drink at Starbucks right now.  (Yea, I've had Starbucks twice in two days, what are yea gunna do.)  So my parents are in Regina right now.  Thus all the money spending.  They figured I'd die without money to spend while they were away, and they're probably right!  Anywhoo, that's my recap of my week.  Mummy and Daddy are home on Monday night.  Or Tomorrow even.... anyhoo, that's the story, tootles kiddies!

      Just got home from a rather fab day.  Shane drove me, Maimes and Scott down to Starbucks and I bought them all a drink.  Yumm.  Oh and tear, they don't make Tazoberry Cream Fraps anymore.  They're only around for the summer.  Yea, so that was fun, except that Shane was to scared to jack the place mat for me!  Yea, then CISV, which was somewhat of a bust.  Should'a spent the night at Amy's.  That's always more fun than my house.  But hey, what are yea gunna do.  Off I go to watch a movie.  Not sure what one though.

      Rememberance Day assembly today seeing as we have the whole 4 day long weekend (whoot!), and it was actually really good.  I was a little choked up when they played that song from Peral Harbor.  Later in Socials though, I was talking to a guy (a hottie that I wish not to vouch the name of) and he was saying that he "Just totally broke down".  That did me in.  I was so close to crying just seeing how brutally honest he was with me.  And he wasn't even embarassed about it all.  I was in total shock.  And oh my, some people are so bloody disrespectful.  The kid who was playing the trumpet that signals the begining of the moment of silence kinda messed up and there were people laughing at him and stuff.  I was quite mad at them.  I mean he did his and that's all that you can really ask a person.  He was just nervous and all.  It's a hard thing getting up infront of all of your peers.  All people ask is for you to shut up and respect fallen soldiers one a year.  15 minutes of silence isn't to hard, now is it?

      Titus... prow!  No, I kid, I kid.  Final Fantasy is quite the addictive game to watch.  I'm not feeling the j pop so much, but, whatever.  I"m back again to how confused I am with... everything lately.  Well, yes, I am.  This whole "boy" thing is just getting on my nerves.  I JUST WANNA KNOW ALREADY!!!  I can't take the suspence.  (Russel Crowe is the man, he's so Gladiator it hurts.) By the by, Claude, you're not allowed to show him this bloggy thing... "How was your, um, hike?" LMAO (sorry, slight A.D.D moment there).  Have I also mentioned that Amy is seriously on crack.  We were awake until atleast 5:07 last night (it was the last time I checked the clock), and she had to be up at 5:30 to do the papers... so needless to say, she is quite delerious right now.  I'm rather scared actually.  -ducks and covers under Shane's blanket- I'm out youngens--

      I'd just like to say that Gucci is so not helping me with this "boy ordeal".  Little miss "maybe it is meant to be", your not helping!! You're supposed to be the one that tells me that I'm not allowed to like him!!  Rar!!!  I'm so confused.  Claude, how about you just tell him.  Get it out in the open.   NEW YEARS RESOLUTION:::: Thou shalt not be wimpish when it cometh to the othereth sexeth.   Claude, you can tell him, and that'll help me complete my resolution.  (It's a baby step!) ..... just make sure I'm not around.... ;) But in all fairness, he said he hated me, and i'm like "i love you".  (now that was a wee bit of an exaggeration... but it got the point across.... oh and thanks for laughing... that made it really subtle).  Anyhoo.... that's my plan for this year... and the standard (that'll never be kept) I want to get the model look (meaning, get hot), get rich, famous and successful.   ...I'm just wrambling now, so I should get to bed.  I don't even know what time it is... although i think Amy's gunna have to go do her paper route soon.... oh, it's 4:03am, yea, I think I should maybe go to bed soon.  I'm just riled up from the Chilli Peppers and Foo Fighters DVDs.  'Night kids.

      It's really Chicks over Dicks... but the imagery is just to much for me (wait for it.... there it is!), so...  I'm taking Gucci's advice and I'm going to just think about things over Christmas break and see where I'm left in the new year.  Me and Claude have an uber-tight friendship and I honestly wouldn't conciously do anything to wreck it, so all decisions here forth will be made with only the utmost thought put into them.  (Did that sound smart? It sounded smart to me, but I very well could have made no sense....)  Anywhoo, I'm going to be rational, which mean doing the hard thing and thinking with my head and not my heart.  Yea, and I'm done....  Oh and WELCOME LESLEE  to the wide world of blogging... if you can remember you website that it!! ;)

      If I "break up" with Amy, can I go out with him?  Not that it would ever come to that... It's just a theory of mine.  I just I wish knew what he thought, then my little mind could rest for a second.  It's just the whole fact of not knowing; it drives me nuts.  But it doesn't matter right.  I guess it'd be a conformation that I didn't stand a chance in the first place.

      More like technology genius, but hey, I'm not keeping score.  So I just figured out how to change those little side link thingys... shut up, it's actually harder than you'd think.  There was understanding and formatting and the need of html knowlege which I lack unbelievably... But I figured it out all on my own, with out once threatening the life of my computer! (Yes, you should be cheering for me right now! -bows- "Thank you, Thank you")  So now you can check up on the comings and goings of my website (which I really should update soon, I've just been really preocupied here), theres a link to my favorite band (actually one of my favorite bands) Mest, and a link to Punk Lyrics.  Good site... full of... lyrics.  Also, I've added one of my numerous email addys up top, so feel free to send me some emails, tell me to shut up or whatever.  I'm out... school tomorrow and I need sleep like you wouldn't believe.

      Seriously now folks... How could you not hit me and tell me I'm dumb?  Or were you all swept up in the love story?  I'm crazy and none of you pointed that out to me.  Thanks kids, your all so helpful, egging me on! :P

      I'm an IDIOT folks.  I like my best friend's older brother.  I'm a dumbass.  Say, on the off chance, that he likes me too, and we decide to go out, what happens when we break up.  How often do people actually part on good terms.  I'd still wanna be friends with her, but anytime I'm at her house, I'd be bound to run into him, right?  So what would I do.  I can't loose a best friend over a boyfriend.  It's not worth it.  And for all those people out there who say that if it is meant to be, it'll happen (-cough-EmmyJustine-cough-), I'm (almost) 16, I'm not looking for the 'one', I just want.... him.... for now at least.  I don't care how long it would last, it's just that when things ended, I wouldn't want the ever weirdness.  I really do like him, but it's not worth the risk.   *NOTE TO FRIENDS* Next time I do something stupid like this, PLEASE TELL ME!!!  This has gone on for how long? 2 months?  And it'll probably continure for a while more concidering that I'm always at their house!  Slap me or something next time.  Maybe, "IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO LIKE YOUR BEST FRIEND'S BROTHER!!!"  Yea, I think that something along those lines might just work.  A little persuasion in the right direction never hurt.   I'm an idiot.   (Claude... He's not worth it... You can now rest easy) (Jackass... Thanks for the advice... I guess it takes my sister to get through to me)

      These are my current problems affecting my usual chipper mood:  1.  A friend is having problems, and I can't do jack to help them. 2.  Another friend is having problems, and once agian, I've been rendered useless. 3.  I'm very confused by the fore mentioned guy. (very confused) 4.  It's a whole nother guy I'm dealing with. 5.  I hate science class.  I'm overly confused by oh, ALL OF IT!!!  1.  Can't help. 2.  Can't help. 3.  To scared to do anything about it. 4.  Not sure I wanna do anything about it. 5.  Gunna fail my test tomorrow. :p  Life is blah.  No one is good right now.  It seems like everyone is confused or frustrated about something.   I'm... upset...

      Naturally I wouldn't care if I had a boyfriend or not, but our society is so based upon finding your true 'one' (or one right now), that I can't help but feel a little out of the loop without someone to call my boyfriend.  I wish I didn't, but as of right now, I really wish I weren't single.  Everything else in my life is fine, except for the whole love factor.

      I think she's lying.  She said that it's cool if I like him.  It's not though.  She doesn't want me to like him at all--  Just go ahead and say it, I won't be offended.

      i was looking back over my old posts, and holy man, i'm such a pessimist.  i should really be more cheery.  i know for a fact that things could be much worse for me than they are.   anyhoo, i like this guy, and tons of people know who he is, but those friends of mine who are hounding me to find out who he is, your terribly dense.  i've talked about him 4 or 5 times on here, and your still not picking up on it.  naturally i would just tell people, but this time.... no.  new years resolution: be happy, don't worry, try to ask him out (if i might be able to summon the courage) and read all of my old rolling stone magazines.  yep, that's the plan.  i love guys, but wow, do i ever hate them right now.  their either mean or confusing.... except for 2 who are just really nice right now..... and now i'm suspicious-- this isn't good.  I need to go get some sleep.   *Side Note:  Gucci, call me soon, okay, we need to have a good old fashion chat.                      Pokanose, you call me too, it's been far too long.

      [unsent letter to no one] you're so close to perfect, it scares me senseless.  your smart, educated and actually instill knowlege in me.  i don't always understand you, but that's what adds to the mystery... the charm.  you can carry on a conversation, and at the same time, be just as a.d.d. as me.  you funny, attractive, smart, sensitive (from what i gather) and not afraid to be afraid.  you're so.... oh i don't even know what you are.  there are so many words i could use to describe you, but none seem right.  none seem to capture what i feel.  confusion comes close, but....

       Music:  Foo Fighters x My Hero  Mood:  Random  I'm sorry to anyone who actually likes it (mum, dad, Shane, Amy...)  but why on earth would you put an egg on toast??  Doesn't it make the toast soggy??  See, that'd be my biggest concern.  Soggy toast.  I just don't understand it.  And what's the deal with sunny side up eggs.  Could they look a little rawer?  Now that is just wrong.  They're all spilly and runny and such, and I swear they seek out other perfectly good food (bacon and hashbrowns) to contaminate with their yellow spillyness.  Dam eggs, they're so corruptive of nice food.    ..... He ate the last Nib, and she only ate the tips of her pizza, and I'm a creep?? Honestly...

       Music:  Fenix Tx X Threesome  Mood:  I    We were acrobats crafting tight-ropes between pianos and sofas  and trampolines from ancient hide-a-beds.    We were storm chasers watching lightning blaze out of heaven huddled under the safety of our blankets.    We were adventurers spending half a night in tree forts before succumbing to “hypothermia”.  We were psychics channeling restless spirits via Ouija boards, promising not to push the pointer on penalty of possession.    We were romantics hopelessly in love with J.T.T. bickering over who he would marry first and who would get the sloppy seconds.  We were philosophers not caring about the real world, just enjoying childhood like retired seniors.  We were the strongest of the strong, bravest of the brave and the most unemployed of them all.

Sunday afternoon was a time for childhood. A day of skipping through mud puddles and picking lilacs for the neighbours.  Sunday afternoons are a fading memory. The simple pleasures of unsweetened Freshie, running wild on playgrounds, and reading books I’d read thousands times before.  Sunday afternoons are for rituals. Traditions to be passed from old to young, like the tomato aspect you are forced to ingest every Christmas.  Sunday afternoons are a day of rest.

A failed attempt at riding a bike  will be nothing more than bruised pride tomorrow.  Telling my sister every detail  will make my ruined jeans worth it.

There was some random conversation about rainbow sherbert (me and Shane in favor, Amy indifferent and Tony completly against it) and tonight we got some, so woot!  I finally get my sherbert.  So Amy's cousin's (Tom's) cousin is here (or she's something like that.... I dunno, family relation of sorts).  Her name is Alison, she's pretty cool.  And Amy, being the genius that she is, told her that I like Shane, and she hasn't eased up since.  It's mental.  Dinner, I'll write more later tonight!!

       Music:  Motion City Soundtrack x My Favorite Accident  Mood:  Alive and Well  So I've decided that it is my duty as a music lover to spread the word of good music.  These are just a few of my new musical obsessions.    Junior Senior:  Quality music here, Beach Boys meets dance pop-punk. Move your Feet rocks.  Divit:  No Regrets, William, Missunderstanding Maybe, all really good songs.  Maimes found them on a random music search, and I gotta say, I like 'em.    Catch 22:   Imagin Sublime and Mest having a love child.  This is what you'd get.    Mest:   Speaking of, these guys are a great punkrock band from Chicago.  I'm a big fan, they're excellent live and on their albums.  You can't go wrong when you're mest.   Fenix Tx:   Not quite as underground, or what ever you might call it, as the others, but not as well known as they should be.  Threesome is a hilarious song, just listen to the words kids.    Story of the Year:   I love these guys!  Their CD is about stuff that everyone goes through or can relate to.  Their not everyones kind of music, but the message is universal.    A.D.D. MOMENT::   Ghandi has A.D.D! Ghandi has A.D.D! You get it from toilet seats, Use protective sheets! (Clone high rocks my socks!!!)

       Music:  Catch 22 x Wine Stained Lips  Mood:  Confused and Such  I hate it how my mum knows what's wrong with me.  I'm in a bad mood and she knows why, but she asks me anyways... makes me tell her why.  And it's not like I can not tell her, because you know that she'll sit there and force it out of you in the end.  She just... prys I guess.  Not in a bad way though.  She prys because she knows that I'll feel better once I tell her, but it's still annoying!!  So, I wanna get my nose pierced.  I don't really know why, but, I do.  It's just that everyone has it pierced these days, and as you all know, I hate following trends.  I don't even know if it would look good.  And I cannot find the Bowling for Soup cover of Baby, One More Time.  I have a Fountains of Wayne cover, but it's just not the same.    I'm so impatient.  I never want to wait for things to happen.  I want instant results.  Is that bad, or am I normal for being like that?  What's worse though, is that I don't usually do anything about it.  I just let things happen, then bitch about it later.  Am I hypocritical or something?  I don't even know.  I'm impatient.  I just want him to say yes, then I can stop wondering if he likes me.  I can stop wondering if I have a flying chance with him.    I'm going to go eat the reminants of my birthday cake.

       Music:  Foo Fighters x Everlong  Mood:  Sleepy but Good  My mum sent this to me, and it made me proud to be Canadian.  It's always good to be reassured that we're not the stupidest country out there.  (Please note where the majority f the questions come from -cough- the States -coughcough-) hese questions about Canada were posted on an International Tourism  Website and obviously the answers came from a fellow Canuck.

       Music:  Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades x Brand New  Mood:  Analysis Mode    She hits the lights. /This doesn't seem quite fair. /Despite everything he learned from his friends, /he doesn't feel so prepared. /She's breathing quiet and smooth. /He's gasping for air. /"This is the first and last time," he says. /She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his. /He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. /He's holding back from telling her /exactly what it really feels like.   That's the lyrics to this song.... Yea, totally didn't get what it was really about until right now.  I was just so intent on listening to the crazy sound I completly overlooked the lyrics (shut up, I know it was wrong... it's like music fan creato to listen to all components of the song, but people slip up once and a while.) Would people actually do that just to finally have sex?  I find that kinda sad (pathetic) and it's sad (sad) because half way he starts to regret it.     It used to be the reason I breathed/ but now it's choking me up.    the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.   Is it like you can't be an adult without first loosing your virginity?  This is so messed up.... (my bad... just stole a line from the song)  Why do people (guys usually, but not always) feel this way.  It's sex, what's the big deal.  If you look at it from a religious point of view, then it's a big deal, but otherwise it's just a thing.  Why do people wait their whole freaking lives for one moment.  Guess what kids, the first time is usually the worst time.  No one knows what they're doing and it's just.... not good... (so I'm told... so I'm told).  I do not understand people.  I don't like any of you... actually there are a couple I like... but besides them you're all nuts.  I don't understand humans at all.  We're so weird and different and nothing is the same about people, yet everything is the same.  It's just plain crazy.  And why is it okay for guys to have random, meaningless sex but it's practically evil for a girl to do it.  I hate double standards.  Will someone please explain this world to me.  I don't get it.  I wish I did... then maybe I could live in it peacefully.  And what's the deal with age.  Age is just a concept... and an overrated one at that.  What does it matter?  Why does it matter....

We'll, it could always be better, but none the less, I'm good.  Coke and cookies.  Not quite the conventional after school snack that it used to be, but what ever.  Would someone please explain the point of Stripperella to me.  Is she not a cartoon, thus making any fantasy you might have about her completly wrong and creepy??  Mmm, Cheezy Domino's Dots, that would be really good right now.  I must say, Shane is improving at this whole drumming thing... he's not half assed anymore.

       Music:  Some random movie  Mood:  Let's just not ask right now   $20 Bill-  A well-known speaker started off  his seminar by holding up a $20.00 bill. In the room of 200, he asked,     "Who would like this $20 bill?"  Hands started going up. He said, "I am going to give this  $20 to one of you but first, let me do this." He proceeded to crumple up the $20 dollar bill. He then asked, "Who still wants  it?"  Still the hands were up in the air. "Well," he replied, "What if I do  this?"  And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind  it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and  dirty. "Now, who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air.  xXdExtEr4mEEhXx (11:05:22 PM): "My friends, we have all learned a  very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still  wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth  $20.  Many times in our lives, we are dropped,  crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are  worthless.  But no matter what has happened or what will happen,  you will never lose your value. Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely  creased, you are still priceless to those who DO LOVE you. The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by WHO WE  ARE. You are special - Don't EVER  forget it."  Thanks to http://lady.blogspot.com/.  This helped my mood a little.  Maimes' likes it too.

I love this movie, and this version is all superiffic with all its deleted scenes and such.  "But Joe, that's a lie.  The money's in Atlantic City.  Really."  "Who knows where thoughts come from, they just appear.  Mmmhmm."  Oh dear, I hate Cory.... she's very annoying.  But Mark... Awww, I love him... along with Berko.  They rock my white socks.  "Joe, I can categorically say that you are not a bigger bananna head."  This movie is freaking hysterical.  My mother is deaf.  I told her 3 times that I was going to Amy's house, yet she still had no idea where I was.  Oh dear.  Last night I told her, this morning I told her as I made my PB&J sandwich and as I got out of the car I told her that I was coming here and that Dad was picking me up.  OI VAY!!!  Ahhh, this is grand.  How I love it all!  Woot.  DAMN THE MAN!  "Mitchel's the man, I"m the idiot and you're the screw up."  "Let's not fight, let's just rip." "Well mines with a.....

       Music:  By the way x RHCP  Mood:  Pissed off/ near tears  So I'm working on growing my hair out a little, just so it's not as short as it is now, and i wanted to get it cut in a way that it would look good growing out, non-mullet essentially.  So I go to the salon, tell the girl exactly what I wanted, (a new style that'll look good growing out) and what does she do?  She hacks 2 or so inches off of the front leaving me with hair so short that I can't even tuck it behind my ears.  It barely reaches my mouth it's so short.  And, did I mention that it looks like shit.  I've never been so upset about a hair cut before.  I honestly hate it.  It looks like a guys hair cut gone awry.  Yea, so not the look I was going for.  I'm gunna go now and try and salvage the remains of my hair.... my sweet, precious hair.... I'm going to cry again....

(AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, oh my, "Shane, whoa-- you laid an egg." huh)  Scott was attemping to steal Amy's 'cola', ever so stealthaly....

"nooooo"  "yesssss")  Tonight was good fun.  Violence towards Amy... Amy's retaliation that lead to the enevatable laying of the egg, the sheer and utter cuteness of Scott and Shane... awww, their so cute (baby voice)  (Amy muttering "Scott's so cute" in the background)  And where the hell was Ed during all of this.... oh yea, and what's up with all the dress shirtedness.  (Scott- "Whadda yea got against dress shirts?" Amanda- "Nothing at all, their hot!"  Amy- "Very formal" Scott- "Mine's got a hole" Amy- "Not so formal" Amanda- "Huh, holes... hot!")  Ahhh, watching the grad DVD again... (Shane- "THAT'S ME!!!  SEE RIGHT THERE!  YEA, THAT'S ME!" Amanda- "Pretty sure that's exactly what you said last time"  Amy- "I think he pointed then too!")  Then of course, there's Kirsten playing with the drumstick... again, abusing Amy.  (-twirl twirl twirl drop- Amy- "Ow"  Kirsten- "OMG, I'm so sorry... I've been twirling it for 1/2 an hour, and I knew I'd eventually hit something")  (Amanda- "oooooh, you're the mop girl!  hehe oh Scotty B"  Kirsten- "Yea, I so just stole a mop from school!")  (Kirsten- "YEA!  It's Scott Bell!"  Amy- "Oh Scott Bell" Shane- "Yea, go Scott Bell!!"  Amanda- "Uhhh, why are we all calling him 'Scott Bell'??"  Kirsten- "Cuz he's Scott Bell"  Amanda- "Oh, well then"  Shane- "And cuz he's cool!"  Amanda- "Oh Scotty Bell".)  (-Amanda being knocked off the couch because Shane's evil and wierd- Amanda- "What was that all about?? That was so uncalled for Shane, oh my!"

       Music:  Everybodies Girl x Dwarves   Mood:  Sleepy :o  Yea, note to everyone.... It has been brought to my attention that I don't take critisism very well.  Ha!  I so already knew that.  I hate "constructive critisism"... especially when it comes from someone who knows less than me!  -starts grinding teeth- Honestly... it just pisses me right off.  Anyhoo... well I'm peeving, I have decided that my most hated movie line of all time is "You had me at Hello."  That little piece of sap comes courtousy of Renee Zellewager in  Jerry Maguier .  I don't know what it is, but I cannot stand that line.  Maybe it's the context of the story, or maybe it's just the movie... (Come on-- "Show me the money??"  wth were they smoking when they came up with that bit of pop culture?)  And me and Amy are watching The 6th Sense on Friday, because in a moment of sheer and utter wisdom, I decided that I haden't been scared in a long time and that it was about time.  I was thinking about what movie scared me the most, and this is what I came up with.  I'm concerned.  I hate the movie.  It scares me so bad, but it's a good movie, sooooo.  And I'm watching it with only Amy... yea, some comfort there with her not being scared of that movie and all.  :p  I'm screwd.

       Music:  Good To Know x Brand New  Mood:  Creative?? I dunno  I'm board, and this is my English homework, so bear with me and read my stupid story.  It's funny... and so possibly true!!  But, you will never know the truth, MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!   The pitch black consumed me as horrific laughter pinned my feet to the floor.  There was no escape.  I was trapped.  ***** 	An enormous sign loomed overhead, beckoning us to enter “The Circus,” just one of the many lands residing in Crazy Mike’s Adventure World.  The thrill of being 11 and at Saskatchewan’s finest miniature amusement park clouded my judgement, and with such distractions, I became reckless.  	My sister and I entered “The Circus” ready to face any ride that Crazy Mike could toss our way.  All day we rode stomach-churning rides, stuffed ourselves to the point that we resembled the blueberry girl in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and embraced the pure joy of having no parental supervision.                With only ½ an hour left until we had to be home, we made a break for the ride with the shortest line.  “The Fun House” stood a menacing 9 stories tall, fully equipped with a gigantic blinking neon clown face.  I guess my excitement couldn’t hide my sheer and utter fear because it was at that moment that my sister remembered that I was terrified of clowns.  She assured me that it was a fun house and that there wouldn’t be any clowns in there.  Trusting that my sister would never lead me astray, I gritted my teeth like I was preparing to crawl into a clown car, and entered “The Fun House”.  Not even 2 feet across the threshold and I was bombarded with clown memorabilia.  Everywhere I looked I saw Pennywise’s cold eyes bearing down at me, and pictures of that damn clown from Poltergeist.  My sister pushed me further into the supposed ‘fun house’.  “Close you’re eyes or something.  The ride starts just up here.”  She ushered me to a man, 60 years my senior, who resembled the cantaloupe that I had once tried to dehydrate as a child.  “Come sit here, Sweetheart, and we’ll strap you in… nice and tight.” He said as he buckled my safety belt, his voice coming out as a matchstick rasp.           The ride started, shooting my sister and I forward into a pitch-black tunnel.  We sped faster and faster, the tunnel still unlit.  The air surged past us, until we slammed to a screeching stop.  I silently thanked the creepy old man for tying us in so tight while my sister howled in the pain of her knees hitting the front of the cart. As we attempted to collect ourselves from the shock of our sudden stop, we came to the conclusion that the ride wasn’t about to start up again.  We felt our way out of the medieval roller coaster cart, fumbling with the safety belts the entire time.  We stumbled around in the dark, hopelessly trying to get our bearings.  We decided that seeing as we were in a building, any direction chosen was bound to lead somewhere.  We headed off, but after walking for a few minutes in the monotonous black, I was startled to realize that my sister was telling me to shut up.   “What?”  I asked her, slightly irritated at her for being so rude.   “Stop breathing like that, you ape.  You sound like a freaking chain smoker.” “What the hell are you talking about?”  I hissed at her, now fully pissed off at her false allegation.  “I’m not breathing like anything…  And you’re the ape.”  “You’re such a little— Oh…” She trailed off, as we both realized that we weren’t as alone as we had thought.  The dark was suddenly filled with malicious, deranged laughter that seemed to echo off every wall.  I felt my sister take off at a nothing less than a sprint, and I logically followed suit.  As we ran for our lives, the lights flickered on.  Terrified and suffering the equivalent of snow blindness, we crashed into the old man standing at the doorway to outside.   “What are you girls doing out of the ride?  What happened?”  We began to relay our terrifying adventure to him.  How the car had stopped, how we had assumed that it was a clown trying to kill us, and finally, the laughter.  His expression grew increasingly more concerned as we listed off the wrong happenings.  Our temporary relief faded when he questioned us about the laughter we had heard.  My sister was trying to explain the horrific sound when the double doors behind the man swung open to reveal a blood stained clown holding a butcher’s knife, laughing the laugh that had nearly given me a heart attack not even 2 minutes earlier.  My sister screamed and I nearly passed out, but the old man just laughed.  I was more shocked at his reaction than at the clown. He winked at me and continued to laugh as I stared at him in horror.  “That’s Chuckles the clown.  Or should I say robot.  He’s a prop for the ride.”

       Music:  Sugar High x Coyote Shivers  Mood:  Bee Bopping if you will  Maimes has tributed her entire MSN profile to  MY  favorite movie,  Empire Records , so I figured that it was only appropriate that I make some sort of tribute to it too.  So, it is a work in progress, but here are the lyrics to the best song ever.  Sugar High.  The only thing is, there are two versions.  A)  Soundtrack version  [persumably the real version] and B)  Movie version  [featuring none other than Renee Zellewager as Gina].  The movie version has been cleaned up a little for artistic purposes.  So, here they are.  Go download it and sing along kids.   Artist:  Coyote Shivers feat Renee Zellewager  Song:  Sugarhigh (Film Version)  they all said life's just a bowl of cherries, but sometimes it seems like anything but think again sometimes reputations outlive their applications sometimes fires don't go out when you're done playing with them I feel so funny deep inside I wanna kiss myself goodbye  sugarhigh.. gotta have it really need it to get by sugarhigh.. wanna feel it can't conceal it sugarhigh  I could go out and not even leave the house a TV set and a bottle of wine's, just fine crashing out on that old pull out couch watching saturday night live I guess that's why when I think about my life I wanna kiss myself goodbye  sugarhigh  gotta have it really need it to get by sugarhigh...  alright, [guitar solo]  I... far and wide I've explored the deepest caverns of my mind to try and find an explanation why I get this funny feeling deep inside when I think about my life I wanna kiss myself goodbye  sugarhigh.. gotta have it really need it to get by sugarhigh.. I wanna feel it can't conceal it makes me high sugarhigh.. need it now I've got to live until I die sugarhigh.. can you feel it, can you feel it sugarhigh _____________________________________________   Artist:  Coyote Shivers   Song:  Sugarhigh (Soundtrack Version)  they all said "she's just another groupie slut" and I said I thought you were anything but  think again, sometimes reputations outlive their applications  and sometimes fires don't go out, when you're done playing with them I feel so funny deep inside  when you kiss me goodbye   sugarhigh.....sugarhigh  we could go out and not even leave the house  a t.v. set and a bottle of wine is just fine  making out on that old pull out couch  watching saturday night live, I guess that's why  I feel so funny deep inside  when I lick between your thighs   sugarhigh.....sugarhigh  alright... (laughing)  and I have searched both far and wide  and I've explored the deepest caverns of my mind  to try and find an explanation why  I get this funny feeling deep inside  when you kiss me goodbye  and when I lick between your thighs   sugarhigh.....sugarhigh.....sugarhigh.....sugarhigh....shhhhhhhhhhhhhh    So, vote for yourself on which you like best.  I gotta say, I think the duet really adds something to it, but seriously, it's Francis Coyote Shivers, how can you go wrong??

       Music:  My Way x Sid Vicious  Mood:  Pissed at my dad  Today, February 2nd, 2004, is the 25 year anniversary of the death of Sex Pistols bass player, Mr. Sid Vicious.    On October 12, 1978, in room 100 of New York's Chelsea Hotel, Sid Vicious allegedly murdered his girlfriend of 21-months.  It is reported that Nancy Sprugen, a Sex Pistols groupie and bed mate of Sid, was stabbed to death by Sid with a hunting knife.  4-months later, torchured by the agony of living without his true love, Sid Vicious ended his life at the age of 21.  John Simon Ritchie (or Sly as he was called before) was only 19 when the Sex Pistols reached number one on the UK charts with 'God Save the Queen'.  No one could imagine that he would only live another 2 years in the spotlight.  Click here to read a great  urlLink BIO  on Sid.                                                         R.I.P.

       Music:   Mood:   This is not about my current situation, really.  This is just a poem that came to me in the middle of Chem today.      Show him up. Find a hot young buck. Rub it in his face. You're to good for him. You were going to leave him anyways, he just beat you to the punch. Who cares if she's witty. You have a sarcastic charm to you. No, you're down right hysterical. Far funnier than she is. Yes, far funnier. And, not to mention, your ass if a good 2 inches higher than her's. Granted her teeth are whiter, you atleast don't have a nasal drone to your voice. ... Except that what you here in your head is different from what other people hear. No, you have a lovely voice. Suits you perfectly. ...Not nasal at all. And you can write poetry. I bet she couldn't write poetry to save her life. Now, now, let's not judge the book by the cover, everyone has the potential to write amazing poetry, they just need the proper muse. But back to the subject on hand. You have much better taste in music. Although, you do listen to many of the same bands... You can make some mighty fine cuisine, but in all fairness, you've never tasted her cooking. ...And you can't dance to save your life, let alone sing...  But on the upside, you do have this hot date. Even though his teeth are a little crooked, and he is wearing an absurd amount of calogne. Just take him for a walk outside. ...Air him out a little. And I'm sure you can find some way to keep his mouth covered. ...But if you're making out with Hunky over here, how can you keep an eye on your Ex? You must make sure his hands are at an appropriate hight when he's dancing with Sluty McSlutson. ...So when you're trying to cover up Stinky's bad teeth, Mr. I-Think-We-Should-See-Other-People and Miss White Trash Van Isle will be doing Gawd knows what on the dance floor. That's it.  I'm staying home. I need a pint of icecream to drown my sorrows. ...But, my ass is still nicer.

       Music:  Love Song x The Cure x 311 (I'm doing a comparison... They're identical!!)  Mood:  ...I have huge thighs...  I decided to whip this one out of the vault.  I felt it was about time it was read.  I don't know why, but....     I can't write love poems.  The love, the hate, the joy, the pain, I just can't seem to put them into words.  Give me eight words and I'll write you a masterpiece, Recall a childhood memory and I'll tell you the most poetic of stories, But ask me of my first love and you'll probably end up reading a story about apple sauce or a sassy shade of pink nailpolish.  I want to tell you how happy he makes me, how absurdly sweet he is, and how when he fights his cuteness he only becomes more so.  I wish I could write down my pain and frustration, Turn my tears into ink and write an epic poem for the ages.  I wish I could write you a poem on how I care about him so much it's stupid, but unfortunatly, I can't write love poems.

       Music:  The Haunting (movie a la televison)  Mood:  Un classifiable  First off, yay for Justine becoming a Bloggette!  Woot, fun stuff eh.  And yes indeed, I was the first person mentioned in her's!  Yay, Manda is special!  And secondly (or is it thirdly... I don't know anymore), Gucci, can I have your children?  You are my hero and I love you so much!  -hug-  It's so odd to have you giving me advice because I had a breakdown.  It's usually the other way around.  You have severally missed your calling in life if you don't become a insparational speaker.  Manda's self confidence-- up 100%.  No joke.   You want proof that Justine Prevost is the single coolest person in the entire FREAKING WORLD??  Here it is:     if its ment to be it will happen. and if he cant realize that every moment of your life your becoming more and more amazing, then he is the biggest wanker i have ever met. your smart, witty, lol your taste im music is sooo way beyond your years (in a good wise way lol) your pretty, hahah the fing funniest person to walk the face of the earth, and quiet possibly my drama queen kindred spirit. he is an idiot for not falling head over feet for you the moment he saw you.   Gucc, I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU!!! Holy crap, omg, what on earth would I do without you??  Oh, perrish the thought.    So, the point of this post is just to thank my very good friend Justine.  She always seems to know what to say and like I said before, she makes any shitty situation feel better.    Congratulations on your engagement to Ryan!  (So it's a little premature, it's an inevatable fact right?)  And woot to your Grandmother with her wise words of advise,  "A woman with out a man is like a fish with out a bicycle."   And on the topic of engagement, Ryan's home from Cuba!! Eeeeeee!  Happy happy everyone.  He have taken pictures up the wazzoo, or I'm going to kick him in the wazzoo.  (he promised me that he would take a bunch of pictures of Havana for me... come through dammit!)  So, The Haunting eh?  Good movie... well, good... interesting movie.  It's a hosh posh of like 5 other movies.  Whoa Nelly! Possesed girl at 8 O'Clock.  (The TV's at 8 O'Clock to me, thus the army position reference).  She's going a little batty if you ask my opinion which you didn't.  None the less, this movie just got a very interesting plot twist.  Interesting....  So I'm off, school in the morning dontchaknow.  Byebye, sleep tight, I love you all! -hug x 87-        ...you dont need him, hes an added accesory, and althought the accesory can sometimes compeate the out fit, your still stunning with out it. i hope i have helped...    Seriously, I'm going to cry.

       Music:  Drive x Incubus  Mood:  ||Reading between the lines||  Is it possible that he actually knows everything... that I like him and that it's been difficult for me since he got a girlfriend.  Is it possible that he's been acting differently to try and help me?  Or am I just grasping at loose strings.  I want so much to have something with him, but at the same time I want to run far, far away, really, really damn fast.   Amanda, welcome to your first love-hate relationship.

       Music:  The Still in Love Song x The Stills  Mood:  Contemplative  A lot of people have been asking me for updates lately.  There's always the general inquiry of my day to day health, or my mood of the moment, but the knowledge that they really seek is that of my love life.  So sit down, shut up and strap in for the story.   I like this guy, but sadly, he got a girlfriend.  I don't really know how he felt about me pre-girlfriend, and I definitely have no idea how he feels about me now.  I guess what we had before could have been constituted as a mutual like (of the friend sort) of each other, and we got along really well.  We had things in common, mutual interests, and "bonded" over them.  However, things have changed.  I remember saying to Amy that I wish that he acted like an ogar to me so I would stop liking him, but sadly, that's just not his style.  He's one of those genuinely nice guys that you just can't hate.  (One of the main reasons for me liking him, which ironically makes me hate him).  Anyways, now that I see him less, (until a couple of days ago it had been nearly 2 weeks since I had seen him), I've been feeling like I like him less, like him getting over him, but then I see him and all those stupid feelings come rushing back.  The thing is, just after he started going out with her, he was still himself, friendly and just... him.  Now, he's not so "him".  I don't know if he knows I want him to act like an "Ogar" or if he's doing this on his own accord... or maybe he wasn't acting differently at all... it might have been a bad day or he was tired, or something like that that would ulter his mood.   The thing is... Despite all my complaining and feelings of heartbreak, I don't want him to change, I don't want anything to change.  Girlfriend or no girlfriend I still liked what we had... whatever the hell it was.  It was nice, and friendly, and... It just made things better.  So many times I was in a shitty mood before seeing him, but after talking to him everything seem better.  I hate that I want him, and even more so, I hate that I like his girlfriend.  Despite the popular belief on what I "should" feel towards her, she's so nice and funny, I just can't hate her.   It kills me, they're great together, (at least from what I see of them) and they make each other happy.  They almost seem more like best friends then bf/gf, but I guess that's what works for them.   Why do I have to like him.  It's just... I just...  It doesn't seem fair.  Why do I never win the guy in the end.  I'm always the one on the side congratulating the winner on a job well done.  What am I supposed to do?  Fight for a guy who doesn't want me?  Yea, that seems like a productive use of my time.   Is my perception of him changing, or is he changing.   Is he changing on his own, or is she changing him? Does he even have any room in his life left for me?

       Music:  Go ahead, take a wild guess  Mood:  I have the mentality of a 3 year old right now (or that of Justine and Amy)  Lumiere: Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride  and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a  chair as the dining room proudly presents -  your dinner!  Be our guest! Be our guest! Put our service to the test Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie And we'll provide the rest Soup du jour Hot hors d'oeuvres Why, we only live to serve Try the grey stuff Chip: It's delicious Lumiere: Don't believe me? Ask the dishes They can sing, they can dance After all, Miss, this is France And a dinner here is never second best Go on, unfold your menu Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest Oui, our guest Be our guest! Lumiere and Chorus: Beef ragout Cheese souffle Pie and pudding "en flambe" Lumiere: We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret! You're alone And you're scared But the banquet's all prepared No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware's entertaining We tell jokes! I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks Chorus: And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be out guest Lumiere: If you're stressed It's fine dining we suggest Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest! Lumiere: Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving He's not whole without a soul to wait upon Ah, those good old days when we were useful... Suddenly those good old days are gone Ten years we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills! Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy You walked in and oops-a-daisy! Mrs Potts: It's a guest! It's a guest! Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed! Wine's been poured and thank the Lord I've had the napkins freshly pressed With dessert, she'll want tea And my dear that's fine with me While the cups do their soft-shoein' I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing I'll get warm, piping hot Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot? Clean it up! We want the company impressed Chorus: We've got a lot to do! Mrs Potts: Is it one lump or two? For you, our guest! Chorus: She's our guest! Mrs Potts: She's our guest! Chorus: She's our guest! Chorus: Be our guest! Be our guest! Our command is your request It's been years since we've had anybody here And we're obsessed With your meal, with your ease Yes, indeed, we aim to please While the candlelight's still glowing Let us help you, We'll keep going Course by course, one by one 'Til you shout, "Enough! I'm done!" Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest Tonight you'll prop your feet up But for now, let's eat up Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest! Please, be our guest!  *I'd just like to take the time to thank Leslee for getting this song suck in my head.  I've been humming it all day deary.  Thank you for that gift.  My friends think I'm on crack!  You're a doll, really.

       Music:  Megalomaniac x Incubus  Mood:  tierd of it all  It's been a while kids (well, a week, but whatever).  I've been doing lots of thinking lately, and I hate the answers that I've come up with.   If I were to go out with him, it would evidentally ruin my friendship with Amy.  (Remember that this is all hypathetical and stuff cause he has a girlfriend and he's not interested in me.)  It would be fine for me, and fine for him, but Amy would be uncomfortable with it and she'd want to leave the room and not be around us... me.  I would be the unintentional, teenage equivalent of a home wrecker.  I don't know if it would be resentment that she felt, but it would be something that would probably kill whatever she has with him, and definatly kill our friendship.  Now I honestly thought that it would work, and that not to much would change, but she thinks that everything would be different and uncomfortable.  I would never intentionally let that happen, but supposidly it would.  Why can't things work out how I want.  Just for once, I would have what I want, and everyone else would be happy.  Sadly, instead, everyone else is happy, and I'm just along for the ride.  I guess theres no use complaining about it.  No use worrying about something that will never happen.  I just wish that he wern't going out with her.  It would be like there was a shred of hope, even though there is none.  Why do I bother?  Nothing can happen.  Everything would seem better, but in reality, everything would be tearing at the seams.

       Music:  kobrakai x lostprophets  Mood:  Shitty  Why is it that the second you like a guy you have to check with every friend and their dog to make sure that they don't also like him.  You must make sure that before you take any steps towards asking a guy out that you concider the rule "Chicks before Dicks".  Now in typical Amanda fashion, I must once again question this rule.  Do I check with just my closest friends, or all of them.  Do I have to check with my "in class" friends as well as my good aquatences?  Where does it end?  When does it finally become okay to inadvertantly hurt someones feelings?  Why isn't a fend for yourself kinda thing?  And why does this rule apply at all?  If your friend had a chance with this guy in the first place, wouldn't he have asked her out already, or shouldn't she have asked him?  Why does this stupid circle continue to go around!    Should I tell him how I feel, or should I try and concider everyones feelings?  Can I just... think about myself first for once...  A wise man once said, "It is easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission."

       Music:  The News  Mood:  Perplexed  If all is fair in love, that means that you can do anything you want to get the one you love, but if this is true how did the saying 'chicks before dicks' come to be?  Does the male species also stay true to the creato of friends first?  Is it selfish to think about yourself first, even if it is the first time in a long time?   Alright, I guess what I'm getting at is that I like this guy, a lot, but there is also a very good possibility that my friend also likes him... Well, she more has a crush on him, but none the less.  Should I be concidering her feelings over my own?   I feel like everytime I get something good in my life I have to give it up for one friend or another.  Why do I do this to myself?  Am I incapable of looking out for my own best interests?  Why do I care about other people more than I care about myself? I really like this guy and I would love to go out with him, but I can't.  I can't because I'm to scared to hurt my friend's feelings.  I'm to scared to even tell her that I like him... That's not going behind her back is it?  I haven't acted on my feelings, thus no harm done, right?  Please help me... I just don't know what to do.

       Music:  just my thoughts  Mood:  .....  What if what you thought was unattainable suddenly became attainable?  Whether it was something or someone, would you hold onto it for dear life, or would you loose interest now that the challange is no longer there?  Would you ever realize how important it truly was to you or would you loose it's importance in the glory of finally getting what you wanted.?  Would you ever be able to view it the same way again?  But despite all that... Is the only way to learn something or someone's true value to you, to loose it?  It's the whole bird scenario.  If you love it, let it go -- If it comes back, it's meant to be.  Do you really need to let it go though?  Why can't you just realize how precious it is before you loose it.  I know from experience that you really do learn someone's true value once they are lost to you, but why couldn't I have realized that earlier when I could have actually done something about it.      -areyoulistening?-we'reontheair-

I DON'T KNOW!!  i have no fucking idea why we talk alone and i like him, but we get around other people and there's this fucking invisable wall between us.  AHHHHHH!  i think i'm going nuts.  HAHAHAHAHAHA lmao!  i'm listening to lostprophets make a move! OMG, and it's on shuffle, i had no control over it.  hahaha, way to much fruitopia, i've gone delusional.   [ people are trying to help me with this issue of mine, but i keep getting this feeling that i should deal with it on my own.  the thing is, i don't think i'll "make a move" on my own.  don't mine me being terrified of having my heart broken again... i'm not even joking when i say "my little heart can't take it".  oi with the poodles already.

Karma! Thanks for being uber good friends and telling me when i become the queen of all things drama.  i know that i have a flair for the dramatics, but sometimes i just need to mellow out!  I think everything "boy" related issue is somewhat sorted out now, so the stage queen has temporarily left the blog.   So I was home sick from school today old to learn that I missed the greatly anticipated milk challenge.  Matt came out on top to the suprise of all, with Adam close behind and Alex/Nick crapping out after half a jug.  From what I hear tho, if Alex had continued after the initial hurl he totally would have kicked ass.  Then there's Nick with his homo milk.  Smart move Nick, cause homo won't end in your untimely demise.  Sounds like good times were had by all tho.  We can all just hope for a rematch at a later date.

       Music:  Dumb x Nirvana  Mood:  Tired and Sick  I don't mean to do it, but sometimes I can't help but get my hopes up.  When I take the time to think about how he acts around me, I can't help but think that he kinda likes me.  The thing is that he hasn't made a move.  Maybe I'm misinterpreting his signals.  Maybe I have no idea how a guy who likes me should act.  Maybe I just have no idea how to approach the situation.  I honestly feel like I'm not meant to find love, to find happiness.  Why can't I find someone who cares about me, who I also care about.  It seems like the ones who I long for are just out of reach.  Everytime I like a guy, I'll come so close, then they are ripped away from me.  This time he hasn't be taken away from me yet, but I can't help but think that it's soon to happen.   I may be confused because of him.  Around random people and my friends he's cute, friendly and he even flirts with me, but when his friends are around, he barely even talks to me. In class he's always looking over at me, but when he sees me at lunch be hardly even realizes I'm there.  Is he being an asshole, is he shy, does he like me at all?  I don't know what to make of this.  I wish he weren't worth my time, but I know that if something did happen, it would be very worth my time.

       Music:  Little Girls Pointing and Laughing x Alexisonfire  Mood:  Confused... with very cold hands  Everyday he acts differently.  Today for instance, he ignored me early in the day, but by class he was doing his usual look over at me (kinda to see if I'm watching him, i think) and yea.  Then in the hall after school he winked at me... or gave me a cute/funny expression like he does sometimes, but really, what the hell.  Hey, can we send some more mixed signals please?  I like him and supposidly if he hasn't realized my amazingness, he's not worth my time.  I want him to be worth my time.  I really do.  But maybe he doesn't know that I think HE'S amazing.  misscommunication strikes again.

       Music:  piano man x billy joel  Lyrics: It's nine o'clock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin   He says, "Son can you play me a memory I'm not really sure how it goes But it's sad and it's sweet And I knew it complete When I wore a younger man's clothes"   Sing us a song you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well we're all in the mood for a melody  And you've got us feeling alright   [i've just realized who insane it is for me to want a boyfriend.  if there is any guy that i like enough to go out with, i must like them enough to want to protect them from my family.  my family is great, until they're not.  the fighting and evil gossip... who on earth could i subject someone that i like to such a thing.  i've stuck my friends in this demented little world, and i think that's quite enough.  there aren't many people that i can think of that would put up with the shit that my family dishes out.  i couldn't put another person through that.  the only reason that i make it is because i've been raised in this chaos.  my family is so fake.  everyone acts like they like one another, but in reality they all talk behind each other's backs.  yes, my family is a lot of backstabbers who ignore good advise even when it comes up and smacks em in the face.

       Music:  punk rock 101 x bowling for soup  Lyrics:  She bought him a skateboard, a rail slide, his knee tore He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop She left him for staring At girls and not caring When she cried cause she thought Bon Jovi brokeup  [on monday i got a fortune cookie that told me "a man with brown eyes will have a suprise for you".  tonight i met my brown eyed man, and tonight i was given my suprise.  (for all y'all who are holding your breath to see who i slept with, you'll be sorely dissapointed)  i went to my aunt and uncle's for a barbeque and my cousin's boyfriend had his friend over.  he was just this insanely nice guy who was also freaky bright (litterally and figurativly)  he was wearing a netherland's soccer jersey (neon orange) and he knew something about nearly everything.  he was my suprise.  i learned so much tonight.  oh, and he had 3 wicked leg tattoos.  he had a skeleton on one calf and a viking on the other with a little thumbs up hand on this shin.  i was in a neon orange heaven.  and freaking portugal won tonight!  which is really funny because i was watching it with ryan and corey who were both for the netherlands.  muahahahaha.  it was hilarious.  i'd cheer, they'd cry.  they'd cheer, i'd mope.  good times.  then there's my cousin dea who's like "so who wants another beer??"  gawd good times.  and we finally got our cd player put in the car which my muther promptly buggered up, but manda to the rescue.  i fixed it no prob.  i fixed it WITHOUT the mannual whereas my muther wrecked it WITH the mannual!  it's insanity.

       Music:  movement x s.t.u.n.  Lyrics:  Look what we’re doing to the atmosphere No wonder the kids drug themselves to get out of here Perpetual motion Is killing our emotion So the rich can make a dollar Make another dollar  [yay, tomorrow i'm off for yet another glorious family trip to saskatchewan/alberta.  please someone tell me how i am going to survive this.  how on earth am i supposed to put up with incessent bitching and complaining for 2 1/2 weeks?  they don't take directions or advise ever. my mother is the most anal person i've ever encountered.  her mind has fucking carpol tunnel syndrome.  i'm always told that "I am the parent and when you're 47 you can do what ever you want."  all i want to do is flip out and shout back "i'm not a retard... i'm more than aware that you're the parent and that when i'm 47 i can do what ever the hell i want.  i also know that you've finally gone insane in that you think you still have any idea what you're doing."  gawd i wish i were exagerating.  this woman does not know how to let go of a grudge, and you know when you're in a bad mood and you just want to stay in a bad mood?  she just wont let you be.  she makes it worse.  she over analyzes everything until you loose it and want to kill her, even when she wasn't the original problem.  she just doesn't get it when i ask her, ASK her, to leave me alone.  she pushes it to the point that i get angery then she blames all of our fights on me.  it's so frustrating, but do you think that she sticks around to listen to my opinion on our fights?  no.  she whines about her opinion and bolts before i can talk.  and should i ever feel like talking to her, she's 'not in the mood'.  it's not sex mum, it's just a conversation.  i swear, if she didn't have her nightly bitch routine she'd happily be in bed at 4:30pm.  but no, she must stay awake to break my soul a little more.  she honestly acts like everything closes down at 4:30.  at 20 after 4 the otherday i asked if we could stop somewhere and pick up somne blank cds, but no, it was to late.  we were driving past a future shop and everything.  and I was driving.  i honestly can't take it anymore.  i just... need to get away...  [sorry about the bitching and complaining.... i don't blame y'all if you stopped reading forever ago.

       Music:  hotel california x the eagles  Lyrics:  her mind is tiffany twisted, she got the mercedes bends, she get a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends, how they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat, some dance to remember, some dance to forget, so i called up the captain, 'please bring me my wine', he said 'we haven't had that spirit here since 1969', and still those voices are calling from far away, they wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say-- Welcome to the Hotel California.  [as most of you are awear, i happen to be a big fan of 6 Feet Under (the show of course) and as y'all know, it's about these brothers inheritting a mourge and all the shits and giggles they endure along the way.  this show has got me thinking, and i've been thinking, what the hell is the big deal about what coffin you have?  can someone explain to me what need for comfort a CORPSE has?  and what is the point of the little lacey pillows that prop them up like their a puppet or something?  i mean, shitty that they died and all, but is it going to make anyone feel better if their in a nice box vs a crappy clap-board box?  who suffers if i get burried in a plywood crate?  my corpse that's going to get eaten by bugs one way or another.  oh, and please explain embalming to me.  i don't see what the point is.  are they not going into the ground or being burnt?  aren't we organic, thus we decompose and actually help the earth... what the hell has embalming fluid ever done for the earth?  you can't actually tell me that putting that crap and overly varnished wood into the ground is good for anything.  woot for mummification... that atleast has some kind of history to it.  caskets are simply another way to flaunt wealth.  "well i could afford a dark mahogany 10 footer for my husband.  it's trimmed with blue lace and it has a foot rest for him!"  "my husbands in a cardboard box because he thought that spending $9,000 on a box that no one will ever see again was a complete and total waste of money."  coutose to mr. cardboard.  he's got his priorities in order.  next months morgage, THEN casket with foot rest and cup holder.    [i was getting a little riled up there.  but give me credit, leslee and shannon never talk about coffins and dead people.  lmao, it's late, and this is what happens!  --relax said the nightman, we are programmed to recieve, you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.--

ZERO!  i was dead in the water.  stupid people wiht their stupid tests... why?  that's all i want to know.  why is it only 2 hours?  does everyone and their dog not already know that i take for fucking ever to write math tests?  gawd.  i'm so pissed off, this is just not cool at all.  [on the upside tho, me and my dad are going to see harry potter in... 2 minutes... maybe i should go get ready.... oh and i added a comment thingy, so go wild kids! chao

       Music:  eric clapton x cocaine  Mood:  rockin the cazzba  as i stood in the shower this morning (not just stood in the tub, but actually took a shower with water and all), i got to thinking about how good Almost Famous was.  (i saw it last night for the first time.)  i couldn't even get over how good of a movie it was.  then i was thinking about other movies i've seen on tv lately.  Rock Star, Crybaby... all excellent movies.  so this is what i did.  i got out of the shower, threw on a towel and came up with this list.  it's a work in progress, so have mercy, but these are the best movies i could think of this morning.  all these movies ARE classics or sure as hell WILL BE classics.  go and watch them all.  it'll enrich your life in some way or another.   TOP 20 MOVIES  3 Men and a Baby Almost Famous* Chicago* Clambake Dazed and Confused Edward Scissorhands Empire Records Ferris Bueller's Day Off    Finding Nemo* Harry Potter 1-3* The Hole* Lord of the Rings 1-3* Powder Pretty In Pink Rock Star* Shrek 1+2* Sid and Nancy Stand By Me Sweet Sixteen Weekend at Bernie's  they are in alphabetical order mainly because i couldn't choose a number one.  as will you notice most of them are pre 1995.  movies post 1995 are all crap.  honestly, good movies went out the window with the millennium.  sure, they're okay to watch once or twice, but can you think of a single new movie that could be regarded as a classic.  nope?  yea, that's what i thought.  some of those are just good movies that might need to be replaced.  i'll think about it a little more, but for the time being, these are wicked enough. (* note that they are post 1995)

       Music:  another innocent girl x alkaline trio  Mood:  uber confusion  [Leslee, you're my hero, your blog is all mello and "...and that's what happened today :)"  it's all friendly... then there's mine.  "my soul has just been crushed-- my life is over!"  i'm not melodramatic in the least! lol.  we're a good combo-- balanced... a blogger team if you will.    [But back to the actual purpose of this post... i want to ask him out... is that crazy?  i was always under the impression that if a guy likes you, he'll ask you out, but what if he doesn't realize that i like him?  what if he's just as dumb as Shane was? (no offence there... but really, it was like 5 months!) are all guys slow?  no, no, the really funny part is that the one guy who likes me is the one guy that i could never go out with!  (it's not haha funny so much as it is ironically funny)  and it's not that i could never go out with him because he's somesort of nasty freak, but it's just that he's such a good friend of mine, it would be severly uncomfortable for me.  and the worst part is that he's all about flattery and trying to help me hook up with this guy!  life has become chaos-- and if life is chaos and love is chaos, is life love or better yet, is love life?  oh, i am Zen!  anyhoo, i'm off to watch Shrek, woot.

       Song:  ahead by a century x the hip  RandomQuote:  "This barricade is a piece of shit. I could build better. Yeah, yeah, believe it or not, the kid with the lipstick knows how to build stuff..." -Davey Havok   [ i'm having a profound neufeldian moment.&nbsp; i'm listening to the tragically hip while reading some rather avant-garde&nbsp;poetry which makes it all to apropriate to be listening to this song.&nbsp; and yes, i am most definatly over analyzing this poetry, your know, in a true neufeld way.&nbsp; i'm begining to miss school.&nbsp; not school itself,&nbsp;but&nbsp;the daily regeem, the people (kids and teachers alike), the concept&nbsp;of doing something worth while each day.&nbsp; (song change-- nautical disaster) i have this absurd urge to both cry and re-enact our drama skit to to nautical disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;this song is so bloody depressing.&nbsp; yet it's a work of art seeing as they wrote this song, capturing the emotion perfectly, without ever experiencing it themselves.&nbsp; well, things to do, people to dream, see you all in the morn.

       Song:  put your head on my shoulder x paul anka  RandomQuote:  "when life gives you lemons, clone them and make super lemons" Scotty B  [alrighty, let's recap shall we.  friday.  same old really.  me and my mum went out and got some groceries.  (i  fell in love  with a grocer boy at safeway by the by.  i'm not even kidding.  he's my  cheese and ketchup hero .)    then i made some rather ass kicking cannaloni.  my own recipe too.  yummy.  then i decided to use the little package of face mask that i had bought while out with  Lou  (aka my mum).  so i'm using my mask (which coincidentally was actually a  mud mask for men  because i don't know how to read packages...) and i realized that i had over half of it left.  so i slap some on my mum (who complained that it was stinging her face!!) and i still had some left.  so... my  poor innocent daddy .... got a facial.  ha ha ha!   family facials .  it was hilarous.  oddly enough tho, he actually let me put it on him.  i think he really felt left out. ha ha ha.  "but it's actually for men daddy!  see! (holds up package) it's a guy!"  [saturday.  i volunteered for a forester safety fair that was in cahoots with the boys and girls club and coast capital savings.  it was pretty fun.  i met a lot of really nice people, ate some mighty fine  hot dogs  and  snow cones  and had  a good 6 or 7  suckers.  amy volunteered for the morning with me and we got to  man the mini golf  station (that was conviniently located next to the sucker pull) and then she went home and i became a  plinko god.   i also ran into  leslee  who was working there with her two sisters.  she was doing the mcdonalds gig.   good times.  they gave me  coupons and bandaids.   it was really fun.  i got a little burnt but by the next day it was gone, so woot.  that night i was suposed to go to the  fire works  with my parents, but instead i babysat for their friends and made  a pretty penny .   [sunday.  me and leslee decided to go downtown and hit up the douglas street  farmers/hippi market .  we got dropped off at the  noodle box , grabbed some chow and ate it at the bubble tea bar where tour bus people " observed us in our natural habitat " (leslee's words, not mine)  then we went to the market.  i bought a  restored 70s leather  wrist strap for 10$ and leslee got a pair of super pimped out  pink 70s shades  for 10$ aussi.  oh and did i meantion, we got them from the  cutest gay couple to ever exist .  they were freaking adorable.  after that we just kinda roamed around holding our  leftovers  from the noodle box and our  bubble teas  (which leslee kept forgetting to drink).  at about 3 leslee went home ( a la autobus ) and i met up with my parents and we went to  eternal egypt .  definatly in love with egypt (not that i wasn't already...)  but none the less, it's so different to see these artifacts  up close  than it is to see them in books.  i just couldn't get over how these works of stone and wood were  over 3000 years old .  it was just so hard to comprehend.  and to look at the mummies was just amazing.  there was a mummified  10 year old boy  (approx) and you could see that he had wavy dark brown hair.  you could see his eye lashes.  you could see his  teeth and lips  and i just couldn't get over the fact that this kid is really over 2500 years old.  so i was  blown away  by all of that.  and thats really where the day ended... well actually after the exihbit we went to the imax to see  mysteries of egypt .  it was an alright movie, not really what i had expected, but it wasn't bad.  funny thing tho, when we were waiting for the movie to start the  fire alarm went off .  but it was acutally the warning alarm.  it's not the solid ringing but it rings for a second then stops, the rings again and stops.  it was  bloody annoying , but it stopped right as the movie started.  good timing.   [so, it was a rather eventul weekend.  good times were had by all.  now i'm off to go clean the hell out of my house because  robyn  is coming over in a couple of hours to regale me with stories of her  trip to cali  to embrace her  love affair with ian .

       Song:  assessment x beta band  RandomQuote:  "Harmony, balance adn rhythem. There you have it. That is what life is all about." George Pocock  ******************************************************* in a drunken sky an ominous shadow appears. your ghost of past lurking at the foot of your bed. memories fog over blurring fantasy with reality. you can no longer believe what you once thought was true.  ******************************************************** i stand alone in a long forgotten corridor. matte white paper clutched in my trembling hand. told to meet. told to wait. anticipation stabs at my lungs. arythmia inducing memories. tears flow carrying mascara along. a foot step is heard. jagged breathing ensues. dreams and second thoughts bombard. subconcious steps bacwards. fears tear through. realizations come to light. and long forgotten corridor must stay so, as a matte white paper falls from resolved hands.
