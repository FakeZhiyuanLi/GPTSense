      Within the next month, I plan on registering two different domains and creating websites for each. One website will be for the Computer Science Club that I'll be co-president of next year (Current site:  urlLink http://hpcompsciclub.tripod.com/ ); the other site will be for the Final Fantasy XI clan that I've become a co-leader of (Current site:  urlLink http://foxknights.tripod.com/ ). I designed both of the current sites, but I want to be able to do things that free hosts won't allow (PHP scripting, custom email addresses, etc.). Maybe I'll even migrate this blog to a subdomain to one of them to make image hosting easier.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to do a bunch of the things that I want to do with the websites. That's the stuff I'll be learning in Indeoendent Study this next year, but until then, neither are going to be all that different from what they look like right now. Maybe I'll start learning a few things before school starts; it'd at least give me something to do when I get bored.

      Yeah, I went to go see that movie on Friday, and ironcially I'm making this blog entry "the day after tomorrow" from the POV of it being Friday. I know it sounds stupid, shut up. It was a good movie, and one that I'll probably be adding to my DVD collection (along with the 3 others I've seen so far this summer).  The day after tomorrow is also when I start summer school. That goes until the 18th from 7:30 to 12:45 every day, but I get credit for an entire semester course (Speech), so I'm not complaining. At least I don't have baseball to worry about this week in addition to summer school.

      Apparently our series with Kilgore was only a one game series instead of a best of 3. We lost last night 4-3, so that ends our season for this year. And if that wasn't bad enough, our bus broke down while we were there. Luckily it didn't take that long for a replacement one to arrive, and I was home a little after midnight. Time to go to sleep now.

      Yep, that's what MapQuest says for the time to get from Dallas to Sulphur Springs. Now, if we lay out the rest of the day on a timeline, I can't quite figure out why we're leaving so early:  3:00 - Bus leaves HP 4:30 - Bus arrives in Sulphur Springs 7:30 - Game Starts 9:30 - Game ends/Bus leaves Sulphur Springs 11:00-11:30 - Bus arrives at HP  I do have to question the three hour gap in between us arriving there and the start of the game. We need 1 hour to warm up, so I could understand 90 minutes to 2 hours. But 3?? Hope I can find a way to entertain myself; I'll be needing one.

      Coach Gibbins called my house today while I was out seeing  Shrek 2  (which is just as good, if not better, than the first). We play tomorrow in Sulphur Springs @ 7:30 PM, but the but leaves at 3:00. That means I have to be up at the school between 2:15 and 2:30 to get everything ready. This sounds like I might be the only student trainer at the game tomorrow...  If Wes is no longer going to be the Varsity trainer (and I'm therefore the only one), it'll be interesting to see how games after this week are handled. If we win this series, we'll have games on days that I'm in summer school. Games that are after 1:10 (or that I have to leave for after that time) won't be a problem, but I don't know how State will work if we go that far since I doubt I can miss (at least) 2 days of summer school to go to wherever those games will be played. Oh well, I guess we'll just see how it works out.

      I know everyone loves to be out of school, but it can get extremely boring sometimes when there's nothing for you to do. Wait, let me rephrase that -- when there's nothing that you  want  to do. I have tons of games downstairs that I could (and probably need to) play, but I just don't really want to right now.  I know that I didn't post yesterday, mainly because nothing all that eventful ever happens on a Sunday. My day pretty much consisted of going to church, eating lunch, and playing FFXI. Not all that interesting to talk about.  Granted, today hasn't been much more interesting. Wake up, go eat lunch, and then come home and post this. Yeah, that's been about it. Now it's time to go try and find something to entertain myself...

      We won the series against McKinney (10-0 on Thursday at the game I missed, and 8-1 today), so this next week we'll play Kilgore. No clue where that is (except that it's somewhere in Texas), but apparently it takes a while to get there. From what I've heard, the games will either be here, Kilgore, Tyler, or some combination of those places. Coach Gibbins said that he'd call me this next week and let me know the times and places of the games (hopefully the times for the bus, also). If we keep advancing, the State Finals are the 10th and 11th of June.  Apparently putting eye black on me is now good luck for the team. Before the game, someone pointed out that they won the last game they put it on me, and now they're 2/2. It doesn't really bother me -- I just have to remember not to wipe my face.  This might be the last week that I'm able to work the playoff games since I start summer school 1 week from Tuesday. I didn't want to have to take Speech next year, so my only other option was to take it during the summer. 3 weeks vs. 18 weeks?? I think I'll take the 3...

      And for the record,  yes , I did miss the bus yesterday. I got there at 5:00, and they decided that it would be a good idea to leave between 4:45 and 5:00. Oh well, at least I didn't get in trouble for it (or haven't to this point anyway). From what I heard, we apparently won last night so there will only be the 4:00 game tomorrow unless we lose.  Went and saw  Troy  today after school -- pretty good movie, even though it did border on being a bit too long for me. Next up:  Shrek 2  sometime near the beginning of next week.  Angela claims that she's having a night swim party at her house on Saturday or Sunday (although it's most likely Sunday) for "all of us" -- I assume this means our U.S. History class. She said that she would call me with the time, so I guess I'll see if she actually meant it or not sometime tomorrow.

      Yeah, I know...Well, I  meant  to update this daily. Guess (at least over the past few days) it hasn't been as daily as the title says...  2 exams down, none to go :) -- All I have to do from today (actually yesterday) until tomorrow is just show up at school for any periods that I have a class. No exams, but we have to be there for attendance purposes. Today I have my Computer Science AP class; I think we're watching  Harry Potter and CoS  for the two hour exam period. At least I'm taking my Xbox and that DVD up to the school with that intent. My guess is that 5 kids out of our class will show up. Granted, that's an extremely high percentage when we only have a little over 10 anyway, but we'll see.  Another baseball game tonight, and no one thinks it is important enough to tell the trainer when it's time for the bus to leave. 5:00? 5:30? 4:00? I've been told all those times, all by different people. My guess is somewhere between 5:00-5:30, so that's when I'm showing up. If the bus is gone and I get in trouble for it, it's not like there was ever a consensus on when I was supposed to show up. If I do end up going, it will be close to 11:00 before I get home (game ends ~9:30, 1 hour drive home, then cleaning up the stuff and actually driving to my house).  Well, I guess that's about it. Time to entertain myself for about an hour and a half and then leave to go up to the school.

      Really, tomorrow is my only hard day of exams. Here's our school's schedule:   Tuesday:  1st Period Exam - U.S. History Periods 3-6 2nd Period Exam - PreCal PAP TAG   Wednesday:  7th Period Exam - English AP (no exam in any AP class, but we still have to show up) Periods 3-6 3rd Period Exam - Physics AP (except I have to do Computer Science AP late testing at this time)   Thursday:  5th Period Exam - Spanish AP 6th Period Exam - Computer Science AP   Friday:  4th Period Exam - Theater Arts (long term project turned in today) 8th Period Exam - Lunch   Varsity Baseball plays this week on Thursday @ 7:30 and Saturday @ 4:00. I'll be working both those games (and the third, if necessary). Apparently no one thinks I'm going to be a trainer for Varsity Football next year (which I  am ), so a bunch of people got happy about that when I told them. We also have a picture for that during the 8th Period Exam on Friday -- good thing I rearranged my schedule to have lunch then.

      Starting Tuesday we have exams, so I've been having to do exam reviews all weekend. I did do more than just that over the past 2 days though.   Friday:  Right after school, we had to finish filming our Theater Arts movie over at Highlander Stadium. There was a slight miscommunication between the athletic director and myself, so I almost had to sign a 1 million dollar liability waiver. Good thing Mr. Martin and Ms. Boyer help me take care of that issue. While I'm not going to name anyone specifically, there's one person that in my group that I honestly hope I never have to see again after this school year. Enough on that.  We also had our 2nd playoff game against Hillcrest on Friday. J.T. had a little bit of fun with me right before the game started, so I took a picture when I got home, and I'll put it up here. We won something like 12 or 13 to 1, so we play against someone else this next week. Not sure who, where, or if I'll even do it since it will be in the middle of exams.  Edit: Here's the picture of what J.T. did to me at the baseball game on Friday. I got quite a few comments about it...       Saturday:  Started working on my U.S. History exam review (since I'm not in AP). Mid-morning I left to go help someone get their DSL hooked up, but I couldn't do any more than just get all the hardware set up since DSL won't be activated until the 19th. Guess I know where I'll be going after exams one day...  I was gone the majority of the afternoon because I went to go see Van Helsing with my grandmother. I thought it was a pretty good movie; I liked it about as much as I did the first X-Men. Here's the list of the other movies that we're going to see this summer:     -Troy    -Shrek 2    -The Day after Tomorrow    -Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban    -The Chronicles of Riddick    -I, Robot    -The Bourne Supremacy    -King Arthur    -The Village  Nothing big happened last night, I just played a little FFXI and created this blog. Then went to sleep as my away message normally says.    Sunday:  Hmmmm....To-Do list for today:     -Finish U.S. History Exam Review    -Change script for Theater Arts movie    -Finish reading  Grapes of Wrath     -Upload picture from baseball and add it to this post    -Get movie clip to Andrew  And, yeah...that's about it. I need to read the Blogger help file this afternoon for uploading/linking pictures. Pretty sure it's the same as normal HTML (the rest of this markup is), but I just want to make sure.

      Why did I remember that I had a Blogger account from  2 or 3 years ago all of a sudden? Not really sure...but might as well use it since I'm bored right now.  For anyone that's reading this and doesn't know who I am, I'm not entirely sure why you're here, but feel free to keep reading. My name is Jeff Guebert (my last name is where the title of my blog comes from, courtesy of one of my friends about 10 years ago), I'm 17, and I live in Dallas. There, you know me now.  I'll probably get around to writing a more interesting (and longer) post tomorrow. For now, though, it's time to go to sleep...

      For quite a while the internet has been available wirelessly at locations known as "hotspots" which can be found in places like Starbucks, McDonalds, and airports. GPRS and EDGE have allowed people to get on the internet anywhere that they can get a digital cellphone connection. Take the availability of cellphone networks, replace the necessity for a cellphone with a wireless card (much like 802.11a/b/g), and up the speed to almost twice that of a T3 connection:   that's  802.16 .  This isn't the only new technology that's competing to be the next thing home users will use for their internet connection, but with speeds and convenience on this level, whatever technology end up becoming widely adopted will take the internet to a whole new level.

      I go through these phases of researching different areas in technology in depth so that a) I can explain it to people if they ever ask me about it, and b) I can make a stronger argument for getting that technology in our house. :)  Anyway, the latest of these research sprees I've gone on has been Bluetooth. I remember about 1-2 years ago when this technology was first starting to be advertised by manufacturers, but one of the major problems then was that products made by two different companies were not guaranteed to (and often didn't) work with each other. Just another example of why I think standards are one of the best things that can happen in the tech industry.  The uses for Bluetooth are very impressive even though it is only considered a "wire replacement". Have a laptop and cell phone both enabled with Bluetooth? Instant wireless modem via either GPRS or EDGE. Bluetooth headset? Acts as a speaker on pretty much anything that makes sound.  More and more products on the market are staring to incorporate Bluetooth, and I wouldn't be surprised if eventually every single peripheral is completely wireless via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or some other wireless standard.

      Aka,  How to Make my Life Miserable . So, want to know the secret?  Subway. No, I'm not kidding. I had Subway for lunch on Monday, and Thursday was the first time I could manage to even look at my computer monitor since then. I'm still not completely better (although I can eat pretty much whatever I want to now), and every once in a while I'll have issues walking straight or standing up since I'm still a little dizzy. Oh well, at least it's better than spending over 2 full days doing nothing but lying in my bed. Summer and I really need to have a talk about what I'm supposed to be able to do and how I'm supposed to feel (Hint: This isn't one of them).

      Yep, I'm done with all 14 days of summer school now and (hopefully) have credit for Communication Applications (Speech) now. Nothing left for me to do this summer except sleep, play video games, and go watch movies. Oh yeah, and hopefully be able to update this more often than once per week.

      3 speeches in a week should not be allowed. But unfortunately it is, so that took up the majority of my time this past week. Friday I saw  The Chronicles of Riddick  (which surprised me by being a pretty good movie, more on that tomorrow) and worked on my grandparents' computer. Then I had to take the ACT yesterday, go work on 2 different people's computers, and then today I went back to my grandparents to show them how to use the computer after I made the changes to it on Friday. Tomorrow I begin my last week of summer school (which hopefully won't involve a lot of speeches). Life? Lighten up a little.....please.

      Yeah, been a few days since I updated. Lots of stuff going on, though. Anyway, let me think about what's happened...  Yesterday I had to give my speech over HDTV. I think it went pretty will; everyone seemed to enjoy it, and someone in my class even told another one of my friends how good it was. I get to give another one tomorrow over King Tut which has to make use of a visual aid. Hopefully that one will go just as well.  Tonight I tried to log into Star Wars Galaxies to play (even though I don't particularly like the game and enjoy playing FFXI much more), but I ran into an interesting problem. Somehow my account has been cancelled, and I know that I'm not the one that did it. My only guess is that Sony cancelled it after an inactivity period (of what, 3 weeks??), so they got an email from me tonight asking them to "un-cancel" it. There's probably not a great chance that I'd be renewing my account anyway once my current subscription expires, but if I have to jump through hoops to get my account activated again, there's no way that I'm going to be playing this game that much longer.  Oh yeah, and there's been way too much rain here recently. Make it stop!!

      Yep, this is been a "1,2,3" weekend for me (as indicated by the topic title). Now for some more in depth discussion of each of these things:   1 Week of Summer School Down:  Friday marked the end of my first week of summer school (and the equivalent of the end of the 1st 6 Weeks). My first real speech is on Monday, so I have to finish preparing for it over the weekend. It has to be an informative speech with no visual aid, so I decided to do it over HDTVs. My second one will be on Wednesday which is an informative speeck with a visual aid, and I think I'll do that one on either the Egyptian Pyramids or the Sphinx.   2 SAT II Tests:  Today I took my first two SAT II tests, Writing and Mat IIC. I could have done a third, but I didn't feel like doing Spanish and there was no way I was going to do Physics. I'll probably do 1 or 2 more at the start of next school year.   3 for 3 on HP Movies:   Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban  definitely gets two thumbs up from me. It left out quite a bit that was in the book, but since most everyone that is going to see the movies has already read the book, the stuff they left out was fine. I don't know if I would say it was better than the second one (Chamber of Secrets), but there's no way it was worse.  That about covers my weekend so far. Nothing big planned for tomorrow except for working on my speeches, but who knows what could pop up at the last moment.

      So, I get out of summer school today to go eat lunch. Wendy's, long line; Whataburger, long line; Chick-Fil-A,  extremely  long line; McDonald's, 4 cars? Maybe they're having problems due to the massive power outages we've been having, but I went over there since I figured I could get my food faster.   Yeah, it went faster, but I was very impressed by the system they have set up. Instead of using the normal speaker, there were 2 women standing outside with PDAs in their hands. 2 cars at a time would give their order, and it would be transmitted wirelessly into the kitchen. Then, they had a manager with a money belt standing near the first window so that both cars could pay at the same time. Then, each of the cars head to the second window to get their food right as the next set of cars is coming around. No wonder there's no line, even Chick-Fil-A's dual lane system doesn't work as well (or else they're about 100x as popular).  Still, the point remains that I think this is an awesome use of technology and that more restaurants should make use of features like this. Not just fast food, but also places like Chili's and other sit-down restaurants. Waiter is ready to take your order? He sends it back to the kitchen to speed up the process. Need a refill on that drink? Give something to the customers so that they can signal when they need one. If restaurants started to embrace technology with ideas like this, I'd gladly pay a few extra dollars each time I went there to help support the costs. 10 years from now, no telling how we'll be getting our food, but I can assure you that it will rely on technology much more than it does now.

      Yeah, so 18 hours with electricity is the best way to spend the first part of summer in Texas, right? RIGHT?? Actually, that would be a "no". We had a huge thunderstorm cell come straight through the Dallas area last night (while I was out seeing  Miss Saigon ) which knocked out our power until 4:00 this afternoon.  2 days of summer school down, and the class is turing out to be fairly entertaining. Our teacher makes lots of jokes and tells us stories, so it doesn't seem like we're really there for 5 hours and 15 minutes. We start giving our first speeches tomorrow, though, but hopefully this trend will hold...

      Wow..........strange (and bad) movie. I won't spoil it for any of you who actually think you want to go see it, but trust me, it's not worth the $6 or $7 dollars to get a ticket. Actually, it's the only movie this summer that I've seen which I won't be getting on DVD when it comes out as a result of me hating the movie (see my note next to  The Terminal ):    Van Helsing  Troy  Shrek 2  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  The Day After Tomorrow  The Terminal (Won't be getting on DVD since it's not a movie I'd watch all that often, but it was still good)  Spiderman 2  King Arthur  I, Robot  The Bourne Supremacy  Catwoman   About time to eat lunch and then I'm going back to CPL for a few hours. They better not be showing  The Village  there....

      That's kinda how yesterday felt  :)  After my friend and I got to the hotel 30 minutes later than I originally planned, we figured that registration would already be going on. It was a good guess if they had actually bothered to follow their schedule. The registration tables didn't even open up for another hour and 30 minutes, then we stood in Line #1 for about 40 minutes, got our nametage, then stood in Line #2 for about 30 minutes more. Note to CPL staff: A schedule is something you're supposed to follow, not just create and then conveniently forget.  I'm probably going back again on Saturday for at least part of the day (maybe not all, there's only so much I can actually do). Tommorow, I have  The Village  to go see, and I'll post my thoughts on that when I get home.

      I've had this DVD for over a year, but never got around to watching it until last night (well, technically early&nbsp;this morning). While it's probably not going to be a movie that I watch as often as some of my others ( Galaxyquest ,  The Mummy (Returns) , etc.), this has to have been one of the best non-action and saddest movies that I've seen in a very long time. If you haven't seen it (and you can manage to sit through something where stuff doesn't blow up every 5 seconds) definitely go out and rent it.  CPL starts today, so expect my post tomorrow to deal with my experiences that I have there.

      The numbers don't stand for quite the same things that they did the first time though. This time, it's 1 DDR Party, 2 FFXI Websites, and 3 Extremely Good Movies.   1 DDR Party:  Tuesday night Sam had a DDR party over at his house. While only a few of us actually had prior experience playing, it was fun, and a bunch of people made the comment that they wanted to go out and buy it. It did strike me as being a little humorous when people aske me if this was just a normal DVD. Not sure how you would connect the pads then...   2 FFXI Websites:  The site I am designing for my FFXI clan finally went online on its new paid hosting, and I have also been recruited as the lead person for the FFXI division of another website. Not exactly what I would call the best timing to have both of these come up together, but it'll at least keep me busy for a while.   3 Extremely Good Movies:  I saw 3 movies this week:  I, Robot ,  The Bourne Supremacy , and  Catwoman . I liked all of these movies a whole lot, and definitely recommend that anyone reading this should go see them.  I, Robot  was a very entertaining cdi-fi/mystery movie,  The Bourne Supremacy  was an extremely good sequel (although I suggest seeing  The Bourne Identity  first), and  Catwoman  rivals  Spiderman 2  as being one of the best superhero(ine) movies I've ever seen.  Going along with the number 3, that's how many people called my house within 45 minutes wanting an answer to the exact same question. Not a whole lot of cross-communication going on there...

      Yesterday marked the one month point until we have to go back to school (August 16th). Every summer I always say that I'm going to do a whole lot of stuff, but (as expected) I maybe get about 1/10 of it done. Still in the middle of reading my two books for summer reading which hopefully I can get finished up by the week prior to school starting so I have a few days to review each of them. Anyone that knows me knows that reading comprehension isn't exactly an area where I excel in. Plot summary? Yes. Characters? Kinda. Style analysis and what the deeper meaning of lines 5-23 are? No. &nbsp; For the past 4 nights (Tuesday-Friday), we've had Vacation Bible School at our church. Since my grandparents are the ministers, I of course get to help with  everything  that we do (food, singing, crafts, etc.). At least that's over with and I hold the unofficial veto power for any and all future years. &nbsp;  Ratchet and Clank  (the first one, not  Going Commando ) is my new favorite game. I'm about 2/3 to 3/4 done with it already, and next up on my list is the sequel. I'm trying to play and beat&nbsp;games that have sequels (or simply more games coming out in the series) coming out this fall ( R&amp;C: Up Your Arsenal ,  Sly 2: Band of Thieves ,  Jak 3 , etc.) before the sequels come out. Then not to mention great games such as  Beyond Good and Evil ,  Metal Arms: Glitch in the System , and  Prince of Persia  that I still need to play. I wonder if 1 month if even enough...

       Sam wanted me to make sure that I mentioned that he and Stephaine Holford were over at my house on Tuesday. Sam and I were supposed to be working on the Computer Science Club website,&nbsp; but all we really did was play DDR for about 1-2 hours. So Sam (and Stephanie), here's your "shout out" that you wanted on my blog&nbsp; :).

      Hope that anyone who bothers to read this had a great 4th of July weekend and did lots of fun stuff. We didn't go anywhere like we normally do since tonight we are going to see the second musical that we have tickets to,  The King and I .  Since Saturday evening, I have been downloading episodes from two of my favorite comedies on Fox. The first one,  urlLink  Quintuplets  , just premiered a few weeks ago, but has already become one of the shows that I try to watch every week. The other show,  urlLink  Arrested Development  , has completed its first season and is going to start its second in the fall. Both of these shows are part of Fox's LOL Sunday lineup, so it makes them easy to watch along with  Malcolm .

      The past two days have been pretty boring for me. Next week is a completely different story, though. If you're going to read this post, however, you get a run down of the boring past two days, not the exciting future week.  Yesterday I played FFXI....lots. Almost gained an entire level (really 2, but I had so little XP left to go for the first one that I'm not counting it) by fighting in Batallia Downs. Kazham needs to go die and take all of its evil Gobs with it. Also started the first Splinter Cell on Xbox (again, I have this habit of restarting games that I'm not all that far in if I haven't played them in ages) last night, but I'm still on the first level. So much for trying to diminish my backlog of games this summer.  Today was a little more active, but not by much. I went out to lunch at Cici's Pizza and then came home and started playing SWG. Not really sure how I've done comparatively in SWG today to FFXI yesterday, but I've still made progress. I also explained to my parents about upgrading their cellphones to GSM (I'm the only one with that right now), but I still need to get them to go to Cingular and actually do the upgrade.  Yeah, that's it. Sad, huh??

      Since there were no big movies that came out today that I wanted to see (although I probably will rent  Collateral  when it comes out on DVD), the movie that made today's cut was  The Manchurian Candidate.  Well, the reviews were definitely right on this one; it was an extremely good movie and a welcome change from last week. If you've seen the original (I haven't), it supposedly changes quite a bit of stuff up (such as who is running for office, etc.). No complaints from me though, and it's definitely one of my recommended movies of the summer.

      Two words, or rather a word and a number:  Doom. 3.  Wow....yeah, that's probably the best word to describe it. Even though I don't have the most powerful computer in the world (P4 2.0, 768 RAM, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128 MB video card), this game  still  looks incredible. And even though it's not going to scare the living daylights out of you every 3 seconds (well, it might at harder difficulty levels; I'm playing on the easiest setting and only at the very beginning of the 4th "mission"), this is a much better source for being scared than that pathetic excuse for a movie in general called  The Village.
