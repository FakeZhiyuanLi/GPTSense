        ---- Okay people... my troublesome situation as of now goes as follows: One day I decided to break up with my boyfriend of 8 months. I was upset because I did it for his well-being and I still loved him. I went into town to go for a walk by myself and saw a guy I was talking to at a dance the night before. His name is Chad. Hes a tall kid who is really sweet and VERY smart...he's the most intelligent person I believe I've ever met. Chad was upset as well because he had just broken up with his girlfriend..which we found super odd because we both did it on the same day after seeing eachother the night before. However my breaking up with Dean had nothing to do with Chad...what I hear is his breakup had something to do with me. Sadly after hanging out with him for a long time and being close friends for a few months now, I see that to me...there is no connection that goes past being awsome friends. But Im afraid he may see it differently. So I had him over to my friends house and we were just talking around a fire just me and him, and I told him that I had no intention of being with anyone anytime soon and I didnt have feelings for anyone yet...so I thought well he must get the hint eh? We still hung out a lot after that and just 2 days ago he took me to a local show. he seemed upset the whole time, and when it came time to say goodbye he seemed upset with me. And I think maybe it has something to do with me not flirting with him and hanging out with more people than just him. I THOUGHT HE UNDERSTOOD....ughhh! I should probebly say something but like always I may be over-reacting.           --- Also, the other day I started talking with an x-boyfriend of mine (rollie)whom i dated before I dated Dean (boyfriend of 8 months). Rollie and Dean were close friends and Rollie just recently moved to a city close by to me its about a half an hour away, yet farther from me than where he previously lived. So we started talking and we talked for a long time a couple of times now. It seems as tho I may still be very interested in him (could be bad, could be good). I heard he still has a bit of a flame for me too. I just hope maybe things can progress.
