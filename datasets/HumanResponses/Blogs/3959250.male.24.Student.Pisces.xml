      hi all - finally set up my Blog .. me didn't even knew this existed until Noormie and Melly (Thames) told me abt it .. i was like "what is that" and went home to check on the net immediately.... anyways, think this is a good way to record your feelings n thots to share wif ppl .. read thru melly's and sue's .. thot provoking .. sue, now i know why you enjoy freedom (per friendster) .. was last day of class yesterday .. but the whole gang did not turn up!  no melly, no sue, no vanie, no kalai, no ivan, oh jeez, there were just 7 of us ... am gonna miss all these ppl next semester *sob* .. but nvm, i promised uncle russell that i will organise a revision session where we get together to revise for exams (more like to gather to toktok).  yesterday quite funny, noormie said in the car that ivan is such a gentleman, russ was like 'hey, what do you mean by that? are you saying me and Josh not gentlemen? let me see where is a good place to drop noormie off?" we had a good laugh!  i always enjoy mon & fri lessons and look fwd to attending - talk abt motivation, i jus enjoy time together with the gang (u know who u r).. thurs PR lessons - no kakis at all, 2 classmates are nice (rem i make friends easily) we talk but its diff la!  We can also meet more often outside la -give me a call, advance notice .. wat, JB thot tt stands for James Bond, okie, melly only u and i know how the real JB looks like .. glad to have made many heeheehee   okie, first post cannot be too 'low-so' ...    "true friends are like diamonds, precious n rare.  false friends are like autumn leaves, scattered everywhere!"

      Hi, folks - it's been so long since i sent my post .. in the midst of studying for my PR exams on Thurs, decided to write.  Had first paper on Sun 8 Aug - Media, Com and Society .. Kalai sat in front of me ... sue came late and sat beside me .. phew, good to have a friend sit beside you .. Julian as usual was walking around looking at our answers, and making funny faces, etc.... anywayz, studied till late on 8 Aug morning, chatted with noormie, kalai, melly, josh in betwee... it feels great to have nice classmates, kinda motivates me in my studies .. was buzy buzy at work again as usual .. went to watch The Village (a little disappointed but shall not unveil for the sake of those who have yet to watch) .. went shopping on Mon with my sis and the two lil ones .. i lurve them so much .. can't imagine life without them though!!! bought some clothes .. went back to office today after being off from last Thurs, got 1001 emails to go thru plus preparations for a senior management meeting, but crazy me, it feels really good to be back at work, i actually missed going to work coz i have got a few really fantastic colleagues .. i am trying to study but hubby has his friends over playing jim ruby with tiles so i kept tok tok with them ... read melly's and sue's blogs, glad they enjoyed their nite out (minus Russ for melly maybe?) and that dear sue's in lurve ...

      Greetings to all earthlings,i have come back to BLOGLAND!!!!!  Saturday was finally the end of the exams for me...haha whew glad to be rid of the examination kind of feeling.Good that i managed to see quite a few classmates yesterday,or else next semester harder to see them already.  It was lucky that my memory did not go all kaput so i managed to finish the paper with some missing points only.Man...Russell is quite sick and i feel bad that i didn't go and help accompany him to the doc.Imagine leh right side the chest and arm all feel sharp pain...whew the only time i kena this kind of excruciating pain was when i injured my finger in a soccer accident in sec 2(on the eve of my bday somemore).Hope he gets well man.  After the exam paper i took the MRT over to Tampines lorrr...was preparing to go watch Twins Effect 2 mah...and hahaha me and my friend managed to see Priscilla Chan from Mediacorp with her bf..she seems a bit tanned in real life but still pretty nonetheless :)  For dinner we all ate at this bubble tea shop at Century Square..haha we wanted to order the set meal to eat as there were 4 of us but the set menu looked sucky for the price of 59 dollars leh...so in the end we ordered ala carte.I ordered Curry Chicken,yum yum my favourite.After the satisfying meal i even went to collect my free scoop of Haagen Daaz ice cream worrr :) those who wanna noe more about that pls go to  urlLink https://home.singtel.com/incircle/index.asp  for more details :) Belgian Chocolate was heavenly hmmmm.  Twins Effect 2 was quite ok for me lar..could see my friends did not like it so much lor cos it seemed a bit outrageous...and a lot of them haha said that Jaycee Chan looked yucky.he sure looks like his daddy lor with that big nose.Edison was cool but haha he died very fast.  At night it was watching my favourite team Newcastle United in action but too bad they drew..well better than losing :)  Hope that the day goes well for allllllll.......  CHowzzz  Joshy

Friday The 13th doesn't seem like it for me..haha luckily i woke up with a less serious sinus than i used to these past few days.Anyone got any cure or help for clearing sinus????I played soccer yesterday and my hand hurt....wahh i was damn worried that i couldn't be able to write for my exams leh...  with that kind of spirit i tried to lift my spirits up by thinking positively :) haha so i keep smiling to myself like a goondu hahaha.It worked and haha all of you out there do try smiling to urself when all else fails.  Russ and i went to school together in the afternoon..he picked me up at home mah.Haha there was a funny or rather unusual thing we saw.After Russ parked his car( we were at a multi storey carpark) we were walking towards the stairs to go down when we heard a exhaust running.There was this Hyundai Matrix parked at the very corner...near to the hdb block....it seemed empty at first and so the running exhaust was strange.Until i squinted and saw that the seats were pushed to the back and a guy was lying face down!!!!!!and he was moving in the push up kind of way!!!!wah liews it was lunch time somemore leh...guang tian hua ri zi xia!!!he must be damn horny to be doing it there.On 2nd thought haha it might be exciting for him and his gal lor.  The paper was okie and haha i had to do the open ended questions in the end....hopefully i can manage to pass lor :) I managed to see Elizabeth...haha she still remembers me and glad she not angry at me for changing away her surname.After the paper i went out to see Russ who got out earlier and then we sat outside of the exam room talking lorr.Haha after the whole paper was finished for most of us...some of us went to Russ's car and went off in the car.I wasn't in the car though :) everyone's fave guy Ivan was in the back squeezing with Sue,Noormie and Melly.Haha and Melly was just next to him!!!!God they must have blushing faces :)  I on the other hand was on my way to meet my friends for makan at Simpang Bedok.before meeting i was at city hall and i bought Russ Lee's true Singapore Gui Stories.Man it was the first time i had prata twice in a week at Simpang Bedok..can't argue though cos i like prata :)  Haha tmr is marketing paper finally and i wish allllllll of my friends good luck :) may we all do well in our paper tmr.Haha surprisingly i still dun feel tired yet...well guess i will juz chat chat till i tired then go sleep.

Went to Changi Village after the movie, all might think i ate Nasi Lemak right?haha WRONGG!!! in the end i ate char kway teow plus stingray.still very nice in the end mah so i had a very satisfied tummy...too satisfied in fact that me and my friends went walking around. we walked over to the The Changi VIllage Hotel...went up to the top storey in fact.Wow it was a good view also leh....can see the planes flying past and going towards Changi Airport,somemore very cooling. Hahaha we all also saw a R(A) scene...one of the hotel windows was open and this fat dude was onli wearing a pair of undies and in a provocative scene...haha so scary that we saw that sia...cos we were looking at the courtyard den suddenly see this open window..whew....  Sunday was the start of the exams for me...haha Russell was sitting next to me and everyone's favourite guy,Ivan, was sitting in front of me.Russell would be next to me for Media Law and Ethics also :) Luckily in the end i managed to finish the paper but haha i bullshitted a lot man..dunno will do alright or not.  Wahhh then after the paper had to drive....i never got stuck in such a bad jam b4...i was driving from 6+ until 8.45 worr....haha my butt was painful and my tummy was growling(din eat lunch and dinner mah). Finally i arrived at ChiJMES at 8.45pm and i went over to meet Melly and Sue for a play...haha when i got in i had to sit at the back but it was still alright cos it was quite comfy also.Hossan Leong rox...haha pple keep say he gay...i guess mediacorp has a lot of gay artistes also?CHinaJump after the play was quite okie...music was nice but my ears couldn't take it as we were hanging ard near the live band...haha Russell was really moving to the groove.Met Russell's cool friends and also saw Sue and Melly's friends.Haha feel so paiseh i din go talk to them...i must look very 'dao' lol. went to SImpang Bedok for cheese prata after Chinajump and boi i felt so satisfied after having my tummy growling for so long.  National Day i was helping my dad and afternoon i went to play soccer..chipped one toe nail,din even realise it till after finish playing soccer.In the end i din even watch Singapore Idol and the NDP.Heard that Singapore Idol was funny though..maybe shld catch it on Wednesday and see.

When we reached there,it was unexpectedly still quite full of people even for a weekday.The sun was shining brightly and so it was a good time to go for a dip.The water felt so relaxing...wish all those who are reading this right now was there with me enjoying the water :) we tried all the different pools and the jacuzzi pool was therapeutic indeed...soothed my aching back.  We stopped by around 6.30pm and we took the MRT from Chinese Gardens to Kallang,cos we were going to Geylang to eat eat.IN the end we ordered Chilli Frog Legs,Sambal Kangkong,Kailan,Butter Crayfsh and Fried Beehoon Singapore Style. Somemore imagine the Fried beehoon i wanted onli 4 dollars one,in the end the waiter tot the 3 of us eating and gave us the 8 dollars one.Wahhh cos the beehoon i ate alone,i was struggling to finish it.  :) After the satisfying meal...we just walked along the lorongs and went to Rochor Beancurd to eat a nice bowl of chilled beancurd.It was indeed very enjoyable haha and lucky i din get sunburn at all or else i sure feel pain all over.  Signing out and chowzzz  Joshy
