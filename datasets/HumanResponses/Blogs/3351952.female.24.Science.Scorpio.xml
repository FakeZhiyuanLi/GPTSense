      So, I need to improve my self-esteem.  The thing is, I don't think I have a poor image of myself at all.  I like myself.  Hey, I'm my best friend.  I know that I'm a smart person, I think I'm pretty (most of the time, sometimes you just have those days where you don't like any of your clothes or you can't get your hair done right, but we all have those), I like my body.  I have a little belly pudge, but I think just about the right amount.  If I wanted the perfect body, I would reduce the pudge by a little bit, but overall, I look good.  Anyways...  I'm a good person, I usually like everyone, I honestly can't think of a reason someone shouldn't like me.  However, both socially, and since I started grad school, academically, I just act like I have no confidence in myself.  I have a very difficult time conversing with people until I know them really well.  Even some people I've spent a good amount of time with, I just can't be comfortable in their presence.  I don't know why this is.  I'm constantly worried about what to say, and I just can't hold a normal conversation.  Also academically, which is a big issue lately, I just feel like I haven't accomplished anything in lab.  And I worry that I'm not going about my project right, and I flip out and get super nervous when I have to give presentations, to the point that I give myself diarrhea.  (Woohoo, doesn't everyone want to know all about that?!)  Ever since I got here, I just don't have faith in myself that I am going to succeed.  In college, I was really good at my major.  I didn't particularly like the field, but I got a certain amount of satisfaction from problem solving doing homework, and doing well on a test.  Even when I had to study my brains out, thinking how am I ever going to figure this out, I always did, and did well on the tests.  Here, I started out in a new field, and in the coursework first year I felt a little disadvantaged from not having all the background as it seemed like everyone else had.  But I pulled through, passed everything.  But at every step here I feel like I'm one step behind everyone else or where I should be.  You don't get the satisfaction of a test grade in research telling you that you're at least on track.  Everytime I ask people questions about my work, I feel like I'm bothering them.  When I meet with my advisor, I always feel like he expects more than what I've got.  And that he expects me to work harder and put in more hours than I am.  I would work around the clock, but sometimes I just don't know what to do. Or I have to wait for stuff I ordered to come in.  Or wait to hear back from the tech support people.  It's soo frustrating.  Anyways, I just need to plow through.  But I want to be able to feel better about it.  I really do like what I'm doing.  I just don't like feeling like a complete failure.   Anyways, as for the social problems, I've decided a lot of it is because I just hang out with people who I know through school.  Those are the only people I know in Baltimore.  So school always comes up.  Maybe I'm just intimidated because I feel like everyone else knows so much more than I do.  But hell, I'm here to learn.  And I am learning.  So why should that bother me?   I just can't relax around anyone.  I need to meet other people, but I have no idea how.  I have always had my "little buddy", who is whoever my closest friend is at that time in my life, who you go to parties with, meet new people with, and you can relax around new people because that person is there, and knows who you are.  But I don't have that here.  I need to learn how to get over it, relax, and just go meet some new people.  But again, where?  It's not like I can just saunter into a random bar/coffee shop/wherever, and be like "hey, anyone in here looking for a new pal?"  I got a part-time job, thinking it would help me meet people, and I met people, who I now see at that job, but no one to actually hang out with.  It's hard trying to make friends with girls even, because you feel like you're a guy hitting on them when you're like "hey, we should hang out sometime."  Anyways, I need a new plan.  I've got to change something.

      This is what I have been doing for the past 3 years.  Well, at least the past 1 year certainly.  I took my oral exam at the end of May last year, and since then, I have just been doing lab work.  And I have accomplished pretty much nothing.  I do have more of an idea of what I want to do, but you'd think after 1 year of work, I would actually have acquired some concrete information.  However, I have not.  I have nothing.  Zero.  Zilch.  If I don't get something done this summer, I will have exactly the same poster as I did last year.  I think in that case I wouldn't put it up because it would be so pathetic.   The thing is, I don't understand how this is happening, and what I am doing wrong.  I really do try to work hard.  I just get stuck on these stupid problems that I'm sure nobody else is having.  For instance, I've been trying to get a real-time PCR assay going since about January.  Finally it looked like my primers were good, I had a kit and a protocol that worked, but oh, suddenly, I can't get my RNA isolated correctly.  Either it's not dissolving, or I have protein contamination.  Yes, having this problem might be acceptable, but not being able to fix it for 3 weeks is not.  This is my life.  One stupid problem after another that I can't figure out what in the world I'm doing wrong.   When you feel like a complete failure all the time, it's really hard to motivate yourself to keep coming in and keeping your pace up.  Because really, if I'm not going to get anything done, I might as well have a clean house, or be well rested, or getting plenty of exercise.  You'd think.   It makes me want just chuck it and start over with something else.  Get a job.  Do something and be successful.  But I don't want to give up and quit.  I have to make this work.  So maybe I'll write another post this time next year and I'll have my assay working.
