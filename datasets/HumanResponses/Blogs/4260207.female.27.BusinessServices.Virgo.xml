       Ugh.. It’s Monday.  Mondays in the office totally SUCK! Our office manager has a real problem with life in general I think. She is so negative and the office gossiper. Drives me nuts. Who has time for that type of malarkey? Mountains are made out of mole hills in every situation and it’s really unnecessary and unfortunate. Those type of people are the kind that totally destroy morale in an office. I for one am totally sick of hearing about how everything in the office is wrong or mis-communicated to her. She’s always the victim. UGH! I just cannot deal. I’m hitting the road today in an attempt to increase our patient census. Marketing day! Hey, it gets me out of this office—away from the nonsense! Why can’t people just come to work and work? I’m a get to the point of business kind of gal. I try and keep to myself and I understand upper management (since I was at my last job) and that totally pisses the OM off. At every job I have had, I get along beautifully with the boss. No brown-nosing involved. I am a hard worker, very efficient, creative and professional—that’s it. No hidden ass kissing going on!  Feeling great today on the weight-front… Wow, I just really feel “on it” today. I will get a lot of walking in today trecking across hospital campuses in effort of upping the census. I’ll have a nice low cal salad for lunch and some pork chops for dinner along with some veggie then a few pieces of a frozen peach for desert. I will be good to go. Leslie Sansone and I will be taking our 2 mile walk this evening in my living room… Life is good.  I need to get busy at work here. I need to whip these people into shape here. Oh and might I just tell you that I look good today!! New clothes—ones which accent my new bod very nicely!!  Ta Ta…until later… Current Weight 157

       Whew-  Another big CHECK off the to-do list.  The flowers are done with the exception of miscelaneous final touches ie. gold beads etc.  I must admit, the flowers are totally gorgeous!        Did well with weightloss this week.  2 lbs down.  Actually more like 5 knowing the scale read 162 for a few days straight.  I am very happy with that.      I went shopping yesterday.  I got tons of new clothes.  Very much needed!  Life is good.        I feel like I did not have much of a "relaxing" weekend.  Busy work tends to really wear me down.  It was quality busy work but none the less very tiresome.      I think I will turn in rather early this evening.  I am so looking forward to my soft sheets and comfy blankets.  It's rather chilly this evening I believe it to be in the low sixties to high fifties.  Very abnormal for this time of year considering that August is usually sweltering hot!      More tomorrow!

       Good Morning.    I slept rather not well last night!   We had very strong thunderstorm which knocked the power out... No power, no air conditioning!  It was humid too.  I woke about 2:45am pretty darn clamy!      Today My sister and I go shopping for some last minute items for our flower making extravaganza this evening with my mother in law.  We are also checking on 3 of the local gabriel brother stores.  My sister is an Allocater with the corporate office.  She figured she might as well kill 2 birds with one stone and make this leisurely visit a little business too!  I don't mind.. I LOVE shopping a Gabes!        We were up pretty darn early this morning.  I like to get up before my visitors do.  That way I can straighten up the items that were left unorderly from the night before (My husband is notorious for leaving soda cans, papertowels and plates/glasses lying around) and my sister... she pretty much is the same if not worse!!  lol I don't mind picking up though.  I'm one of those anal retentive folk who has to have everything in it's place!  I guess that's the Virgo in me!      On the weight front..  Still feeling wonderful on the 800 cal.  I cannot be more happy with the Lean System 7 supplement.  I feel so on track again and I can see the loss this week.  Honestly!      More later!      Weight: 159

       Today is Friday and I am so happy about it!  I made it through the week and my commute to work was flawless!  On the weightloss front:  Feeling great great great!  I noticed this morning that my little stomach pouch is getting smaller… A few more lbs and it should be gone!  You know you are doing something right when you start to notice these things.  I am slowly but surely learning that the scale does not tell all!!   On another aside, my boss told me today that I am really getting skinny (my boss is male) so for him to notice is pretty awesome!  What a boost!  I must be doing something right!  It’s definitely a happy day thus far.  It is only 9:06 am so a lot could change between now and 4:30 pm.  I have a busy weekend ahead of me.  That is always good.. It keeps me from having unnecessary snacks throughout the weekend.  Weigh-in on Sunday.  We’ll see.  If I can hold the 159 I’d be pleased.. truly.  After seeing the scales at 162 again (which I do think is water weight and picking up free weighting again) I’ll be happy to just be in the 150’s.  I’ve got 19 lbs to go to my first goal which is ideal body weight for my height and age.  My personal goal is 130 so in reality I still have 29 lbs to go.  I know I can do it too!   Alrighty then.. Heading over to 3FC to see what my friends are up to.  Good Day!  Cheerie-O  GS  Current Weight 159

      Good morning. Had a pretty easy drive to work this am. I am so glad it’s Thursday! Being Thursday means two things to me today: 1.) Tomorrow is FRIDAY!! And 2.) I have a day to clean my house before my sister gets here tomorrow. I’ve got a pretty busy weekend coming up (as all weekends have been most recently!). Sis is getting Married in 2 months so we’ve been tackling some of the major “tasks” of planning this shindig!  Little History on the family and why I’m here (in Harrisburg area) and why they’re there (Pittsburgh area)—about 4 hours drive.  About 4.5 years ago, I met my husband, Jeremy on the internet! Luckily he was in Pennsylvania and only 4 hours away! We dated for about 6 months to a year before I decided that it was serious. Then I moved. A year later we were married and I have been here for about 4 years now. Very Happy Years! I miss my family but I have to say that I also enjoy living so freely away from them. I visit with them about once every 2 months or so, or when needed. In this case, I am seeing them pretty often in preparation for wedding and shower.. My baby sister is getting MARRIED!!  Anyway. Last night, after work (and the fair for the nursing home) Jeremy and I headed to the Vitamin Shoppe. I have been dying to try the new supplement out; Lean System 7. We trecked up there and picked some up. I have been “peeing” every 5-10 minutes! I guess that’s a side effect but hey, if it’s going help me out here then so be it!  Davids Bridal was the next stop right next door. I had to go in and pick up my bridesmaid dress. Our dresses for the wedding were ordered a year ago! Size 18 nowhere NEAR fitting my fat butt at the time. After losing 66 lbs the dress was HUGE! So I went to re-order about 4 weeks ago and it came in so I picked that up. I ordered the shoes for all the bridesmaids- my mom was kind enough to pay for everyone’s shoes. I called her from the store and she gave me the CC number.. Another big CHECK off the list!  It was a late night.. Went to in-laws to hang out and try on dress for her. She will most likely be doing alterations for me.  Wedding flowers are being assembled this weekend at my mom-in-laws, hence the visit from sis. My mother in law works as a bridal consultant. She has really helped my sister out with this wedding stuff. She is awesome with flowers. It should be a fun time.  I need to jet. I have a lot of fun things to do here at work today. Feeling very good today. It’s hot and humid and gray skies today. Current weight 159

      Today started off with a bang! At work today, our company is taking a "good ole fashion day at the fair" to a nursing home.  We are dressed in cowboy-ish type garb.    I got to wear jeans today which is nice for a change.  Right now, I'm sitting at my desk with my "garb" on and wearing a cowboy hat. Oh what fun!  I have an hour commute to work each day.  That's bad enough.  Recently major construction started to take place on the highway which I travel so I have to take an exit 15 miles before my normal exit as a detour. That's been going ok but today, as I turned onto the street where my office is located,  low and behold (2 minutes to 7:30am) a tractor trailer tried to turn around in the street and got stuck in some grass.  All vehicles traveling in that direction were trying to turn around right in the street! Luckily, it only delayed my arrival time by 5 minutes!  I feel like a kid today! Like I am going on a field trip or something.. More later  I had some fruit this morning and some whole wheat crackers.  I will be on the road around lunchtime so I am going to have to grab some subway-  I think I will do a salad though so I will be a-ok.  Water Water Water!!  I am trying to have a nice loss to report this week.  Current Weight 159

      Today was a busy day...  I was excited to get this blog started. Finally at 9:47 pm I got it together!   I belong to a diet forum  urlLink www.3fatchicks.com  and noticed my friend Sarah had a "blog" so I decided that this might be something that I would like to use to post my daily encounters with weightloss among other happenings in my life.  Today was a good day, busy but very good.  I ate totally on plan and stayed within my calorie range I have set for myself.  To date, I have lost 66 lbs and am pretty darn proud of it.  I started my journey on March 8th, 2004.  I have 19 lbs. to go to reach my first goal weight.  I decide at that point if I would like to go any further.  I have been motivated and encouraged by a bunch of great people at 3FC.  What a great place.  The weather has been unusual these days.  It hardly feels like summer.  More like fall.  I like fall but maybe not quite this soon.   Gearing up for vacation in 3 weeks.  I cannot wait.  I need a break. Heading to the beach for a week.  RELAXATION..  Now that's the key to every womans success. Wouldn't you agree?  That's it for me today.  I am hoping to post daily.  This will be an awesome reflection of my weightloss journey during the last and hardest pounds.  Good Night !
