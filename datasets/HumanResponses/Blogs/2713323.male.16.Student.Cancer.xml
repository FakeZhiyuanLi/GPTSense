      Hey, i just got back from pool with Jeremy, sheng hao and the others...quite fun yeah. This coming monday is yi gins bdae, going out with her...don't know who's going too. Neeways...what to get her?! I really don't know lol. Maybe i'll go buy tommorrow. Well i had to take off my socks this morning because they were angle length, then after school the prefect wanted to return it to me, and i took a look at the bag and said, forget it. I can't believe Mrs Ng made us stoop so low, taking our socks from a bag filled with them. Well i'll have to get new socks now. All because of that...yeah. Maths in school was really loooong today, the four straight periods seemed like 5 hours. Hahah i scored 24 for a maths, very shocked. Lady Luck is on my side. Mrs pereira said we cant drop A maths. O well, im just going to do nothing during that period, cos i've reached a point of No return, i cant catch up. CLB tommorrow. 8 am. sheesh. so early....................ciao.

      Hey2, just came back from school, tired. Took the A maths test today, haha, i did the 1st question, and left the 2,3,4,5 BLANK, lol i think i'll get maximum 10 marks...i'm going to drop A maths yeah. Anyho, todays chemistry lesson was quite okay, at least i understood a little bit of the alien language she was speaking...at least. hmm. O hell, i cant wait till i get michelles letter, valueable info inside hmm? I'm not feeling that bad about the Os now...don't know why but it feels good to be like this...mood swings maybe. I skipped CLB today, and i don't think any of the students went too...hah, this saturday at st.pats...Nooo! Gauddamnit i have to reach there at 9am. AM. That means i'll have to wake up early on a bloody saturday MORNING. Funny, i have the mood to write today, wonder why. Yeah and i met up with Jeremy and Ridz at Mac siglap today whilst on the way to buy my hair spray. Ate and Chit-chatted, the usual, walked home, taking the short cut by climbing over the fence at this estate with i cant seem to remember the name. Oh...theres Daniel calling me to MU, gtg, bye. Feeling like shit now, sadsadsad. Thinking of a part of the Motleycrue song... : When I had you, I had everything, now all I have is this photograph....

      yep, its chinese new year now. Feeling really tired, just came back from a movie. The school's concert was boring and the only interesting event was the lion dance performance, brings back old memories for me in primary school, was in the troupe, i played the drums. Anyway, i got ignored in school today, yeah, shit happens. Thank god i have my bros. What am i talking about? i always get ignored. I cant wait till school reopens, exciting information awaits me. :D. My pop told me something yester-morning that really left me thinking, its a quote by gandhi. " An eye for an eye makes the world go blind." O well, later.

      Sooooo bored. Weekends past so quickly. Friday passes relatively fast because of school and activites after that, leaving you no time to go out, cept maybe for supper or something. Saturday passes really fast, before you know it, its time to sleep. Sunday passes quite ok...and when its like this, you have no mood to go out cos of the constant reminder to have to go to school tommorrow, which ruins your entire sunday. So here i am, a loser, sitting in face-to-face with his computer screen, and a geography textbook sitting in front of him. DOH. This is how i spend Sunday afternoons. Shitty and Sucky. No mood for lunch now do we. Heh, very soon it'll be the big Os...worried sick. My aims? L1R4, if i get 15 i'd be happy sick. Grades? Come come let me show you...English=b3 Emaths=a2 Humans=b4 Physics=c5 Chem=c5 Art=b3. Tada. Total of 17 points. Hmm....i wonder if i can get the -2 from CCA points...You know, I'm supposed to be studying now, but i'm too lazy, just like every other day since the start of school. Cant wait for my next crue box set to come, found a place that sells it cheap, in fact, 1/4 less cheaper, compare 80 bucks with 120. Waiting for geng to come now, don't know whether my dad is having a bad mood, for me, i think i'm feeling a little shitty now, perhaps because its a sunday, or, the fact that i'm forced to study so early in the afternoon. Hmm...I need some good music and soccer now. Come to think of it, i may have a large circle of friends, but there are less then 15 that remains true to me...some that used to be really close are drifting away, just like sand through the hourglass...and so are the days of our lives. O yeah, i better go write ricardo a testimonial now...in the mood to type yeah. O, i forgot to include the segment where you have to tell what you did yesterday or today...yeah...for me, i walked to kel's house in the afternoon...when i was hiking up the hill, i took of my shirt cos it was damn hot!...den this "auntie" wearing glasses driving this really old brown honda car horned and smiled at me...i was like what the hell? Then i posed and threw the horns and her...and continued...heh, i cant say that i was walking or running, so yeah, i was just travelling in between that pace, avoiding that...er...woman. yah. Played round after round of winning eleven followed by iron man xo in heavy metal den winning eleven again, and we didnt know where to go after that. Took us around half and hour to decide, funan it was, den we album surfed and sat down for some desserts and soda at raffles city. Went home relatively early yesterday...daniel took a cab with kel and i waiting for like half and hour for my sis to come, she was sending me home with her group of friends...i was how should i put it, scared? when i was inside because judging from the way shes driving...really, we can get a accident any moment. Reached home, used the computer for a while...and den poof, went to sleep, was really tired cos i woke up at 8.30, dont know why. o well, i talk too much. thats all, ciaooooo O_o.

      Weird day today...had the first 4 periods free...listened to plenty of motley crue...damn happening! Then at recess, i went to the library to talk to kel and ryan....talking abt ragnarok den suddenly...haha there was a drop of blood on the table...i was like..what the hell? it was then when i realised that my nose was like, bleeding! Quickly took tissue and held it...went to the toilet where i washed my nose in the basin...then more came out and den i decided to sit on the toilet bowl inside one of the cubicles and tilt my head to rest....stayed there for like 20 mins till kel came down with more tissue....thank god cos i was running out of them..i was like thinking...did i see something wrong? Then i went to the teachers office, wanting to get an early dismissal form...Mr teng asked me to sit at the lounge and helped me by doing some weird treatments with cold water, did help...Mrs ng called my dad and yeah, he came....den we left for changi general hospital...went to see the doctor there and all he said was, "Nothing serious". I didnt even get medicine. Just an MC for today. Yeah, nothing serious, when i went home i got a bloody headache + a bonus, fever. This proves how much CGH blows.

      hello...so bored now...hai...today was an ok day, i didnt feel sleepy in school, even though i slept at 3am. Before that i felt that i had to do something for her, to show her how much i care, and poof. I gave her a jar of candies today with a note...i really don't know what will happen if she tells her mum, she seems to be very stressed over it...its worrying me too. But i really don't want to part with her, but if there is really no way out, then we just have to do the obvious, which i don't really want to say it out here. Although i know that her mum is strictly against the idea, i have this constant thought that everything will be ok, and i feel confident that it'll work out. I don't know why i feel so positive, power of love? heh. She doesnt seem to want to talk about it...buts its ok with me.  Ah...feel abit sad now, so heres a lyric to leave you with, its also by a hair metal group called skid row. Heres to you, hui.  "together we stand, well its just you and me,so baby hold on and you'll see. Forever we stand, and we'll make it through, cos i know i can't live without you."

      Heheh...happy happy...it finally came true! What was thought to be impossible became possible. Thanks hui, you really made my past few days brighter. Neehows did a whole lot of nothing yesterday and today, stayed at home and stuff like that. We had a bbq 2 days back, man it was smashing! Many turned up, and i got Mrs Pereira to throw up the horns. Heh. Disappointing, Rebecca didnt come even though this bbq was set for her...she chose to go out with her other friends. DOH. No wonder she had to come over to chaichee, she probaly thinks that we are too low class for her or something. After everyone left, it was eden, me, jonathan, c.k and kel left. We ate like dogs, cleared the chicken wings and satays...very fun, should have more of these. I took out 4 cans of Barons and 2 shots of vodka ice...felt a little high, kel took 7 barons, he was still going on strong. But when we reached his house we couldnt sleep and i ended up snoozing at about 6am. The hell? But it was worth it. Anyway, hope u can make it for the date tml hui!

Shouldnt have went, but, had to run an errand. Spent 20 mins on a wild goose chase for the classroom key...den played a little bball. Ate a long johns...till 12...msged hui, but she didnt reply. O_o. Was a little late already, so i had nothing to do, just sit around to wait for her reply. haha i was damn sian, so i decided to call her to wake her up, but no answer too, so i went over, thinking that if i rang her doorbell i could pass the book over to her mum or bro or something. Thank god when i rang her house, she answered. DOH! Going out with family later, shopping. Doh, but hey, at least its better den staying at home?!

      Hey2, im in the click centre now again, though i'd come here to write an entry...about yesterday...yeah it was half day at school...i went to have lunch with my bros...there was something that happened there that disturbed me though, but ah, i'll just forget about it. Hmm..then i went to Funan to get albums with kel and went for a haircut at the same time...i tried the "student" haircut for fun, which was like, dirt cheap, 5.95. But it was really a budget haircut, i had to sit there and wait for 10 mins and the hairstylist didnt know what she was doing...she had to stop and ask her superior every 10 secs on instructions. I really got pissed off, wanted to leave just like that, but nah, since im so kind-hearted i just told her that im late for a tution class. Then i left and went to orchard to get a proper one...went for sushi after, stuff myself with seafood and rice. DOH. Oh yeah i bought gengs present...well, todays his birthday so...yeah...ciao.

      Yes, its 11.56 and im soo bored. Cant log on to the MU server cos its full, its always full. Sheesh. Neeways went to kels house yesterday and joined ryan, geng and eden...played like crazy and went to mac to eat...geng's dad called me saying that why didnt he pick up the phone..he called 6 times..i said i didnt know so i asked geng to call him...den he called, and had a quarrel with his dad...den his dad got pissed and asked him not to come home...i called his dad hoping to solve things out and the father shouted at me. I was like...the hell? He said that i influenced him to go out and everything...i feel damn angry...i didnt even call him to go out...he was the one who called kelvin and asked him whether he could go over to his place. Then he told his father that he was at my house...hes using me like a shield...and i get blamed. This is not the first time...his dad called the other time and geng wasnt at my house...i was like, doing my homework around 10.30 on a sunday night and his dad said i was sort of lying cos he didnt believe that geng wasnt at my house. His mum oso, when i watching a movie, she called me like 17 times and heard my voicemail over and over again and she said i didnt want to pick up the phone and i was playing around with her...she scolded me and asked me to let geng go home. He said he could watch the movie and come home late...i took his word for it. I didnt even force him or anything, hell, i didnt even ask him to watch the movie with me. ++ his mum oso said that i was a bad influence and an ah beng b'cos she saw me with a guy with DYED HAIR (sisters ex-bf). She thinks that as long as u dye ur hair ur ah beng. Really damn angry sia...doh! Nvm dun talk about this...hey2...i miss you hui! hope ur doing better den me over there...kk ciaooo O_o

Settled the bbq thingy today...had emaths test which i didnt even understand what the questions were asking for...after that i went for clb...had a test, reached there at 3.45, left at 4. The test was okay...not very easy either, but i was in a hurry to finish it so i sorta randomed everything. Heh, o yeah, didnt meet stanley there this week, maybe next week cos he has sports day heats. O well...here i am now...  I promise you this. one day you'll walk into the tattoo shop of your life and say "I'm back. Im ready for my new tattoo. and her name is rock and roll.now its time to make it permanent." You will have been thru all the temporary 15 minutes of flash. You will have come to realize that you've been being served fast food music and disposable heroes so long you've somehow forgotten what is real and what is not. and you know what the man beind the counter will say?

Which is impossible, thus comes fourth the meaning, impossible to pass my chemistry paper. ok, i feel like writing something long today cos i feel a little shitty and moody guess cos of the surprise tution i had. BAH. ok, at the count of 3, thou shall talk about what happened in my life today. then thou shall count to the  number three. three shall be the number thou shall count to and the number that thou shall count to will be three. thou shall not count to the number 4 as it is pass the third number which is the number three. 5 is right out. Once the number 3 being the third number is reached, then thou shall talk about the happenings of today, not tomorrow, not yesterday, and not the day after. haha ok ok...hmm...i went to send hui home...den i slept at 1.30 and woke up at 6.30...doh...now doing nothing...tml will be so sian...doh..kk ciao

      i thought i'd write a blog entry before i die tml. its combined science. I have to cover almost two whole books, one physics and one chemistry. Im sort of done with physics already, but i didnt memorise anything, just browsed through...im really screwed this time. Now im left with chemistry. The whole book. Im sick of this, i think i'll just leave things as they are, and go to sleep now, waking up tommorrow thinking everything will be ok. good nite.

      nothing much to write these few days...damn sian. Hmm...yesterday i stayed in school till 6 plus...waited for hui cos she had cheerleading...almost got locked in class! i taught her a maths too, at first i didnt know how to do at all...den i learnt all that in 5 mins lol...den i the end today a maths test i knew how to do haha...ouch i cant type properly now...my fingers hurt...the bloody guitar...been training to play for her lol...cos i saw what one of her close friends wrote...eh "guys who dont play guitar are not much of a guy" or something likedat...but it meaning's the same...so better play guitar. Actually when i was younger, if i had a choice, i would choose to learn the guitar instead of drums...but too bad..took up drumming le...nvm still got time to play lil bit of guitar jah...just hanged down from talking to her...a little sleepy now. Theres a physics test tml...sian. Hmm...what else can i comment on? O ya, i didnt write what happened today ah. Okay, like every other schooling thursday, it sucked. 4 periods of science crammed up. Sheesh. Damn stressful. But i skipped clb! yay!! cos i had "heats" haha. Erm...den i went to the library...we were making a little bit of noise, ok maybe quite loud la...in the click centre cos all of us were laughing and sort. Then the female librarians, who were same rank as us, Eline and Yun Yann go and like, cannot use bad word so...er...not happy with us. ah...Den dunno say what if we dont stop she will throw chair over...den like threaten us and eden, even though me and ryan were the same rank with her and eden was of a higher rank. Eh but dunno why eden was scared. Just because of a little bit of noise den they not happy and scold somemore, den give those type of face...see already really wanna slap lor. Den i was like, sitting at the far end at the com lab, com no.3, the one that i always use...i was like trying out the guitar notes on the internet, try my fingering, i never even strum, never even pluck, no noise. I just move my fingers nia...den Eline told Yun Ying to tell me say that if i dont stop playing it she will throw my guitar. I was like what the hell? im not even making any noise lor. Shit i was damn angry, but i didnt say anything but put my guitar down. I feel damn disrespected lor, they younger den us, somemore rank same as me, still say these sort of things, they dont even give me face...tsk, some girls really damn slappable. In the end the Eline cry, i was like, cry la, we wont even bother, you want us to pity u? PUI! lol. Sheesh. Luckily i learnt how to control my temper, or else i go straight up to her and shout le. You look at her face got those type of proud proud look. Cos her sister was a library head before, den she think she has foundation she got power. Tsk. I don't understand why people like them have to make the library so "not-fun" and boring. Eden and Jonathan oso. I mean like, if you are so strict even when theres no teacher around, who would want to come to the library? For me, every friday i just let my juniors shelf all the books, den finish le they can chit chat, but must walk around and chit chat...lol..cannot stand in one corner. Then the person in charge of the click centre just have to make sure that no one is turning on the volume too loud...if hes playing game or anything just let him play, dun care. I mean, this is what the library is about, what are the computers in the click centre for? Just school work? Or friendster? If that is so, it will be a waste, i dont understand why they dont allow them to play games. If you expect people to give u face, u must also spare a thought for them what, if they are enjoying themselves although they broke the rules but they are not harming or disturbing anyone, why not man? I may seem selfish here, but if u think about it, it will at least make a little sense.

      gym class sucks. spent two hours in the gym with my dad, runnning wild on treadmills, lifting countless weights and doing an uncountable number of stomach crunches and body stretches. i could just collaspe on the floor now and not move. so tired, wondering whether to go over to kels place. the worst part was after gym, we had to "gallavant" for another 3 hours or so till 2.30 cos my dad wanted to fetch my sis from school. we went for lunch and went to the supermarket. i had to drag myself in and out of the car, literally. the only part i enjoyed was when my dad let me pick a drink - i couldnt find barcardi rum, so i had to do with vodka venom. uh, in fact i think i need it now. oh? hui u got a toothache? um..get well soon. ima off, to do..uh...lie down.

      sheesh, ima so tired, guess i go sleep after this post. Hmm...woke up at 3am in the morning because of the loud noize that was coming from the hall. my dad was screaming the shit out of my sis and vice versa. i have to idea what they were going on about but i sure heard a stream of vulgarities and dialects. i heard things getting smashed, and i smelt perfume, which i later found out that a bottle of it broke, cos my dad threw my sis's handbag, chasing her out of the house. my maid told me i missed an interesting drama show, she said that my sis took a knife from the kitchen and told my pop to stay away from her while she left. interesting life huh? i've got a screwed up family, thank god im not :P. hmmm...now my sis is in her room with her friend sleeping with the door closed, my dad is in his room doing god knows what, with the door closed, and im in my room writing this, with my door closed. wondered how did she come back? its raining now, i woke up at 7.10 in the morning, had to go for clb which in the end did not exist at all. damn jeremy fooled all of us. wasted trip. so we ended up chating at macs and waited till 10am before getting breakfast and heading over to her place. when i was heading home after dropping off breakfast, i did some thinking with the coffee. i vowed never to chase my kid out of the house, scold him because he is not academically inclined and take away his freedom. his? hmm...yep, his, cos i hope it would'nt be a girl. :D. Oh yeah, for you guys who don't really know me that well, my dad is 62 and he, i believe and that my mum,sis and maid believe, is getting more and more crazy day by day ; suffering from one of those side effects of ageing. ima from a single parent family, and i live in the ghettos of inserttherandomstateorstreetorcountryname. the pic above is a pic of my dad, when he was young, does kinda bear a strange resemblence to me huh. oh, its raining now, my lunch is ready, maybe if im really bored later i'll come up with drawing or something. hmm.

      what a tiring day~. we had art right through the afternoon. DOH! and i waited two and half hours to do my bloody presentation and that botak just said, "im not awake right now, i cant think." then he ended the whole thing and told the rest to come back another day. what a jackass. when i came home, i dozed off straight away after a bath right through the night!!! now its 2.55am. shit, i overslept, forgetting to call hui too. and what a coincidence, right on the very night she posted "wat a girl wants....hehe"...and i have already broken a few. kk, let me list out the things i have or havent done. bah!  1. Guys should NEVER make a Girl WAIT... (sorry!! 45mins at mrt station)  2. Guys should be MORE sensitive to a girl's  feelings.. (trying to be...) 3. Guys should ALWAYS BE THERE for their GF.. (ok~)  4. Guys should ALWAYS be the BEST in everything..  So that the Girl can learn from u.. Yet DUn be  TOoo Arrogant... (um...always the best in everything? academically? no...) 5. Guys should MAKE DECISIONS... Not say " dunno  lar.. or anithing larz.." Girls like guys who  can make decisions.. whether is where to eat or  go or do.. Bleahz~~ (hahaha!!, eheh ok ok.)  6. Guys should be SMART, Quickwilled and  STRONGWILLED.. (ok, this one is abit hard to achieve) 7. Guys should never give excuses like  - SOrry I fell asleep.. (whoops!) - Sorry I was caught in a jam..  - Sorry my hp went Low..  - Opps.. I didn't know that..  - Oh i forgot...  8. Guys should Never use phrases like  - ya not angry r u? (when its OBVIOUSLY she is..) [ok ook!] - I dun like it.. ( when u haven't even try )  - I dun like them ( when u haven't even met  them )  9. Guys should NEVER be GAYS... [heh...kk start frm tml.:P] 10.  Guys should Learn to behave themselves at times.. (eh?) 11. Guys should Never force their GF to do anithing  they dun want.. (whoops.....) 12. Guys should always FEEL like a girl when guys r  wif their GF.. Girls like guys who can be their  bestfriend too.. Understanding.. etc..  (hmmm....) 13. Guys should NEVER always expect a GIRL to tell  them WAT THEY DID WRONG.. when EVERYTHING was  WRONG... (okay...)  i broke half of them already. im an eediut.

      here i am sitting in front of my computer at 1pm on a sunny tuesday afternoon. im supposed to reach school at 2.15. Why am i not sleeping? well i'd tell you why. i came back home bout 11pm. had a shower and did a few of my daily stuff like read the papers and shit like that. then i went on to watch bowling for columbine again and laid down on my bed facing my com screen. it was a dvd so i skippped scenes and went on to the 2nd half of the show. i dozed off as i intended to and i had this dream of ryan singing this song which has the word "bowling" in it. It got very irritating cos he kept repeating the line over and over again. he suddenly chased me and his pants fell, and i woke up. I then realised that the song ryan was singing could be heard out of my com speakers, (cos when u know a dvd ends, it always appears at the main screen, usuallly with a 5s song accompanying it, which keeps on repeating). Ah shit, then i looked at the clock, and say the long hand strike the number 10, sheesh, i was late! i rushed over to take a quick shower, putting my uniform and that was when i took a look at the clock again, it was just 12.55pm. uber pissed. and stupid. oh wait, thats not all, so i thought, ah screw it, might as well eat lunch, when i was taking my plate servings, i spilled noodle and just when i finished cleaning the mess up, my fork fell, hit the edge of the table, did a triple somesault in the air before landing straight down onto my toe. Yes, i accidentally pierced my toe with a fork. there was blood too. while walking to my room i fucked up my ankle and it hurts when i walk now. ah shit, hahaha what a day, hahahaha. I'm an idiot.

O yea, i'm planning tell all my bros bout my blog and some of my close friends. So yeah, if anyone of you knows this site, keep it low.

      ok...im suddenly in the mood to write. i just paused the show i was watching just to come all the way here to make a damned blog post. Yep, i'm watching Bowling for Columbine for the second time now, even though my dad said it was dull, and i could tell by kel's expression that he was a little bored watching it. I don't know, but i kinda like that show, its not the usual films i'd usually watch, something knew. Hmm...i went to kels house today, didnt watch Shrek again like i planned to. I REALLY WANNA GO WATCH THAT SHOW! but too bad you guys are having your Os next mon. Ah shit. The mood has just died out, i dont feel like blogging anymore. God dammit i hate this. BLEAH.

      i hate it when i have something i cant delete. Like, my dad or internet pop-ups. Theres this blue toolbar which i cant seem to get rid of, its at the top of my internet explorer. It goes really random, from gardening to horse cock. i went to kels blog just now ( yes i read it mate ) and i see "teen porn" on the top. And when i take it away it keeps coming back on the next load. Sheet, ad aware helps, for a day. It keeps coming back. Yepp neeways its 11.20am in the morning on a MONDAY and im at home listening to dragonforce while others are in school. CLB rawks. Ah shit, my dad just called and he asked me to study, maybe i'll go to watch Shrek 2 later, anyone wants to go? lol :D~~ bored, go study le...ciao!

Have nothing to do now. i woke up today, and went online for a while, what am i saying, im always online. and zen i went to fareast for a haircut which looks uber weird. Orchards are so crowded with teenagers nowadays, should'nt you people be studying for the upcoming chinese Os! doh. I couldnt even find a seat to grab a bite. So i resorted to coffee. After which i went to play soccer with my estate mates, came back home, studied, and now im here. Super bored. Maybe i'll go watch a movie or go kayaking tml, any takers? o yeah, im not grounded anymore. \m/ cheers.

      so tired, and full. Just finished dinner ( two plates of rice! my god). I didnt eat lunch today cos i had the interhouse soccer thing at 2.30. In the morning i had a leg injury, my ankle was messed up when i was walking to school, but still, i went for P.E! lol..when everyone was in chinese and malay. hahahah! shiok. Den after we had a few free periods, den chemo den another free period for me. Had interhouse after school today, i was reluctant to go, as i managed to escape from playing soccer under Topaz. Budden Danny said he needed players, and since i was doing nothing on that day, i could'nt say no. Yes, and i made a fool out of myself on the pitch. Hmm...i didnt play soccer for such a long time, i've lost my touch. I played 3 matches outta 4. In total i made 3 dribbles, 1 assist to goal, one goal attempt which was saved by the keeper unfortunatley, and around 10-20 passes and clearances, yeah, throughout the 2nd and 3rd match, my ankle was hurting like crazy, but i continued playing. When Yg and Mitch asked me why i took off right boot, i just told them it was too tight. Hehe, im looking at it now, and its swollen, it'll be ok soon i hope, :P. The purple house, which was the one i was playing for, lost all 4 matches, lol we were the lousiest. Sapphire won 3 and drawed one, head to head with house Topaz which had the same scores. The rest all no hope ba. Hahaha, i really did badly in soccer today, so i hope if there is badminton, i can reclaim my honour. Kekeke. So tiring...i didnt bring my hp to school, so when i was sitting at the bus stop i though, hey maybe i should borrows someone's phone to get my dad to pick me up..den i saw roy, he was smoking...den i asked him, "hey, did you bring your phone? can lend me make a phone call?" den he searched his pockets, and he didnt find him, den he panicked lol..den he threw his bag down and got me to hold his cigarette. I was like abit scared, cos later ppl tot i smoking, somemore im in sch u and hes not. So i hid the cigarette haha...den he ransacked his bag...couldnt find it, so he ran back to school and ran back out. Like a mouse likedat. In the end, it was in his bag all along. The best part was, it had no batt. So i had to walk all the way home. Shit. Nvm, i don't need to go school at 7 tml, reach around 10.30 - 11. hehehe! \m/

      hi. when i went to school this morning felt damn moody. so i plugged into my music and was getting ready for a day of shitty school. when i was in my dad's car i saw ryan together with yy across the road, i dunno why, but i felt much happier after. Serious. 4 periods of chinese, again. Talk cock the usual, its starting to get boring though. I went down to ask Mr Teng for my chinese results, and i bumped into grace's good friend from 5n1, dunno whats her name. She asked me, "eh? why are you here? i tot u don't need to come to school till 10.30?" i replied, "huh? can meh?" she said, "yah..the people in my class didn't come to school, they're coming at 10.30, Mdm Ong said they could." So i asked Mr Teng whether i could come to school at 10.30 tml, and he said, ok, check with mrs pereira (of course he spoke in chinese, i shall not attempt to hanyupinize). So i checked with her during recess and she said, ok, tell Natasha too. Den after school during art, shawn came to look for me and we had to go see Mr Ong, and i almost got into trouble cos Mdm Ong said she didnt let the 5n1 go early, and she gave me that bitchy look omg i feel like slapping her face. In the end, the whole thing turned from a mole hill into a moutain, and we took like half an hour to solve it. In the end, Mr Ong said, ok we will come to the decision tml. doh...well, i hope i can come late on thursday and fri. that would be \m/. Ryan was supposed to go out with yy after art, i dont know what happened, ryan didnt say, so i'll just leave things as it is. no touchy touchy jah? neehows, i went for lunch with eden and jon at bayshore, tok cok, did some stupid things which were quite fun actually. Oh yeah, i owned someone of msn yesterday, she added me with the add, mashimaro something. and she asked me who am i. god i hate these people. so heres the entire convo.  Her : ELOX crüe: hi.. Her : u r... crüe: u are? crüe: u added me Her : izzit Her : u noe fabin ziit Her : fabian* crüe: erm..jah Her : ??? Her : wad ya mean crüe: yah Her : ???

Her : haahx Her : then wad Her : i noe Her : a pic crüe: of course its a pic, why the hell would it be doing there Her : heez Her : i made a gd guess crüe: er..no. crüe: what you did was nothing but to state and restate the obvious Her : thx Her : i noe Her : hahax Her : so wad izzit crüe: its a picture of an overdelayed and overgrown stomachache accompanied by a severe symptom of catastropic dierroea. Forming an unbalanced equation to decide whether its a series of pechydermic organism emerging from what you commonly call, your anus.  crüe: \m/ 1/10 owned. Her : o_o Her : :D crüe: if you are trying to type something crüe: do it. Her : ER crüe: if not, don't bother starting at all. Her : ER Her : ER Her : ER Her : how bout ering Her : okie Her : straight to e pnt Her : can gimme that cute pic Her : jaja crüe: why do you want it? do have a specific reason? you come here without reason or why, don't say chance.

      there are certain times in your life when u start to feel that everything is going upwards, the way your parents treat you, the way your education is working out, the way your friendship is going and the way your love is blossoms. i have felt all of that in the past few months, everything was so much brighter, so positive, so happy. its hard to take it when everything suddenly plunges down, like a jerk. All that positiveness seems to be washed away. the worst part is there is nothing you can do about it. whatever you say, whatever you do, it may help a little, but there is always a scar. Simple things became complicated, and complicated things became even more complicated. just like albert einstein, he came up with dozens of mathematical formulas and theories, but he didnt know how to tie his shoelace. the old always say, take the bull by the horns, or bite the bullet or to other sayings like, once you fall off your horse, get back up. i analysed the latter, and realised that even if you fall off your horse and get back up, you will still feel the shock and the pain when you continue riding till for a while later, till the pain subsides. I'm trying my very best to cope with the pain, and someday its going to go out of control and i'll just break down. i've tried very hard to make the relationship work, hiding the way i feel sometimes, and usually it gets better after a while. i have sacrificed time, sweat and tears. if you try walking a down the road, in a straight line, you will soon fall out of line, and the line will be crooked. If you are reading this, noone can walk a straight line alone without a line of the floor to follow. everyone needs something to follow, a guideline to trail.

      Something happened yesterday night, and i did something wrong. I thought everything was ok. Till in school today. I tried to start a conversation with hui, no reply. O wait, where was something...uh...like, no, nothing...i thought something wasnt right, but i didnt suspect neething nonetheless. Later i called out to her, tapped on her chair a few times, no reaction, she didnt even budge, let alone answer. So i thought to myself ok, shes pissed. At what? I spent the rest of the day thinking, till it came to the last 2 periods, i tried to talk to her again, and there was a reply, maybe a small conversation, with bored replys, and the thing was when she talked to jonathan, she immediately laughed and seem very cheerful...ok, shes pissed. At what? i have done something that hurt her without knowing it, or even i know it, i forgot maybe? I tried to make it up, to have a clearer view of everything, to actually know whats going on, so i asked her whether she was free after school to stay back to chat, i got a "hmm maybe" so i thought, ok, at least i will get to know whats happening. At the dismisal bell, i packed my stuff and sat at my seat, waiting...and i saw her pack and leave, walking out of the class just like that, and she didnt even glance over...ok, i must have done something really bad, because we have never been on ends with each other for so long. I got a little agitated and very disturbed so i sent her an sms, "I guess you're still angry and you don't want to solve it."...no reply. This is what i inferred from her blog.  "yester nite started off wif pb...i wasnt angry juz feel that wat for u give in 2 me...ya u explain 2 me,i accepted it n understand but then i found out someth else...i wun be bother 2 tell u or wat,cuz i feel that u shld actually noe it lorx.....i m this kind,u can say i dun want solve it...then let it be la... "   Ok, i understand why u cant be bothered to tell me, because if someone does something wrong, he should be able to realise what he has done wrongly right? I guess its really my fault now, cos i have no clue of what i did. But i must have done something wrong. So please, if you have heart for forgiveness, i'm asking it from you dearly, please, enlighten me and show my flaws. For i'm lost. If you are reading this, if under that anger you could just squeeze a little bit of symphathy, please feel free to express yourself by smsing or calling me. I don't mind if its harsh, just so that i can at least hear from you, is what keeps me going on every, single, day. Because, i love you, even more today that yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow.

      just came back...so tired....lemme talk about yesterday first cos i didnt have time to post a blog due to the famous sydrome called, LAZYNESS. hmm...i went for a maths in the morning...finished the paper way before anyone else did, 1hr before time. Had no mood to do it, i was physically and mentally tired then, but i could get myself to sleep...so i doodled to pass time. After which i went home for a little nap before eden popped over to wake me up from my nirvana, and we left...it was drizzling. and for no apparant reason, my nose started bleeding. Bloody hell, this is the second nosebleed i had this year since.....ages. i think its because of those sleepless nights and heatyness, maybe i haven been eating well, as in, fried, oily, fattening and high-colestrol stuff. We went to pick up jonathan from the school in a cab and headed for kels place. Went there, did the usually, played games and tok cok, usually i'm always the one watching them play some fighting game whatsoever, and when its my turn to play, i'll always load in the same game all over and over again, which is winning eleven 7 (soccer game dear). i got bored and wanted to go meet u in katong, miss u too much ya...haha. moving on....hmm nonetheless after all that me and kel had a great time though...going album shopping...we found a place where they sold metal music for cheap, like, 10 bucks for every album...but they are second hand, who cares anyway? we went to delifrance for dinner and had one of the worst sandwiches we have ever eaten in our lives. DONT GO TO DELIFRANCE. I went to get a mother's day gift for my godmum, which consisted mostly food....lol, trying to give her something new rather then the old stuff toys and things which she cant put to good use, might as well give her food. So i thought about it, and the word food hamper popped right out of my ears into my head. We had trouble finding a cab at night...waiting for about an hour and still no luck. And its irritating to see that a guy just walks across the road, raises his hand for less than a min, and a taxi comes by to pick him up, whereas two teenagers on the other side of the road, who have been standing there an hour ago still hasnt got one. So i took the last choice, call my sister and i got her to pick me and kel up....hmm...thats all about yesterday...its 6.48 now and i have been writing this long blog entry since 6.00. I think its time to stop and continue later about what happened today..going for dinner...ciao!

      heyya...its a maths tml i have no mood to study already...just finished writing a compo...one of my masterpieces! Hope you like it.  time. 9.50pm Hi, my name is terence. is it weird for your dog to sit on your lap when you are only  wearing your underwear? i guess so, time to get off hotrod.   I own a gentlemen's club called Tj's. i am the relations manager, road girls show up on  Mondays and say hello to me, because I’m the guy you check-in with, if you’re a road girl,  on Mondays. Any sexual excitement I get anymore in this job comes from the road girls.  It goes like this: I’m a guy, and on a boring Monday afternoon, A 20-year old blonde comes  into the office, shakes my hand and introduces herself, and in one hour I will see her  breasts, for free. Many guys think that i have the luckiest job in the world,  lemme share with you the insides of the job. The dancers stand in the DJ booth naked,  they bitch at me because I screwed their schedule naked, they order food at my desk naked,  they use my phone naked, they come in the office and tell me the toilet has broken down  naked, they sit across my desk and cry because their boyfriend is a jackass naked.  I can’t look anymore! I’ve seen too much! I know every mole, every scar, every birthmark,  every nipple, I know if a dancer has put on 5 pounds.  I have 5 other people managing the place for me.   Daniels my bouncer. Hes 50 years old. He is rather huge and owns a ponytail and mustache.  He’s wiry and strong. He was in the military and knows martial arts. He doesnt like to  fight and he knows how to avoid one. As he says, “Don’t ever fight a guy you don’t know  unless you absolutely have to. You never know what he knows, or what he’s capable of…or  what he has in his pocket.” Dan removes unruly customers quicker and more efficiently  than anyone else in the club legally. illegally, well, ryan holds the torch.  Ryans a contractor and I once destroyed his bicycle. He’s a huge guy,with a mustache,  long brown hair. He once touched me some way and it was so quick. Tap, and I dropped  to one knee from the pain. I learned the hard way that, when you’re very drunk at 3:00 am,  going really fast down a hill on Ryan's bicycle is not the smartest thing to be doing.  I nearly lost an arm, not to the crash, but to him.    Eden looks kind of like Jackie Chan same hair, similar face, same build.  He was the victim of a burn accident that I think won him a bunch of money  in a lawsuit. His hands and forearms are badly scarred, his hands are almost  unusable. When he flicks you, it’s the best he can do with three fused fingers.  He calls it the “trio-bird”. I love the trio-bird. Sometimes when somebody says  something stupid, I nod over at Eden and he pops the trio-bird like he’s offering them a  cigarette.    Jonathan looks like Jonathan. He sells and services video games and juke boxes and pool  tables (including ours). He also doesn’t drink. Hes in love with one of the dancers,  Bulldog(she’s one of our veteran dancers who was here long before I started). He’s not  gross about it, though. Shes is very nice to him and doesn’t take advantage of the fact  that he would give his life for her. They’re good friends, but it’s the definition of  an unrequited love.   Kelvins a male stripper.He has a reputation for dressing up like a construction worker  or a fireman. He dances to songs from Burzum or Impaled. The fireman costume has a huge  length of actual firehose that he stuffs with something to make it rigid. He would then  swing the hose and dangle it out over the crowd and all the women would scream and try to  grab it. He was always careful not to let any of the women get hold of it, i saw it once.  His hose dropped about halfway out and started to dip down towards the crowd. Before he  could pull it in, one of the women grabbed it and it was all over. It just disappeared  into this screaming group of women and nobody ever saw it again. We did find out later  that he packed it with the Styrofoam peanuts.  Ok, im tired. I just finished a game of tug-of war with a few buds of mine using dildos  the size of my arm. Time of completion. 11.03pm  sorry ah hui if i woke u up...love ya! muacks.

      i don't know. i've been feeling very weird these few days. i don't know whether its happiness or saddness. its sort of a carefree and light feeling. and i like it. but this comes with a series of bad dreams - ive been dreaming about deaths,sucides and pain(emotional and physical), some involving family,brothers and hui. hope none comes true hm? so, yesterday. i stayed over at kels place on thursday to watch england vs portugal on friday morning. sheng hao, eden and ryan were there too. the usual, ryan and eden fell asleep, shenghao fell asleep halfway, kel was trying to fall asleep, and i was trying to see portugal score. when they did in the second half, i shouted and well, eden,shenghao and kel woke up. ryan was just lying there like a log, occasionally making moans and groans like he was a feminine pornstar or something. well. It was portugal that won! yeaahhh. simao rocks, and so does his hair heh. i slept at around 6am and woke up at 12, ate chicken rice which had kickass packaging. took a bath, changed, and went to pick hui up. i had a bloody flu. the usual, we went to jalan jalan. my flu got worse after a haircut, bought some medication. sheesh, flu on a date, how very....memorable. thanks spc fo taking care of me yeh. heheh, after, i took her to see my mom and godmom, which was not as bad as i expected, just plenty of questions and the same answers over and over again. she came over, and i took a nap after she left. i slept and woke up in the middle of the night and used the computer, humming to the stokes...talking to her. slept at around, i dont know mate. so here i am in the morning, with my wrists and fingers swollen and puffy. morning blues. meh. Panadol Cold Relief, non drowsy formula. 20 caplets. wonder what if i took 12 in one shot. oh yeah, i rememebered what my dad said after he watched the passion of christ. it was something like... "this may sound blasphemous, but i think jesus is a conman."    damn.

      okok before i leave for malaysia i better make a quick update, so here i am sitting naked in my room typing this blogspot entry early on a tuesday morning. LAST WEEK OF THE JUNE HOLS. i went to orchard and brought ryan to cut his hair, which was damn kickass and nice. but unfortunately, being the old-fashioned self he already is, he didnt liked it very much and commented on it in front of the stylist, saying "it sucks". omg felt so embarrassed. but ahh, brother la. that will be the last time i'll bring an indonesian for a haircut. YES THAT WAS RACIST. heh. i sat around after that and waited for my dumb sis to meet me, who was still at the house doing her stuff at 6.30. so i left for the funeral (yes another one of grandmother's sister died). it was my 2nd time going there, 1st time on mrt/bus. when i reached Kovan station through the LRT, i took bus number 112. i was told to look out for xinmin primary school which i thought was "sing ming". okay. so i sat the bus foolishly, and waited and waited till i reached hougang bus interchange (what the hell). yeah i got lost. being the stubborn person i was and not wanted to "lose" to directions, i treked all the way back to blk 500++ from blk 200++. (the blk was supposed to go to was 645) and my godmum was worried and so was my mom, and so the many people whom they told there that i was lost, random uncle/aunties #2418-7859. they kept calling and told me to take a cab. so i thought, ah screw it. i hailed for one and got there, which i later realised was just a few more blocks away. taxi fare showed it all. dammit. ok, my first step into the funeral was accompanied by hundreds of questions and people wiping my face with tissue, and my second step was accompanied by another bunch of questions, this time with people fanning me and lifting my shirt in an up and down motion. so when i finally took a seat and settled down with a calsberg, i had to answer to question like, 1. hows your studies? 2. how old are you? 3. why are u so skinny? 4. i heard you have a girlfriend? 5. show her picture... 6. hows your dad? 7. hows school and yada yada, all in hokkien of course. and once i showed them the picture of hui, all of them were like, "aiyoh ah boy ah, li gai char bo peng you si bei knia leh!!" which means, "aye boy, your girlfriend is very pretty". well, of course. shes my girlfriend ain't it. heh, EEEEGGGGOOOO. okok my dads nagging at me, write another when i return.

DEAD. I think i let it listen to too much Dragonforce yesterday. I was starting to like it and get over the "baseball" thing (throwing the bird straight at the mirror). Ah fuck. What a day.

Its (i haven figured out whether its male or female) name is  Gucci  . Yeah, my sis named it, brah, after all it was her bf that found it flying inside his room. oh well, its yellow and has a streak of green on it. woah, today was very....fun. dunno why, me kel ryan was all in a reasonably good mood. damn right kel, should do this more often. :D. oh yeah, before i leave, a quote my dad told me today.  "if theres a problem, solve it. if you cant solve it, then theres no problem at all, why bother about it?"

      ok. haha, i had another weird dream yesterday night. " there was a group of people forced to do some chinese exam or something. Kel and Den were the two among the huge mass of others. they were surrounded by guards carrying bows equipped with toothpicks as arrows. Mr teng was there and he was the head honcho. getting weirder...i was a NINJA (WOAH!). i had to save them. (WOAH!x2). i went in there and killed some people by sneaking up on them, just like how snake does it in metal gear solid. then i got found out i think, so the whole place went beserk, people were running, and me, kel and den were punking the bad guys out. toothpicks were flying all over and i dodged them like neo in matrix. suddenly, kel and den got trapped and i had to go over and take out 20+ dudes, kicking them in the face and such. then when i went up the stairs into the building to take out two snipers at the other building, i woke up. and the weird shit of the dream was that it all took part outside kels house. DOH! " i had another dream but i forgot it. heh. ook ook, bye.

      yesterday was a rather nice day, woke up at 8 in the morning to go to school and put my canvas. after which i had breakfast at siglap, and then chemistry lesson from 11 till 1. went for lunch with a couple of friends at siglap, again. and hurried back to school. i had to pretend to paint at the hall of renaissance and take charge of the first aid post. ryan, hui and faezah were painting with me too. when the guests arrived and started pumping in questions, i overheard ryan saying, "this is my painting, its called soldiers of wasteland." i tried hard not to laugh (the title of his painting was the title of a dragonforce song). when it was my turn, mr loke was standing right behind me and he gave me a very...queer...smile.  anyway, all went well. i left early, yes i abandoned my first aid juniors even though i was instructed to stay there at all times. took a cab to pick kel up from funan and to far east, needed to cut my hair. and we went all the way to town, just to find out that the stores closed. sheesh. so we roamed around orchard, finding a place to eat. and everywhere was crowded, filled with people that all dress the same and guys that dress very very gayly. we came to a decision, parkway parade. doh! hailed for a cab and went all the way back to the east. and i was making weird noises in the cab, man this taxi driver was damn weird. he was staring at me when i made a funny noise. it was damn creepy. and we kept laughing in the cab non stop at him cos his face was damn funny when he was starring at me. i wanted to get out. i took a few snapshots of him, ill post it here as soon as i figure out how to transfer pictures to the computer. so parkway right, we ate pasta mania, which was tasteless. and walked around the place for a while. waited for a cab for about uhh...45 mins! got so bored that i kept on singing and renacting war scenes. laughed my guts out. oh well, guess it was a wild saturday. so ill have to go to colour bar at siglap to cut my hair later. DOH.

      Oooooooooohh.... its 10am in the morning. medication makes you wake up early i suppose. heh. i had a series of very very very weird dreams. i remember one, i was spiderman or something. and it had to do with a carpark...cant remember what happened&nbsp;though. so friday, i was sick like a dog, couldnt sleep, kept coughing and stuff, found it difficult to breath. so my sis asked me whether i wanted to go to a doctor, and i said ok. her bf drove us there, and the doctor was uber weird. GRACE polyclinic, any of you heard of that? i went home to eat dinner, that was around 12 i think, and the yellow flu tablets made me drowsy, so i popped straight to sleep in bed. when i woke up, i saw hui. woahh..i thought i was dreaming. real shocked to see her there. really glad she came to visit! :D :D :D. after she left, i went back to sleep till around 1, and i went to meet, yvette,cynthia, jon and hui for a movie. was supposed to be sisters, but there cineplex didnt have it so, we watched king arthur. the outfits were cool.&nbsp;but it has the same plot almost every action or war movie has. good guys = handsome young men who always win in the end. bad guys = ugly ol fags who lose their temper. but&nbsp;if&nbsp;it isnt like this,&nbsp;the audience will say its a bad movie right? so,&nbsp;yeh.&nbsp;hui was really cheerful, heheh...it was nice to see her like this. :) we went for some jap food at bedok which wasnt really that good, but&nbsp;still edilble.&nbsp;random fact #857151-8 " i&nbsp;used&nbsp;3 packs of tissue instead of the 6 i brought". all in all, im still sick. &nbsp;

      it would be to fly...cos i can get caressed by the clouds...(puts on a semi-gay face)...you know what im saying? so i started off the day with quite a hyper morning. cos i laughed the shit out of myself while reading kels blog at about 7am. why? hahaha, the way he wrote it out, it was damn funny. he got "analed" or rather, a nurse had to stuff something up his anus. hahaha. guess you aint that tight anymore mate. reached school and ate keropok. my god. had lots of them the day before at kels place. which explains my severe sore throat now. guess the huge bundle of mentos wrappers i left behind had taken effect too. WHAM!  random didyouknow fact. -  MENTOS LOWERS YOUR SPERM COUNT.  but not that i need it or anything. At the moment. doh.  so we had the usual boring ol&nbsp;friday, but no so boring at times when you're looking forward to earlier dismissal. double physics triple maths and double chemistry. bummer. yes i know. went to jam with jem and shawn. hmm, sounds catchy, jam with jem. - and i found out how much i need to work on my drums. dont look at me like that kel. drums, percussion, you know, snare, cymbals, crash, ride, bass. not my teabags goddamit. was developing a cold by then, sorry couldnt make it for lunch dan. came back, i crashed on my bed and slept till 6++...and my tutor came in my house herself, cos exodus was playing too loudly on my com and i couldnt hear the doorbell. i swear if i my legs was about 10cm more to the right "it was on the table" she could have seen my manhood. no i was wearing boxers. i didnt even know she was coming.&nbsp;but the good part was that i only had tution for an hour cos i was sneezing and sucking endlessly..........on lozenges.   i have the sudden urge to watch spiderman again.  oh yeh, before i end this post, i have to tell u guys about my dream.  i dream that i was in Natsok's (or rinchen) store with kel,&nbsp;cept it was in some ulu ulu&nbsp;shopping centre,&nbsp;*slaps&nbsp;forehead* the store is already in a&nbsp;ulu place,&nbsp;but its not the one at funan im&nbsp;sure.&nbsp;so he&nbsp;left and asked me to take charge&nbsp;of&nbsp;his store. kel&nbsp;suddenly disappeared. and i was&nbsp;selling spiderman figurines and merchandise, along with some other random&nbsp;stuff that i forgot. so i sold a&nbsp;67-point of articulation spidey to this woman, and she paid&nbsp;30 bucks for it. which i was&nbsp;proud of. and there were other people too,&nbsp;some just walking in, taking a look around,&nbsp;the occasionally&nbsp;take sweet and leave (there were&nbsp;sweets on the counter) . after that i found out that the spidey thing was worth 40 bucks, and i got like fooled. DOH~ what a weird ass dream. but it doesnt beat the one where i dream i was riding on whales. like  FREE WEINER.  i mean,  WILLY.  heh.

      heh, im at kel's place now. waiting for jonathan to fry the  "keropoks". &nbsp;school just ended about&nbsp;two&nbsp;hours ago, exhausted! had maths and english in the morning,&nbsp;and p.e, played soccer...perspired&nbsp;alot. my boxers was like all wet.&nbsp;then had physics,&nbsp;humans, chemistry followed by an amaths test which im&nbsp;so gonna flunk.&nbsp;:D.&nbsp;no worries.&nbsp;Waited for&nbsp;hui to get&nbsp;back from parkway with&nbsp;jon&nbsp;in school (going to pass her hw). oh yeh, found out its celines birthday tml! happy birthday yeh! hmm...miss my dar lots. haha, ryans here now, he didnt go to school cos he sprained his ankle by jumping barefooted, no with his socks&nbsp;from around 2.5 metres. what an idiot yes. and he was like moaning and making faces like he just got an orgasm. i didnt know whether to laugh or not, and i was controlling my laughter. damn funny the sound. seeing a big strong guy moan like this, you really feel like laughing your guts out. no shit. ahhaha. oh ill draw the illustration of his fall later when i get home.   heres a something i thought about and conjured.  A bicycle. you need to paddle on both sides for&nbsp;it to get moving smoothly. if only one side is being paddled, the bicycle can hardly move. same for love. if only one person is making an effort and showing his/her love, it'll be hard to carry on.  So for those who are attatched. do not be afraid to express yourself to your significant other. dont give up, even though you are the only one paddling, try as hard as you can. dont loose balance and fall off. it'll be hard getting back up. continue to try, keep the bicycle moving, and very soon, the other paddle will follow.~  yes im looking at you daniel, jon,ryan and gangbang. kels uhh..ok not fair, so i think of one for kel. heres to you mate. you dont necessarily need to ride a bicycle. there are so many other means of transport. MRTS, cars, vans,  lolli cia ,&nbsp;aeroplanes, helicopters, cranes, motorcycles. but if you insist on riding bicycles, there are&nbsp;many&nbsp;other types too.&nbsp;two wheeled, three wheeled, four wheeled, with or without&nbsp;extension, headlights,&nbsp;different number of gears,&nbsp;different thickness of wheels,&nbsp;different brands, with hook ons, with water&nbsp;bottle holder or without, with&nbsp;or&nbsp;without&nbsp;bell, with a scratch mark or not...and yada yada i could go on forever.  and heres to everyone.   romance is&nbsp;like&nbsp;fried rice. you must add the char&nbsp;siew la, the egg la, the&nbsp;onion la...and must fry and fry and fry.&nbsp;fire&nbsp;cannot too hot. or else ah, your romance, sure&nbsp;burn one ah! chao ta!   im fucking&nbsp;gay today eh?&nbsp;

      heh, so i just woke up, yes, i couldnt stand it. took a nap in the afternoon heh. sorry sorry hui you called me 19 times and i didnt hear it!!! ehehheh too tired i guess, but somehow i think my phone is screwed up or something. well, im looking at my soccer buddies playing now, and&nbsp;i just realised. last year, it will be all dark and stuff when its 7. now, its still so bright at 7.21. why? our world is facing drastic environmental shifts&nbsp;i think. so i was looking out the window and thinking...and suddenly i thought, "what if one day the earth stops rotating?" does that mean that time will freeze? dogs, cats and squirrels will do backfilps? horses will particpate in mass orgies? will the buildings bend and collaspe? hmm...ive did my homework, and this is what i found.  -It is thought the West Antarctic ice sheet is unlikely to  collapse this century . If it does fall apart,  sea level rises would be enormous   -Global average  temperatures are predicted to rise by between 1.4C and 5.8C by 2100   -Increasing temperatures means the World is likely to see  less frosty days and cold spells , but we are expected to experience  an increase in heat waves and hot spells   (but this is good, right? for guys cos girls....yah :D) -Greater risk of  drought  in summer in continental areas  - Hurricanes  likely to be more intense in some parts of the World due to  more rainfall and more intense winds   - It’s not clear what will happen with thunderstorms or tornadoes   -An intensification of the  Asian summer monsoon  is expected  -There is no evidence for changes in the frequency, intensity or location of  tropical storms  Storm surges  are expected to increase in frequency and in the UK the south east coast is expected to see  the largest surges at around 1.2m higher than we have now.    &nbsp;  "The Arctic is warming. Air circulation around the North Pole region has changed. It is bringing warmer, wetter winters to northern Europe, Siberia, and parts of North America. Also, a changed wind pattern is moving young Arctic ice out of the ocean faster."    &nbsp;  "Be prepared: sudden shifts in climate coming  Data from ancient tree rings and ice cores suggest Earth may soon experience intense periods of drought and cold."    &nbsp; well. scary isnt it. but i guess we would all be dead by then. or really really old. well, if you're bored and you have nothing to do, i suggest you should go and check out this website.  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/  its about leonardo da vinci, i found it interesting, will you?

      so&nbsp;i was telling myself to make a blog post yesterday. and like all times, i got lazy and stuff. saturday, went over to huis place together with grace jon and hongrui to bake cakes and make lemonade. gaud it sounds weird. well everything was cool, heh, her moms a great cook. :) - i came home&nbsp;rather wasted and everything, around 12 and i still had to finish&nbsp;up the tattoos for the next day.&nbsp;hmm...so sunday morning was rather kickass. woke up at 6.15 in the morning omg wtf and left at 6.45, heading over to her place to collect some stuff. so reached school around 7, yeh on a bloody sunday-and started messin around, principal giving speeches and awards and this wannabe rapper guy teaching us aerobics. i was selling my body......art. heh. the result was better than i expected, plenty of people asked to be drawn on heh. damn tiring~~!! so after the event we all went home, tired, sweaty and wasted. she came over and we ate lunch. i had nothing to do when she left so i went downstairs to walk around my estate, i think i walked around the tennis court for about 50 or more times heh while conjuring a poem. yes, i was bored. the weather was fine and stuff, you know those times when its windy and you see dead leaves on the floor&nbsp;twirling in circles like the motion of a tornado? yeh i saw that yesterday and it reminded me so much of my childhood.&nbsp;i used to run in them and catch as many leaves as i could with my childhood friend (yeh jack if you're reading this you should prob remember). whenever i see that, i dont know, i feel...at ease, like my mind floats away and i feel very...peaceful. call it fetish if you want but it aint giving me orgasms though. geng and kel came over at night and we did our homework, well, i did my physics (which i found out i did the wrong bloody paper and i'd have to do another one today), geng did his amaths and kel did his music.  we were doing with each other.  kidding. :D.&nbsp;oh yeah!  geng got me a bloody wireless headphone !!!!! omg! i can like take it to outside my house and still listen dragonforce playing. damn kickass! THANKS BRO!&nbsp;&nbsp;as i was saying, i cant wait to shit. (go figure). yep, and thats that for sunday. just finished school, im really tired but i dont think im going to take a nap, im deprived of sleep! had only 4 hours on sat night, 6 hours yesterday and im totally wasted. solution : good 'ol invigorating tea. damn mr loke, why didnt he grant us a half day today, so damn tired..........yadayada. i hope the soccer crowd will there here later. oh yeah and thanks to mei yin for her present! to be specific. its called MANLY MAN MAGNETS. "sturdy. studly. husky. musky. perfect for the well-HUNG fridge. (caution: objects are larger than they appear. not that it&nbsp;makes a difference or anything)&nbsp;bastard. damn funny though, it has a banna, cigar, rocket and a building of some sort. well the rockets the longest cos its 9-inch. i think mines the size of the....too much information. oh well THANKS! heh.

TIP OF THE DAY : SIM LIM SQUARE - THE CHEAPEST STUFF ARE ALWAYS ON THE LAST TWO STORIES. went to temple around bugis to pray. i had my fortune told for the first time. my wish was to score well in Os. shaked the "chopstick" thing and number 77 came out. it read BAD. so i asked the dudes outside to explain further. paid 10 bucks and he said woah it was really bad, my results will suck. (summarised) he wrote some stuff on a funny piece of paper and asked me to go to another building to pray. there i paid 3 to a woman who chanted a melody of dialects. supposedly to make my luck get better. after which we met up with ryan, went to play cs.(haven played in a looooonnggg time). saw many many many many ahs and cabs. (cab = chao ah beng). met up with the rest of the motley crue and went to catch spidey again heheheh. nice. :D. kel met up with us later cos he had to send his mom off. so we were all tired and shit, but we still went to maxwell to have supper...then dragged our half unconcious bodies back home. here i am. im a little, alright VERY bothered bout the fortune telling stuff. well, guys, if you're reading this - make a post on my tag below, what would you do if you were in my shoes? to believe, or not to believe? - going off to install flight stimulator! yay.  miss spca

      ok, this morning was weird. for the first time this year i felt damn tired and didnt feel like waking up at all. oh, i know its normal for you guys. yeh, but for me, its...weird, i mean, yeh. dunno why. anyway school was cool, everything passed very quickly. physics got shortened to one period. \m/. physics is boring. dumb shit. you know, they could combine phy, bio and chem. like this i think it'll be easier to study. all in one paper. all in one textbook. take for example - the average speed velocity of my "twanger" of diameter 6.71 inches (micrometer screw gauge acc 0.01) entering a "taco's" vulva. penetrating it and entering the cervix. consuming a time limit of d=xyz to the power of 2 dmcube. before preferentially discharging a series of cowper's gland, ionic formula of Gh07HE6Pb14. yeh. \m/. hmm...anyway, i did my shit, studied and stuff, WOAH NO SHIT FOR THE FIRST TIME. cept for chemistry. i was uhh...distracted cos uhh it was the last period. Hmm? erm...stayed back waited for hui...she came over..and lalala....ok this is continued from like 5 hours ago cos i left it on...so yeh, just came back. went to drink, with kel. i drank, uhh....ice lemon tea. and kel had barons. had manly talk..heheh. okok i'll go play grand theft auto. Hope it works and doesnt screw up like the risk2 i downloaded. BITORRENT KICKS ASS!

We were having art, and i didnt bring my canvas as usual. shit like that. mr ng started to be uber irritating, scolding student after student. when he came to sheng hao, it was rather long. he verbally insulted sheng hao's people (citizens of China Rep). which sheng hao was rather ticked off at. but he remained quiet nonetheless. mr ng got bored with him so he went on the ming jie, then started scolding the class as a whole. he slammed the door and left, came up with two beta forms. one for sheng hao and another for ming jie. sheng hao didnt want to fill it up cos he knew that he didnt do anything wrong. eric and him had a little debate and stuff, and mr ng asked, "were you polite?". and sheng hao said yes, and he said "you sure?" i butted it cos i couldnt stand it, and i said, "yeah im very sure he was because he apologised and kept quiet." unfortunately that wasnt the answer eric wanted to hear so he asked me the same quesion again for about 3 times. of which all i came up with the same answer. he got pissed and he changed his attention to me, and i got rather worked up too. he asked me to leave and i went off packing my bag. i had a piece of scrap paper on my desk so i crushed it and did what i always do, aim and throw the litter into the bin which was by the door. i missed by a few inches. eric then said, "pick it up." i replied with a yeah i'll pick it up once i leave. he shouted "PICK IT UP!" and i walked all the way there, took the bin and the rubbish. went up to him and slammed the rubbish right into the bin at his face. score. i walked out and it took him a few seconds to process what i have done. he slammed the door open and shouted at me, "you're not happy isit?". and i replied rather loudly, with a YES and some other shit which i forgot due to my STM (short term memory). he shouted, i shouted louder, he shouted again, and i shouted even louder. sheng hao came in the middle and he stopped the both of us before i would actually kick him in the face like i did to some st pats guy. once again that botak blew it, and he insulted china citizens again, and sheng hao was very pissed off, he threw a heavy punch at the door and screamed his lungs out at mr ng, with a chain of vulgarities. sweet. eric just stood there and looked up at him like a kid, (in case u outsiders dont know, my art teacher's name is mr eric ng, and hes very short). Mrs ng heard from the hall and came up to see what was going on, and she took sheng hao for a little talk. i told eric to come inside the class and he said, "why cant we talk outside here?" and i said, "why cant we fucking take a sit?". he obeyed like a little kid and we started to have a talk. he was bitching and bitching, at this time my eyes were rather watery, i was about to break down from the anger, fustration and shock. but i held my tears back, and eric had his eyes watery too, occasionally wiping a tear or two off. heh. well, everything was alright after that, but mrs ng said i still have to get punished, and i said ok. but it was all worth it. that was mainly the action that happened two days ago. now on to yesterday. hmmm...gee i forgot. all i know is that i took a nap in the afternoon. went downstairs to do a maths at night. and uhhh....yeh nothing else. im in the click centre, theres no emaths today cos most of my class are having their o level oral exams now. rather sad. waiting for jon, we're gonna collect the bro picture. yeh. \m/.

      So we went on a expedition, well not very much of one but we covered around 11 or 12 kilometers on foot? Started off at my place, with dan, ryan and kel. Walked right out and trekked behind Mandrin gardens, we went through the underpass on to east coast, stopped for a break halfway cos kel had to change his pants, then we continued…there was a fire in the forest or something, there was this fire truck and lots of smoke, and two men, I wonder what that means. So we went on till we came upon a marsh. A BLOODY DIRTY, ICKY, SQUISHY, MARSH. It was hilarious! Kel had his slipper, or rather ryans slipper stuck on the mud and he was holding on to me and laughing, trying to retrieve it and in the end both his slippers got stuck, haha we kept on laughing. Ryan was the first to get cross it cos of his weird technique of jumping from one tree root to another. Daniel was somewhere figuring out how to go cross it. Kel was the second one and the one that was most covered with mud, haha he just walked straight through it barefooted cos he said hes got nothing to lose. After a while Dan said screw it cos two dogs were advancing towards us very slowly, and they almost bit him. Heh. So he took of his shoes and socks and crossed the marsh, so did I but I kinda used ryans method - it worked! But I was till covered with shit. Thank god we found this construction workers kinda place, it had a hose in it, and a fan in the guardroom or something. I had to climb in through the window with the help of ryan and kick the door open cos it was jammed or something. We washed up and got really wasted and stuff cos we smell of mud and our shoes we soaked in it. And we were uhh..one hour behind schedule. Heheh. We took off half an hour later, walking on the highway and finally, we reached Benjamin Sheares bridge, yay! Hahah, found a nice place to sit and had our snacks and stuff, budget dinner they call it. We had very little water left and all of us were thirsty like camels, or was it just me? Hmmm….like an hour later when the sky got darker we could see the national day fireworks, together with a lot of people who came too. Heh.we left for Suntec at 8 and changed into warmer, dryer clothing. Had our dinner and watched the village. BRYCE DALLAS HOWARDS is damn pretty!! Ahhhhh. Went back after that and my legs were aching like crazy. My sis was running a high fever, so I followed her and her bf to the hospital, waiting for about 2 hours ++, thanks hui for talking to me heh. Was hungry, tired and sticky, I didn’t even take a bath yet! Doh. Reached home around 3 and I took a nice warm shower, wanted to go grab something but I was too bloody tired, collapsed in bed and had yet another weird dream that im hesitant to describe, heh, ciao.

      Sunday. so i went for a haircut at colourbar. and the dude there who was washing my hair was FREAKIN GAY! hes gayer then me, now thats gh3y! he talks like a wimp, and has large...fingers an toes. and his facial expression, boy you'll feel like slapping him. hes wearing this uber tight shirt and uber low pants exposing his black thong. yes, a thong. i mean who the hell wears a thong if hes wearing a pair of jeans? and plus, a guy? yes, i had and very direct view of his semi-covered hairy crotch. uggh. so i spent 45mins waiting there, playing a few rounds of mini golf on my phone, and 15mins getting a haircut.   conclusion : dont go to colour bar unless you want to see gay men.   so i went to kels place after, played games and stuff, we ordered kfc in the night, 15pc meal + a bottle of pepsi + 2 large whippotatoes + 2 large coldslores + 2 large popcorn chicken + 4 pies.  All that, for kel, jon, me and ryan. we didnt manage to finish of course, but all of us left with huge buldges on our stomach. i felt sick after, headache and stuff. went home, slept and woke up the next morning having a major headache. went to school nonetheless. the first half of the day was rather ok, until it came to chemo, i felt extremely cold and yada yada yada. went home, discovered i had a high fever. my head hurt like crazy. shivered like crazy at night, but i was laughing, cos it looked like i was going through cold turkey or something hahah.woke up at 3am, with my head banging inside again. i went to take my medicine and sat on the sofa till it was four, and went back to sleep. so here i am now, sitting my ass in front of the computer, feeling nauseous, and having a slight headache. mehhhhhhhh............................
