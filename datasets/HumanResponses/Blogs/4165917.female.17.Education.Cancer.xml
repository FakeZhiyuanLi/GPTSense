       Haha as it wrote on d tittle, well i'm  NOT  goin to  STEAL  or anythin like dat. I'm thinkin of groupin peoples wif extraordinary talent and people who likes to do sumthin kewl or who eva wants to join ur welcome too.       I'm groupin people, from hackers, stealers, masterplanners, gadget collectors or maker, comp freaks, people who knos history and world facts, knows bout stuff meaning people wif loads of info or people who likes to read (anythin). These group of people usually use their talent on the wrong side. Basically, i want to group people like dis coz im like dem. We talk and discuss things, learn from each other, join competition and stuff and knowing more people like us!      People who likes mystery and psychology stuff is also welcome. So far i have a few group members. Again I like to say, this group is not illegal. = ) but serious though. Ju z joinin peoples. dats it. So maybe wen there r gatherin we can hv a damn gr8 time!

       Only 86 days left before my BIG exam day.  Until now, i hvn't regained my old self back. It had been months since I lost my self, im weakening inside out, physically and mentally. It was last year when i thought i found the real me, but the days after are gettin harder to face. More obstacles to pass through.         First, it was friends. My close friend was diagnosed with leukaemia, lost her memory twice when she was doing her treatment. Then other friends who couldnt believe in her story. So it was only me being her backbone. After that, my close cousin went to Australia for her studies. My family started to hv major money probs, since im d last child of my family. I dont think i'm lucky like some might think, how LUCKY the last one should be. I dont think my dad can afford for me to do further studies in UK.      Im tryin to do ALL the best for my final year of high school. Going in science stream, is not easy. Especially family pressure. Now that i know i hv minor anaemia. Im quite tired facing life. i was an active person the years before. Now i felt like im almost dead.      But there's no turning back, I hv to do the last and best step of all. For my future life, so that i would be a successful person. Never give up, never surrender. Even though i believe in my own quote "a person success is not measured by how far he or she had studied, but who they turn out to be" i dont think i'm satisfied, if i dont fight till the end. This is what i hv to do even when i have lost my self.
