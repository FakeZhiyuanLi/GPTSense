						   Cockroaches, says I.   I think I got enough of them to raise my total to the high teens. I'm not normally a killer but seeing more than five in one spot, illuminated by streetlamp shadows, disgusts me. I doubt anyone will miss them. Plus I hid the bodies carefully under the mound of sheetrock piled in the dumpster. A fitting burial marker for those that live off the waste of society.   I have to go wash my hands now.

						   The ultimate challenge is not how much you can drink, but how much you can drink and still carry off the illusion of a life that meets the checklist items of American Acceptable (AA).

						   I'm sorry, I can't help it. &nbsp;I get chills when my cat licks my earlobe.   The wonderful thing about this whiteboard ranting is that I get to write about stuff I am only motivated to write about when I am drunk. Otherwise, in the sober light of day, it seems really, really boring. But after a few drinks&nbsp;everything seems really, really profound and interesting to a hypothetical wide range of people who could really, really give a shit since they are too busy writing about things that are really, really interesting to themselves.&nbsp; Really.   The next great thing about writing when&nbsp;I am&nbsp;drunk is that not only is it fascinating but my writing is amazing. The more I write tonight the more I wonder why I never submitted that poem about accidently running over my cell phone with my car for publication. After all, I wrote that while I&nbsp;was toasted so damnit it has to be good, right? I mean just look at the stuff&nbsp;I am cranking out now! Why edit when I know the next time I come back here to proof will only be the next time I return from a quick trip to the Quick Trip vodka section (mercifully&nbsp;next to the beef jerky). Doesn't make sense to me.   The next great thing about writing when you are drunk is that I can't remember the next great thing so it is time to move on to the next great thing.    My Adventures&nbsp;as a Part-Time Employee &nbsp;   Honestly, I never intended to get a part-time job as a&nbsp;part-time employee&nbsp;but&nbsp;the lure of re-living the past of making an hourly wage was too much, and I caved. The extra change gives me the&nbsp;ability to buy cheap vodka without having to take cat food&nbsp;to my day job for lunch. My cat goes spastic when I&nbsp;dip into her stash and I am weary of having to explain away empty plastic baggies.   [break time...i need to go work erotic fantasy story...i'll be back when i'm drink again]  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;
