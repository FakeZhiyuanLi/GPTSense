      Last night I cooked diner for 11 friends, which in all reallity I had no clue I could pull off. But the evening went awesome. I cooked cornish game hens with a cranberry jalepeno stuffing with sauted zucchini with stewed tomatoes topped with parmesean, asiago, and romano, and as a soup I did a saffron shrimp bisque. Just sitting down and laughing with friends was wonderful. Thanks to Jim everything became "of Doom". The drawer of Doom with loose knives, and the Cat of Doom that would randomly attack and the only way you would know is by the ear peircing scream of whoever Dusty the Cat decieded to attack. From last night also came that I am going to own my own restaurant and employ all of my friends in different areas of the business.  For the past week I have woke in the mornings and felt the powerful breath of autum coming on. I do believe it is in a Dar Williams song "summer is beginning to give up her fight." This morning however was the realization that autum is actually here and I felt like I was in Seattle. With the gray heavy clouds looming over a never-ending sky, and the rain that didn't really fall but drizzeled down. Not quite heavy enough to make you realize you were getting soaked but by the time you ended up where you were headed you were completely drenched. Ahh have I said I love the rain :)    The following is a poem I wrote back in Novemember but have had on my mind for a while and thought I would share with you all   Broken Hallelujah  Turn stale knob of radio on, effortless crack of the wrist: infamous words pour out ripped speakers, a hole-punched reservoir. Such a chatterbox - gibberish sentences incomprehensible to ears and mind (a shortage in the circuit), letters squashed like sardines. Hiccupped talk interrupted: flamed lullaby spilling through, a jaw-dropping funeral march (closed casket); nothing but a rhythm whore, pause. Eavesdrop on explicit, newfound streetlight song, tapered and perfect like a birthday card. Vibrate and quiver at complicated iambs, eerie composition with a magnetizing lure: a shovel for the grave, gravity menace.~ BAS

                    Yet again one week has passed and another begins with no more effort than the blink of an eye.  This past week was one of late nights and early mornings and some more softball games thrown in between.  One of my very good friends Sarah came into town for a couple days and it just so happened that the days she was here I had off of work.  I can almost say from Tuesday night around 11:30P.M. to Friday morning around 11:30A.M. I spent every waking hour with her and only went home to sleep.  From playing hackie sack in front of an altar in the Snowy's to winning a crazy game of poker(muaha ha ha) with very little sleep in between was one of the best weeks I have had in a while.  It was great to see her again and meet her fiance.  We actually got a comment from someone asking if Seth and I were brother and sister, Sarah responded with "Yeah and they just met Tuesday night."  I can offically say that I am done with breakfast foods for quite some time.  In the duration of 2 1/2 days I ate breakfast four times.  ----- I tend to want to make events or moments in my life last forever and so I tend to take more photographs than needed and/or try to remember everything as detailed as possible as not to lose anything in the current moment, but at that same time I have to ask myself if I am really enjoying the moment or just trying to latch on to it.  This past week I found myself in the same predicament  and realized that no matter if I remember that Seth wore awesome flame pants, or I swung out my first time up to bat that I will always remember the feelings.  The excitment of the softball game, and the laughter of beaming each other with a hackie sack, the feeling of pure serenity on the side of a mountain.  Then I realized that no matter what, this day I am living out right now will soon become "that one day", and I want to remember the happiness and smiles not the sorrow or clutter that sits in my brain from time to time, to go along with this day.  So with all that said I am living my life as if this day will become "that one day". ~Love, Squid

      I am on a soft ball team for the coed season and why I am on the team is still a question to be answered. Actually some people I know are on the team and they were short a girl and they called me up and said "puuhleeasseeee!!!" and me being someone who can't say no I said ok. Even though I told them I would not be an asset to their team, after all this is the very, very uncoordinated Squid we are talking about. During the two games that we have played so far I have only hit the ball once and it was a very happy moment, and then my brain had to kick my legs into gear because I forgot for a split second that, "I hit the ball, I HIT THE BALL, oh crap now I have to run!!!!" and proceeded to book it to first and somehow in the process made it to 3rd base and proceeded to be tackled by the short stop on the other team. I went from standing on the base to scrambling to keep my hand on the base to stay safe. One of my finer shining moments in glory I must say, and then of course my making it to home base on the next hit was pretty happy too. This week was also an interesting one at work. By some miracle (well not really a miracle, one of our cooks went off and is getting married this week) I moved up in the world of cooking. I am now running the flattop at work which comes with a lot of responsibility. You cook normally 75% of the order that comes in when you run the flattop along with making sure you have bread and buns down for all the burgers and sandwiches, after my first day and forgetting about bread for quite a while I would to say things are going pretty smoothly, well as smoothly as they can during a lunch rush while cooking for two different restaurants at once. Along with all of this, this past weekend I got see one of my really good friends Gina. She came down and we helped her sister move into her apartment and spent some time together. However while carrying a tote full of books (who packs a tote full of books anyways it is way to heavy!!!) I managed to scrap my hand on the edge of a meatal door and needless to say lost a couple layers of skin. It looks kinda gross right now and might even turn into an interesting scar, but like I said Meh, only a couple layers of skin. So that was basically my week at a glance. :) _______________________________   If the past is a lie and the future never comes, what then are we left with? Just this.....Just now.  This past week and a half has been hard as well and I am being forced to make stands where I have never dared to stand before. I went out to breakfast with my dad last weekend and found out that my mom has been talking to him, and has convinced him that it might be a good idea for me to move back to Chicago with her. First the only way I will be moving back there to live with her is if I am dead, over my dead body! But this also has a different side. To hear actually hear from his own mouth that my own dad, the one who has always supported me, is no longer behind me is heartbreaking. To the point where even my own roomate and one of my best friends doesn't understand how much it hurts to think that my dad isn't in some ways the man I thought he was and I know that is becuase well just a lot of different reasons. It feels though that I don't even know my own dad anymore and I think that is what hurts the most.  I actually stood up to my mom and talked back. One of the hardest things I have ever done but it felt good. Mom: "So how much are you screwing up your life now" Me: "I am not at all.  I have a good job and good freinds here Mom" Mom: "Yeah like the ones in Pinedale half them doped up and the other half knocked up?" Me: "No.  Ones that love me and care for my well being" Mom: "Uh huh sure.  Well your dad thinks you should move back too, I could take it to court Brittany" Me: "You could but you would lose and you know it. I don't want to live with you, I don't want you controlling my life anymore. I wouldn't be happy there and I have come to realize that I have to look out for what is best for me now. I wouldn't be able to go back highschool because I have my GED, and that pisses you off because I didn't get my diploma for you. But I won't live with you, Chicago is not the best place for me, and I am sorry that hurts you, but your choices have made my living with you not an option anymore. I'm sorry and I love you." (and I am thinking holy shit, oh my god I just said that to my mother. Shit, shit, shit, ok deep breaths, ok see what she says...) I get nothing but silence then a dial tone...I love you mom, and I hang up the phone.  I haven't heard from either of my parents since last weekend and am now trying to see if I what I said was acutally a good thing, and am now trying to decide what to do with my life.....time for some soul searching, thanks to listening to my rants, Britt.
