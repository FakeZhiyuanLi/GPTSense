      You'd expect that since school is just around the corner I wouldn't waste my time for leisure. I mean I'd be like making the most of my summer time left! Incidentally that's not my case! I've been doing  NOTHING  these past few days. This is how my day went.  - woke up at nine. - switched on the good old DVD, "a beautiful mind". - had a smoke. - caught "the bulletproof monk" on star movies. - had a smoke. - thought about masturbating. (take note, THOUGHT) - smoked instead. - made plans to meet up with ninoy, choy and ria. - watched "Bruce almighty" - smoked again. - got dressed. - left and went over to guel to tell him about the plan. - picked up ria and choy (ninoy backed out by the way) - went over to guava park and guess what I did? - I had a smoke - tried to play the guitar but it was useless so we left. - smoked and met with carlo and anton.  - went home and kicked miguels ass in 75-77 2k4 game.  - chit chatted with antons "girl". - ninoy came over. - they left and now I'm online. - I'll be watching another DVD later.  How freakin boring unproductive is that?! Almost all of my days are like that! If not even worse! shiiieeeet. Oh and sometime between bruce almighty and leaving I had chicken and empanada. Crap it;s even affecting my diet! Time to get up and exercise!

       emptiness is something that eats a person up.   I'm being eaten up, real quick. As the day that i leave my home comes closer i feel like i slowly lose parts of my soul. Alabang is where i live. Alabang is where i grew. Alabang is where my friends are. Alabang is where i'm supposed to be in. Alabang should be forever. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever. This happy dream of late night bumming, beer downing, smoke inhaling good times just has to end. Oh but i'm not saying goodbye to Alabang just yet. I will be back and the D7Gs will live! Alabang, my home now, my home forever. Peace boys.

      I started my diet three days ago. This afternoon i caught sight of a weighing scale as to which lead me to ponder on whether or not i should check up on the progress of my unstable diet. To my suprise i lost an astonishing  7  pounds! Yes,  7   pounds in three days. not bad! and to think i weighed on a full stomach!

      I'm currently on a diet to lose the 20 pounds i gained while i was in the states.   Here's what i've been doing.  - no rice - as much as posssible no carbos - one light meal a day - six o clock diet - lot's of water.  - exercise (soon to come)  i wouldnt really know if it's working because i just started it a day or two ago. Temptation is everywhere and i am on the brink of giving up! (pathetic!) haha i guess i just love food too much. Hopefully my drive to lose 45 pounds (my goal) is strong enough to resist all temptations.

      My day had it's usual ups and downs. I started it of by groggily waking up at 4 am. I had a freaking Religion project to do as well as an english long test to study for. I finished the project but i didn't really get to study for the test! stress! and ofcourse as you can expect, i didn't really do well in the test. oh well, that's life. Next highlight of the day was my CAdT training. it's not that i look forward to this session, infact i actually dread it! mindlessly following commands such as "sawalo-ba" and "sawalo-pat" is just plain stupid. our captain or should i say flight commander has got a personal grudge against me. i'm happy though, he doesn't use his power to make me miserable. althought the training itself is enought o make anyone feel miserable! just imagine, marching in the hot early afternoon sun! not to mention the push ups! "DROP!" that dreaded word. it kills me whenever i hear that. "sir one sir! sir two sir! sir three sir!...." shiiiiiaaaaat. anyway when the training ended, i felt great. the training itself is crap but the feeling you get from being able to go through it is just exhilarating! Feels great! After training today i decided to become and get the best cadet award. I pushed for a game of basketball after the training, i was still pretty much hyped up. my team was full of big guys so naturally i played point. My one and only higlight of the game was my one handed crossover which totaly faked the defender out and followed up by a foul counted finger roll. not bad i thought. but naturally after that i screwed things up. that's normal for me. so it's cool. i only played one game as i was still to get dressed for the highlight of my week. my date with "her". I was stalled abit at home since my grandma didn't want to let me use the Pahero, what a bitch, as if it was her car! so i ended up just using the space wagon, my space wagon, unfortunately! hehehe So i after getting lost around ortigas i picked "her" up. i took her all the way back to the dencios in ayala heights. why there? it's got the best view! it's an open area with a view of the city! simply beautifull! she and i were pretty lucky since there was a fireworks display! the night was going great. i even set up the waiter so that he'd bring a white rose to her while eating. she seemed pretty happy about it. from there we went back to eastwood, grabbed dessert and had a very nice chat. unfortunately i wan't really feeling it because i started feeling tired that time. nevertheless my night stipp went perfect. wouldn't have excahnged it for anything. except maybe to be with my family in alabang. anyway i'll be signing out for now, so damn sleepyyyyyyy......
