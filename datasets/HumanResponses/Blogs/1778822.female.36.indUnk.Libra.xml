      We got back from the conference to bunch of indifferent animals.  "Auntie" Carol had them so spoiled that none of them noticed or cared that we were gone for a week.   The conference was fun and informative, and very regimented, they had everything planned, I guess they didn't want any of the out-of-towners to feel nervous in the big city.  I being the displaced native and rebel that I am, decided to do almost none of the planned things, instead choosing to take the boys to all my old haunts.  We stayed at the  urlLink  Gershwin Hotel  on 27th and 5th, which is right around the corner from  urlLink The Museum of Sex.   The hotel was pretty nice for a mid priced place, the only complaint I had was the ongoing towel wars.  What is so difficult about replacing the same number of towels?  When we checked in, there were no towels at all just the bathmat.  We asked for three sets of towels since there were three of us registered to the room.  The next day, we had one bathtowel, three washcloths, no bathmat, and two handtowels, and it just went on from there.  It got so we were hiding towels in the armoire, just in order to be able to take a shower.  And this is all in spite of the signs everywhere in the bathroom asking us to please use the towels for more than one day to conserve water.  The hotel itself is very funky, the outside has fiberglass "flames" crawling up the front of the building.  And the inside is decorated in a classic Andy Warhol style, with the crowning touch being a Campbells soup can signed by Warhol himself.  For vacation reading I took a new Sandra Cisneros _Caramelo_ which arrived on my doorstep courtesy of a Vintage contest I don't remember entering.   Laura Pedersen's _Beginner's Luck_, and Irene Radford's _The Glass Dragon_ which my library had to import from Houston since there isn't a copy in all of Dallas.  I'm still reading _Caramelo_, but all the others were pretty good.   _Beginner's Luck_ was hilarious, it is a very cute story about a young girl who "divorces" her parents and goes to live with the town eccentrics.  I finished yet another pair of socks, in Red Heart Baby TLC in a light green color, (no picture yet), and have started a rainbow pair in a lovely hand dyed superwash wool that I got as part of  urlLink theknitters.com Sock of the Month Club  .  I didn't like the pattern they came with, so I'm doing my standard toe up style.

      These were done in some leftover Blue Lake Emu Superwash DK that I had leftover.  I'm getting pretty good at the toe up sock, I finished the second one of these in two days.     It's so nice to not to have to get up in the morning and go to work, yesterday I did absolutely nothing.  I cleaned up my living room craft endtable, and then knit and played Playstation 2 and watched talk shows all day.  Today, I'm actually leaving the house.  It's the monthly meeting of the  urlLink Dallas Hand Knitters Guild , and I really enjoyed going last month, I don't know anyone else (in RL)  who knits so it's nice to get together and check out everyone's projects.  I'll be bringing my Faina's Scart, which is going really, really slow since I've only been able to do a couple of rows at a time before getting bored, and another pair of toe up socks.   Current Read  Naked Empire by Terry Goodkind.  The eighth in the Sword of Truth series.  This one is pretty preachy, I don't remember the last ones having such a blatant message.  The story is still good, but I still think the first three were the best.  It seems to be a trend lately, fantasy writers can't just do one book or a trilogy, they just have to keep cranking them out ad infinitum.

      Only 24 plus hours until vacation, woo hoo, I really need a little time away from work.  I'm tired and cranky and not very much fun to be around.  Today was pretty boring.  We visited with the tigers, who are in training for blood draws and injection, but other than that most of the day was spent packing up lab samples.    Mystery Project   I'm doing the Swank-a-long with the KTBH group.  I have absolutely no clue what it is we're making, but I'm really learning a lot so it's worth it!  Here's a picture of step 5 finished and awaiting the next set of instructions.

      Finally had a day off today, was disappointed to find the library closed for staff training, I have a stack of books to pick up.  Hopefully tomorrow.    I'm currently reading "Flight of the Unicorn" by Anthony Shepherd.  This is the story of an expedition in the 1960's to save the Arabian Oryx, who were on the brink of extinction.  In fact, in 1972 the last wild Oryx was killed, leaving only the animals remaining in zoos to represent the species.  Fortunately thru careful management and captive breeding, Oryx were able to be reintroduced into the wild, with a current population of approximately 500.   This is an Arabian Oryx:      Put the finishing stitches into the August ornament for the stitchalong.  This is Snowflakes Falling by Rosie's Garden.          Found my digital camera, it was somewhere I would never have looked, so I'm glad I decided to do a little cleaning up.  Now I need to get some batteries, so I can do some pics of my knitting.

      I'm doing a Christmas Ornament stitchalong with the yahoo group  urlLink Chartswappers  .  We're stitching an ornament a month from the 2002 JCS Ornament issue.     Here's my July finish, Merry Mooseness by Something in Common          Today's Knitting!    I started   urlLink Faina's Scarf by Fibertrends .  I'm doing it in Cherry Le Fibre Nobili Tajmahal, which is a merino, silk, cashmere mix.  Glorious.  Softer than soft.  The pattern comes with each row written out, I about died until I found the chart in the middle.  Four hundred and something rows, no way I'd be able to keep my place in a text pattern.  I'm also doing a pair of socks in some leftover Superwash Emu, and the Great Aran Afghan from Knitter's magazine.  Next up, Opal socks and one of the sweaters I have yarn and pattern for, not sure which one yet though.     At the Zoo    I don't understand my boss.  Despite us being shorthanded, and having to have me come in on my day off, he still overscheduled procedures.  So we all run around like crazy trying to get everything done, and never really having a minute to clean up what came before.  Today's major procedure was radiographs and physical exam on our female Bald Eagle.  Zoo's can only have Bald Eagles if they are unreleaseable into the wild.  Our female only has one wing, not sure what happened to her, she's been at the zoo since 1982.  Probably gunshot by some idiot hunter.

      Gotta jump on the bandwagon and create my own little personal space where I can tell "everyone" all about what I had for breakfast, bitch about my day, and maybe show a couple of photos of my finished works.  I just finished a pair of socks made with Regia Wool 6ply in Midnight 5403      The picture sucks since I can't find my digital camera and I just stuck the sock on the scanner.  This is my first pair of toe up socks, and I think I like doing them this way best.  Thank you to Wendy Johnson of  urlLink  Wendy Knits!  for the pattern, which is posted on her website.      Work Sucked!    One of the other techs is on vacation, and the third called in sick.  So it was me and three veterinarians, doing the repro exam, hoof trim and general physical on the Okapi.  What is an okapi?  It's the other member of the giraffe family, with big ears and a stripey butt.  Here's a photo, and a  urlLink  link .     Don't get me wrong, mostly I love my job but not when I've been the only vet tech at the zoo for the past three days, I have to do a major procedure all by my lonesome and I have to go in on my day off tomorrow because she's going to call in sick again, and we're already short-handed.  I just have to console myself that vacation is next week, and I'm going home to NYC for the  urlLink  AZVT conference  .

      Today is my birthday, so I made a trek out to my favorite stitching store (Eye of the Needle in Mineola, TX), and a trek it is, about 80 miles from where I live.  I picked up a whole bunch of items I had left for framing.  I didn't have time to take pictures tonight, but will in the next couple of days.  Sherry is my absolute favorite framer, I don't know what I'd do without her.  She takes what I pick out and makes it even better.  She's decided to start stocking some knitting supplies in the store due to overwhelming request, so I suggested sock yarns.  I'm still plugging away on the same knitting projects, the Bernat socks, the cable sweater and the afghan.  I was bad and cast on another pair of "socks" which are going to be more like slippers, in a terrycloth like yarn.  Too thick to wear with shoes, but just right for keeping feet warm on the couch.

      Not a great knitting day, tried on my latest pair of toe-up socks, and they were too tight, I'm thinking the yarn was a different weight then I originally thought, it doesn't really say on the label so I was going by the recommended needle size and making an educated guess.   Obviously I guessed wrong, so I ripped them out and started over.  No big loss, I hadn't gotten that far.  But, of course, this is the sock that I've already frogged three times, so I'm beginning to think this yarn is cursed.  I also remeasured my finished sweater back/front, because it really looks too big, but it was right on the money, a little smaller than the dimensions called for unblocked.  So, I made a dishcloth.  That way the day wasn't a total knitting waste.  Totally mindless knitting, sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered.  It's that kitchen cotton crap you get at Walmart. I use the white to do invisible cast on's, so I have a whole cone.  I bought a few balls in colors and like to do two color patterns cloths.  This was a free pattern that I got from somewhere on the 'net, probably from a link from  urlLink Knitlist

      Finished the bead work on my September stitch-a-long ornament.  This is "A Merry Tree for Thee" by Full Circle Designs from the 2002 Just Cross Stitch magazine Ornament Issue.     I don't know what I'm going to do with all the ornaments.  I'm a terrible seamstress, don't particularly like finishing and usually just have my pieces framed.  I haven't even put up a tree for the holidays for years.  Something tells me I'm probably not going to be participating in next years stitchalong, especially since it's keeping me from working on almost anything else, and since I've rediscovered knitting.   Wash Day, Nothing Clean   Although Zedd has gotten all the attention lately with his bag, we do have two other cats.  That's Morty on the left and Willow on the right.  Helping with the laundry, or so they claim.

      Forced them to reschedule my appointment.  What a shame, I so much love to go to the dentist, unfortunately only postponed until tomorrow afternoon.  Rats!  Went to the monthly Day Knitters meeting of my  urlLink knitting guild .  It's just an informal stitch and bitch session, no programs, nothing special, but it sure is nice to have other people to sit and knit with.  Two of the ladies were working on  urlLink Hanne Falkenberg  kits, which makes me want to order one even more, but I've promised myself that I   will  use up some of my stash before I buy anymore yarn for sweaters (socks don't count).  I have at least five that are aging nicely, and I really need to control spending since we're trying to stick to a budget.  There are several regulars including myself from all different skill levels, one lady is a total beginner and has tons of questions.  She was working on a dishcloth (and must have read the pattern wrong as it's more of a bedspread than a dish cloth) the last time I saw her, I wonder if she finished it up and moved onto something else.  I don't know where I fit myself in on skill level.  I'm almost completely self taught, and am not intimidated by aran type patterns, but don't have the confidence to attempt a Fair Isle yet.  Got a couple of inches done on the front of the pink monstrosity.  I was afraid that I was going to run out of yarn, no worries, the Michael's that I bought the original skeins from still had some of the same dyelot.   It's strange,  urlLink Michaels  has more yarn than Hobby Lobby.  Usually Hobby Lobby only has four or five skeins on the shelf of any given type, not hardly enough to make anything useful, and just try to get some help finding more in "the back".  But  urlLink Hobby Lobby  has a much better notions section.  They even had size 0 dp's, which was a relief considering my sock fiasco the other day when I didn't have time to run to one of the LYS.

      Trip to the eye doctor this morning, the good news is my prescription has improved again, as I was told it would as I got older.  Astigmatism. Aging changes the shape of your eyeballs.  The bad news, he dilated my eyes, which made it annoying to drive so I couldn't do any of the errands I had planned and impossible to see to do any fine work.  So, I didn't finish the beading on my September ornament, which is all I have left to do.    I was able to finish the front of my sweater (which I have discovered is called Cables de Menthe, probably because it is shown in a lovely vomit green color in Knitters, mine is a so much more dignified screaming pink)      I got the latest issue of  urlLink Knitting Digest  in the mail today.  I can't wait for my subscription to be up, I don't think I've found a single thing I would like to knit in this magazine.  It was a gift, and I know it was the thought that counts, but I would have preferred a gift certificate or dish cloths.  This issue features the chick that won the show Joe Millionaire, Zora Andrich, wearing a shapeless fluffy object over a sweater that makes my eyes hurt.    For kicks I looked inside, and what did I find but another awful picture that shows even less detail than the cover, (if anyone wants to make the sweater it's at their own risk), and then I turned to the materials section and nearly fell out of my chair. The cover is titled "Dress Like a Star", and the subheading inside is  urlLink Celebrity Tunic and Stole , apparently you have to be one to afford the ugly sweater set.    The yarn the sweater calls for is Firenze Boucle, and according to the price guide it is $11/ball.  At 14 skeins for the small size (which I am not) the ugly sweater would be $154 (The large is  $176), plus the effort and time to make this thing.  The shapeless fluffy object turned out to be a shawl which calls for 6 skeins Firenze Boucle, plus 6 skeins Firenze (also $11/ball) totalling $132.  Good lord!  And I've been worrying about wanting to spend the money to buy a kit from Hanne Falkenberg or Virtual Yarns.  The other patterns aren't that bad, just not really my thing.  I'm not a bulky yarn kinda gal.  BTW, if anyone wants the magazine, I'll be happy to mail it to the first person who asks for it.  Just send me an email, my address is under the photo of Zedd on the sidebar.  Speaking of Zedd, he is still enjoying his Swank Bag, it's a very nice bunwarmer    And here are the socks that I finally got the toe functioning on after frogging three times:

      got the sock toe worked out.  Metal needles, that's the ticket.  Couple more rows on the sweater front done too.  Was the only technician at work again today.  Didn't get much knitting done since I wasn't able to take any breaks.  We we doing quarantine exams on some of the birds we got in for our planned Interactive Bird Exhibit.  Which I call the Imaginary Bird Exhibit, since the wallabys are still living there, and it isn't scheduled to be completed until 2005-2006.  Which begs the question, why the heck are we getting hand-raised birds for a project that is 2-3 years from completion.    It's a government thing, you just wouldn't understand - hell, I don't and I work there.  The birds are really special, two red lorys and two guira cuckoos.  They are all head sitters, it gets really interesting when you're trying to feed or clean, or especially leave the enclosure.

      Left my post-it note with the row counter  for my sweater at work.  Darn it, I have almost the whole front done, I have the pattern memorized, but I can't remember how many repeats I have left to do.  Should have known that would be just the tip of the iceberg for the evening.  Worked on my September stitch-along cross stitch ornament instead.  It has a lot of eyelets, which I hate, so I modified it.  Got bored and started a pair of socks with Bernat Sox yarn in Jazz, which is a pink and purple self-striper.  Obviously distracted by something, because I had to restart twice, once the needles were too big, the second time I miscounted, and then when I finally got going I broke a needle.  I don't think I really like Brittany Birch DP's, they are very fragile.  So far I've broken a size 0, a size 1 and had a size 2 split at the tip.  I'm thinking of buying a bunch of different types and seeing what I like best.

      Here's the eyelash scarf, it is an interesting color combination, there wasn't a color name on the label just a number (35006) so I don't know what Bernat is calling it:    and here is square three of my Aran Afghan, the photo is a little washed out:    and finally the gauge swatch from my drop stitch tunic, I forget the name of the pattern it's from issue 70 of Knitter's magazine.     I'm doing it in Lion Brand Cotton Ease which I had bought to make the Sitcom Chic Cardigan from the Spring 2003 issue of  urlLink knitty.com , and then decided I didn't really like the cardigan, so I'm actually using up some stash yarn.   I guess I'll have to go buy some more to fill in the empty space.   Work is Hard  I really do enjoy my job for the most part, working with  the animals is fantastic, and I feel like I'm doing something useful.  But along with all that, somedays hard decisions have to be made.  Monday the decision was made to euthanize our oldest okapi.  He had been going downhill for a year, and we had done everything medically possible to prolong his life.  He suffered from progressive degenerative osteoarthritis, and unfortunately this past weekend his condition progressed to the point where he was having difficulty rising, he had stopped eating normally, and walking was obviously painful.  Since his quality of life had deteriorated, the head vet and the mammal curator realized that the kindest thing to do was relieve his suffering.  Obviously this was a hard decision to make, as this okapi had been with the Zoo since 1982. Everyone was very sad.  I wish I had a picture of him to post in memorium.   Current Read  The Gates of Winter byMark Anthony.  This is book number five in his Last Rune series.  I've really enjoyed them all so far.  It's traditional fantasy fiction.  Travis Wilder is from modern earth, and thru a series of events becomes transported to a parallel world Eldh, where he discovers that he is a Runebreaker, and is destined to save (or is it end) the world.  Obviously this is an extremely simplified synopsis, I am by no means a great writer so here's a link to  urlLink Amazon.com

      As I thought, I finished the eyelash scarf while watching my "shows".  My boyfriend came home and wanted to know if I was knitting another cat.  It's a very interesting piece, and it will look good with my leather jacket this winter, and I can take it to show and tell next guild meeting but I don't know if I'd do it again.  I'll post a picture another day.    Now I'm working on square #3 of my Great Aran Afghan, and getting ready to swatch for the oversized drop stitch cable sweater I want to make next.

      The room was full of people, though I've never been before old-timers seemed a little surprised (and pleased) with the turnout.  The meetings are being held at a new location - The Craft Guild of Dallas and it may be more centrally located than last years meeting hall.  At the end of the meeting there was show and tell - I had my lovely rainbow striped sock that I had been working on diligently ( I finished it yesterday), if I had known I would have brought something more interesting, but there's always next month.  I really enjoyed seeing what people were working on, and hearing all the stories.  One woman had mentioned wanting a pair of socks a month for a year, so her close friend decided to meet the challenge, she brought the first seven pairs and being a little behind still had number two of pair eight on the needles.  I think there was a sign up sheet going around on who wanted to be next to have socks knitted for them!  One woman who crochets (no knitting, just crochets) showed us a strip afghan in progress for a boyfriend who said his favorite colors are black and navy.  "Anything else?" she asked him.  "No, just those two colors".  In order to see the pattern she added some cream to the mix, hope he likes it!  Not to get started on knitting on airplanes but, one poor woman had her knitting taken away from her at Vancouver customs following an Alaskan cruise.  After knitting happily all the way there, on the cruise and part of the way back the Vancouver customs agents in their infinite wisdom decided that not only were the needles dangerous weapons, but the yarn could be made into a garrotte to strangle someone with.  So they took everything but the finished pieces, apparently not realizing that this could be unravelled and made into a weapon too.  The best anecdote of the night was from a woman who was knitting outside her communications classroom. A man approached her and asked her several questions about her knitting.  When he noticed her Guild totebay, he asked her what Guild was, and what did it do.  She said that the Guild was a place to get together and knit, and talk and learn.  He ruminated over this for a few minutes, and then brightly said "so, it's like AA?"  At which point most of us were rolling in the aisles, since it's nothing like AA.  I personally have at least 10 new things on my wishlist just from looking at all the fantastic FO's and WIP's.  There were scarves (one made in quivit) and shawls, and afghans, and sweaters, and socks, and ruanas in wool, and cashmere, and angora, and handspuns and any other fibers you could think of.  I felt like a kid in a candy store, I do most of my shopping online due to time constraints.  I love making my infrequent visits to my LYS, of which I am fortunate enough to have several.  I do need to finish making a coulple of things from my stash before I buy more though.     Bye, Bye Faina's Scarf, Hello Eyelash  After dropping an entire row of YO's, and not being able to figure out how to pick them all up and get the pretty twist effect that all the others had, I stepped back and really looked at my work.   I came to the realization that the yarn I was using really did not want to be made into the pattern I was trying to make it into.  I have some wool coming from  urlLink  Elann.com   which may want to be a lovely Faina's scarf.     I think I'm going to try the DNA scarf with the Tajmajal, it may hold up better with a tighter gauge and cable work as opposed to lace.  So I started the Bernat Eyelash scarf.  I'm using the label pattern.  Goes something like this - cast on 20ish on size 11 needles, knit until you run out, weave in ends, put it around your neck and enjoy.  I've never knit with Eyelash before, and I've discovered three very important things:  1.  Don't drop a stitch you will never find it 2.  If you do drop a stitch and decide to rip out and start over, eyelash doesn't rip out 3.  So, be careful - no dropping, no ripping - don't start at 1:30 AM right after you finished ripping out your last project.  I've got about an inch done, and I can probably get it finished today while I watch some mindless TV.

      What fun. Last night was the first meeting of the  urlLink Dallas Hand Knitters Guild   that I've attended.  (They promised last night that this was the year to spruce up the website)  The program for this year is Sweaters 101, and by the end of the year we all should have learned everything there is to know about making the perfect fitting sweater.  Yesterday's program was on measuring, and we got a little handout with about 75 different measurements you can take to make the perfect fit.  I don't know if I care that anything fits that well!  I'll do a little more detail tomorrow.  I'm working on the number two of the brightly colored sock, (these are made of Interlacements Little Toes Yarn in the Las Vegas Brights color), top sock in the photo.  The bottom ones are the Red Heart Baby TLC socks I finished on my NY trip.    Still waiting for the last few steps in the Mystery Stitch-A-Long.  I still have no idea what the item is supposed to be when it is finished.     I got sucked into some eyelash yarn at Hobby Lobby the last time I went in.  The had added a whole section of Bernat yarns, so I bought several skeins of Hot Socks but also couldn't resist some fluffy yarn that will be made into a scarf.  That will be my next quick project when the rainbow socks are done.    Faina's scarf is coming along, it's my first attempt at lace knitting, so I do have to tink back at least every couple of rows from counting errors.  The other night I got into a groove and was just whipping along, I finished the first body repeat, only 3 more to go!   Mona Monkey Yearly Physical   Yesterday was the day for the Mona Monkeys to have their yearly physicals.  This consists of anesthestizing them, radiographing them from head to toe, TB testing, dental exams, replacing contraceptive implants in the females (the troupe is mother, daughter,  and son), vaccinating, blood tests, and generally making sure everything is in tip top shape. Aren't they cute?

      Figures, instead of working on the sleeves, I started an afghan square.  Worked 1/4 of it before discovering that I'd somehow screwed up the pattern.  Ripped it out.  Pulled the sleeve that I had started out of my knitting bag, discovered a mistake and ripped that out also.  Decided to restart and do both sleeves at the same time so it won't take as long.    Did start an Opal sock in Brazil 5001, going to try the Strong Heel pattern that was in Knitter's Fall 2003.  I've got several inches of the top done.  (I've only been working on it while reading email and playing Disciples 2 on the computer)  Color pattern is a little clown-esque but I'll wear them to work anyway.  My co-workers find all my handknitted socks very amusing, especially since I wear them with my uniform dark green polo shirt and khaki shorts (or pants).

       Sock is Finished  Not going to post a picture since it's almost the same as the first one, which has a listing in my finished item roster on the sidebar.  Now I don't know if I want to work on the sweater sleeves, or start another GAAA square.  Decisions, decisions.  The afghan square will probably win out since I'm pretty bored of the sweater.  I should probably stick to smaller projects like socks, and afghans made out of squares, or at least pick more interesting or complex sweater designs.  I have a couple of boxes of yarn in the closet with patterns picked out for them which I won't let myself start until I finish this one.  But my big box of sock yarn imported from Germany is calling me...    Oh, what to do, what to do?

       Cursed Sock, Part 2  Fortunately number 2 of the pair is not cursed and I'm in the home stretch, only 24 rows of ribbing to go and I have another pair of fraternal twin socks.  I don't even try to make exactly matching socks with patterning yarns.  The Bernat Hot Sox yarn isn't really patterning per se, but even on Regia or Opal I just don't bother to find the exact stretch of color that the first sock started with, it just seems way too anal to me.   Sweater  I emailed  urlLink Knitter's   magazine to ask about the error in the pattern, and was pleasantly surprised when the designer sent me an email almost immediately (within 10 hours) to expain to me what she had intended for the pattern.  In the interest of saving space ( I would imagine) she only included a partial cable pattern for the sleeve up to the increase row, just to explain how that would fit in.  Otherwise the patterning is the same as the body.    Not very interesting I'm sure, but I really appreciated that she took the time to email me and so quickly too!  Now I can get back to the sleeves as soon as I'm done with this sock, and I'll be done with the sweater in no time.      Spoiled Greyhound  Dave took our greyhound Abe to the bank with him, in the convertible with the top down (Abe was wearing his doggie seat belt), this was the first time Dave had ever put the top down with the dog in the car.  As he was preparing to leave the bank, he put the top up, since they were going to be getting on the highway to go to the park to join the other greyhouds from the  urlLink Greyter Dallas Walking Club .  Abe started whining, so Dave put the windows down.  Abe kept whining, so Dave pulled over, put the top back down and drove slower in the right lane so the dog could enjoy the breeze.  That dog is so spoiled.  I'm sure my Saturn is no longer going to be good enough for him, he'll insist on riding in the Mustang.

      Here's the Mini Mogul sock, the right side view is a close up of the detail on the top.  The darker one is actually the right color.        Sweater knitting is stalled.  Surprise, surprise, there is an error in the pattern.  I've emailed Knitter's magazine hoping to get the "official" version, but if not I'll make it up as I go along.  The error is on the sleeves, the way the pattern is written the cable crossings on alternate cross-over rows would be on the purl side.  I can't tell from the picture if the sleeves have a shorter repeat to the cable pattern or if it's the same as the body.  Ah, well, if I don't get an answer soon I'll just go with whatever looks good.

      Not too much to say today, my day off, didn't really do anything interesting.  Played a lot of computer games and finished the Kensington Rose Sampler.  It's very pretty and delicate.       I also finished a Mini Mogul sock, but the picture will have to come later, batteries are charging.

       Rhino Zedd   Here's the Zedd baby pic where he most resembles a rhino, he was about 3 weeks old in this photo    I found out today that my boss is intimidated by me.  Since the one associate vet is leaving, he wanted me to pick up some of the paperwork slack.  He told the temporary vet this, who went ahead and mentioned it to me.  My only issue with it was that they needed to tell me exactly what they wanted and not just leave it for me to figure out on my own.  My boss never said anything, and I found out that yesterday (my day off) the temp let it slip that he had already told me.  My boss said he wasn't looking forward to that conversation, 'cause he didn't want to ask me.  You know, I'm really not that much of a hardass.  I'm just opinionated, and not afraid to speak my mind.

       Stress relief  Very tiring day at work today, and not much time to knit.  Usually I knit at lunch (cause it's much more portable than cross stitch), but today we had a going away party for one of our associate veterinarians.  He's moving onto the Cincinnati zoo, and we all wish him well - with a sigh of relief.  Nice guy, great guy, does not get along with the head vet and the tension in the air can be cut with a knife.  The head vet it must be said is not by any means easy to get along with.  But he really took a dislike to this associate, and did everything in his power to make life hell for him.  We didn't always get along either, but when he told me he was leaving I sure didn't respond - "Good".  What will the final evaluation say?  "I hate him and wish he were dead"  Very professional.   The Tapir dance  Besides lunch, we did a procedure on our female Brazilian Tapir to radiograph her abdomen and return her to her exhibit after a three week hospital stay.  She was with us because she suddenly stopped eating and started acting "weird".  We found out that she had been eating the pea gravel around her pool (tapirs love water), which caused a partial blockage.  One exploratory surgery and several enemas later...  well, there's nothing like a bunch of vets, zoo keepers, and zoo techs cheering and doing the dance of joy because the tapir pooped on her own!  Today's radiographs showed that the basketball sized load of gravel in her stomach has reduced to softball size and it seems to be passing, so no follow up surgery and she's going to be fine.  Big sigh of relief, she's a big sweetie.    Anyway, enough about feces for today.     And finally, crafty content  I've made it to the second row of bobbles on my  urlLink Sock of the Month Club  purple Mogul anklet.  I had to redo the first row a couple of times because the bobbles kept wanting to head to the purl side.  My friend Kim, said I should just leave it and call it a massage sock.  Ha, ha, Kim, guess who's getting coal in her stocking for Xmas.  I finally figured out that if I k tbl, as the first of the (k, p, k, p, k) into one stitch that they would pop to the front.  The directions say absolutely nothing about this, so I wonder if I'm the only one on earth who didn't know.  Started a new cross stitch design last night,  urlLink Kensington Rose Sampler   from  urlLink The Sweetheart Tree .  I've got the first couple of rows done and it is very pretty and delicate.  Looks like it will be a quick stitch project, which means that October is going to be my month of the most finishes.   Zedd  Zedd is always helpful around the house.  Here he is making sure I'm cleaning the guinea pig cage correctly.     He jumps in on his own, and is perfectly content to play with Black Pig (aka Lenny) until we're done freshening her habitat.  Black Pig, (we have two, one tortoiseshell and one white, actually named Lenny and Gaby, usually called Black Pig and White Pig) enjoys the company and plays happily with Zedd.  White Pig is a little more timid, and is probably being held by Dave so she doesn't get stressed.

      I have three new things finished.  One is the cursed sock, which is lucky it is in some of my favorite colors otherwise...    This is Bernat Sox yarn in the Jazz Hot color.  And two cross stitch pieces.  Victorian Valentines by JBW Designs, too big to fit on the scanner, and very washed out on the digital camera since I took these photos inside with bad lighting.     and Plum Berry Sampler by Bent Creek Designs.  I just love the little flat topped bird.     Still plugging along on the pink sweater, the purple bobble anklets and the slippers.  No pics since I can't seem to get the knitting bag and the camera into the same room.  Went to the Texas State Fair today.  Dragged Dave around the Fiber Arts Building for nearly an hour so we could check out the stitched and knitted items.  Realized why I don't enter anything.  The judging seems really arbitrary, some really gorgeous and difficult things got thirds, and some really so-so stuff got blue ribbons.  There must be something that we can't see from the outside of the glass cases, but I don't want to put myself thru that.    Besides which, the exhibit designers seem to think that all knitted and crocheted afghans must be held down by something extremely heavy or they will blow away.  There was, (and I'm not exaggerating here) a diorama with huskies mushing complete with a wooden block covered with fake snow on top of a lovely white afghan.  And a  dog made out of scrap metal, and an armadillo made out of nails covering the blue ribbon winning knitted afghan.  You could barely see the afghan.  Which was made even more stupid because in that same exhibit case there was a huge empty spot the afghan could have been hung in.    So, that's what I want to do, spend loads of time making something beautiful, finishing it perfectly and then handing it off to a bunch of "experts" so they can stick some rocks, or twigs, or maybe a big block Chevy on it, because it just needs "something" to make it look better.

      Last night was the October meeting of the Dallas Handknitter's Guild.  The program was on gauge.  The programs are leading up to a grand finale of knitting a sweater, the whole year has been named Sweaters 101.  I think it's pretty cool, since I'm not really a sweater knitter, (I hate finishing, the knitting part I can do just fine) so hopefully I'll learn some stuff.    The woman doing the gauge talk brought along a bunch of her swatches.  They were huge. We're talking 10 x 20 some of them.   I don't make swatches that big, and I don't usually save them intentionally.  Mostly they end up either in a bag in the knitting closet or in the trash.  I don't swatch for socks, my sock is my swatch and I'm more than willing to rip out if it's not fitting right.  Show and tell time was not quite as interesting as last time.  Lots of socks, a bunch of sweaters and shawls.  One woman is making her husband a sweater with indigo dyed cotton and her hands were blue.  Beautiful stuff, but her husband is huge, like 6'7" and the piece she was working on looked more like a bedspread than a sweater.  My boyfriend isn't small either, maybe that's why he's only gotten socks, hats and scarves so far.  I'm almost done with my "cursed sock" #1, couple more rows of ribbing and a bind off and I'll be finished.  I know I keep saying I'm almost done, but this time I really am.  I rotate my projects, so I worked on this sock last on Monday, and just got back to it at the meeting last night. Since it's so close, I'm going to finish it today instead of waiting.  I'm going to start the latest kit from  urlLink TheKnitter.com's sock of the month club  which is a cute purply anklet.  They haven't updated their website lately.  I'm sure by now everyone knows about Roy Horn (of Siegfried and Roy), being near death after being mauled by one of his tigers during a show.  What a monumental tragedy.  I feel terrible that this happened and wish Roy all the best.  I'm disgusted that PETA and HSUS is using it as a platform against the private ownership of big cats.  (Don't get me wrong, I'm not for private ownership of big cats, I think untrained people who have one as a backyard or house pet are morons)  I just think it's inappropriate that in one breath PETA says, "Oh, Roy we hope you get better" and in the next says, "what a shame you'll have to get rid of all your animals now".

      Still plugging away on the same old projects, I'm pretty slow, no need to bore anyone with progress pics.  The first "cursed sock" is almost done, so far, so good.  Cute baby pics today:  This is "Kina" Bongo.  She is our newest baby, born on September 22nd.  Baby and mom are both doing well.    This is "Jordan" Oryx.  She is about nine months old now, she was handraised by us at the hospital.    Here is one of the Guira cuckoos.  They are just the cutest things, I love cuckoos we've not had them at the zoo before

      No knitting done today but a lot of cross-stitch got finished.  I started and finished the October ornament for my Chartswappers group stitchalong.  Called Trust... is a Virtue, designed by  urlLink The Victoria Sampler  .  This is my least favorite of all the ornaments that were chosen for the stitchalong, and I probably wouldn't have bothered except I've gotten this far, and the grand prize is so cool.     I also put the finishing stitches in my Dimples Designs Wee Beasties Part 5.  This dragonfly was a big pain in the butt.  There are nine different Kreinik metallics, and almost no two stitches next to each other in the body are the same color.  The wings are done with two strands of blending filament and no floss, then backstitched.  It is gorgeous, the scan doesn't really do justice, but Dave is not getting any of the companion pieces stitched for him anytime soon.     The new piece I started is on 18 count linen and only uses two colors of overdyes and a perle cotton.  So it should work up fairly quickly which is just what I need right now.  Here are a couple of photos of my dining room wall of fame, and two of the pieces I got back from the framer's yesterday.  Celestial Wings by  urlLink Dragon Dreams Designs   and English Elegance by  urlLink The Heart's Content  .

       November's Ornament   Santa Star by Lavender Wings Designs    Only one more ornament to do for this stitch-a-long.  Thank god!  I will not be signing up for next year's, I can't take the pressure of having to stitch anything on a deadline.  Besides that, other than the ornaments I only got a few things finished this year, so I could really use the stitching time for items I really want to make.  I restarted my Heather sweater and got a few rows done, not enough to take a photo of yet.  Probably won't take it along to the in-laws, I've got the second Brasil sock I want to finish so I think I'm going to bring that.  A woman from NZ on my stitching group has offered to trade for some Possum yarn, so I'm going to be getting enough to make some gloves in return for some cross stitch supplies.  I'd love to make a sweater, but since I live in Texas, I wouldn't have much opportunity to wear a possum sweater, I've heard it's very, very warm.

      Well, I was going to post a picture of the inch or so I'd managed to stitch on my Heather sweater, but I decided to rip it all out since I didn't like the fabric I was getting with the suggested needles.  I'm probably going to wait until after we get back from the in-laws for the holiday gathering to restart since I need to make another swatch and do the math.  Oh, well I have plenty of sock yarn to keep me busy.

      DNA Scarf is done and blocking in the spare bedroom.   It came out great, when dry, I'll have to get Dave to model.   I'm pretty sure I don't want to make a twin for me, since I don't think I could stand doing that particular pattern again, at least not for a long while.  But I found another lovely  urlLink  idea   on what to do to use up my three balls of Tajmahal.  These patterns were created by Myrna Stahman in memory of Matthew Shepherd, the University of Wyoming student who was beaten to death for being gay.  I like the "Matthew" scarf and may have to knit the "Matt" one also to donate somewhere.  Speaking of donations,  Wendy Johnson of  urlLink  Wendy Knits! , Teresa Stetler-Clear of   urlLink  One More Row and Another Latte   and Deb Marvin of  urlLink  Yentela   have teamed up for a holiday season charity project.  Through  urlLink  Heifer International  you can purchase animals or a share of an animal to donate to impoverished families around the world.  The goal was one  urlLink  Knitting Basket   at a cost of $500.  So far they've raised enough for almost seven baskets! Click the button below for the official Knitbloggers Knitting Basket Project Page.           In other knitting news, I started swatching for Heather, which is showing great restraint, since I really just wanted to dive right it.  I didn't though, because the sweater is supposed to be somewhat form fitting,  gauge is actually important, it looks like I'm spot-on with the size three needles the pattern calls for, but better safe than sorry.

       Work, work, work  I can't believe I forgot to mention the day I had at work yesterday.  We were in the middle of doing radiographs on one of the Children's Zoo goats, (who has a bladder condition and who is losing weight for no obvious reason), when all of a sudden there came a radio call for help at the rhino exhibit.  Head vet grabs temporary vet #2, and goes off to see what is wrong.  About 15 minutes later he radios me, we have an emergency at rhinos,  and we need to pack the emergency stuff.  Head vet has the van, which is usually what we use to transport personnel and gear, so we throw everything in a pile on the back dock to wait for them to come pick us up.  He never did say what the emergency was, so we packed everything but the kitchen sink.  When we got there we found out that the rhino had received a new piece of "enrichment" that day.   A big blue barrel with both ends cut off.  Well...  he liked it so much he got his head stuck in the barrel up to his ears and couldn't get it off.  I wish I had a photo, but unfortunately I don't.  Everyone showed up to help sort out the situation, from the vet staff to the construction department, and ideas were flying.  First they tried to cut it off with gardening shears while the rhino was still awake, it readily became apparent he wasn't going to go for that, so we administered a dose of sedative to mellow him out.   The final plan "A" was to drill several holes in the barrel, then use poles with curved rebar attached with ducktape to pull the barrel off.  Plan "B" (because "A" didn't work, the rebar kept bending) was to run some rope thru the drilled holes and have 8 or 10 people pull the barrel off.  Plan "C" (do you see a pattern here?) was to take a cordless saw and cut the barrel off.    I think it was a combo of Plan "C" and brute force that eventually pulled the barrel off his head.   Reversal drugs for the sedative were admininstered, and the barrel-ectomy was declared a success!    The goat had some teeth that needed to be filed, which could account for the weight loss, the urinary thing is still somewhat of a mystery, but it had pretty much cleared up on the meds before we got the x-rays scheduled so we'll probably have to wait for the next flare-up.

       Sweater arrives in the nick of time, scarf almost done  Only two more repeats to go on the scarf, then block and wear.  I'll be so happy when I'm done, since my Heather sweater kit arrived.  I promised Dave I would finish his scarf, so I'm not letting myself work on anything else.  I know me, and if I did he'd be lucky to get the scarf for next winter.  I did wind some of the yarn for Heather into balls, it is a very nice, handdyed (I think) superwash 100% merino in the lovely lavender of the picture  .  The instructions looked like fun, a little challenging but not too bad.  I can't wait to get started, so I should get off the computer and finish that scarf!  Hopefully I'll have some progress pics to post soon.    Great Shopping Day  We had a 50% off an item coupon for our local  urlLink Half Price Books .  Ours usually carries a fairly good selection of computer and console games, so we went to check out that section.  Didn't find anything much there, but I also poked around in the Arts and Crafts area and came away with the first edition of Jacqueline Fee's Sweater Workbook for $4, and  the Woolworks book with Starmore's Marina cardigan in it for $5.  I love adding cheap books to my knitting library.  Then we went to Best Buy and bought   Jak II, and Dave has barely let me watch television since.  Which is a little distracting, since I find myself watching him play the game instead of concentrating on my knitting, which is what I usually do while watching TV.

      Still plugging away on the scarf, the second sock and have resisted the urge to start anything new.  I really, really want to make the White Lies Designs sweater as my next large project so I hope the kit arrives soon or else I just may succumb to the temptation of starting a Silk Garden shawl that I have sitting in my stash.  My knitting time consists of breaks and lunch at work, and an hour or so in the evenings so if I try to do too much all at once, nothing ever gets done.  I'm kinda stalled on the GAAA.  Since I messed up that one square and had to rip it out, I haven't had any desire to return.  Hopefully absence will make the heart grow fonder and all that.  Hey Anne, thank you very much for your kind comments about my blog, I started out writing this for me as an online diary, and I think it's pretty cool that other people find it interesting also.  Anne also asked about the needle I'm using for my DNA scarf.  I know it's pretty old, since I've had it since before I stopped knitting 15 years ago, it's an all plastic circular needle, I believe Susan Bates.  The yarn moves smoothly without going too slow or fast.  I was using metal Boye needles on the Faina's scarf and those worked pretty well too.  I haven't tried wood, or bamboo with this yarn.    At work today, the hospital manager (my direct supervisor) was called in for a chat with the head vet.  He proceeded to tell her that he didn't like the way we take our breaks together, doesn't like that we read, or knit or lay out on the grass behind the building during our breaks and lunch.   Fortunately, the hospital manager said she doesn't care what we do on our breaks, since it's our free time.  Nor does she see a problem with us taking those breaks, since nobody can work 8 straight hours a day without a minute or two to sit down and relax.  This would be the same job where I haven't had a raise in two years because of the budget situation, so I think he should just shut the hell up and be glad we're still willing to remain employed by the city government and haven't bailed to work in private industry or something.

       Opal Strong Heel #1 is finished    If you look closely you can see the start of #2, which is going to be a fraternal twin, I like socks that are close, but they don't have to match.  Quirky, like me.   IThe heel didn't add as much length as it looked like to me the other day.  When I actually put it on, it fit just fine.  I really like the way the strong heel keeps the patterning going down the foot, I have another pair planned in a blue "fair isle" Socka yarn, when I get #2 done.   DNA Scarf  While waiting for my sweater kit from  urlLink White Lies Designs  (which is the next "big" thing I want to start), I've been working on _ Dr. Montville's Double Helix Seaman Scarf_ for my boyfriend, Dave.  This is a "free" pattern which can be found  urlLink here .    He wanted a scarf he could wear under his jacket to keep his neck and chin warm on his motorcycle.  I had made him a basketweave design scarf, out of something acrylic, it was the first thing I made when I picked up the needles again after my 15 year hiatus.  It turned out too bulky and too short, he wears it anyway, but I wanted to make him another one that worked exactly the way he wanted.    The picture of the closeup pattern is very washed out, I don't know why my camera does that, and I'm not camera savvy enough to fix it.  The photo on the left is a better color representation of the dark navy blue, but it's just a blob as far as the patterning goes.  I've reached the halfway point of the neck ribbing.       I did add several repeats to the cable pattern portion.  Dave asked for a scarf between six and seven feet, so he can make several wraps around his neck and face.  The yarn is Le Fibre Nobili Tajmajal, which I got from  urlLink Elann .  It's a 70% Merino, 22% Silk, and 8% Cashmere blend, and it is soft and light.  The cables show up very nicely, which is a relief, since I tried to use the same yarn in a different color for  urlLink  Faina's Scarf   and it didn't do so well with the lace patterning.  I may make myself a DNA scarf, or a  different cable pattern to use up the three balls of red I bought for me.

       Sweater Officially Complete  I like the way it turned out, it looks great with shorts and a tank top underneath.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out while I was sewing it together, but I ran it thru the wash and the floats tightened up and evened out.  I still don't think I will ever knit anything with this yarn again.  It's Cotton-Ease by Lion Brand, and it was tough on the hands, split like crazy, and probably won't hold up too well.  That's ok, it was a learning experience, I finally conquered the mattress stitch.  Which shouldn't be a surprise, since it's pretty similar to some of the suture patterns I use at work.    Photo by Dave, in his ever so artistic, "Batman school of cinematography".  I also taught myself how to knit without dropping the needle and using my right hand to pick up the yarn and wrap it around the needle for every stitch.  I finally worked out the yarn over the right forefinger, tensioned around the pinky.  I also figured out Continental, but it makes my hands hurt.  Purling no problem at all, knitting I get a cramp.  So, now when I get around to that Dale sweater I'll be able to do the fair isle easier.   Opal Sock  I'm on the toe decreases on the first sock.  Looks pretty good so far.  I will have to remember for the next pair, not to make the top so long.  The pattern suggests 7", which is ok for a standard top down pattern, the strong heel adds extra length to that so they look huge to me.  It doesn't look like I'm going to run out of yarn or anything, I just prefer a shorter leg.  Robbyn asked how much Opal it takes to make a sock for a size 10 woman's foot.   I've made two full pairs besides this one with Opal.  The other two pairs had stitch patterns and I had a decent sized ball of leftover yarn on both.  This is with a 7" cuff and leg, standard heel turning  and a 10" foot.    Bedtime  Ok, guys.  Where are we supposed to sleep?

       Sweater's done... well almost  The knitting is officially over, and I have one half sewn together.  I'll work on the other half today and then wash and block it and post a picture later this week.  I think it's going to look ok, this will be the last time I ever use that yarn, and possibly the last time I work with worsted weight.  I've found I much prefer DK and sport weight.    I've got two pairs of socks on the needles right now, the Opal Brasil Strong Heel socks    which have made it past the heel turning onto the never ending foot (size 10), and the second sock of the Mini Mogul Bobble Anklet which is also onto the foot part.  That pattern had a variation of the short row heel, where instead of wrapping the stitches you pick up a strand (like a M1) and knit it together with the short row slipped stitch.  I don't like that method as much as the wrapped one, but it is interesting to learn all the different ways to do the same thing.  I ordered this:   from  urlLink Bea Ellis Knitwear    I just love the sweater on the cover and am going to have to do it one of these days.   I'm planning to get the yarn there too, it's Dale Svale and I've heard very nice things.  I want to check out the pattern first, and decide what size I am.    I also ordered this kit:   from  urlLink White Lies Designs .  I originally saw it in the new  urlLink KnitPicks.com   catalog, and thought "that looks like one of Joan's designs".  The designer wasn't credited in the catalog, however, when I looked it up online there she was.  So I eliminated the middle man and bought it direct.  I also have a huge box of sock yarn calling my name.  Somehow between two sock of the month clubs and ordering straight from  urlLink  Germany  I have over 20 pairs just waiting to be made.  I also have several shawl patterns and yarn, and several sport weight cotton sweater patterns and yarn.  Can anyone tell I organized my stash closet last night?  Our roommate is buying a house with his girlfriend, and I have dibs on his room for a sewing/knitting/computer/TV haven.  Dave doesn't care, the downstairs bedroom already has his painting table set up with all his miniatures spread all over.  Now we'll each have our own "studio".

       Coming into the Home Stretch  I have about 15 more rows to do on the sweater.  Then wash and block and move onto my least favorite part, sewing it together.  I don't know why I dread it so much, I just do.  The Opal Sock is moving right along.  I'm about an inch before the heel turning.  This tells me I've spent way too much time in front of the computer the last few days.  Most of it was probably last night while hiding from the trick or treaters.  We had a party to go to, so I didn't get any candy for the kiddies.    The next Knitting Guild meeting is on Tuesday, this one is on Fibers, What Are They And How Will They Affect My Sweater?  Should be interesting.  I've pretty much got my choice narrowed down to a medium blue DK weight superwash wool that I have in my stash, but I'm still open to other options.  Here's a Halloween Cross Stitch.  The cat's heads are painted buttons.

      Getting ready to head out for JC and Kim's New Year's Eve party.  Dave is making some rolls for the potluck and the whole house smells like cheesy-garlic bread.  I hope he stashes them in the trunk or they might not make it to the dinner table.  I finished the beading on Celtic Spring, she's currently bathing in Orvus, I'll probaby wait until tomorrow to rinse and iron and get some pics.  I'm really, really happy that's over with.  My tastes have changed considerably and finishing the stitching on such a huge piece that you aren't really enjoying anymore is a chore.  She'll look great over the mantel with her companion Celtic Christmas that I finished in 1998 or thereabouts.  I've got almost the whole boring part of the front of Heather done, I can't wait for the shortrowing and reverse stockinette to start.  All this back and forth stockinette is killing me, at least it's mindless and I can read or watch TV while doing it.  Current Read:      Cover Her Face by P.D. James.  I don't know how I feel about this book, it started out not very interesting, I just couldn't get into the setting and I could have cared less about the characters.  I was forced to continue reading, since I hadn't brought anything else with me, and I can't eat lunch without something to read.  I'm about halfway through, and interest has picked up a little now that there has been a death and the investigation has started, but it's not really my cup of tea.  I'll probably finish since I've gotten this far, but don't think I will be reading anymore of Ms. James' offerings.  Just Finished:     Deathstalker Rebellion: Being the Second Part of the Life and Times of Owen Deathstalker by Simon R. Green.  As I said before I love this series.  This one picks up where the second left off, at the start of the rebellion.  I've read books one thru three before but lost four in a move so I'm rereading the first three again.  I see on  urlLink  Amazon.com   that there are two more books in the series now, using descendants of the original characters.  Woo hoo!  I just don't know what to say:

      Happy Holidays to one and all!  We went to see Bad Santa tonight.  This goes on my list as the new "best Christmas movie ever."*  I was very surprised at the number of people who had the same idea, the theater was jam packed.  I was also surprised by the number of people who brought their small children with them.  One man got up and left with his son after the first "F*ck me Santa" line.  What was he thinking, it was a remake of It's a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street?  Is it really that difficult to get a babysitter or that expensive?  Or hey, how about taking the kids to see an age appropriate movie?  It's Christmas people, get a clue, it's not about you, it's about your kids.  Reason 841 why I'm not having any, I never have to stand in line at the mall to visit Santa.  The graphics in Disgaea are elementary, but it adds to the charm.  It is a tactical RPG, like Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Battle, or Shining Force (if you remember that far back).  The story line is not integral to the game, so far we've built our characters up to level 15-20 just by playing around in the Item World area and have only done four or five of the missions.  There are a number of different character choices you can unlock, and I see massive ongoing and replay value since you aren't locked into a story arc.  That was my major disappointment with Final Fantasy X, not being able to just wander off and do stuff that isn't plot related.  Got all the cross stitch done on Celtic Spring, and am onto the beading which should be completed within a week or two.  Pictures will be posted, it's taken me three years to complete, mostly because I got sidetracked with numerous other projects of the moment.  Zedd and Morty say hi:    Willow** has gone to live with her daddy and his girlfriend in their new house.   We miss her and hope she adjusts well to living with their other cat, and two dogs.  It took her almost six months to feel comfortable around our greyhound, who pretty much ignores the cats and spends his time laying around in classic greyhound sleep mode.  Kim has two Belgian Tervurens who are much more active and more interested in the cats.  So far Willow has spent the first week living under the bed in the master bedroom.    *that would be replacing Silent Night, Deadly Night   **We were babysitting Willow for JC, while he did project work outside of Texas.  We've been roommates for over three years, so Willow became part of our family.

      I joined up for the  urlLink Great Stash Redistribution Project , I'm number 7 or 8 on the Fair Isle list.  The boxes have been shipped and I can't wait for the first one to arrive at my house.  This is exciting, hopefully there will be some interesting yarns to fondle.  I finished the back of Heather sweater yesterday, and got the first four rows of the front done today.  Not much knitting time, we got a new video game in the mail - Disgaea for the Playstation, and boy is it time consuming.  I got sucked in tonight after work and played for something like three hours straight.  I've also been working on my  urlLink Celtic Spring  cross stitch.  That link goes to the designer's site, I've changed mine a little so it isn't exactly as pictured.  I'm almost done with the stitching portion, then I have to do the beading portion of the design.  Marilyn goes a bit overboard with the beads, I think there are a couple of hundred of them.  I also signed up for  urlLink Chatelaine Martina Weber's  latest mystery stitch.  She creates the most fabulous, intricate designs and presents them in a 6 or 12 month mystery format, only revealing a small portion of the design monthly.  I ordered the kit with the threads and fabric from  urlLink European Cross Stitch .  I have the kit and pattern for the  urlLink 2003 mystery  but have yet to put a stitch into the fabric.  I'm hoping to actually do the 2004 mystery as it is released, since it's not so much of a mystery if you wait until everyone else is already done.  I finished Wolves of the Calla today, I was not expecting the ending at all.  Very interesting.  I don't want to post anything that would spoil it, so I'm not going to say any more.  I can't wait to see what King does in the next two books.  I'm thinking about rereading the series again from the beginning, since I didn't remember some of the events mentioned in Wolves that I knew had been detailed in the earlier books.  I'm currently reading     Queen of the Blood by Anne Bishop.  If you're a fan of Tanith Lee, you need to read this trilogy.  This is the third book in the series, and I find myself wishing that the author had made it a quartet, or a decalogy.  It's dark and bloody, and full of demons but in a good way.

      Check this out:     it's Dale Svale yarn for   Dale Hawaii from  urlLink Bea Ellis Knitwear  which is going to be my next major sweater project* and my very first Fair Isle.  I'm hoping to get Heather finished before starting Hawaii, but the box in the closet is calling out to me.  "Swatch me, Swatch me".   I can't say enough nice things about the service from Bea Ellis, she contacted me quickly to let me know my order was in stock, shipped it fast and even sent a little gift     Heather is coming along, I've decided that since I can't face ripping out again that I will finish her up, making whatever adjustments I can, and if she doesn't fit - I'll give her away or something.  Chalk it up to a learning experience, than someday in the future maybe try again.  I also placed an order from  urlLink  Elann   for some of the Peruvian Baby Silk and  Baby Cashmere.  Probably for socks and a moebius scarf.  That hasn't arrived yet, hopefully before Xmas but probably after.   * I'm not counting my guild Sweater 101 class project    Still Reading: Current Read:     Wolves of the Calla by Stephen King.  I really like the way King is getting references to most (if not all) of his past works in, from a simple mention to entire characters bodily transported.  I'm sad there are only going to be two more Dark Tower books, they are my favorite of King's works.  Just Finished:     Shopaholic Ties The Knot by Sophie Kinsella.  I do read more than one book at a time, especially if I have one I want to savor or when I need a quick light read.  This one fit both bills, it was a light comedic read, that gave me an afternoon of fun.  In the Shopaholic series Sophie Kinsella tells the story of a young woman Becky Bloomwood who has a serious shopping problem.  She maxes out her credit cards, hides from her bank manager, and gets caught in enormous lies.  Of course, it all works out in the end.  In this, the third in the series, Becky is getting married, but not before she plans two weddings complete with all the trimmings, one at NY's Plaza hotel, and one back home in the Cotswalds.  Unable to say no to anyone, with the wedding planner from hell, she doesn't know just what to do.    Just Watched:      I Am Sam - the story of a mentally handicapped man played by Sean Penn, who has to fight to keep his daughter out of the hands of child services.  I found parts of this movie annoying, and overly sentimental.

      Heather is rapidly turning into the "sweater from hell".  I swatched and measured, and got gauge.  I started knitting.  My gauge changed from knitting the swatch so I started over.  With new needles, I'm slightly off on row gauge, but spot on for stitch gauge.  But... I think I wasn't paying attention and may have started the wrong size.  It looks like it is going to be too small if I continue on as I'm going.  I am going to go downstairs with some pins, and measure the hell out of it.  If it is the wrong size, I think I will wad it up in the closet for a while and start something else.    I had this size ephiphany at the monthly Day Knitters meeting, where I also realized I had left my tape measure on the coffee table at home, so since I had nothing else to work on, I left early.  It wasn't a totally lost cause, meetings are held at  urlLink  Central Market  so I did a little shopping before I drove home.  I picked up some red wine and mulling spices for my potluck dish to take to Kim and JC's New Year's Eve party.  I figure why be boring? Who needs another casserole, and beer is just too easy.    I also scored a quart of green tea ice cream, my absolute favorite flavor usually only available from Japanese restaurants.  Low carb bread for me and a loaf of Artisan sourdough for Dave and a bunch of other goodies.  It's a good thing I'm only in there once a month, or we'd go broke!  Current Read:     Wolves of the Calla by Stephen King.  Not too shabby, not as good as Wizard and Glass, but it is coming along nicely in the 100 or so pages I've read.  Just Finished :    Deathstalker by Simon R. Green.  Great space opera.  Book 1 in a series of 5.  Aristocrat gets exiled by the empress, so she can have him followed as he leads her directly to the Darkvoid Device, a particularly nasty weapon.  Aristocrat travels the galaxy, picking up a mismatched band of rebels and outlaws to further his cause.  I loved this book, I can't wait to see what happens in book 2.

      Got an envelope in the mail from New Zealand yesterday, inside was this:   three skeins of soft, warm Merino and Fur yarn, made of 30% possum and 70% merino wool.  This is going to make some nice, warm gloves.  Good thing too, it's just about cold enough around here to wear gloves when walking the dog.  Robbyn asked about webhosting, I'm using  urlLink Web Hosting Buzz .  The prices are reasonable and the service has been very good so far.  If you need a mailing list, well, we can't seem to get it working.  Not sure why, but it wasn't that important, I was just going to do a favor for my friends on our small booklist to get us off of Yahell.  We have another alternative though, so all is not lost.

      Having a hell of a time trying to configure a mailing list thru my new webhost.  Darn it, this is supposed to be easy, it's one of the reasons I chose the hosting company that I did.  Not working very hard on Heather or Purple Stripe sock, don't really like the pattern of the sock yarn, still not enough purple.  Finished the first skein on Heather, which gives me about 7 inches or so knit in plain stockinette with a garter stitch border.    Squawkbox appears to be down, so no commenting.

      Finished the final ornament in this years  urlLink Chartswappers   stitchalong.  Shepherds Watched by Shepherd's Bush Printworks, this is from the 2002 Just Cross Stitch Ornament edition.       Did a little dance of joy, since I can now go back to my regularly scheduled no-deadline stitching.    Day off today, so we went to Walmart and bought a bunch of things for the craft room.  I got a bookcase to store my junk, a couple of totes to store my yarns, and a leopard print set of dishes.  Ok, that's not for the craft room, but I couldn't resist, I've wanted new dishes for quite a while, there was a barnyard set that I loved dearly, but when I was finally ready to purchase... discontinued.  So this time, I saw some I liked and insisted that we get them on the spot!

      I bought a website, since I don't really believe in getting something for nothing, and I wasn't really happy with the free Angelfire site that I had, since it required me to put all kinds of advertising all over the place, and I was going to run out of space pretty soon.    I think I've got the blog transferred over, at least most of it appears to be working, I may still have some bugs to work out. The new address is  urlLink http://www.wildlycrafty.com/weblog.html   I'm going to be working on getting my other pages updated and transferred, and hopefully adding a couple of new ones as I have the time.  This afternoon I had jury duty.  While I believe in doing my civic duty, it always turns out to be an afternoon of sitting around and waiting and never being chosen to sit on an actual jury.  Well, that's not exactly true, I was chosen once, but they settled out of court, so I never actually got to see the inside of a courtroom.  I don't know what it is about me, I suspect it's because I'm a city employee that I don't get chosen.  Lawyers see the uniform and it freaks them out.  In knitting news, I've worked a bit more on Heather, and started a Magic Stripes sock.  The sock doesn't have as much purple as I'd hoped, oh well, it's not like I don't have a huge box of sock yarns with several purple ones waiting for me.

      The Guild Holiday party was very nice.  People brought all kinds of food and drinks, one woman brought christmas cookies in the shape of little sweaters. There was a near miss when a can of Coke was accidently spilled near a knitting bag (no, not by me), fortunately all her important stuff was wrapped in plastic and only the outside got a little damp.   In the grab bag exchange I got a wicker basket with 5 skeins of Anny Blatt 100% Alpaga yarn.  Now I just have to figure out what to make with it.    I'm thinking probably not a hat since I really don't wear them, but maybe mittens or a scarf.  I don't know if the person who got my offering was too pleased, she's a crocheter and doesn't know how to knit, and her face wasn't too happy when she pulled out the sock yarn and tiny needles.    I worked on my blue socks some more, I'm almost at the heel turning on the second sock.    I really like the Strong Heel, it fits comfortably and the self patterning yarns are barely interrupted.  I feel several more pairs in my future.  Next up will be the Lion Brand Magic Stripe yarn in the purple color.  One of the guild guests actually said to me, "I couldn't knit socks, I wouldn't have the patience".  I so wanted to retort, "you're wearing an intricate cabled sweater and you wouldn't have the patience to knit socks?  That's about the only thing I have the patience to knit these days!"  Heather sweater is on the backburner, at least thru the holidays.  Kitties don't want me to go to work, so they've stolen my uniform jackets:

      Just finished moving all the computer stuff into the empty bedroom, now I just have to finish moving all the craft stuff into the enormous closet and get a comfy chair and I'm all set.  I managed to spill soda on my keyboard before we left for the in-laws, thought I'd cleaned it all up, but when we got home all my keyboard would do is type zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Annoying, and not at all conducive to doing anything productive.  So I bought a new one.  It's nice, but I'm going to have to get used to it, since it doesn't have the "feel" of the old one.  Finished the second Brasil sock, started a new pair and got one finished.  It's a pretty blue and white stripey fake fair isle self patterning yarn.  Don't remember what kind, the ball band is in the other room.  No picture since I've misplaced the camera in the moving.    Thanksgiving was very nice, not as many people showed us as originally expected.  Which is a good thing, since I'm not into crowds, and they are all of Dave's family members that I don't know very well.  Including the aunt that he doesn't really like very much.  So, no big loss there.  Robbyn was talking on  urlLink  her blog   about video games.  Dave and I are very much gamers, and recently joined  urlLink Gamefly  where we can rent games to try out, and keep them as long as we like for a set fee a month.  We don't have a good selection of rental games at any of the video stores near us, so this sounds like a great idea.  We'll see what happens.   The first two games that we rented are both for GameCube but aren't exclusives.  Simpsons Hit and Run and Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy.  Both of them have been a blast so far.  The Simpsons game is a take off of Grand Theft Auto, without as much violence and blood.  Dave likes this one a lot.  I have been enjoying the heck out of the Cursed Mummy, I think I'm about a third of the way thru, and I only started playing on Saturday.  Next up is Sword of Mana for the Game Boy.  Katie asked about Star Santa.  He's from the 2002 Just Cross Stitch Ornament Magazine.  I got my mag from  urlLink  Elegant Stitch.   All of the ornaments I've featured over the past couple of months on my blog are from this magazine.  I'm doing a 12 month ornament stitch-a-long with  urlLink  Chartswappers Yahoo Group .  Only one more to go, and while I had fun, I'm glad it's almost over.  It's a great group, mainly for swapping cross stitch charts and supplies, but there are also several other activities like the stitch-a-long, exchanges and bingo.  Tomorrow my knitting guild is having its annual Christmas party.  I bought a skein of Lion Brand Magic Stripe and a set of needles for the grab bag exchange.  I also bought a skein for me, since that's one of the sock yarns I haven't tried yet. Should be fun, this is my first guild party, so I don't know what to expect.

      Just got an email that the   urlLink  GSRP  box   is on its way here from Houston.  I can't wait, it looks like there is some really good stuff to be had.  I have a little pile that I've been making of things to put into the box, I can't believe how much I've bought and changed my mind about.  Or overbought, I must be really paranoid about running out with project leftovers I've been discovering.  I finished sock one of the unknown yarn from Germany.  (I think it might be Twister)     and started on one with a cabled leg, from the latest issue of Knit n' Style.  I think this is the only pattern from that magazine that I've seen that I would actually knit.  Needless to say, my subscription will not be renewed for another year.  The yarn is called Zimba Top and it is actually maroon in color.  *    that's a k2b rib, and one pattern repeat of the sixteen  row cable pattern.  Played more Ratchet and Clank, I'm about halfway through, but now I'm working on picking up all the skill points and Platinum bolts, so I haven't been working on the storyline.  Gibberish unless you're a gamer, I know.    Current Read:           *The lighting sucks in the computer room and it's way too late for natural light.  Besides that, I'm a lousy photographer.

      I have just not been able to keep up with blogging lately.  Not too much is going on in my life worth noting.  I've been sucked into another video game, Ratchet and Clank Going Commando:         between that and work, I haven't had time to do much of anything else.  I'm still working on redoing the back of Heather.  Fortunately it looks like this time is the charm, if I had to do it over again, I think it would end up wadded up in a ball at the back of the closet with cats sleeping on it.  It's not a hard pattern, the endless expanses of stockinette make me wish I had a machine, they are very, very boring.  But all in all, once it's done it will be a very pretty sweater which I will be happy to wear.  I'm also still going on the sock, since I stay up late playing video games I don't watch TV in bed or read so it doesn't get worked on too much.  Common Ground is coming along too, no new pictures, since there isn't much change from the last one.  We went and saw Big Fish the other day.  I don't know what to make of this movie.  It's not the usual dark, moody Tim Burton fare.  I'm not big on magical realism in books, and this movie was chock full, It's not that I didn't like it.  I don't agree with the reviewers who have called it total crap.  It's just not going to make my top 10 list, but it was worth seeing, and I don't feel like I wasted my money.  Of course, nobody chanted "Fuck Me, Santa" either, so that may have something to do with my ambiguity.

      Here's a pic of the front of Heather, which I finished the other day.  I am going to have to redo the back.  That's ok, it's more mindless knitting which I can do at work without worrying I'm going to lose my place on the chart.  The color is really washed out on this photo, the yarn is actually a much nicer lavender heather.     In cross stitch I've been working on the Common Ground sampler by  urlLink Just Nan .  It will look like this when I've finished:    Right now after about 20 hours I've got this:    I'm doing it in the silk threads and it is very luxurious to work on.

      This week has been very rough at work.  I think the head vet has finally lost his mind.  He scheduled a major procedure every day, and then expected us to have the place completely cleaned up and restocked for an interview he was doing on Friday.  Fat chance.  We're lucky to get the equipment cleaned up that we need for the following day, and all the samples sent out to the various labs, let alone get the windows done and have everything "prettied" up for company.  Maybe he's forgotten we're shorthanded, because the city in its infinite wisdom chose to take away not one, but two, of our keeper positions.  Not much to speak of on the crafty front.  Part 1 of the mystery is stitched.     Started another pair of socks, don't remember what the yarn is, I accidentally threw out the ball band.  The front of Heather is almost done, I'm still not sure if I'm going to have to redo the back or not.  If I do, I'll probably start something else and take a break from Heather for a short while.

      Grrr.  Yesterday my supervisor signed me up for a city required defensive driving class, and the instructor decided that he wanted to go home early, so the class only took six hours (minimum required by state law) but he only gave us one five minute break, and thirty minutes for lunch.  Today we had another emergency, so no breaks, and a thirty minute lunch.  It wouldn't be so annoying if I got paid for overtime, but I get comp time instead.  Great in theory, if you ever get to take the comp time, not so great if it just adds up and adds up.  Needless to say, I was too tired and stressed to get much done on any of my current projects.  I did start and pull out two socks on two circs several times.  The first time I picked a pattern that wouldn't work, the other times I wasn't happy about the way it was looking at the join.  I did finish my Magic Stripe socks, and just barely made it too.  I'd read where if you have largeish feet you might need two balls, and they weren't kidding.  I only had a few yards left over, way less than any other sock yarn I've ever used.       Thursday night Dave and I took a Hands On Sushi making class run by our local  urlLink Central Market.   What fun, we learned how to make the sticky sushi rice, and how to roll with the nori (seaweed) as the outside of the roll, and also inside out (rice then nori).  We made five different rolls, and were served Miso soup too, so it was dinner and a class.  We signed up for the advanced sushi class, and also a cheesecake class.  That's not going to be so good for my diet, but who says you shouldn't live a little every so often.  Just Finished :      First contact with a twist.  I've liked most of what I've read by Sawyer, this one isn't as good as the Neanderthal Parallex series, but it has its moments.

      Wow, I've barely had a minute to myself the past week.  We had several emergencies at work that required overtime, and I haven't had much of a chance to do more at the computer than try to keep up with email.  That wouldn't be so hard, except that I belong to several high-traffic lists, and sometimes end up deleting more than I read.  Last night was the  urlLink Dallas Hand Knitters Guild  meeting.  We were supposed to start our sweater project but the instructor was sick, so we did the business meeting, visited a little and showed off our projects.  I always forget to bring anything for show and tell, so all I had was my Magic Stripe sock and my sweater swatch.  I'm using the sock as a learning experience, I switched to two circular needles instead of double points.  I like the way it flows, but think I'm going to have to get some different circs, the joins on these (Susan Bates) is not so great.  And now for the pictures.  As promised, a picture of my finished Celtic Spring.  I changed the top section, where the word "Spring" stretches across, from the original.  I didn't like the way the designer had charted the "G" plopped ontop of the right side motif.  This was the first time I'd had the nerve to make a major change to a charted piece and it opened up a world of possibilities.  This took me about three years to stitch, mainly because I got sucked into trying a rotational system, where I had ten or more projects going at a time, worked on them for ten hours and then picked up the next thing.  That led to almost nothing ever getting finished unless it was very small.     And here is the first thing that I started and finished in 2004.  Jump for Joy by  urlLink Just Nan .       In knitting I'm still working on the Heather sweater, I haven't posted any pictures because it really isn't very interesting.  Great swaths of lilac sportweight yarn in stockinette stitch.  I've just started the top portion where there is some shaping but it still isn't picture worthy.  Maybe when I'm done.  This is taking forever to make because I don't have any time, it is on size 3 (US) needles and I'm mostly working on it at work on lunch and breaks.  I'm also still working on Magic Stripe sock #2, which is my bedtime and travel project, so that is going really slowly too.  When I'm done with it, I want to figure out the two socks on two circs thing, and then I can make a pair at a time, which sounds less boring.  I'm off to donate blood.  Hopefully they have the good juice, I don't like the orange as much as the cranberry.

      As a vet tech I get to work with all the different animals at the zoo, but usually only during medical procedures where they are sedated for everyone's safety.  I don't get the chance to have the day to day interaction of the routine feeding and cleaning that the keepers have.  Sometimes when we are shorthanded on keeper staff we get to fill in.    Today was one of those days.  I was assigned to care for the Giant Anteater who has become the hospital mascot.  She's elderly, has heart disease and chronic foot problems, so she's been a hospital resident for over a year.  Gussy is quite a character.   She is very much a diva, very set in her ways, and you can see her become peeved if she isn't fed on _her_ schedule.  Unfortunately we can't exactly replicate the diet she would eat in the wild, termite and ant mounds are hard to come by in a zoo setting.  So instead, she gets a ground up mixture of dry cat food, insectivore pellets, mealworms, canned cat food, protein powder and fruit-flavored baby food.  This gets mixed with water and blended until smooth.  She also gets a can of cat food with her meds, and a banana or avocado as a novelty food.  Gussy likes to sleep late, she only gets up from her hay bed when you open her stall door with food bowl in hand.  Then she has a good stretch, chows down on her canned cat food and waits until you get out the hose to clean and refill her water bowl.  One of her favorite things is to drink straight from the hose.    I also assisted with Pet the Spider Monkey who is recovering from surgery.  She is on intravenous fluids and antibiotics, so she has to be kept in a smaller enclosure than she would normally have, so that we can maintain her catheter.  Monkeys are messy, so she needs to have her blankets changed several times a day.  Pet is very food motivated, which makes it easy to handle her, as she can be easily distracted with treats.  I really enjoyed hand feeding Pet, and getting a chance to work with Gussy, there are some days that I barely even get to see an animal, just their various blood and fecal samples.

      Went out to dinner and drinks last night at the  urlLink  Old Monk   with most of the vet department and several of the guys from the reptile department.  The Old Monk has about a million kinds of beer on tap and in bottles, it was hard to choose.  I tried a Black Velvet, which was pear cider and Guinness.  Very tasty.  The food was pretty good for "bar food", and the company was excellent.  Today I'm home impatiently waiting for UPS to drop off my  urlLink  Daylight Lamp .  I've wanted a nice magnifying lamp for a long time, and Shirley from  urlLink Country Cottage  said she'd pick one up for me at the Nashville Trade Show so I could save a few bucks.

      I realized I haven't mentioned anything to do with work lately, which is probably a good thing, since it means nothing out of the ordinary has been happening.    Today was a pretty typical day, in the morning we did a dental exam on one of our aged mandrill baboons.  He was chewing funny and acting like he had a toothache.  Of course you can't just walk up to a baboon and ask him to open his mouth so you can check out his fangs.      First you have to administer a sedative by dart, then rush back to the hospital to get him onto gas anesthesia before he wakes up enough to object.  Our veterinary dentist took a look and it was determined that he had a tooth root abscess of one of his premolars.  After further discussion, the vets decided that it would be better to remove the tooth, since Roger is pretty old (28) and it might bother him more to try to do a endodontic procedure.  That might or might not save the tooth, but which certainly would require him to be anesthetized several more times, which at his age probably wouldn't be entirely safe.  In the afternoon, one of the rhinos needed a blood sample.  She's been feeling a little bit under the weather, and the vet wanted to check her electrolyte balance and iron levels.  You might think it would be hard to get a blood sample from a 2500 pound animal and it would be if she didn't feel like cooperating.  Fortunately all our rhinos have been conditioned to allow us to do simple medical procedures with target training and food rewards.  So with enough carrots and scratching Chula stood quite still and didn't even flinch when I inserted the needle.    Other than that I spent the rest of the day in the lab packing up samples that had been collected over the weekend to go out to various reference laboratories.  At lunch I finished up the last inch of my Guild sweater and worked on a pair of socks on two circs.  Unfortunately I'm running out of yarn and am going to have to go buy another ball.  Fortunately it's variegated, so if the dye lot doesn't match exactly it's probably not going to matter all that much.  Current Read:

      Have any of you seen the Spring issue of Knitter's magazine?  What the fuck is up with this?      I really hope this is someone's idea of a joke.  That is about the ugliest, most tacky thing I have ever seen.  Nobody, but nobody would look good in that.  I've seen $2 whores  in classier outfits.  What a waste of linen.    That's the very first pattern after all the editorial stuff.  I'm really glad I wasn't drinking a cup of coffee while leafing through the mag.  There's a white tank top and a coral sweater that are getting post-it note reminders for later possibles, but I'm seriously considering gluing pages 40 - 44 together so I never have to look at this abomination again.

      Only four inches to go on part one of the Guild sweater   I need to have it finished by the next meeting on 3/2, so I can do the drop stitch false seam thing.  I've completely stopped working on Heather until I get the Guild sweater done.  I just have the sleeves and finishing to do on Heather and then I can start on Dale Hawaii.  I'm really looking forward to doing colorwork.     I still hear the siren song of the X-Box, we are still playing most evenings, pretty close to the ending of Baldur's Gate 2.  I really like this game, and want to play it again with one of the other character choices.   I did finish Chatelaine Mystery 6 Part II:    with a little time to spare before part III is released on 3/1.  I've also finished the outer border of Common Ground and started work on the inner border and motifs:

      I would have posted sooner but we bought an X-Box for Valentine's Day, and have done nothing but play video games, go to work, eat and sleep for the past three days.  Baldur's Gate II is awesome.  Two player, cooperative play can keep me and Dave occupied for hours.    Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for the Game Cube isn't as good in multi-player mode.  One of you has to carry this stupid bucket, and you can't do anything else while holding it, but if you put it down bad things can happen.  So basically, you end up with one character doing all the work and one holding a bucket.  Not so much fun for the bucket holder.  Yeah, you can switch off, but still I think it is kinda stupid and pointless.  In single player mode, they give you a moogle to carry the bucket.  I like it better as a single player game.  Absolutely nothing to show for myself on the crafting front.  Probably won't have anything for at least another week until the new wears off the X-Box or we finish Baldur's Gate.   Yoga class tomorrow night if I'm feeling up to it.  I'm still feeling under the weather, and am beginning to wonder if it's more than just a simple cold.  Day Knitter's group on Thursday, I might actually get something worked on since I can't take the video games out with me.

      Last night Dave and I did another cooking class.  This one was on Foolproof Cheesecakes, and he picked up a lot of tips and hints to make his cheesecakes come out better.  I don't know if I've mentioned it before, but I don't cook, it's not that I can't I just don't really enjoy it at all and Dave does, so he does all the cooking.    I must admit I was a little bored during class.  This class wasn't a hands-on, so there wasn't anything to do besides watch the instructor put stuff in a mixer and then pour it in a pan.  I go to the classes for the food, and because it's something Dave and I can do together.  She showed us a savory crab cheesecake, which would be used as an appetizer.  It was delicious, I've already requested it be made at home.  Next week I'm thinking of heading over to the local parks department yoga class.  I've never done yoga before, but I've heard good things, and I really need to get into a low impact exercise routine.  I liked the description of the class as non-competitive and suitable for beginners.  The price is right, twelve bucks, and I don't have to sign a contract.  Works for me!    Someone on one of my knitting lists made an offhand comment about people feeling the need to "manufacture knitting crises" for their blogs, just to have something to talk about.  Well, I don't know about you, but I have more than enough crises without having to manufacture anything.    The thing is, I'm not that experienced as a knitter, I learned when I was seven, made a few things during my childhood and young adult years and then stopped completely until last year* when I decided I wanted to make socks.  I had no idea that knitting had become the new yoga**, or the new black.  I had no idea that companies had come up with self patterning sock yarns.  All I wanted to do was have something small and portable that I could carry around and do with my hands.  It just snowballed from there, now I have closets full of yarns, and patterns and ideas coming out of my ears.    I don't sit still well with nothing to do, and I don't follow directions blindly.  Even when working from a pattern, I change things, be it short rowing the underarm area, or three needle bind off the shoulders or just plain tweaking.  That means that there are plenty of times I have to rip back or redo something that hasn't come out as planned.      *I turned 36 last September if that helps with the timeline. **I hate that I decided to pick up knitting again in the middle of a knitting revival that I knew nothing about, and I hate that I'm finally deciding to pick up a yoga class in the middle of a period where everything is being called the "new yoga".  I'm hoping that the fact that I am so incredibly untrendy is going to make both yoga and knitting uncool again.

      I've been so sick the past week, it must be the flu or something like it.   Needless to say I haven't felt like doing much of anything, and everything I've touched has been a disaster.  I threw the cable socks in the trash.  My first attempt* ended up being a little too small, which was ok, I hadn't put all that much work into it.  So I ripped back,  and decided to try the two socks on two circs thing again.  It worked great, until I realized that I had started doing a k1b, p1 rib instead of a k2b, p2 rib, which was making the top of the sock way huge.  Sleeves, they looked like sleeves not something that would go comfortably on a foot.  So I went to rip that out, and ended up with a huge tangled mess.  I'm still not sure exactly what I did, but I felt that I'd rather just toss the whole mess rather than worry about trying to straighten it out.  I have a whole closet full of sock yarn calling my name and I wasn't all that crazy about that color anyway.    So I dug around in my closet until I came across a couple of skeins of a funky, variagated yarn (also without a label)  which I'm going to make into the cable socks.  When I'm feeling better.  Right now I can manage a passable imitation of stockinette so I'm working on the mate to the unknown yarn blue sock.  I've got a few inches of Sweater 101 done, and am up to the armhole shaping on Heather.   I like the knitting in the round thing, this is the first time I've done that.  I'm pretty sweater challenged, I've only made a few mostly years ago, and never one in the round.  It makes for great mindless knitting, which is nice in the mornings at work when I have a few quiet moments before the day starts and I can knit and read.  Current Read:                      *I don't swatch for socks.  Plain ones I use a tried and true formula that fits me perfectly.  Patterned, I just go with the large woman's size (if there is one) and knit until I figure out if it's going to fit or not.  Usually works out just fine, sometimes I have to frog.  That's life.

      Friday there was a Fedex notice on the door.  Sorry we missed you, blah, blah, blah.  I couldn't think of what the package could be, so I kinda forgot about it.  They don't deliver on weekends or Monday, and Tuesday again, I missed the delivery.  Today is my day off, so I stayed home and waited.  Good thing, because this is what I was missing:     It's the  urlLink  GSRP Fair Isle    box I've been waiting for.  It never made the connection in my head that the box might be coming FedEx, I was expecting postal mail for some reason.  I'll be mailing the box tomorrow to Barb E, who is next on the list.  It will go USPS since her address is a PO box.  There is a bunch of great stuff in the box, and some not so great stuff too.  I won't list the entire contents but here's what I took out:   2 skeins of Regia Cotton sock yarn (like I need more sock yarn) and 8 skeins of Patons Fresco and a tank top pattern to go with them.  I put in a sock kit, some Brittany DPN's (which I break if I try to use them), and some other stuff.  Hope someone can use it.  Last night was the Guild meeting, and we started our Sweater 101 project.  I'm using Emu Superwash yarn in a medium blue.  I've got about three rows of ribbing done, and am supposed to have up to the armholes done by next meeting.  Looks like Heather is going to be put on the back burner for a while.    I also got a delivery from UPS today, which contained my belated Christmas gift of a Game Boy Advance player in onyx, the new style flip top version and  Sex and the City  Fifth Season  on DVD.

      I am so incredibly lazy, I have the I-cord for Heather all made up, but it's in my knitting bag which is downstairs and the sweater is upstairs, I keep forgetting to bring it up and I'm not about to make a special trip.  Maybe tomorrow.    I did finish my Magic Stripes socks.  This is in the Jellybean color, which is the one color combo I really like in the Magic Stripe yarns.  I have a thing for brightly colored socks, probably since my uniform is just so boring.  I don't like the way the yarn has all the little misdyed blotches.  Poor quality control.    I had to go buy another skein of yarn for the dog blanket.  I'm almost out of number two, and it's nowhere near square.  I know the dogs won't care, but it offends my sensibilities, so it's going to take a little longer than I thought to get them packed up and sent out.  I have a third one planned, but I think I'm going to do a slightly smaller size so it won't be as overwhelming!  Zedd is helping me blog:     Current Reads:

      Zedd is showing his support for the  urlLink Critter Knitters Knit-A-Thon  by "helping" me crochet a dog blanket.     It's Red Heart Super Saver yarn in a color I love in the skein.  It's pooling up in a really pretty pattern.  I think some yarn is meant to be crocheted, because I remember knitting something with this same yarn and it didn't look half as nice.

      I decided to jump right in and make a couple of blankets for  urlLink      I just taught myself how to crochet, and I figured this would be a good first project.  I've finished one so far, in a variegated purple, yellow, green, and blue yarn with a ruffly purple border.  It's in the wash right now, so I can't get a picture yet.  In my opinion, it came out pretty cute, I just hope the kitties like it.

      Well, it appears that perhaps the  urlLink GSRP Fair Isle   box may not have been absconded with after all.  It seems that it may be held hostage to a bad breakup.  The possessor promised to put it in the mail ASAP.  While I feel sorry for her that her relationship is breaking up/has broken up, she's had the box since February.  Plenty of time to get it to the post office and on it's way to the next victim.  At least I think so, but then I'm a heartless bitch so don't go by me.  Heather sweater is 99.9% complete.  I just need to make a different i-cord on larger needles, the first one was too stiff, and sew the beads onto the ends of it.  Wash and block the sweater and I'm done.    I also finished a glove made out of the wool/possum  blend yarn I got from trading with a woman in New Zealand last year     Glove making, at least in worsted weight yarn is much easier than I thought it would be.  Sure starting the fingers was a little fiddly, but overall, easy as pie.  Too bad I missed the two or three week window for wearing winter clothes in Dallas.  Well, at least they will be ready for next year, presuming of course, that I don't put them in a place so safe I never see them again.  Glove #2 is halfway completed, I've got the fingers and the thumb to do which shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.  Probably during Day Knitter's tomorrow.  You can't tell from the picture just how soft and cuddly this yarn is, I would love to make a sweater out of it, but it just doesn't get cold enough.  Today was finishing day, I also completed Part 3 of  urlLink Chatelaine Mystery 6 .   This piece is designed by Martina Weber of  urlLink  Chatelaine Designs      Now I just have to wait until April 1st for Part 4 to be released.  I'll work on my  urlLink  Common Ground Sampler  in the meantime.  Current Read:

      Ordered some Lorna's Laces yarn from  urlLink Threadbear Fibers Arts Studio .  I love that they discount the yarn, only charge actual shipping, and are extremely friendly and helpful. I'd heard good things, so I decided to give them a try.  Definately can recommend.   I bought Jungle (lime green and purple) and Lakeview (the more tasteful purple and blue)    I've almost finished Heather, no really, I have about 10 inches of I-cord to make and I have to sew it together and I'm done.  I probably won't get around to the finishing until Wed (my day off) since I'm usually too tired after work to work on anything that requires a fully functioning brain.  I'm going to do the possum yarn gloves as my next "serious" project and then start the Dale Hawaii sweater.  I also want to make a tank top out of the Paton's Fresco that I got from round 1 of the Great Stash Redistribution Project.   Speaking of the GSRP, I just read on  urlLink Amy's   website where the Fair Isle box has gone missing.  I hope the person who chose to STEAL all that lovely stash chokes on it.  How desperate do you have to be to steal yarn?  Shit, I'm in the Fair Isle list and I think the person who currently is holding onto the box is two people further down from me.  About 50% of the yarn was nasty acrylic when I saw it.  How desperate do you have to be to steal Red Heart?  Don't you have a Walmart you can shoplift from?  I sent an email, as did several other people, but she is using a throwaway freebie account, so she probably isn't even using it anymore.  It sucks when some people have to spoil the fun!

      Yoga was hard.  Probably because my idea of exercise is sitting on the couch, watching TV and knitting.  Hey, at least my fingers are moving.  Ok, I'm not really that bad, but I haven't done a structured exercise class in years.  I did enjoy it though, and am planning on continuing.  Maybe someday I'll be able to fold myself into a pretzel.

      Got the next part of the sweater instructions at the Guild meeting last night.  Now I have to decide whether I want to do drop shoulder or set in sleeves.  I'm inclined to do the more "difficult" option, in order to get the experience.  Am working on a toe up pair of LB Magic Stripe socks in Jellybean.  This is my second pair of Magic Stripe socks, and I don't think I'm going to do another one.  The dyeing is just awful, the colors are not cleanly demarcated, and there are huge blobs of the wrong color smack dab in the middle of a stretch of another color.  Don't think I can recommend this yarn.  Yoga tonight for sure.  Here's a EGA drawn thread class that I took last year.  I found this photo while cleaning up my files.  I like the effect on black, but it was a bitch to stitch!    Zedd is interested:

      In local news, some moron (or morons) decided not only to keep cobras as pets, but to allow them to escape into a Dallas apartment complex   urlLink Deadly Snake Still At Large   We have the smaller snake safely in confinement at the zoo, awaiting shipment to its new much more suitable home.  The larger one is still on the loose.     Along with everyone else in the known world, I've been watching with amusement the auction of the   urlLink  Guy in the Wedding Dress  on ebay.  I can't believe it's causing such a stir, over 4 million hits, he's been on TV, and at one point the (fake) bids were over $10 million.  Ebay security cleaned up that mess, but it's still going for $15,000 as of 4:30PM Central Time, with a little less than an hour to go.  I've got to get Larry Star to write  my  ebay listings.  Looks like some idiot finally bought the dress for $3800.      There is an  urlLink article  in the Seattle Times suggesting that parts of his story were untrue.  Who cares?  He got his 15 minutes of fame.  I want to thank the person, whoever it is, who mentioned on a blog or a list about bra fittings at Victoria's Secret.  I've never thought about being measured, damn it, I know what size I am.  Or not.  I've been wearing a size too small.  It was totally worth it.  They don't charge for the fitting, but I thought I should buy at least one.  I'm used to shopping at Target or Wal-mart for undergarments, so there was a bit of sticker shock, but I'm over it.

      Still plugging along on the same old, same old.    1. Sleeves for Guild sweater, on 2 circs, so I can maintain the illusion it isn't taking as long as if I did them individually 2. Part 4 of Mystery 6, no way this will be finished this month, I don't even have a 1/4 of it done yet 3. Regia cotton socks, only do a round or three in the evenings while reading in bed so they won't be done anytime soon 4. Finished Part 2 of Mini Mystery E, but then found out that the designer had posted the "wrong" chart to the group, so what I finished isn't what it's supposed to really look like.  I've set it aside to decide if I'm going to fuck with it, or leave it the way it is.  I really don't care if it doesn't look like a carbon copy of everyone elses, unlike some of the group who unpicked everything because it wasn't the same as the "right" chart 5. Critter blankets, have six done, one more almost done and got five more skeins of yarn.  These have morphed into my work project so I can do other stuff without feeling pressured to get the blankets finished 6. No further progress on Common Ground, I have a feeling there will be no further progress until I get caught up on Mystery 6  Haven't touched a cigarette since I first put on the patch.   This is made easier in that I hate to drive, so as long as I stay away from the part of town with the smoke shop I dont have the urge to just hop in the car and pick up a pack.  Got some items back from my framer, she's in Mineola which is 80 miles away from the house.  Usually I go twice a year, drop off 7 to 10 finished items and she Fedex's them to me when she's done.  These are four years worth of  urlLink Linda Driskell's Heirloom Sampler in a Year , hanging on the bedroom wall.       And being indulgent, here are some close ups of various details.  As you can probably tell, I'm pretty proud of them, they represent quite a bit of work.  Call me crazy, but I'd never done drawn thread or cutwork before I started the first one of these.               Just Finished:

      So, I'm trying to be all healthy and quit smoking.  I have tried before, and even been successful for up to eighteen months, but when life gets hard willpower falters.  Hopefully I'll have better luck this time. I went to my local CVS and picked up a box of Nicoderm CQ patches.  I wasn't really paying too much attention, and went ahead and bought the same ones I bought the last time.  No problem, right?  Problem.  Since I smoked less than 10 cigs a day, I should have started with step 2 instead of step 1.  I slap on a patch, and a little while later I'm feeling like death warmed over.  I managed to give myself nicotine poisoning.  I'm such an idiot, and that's what you get for not following directions!      I did get the correct patches, and have been cigarette free for a whole week.  Now if there were only a patch that would help me stop buying sock yarn my bank account would thank me.     I'm still crocheting away on various blankets for the Critter Knitters.   I have two more skeins of yarn to go, and then I'll see if Wal-Mart has any other variegated colors that I haven't done yet.  I'm going to slow down though; I really haven't been working on much of anything else.    Voodoo Vince came in the mail from  urlLink Gamefly .  I'm enjoying it, but Robbyn was right, it's getting more and more difficult.  The boss battles are hilarious.  Dave got some Star Wars game, so we're fighting over the TV.   Fortunately we both enjoy watching the other play and back seat gaming almost as much as having the controller in hand, so it isn't all out war.

      Sent a box with four blankets off to  urlLink  Liz  on Tuesday.  I was planning to mail on Monday, but I was so close to finishing another blanket that I waited.  That blanket was a clone of the smaller unruffled blanket.  For some reason I bought two skeins of that yarn, and then found out I can make an 18 x18" square blanket with one skein using  urlLink  this pattern  .    I've since finished another cat blanket in red white and blue, and have started one in a very bright rainbow.  Dave says he doesn't think the kitties will be able to sleep on the blanket since the yarn is so loud.  I want to find sock yarn in the same color scheme, I think he's embarrassed to be seen with me sometimes.    It seems to take me about three or four days to make the cat blankets so the six skeins of yarn I have left won't last very long.  I might make a few more, but I don't know, I might have to move onto single color yarn, and that would be boring.   I feel really strongly about the project since I used to volunteer as a dog walker at the  urlLink ASPCA  when I was in high school, and I worked for a (thankfully) brief period as an euthanasia technician in a shelter in Pennsylvania.  The poor animals need all the comfort they can get, especially the ones who never get that forever home.

      Mini Mystery E Part 1 is complete:   I love the colors, lately I have a thing for lime green, and this is sure full of it.  Heather is almost done, I still can't find the leaf beads, but I tried her on anyway:   Don't I look stylish in my work shorts with my hair all a wreck?  And blanket three is also done, I just have to sew in the ends and pack up a box:    Abe is a much better model than I am:

      I can't find the leaf beads that I'm supposed to sew on the ends of Heather's i-cord.  I put them somewhere safe where nothing would happen to them, now if I could just remember where that could be.  Therefore no picture of Heather yet, I want her to be 100% finished.  Worked on my Common Ground sampler, all of the outer border, part of the inner border and all of part 1 is now completed.  I'm very glad the over one stitching has stopped for the moment.    I've set it aside to work on my Mystery sampler.  Part four was released today on Mystery 6, and I also started a new smaller Mystery called Mini Mystery E.  This set of Mini Mysteries  (I missed the earlier ones) has the theme of gemstones, and this one is emeralds.  No photo yet, I should be finished with part 1 soon, all I have left is some of the beading.  Finished two cat sized blankets for the   urlLink    still working on the dog sized blanket.  I wanted to make something my dog would fit on, and he's 85 pounds so it's gonna be big.  I thought most people would probably make smaller stuff since it's quicker, but big dogs need blankets too.     I readily admit that the ruffle on blanket 1 was an accident.  I picked up too many stitches around the edges, but it was cute so I let it stay.  I thought blanket 2 was wild enough without needing a ruffle.  I bought a whole bunch more yarn while we were shopping at Walmart tonight, so there are several more blankets in my future.   Commenting on comments    urlLink Robbyn  got Voodoo Vince and Cursed Mummy - cool, I hope Myria has as much fun with Cursed Mummy as I did.  You'll have to let me know about Voodoo Vince, I haven't had a chance to test that one yet.     urlLink Keri   asked if I was a Dallas knitter.  Technically I'm an Irving knitter, but close enough.  I thought I was the only knitter in the Dallas area, until I found the  urlLink  Dallas Handknitter's Guild  which meets once a month, and then I was overwhelmed.  urlLink Fiber Crack   is a blog by another Dallas area knitter.   urlLink Vash   thinks I should knit Zedd a sweater.  I'm thinking something in Fun Fur or Boa, so he can be fluffy like a "normal" cat.  Zedd likes to burrow, he spent the entire evening on my lap completely covered by dog blanket.  Between him and the blanket, my lap was 147 degrees.   urlLink  Mopsie  asked if Mystery 6 was cross stitch.  Yes, mostly.  There are some specialty stitches and some beading but most of it is cross stitch.  The designer  urlLink Martina   creates incredibly intricate designs and incredibly gorgeous designs.  I like to go to her website and just drool.   Current Reads:

        These are the finished socks from the kit I bought at  urlLink the.knitter.com  in purple.  They were a ton of fun to knit, and I got lots of comments when I wore them to work.  Notice I did not say compliments, although I got a few of those too.  My co-workers think I'm crazy, and are only slowly getting used to the outrageous things I wear on my feet.  I have to express myself, my uniform is a boring dark green polo shirt, with khaki pants or shorts.  I'm almost finished with this pair, in Regia cotton.  I did a lace rib pattern on the cuffs, and am adding some 2x2 rib ontop of that to pull them in a little tighter.  The cotton doesn't have much memory.    A little more got done on Hawaii, it's not as even as I'd like but it gets better with each row.  This is my really my first foray into the fair isle type knitting so each stitch is a learning experience.  I'm almost ready to change colors again.    I joined the Stitching Blogger's ring a while back, and have only now noticed the link to the Stitchers Friday Five.  So here goes:  1. How many have you framed on the wall? Many.  Probably about thirty.   2. How many do you have finished in other ways? 1 bellpull, a few ornaments, and about 6 standups or pillows  3. What was the most expenisve finishing? Celtic Christmas, she cost over $200 because I fell in love with a very costly frame  4. Have you finished anything yourself? Ornaments, I can just about manage to sew a straight line and a few of the smaller framed pieces I've put into ready made frames  5. Describe your favourite finished piece I have to pick just one?  Ok, then.  The Heart's Content  urlLink English Elegance .  It's a large sampler type stitched entirely over one.  I finished it in 1993 after I took a class with Maureen Appleton at SOCS.  I had it framed last year.   I have at least 8 things waiting to be framed, I'm going to be making a trip to my framing goddess in June and dropping them off.  She frames them and then mails them back to me.

      Part two of Mini Mystery E is complete:    Here's the whole bellpull to date:    There's one more part to go, and then I'll need to pick out some hardware.  I've also signed up for Mini Mystery F.  Ruby is the gemstone theme.  I wonder what G and H will be?  I like these little projects, they make me feel like I'm accomplishing something.  Work on the large Mystery is progressing slowly, and it doesn't look or feel like I'm really getting anywhere.  I haven't touched Common Ground in over a month, I'm really trying to catch up on the Mystery, a losing battle.  I may just give in and start alternating between the two.

      Well, after having to start over about 42 times, I finally got a few rows of Hawaii done.  I started off by using the wrong color to cast on, then somehow I managed to screw up the amount of yarn needed for a long tail cast on (this time in the "correct" color), then I twisted the join and didn't notice, then I lost my place in the chart on the first two color row and had to rip out several rows to fix it.  If I didn't absolutely adore this sweater, it would be wadded up in a heap at the back of the closet with foot prints from a good stomping!  Finally though, I managed to produce this:    I'm using both hands to strand, which is much easier than the only other FI type sweater that I've made where I dropped one yarn and picked up the other about 42 million times.    Yesterday was Day Knitter's.  Heather and Carol brought photos, and textiles from their recent Peru trip.  They had a blast.  They said the Peruvians were literally selling them the clothes off their backs.  Carol brought back a sack of finger puppets to share with everyone.  I got a llama:    Oh, yeah...  This came in the mail yesterday:   Thanks Wendy for adding the baseball tees to the selection, I love it.  Lucy is just gorgeous in silk-screening.  Want one of your own?  urlLink Wendy's Cafe-Press Store   It was a very good mail day, my yarn order from Elann arrived, a scale I ordered from Ebay, and a couple of craft magazines.  I'm not sure how I feel about the new Knitter's, the entrelac sweater made of sock yarn is very clever, and might go on my list of possibles, I liked the entrelac socks and the Lily of the Valley Shawl is gorgeous, but most of the rest of the designs didn't do anything for me.  Zedd saw us with the camera and immediately hopped up on Dave's lap.  He's not shy at all.

      Finished the Patons Fresco shell (tank top) yesterday.  It's made with yarn that I traded for out of the Great Stash Reduction box.  Fresco is a machine washable ribbon type yarn, and I think I need to throw it in the machine and then damp block it, because the garter edgings are curling up just a little bit.  Can't believe I actually finished some warm weather knitting in time to wear it.  I guess I have it a little easier in that respect since it feels like it's always summer in Texas.    Now I'm working on finishing my purple  urlLink  Sock Kit   from  urlLink theknitter.com  because I need a pair of the size four circs so I can start Dale Hawaii.  I've seen on a few blogs where the Dale Svale is hard to work with, and from the swatches I made, I can see where that is going to be true.  It splits like crazy, but the finished product should be well worth the hassle.  Wish me luck!  I've also made a small amount of progress on Mystery Six    Then I succumbed to temptation at  urlLink Elann  and bought enough yarn to make sweaters out of ONline Linie 78 - Vega in Gothic Grape and Austermann Tropicana in Purple Splendor, and two skeins of ONline Linie 42 - Plush in Casbah to make a scarf.         The Tropicana comes with a pattern for a really pretty summer weight lacy long sleeved top, that I think I want to make, but I could change my mind when I see it.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the Vega yet, but I just had to have it.  I'm a sucker for purple.  I've also finished several more blankets for the Critter Knit-a-thon, two more and I'll have twelve cat sized blankets to send in.  That will be it for me, I'm just getting tired of making squares and I think sixteen blankets isn't too shabby.

      You know what chaps my ass?  {rant mode on}  People have been  urlLink picking on Wendy  because she won't give them photocopies of a poncho pattern, and because she blogs about knitting with "expensive" yarns.   I think she was way too nice, "Bite me" is tame compared to what I would have said.  Whose business is it what kind of yarn anyone knits with?  Some people like Red Heart, some people like Rowan.  You buy what you can afford that makes you happy.  If champagne tastes go with a beer budget, then some choices need to be made.  Buy the cheap yarn and get the instant gratification, or save up some money until you can afford the quality yarn.  It isn't Wendy's responsibility to hand out free yarn to the poor, nor to stop knitting Starmore kits, nor to keep her stash of Colinette under wraps just because there are some dumbasses who think it's ok to chastise her for having enough free cash to afford some of the finer things.  It also isn't her responsibility to send out copies of a copyrighted pattern just because some folks are too cheap or too poor to buy the kit.  Get a grip, it's a friggin' poncho, there are about seven million poncho patterns available, even some for free.   urlLink Google   is a very useful tool, that everyone should learn how to use. {rant mode off}  Well, I'm feeling much better!  In other news, I've belonged to  urlLink The Book Barn  almost since it's creation seven or more years ago.  We are a pretty diverse bunch with the common thread being a love of reading *  One of the other members, Bonnie, raises minature horses, on a small farm in Missouri:  urlLink Sundancer Farms.    She has kindly given me permission to post some photos** of her newest baby "Sundancers Standing Ovation".  Isn't he just the cutest thing ever?          *This list is very high traffic, and very off-topic  **These photos belong to and are (c) copyright 2004 by Bonnie Streich/ Sundancer Farms, please don't borrow them without permission..

      I haven't posted in the last week, not because of lack of time but because I discovered  urlLink www.RealArcade.com   What a great time waster.    Tuesday was knitting guild night.  It was our last sweater class, I wasn't quite finished, my sleeves still needed caps.  Doing them both in the round on two circs made them fly by but I stalled out on the part where I had to start working them back and forth.  I finished that up yesterday, and sewed in the sleeves.   Just a very basic wool crewneck, but it's the first sweater I've done in the round.  I enjoyed the class, it was taught by Mary Lyle, who teaches classes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.  I learned several different techniques that I think will help me in the future.  Zedd is patiently waiting for me to put the sweater in the closet so he can sleep on it.    There are a couple of things that I want to start, including the Dale sweater, but I think I'm going to be good and finish the tank top I'm making out of Paton's Fresco, and the Regia cotton socks first.  Maybe I'll just swatch for the Dale sweater, how much trouble can I get into with just a swatch?  Last Read:   Making Minty Malone - Isabel Wolff    Hanging by a Thread - Monica Ferris

      Finished Mini-Mystery E designed by the talented  urlLink Martina Weber of Chatelaine Designs .  Left most is directly from the scanner, which wasn't quite large enough to show it complete with tassle.  That is my first ever attempt at making a tassle, and I think it came out well enough.  I have a few ideas for improving the next one.    I also stitched the tiny matching ornament that Martina designed.  I'm planning on putting the one that comes with Mini-Mystery F, and possibly G on the same piece of fabric.

      1. Do you take something new to stitch when you travel - a special travel stitching project? I usually bring my knitting, I don't like to travel with stitching, too much hassle, all those baggies, and needles, and scissors to keep track of. 2. Do you plan your trips around stitching shops? Do I plan my trips around stitching - no.  Will I visit needlework or yarn shops if I just happen to find one in the phone book when I get there - sure do.  Most recently, I stopped at the Yarn Barn in San Antonio and purchased Ginny Morrow's Nova, which I wasn't able to get in Dallas. 3. Do you believe that if you cross state lines you MUST buy fibers? No 4. Where have you stitched? That I can remember: Jury Duty, Train trip to Canada, Plane between NY and San Diego, at several SOCS conventions (remember those?), in a moving truck between NY and Dallas with all my worldly possessions in the back. 5. Do your friends/family bring you stitching related gifts when they travel? Nope, but my friends and family don't do too much traveling.

      Just when I needed a laugh, this link was posted to one of my groups.    urlLink http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=8060.0   Joined a new YahooGroup  urlLink The Sampler Life   Big mistake!  They are discussing about a zillion stitch-a-longs that I want to join, I've discovered several new designers that I have to collect, and I've made a mental wish list that is about 14 feet long.  Must be strong, must be strong, if you start anything else new you will never finish anything old...

      Had some fun playing around with Site Meter, I can see what search strings have referred to Wildly Crafty.  My favorite was funky bathmat sets.  I'm proud to say I'm number two for that search string on google.  Another great one was Andy Warhol cross stitch.  Both refer to a  urlLink post  I made last year after my trip to New York for the Zoo Vet Tech conference.

      Came up with a rotation that lets me work on everything in a time frame that allows me to feel like I'm getting something done on each piece.  Instead of doing a ten hour rotation like most stitchers, I work on each project for a hour and then switch.  It isn't a large chunk of time, but I get to see progress, and I never get bored.  Here are some progress pics:  Hawaii    Moving along, still not up to the underarms, decided to split the difference between the cropped and long sweater.  Socks Flickering Flame Lace Cotton Sock   another  urlLink Knitter.com Sock of the Month Kit.  Next up I'm knitting a pair for Dave out of some conservatively patterned Regia.  Mystery 6   Started putting some of the beads on Part 5, still need to do the outer border, and add the Part 6 gazebos.  Am not keeping up with the group.  Mini Mystery E   Just have to add the beads to part 3, sew the end into a point and put on the bellpull hardware.  Just in time for Mini Mystery F.   White Queen   Crappy first photo.  This is the whitework drawn thread sampler I'm doing as a group correspondence course with the  urlLink Cyberstitchers  chapter of the  urlLink EGA .  Stitcher's Five These questions are really hard to answer, I started stitching so long ago I don't really remember. 1. What was your first finished stitched piece? I'm not sure, I remember stitching a needlepoint of strawberries on a train trip to Canada.  I think I was 9. 2. What was the first piece you used beads on? Probably a Just Nan.  I don't remember which one of hers I did first.  Could have been the Spring Sampler, or it could have been an angel. 3. What was the first piece you used blends on? I think this was TW's Magical Night.  I got part way done and then "lost" it because I miscounted, and ended up with two parts that were like a quarter stitch off, and didn't know how to fudge it. 4. What was the first piece you used speciality stitches on? Maybe a Just Nan, maybe Maureen Appleton's English Elegance.  Or maybe it was something by Sweetheart Tree. 5. What was the first piece you stitched on evenweave or linen as opposed to aida? This I have absolutely no clue, I started stitching on evenweave/linen almost as soon as I started stitching.

      I kinda like the stitcher's five.  It gives me something to post, otherwise I wouldn't have anything to say.  All my projects are coming along, but there's nothing exciting to show.  1. Is your DH/partner supportive of your stitching? Extremely.  He's a big time enabler.  If I want something he talks me into, not out of buying it.  2. Do you ever stitch in company? Knit yes, stitch not really, too much trouble to drag everything around, so I mostly just stitch on the couch at home.  My knitting travels around with me, and I'll pull it out anywhere that it isn't rude.  3. Been to a GTG (Get ToGether)? I went to a TWBB, DFW, GTG*, a couple of years ago, we ate at IHOP and then stitched at The Stitchin' Post in Plano.  *Teresa Wentzler Bulletin Board, Dallas-Fort Worth TX, Get ToGether   4. Does anyone complain about your stitching? Not anymore.  My ex-husband thought it took time away from him, and didn't want me to stitch or read or pretty much do anything but hang on his every word.  Notice how I said _ex_husband...   5. Ever had a stranger comment on your stitching? Sure, most times I get "Oh, I'd never have the patience". Sometimes people comment, usually positively.  When knitting, I get asked to knit random people things or asked to show how it works.

      On Tuesday it rained and rained and rained.  We went to the Space Center, because we thought it would be indoors and safe.  Well, partially.  They have several exhibits inside, but there is also a tour of some of the other buildings that requires several stops on a tram.  It seems like every single time we had to get onto the tram and be driven somewhere it started pouring down buckets.  I was very moist by the time we were done.    Historic Mission Control - where all the space flights and moon walks of the '60's and '70's were controlled from in Houston.  Made a historical landmark and preserved.    Another image of historic mission control. Kinda blurry.    X-38 Lifting Body without "skin", prototype of a possible replacement for the space shuttle, or escape pod for the space station.    X-38 Lifting Body with "skin"    Space Station Trainer     Another Space Station Trainer  After the Space Center we were tired and wet, so we drove back to Kemah and stopped for lunch at a great BBQ joint around the corner from the B&B.  Wednesday it was time to head home.  But first we had to choose between the zoo and the natural history museum.  Since the forecast was for more rain, the museum was the logical, safe, indoor choice.  They were having a fabulous exhibit of gemstone carved animals by an artist named  urlLink Gerd Dreher .  You have got to check out his website gallery of carvings.  This stuff is incredible.  If you're anywhere near Houston, I really recommend checking out the exhibit, it's just that good.      Statuette of a monkey    My personal favorite, a mouse in rose quartz    First you get a block of gemstone, for instance a large piece of obsidian    Then you start carving away everything that doesn't look like a gorilla    After a zillion hours of work, it really looks like a gorilla.  There was also a fantastic ancient Eqyptian exhibit, but there were signs up asking that no photographs be taken.  The rest of the museum was pretty standard, dead stuffed animals, rocks, etc.  We didn't go to the butterfly exhibit, or the IMAX theater.  It was getting late, we were getting tired and we still had a four hour drive to get home.

      Just a quick stitcher's five, I'm not done uploading the rest of the vacation photos yet.  1. Do you give away any of your finished stitching as gifts? I used to give away alot of my stitching, but not anymore.  2. Do you sell any of you finished stitching? No, I've never sold any of my finished stitching.  3. Do you give any of your stitching away to charities? I haven't given any of my cross stitching away to charities, but I knit hats for Ship Support, and crochet blankets for Critter Knitter's  4. Do you keep any of your stitching for yourself? As of a couple of years ago, I keep all of it for me.  5. Do you stitch anything as part of exchanges or round robins? I've heard too many horror stories about round robins to feel comfortable participating, and I don't like to stitch to a deadline, so exchanges are rough.

      First things first:   My Hawaii sweater, just past the FI detailing on the bottom, into the vast orangeness before the shaping.  If I were  urlLink Wendy  I'd be done by now.  Unfortunately, I'm me, so I'm looking at at least another month or two.  And now for the trip.   We stayed at the  urlLink Sculpture Garden Bed and Breakfast  in Kemah.  Kemah is a small town between Houston and Galveston, not far from the Space Center.  I forgot to get photos of the cottage we stayed in (the Horizon), and also didn't get any photos of the rock waterfalls or other sculptures.  I did get a photo of Dave on their really old golf cart, complete with venetian blinds and periscope.    Each cottage comes with a street legal golf cart that can be used to jaunt all over town. This one is  has been retired from service, and is permanently parked in front of the office. We had a great time, and are already planning to go back since there was so much to see and do that we didn't have time for.  It also rained almost the entire time we were there.  The first night we dined on the Kemah Boardwalk.  At the Aquarium which is a concept restaurant owned by Landry's.  Several huge saltwater aquariums with lots of healthy, happy fish grace the dining area.  We we lucky enough to get there right before feeding time.   This is a school of large fish in the 50,000 gallon centerpiece tank.    A couple of stingrays cavorting.    Not so very clear shot of the barracuda    Diver handfeeding the enormous moray eel    Close up of the enormous moray eel    Close up of the sea turtle with a missing flipper being rehabbed    Feeding time in the 3 story circular tank in the entrance way.    Dave said that since I put up a picture of him on the golfcart, I have to share the one of me posing with the shark bench at the restaurant's entrance.  I'll put up photos of the Space Center, and a couple from the Natural History Museum in my next blog post.

      Commenting by  urlLink  Holoscan  now.  I really didn't like the Blogger commenting very much.  Very unwieldy, opening up a whole new page instead of a cute comment box, and not allowing people to post any info automatically.    Other than that, and losing a few links on the way, I think my template change was a success.  The orange of the old one was getting to be a bit much.  Actually the font size was annoying me.  It was too big.  No seriously.  I'm one of those people who picks books not only by their content but by the font size, if the font is too big I'm not at all attracted to the book.  Who says you can't judge a book by its font?  Someone on the Mystery IV group posted a link to a great cross stitch site.   urlLink http://www.amonamipierre.com/   It is in French, so a translator comes in handy.  I love redwork style alphabets, there are a couple of kits at European Cross Stitch that I have my eye on, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that this designer offers not one but two free redwork alphabet samplers on the freecharts page.

      More progress on Hawaii.  I'm up to the second to last section of FI patterning before I have to do the vast expanses of plain orange that make up the top.  After I worked through all the casting on difficulties, it's been pretty smooth sailing.  Knock on wood.  The Svale is a bit of a pain in the ass.  It splits like crazy, each strand is made up of four plies, so it's really easy to stick a needle tip between the plies.  It reminds me of LB Microspun.    Another sock finished.  In Mountain Colors Barefoot Wild Raspberry, from a sock of the month club kit.  The pattern is called something extra cutesy, like Butterflies and Berries, but I left it at the office so I don't remember exactly. Fortunately I remember the repeats so I can knit sock two without it.    I'm officially on vacation for the next ten days!  Woo hoo!  Prime knitting time.  If I can drag myself away from this computer.  Monday we're heading out to Kemah (near Houston) for a three day stay at a bed and breakfast.  I hope I remember to not only bring the camera, but to take some pictures.  Just when I get a chance to start moving right along on my Mystery Sampler, I get the box from the EGA.  Oh yeah, I signed up to be coordinator for a Group Correspondance Class for  urlLink  White Queen .  I'm a member of the  urlLink Cyberstitchers Chapter .  I joined so I could take advantage of the classes, there's a non cyber group here in Dallas but they meet at a time when I'm at work.  I haven't started yet, that wouldn't be fair, since I still have to mail out everyone else's booklets (later today) but I did take a peek at the directions and it looks like fun.   Ok so, it's the Monday Stitcher's Five, not the Friday Stitcher's Five.  No matter, I still can't keep up:  1. What is your most treasured needlework possession? I treasure most of my stash pretty equally. 2. What is your greatest fear when doing needlework? I'm stumped for an answer to this one. 3. What is your greatest extravagance in needlework? The Chatelaine Mystery kits. 4. What is your stitching motto? Just five more stitches. 5. What do you dislike most about your needlework? Not being able to stitch everything I want all at one time.  That rotation would be so vast, I'd never get around to a second time on anything.

      It's pretty sad that only the question of the week has encouraged me to post lately. I have been busy with work, and getting adjusted to Dave's new schedule at his new job, but it's also due to a creative slump. Oddly enough, the slump is not related to the projects that I'm working on, I still am making time every day to knit a few rows, or stitch a block of stitches, I'm having trouble coming up with the energy to write about and photograph them. Probably because nothing much has changed. Unfortunately everything I'm working on is a "big-ass" project, and while I know there has been growth and change and I'm inching closer to being finished, I can't document it since there isn't much to show. I want to start something new, but that's just asking for trouble, then I'll just have one more partially finished item that is "blog-boring".    I guess I'm a turtle, and I want to be a hare.    I did start a new cross stitch project with The Sampler Life yahoogroup, called the Marquoir Story, its a nine part sampler. I'm stitching it on 32 count linen, with a Needle Necessities overdyed thread.  I'm not doing anything special with the thread, just stitching it as it comes.       Oh, yeah, this week's question:   What are your favourite cross stitching websites and why?      urlLink Country Cottage    My favorite online shop, where I buy most of my stitching goodies.   urlLink Chartswappers   Trading group on yahoo, trash into treasure!   urlLink Chatelaine - Martina Weber   Absolutely gorgeous designs, my current obsession.   urlLink Hoffman's   My monthly drool spot for all the new releases   urlLink Eye of the Needle - Mineola TX   This is my LNS and framer. Even though there are two LNS's closer, I'm willing to drive 80 miles to leave my finished pieces with Sherry.    I'm sure there are tons more, but I'll just leave it at five for now.

       Would you consider yourself ‘addicted to stitching’? Why or why not?       I wouldn't consider myself addicted. I enjoy stitching as a hobby, but I can put the needle down without suffering withdrawal pangs. There are periods in my life in which I don't stitch or knit for months at a stretch because of time constraints, or because I've found something else that occupies my time more.     Frankly, I think calling something like stitching an addiction is a little insulting to people who have real addictions. I must say though, some of the behavior I see discussed on the xstitch and knitting groups does sound like an addiction:    Using the grocery money to buy stash, lying to your partner about how much stash you have or have just bought, hiding your stash in the trunk so your partner won't find it, hiding your stash in random places throughout the house (like inside the piano) so your partner won't find it, spending mega-bucks on ebay to buy that magazine back issue or leaflet just so you "have them all",  spending so much time with your projects that your kids put themselves into foster homes, not caring that dinner is covered in a light dusting of pet hair.

       How do you choose a project? What “calls” to you the most?   Usually I see something that I just "have" to stitch.  I fall in love with the photo and have to add the chart to my stash.  When stash diving to pick out my next project, sometimes I have something in mind that I've been waiting to work on (I only allow myself three knit or crochet and three stitching projects at a time) and sometimes I have to pull out all my charts and pick the one that tugs at my creative urges the hardest.  This inevitbly leads to me pulling out charts and asking myself exactly what I was thinking when I bought them.  My tastes have changed drastically in the nearly 20 years that I've been stitching.  Which is why I belong to  urlLink Chartswappers .  My trash is someone else's treasure.  Just Finished:

         Dave proposed this morning!  I said yes, of course.  I was not expecting it.  I can't believe he was able to keep his plans a secret, and go buy a ring without me figuring out something was up.     I was going to post a Hawaii progress picture, but Zedd decided he wanted to wear the sweater which made it incredibly hard to knit.

      Busy, busy, busy.  Too busy to write a coherent blog post, too busy to take photos of works in progress.  Or maybe too lazy?  I'll go with busy.  Got the new Interweave Knits.  Yawn.  Not one single thing of interest in there for me.  Am I becoming jaded?  Maybe.  I'm disappointed, usually Interweave is the magazine that has at least one thing I might want to make someday.    Finished part 1a of Mini-Mystery F.     Worked some on the rest of my current projects.  Am almost done with the back of Hawaii, still have to do the matching front and sleeves.  Still am not finished with part 5 of Mystery 6.  Somehow feel that I never will be, since I miscounted and had to take out about three hours worth of work.  That sucked!  The Stither's Five has been changed to the Stitcher's One: Which project (finished or in progress) are you most proud of? Explain why.  I thought we answered this one recently, or maybe that was most favorite?  I still think it has to be  urlLink English Elegance.    It was one of the first things I stitched on linen, way back in 1993 I had only made a few things on Aida, and maybe a very small linen ornament.  I had no idea it was supposed to be too advanced for my skills at the time, I just followed Maureen's directions (I took a class at SOCS), stitched like crazy for close to a year and ended up with an absolutely gorgeous finished piece.  Its all over one for those who aren't familiar with  urlLink  Maureen's designs .  I finally got it framed last year, and it occupies a place of honor in the dining room.  It's my "if you can make this, you can make anything" piece.

      The new summer  urlLink  Knitty  is out.     urlLink Joan McGowan-Michael  outdid herself with this  urlLink pattern .  This is going to be my new staple for folks that ask for a freebie pattern for Fixation.  I didn't see anything that I'm interested in making but you have to admire the creativity.  Besides I only read it for the articles, I swear...

        What would your stitching confession be?  For example, you don’t tidy your backs.   My confession is that not only do I have way too much stash to ever finish in a lifetime, but that my tastes have changed so drastically that most of what I own has become obsolete.  I belong to a trading group, and ever so slowly, I'm replacing some of the old with new, but I'm afraid that by the time I get around to being ready to stitch any of it, I won't like it either.  Knitting stash confession, I went overboard on sock yarns, I think I have enough for 100 or more pairs.    I do not, however, feel the need to hide any of my stash inside the oven or piano, or unused bathroom or cat bed.  I don't cram my yarns behind books on the bookcase, or hide my cross stitch charts in the trunk like I've read so many times on KnitList.  I feel completely comfortable with my obsession, because all I have to do is open the door of the downstairs bedroom and look at all the unpainted minatures to know that Dave does exactly the same thing.  We are perfect for each other, the only problem is that we're going to need to buy a really big house to hold all our "important" crap.  I won a contest on  urlLink OpalChatters . All I did was post an response to the question of the week.  One of the moderators felt like doing an impromptu drawing.    How did she know my favorite color is purple?  Zedd is enjoying some quality time with Dave:    Just Finished:     This was an ok read, I picked it up because I'd heard several good reviews, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.

      The newest zoo baby is a Titi Monkey, in this picture he is 3 days old.  For a idea of size, the person holding him is my friend Kim.  She has average sized woman's hands.    He was at the hospital because his mom rejected him.  Titi Monkeys have monogamous pairings, and the male provides baby sitting services by carrying the infant around except when the infant needs to nurse.  Then he hands him over to mom.  This little guy's mom refused to take him.  Which was odd, since she had successfully raised a baby previously.  Fortunately we were able to convince her that she really wanted to raise her own offspring, since it isn't really great if we have to hand-raise since the babies don't learn how to act appropriately as animals.   Comments  Caroline asked if Hawaii is a Dalegarn pattern?  Good guess, it's the cover sweater from book #122.  Robbyn, the latest Dark Tower was really good.  I loved the way Stephen King included himself.  I was skeptical when I heard that was his intention, but it worked.  Jenni,  urlLink Noah's Sub  is gorgeous, but for some reason I've never been really attracted to stitch it.    Just Finished:

       If you could only finish one of the pieces in your stash as it is at the moment, what would it be and why?   Does it have to be something I've already started, or can it be something new? If we're talking something I've already got started, then it would have to be  urlLink Crossed Wing Flower Power . Why? Because it's huge so I would have many, many hours or even years of stitching pleasure, and because I just love all the hummingbirds and critters. If it's something I own but haven't started yet, then I just can't choose one. I have a list of about 15 things that I really, really, really want to stitch. Most of them are enormous, like  urlLink And They Sinned  or  urlLink Blue Ribbon Sampler . I have this major attraction to big ass projects lately, which may be why I keep feeling like I'm not getting anything any closer to completion.  I have made progress on Hawaii.  The back is done, half of the front is done, I still have to do the sleeves, but it's almost a sweater.  I've also almost finished White Queen. I only have the final two bands to complete. I don't have a progress picture, it's on a scroll frame and there really isn't much to show. Hopefully I'll have a finished picture by the end of the week.  Those are the two things I've been concentrating on. I've stopped doing my rotation until I get at least one or two things done, and then I will try my hardest not to add anything new in.
