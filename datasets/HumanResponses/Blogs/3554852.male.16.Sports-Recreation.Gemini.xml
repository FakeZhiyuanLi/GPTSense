      I am almost done with exams. Social Studies was really easy (yesterday) and Science was a bitch (today). Now all I have is math on monday. That shouldn't be too hard, seeing as I'm a math whiz and all. he he he, Shamless Bragging. SB. I leave you now with a link to one of my most favorite Flash Movies. http://www.uplink2k.com/library/cartoons/ah2.html Later.

      So, (this happened yesterday, but I will say today, bc its more natural to me) I found a used pen on the ground at school. It was pretty beat up, but I needed a pen, so I took it, and set it in my right pocket (my dominant side). I had used it often that day, and sitting, and getting up it exploded in my pocket. Wow. I was pissed. Not just because my pocket was/is dirty, but because, lo and behold, my iPod was in that pocket. I was soooo fuckin pissed. I screamed (literally) and attempted to clean my device. Well, ther was ink all over the fuckin thing! And that was a baaaaad Idea. It turns out that soapy water is BAD for electronic devices, even if it's just on the body. So, not realizing this, I proceeded to listen to it, and it was screwed up. I could barely get the track spinner to work, or whatever its fuckin called. so I reseted it, and it started to work a little bit more. Its still not in tip top, and it kinda looks like crap, but i have secured my investment. hallelujah! The moral of the story: Don't put an iPod in the same pocket as a pen or a magnet.

My reciept said I had 100, and I think I was charged for 100, but I still thought that I would get 50. Oh well. Now Im just rambling. Blah. I'm gonna go now, before I make myself seem like an idiot (too late).

Even though I work on commission... o.O. and The movie that I want to see, "Super Size Me", isn't playing within 30 miles of where I live. Damn. Ok, Im going to go play some pac man.

      Hello there! I have to retype this entire post, because the draft and publish buttons are two totally different fucking buttons. Well, then... lemme see. I made a shit load of money yesterday. I am this much closer to buying my killer rig *thumbs up*. I also have to work all this weekend, so I am thrilled about that. I mean, I have to bust my ass, but I gets paid, and that's all that matters. I really don't think that I'm going to break 500 again at a baseball game. I love boxing ^_^. Well... I wanna see I, Robot, but I don't think that I will get an opportunity... at least not soon. Will Smith sure is a hottie! Oh, and I have a Crush on this girl for some reason now. I'm not gonna go into specifics (Because she's probably reading this), but she's pretty and smart. All I need for the perfect girl! :)

I bought the Sealab 2021 DVD, and it's pretty good. about 8/10. A few things pissed me off, but that's a whole nother day's worth of complaining that you've come to love and respect. My backpack's got jets. Time to play PS2, mother fcukers!

      Well, I went to the concert, and my friend showed up, but it was after I went in, which was 8:15. The price was more than expected, so she had to wait for an hour while her mom came and got her. I felt reallly bad. I'm sad :(. Oh well, you can't change the past. So, What else is new? I am going to see I, Robot soon, hopefully. Things are stabalizing at work. I am going to be buying the sealab DVD when It comes out... um... Cleaning my computer for viruses and spyware. Ok, Im gonna go now.. peece

      Well then. I went on a "date" last night. And I'm not sure how I feel. She sort of came on strong and told me about another guy that she's into. hrmmmm. But I like her, and she's fun to be with. We saw The village, which sucked, but at least it was better than signs. The last 25 minutes were just soooo pointless. Oh well, that's 16 dollars that I'm noever gonna get back. I blew off work Friday and Saturday, and I'm contemplating blowing it off today. I am really lax right now... booooooooooooobies. I like girls. Ok, I'm gonna stop now.
