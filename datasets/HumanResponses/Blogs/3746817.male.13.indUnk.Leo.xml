         Yay!! Ronald Susilo again, won!     This time against a German, quite big size. But still won.     The German lose until very cham... 15-11, 15-6 leh!~     hahaha...          Mmm, Literature now doing "saving".     Means after reading, now try "save" and squeeze "data" into my "hard drive".          Later i going to read up on my Math. This term the Algebra really irritating...     But anyway, even if i dont do well, i know i tried my best of the best of the best.      I'll try to minimize "errors" on the test.      BAHBYE!

         Today was an "okay" day.     Had the exams, think not going to to as well as last time.     This term's standard high la...cannot catch up with it.          And yeah, Singapore's badminton team at Athens is at a high.     Ronald Susilo indeed, won World Ranking No.1 Lin Dan from China.     I was not expecting this, but i was hoping and praying that he wins.          That idiot guy is irritating again, ppl cannot disturb him , he can disturb ppl.     and he's so ACT u know, wan to action but wan to act like don wan don wan.     He keeps shouting into ppls hears, with a stupid sharp voice, everyday act act,     He think he very cute, infront of teacher act good, wan to action also.     keep wanting attention, very arrogant, but he act like he's not one.     Play basketball with him, everytime must pass him, if nv pass he not happy, so petty.     And a big bully, actually, not big, small. i have a timid frend in my class, my partner, he keeps on shouting at him and don let him off, he wan to beat him up smore, he 140cm plus only leh, think he very big. Then act helpful, cos he wants ppl to know he is a good person. so sucks.     Very irritated by him for a long time liao, simply "BUSHUANG"          Being his frend for a while,i regretted it, but i just continue, i scared he cry.     I can say all these in short,        SIMPLY...Arrogant, Action, Acter, he craps for Attension.
