      Well another day of class has gone by and we are all a little more dumbfounded (excuse any spelling errors!) I think I am getting the hang of the if/then/elseif/else statements.  Kinda understanding dimensioning the variable thing.  I understand the concept of dim'ing a variable but when to do it is another story.  We are getting to play with a few more things in the gui such as the track bar, check boxes, and radio buttons.  I would have to say that so far I am enjoying this class more than the previous go figure its the first class I actually get to program and understand what I'm doing ;)  Till its time to blog again PEACE!

      Well what can I say?!?!?!?!?!? another missed day and probably a day that I needed to be there.&nbsp; The storm we had blew my girlfriends comp and we had to exchange it after 7 days of use.&nbsp; We found out she had a faulty surge protector which blew her first one :(&nbsp; We remedied this problem by buying an expensive batter backup/surge protector.&nbsp; Since I have forgotten what chapter we had to read over the weekend I will be checking Mr. Harden's blog to see what I need to brush up on tonight and what questions I need to do.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll be able to get my grade up eventually :(

      Well let me start by appologizing for the short blog last post.&nbsp; My comp was unconnected from the network and I had to borrow my friends comp but he needed it right after I started.&nbsp; So yeah, Helen Keller's&nbsp; tic tac toe was a pain in the neck until Mr. Harden found the logic errors that drove me crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once that was found it didn't take long to fix the problem.&nbsp; Now lets talk about some Fleet Manager calculations.&nbsp; Am I the only one getting 6,000 $ more on the total cost after its all added up?&nbsp; I'm thinking I did some screwy addition.&nbsp; Its all good though I'll look at all the excess as profit ;)&nbsp; I think I'm gonna start working on a I D 10 T form for the fleet project, please drop me a line as to what ya'll think should be on it.&nbsp; This is for all those "smart" people in the world!

      Yeah, we have been making a simple version of tic tac toe.&nbsp; Now I call it a simple version but those friggen logic errors make life seem so much less fun..... so anyway I'll get back to this thing later doh!!!!!

      Well if you couldn't guess we learned about some psuedocode today along with algorithms.  I can defiantly say that I need some more time to grasp this one.  I understand the concept of psuedocode but I don't know where to begin with pseudocode.  Geeze that doesn't even make sense to me :(   What I mean is since psuedocode is similar to code I get confused when its time to change an algorithm to psuedocode.  I would like to give a shout out to the Mrs.  You know who I'm talking about Mr. Hardin!  I guess I should have known other people would be reading this..... I hate journals!  So anyway, yeah I've already confused myself trying to explain my own confusion.  Well I was gonna end this blog with a joke but being that I was in the Navy for a while I can't seem to think of any jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences...... So I'll just take a bow :)

      So, Yeah!  You know what I love about programming?  You either get it right or you constantly stay mad.   Gotta love it.  We learned about variables and functions today.  We covered ByVal and ByRef and we had a graphic representation of memory blocks on the comp that the variable saved its value to.  Ya like my grammar??  Looking forward to my 2nd project over the weekend.  Gotta watch a webcast on VB.NET and write a basic essay about it.  Sounds easy enough but then again I hate writing essays.  I would like to give mad props to www.ebaumsworld.com  great site for the person with nothing to do!  Anyway, till next time my faithful fans.... Take it easy.

      What's up my faithful peeps?  So we learned a few things in class today.  We learned a little bit about making a program idiot proof using the VaL() command and we learned a little bit about some syntax errors and logic errors.  A few things about inheritance and the all lovable class.  All in all I would say it was a good night for learning.  We are starting to get into some new things which is always cool.  Makes class a little harder but at least I know my massive amounts of loans are going to good use right ;)  So I'll leave you with a sucky joke: Why don't canibals eat clowns?     They taste funny!

      So yeah... Question 1: The Creation of the internet.....(ding ding ding) "Who is Al Gore"...Oh so sorry absolutely wrong!  The correct response would be "What is ARPA NET!. " I've been in class for an hour now and we have gone over the first 3 chapters of the book.... not to surprising since its the same stuff we went over in the last quarter.  So far things are looking up for the first test!

      I have to apologize for the way I behaved in class today.  I'm in the middle of cutting down my nicotine intake and eventually quitting.  It has got me a little unnerved.  After I had told my girlfriend what had gone on she had a "surprise" waiting for me when I got home and made me realize that I was being a jack ass.  For this I'm sorry and I'll see ya'll tomorrow at class!

      Wow!!!! WTF have we found here.  A niffty little way of labeling people fucking up on their code.  I'm glad I can be the butt of ya'lls jokes but remember that no one can keep from snapping.  Keep it up, Please!
