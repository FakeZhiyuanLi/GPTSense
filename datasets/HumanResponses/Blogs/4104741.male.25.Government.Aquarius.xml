      Days when you`re around are so wonderful. Silly sweet nothing we do keeps the time running so fast we`ve gotto separate. quick escapade to another country that fails... arghhhhh, not forgettin the party cum photo sessions, cable car rides, sun bathing, kayaking, al fresco dining, late nite movies and nail painting all done during the times we had together. And how irritating can things be when i cant express myself with the photos i took during those days .... even more arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....   Zwan

      Never even thought to cry when I heard you say good-bye never said where you were goin There's no laughter in the air only silence everywhere and so much left unspoken  Since you been gone I haven't been the same I wish that I could seewho's to blaim  Without you where do I belong? Without you how can i go on? and no love like yours wil ever do tell me how am I supposed to live my life? without you  Was so lost in you and me to the point I couldn't see that what we had was dying  Now its all that I can do to see photographs of you and stop myself from cryin'  I should learn to live without your love Got so many memories but its not enough  I feel helpless and oh so all alone Like I never felt before You made me feel alive but I don't know what it's like anymore

      Not sure if i'm gonna be discipline updating myself online. Life's hard not being at home most of the time. Talking about freedom, i'm not sure this is what i wanted all my life. Maybe it's just someone else's dream i'm following thru.  Life's a bitch esp when u've got a piece of skin tore off ur thumb. esp ur master hand. Did u know that u use 70% of ur thumb for most of the work u do!! Try living a life without a thumb. Life's hard especially when i can't type fast.    Freak
