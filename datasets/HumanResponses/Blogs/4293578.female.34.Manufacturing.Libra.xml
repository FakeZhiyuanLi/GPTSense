       ok, so, i was thinking...my birthday is coming.  yea and its a big year for me.  the biggest so far.  the big 3-5.  now ive been carefully thinking about my birthday and what i would like.  and in the mist of analyizing things i want, i started to think about wishing.  i use to make a wish and then blow out my candles, but i was a child.  i havent done that sort of thing for 25,26,27 years.  maybe i should give it a try this year.  couldnt hurt right?        well, since its been 7 years since, well you know, i think i will wish for....   wait a minute.  maybe i shouldnt be so selfish.  maybe i shouldnt wish for a homerun.  and since its been awhile maybe i need to baby step back into the wonderful world of "oooooh aaaah oooooh...oh god oh god...oh my god"!  so let me ponder this a bit.  (long dramatic pause) ok...so, this year im gonna wish for....wish for....for...someone to make out with!  there......I SAID IT!  i wish for someone to make out with.  im not asking for marriage or for you to fix something broken in my house or build me shelves.  just someone to make out with.        but, i dont want to make out with a girl.  oh and i dont want to make out with someone missing teeth or with black or green teeth.  well hell, i dont want to make out with anyone who's teeth arent white (or at least something sorta resembling white).  oh yea and i dont want to make out with a family member.  i dont want to make out with a little person (knome, midgit, dwarf, elf...pick your own noun).  i dont want to make out with anything outside my species.  (whale, snake, rat, worm).  i dont want to make out with anyone old with saggy balls, or someone too young with no hair on their balls.  wow, my choices are getting more and more limited.  oh and no one married either.  no one crazy or obese.  no one mental or retarted.  no one mean, greedy, no one that smokes.  no one dead or diseased.  no one overly hairy.  no one stupid or ugly.  what does that leave me????  see? see?  this is why its been 7 fucking years since ive last had sex!!!  UGH!  fuck this stupid wishing shit.  if it aint gonna be keanu reeves, benico del toro, jaquin phoenix, darren hayes or rob thomas...then just squash it!  forget the whole damn thing.  what was i thinking???  i gotta go.   there is a nuse with my name on it.        did i whine much??  yea so fucking what!      love ya, mean it.      p.s.  i wish for someone to make out with on my birthday.

       a little background to start off this blog. my name is vicki. im a single mom with a teenage son. i own a townhouse and have a dog, cat, fish and geko. i hate my neighbor to the left of me. i wish them nothing but ill will. i have a job. i have a car. i dont smoke or do drugs but sometimes wish i did.       i hate people that can lie. i suck at it so i resent when someone does a good job at it. i like to paint and draw and a coloring book ususally is my friday nite date. speaking of dating, havent...in 7 years. yep...unfortunately that wasnt a typo. 7 long, sad, pittiful years. i spend the entire weekend pretending that it doesnt bother me and watching decorating shows.       i love to read but only enjoy reading books about serial killers, weather or art. you try to figure out that combo. im lazy and kooky all rolled up into one. i have many tattoos and plan to get more and more and more when the funds are available. i dont really have any friends. i know lots of people but i really dont consider 99% of them my friends. i blame myself for that. im a lousy friend. im selfish and inconsiderate but hey, its my world and i have to live in it.       im not really that harsh, it just seems that way on the surface of things. deep, deep, deep, deep, deep down i care about things. i just choose to not share that with people. i mean hey, i say thank you and please more than i hear it. and i hate my stupid bitch neighbor and her pain in the ass son, but you dont hear me banging drums at 11:30 at nite keeping them up when they have to work at fucking 7 am. (like they do to me) and im polite to people i work with even though i dont give a shit about any of them. i listen to there problems and hear about their family shit and i nod and oooh and aaah when suppose to. i say good morning and have a good nite too people knowing damn well im just going through the motions with no emotion.       i realize in my old age, that life is a game and you have to play but you dont have to follow the rules. you can make them up as you go. its not how you play the game, just as long as youre in it. and no one wins. not really. there is always heartache and pain. thats just the way it goes.       bitter?? me?? maybe. cynical?? pretty much. but whos counting? my life is what i make it right? i think it taste like chicken. so, hope you got to know me a bit, and for those of you who do know me already that are reading this, well im sure i will be getting a comment posted pertaining to the friendship thing. post away baby. i can handle it.       do i whine much? yea, so fucking deal with it.       love ya, mean it

						     i've been so busy with work, i haven't had time to draw anything, or check out the board, (i miss my fellow cartoonists!) or even talk to my man. today is going to be a strange day. we pick up lindsay's boyfriend from the airport, and then go out for coffee with the two of them, along with my mother-in-law, and my son and his fiance. she's leaving for taiwan for 10 months. she's a sweetheart, and i know my son will miss her terribly. just exactly when did i become old enuff to be a mother-in-law? and when did my daughter grow up so much that she's got a boyfriend? oh...yeah....she's the same age i was when i got married! and then, i decide to go to school. what kind of insanity is this?

						    this is a bad day. i've been arguing with brian (my hubby) all day, and nothing has been going right. i had to go to work at the gallery, and i was not in the mood to deal with lots of little kids. so, of course, it was one of the busiest days ever. i was supposed to do finger painting, so a lot of set-up, and clean-up. and i really get ticked off at parents who do nothing to help their own child, and expect me to wash their grimy little hands. but what's even worse, are kids who don't listen and figure they can do whatever they want even if you say no. i would never have let my kids act that way. i'm glad they're not little anymore. and tomorrow, i have to go to the fringe. i wonder what brian and i will fight about on monday? i need to find some time to post some pics here, and update my profile. i will do that...eventually.

						    i'm still trying to figure out the posting pix thing. aaggghhh! some days, i hate being me. i have trouble understanding the steps, and it's so frustrating. i guess i'll have to get someone to show me first, then i'll be able to do it....i hope. gee, this looks good for school. if i can't figure out how to post a stupid pic, how am i gonna remember all the stuff i have to do for classes?

						    spent a week working at the fringe drama festival. did not enjoy the experience at all. i like working with the mendel, but the 25th street theatre organization was horrible to deal with. they made it virtually impossible for volunteers to see shows, due to the ridiculous limitations they imposed. such as you could only book the day of the performance, and since there were advance sales, often the really good shows were already sold out beforehand. and the organizers "reserved the right" to sell the specified number of volunteer seats. (i've always hated that term "reserved the right"....very vague, and makes sure that the organization can do whatever they want anyway, since they've reserved that right to do so). what really made me angry was the way they handled my complimentary tickets, which i won from a tv station. when i went to the venue to redeem them, they wouldn't honour them. said they were all sold out. so they hadn't held back seats that had already been purchased for the giveaway. i was told i could go to another play...which is not what i wanted. i won the tickets, so i could go see the play i wanted to, and was unable to with my volunteer pass. i bumped into someone from the board of directors, and they wouldn't let her use her superpass (which is supposed to cover all plays, all the time)! so it's more about the bottom line, 25th street, isn't it? they just want to sell the seats...as i discovered, they make $2 for each seat sold above a certain number. so they don't care about the volunteers, or honouring comps. i was really mad. made quite a scene in the box office in victoria school. guess they weren't prepared to deal with my raging temper!

						   Yesterday was a terrible day. I checked on student loans...after five phone calls, four people, seven prompts, and two idiots, I finally found out that my assessment hasn't even been done yet, due to missing information. Of course, they don't tell you that. You have to somehow psychically know that there is a problem, and call them. And their reason? "not enough manpower." Okay, sure, that's true...but why isn't the information stated clearly on the form? If I'd known I'd needed to get some extra documents, then I'd have done that. So instead, I waited five weeks (they won't tell you anything before that) and then made all these phone calls, which still didn't give me the answer I needed. When we finally figured it out, then they tell me that it will be another four weeks before I receive notice! Hello? I leave in 10 days, and I have no way of knowing whether I will have the loan to pay my tuition! A drunk monkey (if you're a big brother fan, you'll know who said that!) could do that job. I did lose my temper on the phone...and I was told very curtly that there is no need to yell, ma'am. Yeah, there is, especially if you keep calling me ma'am! End result: I have to wait again, and I smashed my favourite mug, my happyface mug, against the wall, so now it has a crack on the bottom and I can't use it. And I fought with Brian over the computer. He seems to think that I don't need a computer, and I should just wait until student loans comes thru (if they do) to get a laptop. I'm supposed to go without, while there are two at home. I told him that I will be taking a computer, whether it's this one or another, I don't friggin' care. "It's too much trouble to pack and move" according to my possessive husband. That's your problem, Brian, not mine. I AM TAKING A COMPUTER! How does he expect me to stay sane, if I have no way to connect with my friends, write in my blog, write notes and blather about school? He should remember that I actually paid for the computer, with my wages from the gallery, and we got it from an auction for employees of the gallery. I paid for the computer, the scanner, and the printer! So he paid for the upgrade, and some of the software. whoopdee do. Next thing, he'll be telling me I don't need a vcr or a tv...just try taking away Survivor from me....it will get ugly, I can assure you...

						    Sometimes I hate being me. It's so frustrating not being able to figure things out easily, or miss things that I should know, or realize that Nobody is Listening to Me! My care group from LH hosted a send-off party for me on Sunday evening. I was rather pleased, because it was nice to be acknowledged and appreciated. I never got that at West Portal. Part of the reason I love LH is the people accept me with all my faults (of which there are many) and never make me feel like my gifts and talents are unnoticed. There were lots of my LH friends there, all telling me how much they'd miss me and they wished me well in the Hat. So you'd think that would make me, the upstaging comedian, thrilled to be the center of attention, right? Wrong. I came home feeling totally anxious, just because I couldn't handle all the conversations and the people. I missed parts of things people said to me, and answered with really dumb, nonsensical things. At one point, I was telling the story of the student loans, and I realized that I'd been talking for five minutes, and only one person was listening...and I immediately beat myself up for being boring, too talkative, not tuning in to the signals. How come I didn't realize four minutes earlier that the story was way too long? I don't know. That's part of ADHD...just no social awareness at all. And with multiple conversations going on, I couldn't keep track of a single thread. And when I looked at my loving husband, he had fallen asleep. At my party! I was so angry at him for doing that...which really shouldn't have mattered, should it? After all, the party was for me, and no one else seemed to mind. But it bugged the hell outta me. For no other reason than I thought he should have stayed awake and at least pretended to be interested in me! I came home feeling anxious, paranoid, angry, and afraid. I am glad my friends did that for me, it was sweet, but I can't help freaking out about my own shortcomings in those situations. Lavern apologized for telling me ahead of time about the party...the group had wanted to make it a surprise. That would not have been a good idea. I've always hated surprises...now I know why. It's because my inner life is in such turmoil every day...I have no way to prepare myself for surprises. It throws me into a totally paranoid, stressful state, and I retreat. How many times Brian has had to change plans, or tell me about them, because I was getting so worked up about not knowing anything. Most people can handle surprises, and enjoy them...for me, it just means I will do something wrong, or say something stupid, or not even show up because I can't handle crowds. I hate movie theatres, surprises, malls on a sale day, and hordes of little children. I feel bad that I feel this way, because I know my friends put on a great party, and they were very considerate. So why don't I feel happy and grateful, and enjoy the attention?    I'm going to totally screw up on my first day of school, I know it.

						    This is a verse I read some time ago, and gave me the inspiration I needed to continue pursuing my education. I review it once in a while when I'm feeling hopeless, or when I have to deal with student loans!   Jeremiah 29:11: "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord; plans to give you hope and a future."       Things I will miss most when I'm in Medicine Hat;   1. my treadmill   2. watching Survivor with Lindsay on Thursdays   3. watching Brian drop bread crumbs all over himself when he's eating my homebaked bread   4. going to half-off sales at thrift stores with Lindsay and Derek   5. worshipping at Living Hope on Sundays   6. my treadmill!      Things I won't miss at all!   1. my stove (never use it anyway!)   2. having to listen to Nascar races on Sundays, at 110 decibels!   3. Thursday afternoon meetings at the Mendel (sorry, Laura, but I"m not very good at paying attention!)   4. seeing piles of vcr's and tools in the middle of my livingroom
