      whew, i must admit taht i am totally bored. that's what my computer's for though. on the other hand, i could be kinda nervous. jesus is getting back from houston soon...i think today, but i'm not sure and i'm kinda nervouse about it. i haven't seen him in a year. now i'm sitting here listening to "take another little piece of my heart" by janis joplin. she is totally my hero. she rocked so hardcore. this last week has been pretty weird. michelle and amy have been pretty bitchy to a lot of people now that they have each other. don't worry, i'm not just saying taht cause they ditched me, several people have mentioned to me that they've been doing that lately. the weirdest part is that i don't ahve a huge problem with it. it kinda opens up new oportunities for me. like i use to just hang out with michelle at lunch since i don't have a lot of friends who have 1st lunch with me, but the other day when she was off walking alone, i sat at sophia's table, and then just sat and talked with ian and bethany. it was fun. i guess i should thank her later in life for ditching me. sure ditching people the the number the biggest aspect of un-chillness, but i guess that just makes these people michelle and amy are turning into...well...un-chill. i've been a lot more jack lately than kiki. i was totally kiki last summer. "a tight tye-dye dress she was a psychadelic mess." that sort of thing. i didn't care about a thing and i was totally in love with this random guy i made out with who didn't speak a word of english. it rocked. now i'm kinda more jack. "the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned." THAT sort of thing, i'm not worried about it either. i like jack a lot. thanks meghan for the nickname. Jack, hannah Jackson. it makes sense. Europe is more of a Jack country than Mexico is too. i went to san miguel de allende, mexico last yaer when i was Kiki and this summer when i'm Jack, i'm going to Germany and Italy. and the last like 3 years i've been on vacation i've met totally amazing people who changed my life. so maybe that'll happen again. i hope. it rocks. anyway, my computer is tweaking out and my brother has a not so shabby looking friend over. so adios.

      now i'm sitting here listening to this song....i'm not sure what its about because i've never listened to the words. it feels like its about being totally content with everything. its called "heaven". i really love it. i was also listening to this postal service song all day and there's this part where he says "tell me am i right that there could be nothing better, than making you my bride and slowly growing old together." i really love it. i don't even get how i was sooo pissed off yesterday and feel so calm today. i heard that tears contain these hormones that make you feel upset, so when you cry you release them. maybe i just let them all out yesterday and now i feel fine. i spent most of today sitting around and i bought this c.d. case that holds 208 c.d's then i put all my c.d's in there in order my genre. wow, what a nerd. it was hard. i read a lot of a prayer for owen meany too. that book rocks pretty hard core. i recommend it to anyone who reads this. if anyone does. did you know i'm going to open up my own chain of bars in Argentina someday? maybe once i get enough money, i'll be able to open some in the states. i think that sounds like an awesome job. my goal is for someday when i just randomly meet someone, they say "so what do you do?" and i'll tell them, "oh, i own _________ Bars." and then they'll say, "really? i love that place!!" i think that would rock so hard if that happened. and i think it probably will. someday right? ha ha ha. its always someday! i haven't smoked weed in a week by the way. pat on the back. bye for now.

      this is the second time today i've written in here, but this is the only one you can read. in the first one i wrote a lot of stuff about some people who i was pissed at. i did it cause i needed to vent and hadn't talked to anyone about how pissed i was. i calmed down though and now i feel better. i'm still mad at michelle and amy, but i get them. maybe they'll apologize, or maybe i'll just talk to them. who knows. i just got back from VanHelsing with Krista, Tyler, Kirk and Lindsay. That movie made no sense at all. ha ha. freakin ridiculous. but i had a good time in general. i just needed some calm, laid back people to hang out with, and now i feel sooo much better. however, i am traumatized because tyler took of his pants for most of the movie and just sat there in his boxers. i've seen his ass so many times in my life, that freaks me out. ha ha. arggg. the auction is tonight and my mom had an emotional break down before she left and just started crying and talking about how she cried there and had so much left to do and no one was helping her. i felt really bad but she really got over it. i hope things stay like this. i'm gonna go get some sleep for chilling with linz tomorrow. adios.

      when i gpt in the car this morning that new hoobastank song was playing. i really do dig it. then a bob marley song came on, and then nirvana. i'm pretty sure it was brad nowell making sure i was happy. this morning iw as talking to my mom about what a kiss ass tyler is to adults and what a dick he is to the rest of us. i never talk to him anymore, cause he was such a drama queen last time we really hung out. and, when i first got up i was thinking about michelle having tess come to tualatin for the day. i doubt she'll really come, but i still don't want her to. i don't know what i really have against her besides the fact she broke pretty much every rule of chillness: she ditched me, she lied to me, and she made me feel like shit. the worst part is i don't think she really cares about any of it.i just don't like the fact that her grandparents live next door to me and she still could never come over to just say hi. it seems a little unfair. we had been friends since elementary school. i don't want her to come.       thank god the auction is almost over. my mom is doing a lot of stuff for the tualatin auction so there's all these people and all this random stuff all over our house. all these soccer moms....its driving me crazy. it all ends tomorrow though. then my mom will start making me dinner again. yay!  p.s. i made a list of my top 22 favorite songs ever and here it is....  22. Closer-NIN 21. When I Grow Up-Garbage 20. Dancin With Myself-Billy Idol 19. Crash Into Me-Dave Matthews Band 18. Cold Hard Bitch-Jet 17. Steal My Sunshine-Len 16. Saturday Night-Misfits 15. All the Young Dudes-? 14. Semi Charmed Life-Third Eye Blind 13. Bohemian Like You-Dandy Warhols 12. One Love-Bob Marley 11. What It's Like-Everlast 10. Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangster-? 9. Gigantic-Pixies 8. Lovefool-The Cardigans 7. You Shook Me All Night Long-AC/DC 6. Take Another Little Piece of My Heart-Janis Joplin 5. I Miss You-Incubus 4. Never Been To Spain-Three Dog Night 3.

      i just did homework from 4 15 to 8 15. 4 hours!! jesus! oh well. i had an all right day i spose. some of my dear friends have been annoying me in the extreme lately, but i assume this time will pass. or maybe its like when that palm reader todl me and i have a friend w ho's going to ruin my life if i don't stay away from her. ? who knows. i hope no one ruins my life that'd suck. mmmmm....my dad was just smoking a cigar and my house smells really good. i am totally pro cigar smoking because of how great they smell. i'm thinking about finishing the magazine i started a long time ago this summer. i was going to do it this year but then i realized i needed more people to write articles and then i realized i didn't like any of my old articles so i just stopped. my friend in california told me thought that he wants to write an article for me and i trust him to do an awesome job. that'd rock if it works out. if it doesn't...ohwell. just like "tao does not do, but nothing is not done." very to the point. send me articles if you have any about anything at all.

      well i just finished a book called "the tao of pooh" its all about taoism in winnie the pooh. its basically about how pooh represents the tao belief in the Uncarved Block, which is pretty much saying that simplicity conquers all. don't analyze anything too much. something about how winnie the pooh listens to a bird sing and owl wonders what kind of bird is singing. then there's this whole thing about Nothingness and how great it is. like once you realize the secret to life is Nothingness you ahve reached complete enlightenment. ca-razy. i don't think i can do that, but i like realizing that my constant lack of comtemplating things is a great thing in the buddhist world. h aha. rocks! i also loved the part about how you s houldn't try to do things or concentrate on them, and they will just happen on their own. how great, i HATE doing stuff! i also found out the Theory of Knowledge class at Tualatin just read the book. i read it while sitting in my hammock, listening to full on surfer music and burning Sex on the Beach insence. what an utter hippie huh? next i have to read Things Fall Apart and A Prayer for Owen Meany, grar, for Beeler's class. ah well. i think this was a good first entry for my Blog (which i pretty much stole from Mel, but i'm going to pretend she is just a great trendsetter and i didn't actually just take it). well..i'll write again later. p.s. the song of the day is Times Like These by Jack Johnson.

      last night i kept thinking about all the nice things people have done for me. cause last night my mom came upstairs just to tell me she loves me before she went to bed. that mad me feel so good. then i started thinking about when chris gave me "mail" because everyone in our class kept getting mail. and laura told me once that she thought "everyone" had been jealous of me at one point or another. that doesn't sound nice, but she meant it in a nice way. and carissa telling me once that i looked really good lately. and jacob telling me how nice my boobs looked. ha ha, that one is strange. i hope i've said all those nice things to people. because even if someone just gives me a little compliment, or just goes 2 seconds out of their way for me, i feel so good. like someone really cares. or just wants me to feel better or now how they feel. i tried to think of when i gave someone a random compliment, but i couldn't. but i bet no one who gave me those compliments remembers saying them. so oh well. i love those commercials telling you to send money to a kid in a 3rd world country. they are sooo cute. i always want to pick up the phone the second i see them. they're so adorable, you know? anyway, i think i'm going to go read for a little while. loves.

      i had driver's ed for the first time today. it was pretty boring. and i had to walk 2 miles home. i really like walking though. i could just walk forever i think. i'm going to walk down to lindsay's in a little bit too. that's about 2 miles. i decided last night that i'm gonna go buy i bunch of nice clothes. like really nice clothes though. the kind of clothes you'd where to work. it's cause i was watching dead man on campus last night, and the guy who played zach morris in it was a big big stoner and wore really nice clothes all the time. i like that a lot. anyway, i'm gonna go take a nap so i can walk to lindsay's in an hour. p.s. when i get to heaven, i'm going to have sex with james dean.

      The day before yesterday was the last day of school. it was kind of a weird day. everyone left really fast, so i didn't get a chance to say bye to a lot of people. but that's okay, cause i'm gonna end up seeing tons of people over the summer. there's nothing to do in tualatin, so everyone just kinda walks around or goes to mashita and shit like that. i think it's gonna be a good summer though. i can feeeel it. ha ha. today i have to go get my passport renewed then i'm going to meet, james vik, cesario, and lynsea, cara, and molly at the balloon festival. fun fun. but i probably won't end up getting there til about 4, and they're all going around 12. oh, another i realized on the last day, is that spencer changed a lot. i can't really believe i ever had a big crush on him. i mean he's a cool guy an all, but jo (bo and jason) influenced him a lot too. like he kinda seems to think he's too cool for stuff and people. plus he may be going out with that chick i new from like 4th grade. oh, and he said he quit smoking pot and drinking. go figure. oh well. i'm going to europe, i'll meet a hot, cool guy there right? i'm pretty excited about going to see cesario today. i haven't seen him in awhile. a year to be exact. he called me last night, so we talked for awhile, but we've talked a lot since he moved. but now i actually get to see him! ha ha, yay! anyway, i better go. p.s. i had a dream last night where dad started smoking. ?

      sorry, this is the poem from that book.    Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines       he wrote a poem And he called it "Chops"       because that was the name of his dog And that's what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A       and a gold star And his mother hung it on the kitchen door       and read it to his aunts That was the year Father Tracy       took all the kids to the zoo And he let them sing on the bus And his little sister was born        with little toe nails and no hair And his mother and father kissed a lot And the girl around the corner sent him a       Valentine signed with a row of X's       And he had to ask his father was the X's meant And his father always tucked him in bed at night And was always there to do it  Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines      he wrote a poem And he called it "Autumn"      because that was the name of the name of the season And that's what it was all about And his teacher gave him and A      and asked him to write more clearly And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door      because of its new paint And the kids told him      that Father Tracy smoked cigars And left the butts on the pews And sometimes they would burn holes That was the year his sister got glasses      with thick lenses and black frames And the girl around the corner laughed      when he asked her to go see Santa Claus And the kids told him why      his mother and father kissed a lot And his father never tucked him in bed at night And his father got mad      when he cried for him to do it  Once on a paper torn from his notebook      he wrote a poem And he called it "Innocence: A Question"      because that was the question about his girl And that's what it was all about And his professor gave him and A      and a strange steady look And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door      because he never showed her That was the year that Father Tracy died And he forgot how the end       of the Apostle's Creed went And he caught his sister      making out on the back porch And his mother and father never kissed      or even talked And the girl around the corner       wore too much make up That made him cough when he kissed her      but he kissed her anyway      because that was the thing to do And at three a.m. he tucked himself into bed      his father snoring loudly  That's why on the back of a brown paper bag      he tried another poem And he called it "Absolutely Nothing" Because that's what it was really all about And he gave himself an A And a slash on each damned wrist And he hung it on the bathroom door      because this time he didn't think      he could reach the kitchen   i cried a lot when i wrote this. i didn't know where to put this, because i knew i wanted some people to read it, but i didn't want anyone who didn't get it to read it. i didn't want to exploit it.

      i just cried. i don't cry very much, but i was reading "the perks of being a wallflower" and there was this poem in it and it just kinda hit me that its really powerful, even though i've read it before. anyway, i just went to the bathroom so i wouldn't have to explain suddenly crying to my parets. and i closed my eyes before i went in there, cause seeing myself cry usually makes me cry even more and i could feel tears falling down my face and i was breathing really deep. then i finally opened my eyes and everything was blurry at first, but i could feel the rest of the really warm tears fall down my face and i realized how hard i was really crying. i don't know why, but sometimes stuff just hits me hard. i think it did today because my parents have been acting sort of weird and my dad said he wants me to go camping with them next weekend because its father's day, but i don't want to go because i don't want to have to be with michelle. and i felt a little bad and i don't fell like watching t.v., so i just read. anyway, luke is gone camping, but everything has felt sort of ok lately. i've been leaving a lot during lunch cause i hate it and don't have a lot of people to hang out with. i have been going with a couple different people who smoke to the condos across from my school. they go to smoke and i go to have a nice little chill spot with someone i actually like to be able to talk to. that's just the way school has been lately. and thank god there's only a day and a half left. today sucked so bad because i had my 3 hardest finals today. but at least i got them over with. and then it'll be summer and i think i'll feel a lot better. i always feel prettier and happier and have less things to worry about in the summer. a lot of people have told me that your freshman year sucks because you're still not sure about your group and where you are and all that stuff. but i guess it gets better later. its not like i don't many friends. i have a ton of friends, but they're all in different groups. so i don't have a clique. i don't want to worry about it anymore.

      this is all a little too stressful for me. i have to study all today for finals..but i promised james i'd think about oging to see riddick with him tonight. i saw him at the movies last night when i was with linz and she's sure he's her soulmate. i think that'd be chill if they went out. she could really experience my tigard friends. she has dwayne though...oh well. i'm suppose to be studying for finals right now. i don't think i can. i sat down and started to, but i started to cry everytime because i kept thinking about how i can't do this and even though i decided to start working harder, i can't pass these finals. it sucks. i normally wouldn't be upset about that, but about the second i got home, my parents were telling me i have to go camping with them next weekend. i told them i'm not going, but they said i have to go for michelle. fuck that. i don't owe her anything. i don't have to do anything for anyone who treats my like shit and ditches me. of coarse i didn't tell them that, but i think i'll tell my mom about it later, or else she won't get why i'm so pissed off about going. i don't want to talk to michelle and i sure as hell don't want to have to spend and entire weekend with her. that sounds mean, because we were such good friends, but i just can't take all this shady shit she's been pulling lately and people do just change and drift apart. i guess i should go study or try to cool off or something. bye.

      i haven't been able to write lately because my computer's been so screwed up, but hey, i'm back again! saturday was chaos. it was my brother's graduation and i had to hang out with my parents who haven't been able to stop fighting lately, and my crazy fucking grandparents. i eventually got to liam's concert at the paris though. i met ashley and carrissa there and also katherine and kyle and a few other pretty cool people were there. i totally fell in love with the lead singer of the first band. his band is named troy's bucket and they rock soooooo hard. the guy's name is james. since hardly anyone was at the show, a few chicks (including me obviously)went to the very front of the stage where james poured water on us and dedicated a few songs to us. he also got got on his knees right in front of my face and sang and smiled. arg, i fell hard and he's 20 and lives in arizona. damn all those gorgeous guys of the world....okay, not really cause where would i be without those gorgeous guys? i highly recommend troy's bucket by the way if you dig ska/metal/punk. the concert was a lot of fun though and it was a nice ending to a very shitty day...except when i got home the futon upstairs was made into a bed which means my dad was planning on sleeping up there instead of in the same room as my mom..which worries me. but i try not to think about it. i don't like dealing with bad shit by obsessing over it. speaking of which, this weeks been weird because of one main thing in particular. that thing would be whatever's going down with amy and michelle. they just give off such a bad vibe to me, and they're sort of turning into that "oh we're too 'dank' for you" thing that they got from jo. just..avoidance until its a problem. i just won't hang out with them until i have to..and that's looking like no time soon. anyway though, i'm watching the top 50 sexiest video moments right now, so i'm gonna go. have a lovely day all.

      the entire way i dealt with relationships changed when i was 16. i guess if you think about it must have started when i was 15. i went on a trip to europe with my parents and 18 year old brother, Luke, the summer before my freshman year. when we got to munique, germany, i met someone. Luke and i had gone off to wander on our own one day. we thought it was all right, then my brother saw some pretty hot girls (he and his girlfriend had broken up a few weeks before we left) and that's when i saw a pretty hot guy. he was with a group of a lot of kids, probably all about 16 or 17. he stood out though. stawberry blonde hair, skinny, but it was mostly muscle, and very very icy blue eyes. he looked at me too. he looked hard. or i just thought he was looking hard, but it could have just been his intense eyes. either way, he liked me enough to check quickly that no one was watching, tap another guy on the arm, and come up to where i was sitting. i remember it was really beautiful out and there were a few clouds far away but that was it. i also remember that he came right up to me and made no effort to be discreet. i think i was starting at him the whole time (probably with my mouth open)but that didn't seem to matter. as soon as he got up to me, he simply introduced himself. "hi there, i'm sam. do you mind if i sit?" he had a decent irish accent, and his smile made his eyes seem less intense. one thing about him that was the most specific, was the muscles that stood out in his jaw. you know when someone squeezes their jaw together and you can see these little muscles stick out? yeah, he had that. and i had it bad. i just smiled, he didn't seem mind my braces, so i said i'd love if he sat and i told him my name. one thing i don't remember is what all we talked about. i remember it was about 1:00 when i met him and when my brother came back at 7:00, we were still talking. there was music, something about the incredible hulk and spiderman, and not many serious topics. he asked about other guys i'd been with. so i told him was i'd been fingered, and i'd given hand jobs and told him about the guys who did them, then about the few random guys i'd met and made out with. i asked him about the girls he'd been with. he told me he'd had one girlfriend for 2 years, since he was 14, and he had kissed only 2 girls before her. he lost his virginity to this girl. they had sex 2 times, then they broke up. i wasn't sure if i should believe him, but the more he talked about her, the more i did. my brother went to go get food, and that he'd come back at 8. so we talked more. it doesn't really matter what we talked about. but i liked him. when we left he gave me a soft kiss on the lips and asked if i'd meet him the next day. "i'm doing family stuff most of the day. but luke and i were going to go to 'muse' at 9:30. we could meet there." he smiled. "that sounds great. see you then." then i left him standing there. when my brother asked about him, i was surprised to hear myself talk about him like he was just some guy-friend i had met. which is really what he was. he didn't metion sam to my parents either.   i did meet him the next night. at the club. we danced more than we talked this time. i was surprised at the lack of i.d. checking, but i guess germany is just that way. i didn't drink as much as i had planned on. i wanted my judgment to be intact. i knew he liked me because of something he did at the club, that, at the time, seemed pretty big. a slow song played (someone requested it and it was in french) so we danced really close, and his lips moved from my neck to left ear, but he never actually kissed me, just kept them there. this wasn't that part that showed me how much he like me though. the actual part seems really corny when i think about it now. after the slow song was over, a very "groovy" techno song came on, he looked at me, then he held me close again and we kept dancing so so slow. i felt so good. so good. "do you want to leave? that sounds bad, but i'd really rather be alone with you."  "i'd love to leave," i said after i sighed.   he took me to the hotel where he was staying. of coarse i did the nice sister thing and told Luke i'd meet him at our hotel at 2:00. he didn't question me. we had to sneek into the hotel and his room had 2 other guys sleeping in 2 other beds. he coughed loudly when we entered. "hey umm, guy? could you do me a favor?" they looked at each other, smiled, got up, and went into the room next door.  i had to ask, "so who are you here with?" he smiled, "well...its suppose to be a retreat for the kids at my private school, but all the nuns are gone with the missionaries so they hire chaparones. and, thankfully, these chaparones don't care in the slightest what we do." "and where did your room mates go?" he laughed, "oh, they weren't mad. john is in a fight with this girlfriend, who's in the room next door. and it also gives brian the chance to make the moves on john's girlfriend's pal who came along. no inconveniece whatsoever."  i smiled (feeling relieved), "good, i hate being mean." "i actually know that already." then he came closer to me and kissed me. then again, then again. then he took my shirt off, then i took of his, then the took of my bra. then i took of his pants. then he took of my skirt, then i took of my panties and his boxers. by then we were on the bed. he was hard. very hard. and i was wet. he kissed me everywhere. i forgot about everything. but later, i remembered every detail. especially when he stopped and walked across the room to john's bag and took out a Trojan. when he got back over to me, he layed down to his face was right at my belly button. he kissed my piercing there and then put his chin down so he was facing me. "do you want me to make-love to you?" i nodded and smiled at him. then i sat up and lift his chin so i could kiss him very softly. and we had sex. it hurt, but i didn't bleed, and i felt good. it felt amazing. i heard that girls feel self concious and vulnerable right after they have sex with someone and try to hide their bodies, but we just kissed for a little while, and i got up to put my clothes on while sam watched me. it was 1:17 according to my watch. "are you leaving already?" he asked? "remember, i told my brother i was going to meet him back at the hotel at 2."  "right...but its only 1:20." i smiled, "well i expected you to walk with me for a while, to make sure no one hurts me." now he smiled. "i don't want anyone to hurt you." he put his clothes on and we walked out with no worries.  we didn't talk very much as we walked around, but a few key things were said. "you know i'm leaving tomorrow." "i'm aware. are you going to call me?" "i don't know." "so you don't want to stay in contact with me" he didn't say this very upset, actually. just like a fact. "would it matter if we did keep talking? we're not going to meet again. and you are, so fully amazing, it wouldn't work. i'd meet someone back home, or you would, and we'd just be more attached." "oh you don't get attached after sex? supposedly losing your virginity. virgins bleed." he said all this in the most acusatory tone, however. "hey, you don't want to accuse me of lying. you know i didn't lie. and you know i wouldn't have slept with you if i didn't feel something for you. i just want to be with you, right now. and not think about what's happening." he paused. and we walked. a few minutes later, he sighed, and then responded, "you are right, about everything. that's what i want too." we didn't talk again until we reached my hotel and saw my brother standing in the lobby. we kissed for about 2 mintues then i stopped. "i'm not going to forget you, you know."  "i know." then he left. that was it.   the rest of the vacation went by, and i had a good time. a great time actually. but i thought of sam. i kept thinking about him. and that, folks, is about when i changed. at least all my relationships. before when i met a guy, i would flirt to no end. i could talk to any guy i wanted at a concert, or at a store, or walking downtown, but once i got to know him, it all changed. i suddenly couldn't continue to act like a girlfriend. but now, that 2 day period of not actually knowing a guy, could last for as long as i wanted it to.    okay, so this is all made up, but i want to write a short story and this is the first part of it. don't be surprised when i put more up.
