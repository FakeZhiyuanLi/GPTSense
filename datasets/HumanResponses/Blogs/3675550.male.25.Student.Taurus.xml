So i decided to go Westmall to do some shopping and have my hair cut... Surprisingly a friend of mine " Adrine" ask if want to go for dinner then a show... wow,.. that was just great... isnt that wat i wanted....! So i went to orchard to meet her and her friend for dinner at Genki shushi... Then she friends insisted that we go have a drink at the new pub that his friend open at Les Meridian...  Ya right supposingly go for a movie, ended up drinking one bottle of Martel with a very nice Uncle Bobo... and friends.... hahah i think its hilarious!

      Finally after a long bumpy ride"almost like phuking"  on SQ246 on the morning of 28th i am Home! Nice to be home... but immediately my sensitive nose became itchy runny... skins start itch abit too... well i guess its the pollution from the neighbouring countries again... Before coming back,.. yesterday i went shopping at Harbour town... and managed to get a bargain of Mambo T-shirts!   Mambo Bargain!       after that we went to eat japanese food at Goldcoast... its was pretty good and genuine, the place was jammed packed... After dinner we embarked on long journey up the scary road to Natural Bridge Park to witness the spectacular Glow Worms in the cave with waterfall inside.... Yeah it was like having many bright blue stars in the cave.... beautiful! but too bad we cant take photo of it... The glow worms are sensitve to lights... so if you guys are going there... pls refrain from using lights inside the cave... Its late now... better go sleep lor... and dream of what delicious local food i shall eat tomorrow!... ;)

      Just came back from studying with Boon Tiong and Ken Han... On my way back to IH "International House my college", i was virtually shivering and barely could onto the steering wheel... Then when i check the temperature online... it was 4degress celcius! Wow... breaking the record i experienced last winter of 6 deg celcius... Remembering that Ken Han is still studying at Boon Tiong's place... i called to advice him not to go home tonight because cycling in this cold weather with hardly enough clothes on is not adviceable...  Well... good luck to their Traffic exam tomorrow morning! ;)    urlLink Website For weather Report

      Saturday i spent the whole day slacking... Late afternoon i dropped gen off at Toowong's Coles to get me a rim of photocopy papers for only $3.50.. darn cheap... And i went to Sherwood shell station to pump petrol... only 89cent which is also very cheap considering the fact that its saturday and the price of petrol increased..  At night at about 10:30pm me, Giri, Nadine, Suzzaannne and Joseph had a game of Monopoly... It was a great game!!! I managed to buy all the train stations in about 3 rounds... and everybody kept patronising it! Yeah,.. the the funny thing was when all 4 of them landed on my stations in the same round... Hahaha... i was good.... ^_^ Well i guess i better got sleep lor... Try wake up early start doing something more productive like packing up my room for shifting, packing my laugage for home...and ofcourse studying for my final exam next friday!

      Finally after spending many days and countless hours admiring my friends Blog eg. Gen's and Cat's.. I am getting one for myself. Today i had a very mind draining and stressing exam (Structural Analysis). Went into the exam keep thinking its a 2hours paper till i got a shock when the examiner say its 3hours... Well that was wat me and my classmates thought it would be. Well after going through the questions, i realised that i got alot of time to day dream because i could only understand 2/4 questions. Well, since that is over i should leave it to fate then. My next paper is also the last paper, is on the 25th. I decided that i should give myself a day of break before i start touching the books again.  Gen my good friend whom introduced me to this wonderful website asked me to join Cat,Jazon and her for dinner afer their exam tonight. Didn't felt like eating at first, but the food (Veg & tofu, Calamari, Sweet & sour pork, spring onions & fish) was so much and so good that i decided to chip in and help them eat.  Wow.. such a long winded start to advertising my life, hehe hope i will persist in updating this website like a diary..  Good Luck to the rest of our exams!!
