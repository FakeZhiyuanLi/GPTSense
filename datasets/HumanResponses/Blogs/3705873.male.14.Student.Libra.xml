      I've just been to school. Seems mum forgot to inform me that there was a week-long induction at another school. Brilliant. Just what I needed. After four hours of sleep, I was woken up and told that I had to go to school. Not even my school - some other one I might go to if I crap up my exams. Met a couple of cool people, but it still doesn't balance having to get up at 7 after going to bed at 3, having to wear a suit (even though it  is  nice), and having to spend 6 hours at school. Not working, but at school just the same.  At least I'm home now. Life has become sucky again.  Oobs.

      Well, I'm free for 10 whole weeks. No more school; no more worries - and lots and lots of sleep. Finally, after 15 exams and more stress than a PMSing single mum, I can finally collapse and not care any more. Life is becoming good.  Man, I'm tired. I really should stop talking to people until 3am. And stop with the chocolate - I think it may be keeping me awake.  Now I need to get myself out of these shitty school clothes. Later.  Oobs.

      I wanna kill someone. He's quite tall, wears a black t-shirt and shorts, and has a monkey beard. And he fucking disallowed the goal. Wanker.  So, grab your torch and pitchfork, and meet me at the Stadium of Light (the Portugese one, dolt). If everything goes as planned, tomorrow's news headline will be "Swiss referee's head ends up on pike outside Portugese football stadium."  My head is screaming "Murder!" over and over. I need blood!

      Well, it's two in the morning. Probably wasn't the best idea in the world to stay up this late, but then, who the hell am I to care? I went to Matt's house, and he had enough lager for everybody, which is always good. We tried to get Martin (AKA "pisshead") onto non-alcoholic Becks, but the bastard noticed. Ah well... at least I got invited to his girlfriend's birthday (I think it's her birthday - I really should listen more), which should have pissed him off a bit.  Well, I've been on Prophet's Inc. and Fantasy Essentials - my favourite forums - for the last few hours, chatting to random people. God, I live a sad life.  Oobs.

      Well, this is just a quick note before I'm off to Matt's house. I've finished my last exam (and it was as easy as hell), and now I'm going to get pissed. Unfortunately, Matt says he's out of booze, but I'm sure I can steal a bit when he's not looking. I'll keep ya looped. And KiM, I haven't forgotten about those pics. I'll see if I can get a few shots today - I can't find any recent photos.  Oobs.

      Well, that was fun. I'm so damn glad I chose not to do Physics next year. That exam was so fucking boring it was unbelievable. And to top it off, they decided to concentrate on the bits I couldn't be arsed to revise so much. Here's a tip for you all - don't spend your revision time chatting to people on IM.  At least I only have one more exam left - History. Lame as hell, but it should be easy enough. Gotta revise crime and punishment in the early modern period of Britain. IOW, witch burning. Fun fun fun. OK, maybe the burning  was  fun, but revising it ain't.  Later,  Oobs.

      Hi there. This is my first ever blog.  Just to get one thing straight. I swear. A lot. If you don't like that, get the fuck out.  Now, onto the meat. My name's Samir. I'm an ugly sod living just outside London (that's England, not Canada). This is where I'm gonna post everything that pisses me off. And maybe a few things that were actually  good  about my day.  This is at ooble.blogspot.com because I use the name Ooble wherever I go on the net. If you don't know me personally, you'll know me as Ooble.  So there's my rant for today. Wow, I feel better already!  Oobs.

      Hi there. Take a look at this:  urlLink The Excessively Annotated RIAA Letter on the INDUCE Act (IICA)   Brilliant article. I really feel like ramming my fist down the RIAA's cocksucking throats. Words can't describe how pissed off I am at them - but that article can. Do me a favour: go and read it. That letter makes me want to puke up my McFlurry. Where's my 2x4...

      I'm fucking starving. I need food. It's ten to four - I haven't eaten in what? Three hours? Too damn long, whatever it is. I ate cereal at one (or something like that), and now I'm hungry again.  Yes, I know you don't care. Yes, I know I could go and make myself a sandwich, but that would involve picking my arse off of this comfy seat, walking down some stairs, strolling into the kitchen, getting the bread and cheese out, slicing the cheese, toasting and buttering the bread... you get the picture. It's just not worth the effort. Eventually, someone'll come home and give me food.  Either that, or I'll starve.

      Well, that was good. I haven't updated till now because, well, I have better things to do (like sit around doing nothing). But the food was good - it was a barbeque, for Christ's sake! Meat is good. Booze is good. Parents that don't mind you drinking are good.  Met some new people. There was... ummm... Emily, Becky... met Sara again... this bloke called Carl, another Jason (who I confused the hell out of) and this Tottenham supporter/twat called... um... I can't remember. There was also a few other people, but I can't remember their names. Oh... there was Jason's ex-girlfriend, Charlotte, who apparently is the very definition of used goods. And her latest boyfriend, who looks like he should be in a crappy punk band.  Anyhoo, food is good.  Oobs.

      I'm so damn bored. Life is boring - it's official. I have nothing to do. That's why I haven't posted on this thing in a week and a half - nothing really to say. Last weekend was my parents' 25th anniversary, so we went out to London and had fun. Not the most normal way to celebrate it, but there ya go. But they're having a party on the 17th - not massive, only 50 people - so everybody can come over and eat lots. Which is always good.  Lemme think... Georgina's BBQ tomorrow, and that party next week. Other than that, nothing to do. Just brilliant. Must play a game of football.  I need sleep. I slept for about 15 hours last night, but I'm still tired. Not easy being me.
