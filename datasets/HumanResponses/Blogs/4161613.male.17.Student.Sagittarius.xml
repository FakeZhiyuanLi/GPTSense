       The past three days have been a drag,only a silver lining tough,I actually passed my first test.Well,it's not really a legitimate cause for celebration,but,what the heck,I deserve something good out of this.I believe I have settled in class quite well,I have successfully mingled with students around me and although our conversations are not really constructive,I guess its a start.

       I had one of the most vivid dream in my entire life.The dream will seem wierd but try to read on.Let me explain to you...I dreamt alyssa milano(bear with me here) actually wanted to marry me and I agreed.It was all set that we would wed at 8 in the evening.Everything went on fine until I got a wierd phone call from...my EX!Just as she told me she still loves me,we got disconnected.I was shocked.Immediately I sought the help of Amin.He tried to call her again but to no avail.Both of us then,if I remember correctly,ran to the railway of jurong MRT station to get a better and clearer signal.Why were we on the railway is still bothering me.

       Well,overall,today was a good day,except for the niggling aches on my chest and calf muscles.Guess the workouts in the gym really materialised.Started as any ordinary day,but my day got brighter when i saw the girl I simply adored.Macam mat kental,I know,but watching her beaming smile from afar was,to put it mildly,enthralling.

       An instinctive step for other people, but a massive step for me: making friends.I can safely say that i have managed to make friends in my class,although i think it's just superficial.Guess a close friend of mine managed to convince me that I need friends to get by school.At first i scoffed at the idea,and i still do,but maybe not having friends would compound my sufferings.So,what the heck,I opened my mouth and voila,people actually wanted to talk to me.I consider myself an anti-social and most probably alot of anti-socials face this predicament too.However,I prefer to keep my 'friends' as that;just friends,no more,no less.I reckon they will just be a fleeting memory in my mind because personally,i'd rather forget about ITE if and when i move on to REAl tertiary education.

       Happy 39 the Singapore!The Parade was great,but it seems like deja Vu as it was almost a carbon copy of last year's National Day celebration.But hey,I ain't complaining.Although I only criticism would be that Singapore should roll out its impressive display of armoured tanks and vehicles,just to evoke some kind of security and patriotism amongst Sinaporeans.The Russians and Chinese are famous for their grandiose display of weapons so that would be aggressors will think two before confronting them.

        Hello...the school celebration for national day was a little dull,but fortunately,there was a silver lining:During a dance routine by the CEMTA group,a girl caught my eye.Judging from where I was sitting,she's probably 5 feet 3,obviously a malay girl.
