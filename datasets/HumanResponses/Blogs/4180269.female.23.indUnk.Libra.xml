      it's right. love don't come easy. that's what phil collins is telling us in his song "you cant hurry love". and i always hear this line from my friend, jan. but this don't bother me before... until it came to me. however, i wont get tired of waiting for love to come. i know that even the reason i cried before was love, it's still love that will make me smile again.  hmm, why do i often caught myself smiling alone these days? well, maybe, the love is coming to me now. =)

      i believe that there are some things in our better half that only us can see. No matter how people insists that they know the person inside out, i'll shot my ten cents to prove them that they are wrong.  this is such a sleepy saturday. i woke up so early and i have to be in the office by 10am. it's ninoy aquino's day... definitely, a double-pay holiday =) it's my kuya ed's birthday. but none of those made this day a special one for me. i've been so screwed for the past few weeks. bad break-up, scary starting overs, the betrayal of friends.. whew! but those were swept away by this happiness im feeling right now. what feeling can overcome the joys of being in love? yeah, same old, same old... just an ordinary story... for YOU! but this is a whole new feeling for me.  i fell in love with this person wherein from the start, all eyebrows are raising, all rumors are spreading, all comments and objections are flying in the air. i'm scared. but what the heck! knowing myself, i love making my life fussy. im interested with risks. and god! I AM IN LOVE! that's the most important reason, isn't it? and so the story goes...  along the way of our relationship, all the negative notes i heard from my friends about my partner that made me real scared are all appeared to be the opposite. things i heard are way far different from what i've seen. and what do you expect from people around you? again, the raising of eyebrows...and worse, they betrayed me when i least expect it. at first, it really hurts... but now, who cares?! anyway my other friend told me that i should trust my instincts.  today, i woke up early with a big smile on my face. knowing that this person proved that even the most devil creature has good sides too =) but oh.. im not saying that my partner is such a demon. hahaha dont get me wrong. i love her for who she is. im happy... very happy...
