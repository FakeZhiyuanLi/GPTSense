      I feckin HATE WORK!!!! Big dribbling mouse munching Arse bandiest in work. Try getting something done and try to get them to understand is like hitting your head off a very danse brick wall....  If I have a gun I wouldn't waste the shot on those useless Fuckers!! I'd turn it on my self and end the relentless time wasting they put me trough.. Trying to torturing these dumb shit is pointless as well because they are too thick to realize PAIN!!!!!!!  BURN IN HELL MOTHER-FUCKER.     so much for the nice post I was going for today.  What a fucking week. I would like to say the day off on Tuesday was relaxing but that a Lie. Send the car for a much over due service. Get told that "should be ready after lunch. Sent it in to card Dealer in Sandford at around 11 o'clock, so decide that it a nice day to walk down to Stillorgan. Got some Eddie Rockets and felt good.... HA! Here where the real fun starts, it is now 1 o'clock or there about and figure to walk back from Stillorga to the garage as car maybe ready. So get a phone call (first of many) on the way back and tell me they my brake pads are shot and will be 97EUROS to replace. Ho well yes. Now told that should be ready at around 3 o'clock. SHHHHYYYY!. So I then continue to walk back to Sandyford, get a brainstorm "Lest go see the Luas". Got to say very nice. Best think is there are not in-service yet and they are already starting to block up traffic. I watch for about 10 minuets and see the train go up and down the track with "The Lads" sitting in the train drinking Tae and greatly relaxing. Tax EUROS at work here people!  Back to me... I tier of watching Larry and the Lads using the Luas as Giant Scalelectrics set and walk off the explore the sight and smell of Sandford Industrial Estate. Get yet an other brainstorm. "go to Bewelys Hotel" as it is just un in LeopardsTowns. Sitting patently waiting for 3o'clock to come along. No sooner did the clock turn 3 and another Phone call... "eh! yeah we seam to have a leak in the gear box", "can fix to leak on the outside but will cause another 279EUROS if for us to open the gear box and repair the "possible leak". Said NO!!! Now have to wait till 5 o'clockl to get. "Waitress an other coffee here and complementary Newspaper".   After read the paper (I think that was the first time kin My life I ever read the dam thing trough out) and many Coffee's and trips to the bathroom it was time to depart to the Garage. Get there at 5:10 get car 6 o'clock... And it does not end here..  I Take the car home and can her a very strange noise from the gearbox. Thing nothing of it and pack the card for the night. Driving the car to work the next day, the clunking noise is now louder and followed up with a very high pitch squeaking noise. Yep I'm thing there's something not quite right!! The car struggles to get to the office. Got to take it back to the Garage, again.  So if I have to take back might as well get off work early to do so. Half day WAHOO! Not really I'm thinking that another 4 hours waiting around for my car. Thankfully not drop the car in explained the situation . Took a look at it and come back 20 minuets later saying."eh! sorry there was something loose in the engine". JOY!!!  So a week of shit in work and forking out 408EUROS on the car. God can't wait for the Weekend.

      Well what was a PISSY and I mean Pissyyyyyy Week, the Weekend was much better. Here the brake down:  Friday: Mad as hell and want to use one for the cranes across the way to pick Heavy Objects and drop them on the Office. Leave the office and head with Rick to Gambl0rs Caf√© for some much needed shooting fun in the form of my new love FAR CRY. So from about 7:30 to 11:00 I shoot the SHIT out of every living thing that could not out number me. Drove a Buggy like a lost maniac and generally enjoyed the much killing and maiming. The Bubs took the driving seat as he said for "only for five minuets".. Nerves on high alert and itchy trigger finger aside saw Bubs AHUM! Five minuets turn in to almost two hours. Rick nearly having kittens in anticipation of his go and Bub steps down. He replaces the mouse and keyboard for Paint and roller and tried to get me to help... HA! Well after much yakking on about the issues of whatever. Where drawn attention by Rick for some amazing screen shots of two guys he kill which could be only described as the vertical Missionary position.. He's a sick man???? I kid! So four phone booths down and much screams and shout of frustration from Rick and the Game I pack it in and headed home. One killer of a head ache from playing the game (god I'm getting old).  Saturday: Nice and relaxing day. Fart around the house. Watch Sings on DVD and once marvel at my TV. IT'S big... It's a Guy thing. AND NO IT'S NOT TO COMPENSATE FOR FAILURE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. Ah fuck it what do I care.. I got a big TV screw you!! Ok off the beating track, eh! as usual.. So head to the GYM around about 4 ish and have a good work out. Get out the about 6:45 and then just remember I have to be in town to meet D for dinner after her work. Ho god the rush. Fly down the road, fly in the door, drop the GYM bag. Much spraying for Deoderant, fresh top and out the door to Town. Well it's all good D is stuck in the store still locking up for half hour so I get away looking the tardy one he he. Down in Judge Roy Beans for some chow and here the Piece of SHIT euro song. Man we didn't even deserve 7 points. Off back to D's and of course She is asleep in Five minuets.    Sunday: More relaxing but with a difference... It feels like a REAL Summer WAHOO. Over in D's for some drinking and frolicking in the sun. Nice way to wind down the weekend. Oh one thing... For anyone who has heard the sound of a Fox Screaming you can appreciate this one. I think it was 3 O'clock on the morning and I get the living shit scared out of me when no more than three of the little fuckers start shouting into the nigh. Could not get back to sleep for ages  So here I am Monday morning tired with enough luggage under my eyes for J,Lo to go away for a MOUNT! Life is good! No really it is... Just can't figure out why???

       Fuck'em All if they can't take a Joke   That's what I want on my Tombstone. I would say that everyone under the sun are Feckless wonders but that is harsh for the truly intelligent amongst us. I am convinced that there is a jean out there for stupidity and aragent. I think it's call DUMB-FUCK chromosome. One day we will evolve enough to leave this chromosome in the shitty end of the Jean-pool, but till then we all suffer.  Who are these people? Well they the type that can not accepted when there wrong and in the wrong to boot. They instead try to pawn off there short coming on other... And generally the best thing about these people is they try to blame the poor fuck that try to make sense of their fuck up!   Life is hard.... But I guess that what make it worth wile.

      As I Mature I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.   I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.   I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big willy or huge boobs.   I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.   I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you're finished.   I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.   I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at  first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!   I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it   I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away.

      The Ancient and time honoured art of Fish Herding dates to Biblical time in Dublin. Fish-herding was started in the Dublin town of Finglas, when Finglas was a sea water Harbour. The name Finglas come from the their regional dialect of Irish known as HOW-A-YA Irish. Finglas meaning to Herd Fish with Big Stick.  The Ancient languid of the Fish Herders is well documented around the town of Finglas, painted on the walls of local shops, Bar, Banks and any free walls they can find.. Sadly as the Ancient dialect of How-a-ya Irish is longs since dead the writing are meaningless today. Saying like UP-DA-RAH!, I'S-DID-JASINTA-ERE and may other hold little understanding to unlocking this colourful languid.  Details on the practising of Fish Herding are well know and documented in History. Strangely most References describe these people as, ruffle translated as "THE GOB-SHITES IN THAT TOWN". This Art is only performed by the men and never the women. Once the men reach the appropriate age, which is around the age of 18. They are escorted to the local Pub and then consume 8 pints of larger and a bottle of Whiskey. After this ritual the young Fish Herders are given inflatable shoes, Sheepdog in a bubble and sent out into the Sea the stake their clam on the Fish. They inflate the shoes and head out to the open sea.  Sadly dew to inebriation or lack of balance most never survive the first trip out. This can count for the reason why the Women of the town dress up in low-cut close and heavy amounts of make up and try desperately to mate with any male in the pub, knowing that full well the Men will most like die in this venture. This can still be seen today with women of Finglas warring revealing close, large amounts of make up and drinking heavily in local pubs in attempts to get men to mate.   In closing the life of the fish herder is one of large amounts of drink and one night stands that ultimately lead to your death.. It's a way life that can still be seen today one some from or an other!!

      So... What have learned over my few days off!  Well, I learned that doing nothing bar watching DVD no matter what the weather is like is fun. LOTR Return of the king, Last Samurai and Buffalo Soldier are all Fantastic films. But on a sad note found out that DEAD-END and Starship-Troopers 2 SUCK HAIRY WET RHINO BALLS! But hay three out of five... Not bad.  I have also learned that is quite painful floating around town for about three hours is hard... On the up point, The Day After Tomorrow is actually good. Not the be all and end all for all films, but dam good summer flick.  I found out watching a whole day a cartoons, e.g. Dave the Barbarian (it ROCKS!!) is not very good for you. After the fifth hour you begin to act like the characters.. Not a good day for all involved in that one. And if you watched the show you'd know!!  I have also learned that staying up till four or five in the morning watch crap on TV and sleeping till eleven or twelve is the best cure for insomnia!! But side note on this, you tend to wake up a bit groggy and not here the beeping of the alarm that was set the night before. Well I guess that the noise for that dam thing going off is cure enough for that one!  All in all Great couple of days off. And now I'm back in work, but two days left till the weekend again.. UP THE FIG-NEWTON!!

      And once more it is the weekend...... And I find my self with nothing to do tonight. SHY! So I finger I may try the following..  1 )Gather a bunch of Mir-cats and train them in the mystical arts of accounting. Then rule the financial market.  2 )Go the deepest darkest parts of the Peruvian Jungle, find a hoard of Spider monkeys and try to be excepted by there group. Then take controller and take over the jungle.  3 )Gather crazed Blind Tibetan Monks. Drop them into the Dublin swear system and tell them there on a journey to find the fabled soft rock of POO-TIG.   4 )Go the Australian outback. Strip naked, covering yourself in strawberry jam and run around screaming "I LOVE BEING REBORN". See if one of two things happen. a) You are arrested for indecent conduct. b) You die of exposure!  5 )Stand on the Dublin Mountains with a copy of "Paul Merton's - Mass hypnosis for dummies". Hypnotise all men of Dublin in thinking Red is Green and Green is Red. Sit back at a major traffic light junction and watch the chaos!!   Can anyone tell it's a quiet day in work!

      1 )Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead.    Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow.     Do not walk beside me, either. Just leave me the hell alone.   2 )The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a leaky tire.  3 )It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal the neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.  4 )Sex is like air; it's not important unless you aren't getting any.  5 )We are born naked, wet, and hungry. Then things get worse.  6 )No one is listening until you make a mistake...  7 )It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to  others.  8 )If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of Bill payments.  9 )If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.  10)Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.  11)Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and other in his tribe will forse him to work long hours with little reward.  12)I don't have a license to kill. I have a learner's permit.  13)Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time.  14)If at first you don't succeed, Bungee jumping is not for you.  15)Duct tape is like the force, it has a light side and a dark side and it holds the universe together.  16)Telling a man to go to hell and making him do it are two entirely different propositions.  17)Tact is the ability to tell him to go to hell and have him be happy to be on his way.  18)There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.  19)Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.  20)How many of you believe in telekinesis? Raise  my  hands.  21)Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.  22)Remember, pain is nature's way of reminding you who's in charge.  23)Friends may come and go, but enemies accumulate.  24)Misery no longer loves company.  Nowadays, it insists on it.  25)and a final thought for your day:  Two wrongs don't make a right. But three lefts do.

She told me week's ago and today she is now gone. There is no point going on. I'm back on the sauce. I'm going to fall off the wagon.  I'm going back to my old habits, sauce all the way.

      It's hot, Dam Hot.... It's hot and it's wet, well ok it's not wet. But it is Hot. Real hot. The kind of heat Albinos run in fear from.   And to top things off it's hot inside as well as out side. Why you ask, well the building is to capacity. Actually it over capacity by about 20 people, and this is putting a strain on the air conditioning. So you can image the heat at one end of the building with about 50 odd server and a load of monitors powered on and pumping out about 1000,000,000 BTU's of heat a second. THAT'S HOT! Eh maybe, and just maybe a slight exaggeration.  So what I am trying to say here is HU-FUCKIN-RAGH for globe warming!!. Now if you will excuse me I am going down to the ice-cream freezer in the canteen and sit in it.

      For all of us who feel only the deepest love and affection for the way computers have enhanced our lives, read on.  At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon".  In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics ( and I just love this part):  1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.  2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.  3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.  4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.  5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, and was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five percent of the roads.  6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" warning light.  7. The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.  8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.  9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.  10.You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.

      Crucifiction Games: Random Obituary Generator of Doom   We regret to announce the unfortunate expiration of John Byrne, who on the 4th of September of this year was callously completely consumed by Gizmorlag the Slug Demon.  This unfortunate incident occurred in a small, unmarked sedan in New York City.  The deceased was reported to have shouted "Zounds!  I am undone!" just before expiring.  John Bynre is survived by a yellow lab named "Scurvy".  Funeral services will be held the 7th of next month.  Weird thing is.... How the hell did they know I was going to New York on that Date? NO seriously, no joke I'm going to New York on the 4th of September. Spooky!!

      So I'm disillusion with my job.......... Yeah in complete limbo! I though that it was just one week, but here three week later and still the same. Just don't have the same drive as in the good old days. Don't know what I want from it anymore?   I loved the times when I could come in here and no matter what the shit that went on around or landed on me, I could wipe it off with a smile and keep on going. Now as in the shit landing on me is a minimum, and don't get me wrong if it my mess I clean it up. The point is it never got to me. And basically still doesn't.  Thing is have you ever had the feeling where you are invisible in work. Now how can I explain this, or may some of you can already understand? People see you and talk to you and have a laugh, but as for everything on the business area and around seem like you are not involved. Or to put it maybe a better way "overlooked" and "ignored" feeling... It then comes to the point where nothing sound good anymore. One thing in this place that I always like is they evasive the positive. Now it comes down to the point where you can no longer see the positive anymore, and just focus on the negative.  It at time like this where I thank the powers that be that my personal life is fantastic. Friends Family and Loved-ones. At the end of the Day it is a job and fuck it. Just want to get back on track, but don't know how.......

      It's been a fun couple of days.  Was taken away on Thursday and given the "big talk" in work with my manager. Things like "We have seen a change" & "what can we do to help" came up. To which I replied "I bet you have" & "How's about a company car and an expense account". Well it was worth a shot, but no!.   So the meeting went fine, she asked and I answered. Laid out everything that was bothering me, e.g. "customer satisfaction" crap. The shit that has been forced down our necks for WEEKS!!! So, all in all we talked and apologies where given for their slip ups and areas of focus will be focused on. Time will tell.   The rest of the Weekend in Nutshell form. Don't ride the Luas unless you want to be squashed! Don't go to town on a Saturday unless you want to be trampled. If your really don't want to take the Girlfriend to the zoo, fake enthusiasm for shopping. But be prepared for head splitting boredom in payment. And when the button says "DO NOT PRESS" DON'T TOUCH IT... Hoo god me hand!!

      Well it true... The Rock Mr Dwayne whatever is in a half decent flick. Walking Tall...  Well me self Bubs and Rick where going to see Farenheit 9/11 but had well over two hours to kill. With a running time of about an Hour and a half it was perfect. Weren't expecting much and got so much more. Johnny Knockville is F'in great side kick for the Rock. And the best Anlagen for the Whole film is The Rock uses a Big plank of wood to Wup-ass. THE MAN DUN CARVED'EM A WUPPING STICK!!! The film is cheese but good Cheese.  Farenheit 9/11 is well worth watching... And note to anybody running agents Gorge Bush in the next Election.... Don't waste you money on a flashy party political broadcast. Jim Henson whole crew working 24/7 could not make a bigger Muppet!!

       When it comes to a Pub!! Physical impossibility. You can't just stay from a minuet, it just doesn't happen.       Went out to dinner in Celbridge with the Little lady and the fokes ( her side, not mine ), a Birthday celebration thing. We had a party in the house and then and then my self, the little lady and the Fokes went to dinner in some town close to Celbridge (Don't know where don't care). So had some good Chinese and all was well. Walking back to the car around about 10:00pm, all was well............... NO! We hear some lively music coming from a Pub and then utter the immortal words "We will stop in for a Minute"........       Yeah so got home at about Three O'clock in the morning and was in for Work at Nine o'clock this morning. And here's the fun part I didn't wake up till 10:15, Oh the funnery!
